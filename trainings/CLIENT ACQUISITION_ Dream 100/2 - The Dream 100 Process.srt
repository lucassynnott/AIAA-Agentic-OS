00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,459
of the 100 dream prospects right

43
00:01:12,459 --> 00:01:12,620

45
00:01:14,209 --> 00:01:16,040
different coaches in that industry

46
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,689
that i want to work with based on

47
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:17,900
different

48
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:19,370
criteria which we'll dive into in

49
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:20,489
a little bit once we really

50
00:01:20,489 --> 00:01:21,659
determine what a qualified

51
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:22,569
prospect is

52
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:24,239
and individually i'm going to do

53
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:25,849
some research on each and every

54
00:01:25,849 --> 00:01:26,799
one of them to see

55
00:01:26,819 --> 00:01:28,840
what value i can provide them is

56
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,879
it uh maybe their creative suck

57
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:32,799
right i can give them some better

58
00:01:32,819 --> 00:01:34,269
creatives i can make some better

59
00:01:34,269 --> 00:01:35,790
statics for them up front their ad

60
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:37,140
copy sucks maybe i can help them

61
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:38,590
with that maybe their funnel is

62
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:39,989
really bad and i can go and kind

63
00:01:39,989 --> 00:01:41,599
of give them a new funnel map or a

64
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:41,719
new

65
00:01:41,739 --> 00:01:43,459
landing page build up front to try

66
00:01:43,459 --> 00:01:45,019
and get my foot in the door with

67
00:01:45,019 --> 00:01:47,549
them then after that i'm going to

68
00:01:47,739 --> 00:01:49,310
create a dream 100 deliverable for

69
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:50,530
them so the actual thing that i'm

70
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:51,900
providing them of value

71
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,930
then we're going to send them that

72
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:55,900
deliverable on as many targeted

73
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,000
channels as you need

74
00:01:57,299 --> 00:01:59,519
we're going to follow up with them

75
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:01,760
then we're going to book call with

76
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,180
them

77
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,859
and then we're going to close them

78
00:02:03,859 --> 00:02:05,299
okay that's the process so we

79
00:02:05,299 --> 00:02:06,599
start with the industry

80
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,460
right i want to target online

81
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:10,550
coaches then we research online

82
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:12,460
coaches within that industry

83
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:13,909
and we say all right these are the

84
00:02:13,909 --> 00:02:15,289
hundred people that i want to work

85
00:02:15,349 --> 00:02:16,560
with these are perfect

86
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:18,449
prospects i know i can help them

87
00:02:18,449 --> 00:02:20,289
now we take those hundred and

88
00:02:20,289 --> 00:02:22,780
individually research them we see

89
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,969
what we can actually help them

90
00:02:23,969 --> 00:02:25,219
with that corresponds with our

91
00:02:25,219 --> 00:02:26,539
core offer and our service and our

92
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:26,879

uh you know ability and skill sets

94
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,430
to provide value and then we

95
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:31,979
create the actual dream 100

96
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,810
deliverable for them we send it to

97
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:35,539
them on as many freaking channels

98
00:02:35,569 --> 00:02:37,129
we possibly can okay we'll get

99
00:02:37,129 --> 00:02:37,330
into that

100
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:38,939
later we follow up with them we

101
00:02:38,939 --> 00:02:40,669
book a call and then we close so

102
00:02:40,669 --> 00:02:44,180
how do we actually find the dream

103
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:44,400
100

104
00:02:44,419 --> 00:02:45,639
prospects right you got to

105
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:47,000
leverage social media it's

106
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,800
everywhere right ain't going away

107
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,229
so use search

108
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:53,419
features on x instagram facebook

109
00:02:53,419 --> 00:02:56,169
linkedin um that's a big thing

110
00:02:56,169 --> 00:02:59,439
right so in eamon's video which in

111
00:02:59,439 --> 00:02:59,759
the

112
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,430
first module i showed you guys he

113
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:03,110
does a great job of breaking down

114
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:04,639
on x how he actually goes and

115
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:04,830
finds

116
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,930
people so what uh i personally do

117
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:08,849
is i take a piece from that book

118
00:03:08,849 --> 00:03:10,500
and also just use the search

119
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:10,710
features

120
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,699
as a whole so tiktoks as well has

121
00:03:12,699 --> 00:03:14,659
been really good so for example if

122
00:03:14,659 --> 00:03:17,360
i'm searching for um online

123
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:17,759

00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:18,949
right i'm trying to find a hundred

125
00:03:19,069 --> 00:03:20,169
online coaches that i want to

126
00:03:20,169 --> 00:03:22,319
reach out to i'm going to go find

127
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:24,590
someone's account like uh andre's

128
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:26,729
that's the one that aemon used in

129
00:03:26,729 --> 00:03:28,930
his example i'm going to go find

130
00:03:28,979 --> 00:03:31,180
account like andre who you know is

131
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:33,530
a medium-sized influencer he's not

132
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:35,199
as big as hormosie maybe one

133
00:03:35,219 --> 00:03:36,610
day he's going to catch up to him

134
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:38,020
but not as big as hormosie where

135
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,520
there's just a ton to sift through

136
00:03:39,539 --> 00:03:41,110
he has a little bit more of a

137
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:42,710
targeted smaller and more

138
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:44,620
sophisticated audience of people

139
00:03:44,949 --> 00:03:45,680
who are coaches

140
00:03:45,699 --> 00:03:47,229
and you know agency owners so i

141
00:03:47,229 --> 00:03:48,699
can go there and i can start to

142
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:50,780
look through his following right

143
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:51,840
so you

144
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:54,060
can first off search people within

145
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:56,300
that actual industry find someone

146
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,919
that has a small to medium

147
00:03:57,939 --> 00:03:59,360
sized targeted audience and

148
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,099
consistently putting out content

149
00:04:01,099 --> 00:04:02,639
look at their followers and who

150
00:04:02,689 --> 00:04:03,060
they're

151
00:04:03,139 --> 00:04:04,979
following and find different

152
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:07,000
people in that industry that way

153
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,719
or you can just use the search

154
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:08,949
features

155
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,500

right so again this is another

162
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,189
thing too that i do is when i'm

163
00:04:25,189 --> 00:04:26,800
just sitting there scrolling

164
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,040
through

165
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,399
instagram and scrolling through

166
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:31,560
facebook and twitter and stuff

167
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,319
i'll save profiles as i'm

168
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:34,000
consuming their

169
00:04:34,019 --> 00:04:35,319
content right so i help i

170
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:37,379
personally help info products um

171
00:04:37,379 --> 00:04:40,560
coaches agencies and sas companies

172
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:40,949
scale

173
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:41,930
so if i'm scrolling and i see

174
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:43,129
someone that i've never talked to

175
00:04:43,129 --> 00:04:44,240
and never really done anything

176
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:44,639
like this

177
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,459
for or for before you know never

178
00:04:46,459 --> 00:04:48,519
sent them any dream 100 uh

179
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:50,930
outreach deliverables i'll save

180
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:51,680
their profile

181
00:04:51,779 --> 00:04:52,810
add it to my list and i'll go and

182
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:53,930
see if there's something that i

183
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:54,790
can do for them there

184
00:04:54,819 --> 00:04:57,310
you could also join coaching

185
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:59,879
programs and groups within your

186
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:01,079
actual icp

187
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:02,870
so this is something that i need

188
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:04,560
to have a big warning on make sure

189
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,839
you aren't breaking any rules

190
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,769
with this and are not coming off

191
00:05:07,769 --> 00:05:09,870
as being spammy okay so to succeed

192
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:12,319
with this genuinely you have to

193
00:05:12,339 --> 00:05:14,459
provide an insane amount of value

194
00:05:14,459 --> 00:05:16,689
up front with your deliverable and

195
00:05:16,689 --> 00:05:18,879
have zero expectation of return

196
00:05:18,899 --> 00:05:20,560
okay so don't just start going and

197
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,180
joining a bunch of 97 a month

198
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:24,319
groups and 10 000 a year groups

199
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:24,639
and just

200
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,540
start spamming everybody in there

201
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:28,629
with uh you know dream 100 stuff

202
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:30,399
like be very targeted with this be

203
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:30,399
a

204
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:31,899
a little bit careful right you

205
00:05:31,899 --> 00:05:33,050
want to be you want to join a

206
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:35,199
group and then slowly elevate

207
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,990
yourself up to an authority figure

208
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:38,589
in that group by providing a lot

209
00:05:38,589 --> 00:05:40,879
of free value and reaching out to

210
00:05:40,899 --> 00:05:43,129
people individually on a very nice

211
00:05:43,129 --> 00:05:45,139
and genuine basis like hey i saw

212
00:05:45,139 --> 00:05:46,879
you were doing this i saw you just

213
00:05:46,899 --> 00:05:48,339
posted about you know starting

214
00:05:48,339 --> 00:05:49,610
your ad campaigns and i just

215
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,279
looked at some of your copy it was

216
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:51,980
a little

217
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:53,370
you know off i just made five for

218
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:54,879
you and wanted to give this to you

219
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:56,879
here so just be very careful with

220
00:05:56,899 --> 00:05:58,230
this because you don't want to be

221
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:59,569
those you know dm setters that go

222
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:00,879
into these school groups and just

223
00:06:00,899 --> 00:06:03,069
start spamming people okay but it

224
00:06:03,069 --> 00:06:05,050
is a great a great way to uh to do

225
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:08,480
to do so so what actually is a

226
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,670
qualified dream 100 prospect so i

227
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,350
define a qualified prospect as

228
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:13,579
someone who is consistently

229
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:14,310
posting

230
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:16,050
content somewhere online has an

231
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:17,759
online presence in some capacity

232
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,160
has a landing page or website is

233
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:20,480
running

234
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,800
ads that's personally for me i

235
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,959
want to see people that are

236
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:25,040
running ads so this can be removed

237
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,779
if you don't you know have this

238
00:06:26,779 --> 00:06:28,670
and if they can you can basically

239
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:30,480
just remove some of these or keep

240
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,660
them as you wish these are just

241
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:33,550
mine right uh and clearly is an

242
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:36,160
established business so for

243
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:36,310
example

244
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,910
some like roofing companies may

245
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:41,430
not be posting content or running

246
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:42,639
ads but you can search their

247
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:42,959
company

248
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,620
online to gauge reviews how long

249
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,439
they've been in business directory

250
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,569
listings etc so any combination

251
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,329
of these i deem as a qualified

252
00:06:51,329 --> 00:06:53,079
prospect the more the better

253
00:06:53,089 --> 00:06:55,040
though so the more that they have

254
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,360
like if

255
00:06:55,379 --> 00:06:56,740
they're clearly an established

256
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:58,209
business they're running ads they

257
00:06:58,209 --> 00:06:59,600
have a landing page or website

258
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:00,920
they have an online presence

259
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,259
they're consistently posting

260
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:03,970
content online they are an a plus

261
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:04,399
prospect to

262
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:06,050
me and i'm going to prioritize as

263
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:08,120
i'm working down my dream 100 list

264
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,040
of prospects i'm going to

265
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:09,500
prioritize

266
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,300
them over the other ones they're

267
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,930
like my a plus tier prospects to

268
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:14,399
reach out to so they get a high

269
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:16,879
priority stamp on there so that is

270
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:22,189
module two quick one for you let's

271
00:07:22,189 --> 00:07:25,660
