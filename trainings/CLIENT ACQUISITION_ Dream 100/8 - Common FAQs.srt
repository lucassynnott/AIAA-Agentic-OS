1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:00,550
All right.

2
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:01,470
So this would be a quick one over

3
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:02,120
here for you guys.

4
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:04,269
Common FAQs that I get with

5
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:06,309
Dream 100 from a lot of members

6
00:00:06,309 --> 00:00:07,650
and people just DMing me in

7
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:08,259
general.

8
00:00:08,259 --> 00:00:09,599
I wanted to consolidate

9
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:11,720
these into a few slides here.

10
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,869
So let's answer some FAQs, shall

11
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:14,390
we?

12
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:16,519
What channels are best to use?

13
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:17,609
Every single one of them.

14
00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:18,940
Like I talked about earlier, you

15
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:20,280
want to hit them from all angles

16
00:00:20,489 --> 00:00:22,100
and just know kind of where your

17
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,140
ICP typically likes to hang out.

18
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:25,500
You know, that's another big

19
00:00:25,809 --> 00:00:26,070
thing.

20
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:27,829
So if your ICP likes to hang out

21
00:00:27,829 --> 00:00:29,420
on, you know, Instagram or

22
00:00:29,559 --> 00:00:31,579
Facebook, you can kind of lean

23
00:00:31,809 --> 00:00:33,710
and put some more emphasis towards

24
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:35,039
those platforms.

25
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:36,950
But overall, you want to hit them

26
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:37,960
from as many

27
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,210
angles as you possibly can to get

28
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:40,390
in contact with them until they

29
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:41,119
reach out to you.

30
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:41,700
And then from

31
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:42,969
there, you can shift them to

32
00:00:42,969 --> 00:00:43,829
another channel.

33
00:00:43,969 --> 00:00:45,380
If they prefer, you know, if they

34
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:46,530
answer you on Reddit

35
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:47,810
and you're like, yo, are you on

36
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:48,689
Reddit all the time?

37
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:50,020
Or like, would you rather talk on

38
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:50,960
text or call or

39
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:52,079
email or something?

40
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:53,539
You can shift the conversation

41
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,380
over to there.

42
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:55,880
But again, follow up on every

43
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:57,380
platform until you can basically

44
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,590
get in contact with them.

45
00:00:58,649 --> 00:00:59,990
Also see where your prospect is

46
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:00,310
most

47
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:02,840
active on and where they're likely

48
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,489
to not have setters.

49
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:07,019
So for example, I work in the info

50
00:01:07,019 --> 00:01:07,260
product

51
00:01:07,569 --> 00:01:09,209
space a lot and a lot of the

52
00:01:09,209 --> 00:01:11,430
accounts use AI or setters on

53
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:13,959
Instagram, but not in email or

54
00:01:13,959 --> 00:01:14,150
other

55
00:01:14,469 --> 00:01:14,680
channels.

56
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,989
So that's something to be aware of

57
00:01:15,989 --> 00:01:17,040
when you are reaching out to

58
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:17,599
people.

59
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:19,439
How to get past

60
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:19,980
setters.

61
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:21,409
Let's just talk about that real

62
00:01:21,409 --> 00:01:21,849
quick.

63
00:01:21,849 --> 00:01:23,049
So you want to scope out the

64
00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:23,709
outreach channel

65
00:01:24,189 --> 00:01:24,790
beforehand.

66
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:26,540
And sometimes I'll even go and

67
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:27,340
book a call.

68
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:29,200
If the closer is the owner, you

69
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:29,760
can tell

70
00:01:30,069 --> 00:01:31,689
really plain clearly if the closer

71
00:01:31,689 --> 00:01:33,420
is the owner, especially with

72
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,129
agencies, you're able to find

73
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:37,150
that out pretty, pretty direct

74
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:39,180
just by looking at their Calendly.

75
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:41,439
Also scrape the direct email of

76
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:41,640
the

77
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:42,250
owner.

78
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:44,480
So use the Apollo Chrome extension

79
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,709
on LinkedIn to actually pull the,

80
00:01:46,709 --> 00:01:48,700
the actual email from their

81
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:49,219
profile.

82
00:01:49,219 --> 00:01:50,400
There's also a bunch of tools for

83
00:01:50,489 --> 00:01:51,829
Twitter and Facebook that you can

84
00:01:51,829 --> 00:01:53,010
do to pull emails from

85
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:54,900
and then still send the actual

86
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:56,950
deliverable to them and direct it

87
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:57,939
to the owner.

88
00:01:57,939 --> 00:01:59,120
So sometimes like the

89
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,250
setters are pretty, you know, low

90
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:03,299
level or the actual owners will

91
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:04,260
read the DMs.

92
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,659
And I've gotten past

93
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,049
the setters sometimes just saying

94
00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:08,349
like, Hey, I made this for, you

95
00:02:08,349 --> 00:02:10,580
know, the owner, Gary, can you,

96
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:12,060
can you send this over to him and

97
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,650
just, you know, provide me with

98
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:15,030
his feedback or is there a way I

99
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:15,159
can

100
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:16,509
get directly in contact with them,

101
00:02:16,509 --> 00:02:17,620
especially in more like B2B

102
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,080
scenarios, you'll be surprised at

103
00:02:19,219 --> 00:02:19,430
how

104
00:02:19,949 --> 00:02:21,509
easy it is to get in contact with

105
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,370
the owner through a setter.

106
00:02:23,379 --> 00:02:24,979
Now, when you're in more B2C, like

107
00:02:24,979 --> 00:02:25,030
info

108
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:26,539
products, it's a little bit more

109
00:02:26,539 --> 00:02:27,370
difficult, right?

110
00:02:27,509 --> 00:02:28,680
Like if you try and go DM, like

111
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,020
Dan Martel's page or

112
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:31,159
something, you're going to get

113
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,439
blocked with a setter and they're

114
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:33,680
going to try and flip the script

115
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:33,900
on

116
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:35,949
trying to try to sell you on their

117
00:02:35,949 --> 00:02:36,560
stuff.

118
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,539
So just be cautious of that.

119
00:02:38,539 --> 00:02:39,270
But these are some easy ways

120
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:40,810
to get past setters.

121
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:42,610
Is sending an email worth it?

122
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:44,330
Every single time, a hundred

123
00:02:44,389 --> 00:02:44,870
percent.

124
00:02:45,379 --> 00:02:45,650
Going to move

125
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:45,979
on.

126
00:02:45,979 --> 00:02:47,509
Should I send a loom video?

127
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,669
A hundred percent.

128
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:49,439
Every time.

129
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:51,030
Or, you know, some sort of video

130
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:51,500
in

131
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:52,590
your outreach document?

132
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:53,439
Every single time.

133
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:53,629
Yes.

134
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:54,789
So these are two email, two

135
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,740
questions I get all the

136
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:56,210
time.

137
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:57,659
Should I send an email and a

138
00:02:57,659 --> 00:02:58,189
video?

139
00:02:58,189 --> 00:02:58,590
Yes.

140
00:02:58,590 --> 00:02:59,659
Every single time.

141
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,979
Here's an optimal cadence for

142
00:03:02,289 --> 00:03:03,360
outreach and follow-up.

143
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,849
So day one, I send the initial

144
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,500
message.

145
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,199
Day two, follow-up one.

146
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:07,659
Day three,

147
00:03:08,009 --> 00:03:08,610
follow-up two.

148
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:10,360
Day four, I have basically I layer

149
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,449
on other channels.

150
00:03:11,449 --> 00:03:13,069
So if I reached out to Instagram

151
00:03:13,289 --> 00:03:15,210
day one, two, and three, then I'll

152
00:03:15,349 --> 00:03:16,919
start to layer on Twitter,

153
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:18,449
Facebook, and LinkedIn.

154
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:19,699
Day five, I'll do

155
00:03:19,979 --> 00:03:20,990
follow-up three of the initial,

156
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:22,159
you know, Instagram ones.

157
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:23,469
And then I'll keep just following

158
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:24,039
up from there.

159
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:25,919
And then I'll keep layering on

160
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:28,199
additional channels as we continue

161
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:30,919
down the process and as days pass.

162
00:03:31,009 --> 00:03:32,710
So this is again, why you need to

163
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:34,310
have a campaign board to keep

164
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:36,159
everything organized and write

165
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:36,289
down

166
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:37,539
in the actual cards of the

167
00:03:37,629 --> 00:03:39,270
campaign board and the prospects.

168
00:03:39,379 --> 00:03:40,319
Like I reached out to

169
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:42,469
Dan Martell through Instagram on

170
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:43,460
this day.

171
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:45,000
And then set a reminder to send

172
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,400
them another one on Instagram,

173
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:48,409
Twitter, LinkedIn, et cetera.

174
00:03:48,409 --> 00:03:50,319
So just make a campaign board, use

175
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:50,840
Trello.

176
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,539
It's free

177
00:03:51,659 --> 00:03:53,319
and just build out this pipeline

178
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:55,000
and this process properly.

179
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:56,159
And if you need help,

180
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:56,729
hit me in Slack.

181
00:03:56,759 --> 00:03:57,599
I definitely got you.

182
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:58,629
I'll help you out with that.

183
00:03:58,629 --> 00:03:59,219
Of course.

184
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:03,219
So another question I got was

185
00:04:03,219 --> 00:04:05,659
approaching, it was around

186
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:07,210
approaching medium qualified

187
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:07,680
leads,

188
00:04:07,949 --> 00:04:08,110
right?

189
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:09,340
So it depends on how just, you

190
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:10,729
know, mid they are really.

191
00:04:10,729 --> 00:04:12,120
So not everyone that comes to

192
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,250
your ad funnel or cool email

193
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:14,479
campaigns will be qualified,

194
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:14,860
right?

195
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,079
That's just part of the game of

196
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:16,959
marketing.

197
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,459
So it all goes back to your

198
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:20,360
research process with something

199
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,990
like Dream 100.

200
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:22,920
You control

201
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,560
who you reach out to and who sees

202
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,319
your stuff.

203
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:27,189
With ads, you can to a degree, but

204
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:27,920
still some people

205
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,420
might slip through the cracks that

206
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:30,350
aren't qualified.

207
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:31,410
So there are plenty of hot

208
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:32,319
prospects out there.

209
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:33,839
Reach out to the ones that you

210
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:35,490
think are spot on first and then

211
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:37,379
move down your list, right?

212
00:04:37,379 --> 00:04:37,660
So

213
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:38,949
approaching kind of medium

214
00:04:38,949 --> 00:04:39,790
qualified leads.

215
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:41,410
I still reach out to people that I

216
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:41,930
think are medium

217
00:04:42,509 --> 00:04:42,699
qualified.

218
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:43,730
I just reach out to the hot ones

219
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:44,120
first.

220
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:47,250
Question as well, send a message

221
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:50,360
beforehand to connect a week or so

222
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:52,620
before sending the Dream 100

223
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:53,120
deliverable.

224
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,009
So I had someone reach out to me

225
00:04:54,009 --> 00:04:55,980
that was like, yo, if I'm planning

226
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:57,199
on sending Dan

227
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:58,339
Martel, I don't know why I keep

228
00:04:58,430 --> 00:04:59,329
using him as an example in this

229
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:01,019
one, but if I'm sending Dan Martel

230
00:05:01,089 --> 00:05:03,579
a Dream 100 deliverable in a week,

231
00:05:03,649 --> 00:05:05,290
should I send them a week before

232
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,139
to connect with them?

233
00:05:07,449 --> 00:05:08,269
Yes.

234
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:09,829
If you don't have a salesy profile

235
00:05:09,829 --> 00:05:11,060
and you actually sound like a

236
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:11,860
human, you know,

237
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,360
just be a human and try to make a

238
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,920
genuine connection with them a

239
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,540
week before, just build that

240
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:18,199
relationship, you know, like, like

241
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:19,680
some of their stories or something

242
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,459
and just come off

243
00:05:20,569 --> 00:05:21,949
as like a freaking human, like a

244
00:05:21,949 --> 00:05:23,300
fan of theirs and a fan of their

245
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,389
brand and what they're

246
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:24,949
doing.

247
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:26,860
Not overly crazy, but just like be

248
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,240
a human at that point.

249
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,160
And then you can send

250
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:30,540
them the deliverable saying like,

251
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:31,870
Hey, I've been following you, you

252
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:32,779
know, past week and

253
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:33,480
loving your content and

254
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:33,920
everything.

255
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:34,899
I've just been working on this for

256
00:05:34,899 --> 00:05:35,480
you the past week

257
00:05:35,569 --> 00:05:36,449
to want to send this over.

258
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:37,600
That's a great thing to do.

259
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,399
So module nine, let's go into

260
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:41,089
some KPIs and targets that you

261
00:05:41,089 --> 00:05:42,779
need to hit to scale the strategy

262
00:05:42,779 --> 00:05:43,720
up and scale your
