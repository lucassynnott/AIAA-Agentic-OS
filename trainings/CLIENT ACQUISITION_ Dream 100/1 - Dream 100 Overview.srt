1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:04,620
I had to do something weird all

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:09,630
right anyways welcome to module

3
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:12,080
one hope you like the drum

4
00:00:12,119 --> 00:00:13,560
roll hope you guys could even hear

5
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:14,970
it with this mic i don't even know

6
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:16,079
if you really could but

7
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,140
anyways welcome to module number

8
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:20,329
one of the dream 100 of course

9
00:00:20,329 --> 00:00:22,559
here inside of client ascension so

10
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,109
guess what we're gonna be talking

11
00:00:24,339 --> 00:00:25,719
about we're gonna be talking about

12
00:00:25,719 --> 00:00:27,160
how to sign whales and

13
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:28,780
make that internet money for free

14
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:30,829
because essentially the dream 100

15
00:00:30,829 --> 00:00:31,760
strategy is that

16
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,759
you're going to go out there and

17
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:35,850
for zero marketing cost you know

18
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:38,310
zero ad dollars not buying domains

19
00:00:38,359 --> 00:00:40,250
nothing like that you're going to

20
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:42,049
be able to sign massive clients

21
00:00:42,049 --> 00:00:43,840
and yes it does take some work on

22
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,399
your front but again this is how

23
00:00:45,409 --> 00:00:46,899
to sign whale clients and make

24
00:00:46,899 --> 00:00:48,359
that internet money for free

25
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:50,299
right when i give us some of that

26
00:00:50,299 --> 00:00:52,310
internet money so first what the

27
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:54,799
heck is this dream 100 thing and

28
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,579
who came up with it in the first

29
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:58,299
place so right here i want you

30
00:00:58,299 --> 00:01:00,320
guys to meet amen so amen is

31
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:01,140
probably

32
00:01:01,179 --> 00:01:02,770
some of you actually joined client

33
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,390
essentially because of amen but he

34
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:05,480
runs a content agency

35
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,510
and he is inside here as well so

36
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:09,609
if you guys want to hit him up for

37
00:01:09,609 --> 00:01:11,700
sure definitely dm on slack ask

38
00:01:11,739 --> 00:01:13,439
him some questions hit him up on

39
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,260
twitter he's got a great twitter

40
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:17,079
as well but amen came up with this

41
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,730
and right here is his original

42
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:22,939
dream 100 outreach video okay so

43
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:25,400
pause this real quick scan that

44
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:25,760
because

45
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:27,379
this is the video that it's about

46
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,359
20 to 30 minutes long i believe

47
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:30,739
and this is the video that i

48
00:01:30,739 --> 00:01:30,939
actually

49
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:32,519
watched initially and learned

50
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:34,500
about the strategy so he came up

51
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,319
with it and coined the term and

52
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:36,459
pretty

53
00:01:36,519 --> 00:01:38,180
much i just am taking this entire

54
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:39,989
thing this entire strategy just

55
00:01:39,989 --> 00:01:41,859
expanding on it a little bit more

56
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,269
and diving into what has

57
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,260
personally worked for me and what

58
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:47,200
i've seen work for a lot of other

59
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:47,379
members

60
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,180
inside of the community lately but

61
00:01:49,379 --> 00:01:50,590
again this is a great base point

62
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:52,060
to start with so definitely a

63
00:01:52,099 --> 00:01:54,140
great video to to watch highly

64
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:56,670
recommend and recommend following

65
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:59,250
amen so what is dream 100 in the

66
00:01:59,420 --> 00:01:59,450
first

67
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:01,799
place okay dream 100 is a cold

68
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:04,109
outreach method where you actually

69
00:02:04,109 --> 00:02:06,579
research and perform free

70
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:09,139
upfront work for someone without

71
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:11,599
them asking you to or without you

72
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,810
asking them if you should do the

73
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,960
work in the first place okay so

74
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,669
free work as you're gonna

75
00:02:17,669 --> 00:02:19,949
basically find out equals a lot of

76
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:20,680
money if

77
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:23,539
you do it right and yes you heard

78
00:02:23,539 --> 00:02:26,199
that right you do stuff for free

79
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:29,180
upfront okay for free upfront

80
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:29,430
you're

81
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:31,569
doing free work upfront okay so

82
00:02:31,569 --> 00:02:33,860
why does this work it's basically

83
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:36,020
because you instantly stand out

84
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:36,280
from

85
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:38,159
every single other cold dm cold

86
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:40,259
call cold email that any prospect

87
00:02:40,259 --> 00:02:41,879
gets and all the paid ads they're

88
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:43,659
seeing right you stand out you

89
00:02:43,659 --> 00:02:45,389
gave them something of value

90
00:02:45,389 --> 00:02:47,139
upfront you took the time to

91
00:02:47,139 --> 00:02:48,319
research them

92
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,830
see what they needed learn about

93
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:51,349

testimonials to use this strategy

165
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:37,829
why because you're already doing

166
00:04:37,829 --> 00:04:39,560
the upfront work and providing

167
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,240

you you know 10 pieces of ad copy

172
00:04:48,829 --> 00:04:51,079
you're not going to ask me like

00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,480
do you have any major case studies

174
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,779
you know you might ask me hey who

00:04:53,779 --> 00:04:55,000
have you worked with before

176
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,430

some ad copy that i do right so

184
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,480
using dream 100 shifts the

185
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,449
prospect's view of you away from

186
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:12,660
hey

187
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,060
does this guy have case studies

188
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:15,810
and testimonials to oh shit he did

189
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:17,560
this thing for me this is really

190
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,000
good and it puts a lot of the work

191
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,560
on the deliverable and your skill

192
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,560
set itself and that's

193
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,800
the main thing or a lot of the

194
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,269
emphasis on your skill set and if

195
00:05:24,269 --> 00:05:25,800
you're good so that's why i want

196
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:26,610
you guys that are new to

197
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:27,889
understand about this strategy and

198
00:05:27,889 --> 00:05:28,759
why it's so good for you

199
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,990
so again it's perfect for you new

200
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:33,339
agency owners and plus it's free

201
00:05:33,339 --> 00:05:35,240
right if you're on a small budget

202
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:37,319
you're only making two three four

203
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:39,089
five k a month right netting a

204
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:40,680
couple grand a month probably

205
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:40,839
don't

206
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:42,149
have a lot to spend on ads and um

207
00:05:42,149 --> 00:05:43,680
you know you need something that's

208
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,399
a little bit more cost effective

209
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:47,290
and ideally free here well here

210
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:49,029
you go this is how you get your

211
00:05:49,029 --> 00:05:51,720
first big deals through the door

212
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,660
and something to note too is you

213
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:55,769
know with other outreach methods

214
00:05:55,769 --> 00:05:57,240
and other acquisition methods

215
00:05:57,519 --> 00:05:59,629
you can get some big deals from it

216
00:05:59,629 --> 00:06:02,079
but dream 100 is very freaking

217
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:04,279
targeted right it's free

218
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:05,949
and it's very targeted you can

219
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,649
pick the highest people in the

220
00:06:07,649 --> 00:06:09,560
food chain the biggest companies

221
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:09,639
in

222
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,459
your space give them free stuff

223
00:06:11,459 --> 00:06:13,350
and sign them and then from there

224
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:14,439
you leverage the

225
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,509
shit out of that case study you

226
00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:16,670
leverage the shit out of the fact

227
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:18,040
that you're using them

228
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:19,569
or that sorry that you're working

229
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:21,100
with them and providing them a ton

230
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,360
of value getting them insane

231
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:23,860
results and then everything else

232
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,139
is downstream so every other

233
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:26,600
company below them on the totem

234
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,220
pole below them on the food chain

235
00:06:28,339 --> 00:06:29,839
in that industry is gonna be like

236
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:31,079
oh man evan worked with them

237
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,100
that's crazy he's great uh he must

238
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,839
know what he's doing right so

239
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:36,920
that's why this strategy is great

240
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:38,519
and it also avoids these these

241
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:40,199
situations here so you know you

242
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:41,959
aggressively cold pitching your

243
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:42,279
service

244
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,149
that's the prospect uh and then

245
00:06:45,149 --> 00:06:47,230
your prospect here you being a

246
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:49,589
sleaze trying to slide the dms for

247
00:06:49,629 --> 00:06:49,720
a

248
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:50,870
quick buck i actually don't

249
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:52,319
remember writing that one but it's

250
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:53,720
kind of funny so i'm not gonna lie

251
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,199
that was great good job evan and

252
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,560
just for context i was able to

253
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,040
work with these guys using this

254
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:58,360
method

255
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:00,319
without a website without a

256
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,439
landing page without a vsl and

257
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:04,420
without content so that's

258
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,399
something that's

259
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:07,529
really funny too is i build

260
00:07:07,529 --> 00:07:10,139
landing pages write vsls and run

261
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:12,589
ads for people and i was able to

262
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:13,000
sign

263
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,740
these companies without uh you

264
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:18,759
know actually having one myself so

265
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,199
goes to show again this works very

266
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,620
well if you do it right so i want

267
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,839
to be clear as we move on this

268
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:29,889
module too that these messages you

269
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:30,279
see

270
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,100
right here are not dream 100

271
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,910
outreaches these are just typical

272
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:35,800
cold outreach messages right so

273
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,120
this

274
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,750
person right here is saying hey

275
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:39,240
evan uh i've got an important

276
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,000
offer for you oh how important is

277
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,160
it

278
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,129
i'll write your copy for the next

279
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,399
10 email campaigns for free if my

280
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:47,079
emails outperform your current

281
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:47,480
ones

282
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:49,089
we can talk about doing more if

283
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:50,759
not we're all good mind if i send

284
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:53,000
over a portfolio of my recent work

285
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,389
so something to note this is not

286
00:07:55,389 --> 00:07:58,319
dream 100 why uh he's asking me if

287
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,040
he wants me to do the free work

288
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:02,209
for him dream 100 is sending it

289
00:08:02,209 --> 00:08:04,100
first right and we'll get into in

290
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,560
the next slide here you know

291
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:07,610
differences between a cold dm like

292
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:09,220
this which is a better cold dm i i

293
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:10,600
do have to be fair that is a

294
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:11,939
better cold dm with a better offer

295
00:08:11,939 --> 00:08:13,139
versus just some dumb generic

296
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:14,680
stuff that you guys probably see

297
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:14,839
all

298
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,149
online but you know it's a

299
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:17,740
difference between that and a

300
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,879
dream 100 outreach and this guy

301
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:20,360
right here

302
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:22,889
it's literally saying hi i made

303
00:08:23,019 --> 00:08:24,459
you a four-step cold outreach

304
00:08:24,459 --> 00:08:26,360
script for gym growth so you can

305
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:26,680
book

306
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,779
15 to 20 plus gym growth workshop

307
00:08:28,779 --> 00:08:30,399
tickets per month you're part of

308
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:32,220
my dream 100 prospects i want to

309
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:32,600
work

310
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:34,610
with that was just the stupidest

311
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:36,548
line because like it's he's not

312
00:08:36,548 --> 00:08:38,840
using the strategy right okay is

313
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:40,809
you're part of my dream 100 like

314
00:08:40,809 --> 00:08:42,480
what is that like you know it just

315
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,200
sounds very reachy and pitchy

316
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,679
right and like you're part of my

317
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:47,059
dream like big heart guys big

318
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:48,440
heart you know it doesn't

319
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,110
doesn't work did you see that

320
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:52,220
little heart scheme that's awesome

321
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:55,399
anyways um you know that's not

322
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,549
dream 100 okay that's a cold dm at

323
00:08:57,549 --> 00:08:59,080
the end of the day the actual

324
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,070
dream 100 process of that would

325
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:01,240
have

326
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:02,519
been sending it up front doing the

327
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:03,799
free work or actually sending the

328
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:06,039
four-step outreach right so

329
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,509
and there's a big difference

330
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,169
between again cold dms and dream

331
00:09:09,169 --> 00:09:11,399
100 dream 100 you have to do the

332
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:11,799
work up

333
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,500
front so yes there is a potential

334
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:15,450
that the person might not like the

335
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:17,000
work they might not need it they

336
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:18,490
might not even see it they might

337
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:20,029
ignore you we're going to go over

338
00:09:20,029 --> 00:09:21,480
later in a couple modules down

339
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,789
the line here of how to combat

340
00:09:22,789 --> 00:09:24,210
some of those things and battle

341
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:26,759
some of those things but and then

342
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:27,000
also

343
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,330
cold dms you know on the other

344
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:29,830
side is like just mass sending it

345
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:31,480
out like basically like this guy

346
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:31,879
here

347
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:33,460
on the left this ahmed guy said

348
00:09:33,659 --> 00:09:35,379
hey do you want me to do this for

349
00:09:35,379 --> 00:09:37,080
you he's basically like getting

350
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:37,320
people

351
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,850
to raise their hand so two sides

352
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:42,470
of things but right here cold dms

353
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:45,220
versus dream 100 so cold dms

354
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:46,700
they're not personalized they're

355
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,100
mass messages there's no upfront

356
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,559
work there's barely any research

357
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,429
done they're higher volume but you

358
00:09:51,429 --> 00:09:52,970
get lower response rates and

359
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:54,600
usually if you're doing this

360
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:56,299
at volume you need uh sdrs or

361
00:09:56,379 --> 00:09:58,399
setters really monitoring those

362
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,120
dms and working people you know

363
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,899
getting quicker uh quickly leads

364
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:03,470
and stuff like that messaging

365
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:05,399
leads quickly speed the leads

366
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,149
everything with cold dms and any

367
00:10:07,179 --> 00:10:08,970
cold outreaches you know uh dream

368
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:10,909
100 is very hyper personalized

369
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,509
very individualized messages uh

370
00:10:13,509 --> 00:10:15,720
upfront work is key here deep

371
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,519
research needs to be done deep

372
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:19,049
upfront work

373
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,980
needs to be done these are lower

374
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:22,809
volume but way higher response

375
00:10:22,809 --> 00:10:24,669
rates and way warmer response

376
00:10:24,669 --> 00:10:25,159
weights by the

377
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,830
other way too not just a lot of

378
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:28,730
like very uh you know cold kind of

379
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:30,440
