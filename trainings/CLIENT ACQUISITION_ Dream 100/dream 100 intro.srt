1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,100
Alright everybody, welcome to the

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:04,219
Client Ascension Dream 100

3
00:00:04,219 --> 00:00:05,969
training modules here.

4
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:07,290
So, for those of you who don't

5
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:08,859
know me, my name is Evan Siech.

6
00:00:08,919 --> 00:00:10,390
I've used this strategy since I

7
00:00:10,589 --> 00:00:12,150
came into Client Ascension roughly

8
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,300
about six months ago

9
00:00:13,429 --> 00:00:15,710
to scale my agency pretty much

10
00:00:15,869 --> 00:00:18,699
from this fragmented, shambled,

11
00:00:18,699 --> 00:00:21,239
weird fractional CMO thing I had

12
00:00:21,329 --> 00:00:23,280
going on with a couple of small

13
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,039
clients doing around $5K to $10K a

14
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:26,539
month.

15
00:00:26,629 --> 00:00:27,920
And now I've scaled this up to

16
00:00:28,089 --> 00:00:29,859
$40K a month and we're growing and

17
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:31,030
I've signed some fantastic

18
00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:33,549
companies, one of which is Gym

19
00:00:33,549 --> 00:00:35,500
Launch and will actually go into

20
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,200
the whole deliverable and

21
00:00:37,289 --> 00:00:39,359
whole process I used to sign them.

22
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:40,829
And from there, once you get one

23
00:00:41,149 --> 00:00:42,649
big client like that, that turned

24
00:00:42,649 --> 00:00:43,740
into a bunch of other

25
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:44,329
opportunities.

26
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:45,740
Jason Wojo and Wojo Media, I work

27
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:47,500
with them as well right now.

28
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:48,880
And from there, I just dropped

29
00:00:49,229 --> 00:00:50,530
those names and pretty much have

30
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:51,850
been signing people left

31
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:53,039
and right due to that.

32
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:54,420
So, this is a fantastic strategy

33
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:54,960
to use.

34
00:00:55,049 --> 00:00:56,840
It does require some legwork, does

35
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,270
require some strategy, does

36
00:00:58,509 --> 00:01:00,399
require some time, but

37
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:02,380
trust me, it pays off in the end.

38
00:01:02,469 --> 00:01:04,120
So, right now, I'm just going to

39
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,409
go over real quick in this

40
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:07,239
introductory module what we're

41
00:01:07,349 --> 00:01:08,640
actually going to be covering in

42
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:09,420
this course.

43
00:01:09,549 --> 00:01:11,079
So, first off, we just have the

44
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,060
introduction.

45
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:13,150
So, we're going to go over what

46
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:13,939
the strategy is.

47
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:15,040
Why does it work?

48
00:01:15,129 --> 00:01:17,049
What's the difference between just

49
00:01:17,049 --> 00:01:19,430
cold DMs and Dream 100 Outreach?

50
00:01:19,989 --> 00:01:21,689
We're going to go into the actual

51
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:24,200
Dream 100 process in module two.

52
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:25,930
So, you know, overview of the

53
00:01:25,939 --> 00:01:27,510
process, how to find the right

54
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:28,739
prospects, what platforms

55
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:30,560
to use to find the right

56
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,170
prospects, and just what is a

57
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:33,989
qualified prospect in general.

58
00:01:34,189 --> 00:01:35,890
Then module three, we're going to

59
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:38,159
go into Dream 100 deliverables.

60
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:39,719
So, what type of free work should

61
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:40,500
you be doing?

62
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:42,569
Again, this strategy is, in a

63
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:44,879
nutshell, giving people free work

64
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:47,090
up front in return for their

65
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:48,769
potential business on the back

66
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,180
end.

67
00:01:49,269 --> 00:01:50,560
So, we're going to go into, again,

68
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:51,900
what kind of free work should you

69
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:52,209
do?

70
00:01:52,349 --> 00:01:53,939
How much should you actually do?

71
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,290
How much time should you spend on

72
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:56,939
your Dream 100 deliverable?

73
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:58,260
What should you send in a Dream

74
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:59,560
100 deliverable?

75
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:01,579
Then we're going to do a breakdown

76
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:03,250
in module four of how I signed Gym

77
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:03,900
Launch.

78
00:02:03,989 --> 00:02:05,920
It's going to give you a great

79
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,110
example of what a very crazy, I

80
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:10,280
guess, example of a Dream 100

81
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:11,759
deliverable is, but it's a

82
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:13,569
fantastic one and we'll dive into

83
00:02:13,569 --> 00:02:15,120
a lot of the strategies that

84
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,830
I use to sign them and break

85
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:18,610
through the noise of all the other

86
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:20,500
people and agencies, contractors,

87
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:22,210
freelancers that were reaching out

88
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,599
to them on a daily basis, why I

89
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:24,599
got the job and they

90
00:02:24,689 --> 00:02:24,840
didn't.

91
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:27,020
Then, module five, we're going to

92
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,330
go to reaching out to prospects,

93
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:28,780
right?

94
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:30,159
Made the deliverable, we know who

95
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:31,680
we're targeting, so where do I

96
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,560
contact them?

97
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:33,939
How do I reach out to these large

98
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,659
companies with tons of people?

99
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:36,860
How do I get to the owner?

100
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:38,210
How do I get to the director of

101
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:39,759
marketing, the right person to

102
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:40,780
talk to, right?

103
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:42,050
What do you say when you actually

104
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:42,939
send the free work?

105
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:45,099
In the next module, we'll go into

106
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:46,250
following up.

107
00:02:46,389 --> 00:02:47,669
So, following up is one of the

108
00:02:47,669 --> 00:02:49,090
most important things that you

109
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:50,599
could do with this strategy and

110
00:02:50,689 --> 00:02:51,879
really any outreach strategy.

111
00:02:51,969 --> 00:02:53,259
So, we're going to go over what to

112
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:54,349
say in the follow-up.

113
00:02:54,449 --> 00:02:55,740
What should your follow-up process

114
00:02:56,099 --> 00:02:56,719
actually look like?

115
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:58,110
Then, we're going to go into

116
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:00,030
common mistakes to avoid.

117
00:03:00,169 --> 00:03:01,430
There's a lot of these and I'm

118
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:02,870
going to list out every single

119
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:03,300
one.

120
00:03:03,389 --> 00:03:05,189
These are mistakes that I've made

121
00:03:05,189 --> 00:03:06,580
and I've also seen a lot of

122
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:07,949
members in Client Ascension

123
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:10,620
make and I'm going to be hoping to

124
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:12,460
help you avoid all of that

125
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,960
entirely and get through all

126
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:16,229
of that, shorten the learning

127
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:16,960
curve for you.

128
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:18,789
Then, we're going to go into some

129
00:03:18,789 --> 00:03:20,250
Dream 100 FAQs.

130
00:03:20,349 --> 00:03:21,650
So, since I did my coaching call,

131
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:23,039
which will be in this module as

132
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:24,689
well, about a month

133
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:26,120
and a half ago, I got a ton of

134
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:27,870
questions and basically, I've

135
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,189
consolidated these questions

136
00:03:29,729 --> 00:03:31,310
into just a few that are the most

137
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:32,949
impactful and the ones that you

138
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,289
need to know right now.

139
00:03:34,509 --> 00:03:35,639
So, like what channels are the

140
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:36,210
best to use?

141
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:37,629
How do you get past setters?

142
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:38,639
That's a big thing.

143
00:03:39,569 --> 00:03:40,849
Should you send emails?

144
00:03:40,949 --> 00:03:42,120
Should you send a Loom video?

145
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:43,750
What's the optimal follow-up

146
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:44,460
cadence?

147
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:46,199
Then, we're going to go into KPIs.

148
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,199
So, what targets should you

149
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,159
actually be hitting?

150
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,539
What are the inputs in your

151
00:03:49,539 --> 00:03:51,469
expected outputs of those inputs?

152
00:03:51,669 --> 00:03:52,960
And how do you factor in costs

153
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:54,370
whenever you're doing any

154
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:56,479
financial modeling or projections?

155
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:58,629
Then, I have a very fun section

156
00:03:58,629 --> 00:04:00,039
here that I love.

157
00:04:00,129 --> 00:04:02,099
The, what happens if, right?

158
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:03,710
Oh, what happens if they don't see

159
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:04,310
my free work?

160
00:04:04,409 --> 00:04:05,500
What happens if they don't like my

161
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,020
free work?

162
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:07,400
What happens if they don't consume

163
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:08,599
my free work?

164
00:04:08,689 --> 00:04:09,719
We're going to go over all of

165
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:10,969
those and I'll tell you exactly

166
00:04:11,129 --> 00:04:13,009
what to do in every single

167
00:04:13,009 --> 00:04:13,740
scenario.

168
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:15,349
So, as you're out in the field,

169
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:17,040
utilizing this strategy, making

170
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,579
free work, sending people

171
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:20,639
free stuff, you'll be able to say,

172
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:21,939
oh, they aren't seeing my free

173
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:22,560
work.

174
00:04:22,689 --> 00:04:23,970
Let me go see what I can do to get

175
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:25,430
them to actually see that free

176
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:26,360
work, right?

177
00:04:26,449 --> 00:04:27,350
Where I'm sending it to them and

178
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:28,649
they're not actually consuming or

179
00:04:28,649 --> 00:04:29,149
using it.

180
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:30,040
They're just leaving me unread.

181
00:04:30,129 --> 00:04:31,089
What do I do then?

182
00:04:31,709 --> 00:04:33,449
So, next we're going to go into

183
00:04:33,449 --> 00:04:34,939
strategies to increase your

184
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,889
overall response rates.

185
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:38,509
Then we're going to go into the

186
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,129
path to actually scaling your

187
00:04:40,129 --> 00:04:41,939
agency with Dream 100.

188
00:04:42,029 --> 00:04:43,709
And finally, I want to leave you

189
00:04:43,709 --> 00:04:45,220
with some action items.
