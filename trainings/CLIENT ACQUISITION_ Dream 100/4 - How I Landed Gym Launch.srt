1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,159
All right, everybody.

2
00:00:01,159 --> 00:00:02,720
Welcome to module four.

3
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:03,710
I'm just going to do a quick

4
00:00:03,779 --> 00:00:05,629
overview of the actual document

5
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:07,759
that got me to launch the client.

6
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:10,000
So basically, long story short, I

7
00:00:10,109 --> 00:00:11,900
had a couple of contacts that I

8
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:13,660
knew I could reach out to, to

9
00:00:13,779 --> 00:00:15,750
potentially get in contact with

10
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,640
someone from their team.

11
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:18,719
So it was a little bit far

12
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:20,140
stretched down the line, but I was

13
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:21,899
like, look, these guys need help

14
00:00:21,899 --> 00:00:22,640
with copy.

15
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,190
They need help with emails big

16
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:24,660
time.

17
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,250
They're not even running a call,

18
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:27,980
running a call funnel with a VSL.

19
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:29,170
Like there's so much value I can

20
00:00:29,269 --> 00:00:29,929
provide them.

21
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,600
And they're a huge case study

22
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:32,869
builder client for me.

23
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,780
I'm going to sit down the next two

24
00:00:34,789 --> 00:00:36,719
days, three days, and just crank

25
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,280
out a document with a ton of value

26
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,240
and a ton of plug and play assets

27
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,939
that they can take to scale their

28
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:43,000
business.

29
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,450
So what I actually put inside of

30
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:46,179
this document, and by the way,

31
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:47,500
it's 101 pages.

32
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,100
I'll link it down below.

33
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:50,090
So you guys can see the actual

34
00:00:50,299 --> 00:00:51,549
video that I use the loom video

35
00:00:51,549 --> 00:00:52,399
that I sent them.

36
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:53,899
You know, I had the about me on

37
00:00:53,899 --> 00:00:55,140
here and everything.

38
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:57,969
So what I did was I literally went

39
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,350
and made email and SMS nurture

40
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:01,890
series for them.

41
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:03,460
So I told them they can plug and

42
00:01:03,579 --> 00:01:05,299
play these into their HubSpot CRM

43
00:01:05,409 --> 00:01:06,939
to nurture and close and book

44
00:01:06,939 --> 00:01:08,579
calls with new leads that came

45
00:01:08,599 --> 00:01:10,109
through their funnel.

46
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,579
I had a seven day value-based

47
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:13,150
email newsletter that they can

48
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:14,819
literally just take again and plug

49
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:16,629
into their current CRM and just

50
00:01:16,629 --> 00:01:18,420
run with and get results with.

51
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:19,569
So again, plug and play.

52
00:01:19,569 --> 00:01:21,030
I literally have up here, plug and

53
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:22,920
play in the title, Twitter,

54
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,469
LinkedIn, and meta threads, lead

55
00:01:25,469 --> 00:01:27,579
gen, and, you know, value-based

56
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:29,560
posts that they can use for social

57
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,719
media to start, you know,

58
00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:32,870
generating a lot of leads and a

59
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:33,799
lot of traction on those

60
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:34,439
platforms.

61
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,599
Because I saw that they were

62
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:36,920
really lacking on, you know,

63
00:01:36,939 --> 00:01:38,549
content for Twitter, LinkedIn, and

64
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:39,379
meta threads.

65
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,620
VSL, again, they've never ran a

66
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:42,120
VSL.

67
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,599
So I literally was like, hey, you

68
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:44,700
guys need to run a VSL.

69
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:45,859
Like, here's a VSL script.

70
00:01:45,859 --> 00:01:46,650
Please do this.

71
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:47,329
Please film this.

72
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:48,239
And like, let's go.

73
00:01:48,269 --> 00:01:49,019
I'll even edit it.

74
00:01:49,019 --> 00:01:49,750
Let's just go.

75
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:51,409
Book a call funnel landing page.

76
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,950
I had a whole Figma template that

77
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:54,510
they can pull and run with.

78
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:56,609
Facebook group engagement ideas

79
00:01:56,609 --> 00:01:57,650
and proposed structure.

80
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:58,780
So they had a Facebook group.

81
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,030
They were working that had about

82
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:01,769
12,000 people at the time.

83
00:02:01,769 --> 00:02:02,629
They don't use it anymore.

84
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:03,939
We switched to school with them.

85
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,430
But, you know, they just weren't

86
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:06,799
getting a lot of good engagement

87
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:07,409
in that group.

88
00:02:07,569 --> 00:02:08,650
And I could see that.

89
00:02:08,659 --> 00:02:10,199
So gave them some engagement

90
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,030
ideas, some post examples, and

91
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,280
also told them some other ways

92
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,629
that they can structure the group

93
00:02:14,909 --> 00:02:17,069
to get more engagement and close

94
00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:18,620
more deals from the group.

95
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,719
Over here, I had some, like,

96
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:21,879
additional growth ideas, too.

97
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:22,960
And then some sales assets for,

98
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,240
again, growth, which were, like,

99
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:24,879
lead magnets.

100
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:27,500
So it's pretty detailed, right?

101
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:29,150
Everything here was fully plug and

102
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,090
play, right?

103
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:32,020
Like, I had some graphics in here.

104
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,830
I had, you know, an overview of

105
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:35,639
each section, some instructions

106
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:37,349
for them to take and plug and

107
00:02:37,349 --> 00:02:38,479
play, right?

108
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:39,840
So I said, hey, in the video, you

109
00:02:39,939 --> 00:02:41,340
guys can literally just, like,

110
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:42,639
take these sections and give it

111
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:43,990
off to whatever team member that

112
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:45,330
is responsible for these.

113
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:46,740
Or, again, I can help you

114
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:47,800
implement it if you don't have

115
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,599
someone for that.

116
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:50,189
But I kind of, like, was not

117
00:02:50,189 --> 00:02:52,080
really trying to pitch myself the

118
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:52,949
whole time.

119
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,229
I was like, hey, I analyzed your

120
00:02:54,289 --> 00:02:54,860
business.

121
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,419
Here are some things you can do

122
00:02:56,539 --> 00:02:58,199
and pass this off to whatever team

123
00:02:58,199 --> 00:02:58,840
member.

124
00:02:58,909 --> 00:02:59,849
So it, like, lowers their guard a

125
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:00,469
little bit more.

126
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,360
So it was a very long, long

127
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:04,719
document, right?

128
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:05,479
Had some images.

129
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:07,300
Like, I'm just showing you guys

130
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:09,169
this to show you, like, when you

131
00:03:09,169 --> 00:03:11,039
have a potential in with a company

132
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:12,689
and you really are passionate

133
00:03:12,969 --> 00:03:14,449
about helping them and you know

134
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:16,449
you can get them results, you've

135
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:17,810
got to go balls to the wall like

136
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:18,259
this.

137
00:03:18,379 --> 00:03:20,340
It works and it pays off.

138
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,439
I did this with Jason Wojo.

139
00:03:21,509 --> 00:03:22,870
I'm currently doing this with a

140
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,060
couple other clients.

141
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:24,800
I was on Wall Street.

142
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,539
I got a great rev share retainer

143
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:27,439
from them.

144
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,090
It's a base of about 5K a month

145
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,719
plus 10% rev share.

146
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:31,849
It's fantastic.

147
00:03:31,849 --> 00:03:33,810
You know, August, I made, like,

148
00:03:33,819 --> 00:03:35,580
25K from them just alone in one

149
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:36,280
wire.

150
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,430
Just because, like, I did the same

151
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:39,539
exact stuff here.

152
00:03:39,539 --> 00:03:41,099
I just went and just gave a ton of

153
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:42,629
value and showed that I can help

154
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,229
their business grow in different

155
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:44,879
areas.

156
00:03:44,939 --> 00:03:46,819
I mean, look, I even made, like,

157
00:03:46,819 --> 00:03:48,349
GIFs to plug into emails to help

158
00:03:48,509 --> 00:03:50,280
raise, you know, click rates and

159
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:50,729
stuff.

160
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,180
So there's a lot that you can

161
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:55,750
provide in these documents.

162
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:57,219
Again, this is an example of one

163
00:03:57,219 --> 00:03:58,789
that just went really, you know,

164
00:03:58,789 --> 00:04:00,419
just went, like, really hard with

165
00:04:00,419 --> 00:04:01,889
it and just kept adding stuff and

166
00:04:01,969 --> 00:04:02,729
adding stuff.

167
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:03,969
So it was 101 pages.

168
00:04:03,969 --> 00:04:04,969
You don't need to go this

169
00:04:04,969 --> 00:04:06,229
aggressive each time, but I just

170
00:04:06,389 --> 00:04:07,689
wanted to use this as an example

171
00:04:07,689 --> 00:04:09,129
case study to show you that, one,

172
00:04:09,139 --> 00:04:10,340
this strategy works.

173
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,849
Two, you know, sending someone 101

174
00:04:12,849 --> 00:04:14,669
pages of stuff will separate you

175
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,160
from everyone else that is

176
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:17,649
reaching out to them.

177
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:18,689
I promise you that.

178
00:04:18,699 --> 00:04:20,000
And it will show your worth.

179
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,829
And three, like, again, if you

180
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:23,370
have a hook or you have an in with

181
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,040
a company that you really want to

182
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,819
work with, dude, sit down for two

183
00:04:26,819 --> 00:04:28,120
to three days and just grind

184
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,610
something out like this because

185
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:30,540
it's going to pay off in the end.

186
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,149
So I'll link this in the bottom

187
00:04:32,149 --> 00:04:33,949
here so you guys can check it out,

188
00:04:33,949 --> 00:04:35,430
but let's move on to the next

189
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:36,060
model.
