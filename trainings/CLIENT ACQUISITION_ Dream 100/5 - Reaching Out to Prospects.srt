1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,379
Alright, welcome back to the

2
00:00:01,379 --> 00:00:01,899
slides.

3
00:00:01,899 --> 00:00:03,680
Module 5, we're going to talk

4
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,330
about reaching out to your

5
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:06,049
prospects now.

6
00:00:06,099 --> 00:00:07,599
So, you already did the research,

7
00:00:07,599 --> 00:00:09,089
you know the process, you know who

8
00:00:09,089 --> 00:00:10,609
you're reaching out to, you know

9
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:11,990
what you're providing them, and

10
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:13,179
how you're going to build it.

11
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:14,589
Now we're actually going to go

12
00:00:14,699 --> 00:00:16,269
into the process of reaching out

13
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:17,980
to them, getting in contact with

14
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:19,530
them, and delivering them this

15
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:20,640
actual free work.

16
00:00:20,679 --> 00:00:22,449
So first off, where do I contact

17
00:00:22,449 --> 00:00:22,910
them?

18
00:00:23,179 --> 00:00:25,719
Short answer, freaking everywhere

19
00:00:25,809 --> 00:00:27,390
you can, alright?

20
00:00:27,859 --> 00:00:29,420
Social media, email, coaching

21
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:31,260
programs, SMS, and phone calls.

22
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:32,929
Direct mail, I've even done it

23
00:00:32,929 --> 00:00:34,770
before, I've done direct mail.

24
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,109
Pay for consulting calls, this is

25
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:37,929
a pure hack.

26
00:00:38,179 --> 00:00:39,829
There are also platforms out

27
00:00:39,829 --> 00:00:42,009
there, like Manect, for example,

28
00:00:42,009 --> 00:00:44,119
Patrick Brett Davids, that you can

29
00:00:44,119 --> 00:00:45,990
literally pay someone for their

30
00:00:46,049 --> 00:00:46,679
time.

31
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:48,670
You pay them for a call.

32
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,600
You guarantee that they show up to

33
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,969
a call, that you can then give

34
00:00:53,979 --> 00:00:56,000
them the free work on.

35
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,789
It's a freaking hack, okay?

36
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:00,960
So, be resourceful.

37
00:01:01,219 --> 00:01:02,149
You've got to pay for these,

38
00:01:02,149 --> 00:01:02,560
right?

39
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,969
But you can literally just

40
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:05,959
guarantee that someone sees your

41
00:01:05,959 --> 00:01:07,930
stuff by paying them for a call.

42
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,930
It's insane.

43
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,920
One of the biggest hacks that you

44
00:01:11,219 --> 00:01:12,959
guys can get out of this entire

45
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:15,079
massive presentation module is

46
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:16,650
that, right there.

47
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:18,340
So, then get creative.

48
00:01:18,379 --> 00:01:19,480
Anyone can be contacted with

49
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,180
enough effort.

50
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:22,430
This is a fantastic book to read,

51
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:24,239
how to get a meeting with anyone.

52
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,569
I don't know how to pronounce his

53
00:01:25,569 --> 00:01:26,530
last name, but Stu.

54
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,390
Fantastic offer, great book.

55
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,079
It shows you some very creative

56
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:31,609
ways to get in contact with people

57
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:33,359
and kind of the process of really

58
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,439
reaching out to high-level people.

59
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,810
So, it's a fantastic book to read.

60
00:01:36,859 --> 00:01:38,650
So, reaching out to larger

61
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:39,659
companies.

62
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,359
A lot of you guys are working

63
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:43,510
with, you know, e-com companies

64
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:45,450
and just bigger companies that

65
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:46,920
have a lot of staff.

66
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:48,530
And the owner is not just someone

67
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,140
you can just DM on Instagram or,

68
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:51,739
you know, find their email online

69
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,209
easy and just send something to

70
00:01:53,209 --> 00:01:53,469
them.

71
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,150
So, what do you actually have to

72
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:56,200
do to reach out to larger

73
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:56,829
companies?

74
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,500
First off, think of it like cold

75
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:58,909
email.

76
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:00,890
You want to hit as many decision

77
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:02,459
makers as possible.

78
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,879
If you provide great free work

79
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:07,290
that is valuable, even people

80
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:09,538
lower on the food chain will pass

81
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:12,050
that deliverable and message along

82
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:13,710
up the chain to people that are

83
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:14,939
decision makers, right?

84
00:02:14,979 --> 00:02:16,879
They're going to feel so compelled

85
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:19,330
that like, shoot, this guy sent me

86
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,139
101 pages of work.

87
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,409
If I don't pass this along and it

88
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:25,979
gets to like my superiors, like,

89
00:02:26,169 --> 00:02:27,340
I'm screwed.

90
00:02:27,379 --> 00:02:28,300
They're going to yell at me,

91
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:28,659
right?

92
00:02:28,699 --> 00:02:29,300
That's what you want.

93
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,240
That's, again, why it goes back to

94
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,000
the point of making your stuff so

95
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,830
good and so genuine of wanting to

96
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:36,610
help out that company that it'll

97
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:38,280
make people even lower on the food

98
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:40,330
chain within that company.

99
00:02:40,789 --> 00:02:42,740
Pass it along, right?

100
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:43,900
So, don't just, you know, send a

101
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,009
funnel design, for example.

102
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,330
That's a good thing.

103
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:49,469
So, just, you know, don't send.

104
00:02:49,699 --> 00:02:51,069
When you're sending outreach

105
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,020
messages to people, understand who

106
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,509
you're sending it to in the first

107
00:02:54,699 --> 00:02:55,180
place.

108
00:02:55,219 --> 00:02:56,389
I made this mistake once.

109
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:58,289
I sent a funnel redesign to their

110
00:02:58,289 --> 00:02:59,479
funnel builder.

111
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,310
Don't know how I actually did

112
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:03,460
that, but I ended up doing it.

113
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,430
And guess where that went?

114
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:06,710
Right to the trash immediately.

115
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,729
So, just be a little bit conscious

116
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,169
of that.

117
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:11,139
Like, if you're sending someone,

118
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:12,729
you know, YouTube scripts or

119
00:03:12,729 --> 00:03:14,479
trying to be a YouTube manager for

120
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:16,039
a company, don't send stuff to

121
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:17,699
their YouTube manager.

122
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,419
That's just, you know, a common

123
00:03:19,419 --> 00:03:19,800
thing.

124
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,169
Send it to their director of

125
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:22,590
marketing or their CMO or the

126
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:24,379
owner, the CEO, the COO, something

127
00:03:24,379 --> 00:03:25,139
like that.

128
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,810
Some other decision maker besides

129
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:28,460
someone just directly in line with

130
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:29,979
what you're trying to basically

131
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:30,680
replace.

132
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,900
So, what do I say when I send the

133
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:33,169
work?

134
00:03:33,259 --> 00:03:34,900
You want to make it very tailored

135
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,270
to them and specific to the

136
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:37,969
problem you are solving for them

137
00:03:37,969 --> 00:03:39,469
and what you observed in your

138
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:40,740
research process.

139
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,580
So, don't make this part generic.

140
00:03:42,699 --> 00:03:43,979
You did all this upfront work, so

141
00:03:43,979 --> 00:03:44,740
don't blow it here.

142
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,020
So, for example, you say,

143
00:03:47,219 --> 00:03:48,389
Hey, name, I saw you've been

144
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:49,889
ramping up the content volume on

145
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:51,729
YouTube lately, which is awesome.

146
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,729
Love the recent video you did on

147
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:54,699
XYZ topic.

148
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:55,800
I noticed a few things on your

149
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,280
thumbnails, though, that can drive

150
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,610
up your click-through rate pretty

151
00:03:58,610 --> 00:03:59,020
fast.

152
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,860
Here are three thumbnails for your

153
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,189
last three videos you can swap out

154
00:04:02,189 --> 00:04:03,340
immediately that will drive

155
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,289
results and get a better

156
00:04:04,289 --> 00:04:05,379
click-through rate.

157
00:04:05,419 --> 00:04:06,120
I guarantee it.

158
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:07,530
I'll also make your next two

159
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:09,210
thumbnails completely for free

160
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:10,960
with that whole goal and objective

161
00:04:11,129 --> 00:04:12,860
of raising your click-through rate

162
00:04:12,979 --> 00:04:13,539
in mind.

163
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:14,750
I don't just make thumbnails to

164
00:04:14,849 --> 00:04:16,240
make them look pretty and cute and

165
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,490
stuff and all this nice, cool

166
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:17,920
stuff.

167
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:19,329
I raise it with results in mind

168
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:21,009
and driving your click-through

169
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,759
rate up through the freaking roof.

170
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,639
So, are you free to hop on maybe a

171
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,269
quick five-minute call so I can

172
00:04:26,269 --> 00:04:27,769
get briefed on what your next

173
00:04:27,769 --> 00:04:28,970
videos actually are

174
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:30,389
so I can start working on them

175
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,069
literally tonight, again, for

176
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:32,680
free?

177
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,310
So, that's something that I would

178
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:35,790
send in that thumbnail example.

179
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:39,500
Another example is,

180
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:40,709
Hey, name, I saw you're running

181
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:42,079
ads right now for XYZ Offer.

182
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:44,209
I studied your funnel slash offer

183
00:04:44,209 --> 00:04:45,569
and built out a full cold email

184
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,329
workflow and script for you right

185
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:48,000
here.

186
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:48,279
Link.

187
00:04:48,939 --> 00:04:50,990
Inside of this document, there are

188
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:52,310
plug-and-play scripts that you can

189
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:53,259
use as well as a full

190
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:55,449
infrastructure setup guide to help

191
00:04:55,449 --> 00:04:57,120
you get this off the ground ASAP

192
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,290
so you can start signing clients

193
00:04:58,290 --> 00:04:58,959
like Wildfire.

194
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:00,990
Just for context, it's the same

195
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,670
system that generates our clients

196
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:03,600
on average five to ten

197
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:04,819
appointments per month.

198
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,139
So, I thought this would be a

199
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,399
killer channel to develop a

200
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:08,839
four-year offer to help you get a

201
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,339
consistent flow of leads.

202
00:05:10,379 --> 00:05:11,310
I have some time today and

203
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,629
tomorrow as well where I'd love to

204
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:14,009
walk you through this whole system

205
00:05:14,009 --> 00:05:15,160
and how to implement it.

206
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,129
Again, not trying to sell you

207
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,100
anything on the back end.

208
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:17,920
No strings attached.

209
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:19,329
I'm not going to, you know, make

210
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:20,740
you read your card number out to

211
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:21,920
me on the second we get on the

212
00:05:21,939 --> 00:05:22,459
phone.

213
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,860
I just want to, yeah, I know this

214
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,170
can help you out and I really want

215
00:05:25,269 --> 00:05:26,379
to give you this value.

216
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,000
So, when would it work for you?

217
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:30,740
And don't misspell stuff like I

218
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:31,860
did in this right here.

219
00:05:31,899 --> 00:05:33,019
Check your spelling.

220
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:35,279
So, right there is kind of a quick

221
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:37,339
nutshell of module five, what to

222
00:05:37,389 --> 00:05:38,060
say to the prospects.

223
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,269
And just to recap it, right?

224
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:41,209
Don't make it complex.

225
00:05:41,339 --> 00:05:43,310
You want to make it, again, very

226
00:05:43,709 --> 00:05:45,319
specific to them, the problem

227
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,939
you're solving for them and what

228
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,350
you observe in your research

229
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:48,939
process.

230
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,600
And just don't be generic.

231
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,449
You did all this work, right?

232
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,180
So, just follow some of these

233
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:55,839
scripts and kind of templates I

234
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:57,379
have for you here and go out there

235
00:05:57,379 --> 00:05:58,730
and start sending some messages.
