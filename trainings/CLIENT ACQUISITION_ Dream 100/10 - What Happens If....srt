1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:00,660
All right.

2
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:01,520
So this is one of my favorite

3
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:02,080
modules too.

4
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:03,149
I've said this about a lot of

5
00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:03,799
them, but this

6
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:05,219
is, this is genuinely one of my

7
00:00:05,219 --> 00:00:05,919
favorite ones.

8
00:00:06,059 --> 00:00:07,290
Cause, um, as you guys are

9
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:08,140
starting out with

10
00:00:08,199 --> 00:00:09,519
this strategy, you're going to be

11
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:10,880
like, well, what happens if they

12
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,779
don't, you know, uh, read

13
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:13,439
my deliverable?

14
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:14,550
What happens if I do all this

15
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:15,179
upfront work?

16
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,500
What happens if they ghost me,

17
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:18,089
they don't like what I'm doing, et

18
00:00:18,089 --> 00:00:18,579
cetera.

19
00:00:18,579 --> 00:00:19,949
So all of this here, all those

20
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:21,179
questions and concerns

21
00:00:21,219 --> 00:00:22,660
and objections you have in your

22
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:24,320
mind to starting this strategy and

23
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,710
scaling it, we're going to break

24
00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:26,500
them in here.

25
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,109
And I'm going to show you exactly

26
00:00:28,219 --> 00:00:29,829
what to do if something happens,

27
00:00:29,829 --> 00:00:30,649
uh, and how to

28
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:32,390
break past it basically.

29
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:34,570
So first off, what happens if they

30
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:36,539
don't like slash C slash consume

31
00:00:36,649 --> 00:00:37,000
my free

32
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:37,539
work?

33
00:00:37,539 --> 00:00:39,369
So they don't see it follow up

34
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,600
forever, try new channels and get

35
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,240
creative with your outreach.

36
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,179
Read that book, right?

37
00:00:44,179 --> 00:00:45,259
Get very creative with how you

38
00:00:45,259 --> 00:00:46,380
outreach to these people.

39
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:47,920
They don't like it.

40
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,119
They say, I don't like the stuff

41
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:49,780
that you sent me.

42
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:50,719
It's not useful to me.

43
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:51,479
Don't like it.

44
00:00:51,479 --> 00:00:52,600
Take the

45
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:53,950
feedback and improve adjusted for

46
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:54,539
them as well.

47
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:55,649
So say, Hey, no worries.

48
00:00:55,649 --> 00:00:56,539
Uh, can we have a quick

49
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:57,570
five minute call to see like

50
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:58,820
exactly what you want me to change

51
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,009
with this thumbnail and kind of

52
00:01:00,009 --> 00:01:00,159
like

53
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,310
how to stick with your brand

54
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:01,969
guidelines?

55
00:01:01,969 --> 00:01:03,460
Cause I'd still love to, you know,

56
00:01:03,469 --> 00:01:04,640
I already have it 95%

57
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,280
of the way done.

58
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,250
I still want to give you that

59
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:07,510
value and help you, uh, raise your

60
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:08,379
click-through rates

61
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:09,719
with this thumbnail.

62
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:11,659
So take the feedback, improve and

63
00:01:11,659 --> 00:01:12,909
adjust it for them.

64
00:01:12,909 --> 00:01:14,859
They don't need it.

65
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:15,209
They say,

66
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:16,890
I don't, I just don't need this.

67
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:18,439
That comes down to your research

68
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:19,010
process.

69
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:19,980
So you're reaching out to

70
00:01:20,019 --> 00:01:21,069
the wrong people.

71
00:01:21,069 --> 00:01:22,790
Again, you're not doing enough

72
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:24,599
research to judge beforehand,

73
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:25,500
before you make this

74
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:26,590
deliverable to see if they

75
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:27,620
actually need it or not.

76
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:28,870
You're not, you're not judging

77
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:29,680
that properly.

78
00:01:29,719 --> 00:01:31,799
So refine your research process.

79
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:33,739
You keep getting left on read,

80
00:01:33,739 --> 00:01:35,560
follow up and provide them even

81
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:35,900
more

82
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:36,569
work.

83
00:01:36,569 --> 00:01:38,750
Again, if it is worth it to you,

84
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:40,790
you have a low take rate on your

85
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:42,700
deliverable means that many,

86
00:01:42,739 --> 00:01:44,099
that basically just means people

87
00:01:44,099 --> 00:01:45,250
aren't actually taking and

88
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:46,299
consuming and using your

89
00:01:46,299 --> 00:01:47,040
deliverable.

90
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,500
you're not giving enough value.

91
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,019
You're giving the wrong thing to

92
00:01:51,019 --> 00:01:52,620
the wrong ICP and you're just

93
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:52,739
being

94
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:53,299
too pitchy.

95
00:01:53,299 --> 00:01:54,180
That's really it.

96
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,450
So another thing too, is if, you

97
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:00,519
know, you make something for

98
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:00,780
somebody

99
00:02:00,819 --> 00:02:02,230
and they just ghost you, they just

100
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:02,900
don't want it.

101
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,379
You can also, again, just post it

102
00:02:04,379 --> 00:02:05,379
as content, like

103
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:07,780
on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram,

104
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:10,139
YouTube, whatever saying, I made X

105
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:11,259
for person slash company

106
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,169
and kind of authority hack them

107
00:02:13,169 --> 00:02:14,569
for some reach and showcase that

108
00:02:14,569 --> 00:02:16,080
deliverable in your skill set.

109
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:18,849
So now got a couple more modules.

110
00:02:18,849 --> 00:02:20,300
We're going to go to module 11,

111
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,319
increasing your response rate.
