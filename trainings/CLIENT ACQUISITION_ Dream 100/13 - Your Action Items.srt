1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:00,620
All right.

2
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:01,800
Final module here, guys.

3
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:03,020
Your action items.

4
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:05,200
So congrats on making it through

5
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:05,469
this

6
00:00:05,719 --> 00:00:06,160
entire training.

7
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:07,080
Now let's show you what you

8
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:08,039
actually need to do to start

9
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:09,199
scaling step by

10
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:09,580
step.

11
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:11,009
So first, carve out two to three

12
00:00:11,009 --> 00:00:12,509
hours of your day initially, if

13
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:13,660
not more, if you can,

14
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:15,169
especially if you're newer, got to

15
00:00:15,169 --> 00:00:16,429
crank those numbers up for the

16
00:00:16,429 --> 00:00:17,379
next 90 days.

17
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:19,359
Follow the strategy, everything in

18
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:19,920
here.

19
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:20,719
Make money.

20
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:21,420
All right.

21
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:22,839
Start sending stuff.

22
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:23,210
You just

23
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,379
got to freaking start.

24
00:00:24,379 --> 00:00:25,309
That's really it.

25
00:00:25,469 --> 00:00:26,780
Ask me any questions in Slack.

26
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:27,280
I got you.

27
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:28,079
Shoot me a DM.

28
00:00:28,179 --> 00:00:29,589
It's just Evan, see it in Slack.

29
00:00:29,589 --> 00:00:30,440
I'll help you out.

30
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,589
But action steps are pretty

31
00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:32,399
simple, right?

32
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:34,090
Carve out time out of your day.

33
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:35,469
Start sending messages.

34
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,219
Start making deliverables.

35
00:00:37,219 --> 00:00:37,859
Start doing

36
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,289
the research and reach out.

37
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:40,140
Ask questions.

38
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:41,479
There's a lot of people in the

39
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:42,719
community doing this.

40
00:00:42,759 --> 00:00:43,799
I've done it a lot.

41
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:45,600
So you can ask me, lean on me, and

42
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,229
I got you.

43
00:00:46,229 --> 00:00:47,939
So let's start making some money

44
00:00:47,979 --> 00:00:48,899
with your 100.

45
00:00:48,929 --> 00:00:50,060
I appreciate your time going

46
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:51,310
through this entire module.

47
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:52,520
I've had a great time with you

48
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:52,899
guys.

49
00:00:52,899 --> 00:00:54,329
Again, let's start cooking and

50
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:55,380
making some money.

51
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:55,899
Peace.
