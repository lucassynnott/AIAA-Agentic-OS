1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:03,569
I brought a song out cavalier by

2
00:00:03,609 --> 00:00:07,120
juice world it's really good uh

3
00:00:07,509 --> 00:00:09,400
they just launched this new album

4
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:10,849
very well if whenever you guys are

5
00:00:10,849 --> 00:00:12,300
watching this some of you might be

6
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:13,140
watching this like

7
00:00:13,269 --> 00:00:14,560
two years down the line uh it's

8
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:15,910
still a great song cavalier by

9
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:17,500
juice world listen to it anyways

10
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:19,870
before we keep continuing i want

11
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:22,230
to show you guys uh some mistakes

12
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:23,960
to avoid when you're running

13
00:00:24,089 --> 00:00:26,100
this dream 100 process in the

14
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,980
stream 100 campaign so module

15
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,219
seven mistakes to avoid let's dive

16
00:00:30,219 --> 00:00:30,699
in so

17
00:00:30,769 --> 00:00:31,929
mistakes to avoid big red exits

18
00:00:31,929 --> 00:00:33,289
don't do these things okay they're

19
00:00:33,289 --> 00:00:34,479
going to cost you time and money

20
00:00:34,609 --> 00:00:36,640
and bring a lot of frustration

21
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,609
with them so adding too much

22
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,000
explainer stuff at the start of

23
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:41,439
your

24
00:00:41,509 --> 00:00:43,109
document trying to convince them

25
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:44,320
why they should use your

26
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,880
deliverable just focus on what

27
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:46,390
they're

28
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:47,899
missing out on by not using the

29
00:00:47,899 --> 00:00:49,590
thing that you're providing them

30
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:51,229
with or not using it to the right

31
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:53,270
degree or you know the right

32
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:55,560
quality and you know show what

33
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:58,020
they stand to benefit from using

34
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:58,149
your

35
00:00:58,229 --> 00:00:59,960
deliverable as quickly as possible

36
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,579
okay so i've had some people send

37
00:01:01,579 --> 00:01:03,140
me in the group some dream 100

38
00:01:03,549 --> 00:01:06,099
deliverable documents and it's

39
00:01:06,099 --> 00:01:09,280
like 40 pages of stuff but 30 of

40
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,319
the pages are just explaining

41
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:14,390
their process and why they should

42
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:16,780
use the strategy and like you know

43
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:19,359
very complex terms high level

44
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:19,640
stuff

45
00:01:19,909 --> 00:01:21,409
like think if you're sending this

46
00:01:21,409 --> 00:01:22,750
to patrick ben david he's not

47
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:24,260
going to read that like he just

48
00:01:24,329 --> 00:01:25,400
wants to know what you gave him

49
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,579
that's it and what it's going to

50
00:01:26,579 --> 00:01:27,739
do for him that's that's the

51
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:29,209
dude's busy so think like you're

52
00:01:29,209 --> 00:01:30,799
reaching out to someone high level

53
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,120
like that every time you make

54
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:33,609
these documents you want to just

55
00:01:33,609 --> 00:01:35,159
give them value so if there's text

56
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:36,420
on that page every single

57
00:01:36,489 --> 00:01:38,359
you know freaking character every

58
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:40,019
word needs to earn its place it

59
00:01:40,019 --> 00:01:41,469
has to have a purpose and some

60
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:41,920
value

61
00:01:41,989 --> 00:01:43,980
on that entire page so don't just

62
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:46,120
add a bunch of fluff and explainer

63
00:01:46,219 --> 00:01:47,680
stuff and everything that

64
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:48,870
could just be copied and pasted

65
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:50,060
over from document to document

66
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:51,459
deliverable deliverable because it

67
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:51,959
shows

68
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:53,819
another thing is not doing enough

69
00:01:53,819 --> 00:01:55,530
research to see if the prospect

70
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:57,280
actually needs your deliverable or

71
00:01:57,349 --> 00:01:58,670
not again this just burns your

72
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:00,060
time going back to the youtube

73
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,640
example we talked about earlier

74
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,159
if you're only reaching out to

75
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:04,840
youtubers that have everything

76
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,569
dialed in and trying to give them

77
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:08,060
you know editing services and

78
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:09,699
scripting services they're just

79
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:10,919
going to probably ignore you

80
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:11,020
because

81
00:02:11,129 --> 00:02:11,949
they already have everything

82
00:02:11,949 --> 00:02:13,550
dialed in so see if the prospect

83
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,240
actually needs what you're

84
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:15,500
providing

85
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:16,599
them sometimes they don't

86
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:18,050
sometimes they just flat out don't

87
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:19,490
especially with cold email right

88
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:19,860
some

89
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:21,819
industries just don't work with

90
00:02:21,819 --> 00:02:23,639
cold email so don't reach out to

91
00:02:24,129 --> 00:02:25,659
you know companies that are

92
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:26,780
selling low ticket products or

93
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:27,939
something like that try to pitch

94
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:29,030
them on cold email services

95
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:29,280
because

96
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:30,699
it won't work okay so this just

97
00:02:30,699 --> 00:02:32,009
burns your time if you don't

98
00:02:32,009 --> 00:02:32,699
follow this

99
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:36,150
not following up enough again big

100
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:38,860
one flat out uh i do a minimum of

101
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:41,840
10 follow-ups minimum before i

102
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,039
move

103
00:02:42,099 --> 00:02:43,240
on uh and even then i'll still

104
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,490
just keep going until someone

105
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:45,800
tells me to screw off or they both

106
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,110
call

107
00:02:46,189 --> 00:02:48,009
really like that uh and again this

108
00:02:48,009 --> 00:02:49,740
goes back to you understanding

109
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,840
that you're providing someone with

110
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,460
a ton

111
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:54,469
of immense value if you know you

112
00:02:54,469 --> 00:02:56,479
provided them with a shit ton of

113
00:02:56,729 --> 00:02:58,159
value that they can pull

114
00:02:58,229 --> 00:03:00,050
problem immediately and make money

115
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:01,800
with why would you not keep trying

116
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,069
to follow up with them and get

117
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,460
this in their hands you're doing

118
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:05,780
them a disservice at that point

119
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:08,039
not doing it so uh another mistake

120
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:09,789
is making the deliverable document

121
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:11,319
too long and too confusing so what

122
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:12,680
i like to do is condense that

123
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,669
and i add a video explainer inside

124
00:03:14,669 --> 00:03:16,639
and then making the implementation

125
00:03:16,949 --> 00:03:18,740
of your deliverable seem too

126
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:20,349
costly too confusing too time

127
00:03:20,349 --> 00:03:21,830
consuming and just flat out

128
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:23,789
annoying so those are the quick

129
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,189
mistakes to

130
00:03:25,409 --> 00:03:26,800
avoid now we're going to go into

131
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,979
some common faqs that i get from a

132
00:03:28,979 --> 00:03:30,319
lot of people in the community

133
00:03:30,449 --> 00:03:32,780
about this strategy so see you

134
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:33,500
over there
