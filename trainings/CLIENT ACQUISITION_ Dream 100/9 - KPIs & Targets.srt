1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,020
All right.

2
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:03,560
Module nine, KPIs and targets.

3
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:04,629
Let's dive in.

4
00:00:04,969 --> 00:00:08,019
So setting your own KPIs and

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:08,330
targets.

6
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:10,240
So you need to have output targets

7
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:11,910
and performance KPIs.

8
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:14,119
So I don't really, you know, I

9
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:14,919
really like

10
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,390
to focus on more of the output

11
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:17,929
target side of things and then

12
00:00:17,929 --> 00:00:19,559
kind of have my performance APIs

13
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:21,230
as a barometer to keep me on track

14
00:00:21,329 --> 00:00:22,690
to say, okay, are my messaging, is

15
00:00:22,809 --> 00:00:23,550
my messaging good?

16
00:00:23,739 --> 00:00:25,609
Is, am I reaching out to the right

17
00:00:25,929 --> 00:00:26,260
ICP?

18
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:28,280
Like if my outputs aren't really

19
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,760
performing that well,

20
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:32,130
what do I basically like need to

21
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:34,520
adjust based on the actual KPIs to

22
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,780
get a better result from this

23
00:00:36,829 --> 00:00:37,630
campaign?

24
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:39,009
So output targets.

25
00:00:39,009 --> 00:00:40,909
I like to set a target per day of

26
00:00:40,909 --> 00:00:42,380
one to two to start.

27
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:42,820
That was,

28
00:00:42,859 --> 00:00:43,850
that was my start one, one to two

29
00:00:44,259 --> 00:00:45,109
deliverables that I send out per

30
00:00:45,109 --> 00:00:45,439
day.

31
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:48,130
I set target pieces of content

32
00:00:48,179 --> 00:00:49,939
that I want to make showcasing the

33
00:00:49,939 --> 00:00:51,219
deliverable as well.

34
00:00:51,219 --> 00:00:52,770
So that's a big thing to do is if

35
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:53,140
I just

36
00:00:53,179 --> 00:00:55,060
redesigned a landing page for

37
00:00:55,369 --> 00:00:57,810
somebody, I want to set, you know,

38
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,140
a target of one real or YouTube

39
00:01:01,179 --> 00:01:02,619
video or Twitter post a day of me

40
00:01:02,619 --> 00:01:04,219
showcasing that deliverable.

41
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:06,129
Like, Hey, I redesigned this page

42
00:01:06,129 --> 00:01:06,599
for

43
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,379
Alex or Mosey, check it on out,

44
00:01:08,379 --> 00:01:08,920
right?

45
00:01:08,989 --> 00:01:11,170
That's another way to sign people.

46
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:13,079
And then also set a

47
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,120
target amount of follow-ups per

48
00:01:14,299 --> 00:01:15,159
day that you want to do.

49
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:16,340
So those are the output targets I

50
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:16,709
set.

51
00:01:17,849 --> 00:01:18,810
Performance KPIs.

52
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:20,359
These are mine that I like to do.

53
00:01:20,359 --> 00:01:21,920
I've done a lot of dream 100

54
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,540
outreaches and

55
00:01:23,579 --> 00:01:25,319
these are just what I like to

56
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:26,090
focus on.

57
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:28,719
So 40% response rate, 30% book

58
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:31,760
call rate, 50% consumed

59
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:33,659
deliverable rate and a 10% close

60
00:01:33,989 --> 00:01:35,209
rate is what I go off of.

61
00:01:35,209 --> 00:01:37,200
Now the close rate is super low.

62
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:37,620
Okay.

63
00:01:37,719 --> 00:01:38,299
Mine has

64
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,609
been up near 30% with this thing.

65
00:01:40,689 --> 00:01:42,459
It's really freaking good.

66
00:01:42,459 --> 00:01:44,030
This is just bare moans.

67
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:45,530
Like, you know,

68
00:01:45,579 --> 00:01:47,049
if you're like getting below a 10%

69
00:01:47,049 --> 00:01:48,349
close rate on this, I mean, you're

70
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:49,780
just doing something really,

71
00:01:49,819 --> 00:01:50,739
really bad.

72
00:01:50,739 --> 00:01:51,299
Okay.

73
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:53,409
So like, yeah, this is a, these

74
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:55,780
are just like bare bones ones that

75
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:56,540
you need to just

76
00:01:56,579 --> 00:01:57,379
like shoot for.

77
00:01:57,379 --> 00:01:58,840
You can easily blow these out of

78
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,170
the water, but I'm just telling

79
00:02:00,489 --> 00:02:00,620
you,

80
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:02,069
these are kind of like my targets

81
00:02:02,069 --> 00:02:03,200
that I had initially.

82
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:05,099
So another thing you want to do

83
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:07,750
with dream 100 is factoring in the

84
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:08,590
cost of it.

85
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:09,810
So treating this like

86
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:10,960
any other acquisition channel, so

87
00:02:11,069 --> 00:02:12,000
you could scale it properly.

88
00:02:13,539 --> 00:02:15,139
So you want to think of, okay, how

89
00:02:15,139 --> 00:02:16,680
much does it actually cost me in a

90
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:17,520
hard cost

91
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,199
to produce and deliver one unit,

92
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:21,539
one deliverable?

93
00:02:21,539 --> 00:02:21,900
Okay.

94
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,599
So what like staff do I have to

95
00:02:23,849 --> 00:02:24,280
pay for to

96
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,229
help me with?

97
00:02:25,229 --> 00:02:27,039
Um, what platforms do I have to

98
00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:28,909
pay to schedule that consulting

99
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:29,740
call?

100
00:02:30,169 --> 00:02:31,039
Uh, stuff like

101
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:31,490
that.

102
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:32,020
Right.

103
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,800
And then you want to add the cost

104
00:02:33,949 --> 00:02:35,939
of your time to deliver one unit.

105
00:02:36,009 --> 00:02:37,099
So if your time is

106
00:02:37,139 --> 00:02:39,409
valued at $70 an hour, add that in

107
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:41,430
there, that's going to be your,

108
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:43,180
uh, your cash, your customer

109
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,199
acquisition cost.

110
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:44,680
Okay.

111
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,930
So math is fun, right?

112
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:47,500
So you can actually back in your

113
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,379
customer acquisition

114
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:50,280
costs by using this formula right

115
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:52,030
here and to see, okay, every

116
00:02:52,349 --> 00:02:54,460
single time, you know, it costs me

117
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:57,000
$500 to, uh, acquire client.

118
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,050
Now you can actually predictably

119
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:00,479
scale this system.

120
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,240
So quick one for module nine,

121
00:03:03,389 --> 00:03:06,060
module 10, we're going to go into

122
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:06,699
a very fun one.

123
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:07,460
And it's the

124
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,729
what happens if, what happens if

125
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:09,659
they don't do this?

126
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:10,509
They don't love me.

127
00:03:10,509 --> 00:03:11,539
They don't like me,

128
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:12,120
et cetera.

129
00:03:12,219 --> 00:03:13,449
We're going to cover all that.

130
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:14,620
Well, let's dive in.
