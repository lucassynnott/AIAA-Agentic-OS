1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:00,650
All right.

2
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:02,589
Module six is the follow-up

3
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:03,500
process.

4
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:04,799
The money is in the follow-up.

5
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:05,099
You guys have

6
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:06,230
probably heard this all the time,

7
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:07,280
but it truly is, especially with

8
00:00:07,389 --> 00:00:08,000
this strategy.

9
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:08,820
If you're not

10
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:10,000
following up with prospects, you

11
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,080
don't have a dialed in follow-up

12
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:11,410
process.

13
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:12,560
You're just letting

14
00:00:12,869 --> 00:00:14,390
money fall through the cracks and

15
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:16,100
you just basically hate making

16
00:00:16,179 --> 00:00:16,949
more money.

17
00:00:17,089 --> 00:00:17,660
So let's dive

18
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:18,050
in.

19
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:19,559
So again, the money is in the

20
00:00:19,969 --> 00:00:20,769
follow-up process.

21
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:22,519
Set up a right now, pause this

22
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:23,019
video,

23
00:00:23,109 --> 00:00:25,510
by the way, pause this right now,

24
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:27,660
go to Trello.com or Asana,

25
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,179
whatever platform you use for

26
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:31,219
tasks and

27
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:33,619
reminders and project management,

28
00:00:33,619 --> 00:00:35,149
set up a Kanban board.

29
00:00:35,149 --> 00:00:37,310
And basically this will be used to

30
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:37,780
track

31
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:40,280
follow-up set reminders, show your

32
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,140
pipeline.

33
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:42,880
So basically I have on mine

34
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,479
prospects that I want

35
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:45,380
to reach out to.

36
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:46,939
I have initial message sent.

37
00:00:46,939 --> 00:00:48,560
So that's the first deliverable

38
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:48,869
sent.

39
00:00:49,009 --> 00:00:49,500
Then I have

40
00:00:49,789 --> 00:00:50,789
follow-up one, follow-up two,

41
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:52,250
follow-up three, follow-up four,

42
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:53,880
follow-up five, follow-up six,

43
00:00:54,189 --> 00:00:56,000
follow-up seven, follow-up eight,

44
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:58,179
follow-up nine, follow-up 10.

45
00:00:58,179 --> 00:01:00,259
All is separate modules or sorry,

46
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:02,429
separate columns that I drag a

47
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:04,519
card through and I'll set task

48
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:05,540
reminders.

49
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:06,780
So I'll say, all right,

50
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:08,500
if someone's in the stage, you

51
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,409
know, the follow-up two column,

52
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:12,239
I'll set a reminder for two days

53
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:12,519
later

54
00:01:12,609 --> 00:01:14,349
to basically say, Hey, they're in

55
00:01:14,769 --> 00:01:15,329
follow-up two.

56
00:01:15,329 --> 00:01:16,909
You got to move them to follow-up

57
00:01:17,049 --> 00:01:17,590
three,

58
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:18,560
meaning you got to send them a

59
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,799
freaking follow-up message today,

60
00:01:19,849 --> 00:01:20,189
my friend.

61
00:01:20,349 --> 00:01:22,359
So Kanban boards are

62
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:23,000
fantastic.

63
00:01:23,079 --> 00:01:24,640
They look like this to just move

64
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,319
people along those stages in your

65
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:27,680
dream 100 campaign

66
00:01:27,969 --> 00:01:28,090
process.

67
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:28,930
And just make sure you're

68
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:30,040
consistently following up with

69
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,230
people, especially when you're

70
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:32,239
reaching out to, you know, a

71
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:33,109
hundred people, right?

72
00:01:33,109 --> 00:01:33,849
It's a lot of people.

73
00:01:33,849 --> 00:01:35,040
You got to really keep track

74
00:01:35,129 --> 00:01:36,239
of who you're reaching out to,

75
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:37,500
when you need to reach out to them

76
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:38,819
and who you've already reached

77
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:40,109
out to in the past, who you book

78
00:01:40,109 --> 00:01:41,280
calls with, et cetera.

79
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,879
So what do you say in the

80
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:43,920
follow-ups?

81
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:46,450
I keep it simple, right?

82
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:47,790
So Hey name, just want to make

83
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:48,840
sure you got that.

84
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,959
If you need help with

85
00:01:50,269 --> 00:01:51,370
implementing it, I have time today

86
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:51,790
to chat.

87
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:52,859
Here's my number as well.

88
00:01:52,859 --> 00:01:54,319
I literally give my number a lot

89
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:55,189
in these follow-up messages

90
00:01:55,189 --> 00:01:55,819
because it's easy.

91
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:56,900
You'd be surprised how many people

92
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:57,560
just hit the phone

93
00:01:57,769 --> 00:01:59,609
and call you and be like, yo, it's

94
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:00,150
insane.

95
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:02,180
Hey name, just bumping this.

96
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,920
I know you guys are losing out

97
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:05,439
on result, like views, for

98
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,049
example, if you're, you know,

99
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:08,800
making thumbnails for people.

100
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,120
So let me know

101
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:12,439
if you need some help, uh, giving

102
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:13,169
these up.

103
00:02:13,289 --> 00:02:15,319
Hey name is end result, still a

104
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:16,680
priority for me.

105
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:19,080
Hey name, I added that document.

106
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,000
I added more to that document

107
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,639
above.

108
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:23,039
I added some more additional

109
00:02:23,409 --> 00:02:24,599
information to that document above

110
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:25,689
that will help you on out.

111
00:02:25,849 --> 00:02:26,819
So this is something I use

112
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:27,800
strategically.

113
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,389
If I've maybe got someone that is,

114
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:33,460
uh, you know, they follow me, they

115
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:35,120
read a couple of my other

116
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,210
follow-up messages.

117
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:37,710
They looked at the loom video that

118
00:02:37,789 --> 00:02:38,889
I sent them initially.

119
00:02:38,889 --> 00:02:39,719
They looked at the

120
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:41,009
deliverable document.

121
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:42,310
I sent them initially.

122
00:02:42,449 --> 00:02:44,060
I will basically frame it like,

123
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:45,460
yo, I added some more

124
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:46,960
stuff to this document that is

125
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,050
going to help you out.

126
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,710
So it creates that intrigue and

127
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:50,560
they're like,

128
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:51,099
Hmm.

129
00:02:51,099 --> 00:02:52,169
What did he add?

130
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,250
Interesting.

131
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:55,050
I need to check it out now.

132
00:02:55,189 --> 00:02:56,919
So that's a great one to use

133
00:02:57,139 --> 00:02:58,210
down the sequence some more in

134
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,509
your follow-up process.

135
00:02:59,669 --> 00:03:02,610
And then always be spotting, uh,

136
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:02,770
where

137
00:03:02,979 --> 00:03:04,599
you can add value with anyone.

138
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:06,469
This is kind of a funny slide, but

139
00:03:06,469 --> 00:03:08,819
like, uh, these they'll definitely

140
00:03:09,129 --> 00:03:10,680
load on the one for you, but

141
00:03:11,069 --> 00:03:13,199
basically it's me harassing Daniel

142
00:03:13,349 --> 00:03:15,300
Christian and Andre, uh,

143
00:03:15,349 --> 00:03:15,830
repeatedly

144
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,710
with different deliverables until

145
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:20,030
they basically decided to, to work

146
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:21,379
with me and also, you know,

147
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:23,139
gave me an opportunity to do stuff

148
00:03:23,139 --> 00:03:25,240
like, like this year, uh, for the

149
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:25,979
strategy.

150
00:03:25,979 --> 00:03:27,840
So, uh, just be very

151
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:29,289
mindful of where you can provide

152
00:03:29,289 --> 00:03:30,780
value within an organization on a

153
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,219
recurring basis and a frequent

154
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:32,689
basis.

155
00:03:32,689 --> 00:03:33,990
So you can just keep providing

156
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:35,229
them with stuff, right?

157
00:03:35,229 --> 00:03:36,860
So like the one that's showing up

158
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:37,020
over

159
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:38,900
here is kind of my initial one

160
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:41,379
that I just randomly sent them a

161
00:03:41,379 --> 00:03:43,969
bunch of landing page designs that

162
00:03:43,969 --> 00:03:44,259
I made

163
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:45,550
that I did for a lead magnet once.

164
00:03:45,569 --> 00:03:48,849
So, uh, even though you ultimately

165
00:03:48,849 --> 00:03:51,180
want to make money, you have

166
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:52,939
to come from a position of genuine

167
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:54,189
value and care.

168
00:03:54,189 --> 00:03:56,080
If not, you're going to come off

169
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,020
salesy and you're

170
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,039
going to come off needy to the

171
00:03:58,039 --> 00:03:59,289
prospect and they're just going to

172
00:03:59,289 --> 00:04:00,900
completely ignore you and then

173
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:01,289
just

174
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:03,349
lump you into those weird, cool DM

175
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:04,340
guys, right?

176
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:06,389
Also accept that sometimes bigger

177
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:07,580
prospects may have

178
00:04:07,889 --> 00:04:08,979
something else more pressing.

179
00:04:08,979 --> 00:04:10,169
You can get your foot in the door

180
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:11,960
with and then sell them on your

181
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:12,300
core

182
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:13,490
services afterwards.

183
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,189
So for example, with gym launch, I

184
00:04:15,189 --> 00:04:16,639
initially signed them onto a

185
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:17,000
copywriting

186
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:18,100
agreement, right?

187
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,589
I didn't just go right for funnels

188
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,120
and ads and media buying, you

189
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,720
know, I started out

190
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:23,949
as copywriter with them for the

191
00:04:23,949 --> 00:04:24,990
first, like two weeks.

192
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:26,399
And then they were like, shit, you

193
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:26,839
know,

194
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:28,339
you're doing a lot of other areas.

195
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:29,850
So like, let's, uh, let's move

196
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:31,420
away from that, you know, keep

197
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:31,759
writing

198
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,259
some copy for us, but let's like,

199
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:34,810
you know, get you on some other

200
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:35,250
stuff.

201
00:04:35,269 --> 00:04:36,420
So I saw they desperately

202
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:38,250
needed copywriting immediately and

203
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:38,959
knew that.

204
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:40,519
And I knew I could help them with

205
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:41,040
that.

206
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:41,490
So I went

207
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,240
all in on that first and really

208
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,449
got my foot in the door that way.

209
00:04:45,449 --> 00:04:47,959
So just understand these bigger

210
00:04:48,269 --> 00:04:49,139
companies or just companies in

211
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:50,310
general, if you see something

212
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:51,470
that's more pressing, that's

213
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,149
within your

214
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:54,329
field of, of services, you can

215
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:56,420
kind of step out that boundary a

216
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:58,699
little bit and provide them with

217
00:04:58,990 --> 00:04:59,199
that.

218
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,199
Cause obviously like in my case,

219
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,310
copywriting, for example, like

220
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:06,079
building funnels, uh, you know,

221
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:07,589
media buying, running ads for

222
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,620
people, it's all copywriting still

223
00:05:09,699 --> 00:05:11,019
at the end of the day.

224
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:11,399
Right.

225
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:12,910
So I still had that skillset.

226
00:05:13,009 --> 00:05:14,449
I didn't just reach for it.

227
00:05:14,569 --> 00:05:16,139
I still had that skillset.

228
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:17,089
So I provided

229
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,389
them with a bunch of work around

230
00:05:18,389 --> 00:05:19,689
that, a bunch of deliverables

231
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:21,970
around copywriting, got my foot in

232
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:22,060
the

233
00:05:22,149 --> 00:05:22,279
door.

234
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:23,170
Cause they're like, dang, this

235
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:23,889
guy's a good copywriter.

236
00:05:23,889 --> 00:05:24,649
And then once my foot's in the

237
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:24,879
door,

238
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:26,040
they're like, Oh wait, you can do

239
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:26,740
a lot of other stuff.

240
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:27,399
This is crazy.

241
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:28,420
So again,

242
00:05:28,699 --> 00:05:29,750
once I was in the organization

243
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,089
still, and I had a contract, I was

244
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:32,680
still giving them a ton of value

245
00:05:32,769 --> 00:05:33,579
on other things.

246
00:05:33,579 --> 00:05:35,129
So I'm always a guy that's sitting

247
00:05:35,129 --> 00:05:36,579
there thinking, how can I make

248
00:05:36,579 --> 00:05:37,699
someone else's life

249
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,149
better?

250
00:05:38,149 --> 00:05:39,350
How can I make someone else's

251
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:40,550
business better and get them

252
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:41,360
better results?

253
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,339
So now we're

254
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:44,459
going to go into one of my

255
00:05:44,459 --> 00:05:45,930
favorite modules, module seven

256
00:05:46,089 --> 00:05:48,000
mistakes to avoid with dream 100.
