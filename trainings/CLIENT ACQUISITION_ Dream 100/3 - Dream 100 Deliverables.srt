1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,750
All right, so on this one, I don't

2
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:03,879
necessarily have an intro song for

3
00:00:03,879 --> 00:00:04,700
you because I couldn't

4
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,179
figure out one, but I'm going to

5
00:00:06,179 --> 00:00:07,599
figure out some other ones, keep

6
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:08,660
you pepped up, keep

7
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:10,439
you rocking through these modules

8
00:00:10,439 --> 00:00:12,169
here in the future ones, but we're

9
00:00:12,289 --> 00:00:13,000
on module three,

10
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:14,789
so listen up because this is one

11
00:00:14,859 --> 00:00:16,800
of the most important modules of

12
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,179
this entire course is

13
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:19,929
going over your Dream 100

14
00:00:19,929 --> 00:00:21,609
deliverables, so what you're

15
00:00:21,789 --> 00:00:22,879
actually going to send the

16
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:23,589
prospect

17
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,679
during your Dream 100 campaigns,

18
00:00:25,719 --> 00:00:26,140
okay?

19
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,530
I get this question all the time,

20
00:00:28,589 --> 00:00:29,800
what should I do for free work,

21
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:30,460
what should I actually

22
00:00:30,789 --> 00:00:32,250
send somebody with my Dream 100

23
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:33,200
outreach strategy?

24
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,590
This comes down to your research

25
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:37,119
entirely, okay?

26
00:00:37,159 --> 00:00:39,229
So remember, you are doing custom

27
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:41,020
free upfront work for people to

28
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:42,939
prove that you can actually

29
00:00:43,219 --> 00:00:45,210
provide them value and that you

30
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:47,640
are a subject matter expert in the

31
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:48,880
actual topic and offer

32
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:51,189
that you're trying to pitch them

33
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:53,000
on and you know what you're doing

34
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:54,359
to help their business

35
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:56,109
grow in whatever area you're an

36
00:00:56,109 --> 00:00:57,320
expert in, okay?

37
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,679
That's essentially what you're

38
00:00:58,679 --> 00:00:59,109
doing.

39
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:00,880
You're saying, hey, I'm showing

40
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,310
you that I can do the job well and

41
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:03,820
I can grow your business

42
00:01:03,859 --> 00:01:06,129
in this specific area and here is

43
00:01:06,129 --> 00:01:08,150
proof of that by sending them

44
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:10,439
stuff for free upfront that

45
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,340
they can get results with

46
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:11,980
immediately.

47
00:01:12,019 --> 00:01:13,909
So what you do, you know, what you

48
00:01:13,909 --> 00:01:15,739
actually deliver to them as free

49
00:01:15,739 --> 00:01:17,060
work has to be a blend

50
00:01:17,099 --> 00:01:18,849
of what they need and what you can

51
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:20,900
provide to them at a high level.

52
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:21,939
So there's two things that you can

53
00:01:21,939 --> 00:01:22,560
do with people.

54
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,579
First off, you can help them start

55
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,620
something totally new, okay?

56
00:01:26,659 --> 00:01:28,319
Or you can optimize something

57
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:30,500
they're currently doing for them.

58
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:31,719
So let's go into a couple examples

59
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:32,379
of each one.

60
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:34,340
First off, let's say you want to

61
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:36,120
reach out to Alex Ramosi.

62
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:37,349
You see he's not posting on

63
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:37,909
Reddit.

64
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,590
So guess what?

65
00:01:38,709 --> 00:01:40,450
You can make him 30 days of plug

66
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:42,280
and play posts for Reddit to help

67
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,659
him start posting on Reddit,

68
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,090
start doing something new to grow

69
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:46,269
his audience on Reddit and get

70
00:01:46,269 --> 00:01:47,500
more clients from Reddit.

71
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,290
Or you can go and help Daniel

72
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:51,340
Fazio start to make more short

73
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:52,500
form content.

74
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:54,829
So you can basically chop up 30

75
00:01:54,829 --> 00:01:57,019
days of post form and captions and

76
00:01:57,079 --> 00:01:58,430
say, hey, Daniel, here

77
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,099
are 30 days I've done for you

78
00:02:00,099 --> 00:02:01,359
posts that you can take to start

79
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:02,629
reaching a big audience on

80
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,540
YouTube, Instagram, Twitter.

81
00:02:04,579 --> 00:02:05,640
I see you're doing a ton of

82
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,159
tweets.

83
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,840
So I took some of your like, you

84
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,788
know, past YouTube videos and your

85
00:02:09,788 --> 00:02:10,860
past tweets and just

86
00:02:11,139 --> 00:02:12,590
took the tweets and made them kind

87
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,110
of more like captions here for you

88
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:14,800
to plug.

89
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,050
And then I also took your high

90
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:17,449
performing YouTube videos and chop

91
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:18,620
those up in the short forms

92
00:02:18,659 --> 00:02:19,539
that you can take here.

93
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:21,449
So doing something upfront that

94
00:02:21,449 --> 00:02:23,439
they aren't doing and helping them

95
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,969
start something new is

96
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,770
a great way to, uh, to basically

97
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,189
garner their business and get

98
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:29,240
attention.

99
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,560
And another thing too, a lot of

100
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,979
you guys that are doing cold email

101
00:02:31,979 --> 00:02:33,069
are like, what do I do?

102
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,080
Well, here's something you could

103
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,979
do is you can write them scripts,

104
00:02:37,099 --> 00:02:38,639
cold email scripts, and you

105
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:40,099
can give them a full guide on

106
00:02:40,099 --> 00:02:41,189
setting up cold email

107
00:02:41,189 --> 00:02:42,979
infrastructure that your agency

108
00:02:42,979 --> 00:02:43,419
uses

109
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,090
for clients.

110
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:44,659
Yes.

111
00:02:44,699 --> 00:02:45,699
You're giving them the sauce,

112
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:46,060
right?

113
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:47,439
You're giving them the secrets and

114
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:48,379
you're going to sell the

115
00:02:48,379 --> 00:02:49,840
implementation down the line.

116
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:50,469
That's what you're doing.

117
00:02:50,539 --> 00:02:51,840
You're giving them the secrets and

118
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,759
then you're selling the

119
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:53,599
implementation.

120
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:55,509
So basically you'd be like, Hey,

121
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:57,419
agency owner, you know, I saw you

122
00:02:57,419 --> 00:02:58,300
running ads.

123
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,949
Um, not sure if you're doing cold

124
00:02:59,949 --> 00:03:01,530
email, but if you're not, you're

125
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,879
missing out on a boatload

126
00:03:02,939 --> 00:03:04,340
of clients like our clients right

127
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:05,729
now are averaging anywhere from

128
00:03:05,729 --> 00:03:08,500
five to 10 closed deals per month,

129
00:03:08,539 --> 00:03:09,419
just through cold email.

130
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:11,340
So what I went ahead is I looked

131
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:12,500
at your offer.

132
00:03:12,539 --> 00:03:13,629
I look at your landing page, some

133
00:03:13,629 --> 00:03:14,289
of your content.

134
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,030
I wrote you scripts that I know

135
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,539
will work really well for cold

136
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,669
email based upon your entire offer

137
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:20,659
and what you have online right

138
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:20,909
now.

139
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:23,129
And I also gave you right here a

140
00:03:23,129 --> 00:03:24,909
full guide on how to actually set

141
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:26,099
up this cold email

142
00:03:26,379 --> 00:03:27,990
infrastructure, how to land, you

143
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:29,689
know, in the primary inbox left

144
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:31,319
and right, how to set up

145
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:32,699
your domains and inboxes and

146
00:03:32,699 --> 00:03:34,469
everything, uh, step by step.

147
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,009
It's the same stuff that we use at

148
00:03:36,009 --> 00:03:37,650
our agency to help, you know, X,

149
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:38,960
Y, Z number of clients

150
00:03:39,009 --> 00:03:40,280
get X, Y, Z results.

151
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:41,530
And I know it's going to get you a

152
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:42,479
ton of results too.

153
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,710
So that's a fantastic way that you

154
00:03:43,729 --> 00:03:44,909
can basically go to somebody and

155
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:46,919
be like, yo, uh, instead of

156
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:48,159
just them, instead of you just

157
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:49,419
basically being like, yo, you

158
00:03:49,419 --> 00:03:50,460
should start cold email.

159
00:03:50,659 --> 00:03:52,240
You're actually giving them the

160
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:53,860
blueprint and the resources to

161
00:03:54,069 --> 00:03:54,680
start it.

162
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:55,740
And then they're going to be like,

163
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:56,469
well, this is a ton.

164
00:03:56,729 --> 00:03:57,680
Uh, wow.

165
00:03:57,879 --> 00:03:59,439
Can you just like do it for me?

166
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:00,530
How much do you just charge?

167
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:01,120
Do it for me.

168
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:01,460
Right.

169
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,469
Or they sometimes like I've sent

170
00:04:03,539 --> 00:04:05,360
people stuff and they take it and

171
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:06,800
they actually use it

172
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:08,530
and they come back and like, dude,

173
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:09,900
that works really good.

174
00:04:09,939 --> 00:04:10,530
You know what you're doing?

175
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:11,500
How can we work together?

176
00:04:11,539 --> 00:04:13,610
So be, you know, it's okay.

177
00:04:13,659 --> 00:04:14,979
If someone takes your dream 100

178
00:04:14,979 --> 00:04:16,079
deliverable and just like runs

179
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,110
with it and gets results,

180
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:17,699
that's awesome.

181
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,060
Right.

182
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:18,689
That's fantastic.

183
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,220
Be okay with that.

184
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:20,819
For sure.

185
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:22,709
But the other side of things that

186
00:04:22,709 --> 00:04:24,009
you can do is you can optimize

187
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:25,759
something for them that

188
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,319
they're currently doing.

189
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,110
So for example, this is kind of

190
00:04:28,189 --> 00:04:30,019
what I did for a little while is I

191
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:31,420
would fix up people's

192
00:04:31,699 --> 00:04:32,459
landing pages, funnels, and

193
00:04:32,459 --> 00:04:32,959
websites.

194
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,399
So I had like a CRO offer at the

195
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:34,879
time.

196
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,980
So I would redo their landing page

197
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:38,779
or a hero section for free in a

198
00:04:38,899 --> 00:04:40,180
nice Figma board and

199
00:04:40,459 --> 00:04:42,699
send it off to them and say, Hey,

200
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:45,220
I saw you were running traffic for

201
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:46,560
XYZ offer to this

202
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:47,649
landing page right here.

203
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:49,670
You're missing out on a ton of

204
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,350
traffic that could be converting

205
00:04:51,569 --> 00:04:52,879
into book calls for your team.

206
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,389
So I went ahead and redid the

207
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:56,069
entire structure and copy of your

208
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,879
landing page to make it more

209
00:04:58,089 --> 00:04:59,009
congruent with your ads and your

210
00:04:59,009 --> 00:05:00,379
offer and make it more compelling.

211
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:02,319
By the way, this is a Figma board

212
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:04,269
that you can take and give to your

213
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:06,310
current developer and just build

214
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:07,579
into whatever funnel building

215
00:05:07,579 --> 00:05:08,910
platform or website platform you

216
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:09,529
use right now.

217
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:10,819
Or if you want, we can just

218
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:12,769
schedule a quick 15 minute call.

219
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:15,129
I can introduce myself, break down

220
00:05:15,209 --> 00:05:16,899
the actual page a little bit more,

221
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:17,540
and then I'll build

222
00:05:17,579 --> 00:05:19,110
it into your platform 100% for

223
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:19,519
free.

224
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,740
So that's another thing that I

225
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:22,689
like to do.

226
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,189
And it's also, I'll get into this

227
00:05:24,189 --> 00:05:25,899
later, but it's beating the call.

228
00:05:25,939 --> 00:05:27,689
It's hooking that call with your

229
00:05:27,769 --> 00:05:29,069
actual deliverables.

230
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:30,800
So that's something that you can

231
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,149
do if you see someone doing

232
00:05:32,149 --> 00:05:34,060
something, you can take what

233
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:35,389
they're existing, what they're

234
00:05:35,389 --> 00:05:36,689
currently doing and optimize it

235
00:05:36,689 --> 00:05:37,230
some more.

236
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,110
So for example, another thing too,

237
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:42,360
I get a lot of guys that hit me up

238
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:42,759
like,

239
00:05:43,379 --> 00:05:44,800
I'm in such a crazy productized

240
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,470
industry.

241
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,790
Like I'm fighting with Fiverr and

242
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:50,180
Upwork people, you know, like

243
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,379
thumbnails.

244
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:52,600
YouTube thumbnails are a great

245
00:05:52,629 --> 00:05:53,459
example of this.

246
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,120
So how do you break through the

247
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:55,699
noise?

248
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:57,209
Well, you can go and redesign

249
00:05:57,209 --> 00:05:58,839
three thumbnails for the actual

250
00:05:58,839 --> 00:06:01,110
prospect, focusing on beating

251
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:04,029
their current CTR, it's supposed

252
00:06:04,029 --> 00:06:06,689
to say CTR, not CTA, and tell them

253
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,139
that you'll make their

254
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,589
next two free thumbnails as well,

255
00:06:10,589 --> 00:06:11,300
right?

256
00:06:11,339 --> 00:06:13,850
So if you make thumbnails, you can

257
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:16,370
go, Hey, John, I saw that you're

258
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:17,939
making awesome YouTube

259
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:18,399
content.

260
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:19,319
I love it.

261
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,740
I made three thumbnails that based

262
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,980
upon my experience, I think are

263
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,250
style a little bit

264
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,220
better for your industry and can

265
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,410
help you get a better

266
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:30,399
click-through rate, which is a

267
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:30,699
huge

268
00:06:30,939 --> 00:06:31,839
thing on YouTube to get you a ton

269
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:33,019
of organic reach and clients and

270
00:06:33,019 --> 00:06:33,680
everything.

271
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,899
So I redesigned three with a

272
00:06:34,899 --> 00:06:36,300
click-through rate in mind.

273
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:38,420
And by the way, if you have like

274
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:40,519
two videos that are coming out or

275
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:42,160
already planning to come

276
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,939
out and are in editing, I'd love

277
00:06:43,949 --> 00:06:45,870
to hop on a quick 15 minute call

278
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:47,040
with you to start to

279
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:48,660
design those two for you for free

280
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:50,139
so we can get a jump on them.

281
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,290
So I want to help you out and help

282
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:52,620
drive up those click-through rates

283
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,120
for you.

284
00:06:55,129 --> 00:06:56,639
And then finally, you know,

285
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,250
helping someone, something as

286
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:00,040
broad as like increasing their

287
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:01,259
ROAS, right?

288
00:07:01,459 --> 00:07:03,259
You can basically say, Hey, uh, I

289
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:05,290
made five to 10 static ads after

290
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:06,639
looking through your

291
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,410
meta ad library that, uh, will

292
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:09,850
help you, you know, basically

293
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:11,579
drive up your ROAS and get

294
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:13,069
you a lot more, uh, click-through

295
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:14,329
rates and basically sell your

296
00:07:14,329 --> 00:07:15,620
offer better, uh, through

297
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:16,800
ads and through paid advertising.

298
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:18,050
And you can just deliver that to

299
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:19,310
them and literally just tell them,

300
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,019
Hey, plug and play

301
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:21,009
these run them against what you're

302
00:07:21,009 --> 00:07:21,639
currently doing.

303
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,730
And I guarantee that they're going

304
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:23,660
to beat what you're currently

305
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:24,069
doing.

306
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,220
Um, sometimes if I know they're

307
00:07:26,269 --> 00:07:28,560
really going to do well, I'll even

308
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,839
go as bold to say to

309
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,920
them is like, I'll even pay for,

310
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,350
you know, um, I'll pay you $500

311
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:35,769
for wasted spend.

312
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:37,480
If they don't beat your current

313
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,399
ads within $500, right?

314
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:40,649
So it's basically like no risk

315
00:07:40,709 --> 00:07:41,060
them.

316
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,720
So key points to remember with any

317
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,860
dream 100 deliverable, okay, is

318
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:47,980
everything needs

319
00:07:48,019 --> 00:07:49,769
to be as plug and play for them as

320
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:50,699
possible.

321
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:51,560
Okay.

322
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,569
So, you know, you don't want to

323
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,470
basically give them something

324
00:07:55,579 --> 00:07:57,490
that's like fragmented, uh,

325
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:58,759
kind of like going back to the

326
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:00,110
cold email example over here.

327
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,480
You don't just want to like give

328
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,839
them a script and then be like,

329
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:04,009
yeah, good luck with all the

330
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:04,579
other stuff.

331
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,199
Like cheers.

332
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,670
The script is worthless to them

333
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:08,980
because they don't have the

334
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,000
infrastructure.

335
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:10,810
They don't even know how to set up

336
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:11,470
the infrastructure.

337
00:08:11,529 --> 00:08:12,699
Like there's so much there.

338
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,399
So you want to be, you want to

339
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:15,800
make it very plug and play for

340
00:08:15,899 --> 00:08:17,220
them as possible, the thing

341
00:08:17,259 --> 00:08:17,850
that you're giving them.

342
00:08:18,259 --> 00:08:20,089
Then you want to make it custom to

343
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:22,300
what they specifically need.

344
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,220
This is the key.

345
00:08:23,259 --> 00:08:24,709
So take the extra 10 minutes to

346
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,220
ensure that you really understand

347
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,459
what problems they have,

348
00:08:27,709 --> 00:08:28,949
what problems they need to be

349
00:08:28,949 --> 00:08:30,629
solved or they need to have solved

350
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:31,680
and how you can actually

351
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:32,309
solve them.

352
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:32,740
Okay.

353
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:34,480
So this is something like, I have

354
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,908
a lot of guys that have reached

355
00:08:36,038 --> 00:08:37,440
out to me that run content

356
00:08:37,798 --> 00:08:39,009
agencies and like, I don't know

357
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:40,679
why, you know, I'm trying to reach

358
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:42,000
out to people

359
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,580
that have 300,000 subscribers on

360
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,200
YouTube and I'm trying to write

361
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,470
scripts for them and edit

362
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:49,190
for them and they won't reply to

363
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:49,539
me.

364
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,559
Well, here's the thing.

365
00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:52,100
Guess what?

366
00:08:52,379 --> 00:08:53,889
Cause you're going after like guys

367
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,889
that already have it established,

368
00:08:55,889 --> 00:08:56,419
right?

369
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:58,370
They already have, they really

370
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:00,360
don't have that many problems with

371
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,909
like editing and scripting

372
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:02,519
and all that.

373
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:03,769
Everything's already dialed in.

374
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:06,100
So you're basically trying to, you

375
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,850
know, sell something or give

376
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:09,409
something to somebody that

377
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:10,990
doesn't necessarily need it,

378
00:09:11,049 --> 00:09:11,440
right?

379
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,419
Go to someone like me.

380
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:14,070
If you look at my YouTube, I have

381
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:15,179
like four videos.

382
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:16,590
I clearly do not have a good

383
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:17,200
editor.

384
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,190
I clearly do not have a good, uh,

385
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,279
you know, scripting process.

386
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,769
Like go to me because you see on

387
00:09:22,779 --> 00:09:24,409
all these other platforms, I'm

388
00:09:24,409 --> 00:09:25,799
posting constantly, I'm

389
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,139
posting constantly, I'm posting,

390
00:09:27,139 --> 00:09:28,340
you know, revenue numbers.

391
00:09:28,379 --> 00:09:30,090
So I'm, you know, all everywhere

392
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:31,539
online besides like YouTube and

393
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:33,240
stuff and YouTube, I'm just

394
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:34,750
slacking on, right?

395
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:36,519
So that's an example.

396
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:37,960
Go to somebody that actually

397
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,519
clearly from the outside needs

398
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:40,840
your service and doesn't

399
00:09:40,889 --> 00:09:41,220
necessarily

400
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,399
have it fully dialed in.

401
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,129
Now on the flip side, if you are

402
00:09:44,129 --> 00:09:47,059
targeting someone that has 300,000

403
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:48,330
followers and you clearly

404
00:09:48,769 --> 00:09:50,639
see that their thumbnails suck and

405
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:52,700
you can provide great, you know,

406
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:53,970
specific knowledge

407
00:09:54,299 --> 00:09:55,809
around that and specific value

408
00:09:55,889 --> 00:09:57,759
around that very small thing of

409
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:59,470
their whole system and vortex

410
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:00,629
that they have going on, then do

411
00:10:00,629 --> 00:10:01,820
that because that's going to stand

412
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:02,149
out.

413
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,720
It's more niche versus this broad

414
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,610
thing, right?

415
00:10:04,899 --> 00:10:06,909
And what I tried to do too, is I

416
00:10:06,909 --> 00:10:08,940
touched on this a little bit

417
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,360
earlier, but try to weave in

418
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:13,250
like a mandatory call to implement

419
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,070
the free work, uh, deliverable

420
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:16,019
that you did.

421
00:10:16,059 --> 00:10:17,730
So for example, again, with the

422
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:19,509
landing pages, I would redesign a

423
00:10:19,629 --> 00:10:20,639
landing page in Figma.

424
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:21,889
So I would send them the Figma

425
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:23,470
file, then tell them if you, uh,

426
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:24,860
you know, like this file,

427
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:26,460
we can hop on a quick 10 minute

428
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,870
call so I can get you to log into

429
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:29,279
your platform, uh, meet

430
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:29,950
you real quick.

431
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:31,230
So, you know, I'm not some crazy

432
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:32,360
dude off the internet and I'll

433
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,190
build them there completely

434
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:34,019
for free.

435
00:10:34,059 --> 00:10:34,929
So you can just start running it

436
00:10:34,929 --> 00:10:35,460
immediately.

437
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:36,950
And then writing cold email

438
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,639
scripts for someone you can, you

439
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:40,500
know, angle the deliverable

440
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:41,580
as a cold outreach script.

441
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:42,830
So you can use immediately to

442
00:10:42,889 --> 00:10:44,419
generate warm leads, you know,

443
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:45,909
send them the scripts, send

444
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:47,909
them the actual infrastructure set

445
00:10:47,909 --> 00:10:49,549
up and then try to get on a quick

446
00:10:49,549 --> 00:10:51,200
10 to 15 minute call

447
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,820
where you can show them actually

448
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,370
the next steps to take the scripts

449
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,519
that you have and take

450
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:56,970
the infrastructure map and

451
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:58,620
step-by-step guide that you built

452
00:10:58,620 --> 00:10:59,970
for them and show them what

453
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:00,879
to do next, right?

454
00:11:01,139 --> 00:11:02,649
Make it again as plug and play and

455
00:11:02,649 --> 00:11:04,580
easy as possible for them to do.

456
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:07,250
And also with all this here, you

457
00:11:07,309 --> 00:11:08,620
got to be freaking relentless when

458
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:09,480
getting value.

459
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:10,970
Like just try to make someone's

460
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:11,779
life better.

461
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,009
Try to make their business better.

462
00:11:13,059 --> 00:11:14,139
Try to make them better.

463
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:15,200
That's huge, right?

464
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,179
Be like Joe Rogan here.

465
00:11:16,379 --> 00:11:17,289
This dude is relentless as

466
00:11:17,289 --> 00:11:18,100
freaking heck.

467
00:11:18,139 --> 00:11:19,889
He will get any interview, right?

468
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,509
He's, he's might not be providing

469
00:11:21,509 --> 00:11:23,000
value to Conor McGregor's life at

470
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,289
this point here, but

471
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:25,649
this dude is relentless.

472
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:26,019
Okay.

473
00:11:26,059 --> 00:11:26,649
So be like him.

474
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:27,919
Give value to people.

475
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:31,570
So how much free work should you

476
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:34,710
actually do, you know, you should

477
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:36,460
be going after a dream

478
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:37,639
100 prospects, right?

479
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:39,110
Let me emphasize one thing here.

480
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:41,600
Dream 100 prospects, the word

481
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,240
dream.

482
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:42,740
Okay.

483
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:43,340
Right here.

484
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:44,539
Big letters.

485
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:45,600
Dream.

486
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:46,980
These are the people that you

487
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,220
should be going after.

488
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:50,960
Like anyone can be a high paying

489
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,919
client.

490
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,019
I understand that, but you want to

491
00:11:54,019 --> 00:11:55,990
be targeting proven people that

492
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:58,659
are dream prospects that from

493
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:59,779
the outside looking in are

494
00:11:59,779 --> 00:12:01,210
qualified enough to pay you a good

495
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:01,850
chunk of cash.

496
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,490
If they like your work, it will be

497
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:04,879
a great case study builder in your

498
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:05,639
industry.

499
00:12:05,909 --> 00:12:07,049
Again, this is a fast way to fast

500
00:12:07,049 --> 00:12:07,919
strike growth.

501
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,149
So in knowing that you should put

502
00:12:10,149 --> 00:12:12,399
some additional effort and time

503
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,639
into the free work that you do,

504
00:12:14,919 --> 00:12:16,429
your reputation and money is on

505
00:12:16,509 --> 00:12:17,169
the line.

506
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:18,080
So make it count.

507
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:18,710
Okay.

508
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,610
So again, this all kind of ties

509
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:21,539
in, right?

510
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:22,740
I didn't give you a clear answer.

511
00:12:22,779 --> 00:12:24,110
I'll give you a clear answer in a

512
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:25,580
few slides here, but how much free

513
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:26,639
work you should do.

514
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:28,169
You should really change that

515
00:12:28,169 --> 00:12:29,779
mindset to how much value should I

516
00:12:29,779 --> 00:12:30,759
give somebody?

517
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,840
How long does it take to give the

518
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,950
necessary value to this person

519
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:36,620
that I need for them to

520
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:37,559
actually look at me and be like,

521
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:38,389
yo, this guy knows what he's

522
00:12:38,389 --> 00:12:38,730
doing.

523
00:12:38,779 --> 00:12:40,299
He helped us so much.

524
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:41,379
I need to talk to him more.

525
00:12:41,419 --> 00:12:41,659
Right?

526
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:43,370
So just think, what would I have

527
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:44,889
to do to virtually guarantee that

528
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:46,120
XYZ person works

529
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:47,669
with me, notices me and sees the

530
00:12:47,669 --> 00:12:49,289
value that I can provide them.

531
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:51,529
Now go ahead and do that work and

532
00:12:51,529 --> 00:12:53,809
take as long as you need to get

533
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:56,840
that actual result and to

534
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,399
provide them with something of

535
00:12:58,399 --> 00:12:59,820
immense, insane value.

536
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:04,100
So on one singular deliverable.

537
00:13:04,379 --> 00:13:04,620
Okay.

538
00:13:04,899 --> 00:13:07,139
Again, keep that in mind that you

539
00:13:07,139 --> 00:13:09,320
want to really put a ton of time

540
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:11,259
and effort as much as needed

541
00:13:11,299 --> 00:13:12,860
to send them something good and of

542
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:13,370
value.

543
00:13:13,649 --> 00:13:14,870
Cause that's your whole campaign

544
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:15,740
relies on that.

545
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:16,940
Your whole lifeblood of your

546
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,320
campaign relies on you actually

547
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,639
sending them something good,

548
00:13:19,929 --> 00:13:21,610
but how long should you actually

549
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:23,899
spend on one singular deliverable?

550
00:13:24,019 --> 00:13:24,970
So one singular thing that I'm

551
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,009
going to send one prospect.

552
00:13:26,059 --> 00:13:27,470
So first you have to decide what

553
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:29,519
your true goal with dream 100 is.

554
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:31,110
Are you trying to make money and

555
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:31,970
close deals?

556
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:33,330
So you're under like 10 K a month

557
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:35,059
trying to scale, or are you trying

558
00:13:35,059 --> 00:13:36,299
to stack case studies

559
00:13:36,379 --> 00:13:37,500
to accelerate growth?

560
00:13:37,539 --> 00:13:39,090
So usually between that, like 10,

561
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:40,620
15, 30 K per month range.

562
00:13:40,659 --> 00:13:42,669
So these are the two paths of

563
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,279
dream 100.

564
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,700
It's not really meant to be a

565
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,450
long-term acquisition channel,

566
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:48,100
right?

567
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:49,889
Your people that are at, you know,

568
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:51,990
500 K a month aren't necessarily

569
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:53,360
doing this, but it's

570
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:54,799
a great way to fast track your

571
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:55,379
growth.

572
00:13:55,419 --> 00:13:56,509
So these are kind of a two paths

573
00:13:56,519 --> 00:13:57,360
that you can take.

574
00:13:57,559 --> 00:13:59,659
So if you take the case study

575
00:13:59,659 --> 00:14:02,820
route, you're basically looking at

576
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,899
anywhere from three to

577
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:06,429
five hours plus per deliverable,

578
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:07,710
and you're doing about two to

579
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:08,570
three per week.

580
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:09,759
Oops.

581
00:14:09,809 --> 00:14:11,720
And the money-making route, you're

582
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,370
doing about one to two hours per

583
00:14:13,389 --> 00:14:15,230
deliverable, and you're

584
00:14:15,509 --> 00:14:16,460
doing about one to two per day

585
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:17,370
you're sending out.

586
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:19,080
So why, why the big difference?

587
00:14:19,289 --> 00:14:20,519
Case study builders are usually

588
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:21,899
bigger companies, right?

589
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:22,940
Like these are the gym launches.

590
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:24,730
So these are the huge companies

591
00:14:24,809 --> 00:14:26,730
that you really want to make a fat

592
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:27,620
impact on.

593
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:29,309
You want to make a huge impression

594
00:14:29,309 --> 00:14:30,100
on, right?

595
00:14:30,379 --> 00:14:31,710
These are the people that you want

596
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:33,139
to sign that are whales in your

597
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:33,879
industry.

598
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:35,500
So I'm putting a lot of effort, a

599
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,940
lot of time, and a lot of work

600
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:38,210
into these deliverables

601
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:38,879
that I send them.

602
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:40,299
So I'm only sending about two to

603
00:14:40,299 --> 00:14:40,990
three a week.

604
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,850
You know, these are the guys like,

605
00:14:42,929 --> 00:14:44,460
right now I'm reaching out to Andy

606
00:14:44,669 --> 00:14:45,259
Elliott.

607
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:47,139
You know, that's another one.

608
00:14:47,179 --> 00:14:48,179
Like Jeremy Miner, I'm reaching

609
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:48,679
out to him.

610
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:50,480
So then you have the money-making

611
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,600
route, which is a little bit more

612
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,159
high volume.

613
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,950
It's not like cold DMs at all.

614
00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:55,230
Don't, don't get me wrong.

615
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,100
It's not cold DMs, but it's a

616
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,200
little more high volume, right?

617
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,559
You want to pump out one to two

618
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,120
per day.

619
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:00,350
So if you're below like 10K a

620
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:01,610
month, this is kind of the route

621
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:02,289
you want to do.

622
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,149
Just keep like ripping out,

623
00:15:03,169 --> 00:15:04,149
ripping out, ripping out, ripping

624
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:04,990
out and getting reps in.

625
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,519
So this would take one to two

626
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:07,549
hours per deliverable.

627
00:15:07,659 --> 00:15:09,600
So you can do about one to two per

628
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:10,139
day.

629
00:15:10,179 --> 00:15:11,250
If you can get up to three,

630
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:11,840
awesome.

631
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:13,000
But again, we got to go back to

632
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:13,919
these slides here.

633
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,169
That's why I had it beforehand.

634
00:15:15,409 --> 00:15:17,440
How much free work should you do?

635
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,639
How long should you spend on it?

636
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:20,320
Again, these are some rough

637
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,519
timeframes right here and times.

638
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,029
But again, got to focus on making

639
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:27,820
these things good, man, and

640
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,419
putting a lot of work into them

641
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:31,679
and putting a lot of effort and

642
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:34,120
time into making them top-notch

643
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,289
and really give a great impression

644
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:38,080
to the client or prospect.

645
00:15:38,179 --> 00:15:39,700
So organizing an outreach

646
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,899
document, what should you actually

647
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:42,799
put inside?

648
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,279
So I use gamma.app or Google Docs,

649
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,860
how to structure it.

650
00:15:46,899 --> 00:15:48,269
You know, you basically have the

651
00:15:48,269 --> 00:15:48,649
intro.

652
00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:51,559
So explain the problem, the video.

653
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:53,299
I always put a video in mine.

654
00:15:53,539 --> 00:15:54,460
Every time I put a Loom video or

655
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:55,679
YouTube video or something,

656
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,299
explaining what's in the document,

657
00:15:57,299 --> 00:15:58,679
what the deliverable is,

658
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,330
why I'm reaching out to them, and

659
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:01,639
breaking down the actual thing

660
00:16:01,639 --> 00:16:02,580
that they're seeing.

661
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:04,490
So the deliverable, deliverable

662
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:05,320
breakdown.

663
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:06,179
So what is it?

664
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:07,669
Why should they care about this?

665
00:16:07,889 --> 00:16:09,620
The next steps, give clear next

666
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:10,210
steps.

667
00:16:10,259 --> 00:16:11,370
This is, again, where you pitch

668
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:11,860
that call.

669
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:13,649
And I sometimes like to do a quick

670
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,480
bio, too.

671
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:15,529
So I'll do a quick little bio

672
00:16:15,529 --> 00:16:15,980
myself.

673
00:16:16,019 --> 00:16:17,769
So I am with contact info.

674
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:19,789
So definitely phone number,

675
00:16:19,789 --> 00:16:21,029
definitely email.

676
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:22,470
I've literally had people call me

677
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:23,029
and text me.

678
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:23,789
It's fantastic.

679
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,019
So put your freaking phone in

680
00:16:25,019 --> 00:16:25,399
there.

681
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,620
And photo, make it look a little

682
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:27,700
bit more human-like.

683
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:28,669
If you want to put your social

684
00:16:28,669 --> 00:16:30,320
links, too, I do that as well.

685
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,190
And over here, I'm going to send

686
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:37,870
this actual presentation and have

687
00:16:38,059 --> 00:16:39,559
it linked for you guys below in

688
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:40,110
this module.

689
00:16:40,169 --> 00:16:42,409
So these are three different

690
00:16:42,409 --> 00:16:44,820
clickable sections that you can

691
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:45,899
look at.

692
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:48,029
So right here is Andrew Tate's

693
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,169
videographer.

694
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:52,139
He made a fantastic Twitter thread

695
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:55,230
about this strategy, essentially,

696
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:57,759
and how he landed Andrew Tate as a

697
00:16:57,909 --> 00:16:58,220
client.

698
00:16:58,940 --> 00:16:59,940
So that's definitely one to check

699
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:00,240
out.

700
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,350
Over here is a Dream 100 outreach

701
00:17:02,429 --> 00:17:04,140
deliverable document that I wrote

702
00:17:04,259 --> 00:17:05,900
and did for Patrick Bet David,

703
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:07,960
redesigning their landing pages.

704
00:17:08,269 --> 00:17:09,809
And then over here is the gym

705
00:17:09,809 --> 00:17:11,950
launch document I did to actually

706
00:17:12,059 --> 00:17:13,799
sign them that I'm going to go

707
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:15,769
over in much more depth coming up

708
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:16,440
here.

709
00:17:20,318 --> 00:17:22,068
So note, if it's something like a

710
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:23,680
thumbnail or something you do

711
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:25,500
with, you know, you're sending

712
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,289
someone something that has like a

713
00:17:27,299 --> 00:17:29,500
visual design aspect to it, right?

714
00:17:29,539 --> 00:17:31,180
A thumbnail, a landing page

715
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:33,410
redesign, a static graphic, social

716
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:34,420
media images.

717
00:17:34,619 --> 00:17:36,309
You can get away with just sending

718
00:17:36,309 --> 00:17:38,069
them the images in your initial

719
00:17:38,069 --> 00:17:39,339
message, right?

720
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:41,089
So this is what someone actually

721
00:17:41,089 --> 00:17:42,400
sent me on Instagram.

722
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:44,039
They're like, yo, I redesigned a

723
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:45,380
few thumbnails for you.

724
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:46,890
I saw you were missing a couple

725
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,549
like here, three of them that you

726
00:17:48,579 --> 00:17:50,079
can take right away and download

727
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,990
and put them in your YouTube.

728
00:17:52,039 --> 00:17:53,470
So this is pretty cool because it

729
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:54,759
like showed as I opened up the

730
00:17:54,759 --> 00:17:56,619
Instagram message like, oh, cool.

731
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,039
I don't have to click on something

732
00:17:58,039 --> 00:17:59,349
else and go to another page, go

733
00:17:59,349 --> 00:18:00,529
through another step.

734
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:01,920
It's just right there for me.

735
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:02,940
So that was awesome, right?

736
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:04,119
Really caught my attention, caught

737
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:04,450
my eye.

738
00:18:04,509 --> 00:18:06,990
So how do we make successful free

739
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:09,579
work that actually converts?

740
00:18:09,619 --> 00:18:11,250
So you have to make it custom to

741
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:12,750
them and what they need.

742
00:18:13,079 --> 00:18:14,680
Again, don't make it salesy,

743
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,329
right?

744
00:18:15,589 --> 00:18:16,470
That's a big thing.

745
00:18:16,519 --> 00:18:17,640
A lot of people will try to make

746
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,869
these super salesy and they'll

747
00:18:18,869 --> 00:18:20,240
have a big old document explaining

748
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,509
their whole process and their

749
00:18:21,509 --> 00:18:22,839
unique mechanism and why they

750
00:18:23,109 --> 00:18:24,460
should care about, you know, low

751
00:18:24,529 --> 00:18:25,119
ticket funnels.

752
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,269
And, you know, why they should

753
00:18:26,269 --> 00:18:27,509
care about YouTube content and all

754
00:18:27,509 --> 00:18:28,099
this stuff.

755
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,630
And then they'll just be slamming

756
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:30,819
these CTAs with a call.

757
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:31,450
Like, don't do that.

758
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:32,000
Okay.

759
00:18:32,269 --> 00:18:33,230
Again, we want to come from a

760
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:34,630
standpoint of genuine value up

761
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:36,109
front and we want to actually make

762
00:18:36,109 --> 00:18:36,700
it good.

763
00:18:36,759 --> 00:18:38,130
We're going to make it easy for

764
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:39,339
them to use, implement and

765
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:39,900
consume.

766
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:42,079
And this is a big frame of mind

767
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:42,680
here.

768
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,740
Treat the free work like you got

769
00:18:44,839 --> 00:18:45,720
paid for it.

770
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:47,910
And now we're going to move into

771
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:50,049
module four on the next one.

772
00:18:50,119 --> 00:18:51,430
We're going to go over the gym

773
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:52,900
lodge case study that I did.
