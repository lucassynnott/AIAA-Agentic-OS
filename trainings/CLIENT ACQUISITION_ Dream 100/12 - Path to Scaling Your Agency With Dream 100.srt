1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:01,120
All right, getting to the end

2
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:01,480
guys.

3
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:03,710
Module 12, your path to scaling

4
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:05,830
your agency with the Dream 100

5
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:06,559
outreach method.

6
00:00:06,559 --> 00:00:06,940
Here we go.

7
00:00:07,019 --> 00:00:08,039
I just want to draw this little

8
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:08,980
diagram for you guys.

9
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:10,619
So Dream 100 is really good for

10
00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:12,359
you if you're just starting out,

11
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:13,949
don't have a lot of case studies,

12
00:00:14,189 --> 00:00:14,410
right?

13
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:15,900
Not a lot of stuff to leverage and

14
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:17,969
don't have a big marketing budget.

15
00:00:17,969 --> 00:00:19,480
You're between that zero to 10k

16
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:20,339
range per month.

17
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:23,329
So that's really what you want to

18
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:24,370
focus on to get you up towards

19
00:00:24,769 --> 00:00:26,429
that 10k per month range where you

20
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:28,030
can start to layer on something

21
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:29,260
like cold email.

22
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:30,620
That's a little bit more mass

23
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:32,420
while still doing Dream 100.

24
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,070
But now focusing a little bit more

25
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:35,799
on those like case study builders.

26
00:00:36,009 --> 00:00:37,399
Remember back a few modules ago,

27
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:39,030
we talked about, you know, the two

28
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:40,439
paths of Dream 100, the

29
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:41,789
moneymaking path and the case

30
00:00:41,799 --> 00:00:43,000
study building path.

31
00:00:43,229 --> 00:00:43,399
Okay.

32
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:44,759
So up here, when you're just

33
00:00:44,759 --> 00:00:46,369
starting out, you want to really

34
00:00:46,369 --> 00:00:47,869
have that moneymaking path.

35
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:49,420
You just want to get some reps in,

36
00:00:49,479 --> 00:00:51,189
sign some deals, start stacking up

37
00:00:51,189 --> 00:00:52,859
a couple of testimonials and start

38
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,460
stacking up some cash.

39
00:00:54,549 --> 00:00:55,969
So then you can layer on a channel

40
00:00:56,119 --> 00:00:57,539
like cold email once you're

41
00:00:57,539 --> 00:00:59,630
between 10 and 25k per month and

42
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:01,679
also just keep doing Dream 100,

43
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:03,329
but start to shift it a little bit

44
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:05,079
more towards that like case study

45
00:01:05,079 --> 00:01:06,230
builder point.

46
00:01:06,349 --> 00:01:07,959
And then once you get to like 30k

47
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:09,439
per month, this is where you want

48
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,120
to just do, you know, paid ads,

49
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:12,680
layer that on, cold email, keep

50
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:14,629
scaling that and Dream 100 only to

51
00:01:14,629 --> 00:01:15,250
whales.

52
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:16,799
Ones that are just going to be

53
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,299
huge deals for you, big case

54
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:19,930
studies and big builders in the

55
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:21,670
whole time, make some content,

56
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:23,319
keep ripping out content.

57
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:26,560
So when you're first starting out,

58
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,260
you, you know, don't have proof,

59
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:28,879
right?

60
00:01:28,969 --> 00:01:30,689
So this is something I really want

61
00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:32,359
to talk about when you're scaling

62
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,379
your agency is, you know, you can

63
00:01:34,379 --> 00:01:35,819
go out in there and copy winning

64
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,209
offers, but the proof is what will

65
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:40,659
really help you sell things.

66
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:41,180
Okay.

67
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:42,370
That's really going to help you

68
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:43,269
sell your services.

69
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:45,129
So doing free work in implementing

70
00:01:45,129 --> 00:01:47,030
the Dream 100 is a way to speed

71
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:48,950
run your proof in your proof

72
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:51,640
acquisition, basically to fuel

73
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,319
further scaling.

74
00:01:54,049 --> 00:01:56,290
So what I mean by this is like, if

75
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:58,590
you stay niched, you're going to

76
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:00,540
be able to get bigger and bigger

77
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,590
testimonials from people in your

78
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:04,730
industry that are huge whales and

79
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:06,140
big fish, right?

80
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,450
So that all goes back to this

81
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:08,569
slide right here when I was

82
00:02:09,099 --> 00:02:10,580
talking about stacking up proof.

83
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:11,599
So when you're starting out from

84
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:12,710
nothing, you're starting out from

85
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:13,629
scratch, you need to get this

86
00:02:13,629 --> 00:02:14,590
proof that you know what you're

87
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:14,979
doing.

88
00:02:15,449 --> 00:02:16,889
So you can basically speed run

89
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:18,539
your way to that and becoming an

90
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:20,400
authority figure in your space and

91
00:02:20,469 --> 00:02:22,159
in your industry and in your niche

92
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:24,280
just by using Dream 100, staying

93
00:02:24,509 --> 00:02:25,979
niched and going after the whales

94
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,139
in your industry.

95
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:28,900
Because for example, me with Gym

96
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:30,439
Launch, I signed Gym Launch.

97
00:02:30,699 --> 00:02:31,080
Guess what?

98
00:02:31,169 --> 00:02:32,180
They're pretty high up there in

99
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,240
the totem pool of info product

100
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:33,699
companies.

101
00:02:34,129 --> 00:02:35,840
Everyone below them that I'm like,

102
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:37,539
yo, I work in Gym Launch.

103
00:02:37,629 --> 00:02:39,069
You're like, oh shoot, you know

104
00:02:39,129 --> 00:02:40,139
your stuff, right?

105
00:02:40,389 --> 00:02:41,490
Even people that are on that level

106
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:42,560
with Gym Launch doing the same

107
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,409
kind of revenue and same

108
00:02:43,409 --> 00:02:44,520
reputation in the industry and

109
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,909
everything, they're like, oh yeah,

110
00:02:45,909 --> 00:02:47,080
he knows what he's doing.

111
00:02:47,169 --> 00:02:48,139
He works with them.

112
00:02:48,229 --> 00:02:49,879
So basically, you just want to

113
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:51,620
build like an endless conga line

114
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:53,650
of testimonials and proof that you

115
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:55,550
have helped major players in that

116
00:02:55,689 --> 00:02:57,129
industry and keep going up the

117
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,240
food chain.

118
00:02:58,389 --> 00:02:59,770
You will now blow everyone out of

119
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:01,250
the water who has a similar offer

120
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:02,680
because you have the proof that

121
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,039
you know what you're doing and

122
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:05,240
you've worked with big companies

123
00:03:05,849 --> 00:03:07,219
before in the same industry.

124
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:09,020
So that's a big thing, again, that

125
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,580
I want to really just place here

126
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,379
with Dream 100 is it's a great

127
00:03:12,379 --> 00:03:14,069
acquisition strategy to stack up

128
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:15,639
money and stuff like that.

129
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,490
But it's even better to be

130
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:19,580
hyper-targeted to these big

131
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:21,509
companies like you can get

132
00:03:21,509 --> 00:03:24,120
hyper-targeted with your outreach

133
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,259
methods and only target ones that

134
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,849
are going to be big fish in your

135
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:29,659
space and just stack up, like help

136
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:31,210
you stack up authority within your

137
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,580
industry and your ICP so you can

138
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:33,849
really just keep leveling up

139
00:03:33,849 --> 00:03:34,419
there.

140
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:37,060
So again, that's what I'm doing

141
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:38,139
with like my funnel build-up

142
00:03:38,139 --> 00:03:39,699
offer, build-out offer right now.

143
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,009
I'm just stacking bigger and

144
00:03:41,009 --> 00:03:42,310
bigger whales and until I've

145
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:43,789
worked with the biggest names in

146
00:03:43,789 --> 00:03:45,430
the industry, it's like a frigging

147
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:46,050
ladder.

148
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:48,030
So final side note, if nobody

149
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:50,240
wants your free work, then shift

150
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,289
your ICP or your deliverable or

151
00:03:52,289 --> 00:03:54,560
offer completely because that's a

152
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,300
very big indication.

153
00:03:56,389 --> 00:03:58,270
If you do 100 outreaches and no

154
00:03:58,310 --> 00:03:59,789
one wants your stuff, then you

155
00:03:59,979 --> 00:04:01,849
know there's something wrong with

156
00:04:01,849 --> 00:04:03,240
your ICP, your research,

157
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,900
deliverable, or offer.

158
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:05,800
So there's something there.

159
00:04:05,889 --> 00:04:07,009
So you got to really like look at

160
00:04:07,009 --> 00:04:08,210
it from a high level and see what

161
00:04:08,219 --> 00:04:08,939
the issue is.

162
00:04:09,139 --> 00:04:09,879
Word just asked me.

163
00:04:09,939 --> 00:04:10,520
I got you.

164
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:12,919
So dream 100 is a tough strategy.

165
00:04:13,129 --> 00:04:13,819
Most will give up.

166
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:15,219
So don't.

167
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:15,960
Okay.

168
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:17,240
Now we're going to move into

169
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,920
module 13 real quick, which is

170
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:20,000
your action items.
