1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:00,730
All right.

2
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:01,780
Welcome my friends to module

3
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:02,459
number 11.

4
00:00:02,459 --> 00:00:04,540
We are wrapping up here very soon.

5
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:04,879
We're

6
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:06,389
getting into some more fun stuff,

7
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,919
increasing your response rates,

8
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:08,369
right?

9
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,960
So if you're sitting there

10
00:00:10,339 --> 00:00:11,500
dealing with low response rates,

11
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:12,919
you're just making all this free

12
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:14,339
work, you're sending it out

13
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:15,580
and people just aren't replying to

14
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:15,869
you.

15
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:17,199
They're not booking your calls.

16
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:18,280
Like you're just getting

17
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:18,870
down.

18
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:20,980
What we're going to do today is

19
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:22,839
show you a couple more very

20
00:00:22,839 --> 00:00:24,940
creative ways to increase your

21
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:26,949
response rates and take rates on

22
00:00:26,949 --> 00:00:28,289
your deliverable.

23
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:29,480
So let's dive in.

24
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,460
So strategies to increase the

25
00:00:31,829 --> 00:00:33,159
chance that someone will reply to

26
00:00:33,159 --> 00:00:34,789
you and see your dream 100

27
00:00:34,789 --> 00:00:35,640
deliverable.

28
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:36,859
There's a lot of cool ones

29
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:37,490
in here.

30
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:38,329
So let's go.

31
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:40,219
First is you can test with burner

32
00:00:40,219 --> 00:00:40,990
accounts.

33
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:42,759
So you can basically send like

34
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:45,039
one kind of salesy message and one

35
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:47,409
prospect related message on burner

36
00:00:47,549 --> 00:00:49,500
accounts to this prospect.

37
00:00:49,969 --> 00:00:52,409
So something like just a generic

38
00:00:52,539 --> 00:00:54,969
ass cool DM on the one and another

39
00:00:54,969 --> 00:00:56,740
one, you can do something like

40
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,399
praising them for some content and

41
00:00:58,399 --> 00:00:59,240
being genuine.

42
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,659
See if they reply or not on that

43
00:01:00,659 --> 00:01:01,299
channel.

44
00:01:01,299 --> 00:01:01,960
Because

45
00:01:02,409 --> 00:01:03,880
sometimes you'll see that someone

46
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,489
is totally dead or they're just

47
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:07,469
using, you know, many chat or AI

48
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:07,659
or

49
00:01:07,769 --> 00:01:08,030
something.

50
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:08,780
You're like, all right, I'm

51
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:09,569
probably not going to reach out

52
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:10,340
first on this channel.

53
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:10,599
I'll go

54
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:12,140
reach out and focus my time and

55
00:01:12,209 --> 00:01:13,750
effort on another platform,

56
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:15,780
another channel, just by testing

57
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:15,959
with

58
00:01:16,359 --> 00:01:17,200
burner accounts.

59
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,000
So send them stuff in person,

60
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:19,450
right?

61
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:21,640
Gifts, lunches, notes, add a QR

62
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:22,200
code on

63
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:23,150
other things as well.

64
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:23,890
It's a great way.

65
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:25,159
I send like donuts all the time to

66
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:26,180
people like coffee and

67
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:27,560
donuts to their main offices.

68
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,290
This works better with B2B, right?

69
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:30,790
You can actually pull their office

70
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:32,849
and headquarters locations.

71
00:01:32,849 --> 00:01:34,750
So this works fantastic, by the

72
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:36,000
way, really well.

73
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:37,640
Call them just flat out for

74
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:38,390
call them.

75
00:01:38,629 --> 00:01:40,140
Digital Starbucks card.

76
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,150
This is a hack.

77
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:41,659
Okay.

78
00:01:41,659 --> 00:01:43,569
There is guaranteed deliverability

79
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:45,280
on a digital

80
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:46,650
Starbucks card email.

81
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:48,430
You will land in their primary.

82
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,420
All the cool email guys, Starbucks

83
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:51,189
has to be every

84
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:51,920
time.

85
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:52,439
Okay.

86
00:01:52,469 --> 00:01:54,430
So if you have a dream 100

87
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:56,670
deliverable document, right?

88
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:58,459
You can have a bit.ly.

89
00:01:58,459 --> 00:01:59,069
So it can be

90
00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:00,900
like bit.ly slash Patrick by

91
00:02:00,909 --> 00:02:01,469
David.

92
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:02,810
You can attach it to the

93
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,719
description of a Starbucks card

94
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:05,340
with a little

95
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:07,269
note and send them that card to

96
00:02:07,269 --> 00:02:09,199
their email and it will land as

97
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,250
guaranteed deliverability.

98
00:02:11,449 --> 00:02:11,919
If it's the

99
00:02:12,009 --> 00:02:13,370
wrong email address, it will just

100
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:14,020
bounce back.

101
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:15,319
So you can just like keep trying

102
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:16,340
different emails.

103
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:16,780
If you

104
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,129
have multiple emails for a

105
00:02:18,129 --> 00:02:19,610
prospect, this works super

106
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:20,530
freaking well.

107
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,219
So hit all channels, hit their

108
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,139
partners, not their wives, okay?

109
00:02:24,139 --> 00:02:25,710
Their partners, their business

110
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,560
partners and executive staff.

111
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,819
Join their

112
00:02:29,229 --> 00:02:30,979
coaching program, community, or

113
00:02:30,979 --> 00:02:33,080
just pay for consulting calls from

114
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:33,580
them.

115
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:35,400
Use a connection or mentorship

116
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,340
platform to guarantee connection.

117
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:38,889
Again, like Manect is fantastic

118
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:39,659
for this.

119
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,900
Intro.co, I believe, is another

120
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:43,139
one that's really good for this,

121
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:44,400
but pay someone for their time and

122
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,840
then present the deliverable to

123
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,289
them.

124
00:02:46,289 --> 00:02:46,520
It's

125
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:47,310
fantastic.

126
00:02:47,539 --> 00:02:48,849
Ask them to be on a podcast.

127
00:02:48,849 --> 00:02:50,599
If you guys have podcasts like Jax

128
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:52,400
Dwyer in here, he has a podcast

129
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:52,870
and he

130
00:02:53,009 --> 00:02:53,629
cooks with it.

131
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:55,430
Like if he just did Dream 100 all

132
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,159
day long, he could just slam this.

133
00:02:57,159 --> 00:02:57,939
Like just keep

134
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:58,550
crushing it.

135
00:02:58,550 --> 00:02:59,750
So ask them to be on a podcast.

136
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:00,969
You'll be surprised at how many

137
00:03:00,969 --> 00:03:02,060
people say yes to being on a

138
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:03,729
podcast versus yes, then hopping

139
00:03:03,729 --> 00:03:04,300
on a call.

140
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,449
It's crazy nowadays.

141
00:03:05,449 --> 00:03:06,879
So attend their events, go to

142
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:07,289
their

143
00:03:07,509 --> 00:03:08,539
events with a thumb drive and a

144
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:10,009
stack of paper or something, hand

145
00:03:10,009 --> 00:03:11,219
it to the actual person.

146
00:03:11,219 --> 00:03:13,099
You know, publicly

147
00:03:13,189 --> 00:03:13,830
post and tag them.

148
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:15,330
It's another thing, especially if

149
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:16,460
you're reaching out to like a

150
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:18,090
medium or smaller size

151
00:03:18,509 --> 00:03:19,740
influencer, they have a much

152
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,590
higher probability of looking at

153
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:23,180
what you tag them in versus like

154
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:23,280
an

155
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,009
Alex or Mosey.

156
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:25,280
LinkedIn in-mail.

157
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,099
In-mail credits have pretty much a

158
00:03:27,099 --> 00:03:29,180
guaranteed deliverability within

159
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:30,379
their inbox and email.

160
00:03:30,409 --> 00:03:31,680
So you'll basically be able to

161
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,280
reach out to somebody with in-mail

162
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:33,659
credits.

163
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,389
If you have a, I think it's a

164
00:03:35,389 --> 00:03:37,150
LinkedIn premium or it's the

165
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:39,020
LinkedIn sales navigator

166
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:39,500
subscription,

167
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:41,009
you have a certain amount of

168
00:03:41,009 --> 00:03:42,849
LinkedIn in-mail credits you can

169
00:03:42,849 --> 00:03:44,000
use per month to basically

170
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,319
guarantee

171
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:45,360
someone sees your outreach

172
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:45,830
message.

173
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,280
And then a calendar invite with

174
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,900
the deliverable description.

175
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,699
I've done this a handful of times.

176
00:03:51,699 --> 00:03:53,319
It actually gets some pretty,

177
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:55,680
pretty funny responses to it, but

178
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:56,740
literally sending someone a

179
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,080
calendar invite with a deliverable

180
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,500
in the description saying, let's

181
00:03:59,500 --> 00:03:59,819
go over

182
00:03:59,909 --> 00:04:01,449
this and like, let's fix your ads.

183
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:02,560
Let's fix your funnel.

184
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,379
And then in the description, like,

185
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:05,400
yo, I did

186
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:06,639
this for you, blah, blah, blah.

187
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:07,520
It works really good.

188
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,560
Leverage a connection with someone

189
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,400
lower than

190
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:13,240
them in the company.

191
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,689
So build a connection, leverage

192
00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:18,519
it, uh, raise up, literally fly to

193
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:18,839
the freaking

194
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:19,300
office.

195
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,519
If it's a big enough deal, of

196
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:21,699
course, it makes sense and

197
00:04:21,699 --> 00:04:23,199
monetary and logical sense to do

198
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:23,420
so.

199
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:24,730
Definitely can do it.

200
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:26,350
Uh, post grade or sendoso.

201
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,230
These are direct mail services to

202
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:28,540
use

203
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,720
deck for multiple email addresses

204
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,879
and keep cross-checking those and

205
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:34,449
sending a basic repeat the process

206
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:34,839
and

207
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,180
send it to them.

208
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,990
Send them a YouTube video

209
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,449
explaining the deliverable tag

210
00:04:40,449 --> 00:04:41,500
them in a post

211
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,430
again, or invite, uh, them to

212
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:45,240
collaborate on Instagram.

213
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:47,410
So the invite to collaborate has

214
00:04:48,069 --> 00:04:48,079
been

215
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:49,740
really good, uh, lately for some

216
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,230
people that I've explained this

217
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,040
strategy to because it actually

218
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:53,420
shows

219
00:04:53,509 --> 00:04:54,839
up in the, uh, in the primary and

220
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:56,310
in their notifications that this

221
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:57,680
person wants to collaborate

222
00:04:57,769 --> 00:04:58,720
with you on a post.

223
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,209
So it'll basically just make a

224
00:05:00,339 --> 00:05:01,740
post of you breaking down the

225
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,000
deliverable for them

226
00:05:03,089 --> 00:05:04,540
and ask that person or influencer

227
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:06,149
to collaborate with them on that

228
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:07,339
post and they'll see it.

229
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,470
Message other people at the

230
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:12,480
company with the same, um, method,

231
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,000
right?

232
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,750
So you can repeat all this

233
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:15,000
stuff for directors, managers,

234
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:16,220
executive team, et cetera.

235
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:20,459
So in essence, if you relentlessly

236
00:05:20,459 --> 00:05:20,839
follow

237
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:22,850
up multiple times through multiple

238
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,329
methods, through multiple

239
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:26,519
channels, you will get a reply one

240
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:26,660
way

241
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:28,759
I promise you that I promise you

242
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:29,189
that.

243
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:31,250
So just keep following up.

244
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:32,860
If you don't go back to your

245
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:35,209
targeting and research and find

246
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:36,610
someone bigger and more

247
00:05:36,899 --> 00:05:37,730
attractive.

248
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,819
Now, module two, let's dive into

249
00:05:39,949 --> 00:05:41,180
the path to scaling your agency

250
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:42,319
with dream 100.
