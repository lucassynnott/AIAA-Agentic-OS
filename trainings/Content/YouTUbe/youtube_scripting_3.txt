one of the things I don't like about YouTube is that it's very easy to think that you have to be a guru a guru says this is what you should do a guide says hey here's how I did it and maybe it can work for you it means that creating videos becomes a way more effortless thing you don't have to be a guru you can be a guide you got to just press record hey what's up Sean Cano here with think media in today's episode we are bringing you a clip from our recent grow with video Summit with Ali abdal where he revealed how he outlines and SC RS his videos now there's so many nuggets in this training you're going to love it and by the way if you want to jump on the wait list for the next grow with video Summit where we bring together some of today's top video experts so you can learn their secrets there's a link to join the wait list in the description down below all right let's jump into the content with Ali abdall we start off with a concept which is sort of something about selfworth going up now I need to think about title thumbnail and hook so how to raise your self worth what I'm thinking about is that is this really the best framing for this topic like what is the framing of this video that would make this have the best chance of getting views So Okay so we've got self-esteem from Psych to go watch this if you're struggling with your self worth 1.2 million views that seems promising essentially well I'll just go through YouTube and I'll think okay other than the title of how to raise yourself worth is there a better way of framing this video is it about self-esteem is it about self-worth is it about not caring what what other people think is it about how to be more confident in yourself okay how to be more confident could I frame a video about selfworth based on confidence this is sort of the thought process because you know one of the things that I've really realized about YouTube over time is that 80% of the value is in these two things literally 80% it's the concept the title and the thumbnail and the hook if you can get this stuff right it like massively increases your chances of this of this video potentially going big and potentially growing your channel which is why it's worth not just going with the first title that comes to mind how to raise yourself worth but to think about like what are the different alternative framings of this title that I could potentially do something around confidence seems to be getting more views than something around selfworth now crucially I can still make a video about selfworth but the packaging of the video is just in the initial framing of it I know I want to do a video about selfworth and if I can frame it in the language of confidence what might that look like like this is literally what we go through when we do our thingy and we think okay cool what's Point number one what's Point number two and what's Point number three okay so if I were doing this video how to raise yourself Worth or how to become more confident I would be kind of Point number one would be get out of your own way where I would say something about kind of most of the blockers that hold us back are internal blockers we think that it's actually external circumstances but actually it's internal blockers Etc that's Point number one the next thing I'm going to say is that competence equals confidence so it's very hard to have high self-worth if you've never done anything interesting some might say so competence equals confidence equals evidence and the third thing I would say is um affirmations or something I actually think affirmations are great affirmations and mantras okay good these are the only three things I'm saying in this video the video is about how to raise yourself Worth or how to be more confident or something like that I'll finalize the title get out of your own way competence equals confidence affirmations and mantras are like a nice thing to do then I have a uh video creation framework that's called the hives framework H stands for hook I stands for intro v stands for value and e s stands for end screen sales pitch if you guys don't know this already the think media gang have done some solid videos talking about this as well at the end of your videos we don't want to hear any of this that's like like comment subscribe blah blah blah as soon as the audience gets even a whiff that the video is about to end they will click off the video so we need an end screen sales pitch hey if you guys enjoyed this video you're going to love this video over here where I break down in more detail exactly how to be more confident when you're feeling awkward in social situations so check out that video right over here that's the end screen not all right guys you know this was a really hard video to make you know I really appreciate all the love I'm getting all the support I'm getting from you guys oh man I just love reading the coms comments it's so nice I hope you guys enjoy the video you know drop a comment down below and let me know what you think people are just going to turn off and you'll see your end screen like retention absolutely plummet we want an end screen sales pitch we've got we want a hook to me the hook is just the promise I think with educational content hooks are easy enough the think media YouTube channel is actually actually does a really good job of hooks we often use think media's YouTube channel as a thing uh as like an example when we teach sessions for our own YouTuber Academy cuz you guys do a really good job of you know I remember one of one of Omar videos was in this video I'm going to show you how to set up the perfect Studio setup with a budget with under $100 let's get into it it's like oh that's a nice hook Omar elor is telling me exactly what I'm getting in this video cuz essentially when someone clicks on the title in thumbnail what we're doing is we're creating an expectation in the viewer's mind so the think media video of how to set up your studio with under $100 I click on that video expecting to learn how to set up a studio for under $1100 now with educational content I can get away with my hook basically just being the title of the video so if my title of the video is how to raise your self worth or how to be more confident in this video I'm going to share my top three tips for how you can be more confident easy that's a hook that's the promise we don't need to overthink it the nice thing about educational channels is we don't need to do oh my God guys in this video we're going to give a million dollars to the person who's got the highest self-confidence and we're going to go on a trip and we're also going to do this and we're also going to that sort of stuff is kind of necessary the world of entertainment thankfully it's not massively uh necessary in the world of Education if what you have to say is sufficiently valuable so the hook is just the promise in this video we're going to go over three tips that you can use to level up your selfworth and your confidence especially in situations where you're struggling next up we have an intro now the intro is optional but if there's only one thing that you take away from this talk I would recommend you figure out what your intro would be you don't have to include an intro in every video but I personally think it's a good idea an intro is who are you and why should the audience care who are you and why should the audience care in my humble opinion the point of the intro is to explain who you are welcome the audience to your channel and give them a sense of your credibility what is interesting about you that would you know audiences are paying for your video they're not paying with their dollars they're paying with their time and their attention which is even more valuable than money so what is it about you that is that is deserving of their time and attention you can do that within your intro so for example for me seven years ago I started make making videos aimed at medical school applicants in the UK and so I would say hey guys welcome back to the channel if you're new here my name is Ali I'm a final gear medical student at Cambridge University and in this video I'm going to talk about how to do your interview prep if you're applying to med school the fact that I'm a final year medical student at Cambridge University is a massive flex and it's social proof and it's credibility and it's like oh this guy knows his stuff that's why he's is talking about this I was giving a talk yesterday um at this sort of marketing conference and I called on someone in the audience and she makes videos about public speaking and she has been a public speaking coach for 10 years and has had 30 years of experience as a singer songwriter traveling around the world and doing performances in public so her intro should be like hey everyone my name is Lisa I've I spent 30 years touring the world as a single songwriter and so I'm very familiar with the stage and I've been coaching public speaking for the last 10 years that's why in this video we're going to be talking about public speaking blah blah blah blah blah blah it is so much easier to grow a YouTube channel when you actually have some real world credibility for the thing that you trying to teach in the world of Education yes you could be a 17-year-old life coach if you really want to but it's very hard to grow a YouTube channel as a 17-year-old life coach if anyone here is over the age of 30 like me I turned 30 like a couple weeks ago you're actually at an advantage in educational content because a lot of YouTubers are targeting people who are kids they want to go for the views they're playing The Fame game they're like oh I want my videos to go viral but really videos go viral when they appeal to young people and if your Channel or your business and ideally both appeals to people who are slightly older people in their 30s 40s or 50s people in their 30s tend to have money people in their teens and 20s tend to be broke it is very difficult to build a business catering to broke people it's a lot easier to build a business catering to people who actually have money so your intro I think should be some sort of thing that like explains who you are and why you are credible so for for example self-worth and confidence here is what I would do hook in this video we're going to talk about my top three tips for raising your selfworth so that you can be more confident in any situation hey friends welcome back to the channel if you're new here my name is Ali I'm a doctor turned entrepreneur and I'm the author of The New York Times bestseller Feelgood productivity Flex flex and you know I've been making YouTube videos now for 7 years and in that time I've made over 900 YouTube videos now when I started out I was super unconfident I had very low self-worth I had imposter syndrome all the time and now 7 years later I've learned so much along the way and I've learned all these strategies and tools that I can I can use to be more confident and now I feel like I genuinely do love myself I genuinely have high selfworth and I get invited to give talks and do stuff live and it's just super fun and so in this video I really want to share everything I've learned along the way hook intro and why why am the person to do this crucially you don't need to have you don't need to have major Flex credentials one major kind of Flex one major credential you could have is just the fact that you used to struggle with the thing and now you don't struggle with it anymore so you have learned something along the way it's one of the things I don't like about YouTube is that it's very easy to think that you have to be a guru a guru is someone who has all the answers but I don't like being a guru I prefer to be a guide a guru says this is what you should do a guide says hey here's how I did it and maybe it can work for you you don't have to be a guru you can be a guide so if you like me and you struggle with being a guru and like you look at I don't know clickfunnel sales pages and stuff and you think oh it's a bit much it feels too salesy don't worry you don't have to be a guru you can just be a guide and so reiterating in your intro that actually this topic is this thing that you've learned about is something you have personal experience in that can really help help viewers feel more relaxed feel more like they can trust you and it's a thing that you can just do for any video then you give them the value which is 0.1 point2 and3 and then you give them the end screen sales page and now the video is done and honestly this is the level of prep I do for most of my videos 0.1 point two and3 maybe I'll write it out notion of it maybe I'll add a few bullet points to be like okay competence equals confidence maybe I want to site this study um I think I I'll use uh bandura's um self-efficacy because I'm I'm familiar with the research around it maybe I can talk about my book there yep cool that's fine affirmations and mantras I can talk about manifestation and how that works um I can talk about um HEBs law in neur signs that neurons that fire together wire together and so actually if you repeat something often enough to yourself you genuinely start to believe the thing okay cool yep I can talk about that so that makes it a bit juicier and getting out of your own way internal blockers well h i can talk about how 80% of all issues are emotional issues when it comes to business when it comes to YouTube when it comes to anything I don't really have any data for that stat but that's fine and okay cool yep I'm ready to film the video this is literally the process that I use to make videos and this is what I've been doing for the last 900 plus videos on my channel over the last 7 years Years cuz I found that when I have to spend freaking ages trying to research the topic it takes the joy out of it it makes it take way too long and ideally I would like to make a YouTube channel that is a guide it's not a guru a guide doesn't need to do research a guide can just say hey I've done this thing and here's what I've learned along the way and I hope you find it useful this is hook intro value and Screen sales pitch this is the method that I use to try and kind of be more consistent and
