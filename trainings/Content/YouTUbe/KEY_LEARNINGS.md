# Key Learnings: YouTube Scriptwriting

## Core Philosophy
1.  **Reality > Expectations**: The viewer clicks with an expectation. The video must deliver *more* value than expected to retain them.
2.  **Guide vs. Guru**: Don't preach ("You must do X"). Share experience ("Here is how I did X").
3.  **Speed to Value**: Online video is a race. Deliver value immediately. No long intros.
4.  **Anti-Fragile Scripts**: Write more than you need. Build modular sections that can be moved or deleted without breaking the flow.

## The 5-Step Framework
1.  **Packaging**: Defined BEFORE scripting. Title + Thumbnail Concept + Idea.
2.  **Outline**: Bullet points of value. 2nd best point goes FIRST. Best point goes SECOND.
3.  **Intro**: The "Stickiness" phase.
4.  **Body**: The "Value" phase.
5.  **Outro**: The "Conversion" phase.

## The Hook Framework (Intro)
1.  **Immediate Context**: Confirm they clicked the right video.
2.  **Common Belief**: State what most people think.
3.  **Contrarian Take**: State the truth/insight loop.
4.  **Credibility**: Why listen to you? (Results, experience, research).
5.  **The Plan**: Briefly state what will be covered.

## Retention Tactics
-   **Atomic Messaging**: Use 6th-grade vocabulary. Simple words, short sentences.
-   **Re-Hooking**: Every few minutes, re-state the value of what's coming next to prevent drop-off.
-   **Pattern Recognition**: Showing the 2nd best point first creates a pattern of increasing value.
-   **Native Embeds**: Weave CTAs into the content as solutions, not interruptions.

## The "No-Goodbye" Outro
-   Never signal the end ("That's it for today", "In conclusion").
-   Transition directly from the last point to the next recommended video.
-   "Now that you know X, you need Y, which is in this video..."

## AI Scripting (CGP Framework)
-   **Context**: Who you are, what the style is.
-   **Goal**: What the video should achieve (retention, education).
-   **Prompt**: The specific command.
-   *Tip*: Feed AI "Project Knowledge" including avatar details, philosophy, and personal stories.
