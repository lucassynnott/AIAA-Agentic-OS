social media platforms to grow on right now is LinkedIn and before you write it off let me explain why LinkedIn is one of the best social media platforms to grow on right now LinkedIn is classified as

content that is any good I mean I scroll on LinkedIn and the content I see looks like it comes from an obituary it's super dry and super boring this means that there's way less competition and room for growth right now on LinkedIn before people catch on and Linkedin also has the highest average household net worth amongst all the other social media platforms with the average household income being $124,000 a year and Instagram coming in second place with only $664,000 per year which means people have more money to buy your products your services your own F now that you know that LinkedIn

your beautiful face from the chest up and this will ensure that you are easily seen on the feed and help you stand out people connect with faces so make sure you have a good picture of your beautiful beautiful face now for your LinkedIn bio just use this simple formula use two to three keywords related to your Niche or what you talk about and then have a benefit oriented value proposition for example if I was a social media media Ghost Writer I might use the bio social media marketing and writing I help Founders grow their personal brand by thousands of followers every month on LinkedIn now for your LinkedIn Banner just create a simplistic design on canva or figma and summarize your value proposition or anything that kind of shows your competence within your Niche now for your LinkedIn about section talk about your experience and your credibility within your field now if you don't have much experience with the topics you're talking about just write a few sentences about what you're currently working on and what goals you're pursuing and finally we have the LinkedIn featured section so this is the section that is underneath your bio and here is where you can link a few different websites or newsletters that you want to promote and this is going to drive a lot more traffic to it because when someone goes to your profile they're going to see your featured section and you can plug your website a paid Consulting call your newsletter or anything else and you're going to get a lot more clicks on it cuz you're increasing that visibility now that you have your LinkedIn profile set up it's time for the fun part so for the third step on how to grow on LinkedIn fast you're going to generate content ideas and the key to growing on social media is creating relevant content for your audience and since most people on LinkedIn are professionals actionable content that solves their pinpoints is what resonates best if you're a writer post writing tips to grow on LinkedIn if you're a marketer post marketing tips to grow on LinkedIn if you're a fitness account post fitness tips to grow on LinkedIn and if you need help with generating ideas on what to post on LinkedIn go to chat GPT and type in the following prompt my target audience is describe your target audience give me a list of their 25 most common pain points reverse each of these pain points into howto statements I can turn into actionable pieces of content now chaty PT will give you a huge list of ideas you can turn into content and since these ideas are focused on your target audience's pain points they'll be more interested in consuming your content once you have a Content idea research and write all the steps required to solve that paino and talk about what the point is why it's important and how to apply it but if you really want to boost your content's reach and engagement it's important you follow this next step step four to growing on LinkedIn fast is to turn your content into carousels and Linkedin carousels are when you take the content you've written and put them on a group of sexy looking images and this catches more attention and gets favored by the algorithm to create a LinkedIn Carousel all you need to do is type in LinkedIn Carousel templates into Google and you'll get access to a bunch of free ones you can use on the design platforms canva or figma now once you pick a template that you like insert your content on top of the carousel images and the first Carousel should have a big eye-catching headline that teases what your whole post is about and keep it simplistic and tease a benefit or how to solve the pain point that you're talking about and for each of the LinkedIn Carousel slides after the first one they should have a dedicated slide for each step or each tip and at the end of the carousel use a call to action to tell people to follow you and once you've created your Carousel you'll then need to upload it to LinkedIn and all you have to do is download the carousels as a PNG file and once you do that go go to png2 pdf.com on Google and convert your carousel into a PDF then go to Linked In click on start a new post upload a document and select your PDF but don't post it before doing this next step so this will help bring in a ton more followers and this is a step that most people skip but before I reveal that if you're enjoying this content leave a like it helps me out a ton with the videos and it costs you nothing and if you're a creator entreprene rur or writer looking to make money online click the Subscribe button I drop videos every week on audience building making money online and cheesy self- Improvement videos all right back to the regular scheduled programming the fifth step to growing on LinkedIn fast is to post a transformation story and a transformation story is how you went from one paino to a desired outcome so this can be fat to fit dumb to wise poor to wealthy or it can be a simple realization you had that changed your perspective on something and the point is to tell a story we want to tell stories because this gives your LinkedIn content depth this connects you with your reader and it separates you from everybody else so in the description of your Carousel post you're going to follow this simple fep story framework the hook so this is a sentence or two that captures people's attention the inciting incident so this is what sparked the change the journey so you're going to talk about what challenges you faced the support so you're going to acknowledge people or resources that supported you during this period and then finally the outcome so you're going to talk about the transformation you went through and the lesson learned it doesn't have to be super long just try to hit each of these points and mention any keywords that are related to what the post is about and this will help you rank better in the algorithm so your post is ready but it's going to fail miserably unless you follow this next step so the sixth step to growing on LinkedIn fast is to get traffic to your profile you can have the best content in the world but if nobody sees it it is practically useless when I say traffic I'm referring to eyeballs people seeing your content so more traffic equals more followers so there are three ways you can get more traffic on LinkedIn and these all involve commenting because when a LinkedIn account comments on your post a fraction of Their audience will be shown your post so the first way to get comments on your post is to comment on other people's posts and this method is free and one of the best ways to make a name for yourself on LinkedIn so here's how to do it so you're going to find 10 to 50 accounts with over a th000 followers within your Niche you're going to bookmark their profile and check their feed daily and then you're going to comment on their latest post with something insightful that adds to what they're saying and you're going to repeat this daily and many of the people you comment on will begin commenting on your post in return as well some of their followers will see your comments and check out your profile now the second method to getting more traffic to your LinkedIn profile is through an engagement group and this method is when you find 5 to 10 other creators on LinkedIn who are trying to grow and create a group chat where you trade comments with each other's posts and I suggest doing this on a platform other than LinkedIn because this is against their terms of service so this method works well because the more everyone in your engagement group grows the bigger the effect it has now the third method to getting more traffic to your LinkedIn profile costs money but it is one of the best ways to grow and this method is when you pay for comments from Big accounts so some of the bigger creators on LinkedIn will sell comments to people looking to grow and this can get you a ton of exposure on your post and grow you rapidly if your content is good and most people don't advertise that they sell comments on LinkedIn so it can take a little bit of time to find people but typically there'll be people creating content consistently and have over 50,000 followers you can shoot them a DM and ask if that's something they offer the final step to growing on LinkedIn fast is to follow best practices so out of respect of your time I'm just going to summarize them really quickly so you're going to comment 10 to 25 times a day this will build your network and help you form valuable relationships with other people which will help you grow you're going to post 3 to seven times a day so follow a posting schedule you can stay consistent with while not burning out the key is consistency three you're going to post in the morning so most people check LinkedIn in the morning and on their lunch break I post around 8:00 a.m. EST as well weekdays are typically the best days to post LinkedIn is a work platform so people are mainly browsing it during work hours and weekends are typically the worst days to post it is really sad if you are browsing LinkedIn on the weekend you need you need a life now there's also an option to get endorsements on LinkedIn endorsements are when people write a small blurb on your profile where they praise you and just give you credibility to what you're talking about so if you can try to get at least five people people you know to give you endorsements on LinkedIn this will add to your credibility and help increase your LinkedIn follower conversion and there you have it boys and girls how to grow on LinkedIn fast now this is just one piece of the puzzle if you want to make money and hit 10,000 $50,000 or even $100,000 a month online
