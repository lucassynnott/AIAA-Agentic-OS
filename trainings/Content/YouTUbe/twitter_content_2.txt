if it feels like the X algorithm is ignoring your small account that might be because well it actually is but there is a simple way that you can change that in fact it is this one change that allowed me to get out of beginner hell to consistently gain thousands of followers every month creators sitting at over 100,000 followers still make this a consistent Habit to keep their engagement high now before I reveal this habit let's break down how the X algorithm Works in 2024 since Elon must took over to set now X he's made some huge changes and that's not just to the name he's changed everything from The Branding to what type of content is favored on there the algorithm will always prioritize high quality content and that is highly actionable advice that is Well written but the changes that he's recently made has made it so that images and video are more favored there in 2024 misinformation is now highly downgraded along with any lowquality content that's got grammatical errors in it because Elon wants to keep the level of information High to attract new users but what does this mean for new users well if you're starting off from zero you're trying to get your first 1,000 followers and that is always one of the hardest things to do because you could have the greatest content in the world but it doesn't matter if nobody sees it and if no one sees your content then you're just not going to grow the way you get your posts to show up on other people's timelines is based on the amount of Engagement you get and if you've got a small audience with small amounts of followers you're just not going to get that much engagement it is just not possible to grow an audience on your content alone and the best and most efficient way to grow is to reply to other people's posts and steal Their audience if the Creator then engages with your comment or even repost the comment itself then other people will see it too when you engage with others you build a community around you and social media is about being socialable so if you build other people up then it's more likely that they're going to do the same for you it makes other accounts feel valued and it's just great Karma as you're supporting them they're more likely to support you as well this is networking 101 algorithm then reacts to your replies and comments and sees you as somebody who is active and then you'll get a boost in the app but how do you actually do it and become a grade a reply guy well the best way is to make a couple of lists of sizes of accounts that are similar to yours one small one medium and then one of the biggest creators in your Niche then you're going to go and set time aside and be sociable and I'm going to show you you exactly what you need to do so we go to lists then we would click new list and then type out the name engagement 101 Then type people I want to reply to so the main thing that you do here is to click make private because what you don't want to do is alert people that you're adding to this list now from this one you just add people you can have your friends you can just type them in so I'll put some people who I know and once you've added the correct people just press done and then it'll populate it with a list of people and so when I go on to X next time all I do is just click on lists and then go to my the list that I've created that way I don't need to be on the timeline now you're going to go through and pick some specific tweets to reply to so this one is a good one here what advice would you give people who want to have more self-confidence so I know I can reply to that I would like janik's tweet then I would put something like okay so that's a good reply answering the question you're liking the post you're adding to the conversation positively hopefully that is a positive interaction that someone will see then they will go on my profile then if they liked what they read and they liked things like the pin tweet and the banner then they would click that follow button now we're going to do it just by scrolling the timeline so I'm just going to go through here and read something that I'd want to engage with okay so we found a post here from Charles Miller the best content formula so he's got a nice post and I'm just going to support it because this is great information so I am going to save it so saved and then I'm going to add something to the post so that it's not just staying well done so I'm going to reply in that way now we're going to go to Charles Miller's page because one of the best ways to learn how to reply is to actually go to somebody who has a big following and look at how they actually reply them so here's a good example of a reply from Charles so Cooper here has written out a 7-Day blueprint she's taken a lot of time to create this and Charles has specifically taken a quote from this person 's post and put it down below and he's added in his reply specifically why he agrees with this point so analyze and adjust that's where most people mess up they set it and forget it instead of making is better one test at a time so he's not only supported and been positive with this person's post he's added his own little bit of insight and his own little bit of advice as well great reply okay so the better way to engage to keep you off the timeline of X is to use hype Fury I'm going to click on engagement Builder so what you can do is you can have SE terms or you can make a list of watched users also down the bottom here you can have some Search terms so say if you in sales or you were in email marketing or just Marketing in general you could just type out marketing and then you would have some relevant posts that would come through specifically for your chosen terms or you can have a Twitter list that you have written in X and you can just drag it in so once we've added a couple of people that we want to engage with then we'd go back to where we were and we would just scroll through and do it directly in the app so I found a post that I want to engage with this one's from yanque problem about hooks is lots of people don't like the feeling of being hooked they just want the story so if you can just give people what they want a great story without fluff I'm going to reply with a bit of a joke because I know yanque and I just wanted to be funny so I'd like it and then I'd click reply so you can just do this through Hy Fury as long as you want collect people make sure that you're engaging with them every day say if you did 10 to 20 5 people all in your list that you've created that way engagement will be built and you'll get people coming to your profile another great habit will be to direct message creators as well this builds a fan base and builds some great connections and if somebody knows what it is you're building then when they see it on the timeline they're more likely to engage with it by the way the piece of software that I've just shown you is called hide Fury not only can you engage with lists on the account you can schedule months of content in advance so that you you don't have to spend hours glue to your phone every day now that you've seen the software to schedule post how do you come up with new viral ideas well if you head on over to this video here I'll show you exactly how see you in the next one
