really cool tools that'll make everything 10 times easier for your LinkedIn Journey now quick disclaimer before we start this is not for people who do not have a skill that helps people solve problems or achieve desired outcomes this strategy is specifically for Freelancers business owners coaches or anyone else with a skill that solves other people's problems and if you do not have a skill that's useful to other people you can just leave this video now and go to Tik Tok that leave LinkedIn for for the skilled people so the first step to Growing your LinkedIn following is to optimize your profile because if your LinkedIn profile isn't organized optimized and easy to understand it won't matter how many people view your profile they're not going to convert to followers or clients so there are three things someone needs to understand when viewing your LinkedIn profile number one who you are number two what you do number three the benefit of following you if you don't answer these three questions within a few seconds people will exit your profile without following you and worst of all never becoming a client but if you invest the time to set up these five parts of your LinkedIn profile just once you're going to increase the number of followers you get forever now going from the least important to the most important tips for optimizing your LinkedIn profile let's go into number one so we want to build relatability and connect with potential followers on a deeper level and this is something many people skip or screw up and can be the difference between building a following and building d my hard fans what I'm referring to is the about section the about section of your LinkedIn is the part where you share a bit about yourself and bonus points if you can tell that I'm Canadian and this is the perfect chance to build relatability and position yourself as an authority rather than some random stranger on social media so for your about section I recommend sharing a transformation Story related to your career or your profession and if you want a simple framework to follow just use my star framework so I will break down each part of the star framework and give you a real example of how one of my coaching clients Nicholas used all this so the s in the star framework stands for situation this part gives context on a problem you faced by starting with a problem you hook readers in right away and you're going to build relatability with them so for example my client Nicholas started his about section with the following lines my life changed the day I got the call until September 2022 I thought I had made it I got into bioengineering at one of Portugal's top universities all the years of late nights and hard work finally paid off but one day the phone rang it was our landlord his voice was cold and final I want you out as soon as the contract ends now the te in the star framework stands for task this part is where you explain the task you set out to complete to overcome your challenge so this pushes the story forward and shows people how you started your journey to get where you are today for example here's how Nicholas continued his story in his about section so with no money and new Skyhigh rents I was left in a pit of anxiety with a little savings and skyrocketing rents my mother and I were soon going to be homeless my grades once a source of Pride began to plummet anxiety and despair took hold I was on the verge of depression faced with no other choice I took the biggest bet of my life I was going to go all in on learning how to make money online I didn't want the lambo or the fancy roll out I just wanted to make money so me and my mother could survive now the third part of the star framework stands for Action in this part you want to describe the actions you took to achieve your task you want to highlight any struggles you face so doing this will build relatability with your audience back to the example with Nicholas so with zero idea what I was doing I decided to hire a business Mentor I had been following on social media for a little over a year I was going to build my personal brand and learn how to get paid to write online as a ghost writer I knew the next few months would determine whether one my mother and I would have a roof over our head or two my mother and I would be begging the streets just to get by so I went 100% in I quit college I drained my savings I even took out a loan so I could afford the mentorship starting from zero I faced many challenges months of no income feeling like I didn't belong wondering if I'd ever make it now the fourth part of the star framework stands for result share the result results of your actions and the transformation that occurred so this closes the loop you created from your story at the start and it's a great way to show your Authority and build credibility so for example with Nicholas once again but through many failures and lessons I slowly got better each day I went from zero followers to growing by over 30 followers a day I went from being a nobody to talking with high value entrepreneurs daily but most importantly I started making enough money to pay for rent and put food on our table now you're about sectioning is great for building authority and deeper connections with potential followers but what about turning people into clients and customers well just like putting a good billboard in front of a busy highway this next tip will get more eyeballs on your offer on LinkedIn so what I'm referring to is the linkedin's featured section in your featured section you can pin a LinkedIn post a newsletter an article and documents but what I recommend above all of these is to link directly to a lead Magnet or direct ly to your offer and this can be a link to your website your newsletter or anything else designed to convert people into clients and customers now most people screw the featured section up because they just add a link and think that's enough to get attention on their offer or lead magnet but this is about as enticing as putting whipped cream on dog [ __ ] so you need to add some Pizzazz and make your featured section attention grabbing so you can do this by doing two things number one is add a thumbnail so your thumbnail picture should be so simple that a potato could understand what you're offering and benefit so don't over complicate it for example my LinkedIn featured sections thumbnail is a picture of text this text has three parts it calls out who I'm targeting creators coaches and business owners it calls out a desirable outcome of my target audience so attract quality followers and clients and then I use a call to action so click here to get my free social media course this way anyone who fits my criteria and is interested in the outcome are much more likely to click the link because it's tailored to them that way I'm filtering the people I want to attract and filtering out the people I don't want to attract the second part to making your featured section more attention grabbing is to make your title clear so the title is the text that appears on the right side of the image so keep it simple and state what you're offering in my case my title says get my free personal branding course you also have the option to add a description to your featured section but I recommend leaving it blank when you write a description it'll add another step before taking people to your offer or your link and if you leave the description blank it'll only take one click so it's a small detail but reducing the friction can increase conversions now moving on to the third part of optimizing your LinkedIn profile this is one of the most viewed parts of your LinkedIn profile and can be a great way to instantly set good Impressions with people viewing your profile I'm talking about your LinkedIn banner and this is the wide picture that shows up at the very top of your profile so it gets a lot of attention so your LinkedIn Banner is a great way to show people what value you provide and make them aware of what actions you want them to take so I recommend having three things in your LinkedIn Banner so number one your value proposition two social proof three a call to action for example I show my value proposition improve your writing and build your personal brand I share social proof being featured on Forbes and other notable platforms and I have a call to action in the top left of the corner I tell people to get my free course in the featured section and this is optional but I also call out my target audience in my banner so creators coaches and business owners so to create your banner you can use a software like canva or figma they got a ton of templates they're great easy to use and past there's a fly I'm going to get that [ __ ] leave that in the but the easiest route is to find a designer on fiverr.com and pay someone to make it for you now the fourth part of optimizing your LinkedIn profile is to create a bio AKA your headline so there are four questions your bio should answer number one what do you do number two who do you help number three why should I care number four why should I trust you for example my LinkedIn bio currently says I help business owners attract High ticket clients with their personal brand multi7 figures in results for 150 plus clients get my free personal brand branding course so right away you know one what I do I monetize personal Brands two who I help I help business owners three the benefit get more high-paying clients and four why I'm credible multi7 figures and results for 150 plus clients so when a stranger visits my profile they have a well-rounded idea of who I am and why they should follow me now the fifth and arguably the most important part of optimizing your LinkedIn profile is your beautiful your beautiful beautiful face I'm referring to your LinkedIn profile picture your profile picture is literally the face of your brand it's one of the first things people see when you leave a comment or you make a post and if your profile picture looks low quality or unprofessional they're unlikely to click on your profile so to optimize your LinkedIn profile picture there are three tips I recommend following number one highquality pictur so using lowquality pictures will signal that you are not serious about social media and people will associate that with your content also most people on LinkedIn have crappy photos so it's an easy easy easy way to stand out from everybody so make sure to use a quality phone camera or a DSLR camera to take your picture and more importantly use good lighting it will make a huge difference in how the quality of your photos turn out so you can use Google or YouTube on how to set up lighting do that later tip number two is positioning so since profile pictures appear small on the LinkedIn timeline anything other than a picture of your face won't be that visible so make sure to avoid full body pictures and have your face make up most of your profile picture A good rule of thumb is to not have your profile picture show anything below the chest tip number three is the background so if you have a lot going on in the background of your photo it's going to make it hard to see you you're not going to stand out so I recommend having a solid or blurry background so your face stands out and bonus points if you have a colored background that makes you pop more you're going to get more attention and then examples of great LinkedIn profile pictures include my client Mike my client Nick and my client Farooq and if you don't have access to a highquality camera you can use an AI software called insta head shot.com to turn your selfies into professionall looking business head shot so we've covered how to optimize your LinkedIn profile now it's time to move on to the fun part content creation so I'm going to show you the exact system to follow so you're never wondering what to post so in this phase I'm going to cover number one what types of posts to create to make people know like and trust you and ultimately buy from you number two my plug andplay chat gbd system for generating endless content ideas and number three the simple framework I use to structure post and real quick if you're liking this video so far can you take 69 milliseconds to leave a like on this video it's free and it really helps me grow my YouTube channel and create more videos like this one all right so whether you're trying to get your first 10,000 or get your next 100,000 followers on LinkedIn you don't want to just build a following you want to build a following of people that know like and trust you because when people know like and trust you they're invested in you as a person which leads to much higher engagement more clients and more sales now the way we get people to know like and trust us is by using my Gap framework this framework focuses on creating three types of content so the G in the Gap framework stands for growth content this is the content that gets people to know about you so if you're trying to grow on LinkedIn especially at the start this content can be a GameChanger just like that light that went out growth content consists of topics that are top of mind for people so things like Trends current events well-known people and companies so since these topics are top of Mind people are much more likely to consume your content because they have a higher interest in it also social media algorithms promote this content more so for example one of my clients Farooq made one piece of growth content and went from a couple hundred followers to over 1,300 followers gaining a total of 900 followers in under 24 hours so to do this he made a breakdown of how to write Hooks and grow on LinkedIn but not in any ordinary way he made a post breaking down how one of the biggest and most popular LinkedIn accounts Laura Costa writes her hooks so he used a well-known name on the platform to capture attention and delivered actionable insights to convert that attention into followers but you can also create growth content about current events and trends for example if my LinkedIn account is centered around the topic of markeet marting when it's closer to Christmas and I wanted to take advantage of current events near Christmas time I could break down the best Christmas ads and why they worked or if I'm a LinkedIn account centered around the topic of AI and I wanted to take advantage of the trends when Chachi BT releases a new update I could make a breakdown showing how to use that new feature so in both cases I'm finding what's top of mine for my target audience and delivering valuable insights now this next piece of the Gap framework is the part most people screw up and it's the reason why people fail to build an audience and more importantly get clients on LinkedIn so what I'm referring to is the a in the Gap framework and the a stands for Authority content so when you create Authority content you position yourself as an authority in your Niche shocking I know so when you have authority people trust you more which leads to more followers and ultimately more clients and customers now it's important to keep in mind the sole reason people follow you on LinkedIn is because they're selfish meaning if they don't benefit from your content then it's going to be almost impossible to grow so you need to create actionable content that is useful to your target audience so you do this by understanding what your target audience's pain points and desired outcomes are and creating content that helps solve those problems and moves them closer to a desired outcome which I will show you how to do in a little bit because when people see you and your content as the bridge between their pain point and desired outcome you are useful and therefore Valu so there are a few ways to create Authority content one case studies two lessons and tips three step-by step how to guid an example of a case study would be when I was trying to get clients for my social media ghost training cohort and I wanted to attract people who wanted to make money creating content for other people so my target audience at the time were people working 9 to-5 jobs they hated and they wanted to live a life of freedom and doing work that they enjoyed so I made a case study of how I helped a former client ton Simmons go from a college professor making $42,000 a year to hitting 70k months as a social media Ghost Writer so in that piece of content I shared actionable steps on how is helping him each part of his journey and this showed my expertise and gave a ton of value which built Trust and helps me generate over 100 leads for my coaching program and then there are the lessons and tips format so a good example of this would be a post from one of my clients magdalina she's a holistic health coach for women so she made a post sharing three life lessons from 3,639 hours of yoga practice and finally there are the stepbystep howtos and these are different from lessons and tips lessons and tips have no specific specific order while step by-step how two guides need to be followed from the first step to the last step to achieve the desired outcome an example of this can be seen once again from my client Farooq in this post he shares a step-by-step guide on how he got 65,000 Impressions 900 followers and 700 reactions from one post and this got a few hundred more followers from that post alone now it's not enough to create growth and Authority content to stand over from everyone else on LinkedIn and grow way faster you need the last piece of the Gap framework because people are going to plagiarize your LinkedIn content AI generated content will continue to flood LinkedIn and more creators will join LinkedIn and become competitors and the only thing that can't be copied or replaced is who you are so the last pillar in the Gap framework is personal content personal content is the stuff that makes you unique and connects you with your LinkedIn audience so things like your stories your worldviews and your vulnerabilities just don't be like this CEO and post a picture of yourself crying and write about how bad you feel for laying off a bunch of employees this just super cringe as a better example in my LinkedIn content I share stuff about me like I grew up without a father because he was a crack addict I lost my mother to a fentanyl laced crack overdose when I was 19 I was made fun of for being a fat kid I was working jobs I hated as an electrician security guard medic server um my struggles with video game addiction and overeating so in a world of copypaste creators you will instantly stand out and create a connection when you show your humanity and who you are so you go from just another social media account to a living breathing an occasionally awkward person so think of personal content like the secret sauce in your grandma's legendary recipes you know sure everyone can make spaghetti but only grandma has that special something that keeps people coming back for more and that's you the Irreplaceable ingredient no cannibal jokes please so now that you know what type of content to create for LinkedIn how do you go about generating good content ideas so you're not just staring at a blank screen for hours wondering what to post on LinkedIn well my friend I made a simple chat gbt system that builds off the Gap frame work and helps you generate endless content ideas within minutes but before I show you this cool fancy high-tech system if you're liking this video so far can you take a second to leave a comment on what your number one goal is with social media right now this gives me a better idea of what content to create for you in the future and this video literally did I wasn't joking this literally did take me over 25 hours to write out and it really helps me grow my YouTube channel when I get comments so that is also appreciated all right so for the AI system I'm going to read out the four prompts you need to enter into chat gbt word for word the only thing you need to do differently is fill in the brackets with your specific details at the parts I tell you to all right so enter the first prompt into chaty BT please read this and once you understand reply with the word yes a personal brand that grows on social media has three elements I call the Gap framework the gap framework consists of growth content Authority content personal content when you create these three types of content it Bridges the Gap from a stranger to a dieh hard fan it's broken down like this growth content is when you talk about Trends popular figures worldwide events this leverages people's interest and driv traffic to your profile for example if I was a fitness coach when chat GPT was trending I could create content on how to use chat gbt to create a nutrition plan or I could break down Arnold Schwarzenegger's workout routine since people in your Niche have an interest in your growth content you're talking about you're going to get more interest and reach the a in the Gap framework is Authority content this is the content that shows your competence at what your account is centered around so things like content that shows people how to solve their pain points or reach their goals lessons and tips case studies when you create this type of content you incentivize people to follow you because you're actively helping the market by giving actual information the third pillar of the Gap framework is personal cont content personal content is when you talk about things that make you unique your personal stories your personal worldviews your personal opinions on life or the industry you're in when you create personal content you build a deep connection with your audience and more importantly you build an audience of true fans who adore you reply with yes once you read and understand this after you've entered that first prompt I know it's big but you you enter it that's what she said um enter the following prompt into chat gbt here is some information about me Authority list out as many bullet points on your accomplishments your social proof and results you've gotten for yourself or your clients and then you're going to say personal to chat gbt and then you're going to list out as many bullet points on your personal World Views your opinions controversial takes and interesting things you've experienced and then you're going to tell it once you understand reply with yes after that's done you're going to enter the third prompt into chat GPT my target audience is and insert details about who your target audience is so gender age occupation goals pain points typical day in the life current situation anything to give it more details on your target audience then say once you understand reply with yes and finally enter the fourth prompt into chat gbt my goal is to create content for social media that makes my target audience know like and trust me using the Gap framework please ask me 25 questions for each category of the Gap framework that does this you can use the information I gave you about me to help but feel free to ask questions outside that the questions asked should set me up so I can answer them with a sound bite that is under 60 seconds and boom you're done so once you get that done you're going to have 75 personal questions that chaty BT will ask you and you're going to have a ton of ideas for your LinkedIn content and the best part is that you can tell Chi to ask you as many more questions as you want and you can also give it feedback and tell it to ask you more questions based on a specific topic or ask questions that'll help you generate more ideas for Content that will get a specific result like more clients that way you're using AI to help you right but not making you sound like a robot by having it right for you so now that you know what to create content about The Logical next question is how should you write the content and write it in a way that gets attention engagement and grows your social media because let's face it school kind of us it taught us one use big words to try to sound smart two prioritize quantity of words over quality three write about topics you're not interested in and four make your writing sound like a boring Ted Talk and if you write like this on LinkedIn your posts are going to sound like all the cringe Founders on there and your posts are going to flop because they're going going to be boring and hard to read so I'm going to show you my favorite writing framework that saves you hours of time takes out all the guess work and doesn't require you to be a talented writer and I've written tens of thousands of social media posts for myself and my clients but this writing framework is the one I keep coming back to because it keeps producing the most viral content so first I think of a transformation my target audience wants for example in this video my target audience wants to go from no or slow follower growth on LinkedIn to having a consistent framework to follow for growing their LinkedIn following I then make a bullet point list of all the steps someone would need to take to go from their paino to their desired outcome so for this video it's the seven steps I listed out at the start now once I have all the bullet points listed I go through each one and apply my writing framework and I call this the what why how framework so whether it's short for form or long form content you can create persuasive writing by answering three simple questions number one what is the main idea you're trying to get across number two why should the reader care and number three how can the reader take action on what you are saying for example in each step of this YouTube video I've answered what the step was why the reader should care and how the reader can take action I guess Watcher Sorry by answering these three questions you cut the fluff and you deliver useful content and when your content is useful it translates to more followers and more clients but you're not done yet just because your LinkedIn post is useful it doesn't mean people are going to read it so think of your content like one cardboard box in a big pile of other boxes so your box should contain the most valuable LinkedIn content but if it looks plain and boring people will scroll past and consume your competitors content or some random CEO crying so that's where packaging comes in your packaging is like colorful shiny wrapping paper with a big red bow on it that makes your content stand out from everyone else's so there are two parts of packaging so the first part is the hook the hook is the first thing someone sees or hears with your content so the first sentence they read if it's written the first words they hear if it's video or the first image they see if it's a picture so when it comes to written post you need to think about your first sentence very very carefully for example let's pretend I'm a fitness coach I'll list out eight potential Hooks and give examples for each one so I can number one I can call out my target audience for example if you're a business owner struggling to find time and exercise read this number two I can call out a paino of my target audience if you struggle to sleep 8 hours a night read this number three I can call out a desired outcome of my target audience do this for the next 6 weeks to get a six-pack before summer number four I can use numbers here are three simple exercises you can do at home to burn belly fat in just 15 minutes a day number five I can ask an interesting question did you know you can eat pizza and still lose weight let me explain number six I can start in the middle of an interesting part of a story for example after 6 months of constant drinking and Bing eating I couldn't believe what I saw in the mirror dot dot dot got to have the dot dot dot makes it really really interesting and number seven challenge a common belief my target audience has so you've been lied to if you think you need to do cardio to lose weight here's why and then finally number eight share a shocking statistic or fact did you know that 70% of people who start a fitness program quit within the first month here's how you can be in the successful 30% so if you want an even more powerful hook combine some of these tips together now the second part of packaging is choosing what type of post to create as of right now there are a few types so simple text posts videos images carousels so the algorithm changes all the time and promotes different types of posts more than others sometimes so I'm not going to tell you which one is best but for me image post and Carousel post work the best and for my clients so I like to use the image as a hook to capture attention as well as create an engaging hook for the first sentence of the caption and this gives me two chances to hook people for example you can see I post screenshots of my tweets and also give more context on them in the caption but experiment and see what works best for you and then also as a bonus thing I'm calling it a bonus I'm just remembering it now you want to make sure the spacing of the texts on your post are space out so I like to space between every sentence so once I complete a sentence I hit the enter key and Enter key and then I start a new sentence and this makes your writing so much easier to read and I guarantee you're going to get way more attention on your post if it's a lot easier to see rather than one big wall of text so that covers content but we need to go over a crucial piece to Growing your LinkedIn following because you can have the best content in the world but if nobody sees it it's not going to gain traction it's going to just it's going to get so the other piece you need especially before you get 10,000 LinkedIn followers is traffic and when I say traffic I'm referring to eyeballs people seeing your content and the more traffic you get on good content that will equate to more followers so there are two main ways you can get more traffic on LinkedIn and real quick before I share what they are if you've gotten this far in the video just just click the Subscribe button and turn on the Bell notifications my channel is focused on highly actionable videos like this to help you grow your personal brand and grow your business so I'll be dropping many more videos like this so make sure to hit subscribe all right so the two ways to get more traffic to your LinkedIn content both involve commenting because when a LinkedIn account comments on your post a fraction of Their audience will be shown your post so the first way to get comments on your post on LinkedIn is to comment on other people's posts on LinkedIn so this method is free and one of the best ways to make a name for yourself on LinkedIn so here's what I recommend you make a list of 50 to 100 accounts who post content regularly and have anywhere between 1,000 to 500,000 followers within your Niche then you're going to bookmark their profile and check their feed daily and then you're going to comment on their latest post with something insightful that adds to what they are saying and you're going to repeat this daily and stick to the end of the video cuz I'm going to show you some softwares that'll make this easier so you want to comment for three reasons number one some of their followers are going to see your comment on their post and they're going to think hey this is an interesting person and check out your profile number two humans are reciprocal so some of the accounts will comment on your posts in return and usually these are the accounts who have around the same number of followers as you and then number three you're going to start building relationships with accounts and these people can turn into friends later on now I cannot stress this enough when you comment do not use AI to come up with your comments it's so obvious and will make you look like a complete potato and then number two do not just say I agree good job actually add your own perspective or your own experience to the comment and I like the technique that people use in improv the yes and framework so this is when you agree with what the person said and add to what they are saying so the comments that will get you the most profile views are the ones where you share something about you your story your experience so this is a great way to get more traction so I would aim for anywhere between 20 to 50 comments a day or just set a timer for an hour and comment as much as possible and you're going to get better with commenting over time at the start it might take a bit longer but just stick with it now the second method to getting more traffic to your LinkedIn content is through a LinkedIn engagement group and a LinkedIn engagement group is when you find around 5 to 10 other people on LinkedIn and you form a group and you engage with each other's posts and that just helps boost everyone's posts on the timeline so when you are creating a LinkedIn engagement group you want to find people who are trying to grow their following and in a semi- related Niche so these people don't have to be in the exact same niche as you but there should be some kind of overlap for example an account with an audience of marketers would likely also be interested in sales com writing or even productivity so once you found some people that agreed to join you would then comment on each other's post to leverage each other's audience but here's the thing engagement groups are against linkedin's terms and services and you can get banned if you're caught using these there are also people who get their panties in a Twist and say it's cheating oh my God but if you're running a real business you probably don't have time to spend 5 hours a day commenting on 50 plus post this is one of the easiest ways to grow your following at the start because as each one of you grows so does your overall reach it's a win-win and it's no different than paying for ads like people pay for ads to get eyeballs on their products on their offers on you know their content it's no different in my opinion so that's just a warning to all of you so if you want to do this I recommend creating a group the platform on something like telegram Discord or WhatsApp and Trade Post there now once you start following the previous steps you're going to start getting followers and connection requests and if you don't know what a connection request is it's the equivalent to a Facebook friend request pretty much just on LinkedIn so there are two reasons LinkedIn connections are important number one it's a form of social proof If I go to someone's profile and I see that they are connected with a 100 people I'm connected with then my perception of them and their status is elevated so making it more likely I connect with them and potentially become a client in the future now the second reason LinkedIn connections are important is because the LinkedIn algorithm will promote your profile to people with similar connections making it an easy way to increase your reach to your target audience so connections are an important part of your overall LinkedIn growth strategy but you don't just want to connect with with anybody because the link Lin algorithm promotes you to people with similar connections you want to filter the people you connect with so the things I look for when connecting with others on LinkedIn is one do they have a highquality profile picture two are they in a similar industry as me three do they fit my target audience or do they have a decent amount of mutual connections so when it comes to Growing your connections there will be two ways of doing this on LinkedIn so the first way is accepting connection requests from other people so you can view who wants to connect with you by going to the my network Tab and clicking on invitations the second way of getting more connections is by sending connection requests to other people so when you send a connection request I recommend leaving a message attached to stand out so anything a bit personalized can go a really long way and increase the chances of someone accepting your connection request so it can be something as simple as a genuine compliment on one of their recent posts and for the love of God you know right like a normal human I get so many messages that sound like it came from a corporate robot hello Dakota I see that you breathe air I also breathe air fellow human I would be so gracious if you accepted my Formal Connection request on this social media platform you sound like a robot so avoid the cringe by just talking to them like you would to a friend in person so as for how many LinkedIn connection requests you should send per day I would try to max out your connection requests that you can send out daily if you're under 10,000 followers so LinkedIn changes how many you can send sometimes so I won't give you a specific amount but you can send connection requests by going to the my network tab on LinkedIn and scrolling down a little bit again I filter who to send connection requests to by the profile picture industry target audience and mutual connections now that you have the steps to Growing your LinkedIn following let's go over a simple plug andplay plan you can and start taking action on right now so I'm going to categorize the actions by onetime setup daily actions weekly actions and monthly actions all right so the three things you only got to set up once to grow your LinkedIn following is your LinkedIn profile for one so you want to make sure to pimp out your LinkedIn profile by having a professional photo simple Banner clear headline engaging about section and a well organized feature section two the chat gbt system so use the prompts I gave you and paste the link to the chat somewhere handy so you have easy access number three an engagement list so make a list of all the accounts you want to comment on so store this list on a software like notion Google Docs or Apple notes and then leave a link to each profile and a note for when they normally post that way you know when to engage alternatively you can use a paid software like Tapo it has a built-in feature where you can manage this list easily and engage with everyone easily this is not a sponsored post I just they got a good stuff now moving to daily so the three daily actions you should be doing to grow your LinkedIn following is number one connection request spend 2 minutes going through your connection requests at the end of the day if you're under 10k LinkedIn followers spend 10 minutes daily sending connection requests to other people bonus points if you actually get to chatting with people you Vibe with and form friendships number two responding to comments on your post at the end of your day when everyone is commented Take 5 to 20 minutes responding to as many comments on your post as possible this will build a connection with your followers and increase your future engagement and reach number three commenting on other accounts LinkedIn post so depending on your schedule use your engagement list and spend 30 to 90 minutes a day commenting on other people's posts so as you grow larger and get more engagement you can ease back on this but at the start this is crucial for your LinkedIn growth so for the three weekly actions you should be doing to grow your LinkedIn following number one is idea generation so use the chat GPT system I gave you and find the top three to seven ideas you can turn into posts aim for at least one growth Authority and personal piece of content per week as a bonus tip download the browser extension Cleo kle EO this free tool shows the top post of people's profiles that you visit on LinkedIn and this can give you inspiration on how to structure viral LinkedIn posts and what topics to talk about to drive your engagement it's super super powerful so what you're going to want to do is also copy the link of the top posts in your Niche from the top accounts and store them somewhere so you always have a file of inspiration to draw from so number two is batch creating content so if you can pick one day of the week and batch Out 3 to six hours just for creating your content for the next week and you'll be much more efficient this way because your brain will get into a flow State and when it comes to how many times to post on LinkedIn I recommend 3 to 7 days a week it's more important to post quality than quantity on LinkedIn so I only post once per day and then three scheduling content so I highly recommend scheduling your LinkedIn post you don't have to worry about doing it on a daily basis so you can schedule your LinkedIn post on the platform itself or you can use a post scheduling software like Tapo for the timing of your LinkedIn post this will depend on your audience so my audience is primarily in North America so I post at 11 a.m. EST so I do this because that's when most people in the EST time zone will start going on their break and since many people are working professionals on LinkedIn these SE are the common times when they check their phone and therefore check their LinkedIn but experiment and find a time that works best for you so when it comes to scheduling this should take between 5 to 10 minutes now for monthly actions you should be taking to grow your LinkedIn following just analyze your top post of the month and then use the Cleo browser extension I mentioned and make a note of all your top posts for the past month so you're going to want to study the topic The Hook and the format of your top post and then use that as a signal for what to post for the next month on LinkedIn and then you can also repurpose the post and post them again in four to 5 months just by changing a few words and boom that's how I grew my LinkedIn following to 60,000 people in 2 years now if you like this video then click on the video on the screen for another highly actionable banger
