Praise for
Joseph Sugarman’s Previous Books

You have a real talent for promotion and writing
advertisements.

Albert Gore, Former Vice President
United States of America

There are a lot of great copywriters, but Joe
Sugarman is the best. He knows how to build
a story and close the sale. Anyone who wants
to sell better will enjoy Advertising Secrets
of the Written Word.

Richard Thalheimer, Founder
The Sharper Image

I have been a fan of Joseph Sugarman’s
copywriting and marketing ideas for years
and have beneﬁted greatly by imitating his
long-copy ads. Now he is letting us all in on
his secrets in a book that should cost $2,000
because it contains so much detailed
information. Thank you, Joe. I really liked
the book!

Jack Canﬁeld, Co-Author
Chicken Soup for the Soul

Every trade has its role models. And for me,
there is no better model for ad copywriters
or magazine editors than Joe Sugarman.

Ray Schultz, Editor
DIRECT Magazine

Joseph Sugarman is brimming over with cre-
ative ideas. That isn’t so unusual; many of us
are. But Joe’s ideas rocket into our marketing
consciousness like shooting stars with one tri-
umphant difference: His ideas invariably work.
They motivate. They sell. So this isn’t a book
for theoreticians. It’s aimed like an exquisitely
polished arrow into the heart of writing to sell.
New to marketing? Read this book. Been in the
business for 30 years? Read this book.

From Seminar Participants Who Learned
What You Are About to Learn

I enjoyed the seminar, and I learned a lot. I am
more determined than ever to start and succeed
at running a mail order business.

Lee R. Herrington III, President
Herrington’s Catalog

Your seminar has really opened my eyes to
a realization of what makes effective mail
order advertising. I am sure that attending
the seminar will pay dividends many times
over in the years ahead.

J. M. Robinson
Atlantic Richﬁeld Company

I told you I’d summarize the 6 or 8 major
things, new to me, that I got from the seminar.
Going over the notes I ﬁnd it’s 36 major things
I’ll be doing differently.

Gordon T. Beaham III, President
Faultless Starch/Bon Ami Company

Not only did you teach me some fundamental
new concepts in space advertising, but you
planted some seeds that may well change our
marketing program and perhaps even our way
of doing business.

Frederick J. Simon, President
Omaha Steaks International

I would recommend your seminars to novices
to gain the degree of conﬁdence necessary to
write super ads almost instantaneously. Old-
timers will also beneﬁt because what they’ll
learn is that you can help them make their
ordinary ads super successful. Although I’ve
been in mail order for more than 15 years I soon
found, as a result of your 5-day seminar, that
there was more I didn’t know than I did know.

Ed Axel
Energy Group of America, Inc.

You did two things right. First, you charged
$2,000. This clever device guaranteed the
quality of the participants and assured you of
their rapt and undivided attention. Second, you
gave them their money’s worth. I did only one
thing right. I came.

Joe Karbo
Huntington Beach, California

The depth of knowledge and the skill with
which you organized and presented it was far
above what I anticipated when I signed up for
the seminar. But the real payoff was what the
course covered that was not in the outline.
I feel that the content relating to the philosophy
of achieving success in life and the numerous
examples you provided to prove this philosophy
will have the greatest payoff for us in the
long run.

Ed Scoﬁeld
Garden Way Associates

When you’re a farmer you always worry about
the crop. It’s growing too slow—you worry. It’s
growing too fast—you really worry. I ﬁnd it
to be about the same when a farmer gets into
space advertising. The orders are coming in
so good from our space ads, I’m beginning to
worry. A high-class worry, I’ll admit.

Frank Schultz
Alamo, Texas

I most enjoyed your openness in revealing,
in depth, how you run your company. Few
businessmen have the conﬁdence to give away
their “secrets” as you did!

C. L. Schaldenbrand
Word Processing Exchange

At times the seminar combined high drama,
“made for TV” movie serialization, and mail
order technique in an unbeatable blend of
education and excitement. It was the best class
I have taken since Harvard Business School.

John E. Groman
Epsilon Data Management

On my way back, on Friday night I stayed at
the Sheraton Centre Hotel in New York. My two
bags with my clothes were stolen in the lobby of
the hotel. I don’t care about the clothes, but I
can’t tell you how much I regret the loss of the
seminar material, which is of inestimable value
for me, and which was also in the bags.

Herman Van Hove
Brussels, Belgium

It has given me a fresh perspective and the
insight I had sought when I ﬁrst decided to
attend your seminar. I now have a much clearer
picture of why our successful promotions
succeeded and our failures failed.

The Sugarman Legacy Foreword

By Ray Schultz, Editor, DIRECT Magazine

Every trade has its role models. And for me, there is no bet-
ter  model  for  ad  copywriters  or  magazine  editors  than  Joe
Sugarman.

Bandleader Artie  Shaw  had  a  standard  question  for  musi-

cians who wanted to join his band: “Who do you listen to?”

A similar  question  might  be  asked  of  writers  applying  for

work: “Who do you read?”

Sugarman  is  the  guy  who  sells  BluBlocker  sunglasses  on
TV. He also happens to be one of the most amusing and proliﬁc
writers in the United States, as I discovered when I started read-
ing his JS&A catalog in 1985.

He was totally out of the box. He cracked me up with the

sheer exuberance of his copy approach.

He offered readers $10 for every spelling error they found

in his copy. (“Please don’t correct my grammar.”)

He offered “loaner” watches to customers as part of a ser-

vice guarantee.

He offered a $6 million home for sale in the airline maga-
zines,  accepting  American  Express,  Visa,  MasterCard  or  any
negotiable hard currency.

He sold a $240,000 airplane in a single mail order ad.
And he did it all with a very special tone. It’s like Nelson
Algren said about John Cheever—that he was the one writer you
could  identify  “without  turning  the  pages  of  The  New  Yorker
back to see who wrote it.”

Not that Sugarman is the most colorful rogue ever to write
great mail order copy. There were others. Louis Victor Eytinge, a
convicted murderer who learned how to write in prison. Or Gene

xv

F O R E W O R D :   T H E   S U G A R M A N   L E G A C Y

Schwartz, the art collector, who made his living writing stuff like
“She Fled the Table When the Doctor Said Cut Her Open.”

But  Joe  surpassed  those  guys  in  a  few  very  important
ways—the sheer volume of his writing, the trends that he set and
my favorite, the personal catalog, one in which the copy and the
product reﬂect the quirks of the owner. And Joe has a lot of imi-
tators who have personalized their catalogs using Joe’s catalog
as their inspiration.

How did Joe learn his trade? He claims he learned it from
his  failures  and  not  from  the  mail  order  greats  who  preceded
him.  Greats  like  David  Margoles,  who  sold  4  million  garlic
crushers in the 1950s.

Then there was Max Sackheim, co-founder of the Book-of-
the-Month  Club  and  another  great  pitchman  who  lived  by  his
wits. As  Lester Wunderman  in  1996  reﬂected  about  Sackheim,
“When he talked to clients, he promised a breakthrough—not as
we have now, minuscule improvement.”

Then  there  was  John  Caples,  who  entered American  folk-
lore by writing “They Laughed When I Sat Down at the Piano.”
The  late  Larry  Chait  asked  Caples  why  he  stressed  the  social
beneﬁts instead of just selling the virtues of the course.

“You  don’t  understand,”  Caples  answered.  “Learning  the
piano is tough. You can’t sell that. But you can sell the idea of
social  success  and  overcoming  whatever  deﬁciencies  you  have
in order to become popular.”

Though he may never have met them, Sugarman knows on
a gut level what these guys knew. And that’s important, because
he’s one of the last of a breed.

Now for the good news. He’s passed the tradition down in
this handbook, the best book ever done on the subject of mail or-
der writing.

Besides the advice on selling, it stresses basic truths about
writing, in language anyone can understand. I’ve even given the
manuscript to my new reporters to read.

I’m sad to report that Sugarman doesn’t write as much copy
as he used to—no more catalogs and very few space ads. He’s
followed the money into infomercials and home shopping.

Until they reissue old JS&A catalogs (the way they’ve re-
issued the 1909 edition of Sears, Roebuck), this book will have
to stand as Joe’s legacy in print. But it’s a ﬁne legacy.

So here it is. Enjoy. As Walter Winchell said when he intro-

duced Damon Runyon, “The next act is better.”

marketing industry and editor of DIRECT magazine, a Cowles

Acknowledgments

Many people have contributed to my copywriting skills and to
the creation of this book, and to all of them I am very grateful.
Mary  Stanke,  president  of  JS&A Group,  Inc.,  whose  direction,
commitment and 35 years of service allowed me the creative free-
dom  to  express  myself  through  my  writing  and  who  helped  me
build a substantial business  in the process.  My ex-wife, Wendy,
and our two children, April and Jill, for their understanding and
support  during  the  many  seminars  we  held—always  behind  the
scenes,  but  their  presence  was  very  important  and  always  felt.
Judy  Sugarman,  my  sister  and  copyeditor  for  25  years—always
there to correct my spelling, undangle my modiﬁers and give me
very candid feedback.

I also wish to acknowledge the thousands of customers who
gave  me  a  tremendous  education  and  for  whom  I  have  an  un-
wavering respect. I wish to acknowledge my many competitors,
too. I hated it when they copied me, but in the process of trying to
outwit them my copywriting skills grew even stronger. There are
hundreds of other people I could mention—too numerous to list
here—who have played a vital role in my success and growth.

A special  acknowledgment  to  all  my  wonderful  seminar
participants who learned from me and went on to create or build
successful  businesses—all  through  the  power  of  their  pens.  I
learned a great deal from them. Finally, I wish to thank, with hu-
mility and gratitude, all who have exchanged their hard-earned
money for this book. May you, too, learn and prosper.

The Origins of This Book Introduction

The truly creative mind in any ﬁeld is no more than . . .
a cruelly delicate organism with the overpowering
necessity to create, create, create—so that without the
creating of music or poetry or books or buildings or
something of meaning, his very breath is cut off from
him. He must create, must pour out creation. By some
strange, unknown, inward urgency he is not really alive
unless he is creating.

—Pearl Buck

This is a story about a seminar. It was a copywriting and mar-
keting  seminar  I  presented  starting  in  the  1970s  during  a  time
when I was actively involved in both writing copy and market-
ing a range of products that included everything from electronics
to collectibles—from Bone Fones to Picasso tiles.

I  was  a  proliﬁc  writer,  often  writing  complete  catalogs,
print advertisements and direct mailings. And I owned the com-
pany,  JS&A Group,  Inc.,  that  sold  these  products,  so  I  experi-
enced the direct consequences of my successes and failures.

Failures Outnumbered Successes
My failures far outnumbered my successes. In fact, I have yet to
ﬁnd anybody who has experienced the number of failures I expe-
rienced during the early stages of my career. But it was through
these failures that I received a very costly education that to this
day has guided me through a successful career in advertising and
direct marketing.

To  the  public,  I  was  a  big  success.  Babe  Ruth  is  remem-
bered for his home run record and not for the fact that he also
held the record for the most strikeouts. And so it was with me.

1

I N T R O D U C T I O N :   T H E   O R I G I N S   O F   T H I S   B O O K

Most people just saw my successes, as they were quite visible.
And they just saw my successful innovations because they were
the ones that worked. So to the general public and to others in di-
rect marketing, it appeared that I had the Midas touch.

I  didn’t  see  myself  running  seminars.  I  was  busy  enough
running my business. And to share my secrets with the industry
was only asking for competition. But it was a series of coinci-
dences that prompted me to offer seminar courses and I’m glad I
made the decision to do them. And many of my participants are
glad, too—people whose seminar experience made an enormous
difference in their lives.

My  seminar  was  different.  First,  I  was  an  actual  practi-
tioner—not an educator or a consultant who never had to make a
major marketing gamble or cover a payroll. I was out there on
the ﬁring line, making sure each day that the copy I was writing
and the marketing decisions I was making were going to be ac-
cepted by the marketplace.

Second, it was during a time when my success was reaching
a peak. Our mail order ads were appearing everywhere. They ap-
peared in newspapers and magazines and on airplanes and with
such  regularity  and  frequency  that  the  format  was  attracting  a
great deal of attention and creating an entire ﬂock of imitators.

Finally,  I  realized  what  people  were  willing  to  pay  just  to
hear me as a speaker or talk to me as a consultant. Bernie Pargh,
an entrepreneur and owner of B.A. Pargh, a business equipment
sales company, ﬂew from Nashville to Los Angeles one day just
to  hear  me  speak  to  a  direct  marketing  group.  “Joe,  I’ve  spent
over $1,000 just to hear you speak for 45 minutes,” he told me.

I would also get calls from people who had marketing prob-
lems and would want to ﬂy to visit me in the Chicago suburb of
Northbrook, where our company was based, just to sit and talk to
me for 15 minutes.

The Fateful Visit
But the seminar would never have taken place had it not been for
a small vacation I took up to northern Wisconsin to visit my sis-
ter and her family.

It  was  during  that  trip  that  I  discovered  the  beauty  of  the

2

I N T R O D U C T I O N :   T H E   O R I G I N S   O F   T H I S   B O O K

north  woods  and  made  the  decision,  with  my  family,  to  ﬁnd  a
second home there. The home I eventually found was a 10,000-
square-foot,  two-story  building  on  a  16-acre  site  overlooking
one of the most beautiful lakes I had ever seen. The property was
ﬁlled  with  virgin  timber—tall,  stately  pines  and  oak  trees  that
had escaped the lumbermen who cleared most of the trees from
northern Wisconsin during the 1800s.

But  the  home  was  costly  and  at  the  time  something  I
couldn’t afford. The price in 1977 was $350,000 and I couldn’t
really  justify  it  until  my  lawyer  and  close  personal  friend,
George Gerstman, suggested I could use the facility as a seminar
site. “Hold marketing seminars at the place, turn it into a busi-
ness and you could write off the entire property and even make a
proﬁt,” he suggested.

The idea really appealed to me. It was a very unique setting.
It was isolated and quiet, and the fresh northern Wisconsin air at
Minocqua was stimulating and invigorating.

I spent a great deal of the summer going up there with my
family and furnishing the facility for a seminar. I cleared away a
number  of  the  odd  buildings  that  dated  back  to  the  1800s  but
were in such disrepair that I had no choice but to remove them.
My  wife  at  the  time, Wendy,  helped  pick  out  the  furniture  and
dishes. She also hired a cook, housekeepers and the support staff
needed  to  run  the  seminars  while  Mary  Stanke,  my  operations
chief  at  JS&A,  assisted  with  registering  the  participants  and
preparing all the materials for the seminar. And so within a few
months the facility was transformed into an enchanting seminar
site—a learning center that I called “Nature’s Response.”

The Most Expensive Seminar
Back in 1977, I was charging $2,000 for ﬁve days—a price that
made  it,  at  the  time,  the  most  expensive  seminar  in  the  direct
marketing  business.  For  my  seminars  10  years  later,  I  charged
$3,000. I announced the seminar in Advertising Age and Direct
Marketing magazines  in  the  format  of  one  of  my  typical  ads.
And the response was immediate. If Bernie Pargh was willing to
spend $1,000 to ﬂy to Los Angeles to hear me speak for 45 min-
utes and several people were willing to ﬂy from different parts of

3

I N T R O D U C T I O N :   T H E   O R I G I N S   O F   T H I S   B O O K

the United States to talk to me for just 15 minutes, I had a value
that certainly was worth $2,000 for ﬁve full days.

Within a few weeks, I had a full class with participants from
all  over  the  world.  We  had  somebody  from  Germany,  several
from California and quite a few from the East Coast. We had a
farmer from Texas and a dentist from Carmel, California. Richard
Viguerie, the conservative Washington fund-raiser, enrolled and
of course Bernie Pargh attended. I actually had more participants
than I wanted so I created a reservation list for my next seminar.
To get to Minocqua, the seminar participants had to ﬂy to
Chicago, board a commuter plane there and ﬂy to the town of
Rhinelander,  Wisconsin,  where  they  then  took  a  bus  for  the
40-minute  ride  to  their  motel. To  get  to  the  seminar  site,  the
participants took a pontoon boat from the motel and landed at
our boathouse where they walked up a path to the house.

And at the house, they would ﬁnd several rooms outﬁtted as
classrooms,  a  large  dining  room,  a  kitchen  and  a  very  large
wooden balcony where they could look out at the lake, relax and
enjoy the clean north-woods air.

It  was  an  idyllic  setting  in  a  remote  part  of  America—a
place where my students would learn a form of copywriting and
marketing that they could not learn anyplace else.

The Book Contains Many Lessons
This book shares many of the lessons and experiences that were
taught  at  these  seminars. You’ll  learn  how  to  mentally  prepare
yourself to write copy, how to write effective copy, and how to
present  your  product,  concept  or  service  in  a  novel  and
exciting  way. You’ll  learn  what  really  works  and  what  doesn’t
and how to avoid many of the pitfalls that marketers fall into—
and much more.

I convey my unique approach to copy by demonstrating my
thought process on everything from how copy should ﬂow to the
elements  every  ad  should  have—from  the  psychology  of  copy
and its motivational triggers to the emotions generated by words.
But the seminar was certainly more than learning about copy and
marketing.

The  seminar  turned  into  a  motivational  experience  for

4

I N T R O D U C T I O N :   T H E   O R I G I N S   O F   T H I S   B O O K

many  who  went  on  to  become  quite  successful.  Others,  who
were already successful, couldn’t wait to get back to work and
implement  their  new  knowledge.  And  they  too  grew  in  the
process.

You too will understand how to relate what you’ve learned
about  copywriting  to  other  forms  of  marketing  and  you’ll  see
how many of the same principles apply.

The Goal of Copy
Throughout this book, I talk about the eventual goal of writing
effective  copy,  namely:  “To  cause  a  person  to  exchange  his  or
her  hard-earned  money  for  a  product  or  service.”  It’s  really  as
simple as that.

Direct marketing is truly the tool of this century. Using it, you
can move millions of people to reach into their pockets for millions
of dollars—all from the power of your pen or the message you con-
vey in print, on TV, on radio or on a computer screen.

For most of what I teach in this book I use a print ad as a
reference  point.  Print  ads  are  among  the  most  difﬁcult  of  all
forms of direct marketing. On a single page, in two dimensions,
located in a medium with hundreds of competing messages and
without sound or motion, you’ve got to entice a person to start
reading your ad, convey the complete story of your product or
service and then convince the person to reach for the phone and
order. To understand this process and to effectively implement it
requires  a  lot  of  experience  and  skill.  But  once  you  have  mas-
tered the skills, you will have the ability to build a business from
just the power of your pen and with very little capital.

When Mike Valentine attended my seminar, he was operating
his radar detector company out of his garage. Later, using many of
the  skills  I  taught  him,  he  grew  his  company,  Cincinnati  Mi-
crowave (developer of the Escort Radar Detector), to a $140 mil-
lion  public  company.  Jimmy  Calano  was  a  young  20-something
entrepreneur who had been giving small management seminars
when  he  attended  my  course.  He  eventually  became  a  major
force  in  the  seminar  business  with  CareerTrack—a  multi-mil-
lion-dollar company. Victoria’s Secret sent two of their top mar-
keting people when the company consisted of just two stores and

5

a  catalog.  They  eventually  were  acquired  by  The  Limited  and
became a powerful retail chain throughout the country.

From a UPS driver who had a fascination with direct mar-
keting  and  came  to  the  seminar  with  his  last  $2,000  to  Joe
Karbo,  author  of  The  Lazy  Man’s Way  to  Riches,  who  already
was  a  very  successful  mail  order  entrepreneur—they  all  came
with great anticipation and they all left with valuable knowledge
that helped them continue to grow and prosper.

17 Seminars Given
I had 312 students attending 17 seminars—from the ﬁrst one
in the summer of 1977 to the last one given in Maui, Hawaii,
in the spring of 2000. The rest of my writing and marketing in-
sights come from several years of experience since then in the
visual  medium  of  TV—infomercials,  TV spots  and  home
shopping.

Regardless of your current educational level or knowledge
of  marketing,  this  book  will  give  you  fresh  insights  into  the
world of copywriting, marketing, human behavior, the Internet,
public relations and other lessons taught at my seminar.

Even if you are not interested in writing copy, you’ll have
a  better  appreciation  and  understanding  of  the  copywriting
process—so much so that you will be conﬁdent that you too can
write good copy or, at a minimum, critique copy.

So pull up an easy chair, prop your feet up and sink into one
of the most comprehensive contemporary books on the subject
of  copywriting,  marketing  and  creative  expression—a  treasure
chest of insights that will entertain as it teaches.

Understanding the Process Preview

This handbook is based on a book I wrote in 1998 called Adver-
tising  Secrets  of  the  Written  Word.  The  book  consisted  of  the
lessons I had taught at exclusive seminars I conducted beginning
in 1977.

My challenge was to take the ﬁrst book, revise it to make it
current and add many of the copywriting techniques to be con-
sidered when you write for the Internet, direct mail, public rela-
tions releases and other copywriting tasks. In the revision process
I had to reread my book chapter by chapter and revise it where
necessary. What I discovered in this process was that all the prin-
ciples  remained  the  same  regardless  of  changes  in  the  way  we
communicate that have occurred since I wrote it.

The  modiﬁcations  were  primarily  to  update  certain  facts
and ﬁgures that had changed over time or to cite a few examples
that were more contemporary. Regardless of the media, however,
one  fact  emerged.  You  should  always  ﬁrst  express  whatever
product or service you are selling in a print direct response ad. It
is  in  this  format  that  you  can  develop  the  real  essence  of  your
product or service.

That’s exactly what I do. If I have to sell something on the
Internet, in a catalog, or on TV, I ﬁrst produce a print ad. And
from the print ad, if I do my job correctly, I will ﬁnd the clues
and the concepts that best reﬂect the strong selling points that I
can use in any other media.

With a print ad, you won’t have the interactive nature of the
Internet  or  the  motion  of  TV images.  You’ll  need  to  sell  your
product or service on a ﬂat piece of paper with no sound, no mo-
tion—just your words.

In the ﬁrst section of this handbook, I take you through the
step-by-step creative process of writing that print direct response
ad. I think you will be surprised at how easy it will seem once

9

U N D E R S T A N D I N G   T H E   P R O C E S S

you read the simple steps involved and learn about the thinking
process you have to develop.

I take the mystery out of the process and at the same time
show you how you can create great copy even if you’ve never
written any direct response copy before.

In  fact,  the  most  often  heard  comment  I’ve  gotten  from
those who read my book is simply “I now realize how easy it is
to write great copy.”

I have built several businesses from the power of my pen.
Being  able  to  write  copy  for  your  own  business  is  a  powerful
tool that will serve you for the rest of your life. And to learn how,
let  me  guide  you  through  the  steps  you  will  follow  as  you
quickly master this skill.

General Knowledge

Chapter 1

The  preparation  to  become  a  copywriter  involves  knowledge.
There are two types. The ﬁrst is a very broad or general knowl-
edge and the second is a very speciﬁc or targeted knowledge. Let
me explain.

The best copywriters in the world are those who are curious
about life, read a great deal, have many hobbies, like to travel,
have  a  variety  of  interests,  often  master  many  skills,  get  bored
and then look for other skills to master. They hunger for experi-
ence and knowledge and ﬁnd other people interesting. They are
very good listeners.

Look  at  my  background.  I’m  an  instrument-rated  multi-
engine commercial pilot, an amateur radio operator, and a pro-
fessional photographer; I love computers, music, reading, movies,
travel,  art  and  design.  I’ve  done  the  complete  catalog  for  my
company including everything from setting the type to doing
the layout. I’ve done all the photography and even some
of the modeling. (My hand became quite famous, but
more  on  that  later.)  I’ve  tried  many  sports—golf,
tennis, football, baseball, basketball, scuba diving,
skiing,  and  snowmobiling.  I’ve  traveled  to  every
continent  on  the  globe  with  the  exception  of  the
Antarctic and I know I’ll eventually get there. I’ve
mastered a second language—German—during the
three years I spent with the military in Germany. I’ve had hun-
dreds of failures and many successes, with each representing a
learning experience.

The thirst for knowledge, a tremendous curiosity about life,
a wealth of experiences and not being afraid to work are the top
credentials for being a good copywriter.

If  you  examine  the  lives  of  some  of  our  greatest  writers,
you will see that they experienced a great deal and wrote about
their experiences. Hemingway, Steinbeck—both lived and then

many skills.

11

U N D E R S T A N D I N G   T H E   P R O C E S S

wrote  about  their  adventures. The  more  we  experience  and  the
more knowledge we have, the easier it is to come up with that
big copy idea or marketing concept.

But  more  signiﬁcantly,  it  is  important  to  experience  as
much in life as possible and not to fear failure. It’s not whether
you win or lose in life that’s important but whether you play the
game.  Lose  enough  and  eventually  you  will  win—it’s  only  a
matter of time. Edwin Land, the inventor of the Polaroid cam-
era, said it best when he described his deﬁnition of a mistake:
“A mistake is a future beneﬁt, the full value of which is yet to be
realized.”

I  can  remember  when  I  was  very  young  and  would  fail  at
something I had tried very hard to accomplish. I’d often say to my-
self, “No big loss—it’s in my back pocket. One of these days I’ll
use  what  I’ve  just  experienced  simply  by  reaching  into  my  back
pocket, and presto, I will have the answer just when I need it.”

Experiences Create Ideas
Our minds are like giant computers. Every experience that goes
into  your  brain—both  good  and  bad—becomes  more  program
material and data to recall and assemble in new ways in the fu-
ture. Remember when the ﬁrst Apple computers came out with
their  big  64K  memories?  You  might  also  remember  the  slow
speed and the poor graphics compared to the high-powered per-
sonal  computers  we  have  today. Today’s  computers  are  faster,
are more efﬁcient, can accomplish more and can interrelate in-
formation  faster  and  more  easily.  So  it  stands  to  reason,  the
more we’ve experienced, the more we can draw upon when it
comes time to relate those experiences to new problems or op-
portunities.

There is nothing really new in life. It’s simply a matter of
taking previous pieces of knowledge and putting them together
in  a  unique  and  different  format.  Matter  is  not  created  and  de-
stroyed. Everything on earth that was here a billion years ago is
pretty  much  here  now.  The  only  difference  is  that  it  has  taken
new forms.

The more you have stored in your brain from experiences
and  knowledge  and  the  more  you  are  able  to  interrelate  that

12

G E N E R A L   K N O W L E D G E

knowledge and come up with new combinations of old material,
the  greater  an  idea  person  you  will  be  and  the  more  powerful
your capabilities as a copywriter will be.

There is a saying that goes, “If all you have is a hammer,
you look at every problem as a nail.” The more tools you have to
work on a problem in the form of experiences or knowledge, the
more new ways you can ﬁgure out how to solve it.

Lateral Thinking for Ideas
Edward de Bono, one of the great creative thinkers of our time,
coined the term lateral thinking to describe the process of com-
ing up with ideas by not focusing or thinking of just the problem.
Often, by relating the problem to something that has nothing to
do with the problem, a new idea emerges.

De Bono created a product that he called his “Think Tank,”
which  encouraged  people  to  think  more  laterally  and  conse-
quently more creatively. It was an eight-inch sphere mounted on
a platform. Through a small window you could see a selection of
14,000  words  printed  on  small  plastic  pieces.  You  shook  the
Think Tank and then looked into it and wrote down the ﬁrst three
words you saw.

You then tried to relate the three words to your marketing
problem, to come up with a fresh perspective toward solving the
problem.  For  example,  let  us  say  I  wanted  to  sell  my  airplane.
Typically, I would run an ad and focus on just the airplane, its
features and equipment. But in using the Think Tank for lateral
thinking, I might draw three totally unrelated words, farm, sales-
man and  compassion  and  have  to  create  an  ad  incorporating
those  three  words.  This  process  would  cause  me  to  search  my
brain, my data bank, and all my past experiences for some way
to relate the three words while keeping in mind that I had to sell
the airplane.

The Dictionary as a Tool
Lateral thinking is simply a tool. So is your dictionary. And so is
your mind. Probably one of the most important keys in copywrit-
ing  and  conceptualizing  is  the  ability  to  relate  totally  divergent
concepts to create a new concept. Once again, the more data you
have to work with from your life experiences and the more your

13

U N D E R S T A N D I N G   T H E   P R O C E S S

mind can relate this data to a problem, the better you are going to
be at coming up with that really great idea.

Running Your Own Company
Another factor that makes a great copywriter is the experience of
running  your  own  company  and  being  responsible  for  every
word  you  write.  The  really  great  direct  marketing  copywriters
often  don’t  work  for  advertising  agencies,  but  rather  run  their
own companies and experience their own successes and failures.
Ben Suarez, Gary Halbert, the late Gene Schwartz and dozens of
others  recognized  as  top  copywriters  have  owned  their  own
companies  and  learned  over  years  of  trial  and  error—years  of
both big mistakes and great success. You can’t beat that type of
experience.

In my case, I have been presented with thousands of prod-
ucts,  have  written  ads  for  hundreds  of  them  and  have  had  to
come up with that big idea hundreds of times a year. Even as I
look  back  at  my  advertising,  I  see  a  learning  curve  that  would
not have been possible had it not been for that immense wealth
of broad experience. You’re going to read about many of those
experiences throughout this book. You’ll be able to avoid many
of the pitfalls and mistakes I made climbing my way up the lad-
der and you’ll understand why these mistakes were indeed learn-
ing experiences.

The  preparation  for  becoming  a  great  copywriter  is  a
lifestyle. It’s a hunger for knowledge, a curiosity and a desire to
participate in life that is broad-based and passionate. If you have
this personality, you are already well on your way. If you don’t,
simply being aware of it is often enough to start a mental process
and movement that will take you to where you would like to be.
But being a great copywriter is more than just having a lot of ex-
perience in life. What you will learn in the next chapter is just as
important.

Speciﬁc Knowledge Chapter 2

I was sitting in the laboratory of the Sensor Watch Company in
Dallas, Texas, looking through a microscope and learning every-
thing I could about how a new digital watch was designed, pro-
duced and assembled.

I was becoming an expert on digital watch technology, on
integrated circuits, quartz crystals and oscillator circuits. “Why
are all the contacts gold-plated?” I asked the engineer. “They’re
gold-plated  in  every  integrated  circuit.  It’s  part  of  the  technol-
ogy,” was the reply.

The conversation continued. It had been two days and I was
still  delving  into  every  aspect  of  this  new  digital  watch  I  was
planning  to  introduce.  I  still  hadn’t  reached  the  point  where  I
could write an ad on the advantages of the new product. At the
time, most digital watches had liquid crystal displays, and in or-
der to see the time, you had to press a button to illuminate the
display.  On  the  new  Sensor  watch,  the  display  glowed  con-
stantly,  thanks  to  an  inert  but  radioactive  substance  that  was
placed in a small ﬂat capsule behind the display.

New Technology Required Powerful Presentation
This new technology meant that you could glance down at your
watch and, in an instant, tell the time—even at night—without
pressing any buttons. But I felt that there had to be a powerful
way of presenting the product and I still wasn’t comfortable with
what I had.

The Sensor 770 was very expensive to make and sell. So I
knew that I needed something that made the watch I was selling
really different and special.

“Why  didn’t  somebody  think  of  this  radioactive  material

for watches before?” was my next question.

The  engineer  looked  at  me,  paused  for  a  second  and  then
said, “We haven’t had the technology to seal the radioactive ma-

15

U N D E R S T A N D I N G   T H E   P R O C E S S

terial in a transparent capsule without it leaking out until some-
body developed a technique with a laser. The laser is what seals
the capsule. Without the laser, there is no way you could com-
pletely seal the capsule.”

That  was  all  I  needed. The  concept  was  clear. And  the  ad
headline  that  I  wrote  for  the  new  Sensor  digital  watch  was,
“Laser Beam Digital Watch.”

The story told of how the watch was made possible thanks
to a laser beam and how its new technology beneﬁted the con-
sumer. That single concept resulted in millions of dollars in prof-
itable sales for the digital watch.

When I had reached the point about the laser beam sealing the
capsule, I knew I had found that unique headline concept that made
the watch stand out from the competition. But it took a few days of
very  intensive  learning  and  study  before  the  concept  emerged.
Sometimes this can happen in a few minutes, sometimes it can hap-
pen in a few hours and sometimes it may take weeks. This time it
took a few days of patience along with speciﬁc knowledge.

You Must Become an Expert
You  need  to  become  an  expert  on  a  product,  service  or  any-
thing you write about to really be effective. Becoming an ex-
pert means learning enough about a product to obtain enough
speciﬁc knowledge so you can communicate the real nature of
what you are trying to sell. Say to yourself, “I am an expert or
have learned enough to be able to effectively communicate this
product  to  the  consumer.”  That’s  what  we  mean  by  “speciﬁc
knowledge.”

This doesn’t mean that you have to learn everything there
is  to  know  about  a  subject  every  time. There  have  been  times
when I simply looked at a product or service and came up with
the  big  idea  from  my  own  past  experience  or  speciﬁc  knowl-
edge in a particular category. Remember, I’m a pilot, ham radio
operator and photographer. I already had not only vast knowl-
edge of the gadgets I would sell in my business, but knowledge
of  my  customer,  as  well.  I  myself  was  my  typical  customer.  I
was  the  type  of  individual  I  had  to  sell  products  to  because  I
was as gadget-oriented as the person I was trying to appeal to.

16

S P E C I F I C   K N O W L E D G E

You Must Know Your Customer, Too
And that’s another point. In addition to knowing your product or
service, you’ve really got to know your customer. You’ve got to
be an expert on who your customer is by gathering speciﬁc in-
formation on whom you are selling to. You may already be an
expert  by  virtue  of  being  a  typical  customer.  You  know  your
likes and dislikes, what excites you and what you yourself would
expect from a company selling you a product. But if it is your as-
signment to write copy for a product or service that you really
don’t have a feel for, then you have a great deal of studying to do
to  make  sure  you  understand  who  your  customer  is  and  what
motivates him or her.

You Must Understand a Product’s Nature
And even if you understand your customer and understand your
product,  you  must  realize  one  more  thing.  There  is  a  speciﬁc
way that each product should be presented to your customer. In
short, the product has a nature of its own and it’s up to you to
discover  what  the  nature  of  that  product  is  in  the  mind  of  the
consumer.

Let me cite a good example. Back when I ﬁrst started JS&A
in  the  basement  of  my  home,  I  met  Howard  Franklin.  Howard
was  an  insurance  salesman  from  Chicago  who  bought  his  ﬁrst
calculator from me from an ad I ran in the Wall Street Journal.
He  loved  his  calculator  and  stopped  by  one  day  to  buy  a  few
more of them. After that, Howard would stop by every once in a
while and buy more calculators as gifts for his better clients.

One day, Howard stopped by and said that since JS&A was
a growing concern, I should buy insurance. “You want to protect
your family because if anything ever happened to you, there may
be  quite  an  estate  and  lots  of  taxes  to  pay  before  your  family
would realize anything.”

“Thank  you,  Howard.  I  appreciate  the  offer,  but  I  don’t

really believe in insurance,” was my standard reply.

But  Howard  was  a  good  salesman.  Every  once  in  a  while
Howard would clip out an article on calculators from a local pa-
per or an article from some magazine on some new gadget and
send it to me with his card. And every once in a while, Howard

17

U N D E R S T A N D I N G   T H E   P R O C E S S

stopped  by  and  picked  up  a  calculator  and  again  dropped  the
comment, “Joe, you should really have insurance.”

“Thanks, Howard. I appreciate the advice,” was my typical

comment.

Then one day I heard a siren in front of my next-door neigh-
bor’s house. I looked out the window and within a few minutes,
my  neighbor  was  being  carried  out  of  his  home  on  a  stretcher
with  a  white  sheet  over  him.  He  had  died  that  morning  from  a
massive heart attack. He was only in his 40s. I was 36 at the time.
The next day I called Howard on the phone. “Howard, re-
member  our  many  discussions  on  insurance  and  protecting
your  family  and  stuff?  Well,  I  think  that  we  should  sit  down
and  work  out  some  sort  of  program  for  an  insurance  plan  for
my family and me.”

I  had  ﬁnally  made  the  plunge.  Was  it  Howard’s  salesman-
ship?  Was  it  his  persistence?  Maybe.  But  I  realized  from  that
experience  a  really  effective  way  to  sell  a  whole
series of products. Howard succeeded because he
had planted enough seeds in my mind for me to re-
alize what insurance was for, who should sell it to
me  and  who  was  a  good  friend  and  customer.
When it came time to buy, only I, Joseph Sugar-
man,  would  know. And  only  when  there  was  an
immediate experience that hit close to home would I see the value
of insurance. I went through the experience and I responded.

Some of the implications from this example will be referred
to later in this book, but the point concerns the nature of a prod-
uct. Every product has a nature to it that you must understand to
be  successful  when  creating  a  marketing  concept  behind  that
product.  For  example,  from  the  insurance  experience,  I  soon
realized how to sell burglar alarms and became one of the largest
burglar  alarm  sales  companies  in  the  country,  protecting  more
homes than any other company.

The  alarm  was  called  the  Midex  and  my  thoughts  went
back to Howard as I created the ad. I knew that to scare people
into  buying  a  burglar  alarm  was  like  Howard  coming  into  my
basement  and  saying,  “Joe,  when  you  die,  are  you  going  to
leave  your  wife  and  kids  in  ﬁnancial  disaster?”  That  would

make me take
action.

18

S P E C I F I C   K N O W L E D G E

never sell me insurance. Nor would a similar technique of quot-
ing crime statistics work to sell burglar alarms.

I realized that if I were to buy a burglar alarm, I would ﬁrst
have  to  recognize  a  need  for  one:  perhaps  if  my  neighbor  was
robbed  or  crime  in  my  community  was  on  the  rise  or  I  had
recently purchased something expensive.

Once I had a need for a burglar alarm, I would look for one
that really made sense for my situation. The ﬁrst thing I would
insist on is that it worked. After all, the ﬁrst time I really need
my alarm to work may be the only time it would be called upon
to work, and I’d want to make sure it worked ﬂawlessly.

The second thing that would be important to me is the ease of
installation. It would have to be so easy to install that it wouldn’t
require any outside person stringing wires all over my house. So
when I wrote the ad on the Midex burglar alarm, I made sure that I
spent several paragraphs on the reliability of the product and the
testing each unit went through before it was shipped. And I used
astronaut Wally Schirra as my spokesperson for the alarm. He was
quoted as saying, “I’m very pleased with my unit.”

Scare Tactics Don’t Usually Work
Never did I try to scare the prospective customer with crime sta-
tistics.  It  would  look  as  ridiculous  as  Howard  screaming  or
warning me in my basement to get insurance because I may die.
All I did was realize the nature of the product I was selling, bring
out the points in the product that were important to the consumer
and then wait until the consumer saw the ad enough times or was
threatened close enough to home before he or she bought.

We received many orders from people who had cut out the
ad and put it in a ﬁle. When indeed they were threatened, they
then  called  and  placed  their  orders.  Fortunately,  there  were
enough people who wanted a unit when they saw the ad to earn
us  a  nice  proﬁt,  but  we  also  received  orders  months  after  we
stopped running our ads. And despite the fact that many of the
electronic products of the time were obsolete just a few months
after they were introduced, we managed to run our ad for over
three years before sales slowed down.

I have one other example on the importance of becoming an

19

U N D E R S T A N D I N G   T H E   P R O C E S S

expert on the product you sell by gaining speciﬁc knowledge in
order  to  write  outstanding  copy  on  a  subject.  It  happened  in
1975, right at the start of the citizens band (CB) radio boom in
the United States. Back then, the U.S. government had imposed
a reduced nationwide speed limit of 55 miles per hour to con-
serve  fuel.  The  lower  speed  limits  really  affected  those  18-
wheel  long-haul  truck  drivers.  Truck  drivers  responded  by
buying CBs to communicate with each other.

The  truck  drivers  would  travel  in  caravans  and  truckers
ahead of the caravan would signal if there was a “Smokey” (po-
lice ofﬁcer) in the area. Soon CBs became so popular that the av-
erage  motorist  started  buying  them  and  a  whole  new  fad
emerged in the United States—a fad so big that songs, movies
and a variety of products were created to capitalize on it. The CB
units themselves were in such demand that you couldn’t even get
one  without  a  wait,  and  thieves  were  stealing  them  out  of  cars
and turning a very hefty proﬁt reselling them.

As a ham radio operator, I knew of the fun in radio commu-
nications and the advantages of having a unit in my car. This was
my general knowledge. So I wanted to experience the fad and I
decided to get a CB radio. I then became somewhat of an expert
on it. There was a lot less to master with CB than there was with
ham radio, where I had to learn the Morse code at 13 words per
minute and a great deal of technical information before passing
my operator’s test.

During the early stages of the fad, I was attending the Con-
sumer Electronics Show in Chicago when I bumped into Mike
Weschler, a salesman, who showed me a new product. “Joe, here
is a miniature walkie-talkie.”

The Product Was Not Unusual
I looked at the small sliver of a product he handed me and real-
ized  that  a  small  walkie-talkie  was  no  big  deal. You  could  get
them  at  any  RadioShack  store.  But  Mike  then  pointed  out  that
the unit had an integrated circuit—it was one of the few units us-
ing this new type of technology and it indeed was smaller than
any of the other products on the market.

The  product  seemed  a  little  more  interesting  after  Mike

20

S P E C I F I C   K N O W L E D G E

explained its features. It was so small that it could easily slip into
a shirt pocket. “What frequencies can you broadcast on and what
is the power?” I asked, calling on my knowledge of ham radio.

“The unit has two frequencies. One takes a crystal for any
of a number of frequencies and the other would be permanently
set to a frequency around 27 megahertz.”

I looked up at Mike as he was demonstrating the unit and
asked  him,  “Mike,  isn’t  27  megahertz  near  one  of  the  CB  fre-
quencies?”

“Right.  It’s  channel  12  but  don’t  worry,  there  is  not  that
much  radio  trafﬁc  on  channel  12.  It’s  normally  reserved  for
walkie-talkies,”  Mike  assured  me  rather  sheepishly  as  if  I  had
discovered a fault with the unit.

“No, Mike, I think that will turn out to be an advantage.”
And indeed it was. I took the unit, called it a Pocket CB and sold
over 250,000 of them at $39.95. It was a huge success and fully
attributable to my general knowledge combined with the speciﬁc
knowledge of the unit and the discovery of that unique feature
that might have been overlooked by somebody else.

Realize  how  important  it  is  to  know  your  product  and
know  your  customer.  It  is  this  speciﬁc  knowledge  that  will
make a dramatic difference in your ability to communicate your
thoughts in copy.

Practice, Practice, Practice Chapter 3

One of the ﬁrst things I would ask my seminar students to think
about was the deﬁnition of good copywriting. Is it the skill of be-
ing  able  to  accurately  put  words  on  paper?  Can  it  be  taught?
What sort of background do you need to be a good copywriter?

We would then talk about both general knowledge and spe-
ciﬁc knowledge. But I explained that there was more to the art of
copywriting.

Copywriting  is  simply  a  written  form  of  communicating
facts and emotions. It is a mental process. Some copywriters will
tell you that many of their greatest works were well thought out
in their minds even before they put them on paper.

Joe Karbo wrote one of the most successful income opportu-
nity ads ever written for his book, The Lazy Man’s Way to Riches,
in one draft and without corrections. It just poured out of his mind
onto a sheet of paper. And it was one of the few ads he ever wrote.
Some copywriters will tell you that they just sit down and
start writing. Some ﬁnd that sitting in front of a computer does
the trick and others need something like a pen and a pad of paper.
My  greatest  ads  were  written  during  a  variety  of  circum-
stances. Many were well thought out before I put the ﬁrst word
to  paper  and  they  ﬂowed  out  with  hardly  a  correction.  Other
times they would ﬂow but you wouldn’t recognize the ﬁrst draft
from  the  last  because  of  the  number  of  corrections  I  made.
Sometimes I would sit in an airplane and just write from takeoff
to landing and come up with great copy. And other times, I used
my computer with great success.

It’s All a Mental Process
The  bottom  line  for  all  these  approaches  is  that  copywriting  is
primarily the mental process of ﬁrst getting your thoughts orga-
nized  in  your  mind  and  then  eventually  transferring  them  onto
paper. There is no best method—just what works for you.

23

U N D E R S T A N D I N G   T H E   P R O C E S S

But  the  best  place  to  start,  without  question,  is  to  start.
That’s  right.  Pick  up  a  piece  of  paper  and  a  pen,  and  start.  Do
enough of it over a long enough period of time and I guarantee
you, you’ll improve each year. Write articles for a local newspa-
per. I started writing for my high school paper. It gave me expe-
rience and conﬁdence. Write letters, write postcards—just plain
write every opportunity you can.

I  look  over  my  very  ﬁrst  JS&A direct  response  ads  and
can’t  believe  I  wrote  them. They  were  horrible.  But  I  matured
and  I  learned  with  each  ad  I  wrote.  In  my  ﬁrst  ads,  I  used
clichés—“It’s the product the world has been waiting for.” And
my sentences weren’t ﬂowing as they do now. Sheer volume and
experience will do wonders. As they say to anybody wanting to
make it to Carnegie Hall,  “Practice, practice, practice.”

Don’t Worry about the First Draft
Another fact to realize about writing copy is that the ﬁrst draft of
an ad is often terrible and the real skill in copywriting is taking
that  rough  draft  and  polishing  it. You  might  add  words,  delete
entire  sentences,  change  the  order  of  sentences  or  even  para-
graphs.  It’s  all  part  of  the  copywriting  process.  I  often  pointed
out to my students that if everybody in the class were given the
assignment of writing a draft of an ad for a product, the ﬁrst draft
of my ad would quite likely be terrible compared to everybody
else’s. It is what I do with the copy after my ﬁrst draft that really
makes the difference.

In that ﬁrst draft the goal is to put something—anything—
on paper, the emotional outpouring of everything you are trying
to convey about your product or service. Don’t worry about how
it reads. Just get it down onto something you can work with like
a computer screen or a piece of paper and then go from there.

To deﬁne exactly what copywriting is, I often presented the

following axiom:

Copywriting  is  a  mental  process  the  successful  execution  of
which reﬂects the sum total of all your experiences, your spe-
ciﬁc knowledge and your ability to mentally process that infor-
mation and transfer it onto a sheet of paper for the purpose of
selling a product or service.

Axiom 1

24

P R A C T I C E ,   P R A C T I C E ,   P R A C T I C E

And in this book you will learn some of the valuable tech-
niques  to  use  to  expand  your  knowledge  of  the  copywriting
process so you can write copy that motivates people to take an
action—speciﬁcally  to  take  their  hard-earned  money  and  ex-
change it for your product or service.

Copywriting is the key to any successful direct marketing
venture. You can have the world’s best product or service, but if
you can’t communicate your ideas, you have nothing. I will give
you the skills and insights you need to successfully write copy.
I’ve already personally taken the most expensive course ever. If
you would add up my failures and their cost to me, add the in-
sights I received mostly from my failures, and then add the expe-
riences  I’ve  had  in  copywriting  and  marketing,  you  would  see
that it has indeed been an expensive education. And you’re about
to share in it.

The Purpose of All the Graphic Elements of an Ad Chapter 4

You are now ready to start to learn the techniques I use to write
copy. You already understand the importance of having a broad
general knowledge. This takes time and is a lifelong quest. And
you understand the importance of obtaining speciﬁc knowledge
on a project you are working on. This I hope is quite clear from
Chapter 2.

But what you are about to learn in this chapter and the chap-
ters that follow is the speciﬁc knowledge you will need to under-
stand my copywriting approach and to become a top copywriter.
In these chapters, I present several axioms. Each one is in
bold type and each one is critical to your understanding of my
philosophy. The axiom presented in this chapter is very impor-
tant and very difﬁcult to believe at ﬁrst. Understand this concept,
believe in it and it will give you a good foundation for your fu-
ture writing skills. Don’t believe in it and you’ll fall into the trap
that many copywriters typically fall into.

To introduce the concept, let’s look at the CB radio ad on
the next page, which ran from 1975 through 1977. The ad has all
the elements you would expect any space ad to have. And to un-
derstand this ﬁrst axiom, I would ask my students to deﬁne the
purpose of each of the 10 elements in an advertisement. The fol-
lowing is what we ﬁnally decided:

1. Headline:  To  get  your  attention  and  draw  you  to  the  sub-

headline.

2. Subheadline: To give you more information and further ex-

plain the attention-getting headline.

3. Photo or Drawing: To get your attention and to illustrate the

product more fully.

4. Caption:  To  describe  the  photo  or  drawing. This  is  an  im-

portant element and one that is often read.

27

U N D E R S T A N D I N G   T H E   P R O C E S S

28

T H E   P U R P O S E   O F   A L L   T H E   G R A P H I C   E L E M E N T S   O F   A N   A D

5. Copy: To convey the main selling message for your product

or service.

6. Paragraph  Headings: To  break  up  the  copy  into  chunks,

thereby making the copy look less imposing.

7. Logo: To display the name of the company selling the prod-

uct.

8. Price: To  let  the  reader  know  what  the  product  or  service
costs. The price could be in large type or could be buried in the
copy.

9. Response Device: To give the reader a way to respond to the
ad, by using the coupon, toll-free number or ordering infor-
mation, usually near the end of the ad.

10. Overall Layout: To provide the overall appearance for the
ad, by using effective graphic design for the other elements.

After  they  clearly  understood  each  of  the  elements  that
comprise a direct response ad, I then told the class that there is a
singular purpose for all the elements in an ad—a purpose so im-
portant that it constitutes one of the essential concepts in my ap-
proach to copy.

When  you  were  ﬁrst  attracted  to  the  ad  you  might  have
looked  at  the  photo  at  the  top  of  the  page  or  the  other  photos.
You might have then read the headline, read the subheadline and
then glanced down to the name of the company selling the prod-
uct. You may have read the captions to both the pictures and the
sketches and you may have noticed the toll-free number indicat-
ing that you could order the product on the phone.

When you looked at the ad overall, you may have noticed
the layout, the paragraph headings scattered about the layout and
the attractive graphic and typographic presentation.

There  are  plenty  of  elements  that  can  draw  your  attention
before you start reading the copy. But one of the most important
axioms  you  will  learn  for  becoming  a  great  copywriter  is  my
second axiom. Here it is:

All the elements in an advertisement are primarily designed to
do one thing and one thing only: get you to read the ﬁrst sen-
tence of the copy.

Axiom 2

29

U N D E R S T A N D I N G   T H E   P R O C E S S

At this point, there was usually a confused look on the faces
of my students. They thought that each of these elements had its
own  reason  for  existence.  But  I  was
saying, “No, they are there strictly for
the sole purpose of getting you to read
the ﬁrst sentence.”

I  know  what  you’re  thinking.
“What about the headline? Isn’t it sup-
posed  to  have  a  beneﬁt,  be  16  words
long  and  what  about . . .”  Stop.  Just
accept my word at this point that each element has a single pur-
pose and that is to get you to read the ﬁrst sentence. Don’t ques-
tion  me.  Don’t  jump  to  any  conclusions.  Just  remember  this
axiom.

This means if somebody asks you, “With the Sugarman ap-
proach to copywriting, what is the purpose of the subheadline in
the  ad?”  don’t  answer,  “A subheadline  is  designed  to  give  you
more  information  and  to  further  explain  the  attention-getting
headline.”

Neither of the above reasons is as important as the fact that

the subheadline is designed to get the reader to read the copy.

If somebody asked you for the main purpose of the logo in
an advertisement, you could answer, “To establish the corporate
identity  of  the  company  selling  the  product,”  or  you  could  an-
swer, “To provide a degree of continuity.” But the real answer is
to get you to read the copy. Really.

If you don’t believe it, have patience and I will prove it to
you. But if you’ll open your mind and just accept what I tell you,
you will eventually realize that what I am saying is correct. Most
importantly, though, when you realize this and start writing with
this in the back of your mind, you’ll be amazed at the change in
your results—whether your copy is in a print ad or on a web site.
But like I said, just take my word for it now and let me prove it
to you later in this book.

Each element
should lead you to
the ﬁrst sentence.

30

The First Sentence Chapter 5

If the purpose of all the elements in an ad is therefore to get you
to read the copy, then what we are really talking about is reading
the ﬁrst sentence, aren’t we? What does this tell you about the
ﬁrst sentence? Pretty important, isn’t it? And if the ﬁrst sentence
is pretty important, what do you hope the person who looks at
your ad does? Read it, of course. If the reader doesn’t read your
very  ﬁrst  sentence,  chances  are  that  he  or  she  won’t  read  your
second sentence.

Now if the ﬁrst sentence is so important, what can you do to
make it so compelling to read, so simple, and so interesting that
your  readers—every  one  of  them—will  read  it  in  its  entirety?
The answer: Make it short.

If you look at many typical JS&A ads, you’ll notice that all
of my ﬁrst sentences are so short they almost aren’t sentences.
Some typical ones might be:

Losing weight is not easy.
It’s you against a computer.
It’s easy.
It had to happen.
Hats off to IBM.

Each sentence is so short and easy to read that your reader
starts to read your copy almost as if being sucked into it. Think
about the analogy of a locomotive. When the locomotive starts
to chug from a standing start, it really works hard. The amount
of commitment and energy that the train must exert is monumen-
tal. But once the train starts to move, the next few feet become
easier and the next few even easier. So it is with copy.

Magazines Use This Technique
Many  magazines  use  a  variation  of  this  technique  in  their  arti-
cles.  They  start  an  article  not  with  a  very  short  sentence  but

31

U N D E R S T A N D I N G   T H E   P R O C E S S

maybe  with  very  large  type.  Once  they  have  you  sucked  into
reading the copy and you turn the page to read the rest of the arti-
cle,  you  notice  that  the  typeface  has  gotten  smaller.  But  that’s
okay. The purpose of the large type was to get you into the arti-
cle and it worked. Now it’s up to the author to keep you reading
and turning the pages.

In an advertisement, you’ve got a lot going against you un-
less the readers are genuinely interested in your product. And if
they are, then you’ve got to really grab and keep them. So your
ﬁrst  sentence  should  be  very  compelling  by  virtue  of  its  short
length and ease of reading. No long multisyllabic words. Keep it
short, sweet and almost incomplete so that the reader has to read
the next sentence.

If all the elements are designed to get you to read the ﬁrst
sentence in an ad, then what is the purpose of the ﬁrst sentence?
If  you  guessed  that  it  is  to  “convey  a  beneﬁt  or  explain  a  fea-
ture,” that would be impossible. How could a short ﬁrst sentence
do anything more than get you to read it? The correct answer is,
of course, “The purpose of the ﬁrst sentence is to get you to read
the second sentence.” Nothing more, nothing less. You probably
ﬁgured this one out already anyway.

The Purpose of the Next Sentence
Now if you’re starting to get a feel for my approach to copywrit-
ing and I asked you what the purpose of the second sentence is
and you answered, “To get you to read the third sentence,” you
would be absolutely correct. And for those of you who missed
that  last  answer  and  I  asked  you  what  the  purpose  of  the  third
sentence was and you answered, “To get you to read the fourth
sentence,” congratulations. I think you’ve got it.

Was  there  any  mention  of  beneﬁts?  Or  product  descrip-
tion?  Or  unique  features?  Of  course  not.  The  only  purpose  of
those  ﬁrst  few  sentences  in  an  advertisement  is  to  get  you  to
read the following sentences. True, you may at one point have
to start talking about product features or beneﬁts, but if you lose
sight of the fact that your sole purpose at the beginning of an ad
is  to  hold  that  reader’s  attention  at  almost  any  cost,  then  you

32

T H E   F I R S T   S E N T E N C E

may lose your reader for lack of interest. Therefore we have the
third axiom:

The sole purpose of the ﬁrst sentence in an advertisement is to
get you to read the second sentence.

Axiom 3

Just compare the situation in our ad example with a sales-
person selling somebody face-to-face. If the ﬁrst few minutes of
the sales presentation put the prospective customer to sleep or if
the customer stops hearing the presentation and walks away, that
salesperson has lost everything. So in copywriting as in selling,
if your reader is not riveted to every word you write in the ﬁrst
few sentences, then your chances of having that reader get to the
real sales pitch are very remote.

My  most  successful  ads  have  followed  this  format,  with
very  few  exceptions. What  about  making  the  sales  pitch  at  the
beginning of an ad? This is certainly possible, of course, but then
it is often not very effective. I’ve tried putting the sales message
at the beginning of an ad. I’ve tried using every trick in the book
to prove my theory wrong and have failed at each attempt. Just
remember that the sole purpose of all the elements of an ad is to
get you to read the ﬁrst sentence. Make that ﬁrst sentence so easy
to  read  that  your  reader  is  almost  compelled  to  read  it.  If  you
grasp this, you’ve got an awfully good start and a great under-
standing of copywriting and the persuasive process.

33

Creating the Perfect Buying Environment Chapter 6

Besides holding the reader’s attention, there is another impor-
tant function we are trying to accomplish in the ﬁrst paragraphs
of an advertisement and that is to create a buying environment.
Let me cite an example.

Picture  this.  You’re  a  salesperson  and  you  need  to  sell  a
prospect.  You’ve  been  given  a  choice  of  ﬁve  environments  in
which to meet the prospect, and you must pick one.

The  product  you  are  selling  is  very  expensive  and  you’ll
need at least one hour to explain and properly sell the product.
The choices you have are:

1. At noon at a very fancy restaurant near the prospect’s ofﬁce.
2. After lunch in the boardroom at the ofﬁces of the prospect.
3. After  work  at  the  prospect’s  health  club  while  working  out

with him.

4. In  the  evening  with  the  prospect  at  his  home  while  the

prospect babysits his three children.

5. Any of the four above might be an acceptable choice.

The correct answer is 5. Why? Because the correct answer
to  the  question  “Which  is  the  best  location?”  is  simply  “in  the
best selling environment for what you have to sell.”

If the product is a piece of exercise equipment, the health
club might be perfect. If the product has something to do with
parents and children, at home with the prospect and his children
in the evening might be the perfect environment.

Now if the correct answer for the salesperson is “in the en-
vironment best suited for the selling activity,” is it true in print
advertising, too? Yes, but let me cite another example before we
discuss print advertising environments.

35

U N D E R S T A N D I N G   T H E   P R O C E S S

The Honolulu Experience
I was in Honolulu after a trip to the Far East. I usually stop at
Honolulu to recover after traveling so long and so far and over
so  many  time  zones. As  I  was  walking  down  one  of  the  main
streets in Waikiki, I stopped to look into an art gallery and saw a
painting of scenes from outer space.

Since  JS&A was  known  for  selling  space-age  products,  I
thought  that  the  painting  would  ﬁt  very  nicely  in  my  ofﬁce.  I
walked into the gallery noticing how very elegant it looked and
saw  the  paintings  neatly  displayed  on  the  wall.  The  gallery
looked like it sold expensive paintings. In short, I expected the
prices to be high.

It  didn’t  take  too  long  before  a  well-dressed  saleswoman
noticed  me,  walked  over  and  asked  if  I  needed  assistance.
“Beautiful painting, isn’t it?” she asked.

“Very nice,” I nodded. “It really looks great.”
At that point the lady said, “Please follow me,” as she lifted
the painting off the wall and walked toward the back of the large
gallery. I followed.

We entered a large room, carpeted from ﬂoor to ceiling. In
the middle of the room were three very comfortable easy chairs all
facing  the  front  of  the  room  where  the  saleslady  mounted  the
painting  on  the  wall.  She  then  went  back  to  the  entrance  of  the
room, turned up the classical music being piped in through loud-
speakers and dimmed the lights, leaving two spotlights focused on
the painting.

Painting Looked Incredible
I must admit that the painting looked incredible. The vibrant col-
ors, the quality of the art, and the nice feeling I experienced from
hearing the classical music put me in such a buying mood that I
was ready to reach into my pocket and pull out my credit card
and buy the $2,000 painting.

That  lady  and  that  gallery  had  put  me  in  such  a  focused
buying mood by creating the perfect environment for selling me
that painting that I almost bought it right then and there. By the
way, I eventually sponsored the artist, Mark Rickerson, and sold

36

C R E A T I N G   T H E   P E R F E C T   B U Y I N G   E N V I R O N M E N T

his paintings and prints through JS&A. I personally ended
up with 50 of his paintings.

Once you realize the importance of setting up a buying
environment, you’ll know that it must be done in the early
stages of an advertisement. When you establish the reading
momentum at the start of an ad, you also want to start estab-
lishing the buying environment as well. The saleslady ﬁrst
had to get me into the store and then slowly get me in that
room to put me in the ideal buying mood. If this all sounds hard to
do in print, it really isn’t. You’ll see examples later of how to estab-
lish the buying environment as you establish the momentum.

Since you are creating your own environment in a print ad,
you have total control over its appearance. Common sense will
dictate the rest.

For example, if I was selling products at a discount, I would
use big type for my prices and lots of busy graphic elements. In
short, I would make the ad look like a typical discount ad. And
conversely,  if  I  was  selling  something  expensive,  I  would  pre-
sent  myself  in  an  environment  that  showed  class  and  reﬁne-
ment—that exuded conﬁdence and trust.

Unlike the salesperson who may or may not be able to cre-
ate the ideal selling environment, you can create your own. And
unlike the salesperson who sometimes can’t control the environ-
ment, you can.

So  for  selling  products  through  Battram  Galleries,  the  col-
lectibles company I formed, my graphic and copy approach was
upscale and conservative—just what you’d expect from an expen-
sive gallery. However, when I presented my Consumers Hero con-
cept, a club that sold refurbished bargains, it had a totally different
environment—one that was clearly bargain-oriented.

The JS&A ads all had a uniform, well-organized format that
seemed to be the perfect environment for all my space-age elec-
tronic products. I rarely deviated from it, but when I did, it was to
create a better environment for a speciﬁc product I was selling.

You wouldn’t expect to buy an expensive painting from an
Army surplus store and you wouldn’t expect to ﬁnd much of a
bargain at Tiffany’s.

Your copy has
to put the
prospect into a
relaxed buying
environment.

37

U N D E R S T A N D I N G   T H E   P R O C E S S

You Control the Environment
As a writer of direct marketing, you have control over the envi-
ronment.  The  environment  you  choose  is  created  in  both  the
graphic elements and the copy, but especially the copy—by the
way you phrase your words, the choice of words and the level of
integrity you convey.

Unlike  a  store  where  you  spend  thousands  of  dollars  to
create  an  environment,  you  can  do  it  all  simply  in  the  copy  of
your ad or the look of your web site.

The  environment  is  critical  in  getting  a  prospective  cus-
tomer into the buying mood. And to create that environment, you
attract the customer’s attention (the headline, photos, logo, etc.)
and then you’ve got to get the person to read the ﬁrst sentence by
making  it  so  simple  and  so  compelling  that  the  reader  cannot
help but read it. And the next sentence and then the next.

And while the reader is reading, you are creating an envi-
ronment  just  as  surely  as  that  art  gallery  was  drawing  me  into
that back room. So now we are ready for the fourth axiom.

Your  ad  layout  and  the  ﬁrst  few  paragraphs  of  your  ad  must
create  the  buying  environment  most  conducive  to  the  sale  of
your product or service.

Creating the ideal buying environment comes from experi-
ence  and  the  speciﬁc  knowledge  you  get  from  studying  your
product and potential customer. It comes from understanding the
nature  of  your  product  or  service.  Greater  understanding  will
come as you read this book. But for now, realize how important
creating  the  buying  environment  is  to  eventually  selling  your
product.

To understand how we get the reader not only to read, but to
feel comfortable and be in a buying mood in that environment,
let’s take time out for a little lesson on personal sales ability in
general, in the next chapter.

Axiom 4

Resonating with the Reader Chapter 7

When I was only 20 years old, my father sent me to New York
City to run the branch ofﬁce of his printing equipment company,
Consolidated International. He was having ﬁnancial difﬁculties
and I was happy to help him out after my ﬁrst two years in col-
lege. I dropped out of college, and while in New York I took an
interest in salesmanship. I knew that he expected me to eventu-
ally help him sell his equipment, so I set out to prepare myself.
I went to bookstores and bought everything I could on sell-
ing. I read every book available at the public library—all to be-
come  an  expert  in  salesmanship. And  during  that  year  in  New
York  I  would  stroll  down  Broadway  and  visit  small  auction
shops located right on Times Square.

Wonderful Sales Technique
These  small  auction  shops  would  prey  on  unsuspecting  ob-
servers by appealing to their greed. The shop’s proprietor would
auction off what appeared to be terriﬁc bargains, hook one of the
prospective bidders in the audience and create a buying frenzy
that plenty of the onlookers would get sucked into. The bidders
ended up buying junk that wasn’t much of a bargain. The sales
techniques were wonderful to watch and I spent hours just ob-
serving them and human nature.

Then  I  would  go  back  to  my  small  apartment  and  read
more books on selling. It wasn’t easy for a young, inexperienced
20-year-old  to  sell  expensive  and  complicated  printing  equip-
ment.  I  thought  that  if  I  could  become  an  expert  on  selling  in
general  and  printing  equipment  in  particular  and  then,  through
experience, pick up speciﬁc knowledge about selling the equip-
ment, I could be an effective salesman for my dad.

Selling  was  something  I  was  suited  for.  In  the  preference
tests I took in high school, my highest score was in a category
called “persuasion” and another high score was in “literary.” My

39

U N D E R S T A N D I N G   T H E   P R O C E S S

career  in  advertising  could  have  been  predicted  even  back  in
high  school,  for  when  you  think  about  it,  print  advertising  is
nothing more than “literary persuasion.”

Some of the signiﬁcant lessons I learned in New York were
the steps in selling a prospect, which also apply to selling in print
advertising. Let me review the procedure.

The ﬁrst thing you do in selling is to set up the selling envi-
ronment.  Whether  it  be  a  private  room  in  a  gallery  or  a  car
dealer’s  showroom,  you  conﬁgure  the  physical  environment  to
be your selling environment.

Next,  you  have  to  get  the  attention  of  the  prospect.  That
certainly makes sense and is related to the headline of a print ad.
Once you have the prospect’s attention, the next step is to
introduce yourself and say something that will keep the atten-
tion of the prospect. This is similar to the subheadline and the
photos and captions. Then comes the sales pitch or the copy in
a print ad.

During  this  activity,  the  seller  has  two  thoughts  in  mind.
The  ﬁrst  is  that  the  buyer  must  like  and  develop  conﬁdence  in
the seller. The buyer must believe that the seller knows the prod-
uct.  Second,  the  seller  must  somehow  relate  the  product  to  the
buyer and the buyer’s needs. That’s clear. But the buyer and the
seller must vibrate together. There must be a harmony struck be-
tween  the  buyer  and  seller,  or  the  persuasive  sales  message
won’t come through.

There are many methods for creating this
harmony and two of the most important apply
very directly to space advertising. First, you’ve
got to get the prospective reader to start saying
yes.  Second,  you’ve  got  to  make  statements
that  are  both  honest  and  believable.  Let’s  cite
an  example.  A car  salesman  says,  “Nice  day,
Mr. Jones.” Mr. Jones then answers, “Yes.” (It
is  a  nice  day,  the  statement  is  truthful  and  the
customer answers in the afﬁrmative.)
“I see, Mr. Jones, that you keep your car very clean.” “Yes, I
do.”  (At  this  point,  the  salesman  has  Mr.  Jones  saying  yes  and
nodding his head.) “I see, Mr. Jones, that since you now own a

Get the customer
to nod in the
afﬁrmative and
agree with you.

40

Buick and we sell Buicks, you probably could use a
new one?” “Yes.” (The salesman asks a rather obvi-
ous  question  and  Mr.  Jones,  nodding,  replies  in  the
afﬁrmative.)

“May  I  show  you  one  of  our  latest  models
with  improvements  over  the  model  you  currently
own?”  “Yes.”  (The  salesman  once  again  says
the obvious to get a yes answer, and the harmony
continues.)

In short, you try to get the customer to nod his or her head
in the afﬁrmative and agree with you, or at least you make truth-
ful  statements  that  the  prospect  knows  are  correct  and  would
concur with. Make sure that the prospect does not disagree with
something  you’re  saying.  If  for  example  the  salesman  said,
“Could you use a new Buick?” and the customer said “No,” the
sale  would  have  taken  a  bad  turn  right  there  and  the  harmony
would  have  been  lost.  In  a  print  ad,  the  reader  would  have
stopped reading and turned the page.

Harmony Is the Key
The  moment  you  get  the  reader  to  say  “No”  or  even  “I  really
don’t believe what he is saying” or “I don’t think that relates to
me,” you’ve lost the reader. But as long as the reader keeps say-
ing yes or believes what you are saying is correct and continues
to  stay  interested,  you  are  going  to  be  harmonizing  with  the
reader and you and the reader will be walking down that path to-
ward that beautiful room in the art gallery.

To show you a speciﬁc approach to this method, let’s take
an example from an ad I wrote for one of my seminar partici-
pants. Entitled “Food Crunch,” it offered dehydrated survival
food. On occasion, when one of my students wrote a good ad
that  did  not  succeed,  I  would  help  him  or  her  by  either  sug-
gesting minor copy changes or sometimes rewriting the entire
ad myself if I felt I had a better overall concept. The ﬁrst ad,
by John Sauer, was written right after our major fuel crunch in
1973, when there were lines of cars at gas pumps that had little
or no fuel to pump. The ad is shown on the next page with my
ad  above  it.  John  chose  the  concept  of  insurance  as  the  best
approach  in  his  ad.  I  felt  that  insurance  put  people  to  sleep.

Get your reader to
say “Yes.”

41

U N D E R S T A N D I N G   T H E   P R O C E S S

See if you agree with the copy statements in my ad as I
tie  in  the  then-current  feelings  of  helplessness  during
the fuel shortage with John’s product.

We  all  take  our  food  supply  for  granted. And  for  good
reason. Americans have always had plenty. But we may
be heading for one of the most serious periods in our his-
tory. Let me explain.

The ad then goes on to explain the writer’s ﬁrst-
hand experience of arriving at a supermarket right af-
ter  the  news  of  the  Kennedy  assassination  only  to
discover that the shelves were bare and that people in
time  of  distress  or  calamity  think  ﬁrst  of  their  own
survival.

Notice  that  the  reader’s  attention  was  riveted. The
headline,  “Food  Crunch,”  and  subheadline,  “We’ve  all
experienced the fuel shortage and most of us were unpre-
pared. Will you be prepared for the food crunch?” caused
us to read the ﬁrst sentence. The ﬁrst sentence was short
and  the  typical  American  who  could  afford  this  offer
would  nod  his  or  her  head  in  the  afﬁrmative.  The  sen-
tences  were  both  interesting  and  true  and  caused  the
reader to start nodding his or her head.

So now we have three things we are trying to do
at the beginning of an ad. First we want the reader to
read  the  copy.  Remember,  that’s  the  objective  of  all
copy.  Without  the  prospect  reading  the  ad,  you  have
nothing.

Then  we  create  the  type  of  environment  through
copy that causes the prospect to feel comfortable in ex-
changing his or her hard-earned money for your prod-
uct  or  service.  And  ﬁnally,  we  want  the  prospect  to
harmonize  with  us—to  agree  with  us—by  feeling  that  indeed
we are saying something that is truthful, interesting and infor-
mative and that the prospect can agree with. In short, we want
agreement.  We  want  that  head  to  nod  in  the  afﬁrmative.  We
want harmony.

Which ad would
you read ﬁrst
right after the
fuel crunch?

42

R E S O N A T I N G   W I T H   T H E   R E A D E R

Look what Cycle magazine did to create the perfect
harmony with me when they tried to get me to buy media
in their magazine. They created a knockoff of my ad for-
mat  and  sent  it  to  me  with  a  copy  style  that  resembled
mine. Of course it could have backﬁred if I was upset that
they were copying me, but they also knew that I would
quickly  recognize  the  format  and  the  effort  they  were
making to land me as a customer and that I would respect
their creativity. Indeed I harmonized with their effort and
bought some space in their magazine.

Another  illustration  of  this  concept  is  in  the  ad  I
wrote trying to appeal to bargain hunters for a company
called Consumers Hero. After a few sentences the copy
read as follows:

Consumers  are  being  robbed.  Inﬂation  is  stealing  our
purchasing  power.  Our  dollars  are  shrinking  in  value.
The  poor  average  consumer  is  plundered,  robbed  and
stepped on.

If you were a consumer looking for bargains when inﬂation
was skyrocketing during the years when I wrote this, you would
very  likely  be  in  harmony  after  that  brief  paragraph.  I  used
words  that  the  consumer  could  relate  to.  I  spoke  in  the  con-
sumer’s language.

A top-producing  salesman  once  said  to  me,  “Joe,  I  really
admire you. I can sell anybody on a one-to-one basis. Put me up
against the toughest customers and I’ll melt them down and sell
them. But you have the ability to do that on a scale that dwarfs
mine. When you sell, you manage to duplicate yourself and sell
millions of people all at the same time.”

And that’s what is so incredible about selling in print. You
can duplicate yourself on billions of pages. You’ve got to be able
to reproduce a selling job in print that will harmonize with the
consumer,  and  then  you’ve  got  the  essence  of  a  powerful  tool
that will bring you rewards for the rest of your life in all forms of
communication whether they be in print or on TV or in any of
the new electronic media of the future.

This is the ad that
Cycle magazine
created as a sales
tool to harmonize
with JS&A and
convince us to buy.

43

U N D E R S T A N D I N G   T H E   P R O C E S S

So our ﬁfth axiom is simply:

Axiom 5

Get  the  reader  to  say  yes  and  harmonize  with  your  accurate
and truthful statements while reading your copy.

Now you have the basis for another very important princi-

ple in writing effective copy.

44

The Slippery Slide

Chapter 8

By now you have learned several very important points about
copywriting. First, you learned that you have, in your life, expe-
rienced general knowledge through your actions, circumstances
and  personality.  You  have  also  been  given  the  tools  to  obtain
speciﬁc  knowledge,  such  as  the  ability  to  inquire,  read  and  re-
search.  Then  you  learned  that  practice  is  a  great  teacher—that
the more you write, the better you get. And ﬁnally you learned
that copywriting is the mental process of transferring what is in
your head onto a sheet of paper.

Then  we  got  into  the  pure  Sugarman  stuff.  We  learned
what most people think elements like the headline and captions
do  for  a  typical  ad. And  then  we  learned  what  I  believe  their
primary purpose is: to get the reader to read the ﬁrst
sentence.

And if you remember, we said that the sole pur-
pose  of  the  ﬁrst  sentence  is  to  get  prospects  to  read
the second sentence and that the sole purpose of the
second sentence is to get them to read the third and then the
fourth—all  while  you  are  building  a  selling  environment  for
the sale of your product.

We also compared the selling process in print to what a live
and in-person salesperson does. You learned that ideally, as your
reader starts reading your copy, you get the reader to start nod-
ding in agreement with everything you say.

So  now  the  reader  is  reading  your  ﬁrst  few  sentences,  is
feeling comfortable in the environment you have created and is
nodding  in  agreement.  Now  comes  the  critical  part  called  the
“slippery slide.”

Picture  a  steep  slide  at  a  playground.  Now  picture  some-
body  putting  baby  oil  or  grease  along  the  entire  length  of  the
slide including the side rails. Picture yourself now climbing up

45

U N D E R S T A N D I N G   T H E   P R O C E S S

the ladder, sitting at the top of the slide and then letting gravity
force you down the slide.

As  you  start  to  slide  down  and  build  momentum,  you  try
holding on to the sides to stop, but you can’t stop. You continue
to  slide  down  the  slide  despite  all  your  efforts  to  prevent  your
descent. This is the way your copy must ﬂow.

Every element in an advertisement must cause that slippery
slide  effect. The  headline  must  be  so  powerful  and  compelling
that you must read the subheadline, and the subheadline must be
so powerful that you are compelled to read the ﬁrst sentence, and
the ﬁrst sentence must be so easy to read and so compelling that
you must read the next sentence and so on, straight through the
entire copy to the end.

The Force of “Reading Gravity”
I  once  received  a  letter  from  a  reader  of  Scientiﬁc  American
magazine  in  response  to  one  of  our  ads  on  thermostats.  The
lady who sent me the typewritten letter told me that she had no
need for a thermostat, was not interested in the subject, rarely
reads advertisements and when she does, she just scans through
them. But, she went on, “I am a busy scientist. When I started
reading  your  ad,  I  wasted  ﬁve  minutes  of  my  valuable  time
reading  the  entire  thing  and  I  was  so  upset  at  the  complete
waste of my time, that I wanted to write you and complain.” As
a  copywriter,  I  couldn’t  have  gotten  a  more  complimentary
complaint letter.

If you can get the majority of the people who scan a maga-
zine to read your ad, maybe you won’t sell every one of them but
you will sell a good percentage. Creating the slippery slide will
cause people to “trafﬁc” your ad—to go through the entire text
of your ad and then decide if they want to buy.

Trafﬁc is a good word in retail selling. Any shopping center
that  can  draw  increased  trafﬁc  will  have  increased  sales  for  its
stores. But the trafﬁc generated by these stores can only be com-
pared  to  the  people  who  actually  read  your  copy.  That’s  why
some  of  the  greatest  magazines  with  the  largest  circulations  do
not guarantee the success of your advertisement. Trafﬁc is strictly
the number of people who get into your copy. When I say “get

46

T H E   S L I P P E R Y   S L I D E

into,” I mean falling down the slippery slide all the way through
to the end of your copy.

Creating  the  slippery  slide  effect  is  not  that  difﬁcult  once
the reader is well into your copy. In fact, it’s been proven that if a
reader  reads  more  than  25  percent  of  your  ad,  there  is  a  great
probability that he or she will read the entire ad. So once you’ve
grabbed your reader at the start of your ad with your perfect en-
vironment  and  once  they’re  reading  your  compelling  ﬁrst  sen-
tence, you’ve got them started down the slippery slide.

Slippery Slide Examples
Let’s look at a few examples of the use of the slippery slide in
some of the advertising I’ve written through the years. I referred
to  the  thermostat  ad  earlier,  so  let’s  start  with  that.  The  copy
starts out with the following headline, subheadline and ﬁrst two
paragraphs:

Headline: Magic Baloney
Subheadline: You’ll love the way we hated the Magic Stat ther-
mostat until an amazing thing happened.
Picture  Caption: It  had  no  digital  readout,  an  ugly  case  and  a
stupid name. It almost made us sick.
Copy: You’re probably expecting our typical sales pitch, but get
ready for a shock. For instead of trying to tell you what a great
product the Magic Stat thermostat is, we’re going to tear it apart.
Unmercifully.
When we ﬁrst saw the Magic Stat, we took one look at the name
and went, “Yuck.” We took one look at the plastic case and said,
“How cheap looking.” And when we looked for the digital read-
out, it had none. So before the salesman even showed us how it
worked, we were totally turned off.

Now if you’re reading the above ad, you’re starting down
the slippery slide unable to stop. You might ﬁnd yourself reading
the copy even though you have no intention of buying a thermo-
stat by mail. You’re curious. What’s the gimmick?

The environment was set by the very clean layout. The tone
of the ad was one of a ﬂip, sarcastic and skeptical company ex-
ploring the possibility of selling a product that we were not very
impressed with.

47

U N D E R S T A N D I N G   T H E   P R O C E S S

Of course the rest of the ad told of how we discovered a few
nice points and then a few more and then some really great fea-
tures and ﬁnally decided that this was one great product. At the
end of the ad, we ﬁnished with:

Beauty  is  only  skin  deep  and  a  name  doesn’t  really  mean  that
much.  But  we  sure  wish  those  guys  at  Magic  Stat  would  have
named their unit something more impressive. Maybe something
like Twinkle Temp.

That single ad ran more than three years and not only gen-
erated large volume for us but propelled the Magic Stat people
to become one of the major thermostat contenders nationwide.

Another example of the slippery slide theory is in my ad for

a company I started that sold bargains, called Consumers Hero.

Picture yourself scanning through a magazine and coming

across the following copy:

Headline: HOT
Subheadline: A new consumer concept lets you buy stolen mer-
chandise if you’re willing to take a risk.
Highlighted  Copy  Block: Impossible-to-trace  Guarantee—We
guarantee  that  our  stolen  products  will  look  like  brand-new
merchandise  without  any  trace  of  previous  brand  identiﬁcation
or ownership.

Well, if you’re like most readers, you had to start reading

the copy. How could you help but read it?

Copy: We developed an exciting new consumer marketing con-
cept. It’s called “stealing.” That’s right, stealing!
Now if that sounds bad, look at the facts. Consumers are being
robbed.  Inﬂation  is  stealing  our  purchasing  power.  Our  dollars
are shrinking in value. The poor average consumer is plundered,
robbed and stepped on.
So  the  poor  consumer  tries  to  strike  back.  First,  he  forms  con-
sumer  groups.  He  lobbies  in  Washington.  He  ﬁghts  price  in-
creases. He looks for value.
So we developed our new concept around value. Our idea was
to  steal  from  the  rich  companies  and  give  to  the  poor  con-
sumer, save our environment and maybe, if we’re lucky, make
a buck.

48

T H E   S L I P P E R Y   S L I D E

I then went into the concept, which was our plan to take de-
fective merchandise, repair it and then make it available to the
consumers through a club that cost $5 to join. Newsletters were
sent  to  members  offering  the  products.  One  of  the  paragraphs
near the end of the ad summed it up beautifully:

So that’s our concept. We recycle “lousy rotten” garbage into su-
per  new  products  with  ﬁve-year  warranties.  We  steal  from  the
rich manufacturers and give to the poor consumer. We work hard
and make a glorious proﬁt.

The Magic Stat and Consumers Hero ad examples are but
two of the many I’ve written through the years that illustrate the
slippery slide theory. Once you start reading the headline, which
forces you eventually down to the ﬁrst sentence, you are in my
slide. And then I take you all the way to the bottom of that slide
so before you know it you’ve read the entire ad. You’ve been in
my  store;  you  entered  and  didn’t  get  out  until  you  fully  exam-
ined the merchandise I offered you. I took you into my private
room and gave you a demonstration of my product in an envi-
ronment that was so compelling, you couldn’t help but buy. And
I did it with integrity and honesty while getting you to nod your
head as I sold you.

That’s what the slippery slide is all about: getting your reader

to read all of the copy. So a major axiom of mine is simply:

Your  readers  should  be  so  compelled  to  read  your  copy  that
they  cannot  stop  reading  until  they  read  all  of  it  as  if  sliding
down a slippery slide.

As  we  explained  earlier,  one  of  the  most  important  ele-
ments in creating the slippery slide is the start of your ad copy. I
often will start my copy with a story or even pick up a piece of
news  from  a  magazine  that  I  feel  would  be  of  interest  to  my
readers. The story is often offbeat, always interesting and a great
short story.

A good  example  of  this  technique  is  the  story  about  a
trusted accountant who was caught embezzling money from his
company. Here’s the copy I wrote based on that article and the
very unusual connection I made to the product I was selling:

Axiom 6

49

U N D E R S T A N D I N G   T H E   P R O C E S S

Headline: Last Wish
Subheadline: He was a prisoner conﬁned to a cell block. “Give
him one last wish,” pleaded his wife.
Copy: George Johnson is in a state penitentiary for a white-col-
lar crime. His seven-year sentence gives him plenty of time to
exercise.
Johnson, 36 years old, always took care of himself. He exercised
regularly, ate good food and took vitamins. But he got greedy. As
a company accountant he kept issuing bogus checks to “Cashin
Electric Company” for electrical contracting work.
One day his boss noticed the large payments being made to the
Cashin  Electric  Company  and  discovered  that  the  outﬁt  didn’t
exist. Johnson was actually typing out checks to “Cash,” cashing
them himself and then after the checks cleared the bank and were
returned  to  his  company,  he  carefully  typed  on  the  checks  “in
Electric Company” after the word “Cash.” Since he was a trusted
accountant, who would suspect?

WIFE MORE SYMPATHETIC
His wife was more sympathetic than was the judge. She wanted
to  help  her  husband  and  suggested  he  pick  an  exercise  product
for his cell—something that was easy to store and could give him
a complete workout. And the prison agreed. Johnson chose a Pre-
cor precision rower. Here’s why.

I  then  described  the  Precor  rower  and  how  beneﬁcial  it
was  for  your  entire  body,  how  it  stored  easily  out  of  the  way
and  why  George  selected  the  product  for  his  primary  exer-
cise device.

Later in the ad I admitted the liberty I had taken with the

story out of frustration. The copy ended with the following:

Before I tell you which rower Johnson selected, I have a confes-
sion  to  make.  I  love  the  Precor  line  of  rowers  so  much  that  I
probably committed a crime too. The story about Cashin Electric
Company  is  true.  Some  trusted  accountant  was  sent  to  prison.
But his name wasn’t Johnson and his wife never called JS&A to
order a thing, let alone a rower.
But one night, while I was trying my hardest to ﬁgure out a new
way to share my enthusiasm for the Precor rowers, I started get-
ting  a  little  silly  and  concocted  this  dumb  story  about  Johnson
and his interest in the rower. Copywriting is not easy and some-
times you go a little bonkers.

50

T H E   S L I P P E R Y   S L I D E

I  then  ﬁnished  the  ad  with  a  selection  of  rowers  and  my
usual close. In this case the offbeat article about Cashin Electric
Company had nothing to do with the product I was offering but
it created a very strong beginning for my slippery slide.

The news item could have nothing to do with your product
or  it  could  tie  in  perfectly.  For  example,  I  was  reading  Forbes
magazine, and in the “Informer” section there was an article en-
titled “Growth Market.” The copy read as follows:

It  looks  like  U.S.  underwear  manufacturers  have  overlooked  a
potential  growth  market. According  to  a  survey  of  1,000  adult
Brits  conducted  by  London-based  Survey  Research Associates,
one in ten British men wears the same underpants two or three
days  running.  One  in  a  hundred  wears  the  same  pair  all  week.
Half the women polled said they kept wearing underwear after it
went gray with age.

I would cut out articles just like this one and keep a collec-
tion  of  them. And  then  when  appropriate,  I  would  use  one  of
them to begin an ad that somewhat related to the news item.

For example, I was in England appearing on QVC, the TV
home  shopping  network.  QVC  has  a  branch  ofﬁce  in  England
and I often appeared on TV selling my products there. While in
the lounge waiting to go on the air, I met a man who showed me
a new product he was presenting called Scrub Balls. They were
simply nine golfball-sized spheres that you put in your washing
machine with your laundry. They sloshed around scrubbing the
clothes to bring out more dirt and make the clothes cleaner and
whiter.  They  also  saved  on  detergent  and  made  your  clothes
cleaner while using less water. If I were marketing that product
in print, I might pull out that Forbes article and start my ad with
something like the following:

Headline: British Men Have Underwear Problem
Subheadline: New survey shows that many British men do not
change their underwear for up to three days, and some even as
long as a week.
Copy:  Holy  Odor  Eaters!  Has  Britain  got  a  problem.  It  seems
that  the  men  in  Britain  don’t  change  their  underwear  often  and
the survey mentioned above shows that many men change their
underwear  just  once  a  week.  But  there’s  an  important  question
I’d like to ask you.

51

U N D E R S T A N D I N G   T H E   P R O C E S S

How often do you change yours? If you’re like most Americans,
you change it every day. And as an American, you probably use
more detergent than most Britons. But there is one more surprise
that you may not realize, either. Americans have a serious waste
problem. Let me explain.

I would then go on to explain how we waste our resources
by  not  efﬁciently  washing  our  clothes  and  that  there  was  this
product  I  discovered  in  England  called  Scrub  Balls  and  how
efﬁciently  it  cleaned  your  clothes  with  less  water  and  laundry
detergent.

I could also use the same article to sell an electronic product

simply by saying:

Now  you  probably  wonder  what  dirty  British  underwear
has  to  do  with  this  new  pocket-sized  computer.  I’m  glad
you asked. It has nothing to do with it except for one impor-
tant fact that I will reveal shortly. But ﬁrst let me explain an
unimportant fact.

I would then go into the computer features, play-
ing off British men, and I would use odor or smell to
relate to some of the computer features. I would then
come up with a computer feature at the end of the ad
that would tie into the story.

Save Those Articles
I realize that it may seem a little far-fetched to sell a
rower tied into an embezzlement story or a computer
using  that  Forbes  article  on  British  underwear  habits.  But  the
point I am making is simply this: The use of an interesting article
or bit of information, when tied into your product or service, of-
ten  makes  for  a  good  start  to  the  slippery  slide.  And  when
blended nicely with your product, it can work to cause a reader
to read every bit of your copy. So save those offbeat articles you
come  across  that  tweak  your  interest  and  might  interest  your
readers—regardless of how ridiculous or offbeat they may be.

Some magazines create the slippery slide by simply starting
out their stories with larger type to get you into the copy. Larger
type is easier to read and so you tend to start reading the copy,

Quest/80 maga-
zine started

52

T H E   S L I P P E R Y   S L I D E

which  may  seem  less  imposing.  Quest/80 magazine  (no  longer
around) started the copy of an article on the front cover and then
continued  it  inside  the  magazine  to  get  you  into  their  slippery
slide.  Many  articles  written  for  magazines  use  similar  graphic
elements  to  get  you  into  their  stories.  Of  course,  the  key  is  to
make the copy so compelling that once you start reading it, you
can’t put it down. And there are even more techniques to create
the slippery slide that I will cover later in this book.

You’re now in store for some fun. For in the next few chap-
ters, I’m going to stretch your imagination and then continue to
build the foundation we’ve been building in Section One of this
book. So stay with me as we cover the timely topic of assumed
constraints.

53

Assumed Constraints Chapter 9

Have  you  ever  looked  at  a  circus  elephant  anchored  to  the
ground?  If  you  have,  you  might  notice  that  the  elephant  has  a
metal  collar  around  its  leg  to  which  is  attached  a  small  chain.
And  the  chain  is  attached  to  a  wooden  peg  driven  into  the
ground. Pretty good protection?

Pretty  lousy,  if  you  ask  me.  That  12,000-pound  elephant
could very easily pick up its foot and with one fell swoop yank
the  peg  out  of  the  ground  and  walk  away.  But  the  elephant
doesn’t. Why? I’ll explain.

When  that  elephant  was  still  a  baby,  that  same  collar  and
chain and peg were used to hold the elephant in place. The re-
straint was sufﬁcient to hold the baby elephant in place even if it
wanted to break away. And break away is indeed what the baby
elephant tried to do.

So every day while the baby was chained up, it would pull
at the chain and pull and pull until ﬁnally a cut appeared on its
leg exposing the sore sensitive layers of deep skin tissue. It hurt
to pull like that and soon the baby elephant, realizing the effort
was both futile and painful, stopped trying to escape.

Elephants Never Forget
As the baby elephant grew older, it never forgot that bad experi-
ence  with  the  chain  and  the  peg. And  so  whenever  it  was  an-
chored down in a spot, it would think, “Hey, it’s impossible to
break away and besides, it hurts.”

The adult elephant had what I call an “assumed constraint.”
And all of us have the same problem to one degree or another.
We all have the power to be great copywriters. But at one point in
our lives, we may have written something and gotten a bad grade
in  English.  Or  we  may  have  attempted  to  communicate  some-
thing in writing to somebody else and had a bad experience as a
result. As we’ve grown older, those hurt feelings, the feelings of

55

U N D E R S T A N D I N G   T H E   P R O C E S S

inadequacy and the wrong guidance we may have received from
teachers or friends are still in our subconscious, and whether we
want to admit it or not, they really do affect us.

If you understand the hurt and you understand some of the
constraints  we  put  upon  ourselves,  then  you  are  better  able  to
cope with breaking out of those assumed constraints and becom-
ing  anything  you  want  to  be  and  accomplishing  anything  you
want to accomplish. Let me cite some examples.

One  of  the  best  is  the  following  nine-point  puzzle.  I  gave
this  puzzle  to  my  students  as  an  example  of  an  assumed  con-
straint. The rules to solve this puzzle are very simple. You must
draw four straight lines and connect all the points without taking
your pen off the page. In short, all the lines have to be connected.
Please do the puzzle before reading on.

Most  people  who  try  to  solve  the  puzzle
make  one  fatal  error  and  it  is  simply  that  they
don’t realize the constraint they subconsciously
put upon themselves. The solution is in Appen-
dix A on page 317. Turn to it now for the answer.
As you can see, you were constrained by
the box surrounding the points and did not go
out of the box in order to ﬁnd the solution. Of-
ten,  to  solve  that  very  important  problem,
you’ve got to go out of the problem area itself
to ﬁnd the answer.

A good  example  of  assumed  constraints
was my choice of mailing lists for my ﬁrst direct
mailing when I sold the ﬁrst pocket calculator by
mail. I had to select 10 mailing lists for my 50,000-piece mailing
and I picked eight good lists that made a lot of sense to me.

I selected engineers, accountants and surveyors, for example.
I selected wealthy people at their home addresses. I chose the mail
order buyers from a certain catalog that sold similar products. But
when  it  came  to  the  last  two  lists,  my  list  broker  suggested  the
presidents of corporations with $20 million in sales or more.

I thought the idea really didn’t make sense. I thought that the
presidents  of  these  companies  would  be  so  busy  that  more  than
likely they wouldn’t even open their own mail and that some secre-

tary would throw my mailing in the garbage. But I went along with
the list broker and to my surprise, those lists he suggested turned
out to be the best ones, while the others really pulled poorly.

I can point to hundreds of assumed constraint examples that

I personally experienced. Here are ﬁve of them:

1. “You can’t sell your airplane for over $190,000.” I sold it for

$240,000 in 10 days.

2. “You  can’t  sell  a  $600  pinball  game  through  the  mail.”  We

sold more than 3,000 of them.

3. “Consumers  will  rip  you  off  if  you  let  them  buy  using  their
credit cards over a toll-free line without having them sign any-
thing.” We launched toll-free order taking in the United States
and  were  very  successful  with  very  few  problems  before
everybody else caught on.

4. “This  calculator  isn’t  selling  at  all  at  retail.  It’s  the  biggest
bomb  in  calculator  history.  How  are  you  going  to  sell  it  via
mail order?” We sold over 30,000 of them at $59.95.

5. “Who would buy sunglasses through the mail? People need to
try them on ﬁrst, and besides, people buy different styles.” We
sold more than 10 million pairs of the same style.

Or  how  about  the  following  three  business  examples  of

other historical assumed constraints:

1. “There  is  no  reason  anyone  would  want  a  computer  in  their
home.” This was said by Ken Olsen, president, chairman and
founder of Digital Equipment Corporation, in 1977.

2. “Computers in the future may weigh no more than 1.5 tons.”
This was quoted by Popular Mechanics magazine forecasting
the relentless march of science in 1949.

3. “The  concept  is  interesting  and  well-formed,  but  in  order  to
earn  better  than  a  ‘C,’ the  idea  must  be  feasible.”  This  was
said by a Yale University management professor in response
to  Fred  Smith’s  paper  proposing  reliable  overnight  delivery
service. Smith then went on to found FedEx.

If you’d like to read more examples of assumed constraints,

look in Appendix A, which lists other historical quotes.

You Never Really Know
I  can  give  you  dozens  of  examples  from  history  and  from  our
company or from friends, but my point is simple. You never re-
ally know what will work or what won’t. If you believe in your
idea, do it. Step out of those assumed constraints.

This concept also applies to coming up with marketing so-
lutions. When  thinking  about  a  problem  or  looking  for  a  solu-
tion, don’t rule anything out. Sometimes that big idea will come
to you if you step out of the traps that we very often fall into. Re-
member Edward de Bono’s concept of lateral thinking, which is
somewhat the opposite of assumed constraints. Step away from
the problem, think of some possible situations that have nothing
to do with the problem and guess what? You’ll be amazed at how
often you ﬁnd a solution.

As you proceed in this book, remember the baby elephant
and the nine-point puzzle and break out of those assumed con-
straints.

Axiom 7

When trying to solve problems, don’t assume constraints that
aren’t really there.

Seeds of Curiosity Chapter 10

We  have  already  learned  that  trafﬁc is  a  key  word  to  any  re-
tailer. A shopping center that increases trafﬁc will generally see
an increase in sales for its stores. And since the trafﬁc generated
by these stores can only be compared to getting a prospect into
your copy, you increase trafﬁc by increasing readership.

One way to increase readership is by applying a theory I call
“seeds of curiosity.” It goes like this. At the end of a paragraph, I
will often put a very short sentence that offers some reason for
the reader to read the next paragraph. I use sentences such as:

But there’s more.
So read on.
But I didn’t stop there.
Let me explain.
Now here comes the good part.

These seeds of curiosity cause you to subconsciously con-
tinue  reading  even  though  you  might  be  at  a  point  in  the  copy
where the copy slows down. This concept is used a lot on TV be-
fore the show host goes to a commercial. She may say, “When
we  come  back,  we’ll  see  something  that  you’ve  never  seen  on
TV before. Stay tuned.” Well, it should be done in print, too. And
here’s why. (Notice how I just used it.)

In print, the ideal situation is to create such interesting and
compelling copy that you don’t need the seeds of curiosity, but
often that is very difﬁcult. And using these seeds of curiosity en-
hances  most  copy.  But  like  every  good  thing,  don’t  overdo  it.
Later in this book I will be showing examples of seeds of curios-
ity at work in many of my ads. Use them; they are very effective.
But there’s another example.

Seeds  of  curiosity  can  be  used  at  the  beginning  of  an  ad
where you mention some beneﬁt or payoff that you are going to
reveal somewhere in your copy. In short, the reader has to read
the entire ad to ﬁnd it. A good example of this technique was in

59

U N D E R S T A N D I N G   T H E   P R O C E S S

our Consumers Hero ad mentioned in Chapter 8 and reproduced
in Chapter 34. In that ad, you had to read the entire copy before
you got to the punch line.

A great example of both seeds of curiosity and trafﬁc is what
happened to me at my ofﬁce. It’s something that I’ve quite frankly
never experienced again but it is very relevant to this subject.

A Very Unusual Call
I received a call one day from a very sensuous-sounding young
woman who called herself Ginger. She started the conversation
with: “Mr. Sugarman, I love you.”

I was a little taken aback and at ﬁrst thought that this was a

practical joke. “Thank you,” I responded. “I love you, too.”

“No, I’m serious,” continued the woman. “I’ve been reading
your advertisements for the past ﬁve years and I love your mind, I
love your thought process and I love your creative personality. I
really believe that I can tell a great deal about you from what you
write and I really believe in you and truly love you.”

I was surprised and then ﬂattered. Even before I received her
call,  I  had  gotten  comments  from  people  who  claimed  that  my
personality really came through in my copy. And I believed it.

If  you  are  dishonest,  it  is  sensed  by  the  reader.  If  you  are
hiding something about a product you are describing, it comes
through. If you’re very creative, it, too, is picked up. And it is the
combination of all of these impressions that creates the buying
environment that we referred to in Chapter 6.

If you study the copy of others, you can sense what they are
like from their copy. You’ll be amazed at how the copy reﬂects
the personality of the person writing it. Any copywriter working
for a CEO of a company will try to reﬂect the personality of the
CEO and not him- or herself. Since I’m the guy who writes all
the copy, you can pretty well tell a lot about my personality. But
back to Ginger.

An Invitation I Couldn’t Refuse
Was Ginger just ﬂattering me or did she have an emotional at-
tachment  to  me  personally  without  having  met  me—strictly
from reading my copy? She continued.

“Mr. Sugarman, you are the only one who could help me. I

60

S E E D S   O F   C U R I O S I T Y

need your help. Please, may I have an appointment to see you,
privately? I promise you that you’ll be very glad to see me.”

When she arrived at my ofﬁce I could see what she meant
when  she  said  that  I’d  be  glad  to  see  her.  She  was  a  beautiful
blonde with long legs and a miniskirt so short I was embarrassed
to have her sit down. “Mr. Sugarman, may I call you Joe?”

“Sure,” I replied, looking away as she adjusted her skirt.
“Joe, I want to be very frank with you. I have admired your
copywriting for years. I’m not even into electronics and gadgets
but I enjoy so much what you do in print that quite frankly I have
a real emotional attachment to you. I know this sounds silly but
when I got in trouble, I couldn’t think of anybody else who could
help me but you. I really need you.”

She paused for a moment as if to hold back tears. She then

continued.

“I run a beauty shop in a shopping center. I know that when
the shopping center is full, I get a percentage of that trafﬁc and they
buy my cosmetics. I also know that when the shopping center is
empty, I get a smaller number of people who come to my store. It’s
almost directly proportional to the trafﬁc in the shopping center.

“So  Joe,  when  I  decided  to  offer  my  cosmetics  in  a  direct
mailing, I thought that if I sent out 50,000 mailing pieces, I would
get a certain percentage of response and I would make a proﬁt. All
I needed was half a percent return rate to make a nice proﬁt.

“I then invested all the money I had to get this 50,000-piece
mailing out. I borrowed from my friends. When I launched the
mailing, the results were so bad I couldn’t believe it. I ended up
with one-tenth of what I needed to break even. I need you to look
over my mailing piece and just tell me what went wrong with it.
And Joe, if you could help me get it to work, I’d be extremely
grateful.”

What Was Her Angle?
Was I being propositioned in return for my help? Was this all a
ploy or a guilt trip to get me to write her next mailing piece? I
was  a  happily  married  man  with  two  children  and  quite  busy
running  my  own  business. And  quite  frankly,  I  didn’t  like  the
idea of somebody trying to use guilt or sex or anything else to

61

U N D E R S T A N D I N G   T H E   P R O C E S S

entice me to write copy or do a mailing piece. Still somewhat re-
served, I said, “Show me the mailing piece.”

Ginger reached for her purse, which was on the ﬂoor, and as
she reached, she exposed even more of her legs. I was convinced
she was in my ofﬁce to seduce me. No question about it now. I
was convinced that she was determined to entice me into writing
copy for her. But I wondered how far she would go. I was soon
to ﬁnd out.

She pulled out her mailing piece and handed it to me. I ex-
amined it for a few minutes, read the copy and studied the entire
package. I also asked her which mailing list she used. “From the
entire local area served by the beauty shop,” she said.

I looked at the mailing again and saw many problems. She
was using a mail-in offer yet her mailing list was not oriented to-
ward  mail  order  buyers—just  the  retail  community—so  it  was
no wonder her mailing didn’t work. Even the copy in the letter
was very poorly written. It was a horrible presentation. It wasn’t
that it looked bad, but it violated many of the principles I discuss
in this book and some that apply to direct mail. I told her the pre-
sentation was not very good and that I wasn’t surprised that the
piece did so badly.

You  already  know  the  principles  on  trafﬁc.  You  already
know from previous examples that unless the recipients read all
of her copy, the mailing most likely won’t work. Of course, she
also used the wrong mailing list and that didn’t help, either.

I Explained the Problems
After I explained to Ginger the problems with her mailing piece
and mailing list, I brought out another very important fact about
direct response advertising. “You can’t spend that kind of money
without testing. That’s one of your problems, too. You just mailed
to too big a list. You could have picked just 5,000 names and not
50,000 names for your mailing. And then you would have known
if the mailing was successful without risking too much money.”

I ﬁnished talking and there was a short pause. As she looked
straight into my eyes, she said, “Can you help me? I mean really
help me? Like write the copy for the mailing piece, help me pick
the proper list and guide me as my mentor?”

62

S E E D S   O F   C U R I O S I T Y

Since I was a little turned off by Ginger’s use of sex and guilt
to get me to do her piece, I responded, “Ginger, I really don’t have
the time. Plus, I have established a seminar in the north woods of
Wisconsin where I take 20 people and teach them as a group. I just
don’t have the time to help you on an individual basis.”

A Shock I Never Expected
What Ginger whispered to me next took me totally by surprise.
In fact, there have been very few times in my life when I have
been at a complete loss for words. But wait. This is a book on
copywriting and not about the secret goings-on behind the doors
of successful direct marketing executives who are perceived by
beautiful cosmetic executives as the answer to their dreams. “Aw
shucks,”  you’re  probably  saying.  “Why  doesn’t  he  ﬁnish  the
damn story and tell us what happened?”

Okay, I will. But not here. I want you to continue uninter-
rupted  with  my  thought  process  on  copywriting,  so  I  have  de-
voted  Appendix  B  on  page  319  to  the  rest  of  the  story—an
episode that actually took place in my ofﬁce and that could be
part of a very steamy novel.

Once you understand the concept of trafﬁc in retailing and
how  it  relates  to  direct  marketing,  then  you  should  realize  how
important  the  slippery  slide  concept  is  in  getting  the  reader  to
read  the  entire  text  of  your  ad. And  one  of  the  most  powerful
techniques to keep your slippery slide greased is the use of seeds
of  curiosity.  Your  readers  must  get  into  your  copy.  They  must
read your headline and be so compelled to read further that they
read  your  subheadline.  Then  they  must  be  so  moved  that  they
read your ﬁrst sentence. And the rest of the copy must be so com-
pelling that by the time your prospects read 50 percent of your ad,
they are helplessly caught in a slippery slide and can’t escape.

Once you understand the slippery slide and the seeds of cu-
riosity, you will have two of the most powerful copywriting tools
you can use.

Keep the copy interesting and the reader interested through
the power of curiosity.

Axiom 8

Copy as Emotion Chapter 11

Up to now we have covered some general principles of copy-
writing. You learned that all the elements of an advertisement are
designed  to  get  prospects  to  read  the  ﬁrst  sentence,  and  we
showed  you  how  to  get  them  to  start  reading  your  copy  by
creating a very simple ﬁrst sentence. And then we told you how
important it is to get the second sentence read and the third and
so  forth. We  mentioned  nothing  about  beneﬁts  or  features  of  a
product  because  the  sole  purpose  of  the  copy  was  to  ﬁrst  get
people to read the copy. The beneﬁts come later.

And then we covered the environment you create at the be-
ginning of your copy. We explained the importance of resonating
with your reader by getting the reader to say yes, believe you or
agree with your assumptions.

We expressed the importance of the reader slipping through
your copy as if on a slippery slide—reading the copy so they can
trafﬁc  your  ad—and  we  gave  the  example  of  Ginger  and  her
failed mailing. And we just showed you how seeds of curiosity
work to keep the slippery slide fully greased.

You’ve Learned Most of My Concept
Armed  with  the  above  principles,  you  have  a  major  portion  of
the  overall  philosophy  of  my  copywriting  concept.  There  are
only a few more points to learn to have the complete foundation
upon which you can build your skills and write great copy.

I  can  still  remember  the  ﬁrst  seminar  when  I  taught  these
same  philosophies.  At  the  end  of  the  course,  a  Texas  farmer
named Frank Schultz, inspired by the seminar, shut himself in a
room at the nearby Holiday Inn motel and wrote his ﬁrst ad for
the grapefruit he wanted to sell nationally in a print campaign in
major magazines.

His very ﬁrst space ad was so powerful that it sold more fruit
than he could pick and ship. He received letters from other promi-
nent copywriters congratulating him on his simple yet beautiful

65

U N D E R S T A N D I N G   T H E   P R O C E S S

ad.  We’ll  study  that  ad  in  Chapter  24,  but  if  knowledge  of  the
principles I teach can make a Texas farmer a great copywriter, it
can do the same for you.

Emotion in Advertising
This chapter is about emotion in advertising. And there are just
three points to remember about the subject.

Emotion Principle 1: Every word has an emotion associated
with it and tells a story.

Emotion Principle 2: Every good ad is an emotional outpour-
ing of words, feelings and impressions.

Emotion  Principle  3: You  sell  on  emotion,  but  you  justify  a
purchase with logic.

Let’s take the last point ﬁrst. Why do you think people buy
the Mercedes-Benz automobile in the United States? Is it because
of the rack and pinion steering or the antilock braking system or
the  safety  features?  Other  cars  have  the  same  features,  so  why
spend a fortune to buy one when, for a fraction of the cost of a
Mercedes,  you  can  get  an American  or  Japanese  car  or  even  a
Volvo that has many of the exact same features?

The  answer:  We  buy  on  emotion  and  justify  with  logic.  I
know that when I ﬁrst bought a Mercedes and my friends saw it,
I told them that the reason I bought it was because of a series of
technical features that I found very impressive. The real reason I
bought the car was not for the technical features at all. I wanted
to  own  a  prestigious  car  and  belong  to  the  crowd  that  drove  a
Mercedes. But when I had to explain the reason for my purchase,
I  ended  up  using  logic—something  that  I  really  believed  was
correct when I used it.

Mercedes Advertising
Look at a Mercedes ad. Since the Mercedes advertising agency
knows the real motivation behind the purchase of their cars, they
focus on the reasons people use to justify their purchase. All their
ads talk about the terriﬁc drive you get or the technical features
that make the car a breed apart. In reality, feature by feature, there
is nothing so revolutionary that it can’t be duplicated in a less ex-

66

C O P Y   A S   E M O T I O N

pensive car. The car is sold by virtue of its emotional appeal and
then justiﬁed in its advertising by an appeal to logic.

Look at the emotion of a message conveyed in the form of a
song. The music is like the vibration or that special harmony that
you work at creating in an advertising message. If the music ap-
peals to the audience and their soul, they are really set up to re-
ceive  the  sales  message—or  in  the  case  of  a  song,  the  words,
which incidentally also have an attached emotion. A song is simi-
lar to an advertisement.

Take a song and say the words without the music and it may
sound  rather  funny.  Steve  Allen  back  in  the  1950s  on  The
Tonight Show would recite the words of a number one hit song
and get lots of laughs reciting, “Ooh pappa doo pappa doo pappa
woo. I love you. Ooh pappa doo da ditty.” Without the music, the
words sounded absolutely ridiculous.

Logic Often Doesn’t Work
In writing copy for an advertisement, often you get your reader in
an  emotional  frame  of  mind  as  a  result  of  the  environment  you
have created, and logic becomes less important. For example, I’ve
always used the phrase near the end of my ads, “If you aren’t ab-
solutely satisﬁed, return your product within 30 days for a prompt
and courteous refund.” Who ever heard of a refund being courte-
ous? It doesn’t matter. The emotion or the feel of that phrase really
says that we are a very respectful and understanding company that
will return your money very promptly. With very few words, I con-
veyed  the  feeling  of  being  a  concerned  company  that  acts
promptly. And even though the phrase makes no logical sense, it
has been picked up by several direct marketers and used in their
catalogs and print ads.

Often,  a  phrase  or  sentence  or  even  a  premise  does  not
have to be correct logically. As long as it conveys the message
emotionally,  it  not  only  does  the  job,  but  does  it  more  effec-
tively than the logical message.

A good example of this was an ad I wrote for a device that
had  a  breakthrough  digital  calculator  display.  The  new  display
showed both alphabetical and numeric characters. And because it
had such a large memory, you could use it to hold the phone num-
bers of your friends along with their names.

67

U N D E R S T A N D I N G   T H E   P R O C E S S

At the time I had two competitors who got hold of the product
ﬁrst  and  came  out  with  advertisements—both  of  which  failed.
There were several reasons they failed, but one of the main reasons
was  the  way  they  pitched  the  product—on  a  logical  level.  They
tried to explain what the term alphanumeric meant in a display and
how much memory the unit had. The ad was ﬁlled with facts and
logic,  and  because  it  was  such  a  new  breakthrough  product  you
would think it would sell just based on logic. It didn’t.

On a lark, I decided to sell a similar product myself in my
catalog. Canon Corporation had approached me and told me that
if I took their product, they would give me an exclusive for sev-
eral months as long as I advertised it nationally.

I  ﬁrst  tested  the  ad  in  my  catalog  and  came  up  with  the
headline “Pocket Yellow Pages” with the subheadline being “Let
your ﬁngers do the data entry with America’s ﬁrst computerized
pocket telephone directory.” Now listen to the emotional version
of the copy.

You’re  stuck.  You’re  at  a  phone  booth  trying  to  ﬁnd  a  phone
number, and people are waiting. You feel the pressure.
To the startled eyes of those around you, you pull out your calcu-
lator, press a few buttons, and presto—the phone number appears
on the display of your calculator. A dream? Absolutely not.

The Emotional Approach
The  ad  was  a  terriﬁc  success.  We  eventually  placed  the  ad  in
dozens  of  magazines  and  while  the  other  competitors  dropped
out,  we  succeeded  handsomely.  But  look  at  the  emotional  ap-
proach I used. There is nothing about the product’s technical ad-
vantages, nothing about the powerful memory of the unit. I just
knew the nature of the product and the person buying this prod-
uct. Each product has an inherent nature, and understanding that
inherent  nature  will  help  you  sell  it.  (I  explained  this  partially
when I talked about the Midex burglar alarm and the insurance
salesman in Chapter 2, “Speciﬁc Knowledge,” and will explain
it in more detail later.) I realized that the product would appeal to
the gadget-motivated person who would want to show it off to
his or her friends. The ad copy reﬂects this speciﬁc knowledge.

Later on in the ad I justiﬁed the purchase with the facts and

68

C O P Y   A S   E M O T I O N

the technology but not too deeply. The real motivation for people to
buy this product was the emotional appeal of the sales message.

I was invited once to speak at New York University to a class
on direct marketing. As I addressed all the students on copywrit-
ing, I told them that if I was handed a product, showed it to the
class  and  told  the  class  to  write  an  ad  on  the  product,  I  would
venture to say that everyone in the class would write a better ad
than  I  would.  I  said,  “Your  grammar  would  be  correct,  your
spelling would be perfect and mine would be just horrible.”

What Comes after the First Draft Is What Counts
But it is what I do after that ﬁrst draft that makes my copy success-
ful compared to the rest of the class. I then went on to explain the
editing process and its importance. But the reason, I explained, for
my ad appearing so poorly written in my ﬁrst draft is because it is
simply an emotional outpouring of my thoughts on the product and
how I feel it should be sold. It is a free release of my emotions.

And as you write copy, keep this in mind. It makes absolutely
no difference what your ﬁrst draft looks like. If you can get all your
feelings  and  emotions  about  the  subject  out  on  paper  and  work
from there, you will have mastered a very important technique.

The  ﬁnal  point  on  the  emotion  of  copy  relates  to  words
themselves.  If  you  realize  that  each  word  has  an  emotion  at-
tached to it—almost like a short story unto itself—then you will
also have a very good understanding of what emotion means in
the copywriting process.

Look at a dictionary not as a collection of words but as a
collection  of  short  stories.  Webster  once  was  quoted  as  saying
that if you took every one of his possessions away and left him
with just his words, he’d get all his possessions back. The power
of words is enormous.

Words Have Strong Emotions Attached
What emotions do you feel when I mention the following words:
Cleveland, rip-off, consumer, farmer, lawyer, Soviet? Cleveland
may have evoked a little laughter as a place you might not con-
sider moving to unless you live in Cleveland, and if you do live
there, please accept my apologies. Cleveland is a very nice city.
But every country has a famous city that everybody makes fun

69

U N D E R S T A N D I N G   T H E   P R O C E S S

of. The Russian comedian Yakov Smirnoff once said that in Rus-
sia they also have one city that the Russian comedians make fun
of. He says it too is Cleveland.

And then what do words like consumer and rip-off make you
feel? The word farmer may not only remind you of what a farmer
does  for  a  living  but  also  bring  to  mind  words  like  honesty,  in-
tegrity,  earthy,  hardworking.  Think  of  all  the  feelings  the  word
farmer conjures up, not only from your experience but from what
you feel emotionally. The word Soviet sounds more sinister to me
than Russian. What thoughts come to mind with the word lawyer?
When  you  analyze  these  words  and  see  how  you  can  use
them  to  create  a  message  that  has  emotional  impact,  then  you
have mastered an important lesson in writing copy.

Here’s  some  copy  I  wrote  that  points  out  the  emotional

differences in copy. Which sounds better?

Example 1: The old woman in the motel.
Example 2: The little old lady in the cottage.

I was writing an ad on some rubbing oil I had discovered in
Hawaii and describing how I had discovered it. Example 1 was
in my ﬁrst draft but example 2 sounded much better.

I’m not suggesting that you materially change the facts of a
situation to suit an emotional feeling. In this case, the motel ofﬁce
was in a small cottage, and the word cottage gave the copy a better
emotional feel. What do you think? Do you “feel” the difference?
Sometimes  changing  a  single  word  will  increase  response
in  an  ad.  John  Caples,  the  legendary  direct  marketer,  changed
the word repair to the word ﬁx and saw a 20 percent increase in
response.

Don’t  feel  that  you  have  to  have  a  total  command  of  the
emotional impact of words to be a great copywriter. It takes test-
ing  and  common  sense  more  than  anything  else. And  knowing
the emotional feel of words is like your general knowledge—it
comes with time. It is enough for now that you realize the impor-
tance  of  the  emotional  values  in  every  word. As  time  goes  on,
you will feel this inﬂuence play a bigger and bigger role in your
successful copywriting.

Selling the Concept, Not the Product Chapter 12

Let’s discuss one of the most important and basic copywriting
principles I teach. In fact, if you can understand and learn this
single  point,  you  will  have  mastered  a  major  lesson  in  writing
good advertising copy.

Never sell a product or service. Always sell a concept.

Axiom 9

What do I mean by “concept”? There are many words that
mean the same thing. One day, for example, the hot buzzword in
advertising  might  be  positioning.  A product  is  positioned  or
placed in such a way as to appeal to the consumer.

Other terms commonly used are Big Idea, or USP (unique
selling proposition), maybe even gimmick. Whatever it’s called,
it means basically the same thing. You sell the sizzle and not the
steak—the concept and not the product.

The  only  exception  to  this  rule  is  when  the  product  is  so
unique or new that the product itself becomes the concept. Take
the digital watch for example. When the watches ﬁrst came out, I
could hardly keep them in stock. When I ﬁrst announced them,
my main thrust was to explain the various features, which were
all new, and then just take orders.

But as the digital watches became plentiful and everybody
understood what they did and how they worked, each ad had to
differentiate the features of the watch through a unique concept.
For  example,  the  world’s  thinnest  digital  watch  or  one  with  a
built-in alarm or one with the most expensive band, or the one
with the ﬁnest quality, or even one that required a laser beam in
its  manufacturing  process—all  were  different  concepts.  Con-
cepts  started  selling  watches;  the  product  was  no  longer  the
concept.

Another example is the Pocket CB. It had its concept right
there in the headline. There were walkie-talkies and there were

71

U N D E R S T A N D I N G   T H E   P R O C E S S

mobile CB units, but we had the ﬁrst Pocket CB. And it was the
name itself that expressed the concept.

Or take the example of the Pocket Yellow Pages I referred
to in the previous chapter. Doesn’t that name express everything
you really need to know about the product in a simple concept?
In  that  ad  I  didn’t  sell  the  product,  but  rather  the  concept  of
standing in a phone booth and pulling out an electronic directory
to the surprise and delight of those around you.

Another  example  was  a  smoke  detector  I  was  selling.  In-
stead  of  selling  it  as  a  smoke  detector,  the  headline  screamed,
“Nose”—a product that just sat on your ceiling and sniffed the
air. It sold quite well.

Combining Products into Concepts
Sometimes  the  concept  naturally  comes  from  the  product  and
other times the concept can be created. I remember once running
several products in my catalog without much copy and discover-
ing  two  that  sold  quite  well.  Rather  than  run  them  as  separate
products in full-page ads, I decided to run them together in one
full-page ad as a concept.

The two products were a miniature travel alarm and a chess
computer. But rather than develop a concept for each, I wrote the
headline  “Winners”  and  told  how  both  products  were  the  top-
selling  products  in  our  recent  catalog.  The  headline  put  both
products  under  a  single  concept  and  made  them  both  winners
while drawing attention to our catalog.

Sales  continued  briskly  with  the  chess  computer  in  1978
when  I  received  a  call  from  the  company  in  Hong  Kong  from
whom we were importing the product. “Joe,” said my friend Pe-
ter Auge,  the  man  in  Hong  Kong  supplying  me  with  the  com-
puter,  “I  think  I  can  get  Anatoli  Karpov,  the  Soviet  chess
champion, to endorse our chess computer. I’m friends with him
through  a  contact  in  Russia  and  it  might  make  the  chess  com-
puter sell better.”

Indeed it would, I thought, but let’s come up with a concept
using Karpov—not as a person who will endorse the product but
as somebody whom we can challenge to play our unit. And in-

72

S E L L I N G   T H E   C O N C E P T ,   N O T   T H E   P R O D U C T

deed, that’s what we did. Our ﬁrst major ad with Karpov’s name
appeared with the headline “Soviet Challenge.”

Subheadline: Can an American chess computer beat the Soviet
chess  champion? A confrontation  between American  space-age
technology and a Soviet psychological weapon.
Copy:  The  Soviet  Union  regards  chess  as  a  psychological
weapon, not just a game. It is a symbol of Communism’s cultural
struggle with the West.
So when Russian Anatoli Karpov competed against the Russian de-
fector Victor Korchnoi, he had the entire Soviet Union’s resources
at his disposal, including a hypnotist and neuropsychologist.
Karpov won. And with it the world’s undisputed chess champi-
onship. Karpov, however, has never confronted American space-
age technology and in particular JS&A’s new chess computer.

Of course the copy continued to talk about the challenge we
were making against Karpov. That was the concept. We weren’t
selling  chess  computers. We  were  selling  the  challenge  against
the Russian champion and as a consequence selling chess com-
puters. It was taking a very staid product and giving the entire
promotion a more emotional appeal.

Then  the  ad  went  on  to  explain  how  the  unit  worked,  its

features and ended with the challenge to Karpov.

The ad had some pretty effective copy. And I’ve reproduced
it in Appendix E at the end of the book. Read it. It’s a lot of fun.

Soviet Intrigue
I was sitting in my ofﬁce as the ad was breaking throughout the
United States when I received an urgent telegram from overseas.
Opening it up, I saw right away it was from Karpov. “I am going
to sue you for using me in your advertising without permission.”
Signed: Anatoli Karpov.

I  was  told  that  I  had  permission  to  use  his  name  by  my
friend Peter, who said, in fact, that he would be sending me the
endorsement contract and that I should go ahead and run the ad.
So I did, thinking all was okay.

What to do? Simple. I could just see my next headline: “So-
viet  Union  Sues  JS&A”  or  maybe  “Little  JS&A Attacked  by
Soviets.” What a great concept. But before I could sit down and

73

U N D E R S T A N D I N G   T H E   P R O C E S S

write it, my friend Peter called and advised me that he had gotten
a copy of the telegram, too, and that everything had been worked
out with Karpov’s agent and there was nothing to worry about.
Karpov would endorse the chess computer and I could continue
my ad campaign.

I then sat down and wrote the third ad in the series, entitled
“Karpov  Accepts,”  which  talked  about  the  challenge  made  to
Karpov  and  how  he  then  decided  that  for  whatever  reason,  he
didn’t want to play the chess computer as part of the challenge.
Instead he could just endorse it and hope that many Americans
would learn to improve their chess game on it.

Concept Selling Does Well
All three ads did very well and more than 20,000 chess comput-
ers  were  sold.  And  all  three  had  different  concepts  associated
with  them.  Meanwhile,  my  competition  was  out  there  in  force
trying to sell their chess computers but not succeeding because
they  were  selling  chess  computers  and  not  Soviet  Challenges
and Karpov Accepts—concept advertising.

If  your  advertising  just  sells  the  product,  be  careful.  You
need a concept. If you’ve come up with a unique concept, fantas-
tic. You’ll do much better.

Price Can Also Affect Concept
Sometimes simply changing the price of a product can dramati-
cally alter its concept. For example, when we were offering our
Pocket CB at $39.95 it came across as a serious electronic prod-
uct similar to a full-sized CB radio. When we dropped the price
to $29.95 it became more of a sophisticated walkie-talkie. And
ﬁnally  when  we  dropped  the  price  to  $19.95,  the  product  was
perceived as a toy—all this despite the fact that the copy in the
ad was pretty much the same.

Finding the concept is often not easy. It takes all the skills
of a conceptual thinker to come up with the right idea and the
right  position.  One  of  my  favorite  advertisements  that  really
captured  the  essence  of  this  chapter  was  an  ad  I  once  read
from the Leo Burnett ad agency. It was a full-page ad that ap-
peared in Advertising Age magazine and is reproduced on the
next page.

74

S E L L I N G   T H E   C O N C E P T ,   N O T   T H E   P R O D U C T

Tcudorp

The  ﬁrst  job  of  an  ad  agency  is  to  look  at  your
product  in  every  imaginable  way:  frontwards,  back-
wards,  sideways,  upside  down,  inside  out.  Because
somewhere, right there in the product itself, lies the
drama that will sell it to people who want it.

There may be 10,000 ways to bring that inher-
ent drama to the stage. And given a world in which
“me-too” products multiply like mayﬂies, the drama
may seem that much harder to ﬁnd.

It is.
But every good product has it.
And every good agency ﬁnds it.

(Please note: The “t” in tcudorp is silent.)

It’s so true. Every product has that unique selling proposi-
tion that makes it stand out from the rest. And it is indeed up to
you, the copywriter, to realize this fact and discover each prod-
uct’s uniqueness. If you do, the simple positioning of a product
and the developing of a concept can be so powerful that it can
make the difference between a huge success and a loser.

In  the  next  chapter,  you’ll  discover  how  to  come  up  with

that great idea as we study the incubation process.

75

The Incubation Process Chapter 13

It’s ﬁne to read about the real secrets of copywriting, but let’s
get serious. One of these days you’re going to have to implement
what  you’ve  learned  and  start  writing  copy. What  are  some  of
the  mental  steps  required  to  write  copy  in  general  and  how  do
you go about writing effective copy?

Let’s establish a few things that you have learned already in
this book and then take everything a step further. As you recall, I
referred  to  general  knowledge—the  knowledge  you
have picked up simply by living—and speciﬁc knowl-
edge—the  knowledge  you  acquired  while  studying
the speciﬁc product you want to write copy about.

Assume you are now an expert on a particular
product and you are ready to start writing. The ﬁrst
thing I would do is go over all the material you have
on  your  subject  and  give  a  great  deal  of  thought  to
what  you  have  just  read  and  studied.  Do  plenty  of
thinking about what you want to write. You may jot
down  some  headlines  and  some  of  the  copy  points
you  would  like  to  bring  out.  You  might  list  those
points  that  best  describe  the  nature  of  the  product
you are selling and you might like to list some of the
strong  reasons  that  your  product  would  appeal  to
your customers. Put all your thoughts down on paper. But keep
in mind, you have not yet started to write the copy. This is just
preparation.

Or  don’t  put  a  thing  on  paper  and  just  think  through
everything  you  know  about  the  challenge  you  have  to  solve
through copy.

You  might  even  visualize  the  end  result  of  your  work.
Maybe  it’s  imagining  that  a  stack  of  mail  has  arrived  showing
what a great response you received. Maybe it’s your boss com-
ing up to you and patting you on the back for a job well done.

Take a break
from your
work and
do something
pleasurable
while your
brain
incubates.

77

U N D E R S T A N D I N G   T H E   P R O C E S S

Once you’ve done all that, do something that may seem strange
to you at ﬁrst. Stop.

That’s right, stop. Do something else. Forget about the pro-
ject.  Do  something  pleasurable—a  stroll  in  the  park,  a  walk
down the street or lunch with a good friend. Whatever you do,
let it be a total diversion from what you are currently working
on, and please don’t even think of the copy project.

Whether you realize it or not, you are actually working on
the  ad  constantly  even  though  you’ve  put  it  out  of  your  mind.
Your  subconscious  mind  is  actually  processing  everything
you’ve  learned—all  of  that  data  that  you  have  accumulated  in
general and all of the information in particular. And your mind is
then taking all of that data and running it through everything you
know about copywriting and communications, mentally prepar-
ing the ﬁrst version of your ad copy.

It is taking this information and working through the millions
of permutations possible to come up with the best solution to your
marketing problem. And you’re doing absolutely nothing about it.
You’re just out having a good time while your brain is working like
crazy. And ironically, if you start thinking about your project again,
you interrupt this process and the results won’t be as good. This en-
tire subconscious activity is called the incubation process, and the
time you are giving to it is called the incubation period.

Your subconscious is processing millions of bits of data like
a computer in your brain running a very important program in the
background.  Then,  while  you’re  taking  a  walk  or  standing  in  a
shower  or  even  daydreaming,  suddenly  that  big  idea  will  ﬂash
across your mind. Eureka! Then go to your desk and start writing
down some of that good stuff your subconscious mind has created
and organized for you.

Your Mind Is Always Working
Sure,  you  might  think  you  can  eliminate  the  incubation  period.
You never do. Even when the pressure of deadlines prevents me
from  taking  the  luxury  of  time  to  incubate,  I’m  still  incubating
but at a much more rapid speed. The results may not be as good,
however. The time pressure only increases the incubation process
and speeds up the assimilation of data in your brain. If you have

78

T H E   I N C U B A T I O N   P R O C E S S

the luxury, your copywriting and what you produce will improve
if you balance the pressure of deadlines with time away from the
project. This could also mean working on one project, then going
to another and subsequently coming back to the ﬁrst one. This is
another way of allowing you the luxury of having your subcon-
scious mind work on a project while you do something else.

The incubation process actually works best with pressure of
some kind. If you have no pressure, your brain will not work as
fast or as efﬁciently. So it is a balance of various pressures that
produces the optimum results.

What  causes  pressure?  We  already  know  that  time  causes
pressure but there are other factors as well. Ego for example. If
you have a big ego, it creates a certain amount of pressure. This
pressure can be very positive in the incubation process. For ex-
ample,  your  boss  expects  you  to  produce  some  knockout  copy
and your ego won’t let you disappoint her. You’ve added to the
incubation pressure. Your creative orientation plays a role, too.
For example, if you are naturally creative, you have a big advan-
tage  over  someone  who  is  not.  And  ﬁnally,  the  environment
plays a role. If you are in a creative environment that encourages
those incubation activities required in the creative process, it will
help the incubation process along.

Just Allow It to Happen
Now don’t show this chapter to your boss and say, “See, Joe Sugar-
man tells me to take a pleasurable walk in the park on company
time and enjoy myself while my brain incubates.” That’s nonsense
and not the purpose of this chapter. In this chapter, I just want you
to  realize  that  there  is  a  constant  process  going  on  in  the  back-
ground of your brain. And with the proper balance, you can create
blockbuster copy by allowing the incubation process to function.

The  biggest  mistake  a  manager  can  make  in  a  mail  order
company is to have the creative department in the same building
as any other department in the company. Imagine the operations
people walking in to see the creative people incubating—staring
into space or taking a long break with one of their peers. “Those
privileged  bastards  in  creative  really  get  away  with  murder”
would be a typical comment. But the creative department needs
that atmosphere in order to function to its optimum.

79

U N D E R S T A N D I N G   T H E   P R O C E S S

If  management  imposed  the  same  rules  on  the  creative
department as on the rest of the staff who have to function on
a  conscious  level  during  their  jobs,  the  end  result  would  be  a
sure drop in good creative work. It’s important to keep the cre-
ative staff separate from the rest of a company because the copy-
writer needs a little more freedom to incubate and create.

When  it  comes  time  to  sit  down  and  knock  out  that  copy,
discipline comes into play. You’ve got to let that copy come pour-
ing out of your brain, forgetting about spelling and grammar. Re-
member, your mind takes the data you’ve accumulated and runs it
through  everything  you  know  about  copywriting,  communica-
tions and life in general. Well, hold back the stuff on spelling and
grammar just long enough to let the copy ﬂow out freely.

Left Brain versus Right Brain
If you’re knowledgeable about writing and creative thinking, you
know  that  there  has  been  much  said  about  the  different  hemi-
spheres of our brains controlling different types of thinking. The
right  brain  does  the  intuitive  or  emotional  thinking  and  the  left
brain  does  the  logical. Which  side  of  the  brain  should  write  the
copy? The right brain of course. Let the copy ﬂow out of that right
brain and let it pour out unencumbered by any left-brain restraints.
The pouring out of that copy or idea is the culmination of
the incubation process. It is the end result of all the mental activ-
ity that has been running in the background. And so, the axiom
that I suggest you remember is:

The incubation process is the power of your subconscious mind
to  use  all  your  knowledge  and  experiences  to  solve  a  speciﬁc
problem, and  its  efﬁciency  is  dictated  by  time, creative  orienta-
tion, environment and ego.

If you’ve gone through the incubation process and then put
your thoughts on paper, you’ve accomplished half the challenge
of  writing  good  copy.  (Next  comes  the  fun  part—the  editing
process. We’ll have to wait for that process in later chapters of
this  book.)  Now  that  you  are  mentally  prepared  to  tackle  the
copywriting  process,  it’s  time  to  decide  how  much  copy  you
should actually write.

Axiom 10

80

How Much Copy Should You Write? Chapter 14

I ncubate,  slippery  slide,  seeds  of  curiosity—all  may  be  neat
concepts, but often at my seminars the question would come up:
Do people read all the copy in your ads? Students of direct mar-
keting learn that there is no such thing as copy that is too long.
And there is some truth to this.

The key is simply this: Copy is never too long if the reader
takes the action you request. Therefore, it can’t be dull, it must
be compelling, it must relate to the reader and, ﬁnally, it’s got to
be about something the reader is interested in.

What we’re talking about here is the slippery slide concept.
The copy must be so compelling that it will be read from the be-
ginning  to  the  end.  Everything  else  is  secondary.  If  you  don’t
write  compelling  copy,  you’ll  never  get  the  reader  to  read  the
part of the copy that sells your product.

Will people read long copy? Let me answer the question in
a different way by having you go through a little experiment. On
the following lines I want you to ﬁll in the blanks for an article
as I direct you.

Headline: _______________ (Your Last Name) Family Chosen
as Heirs of Multimillion-Dollar Fortune
Subheadline: Family who lives on ____________ (Your Street)
in ___________ _ (Your City) was willed millions of dollars by
an anonymous person.

If  you  saw  that  headline  and  subheadline  in  your  local
newspaper,  would  you  read  the  ﬁrst  sentence?  Of  course  you
would. Let’s say the copy read as follows:

Wow,  what  a  score!  How  would  you  like  to  inherit  millions  of
dollars from somebody you don’t even know?

Well, that’s what happened to __________ (Your Full Name), who
has yet to be found but who might have fallen into one of the great-
est fortunes ever received from somebody who remains unknown.

81

U N D E R S T A N D I N G   T H E   P R O C E S S

Of course you would read the entire 3,000-word article. Af-
ter all, the article is talking about you. You are involved, you re-
late to what is being written in a very intense way and it’s both
informative and interesting, to you in particular.

And that’s my point about long copy. If the copy does all
the things I’ve just described, the reader will be intensely inter-
ested in it and will read it all—maybe not with the intensity of
somebody who just won millions of dollars, but with an intensity
that could come very close if your copy is effective.

Intense Interest
I’m writing this book on a Macintosh computer. A short time ago
while I was mastering my word processing program and had an
intense  interest  in  this  computer,  I  would  read  anything  on  the
Macintosh. And I would read an entire article or advertisement if
it was on the subject I was interested in. Later, after I mastered
what I had to learn, the information was not as interesting to me
and I did not seek it out with the same intensity.

This  is  also  true  about  products.
When digital watches ﬁrst appeared, my
customers were very intense about buy-
ing  them.  And  they  bought  them  in
droves.  They  read  every  word  of  my
copy.  It  was  informative  and  helpful,  it
involved them and they read the ads with
interest.  When  the  market  for  digital
watches  deteriorated  and  the  fad  was
over, my customers were not as intense about the product category
and went on to other things. Therefore readership dropped.

Copy will be read if it is interesting to the reader. I can re-
member  when  I  would  visit  the  car  showrooms  in  the  1950s
looking at new cars with their huge tail ﬁns and sleek new de-
signs. Ads would talk about rack and pinion steering and I of-
ten wondered what that meant. All that the copy would do is
go  into  the  feel  of  driving  the  car,  which  is  good  emotional
copy  but  didn’t  really  tell  me  enough. And  when  something
doesn’t tell you enough, it will cause you to go to the show-
room and ask questions, which is maybe what the car compa-
nies want you to do.

If the copy is
interesting,
the reader will
read it all.

82

H O W   M U C H   C O P Y   S H O U L D   Y O U   W R I T E ?

But often the salesmen didn’t know much, either. Rack and

pinion steering was foreign even to them.

I learned a lesson from those visits to car showrooms. You
can’t tell the prospect enough about a subject he or she is truly
interested in. And so it is with copywriting. People will read with
a  high  degree  of  intensity  if  you  are  talking  about  something
they are genuinely or passionately interested in.

Long Enough but Short Enough
Back in the days when copywriters were mostly men, there was
an old adage about copy length: “Copy is like a woman’s skirt. It
should be long enough to cover the essentials but short enough
to make it interesting.”

Let’s  use  the  same  example  of  the  salesperson  visiting  a
prospect that we used earlier in this book on page 35. But this time,
the salesperson appears for the appointment and the prospect ex-
plains that he can’t meet for 45 minutes because he is in the middle
of a budget session. Could the salesperson make the presentation in
15 minutes? What would you do?

A good  salesperson  would  make  a  new  appointment.  If  the
sales presentation takes an hour, then it should be an hour long—
not more and not 15 minutes. And so it is with copy. Depending on
how long your sales pitch is, the copy should cover the amount of
time you need to create the selling environment, develop interest in
the product, relate to the prospect’s needs and make the sale.

The copy has to be long enough to tell the entire story or make
the entire sales pitch—no longer and no shorter. Of course there are
certain practical limits, but even these can be broken. When Gary
Halbert, one of the great mail order copywriters, was looking for a
girlfriend, he ran a full-page 3,000-word personal ad in a local Los
Angeles newspaper. He was deluged with potential dates.

And when Richard DelGaudio wanted a personal assistant
to help him run his fund-raising company, he ran a 4,000-word
want  ad  that  pulled  in  more  qualiﬁed  respondents  than  he  was
able to interview.

The Long-Copy Approach
There really is no limit to how long copy should be if you get re-
sults. For example, if a good salesperson made his or her pitch in

83

U N D E R S T A N D I N G   T H E   P R O C E S S

10  minutes  and  sold  a  prospect  on  purchasing  a  $19.95  house-
hold  gadget  and  another  salesperson  selling  a  million-dollar
high-speed  printing  press  took  several  months  to  consummate
a  sale,  then  who  would  be  the  better  salesperson?  There  is,  of
course, no answer. Both could be great or both could be lousy.
Why then should there be such controversy over copy length? If,
as I hope you believe by now, selling in print is very similar to
selling in person, then shouldn’t the same rules apply?

So let’s take a moment and look at two factors that increase

the need for a lot of copy.

Price Point: The higher the price point, the more copy re-
quired  to  justify  the  price  or  create  the  need. This  is  a  general
rule unless the price point is perceived to be a tremendous value
(then less copy may be required) or the lower price point appears
to lack credibility (then more copy is required). More copy will
allow you to increase the value of a product and add many more
dollars to your retail price. In short, by educating the consumer
you can demand more money for your product.

Unusual  Item: The  more  unusual  the  product,  the  more
you need to relate that product to the user and the more you’ve
got to focus on creating the buying environment and explaining
the product’s new features. At retail, generally, this type of item
will not sell. Mail order is the perfect method to use when you
have the right amount of copy.

In  conclusion,  there  are  two  basic  reasons  for  using  the
long-copy approach. The ﬁrst is to allow you to create an envi-
ronment  that  will  place  your  prospect  in  the  proper  buying
mood, and the second is to give you the time necessary to tell the
full story of your product.

Short Copy Works, Too
Robert Scott of Scottcade Ltd., an English mail order company,
came to my seminar and told me that his approach broke all of
my rules. His catalog copy was very short, yet he still sold a lot
of merchandise.

But his catalog really appeared to follow my rules. First, he
created  his  environment  through  photography.  The  products
were placed in elegant settings using ﬁne photography. Second,

84

H O W   M U C H   C O P Y   S H O U L D   Y O U   W R I T E ?

his prices were very low compared to those of other companies or
retailers. Since he was offering his products at such low prices and
since his environment was so effective in placing the customer in
a buying mood, a lot of what normally would have been done in
copy was being done visually and through the price points of his
products.  Then  too,  his  medium  was  a  catalog,  and  in  catalogs
long copy is often not required. The catalog creates the environ-
ment, thus saving you the time of creating it with copy.

I am not trying to sell you on using long copy. I use short
copy  at  times  and  sometimes  very  short  copy  indeed.  But  the
short copy I use is usually all that is required and the price points
are low enough that the short copy does the job. In fact, I am not
for long or short. I’m for causing the prospect to exchange his or
her  hard-earned  money  for  your  product  or  service,  and  quite
frankly, copy length has always been just one of several consider-
ations in producing an advertisement.

So the axiom to remember from this chapter is simply:

Copy should be long enough to cause the reader to take the ac-
tion you request.

Axiom 11

Do  people  read  all  that  copy?  Some  do.  And  there  are
enough of them who do to have earned me and several other
copywriters a nice living.

The Art of Personal Communication Chapter 15

If you have read the chapters of this book in sequence, you are
building a good foundation to understand and learn copywriting.
This chapter builds upon the knowledge that took me sev-
eral years of copywriting to really understand and learn. Learn-
ing it wasn’t difﬁcult, but understanding why it was so important
took a little longer.

One of the things that ads should do is harmonize with the
reader or viewer. Advertising is the ultimate form of communi-
cation in that its purpose is to cause an action to be taken by con-
sumers—usually  to  exchange  their  hard-earned  money  for  a
product  or  service.  But  for  some  reason,  many  advertisers  are
missing  an  important  key  in  this  form  of  communication—
namely, it should be personal.

As a good example of personal communications, let’s ﬁrst

cover direct mail. In direct mail, personal communi-
cation is easy to understand. After all, you are writing
a letter to a single individual.

But in creating the letter that goes with a mailing,
too many copywriters write their letters as if they were
hiding  behind  a  podium,  speaking  through  a  micro-
phone and addressing a large audience. For example:
We at ABC Company wish to invite all of you to visit
our  exhibit  again  at  the  upcoming  trade  show.  Our
staff will be there to meet you and demonstrate our
new and novel button machine.
The personal way of saying it might be:

Hi. You might remember me from the last trade show. Well, I’d
like to invite you to the next one where I will be looking forward
to meeting you again to demonstrate our new and novel button
machine.
You  see  the  difference?  The  second  version  is  more  per-
sonal  and  direct.  It  is  me  talking  to  you—not  me  talking  to  a

Every advertise-
ment should be a
personal message
from the adver-
tiser to the
prospect.

87

U N D E R S T A N D I N G   T H E   P R O C E S S

large crowd. It is as if I, as an individual, were writing that letter
to another individual.

Now, in direct mail this makes sense. Why not make your
letters more personal and direct—more like one person talking
to another in a direct and eyeball-to-eyeball sort of folksy way?
Of course, folksy might not be the best way in certain circum-
stances. That’s okay. As long as you use words like I, you and
me, you create the feel of a personal form of communication.

Emotional Process in Communication
Remember  I  said  earlier  that  copywriting  is  an  emotional  out-
pouring of an idea onto paper. And I said that copywriting is very
much  an  emotional  process.  Look  at  the  following  two  letters
from the same company and see how much more emotional one
sounds than the other.

Dear  Customer:  We  here  at  Consolidated  International  would
like to thank you for your recent order. We realize that you could
have given your business to many of the other companies in our
industry, but the fact that you chose Consolidated International is
really appreciated by our entire staff. Thank you very much. Sin-
cerely, Mr. John Smith.
Now compare it to the following:

Dear Mr. Jones: I just wanted to thank you personally for your re-
cent order, which I’ve just received. I took your order and even
showed it to the president of our company. I realize that you had
a  number  of  other  choices,  but  I  really  appreciate  the  fact  that
you chose my company. Sincerely, John Lee.
Both letters would have served the same purpose. But the
second  letter  was  warmer,  more  personal  and  you  felt  that  Mr.
Lee was talking to you directly. Indeed, he was happy to get your
order—so happy that he went to his president and showed it to
him.  It  was  a  genuine  expression  of  thanks  and  a  direct  mes-
sage—all with genuine emotion.

On  the  other  hand,  the  letter  from  Mr.  Smith  could  have
been  a  form  letter  that  the  company  sends  to  all  its  customers,
thereby  losing  the  personal  feeling  that  Mr.  Lee’s  letter  had.  It
lacked the warmth and personal touch. The difference should be
obvious.  Read  both  letters  again,  and  this  time  feel  the  differ-
ence. Put yourself in the place of Mr. Jones and imagine how he
would have felt if he had received both letters.

88

Letters Should Be Personal
Good  examples  of  a  personal  letter  were  the  letters  I  used  to
send out to a membership program in my Consumers Hero club.
They  may  have  been  totally  off  the  wall,  but  they  served  my
purposes well.

The  membership  program  was  created  in  response  to  our
advertisement  for  our  discount  club  in  which  we  refurbished
new  but  defective  products  and  then  sold  them,  at  discount
prices, through a club we established.

Part of the club program was our regular monthly bulletin.
It  listed  all  the  buys  for  that  month,  and  along  with  it  came  a
very folksy letter talking about the club.

The image I conveyed was not that of a very large, imper-
sonal  corporation  ﬁlling  the  needs  of  its  membership  but  that
of  a  bunch  of  hardworking  people,  of  all  ethnic  backgrounds,
working together in harmony to make the company a success.

The company had to be portrayed as being small. That was
essential for the concept. After all, that was part of the image—a
little consumer-oriented company ﬁghting the big U.S. corpora-
tions and the effects of inﬂation.

And one of the techniques we used to keep the image of a
small  company  was  to  use  old  envelopes  from  companies  that
had  gone  out  of  business.  We  simply  explained  that  the  en-
velopes  were  no  longer  good  and  it  was  our  way  of  saving
money as well as the environment and passing the savings on to
the consumer.

So in one month, members might get an envelope from Ski
Lift International, a defunct company, and the next month they
might  get  a  letter  from  CMT Machine  Tool  Company,  another
defunct company, but the contents of the envelope were always
from Consumers Hero.

As  membership  cards,  we  sent  out  Batman  credit  cards.
(There  is  a  whole  story  on  that  card,  but  that’s  for  some  other
book I plan to write.) And one of the qualities we tried to convey
was  absolute  total  honesty.  We  were  so  honest  that  the  reader
would actually be embarrassed for us. The typical letter is on the
following page.

89

earth and personal

members.

90

Even though the letters were from the staff as opposed to an
individual, they still conveyed a personal feel to the reader. And
weren’t they fun to read? We often got comments that the letters
alone were worth the price of the membership.

In print ads, the need to be personal becomes less apparent.
After all, you are talking to the masses, aren’t you? But the fact
remains that you are indeed talking to a single individual—that

T H E   A R T   O F   P E R S O N A L   C O M M U N I C A T I O N

person reading your ad. And he or she is listening to a single in-
dividual—the person who wrote the ad. So it is essential that you
write  your  copy  as  if  you  are  writing  to  that  single  individual.
Your copy should be very personal. From me to you. Period.

Use of a Byline
An effective way to do this in print is to use a byline. Use your
name or the name of somebody in your organization such as the
president—like  the  news  organizations  do  in  a  magazine  or
newspaper  article. This  allows  you  to  use  words  like I and  me
and we and you. Let’s look at the example of the ad I ﬁrst ran for
BluBlocker sunglasses that launched a multimillion-dollar com-
pany.

Headline: Vision Breakthrough
Subheadline:  When  I  put  on  the  pair  of  glasses  what  I  saw  I
could not believe. Nor will you.
Byline: By Joseph Sugarman
Copy: I am about to tell you a true story. If you believe me, you
will  be  well  rewarded.  If  you  don’t  believe  me,  I  will  make  it
worth your while to change your mind. Let me explain.

Read that personal copy. It’s as if I were talking to that per-
son directly. I used the words I and you and me—all very per-
sonal  words  used  in  a  one-to-one  conversation.  Let’s  examine
the ﬁrst paragraph of copy from a few other ads that were written
in this personal tone.

This may surprise you. In fact, if my hunches are correct simply
reading this article may change your idea of aging for the rest of
your life. Here’s why.

Or how about the following:

If I were to buy a ticket in the Illinois State Lottery, my chances of
winning would be a million to one. But if I were to bet that you, as
a  reader  of  this  publication,  have  high  blood  pressure  and  don’t
even know it, my chances of being correct would be eight to one.

The above paragraphs show how very personal you can get
in copy and still convey a very powerful thought or develop the
environment and slippery slide you need to cause your reader to
continue reading and then respond.

91

U N D E R S T A N D I N G   T H E   P R O C E S S

When I started writing, I kept a low proﬁle and never used
my  name  in  any  advertising  communications.  But  as  I  became
more proﬁcient and saw the effect a personal message could cre-
ate in direct mail, I started using my byline in print on a regular
basis. In my catalog, I could speak in the ﬁrst person about all
the products because on the ﬁrst page of the catalog I introduced
myself in a letter to my customers.

Even Magazines Have Personalities
I  remember  reading  a  story  about  the  image  conveyed  by
the  magazine  itself.  Forbes  magazine  has  a  strong  personality.
Steve Forbes now runs the publication and his editorials appear
in every issue. A reader feels more personally involved with the
publication. In contrast, BusinessWeek appears more like a cor-
porate publication even though it has many bylines. A business-
woman  once  commented  that  she  could  put  her  arms  around
Forbes  and  hug  the  magazine  but  would  only  feel  comfortable
shaking BusinessWeek’s hand. So it is with copywriting.

You  want  to  create  a  very  personal  image  so  that  people
will emotionally respond to you, feel close and feel very com-
fortable parting with their hard-earned money and buying your
product or service.

Axiom 12

Every  communication  should  be  a  personal  one, from  the
writer to the recipient, regardless of the medium used.

So as you start to write copy to reach and motivate an indi-
vidual,  think  in  terms  of  writing  in  the  ﬁrst  person  with  a  per-
sonal message.

You are now ready to write that ﬁrst ad. Everything you’ve
read has prepared you for this moment, and everything that you
are going to learn later in this book will only polish what you al-
ready know. True, you’re also going to get a whole bunch of new
insights, too. But right now you’re ready for the big plunge. In
the next chapter, we discuss writing your ﬁrst ad using my tech-
niques and thought processes.

92

The Copy Sequence

Chapter 16

You are now really ready to write that ﬁrst successful ad. You
already know how important it is to know your subject. You al-
ready  know  the  purpose  of  all  the  elements  in  an  advertise-
ment—to  get  the  prospect  to  read  the  ﬁrst  sentence.  And  you
know  all  the  axioms  to  get  the  reader  to  read  beyond  the  ﬁrst
sentence and all the way to your last word.

Copy must also ﬂow. And its ﬂow must make sense. It must
be  in  an  understandable  order  where  each  thought  ﬂows  logi-
cally to the next.

Many people have told me that when a question comes into
their minds as they read my ads, I answer it in the next sentence.
They often claim that it’s almost uncanny. But that’s the skill that
makes the good direct response copywriter the envy of any one-
on-one salesperson.

Leading the Reader
Since  we  copywriters  do  not  have  the  beneﬁt  of  having  the
prospect in front of us to ask the questions, we must craft our ads
in such a manner that they literally lead our prospect (by the ﬂow
of the copy) to ask the question we want to answer. Sounds hard,
doesn’t it? It really isn’t.

Start by writing the headline. Will it grab the reader? Then
write the subheadline. Will it compel the reader to read further?
Then write the caption to go under an imaginary picture. Is all
this strong enough to get people to read the ﬁrst sentence? And
then write the ﬁrst sentence.

Once you start using my thought process, you’ll ﬁnd a dis-
cipline  and  a  direction  that  you  might  not  have  experienced  in
writing copy before.

You might even write a paragraph in the copy to stand out

in boldface type similar to the Consumers Hero ad that reads:

IMPOSSIBLE-TO-TRACE GUARANTEE
We  guarantee  that  our stolen  products  will  look  like  brand
new merchandise without any trace of previous brand identi-
ﬁcation or ownership.

At my seminar, I would call on various students and ask them
to read their headlines. The class would then critique each headline
to determine if it would get us all to read the subheadline. It was a
good  process  with  20  students  from  all  walks  of  life  coming  up
with some of the most creative approaches on a variety of subjects.
One  day,  my  eight-year-old  daughter April  was  sitting  in
one of the chairs in the class. She was taking notes, listening in-
tently  and,  in  short,  acting  exactly  like  one  of  the  students.  I
would always allow my children free access to the entire semi-
nar process and they had never been a nuisance. In fact, the stu-
dents liked this family touch.

April Becomes a Real Nuisance
After I had assigned an ad-writing exercise and asked for volun-
teers  to  read  their  ads,  April  started  waving  her  hand  wildly.  I
called on a man from New Zealand—Archie Mason—who was in
the  wool  business.  Later,  when  I  asked  for  another  volunteer,
April once again waved her hand wildly but I called on another
student—Fred Simon, president of Omaha Steaks. Finally, April
came up to me in front of the class and whispered, “Dad, let me
read my ad. It’s a good one. It follows your principles.”

I  was  annoyed.  “Later, April.  Can’t  you  see  I’m  trying  to

teach the class?”

Finally, at break time, April came up to me and handed me
her  ad.  I  read  it.  It  indeed  was  a  good  example  of  anticipating
what a consumer would ask and then answering it. It was very
simple—after  all,  an  eight-year-old  had  written  it—but  it  con-
tained  a  question-and-answer  format  that  was  very  logical  and
covered  a  topic  of  interest  that  her  eight-year-old  peers  would
enjoy reading. Her product was a guinea pig. The ad read:

Headline: The Best Pet
Subheadline: Do you want a pet that doesn’t shed?
Copy: Think about it. You can get a pet that doesn’t shed, doesn’t
run around the house, and is easy to take care of.

94

T H E   C O P Y   S E Q U E N C E

You  have  probably  guessed  it’s  a  rabbit,  bird,  ﬁsh  or  a  turtle.
Well, you’re wrong. It’s a guinea pig.
You probably want to know how do you take care of the guinea
pig? Where should I keep it? What does it eat?
It’s all simple. If you don’t have a guinea pig cage, then get a box
high enough so it won’t get out and large enough so it can run
around.
Feed it guinea pig pellets and feed it a couple fresh greens. Put
plastic at the bottom and newspaper on top then at least an inch
high of shavings. Put a bowl in for food and a water bottle for
water.
That’s all you need to know. To order, call [phone number] and
order today.

April’s ad made an important point, which I have reminded
each class of since. Good copy can be written at any age and by
anybody.  Simply  understanding  the  principles  and  applying
them to something you intuitively know is all it takes.

Logical Progression of Flowchart
In class I would ask my students to write a headline and a sub-
headline.  I  would  then  ask  for  the  ﬁrst  sentence,  then  the  next
sentence  and  then  the  next  until  each  student  had  composed  a
complete ad.

The ads had to ﬂow on paper and then, once they were on
paper, the editing process was of paramount importance. One of
the tips I gave during this process was to create a block diagram
of  a  logical  way  the  copy  should  ﬂow  and  the  questions  that
might logically be asked.

In order to develop a sense for this, you break your ad into
small  abbreviated  copy  blocks  similar  to  those  in  a  corporate
ﬂowchart. But this ﬂowchart goes in one direction only—down.
I made a block diagram of the ad I did for an electronic pin-
ball game from Bally manufacturing. I showed that at the start of
the ad, I wanted to get my reader into the copy and then I wanted
to set the environment for the product. So, I started the ad with the
fun times that this product represented. The ad started like this:

It’s you against a computer. And the action and excitement from
Fireball,  your  own  computerized  pinball  machine,  is  nothing
short of spectacular.

95

U N D E R S T A N D I N G   T H E   P R O C E S S

Fireball’s  computer  replaces  many  of  the  mechanical,  scoring,
conventional  electronics  and  sensing  devices  of  a  standard  pin-
ball  machine.  It’s  a  dramatic  change  in  pinball  devices  and  the
start of a new consumer electronics revolution.

With  the  ﬁrst  paragraph  I  create  interest  and  excitement
for this product. With the second paragraph I start to weave the
drama  of  the  product  and  the  differences  between  Fireball  and
conventional pinball games.

Then I go into the next block of copy and explain why and
how the game is different, how to play it and some of the unique
features made possible by the computerized electronics.

Logically,  a  reader  who  had  read  this  far  would  want  to
know  a  little  more  about  how  the  game  was  constructed,  the
quality of the product and the many new features. Therefore, the
next block of copy has this information.

Okay, you are really interested in purchasing this game. But
you  say  to  yourself,  “How  can  I  justify  it?  I’d  love  to  get  this
Fireball  game.  Emotionally  I’m  hooked,  but  how  can  I  justify
purchasing it?”

So  the  next  block  should  justify  the  purchase. I  used  cost
comparisons with what you pay for a TV set, pool table or your
stereo system. I plant the seed about its practicality when guests
pop  in  and  how  Fireball  will  be  the  hit  of  any  party  or  family
gathering. It’s here that I’m giving the prospects the logic they
need to make that emotional purchase. I even suggest that a busi-
ness might purchase one as a way to entertain employees at work
and  claim  it  as  an  investment  tax  credit  and  depreciation  ex-
pense—all tax-saving measures. I knew I had to provide all the
logic possible for this $650 purchase.

By now the customer is saying to himself, “Okay, I want to
get the unit and I can justify the purchase, but what if I use it, get
tired of it and it sits in the corner like that exercise device that’s
gathering dust?”

So I go into the fact that it has lasting play value. And I de-

scribe several reasons why people won’t get tired of it.

The customer is now thinking to himself, “Hmm. I like the
product, I can justify it and I can see that it will have lasting play

The ﬂowchart for

direction—

96

T H E   C O P Y   S E Q U E N C E

value, but what if I buy this big pinball game and suddenly the
computer poops out?” I then raise the service question in the ad
copy and answer it. The point of each of these blocks of copy is
that they are logically placed as if to anticipate the next question
a prospect is going to ask—all in an environment that you have
created and all ﬂowing logically to the last part of the ad when
you ask for the order.

Flowing in a Logical Sequence
When you work with copy long enough, the ﬂow is automatic. You
don’t need to do ﬂowcharts, as you can instinctively sense the next
question and answer it. And that is the special skill that a good di-
rect  response  copywriter  has  over  a  one-on-one  salesperson.  We
sense the questions, answer them—and we do it on a mass scale.

You still might ﬁnd it helpful to create a block diagram of
your  ad  after  you’ve  written  it  to  see  if  it  ﬂows  properly  and
raises the right question at the right time. How do you want to
sequence  your  questions  in  your  copy?  What  kind  of  environ-
ment do you want to weave through the early part of the text?
What are some of the questions you would surely be asked about
the product if you were a salesperson and you were selling the
product face-to-face?

It’s really all common sense. Looking at your copy as it ﬂows
out onto a computer screen or onto a piece of paper is the mechan-
ical part of this process but not the important part. It’s the common
sense  you  use  to  anticipate  the  sequence  of  what  will  be  asked
next and how your copy should ﬂow that really counts at this stage
of the copywriting process. This brings up my next axiom.

The ideas presented in your copy should ﬂow in a logical fash-
ion, anticipating  your  prospect’s  questions  and  answering
them as if the questions were asked face-to-face.

By now you understand the basic concepts of good direct-
marketing  copywriting.  You  understand  the  importance  of  be-
coming an expert on the product you are going to write about.
You know that the more you learn about a product or service, the
greater the chances you’ll come up with that unique copy angle
or product position or big idea.

Axiom 13

97

U N D E R S T A N D I N G   T H E   P R O C E S S

But there are some other tips I can give you that will help
generate that concept you want to develop. First, state the prob-
lem. It might be as simple as “I want to sell this pinball game.”
Then, once you have stated the problem, restate it in a different
way:  “I  would  like  to  introduce  my  prospect  to  the  unique  as-
pects  of  this  pinball  game.”  Then  restate  it  again:  “I  want  to
make the pinball machine easy to buy and seem like fun.”

It’s that last restatement that makes the pinball game seem
to  come  alive  and  is  closer  to  the  copy  approach  I’ve  actually
used. During problem restatements (and you could list dozens of
them),  all  the  knowledge  that  you’ve  gained  about  the  product
seems to come together to give a new perspective.

Prepare That Big Idea
Once you’ve restated your problem and you have the statement
that you like best, sit down and list your big ideas or concepts.
List  several  concepts.  Then  pick  the  one  or  two  that  make  the
most sense.

Visualize  your  concept  and  see  how  it  might  be  incorpo-
rated  into  the  ad.  Think  again  about  your  problem  restatement
and whether your concept seems to be consistent with it. Then
stop. It’s time to incubate.

After you’ve slept on it for a while, start writing. First write
your headline—an attention-getting blockbuster of a headline short
enough to grab the reader’s attention. Then write the subheadline—
so compelling and curiosity-building that your prospect must read
the  ﬁrst  sentence.  And  ﬁnally,  write  the  ﬁrst  sentence  of  the
copy—short, to the point and strong enough to carry you into the
next sentence—and then it’s down the slippery slide.

Block-diagram  your  ad.  What  do  the  ﬁrst  few  paragraphs
do for the ad? What is the emotional appeal? Are you anticipat-
ing  those  questions  and  answering  them  to  the  satisfaction  of
your prospect? Are you frank and honest in those answers?

Try Patterning Your Ad
Another approach is called “patterning.” Simply pick an ad writ-
ten  by  somebody  you  admire  and  whose  product  or  service  is
similar to yours and use their ad as a pattern or style from which
to write. If they use a long headline, make your headline long. If

98

T H E   C O P Y   S E Q U E N C E

they use a lot of captions, then you create a number of captions.
Capture the feel of the ad, but be careful. Do not copy the per-
son’s layout too closely so that people reading the ad might think
at ﬁrst glance it was from the company you were copying. This
exercise  is  only  to  give  you  a  format  or  guide  from  which  to
write.  If  you  copy  the  layout  too  closely,  you  are  violating  the
rights of the person who wrote the ad.

The main points in this chapter are the basic steps and the
thought processes you go through as you construct your ad. The
key  point  is  that  you  don’t  have  the  prospect  in  front  of  you,
so you have to anticipate the questions the prospect will ask in
almost the same order the prospect will ask them.

This ﬂow is important. But there is also a critical part of the
copywriting  process  that  really  separates  the  best  copywriters
from the rest. It’s called the editing process and we cover it in the
next chapter.

99

The Editing Process Chapter 17

This chapter holds one of the most valuable secrets to effective
and persuasive copy, for it is in the editing process that you turn
that raw emotional outpouring of thoughts and ideas into a pol-
ished,  harmonious,  resonant  tuning  fork  that  will  vibrate  per-
fectly with your prospect.

It’s like the story of a diamond. When a diamond is found it
looks like a piece of coal or carbon. Take that black, ugly stone and
polish it and it soon becomes the world’s most beautiful gemstone.
Remember  that  lecture  I  referred  to  earlier  in  Chapter  11
that I gave at New York University? I mentioned to the students
that  if  everybody  in  the  class  completed  a  writing  assignment,
my  ﬁrst  draft  would  probably  be  the  worst  in  the  class.  Poor
grammar,  atrocious  spelling  and  disjointed  sentence  structure
might be the way an English teacher would describe it.

But it is what I do after that ﬁrst draft that makes the differ-
ence. It’s the difference between just plain copy and a polished
advertising message—from copy that doesn’t move prospects to
copy that moves prospects so strongly that they reach into their
collective  pockets  and  exchange  their  hard-earned  money  for
your  product  or  service.  It’s  the  difference  between  earning  a
salary as a copywriter and earning millions of dollars as an effec-
tive copywriter/entrepreneur.

The Secret to Editing
Is there a secret to editing? Once again, it is a mental process that
almost parallels that of the copywriting act itself. It requires lots
of practice, although you will ﬁnd it easier to do than writing the
copy itself. In fact, it is a lot more fun. Look at the act of writing
the ﬁrst draft as giving birth. It may be a painful, long process or
it can go quite quickly with little pain. Then compare the editing
process to raising the child—the caring and nurturing required to
ensure a healthy, happy child.

101

U N D E R S T A N D I N G   T H E   P R O C E S S

You  wouldn’t  want  your  child  to  go  out  into  the  world  in
funny  clothes,  unable  to  communicate  or  relate  with  others,
would you? You therefore have to mold and nurture that child as
you prepare to present him or her to the rest of the world.

Editing is a nurturing process. And just as there is no perfect
way to nurture your child, there are many different approaches to
editing copy that are certainly acceptable. I strive for one result
when I edit, and this can be summed up in the following axiom:

Axiom 14

In the editing process, you reﬁne your copy to express exactly
what you want to express with the fewest words.

Now this sounds rather simple, doesn’t it? But it is the true
essence  of  the  editing  process. You  want  to  maintain  the  same
emotional feel, the same thought process, the same vibration that
you had in mind when you wrote the copy. It’s just that you want
to do it in the fewest words.

This may mean that you rearrange the words you wrote to
make the thought more direct. Or it may mean cutting out words
that have little contribution to the overall feel of the ad. It may
mean substituting new words that express your thoughts better.
And it may even mean adding words to clarify a thought. But the
goal  in  writing  ad  copy  is  to  express  the  thoughts  you  want  to
convey in the most powerful way but with the fewest words.

I  remember  the  feeling  I  had  writing  my  book  Success
Forces in 1980. Since it was a book format and I was not under
the same constraints as when I wrote my advertising copy, it was
an easy process. In fact, it is a lot easier writing anything other
than direct response advertising copy. You have the freedom to
use as many words as you wish to express a thought or feeling.
And you have no space restrictions.

Copy Has Space Restrictions
But  with  advertising  copy  you  do  have  space  restrictions. Your
copy has a very focused purpose—to motivate your prospects to
exchange  their  hard-earned  money  for  your  product  or  service.
And everything you do or write must lead to this one goal.

Let me give you one example from an ad that I wrote. We’ll
look  at  my  ﬁrst  draft  of  the  initial  two  paragraphs,  which  con-

102

T H E   E D I T I N G   P R O C E S S

tained  66  words,  and  then  the  ﬁnal  draft,  which  contained  43
words. We’ll then study the two versions and certain lessons will
emerge. The ad was for a bathroom scale, and here’s the ﬁrst draft:

Losing weight is not easy. Ask anyone.
And, if you’ve tried it, you know that part of a good weight re-
duction program is your bathroom scale. A bathroom scale is like
a report card. It’s a feedback mechanism that tells you how well
you’ve done. In fact, one of the few pleasures of losing weight is
stepping on your bathroom scale and seeing the positive results.

Now  let’s  take  the  same  ad  and  condense  it  to  reduce  the
word count while still maintaining the same meaning and emo-
tional feel.

Losing weight is not easy. Ask anyone.
One  of  the  few  pleasures  of  losing  weight  is  stepping  on  your
bathroom scale and seeing positive results. Your bathroom scale
is like a report card—a feedback mechanism that tells you how
well you’ve done.

In the second paragraph there is a reduction from 59 words
to  36.  With  nearly  40  percent  fewer  words,  the  meaning  and
emotional appeal of the second version is exactly the same as the
ﬁrst or even better.

Apply  this  percentage  to  a  full-page  ad  with  1,000  words
and you can see the difference the editing process can make. In
fact, at this point, let’s look at the advantages.

Advantages of Fewer Words
With less copy, your ad will look less imposing to the prospect
and he or she will be more likely to read it. The second advantage
is that you are making the slippery slide even more slippery by
making it shorter. Your prospect will get to the bottom of the slide
much faster, yet still get the full impact of your sales message.

The preceding example was given to my seminar class and
they spent about 20 minutes coming up with their own edited ver-
sions of the ad. Many of them were excellent and some were even
shorter  than  my  version.  Of  course,  the  copy  was  taken  out  of
context; they didn’t have the rest of the ad and couldn’t see far
enough into the ad to see what my environment, goal and emo-
tional appeal for the product were, so this might not be the perfect

103

U N D E R S T A N D I N G   T H E   P R O C E S S

example. But it brought out many of the principles of good edit-
ing. The following are ﬁve of the principles they learned:

Some Principles of Editing
1. Look for any “that” words. For example, in my ﬁrst draft I
used the words, “And, if you’ve tried it, you know that. . . .”
The words up to and including “that” can very often be elimi-
nated. In this example, I could eliminate eight words.

2. Edit for rhythm. Make sure that you vary the length of sen-
tences so they don’t sound monotonous. I discuss rhythm later
in this book, in Chapter 18.

3. Consider combining sentences. Note that in the edited ver-
sion,  I  combined  the  two  sentences  that  read,  “A bathroom
scale is like a report card. It’s a feedback mechanism that tells
you how well you’ve done.” I condensed it into “Your bath-
room scale is like a report card—a feedback mechanism that
tells  you  how  well  you’ve  done.”  I  saved  only  one  word  by
doing  this,  but  it  made  sense  to  combine  the  sentences  and
eliminating even one word is a good move.

4. Eliminate unnecessary words. Look at the word “the” in the
phrase “and seeing the positive results.” The word “the” can
easily be eliminated without changing the meaning so that the
ﬁnal sentence will read, “and seeing positive results.”

5. Rearrange thoughts so they ﬂow better. Note that in the ﬁrst
draft, the ﬂow of the copy pointed out that the scale was a re-
port card and the second thought was that part of the pleasure
of a weight loss program was stepping on a scale and seeing
the  positive  results.  By  reversing  these  two  thoughts,  I  made
the ad more emotional by focusing on the pleasure of using a
scale  when  losing  weight  and  then  I  explained  why.  This
sounds  a  lot  better  and  more  logical  from  a  ﬂow  standpoint
than the ﬁrst draft.

Take as Long as You Need
Sometimes  editing  is  like  raising  and  nurturing  your  child  and
you need to take a lot of time. You may end up doing 10 drafts
before you get to the ﬁnal draft. Other times it may ﬂow right out
of your mind with hardly a correction.

When Frank Schultz, the grapefruit marketer, attended my

104

T H E   E D I T I N G   P R O C E S S

seminar  and  wrote  his  famous  grapefruit  ad,  it  was  so  close  to
perfect that it didn’t need much editing at all. When Joe Karbo,
who wrote The Lazy Man’s Way to Riches, attended my seminar,
he  told  the  class  that  after  his  ad  was  written,  other  than  two
words  that  needed  correction,  the  ad  was  perfect.  In  contrast,
other seminar participants who had a great deal of copywriting
experience spent many hours editing their ads.

And the same holds true for me. I’ve written ad copy that
ﬂowed right out of my brain through my pen, or later my com-
puter,  and  never  had  to  be  edited  much.  Most  of  the  time,
though, I would have to go through several drafts before I was
satisﬁed. And then there is the experience factor. The more you
write, the less editing you have to do. The easier the ﬂow out of
your brain, the better you are at expressing the emotional feel of
copy and the excitement that each word represents.

The novice copywriter will usually need the editing process
to  craft  and  polish  an  ad,  whereas  the  experienced  copywriter
has many of the editing mechanisms programmed in his or her
brain.  The  copy  seems  to  ﬂow  out  through  a  ﬁlter  that  comes
only from experience.

However,  the  need  for  editing  is  sometimes  unpredictable
regardless  of  your  experience.  You  could  produce  copy  that
needs plenty of editing or you could end up with excellent copy
that never needs much at all.

Read the Periodicals
I’m always amazed at the lack of editing I see in many of the pe-
riodicals I read. Phrases like “Finally, it is important to note that
. . .” can be totally eliminated and not affect the ﬂow or under-
standing of what follows. Another example: “Fortunately or un-
fortunately as the case may be . . .” is not really required to make
the information that follows clearer. Many of the articles written
in periodicals contain these unnecessary preliminaries that ﬁll up
space but mean very little. In writing effective copy you can’t af-
ford to be too wordy.

If  you’d  like  a  little  practice,  take  a  look  at  the  examples
that  follow  and  edit  them  yourself,  or  read  any  periodical  and
edit  the  copy  by  seeing  how  many  extraneous  words  can  be
eliminated. Or write a draft and practice this critical skill.

You want to
remove the
unnecessary
words and still
have the ad
make sense.

Example 1:
About the only redeeming feature of this product is that we don’t
have huge quantities to sell. The importer is afraid to order too
many  for  fear  that  nobody  in  their  right  mind  would  buy  it  let
alone sell it. So we only have a few hundred to sell as part of this
test program.

Example 2:
I was sitting in an ofﬁce in New York City talking to a very suc-
cessful  friend  and  businessman  whom  we’ll  call  Stuart.  I  told
Stuart that I had to make a very critical decision in my business. I
needed some guidance and advice.

When I started writing a great deal of copy in the 1970s, I
would  use  a  legal  pad  and  ballpoint  pen  and  write  my  draft  in
longhand. I would then give it to my secretary, who would type
it out for me in rough draft form, usually double-spaced.

I would then make my editing corrections and hand it back to
my secretary for her to retype. And this process would continue
for several drafts until it was in a ﬁnal form for the typesetter.

Computers Are a Great Help
When computers with word processing programs ﬁrst came on
the scene, I resisted using them. I was used to writing the copy in
longhand and to switch to a computer and keyboard seemed dif-
ﬁcult. But I made the transition sometime in the early 1980s on
an Apple II computer and I haven’t looked back since.

Writing copy on a computer makes the editing process very
easy. Word  processing  allows  you  to  pick  words  or  entire  sen-
tences and drag them to another place in the copy. Sophisticated
spell-checkers whiz through copy and correct your spelling even
as  you  type.  Thesauruses,  grammar-checkers  and  all  sorts  of
editing aids are built into every decent word processing program.
Today, I never have to give a draft to a secretary. I type it in draft
form ﬁrst on the computer and then do all my editing, often be-
fore I even print my copy. The computer has done more for my
copywriting  and  editing  than  any  other  single  factor,  and  it  is
making a difference for copywriters everywhere.

Another technique that will help you in the editing process
is time. If you can put aside your copy after you edit it and look
at it the next day or even in a few days, you will often discover

106

T H E   E D I T I N G   P R O C E S S

things that you never saw before. If time is critical, put the copy
down for a short while and then get back to it. The key is to al-
low time for your subconscious mind to digest what you’ve done
and pick out the areas that need work.

Many other rules for editing can be found in English text-
books  and  style  books.  There  are  also  other  books  on  writing
that cover this subject very nicely. In fact, it was a book I read
in college that really opened my mind to the importance of edit-
ing in the copywriting process.

Finally,  after  you  think  you  have  that  perfect  ﬁnal  draft—a
draft so well edited that you can’t possibly make one more correc-
tion—ask somebody who is a professional editor or an English ma-
jor to correct the English and grammar that you missed. This does
not mean that you have to accept all of the changes. Sure, you want
to correct the spelling and the dangling modiﬁers and any other in-
stances  of  terrible  grammar  that  may  negatively  impress  your
prospects. But then simply weigh each one of the changes and if
you feel that any interfere with the style of your writing and your
original version does not violate grammar or spelling rules, then ig-
nore them. The point is, don’t be intimidated if you don’t feel com-
fortable with somebody else’s suggestions to change your writing.

The Use of Commas
A good example is the use of commas. There are two schools of
thought—one that uses a lot of commas and the other that does
not. I do not believe in too many commas as they take up space.
And as a copywriter you don’t have much space to work with.
So I use commas where the rules of grammar are clear that they
are needed for clariﬁcation. I don’t use commas in places where
I am not violating any grammatical rules or where they are con-
sidered optional. For example, when three items are grouped to-
gether,  such  as  “apples,  oranges  and  tomatoes,”  I  don’t  use  a
serial comma after “oranges.”

I  would  have  both  my  sister  Judy,  who  is  a  high  school
teacher, and Mary Stanke, my associate at JS&A, proof all my
copy. I didn’t accept all their changes but I certainly paid a lot of
attention to them.

It is important that you do make your copy as free from er-
ror as possible. If you don’t, it reﬂects badly on the integrity of

107

U N D E R S T A N D I N G   T H E   P R O C E S S

your  offer.  It  raises  doubts  in  the  minds  of  your  readers. They
may think, “If this guy can’t get his grammar straight, how do I
know he runs his business right?”

A good example of how a prospect thinks is reﬂected in a
letter I received from an irate reader of one of the airline maga-
zines in which we ran the ad for our Consumers Hero club. We
received the following:

Dear  Sir:  Despite  the  intended  conversational  tone  of  the  at-
tached  advertisement,  no  license  within  consumer-oriented  ad
writing permits the type of glaring poor grammar usage circled in
paragraph  ﬁve  of  your  copy.  “We  better  not”  may  occur  in
sloppy, colloquial speech, but it is not acceptable in writing. The
phrase should read, “we’d better not,” of course.
I  cannot  believe  that  your  ad  agency  would  permit  such  poor
prooﬁng in an ad which ﬁnds its way into the hands of a sharp con-
sumer such as the type which pays the kind of money required to
purchase an airline ticket today, and thus is inﬂicted with this bad
grammar in a captive audience magazine like the attached.

The above individual took the time to write us about a simple
grammar error. How many others saw it and didn’t respond? And
whenever we do make a mistake, our readers do usually ﬁnd it.

One editing error was actually quite funny. In copy describ-
ing a blood pressure unit, I wrote, “blood pressure can be very
dangerous” instead of “high blood pressure can be very danger-
ous.” Nobody picked it up. Sometimes I’m amazed at what the
public  misses  and  what  they  complain  about,  but  the  fact  re-
mains that in the editing process you really do want to be as thor-
ough as possible.

What I have conveyed in this chapter is simply how impor-
tant the editing process is, the value of editing in terms of the ﬁ-
nal copy, and some of the logic I use in the editing process.

Now you’re ready for some interesting, subtle and sophisti-
cated insights into copywriting. By now you understand the en-
tire copywriting process, can write an ad and edit it. In Section
Two,  I  give  you  some  of  the  signiﬁcant  insights  I’ve  gained
during years of experience.

Understanding What Works Preview

Now comes the fun part. In the following chapters you’ll ﬁnd
not  only  insights  and  tips  on  how  to  write  copy  but  also
revelations  of  what  has  worked  exceptionally  well  during  my
30-year career as a copywriter.

This  section  contains  only  ﬁve  chapters.  But  packed  into
these chapters is the heart of this book—the basis for the copy I
write and many of my copywriting secrets. It’s an education that
cost  me  millions  to  learn  and  you’re  going  to  learn  it  for  the
simple price of this book.

In  my  seminar  promotional  outline,  I  listed  several  topics
that would be presented, one of which was “The 64 Points Every
Ad Should Cover.” And very often, my seminar participants, in
anticipation  of  coming  to  the  seminar,  would  sit  down  and  in
advance list some points to see if they could guess what I taught
in the course.

Typically, they knew maybe six or seven of the points. And
typically,  they  were  amazed  at  what  they  didn’t  know. You’ve
already learned the ﬁrst 10 of these points, the graphic elements
of an ad, in Chapter 4. You’re now about to discover the rest—
23 copy elements and 31 psychological triggers to buying. And
from the other chapters in this section you will further build the
base you need in order to write incredibly effective copy.

So study this section completely and continue to build your

solid copywriting foundation.

Powerful Copy Elements Explained Chapter 18

Remember our discussion about graphic elements in Chapter 4?
We  explained  that  each  of  these  elements  was  designed  to  get
prospects to do only one thing—read the ﬁrst sentence. And we
explained how important the ﬁrst sentence was in your copy.

And  if  we  know  that  all  those  graphic  elements  are  de-
signed to get you to read the ﬁrst sentence and eventually all of
the copy, then the next thing we should address is the nature of
the copy elements in an advertisement.

In this chapter, I will cover all the copy elements and their
relationship to the advertisement—23 concepts that you should
review for each ad you write.

1.  Typeface: This  element  is  really  important.  If  you’re  a
graphic designer, you know that each typeface has its own person-
ality, emotion and legibility. And that’s the point of this subject.
You’ve got to determine the combination of personality and legi-
bility that will make your ad easy to read and inviting. Since we
are talking about copy here, we are talking about only one style of
type,  called  “serif”  type.  Serif  type  has  short  protruding  lines
whereas the other style of type, called “sans serif,” doesn’t. The
type used for the text of this book is serif type. Why? Because in
legibility  tests,  serif  type  produced  greater  comprehension  than
sans serif type and by a 5 to 1 margin. I didn’t discover this until
well into my writing career, but now all my ads are printed in serif
type. This was one test I wish I had known about earlier.

Another important factor is the legibility of all your type-
faces in other parts of your ad such as the headline, subheadline
and various headings. Fancy type might look elegant to the type
designer, but if it can’t be read it has no value. It’s like talking to
a  foreigner  and  ﬁnding  the  words  difﬁcult  to  understand.  The
most important role a typeface has is to allow the greatest com-
prehension possible, and the second role, less important by far, is
to convey the image of a company.

113

U N D E R S T A N D I N G   W H A T   W O R K S

2.  First  Sentence:  This  we  discussed  in  Chapter  4  as  the
purpose of all the graphic elements of an ad—to get the prospect
to read that all-important ﬁrst sentence. Keep your ﬁrst sentence
short, easy to read and compelling enough to cause the reader to
read the next sentence.

3. Second Sentence: This sentence is almost as important
as the ﬁrst. You’ve got to maintain interest, so you must also cre-
ate  another  sentence  with  a  compelling  reason  to  cause  your
reader  to  want  to  continue. You  must  continue  this  momentum
throughout the ﬁrst and second paragraphs. Put aside any facts,
beneﬁts or product features. Your only goal is to get the momen-
tum going and create that buying environment.

4. Paragraph Headings: In Chapter 4, paragraph headings
are mentioned as one of the graphic elements in a print ad. They
are supposed to make the copy look less intimidating, and thus
encourage the reader to read all the copy. But paragraph head-
ings are also a copy element that needs to be addressed in this
chapter as well.

Paragraph  headings  could  introduce  material  in  the  para-
graph that follows or they could have absolutely nothing to do
with  the  copy  underneath  or  the  copy  in  the  entire  ad  for  that
matter. Remember, they are designed to break up the copy and
make it look less intimidating. They have little to do with selling
or  presenting  your  product.  They  simply  make  the  copy  look
more inviting so your reader will start the reading process.

When a reader looks at copy that appears like one continu-
ous  paragraph,  subconsciously  it  looks  a  lot  more  difﬁcult  to
read than copy that is broken up into neat little chunks headed by
various paragraph headings.

Use paragraph headings to break up copy in the middle of
columns but not at the very end or beginning. Avoid placing para-
graph headings right next to each other in two adjoining columns.
As  I  just  mentioned,  your  paragraph  headings  could  say
anything. I once ran an ad for a radar speed indicator, and as a
test  I  used  the  most  outrageous  paragraph  headings  you  could
think of. They included “Scrambled Eggs,” “Working and Play-
ing” and “Success and Good Things.” Even though the headings

114

P O W E R F U L   C O P Y   E L E M E N T S   E X P L A I N E D

had  absolutely  nothing  to  do  with  the  ad  copy,  they  drew  ab-
solutely no attention. Nobody ever asked me what the headings
meant or commented that they were not consistent with the copy.
But had I misspelled a word in the body of the ad, I would have
heard plenty about it.

The  primary  purpose  of  paragraph  headings  is  to  get  the
reader to read the copy by making the copy look less intimidating.
A secondary purpose might be to arouse curiosity. Maybe my
“Scrambled  Eggs”  paragraph  heading  did  just  that—created  cu-
riosity and caused somebody to start reading the copy to ﬁnd out
what scrambled eggs had to do with the product I was offering. Al-
though I’ve never tested to see if this was the case, my experience
with paragraph headings tells me that curiosity does play a minor
role but the main purpose of these headings is to make the copy
less intimidating.

5.  Product  Explanation: Sounds  simple.  Sounds  basic.
But you’ll be amazed at how many ads leave out the simple step
of explaining what the product does. A rule of thumb here is to
explain a complicated product in a very simple way and explain
a simple product in a very complex way.

For  example,  I  once  sold  a  smoke  detector. At  the  time  it
was  a  very  common  household  product  whose  function  was
clearly  understood  by  the  consumer.  In  short,  the  product  was
simple. In the ad I wrote for an expensive brand, I told a story
about the inside workings of my smoke detector. I described the
gold contacts (which every other smoke detector had) and even
explained how the comparator circuit functioned to determine if
there was smoke in the room. Even though this smoke detector
cost $10 more than the average market price, it was a big suc-
cess. The  ad  illustrates  a  way  to  present  a  simple  product  in  a
complicated way. You should sell a simple product that is clearly
understood  by  the  consumer  in  a  more  complicated  way  and  a
more complicated product in a very simple way.

When  I  ﬁrst  explained  the  computer  to  my  customers,  it
was  always  a  very  simple  explanation  of  what  it  could  do  for
them.  My  ad  was  not  about  the  technology  inside  (although
some reference was made to the inside) but focused on the sim-
plicity of the product and its use. At this time, consumers were

115

U N D E R S T A N D I N G   W H A T   W O R K S

just getting into computers. They were new, seemed complicated
to use and indeed many were. By explaining computers in very
simple  and  basic  terms  without  getting  too  complicated,  I  was
able to ease them into a purchase.

Later,  as  consumers  understood  more  and  the  products  be-
came a commodity, explaining them in greater detail proved more
effective.

In  addition  to  the  concept  of  simple  versus  complex,  you
should always check your copy to make sure you have explained
all of the features. Ask yourself, “Did I explain the product sufﬁ-
ciently to my prospect?” You might ask a number of people to
read your copy to see if they understand the product and its fea-
tures.  Look  at  the  questions  they  raise  and  see  if  you’ve  ad-
dressed them fully in your copy.

6. New Features: Highlight those features that make your
product or service new, unique or novel. This might appear to be
the same as the copy element “Product Explanation” that we’ve
just discussed, but it is different. Here you are revealing not just
the  features  of  the  product,  but  the  features  that  distinguish  it
from anything else on the market.

7.  Technical  Explanation: Regardless  of  the  product  or
service, each ad can be enhanced with a technical explanation.
We all like to buy something from an expert—somebody we
like, respect and trust. Buying is indeed a process of trust.
The buyer’s thought process might be, “I trust that you re-
ally know your subject and fully understand the product
category and have described your product to me prop-
erly and will give me something of value that I want
in return for my hard-earned money.”

Trust  is  always  enhanced  when  the  seller  has  become  an
expert  at  what  he  or  she  is  selling.  Let’s  say  the  seller  says,  “I
have  studied  everything  I  could  on  competitive  products  and
know  everything  there  is  about  the  product  I  am  selling,  so  I
know that what I am offering you is the best product at the best
value.” You would naturally have a great deal of conﬁdence that
this seller’s product is indeed good.

You might also be impressed if the seller, in describing the

A technical
explanation will
build conﬁdence
in the prospect.

116

P O W E R F U L   C O P Y   E L E M E N T S   E X P L A I N E D

product, used words that you didn’t understand. Why? Because
it  would  appear  that  the  seller  really  was  an  expert  about  the
product. This is not deception. A seller must become an expert
on the product in order to talk about it in technical language.

In  a  mail  order  ad,  technical  explanations  can  add  a  great
deal of credibility, but before you write them, make sure you in-
deed  become  an  expert.  If  not,  the  consumer  will  see  right
through the ploy.

A good example of this technique is expressed in the follow-
ing caption I wrote for a picture of the integrated circuit in a watch:

A pin points to the new decoder/driver integrated circuit which
takes the input from the oscillator countdown integrated circuit
and  computes  the  time  while  driving  the  display.  This  single
space-age  device  replaces  thousands  of  solid-state  circuits  and
provides the utmost reliability—all unique to Sensor.

Very few people would be able to understand the technical
commentary. In fact, when I sent the ad to the manufacturer for
approval, he called my attention to the caption under the picture
and said, “What you wrote there is correct but who is going to
understand it? Why did you even use it?”

Providing  a  technical  explanation  that  the  reader  may  not
understand shows that we really did our research and if we say
it’s good, it must be good. It builds conﬁdence in the buyer that
he  or  she  is  indeed  dealing  with  an  expert.  Incidentally,  the
watch was one of our best-selling products.

Another example of a technical explanation appeared in the
outline of a seminar. Jimmy Calano of CareerTrack came up to
me after I explained the reasons for a technical explanation and
said, “Joe, do you realize that the outline of one of my seminars
is, in fact, a technical explanation? By using technical terms that
not too many people understand until they come to the seminar,
they sense that we know what we are talking about.”

Yet another example is an ad written by Frank Schultz after
attending my seminar. His product was grapefruit and he was ex-
plaining how he graded them:

Even after picking there are other careful inspections each fruit
must pass before I’ll accept it. I size the fruit. And I grade it for
beauty. Sometimes the fruit will be wind scarred. I won’t accept

117

U N D E R S T A N D I N G   W H A T   W O R K S

it.  Or  sometimes  it  will  have  a  bulge  on  the  stem  that  we  call
“sheep nose.” I won’t accept it. You can see I really mean it when
I say I accept only perfect Royal Ruby Reds.

In many of my ads, catalogs, direct mailings and infomercials
I convey thorough knowledge not only of what I am selling but of
the  entire  universe  of  products  available.  I  convey  the  thought
process I went through in picking the product I chose and why it is
better than anything similar at a particular price point. And the con-
sumer appreciates the effort I took, feels more conﬁdent in the pur-
chase and consequently is motivated to reach into his or her pocket
and exchange hard-earned money for my product or service.

8. Anticipate Objections: This is a very important element
to  consider  when  writing  copy.  If  you  feel  that  your  prospect
might raise some objection when you are describing a product,
then raise the objection yourself. Remember, you’re not in front
of the consumer and you have to sense what the next question
might be. If you sense that there might be an objection and you
ignore  it,  it’s  like  ignoring  that  consumer. You  won’t  get  away
with it. The consumer is too sharp and will not buy.

A good example of anticipating objections is in that ad we
saw  earlier  in  Chapter  16  for  that  expensive  electronic  pinball
game from Bally Manufacturing. The average consumer would
raise the question about service. We resolved it in our ad.

Another example of raising an objection is in my ad offer-
ing a thermostat for the home. If you remember from Chapter 8,
I looked at the product and saw that it was really ugly. It didn’t
have a good design at all. In fact, it would turn me off if I were a
consumer. So I raised the objection at the very beginning of the
ad, calling it the worst-looking product I’d ever seen. I later jus-
tiﬁed the product by calling attention to its spectacular features,
but only after I had raised the design objection myself.

Often products that require installation concern consumers.
It  is  then  that  you  have  to  raise  the  question  about  installation
yourself and not hide from the facts.

9. Resolve Objections: Just as you have to recognize ob-
jections, it is your opportunity and duty to resolve the objections,
too. You must be honest and provide alternative solutions or dis-

118

P O W E R F U L   C O P Y   E L E M E N T S   E X P L A I N E D

pel the objections completely. With the pinball game, we talked
about the modular circuit boards that you simply snap out and ex-
change if service is required. More on this later in copy element
14, “Service.” In 2006 Gillette introduced its new ﬁve-bladed vi-
brating Fusion razor, which uses a small AAA battery located in
the handle of the razor. A consumer might be wondering, “How
long will the battery last?” But Gillette’s excellent approach was
to both raise the question and answer it with the statement, “For
best performance, change the battery every six months.”

10.  Gender: Who  is  the  consumer?  Male,  female  or  both
genders?  Are  they  female  golf  players,  lady  pilots  or  profes-
sional  women?  Make  sure  there  are  no  sexual  or  sexist  com-
ments  that  would  offend  any  group,  and  know  your  target
audience so that you can communicate in their terms.

I once ran an ad for gold chains in my catalog. It was in the
form of a story about a salesman named Bob Ross who tried to
convince me to sell gold chains. I resisted until he showed me a
picture  of  his  cousin  who  could  model  the  chains  in  the  ad.  I
quickly  accepted  the  product  after  seeing  a  picture  of  Bob’s
cousin. The  ad  copy  was  considered  by  many  to  be  one  of  my
most  creative  approaches  to  selling  a  product.  The  chains  had
nothing to do with the core products we had been selling—elec-
tronic  gadgets.  However,  I  did  get  a  few  letters  as  a  result.  A
woman in Egg Harbor City, New Jersey, wrote:

Dear  Sir: Your  friend,  Mr.  Bob  Ross,  may  regard  himself  as  a
successful salesman, but unfortunately he comes across in your
ad as a consummate asshole.

The letter then went on to point out the achievements of women
in  many  technical  ﬁelds,  the  military,  air  trafﬁc  control,  sports
and  leisure,  racing  and  several  other  professions  in  which
women now play a very active role. She ﬁnally concluded:

Perhaps a long, hard look at the person or department responsible
for the ad on page 37 is in order. Apparently he has to “come a
long way, baby” to catch up to the Twentieth Century. Cordially
wishing you immediate bankruptcy, I remain,

And  with  that  she  signed  her  name.  It  was  a  two-page
single-spaced  letter  that  included  a  copy  of  our  mailing  label.

119

U N D E R S T A N D I N G   W H A T   W O R K S

Was  I  really  insensitive  to  women?  Did  I  demean  them  in  my
ad  copy?  I’ve  reproduced  the  ad  in  Chapter  33  and  it  is  called
“Gold Space Chains.” See if you agree.

It  is  also  important  that  you  recognize  the  differences  be-
tween  men  and  women  in  terms  of  what  is  important  to  them.
Women are generally into color, fashion, family, home and rela-
tionships. Men are more likely into sports, military combat, ma-
chines,  earning  money  and  supporting  their  family.  Sure,  their
roles overlap tremendously today. Women are assuming the roles
that  men  once  had  exclusively  and  men  are  doing  things  today
that  years  earlier  would  have  been  considered  feminine.  Being
aware of the differences (and sometimes the lack of differences)
is the most important point here. And this awareness can help you
harmonize  with  your  target  audience  by  understanding  how  to
communicate with them and knowing what might offend them.

11. Clarity: Your copy should be clear, simple, short and to
the  point. Avoid  big  words  that  confuse  those  who  don’t  know
them and which often establish the writer as a pompous snob—
unless, of course, you’re trying to appeal to pompous snobs. Keep
it simple. The clearer the copy and the more concise, the easier it
will be for people to read and get on the slippery slide and stay
there. The only exception to this rule is when you give a technical
explanation, as described earlier in copy element 7 in this chapter.

12.  Clichés: Avoid  the  obvious  ones:  “Here’s  the  product
the world has been waiting for,” or “It’s too good to be true.” If
you feel inclined to use a cliché, don’t. Clichés seem to be used
when you have nothing really signiﬁcant or good to say and must
ﬁll up space. How do you know if you are writing a cliché? If it
sounds like you’re writing typical advertising copy some agency
may have written 20 years ago, that’s one clue.

Have I used them? You bet. My ﬁrst several ads were replete

with them. Back when I wrote them, I didn’t know any better.

For example, in my 1972 ad for a desktop calculator, I stated,
“It’s the breakthrough the world has been waiting for!” Bad, isn’t
it? I wrote it then but would never write anything as trite today.
The lead sentence for the ﬁrst pocket calculator I introduced in the
United  States  in  1971  read,  “It’s  the  most  exciting  new  break-

120

P O W E R F U L   C O P Y   E L E M E N T S   E X P L A I N E D

through in electronics since the transistor radio!” Ironically, at the
time it may have actually been more truth than cliché.

13. Rhythm: Just as a song has a rhythm, so does copy. Hu-
mor writers know this well. If you can write good humor, you’ve
already got the rhythm thing down pat. In fact, the most difﬁcult
copy to write is humor. Why humor? Because you have to know
how to build up to a punch line and then deliver it. You have to
know how not to be too obvious in your delivery and you’ve got
to understand the art of timing. So what does this rhythm sound
or feel like in advertising copy?

It has no distinct pattern: a short sentence, then a long sen-
tence followed by a medium sentence followed by a short sen-
tence and then another short sentence and then one really long
sentence.  Got  it?  In  short,  a  mixture  of  sentence  lengths  that,
when read together, gives a sense of variety and rhythm.

Think  about  how  copy  would  sound  if  all  the  sentences
were very short or very long or all had a distinct predictable pat-
tern.  Pretty  boring. And  that’s  the  point  of  copy  rhythm.  Vary
your sentences; vary their length to give your copy a rhythm.

Another  rhythm  technique  is  the  use  of  what  is  called  a
“triad.” Very often when I list examples or attributes of something,
I use just three of them. For example, take the sentence, “I went
shopping  for  a  hammer,  a  screwdriver  and  a  pair  of  pliers.”  In
copy you list three items in a series with the last item preceded by
the word and, and you create a nice rhythm within that sentence.
In fact, when you read some of the ads in Section Three of this
book, you will see how many of them have triads throughout.

14. Service: If you are selling an expensive product or one
that is not easily returned for service, you must address the ques-
tion  of  service  and  convey  the  ease  of  that  service  to  the  con-
sumer.  Often  the  mention  of  a  brand  name  manufacturer  is  all
that is needed to establish ease of service. But if there is a remote
possibility that the consumer would still ask about service, then
you must address this issue in your ad.

In  selling  our  Bally  pinball  game  by  mail,  we  knew  that  a
buyer might have concerns about the matter of service. What if the
pinball game broke and required repair? It was large and expensive

121

U N D E R S T A N D I N G   W H A T   W O R K S

and the inconvenience of a broken game would be in the back of
our customers’ minds. We addressed that in the ad. The following
is the subheading and paragraph we used to alleviate any customer
concerns:

A FRANK DISCUSSION OF SERVICE
Fireball is a solid-state computer with its electronics condensed on
integrated circuits—all hermetically sealed and all pre-tested for a
lifetime  of  service.  Fireball  is  also  self-diagnostic.  Let  us  say
something goes wrong with the system. Simply press the test but-
ton on the back panel of your machine and the exact problem is
displayed  on  your  scoreboard  in  digits.  Check  the  instruction
booklet  and  simply  remove  the  designated  plug-in  circuit  board,
light bulb or part and send it to the service department closest to
you for a brand new replacement. Even your TV or stereo isn’t that
easy to repair.

A full  paragraph  was  used  to  cover  the  issue  of  service.
And we sold thousands of pinball machines to people who ordi-
narily might not have purchased a unit because of their concern
about service.

Another good example of how important service is to help
sell a product took place during the height of the digital watch
boom  in  the  mid-1970s.  The  industry  was  expanding  very
rapidly  but  there  were  problems  with  the  reliability  of  these
space-age  timepieces.  Unlike  mechanical  watches,  these  new
electronic timepieces had batteries, used sophisticated chips and
circuitry and had a high defective rate.

I recognized this as a problem that had to be addressed in
our copy. And since I look at problems as opportunities, I won-
dered,  “Where  is  the  opportunity  in  this  serious  and  rapidly
growing problem?” I then came up with the following copy to es-
tablish the quality of the product we were offering and our com-
mitment to back it.

The Sensor 770 has an unprecedented ﬁve-year parts and labor
unconditional  warranty.  Each  watch  goes  through  weeks  of  ag-
ing, testing and quality control before assembly and ﬁnal inspec-
tion. Service should never be required, but if it should anytime
during the ﬁve-year warranty period, we will pick up your Sensor
at your door and send you a loaner watch while yours is being re-
paired—all at our expense.

122

P O W E R F U L   C O P Y   E L E M E N T S   E X P L A I N E D

Then  later  in  a  summary  of  the  offer,  we  again  played  up

the part on service.

We  have  selected  the  Sensor  as  the  most  advanced  American-
made, solid-state timepiece ever produced. And we put our com-
pany  and  its  full  resources  behind  that  selection.  JS&A will
unconditionally  guarantee  the  Sensor—even  the  battery—for
ﬁve years. We’ll even send you a loaner watch to use while your
watch is being repaired should it ever require repair.

We alleviated any concern about service in the copy of the
ad.  If  the  issue  of  service  was  raised  in  the  minds  of  our
prospects, it was now resolved. By showing such a strong com-
mitment to service, we had overcome a major objection that we
realized,  in  advance,  could  be  a  problem,  and  turned  it  into  an
opportunity.

Indeed  when  a  customer’s  watch  did  not  work,  the  cus-
tomer would call us on our toll-free number and we would im-
mediately  send  out  a  package  containing  a  UPS  call  tag  that
allowed  UPS  to  pick  up  the  defective  watch  free  of  charge,  a
loaner watch and a postage-free envelope for the consumer to re-
turn the loaner after receiving the repaired watch.

This gave our company the opportunity to prove to our cus-
tomers  how  consumer-oriented  we  were.  Our  customers  were
literally amazed at the way we followed up with our service pro-
gram. And after they received their repaired watch, they even got
a call from us to make sure everything was okay.

But that’s not the point of this example. If service is a con-
sideration in the subconscious mind of the consumer and you ad-
dress  it  up  front,  you  will  melt  any  resistance  to  buying  your
product. The Sensor watch was one of our best-selling watches
and  the  mailing  list  of  watch  customers  became  one  of  our
strongest mailing lists for future offers.

Service in the selling process has been a critical factor in the
success of a personal friend, Joe Girard, who is in The Guinness
Book of World Records for having sold more cars in a single year
than anybody in history. Joe’s books on salesmanship are worth
reading for their many insights, but the one factor that made Joe
such an effective salesman (aside from the fact that he was a very
personable guy) was the way he handled service. His customers’

123

U N D E R S T A N D I N G   W H A T   W O R K S

service problems became his. And each time he sold a car, Joe be-
came  that  buyer’s  personal  service  representative. And  Joe  per-
formed. Then when buyers returned for another car, they wanted
to buy only from Joe. It wasn’t price that made Joe’s success, al-
though that was important; it was his attitude toward service.

15. Physical Facts: In copy you must mention all the phys-
ical  facts  about  a  product  or  you  risk  reducing  your  response.
I’m talking about weight, dimensions, size, limits, speed, and the
like. Sometimes you might think that a certain dimension isn’t re-
ally  important  or  the  weight  may  not  be  necessary.  But  it’s  not
true. Give readers any excuse not to buy and they won’t buy.

I  remember  running  ads  for  products  and  then  personally
taking the orders on our toll-free lines. I did this because it was
on the phone lines that I got many of my insights into the buying
process.  Here  were  my  customers,  motivated  enough  to  reach
into  their  pockets  and  pull  out  their  hard-earned  money  for  a
product they trusted me to sell them. What a wonderful oppor-
tunity to peek into this process and hear the really subliminal re-
actions people made when they responded.

It was during my time on the phone lines that I learned that
if you don’t give all the facts, it gives your customer the excuse
not to order. It may be a weight or dimension that you thought
was irrelevant, but if you don’t mention it, people will call and
ask for it. And how many more customers didn’t bother to call
and check on it? Of course, they didn’t order, either.

I remember an ad for a scale pictured on the ﬂoor. I didn’t
give the actual weight of the scale itself. “Who would care?” I
thought.  But  my  prospects  did  care  and  frequently  asked.  We
eventually included the weight of the scale in the ad. I remember
showing an object that was being held in my hand. I gave the ex-
act dimensions but failed to give the weight because the weight
was not really relevant. I got a lot of calls from people wanting
to know the weight before deciding whether to buy.

The point: List the physical dimensions even in cases where

you think they are not that important.

16. Trial Period: With mail order items, you must offer a
trial  period  for  any  product  that  the  consumer  cannot  touch  or

124

P O W E R F U L   C O P Y   E L E M E N T S   E X P L A I N E D

feel at the time of purchase. The only time you can make an ex-
ception to this rule is when the value is so strong and the product
so familiar that the consumer is willing to take the risk. If I were
selling a box of 24 rolls of toilet paper at a bargain price deliv-
ered to your home and it was a brand that you already used, then
you wouldn’t need a trial period.

Make sure your trial period is at least one month, or even
better, two months. Tests have proven that the longer the trial pe-
riod, the less chance the product will be returned and the more
conﬁdence the consumer will have in dealing with you and pur-
chasing the item.

Let’s say you receive a product that has a one-week trial pe-
riod. You’ve got one week to make up your mind. You feel the
pressure, so you examine the product and try to make the deci-
sion as quickly as possible. If you are unsure when the week is
almost up, what do you do? You say, “I’m not sure, so I’m not
going to take the chance,” and you return it.

But let’s say you have two months to make up your mind.
No  pressure  there,  right? You  even  have  a  pretty  good  feeling
about the company offering the product. The company must be
conﬁdent that you’re going to like the product because it is giv-
ing you a two-month trial period.

So you put the product aside. You use it freely, not worried
about having to make a decision, and then before you know it the
two months are up and you’ve not even thought about returning
it. Just knowing you could have returned it was enough to make
you feel comfortable holding on to the purchase.

17.  Price  Comparison: Whenever  possible,  offering  a
price  comparison  to  another  product  establishes  value  in  the
mind of the purchaser. This points out one of the really important
considerations  that  motivate  consumers  to  buy—namely  that
they are getting real value.

An example of a price comparison was my ad for the Sen-

sor watch. I stated:

The $275 Pulsar uses the LED technology which requires press-
ing  a  button  each  time  you  want  to  review  the  time.  Even  the
$500  solar-powered  Synchronar  watch,  in  our  opinion,  can’t

125

U N D E R S T A N D I N G   W H A T   W O R K S

compare with the Sensor and its 5-year warranty. And no solid-
state  watch  can  compare  to  Sensor’s  quality,  accuracy,  rugged-
ness and exceptional value.

If you are selling an expensive item or something that is a
good  value  when  compared  to  another  product,  you  should  al-
ways consider a price comparison as a means of establishing the
value  of  your  product.  If  your  product  is  the  most  expensive
product being offered, then you want to suggest that it has more
or  better  features.  If  your  product  is  less  expensive,  then  you
want to focus on better value and use a price comparison.

But there’s a word of caution. Your comparison must be to-
tally accurate and be 100 percent fair or you could be sued by the
company whose product you are comparing.

18. Testimonials: A testimonial is a good way to add credi-
bility if it is from a very credible person or organization. This ap-
proach can be used not only in the copy but in the headline or
photo. See if your ad copy could use a celebrity for a testimonial,
but make sure the testimonial makes sense for the product.

When I was selling a space-age Midex security system, it
made  sense  to  ask  Wally  Schirra,  the  famous  astronaut,  to
endorse my product. He did, and the product sold very well. If
I  were  selling  basketball  shoes,  Michael  Jordan  would  be  a
natural.

Make sure that the celebrity matches with the product and
adds credibility. The use of a celebrity who doesn’t make sense
for your product or doesn’t add credibility could backﬁre, have
the wrong effect and kill sales if the offer is not believable.

You can also use what I call a “reverse testimonial.” That is
where you don’t use a spokesperson but you refer to your com-
petitor’s.  For  example,  when  I  was  selling  the  Olympus  micro
recorder, I stated the following:

Headline: Endorsement Battle
Subheadline: A famous golf star endorses the Lanier. Our unit is
endorsed by our president. You’ll save $100 as a result.
Copy:  Judge  for  yourself.  That  new  Olympus  micro  recorder
shown  above  sells  for  $150.  Its  closest  competition  is  a  $250
recorder called the Lanier endorsed by a famous golf star.

126

P O W E R F U L   C O P Y   E L E M E N T S   E X P L A I N E D

FANCY ENDORSEMENT
The famous golf star is a pilot who personally ﬂies his own Citation
jet. The Olympus recorder is endorsed by JS&A’s president who pi-
lots  a  more  cost-efﬁcient  single  engine  Beechcraft  Bonanza.  The
golf star does not endorse the Lanier unit for free. After all, a good
portion of his income is derived from endorsing products.
Our president, on the other hand, does not get paid for endorsing
products—just  for  selling  them. And  his  Bonanza  is  not  as  ex-
pensive  to  ﬂy  as  the  golf  star’s  Citation.  In  fact,  our  president
also drives a Volkswagen Rabbit.

I then continued to show how inefﬁciently the Lanier was
sold  (through  a  direct  selling  organization)  and  how  efﬁciently
the Olympus was sold (via direct marketing and through JS&A).
The conclusion: savings of $100 for an even better product—all
because  we  didn’t  have  our  product  endorsed  by  an  expensive
spokesperson.

Another form of testimonial is from the man on the street—
used  primarily  on  TV.  I’ve  used  them  extensively  in  my
BluBlocker  infomercials.  And  ﬁnally,  another  one  could  come
from  those  people  who  use  your  product  and  send  you  an  unso-
licited testimonial. Whatever testimonial you do use, make sure it
is authentic and honest. The public will see right through a lie and
the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) won’t be far behind.

19.  Price: Another  important  copy  point  to  consider  is  the
price. Should the price be obvious? Should it be set in large type?
Small? These are important considerations and must be examined.
If you’re selling a product or service at a very good price,
then set the price in larger type. After all, you want people to see
that beneﬁt very clearly. If the product is expensive and it’s not
the price that will sell it, you want to underplay it. Don’t hide it;
just underplay it.

As  I  write  my  ad  I  have  always  anticipated  the  questions
my  prospects  will  ask.  There  is  one  exception.  I  never  know
when they are going to wonder about the price of the product. I
have always felt that the point at which your reader will want to
ﬁnd out about the price could happen anytime during the reading
process. It could happen before they read the ad. It could happen
halfway through or it could happen near the end. You must, as an

127

U N D E R S T A N D I N G   W H A T   W O R K S

effective copywriter, answer the question when it is being raised
by the reader.

By  putting  the  price  in  a  logical  position  in  the  copy—
whether it be in the coupon, which is the ideal place, or in the
copy  highlighted  with  a  bold  typeface—you  are  answering  the
question that the reader asks without knowing when the reader is
ready to ask the question. The reader simply scans the ad and if
the price is in bold or in the coupon, the price will pop out and
answer the question.

20. Offer Summary: It’s a really good idea to summarize
what you are offering the consumer somewhere near the end of
your ad. “So here’s my offer. Order two pots with Teﬂon coating
and  you’ll  receive  the  two  pots  plus  our  handy  cookbook  and
video for the price of only $19.95.” You’ll be surprised at how
many ads miss this important point.

21. Avoid Saying Too Much: This is probably the biggest
mistake my students make. They say too much. There are really
two issues here. The ﬁrst issue is one of editing. It is normal to
say as much as you can about a subject and then reﬁne the copy
to  a  point  where  it  ﬂows  smoothly. This  usually  means  editing
and  reducing  the  copy  length  until  it  has  rhythm  and  it  ﬂows.
This could take time and involves a few steps.

First, say to yourself as you go through the editing process,
“Is there a simpler way of saying this?” Very often you can cut
your  copy  down  50  to  even  80  percent  and  still  say  the  same
thing.  It’s  the  difference  between  a  salesperson  who  talks  too
much  and  one  who  is  to  the  point  and  succinct.  Wouldn’t  you
rather be sold by the one who is to the point?

There is another issue involved with not saying too much,
and  later  in  this  book  in  the  “Mental  Enagement”  section  of
Chapter 19 I explain how not saying too much will actually en-
hance and even stimulate the selling process. Chapter 17 on edit-
ing also has ideas that will help you reduce your copy.

22. Ease of Ordering: Make it easy to order. Use a toll-free
number,  a  coupon,  a  tear-off  reply  card  or  any  vehicle  that  is
easy to understand and use. My recommendation: Use a coupon

128

P O W E R F U L   C O P Y   E L E M E N T S   E X P L A I N E D

with dotted lines. In tests, it usually generates more response be-
cause the dotted lines clearly convey at a glance that you can or-
der the product from the ad.

23.  Ask  for the  Order:  Always  ask  for  the  order  near
the end of your ad. This is often forgotten by many copywrit-
ers. At  the  end  of  an  ad,  I  state  the  following  or  something
similar: “I urge you to buy this at no obligation, today.” Have
you ever met a salesperson who has already sold you and you
are waiting for the salesperson to ask you for the order but he
or  she  never  does?  It’s  happened  to  me. And  it  is  one  of  the
problems with a lot of inexperienced salespeople. You’ve got
to ask for the order, and if you’re doing it right, it should be at
the  very  end  of  the  ad  where  you’ve  ﬁnished  selling  your
prospect,  you’ve  summarized  the  offer  and  your  prospect  is
ready to buy.

These  23  copy  elements  are  points  you  want  to  consider
when you are writing copy. Use this chapter as a checklist when
you get started. Consider all of these points when you write an
ad. Can some of them be eliminated? Possibly. But simply by us-
ing them as a checklist, you might discover a few deﬁciencies in
your  ad  copy  that  can  be  corrected  with  my  suggestions  and
might result in enhancing your response.

One of the other beneﬁts of the list is to give you an in-
sight into the relative importance of the various copy elements.
Some,  like  the  paragraph  headings,  have  little  purpose  other
than to make the copy less imposing. Others, like resolving ob-
jections,  can  make  a  dramatic  difference  in  the  credibility  of
your copy.

Use  the  convenient  copy  elements  checklist  located
in  Appendix  C  in  the  back  of  this  book  and  make  a  copy
to keep right next to your computer or desk when you are writ-
ing an ad.

But the really interesting part of my checklist is in the next
chapter where you’ll learn about the psychological triggers that
need to be considered when you write an ad. You ﬁrst learned
about the 10 graphic elements and their purpose (to get you to
read the ﬁrst sentence of the copy) in Chapter 4. You have just

129

U N D E R S T A N D I N G   W H A T   W O R K S

learned  23  copy  concepts  and  how  they  are  to  be  used.  Now
learn  the  31  psychological  triggers—the  underlying  motiva-
tional messages that good direct response copy should convey,
often in subtle but very effective ways. When I was teaching my
seminar course, this was the part my students enjoyed the most.
So read on.

The Psychological Triggers

Chapter 19

The 31 psychological triggers are probably going to be the most
interesting of the 64 points you want to consider when writing a
direct response print ad or any kind of selling message.

The  ﬁrst  part  of  the  64-point  checklist  involves  the  10
graphic elements of an ad—those elements designed to get you
to read the ﬁrst sentence. The previous chapter covered 23 points
to consider when writing the actual copy. But now get ready for
the psychology that should be considered when writing your ad-
vertising message—concepts that took me years of failure, expe-
rience and gradual insight to understand and implement.

You  may  understand  and  relate  to  some  of  these  concepts
right away. Some you may not fully understand without experi-
encing them yourself. And ﬁnally, some will require a fairly de-
tailed explanation.

If you’ve found this book informative so far, you will ﬁnd

this chapter fascinating. So let’s start.

1. Feeling of Involvement or Ownership

I was once told this story by a master salesman who worked at a
TV and appliance store. He was the most successful salesman this
store ever had. He consistently beat out all the other salesmen. He
had  some  very  good  sales  techniques,  but  that  wasn’t  what  im-
pressed me. It was the way he decided in advance who his best
prospects might be.

What  he  would  do  was  stand  in  an  aisle  watching  cus-
tomers  walk  into  the  store.  He  would  observe  them.  If  they
walked up to a TV set and started turning the knobs, he knew
that he had a 50 percent chance of selling them. If they didn’t
turn  the  knobs,  he  had  a  10  percent  chance  of  selling  them.
This was before remote controls.

131

U N D E R S T A N D I N G   W H A T   W O R K S

Direct response advertising doesn’t give you the opportuni-
ties  of  observing  your  prospects. You  are  not  there  to  see  any
knobs being turned. But you can get them to turn the knobs by
giving them a feeling of involvement with or ownership of the
product you are selling.

In all my ads I try to make the prospects imagine they are
holding or using my product. For example, in one of my earlier
calculator  ads,  I  might  have  said,  “Hold  the  Litronix  2000  in
your hand. See how easily the keys snap to the touch. See how
small and how light the unit is.” I create through imagination the
reader’s experience of turning the knobs.

In short, I take the mind on a mental journey to capture the
involvement of the reader. I make the reader believe that he or
she could indeed be holding the calculator and experiencing the
very same things that I’ve described. It’s mental energy creating
a picture for the prospect, whose mind is like a vacuum waiting
to be ﬁlled.

In  your  copywriting,  let  your  readers  take  a  stroll  down  a
path with you or let them smell the fragrance through your nose
or let them experience some of the emotions you are feeling by
forming a mental picture from your description.

If  I  were  writing  an  advertisement  for  the  Corvette  sports
car, I might say, “Take a ride in the new Corvette. Feel the breeze
blowing  through  your  hair  as  you  drive  through  the  warm
evening. Watch heads turn. Punch the accelerator to the ﬂoor and
feel the burst of power that pins you into the back of your con-
tour seat. Look at the beautiful display of electronic technology
right  on  your  dashboard.  Feel  the  power  and  excitement  of
America’s super sports car.”

I would still explain all the special features of the car—the
logic upon which to justify its purchase—but I would really play
up that feeling of involvement and ownership.

This technique is used in many different ways. In direct re-
sponse,  it  is  often  referred  to  as  an  involvement  device—
something  that  involves  the  consumer  in  the  buying  process.
Sometimes it may seem silly. Have you ever received those so-
licitations that say, “Put the ‘yes’ disk into the ‘yes’ slot and we
will send you a trial subscription to our new magazine”? I often

132

T H E   P S Y C H O L O G I C A L   T R I G G E R S

wonder who invented that seemingly simpleminded and juvenile
concept. Yet,  as  direct  marketers  will  tell  you,  this  type  of  in-
volvement  device  often  doubles  and  triples  response  rates.  It’s
not simpleminded at all but rather a very effective direct response
involvement technique.

The reader becomes involved in the solicitation. Similarly,
your  reader  is  either  taking  action  or  imagining  taking  action
through the power of the words you write.

The Involvement of TV and the Internet
TV and the Internet are great examples of involvement. You see,
hear and can almost touch the product. It is no wonder that TV
and the Internet are among the most effective ways to sell.

My  own  daughter,  when  she  was  four  years  old,  clearly
demonstrated  how  you  can  get  involved  in  the  sales  message.
There was a Peanuts Valentine’s Day TV special and my daugh-
ter Jill was sitting and watching the show with her seven-year-
old  sister, April.  My  wife,  who  was  watching  as  well,  told  me
this fascinating story.

Charlie Brown was passing out Valentine cards in a classroom and
was reading off names of the recipients, “Sarah, Mary, Sally . . . Jill.
Where’s  Jill?”  said  Charlie  Brown.  My  daughter  immediately
raised her hand and said, “Here.” She was so involved in watching
the show that she felt like she was a part of it.

I use involvement devices quite often. An involvement de-
vice that ties in with what you are selling can be very effective.
Let me give you a perfect example from an ad that I wrote. The
results really surprised me.

The product I was offering was the Franklin Spelling Com-
puter—a device that helped correct your spelling. It was a nov-
elty  when  it  ﬁrst  appeared  and  it  sold  quite  well.  Although  I
wasn’t the ﬁrst to sell it, I had a model that was a little more so-
phisticated than the ﬁrst version.

I examined the product and felt it was priced too high. But
the manufacturer would be pretty upset with me if I were to drop
the price. So I tried an involvement device as a method of lower-
ing the price.

First,  I  wrote  an  ad  that  described  the  product  but  with  an

133

U N D E R S T A N D I N G   W H A T   W O R K S

unusual  premise.  The  ad  that  I  wrote  had  several  misspelled
words. If you found the misspelled words, circled them and sent
the ad with the misspelled words circled, you would get $2 off the
price of the computer for each misspelled word you circled. My
concept was simple. If you didn’t ﬁnd all the misspelled words,
you paid more for the computer, but then again, the computer was
worth more to you than to somebody who found all the mistakes.
I ran the ﬁrst ad in the Wall Street Journal and the responses
poured in. I also received a few phone calls from people I hadn’t
heard from in years. “Joe, I want you to know, I spent the last
hour and a half trying to ﬁnd all the words and I don’t even in-
tend on buying your damn computer. I normally don’t read the
entire Wall Street Journal for that length of time.”

I Even Made More Money
And the response was surprising. I anticipated that the readers
would  ﬁnd  all  the  misspelled  words.  In  fact,  even  the  word
mispelled was misspelled. When the response was ﬁnally tallied,
to  my  amazement,  people  only  caught,  on  average,  half  of  the
words and I earned a lot more money than I had expected from
the ad. And, of course, those who really needed the computer got
real value.

The feeling of ownership is a concept that is pretty close to
the feeling of involvement, but here you are making readers feel
that they already own the product and you’re letting them use their
imaginations as you take them through the steps of what it would
be like if they already owned it. An example might be, “When you
receive your exercise device, work out on it. Adjust the weights.
See how easy it is to store under your bed. . . .” In short, you are
making them feel that they have already bought the product.

Advertising copy that involves the reader can be quite effec-
tive—especially if the involvement device is part of the advertis-
ing. Whenever you write an ad, keep this very important concept
in mind. It can make direct response copy far more effective.

2. Honesty

If I had to pick the single most important point of the 64 points, I
would pick honesty. Your advertising must be honest. This doesn’t

134

T H E   P S Y C H O L O G I C A L   T R I G G E R S

mean  that  if  you  are  dishonest  in  your  message  you  won’t
achieve a successful result. Give the consumer a price that’s too
hard to believe or a product that doesn’t live up to its claims and
you might be able to get away with it once, maybe even twice,
but not for the long haul.

But this section on honesty is not about whether you can get
away with being dishonest and for how long. It’s about honesty
as a psychological selling tool. First, let’s start out with a very
important premise.

Consumers  are  very  smart—smarter  than  you  think  and
smarter collectively than any single one of us. With all the ex-
perience I have in marketing products and with all the product
knowledge I’ve gained over the past 35 years, you can take my
word for it, the consumer is quite sharp.

The  consumer  can  also  tell  whether  people  are  truthful  in
what they are trying to communicate. And the more truthful you
are in your advertising, the more effectively your message will
be accepted by your prospects.

Try to lie in your copy and you are only deceiving yourself.
Your copy will say what you think you wanted it to say, but it
will  also  say  what  you  thought  you  covered  up.  Even  a  reader
who hurries over your copy can feel the difference.

When I wrote a JS&A ad, I would include many of the nega-
tive features of my products. I would point out the ﬂaws up front.
And of course, I would explain why the ﬂaws really didn’t amount
to much and why the consumer should still buy my product. Con-
sumers were so impressed with this approach and had such trust in
our message that they would eagerly buy what we offered.

And  it  seemed  that  the  more  truthful  and  frank  my  ads
were, the more the consumers responded. I soon realized that
truthfulness was one of the best advertising lessons I had ever
learned.

Consumers  really  appreciate  the  truth. And  since  they  are
smarter than you or I, you can’t fake the truth. They’ll pick out a
phony statement every time.

I  learned  to  make  every  communication  to  my  customers
truthful, whether it be on national television or in my print ads.
And the more truthful I am, the more responsive my customers.

135

U N D E R S T A N D I N G   W H A T   W O R K S

3. Integrity

Not too far from honesty is integrity. An advertisement is a per-
sonal message from an organization or an individual and is a di-
rect  reﬂection  of  the  writer’s  personality  and  integrity.  You  can
convey  this  integrity  by  the  truthfulness  of  your  message,  the
look of your ad, the image that you convey and even the typefaces
that you use.

Integrity  can  be  reﬂected  by  the  choices  you  make  in  the
layout of your ad. Is it clean and neat? Or is it shouting out at
you with color bars running in different directions and headlines
screaming and words underlined and pictures exaggerated? You
get the idea. The integrity of the person delivering the message is
always amazingly clear to the recipient. And this integrity is of-
ten  reﬂected  by  the  appearance  of  the  advertisement  and  the
copy you write. Show good integrity and your advertising mes-
sage will be well received. Don’t show it and join the ranks of
those who are rarely successful.

4. Credibility

If  you  convey  honesty  and  integrity  in  your  message,  chances
are you’ve gone a long way toward establishing your credibility.
However, credibility is not just honesty and integrity. Credibility
is being believable. In an ad for a product whose price is excep-
tionally low, you’ve got to convey that the offer you are making,
as great as it may seem, is indeed a valid offer.

Let’s say you are offering something for $10 that everybody
else  is  selling  for  $40.  Your  job  is  establishing  credibility  for
your price. You might explain that you are buying a very large
volume from the Far East and that you were able to buy the re-
maining stock from a major manufacturer for a very low price.
In short, you’ve got to establish the credibility of your company
and your offer.

Credibility also means truthfulness. Does the consumer re-
ally believe you? Rash statements, clichés and some exaggera-
tions will remove any credibility your offer may have had.

One of the most important factors that could affect credi-

136

T H E   P S Y C H O L O G I C A L   T R I G G E R S

bility is not resolving all the objections that are raised in your
readers’ minds, such as hiding something or avoiding an obvious
fault of the product or service. You need to raise all objections
and resolve them.

Products that require installation or assembly are good ex-
amples. If it is obvious that a product doesn’t just pop out of the
box ready to use, you must explain that it does require assembly.
You might say something like, “To make it easy, we provide you
with the tools. In our tests, it only took ﬁve minutes for some-
body  with  very  little  mechanical  skill  to  put  it  together.”  Once
again, it is the anticipation of objections and their resolution that
means so much to the credibility of an ad.

You are in essence sensing the next question the consumer
may ask and answering it in a straightforward, honest and cred-
ible way. The integrity of your product, your offer and yourself
are all on the line, and unless you convey the highest credibility
in  your  ad,  your  prospects  will  not  feel  comfortable  buying
from you.

When I appear on QVC—the TV home shopping channel—
it is easy to sell a difﬁcult product that normally would require a
lot of credibility. The reason: QVC already has a lot of credibility
with their customers. If a product is being offered on QVC, it must
be good. It must have the quality that customers have come to ex-
pect,  and  chances  are  the  product  will  be  bought  by  somebody
who has bought products before from QVC and already feels that
the company is a very credible concern. In short, I’ve piggybacked
my  product  onto  QVC’s  credibility,  and  the  combination  of
QVC’s credibility and my product’s credibility is pretty powerful.
The  effect  of  credibility  also  extends  to  the  magazines  or
newspapers in which you advertise. If you advertise your prod-
uct in the Wall Street Journal, you are piggybacking onto their
credibility and their constant vigilance, making sure their readers
aren’t  being  taken  advantage  of.  On  the  other  hand,  place  that
same ad in the National Enquirer and you then take on the lack
of credibility that this publication has established in the mind of
the  reader. Again,  credibility  is  affected  by  the  environment  in
which you place your advertisement.

You  can  enhance  credibility  through  the  use  of  a  brand

137

U N D E R S T A N D I N G   W H A T   W O R K S

name product. For example, if I’m offering an electronic product
by the name of Yorx with the exact same features as one whose
brand name is Sony, which one has more credibility?  The Sony
would probably sell better if both were at the same price.

Adding an appropriate celebrity endorser is another effec-
tive way to enhance credibility. The name of a company can, too.
For  example,  there  was  a  company  by  the  name  of  The  Tool
Shack  selling  computers.  This  company’s  name  actually  de-
tracted from the credibility of the product it was selling. We once
ran the same ad in the Wall Street Journal to test the effect of our
JS&A name against a lesser-known name—Consumers Hero. In
the test, the JS&A ad far outpulled the other ad. Only the name
of the company was different. Sometimes a city or state can add
credibility. That’s why some companies located in smaller cities
have ofﬁces in London, Paris or New York. The various ways of
adding credibility should be an important consideration in craft-
ing your advertising.

5. Value and Proof of Value

Even if you are a multimillionaire, you want to know that you are
not  being  taken  advantage  of,  and  even  more  importantly,  that
you are getting value for your ﬁnancial investment.

In an ad, the copywriter wants to convey, through examples
or  by  comparison,  that  what  the  customer  is  buying  is  a  good
value. A typical example in one of my ads is where I compare
my prices to products with similar features and point out that I’m
providing a better value.

By positioning your product and comparing it with others
or by proving the value of something even though the value may
not  be  apparent,  you  are  providing  the  logic  with  which  the
prospect can justify the purchase.

Simply  educating  the  reader  to  the  intrinsic  value  of  your
product is equivalent to lowering its price. In short, there is a value
associated with the education you are providing your reader.

The buying transaction is an emotional experience that uses
logic to justify the buying decision. You buy a Mercedes auto-
mobile  emotionally  but  you  then  justify  its  purchase  logically

138

T H E   P S Y C H O L O G I C A L   T R I G G E R S

with  its  technology,  safety  and  resale  value.  So  justifying  its
value is something that the consumer wants to do before making
an emotional purchase.

And with such intense competition in the world, there is a
question in the mind of the consumer: “Am I buying the product
at the best price?” Once again, you must resolve that question or
you are not communicating effectively with your prospect.

6. Justify the Purchase

One of the questions people may think about while reading an ad
is “Can I really justify this purchase?” Once again, it is a ques-
tion that is raised and then must be resolved. If you don’t resolve
it,  then  you  won’t  answer  all  the  prospect’s  questions  and  this
will  give  the  prospect  the  excuse  to  “think  about  it”  and,  of
course, never buy.

Somewhere in your ad, you should resolve any objection by
providing some justiﬁcation to the purchaser. Sometimes it’s just
saying, “You deserve it.” And other times you might have to jus-
tify  it  in  terms  of  savings  (the  price  is  a  one-time-only  value),
health reasons (protects your eyes), recognition (the men in your
life will love the way you look in it) or dozens of other reasons
based on the wants and needs of your prospect.

People  often  tell  me,  “Joe,  when  I  read  your  ads,  I  feel
guilty if I don’t buy the product.” That’s quite a compliment and
probably due to the way I justify a purchase in the mind of the
consumer.

The higher the price point, the more need there is to justify
the  purchase.  The  lower  the  price  point  or  the  more  value  the
price represents, the less you have to justify the purchase. In fact,
the lower the price, the more greed plays a role.

7. Greed

Greed in the form of attraction to bargains is a very strong mo-
tivating  factor.  I  don’t  know  how  many  times  I’ve  bought
things  even  though  I  didn’t  need  them  simply  because  they
were a bargain.

139

U N D E R S T A N D I N G   W H A T   W O R K S

Don’t hesitate to recognize greed as a very strong factor in
either low-priced merchandise or expensive products offered at
low prices. Too low a price may diminish your credibility unless
you justify the low price. Many people are willing to risk deal-
ing with an unknown vendor just to pay less and get more for
their  money.  Providing  the  consumer  with  more  than  what  is
normally received for the price is a way of appealing to the con-
sumer’s greed.

In one of my earlier ads in the Wall Street Journal, I offered
a  calculator  for  $49.95  and  the  manufacturer  got  really  upset
with me. “That product should have sold for $69.95 and now I
have dealers all over the country calling me and complaining,”
screamed the manufacturer.

“Don’t worry,” I said. “I’ll correct it.” So I ran a small ad in
the Wall Street Journal announcing my error, raising the price from
$49.95 to $69.95 and giving consumers just a few days to respond
at the old price. Even though the size of the ad was considerably
smaller, it outpulled the previous one as people rushed to buy the
calculator within those few days at the $49.95 bargain price.

Greed is not a technique that can be employed all the time.
But it should be recognized as an effective element that plays on
everybody’s weakness.

When you lower the price of a product, you usually end up
with  more  unit  sales.  Keep  lowering  the  price,  and  you’ll  con-
tinue to generate more unit sales than before if the price drop is
big enough. Go too low and you’ll have to add a little justiﬁca-
tion for the lower price as it will start raising credibility issues
with your prospects.

Greed is really not a very positive human trait. But it exists
and  it  is  a  force  to  consider  when  communicating  with  your
prospects.

8. Establish Authority

There’s always something that you can say about your company
to  establish  your  authority,  size,  position  or  intention. The  con-
sumer  loves  to  do  business  with  experts  in  a  particular  area.

140

T H E   P S Y C H O L O G I C A L   T R I G G E R S

That’s  why  the  trend  is  away  from  department  stores  that  sell
general merchandise to category stores that sell a speciﬁc line of
products. These stores have more expertise, knowledge and au-
thority in a speciﬁc category.

For  example,  for  years  I  would  call  JS&A “America’s
largest single source of space-age products.” What I was really
doing was establishing the authority of JS&A as a major supplier
of space-age products. The words “single source” really meant
that  we  shipped  our  products  out  of  a  single  location. We  may
not  have  shipped  more  space-age  products  than  Sears  or  Ra-
dioShack, but we shipped more out of a single location and we
specialized only in space-age products.

Establishing  your  authority  is  something  that  should  be
done  in  each  ad  regardless  of  how  big  or  how  little  you  are.
For example, “America’s largest supplier of specialized prod-
ucts for the chimney sweep industry.” (One of my seminar par-
ticipants was actually in the chimney sweep industry.) Or even
if  you  are  the  smallest,  you  can  always  say,  “The  hardest-
working bunch of guys in the advertising business.” If you re-
ally examine your company, you will ﬁnd something you can
say  that  establishes  your  authority  and  expertise  in  what  you
are selling.

Then, after you establish your authority, there is going to be
the temptation to stop using the phrase that established your au-
thority. I know that when we had run our phrase for almost six
years I wondered if we really needed it. But there were always
those ﬁrst-time readers who caught the ad and needed that reas-
surance that they were dealing with an authoritative company in
the  ﬁeld  in  which  they  were  contemplating  a  purchase.  That
phrase gave them the conﬁdence.

Sometimes it is easy to establish authority by virtue of the
name  of  the  company. American  Symbolic  Corporation  was  a
company I set up once whose name sounded like it was a very
big operation. Jack and Ed’s Video doesn’t sound very big at all.
Computer Discount Warehouse gives you a pretty good idea of
their authority. It has name recognition, plus it tells you what the
company is through its name.

141

U N D E R S T A N D I N G   W H A T   W O R K S

People Respect Authority
People naturally respect a knowledgeable authority. Let’s say you
want to buy a computer. You might ﬁrst check with the expert in
your neighborhood who is known as the neighborhood computer
genius. Let’s call him Danny. He has established his authority and
you  feel  quite  comfortable  going  to  Danny  to  get  advice.  He’ll
then tell you what he thinks you should buy and from whom. And
chances  are,  he’ll  recommend  some  retail  outlet  that  has  estab-
lished itself with some level of authority. It might be the cheapest
computer company or maybe the company that provides the best
service. You’ll seek out the type of authority you need.

Sometimes the authority does not even have to be stated but
can be felt by the copy, the layout or the message of an ad. Es-
tablish your authority in the ﬁeld of the product or service you
are  selling  and  you’ll  ﬁnd  that  it  will  make  a  big  difference  in
your copy’s effectiveness.

Let me give you a personal example of something that re-
ally illustrates the point. As I was about to walk into a local busi-
ness supply store in Las Vegas, a young lady came running up to
me and said, “Please, could you help me?”

I was a little surprised by the suddenness of her approach
and, in fact, ﬁrst thought that there was some kind of emergency.
“Sure, what’s the problem?”

Almost with tears in her eyes, she answered, “I’m about to
buy a computer and I’ve picked out the one I like the most, but I
need somebody to tell me if I’ve made the right choice. If you
know about computers, could you come in the store with me and
give me your opinion?”

I agreed and went into the store with her. The girl explained
that she was attending college at UNLV (the University of Nevada
at Las Vegas) and since this was her ﬁrst computer, she needed re-
assurance  from  somebody  who  knew  computers  that  this  was  a
good and wise purchase. She told me how most of the people in the
store really didn’t know that much about computers. I looked over
the computer and, having pretty good knowledge about home com-
puters, told her that she had indeed made a wise choice and that the
computer was also a good value. I pointed out some of the techni-
cal features that would help her in her schoolwork, and although

142

T H E   P S Y C H O L O G I C A L   T R I G G E R S

she didn’t have any idea of what I was talking about, she felt that
she was making the right choice because I said so.

Nobody Wants to Make a Mistake
Relieved, she thanked me, and then was off to buy her new com-
puter. As  she  was  walking  away,  she  looked  over  her  shoulder
and said, “I’ve worked hard for my money and I didn’t want to
make a stupid mistake.”

Before  you  bought  a  computer,  you  may  have  ﬁrst  called
somebody who was a partial expert on computers to ask for an
opinion. You, too, wanted reassurance and conﬁdence about the
purchase you were making—that the money you were about to
exchange for a computer was going to be spent wisely. The same
holds true when you buy anything of value. You just want reas-
surance. If, however, you can trust the sales organization as the
experts, then you won’t need any outside expert opinion as the
young student needed in the preceding example.

Even after you buy something, you often seek conﬁrmation
that  your  purchase  was  a  good  one.  The  late  direct  marketing
consultant Paul Bringe once wrote: “One of the ﬁrst things we
do after making a sizable purchase is to seek assurance from oth-
ers  that  our  decision  was  a  good  one.  We  tell  our  family,  our
neighbors, our friends and our business associates and wait for
their approval.”

One of the surprises I had while taking orders on our phone
lines at JS&A was the number of customers who stated something
like,  “I  bet  that’s  one  of  your  best-selling  products.”  In  many
cases, it wasn’t. But in every case, whenever I mentioned that the
product they had just purchased was indeed a very popular prod-
uct, there was always a comment like, “I just knew that it was.”
People need reassurance that they have made the right purchase.

9. Satisfaction Conviction

When you saw this heading, you might have thought we would
be talking about the trial period. Indeed, a trial period could be
deﬁned as a form of satisfaction conviction. “If you aren’t totally
satisﬁed  with  my  product  within  one  month,  you  may  send  it

143

U N D E R S T A N D I N G   W H A T   W O R K S

back for a full refund.” But that isn’t what we mean here. Sure,
every direct response offer should have a trial period. After all,
the consumer needs to touch and feel a product to make a deci-
sion  about  whether  to  keep  it.  So  the  trial  period  provides  the
buyer with a level of conﬁdence. The consumer can change his
or her mind if it is not exactly what he or she is looking for.

But a satisfaction conviction is more than a trial period. It
basically  conveys  a  message  from  you  to  your  prospect  that
says, “Hey, I’m so convinced you will like this product that I’m
going to do something for your beneﬁt to prove how incredible
my offer is.”

If your potential customer, after reading what you are going
to  do,  says  something  like,  “They  must  really  believe  in  their
product,”  or  “How  can  they  do  it?”  or  “Are  they  going  to  get
ripped off by customers who will take advantage of their generos-
ity?” then you know you’ve got a great example of a satisfaction
conviction.

Let me give you an example. When I ﬁrst offered BluBlocker
sunglasses, I said in my TV advertising, “If you’re unhappy with
BluBlockers, I’ll let you return them anytime you want. There is
no  trial  period.” A lot  of  people  thought  to  themselves,  “That
must be a good product or otherwise they wouldn’t make that of-
fer.” Or they may have said, “Boy, are they going to get ripped
off.”  In  either  case,  I  conveyed  a  conviction  that  my  customer
was going to be so satisﬁed that I was willing to do something
that is rarely done.

In one ad, I stated, “If you aren’t happy with your purchase,
just call me up and I’ll personally arrange to have it picked up at
my expense and refund you every penny of your purchase price
including the time you took to return the product.”

Testing a Satisfaction Conviction
Once I was able to test the power of a satisfaction conviction. In
an ad I wrote for the company called Consumers Hero, I was of-
fering  subscriptions  to  a  discount  bulletin  showing  refurbished
products at very low prices. But rather than just mail the bulletin
to prospects, I formed a club and offered a subscription to the bul-
letin. I tested various elements in the 700-word ad. I changed the

144

T H E   P S Y C H O L O G I C A L   T R I G G E R S

headline  and  tested  it  and  improved  response  by  20  percent.  I
changed the price and saw little change in total response. The lower
the price, however, the more orders I received. But when I changed
just the satisfaction conviction, the response rate doubled.

In one ad, I said, “If you don’t buy anything during your
two-year  subscription,  I’ll  refund  the  unused  portion  of  your
subscription.”

In the second ad I stated, “But what if you never buy from
us  and  your  two-year  membership  expires?  Fine.  Send  us  just
your  membership  card  and  we’ll  fully  refund  your  ﬁve  dollars
plus send you interest on your money.”

In the ﬁrst ad, you see a basic, simple trial-period type of-
fer. In the second version, however, you see an offer that goes
well beyond the trial period and can be classiﬁed as a satisfac-
tion conviction.

In the test, the response doubled even though the satisfac-
tion conviction was at the very end of the ad. This meant that
people read the entire ad and then, at the very end when that
important  buying  decision  had  to  be  made,  the  satisfaction
conviction  removed  any  remaining  resistance  to  buying  into
the concept.

If you have gotten the reader into the slippery slide and all
the  way  to  the  end  of  an  ad,  it’s  that  last  part  of  the  ad  where
you’ve got an awful lot to do. Think about it. You’ve got to ex-
plain the offer to the prospect, why it’s a good offer and why he
or she should buy the product, and then you’ve got to do some-
thing dramatic to push him or her over the edge—all within the
very last part of your sales message. It’s like a salesperson ask-
ing for the order and then also saying, “And if you buy this from
me now, I will do something that few salespeople would do to
ensure your satisfaction.”

The right satisfaction conviction is important, too. The ideal
satisfaction conviction should raise an objection and resolve it,
as I’ve indicated in the previous chapter, but in resolving it, go
beyond what people expect.

It was effective in my Consumers Hero ad because it tied
perfectly  into  resolving  any  last-minute  resistance.  First  it
raised the objection—“What if I don’t buy from your bulletin

145

U N D E R S T A N D I N G   W H A T   W O R K S

over  a  two-year  period?” And  then  I  resolved  it  with  a  satis-
faction  conviction—something  that  went  beyond  what  people
expected.

But  be  careful  to  use  a  satisfaction  conviction  that  makes
sense for the offer. You wouldn’t want to raise an objection and
then satisfy it with the wrong resolution. Make sure any objec-
tion is indeed satisﬁed by the correct resolution. In short, it’s got
to make sense.

The  satisfaction  conviction  is  a  critical  part  of  the  sales
message and few realize its importance. Yet, if you can create a
powerful  satisfaction  conviction,  this  simple  device  will  do  a
great deal for the success of your offers.

10. Nature of Product

This is one of the really important keys in determining how to
sell a product. First, you have to realize that every product has its
own unique personality, its own unique nature, and it’s up to you
to ﬁgure it out.

How do you present the drama of that product? Every prod-
uct has one very powerful way of presenting itself that will ex-
press  the  true  advantages  and  emotion  that  the  product  has  to
offer and motivate the largest number of people to buy it.

Remember  the  Midex  burglar  alarm  that  I  sold  for  many
years through full-page ads in national magazines? What was the
nature of that product and how could I motivate people to buy it?
I explained that in Chapter 2.

I  used  the  security  system  as  an  example  of  the  nature  of
products. This was an unusual product because it had a unique
personality. The product category itself had its own proﬁle. By
realizing the nature of every product and playing to its strengths,
you will end up with a very powerful and emotionally dramatic
presentation.

Think  about  other  examples. What  is  the  nature  of  a  toy?
It’s a fun game. So you bring out the enjoyment. What is the na-
ture of a blood pressure unit? It’s a serious medical device that
you  use  to  check  your  blood  pressure.  Note  the  word  serious.
What is the nature of a burglar alarm? It’s a serious product that

146

T H E   P S Y C H O L O G I C A L   T R I G G E R S

should be easy to install, work when it is supposed to and provide
protection to concerned homeowners. Very often, common sense is
all you need to understand and appreciate the nature of a product.

Realize that you must understand the nature of the product

you are selling or you won’t effectively sell it.

11. Prospect Nature

In selling, it is important to understand not only the nature of the
product you are offering but the nature of your prospect as well.
When I was in college and thinking about joining a fraternity, I
had an experience that really points out the value of understand-
ing this very important trigger.

Of all the fraternities I could have joined in college, I chose
the worst one. Why? After spending time visiting various frater-
nities, I had ﬁgured out the nature of why guys join a fraternity
in the ﬁrst place.

I reasoned that with this knowledge, I could single-handedly
take the worst fraternity on campus and turn it into the best one,
simply  by  coming  up  with  an  effective  marketing  plan  to  dra-
matically  increase  membership.  My  approach  would  take  into
account the nature of my prospect (the student) and, using this
information, seduce that student into wanting to join my frater-
nity  at  the  exclusion  of  all  others.  I  would  thus,  by  building  a
large membership, transform my fraternity into a top-rated orga-
nization, regardless of how bad it had been when I joined. This
may seem like a rather naive plan, but I was convinced that I per-
sonally could make a difference.

After joining and going through the initiation period, I got
sworn  in,  went  before  my  fraternity  brothers,  and  laid  out  my
plan—“Operation Survival” as I called it. I explained that guys
join  a  fraternity  for  two  psychological  and  motivating  factors:
One was as a vehicle to meet girls and the other was to experi-
ence  the  camaraderie  and  brotherhood  of  a  group  of  guys.  I
showed that an illusion could be created to capture this effect of
social  interaction  in  a  fraternity  for  the  sake  of  acquiring  new
members or pledges. The goal was to have more guys wanting to
join our fraternity than any other on campus. And we needed this

147

U N D E R S T A N D I N G   W H A T   W O R K S

big  infusion  of  new  faces  or  our  fraternity  would  surely  die—
that’s how bad this place was and how badly we were doing at-
tracting new members. It truly was Operation Survival.

My  plan  was  simple  and  consisted  of  two  parts.  The  ﬁrst
part was to invite the most beautiful and sexy girls to act as host-
esses  for  our  get-acquainted  events.  I  didn’t  want  the  active
brothers’ girlfriends to act as hostesses as was usually the case.
No, these gals had to be world-class—girls the guys would talk
about for days after our event.

The second was the way each brother had to introduce a fel-
low  brother  to  a  prospective  member.  I  insisted  that  the  brother
should say to a prospect something very loving and warm about
his fellow fraternity brother. I said, “Put your arms around your
brother and tell the prospect what a wonderful person your brother
is and how much you genuinely admire and love this guy.”

The plan was not as easy to execute as it might seem. First,
no world-class gal on campus wanted any part of my fraternity.
Second, the guys hated each other, and expressing love about a
fellow brother whom you hated seemed a rather difﬁcult gesture,
if not impossible. But I did a few things that made it work.

We hired four of the most beautiful strippers from the local
strip clubs. They were young, sexy, and welcomed the opportu-
nity to assume roles as sexy university coeds and hostesses for
our  three  planned  get-acquainted  parties.  I  then  rehearsed  the
guys and made them put their arms around each other, express-
ing this new brotherly love that was so foreign and repulsive to
them. They could barely stand it. But the charade worked.

Not only did we end up with the biggest pledge class in our
history, beating all the other fraternities, but some of the guys ac-
tually got closer to their fellow brothers, and an entire new spirit
spread throughout the fraternity. There was such a buzz around
campus about the girls who were acting as our hostesses that by
the  time  we  held  our  third  party,  we  didn’t  have  room  for  the
crowd that we attracted. In fact, the strippers enjoyed their expe-
rience  so  much  that  they  invited  some  of  their  beautiful  girl-
friends  to  join  the  fun. The  guests  were  so  impressed  with  the
love, brotherhood, and display of beautiful women that when it
came time to join, they were literally begging to sign up.

148

T H E   P S Y C H O L O G I C A L   T R I G G E R S

I  had  understood  the  psychological  trigger  of  my  product
(the fraternity) and of my prospect (the young man looking for a
place  to  ﬁnd  love  and  social  interaction).  The  key  in  this  case
was  the  power  of  knowing  the  nature  of  the  prospect—those
emotional  aspects  of  the  prospect  that  would  respond  best  to  a
planned pitch. Operation Survival was a huge success and trans-
formed my fraternity into one of the best on campus—all from a
simple marketing plan and in a few short weeks.

Let me cite a few more examples to illustrate this very im-
portant principle. If I was selling a home, I would get to know
the motivations of my prospects and what they are looking for in
a home. I would ﬁnd out their history. I would ask them about
their other home-buying experiences and what their hobbies are.
I would gather as much information about them as possible and
then  I  would  develop  a  sense  of  what  emotional  needs  they
might have.

Understanding their needs and the nature of the prospect in
general would give me enough information to craft a very effec-
tive  sales  presentation  that,  ideally,  would  match  the  nature  of
my product with the nature of my prospect.

The  prospect  has  basic  emotional  needs  that  your  product
or service will solve, regardless of how sophisticated or simple
your  product  offering  is.  Examine  those  emotional  needs.  It  is
from  the  perspective  of  emotion  that  you  will  reach  the  core
essence  of  your  prospect’s  motivation.  And  it  is  from  this
essence that you will get all the clues you need to uncover the
way to that prospect’s heart and soul and eventually to his or her
pocketbook.

12. Current Fads

There are always a number of fads taking place at the same time.
One  might  be  a  clothing  fad,  another  might  be  an  unusual  ex-
pression  made  popular  by  a  TV show  or  commercial,  or  a  fad
might be a popular trend.

There are also fads in direct response. On TV right now, the
hottest products are exercise devices. There was a time when real
estate  shows  were  popular.  Be  aware  of  the  current  fads  so  you

149

U N D E R S T A N D I N G   W H A T   W O R K S

can determine the hottest product categories and also the new lan-
guage  of  our  time.  You  want  to  recognize  them  and  harmonize
with them.

A good example of recognizing fads and knowing what to
do with them comes from an experience I had with Richard Guil-
foyle,  a  direct  marketer  from  Boston.  He  had  a  strong  sense  of
history and prided himself on creating replicas of historic Ameri-
can objects—Paul Revere’s lantern, a statue of George Washing-
ton  at  Valley  Forge,  a  salt  and  pepper  set  from  the  time  of  the
Revolutionary War. In 1975 his company was doing quite well.

And no wonder. The country was about to celebrate its bi-
centennial anniversary, and this class of merchandise was being
recognized  as  a  way  of  celebrating  the  birth  of  our  nation  200
years before. Sales were brisk. Richard was capitalizing on this
current fad for American Revolutionary period products.

Then the bottom of his business fell out. Sales plummeted
and he couldn’t ﬁgure out why. And it all happened just prior to
July 4th, 1976—the date of the bicentennial celebration.

When  he  attended  my  seminar,  he  was  really  quite  disap-
pointed  with  his  business.  What  happened?  I  suggested  that
maybe it was because people were associating his merchandise
with the anniversary of the United States. Since that date had al-
ready passed, his sales reﬂected this perception.

But Richard insisted that this wasn’t the case. “My products
have true historic signiﬁcance and have nothing to do with the
bicentennial.” Could I simply look at his copy and help him im-
prove it?

After looking over his copy, which was actually quite good,
I saw clearly what the problem was. He had not recognized that
consumers  perceived  his  products  as  part  of  the  excitement  of
the bicentennial and not as a part of American history that they
could save and own.

He then showed me a few ads he had prepared as a result
of attending my seminar. One of them was for a necklace with
a small replica of a Paul Revere lantern that had a diamond in
the  center  representing  the  light.  It  was  a  beautiful  piece  of
jewelry.

150

T H E   P S Y C H O L O G I C A L   T R I G G E R S

I read the copy and said, “You have a winner here. This ad
will do well—not because of the historic nature of the necklace
but  because  of  the  beautiful  piece  of  jewelry  that  it  is. You’re
now selling jewelry, Richard, not good old Americana.”

Sure enough, the ad was a huge success and he soon real-

ized how a powerful fad can grow and fade.

Fads Generate Publicity
I used fads as a way of generating publicity when I was doing
public relations for a few of my clients. One owned a ski resort
and was trying to increase the awareness of snowmobiles at his
resort. At the time, during the mid to late 1960s, the women’s lib
movement was new, strong and vocal. I suggested that the resort
owner ban women snowmobile drivers and issue a press release
proudly announcing the fact. He did and the publicity went na-
tional. He rescinded his ban and snowmobile sales grew dramat-
ically from the national publicity and attention.

At  the  same  time,  one  of  my  accounts—Jerry  Herman,
owner of the Spot pizza restaurant near Northwestern University
in  Evanston,  Illinois—wanted  national  publicity,  too.  Women
were in the middle of an unusual fad—throwing their bras away
and  going  braless.  I  suggested  to  Jerry  that  he  design  a  bra-
shaped  pizza  and  he,  too,  got  national  publicity.  While  these
publicity  stunts  might  seem  a  bit  silly  in  retrospect,  back  then
they were effective because they tied into a fad of the times.

A fad can die just as quickly as it can grow. So you must
capture the moment early enough and get out right after the fad
peaks. The people who came out with radar detectors when they
became a fad did exceptionally well. A few of them attended my
seminar and wrote great ads and built their companies into very
successful entities.

One  of  the  companies  selling  radar  detectors—Cincinnati
Microwave—sent three of their top people to my seminar before
it really took off and became a $140 million company with over
$40 million in proﬁts.

But  be  careful.  I  can  tell  you  stories  (I  should  say  night-
mares)  that  show  how  dangerous  fads  can  be  to  your  ﬁnancial
health.  During  the  Watergate  scandal,  I  once  introduced  “The

151

U N D E R S T A N D I N G   W H A T   W O R K S

Watergate  Game—a  game  of  intrigue  and  deception  for  the
whole family.” But no store would carry it because of the contro-
versy and I lost my shirt. I once created the Batman credit card to
capture the Batman fad of the 1960s and printed 250,000 of them
only to be denied a license to sell them.

But  as  you  can  see,  knowing  how  to  recognize  a  fad  and
capitalize  on  it  can  be  a  very  powerful  tool  if  your  timing  is
right. This brings us very nicely to the next topic.

13. Timing

How  many  times  have  you  been  too  early  with  an  idea  or  too
late? I’ve heard complaints from many of my students who have
failed because their timing just wasn’t right.

Timing certainly has a lot to do with fads. You want to be
involved at the beginning of a fad and not enter in the middle or
the  end.  That’s  smart  timing.  But  there  are  products  that  have
just been introduced too early or too late, and that relates to tim-
ing,  too.  When  do  you  introduce  a  new  product?  Is  America
ready for it? And how do you know?

The  answer  really  is  quite  simple:  Nobody  knows.  That’s
why  I  always  test  every  product  that  I  sell  ﬁrst. The  consumer
will tell me if I’m too early or too late or right on target.

When crime increased, it was good common sense to of-
fer  burglar  alarms.  When  the  O.J.  Simpson  case  unraveled,
there  were  plenty  of  opportunities  to  capitalize  on  it  and  the
media sure did.

President  Carter  went  on  television  in  1980  and  repri-
manded Americans,  accusing  us  of  running  up  too  much  debt.
“Stop using your credit cards” was his suggestion. And millions
of  Americans  did  just  that.  Direct  response  rates  plummeted
overnight.  Tests  we  had  previously  run  that  showed  great
promise  were  coming  up  as  losses.  Our  timing  obviously  was
bad but through no fault of ours. Knowing the cause of the prob-
lem helped us keep our sanity.

It’s just as important to know when the timing is bad. We
came out with a product called the Bone Fone, a portable radio
worn  around  the  neck.  It  was  perfect  timing  until  a  product

152

T H E   P S Y C H O L O G I C A L   T R I G G E R S

called the Walkman came out and killed our new product. Tim-
ing. It can kill a product or make it.

I once ran a media test on an electronic blood pressure unit
we were thinking of putting in our catalog. I thought it would do
well and when the results were presented to me, I was amazed at
how well it had done. Armed with a great deal of conﬁdence, I
placed  a  major  national  advertising  campaign  in  all  the  maga-
zines we normally advertised in—spending almost $300,000 at
the  time.  But  even  before  the  ads  started  to  run  I  discovered
that the report I thought was so good was actually produced in
error. The product did not do well in the media test and in fact
did quite poorly.

Since I had already placed the advertising, I braced myself
for the bad response. But my timing proved to be coincidentally
right on target. About the same time as the ads started to run, the
American Heart Association started running a major advertising
campaign  suggesting  that Americans  take  their  blood  pressure
regularly.  Our  sales  jumped  and  what  was  destined  to  become
one of our biggest losses turned into a nice proﬁt. And we even
won the Life Extension Award from the Life Extension Associa-
tion for our work in alerting the public to the need for measuring
their blood pressure regularly.

14. Linking

A very critical technique that I have used in mail order ads is a
process called linking. Basically, it is the technique of relating
what the consumer already knows and understands with what
you  are  selling  to  make  the  new  product  easy  to  understand
and relate to.

One of the easiest ways to explain this trigger is to describe
how  it  works  in  a  fad—a  craze  that  captures  the  public’s  con-
sciousness and quickly creates strong demand, awareness or be-
havioral changes. The demand can be for a product such as for
the Beanie Babies in the 1990s or the citizens band (CB) radios
back  in  the  1970s.  It  can  be  simply  the  strong  awareness  of  a
new or different product or concept, such as the Viagra introduc-
tion in 1998, or it can be for behavioral changes, such as women

153

U N D E R S T A N D I N G   W H A T   W O R K S

throwing away their bras during the women’s liberation move-
ment of the late 1960s.

There are also fads within speciﬁc industries. For example,
in the exercise industry there might be a fad for abdominal de-
vices; on infomercials, there might be a glut of business opportu-
nity shows.

Usually the fads come and go quickly. But the importance
of the fad examples is to show you the process of linking on its
most  basic  and  obvious  levels. Then  I’ll  take  it  deeper  to  give
you  a  sense  of  how  linking  can  be  used  to  effectively  sell  any
product or service.

For example, I used the awareness of a presidential act as a
way  of  selling  products.  When  it  was  discovered  in  1973  that
Nixon  was  using  phone  tap  equipment  to  record  all  his  phone
conversations, there was enormous publicity about it. I immedi-
ately put together a JS&A offer for a system with which anybody
could tap their phones and ran it in the Wall Street Journal under
the headline “Tap Your Phone.”

That ad was a mistake. The FBI showed up at my door and
the  Wall  Street  Journal threatened  not  to  run  my  ads  any  more.
Even worse, I didn’t sell many of the systems and lost money on
the ad. You see, what Nixon did was illegal and so my offer encour-
aged illegal activity even though I had done nothing illegal myself.
In contrast, I caught another fad at just the right time. I of-
fered a walkie-talkie right at the height of the citizens band (CB)
radio boom in the United States. By calling my walkie-talkie a
Pocket CB because it broadcast on one of the CB frequencies, I
was able to capture a major chunk of the CB market.

The minute there is a lot of publicity about something and it
has the potential to turn into a fad, you could have a great oppor-
tunity  to  link  it  onto  something  that  you’re  doing  either  to  get
publicity or to promote a product.

Fads are very powerful. And you now understand the basic
concept of linking. But how does this help you as a copywriter?
Whenever I sell a new product or a unique feature of a new
concept, I use linking. I take what is familiar to the prospect, re-
late it to the object I am selling, and create a bridge in the mind

154

T H E   P S Y C H O L O G I C A L   T R I G G E R S

of  my  prospect.  Because  of  this  linking,  the  prospect  needs  to
think  a  lot  less  to  understand  the  new  product.  The  product  is
easier to relate to the needs of the prospect. Everybody wins.

Linking a Body Part
My  ad  for  a  smoke  detector  was  an  example  of  this  process.
The headline read: “The Nose.” I talked about the smoke de-
tector  not  as  a  smoke  detector  (many  such  devices  were  al-
ready  being  sold)  but  as  a  nose  that  sat  on  your  ceiling  and
sniffed  the  air. When  it  smelled  smoke,  it  set  off  an  alarm.  I
took the very human and simple concept of a nose—a part of
the body whose function is well understood—and then linked
it to an electronic device.

In the ad I also used linking to express quality. For exam-
ple, I talked about the integrated circuits using gold for the con-
tact points. My prospect was then able to link the expense and
quality of gold to this product to arrive at a quality link and jus-
tify  its  higher  price.  In  actuality,  every  integrated  circuit  used
gold for its contact points, so this wasn’t revolutionary, but no-
body had taken the time to explain it to the consumer.

I  have  used  linking  in  many  other  ways.  For  example,  I
had a product that was a remote car starter. You pressed a but-
ton  on  a  remote  control  device  and  your  car  automatically
started. I called it “The Maﬁa Auto Gadget.” Can you see the
linkage with this product? No? Well, I explained it in the ad.
The Maﬁa often used explosives activated by a car’s ignition
to  eliminate  competition.  Because  this  device  started  the  car
for you at a distance, it eliminated the fear and concern for any
Maﬁa  member.  Of  course,  the  market  was  also  broadened  to
include  those  people  who  simply  liked  the  convenience  of
prestarting their cars on hot or cold days and having the cars
reach a pleasant temperature before they got in. But the posi-
tioning of the product was done with a link that the consumer
could understand—the Maﬁa.

Today,  such  a  device  might  be  linked  to  the  terrorist  car
bombings in Iraq or a threat to homeland security—both strong
but unpleasant trends. I doubt the product would be popular to-
day, not to mention the poor association this link would make.

155

This  is  also  a  perfect  example  of  why  it  often  doesn’t  pay  to
copy a successful campaign of the past. But that is another issue.
I could give you many examples. The main point to remem-
ber about linking, though, is that it should relate the product or
service  you  are  selling  to  something  that  is  easy  for  your
prospect to identify with so that you bridge the mental gap in the
mind of the prospect.

Usually  products  are  simply  improved  versions  of  previ-
ously sold products. You need to relate the older product to the
new version to explain the differences.

One  of  the  hardest  things  to  use  linking  for  is  a  miracle
product—a  product  that  is  too  good  to  believe.  For  example,  I
was selling a pill to be put in the gas tank of your car; it would
improve gas mileage and clean out the engine, and had 10 times
the fuel additives of super unleaded fuel. It was truly an amazing
product and difﬁcult to link to anything that existed in the mar-
ketplace.  We  used  the  phrases  “vitamins  for  your  car”  and
“tuneup in a pill” as a few of our links.

Linking is a basic human emotional system of storing expe-
riences and knowledge and then recalling those experiences and
linking them to something we have to deal with on a daily basis
or  that  is  in  the  public’s  consciousness.  We  often  link.  When
President John F. Kennedy died, I was in the military in Frank-
furt,  Germany,  and  his  assassination  took  place  in  the  evening
Frankfurt time. I remember where I was at that precise moment
and remember the confusion and the personal pain I felt. I linked
every  image  and  emotion  to  that  moment  in  time.  Do  you  re-
member where you were when you ﬁrst found out about the at-
tacks on September 11th?

15. Consistency

As a direct marketer, I have determined that the most important
thing you can do to turn a prospect into a customer is to make it
incredibly  easy  for  that  prospect  to  commit  to  a  purchase,  re-
gardless of how small that purchase may be. It is therefore im-
perative that the commitment be simple, small, and in line with
the prospect’s needs.

156

T H E   P S Y C H O L O G I C A L   T R I G G E R S

Once the commitment is made and the prospect becomes a
customer, the playing ﬁeld suddenly changes. There now exists a
level of commitment and consistency, directed in your favor, to
encourage future purchases.

A good example of this can be seen at a car dealership. The
salesperson tallies your purchase, gets approval from the general
manager, and then has you sign the paperwork. As she is walking
away to get the car prepped and ready for you to drive away, she
turns  to  you  and  says,  “And  you  do  want  that  undercoating,
don’t  you?”  You  instinctively  nod  your  head.  The  charge  is
added to your invoice. “And you’ll also want our ﬂoor mats to
keep your car clean as well, won’t you?”

Or how about the times when you order something from a
catalog and say to yourself, “Since I’m going through the trouble
or ordering, let’s see what else they have that I might like,” and
you end up ordering more.

Once a commitment is made, the tendency is to act consis-

tently with that commitment. The customer nods his head.

A good example of this phenomenon was told to me by Jon
Spoelstra, the former general manager of the Portland Trailblaz-
ers basketball team and president of the New Jersey Nets. One of
his primary jobs was to sell tickets. “I would personally visit a
prospect,  sell  him  a  simple  yet  basic  ticket  package,  start  to
leave, and then turn around just as I was about to walk out the
door  and  offer  something  else. Very  often  my  customer  would
simply nod his head and say under his breath, ‘Yeah, sure, add
that to it, too.’”

One of the important points to remember is to always make
that ﬁrst sale simple. Once the prospect makes the commitment
to purchase from you, you can then easily offer more to increase
your sales. This is equally true for products sold from a mail or-
der ad or from a TV infomercial. I have learned to keep the ini-
tial  offer  extremely  simple.  Then,  once  the  prospect  calls  and
orders the product I am offering, and while the prospect is on the
phone, I offer other items and end up with a larger total sale. An
additional sale occurs over 50 percent of the time, depending on
my added offer.

Once  you’ve  committed  to  the  original  purchase,  you  are

157

U N D E R S T A N D I N G   W H A T   W O R K S

poised for a course of action consistent with what you have al-
ready undertaken. In the case of buying, you are now primed to
buy more by virtue of the original commitment to buy.

16. Harmonize

An important lesson I taught at the seminar was learned from the
story of how the late Bobby Darin, a popular singer of the 1950s
and 1960s, became famous.

As  a  young  singer  in  New  York,  for  a  long  time  Darin
tried  unsuccessfully  to  break  into  the  music  business.  He
would  go  from  record  company  to  record  company  trying  to
convince them to make an album of him singing old popular
standards.

He was rejected. Nobody believed that the music industry
would accept old popular songs from an unknown young singer.
Besides,  the  hot  music  at  the  time  was  good  old  rock  and  roll
sung by black artists and called the Motown sound.

Darin was quite frustrated, so he took things into his own
hands. Did he cut his own album by himself? No, he didn’t have
the  money.  Did  he  convince  a  record  company  to  record  him?
Yes,  but  not  the  songs  he  so  desperately  wanted  to  record.  In-
stead he sat down and wrote a tune that ﬁtted or harmonized with
what the public was buying at the time.

The  tune  he  wrote  was  called  “Splish  Splash,”  and  the
lyrics  started  out,  “Splish  splash,  I  was  takin’ a  bath,  ‘round
about  a  Saturday  night.”  It  went  on  to  tell  a  story  about  what
happened when he took that bath. The song was good old Mo-
town rock and roll and he easily sold this music to a record com-
pany,  which  recorded  it  with  Darin  singing  the  lead.  “Splish
Splash” became a smash hit and sold millions of records. In the
recording, he even sounded like a Motown recording artist.

Darin recognized what the market wanted and was buying
at the time, and he created something that harmonized perfectly
with that market, even though his song was far from the music
that was in his heart. He made the practical choice to put aside
his desires, put aside his ego and goals, and just cut a record that

158

T H E   P S Y C H O L O G I C A L   T R I G G E R S

would sell and earn him the recognition he needed to record the
type of music he really wanted to record.

Despite  the  hit  record,  which  became  a  million  seller,  he
still couldn’t interest any record company in recording him for a
pop  album.  So  he  took  all  his  earnings  from  the  success  of
“Splish Splash” and made the album himself. One of the songs
he  recorded  was  his  version  of  an  old  Kurt  Weill  song  called
“Mack  the  Knife.”  Not  only  was  his  album  a  smash  hit,  but
“Mack the Knife” became a multimillion-selling single through-
out the world. Bobby Darin went on to be known not for “Splish
Splash” but for the music he loved best—popular jazz oldies.

Lessons from Bobby Darin
There are many lessons to be learned from this one example.
First, realize that often you must go with the established way
of doing things in order to accomplish your goals. You’ve got
to pattern yourself after what is working and then harmonize
with  the  marketplace.  Once  you  have  an  established  reputa-
tion,  it’s  easier  to  try  something  different  that  you  yourself
want to do.

So ﬁrst you meet the needs of the market to raise the capital
you need and then you go for your dreams. Once you’ve raised
your own funds, you can do anything you want. You can pursue
a course of action that nobody else would believe possible.

I  also  use  the  Bobby  Darin  example  to  convince  people
who come to me with a concept or idea that seems really too far
out of the mainstream that they have to harmonize with the mar-
ketplace. In some cases, their product needs a slightly different
twist to work, even though that is not what they envisioned for
the product. The change usually involves removing a component
or making the product cheaper or presenting it in a totally new
and simple way. Let me cite one perfect example.

It was 1973 and the president and national sales manager of
a calculator company, APF, came to me with their new product.
They were all excited about it and felt that they had the greatest
and most exciting breakthrough in electronics since the calcula-
tor was invented.

159

U N D E R S T A N D I N G   W H A T   W O R K S

So conﬁdent were they that they were willing to pay for the
cost of my test ad. “Joe, this product is so hot that you’ll sell mil-
lions,” said the president of the company.

At the time, prices were still quite high for calculators, so
$69.95 was a very attractive price back then for a good desk cal-
culator with a large display. APF had sold their calculators suc-
cessfully at $69.95 but felt that with their latest innovation, they
had the ultimate product for my company—truly a revolution in
electronics (or so they thought).

“What’s the innovation?” I asked. The company president
and his national sales manager unwrapped a special box to show
me their prototype.

The calculator was the same calculator they had been sell-
ing for the past year but with a new feature—a clock that ran in
the  calculator  display  when  the  calculator  wasn’t  being  used.
“What do you think?” the president beamed. “We plan on selling
this for $99.95.”

I didn’t like the idea. I explained that the consumer felt that
a calculator was a serious business tool, turned on when it was
needed and turned it off when it was not. I had been selling them
for almost two years and had a pretty good sense of the product
and  its  emotional  appeal.  Putting  a  clock  into  the  display  and
keeping the calculator on all the time was not in harmony with
what would impress the consumer and therefore it would not be
successful. Increasing the price was a mistake. If I had a choice,
I would have offered the product for less, or about $39.95, in or-
der to get rid of their inventory. I just felt that it wouldn’t sell.

The company president didn’t believe me. “What?” he blurted
out. “It costs more to make than the standard model and it’s so rev-
olutionary—why should we even consider selling it for less?”

I  agreed  to  write  an  ad  to  prove  my  point.  “I  will  write  a
great ad and let you approve it. I will then run the ad in the Wall
Street Journal. We’ll measure the response and if it’s successful,
we’ll create a nice advertising campaign for you.”

I sent APF the ad and they loved it. “If this doesn’t work,
I’m  getting  out  of  the  calculator  business,”  said  the  president.
And so I ran the ad.

It  failed  miserably.  The  product  was  closed  out  at  $39.95

160

T H E   P S Y C H O L O G I C A L   T R I G G E R S

shortly thereafter. When you are not in harmony with the market,
the marketplace doesn’t respond. Taking a product and making it
harmonize with the prospect is simply a matter of good listening
and observation. It doesn’t take genius. It takes a good eye and
ear, and a little intuition helps, too.

It is important that your product harmonize with or ﬁll the
needs of your prospect. If it doesn’t, it is up to you to ﬁgure out
how to change it so it does. It might mean showing it in a differ-
ent color, removing or adding an accessory—the point is that the
customer is the king. Your goal is to harmonize not only with the
marketplace but in particular with your customer.

17. Desire to Belong

The desire to belong is a strong motivational factor in marketing
but it is often not appreciated. Think about it.

Why  do  people  own  a  Mercedes?  Why  do  they  smoke
Marlboro cigarettes? Why do certain fads catch on? It could be
that  these  people  buy  a  speciﬁc  product  because  they  subcon-
sciously want to belong to the group that already owns or uses
that speciﬁc product.

In the case of Marlboros, the smokers subconsciously want
to join that group of smokers who have responded to the rugged
western image the cigarette’s ad agency has created.

The  people  who  buy  a  Mercedes  often  want  to  belong  to
that  special  group  of  Mercedes  owners.  Do  you  think  it’s  be-
cause  of  the  special  braking  or  suspension  system?  Forget  it.
They’re  going  out  and  spending  megabucks  to  buy  something
that’s maybe slightly better than many of the other automobiles.
The other cars can take you to the same places at the same speed
and  yet  these  people—all  very  intelligent—will  go  out  and
spend plenty more to buy a Mercedes.

And the list goes on. You name a product that has an estab-
lished image and I’ll show you a consumer who, somewhere in
his  or  her  subconscious  value  system,  wants  to  belong  to  the
group  of  people  who  own  that  product.  Fashion,  automobiles,
cigarettes,  gadgets,  whatever  the  category—the  consumer  who
buys  a  speciﬁc  brand  has  been  motivated  to  buy  that  brand  by

161

U N D E R S T A N D I N G   W H A T   W O R K S

virtue of the desire to belong to the group of people who already
own that brand.

When Volvo  discovered  that  its  customer  base  had  one  of
the  highest  educational  levels  of  any  of  the  car  manufacturers,
they publicized this fact. They then noticed that when the same
survey was conducted a few years later, the percentage jumped
even higher. The increase was caused, in my judgment, by the as-
sociation that other highly educated new buyers wanted to make
with the Volvo owners—they wanted to belong to that group.

Some students have said to me, “Well, what about hermits?

Don’t tell me they have the desire to belong.”

And  my  answer  has  been  that  they  want  to  belong  to  the
group  of  people  who  are  hermits.  To  identify  with  the  group
doesn’t necessarily mean you have to be with anyone or be very
social. And maybe the key word here is identify. The Mercedes
owner wants to be identiﬁed with the class or group of people
who also own a Mercedes.

Owning a Rolls-Royce in California in the 1970s was the ul-
timate  status  symbol.  I  couldn’t  believe  how  impressed  people
were with other people who owned one. Being a Midwestern boy
and not having grown up on the car-conscious West Coast, it was
culture  shock  to  realize  how  much  a  Rolls  meant  to  somebody
from the West Coast. Yet when you look at the car, it is one of the
most conservative and old-fashioned-looking automobiles on the
road today.

The desire to belong to and identify with a group of people
who own a speciﬁc product is one of the most powerful psycho-
logical motivators to be aware of in marketing and copywriting.
But one of the best examples I can give was a personal experi-
ence, which leads me to my next psychological point.

18. Desire to Collect

There must be a natural instinct in the human race to collect, as I
learned from my marketing experience.

If you are selling a collectible, it’s pretty easy to understand
that this urge exists and therefore, as a direct marketer, you need

162

T H E   P S Y C H O L O G I C A L   T R I G G E R S

to capitalize on it. But often overlooked is the fact that it can
be  used  to  sell  any  other  product,  too.  Let’s  take  the  watch
buyer. An enthusiastic watch buyer is your perfect prospect for
another watch.

When I was selling watches in print, I would send mailings
to those customers who had previously ordered from me and of-
fer them other watches. I received a great response. My best list
for  watches  consisted  of  my  existing  watch  owners.  Now  you
would think that if you had a watch, what would you need an-
other  one  for?  Wrong.  Many  people  actually  collect  them.
They’ll  have  several  watches,  several  pairs  of  sunglasses,  sev-
eral pairs of jeans, a library of videos or compact disks. The list
is endless.

I’m  always  amazed  at  the  number  of  dolls  collected  by
QVC viewers. Some of the viewers are older women, long past
childhood,  yet  among  QVC’s  most  avid  collectors.  And  they
have dozens of dolls.

Small  car  models  are  also  sold  on
QVC. They are some of the most popular
products.  And  not  to  be  outdone,  there
must be thousands of viewers who own
many  BluBlocker  sunglasses—often  in
several different styles.

The point is, when selling, whether
in print or on TV or the Internet, recog-
nize that there is a very large segment of
the population who, for whatever reason,
has an emotional need to collect a series
of similar products. These products bring great joy and satisfac-
tion and in some cases utility.

And think about those who collect the real cars. Many who
can  afford  them  have  collections  that  range  up  to  hundreds  of
full-sized  automobiles.  What  kind  of  emotional  need  are  they
fulﬁlling?

One of the ways that direct marketers optimize on the col-
lecting instinct is by sending, free of charge with their very ﬁrst
shipment, some sort of device to hold the collection.

I can remember ordering a series of silver airplane tails with

You’d be amazed
at what people
collect.

163

U N D E R S T A N D I N G   W H A T   W O R K S

various  airline  logos  embossed  on  them  from  the  Franklin  Mint.
I started collecting them to see how the Franklin Mint conducted its
program rather than from any interest in collecting airplane tails.

I received a beautiful chest with cutouts for each of the sil-
ver tails. And they came once a month and each month I put one
more tail in the chest. I looked at my collection each time I put in
a new tail and felt the pride of knowing that my tail collection
was growing. Finally, I had enough to ﬁll the chest so that when
guests came over, I could display my entire tail collection. I ﬁ-
nally  sobered  up  and  stopped  collecting.  It  was  costing  me  a
small  fortune,  and  after  all,  the  only  reason  I  had  started  was
for  the  research. And  the  collection  was  kind  of  silly  to  begin
with.  The  airlines  were  either  merging,  going  out  of  business
or  changing  their  names  so  fast  that  even  the  Franklin  Mint
couldn’t keep up.

But  it  was  this  experience  that  convinced  me  that  there

were lots of opportunities for selling to collectors.

19. Curiosity

If I had to pick the one major psychological reason that makes
direct marketing so successful today, it would be curiosity. At re-
tail, a customer can touch and experience the product ﬁrst-hand
and then decide. A mail order customer can’t do that. The prod-
uct might look good and do exactly what the customer expects it
to do, yet there is always that level of curiosity that makes the
product  attractive  to  the  prospect.  “What  is  that  product  really
like?” might be the typical thought of a prospect.

When  I  sold  BluBlocker  sunglasses  on  TV,  I  deliberately
created an enormous amount of curiosity. I had my subjects—or-
dinary  people  we  would  ﬁnd  on  the  streets—try  on  a  pair  of
BluBlocker  sunglasses.  I  would  then  videotape  their  reactions.
Some  of  the  reactions  were  great  and  when  I  presented  them
on TV, the viewers were wondering, “What was it like to look
through  these  glasses—that  pair  of  sunglasses  with  the  orange
lenses that was making everybody go wild?”

I didn’t take the TV camera and look through a pair. That
would have destroyed the curiosity and would not have given

164

T H E   P S Y C H O L O G I C A L   T R I G G E R S

the  true  picture  of  what  the  sunglasses  would  do  for  you.
(Your  brain  adjusts  to  the  color  shift  when  you  look  through
the  lens,  whereas  the  TV camera  does  not.)  Instead,  I  en-
hanced curiosity by not showing the view. The only way you
could look through them was to buy a pair. And buy the public
did—almost 8 million pairs from a series of commercials that
ran for six years.

Curiosity  also  works  well  with  books.  You  can  tease
prospects by telling them what they will ﬁnd out by reading your
books. In fact, the strongest motivating factor in selling books is
curiosity, followed only by notoriety and credibility.

Because a prospect can’t touch or experience the product, cu-
riosity is the strongest motivating factor in mail order. Immediate
gratiﬁcation is the strongest factor in retail. So if I recognize that
fact  and  can  deliver  your  product  promptly—let’s  say  with
FedEx—I’m capitalizing on the curiosity in mail order and com-
ing close to the retail advantage.

I’ve  sold  products  relying  completely  on  the  factor  of  cu-
riosity. In 1973 I offered a pocket calculator without ever show-
ing a picture of it. By creating such compelling curiosity about
that product, I sold thousands of them. Sure the price was good
and the product was great, but without showing the product or
even  mentioning  the  brand  name,  I  was  still  able  to  make  the
selling message very compelling.

How do you use curiosity in selling your products? First re-
alize  that  when  you  sell  books,  curiosity  is  the  key  motivating
factor and you should use it as your prime selling tool. But real-
ize also that there are many other products that lend themselves
to holding back part of the story in order to arouse curiosity and
create a demand.

Show  too  much,  tell  too  much,  and  you  run  the  risk  of
killing  whatever  advantage  you  have  using  mail  order  as  a
medium.

A friend of mine, Steve Dworman, who publishes an info-
mercial trade newsletter, was fascinated by my success using cu-
riosity  as  the  main  selling  tool  in  my  BluBlocker  commercial.
He thought to himself, “Could the same technique be used to sell
something that was impossible to sell on TV in a direct response

165

U N D E R S T A N D I N G   W H A T   W O R K S

commercial? Like perfume?” So he organized the shooting of a
commercial using curiosity as its main motivating factor.

In  the  commercial,  everybody  was  raving  about  the  per-
fume but there was no way the TV sets allowed viewers to sniff
it unless they bought Steve’s product. The commercial generated
enough curiosity to work.

How many times have you said too much, shown too much
or failed to use the power of curiosity? It is one of the leading
motivating factors in all direct response marketing.

20. Sense of Urgency

You might have already ﬁgured this one out. You’ve almost sold
the prospect. The prospect believes in your product and is ready
to buy. But like many of your customers, this one says, “Well, let
me think about it.”

It is a proven fact that when this happens, chances are the
prospect won’t buy. And the reasons are really very logical. First,
in time that excellent sales message you wrote will most likely be
forgotten. Second, if you’re lucky and it isn’t forgotten, it won’t
have the same impact it had when it was ﬁrst read. That old say-
ing, “Out of sight, out of mind,” holds true in a case like this.

Therefore, to avoid the delaying tactic, you’ve got to pro-
vide prospects with an incentive or reason to buy now. In fact, if
you do your job right, customers have to feel guilty if they don’t
buy right now. But how do you do it?

First,  here’s  what  you  don’t  want  to  do. The  prospect  has
spent a lot of time with your ad and you’ve convinced him or her
to buy. The one thing you don’t want to do is blow your integrity
at the very end of the ad by making a statement that is not true. A
statement like, “If you don’t respond within the next few days,
we’ll  be  sold  out,”  or  some  other  deceit  will  turn  off  the
prospect. So be careful. Whatever you say at the end should be
the  truth  and  should  be  crafted  to  maintain  the  same  integrity
that has been expressed throughout your ad.

Now, what can you do to provide a sense of urgency? Some
ads reek with a sense of urgency and nothing has to be said. For

166

T H E   P S Y C H O L O G I C A L   T R I G G E R S

example, I once ran a retraction for an ad that said that the price
listed for a calculator was the wrong price and that the new price
was $20 higher, but you had a few days to purchase the product
at the old price before the new price went into effect. That ap-
proach was an integral part of the concept and provided a sense
of urgency that was obvious and very real.

You can also convey a sense of urgency by offering limited
editions. “We have only 1,000 sets and this will be our last ad-
vertisement”  can  be  persuasive  and  motivate  the  buyer  to  act
right away.

You might have a great ad with a good sense of urgency but
a fatal error might still kill your ad’s effectiveness. What is that
fatal error? Omitting important information that the buyer needs
in order to make that buying decision. Then the buyer has the ex-
cuse, “There’s a question I have but I’m too busy to call and ﬁnd
out the answer,” or a similar reason. In short, even a great sense
of urgency can be wasted if you leave out some critical informa-
tion from your ad copy.

You can use the sense of urgency in many different ways—
low supplies, closeout opportunity, price rise, product shortages,
limited-time  price  opportunity  or  limited-edition  opportunity.
How about “Buy now so you can start enjoying the beneﬁts of
my product tomorrow.” Or even “Buy one during the next three
days and you’ll get a second one free.”

Another way to provide a sense of urgency is through your
shipping methods. “We’ll ship your purchase via FedEx if you
order  by  (a  certain  date).”  Or  “Since  you  are  one  of  our  cus-
tomers, you can buy this wonderful product prior to our national
introduction if you order by (a certain date).”

We used to run all our new product introductions with the
phrase,  “National  Introductory  Price.”  This  didn’t  mean  that
much but it raised the possibility that the price was the introduc-
tory price and later might go up. In actuality, the prices of calcu-
lators  and  electronics  always  went  down,  so  we  eventually
dropped that phrase.

The number of possibilities is limited only by your imagi-
nation. The sense-of-urgency statements always go at the end of
your advertising. And if there are two critical locations in your

167

U N D E R S T A N D I N G   W H A T   W O R K S

advertising, they are the very beginning and the very end. And it
is at the end where the sense of urgency and several other impor-
tant  concepts  meet  and  must  be  considered  and  blended  seam-
lessly together.

21. Fear

Fear is one of the great motivators that will cause us to take ac-
tion.  Give  a  person  a  reason  to  act  based  on  the  fact  that  they
may lose the opportunity to buy something and they will usually
act in a positive way toward your offer. As just discussed, sense
of urgency is an important psychological trigger.

A part of the sense of urgency is based on fear. Your cus-
tomer fears that he or she will lose out on the opportunity of buy-
ing  a  product  or  service  because  it  won’t  be  available  in  the
future or it won’t be available at the same price. But fear can be a
motivating factor in other situations as well.

For example, when a new ﬂu virus or strain threatens, this
would be an opportunity to sell products that build the immune
system or products that may help prevent the disease. People are
buying these products because they want to protect themselves
from  the  virus,  which  today  is  a  real  and  present  danger. They
fear  the  consequences  if  they  don’t  buy  something  to  protect
themselves. Even though it is easier to sell something that cures
a disease than it is to sell a preventive, this rule is often violated
when fear is a major factor.

Fear of Crime
Another  example  is  the  purchase  of  a  burglar  alarm  or  even  a
gun. There might be an outbreak of crime in a certain city and
residents who are fearful they might be attacked or robbed will
take action to protect themselves and their homes.

There are products that play to our fear of aging. Creams,
lotions and pills offering a fountain of youth are bought because
people fear the aging process and are concerned about what oth-
ers think of their looks.

It is common to hear of people who take action and show ir-
rational  behavior  based  on  their  fears.  The  stock  market  is  a

168

T H E   P S Y C H O L O G I C A L   T R I G G E R S

good example of irrational behavior when it comes to a person’s
fear of losing money. When the market crashes and is near the
bottom of what is called a bear cycle and the economy looks ex-
tremely  grim,  consumers  start  dumping  stocks  fearing  that  the
market will continue to collapse and they will lose more money.
In reality, this usually is the best time to buy stocks. Or when the
viability of the dollar is questioned, many investors, out of fear,
protect themselves and buy gold coins or hoard cash.

Fear can be a great motivator if used carefully in response

to some perceived danger or loss that one might have to face.

22. Instant Gratiﬁcation

This  is  a  big  advantage  at  retail.  Think  about  it. At  retail,  you
pick something up, hold it, touch it and look it over completely.
You  can  make  your  decision  to  buy  and  then  you  can  take  it
home with you where you can enjoy and use it immediately. You
don’t have that advantage in mail order.

So to compensate, you should convey to your customer ei-
ther the advantages in ordering from you via mail or the assur-
ance that you ship promptly and that the customer will have his
or her purchase within a few days.

The effort by direct marketers to provide that instant gratiﬁ-
cation—shipping  promptly—has  made  mail  order  one  of  the
fastest methods of distribution in the United States and has thus
taken a great deal away from the retail industry. I can call a com-
puter mail order company and order a piece of software on Mon-
day  morning  and  use  it  by  Monday  evening.  That’s  so  much
easier than running to the store, parking, ﬁnding the right depart-
ment and then having to deal with the salesclerk. It’s no wonder
direct marketing has taken a dramatic bite out of many of the tra-
ditional retail categories.

The  mail  order  computer  industry  created  giants  such  as
Dell Inc. and Gateway 2000 that specialize in next-day delivery.
And  so  if  you  have  a  product  and  want  to  capitalize  on
the main advantage that a retailer has, ﬁnd a way to ship your
merchandise out quicker, deliver it faster and provide better ser-
vice than any retailer could ever offer.

23. Exclusivity, Rarity or Uniqueness

These are very strong motivating factors for the right product or
the right situation.

The  concept  is  to  basically  let  prospects  feel  that  they  are
special if they buy a particular product—that they will belong to
the very small group that can be envied for owning this very lim-
ited item.

The  emotional  appeal  of  this  approach  is  quite  strong.
Everybody likes to feel special. Most people would like to be-
long  to  a  rare  group  that  owns  a  product  that  few  people  can
own and enjoy.

By limiting the number they produce, some marketing com-
panies have come up with a very strong appeal for consumers.
The  Franklin  Mint—a  multimillion-dollar  business—was  built
on  the  premise  of  the  limited  edition,  ﬁrst  with  coins  and  then
later  with  everything  from  plates  and  cups  to  model  cars  and
dolls. Anything you could collect and they could limit was fair
game for the Mint.

The  thought  behind  the  limited  edition  is  also  to  provide
value. As people build various collections of things, the objects
grow in value if others start collecting the same goods too. Soon,
the collections come to the attention of the mass market and that
attracts more collectors. Then the value of the collections really
starts to grow.

Those collectibles that have a limited circulation or a lim-
ited number in circulation grow in value even more. And there’s
always the story of somebody discovering an heirloom in the at-
tic worth a small fortune. There are exceptions, of course—silver
airplane tails, to name one.

One of the appeals of an exclusive item is the possibility of
extra  future  value  implied  by  limiting  the  circulation  of  that
product.

The power of exclusivity was driven home to me in Octo-
ber of 1980 when I was in Minocqua, Wisconsin. It was right af-
ter I had given a seminar.

170

T H E   P S Y C H O L O G I C A L   T R I G G E R S

At  the  seminar  site,  for  the  enjoyment  of  the  participants,
I  kept  a  stable  of  six  snowmobiles.  Whenever  I  would  give  a
seminar  during  the  winter,  I  would  have  these  machines  avail-
able  for  my  students  during  their  breaks.  Riding  snowmobiles
was a lot of fun and everybody loved to drive them. Then one
day the president of Mattel Electronics, Jeff Rochlis, broke his
arm in a bad snowmobile accident. That ended our snowmobile
program.

I  now  had  six  snowmobiles  in  my  garage  with  not  many
people to use them. Out of curiosity, one day I visited the local
snowmobile shop—the same place that had sold me the six that I
owned.  I  obviously  didn’t  need  any  more  but  I  wanted  to  see
what small improvements were added in the new models.

I walked into the shop and asked the salesman, “Well, Paul,

what’s new for this year?”

Paul took me over to a snowmobile that was propped up on
a small riser and pointed to it. “This baby is our new oil-cooled
model that goes over 100 miles per hour and sells for $2,600.”

At the time, snowmobiles were selling for under $1,000 and
their top speed was around 40 miles per hour so this new model
was obviously special. But regardless of how special it was, I al-
ready had six and I certainly did not need any more. I turned to
Paul and in a matter-of-fact way said, “Who could possibly want
a snowmobile that could go 100 miles per hour and cost $2,600?
How ridiculous.”

Paul chuckled, “Well, there are only going to be six sold in
the entire state this year. We’ve been allocated only two of them
and we already have one sold.”

I then quickly blurted out, “I’ll take this one.” Yes, I ended
up  buying  it.  I  wanted  to  be  one  of  the  few  who  owned  this
powerful  new  machine.  I  wanted  to  feel  that  I  was  part  of  a
unique group and that I was special. And even though I didn’t
need  any  more  snowmobiles,  I  ended  up  buying  it  and  I  was
proud of the fact that I did.

It  was  this  incident  that  made  me  realize  the  power  of

exclusivity, uniqueness and rarity.

24. Simplicity

You must keep your advertising copy simple. The positioning of
your  product  must  be  simple.  Your  offer  must  be  simple.
In short, you want to keep your entire presentation as simple as
possible while still getting across your message.

There  are  times  when  you  want  to  turn  something  simple
into  something  complex.  We  talked  about  that  in  the  previous
chapter under the topic “Product Explanation.” But that rule ap-
plies  to  marketing  issues,  and  here  we  are  looking  at  the  basic
psychological motivator of simplicity.

What does this mean in terms of your advertising copy? I
like to tell my students to focus. Focus on what you are trying
to  accomplish  and  eliminate  things  that  either  complicate  your
presentation or aren’t necessary.

This doesn’t mean you write copy that is so simple a third
grader can read it. That’s not what we mean by simple. The copy
should be able to be read by the less educated people as well as
the more educated and come across clearly. It is not good style to
write either “up” or “down” to anybody.

The use of big words to impress is one example of writing
up  to  somebody.  You’re  trying  to  impress  with  your  use  of
words  while  somebody  else  who  might  not  be  familiar  with
your  fancy  words  will  be  lost.  Use  simple  easy-to-understand
words.  Words  are,  after  all,  stories—emotional  images—each
having an impact sometimes greater than we think. Using sim-
ple words has the greatest impact. Using words that everybody
can understand has a greater impact than words that most peo-
ple have difﬁculty with.

And  keep  your  layouts  simple.  Tests  have  conﬁrmed  that
things like color bars across an ad, fancy type that is difﬁcult to
read and lines that draw your eyes away from the copy can hurt
comprehension. Fancy typefaces may look good but they often
give the lowest comprehension scores.

Simplicity Is a Powerful Tool
If you have a tendency to complicate things, you’re not going to
succeed  in  writing  good  direct  response  advertising  copy.  Be
aware  of  this  important  point  as  you  decide  which  typeface  to

172

T H E   P S Y C H O L O G I C A L   T R I G G E R S

use,  how  you  want  to  present  your  product  and  the  offer  you
want to make.

A good example of how simplicity works in direct response
happened to me when Murray Raphel, a dear friend and a great
public speaker, approached me. He had been in touch with the
people who had developed the Swiss Army watch and wondered
if I would be interested in marketing the product in the United
States. Yes, I was. A meeting was arranged in which I was going
to see the line of watches.

At the meeting I was presented with three styles and three
colors  in  each  style  for  a  total  of  nine  different  watches.  One
was a men’s style, the second was for women and the third was
for children. The colors were black, red and khaki. I examined
the  watches,  learned  the  history  and  in  general  became  very
knowledgeable  about  the  watches  themselves.  Then  came  the
big question.

“Mr.  Sugarman,  you’ve  examined  the  watches.  What  do

you think?”

I  looked  over  the  watches,  thought  for  a  few  minutes  and
answered,  “I’d  like  to  run  just  the  men’s  watch  in  black  in  the
Wall Street Journal to test the concept.”

The  watch  company  executives  looked  perplexed.  “Why
don’t  you  offer  all  the  styles?  Look  at  how  many  more  people
you’ll  reach  if  you  offer  nine  different  styles.  You’ll  reach
women and children in addition to men and you’ll give them all
a color choice.”

I told them that in my experience, keeping it simple was the
best approach and that offering a customer too many choices was
a very dangerous thing to do.

But  no  matter  what  I  said,  they  would  not  agree.  “Logic
says, Mr. Sugarman, that offering more of a choice will result in
more sales.”

I then came up with an idea to prove that I was right. I of-
fered  to  run  two  separate  ads  in  what  is  called  an  “A/B  split.”
That is where the Wall Street Journal will print two separate ver-
sions of the same ad—version A and version B—to be delivered
in the same area at the same time. So one home will get one ver-
sion of the ad while the next-door neighbor might get version B.

173

U N D E R S T A N D I N G   W H A T   W O R K S

This was a very good way to test two different ads to
determine the winning approach.

I offered to do the test and ran the two ads with
almost  identical  copy  and  graphics.  One  of  the  few
differences  was  that  in  ad  A,  I  showed  the  men’s
watch along with the child’s watch for size perspec-
tive, whereas in ad B, I showed just the men’s watch.
I then listed each one of the choices—nine in all—in
ad A and just one in ad B.

When  I  ﬁnished  the  ads,  the A version  actually
looked  better  than  the  version  with  only  one  choice.
When both versions ran, the ad that featured only one
men’s watch outpulled the other version that featured
nine models by a surprising 3 to 1 ratio. In short, for
every watch we sold from the ad that featured the nine
styles, we sold three in the other ad that showed just
the one black watch.

I knew almost instinctively that to give the con-
sumer  a  confusing  array  of  choices  meant  that  the
consumer would back off and not buy.

When  would  I  show  all  these  nine  watches?
Later, in my catalog. Once I’ve located those people
interested  in  Swiss  Army  watches,  I  would  then
show  them  all  nine  models  in  the  catalog.  By  the
time the catalog reaches my customer, he or she has
been  qualiﬁed  as  a  watch  buyer.  I  can  now  offer  a
larger selection.

Another good example of the power of simplicity
occurred  during  the  production  of  a  half-hour  TV
commercial I was doing for a pill that reduced wrin-
kles and improved the skin. Called Miracell, the prod-
uct was truly revolutionary. I had been taking it for a
few  months  and  noticed  dramatic  results.  We  did  two  double-
blind  studies  that  proved  that  the  product  really  did  work.  But
there was one major problem.

For  maximum  effectiveness,  you  had  to  take  two  pills  a
day for the ﬁrst three months and then reduce the intake to one
pill a day.

These two ads were
practically identical
with ad A (top)
offering nine
different models
and ad B (bottom)
offering only one.

174

T H E   P S Y C H O L O G I C A L   T R I G G E R S

This  violated  my  principles  of  simplicity  and  I  was  very
concerned  that  the  consumer  was  going  to  be  confused.  You
make it easy initially to buy a continuity product and then later
you raise the price. For example, the ﬁrst video in a video series
offered on TV may cost only $5. It is a simple offer and it isn’t
very expensive. You then buy the video and to get the rest of the
series,  you  must  pay  $19.95  a  month  to  receive  a  video  each
month for the next 12 months.

I was going the opposite way. For the ﬁrst three months,
pills would cost double what they would cost during the fourth
month and beyond. And here I was recommending taking two
pills a day for three months and then one pill a day for the rest
of  the  time.  Prospects  might  ﬁnd  it  really  confusing  and  hold
off buying.

So  I  did  two  things  to  ensure  the  success  of  this  show,
which we had already spent hundreds of thousands of dollars
to  prepare. The  ﬁrst  was  to  have  the  host  in  the  show  verify
the dosage and tell how the program worked even after I had
explained  it.  We  devoted  almost  three  minutes  to  explain-
ing  the  complicated  offer  in  order  to  answer  all  anticipated
questions.

But  somehow  I  knew  that  the  ﬁrst  offer  was  too  compli-
cated. And so I prepared an alternative offer just in case. For the
second version I shot additional footage with just a simple offer:
“Miracell costs $25 a box and a box lasts one month.” That was
it. It was very simple and very easy to understand. I knew that I
would have to supply my customers with a double dose for the
ﬁrst three months, so three boxes would be at my own expense if
this  second  version  of  the  ad  worked  and  the  complicated  ﬁrst
version did not.

Sure  enough,  after  testing,  the  version  that  worked  was
the simple one; it outpulled the ﬁrst one by a very large mar-
gin. We ended up giving away an enormous amount of product
in order to keep the offer simple and make the program simple
as well.

Simplicity in direct response is critical and quite necessary.
These are just two typical experiences from my many years of
direct response marketing in various media.

25. Human Relationships

It is always important to relate the product or service you are of-
fering in human terms. How the product will ﬁt, how it will feel,
how it will look—these are just some of the ways you can relate.
That may seem pretty obvious.

But there are other ways that copy or graphics can bring a
human element to an advertisement. And let’s look at why this is
important.

Buying  is  an  emotional  human  experience  when  we  ex-
change our hard-earned money for a product or service. And be-
cause  we  worked  hard  for  that  money,  the  act  of  buying
represents  more  than  just  handing  over  our  money.  Buying
something becomes an emotional event.

Resonating with Your Prospect
Now let’s consider for a moment a physical device—speciﬁcally a
tuning fork. I’m talking about the ones that look like a U-shaped
piece of metal. Clang one of the metal tines and you hear a vibra-
tion. Take two tuning forks and if they are of the same frequency
and you hit just one, the other one will start vibrating even though
it did not come into physical contact with the ﬁrst one.

Taking this experiment one step further, if you take several
tuning  forks  and  put  them  together  and  hit  them  all,  they  will
create a harmonic frequency all their own. And if you just hap-
pen to know what that combined frequency is and have a tuning
fork that matches that frequency, then, it too, will start to vibrate
in resonance with all the other tuning forks.

In  creating  a  direct  response  advertisement,  it  is  important
that you create a condition where your customer is in perfect har-
monic resonance with your copy. We talked earlier in this book
about  getting  the  prospect  to  start  nodding  his  or  her  head  in
agreement until the close. And the close becomes easier because
the prospect is already nodding yes in agreement. It then becomes
easier to say yes when that ﬁnal question is posed: “May I have
your order?”

If you look at all the elements of an advertisement as a se-
ries of tuning forks that must resonate with your reader, you’ve

176

T H E   P S Y C H O L O G I C A L   T R I G G E R S

got a valuable picture of the dynamics that take place during the
selling process.

One tuning fork might be the headline, another might be
the  picture,  another  might  be  the  caption,  and  on  to  the  ﬁrst
sentence and through the copy to the ﬁnal offer. In a print ad,
the  vibrations  must  be  conveyed  through  the  elements  in  the
advertisement.

In  order  to  create  these  positive  vibrations,  you  ﬁrst  must
interest the prospect in reading your copy and then you must re-
ally “tune in” and relate to your prospect.

You can add a human element by relating a story in your
copy. Stories hold people’s interest. This technique is the next
trigger discussed. Or you can use a byline and write copy in the
ﬁrst person using a conversational tone. This makes your copy
a  more  direct  communication  from  one  individual  to  another.
Using humor in a light, inoffensive way will also develop a re-
lationship with your prospect. The humor can relate a story in a
folksy  way  as  in  my  “Pet  Plane”  ad  in  Chapter  29  or  it  can
bring out the “humanness” of the person marketing the product
or service as I’ve done in my ad for the Magic Stat thermostat
in Chapter 28.

Another approach is to use a picture of a human hand hold-
ing a small product. The hand adds size and perspective to what
is being presented and also adds that human element.

You can use attractive models. People like to relate to pretty
women or handsome men even though they may not themselves
be attractive. In a subtle sense, they want to belong to the group
of  people  in  the  picture.  Conversely,  you  don’t  want  to  use  a
picture of yourself if you think some of your readers may re-
spond negatively to it. Especially if you look like a bearded vil-
lain from some B-rated movie.

In short, in your advertising you want to use as many posi-
tive human elements as you can without risking any negative vi-
brations from emotional reactions.

And if you do your job right, your advertisement will have
its own vibration—so much so that some people will be able to
pick up that vibration and feel that they almost know you.

177

26. Storytelling

People love stories, and one of the re-
ally  good  ways  to  relate  to  your
prospect is to tell a story. Just as a pic-
ture is worth a thousand words, a story
can be invaluable and often creates an
emotional  relationship  or  bond  that
keeps your prospect riveted and listen-
ing.  Stories  create  human  interest.  In
childhood,  stories  read  to  us  by  our
parents were the way we fantasized or
even  saw  the  world.  In  short,  we’ve

been primed for stories ever since we were very young.

Think  of  the  public  speaker  who  starts  his  speech  with  a
story or uses stories throughout his presentation. It makes for an
interesting presentation and often holds the interest of the audi-
ence.  In  fact,  very  often,  after  I’ve  been  listening  to  a  boring
speaker  and  my  mind  starts  to  wander,  I  become  alert  when  I
know a story is about to be told.

Stories Have Lessons to Teach
Stories usually have lessons to teach or experiences to share or
even endings that can excite, surprise or bring out emotion. And
so it is with good copy. If you tell a story in your copy that is rel-
evant either to selling your product, to creating the environment
for selling, or to getting the prospect to read your copy, you are
using this wonderful and powerful trigger in a very effective way
to sell your product or service.

Finally, some stories add a unique human element that al-
lows you to relate to and bond very closely with your prospects.
Kathy  Levine,  formerly  one  of  QVC’s  top  salespersons,
wrote in her book, It’s Better to Laugh (Pocket Books, 1995), “I
realized early on that selling is a matter of capturing people’s at-
tention and holding it with a good story.”

The  most  interesting  salespeople  I  know  always  have  a
story to tell. It is their way of relating to their customers and en-
tertaining them as well. One in particular has a repertoire of hun-

Telling a story is
a powerful tool to
create a bond
between you and
your prospects.

178

T H E   P S Y C H O L O G I C A L   T R I G G E R S

dreds of jokes—each targeted to his prospect, to the selling envi-
ronment and what he has to sell. As you can imagine, he is very
effective.

My most successful advertising campaigns all used stories
as  the  basis  for  my  presentation.  Here  is  one  example  of  this
technique from one of my most successful ads. I wrote an ad for
BluBlocker sunglasses that will give you a ﬂavor of how a story
can  be  very  helpful  in  creating  human  interest  that  will  cause
your prospects to read your entire message.

Headline: Vision Breakthrough
Subheadline: When  I  put  on  the  pair  of  glasses  what  I  saw  I
could not believe. Nor will you.
Byline: By Joseph Sugarman
Copy: I am about to tell you a true story. If you believe me, you
will  be  well  rewarded.  If  you  don’t  believe  me,  I  will  make  it
worth your while to change your mind. Let me explain.
Len is a friend of mine who knows good products. One day he
called  excited  about  a  pair  of  sunglasses  he  owned.  “It’s  so  in-
credible,” he said, “when you ﬁrst look through a pair, you won’t
believe it.”
“What will I see?” I asked. “What could be so incredible?”
Len continued, “When you put on these glasses, your vision im-
proves.  Objects  appear  sharper,  more  deﬁned.  Everything  takes
on  an  enhanced  3-D  effect. And  it’s  not  my  imagination.  I  just
want you to see for yourself.”

The  story  continues  as  I  personally  look  through  the  sun-
glasses and learn more about them from Len. It uses a conversa-
tional  tone,  but  still  covers  all  the  important  points  about  the
sunglasses,  the  danger  from  ultraviolet  (UV)  rays,  and  the  ad-
vantage of screening out blue spectrum light rays. A story is used
very effectively to build curiosity and cause the reader to read all
the copy, and eventually to read the ﬁnal sales pitch.

That ad for BluBlocker sunglasses launched a multimillion-
dollar  company  that  eventually  sold  20  million  pairs  of  sun-
glasses and has recently celebrated 20 years in business.

When  writing  copy  for  your  product,  think  about  using  a
few stories that might be of interest to your prospect and assist in
the  sale  of  your  product:  stories  about  a  new  development  and

179

U N D E R S T A N D I N G   W H A T   W O R K S

how you discovered it—stories about yourself that would be of
interest to your prospects.

Timing  is  also  important  in  the  storytelling  process.  It  is
nice to start with a story, because it holds attention and engages
the prospect. Telling stories is an art form and using it effectively
in a print ad grows with experience. Simply being aware of its
potential and its effectiveness is a good start. You’ll be surprised
at how many stories you’ll be able to come up with once you put
your mind to it.

A good story should capture a person’s attention, relate the
product  or  service  in  the  copy  and  help  you  bond  with  the
prospect.

27. Mental Engagement

Have you ever gone to a movie and known how it was going to
end  after  watching  the  ﬁrst  few  minutes?  Or  a  movie  where
every action can be easily anticipated? These movies tend not to
be very enjoyable.

However, the opposite is true when you watch a movie that
keeps you in suspense until the very end when it reaches a credi-
ble  but  surprise  ending.  Any  movie  that  is  not  predictable  is
more enjoyable. I recently saw a movie called Inside Man about
what I thought was a bank robbery but turned out to be what I
least  expected. And  the  identity  of  the  robbers  was  also  a  sur-
prise at the end of the movie. I loved that ﬁlm.

What forces in our minds make us perceive one movie as a

lot better than another?

I have a theory that I strongly believe comes pretty close to
the answer: The more the mind must work to reach a conclusion
that it eventually successfully reaches, the more positive, enjoy-
able, or stimulating the experience.

I taught this concept at my seminar for many years, and one
day one of my students brought me a copy of a media newsletter
that conﬁrmed what I had been teaching. The article claimed that
a  missing  element  was  responsible  for  advertising  failure—a
lack of whole-brain appeal.

180

T H E   P S Y C H O L O G I C A L   T R I G G E R S

It then went on to explain how science is rapidly discover-
ing that different parts of the brain perform different functions.
Some  brain  researchers  suggest  that  human  beings  experience
the most pleasure when all these parts of the brain are engaged in
agreeable levels of stimulation and activity.

The  four  brain  parts  discussed  were  those  that  control
thought, intuition, sensation, and emotion. The article suggested
that  advertising  that  pleasurably  engages  the  senses,  emotions,
and thought process, as well as our innate intuition, will tend to
be successful.

Advertising  that  merely  grabs  the  attention  of  the  senses
will tend to be only temporarily attractive. Most advertising tests
today reﬂect the power of day-after recall but fail to predict the
response from whole-brain advertising.

Let’s look at how whole-brain advertising applies to writing
effective advertising copy. If you make your copy too obvious,
the reader feels either looked down on or bored. Provide a little
suspense so that the reader has to come to a conclusion on her
own using intuition, thought, sensation, and emotion, and you’ve
got a very good force working for you. Let me cite an example
from an ad I wrote on digital watches.

The  ad  was  for  an  alarm  chronograph  digital  watch  for
which  we  were  charging  $99. At  the  time,  Seiko  was  the  stan-
dard of comparison for this type of watch. Seiko was the ﬁrst out
with the new technology. The following paragraph from the ad
best exempliﬁes what I’m talking about:

The  Seiko  chronograph  alarm  sells  for  $300.  The  watch  costs
jewelers  $150. And  jewelers  love  the  item,  not  only  because  of
the excellent reputation of the Seiko brand, but because it’s prob-
ably  America’s  best-selling  new  expensive  digital  watch.  And
Seiko can’t supply enough of them to their dealers.

Now, note what I didn’t say but what was still rather obvi-
ous.  Read  the  quote  again  to  see  if  you  pick  it  up.  Give  up?
What  I  didn’t  say  was  that  the  jewelers  were  making  a  small
fortune each time they sold a Seiko. I didn’t have to say it, yet
the  readers  could  come  to  their  own  conclusion  all  by  them-
selves using their intuition, thought, and emotions. Had I made

181

U N D E R S T A N D I N G   W H A T   W O R K S

it  too  obvious,  by  adding  the  line  “and  jewelers  are  making  a
small fortune,” it would not have been as powerful. The mind
had  to  work  a  little  to  reach  a  conclusion  through  its  own
thought  processes.  And  when  the  reader  compared  our  $99
watch  with  the  Seiko,  it  appeared  that  the  jewelry  stores  and
Seiko were soaking the consumer.

This is a very subtle but powerful concept. It’s the differ-
ence  between  talking  down  to  prospects  and  making  prospects
feel you are talking directly to them. And it is one of the most
difﬁcult theories to understand.

Working Hard Brings Appreciation
To get a better appreciation for the theory, think back in your
life to times when you had to work hard to achieve something
and how much more you appreciated what you achieved. I re-
member all the work I had to go through to get my instrument
rating  after  getting  my  private  pilot’s  license.  It  took  me
months  of  ﬂying  and  study,  not  to  mention  thousands  of
dollars in expense. When I ﬁnally received my instrument
rating, it was a thrill.

In  contrast,  when  I  took  my  commercial  rating  test,  it
was  simple.  Not  that  much  study,  very  little  ﬂying,  and
within a few weeks I had the rating. Sure, I was proud that I
was ﬁnally a commercial pilot, but nowhere near as proud as
I was of my instrument rating. Working hard for a successful
conclusion results in a great deal of personal satisfaction.

The  same  holds  true  for  the  mind  and  the  thinking
process.  Anything  that  causes  the  mind  to  work  hard  to
reach a conclusion creates a positive, enjoyable or stimu-
lating effect on the brain. The opposite is true if the mind
does not have to work because the conclusion is obvious.
You appreciate that sale to a difﬁcult client a lot more than a
sale that is a pushover and takes only a minute. When a very dif-
ﬁcult  product  is  given  to  me  to  sell  and  I  am  successful,  I  get
great pleasure from the achievement. But give me a really easy
product—something that is already in demand—and I don’t have
the same feeling of satisfaction.

Anything that
causes the mind
to work hard  to
reach a conclusion
creates a positive,
enjoyable or
stimulating effect
on the brain.

Vague Descriptions Encourage Thinking
When  Ernest  Hemingway  described  beautiful  women  in  his
books, he was never very speciﬁc. He used general terms and let
his readers imagine the women.

If you make your intentions too obvious, the prospect will
feel either patronized or bored. Make the prospect think in order
to come to a conclusion, and you create a very stimulating men-
tal effect.

Too  often  we  write  too  much. We  reveal  too  much  of  the
pitch  without  allowing  the  prospect’s  mind  and  intelligence  to
become  engaged.  Simply  realizing  how  this  powerful  psycho-
logical  trigger  works  will  help  you  craft  copy  that  causes  your
prospects’ brains  to  experience  an  enjoyable  and  stimulating
time by allowing them to reach—on their own—the conclusions
that you want them to reach.

28. Guilt

Have  you  ever  received  mailings  from  charities  that  include  a
small gift? The gifts are usually address stickers, colorful stamps
or  some  other  inexpensive  token.  Or  how  about  those  mailings
with surveys that include a dollar bill or a reply envelope with a
return  stamp?  In  both  cases  you  may  have  experienced  a  slight
touch of guilt. After all, you’ve received something of value and
you feel an obligation to take some action in return, such as send-
ing in a donation or answering the survey. These are good exam-
ples of the use of guilt. But how do you use this technique in a
print ad when you can’t include stickers or a dollar bill?

Many people have told me that after they read one of my
ads, they not only are compelled to buy my product, but would
feel guilty if they didn’t. Instead of giving them stickers or a dol-
lar bill, I give the reader plenty of compelling information and
reading entertainment—so much so that they sense an obligation
to respond. In a print ad, often the mere repetition of seeing an
ad in several magazines works to create a slight sense of guilt.
Repeated  mailings  also  create  guilt.  Keep  sending  some-
body mailings and after a while, they may feel guilty that they

183

U N D E R S T A N D I N G   W H A T   W O R K S

haven’t responded. I used this technique when I sold ski lifts for
a company called Ski Lift International. Each week I sent out a
small mailing with a premium gift enclosed. One mailing would
have a button, another an unusual mailing piece and still another
an involvement device. After a while, many of the recipients felt
guilty and responded. Some even apologized for not responding
earlier.

29. Speciﬁcity

Being speciﬁc in your explanations is very critical and can estab-
lish  your  credibility.  Let  me  ﬁrst  give  you  an  example.  If
I  were  to  say,  “New  dentists  everywhere  use  and  recommend
CapSnap Toothpaste,” it sounds like typical advertising lingo—
puffery  designed  to  sell  a  product.  It’s  so  general  that  it  will
probably  cause  a  viewer  to  discount  the  statement  I  have  just
made and maybe everything else I say. But if I said, “Ninety-two
percent  of  new  dentists  use  and  recommend  CapSnap  Tooth-
paste,” it sounds much more believable. The consumer is likely
to think that we did a scientiﬁc survey and that 92 percent was
the result.

When people perceive certain general statements as puffery
or  typical  advertising  babble,  those  statements  are  at  best  dis-
counted or accepted with some doubts. By contrast, statements
with  speciﬁc  facts  can  generate  strong  believability.  In  an  ad  I
once wrote for a collectibles company I created called Battram
Galleries, I stated the exact cost of running the ad and the exact
cost of the product. I clearly demonstrated through speciﬁc ﬁg-
ures that we weren’t making any proﬁt from the offering. It was
so successful, it was oversubscribed. I’ve used this technique on
video as well.

In my BluBlocker infomercials, I state the speciﬁc reasons
why  screening  out  blue  spectrum  light  rays  improves  your  vi-
sion.  I  explain  that  blue  light  rays  focus  in  front  of  the  retina
(which is the focusing screen of the eye) and not on the retina as
do  the  other  colors.  So  when  you  block  blue  light,  you  block
those rays that don’t focus on your retina and therefore objects
appear clearer, sharper and more deﬁned. I’m speciﬁc. It sounds

184

T H E   P S Y C H O L O G I C A L   T R I G G E R S

believable.  And  the  statement  is  a  lot  better  than  just  saying,
“BluBlocker  sunglasses  let  you  see  clearer,  sharper  and  with
more deﬁnition.”

If you’re describing a product that is designed for the circu-
latory  functions  of  the  body,  you  can  talk  about  “242  miles  of
blood  vessels”  instead  of  “miles  of  blood  vessels.”  When  you
talk about the bottom of your feet, instead of saying, “There are
a lot of nerve endings at the bottom of your feet,” you can say,
“There are 72,000 nerve endings at the bottom of your feet.” You
are stating a fact as opposed to a general or vague statement. You
are more believable.

You Sound More like an Expert
There’s one other beneﬁt to being speciﬁc. By being speciﬁc you
sound like you’re an expert on your product—you’ve really in-
vestigated it and are very knowledgeable. And, this too, builds
trust and conﬁdence.

People, in general, are very skeptical about advertising and
often don’t believe many of the claims stated in ads. But when
you make a speciﬁc claim using the exact facts and ﬁgures, your
message is much more credible and often trusted.

30. Familiarity

The  Kowloon  section  of  Hong  Kong  is  an  exotic  part  of  the
city.  Its  storefronts,  hordes  of  people  and  many  sounds  and
smells make for a very unique and exciting place to visit. It is
different. And when you are in Kowloon, America seems aw-
fully far away.

I was walking down the street absorbing the energy of the
area and stopping occasionally to look in a store when suddenly,
right in front of me, I saw one of my American suppliers walking
down the sidewalk.

What  a  surprise!  It  was  a  wonderful  feeling  to  see  some-

body I knew in a foreign place like Hong Kong.

Although  previously  I  hadn’t  been  that  friendly  with  the
supplier, I suddenly felt close. I asked if he was available for din-
ner and I made an appointment for that evening to get together

185

U N D E R S T A N D I N G   W H A T   W O R K S

and spend some time with him. As a result, he ended up selling
me  a  lot  more  than  I  normally  would  have  bought. The  con-
trast of seeing somebody with whom you are familiar in a to-
tally  foreign  setting  creates  a  strong  attraction.  And  so  it  is
with advertising.

An Ad as an Old Friend
If  somebody  is  reading  a  magazine  and  sees  your  advertising
format—something they have seen many times before—and rec-
ognizes your logo or company name, there is a feeling of famil-
iarity. They see a friend in an environment of foreign advertisers
and to them you’re not foreign. You are familiar and as a result
there is an attraction to your offering just as I was attracted to my
supplier in Hong Kong.

Advertise enough times or sell a product whose name is fa-
miliar to your prospect and you will create the same attraction.
That is why brand names are so important; that is why the famil-
iarity of a shopping environment is also important.

When I ﬁrst appeared on QVC, the home shopping chan-
nel, we sold out our entire inventory of BluBlocker sunglasses
within  minutes.  When  our  sunglasses  ﬁrst  appeared  on  retail
shelves  in  the  Walgreens  drugstore  chain,  they  quickly  sold
out within a few days. In short, our product was well known to
the consumer. Each time we introduced our product to a famil-
iar shopping environment, the combination of brand name fa-
miliarity  and  a  familiar  selling  environment  caused  an
immediate sellout.

The words familiar and familiarity have the word family in
them.  People  feel  most  comfortable  within  their  own  family.
They  feel  conﬁdent  and  trusting  and  allow  themselves  to  be
more vulnerable. So it is with anything people are familiar with.
They trust a brand name, are more conﬁdent that they are buying
the right product and are more inclined to do so.

One of the biggest mistakes traditional advertisers make is
to kill campaigns they have been using a long time because they
are tired of them. “Fly the friendly skies of United” and “You de-
serve a break today, at McDonald’s” are but two examples famil-
iar to consumers. In addition, consumers often sang along during

186

T H E   P S Y C H O L O G I C A L   T R I G G E R S

these commercials. Too often in traditional advertising, the client
gets tired of the commercial long before the public does.

In  direct  marketing,  a  decision  to  drop  a  commercial  ap-
proach is not arbitrary. You keep running your product or service
ad  until  the  public  tells  you  when  to  stop  by  virtue  of  lower
sales.  The  orders  simply  stop  coming  in  or  you  have  replaced
your ad with something that pulls more response. Good direct-
marketing  technique  calls  for  continually  revising  or  tweaking
your ad until it does better. But you never drop a campaign be-
cause you are tired of it. Drop it only when the public stops ex-
changing their hard-earned dollars for your product or service.

Now the traditional agencies will tell you something like,
“Well,  we  asked  a  focus  group  what  they  thought  about  our
slogan  and  they  said  that  they  were  getting  tired  of  it,  so  we
are going to pull it.” This is a major fallacy, too. There is no real
way  to  test  the  effectiveness  of  a  commercial  except  by  virtue
of  sales.  Focus  groups  only  tell  you  what  they  think  you  want
to hear and not how they would act themselves. If the product
isn’t selling, then look at the campaign. Maybe it isn’t even the
campaign  but  rather  competition  or  some  other  element  in  the
marketing mix.

Use Familiar Words
There  are  certain  words  that  are  more  familiar  to  most  people
and to the human consciousness. For example, if you ask some-
body to give you a number from 1 to 10 right off the top of their
head, chances are the number 7 will be chosen more often than
any  other  number—often  dwarﬁng  the  next  choice.  Therefore,
using the number 7 in a book title such as “The Seven Ways to
Improve Your  Relationships”  or  “The  Seven  Spiritual  Laws  of
Success”  is  utilizing  the  most  common  and  familiar  integer  of
the  ﬁrst  10.  You  are  therefore  vibrating  with  the  familiar  and
harmonizing with your reader.

Ask somebody for a color off the top of their head and the
answer will be “red” the majority of the time. Ask them to name
a piece of furniture and the answer will likely be “chair.” There
are  familiar  words  that  can  create  a  very  subtle  harmony  with
your reader and it’s up to you to ﬁnd them and use them. Where

187

U N D E R S T A N D I N G   W H A T   W O R K S

do you ﬁnd them? Many books have been written on the effec-
tive  use  of  words  that  really  draw  response.  Books  by  David
Ogilvy or John Caples are good ones to read. A list can be found
in Appendix D. There are some powerful words such as sale or
free. And then there are the not so obvious words—the ones that
relate speciﬁcally to your product and which you, as a passion-
ate  devotee  of  your  product,  inherently  already  know.  Finally,
there are words that aren’t in your own consciousness and aren’t
singled out in any books but will be discovered only by testing.
Sometimes, changing just one word in a thousand-word ad will
double response.

As a copywriter, be aware of the powerful force of familiar-
ity to make a person comfortable with your product or service.
Realize the importance of a familiar brand name, a logo that ap-
pears many times and becomes well known, a layout that people
instinctively  know  is  yours,  familiar  phrases  (not  clichés)  and
words  that  your  public  can  harmonize  with—all  of  these  rein-
force  the  bond  that  familiarity  creates  between  you  and  your
prospect.

31. Hope

Hope can be a great motivator in the buying process. A woman
buys a new face cream that offers the hope it will make a differ-
ence in her wrinkles. An intense golfer buys a new golf ball that
offers the hope it may take a few strokes off a golf game. In short,
there is an implied possibility that using a product or service will
provide a future beneﬁt. The future beneﬁt is not assured, nor is it
guaranteed; it is a dream, a fantasy or, at the most, a possibility.
The  hope  replaces  the  reality  of  an  already-delivered  beneﬁt  or
guarantee that you receive when you buy other products such as a
radio or a computer. Let me cite a few personal experiences and
describe how hope applies to speciﬁc products.

I was introduced in 1996 to a very successful scientist. He
had supposedly invented a formula that cured a great many hu-
man  ills. The  formula  contained  what  he  called  “biological  re-
pair machines” that went to the source of a malfunction in your
body and repaired it. If an organ was damaged, these miniature

188

T H E   P S Y C H O L O G I C A L   T R I G G E R S

“machines” would repair the organ even if it meant regenerating
a new one.

You placed a few drops of this product under your tongue

twice a day and it was absorbed into your body.

In a discussion with the scientist, it occurred to me that if
people  took  this  product  they  would  never  die,  if  indeed  it  re-
paired  any  defective  body  part.  He  agreed.  “I’m  taking  it  and
honestly feel I am getting younger. Look, my gray hair is starting
to turn black again.”

The  scientist  continued  claiming  that  there  was  no  reason
why his formula couldn’t keep us alive until the age of 300. This
sounded incredible to me. If this was true, this man had indeed
discovered the fountain of youth.

The scientist appeared to be very credible. He had several
Ph.D.’s, and I honestly thought he was one of the smartest people
I had ever met. He had three manufacturing facilities in different
parts of the world. He had a reputation that extended all the way
to  Europe  and  Asia,  and  he  told  me  how  he  helped  an  Asian
country cure many of its citizens of a speciﬁc form of cancer.

His  discovery  of  the  biological  repair  machines  came  to
him from uncovering formulas that were hidden in coded ancient
artifacts  and  through  the  process  of  what  he  called  “sacred
geometry.” He had apparently cracked the code and opened up a
wealth of information. He spent two hours showing me photo-
graph after photograph to substantiate the information he had re-
ceived from the artifacts.

I had a health problem that was not serious but, for what-
ever reason, doctors did not know its cause or cure. The problem
was a few small growths beneath the surface of my skin. They
were not cancerous, others hardly noticed them and they posed
no health threat. But they were there and they were not normal.

Surgery Was the Only Way
The only method doctors had for eliminating these growths was
to  cut  open  the  skin  and  surgically  remove  them—a  relatively
easy procedure that was done on an outpatient basis.

I  was  told  by  this  scientist  that  indeed  his  formula  could
eliminate the problem completely. “In just a few months they’ll be

189

U N D E R S T A N D I N G   W H A T   W O R K S

gone,” he said. In short, I received from him an explicitly clear
time  frame  during  which  my  growths  were  going  to  melt  away
and disappear. The promise wasn’t in the form of a hoped-for re-
sult or a dream or even a possibility. It was a deﬁnite warranty
that they would disappear.

I  was  so  impressed  by  him  and  his  discoveries  and  he
seemed so credible that I decided to put his product to a test. A
750 milliliter bottle (the size of a wine bottle) of his formula sold
for $600. It was rather expensive but it lasted a long time as you
used only a few drops each day and it was less costly than the sur-
gical procedure.

A Few Months Go By
After a few months, I noticed that the growths were not gone as I
had been promised. I was then advised to buy his stronger for-
mula—the one with a higher concentration of biological repair
machines. I did, at a cost of $2,000. There was still no improve-
ment after two more months.

I was then told that there was a $20,000 bottle that would
do the job (boy, they saw me coming) and believe it or not, I was
tempted to get a bottle. I didn’t.

Note: In all fairness to the scientist, there were clinical stud-
ies done on rats with his formula by a credible pharmaceutical
company and there were very positive results with the rats. The
research is continuing now on humans and he may have indeed
created a powerful new medical concept.

What did I learn from this experience? The doctor should
have simply told me about how his formula improved his life. I
trusted him. He had all the credibility I needed for me to ingest
this foreign substance into my body. What if I could live to 300
years of age? What if indeed I could become younger? I would
have gladly taken the formula and continued purchasing bottles
of it with the hope that I was right about him.

Scientist Made Fatal Error
But the scientist made a fatal error. Had he not made any claims
to me about speciﬁc expected results, I would not have been dis-
appointed but would have continued taking the product waiting
and  hoping  that  the  stuff  would  kick  in  and  dissolve  those

190

T H E   P S Y C H O L O G I C A L   T R I G G E R S

growths. I would, on the basis of hope, have continued taking it
and  buying  more.  But  once  a  speciﬁc  promise  was  made  and  I
saw that the formula didn’t work within that time frame, I imme-
diately  refused  to  invest  further.  The  scientist’s  credibility  was
questioned even though he may have had a great product.

When  using  the  psychological  trigger  of  hope,  you  must
avoid the trap of making a speciﬁc claim that can be measured or
guaranteed. You want to allude to what the product is used for
without making any promises of an exact outcome.

There  are  other  products  people  buy  repeatedly,  on  hope.
Let’s take vitamins, for example. Can people tell if taking vita-
mins  makes  a  difference  in  their  health? Yes,  some  can.  Inter-
view  a  bunch  of  people  and  they’ll  swear  the  vitamins  are
making  a  difference.  Capture  those  interviews  on TV and  they
are very impressive. Then prospects, impressed with the results
shown  on  TV,  start  buying  the  product  and  continue  to  buy  it
regularly  with  the  hope  that  it  is  making  a  difference  in  their
lives.  But  the  key  here  is  not  to  make  a  speciﬁc  promise  but
rather to imply results through testimonials.

How does this apply to selling in print and on the Internet?
There are some products that are sold using hope as a strong mo-
tivational tool. You need to determine the nature of your product
and ﬁnd something that you can imply about a future result with-
out stating a speciﬁc guarantee (particularly if you want to stay
in business for a long time).

Many  product  categories  lend  themselves  to  the  power  of
hope. The entire health food industry is a good example, includ-
ing vitamins, food supplements and even brain enhancers. Low-
ering  your  golf  score,  ﬁnding  a  new  relationship,  preventing
wrinkles,  impressing  your  date—all  are  good  opportunities  to
recognize the psychological trigger of hope at work.

Focus on Credibility
One aspect to focus on when you create an ad using the power of
hope is credibility. If you present yourself as a credible person
representing a credible company, then what you say will elicit a
feeling of conﬁdence on the part of your prospect. Then, what-
ever  you  say  your  product  did  for  you  or  for  your  previous

191

U N D E R S T A N D I N G   W H A T   W O R K S

customers  will  be  taken  as  a  possibility  for  your  prospect,  and
the power of hope will compel your prospect to order. And re-
order. It might be a book on relationships and how the informa-
tion changed your life and those of previous readers. It might be
a  formula  you  take  to  live  a  long  life  and  how  wonderful  you
feel. Whatever  you  are  selling,  with  the  proper  credibility,  you
will automatically engage the power of hope to sell.

This chapter is very important in your understanding of the
underlying reasons why people buy. Some of the 31 psycholog-
ical  triggers  to  buying  may  not  have  been  obvious  to  you  be-
fore.  Nevertheless,  an  awareness  of  each  of  these  points  will
give you a tremendous boost in becoming a great copywriter.

192

Selling a Cure, Not Prevention

Chapter 20

One of the least understood reasons why many products fail is
due to one aspect of human nature. Understand this aspect and
not only do you hold the key to creating a successful direct re-
sponse ad, but you will also understand clearly why some prod-
ucts just plain don’t sell.

The key to successfully marketing certain products lies in
the nature of that product and the way that product is viewed in
the marketplace. The guiding principle can be summed up very
clearly: Always sell the cure and avoid selling prevention.

Now what does this mean? Let me explain. If you were my
prospect and I tried to sell you a magic pill that contained an ex-
tract of carrots and various tinctures of leafy vegetables because
it would help prevent cancer, chances are it would be a difﬁcult
sale. However, if you suddenly discovered you had cancer and I
said to you that I had a magic pill that would cure the disease,
you would be not only willing to try it, but willing to pay consid-
erably more. In the ﬁrst instance, you might be willing to pay $20
a bottle to prevent the disease but in the other you might be will-
ing to pay $1,000 if it would cure the disease.

Human Nature at Play
The preceding is an extreme example. But let’s take something
less extreme. You’re a traveling salesperson and stay at hotels a
lot. Somebody tries to sell you a spray that you put on your feet
before  you  go  to  sleep  to  prevent  athlete’s  foot,  which  might
come  from  walking  on  a  ﬂoor  that  hasn’t  been  cleaned  thor-
oughly. You ignore the sales message because you rarely get ath-
lete’s foot, and besides, it’s a bother to use. The next week you
get  athlete’s  foot  and  you’re  at  the  corner  pharmacy  trying  to
ﬁnd the strongest thing they’ve got to cure it.

The  two  situations  illustrate  two  general  principles.  The
ﬁrst: It is human nature to think you’re never going to get the dis-

ease or afﬂiction that the preventive can prevent, so it becomes a
very tough sell. The second: If you do get the disease or afﬂiction,
you’re willing to pay a whole lot more for the cure than you were
for the preventive and it’s easier to sell.

I have been talking in medical or health terms. But this the-
ory  also  applies  to  several  other  products  and  concepts.  I’ll  go
into those in a moment, but let’s examine the ﬁrst step in break-
ing through the cure/preventive theory and see if you can make
the appeal of the preventive as strong as the appeal of the cure.

It can be done, but only if you can position the product to

make the preventive the cure. Let me cite an example:

When the Midex burglar alarms were ﬁrst sold by JS&A in
the late 1970s, it was deﬁnitely a product that was more of a pre-
ventive. However, I also knew that there were people who were
recently robbed or whose neighbors were recently robbed, and to
these people, the Midex alarm was more of a cure. Think about
it. At ﬁrst they thought, “Naw, our neighborhood is safe. I don’t
need  one.” And  then  after  their  neighborhood  was  robbed  and
they  needed  a  cure,  “Boy,  I’d  better  get  one  of  those  Midex
alarms  or  else  I  may  be  next.”  And  of  course,  there  was  the
prospect who had just been robbed: “Where did I see that ad for
that burglar alarm?”

I also knew that if I advertised in a
professional  manner  and  explained  the
quality and value of my product and its
quick  and  easy  installation,  as  opposed
to  using  the  scare  tactics  expressed
through quoting crime statistics, I would
attract  a  different  kind  of  customer.  I
would attract the person not quite threat-
ened but concerned—a person to whom
the  product  did  not  currently  represent
prevention or a cure. In short, it was for
somebody  who  hadn’t  been  robbed  and
whose neighbor hadn’t been robbed, but
who realized that there was a problem out there. This last group
would save my ad, and when they needed it, they would take it

out of their ﬁles—often after several months—and call. This ac-
tually did happen a lot.

Twenty  years  ago,  The  Club  automotive  steering  wheel
locking  device  would  have  been  a  tough  sale.  Back  then,  car
theft was not as big a problem as it is now. But with the increase
in  drug  trafﬁc  today  and  with  thousands  of  cars  being  stolen
every  hour, The  Club  has  become  more  of  a  cure  against  your
fear of having your car stolen.

The  big  rage  in  health  food  and  disease  prevention  a  few
years  ago  was  the  melatonin  craze. This  is  a  hormone  secreted
naturally by the pineal gland—a pea-sized object at the center of
the brain. It is supposed to help prevent aging. With millions of
baby boomers turning 60, it became a very big product—more of
a cure than a preventive.

Many Products Make Powerful Cures
When I sold my wrinkle pill, Miracell, it, too, was a cure. If you
have wrinkles, you are a great prospect for wrinkle creams and
treatments.  They  represent  cures,  not  preventives.  And  think
about  it.  Don’t  the  preventives  like  creams  to  moisturize  your
skin and sunscreens to avoid sun damage cost a lot less than the
cures? But some of the effective wrinkle eliminators cost plenty
for a small jar. Miracell sold at $25 for a month’s supply.

Insurance  is  another  preventive.  “Keep  your  family  from
going through hard times after you die.” What could be tougher
than  thinking  you’re  going  to  die  someday?  But  the  older  you
get, the more you think about it. And remember the story about
my friend, the insurance salesman, who always tried to sell me
insurance  and  ﬁnally  succeeded  when  my  next-door  neighbor
died suddenly at an early age? I couldn’t wait to sign the papers.
You must ﬁrst make a decision when evaluating a product.
Is this product a preventive or a cure? Can the product be posi-
tioned  as  a  cure  rather  than  a  preventive?  Is  the  market  trend
changing the perception of your product from being a preventive
to being a cure? Or do you simply have a preventive that does
not have a broad enough market?

If you’ve got a cure and the market is large enough, you’ve

195

U N D E R S T A N D I N G   W H A T   W O R K S

got a powerful product. If you’ve got a preventive, think in terms
of how you can change it into a cure. Let me show you how this
can be done.

Make a Preventive a Cure
Another  pill  I  have  been  selling  for  the  past  few  years,  called
simply “The Pill,” is a fuel-conditioning treatment for automo-
biles. It is a pill you put in your gas tank, and it is both a preven-
tive and a cure.

First,  as  a  preventive,  it  helps  you  avoid  engine  problems
by cleaning out your engine before anything serious happens to
your car from impurities that could lodge in your fuel injectors.
It reduces pollution to help you pass the many mandatory emis-
sions  tests  conducted  throughout  the  United  States,  and  it  pre-
vents you from having to visit the repair shop. Again, these are
the preventives.

But when I go on TV at QVC to present The Pill, I don’t talk
that much about what it prevents but rather what it cures. It cures
engine knock, it eliminates ping, it saves up to 10 percent on gas.
If you ﬂunk your emissions test, use The Pill and you’ll pass the
next time. In short, I emphasize the curative aspects of the prod-
uct and underplay the preventive features. And The Pill is truly a
miracle product. (I swear, it really works.) This brings me to my
next point.

Notice how I have to swear that The Pill really works. Sell-
ing truly breakthrough products is the toughest marketing job in
the  world  because  people  ﬁnd  it  difﬁcult  to  believe  that  these
products really work. And belief is one of the strongest motiva-
tional  factors  in  human  nature.  If  your  prospect  believes  in
something, he or she will move mountains to obtain it, but if he
or  she  doesn’t  believe  in  something,  you  won’t  move  that
prospect an inch.

In this chapter you’ve learned that you sell the cure, not the
preventive, that preventives don’t sell very easily and that some
products can be changed from preventives to cures. You’ve also
learned that you can charge a lot more for a cure than you can for
a  preventive. And  ﬁnally,  I’ve  demonstrated  that  you  can  suc-
cessfully market a product that is both a preventive and a cure by
emphasizing its curative aspects while underplaying its preven-

196

S E L L I N G   A   C U R E ,   N O T   P R E V E N T I O N

tive aspects. So let’s summarize what you’ve learned in a simple
statement that we can refer to in the future:

Selling a cure is a lot easier than selling a preventive, unless
the preventive is perceived as a cure or the curative aspects of
the preventive are emphasized.

The information presented in this chapter will be very help-
ful  for  you  in  evaluating  products  in  the  future.  Simply  under-
standing  that  the  cure/preventive  factor  exists  will  help  you  to
select and then position your next product for selling.

Rating Your Writing Level Chapter 21

You’ve  gained  a  tremendous  amount  of  knowledge  reading
this book. And in Section Three you will use this knowledge to
evaluate  my  mail  order  ads  and  those  of  others  who  attended
my seminar.

But  how  are  you  going  to  rate  yourself  in  the  future?  Is
there some measure you can apply to your writing to determine
if  you  are  communicating  at  the  level  you  need  to  in  order  to
reach your audience?

Well,  fortunately  there  is  a  way,  thanks  to  Robert  Gun-
ning, who created the Fog Index for newspaper writers to help
them  avoid  so-called  foggy  writing  and  determine  for  them-
selves the grade level of the copy they were writing. In short,
were  they  writing  with  enough  clarity  so  that  a  ﬁfth  grader
could understand their copy or must a reader be in high school
or even college to understand it? The lower the grade level, the
wider the audience.

Reaching a Mass Market
For example, if I wanted to reach a mass market, I would keep
my ad copy simple and my sentences short and I wouldn’t use
big words. On the other hand, if I wanted to reach a very upscale
audience, I might use bigger words and longer sentences.

Best-selling books are written for the 8th to 10th grade level.
Time, BusinessWeek and  the Wall  Street  Journal are  11th  grade
level. The Gettysburg Address and Reader’s Digest have a 10th
grade level in common. And for the most part, the average Amer-
ican audience reads between the 11th and 12th grade levels.

The following are the steps for determining the Fog Index,

or grade level, of the copy you write:

1. Take  a  sample  of  your  copy—start  with  100  to  125  words

from the very beginning of the ad.

199

U N D E R S T A N D I N G   W H A T   W O R K S

2. Count  the  words  in  each  sentence.  Dates  and  numbers  equal
one word and independent clauses count as separate sentences
(e.g., “We studied, and we learned” would be two sentences).
3. Divide the total number of words by the number of sentences

to get the average sentence length.

4. Count the number of long words (those of three or more sylla-

bles), but:

• Do not count short-word combinations like pawnbroker or

yellowtail.

• Do not include proper names.
• Do not include verbs that have become three syllables by

adding ed or es.

5. Divide  the  number  of  long  words  by  the  total  number  of
words in the selection to get the percentage of long words.
6. Add  the  average  sentence  length  to  the  percentage  of  long

words.

7. Multiply this total by 0.4 to get the grade level.

Now let’s use as an example the Vision Breakthrough ad we
discussed  in  Chapter  19  under  “Storytelling.”  The  ad  is  pre-
sented  in  full  in  Chapter  32.  I  will  take  the  ﬁrst  102  words  of
copy, and show you how to determine the grade level.

I am about to tell you a true story. If you believe me, you will be
well rewarded. If you don’t believe me, I will make it worth your
while to change your mind. Let me explain.
Len  is  a  friend  of  mine  who  knows  good  products.  One  day
he called excited about a pair of sunglasses he owned. “It’s so
incredible,” he said, “when you ﬁrst look through a pair, you
won’t believe it.”
“What will I see?” I asked. “What could be so incredible?”
Len continued, “When you put on these glasses, your vision im-
proves. Objects appear sharper, more deﬁned.

I have put the three long words in bold type. There are 102
total  words  in  this  selection  and  11  sentences. This  means  that
the average number of words per sentence is 9.3.

The next step is to divide the number of long words (3) by the
total words (102) to get the percentage of long words: 2.9 percent.

200

R A T I N G   Y O U R   W R I T I N G   L E V E L

Now add the average sentence length of 9.3 words to the per-
centage  of  long  words,  which  is  2.9,  and  you  have  the  number
12.2. Then multiply the number 12.2 by 0.4 and you end up with
the number 4.9. In short, this ad started out being understandable
to a very large segment of the market by virtue of the fact that it
was  quite  comprehensible  to  anybody  reading  at  about  the  ﬁfth
grade level and above.

Incidentally,  the  next  block  of  copy  in  that  same  ad  had
about the same reading level. The third block of copy jumped to
7.2, but by that time the reader was well into the copy. I would
suggest  that  you  take  different  100-word  blocks  from  different
parts of your ad to see how consistent your style is.

Try this with one of your ads or with one of the many ads in
Section Three. It is an easy way to determine the level of com-
prehension of your writing and it will also make you aware of
the  effect  that  multisyllabic  words  and  long  sentences  have  on
the comprehensibility of your ad and the level of reader that will
resonate with your copy.

The ad that we just tested was one of JS&A’s most success-
ful. And it seemed that with many of my ads, the greater the clar-
ity,  the  broader  the  appeal  and  the  greater  the  response. After
you’ve  tried  it  with  some  of  the  ads  in  this  book  or  other  ads,
you’ll be amazed at how easily you will be able to guess the Fog
Index from reading just the ﬁrst few paragraphs of any ad.

Clarity is one of the most important factors in writing copy,
and the Fog Index gives you an insight into how important short
sentences and simple words can be. But don’t be obsessed with
achieving  low  Fog  Index  scores  at  the  expense  of  common
sense. You  need  to  vary  the  length  of  sentences  and  use  three-
syllable words when you need them and realize that every audi-
ence is different.

Seven Steps to Writing Great Copy

Chapter 22

One of your reactions to having read the steps involved in writ-
ing copy might be that there are a lot of things to keep in mind as
you craft your ad. And indeed there are.

But  if  I  were  to  reduce  everything  down  to  a  simple
seven-step formula, I would suggest the following, keeping in
mind that you have read this book and have comprehended its
principles.

Step 1: Become an expert on the product or service you are
planning to sell. I have gotten more great ideas delving into dis-
covering  everything  I  could  about  a  product  or  service  than  I
have from any other resource.

Step 2: Know your prospect. You might become an expert
on your product or service but if you don’t know your customer,
you’re at a big disadvantage. What will motivate your prospect
to become a customer? Who is your typical prospect? This will
give you insight and also spur lots of good ideas.

Step  3: Write  your  headline  and  subheadline.  They  must
grab the reader and create enough curiosity to cause the reader to
get to the ﬁrst sentence. I like headlines that are short. “Vision
Breakthrough,”  “Pocket  CB,”  “Pocket  Yellow  Pages”—all  are
concise  and  yet  create  enough  curiosity  to  get  you  to  the  sub-
headline. Subheadlines should be around 16 words, and ﬁrst sen-
tences should be as short as possible.

Step 4: Write the copy. Don’t worry about sentence struc-
ture, grammar, punctuation—just start writing and keep writing.
Let all your ideas and thoughts ﬂow into the computer and above
all don’t worry about making mistakes. The main idea is to take
everything that is in your head about the subject and dump it into
your hard drive. If you write your copy by hand or with a type-
writer, write with the same abandon. However, you’re a lot bet-
ter off writing your ad with a computer, especially when it comes
to editing.

203

U N D E R S T A N D I N G   W H A T   W O R K S

Step  5: Edit  your  copy.  Go  through  it  and  correct  the
spelling, grammar, punctuation and sentence structure. Eliminate
extra  words  not  necessary  to  express  your  thoughts.  Tighten
things up.

Step 6: Incubate. Stop editing, put the text aside and take a
walk or do something pleasurable. You’ll be amazed at what get-
ting away from your text will do for you. If you can come back
to it the next day, better yet. The more time between what you’ve
just edited and taking the next step—all the better.

Step 7: Take a ﬁnal look at your copy. You’ll be amazed at
how much more you’re going to catch and how much more re-
ﬁned you will be able to make the copy with this ﬁnal look. Of
course you could easily repeat steps 5 and 6 and continue to edit
until you are happy with your results.

These seven steps summarize what you as a copywriter will
go through to write copy. It’s really that simple. And if you’ve
learned the principles of writing copy, each time you do this you
will get better at it. That I can guarantee.

You’ve Learned a Great Deal
You have learned what it takes to be a great copywriter in Sec-
tion One. You have learned in Section Two what works and why
it works.

In the ﬁrst two sections of this book I have taught you most
of the copywriting techniques I taught my seminar participants.
You  have  learned  techniques  that  took  me  many  years  to  de-
velop. You have learned concepts that I didn’t discover and per-
sonally use until well into my career. And most importantly, you
have  learned  from  my  failures—an  education  that  has  cost  me
dearly but that you do not have to experience on your own. Fi-
nally, you did not have to pay $3,000 to get this knowledge as
my seminar participants did.

In Section Three we take all that you have learned and crys-
tallize it into practical knowledge by examining many of the ads
that were used as examples in our seminar. This is an important
section, for here you see how all the pieces you have learned ﬁt
together.  We  also  examine  a  few  ads  where  the  pieces  didn’t
quite  ﬁt  together  and  we  show  you  how  they  could  have  been
done more effectively.

204

S E V E N   S T E P S   T O   W R I T I N G   G R E A T   C O P Y

In addition to examining a few ads from beginning to end, I
also reproduce a few of the JS&A ads that show my principles in
action.

If  you’ve  had  a  problem  understanding  any  of  the  princi-
ples, this is where you’ll get greater understanding and clarity. It
was during this part of my seminar when participants would of-
ten comment, “Now I feel I can do a great ad myself.” And they
often did.

205

Proving the Points—Ad Examples Preview

You’ve  learned  the  principles  and  theory  of  copywriting  and
you’ve had a chance to see how it all works through my many
personal experiences. Now it’s time to show you how these prin-
ciples actually work in some of the complete ad examples that
follow. This is the ﬁne-tuning you’ll need to perfect your newly
learned skills.

During the course of my seminar I showed slides of various
ads to illustrate the theories I was presenting. In my ﬁrst semi-
nars, the ads were mine and those of my competitors—the very
companies that were copying my format. But as the course con-
tinued  and  more  and  more  of  my  students  succeeded  with  the
knowledge I gave them, many of the ads I showed at subsequent
seminars were created by my former students themselves.

Finally, I used illustrations to show the best and the worst of
mail order advertising and even non-mail-order advertising. By the
end of the course, not only were my students able to tell me what
was wrong with each of the ads that I showed but they were pro-
ducing great advertising copy and even helping their fellow semi-
nar participants in crafting and improving their advertisements.

Hundreds of ads were presented during the seminar—all on
slides.  Several  of  the  classic  examples  were  duplicated  and
passed  around.  For  the  book  I  have  selected  only  a  few  of  the
best ads to illustrate the principles I taught—examples that will
solidify everything you’ve learned so far and add even more to
your insights and copywriting skills.

“But  hey,”  you  might  wonder.  “What  about  those  famous
JS&A mail order ads that were the hallmark of mail order adver-
tising in the 1970s and 1980s? Don’t they point out some really
important principles and aren’t they good examples of the best in
copywriting?”

Shucks. Well, if you insist. Okay, I’ll include some of those

as well.

209

P R O V I N G   T H E   P O I N T S — A D   E X A M P L E S

Starting in Chapter 28 are some of the JS&A ads that really
drive home various points. Not only are they examples of suc-
cessful  copywriting  but  they  are  entertaining  as  well.  The  fact
that  I  wrote  them  might  come  through  in  my  enthusiasm  and
commentary,  so  please  bear  with  me.  Deep  down,  I’m  really  a
modest kinda guy.

If your future is in TV marketing, these examples will help
you  understand  marketing  in  that  medium  as  well.  For  as  you
have already learned, my copywriting and marketing principles
can be applied to any form of advertising communication.

But now it’s time to solidify everything you’ve learned in
Sections One and Two with some classic ad examples to prove
many of my points.

The Lazy Man’s Way to Riches Chapter 23

This is a classic example of a mail order ad. There
are some people who spend their entire career creat-
ing hundreds of ads, and then there is Joe Karbo.

Joe  Karbo  wrote  only  a  few  ads.  He  wrote  the
one  I’ve  featured  here  right  off  the  top  of  his  head.
There was practically no editing involved. As he later
claimed at my seminar, “I just sat down and wrote the
ad in a matter of a few minutes and then looked back
at it, made a few changes, and that was it.”

The ad Joe created ran in hundreds of magazines
for many years. In later years, it was rewritten to re-
ﬂect more current mail order approaches, but it was
basically the same ad. And it has become a classic.

First, a little background on Joe. Joe Karbo was
discharged from the Army in 1945, and at age 20 with
a  wife  and  child,  no  money  and  only  a  high  school
education, he started his business career. Karbo was
modestly  successful  in  the  scrap  paper  business  and  then  he
moved  on  to  acting,  followed  by  advertising,  radio  and  ﬁnally
television.

Karbo had his own TV show in Hollywood and, along with
his  wife  Betty,  was  on  the  air  from  midnight  to  8  A.M. Since
sponsors  were  hard  to  come  by,  Karbo  started  a  direct  mail
business  and  sold  a  variety  of  products  on  his  show.  Joe  soon
mastered direct response advertising and ﬂourished.

In  1973  Joe  formalized  his  personal  philosophies  in  a
book called The Lazy Man’s Way to Riches in which he shared
his  beliefs  and  principles  both  on  success  and  on  direct  re-
sponse advertising. The ad shown is the one he wrote to mar-
ket his book.

Let’s examine the ad, as it will conﬁrm many of the things

This classic

books.

211

P R O V I N G   T H E   P O I N T S — A D   E X A M P L E S

you have already learned. We’ll start at the headline and system-
atically work our way through the entire ad.

Headline: The Lazy Man’s Way to Riches
Subheadline:  ‘Most  People Are Too  Busy  Earning  a  Living  to
Make Any Money’

The headline is provocative. At the time, this was a novel
approach  and  a  novel  headline.  Prior  to  this,  ads  such  as  this
were found only in the group of magazines classiﬁed as “income
opportunity.”  Magazines  such  as  Income  Opportunity, Success
and  Entrepreneur  had  dozens  of  offers  such  as  the  one  Karbo
was making, but the category of advertising hadn’t yet made it
into the mainstream. Joe’s was one of the ﬁrst to break through.
The headline grabbed you and got you to read the subheadline.
And the subheadline got you into the copy.

Let’s start with the copy and see if he is creating that slip-
pery slide. First, notice how he gets you into the copy by the use
of short sentences. Notice how short the ﬁrst sentence is and how
short all his sentences are. Also notice how he is identifying with
his  prospect—the  guy  or  gal  who  is  serious  about  succeeding
and wants a good life but ﬁnds himself or herself working hard
and not getting anywhere. The copy starts out as follows:

I used to work hard. The 18-hour days. The 7-day weeks.
But I didn’t start making big money until I did less—a lot less.

The ad continues and you’re compelled to read further.

For  example,  this  ad  took  about  2  hours  to  write.  With  a  little
luck, it should earn me 50, maybe a hundred thousand dollars.

Remember, this was written in 1973 and the equivalent of a
hundred thousand dollars today might be close to a half-million
dollars. Once again, Karbo is building curiosity. What is he offer-
ing? Why will this ad earn him so much money? You’ve got to
read further. Notice also that there are no big words, no compli-
cated long sentences. He’s leading his reader into the copy slowly
and  easily,  building  curiosity  as  he  goes.  He  tells  a  story  as  he
progresses.

What’s  more,  I’m  going  to  ask  you  to  send  me  10  dollars  for
something that’ll cost me no more than 50 cents. And I’ll try to
make it so irresistible that you’d be a darned fool not to do it.

212

T H E   L A Z Y   M A N ’ S   W A Y   T O   R I C H E S

Here Karbo is establishing trust with his readers. His hon-
esty is almost disarming. He tells you up front that he has some-
thing he wants to sell you for 10 dollars that costs him only 50
cents. He’s also building curiosity. He’s using basic and simple
statements, and the copy has you slowly slipping down his slip-
pery slide right to the next paragraph. Then note how he justiﬁes
the purchase.

After  all,  why  should  you  care  if  I  make  $9.50  proﬁt  if  I  can
show you how to make a lot more?
What if I’m so sure that you will make money my Lazy Man’s
Way that I’ll make you the world’s most unusual guarantee?
And here it is: I won’t even cash your check or money order for
31 days after I’ve sent you my material.
That’ll give you plenty of time to get it, look it over, try it out.

Note the ﬂow of the copy. Again he builds on the reader’s
curiosity, justifying the $10 purchase even if he hasn’t yet told
you about the offer. Now you are really curious. He wasn’t going
to cash the check for 31 days, which at the time was a novel ap-
proach.  It  was  what  I  call  a  “satisfaction  conviction”  because
your reaction might have been, “Boy, a lot of people are going to
rip him off. They’re going to get his book, read it and then return
it and get their uncashed check back in the mail.” You already
know how important a good satisfaction conviction can be from
Chapter  19,  and  Karbo  uses  it  here,  early  in  his  copy.  He  also
shows a degree of enthusiasm and conﬁdence in his concept that
raises your curiosity even more. He continues.

If you don’t agree that it’s worth at least a hundred times what
you invested, send it back. Your uncashed check or money order
will be put in the return mail.
The only reason I won’t send it to you and bill you or send it C.O.D.
is because both these methods involve more time and money.
And I’m already going to give you the biggest bargain of your life.
Because I’m going to tell you what it took me 11 years to perfect:
How to make money the Lazy Man’s Way.

Again, Karbo is justifying the purchase without even telling
you  what  it  is. And  he  is  justifying  why  accepting  payment  by
check is the only way he’ll sell it to you, giving you an economic

213

P R O V I N G   T H E   P O I N T S — A D   E X A M P L E S

basis for his decision. The curiosity builds. But instead of telling
you about his offer, he now changes direction completely to es-
tablish credibility for his offer by presenting himself as an exam-
ple of how successfully this program has worked.

O.K.—now I have to brag a little. I don’t mind it. And it’s neces-
sary—to prove that sending me ten dollars...which I’ll keep “in
escrow” until you’re satisﬁed...is the smartest thing you ever did.
I  live  in  a  home  that’s  worth  $100,000.  I  know  it  is  because  I
turned  down  an  offer  for  that  much.  My  mortgage  is  less  than
half that, and the only reason I haven’t paid it off is because my
Tax Accountant says I’d be an idiot.
My “ofﬁce,” about a mile and a half from my home, is right on
the beach. My view is so breathtaking that most people comment
that they don’t see how I get any work done. But I do enough.
About 6 hours a day, 8 or 9 months a year.
The  rest  of  the  time  we  spend  at  our  mountain  “cabin.”  I  paid
$30,000 for it—cash.
I have 2 boats and a Cadillac. All paid for.
We  have  stocks,  bonds,  investments,  cash  in  the  bank.  But  the
most important thing I have is priceless: time with my family.
And I’ll show you just how I did it—the Lazy Man’s Way—a se-
cret I’ve shared with just a few friends ’til now.

Here in these last paragraphs he is obviously whetting your
appetite and telling you what the results of his system produced
for  him.  But  there  is  another  very  subtle  thing  he  has  done  as
well.  He  is  trying  to  personally  identify  with  his  audience.  He
doesn’t talk about driving around in a Rolls-Royce but rather a
Cadillac. He talks about having a mortgage, which most of his
readers, if they own their own homes, probably have. He keeps
his wealth to a modest level, for if it was too far out of the reach
of his readers, they would not be able to relate to Karbo.

He is also selling the sizzle, not the steak. He is relating a
number of things, most of which sound pretty inviting to you and
represent  the  results  of  buying  his  system—the  many  material
things  in  life  that  most  of  his  readers  dream  of  having.  He  is
identifying with his prospects. And then at the end of the list, he
talks about the most priceless thing his system has created, “time
with  my  family.” All  of  this  resonates  with  the  reader,  who  by
now can’t stop reading and might be saying, “What does this guy
have to offer that can make it possible for me to live the life of

214

T H E   L A Z Y   M A N ’ S   W A Y   T O   R I C H E S

Joe Karbo?” So you read on. You read the secret that he’s shared
with only a few friends.

In  the  next  paragraph  you  ﬁnd  one  of  the  truly  important
highlights of his ad copy. He is very subtly trying to expand the
appeal of his offer to the broadest possible segment of the market.
Think about it. If he said that one person made millions, you might
not identify with what he is saying if you honestly didn’t believe
that you could earn millions. But you might relate to the little old
lady who is now able to travel wherever she wants or the widow
who is earning $25,000 extra a year. Or the guy who doesn’t have
much of an education.

As you read the following copy, see how he appeals to the
mass  market—probably  the  single  reason  that  this  ad  had  such
widespread appeal and was not conﬁned to just the income oppor-
tunity area. Also see where he again builds on his integrity when
he talks about almost declaring bankruptcy—thus relating to many
in his audience who may also be facing ﬁnancial difﬁculty.

It doesn’t require “education.” I’m a high school graduate.
It doesn’t require “capital.” When I started out, I was so deep in
debt that a lawyer friend advised bankruptcy as the only way out.
He was wrong. We paid off our debts and, outside of the mort-
gage, don’t owe a cent to any man.
It doesn’t require “luck.” I’ve had more than my share, but I’m
not  promising  you  that  you’ll  make  as  much  money  as  I  have.
And  you  may  do  better:  I  personally  know  one  man  who  used
these principles, worked hard, and made 11 million dollars in 8
years. But money isn’t everything.
It  doesn’t  require  “talent.”  Just  enough  brains  to  know  what  to
look for. And I’ll tell you that.
It doesn’t require “youth.” One woman I worked with is over 70.
She’s travelled the world over, making all the money she needs,
doing only what I taught her.
It  doesn’t  require  “experience.” A widow  in  Chicago  has  been
averaging $25,000 a year for the past 5 years, using my methods.

These  last  sentences  are  very  important.  In  short,  he  ap-
pealed  to  a  very  broad  segment  of  the  opportunity  market  and
even went beyond it to people who might not be looking for an
opportunity but would ﬁnd this message compelling. And Karbo
comes across as being incredibly honest. Remember, he told you
the cost of what he was going to send you and he seems to be

215

P R O V I N G   T H E   P O I N T S — A D   E X A M P L E S

very honest throughout his ad, even to the point of being disarm-
ing. Remember, honesty is a powerful psychological selling tool.
Now comes the closing pitch, with complete and total enthu-
siasm for his concept and his book. Once again, Karbo realizes
that many of his readers have jobs and at this point in the copy are
wondering if they will have to give them up to learn what he has
to offer. He uses a little sage wisdom given to him by a wise man
he met. And then he wraps up the entire ad with a question that
builds the ﬁnal level of curiosity to a point that compels you to re-
spond in order to ﬁnd out what this man has to offer.

What does it require? Belief. Enough to take a chance. Enough to
absorb what I’ll send you. Enough to put the principles into ac-
tion. If you do just that—nothing more, nothing less—the results
will be hard to believe. Remember—I guarantee it.
You don’t have to give up your job. But you may soon be making
so much money that you’ll be able to. Once again—I guarantee it.
The wisest man I ever knew told me something I never forgot:
“Most people are too busy earning a living to make any money.”
Don’t take as long as I did to ﬁnd out he was right.
I’ll prove it to you, if you’ll send in the coupon now. I’m not ask-
ing you to “believe” me. Just try it. If I’m wrong, all you’ve lost
is a couple of minutes and an 8-cent stamp. But what if I’m right?

It is interesting to see the cost of a ﬁrst class stamp back in
1973. Today as I write this book a stamp costs 39 cents, so the
cost  of  his  book  relative  to  the  cost  of  a  postage  stamp  was
equivalent to $50 in today’s dollars.

Then you examine the coupon. But right above the coupon

you ﬁrst read a sworn statement from his accountant:

“I have examined this advertisement. On the basis of personal ac-
quaintance with Mr. Joe Karbo for 18 years and my professional
relationship  as  his  accountant,  I  certify  that  every  statement  is
true.” (Accountant’s name available upon request.)

He also includes his bank reference. Once again, this really is
very convincing as prior to Karbo, nobody had ever put anything
like this in an ad. He was strongly establishing his credibility by us-
ing  the  bank’s  name  as  an  indirect  testimonial  to  his  honesty—
something his prospects needed in order to feel conﬁdent to reach
for their checkbooks and send him their hard-earned money.

216

T H E   L A Z Y   M A N ’ S   W A Y   T O   R I C H E S

The coupon is a summary of the offer.

Joe, you may be full of beans, but what have I got to lose? Send
me the Lazy Man’s Way to Riches. But don’t deposit my check or
money order for 31 days after it’s in the mail.
If I return your material—for any reason—within that time, re-
turn  my  uncashed  check  or  money  order  to  me.  On  that  basis,
here’s my ten dollars.

He  even  has  a  small  box  you  can  check  if  you  want  his

“material” sent by airmail for only one dollar more.

Note that he is sending “material” and not just a book. “Ma-
terial”  makes  the  program  appear  much  more  valuable—more
like a course as opposed to a book. It has much more sizzle than
just saying “book.”

If you sent in your money, you received a wonderful book
that  actually  looked  like  it  cost  about  50  cents  to  print.  But  it
contained both a motivational message and the direct marketing
techniques necessary to make money the “Lazy Man’s Way.”

Karbo ran these ads for several years. I had been establish-
ing  the  fact  in  my  national  advertising  that  there  was  no  such
thing as too many words. By 1973 we were really cranking out
our advertising, but mostly in the Wall Street Journal. One year
later  when  we  advertised  in  many  national  magazines,  we  no-
ticed  that  Karbo’s  copy  was  expanding  to  include  testimonials
and more examples to cover the broad market he was trying to
reach. The ads became more wordy with each passing year.

But it was Joe’s very ﬁrst ad—the ﬁrst major mass market
advertising campaign to come from the income opportunity area
in many years—that was the purest example of what I was teach-
ing in my seminar.

Joe Karbo attended my seminar in 1978. At my seminar he
shared  his  background  and  told  the  story  of  how  he  wrote  this
one ad.

Joe died in 1980 from a massive heart attack. He was being
interviewed  at  a  local  TV station  near  his  home  in  California
when the interviewer decided to unfairly attack Joe, thus chang-
ing entirely the premise of the interview. Joe’s ﬁrst reaction was
a heart attack from which he never revived. Joe was survived by
his wife Betty and eight children.

His  work  and  efforts  have  been  continued  in  an  excellent
recently revised version of his book (by Richard Gilly Nixon) in-
cluding a workbook. Any student of mail order needing some re-
ally good motivation should purchase it. Please see the listing in
Appendix D for this course as well as several other good direct
marketing books.

The Karbo ad was a classic. It was his biggest and best shot
in  the  mail  order  business  and  its  signiﬁcance  was  felt  by  the
many millions who bought his book and later indeed proﬁted by
it. But if this seemed like a real ﬂuke—a once-in-a-lifetime ex-
perience that would be impossible to duplicate—you’re wrong.
It is happening even as you read this, with other entrepreneurs
using direct marketing as a method to market their products.

The next true story tells of somebody who never wrote print
mail order copy before he sat down and wrote one of the classic
long-running mail order ads of the decade, and he did it right af-
ter attending my seminar. Read on.

A Fluke of Nature Chapter 24

Frank  Lewis  Schultz  is  a  farmer  who  grows  grape-
fruit in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas. For years he
had used a simple letter or direct mailing to build his
customer  base  into  a  nice-sized  business  that  sold
grapefruit by mail. But something always seemed to
elude him. He couldn’t get print mail order advertis-
ing to work for him.

He  realized  that  space  advertising  (the  idea  of
reaching millions of people for the same price it takes to
reach thousands by mail) sounded like a great concept.
And along with reaching millions, he could add credi-
bility to his company and more proﬁt to his bottom line.
It all sounded great until Schultz hired one of the
nation’s most respected direct response agencies. The
ﬁrst ad bombed. So did the second. In fact, his gross
sales  didn’t  cover  the  raw  cost  of  the  ad  space.
Schultz was discouraged.

When  I  announced  my  ﬁrst  seminar  in  1977,  Schultz  was
one of the ﬁrst to sign up. During the seminar, he was very quiet,
but he seemed to be absorbing everything I had to say. I didn’t
know  at  the  time  that  he  had  a  degree  in  marketing  from  the
University of California at Berkeley.

After  the  seminar,  with  the  information  fresh  in  his  mind,
he  went  to  the  local  Holiday  Inn  in  Minocqua, Wisconsin,  and
started drafting his ﬁrst print ad.

He based it on both the successful letter that he had run for
years and the information I had taught. And the result was sent
to  me  in  Northbrook,  Illinois,  upon  my  return  home  after  the
seminar.

The ad was great. It wasn’t the very technical style of the
JS&A ads,  but  it  had  a  homespun  feel  that  grabbed  you  at  the

It was Frank’s
ﬁrst ad and
it became
a classic.

219

P R O V I N G   T H E   P O I N T S — A D   E X A M P L E S

start and drew you through the copy all the way to the very end.
As Frank later said about the seminar and what he had learned
about  writing  copy,  “It  was  actually  pretty  easy  because  sud-
denly everything was clear. I knew what I had to say and how to
say it. I learned that you don’t have to be a professional copy-
writer to write effective copy.”

When I received Schultz’s ad, I called him on the phone and
told him, “Your ad is great. I only have a few changes to suggest
but they are minor. Your big problem is the headline.” I suggested
“Fluke of Nature” instead of “A Stroke of Luck from Mother Na-
ture”—the one he had written. I suggested the subheadline: “A new
grapefruit discovery may change your concept of fruit.” I also sug-
gested  he  take  out  a  line,  “The  zesty  ﬂavor  of  Royal  Ruby  Red
grapefruit juice will help start your day with a smile,” as it seemed
almost a cliché—something an ad agency might have written. And
there were several other small changes, but again, they were minor.
There were two pictures captioned with copy explaining the
offer, and of course all the elements were designed to get you to
read the ﬁrst sentence. Let’s examine the copy as we did with the
Karbo  ad  and  see  how  Schultz  captured  the  essence  of  what  I
taught, and in a very simple yet persuasive way. The copy starts
out with a ﬁrst paragraph that was printed in bold type to act al-
most as a subheadline, thus drawing you further into the copy:

I’m a farmer. And the story I tell you is the absolute truth, as in-
credible as it may seem.

This  is  a  classic  opening  for  an  ad.  Remember  we  talked
about how each word has an emotion and a story attached to it?
What does the word farmer bring to mind? How about honesty,
hard work and integrity? Simply by stating that he is a farmer, he
has established a degree of credibility right from the start of the
ad. And  then  look  at  the  curiosity  he  creates  right  away  in  the
second sentence. How could you not continue?

It all started in a grove owned by Dr. Webb, our family doctor.
One  of  the  men  who  was  picking  fruit  in  the  doctor’s  orchard
came up to the Webb house holding six of the strangest grapefruit
anyone had ever seen. A single branch of an ordinary grapefruit
tree had produced these six unusual fruit.
These  were  big  grapefruit,  unusually  big. And  they  had  a  faint

220

A   F L U K E   O F   N A T U R E

red blush on their skin. When Dr. Webb sliced open the grape-
fruit, the fruit was a brilliant ruby red in color.
Dr. Webb decided to taste this strange new grapefruit. The fruit
was perfect, juicy and luscious. It wasn’t sour like other grape-
fruit either—it was naturally sweet without sugar.
For  some  reason,  we’ll  never  know  why,  nature  had  chosen  to
produce an entirely new kind of grapefruit here in our Magic Rio
Grande Valley. It was incredible—men had labored for years to
produce  the  ideal  grapefruit,  and  had  failed.  But  suddenly  on  a
single branch of one tree in one grove, Mother Nature had done it
all by herself!

The copy reads almost like a fairy tale with the use of the
Magic Rio Grande Valley name and the story of this unexpected
discovery. Schultz created this environment—all woven through
a compelling and interesting story that holds your attention and
keeps you reading. You can’t stop now. You’ve got to see where
this all takes you. Schultz now goes into more detail on the fruit
itself. And he uses one technique that you would never believe
could be applied to fruit. He makes his product a rarity—a lim-
ited edition to be shared by very few people. Read the following
and see what I mean.

YOU CAN IMAGINE THE EXCITEMENT
From  the  fruit  on  that  one  branch,  grove  after  grove  now  pro-
duces our own Texas Ruby Red Grapefruit. When I say, “Not one
man in a thousand has ever tasted this grapefruit”—you can eas-
ily understand why.
To  begin  with,  Ruby  Reds  are  rare.  You  can  look  for  them  in
stores  but  I  doubt  if  you’ll  ﬁnd  one. You  may  ﬁnd  pink  grape-
fruit, but seldom if ever do you see the genuine Ruby Reds.
So you start with the rarity of Ruby Reds, and to get to ROYAL
Ruby Reds you have to get rarer yet. Only 4 to 5 percent of the
entire crop will qualify as a “Royal Ruby Red.”

Schultz  graphically  brought  out  the  true  rarity  of  what  he
was selling. You can certainly do that with a collectible, but the
simple way Schultz made his fruit rare was ingenious. After he
told  you  that  “not  one  man  in  a  thousand  has  ever  tasted  this
grapefruit,” you might have thought he was going to pitch you
on  the  fruit.  Instead  he  started  to  explain  what  makes  it  even
more rare. And it got so rare that it seemed quite plausible that
few people indeed have tasted this fruit.

221

P R O V I N G   T H E   P O I N T S — A D   E X A M P L E S

In the next passage, Schultz continues to build the story but
now he makes his message a very personal one. It almost sounds
like he goes right into the grove with his men to pick the fruit. He
is personally involved in every step of the growing and picking
process, and he uses this approach to make his message personal.
Secondly, he even uses a technical explanation—something that
really builds conﬁdence in the expertise he brings to his farming.
A technical explanation in selling electronics would make sense,
but see how he does it here with a very nonscientiﬁc product—
grapefruit. And he also gets you totally involved with the fruit it-
self. Your taste buds are activated and you can almost savor the
grapefruit as you read the copy. He is actually using your sense of
taste as an involvement device. Instead of turning the knobs of a
TV set or clicking on the keys of a calculator to involve you, he’s
getting you to salivate. The copy continues:

Each Royal Ruby Red weighs a pound—or more! Each has a rich
red color, ﬂowing juices, luscious naturally sweet ﬂavor, and the
ability to stay this way for many weeks.
Why,  we  won’t  even  consider  harvesting  a  grove  until  I’ve
checked out the fruit for tree-ripened maturity myself. I check for
“natural sugar,” low acid balance and high juice content. I check
to see that the fruit is plump and meaty, and I even check to see
that the skin is thin. Not only does each factor have to check out,
but all the factors have to be in a proper relationship to each other
before I’ll harvest a grove.
And when we pick the fruit, we’re just as fussy. Every one of us
takes  a  “picking  ring”  when  we  harvest.  If  the  fruit  is  small
enough to pass through this ring—we don’t pick it! It simply isn’t
big enough to qualify as a Royal Ruby Red!
Even after picking there are other careful inspections each fruit
must pass before I’ll accept it. I size the fruit. And I grade it for
beauty. Sometimes the fruit will be wind scarred. I won’t accept
it.  Or  sometimes  it  will  have  a  bulge  on  the  stem  that  we  call
“sheep nose.” I won’t accept it. You can see I really mean it when
I say I accept only perfect Royal Ruby Reds.
By now you can just picture Frank Schultz out in the grove
with  his  picking  ring  rejecting  wind-scarred  grapefruit  or  fruit
that has sheep nose. By now you are actually convinced that this
fruit  is  very  carefully  selected—chosen  not  only  for  its  juice
content but also for its beauty. Beauty? Yep, beauty.

Probably  the  one  thing  that  he  uses  with  great  skill  is  the

222

A   F L U K E   O F   N A T U R E

personal nature of his presentation. His company sounds small—
as if it is made up of just Schultz and a few other pickers. And
they all go out with their picking rings, spend the day gathering
only  the  prettiest  and  juiciest  grapefruit,  and  then  return  with
their  harvest  for  shipping  to  just  a  few  of  their  customers  the
next  day.  It  is  a  beautiful  example  of  the  personal  one-to-one
selling technique that you want to capture in print, and Schultz
has managed to do this in a very simple and masterful way.

Think also about the nature of grapefruit. This is unquestion-
ably a simple product and this chapter is a good example of my
“simple  versus  complicated”  rule.  When  something  is  simple,
like a grapefruit, you make it complex. If it’s complex, you make
it simple. What could be more simple than a grapefruit? But look
at how Schultz has brought out all the features and the complexi-
ties of his selection process and even his own expertise by telling
you more than you’ve ever wanted to know about grapefruit.

Schultz is now ready for the pitch. The grapefruit could not
get any better. It is rare, it is delicious, it is beautiful and it has
value. It’s now up to Schultz to make his customers reach into
their  pockets  and  exchange  their  hard-earned  dollars  for  his
grapefruit, and he makes it as simple as possible.

Frank  does  this  by  offering  a  sample  shipment—a  low-
priced no-risk opportunity just to try his product. He makes it so
simple that you begin to wonder if he’s going to be ripped off.
And what does that signify? That’s right—a satisfaction convic-
tion—something that is so compelling, you wonder if people are
going to take advantage of him.

When  I  realized  that  the  Royal  Ruby  Reds  were  the  ultimate
fruit, I decided to form a club and sell only to my club members.
In this manner, I can control my production to insure that nobody
will be disappointed.
But  before  I  ask  you  to  join  my  club,  I  want  you  to  sample  my
Royal Ruby Reds for yourself, at no cost to you whatsoever. Let me
send you a box prepaid of 16 to 20 Royal Ruby Reds. Place four of
them in your refrigerator until they are thoroughly cool. Then cut
them in half and have your family sample this unusual fruit.
You decide whether or not Royal Ruby Reds are everything I say.
You  determine  whether  or  not  eating  a  Royal  Ruby  Red  is  the
fantastic taste experience I promise.

223

P R O V I N G   T H E   P O I N T S — A D   E X A M P L E S

You  decide.  I’m  conﬁdent  that  you  and  your  family  will  want
more of this superb fruit and on a regular basis, too. If the four
Royal Ruby Reds make you say “yes,” then keep the remaining
fruit. Otherwise return the unused fruit (at my expense) and you
won’t owe me a single penny.
But  you  are  never  going  to  know  just  how  wonderful  genuine
Royal Ruby Reds are unless you place your order right quick.
This way you are sure to receive your package containing 16 to 20
Royal Ruby Reds for you and your family to sample. But since the
supply is strictly limited it’s important to place your order now.

Note the use of the words “right quick.” That’s the way farm-
ers  talk,  isn’t  it. And  it  is  this  homey-sounding  copy  that  capti-
vated his audience. In fact, Schultz asked me if he should leave it
in. “It isn’t really good English” was his concern. “By all means,
leave it in,” I suggested. “It sounds great to me.”

His offer then went on to give the terms of the purchase. The
ﬁrst box was going to cost $5 less than the standard shipment—a
further incentive to at least try his grapefruit. In fact, you actually
didn’t pay anything up front, as he also included a bill for $9.95.
You paid only if you wanted to keep the shipment and you then
were enrolled in his monthly club. His copy continued:

Now suppose you do like Royal Ruby Reds—suppose you love
them—can you be sure of getting more?
You surely can. By saying “yes” to my ﬁrst shipment you have
the  privilege  of  automatically  joining  my  Winter  Fruit  Club.
Please be assured you pay nothing in advance. But each month
during the winter, I’ll ship you a pack of 16 to 20 orchard-fresh,
hand-selected, hand-picked Royal Ruby Reds.
Every  Royal  Ruby  Red  you  receive  will  pass  my  tough  tests.
Each  will  weigh  a  pound  or  more.  Safe  delivery  is  guaranteed.
This fruit is picked, packed and shipped each month, December
through April.
You pay only after you have received each shipment. And you can
skip or cancel any shipment, simply by telling me your wishes.

He summarized his offer. He restated most of the points he
told you in the previous copy at the very end of the ad. And then
he goes into the close:

Remember, it obligates you to nothing except making a taste test
of the best grapefruit that has ever been grown. And this taste test
is on me!

224

A   F L U K E   O F   N A T U R E

Of course, as you can well imagine, when I say supplies are lim-
ited—I’m not kidding! There’s just so many club members I can
accept before I must close my membership this year.

In this statement, he is giving you a sense of urgency that is
both believable and true. Production is limited and getting your
order in quickly is very important to ensure that you’ll be part of
the membership program. He also makes it sound risk free and
easy to test.

So to taste this “miracle” grapefruit and have the opportunity to
savor it each month during the growing season, be sure to place
your order at no obligation, today.

Frank was pleasantly surprised when he ran his test ad in the
Wall  Street  Journal: “Our  cost  per  order  was  the  lowest  of  any
outside list we’ve ever used, and I realized that a single advertise-
ment held the key to the rapid growth of our company.”

But Frank Schultz didn’t stop there. He continued to advertise
in  the Wall  Street  Journal, the New York  Times, Parade,  and  TV
Guide,  to  name  only  a  few.  “When  you’re  a  farmer  you  always
worry about the crop. It’s growing too slow—you worry. It’s grow-
ing too fast—you really worry,” said Frank later in a letter to me.

“I ﬁnd it to be about the same when a farmer gets into space
advertising.  The  orders  are  coming  in  so  good  from  our  space
ads, I’m beginning to worry. A high-class worry, I’ll admit.”

In December 1980, an article on Schultz appeared in Texas
Monthly magazine.  The  story  talked  about  his  wonderful  copy
and how the copy made his business seem small and personal.
Yet it also explained that the business was quite large by then.
He harvested 26,000 tons of grapefruit in 1979 with only 4 per-
cent  passing  Schultz’s  rigorous  standards  for  Royal  Ruby  Red
grapefruit. The rest were sold to the grocery chains. And he now
had  80,000  customers  in  the  48  contiguous  states.  He  owned
14,000  acres  of  orchards  spread  out  from  Brownsville  to
McAllen, Texas, and had hundreds of employees. He truly was a
success story—all created from the power of his pen.

And  yet,  his  customers  visualized  Frank  with  his  picking
ring  out  in  the  orchard  picking  those  perfect  Royal  Ruby  Red
grapefruit free of sheep nose and wind scarring.

225

P R O V I N G   T H E   P O I N T S — A D   E X A M P L E S

From time to time, Frank would send me some of the letters
he received complimenting him on his copy. One came from Stan-
ley  Marcus,  then  the  chairman  of  Neiman  Marcus.  Some  were
from other copywriters who recognized his ad as brilliant. And for
many years Schultz ran the ads until they ﬁnally wore out.

I myself was in Schultz’s grapefruit club for many years. And
from my orders alone, he probably made back all the money he
had spent on my seminar. If you’d like Royal Ruby Red grapefruit

Lingerie for Men Chapter 25

Victoria’s Secret is now a major chain with 900 stores do-
ing $2.4 billion in sales with a major catalog division that
does $870 million by itself. But back in 1979, it consisted
of just three small stores and a catalog—all founded by an
entrepreneur named Roy Raymond. And that is when Bar-
bara Dunlap attended my seminar.

The ad she wrote helps illustrate many of the principles
you’ve  learned  in  this  book  and  also  points  to  a  few  she
overlooked. Let’s start with the headline and subheadline. If
you were a man or a woman reading through a newspaper,
you might stop dead in your tracks if you saw the following:

Headline: Lingerie for Men
Subheadline: How a Group of Very Special Men Made It
All Possible

Note  that  the  headline  was  just  three  words—short,
concise  and  certainly  enough  to  get  you  to  read  the  sub-
headline.  Then  notice  that  the  subheadline  did  not  give
away the premise of the ad; you still don’t know what it is.
In fact, it might sound like some men got together and made the
wearing of lingerie possible. You just don’t know, so you keep
reading.

Now read the ﬁrst paragraph, which is in large type and ac-
tually draws you into the copy. Also note the storytelling feel of
the ﬁrst few paragraphs.

WE WERE ASTOUNDED! When we opened the doors of our new busi-
ness, we thought most of our customers would be women. After all,
beautiful designer lingerie is the kind of luxury a lady can’t resist.
How wrong we were.
That ﬁrst Valentine’s Day, the men came in droves! Hundreds of
men, who had secretly been dying to visit our boutique. At last,
they had the perfect excuse—Valentine’s Day gifts for their fa-
vorite ladies.

The ad drew a lot
of attention but
missed a few
major points
at the end.

227

P R O V I N G   T H E   P O I N T S — A D   E X A M P L E S

They loved the merchandise.
Can you imagine how shocked we were? All those men—milling
about  our  Victorian  boutique.  Admiring  the  silk  stockings  and
lacy  garter  belts  from  France.  Totally  smitten  by  the  luxurious
silk  and  satin  kimonos  from  London.  Crowding  around  the  bra
and  bikini  sets  from  Italy.  They  couldn’t  wait  to  surprise  their
wives or girlfriends with something truly special.

Once again as the story is told you can visualize the scene.
You can almost see the merchandise and appreciate how the vari-
ety of merchandise is woven neatly into the story. But now a ques-
tion might pop into your mind as you are reading this. And this
very question is brought into the copy at precisely this moment.

Weren’t they embarrassed?
The truth is, they were. But not enough to keep them away! They
had  seen  our  exciting,  full-color  catalogue. A breathtaking  pic-
ture  book  of  beautiful  women,  wearing  enticing  creations.  Be-
sides, a few men became our ﬁrst satisﬁed customers. And in a
short time, they had managed to spread the good word. Victoria’s
Secret wasn’t like shopping for lingerie in a department store. No
matronly  saleslady  to  make  a  man  feel  uneasy.  No  raised  eye-
brows or pursed lips asking about sizes. No racks of ﬂannel and
terrycloth  to  wade  through. And  no  clunky,  plastic  boxes  over-
ﬂowing with boring white foundation garments.

There were a number of good issues just covered. First, Dun-
lap comes across as being truthful when she admits that the men
were  embarrassed.  In  short,  she  raises  an  objection  in  the  para-
graph heading (“Weren’t they embarrassed?”) and then answers it
honestly. But then she brings in the fact that they were motivated
by a full-color catalog that she refers to as a “breathtaking picture
book.” Here she very subtly brings in the catalog as the motiva-
tional factor that prompted all these men to come to the store.

Another objection you might raise if you decided to go to
the store is the store environment itself and the human element
in the store—the salesclerks. If you were a man, would you be
embarrassed? Here in this same paragraph (which really should
have been a new paragraph) she raises the objection and resolves
it by pointing out that the store has none of the embarrassments
found in a department store. In short, this is a store that would
not embarrass a man at all.

228

L I N G E R I E   F O R   M E N

In this ad, Dunlap ﬁrst got your attention and raised all the
objections that you might have if you were a man and wanted to
buy  lingerie  for  your  wife  or  girlfriend  in  a  women’s  lingerie
store. In the next paragraph, Dunlap broadens the market from
just a few men to all men, similar to the way Karbo broadened
his income opportunity ad to include anybody interested in bet-
tering his or her life. Here’s what she said.

The men in our life.
Since  that  ﬁrst  Valentine’s  Day,  we’ve  learned  a  lot  about  our
male  customers.  Mainly,  they  can’t  be  stereotyped.  Some  are
conservative, some far from it. Some are rather old, while others
are  much  younger.  Whether  doctors,  accountants,  salesmen  or
bankers  . . .  they  all  have  one  thing  in  common. They  are  true
connoisseurs  of  beauty. They  know  how  sensuous  and  lovely  a
lacy  camisole  or  elegant  gown  looks  on  a  woman. And  what’s
more, they know how wonderful a woman feels to receive some-
thing beautiful and intimate from a special man. And it takes a
very special man to shop from Victoria’s Secret.

Not only does Dunlap include a broad range of men but she
then  compliments  the  men  on  their  taste  and  understanding  of
women in general.

In the next paragraph we ﬁnally get the real pitch of the ad.
Since  the  only Victoria’s  Secret  stores  were  located  in  northern
California at the time, the real purpose of this ad, which ran na-
tionally, was to attract catalog customers from the other 49 states.
So after the paragraph heading “Our luxurious photo album . . .”
comes the pitch. Note the colorful and sensuous language, which
only helps to create the environment for this ad.

If you’re like our male patrons—sensuous and fashion-conscious
in your own right—you’ve been dying to ﬁnd a place like Victo-
ria’s Secret. However, if you live outside of northern California
you won’t ﬁnd it. But for $2.00 you can have the next best thing.
Our luscious, full-color catalogue of alluring designer lingerie.
What if you don’t like our style?
We guarantee you’ll be the ﬁrst man who didn’t. But . . . if after you
receive  our  catalogue,  you  ﬁnd  our  fashions  too  sensuous  or  too
luxurious  for  the  lady  in  your  life,  you  haven’t  lost  a  thing.  Our
lush, full-color catalogue is an elegant collector’s item—a conver-
sation piece your friends will adore! (Already, our customers are re-
questing previous editions of the Victoria’s Secret catalogue.)

To receive your own personal copy, send $2.00 to Victoria’s Se-

ful catalogue of fashion romance via ﬁrst class mail.

There  was  one  main  problem  with  this  ad,  and  unfortu-
nately it came at the most critical part—at the end. The objection
some prospects might raise is, “What if I’m not pleased with the
$2  catalog  or  any  of  the  merchandise?”  Nothing  was  indicated
about their return policy. And a nice hook could have been to al-
low customers to use their $2 investment in buying the catalog
toward the purchase of their ﬁrst order. Or even allowing them
$10 toward their ﬁrst order.

From  what  I  understand,  the  ﬁrst  ad  was  moderately  suc-
cessful in bringing in catalog requests, which in turn brought in
sales. This was a two-step process—to scan the market for possi-
ble customers and then make them customers through the cata-
log.  This  is  a  very  good  application  of  a  print  ad  and  a  good
example of many of the principles.

The principles that you should particularly pay attention to
are the excellent timing of the objections and how they were re-
solved and the beautiful use of words that told a story and cre-
ated the perfect environment for the offer. The real offer was the
catalog, but the story that was told gave men permission to get
the catalog and buy from it—a lot less embarrassing than going
into the store.

“Lingerie  for  Men”  was  brief,  it  was  interesting  and  it
ﬂowed  quite  nicely.  And  although  its  ending  could  have  been
more compelling and more effective, it brought you through the
copy  like  a  slippery  slide  all  the  way  to  the  very  end.  I  would
have also added a byline to the ad to make it even more personal.
The catalog Victoria’s Secret published back in 1979 was a
lot more sensuous than the catalog they put out today. If I had to
classify it, I would say it was an upscale version of a Frederick’s
of Hollywood lingerie catalog. And indeed, both catalogs were
quite popular with the men.

Two advertising people from Victoria’s Secret attended my
seminar before the franchise was sold to The Limited. The two
women used their copywriting skills to write the colorful cata-
logs.  They  both  claim  that  the  seminar  was  one  of  the  turning

230

L I N G E R I E   F O R   M E N

points in their careers and a major factor in the early success of
Victoria’s  Secret.  Tragically,  Roy  Raymond,  Victoria  Secret’s
founder, committed suicide in 1993 by jumping off the Golden
Gate Bridge.

The lesson to be learned from this example is that you can
write  a  great  ad  but  then  miss  some  important  opportunities  at
the end. And the end of the ad is when the buying decision has to
be made—it’s a critical point in any advertisement.

In  the  next  chapter,  I  give  you  an  example  of  a  company
trying to resolve a problem without ﬁrst raising it. It will clarify
the  important  method  of  always  raising  an  objection  and  then
resolving it.

231

The More You Learn Chapter 26

This  is  a  good  example  of  an  advertising  message  that
could have been quite powerful if it weren’t for one fatal
ﬂaw. Let me explain.

I was ﬂying back from Rockford, Illinois, in my own
private plane. I was about 50 miles from the Pal-Waukee
airport where I was scheduled for an instrument landing
even  though  the  weather  was  perfect  for  ﬂying. The  air
trafﬁc  controllers  were  unusually  quiet  as  I  approached
Pal-Waukee. It was a bright clear day—one of those rare
days when you could see for miles.

As I got closer to Pal-Waukee, I could see off in the
distance a big ﬁre near Chicago’s O’Hare airport. I landed
my plane, parked and walked into the airport ofﬁce where
I learned from a television broadcast that American Air-
lines ﬂight 191 had just crashed on takeoff from O’Hare
and  that  all  its  passengers  had  died.  That  was  May  25,
1979, and it was one of those memories that remains indelibly
etched in my mind.

The  plane  that  crashed  was  a  DC-10—one  of  McDonnell
Douglas’s largest and most popular aircraft. Immediately after the
crash, it was determined that there was a hydraulic problem that,
under certain circumstances, could cause loss of control and conse-
quently  a  crash.  McDonnell  Douglas  quickly  corrected  the  prob-
lem, but for a while all DC-10s were grounded.

If  that  weren’t  enough,  the  DC-10  was  involved  in  two
more  crashes  within  a  relatively  short  period  of  time.  The  last
two were unrelated to any fault of the airplane, but the stigma of
the American Airlines crash was still on the mind of the public.
McDonnell Douglas realized that it had to do something to offset
the negative publicity.

They picked Pete Conrad to act as spokesman in an adver-
tisement to address the public’s concern. But instead of raising the

This ad had a
major ﬂaw. The
entire ﬁrst part
was missing.

233

P R O V I N G   T H E   P O I N T S — A D   E X A M P L E S

objections  of  the  plane  crashes  and  then  resolving  the  problem
with the excellent copy that was written, the objection was totally
ignored. The resulting ad was hollow. The following is the copy as
it was written:

Headline: “The more you learn about our DC-10, the more you
know how great it really is.”
Byline: Pete Conrad, Former Astronaut, Division Vice President,
McDonnell Douglas
Copy: I’ve watched airplanes and spacecraft take shape for much
of my adult life. I’m certain that nothing made to ﬂy has ever been
designed or built to more exacting standards than our DC-10.
Eighteen  million  engineering  man-hours  were  invested  in  this
plane’s development. That includes 14,000 hours of wind tunnel
testing, as well as full-scale ‘fatigue testing’ for the equivalent of
40 years of airline service.
I’m convinced that the DC-10 is the most thoroughly-tested jet-
liner  ever  built. Along  with  U.S.  Government  certiﬁcation,  the
DC-10 has passed structure tests just as demanding, in their own
way, as those required of U.S. Air Force ﬁghter planes.
The DC-10 ﬂeet demonstrates its dependability ﬂying more than
a  million  miles  a  day  and  serving  170  cities  in  90  countries
around the globe.

The ad then ended with a place to write McDonnell Dou-

glas to get more information.

The copy was good copy—very persuasive in terms of build-
ing conﬁdence in the plane. And all this was presented by a former
astronaut to add credibility. But it lacked an important opening that
would have made the copy many times more effective.

What if the ad had started out differently? If I were given

the assignment of writing the ad, here’s the way it would go:

Headline: DC-10’s Big Secret
Subheadline: You’ve heard a lot of bad publicity about the DC-10.
But here’s something you may not have known.
Byline: By Pete Conrad
Copy:  It  was  horrible.  When  American  Airlines  ﬂight  191
crashed at O’Hare in Chicago last May 25th, hundreds of people
lost  their  lives  in  what  was  considered  one  of  the  worst  plane
crashes in American history. The plane—a DC-10.
But  as  the  facts  emerged,  it  was  learned  that  a  series  of  coinci-
dences  resulted  in  a  hydraulic  malfunction  that  in  all  likelihood

234

T H E   M O R E   Y O U   L E A R N

would never happen again. But it did happen. And in the subse-
quent weeks, a series of fail-safe systems were installed that make
the DC-10’s hydraulic system among the safest of any jetliner.
In addition, two other recent crashes of DC-10s were determined
to be totally not the fault of the airplane but of the pilots. But be-
cause  of  the  negative  publicity  generated  by  the American Air-
lines crash and these other two crashes, we have been even more
diligent. All airlines are required to give each DC-10 a complete
inspection  every  50  hours  instead  of  the  required  100  hours  of
ﬂying. The plane’s hydraulic system is checked before each ﬂight
instead  of  waiting  until  a  required  inspection.  And  the  plane’s
structural  system  is  checked  not  only  by  each  mechanic  but  by
the pilots themselves. You couldn’t ﬂy a safer plane.

Then I would pick up the copy from the existing ad so it

would continue,

I’ve watched airplanes and spacecraft take shape for much of my
adult life. I’m certain that nothing made to ﬂy has ever been de-
signed or built to more exacting standards than our DC-10.

The rest of the original copy would follow. Do you see the
difference? What I have done is to raise the real problem (or as I
call it, the “objection”) and then resolve it. Conrad’s copy, which
could easily go at the end of my ad, would then contribute to re-
solving the problem.

After reading my version of the ad, you would leave with
a  positive  feeling  about  both  the  company  and  the  message.
You  would  think,  “That  was  a  sincere  effort  to  dispel  those
false impressions on the safety of the DC-10.” The message is
an  emotional  presentation  that  shows  concern,  integrity  and
leadership.

Now compare that with the way the ad was originally writ-
ten,  which  might  have  left  you  with  the  sarcastic  impression,
“Sure it’s a safe plane. . . .” Or maybe, “They are just trying to
cover themselves from all the heat they’ve been taking.”

Keep in mind that the copy they had was very good. They
just left off the entire front end of the ad and were avoiding the
real issue—the events that actually happened that prompted their
ad.  They  just  spent  most  of  their  copy  resolving  the  objection
without acknowledging and addressing it directly.

235

P R O V I N G   T H E   P O I N T S — A D   E X A M P L E S

The lesson to be learned here is to realize the importance
of  raising  an  objection,  regardless  of  how  embarrassing  or
detrimental it may seem, and then doing your best to resolve it.
You’ll ﬁnd that the public really appreciates your candor, honesty
and  frankness  and  will  respond  to  your  message  in  a  positive
way, whether it be to buy your product, to develop a good feel-
ing about your company or, as in the case of the DC-10, to re-
store conﬁdence in an airplane.

236

A More Stimulating Way Chapter 27

Even if you never wrote a piece of copy in your life,
one look at this ad from Sony Video Communications
and you would feel pretty much like the cartoon char-
acter shown in it. You’d feel like falling asleep.

The advertising agency that created this ad prob-
ably  thought  they  had  a  very  clever  idea. Their  con-
cept—show  the  contrast  between  typical  types  of
boring  communications  and  a  new,  more  stimulating
video presentation (new back in the mid-1970s when
this ad appeared).

In keeping with the theme, the headline in the ad
was  inadvertently  boring  in  that  it  was  hard  to  read
with its dense capitalized type. The ad layout was bor-
ing. And ﬁnally, the copy was monotonous and did not
follow  many  of  my  principles.  So  whoever  created
this ad was certainly being consistent with the theme
in their presentation. It was boring.

But being consistent while going in the wrong direction is
not a great strategy, either. Very few people would want to read a
boring  ad.  There  are  thousands  of  ad  messages  out  there  on  a
daily basis, and to stand out you need a message that grabs peo-
ple’s attention and causes them to read your entire ad. And to get
them to read your entire ad, you must use many of the techniques
I’ve presented throughout this book, even if the ad you are creat-
ing is not a mail order ad.

In the Sony ad they are ﬁrst trying to sell the concept of us-
ing  video  and  then  of  using  Sony  video,  once  they  have  con-
vinced their reader to try this new medium. My approach would
have been to create a story of somebody who switched to video
and saw a dramatic beneﬁt—more sales, greater productivity or
more awareness.

Here are the ﬁrst few paragraphs to give you the sense of

The theme of
this ad was
“boring.” They
accomplished
their goal.

237

P R O V I N G   T H E   P O I N T S — A D   E X A M P L E S

how the copy ﬂowed. The ad had no subheadline, no cartoon cap-
tion and started out with a very long and boring ﬁrst sentence.

Every  day,  American  business  spews  forth  a  virtually  endless
stream of inter-ofﬁce memos, conference reports, training manu-
als, brochures, telexes, phone calls, slide shows, letters, telegrams,
direct mail pieces, annual reports, press releases and newsletters.
The average employee is deluged with communication.
And there is no way of telling how much of it is either ignored,
forgotten, misplaced or summarily disposed of.
In short, American business is in the throes of a vast and complex
communication crisis.
A problem that today—in an age of shortened attention spans and
heightened communications costs—cries out for an efﬁcient and
imaginative solution.

The ﬁrst sentence is too long and the copy is boring. But then

again, isn’t “boring” the theme of the ad? (I’m being facetious.)

The ad then tells how video is being used and what Sony
has to offer the new and emerging industry. If you thought the
ﬁrst  few  paragraphs  were  boring,  so  was  the  rest  of  the  copy.
And since I get bored typing it into my computer for this book,
I’m  not  going  to  include  any  more  for  you  to  read.  Just  trust
me—it was boring.

Chances  are,  unless  you  were  totally  interested  in  video
communications and were actively searching for everything you
could  ﬁnd  on  the  subject,  you  wouldn’t  even  consider  reading
the entire ad.

And here’s my ﬁnal point. The ad was created by a profes-
sional ad agency using professional copywriters, layout artists and
art directors. After reading this book, you could act as a consultant
to that ad agency and improve its advertising by 1,000 percent and
you may not even be a professional anything. The ability to write
good advertising copy is not limited exclusively to professionals.
Often even the most inexperienced person can write an incredibly
effective ad. And certainly after reading this book, you can criti-
cize even the most professionally prepared ads.

238

Magic Baloney Chapter 28

This JS&A mail order ad for the Magic Stat thermostat
basically tells a story but with a unique twist. The story
starts out with us hating the product, and then as the story
unfolds, the product takes a quantum leap in our approval
to become the best product on the planet. How I get there
is an interesting process.

First I realized that the number one drawback in pur-
chasing a thermostat is the installation. It’s not one of those
things that consumers relate to. It could be dangerous han-
dling all those wires and there’s a lot of extra expense in
having an installer put one in. So one of the ﬁrst good fea-
tures we ﬁnally like in our story is the ease of installation.
In short, we recognize that consumers don’t like to be both-
ered with installation and we hit this feature early in the ad.
The copy itself raises many objections—the case de-
sign, the look of it and even the name. We realized that
these  would  be  some  of  the  same  objections  consumers  would
raise  when  they  looked  at  the  product. And  we  resolved  them
one by one as we ﬂoated through the copy.

A good portion of the copy explained in a light sort of way
the features of the product. And then near the end we built up the
company selling us the product to add credibility and make the
consumer feel more secure. Our competition, after all, was Hon-
eywell—a company with an established name and reputation.

The Magic Stat ad ran in print for almost three years start-
ing in 1983 and made the product into a very successful brand
name. The company eventually was sold to Honeywell.
The following is the complete text of the ad:

Headline: Magic Baloney
Subheadline: You’ll love the way we hated the Magic Stat ther-
mostat until an amazing thing happened.

I brought out the
worst aspects of
this product and
turned them
around.

239

P R O V I N G   T H E   P O I N T S — A D   E X A M P L E S

Caption:  It  had  no  digital  readout,  an  ugly  case  and  a  stupid
name. It almost made us sick.
Copy: You’re probably expecting our typical sales pitch, but get
ready for a shock. For instead of trying to tell you what a great
product the Magic Stat thermostat is, we’re going to tear it apart.
Unmercifully.
When we ﬁrst saw the Magic Stat, we took one look at the name
and went, “Yuck.” We took one look at the plastic case and said,
“How cheap looking.” And when we looked for the digital read-
out, it had none. So before the salesman even showed us how it
worked, we were totally turned off.

REAL LOSER
So there it was—at ﬁrst blush a real loser. But wait, we did ﬁnd
one good feature—a feature that led us to a discovery. The Magic
Stat  installs  in  a  few  minutes  and  no  serviceman  is  required.
Thermostat  wires  in  your  wall  follow  standard  color  codes.  So
when you install Magic Stat, you attach the red wire to the red lo-
cation and the white to the white. That’s play school stuff. And
it’s  safe.  Conventional  thermostats  installed  over  the  past  20
years are generally only 24 volts, so you can either turn off the
power or work with the “live” wires without fear.

OK, LET’S TEST IT
The Magic Stat installation was so easy that the least we could do
was test it. And that’s when we made an incredible discovery. We
discovered that the Magic Stat was probably the most consumer-
oriented, technologically-advanced and most sophisticated ther-
mostat ever developed on the face of this earth and in our galaxy
for all times ever. What made us switch from hating the thing to
loving it? Read the following:
The Magic Stat has six setback settings per day and a seven day
program. That means that you could set it for 70 degrees when
you  get  up  in  the  morning,  drop  the  temperature  to  54  degrees
when you go to work, raise it to 68 degrees when you return for
dinner, raise it up to 70 degrees after dinner as you watch TV and
then  drop  it  down  to  62  degrees  when  you  go  to  sleep.  Count
them—ﬁve settings with one to spare.
In one day the Magic Stat is programmed for the whole week and
for the weeks to come. If you want a different schedule for week-
ends,  you  can  individually  program  the  thermostat  for  those
days,  too.  “Big  deal,”  you  might  think.  “What’s  so  great  about
that?” Read on.
You set most electronic setback thermostats to the time you want
the furnace to go on in the morning, so when you wake up, your
room  is  once  again  warm.  But  what  if  one  morning  it’s  bitter

240

M A G I C   B A L O N E Y

cold  outside  and  the  next  morning  it’s  much  warmer?  This
means that setting your furnace to go on at the same time may,
on one morning, leave you cold and on the next morning cause
you to waste energy by warming up your house too soon.
By  golly,  the  Magic  Stat  has  everybody  beat  on  this  one  too.
Throughout the night it senses and computes the drop in temper-
ature  and  the  time  it  will  take  to  get  your  room  to  your  exact
wake-up temperature. So if you want to wake up at 7 AM to 70
degrees—that’s  the  temperature  you’ll  wake  up  to  every  time.
Because it’s a patented concept, no other thermostat has this fea-
ture. But wait. There is also a patent on the setting feature.

SIMPLE TO SET
To  set  the  thermostat,  you  press  just  one  button. A small  LED
light  scans  the  temperature  scale  until  you  reach  your  desired
temperature and then you release the button. You change the tem-
perature naturally, throughout the day, up to six times. The unit
responds  and  remembers  that  exact  living  pattern.  The  present
temperature is displayed by a glowing red LED on the scale.
The  system  also  computes  the  ideal  length  the  furnace  should
stay on to keep the temperature within a range of plus or minus
one  and  one-half  degrees. A battery  backup  lets  you  keep  your
stored program in its memory so power outages as long as eight
hours won’t let your unit forget. And if something happens and
your  power  is  out  for  a  few  days,  the  unit  will  automatically
maintain 68 degrees when the power is restored.
Quite frankly, we were so impressed with the unit, its ease of in-
stallation  and  setting  plus  its  many  energy-saving  features,  we
seriously considered advertising it until we realized that our cus-
tomers would probably not want to trust their future comfort to a
product called Magic Stat. What if something went wrong with
the unit? How substantial was this Magic Stat outﬁt? Remember,
a  thermostat  is  something  you  live  with  as  long  as  you  live  in
your  home,  and  they’re  supposed  to  last  ages.  After  all,  your
comfort depends on it.
Well,  we  did  our  homework.  We  found  the  company  to  be  a
sound,  well-ﬁnanced  organization.  They  have  been  in  business
for several years, and they back their products with a three-year
limited warranty. In addition, the company has a policy of buying
back your unit in one year if you haven’t saved its full cost in en-
ergy savings. We were satisﬁed with the company, the people, the
product,  its  incredible  features,  the  company’s  commitment  to
the product and above all, the energy savings.
We are so impressed now with the Magic Stat that we’re going
to make buying one irresistible. Buy one from us for only $79.

Install it yourself in a few minutes or hire a handyman to install it.
Or order the new deluxe unit for $99 with the exact same features
as the regular model, but with a beautiful new case.
Then enjoy the savings this next winter. Not only will you save
up to 30% on your heating bills, but you’re eligible for the 15%
energy tax credit. Then if you’re not absolutely in love with this
product  one  year  later,  return  it  to  JS&A.  You’ll  get  all  your
money back and you can reinstall your old thermostat.

REALIZE SAVINGS
But we’re counting on a few things. First, you will realize an en-
ergy savings and a comfort that will far surpass what you are cur-
rently  experiencing.  Secondly,  you  probably  will  sleep  better
breathing cooler air yet wake up to just the right temperature.
Beauty  is  only  skin  deep  and  a  name  doesn’t  really  mean  that
much.  But  we  sure  wish  those  guys  at  Magic  Stat  would  have
named their unit something more impressive. Maybe something
like Twinkle Temp.

The ad drew your attention and brought you into the copy
with the way I knocked the product. Your question might have
been, “What’s the gimmick? Why is he knocking the product?”

You started to read the ad. And then you discovered the one
feature  that  we  liked,  which  happened  to  be  installation—the
most difﬁcult obstacle we had to overcome in selling this product.
From then on selling the Magic Stat was all downhill as if
on a slippery slide. Once we had the product installed, we could
then discover its great features, raise and resolve the remaining
objections  (the  name  and  the  appearance)  and  then  sell  all  the
product’s beneﬁts. And indeed we did for more than three years.

Pet Plane Chapter 29

At JS&A we had three corporate aircraft. Like having
a lot of cars, you can ﬂy only one airplane at a time. So
I  decided  to  get  rid  of  the  plane  I  used  the  least—my
Aerostar.

I paid close to $240,000 for it and everybody told
me  that  it  was  now  worth  only  $190,000  at  best.  I
couldn’t believe this ﬁne aircraft had dropped so much
in  value,  so  I  decided  to  take  out  a  single  ad  in  the
AOPA Pilot—one of the private pilot magazines—and
ﬁnd out if I could get my asking price.

The  basic  format  of  the  ad  was  a  story  about  my
lack of use of the airplane and my concern for our me-
chanic/pilot Dave. And I use the story to weave in all the
good features of the plane. Then, at the end, to add a little
humor, I offered to give away a small steer to anybody
who buys the plane. I ﬁnished the ad with a classic end-
ing.  In  this  ad  the  humor  worked.  My Aerostar  sold  quickly  for
$240,000—I got back exactly what I paid for it minus the cost of
the  ad,  around  $5,000.  It  was  well  worth  the  effort.  Humor  can
work if it is done in a friendly sort of way. In essence I was poking
fun at myself, but the serious message of the ad didn’t get over-
looked. And, remember, I only needed to sell one to break even.

I bought 296PA in April of 1978. It was one of the last ones pro-
duced  by  Ted  Smith  before  Piper  bought  the  company.  I  also
hired a full-time mechanic, Dave, who did nothing but keep the
ship gleaming and in perfect ﬂying condition.

They said I’d
never get my
asking price,
but it took only
one customer.

243

P R O V I N G   T H E   P O I N T S — A D   E X A M P L E S

Instead  of  ﬂying  the Aerostar,  Dave  and  I  ended  up  ﬂying  the
other corporate planes—our Grumman Tiger and our Beechcraft
Bonanza—while the Aerostar was hangared, polished and look-
ing pretty.
In two full years, Dave and I have only put 350 hours on our pet
plane—a lot less time than can justify owning this ﬁne ship.

DAVE IS A FARMER
Dave is also a farmer. In his early years he plowed the ﬁelds and
milked  cows  at  his  parents’ farm  in  Illinois.  Dave  has  always
loved the farm—almost as much as Dave loves ﬂying.
In July of this year, Dave and I were talking. We weren’t using
the Aerostar enough to justify keeping it, yet Dave, a loyal, hard-
working and excellent mechanic, would not have enough to keep
him busy to continue working for JS&A if we sold it and he only
had the other two planes to work on.
I personally love ﬂying too. I am an instrument-rated commercial
pilot with a multi-engine rating. Unlike Dave, I was born in the
big city. I didn’t know what it was like to raise crops or work on
a farm.

DAVE GETS THE WORD
I sat Dave down and told him that I was planning to sell 296PA
and I asked him if he wouldn’t mind going back to the farm. My
idea was simply to buy a farm with the proceeds from the sale of
the Aerostar, put in a landing strip and a small hangar, and Dave
and his family could raise crops while he wasn’t working on the
other two planes.
Dave loved the idea, so I decided to part with our Aerostar and
offer it for sale in this advertisement.
296PA is a fully pressurized light twin that gets an amazing 28
gallons per hour at a realistic cruise speed of 200 knots. It was
aerodynamically  designed  to  take  jet  engines,  but  its  designer
settled  for  two  290  HP Lycoming  engines  which  provide  great
speed and fuel efﬁciency.

ADVANCED AVIONICS
The avionics on the airplane remind me of many of the ﬁne prod-
ucts  our  company  sells.  The  fully  computerized  Bendix  2000
system  includes  radar,  R-Nav,  DME,  a  radar  altimeter  plus  all
the goodies we could possibly put on the beautiful panel. There’s
an auxiliary hydraulic pump, surface de-ice plus a ﬂight phone.
The plane had to be fully equipped—after all, my reputation de-
manded it.
A comparably  equipped  1980 Aerostar  currently  sells  for  over
$350,000 and doesn’t look nearly as pretty.

244

P E T   P L A N E

Our  Aerostar  was  a  Ted  Smith  original—built  by  dedicated
craftsmen who took great pride in their work. But with any new
plane,  there  are  always  small  bugs  that  surface.  The  JS&A
Aerostar is so debugged that we doubt you’ll see one soon. Dave
spent an enormous amount of time tightening, greasing, cleaning
and examining every system in the plane. In addition to 100 hour
inspections, Dave conducted 50 hour inspections. In addition to
yearly  inspections,  Dave  conducted  semi-annual  inspections.
And  if  I  mentioned  I  heard  a  strange  creak  on  the  plane,  Dave
would be there for days decreaking the plane.
In  short,  296PA is  a  beautiful,  fully-equipped  airplane  that  has
been hangared and well taken care of for its short two-year life.
And it’s for sale.
JS&A is offering our 601P for only $240,000 complete (sales tax
has already been paid on the plane) plus no postage or handling.
It’s a genuine bargain that really has to be seen to be appreciated.
Dave  hangars  the  plane  at  the  Waukegan  airport,  north  of
Chicago, and would be happy to arrange a showing. Simply call
our toll-free number below to set up an appointment.
If  you’re  not  interested  in  our Aerostar  but  would  like  one  of
our most recent catalogs, call us on our toll-free number or drop
us a line too. JS&A is America’s largest single source of space-
age  products  and  I’d  be  anxious  to  have  fellow  pilots  as  our
customers.
Dave has been looking at a lot of farms lately and is really ex-
cited about getting back into farming. And, of course, I’m anx-
ious to sell my Aerostar so I could own a farm and keep a loyal
employee happy and productive.
And  if  somebody  purchases  my Aerostar  from  this  ad,  I’ll  also
throw in, free of charge, a steer from our new farm. After all, as
any airplane salesman will tell you, it’s hard to sell a plane with-
out a little bull. Call early and see my Aerostar, today.

As  I  mentioned,  the  plane  sold  very  quickly. And  for  the
asking price. It was only later, after a call from the FBI, that I
discovered  the  plane  was  used  for  running  drugs  from  South
America and had been conﬁscated.

Mail Order Mansion Chapter 30

After my success with the airplane, I had a chance to
really push the mail order envelope. Could I sell a $6
million home? The exposure might ﬁnd one buyer—
just as it did with my airplane—and all I needed was
one buyer.

So in 1987 I created the ad as a complete story
almost all the way to the end. The marketing strategy
was to offer the house or a video. If the house didn’t
sell,  maybe  I  would  sell  enough  videos  to  cover  the
space costs. But I didn’t sell enough videos and the ad
was a loss, as the house did not sell, either.

Headline: Mail Order Mansion
Caption: It looked like a setup to me.
Subheadline:  It’s  only  6  million  dollars  and  comes
complete  with  swimming  pool,  tennis  court  and  a
breathtaking view.
Byline: By Joseph Sugarman
Copy: Have I got a deal. And even if you don’t buy this home,
you’ll love the story.
It all started with an invitation. I was invited by one of the top real
estate developers in the country to attend a party at his home in
Malibu, California. I didn’t know why. All the developer would
say is, “Just come.”
The jet was waiting for me at O’Hare Airport in Chicago and his
chauffeur-driven limousine met me at Los Angeles for the drive
to Malibu. It was class all the way.
When I drove up to the home, there was a party going on. Rolls-
Royces were lined up everywhere and the noise and music from
the house made it clear that something special was going on.

VERY FAMOUS GUESTS
After I entered and was introduced to the host and his wife, they
took me around and introduced me to some of their guests. “This

is Joe Sugarman, that famous mail order copywriter who writes
all those interesting mail order ads.”
I  met  a  famous  movie  star,  a  nationally  famous  sports  broad-
caster, a soap opera TV star, a few famous baseball players and
two famous California politicians. I recognized everybody and a
few even knew who I was. In fact, some of them were my cus-
tomers. But why was I there? I still didn’t know.
I had a chance to look around the house. Now I’ve seen beautiful
homes in my life but this one had to be the most impressive I’ve
ever seen. First, it was on top of a 90 foot bluff overlooking a sandy
beach and the Paciﬁc Ocean. Secondly, it was night and I could see
the entire shoreline of Los Angeles. It was as if I were on a cruise
ship at sea and I could look over the Paciﬁc and back at the city.
Then I recognized the cliff. Was this the site of the most publi-
cized wedding in show business where seven helicopters hovered
above taking pictures? I found out later that it was.
The home took complete advantage of the view. Practically every
room  faced  the  ocean.  And  the  sliding  glass  doors  completely
opened so you had an unobstructed view of the ocean—no parti-
tions, no supporting beams.
The  sound  that  ﬁlled  the  house  with  music  ﬁrst  appeared  to  be
live. But later I found that the home had the best acoustics ever
designed into a personal residence with a sound system that ri-
valed a recording studio. And what a personal residence.
There  was  a  sunken  tennis  court,  a  swimming  pool,  whirlpool
bath and solid state electronic lighting system that was controlled
from any place in the house. The ceilings were 25 feet high and
the interior decor was so tastefully done that I could easily under-
stand why it won all sorts of awards. But why was I here? Why
were all my expenses paid for? Then I found out.
The developer and his wife set me up in one of the ﬁve bedrooms
and after the guests had left invited me into the living room. “Joe,
the reason we’ve invited you here is that we want you to write an
advertisement  to  sell  our  house.  You’re  one  of  the  nation’s  top
copywriters, and since this house is an award-winning world-class
residence, we wanted a world-class copywriter to do it justice.”
Now I’ll admit, I was ﬂattered. “But I’m a mail order copywriter.
How could I possibly sell a house this expensive?”

VERY SPECIAL
“Easy,” replied the developer. “By its value. This property is very
special. It’s on a peninsula that sticks out of the curved part that
faces Los Angeles. When you look from the cliff you see Los An-
geles as if it were rising out of the ocean. And because we are on

248

M A I L   O R D E R   M A N S I O N

a point, we do not get the harsh winds off the ocean but rather
gentle  breezes  all  year  long.  The  property  itself  is  so  valuable
that our next door neighbor paid close to 9 million dollars for his
one bedroom house.”
I was starting to feel uneasy. “I’m sorry, but there’s no way I can
sell your home. I refuse to write anything except under my own
company name. And I’m not in the real estate business.” But the
developer persisted.
“Joe, you really can be. This house is an investment. There’s a lot
of foreign money out there. And all it takes is that special person
looking for a celebrity-status world-class home on one of the best
sites in America and presto, it’s sold.”

FINAL REFUSAL
I  refused  and  it  was  my  ﬁnal  refusal.  “I’m  sorry,  I  cannot  sell
anything  without  a  30  day  return  privilege.  My  customers  all
have the opportunity to return anything we sell them for a prompt
and courteous refund. And then there’s the credit card issue. We
make it easy for them to purchase with either Master Card, Visa
or American Express.”
Well, the rest is history. I am indeed offering the house for sale.
Please  call  me  at  (312)  564-7000  and  arrange  for  a  personal
showing. Then I urge you to buy it. We accept Visa, Master Card,
American Express, American dollars, Japanese Yen or any nego-
tiable hard currency.
After you buy the home, live in it for 30 days. Enjoy the spectacular
view, walk on the beautiful beaches, experience the spacious living.
If, after 30 days, you aren’t completely satisﬁed, return the home to
the original owner for a prompt and courteous refund.
The  developer  and  his  wife  are  thrilled  that  I  am  selling  their
home. They realize that the mail order business is a lot different
than the real estate business and are willing to compromise. But
don’t you compromise. If you truly are one of those rare people
in search of a spectacular home on the best location in America,
call me personally at no obligation, today.
PS: If you don’t have time for the showing, please order a video
tape  of  the  home.  (Please  refer  to  product  number  7077YE.)

As I mentioned, the house did not sell. And, as a matter of
fact,  we  didn’t  sell  enough  videos  to  break  even,  either.  But
that was part of the risk I was willing to take. We did get a lot

of publicity from the ad including an invitation to appear on the
David Letterman show, which I declined.

I also got a call from the Disney estate asking me if I would
sell  Walt  Disney’s  old  home  in  the  same  fashion  I  offered  the
Mail  Order  Mansion.  I  didn’t  accept  the  opportunity,  as  one
crazy real estate ad was enough for me.

Hungarian Conspiracy Chapter 31

Some  of  my  ads  were  never  even  published.  Others
were  not  that  successful  and  some  appeared  only  in
our catalog. From this last group I have selected one
that I felt struck out in a very unique direction and had
an  interesting  story.  Hungarian  Conspiracy  appeared
only in our catalog and was moderately successful. It
was, however, one of my favorites.

I actually traveled to Hungary, did all the photogra-
phy in Budapest and even met with Professor Erno Ru-
bik, the inventor of Rubik’s Cube—a three-dimensional
puzzle  in  the  shape  of  a  cube  that  was  a  fad  in  the
early 1980s.

What  was  unique  in  this  ad  was  the  message.
Consumers were urged not to buy the product through
a tongue-in-cheek explanation of why purchasing one
could cause another major recession. It is only in the last para-
graph of the ad that I actually offer the product for sale.

Keep in mind that when this was written in 1983, we still
had the Berlin Wall and the Soviet Union with all the associated
paranoia.

The environment created in the ad for the product is both a
story and a tease. “What’s the gimmick here if they aren’t selling
the product?” is one of the questions you might ask yourself as
you slowly slip through the copy. And you don’t get the answer
until the very last paragraph. What do you think of the ad copy?

BUDAPEST (JS&A)—Reporters have smuggled intelligence re-
ports out of Hungary on a conspiracy that may have far-reaching
consequences for all Americans.
In  the  coming  year,  Hungarians  will  be  shipping  to  the  United
States, via Hong Kong, a game with the code name “XL-25.”
The game at ﬁrst may look innocuous—a typical electronic game
that could come from Mattel, or any of the other big electronic
game manufacturers. But beware. Whatever you do, don’t buy it.

MASSIVE CONSPIRACY
The game is part of a massive conspiracy to weaken the United
States  by  destroying  our  productive  work  force  and  eventually
putting the entire free world into a major depression. Here’s what
we’ve discovered.
In  1980  when  Erno  Rubik,  the  Budapest  University  professor,
unleashed the now famous Rubik’s Cube, the United States econ-
omy was growing at a nice clip. Shortly after the cube was intro-
duced,  America  entered  into  a  major  recession.  Our  gross
national product dropped, factories started laying off people by
the thousands and the economy took a big nosedive.
The exact reasons for the recession are varied, but our theory is
quite simple. JS&A contends that millions of Americans were so
busy twisting that small cube that they were not paying attention
to their jobs. Productivity dropped, proﬁts plunged and consumer
spending fell to new lows.
It was obvious to Russian intelligence sources that the cause of
the American recession was the Rubik’s Cube. The Russians rea-
soned that if the Hungarians could invent games and then ﬂood
the American market with them, they could cause a massive de-
pression—one  that  would  permanently  weaken  America  thus
making  us  easy  targets  for  a  communist  takeover.  If  you  think
this theory is farfetched, please read on.

THANK YOU
Hungarians  everywhere,  proud  of  the  huge  success  of  the  Ru-
bik’s Cube, were now inspired. Hungarians are quite a creative
bunch  to  start  with.  They  were  responsible  for  such  things  as
glass ﬁber optics, the micro ﬂoppy disk and the science of holog-

252

H U N G A R I A N   C O N S P I R A C Y

raphy.  Hungary  always  had  creative  people,  but  their  potential
was never really unleashed until Rubik.
The  Hungarian  government  wanted  to  not  only  encourage  this
pent-up creativity, but help Hungary develop their game industry
for speciﬁc communist purposes.
A new private company was set up last year for the sole purpose
of developing computer games for the American market. Funded
by  banks  and  run  by  successful  Budapest  business  types,  the
company developed the XL-25 through the efforts of three game
designers shown to the left.
The bearded communist shown in the picture is Laszlo Mero, 33,
a  winner  of  the  1968  International  Mathematical  Student
Olympiad held in Moscow. He’s bright, intelligent and one of the
top puzzle and game designers in Hungary.

AUTO PARTS DEALER
The man in the middle is Thomas Kovacs, a Hungarian auto parts
dealer. At least that’s what our investigators turned up. We sus-
pect auto parts is only a front.
The man to the left is Ferenc Szatmari, a physicist and a real ge-
nius. He graduated from the University of Budapest with a doc-
torate degree in elementary particle physics.
The incredible game they invented and the one we must stop from
being sold in this country is quite fascinating. The XL-25 is an elec-
tronic game with ﬁve rows of ﬁve squares or 25 squares in all. Each
square is actually a button with a built-in light-emitting diode.
When you start, lights light up under ﬁve of the buttons. The ob-
ject of the puzzle is to get all the lights under the buttons to light
up. But there’s a catch, and here’s where the frustration comes in.
Each time you press a button, the four buttons immediately sur-
rounding the button you push change state. If they’re lit, they
go off. If they’re off, they’ll go on. If you’re a little confused, it
doesn’t  matter  anyway.  Just  remember  that  the  object  of  the
game is to get all the buttons to light up with the least number
of keystrokes.
The unit counts the number of button entries and you can ask the
XL-25 what your score is and still return to your game.
Once you try the XL-25, you’ll be immediately sucked into the
Hungarian conspiracy. But don’t worry. You’re in good company.
Texas Instruments was so impressed with its design that they de-
veloped the integrated circuit. A group in Hong Kong became so
obsessed with it that they built the game with the quality you’d
expect from a Mattel or Atari game.

Quite frankly, we were so hooked that we bought thousands and
even  dispatched  a  reporter  to  Budapest  where  we  made  our
shocking intelligence discovery.

YOU CAN HELP
So there’s the story. A communist game, whose circuit was de-
signed by a good ol’ American company, carefully assembled by
one of our best friends in the Far East—all part of a massive con-
spiracy to prepare Americans for a major communist takeover.
Prevent other Americans from falling into this scam. Order a unit
from  JS&A. When  you  receive  it,  whatever  you  do,  don’t  play
with  it.  Instead,  immediately  take  it  to  all  your  neighbors  and
urge them not to buy one. Tell them about the real cause of our
last recession, the communist plot and the Hungarian conspiracy.
And then make sure you give them the ultimate warning. “Any-
body who buys this thing is a real idiot.”

This  was  a  really  good  example  of  pushing  the  envelope.
The ad copy was strong enough to get my prospects to read all
the copy and hopefully the curiosity was strong enough to cause
them  to  purchase  the  product.  Even  if  I  did  call  anybody  who
bought one an idiot.

Vision Breakthrough Chapter 32

The Vision  Breakthrough  advertisement  was  among
the  most  successful  in  my  company’s  history,  so  it
merits a close look.

In this ad I did not want to present the product as
another pair of sunglasses, so I presented it as a vision
breakthrough that protects you from the harmful rays of
the sun. It was one of the ﬁrst ads that provided a real
educational  message  about  the  dangers  of  ultraviolet
(UV) rays on the eyes. Before this ad ran, there was re-
ally nothing in the popular press about UV ray damage.
The approach I used was to tell the story of how I
discovered the glasses and all the facts I learned about
them as well as the sun’s light. I did it in a simple yet
powerful way.

I  also  used  a  tremendous  dose  of  curiosity.  You
can’t experience the pair unless you personally try them
on. Thus, you must buy them to satisfy your curiosity.

The BluBlocker advertising campaign was a major success
that started with this print ad in 1986 and continued on television
for several years. Today BluBlocker is a recognized brand name
that is sold in retail stores throughout the country.

on  an  enhanced  3-D  effect. And  it’s  not  my  imagination.  I  just
want you to see for yourself.”

COULDN’T BELIEVE EYES
When I received the sunglasses and put them on I couldn’t be-
lieve my eyes. I kept taking them off and putting them on to see
if what I was seeing was indeed actually sharper or if my imagi-
nation was playing tricks on me. But my vision improved. It was
obvious. I kept putting on my $100 pair of sunglasses and com-
paring them. They didn’t compare. I was very impressed. Every-
thing  appeared  sharper,  more  deﬁned  and  indeed  had  a  greater
three  dimensional  look  to  it.  But  what  did  this  product  do  that
made my vision so much better? I found out.
The sunglasses (called BluBlockers) ﬁlter out the ultraviolet and
blue spectrum light waves from the sun. Blue rays have one of
the  shortest  wavelengths  in  the  visible  spectrum  (red  is  the
longest). As a result, the color blue will focus slightly in front of
the retina, which is the “focusing screen” in our eye. By blocking
the blue from the sunlight through a special ﬁltration process and
only  letting  those  rays  through  that  indeed  focus  clearly  on  the
retina, objects appear to be sharper and clearer.
The second reason is even more impressive. It is harmful to have
ultraviolet rays fall on our eyes. Recognized as bad for skin, UV
light is worse for eyes and is believed to play a role in many of
today’s eye diseases.

SUNGLASS DANGER
But what really surprised me was the danger in conventional sun-
glasses. Our pupils close in bright light to limit the light entering
the eye and open wider at night like the lens of an automatic cam-
era.  So  when  we  put  on  sunglasses,  although  we  reduce  the
amount of light that enters our eyes, our pupils open wider and we
allow more of the harmful blue and ultraviolet light into our eyes.

DON’T BE CONFUSED
I’m often asked by people who read this, “Do those BluBlock-
ers really work?” They really do and please give me the op-
portunity to prove it. I guarantee each pair of BluBlockers to
perform exactly as I described.

BluBlocker sunglasses use Malenium™ lenses with a hard anti-
scratch coating. No shortcuts were taken.

The  black,  lightweight  frame  is  one  of  the  most  comfortable  I
have ever worn and will comfortably contour to any size face. It
compares with many of the $200 pairs you can buy from France
or Italy.
There is a clip-on pair that weighs less than one ounce and ﬁts
over  prescription  lenses. All  models  include  a  padded  carrying
case and a one-year limited warranty.
I  urge  you  to  order  a  pair  and  experience  your  improved  vision.
Then take your old sunglasses and compare them to the BluBlocker
sunglasses. See how much clearer and sharper objects appear with
the BluBlocker pair. And see if your night vision doesn’t improve
as a direct result. If you don’t see a dramatic difference in your
vision—one  so  noticeable  that  you  can  tell  immediately—then
send  them  back  anytime  within  30  days  and  I  will  send  you  a
prompt and courteous refund.

DRAMATIC DIFFERENCE
But from what I’ve personally witnessed, once you wear a pair,
there will be no way you’ll want to return it.
Our eyes are very important to us. Protect them and at the same
time improve your vision with the most incredible breakthrough
in sunglasses since they were ﬁrst introduced. Order a pair or two
at no obligation, today.

The  main  feature  of  this  ad  is  the  storytelling  approach,
which  wove  an  educational  message—the  ﬁrst  of  its  kind.  It
brought the awareness of the dangers of sunlight to the attention
of the public who were unaware of these dangers.

In  addition,  it  launched  the  BluBlocker  brand  name  and
created a new business, which continues to this day over 20 years
later. It is a perfect example of the power of the pen—the same
power you will have upon completion of this book.

Gold Space Chains Chapter 33

T his  was  the  ad  that  created  a  lot  of  controversy
when it appeared in our catalog in 1978. A number of
women complained vehemently. It is a good example
of the insensitivity to women’s issues that I had at the
time. But, hey. I’m human and I learned.

I also received a lot of mail congratulating me on
the incredible piece of copy that I had written. So for
its controversial response and for the sake of present-
ing some interesting and entertaining copy, I have in-
cluded it here.

Another interesting factor was the timing of this
ad. When we placed it in our catalog, prices for gold
were pretty low. Right after the ad appeared, the price
of gold skyrocketed, the response grew like crazy and
we sold out. So it proved to be quite a successful ad,
too—but probably due to the serendipity of our timing.

Notice  the  use  of  the  editorial  “we”  in  the  ad  copy.  It
would  have  been  more  personal  had  I  used  the  word  “I”  in-
stead. Also see if there is one place in the ad that might offend
a woman currently employed in a primarily male job category.

This controversial
ad was a complete
departure from our
normal offerings.

Headline: Gold Space Chains
Subheadline: Dress her in style for that next trip through outer
space with America’s ﬁrst space-age gold chains.
Copy:  Our  good  friend,  Bob  Ross,  is  one  of  America’s  top
wholesale jewelry representatives.
A few months ago, Bob approached us with a suggestion, “Why
not offer gold chains to your customers?” We rejected the idea,
for our catalog must only contain products that relate to space-
age technology. And besides, it was too late; we had just passed
our deadline.
But Bob persisted, “Most of your readers are men. Why not give
them  something  they  could  buy  for  their  wives  or  loved  ones?

259

P R O V I N G   T H E   P O I N T S — A D   E X A M P L E S

After all, you offer them all sorts of neat things to buy for them-
selves, but other than a good watch, there’s nothing for the lady.”
SUGGESTION REJECTED
We could not accept Bob’s argument. Although we have a 90%
male readership, and although we felt that our customers might
indeed  want  to  buy  jewelry  from  our  catalog,  we  felt  that  our
strict adherence to the principles of space-age product selection
precluded our making any variation in our philosophy.
Then Bob tried to appeal to our sense of proﬁt. “Your customers
are wealthy and smart. Offer them gold chains at very low prices.
You’ll sell a ton because they have the money to spend, and they
have the brains to recognize good value.”
Again we had to disappoint Bob. True, our customers earn an av-
erage of $50,000 a year, higher than practically any other buying
group  in  the  country. And  true,  our  customers  include  some  of
the nation’s leading businessmen, politicians, newscasters, doc-
tors, and even movie stars. But we could not justify the violation
of  our  principles  and  take  advantage  of  an  opportunity  just  be-
cause  our  customers  are  above  average.  “Sorry  Bob,”  we  said.
“JS&A has an important reputation to maintain.”

HE DOESN’T GIVE UP
Bob  is  quite  a  successful  salesman.  He  never  gives  up  until  he
has exhausted all arguments. A good salesman is persistent, and
Bob certainly persisted. He just wouldn’t give up.
“Why don’t you call the gold chains ‘Space Chains’—space-age
jewelry for the lady you want to take on that trip through outer
space? After all, giving it a space-age theme really makes it tie
nicely  into  your  catalog,  and  besides,  gold  is  a  valuable  metal
found on many of the planets in outer space.”
“That would be deceiving,” we told Bob. To think that we could
use  a  ﬂimsy  theme  like  that  to  tie  such  an  unrelated  product  to
space-age technology was almost an insult. It was at this point that
we thought seriously of asking Bob to leave. “Bob, you’re a nice
guy and we’ve known you for years, but you’ll have to leave now.”

ENTER BOB’S COUSIN
But Bob pleaded, “Let me show you one thing before I leave. My
cousin  Joy  is  very  pretty,  and  I’m  sure  she  would  be  happy  to
model the jewelry for you in your advertisement.” Bob then took
a photograph from his wallet and showed it to us.
At this point, Bob had worn out his welcome. We were surprised
to discover that he would stoop so low as to use one of his rela-
tives as a means of getting his products displayed in our catalog.
But then we gave the whole matter some very serious thought.

260

G O L D   S P A C E   C H A I N S

“Actually Bob, space-age jewelry isn’t a bad idea for our catalog.
After all, the only items we have for women are watches. Gold
Space Chains might go very well. Of course we would keep our
prices low to provide some real bargains, and I’m sure our cus-
tomers  would  appreciate  the  convenience  of  being  able  to  buy
such a valuable gift. Bob, can she be at our photographer Tues-
day so we can make our extended deadline?”
“Sure,” said Bob. “But what about the selection?”
“Who  cares  about  the  selection?  Why  don’t  you  just  pick  the
most popular styles in various price ranges, and we’ll have those
photographed too.”
Bob left quickly. He selected the chains and his cousin is shown
above.
We did keep our prices considerably less than any jewelry store
or catalog discount showroom. In fact, if you have a chance, you
might  compare.  Or  compare  them  after  you  receive  the  chains.
14 carat gold makes a nice gift for any lady and with our space-
age theme, what a combination!
Bob’s a funny guy. He probably thinks he’s quite a salesman. Ac-
tually, if it weren’t for our open-mindedness, our keen ability to
recognize outstanding new space-age-oriented products, and our
compelling  desire  to  satisfy  the  needs  of  our  customers,  Bob
wouldn’t have a chance.
[Prices were then listed for different styles on the order form.]

In the above ad, I mentioned that our customers earn, on av-
erage,  $50,000  a  year.  In  1978  when  this  ad  was  written,  a
$50,000 salary was very high.

Did  you  ﬁnd  the  offending  passages?  What  could  I  have
said that would have made it less offensive without changing the
basic premise of the ad? And what was the premise of the ad?
Let me answer this last question.

The premise of the ad was to introduce a product that had
nothing  to  do  with  our  product  line  and  could  not  be  justiﬁed
as  an  offering  in  our  catalog—unless  we  created  a  very  strong
reason  for  including  it.  The  strong  reason  was  Bob’s  beautiful
cousin, Joy, who agreed to model the jewelry for us. After all, we
were human and Joy was a beautiful girl.

As I mentioned, the ad did quite well but it was primarily
because of the dramatic increase in the price of gold right after
our catalog was published.

Consumers Hero Chapter 34

This ad was one of the best examples of the slippery
slide theory. If you just read the headline, subheadline
and  the  bold  “Impossible-to-trace  Guarantee,”  you
would be compelled to read the ﬁrst sentence.

Once you started to read, you wouldn’t be able to
stop  until  you  reached  the  end  of  the  copy.  It  was  a
highly effective piece of advertising copy that I wrote
in 1976.

This was one of my favorite ads in that it was
not the typical JS&A ad. In the JS&A ads I was the
expert  in  space-age  products.  In  the  Consumers
Hero  ad  I  was  a  consumer  advocate  speaking  the
language  of  the  consumer.  It  showed  that  I  could
write copy for two totally diverse businesses. Each
ad had its own set of expressions and method of de-
livery.  It  was  also  a  good  example  of  relating  in  a
human  way  without  being  humorous.  It  remains  one  of  my
personal favorites.

Headline: HOT
Subheadline: A new consumer concept lets you buy stolen mer-
chandise if you’re willing to take a risk.
Copy: We developed an exciting new consumer marketing con-
cept. It’s called “stealing.” That’s right, stealing!
Now if that sounds bad, look at the facts. Consumers are being
robbed.  Inﬂation  is  stealing  our  purchasing  power.  Our  dollars
are shrinking in value. The poor average consumer is plundered,
robbed and stepped on.
So  the  poor  consumer  tries  to  strike  back.  First,  he  forms  con-
sumer  groups.  He  lobbies  in  Washington.  He  ﬁghts  price  in-
creases. He looks for value.
So we developed our new concept around value. Our idea was to
steal  from  the  rich  companies  and  give  to  the  poor  consumer,
save our environment and maybe, if we’re lucky, make a buck.

Once you started
reading this ad,
you couldn’t
put it down.

263

P R O V I N G   T H E   P O I N T S — A D   E X A M P L E S

A MODERN DAY ROBIN HOOD
To explain our concept, let’s take a typical clock radio retailing
for $39.95 at a major retailer whose name we better not mention
or  we’ll  be  sued.  It  costs  the  manufacturer  $9.72  to  make. The
manufacturer sells the unit to the retailer for $16.

THE UNCLE HENRY PROBLEM
Let’s say that retailer sells the clock radio to your Uncle Henry.
Uncle Henry brings it home, turns it on and it doesn’t work. So
Uncle Henry trudges back to the store to exchange his “lousy rot-
ten” clock radio for a new one that works (“lousy” and “rotten”
are Uncle Henry’s words).
Now, the defective one goes right back to the manufacturer along
with all the other clock radios that didn’t work. And if this major
retail  chain  sells  40,000  clock  radios  with  a  5%  defective  rate,
that’s 2,000 “lousy rotten” clock radios.

CONSUMERS PROTECTED ALREADY
Consumers are protected against ever seeing these products again
because  even  if  the  manufacturer  repairs  them,  he  can’t  recycle
them as new units. He’s got to put a label on the product clearly
stating that it is repaired, not new and if Uncle Henry had his way
the label would also say that the product was “lousy” and “rotten.”
It’s hard enough selling a new clock radio, let alone one that is
used. So the manufacturer looks for somebody willing to buy his
bad product for a super fantastic price. Like $10. But who wants
a clock radio that doesn’t work at any price!
ENTER CONSUMERS HERO
We approach the manufacturer and offer to steal that $39.95 ra-
dio  for  $3  per  unit.  Now  think  of  it.  The  manufacturer  has  al-
ready spent $9.72 to make it, would have to spend another $5 in
labor  to  ﬁx  and  repackage  it,  and  still  would  have  to  mark  the
unit as having been previously used. So he would be better off
selling it to us for $3, taking a small loss and getting rid of his de-
fective merchandise.
Consumers Hero is now sitting with 2,000 “lousy rotten” clock
radios in its warehouse.
Here comes the good part. We take that clock radio, test it, check it
and repair it. Then we life test it, clean it up, replace anything that
makes  the  unit  look  used,  put  a  new  label  on  it  and  presto—a
$39.95 clock radio and it only costs us $3 plus maybe $7 to repair it.
Impossible-to-trace Guarantee
We  guarantee  that  our stolen  products  will  look  like  brand
new merchandise without any trace of previous brand identi-
ﬁcation or ownership.

264

C O N S U M E R S   H E R O

We  take  more  care  in  bringing  that  clock  radio  to  life  than  the
original  manufacturer  took  to  make  it.  We  put  it  through  more
tests, more ﬁne tuning than any repair service could afford. We
get  more  out  of  that  $10  heap  of  parts  and  labor  than  even  the
most  quality-conscious  manufacturer.  And  we  did  our  bit  for
ecology by not wasting good raw materials.

NOW THE BEST PART
We offer that product to the consumer for $20—the same prod-
uct that costs us $3 to steal and $7 to make work. And we make
$10  clear  proﬁt.  But  the  poor  consumer  is  glad  we  made  our
proﬁt because:

1) We provide a better product than the original version.
2) The better product costs one half the retail price.
3) We are nice people.

BUT THERE’S MORE
Because we are so proud of the merchandise we refurbish, we of-
fer a longer warranty. Instead of 90 days (the original warranty),
we offer a ﬁve-year warranty.
So that’s our concept. We recycle “lousy rotten” garbage into su-
per  new  products  with  ﬁve-year  warranties.  We  steal  from  the
rich manufacturers and give to the poor consumer. We work hard
and make a glorious proﬁt.
To make our concept work, we’ve organized a private membership
of quality and price-conscious consumers and we send bulletins to
this membership about the products available in our program.
Items range from microwave ovens to TV sets to clock radios, digi-
tal watches, and stereo sets. There are home appliances from toast-
ers to electric can openers. Discounts generally range between 40
and 70 percent off the retail price. Each product has a considerably
longer warranty than the original one and a two week money-back
trial period. If you are not absolutely satisﬁed, for any reason, return
your purchase within two weeks after receipt for a prompt refund.
Many items are in great abundance but when we only have a few
of  something,  we  select,  at  random,  a  very  small  number  of
members for the mailing. A good example was our $39.95 TV set
(we had 62 of them) or a $1 AM radio (we had 1,257). In short,
we  try  to  make  it  fair  for  everybody  without  disappointing  a
member and returning a check.

EASY TO JOIN
To  join  our  small  membership  group,  simply  write  your  name,
address and phone number on a slip of paper and enclose a check
or  money  order  for  ﬁve  dollars.  Mail  it  to  Consumers  Hero,

You’ll  receive  a  two-year  membership,  regular  bulletins  on  the
products we offer and some surprises we would rather not mention
in  this  advertisement.  But  what  if  you  never  buy  from  us  and
your  two-year  membership  expires.  Fine.  Send  us  just  your
membership  card  and  we’ll  fully  refund  your  ﬁve  dollars  plus
send you interest on your money.
If the consumer ever had a chance to strike back, it’s now. But act
quickly. With  all  this  hot  merchandise  there’s  sure  to  be  some-
thing for you. Join our group and start saving today.

Since the time I wrote the Consumers Hero ad I have written
many  different  ads  for  many  different  companies.  The  point  I
wish to make is simply this: A good copywriter can write to ﬁt
any market. His or her ads can sound very upscale for one client
and then very downscale for the next. Simply by understanding
and applying the principles, one can rise to any copywriting chal-
lenge—through understanding the jargon of the customer and us-
ing the appropriate words that will resonate with that customer.

Nautilus Spelling Sale Chapter 35

Imagine writing an ad with dozens of misspelled words
and bad grammar and running it in the Wall Street Jour-
nal.  That’s  exactly  what  I  did  in  what  was  one  of  my
most unusual advertising approaches.

I was presented with a closeout product. The Nau-
tilus Lower Back machine had stopped selling at retail.
As  a  result,  the  manufacturer,  loaded  with  inventory,
decided to liquidate the entire load to one of the barter
companies in New York.

There  was  only  one  proviso  in  the  closeout  sale.
The manufacturer did not want the product offered at a
discount  because  it  would  embarrass  his  retailers  who
sold customers this product at its full retail price. “If it
had to be advertised, it had to be at the full retail price,”
was the directive from the barter company representa-
tive who called me on the phone.

The product was going to cost me only around $100. And I
could easily sell it for $250 and make a nice proﬁt. But I was be-
ing forced to offer it for $485. If it died at retail, chances were
slim to none that I could sell any at $485.

So I created a novel strategy. I would offer the product at
$500, even more than the full retail price. I would then allow
readers of the ad to circle any misspelled words and I would
give  them  $10  off  the  retail  price  for  each  misspelled  word
they  found.  I  could  then  misspell  25  words  and  sell  the  ma-
chine  for  $250  without  creating  a  problem  with  my  vendor.
Nobody  except  the  buyer  would  know  the  actual  price  each
machine sold for, as it depended on the spelling skills of my
readers.

So in June of 1985, I ran the following ad. I had fun writing
it—purposely misspelling words as well as using bad grammar.

There were 25
misspelled words
in this ad and
some pretty bad
grammar.

267

P R O V I N G   T H E   P O I N T S — A D   E X A M P L E S

Read the ad and see how you would have done in the Nautilus
Spelling Sale.

Headline: Nautilus Spelling Sale
Subheadline: Every mispelled word you ﬁnd in this advertisement
is worth $10 towards the purchase of this popular exercise product.
Bold Copy:
Americans have two weaknesses. The ﬁrst is spelling and the
second is in our lower backs. JS&A intends to do something
about both problems.
Byline: By Joseph Sugarman, President
Copy: This advertisment has several mispelled words. Some of
them  are  intentionally  mispelled  and  others  are  because  my
spelling is pretty lousy. (My grammar’s bad too.)
For every mispelled word you ﬁnd in this advertisment, I’ll re-
duce the price of the product shown here by $10. If you ﬁnd 10
words mispelled, you get $100 off the price. If you ﬁnd 25 words
mispelled, you get $250 off the price. And if you ﬁnd 50 words
mispelled, you get the product for absolutely nothing. Why such
generosity?

TOO COSTLY
Hundreds  of  retailers  throughout  the  country  have  been  selling
the Nautilus Lower Back machine for its full retail price of $485.
Nautilus designed it for the consumer market. Their $3,000 hos-
pital version, used for rehabilitation purposes, was too costly for
the average consumer.
So Nautilus designed one for the home and sold thousands. Then
JS&A got  hold  of  a  few  thousand  and  felt  that  an  entirely  new
market would develope if the unit could sell for $250 or less. But
the manufacturer would obviously be concerned as the machine
would upset those who had sold the unit for its full price.
So by running this special sale and listing the full retail price and
with nobody really knowing what price we’re really offering the
unit for anyway (I told you my grammar wasn’t good), we can
make  everybody  happy—especially  those  of  you  with  good
spelling skills and with lower backs you want to strengthen. The
rules are really quite simple.

THE RULES
Look through this ad trying to ﬁnd several mispelled words. Circle
each  mispelled  word  you  ﬁnd  and  put  the  total  number  of  mis-
pelled words in the circle above. Please don’t correct my grammar.
Then  multiply  the  number  of  mispelled  words  by  $10  and  then
deduct that amount from the $500 price show in this advertisment.

268

N A U T I L U S   S P E L L I N G   S A L E

We promise to deliver a unit to you for the price you earn. But be
careful. If you circle a word that is not mispelled, we reserve the
right to return your order and have you arrested. All orders must be
mailed in and paid for by check or money order. (We can’t afford
the credit card charges, and COD’s are more bother than they are
worth and at this price we don’t need the extra espense.)
If you just want to enter this sale without purchasing anything,
simply send the ad in with the number in the circle. If you guess
the correct number of mispelled words, you will get a $10 credit
towards all the products listed in our catalog which we will also
send you (not all the products, just our catalog).
There  are  a  few  disclamers.  We  only  have  a  few  thousand  of
these  machines  so  we  reserve  the  right  to  run  out  of  them. We
also reserve the right to return any order that claims more mis-
pelled words than we’ve actually made. We will ship each unit
freight  collect  with  charges  usually  running  around  $50  east  of
the Mississippi or a little more in California. And ﬁnally, a little
clue. There are three mispelled words in this paragraph.

DESIGNED FOR THE LOWER BACK
The  Nautilus  Lower  Back  machine  is  designed  to  strengthen
your  lower  back.  If  you’re  an  executive  who  sits  at  a  desk  for
long hours, your back muscles soon grow weak and cannot sup-
port your spine and your skeletal frame as it was designed to do.
What  I  like  about  the  back  machine  is  how  easy  it  works  to
strengthen the back. As little as ﬁve minutes a day and three days
a  week  is  all  the  exercise  you  need  to  start  the  program.  And
since  the  exercise  time  is  so  short  and  not  very  strenuous,  you
can exercise anytime of the day or night.
There are ten tension positions. You start at the smallest setting
and gradually build up as you increase your strength. In a rela-
tively  short  time,  you’ll  be  able  to  feel  the  difference.  I  can’t
guarantee  that  your  lower  back  problems  will  be  gone  forever,
but the Nautilus Lower Back machine can really make a differ-
ence. And even with its low price, the Nautilus comes with a 30-
day exercise trial period. If the unit doesn’t make a big difference
in your exercise program, return the unit to JS&A for a full re-
fund  of  your  purchase  price.  But  act  quickly.  Once  we  sell  all
these units, that’s all we can get. One last thing. Please don’t call
our operators to ﬁnd out the number of mispelled words.
The Nautilus Lower Back machine is made out of tubular steel
that will take a tremendous amount of abuse. All the contact sur-
faces are cushioned and covered with black Naugahyde. It takes
only a few minutes to assemble it with a screwdriver and wrench
and it measures 341/2″ × 51″ x 54″ and weighs 150 pounds. The

269

P R O V I N G   T H E   P O I N T S — A D   E X A M P L E S

unit  comes  with  a  90-day  manufacturer’s  limited  warranty  and
complete instructions.
Take  advantage  of  this  unique  opportunity  to  own  one  of  the
ﬁnest  pieces  of  exercise  equiptment  at  the  lowest  possible  cost
for just being able to count our mispelled words.

I had two surprises with the results from this ad. The ﬁrst
was the number of people who missed many of the words. We
made more proﬁt than I had anticipated. There were exactly 25
misspelled words, but on average most people found around 20
of them.

The second surprise was the number of people who called
me to tell me that they had spent hours reading and rereading the
ad to ﬁnd the number of misspelled words even though they had
no intention of buying the unit.

I  then  used  this  technique  to  sell  the  Franklin  Spelling
Computer. For the spelling computer, it certainly made sense as
it tied into the product nicely. But it was this ﬁrst Nautilus ad that
really launched the concept.

One of the strong points of this ad was the involvement that
it created on the part of the reader. I received mail months later
asking  me  for  the  correct  number  of  misspelled  words.  People
were spending hours reading my ad. How many ads can claim
that distinction?

The people who found most or all of the words really had a
bargain too. And we eventually sold all of our inventory in what
was  a  very  successful  ad.  Bad  spelling,  bad  grammar,  who
cared?  We  broke  a  few  rules  and  came  up  with  a  very  unique
marketing concept that could still work today.

The Power of Your Pen A Note

I n Section Three you took all your new copywriting knowledge
and saw how it could be applied in actual mail order advertise-
ments. You also saw how these principles could work in ads that
weren’t  mail  order  ads  and  you  saw  what  copy  elements  were
missing in others.

You can now write a great mail order ad using my approach
to  writing  copy. You  can  create  the  goose  that  lays  the  golden
egg. And you know that with this new knowledge you have the
potential skill to start businesses and earn millions of dollars—
all through the power of your pen.

But it takes practice. And the more you practice, the greater
your skill and the closer you will come to the wonderful and ex-
hilarating feeling of writing an ad that the public responds to in
massive numbers. Good luck and best wishes in your quest for
success.

Utilizing Your Copywriting Skills

Preview

Let us assume by now that you have understood and mastered
the material I have presented. You know how to write great copy
and build that slippery slide. You understand the psychological
triggers and how effectively they can be used to sell your prod-
uct or service. And ﬁnally, you understand the role of a powerful
satisfaction conviction.

Once you understand the principles of a print mail order ad,
you’re ready to apply those principles to enhance all your com-
munication  skills. Whether  in  a  radio  commercial  or  on  a  web
site, all the principles apply, with one caveat—some principles
are more important than others depending on the format or the
medium. Let me explain.

Whereas  in  a  mail  order  ad  your  copy  is  very  important,
what techniques work best on TV? What psychological triggers
work best on radio or on the Internet? For example, on the Inter-
net there is greater involvement on the part of the prospect. He or
she must take an action such as clicking on a button or on a link.
So interactivity is an important concept.

The remainder of this handbook focuses on the various me-
dia and how they differ from a print ad, and consequently how to
write copy for each format.

I am also including a large amount of marketing informa-
tion to help guide you in the copywriting process. If you don’t
know the best way to market a particular product or service in a
speciﬁc  medium,  how  can  you  write  copy  for  it?  So  I  go  into
depth and explain the differences and the quirks to watch for as
you examine all the media possibilities and their potential.

Writing for Different Media

Chapter 36

Catalogs
Here’s  a  format  where  copy  and  graphics  play  a  big  role.  The
catalog cover should present the best picture—the most dramatic
shot in the entire catalog or a product that best represents what
can be found inside.

I used to feature a product on the cover of my catalogs that
was unusual, novel and different and looked dramatic. It didn’t
matter  if  it  wasn’t  a  big  seller. The  important  point  was  that  it
caused the prospect to pause and not just throw the catalog away.
The cover is like the headline in a print ad. Its sole purpose is to
get you into the catalog and to start reviewing the other products
or  to  put  it  aside  for  reading  later. You  want  to  avoid  it  being
simply thrown in the trash.

A good catalog should have a message from the president in
the front of the catalog along with his or her picture. This is im-
portant. A catalog is like a store. If the store lacked a proprietor,
it would seem cold, too big or corporate.

That personal message at the front of the catalog is like a
Wal-Mart associate standing at the entrance of a Wal-Mart store
greeting visitors as they walk in. It makes the store more human,
makes  the  proprietor  a  friendly  face  you  can  contact  should
things not work out to your satisfaction. You feel safe in dealing
with the company because you know there is a human behind the
catalog and that human is real and reachable. Your copy should
reﬂect this. It should read like a personal letter to your prospects
and should express your sincerity and commitment to satisfying
their needs. I would rank this letter as one of the most important
pieces of copy in the entire catalog.

Producing  a  catalog  is  a  matter  of  arranging  graphics  and
copy  in  a  pleasing  and  easy-to-follow  format.  Combining  the
graphics and copy is similar to creating a print ad. You should

277

U T I L I Z I N G   Y O U R   C O P Y W R I T I N G   S K I L L S

have a short but enticing headline, a subheadline that explains a
little more about what you are offering and then copy that covers
each aspect of the product and its beneﬁts to your prospect.

It is extremely important to include all the salient features
of the product you are selling. Leave out one small fact—even
one  that  may  seem  insigniﬁcant  such  as  a  product’s  weight—
and you’ll reduce your sales. A catalog description should con-
tain  all  the  information  you  need  for  your  prospect  to  make  a
buying decision. Leave out one small fact, and you run the risk
of reducing your response. The missing fact gives the buyer an
excuse to delay his or her decision. And it raises a question as to
whether the product will ﬁt his or her needs. Nobody wants to
buy something and then have to return it. So being thorough in
your description will make a big difference in the minds of your
prospects. They will feel conﬁdent that what they buy they will
like and keep—always knowing, of course, that they can return
the item for any reason.

The  next  thing  to  consider  is  the  environment  you  create
through the graphics and the look of the catalog. If you are send-
ing your catalog to sophisticated buyers, make sure that the copy
and the look of the catalog are upscale. If you are selling prod-
ucts in a closeout catalog, you don’t want your catalog to look
too slick. Your customer doesn’t expect to see an expensive cata-
log selling products at really cheap prices. As a guide, set the en-
vironment  based  on  the  price  points  you  are  selling  your
products for.

In  a  mail  order  ad  you  should  feature  a  single  product  or
service, leaving variations of that product out of the sales mes-
sage. But in a catalog you have the opportunity of offering sev-
eral variations of the main product you might sell in a mail order
print ad. In fact, that’s what your customers expect.

A good example of this was given earlier in this handbook
(“Simplicity” in Chapter 19). I offered a single style of the Swiss
Army watch and tested it against several styles. The single style
offer worked best in the mail order ad, whereas the other watch
styles worked best in our catalog.

Finally, what works exceptionally well for product catalogs
is  the  personal  sales  message—something  that  I  have  used  for

278

W R I T I N G   F O R   D I F F E R E N T   M E D I A

years with great success. Let each product description sound like
a personal conversation with the prospect.

Say “I” or “me” or “my,” and talk as if you were a friendly
person  chatting  with  your  prospect.  Your  conversation  might
sound  something  like,  “I  was  walking  down  the  street  when  I
had this neat idea for my catalog.” Such rhetoric combines story-
telling and the personal approach to advertisng, which I strongly
recommend.

In the case of a catalog, think of it as a store, sell in it like
you would in a store and show your enthusiasm for the products
you sell through your copy and your use of the ﬁrst person.

If  something  is  important,  give  it  more  space.  Make  sure
you  have  your  toll-free  phone  number  on  each  page.  Often  a
prospect will tear out a page and throw away the rest of the cata-
log  only  to  discover  later  that  the  toll-free  number  is  missing.
And even if your prospect keeps the entire catalog, having your
phone number on each page will make ordering easier.

Use  an  easy-to-remember  toll-free  phone  number.  Use
words to make up the number. When I call FedEx for a pickup,
all I have to remember is 1-800-GOFEDEX. And if you do use
words to convey a phone number, also include the actual num-
bers to make it easier for the prospect to dial.

The toll-free number should be large and rather obvious on
the order form. Most people will order over the phone or go to a
web  site  to  order.  So  why  not  make  the  order  form  show  that
toll-free number and web site address loud and clear?

Then make sure that your order form is easy to ﬁll out and
provides plenty of room to list all the necessary information. If
most people respond on the phone with the toll-free number or
on your web site, though, why even have a catalog order form?
The answer is that many catalog buyers ﬁrst list their purchases
on the order form before they actually call and order. It makes
the ordering process go faster and is a convenient record for the
customer.

Finally, make sure that each operator who takes an order on
the phone has a script to sell something else after the customer
places an order. This will certainly add incremental business and
increase catalog proﬁts.

Flyers: Insert Stuffers, Bounce Backs, and Broadsides
The common thread that all of these formats have is that they are
after-the-sale  advertisements.  Once  you’ve  made  the  sale,  you
should place something in the package you are shipping that of-
fers something your new customer might also be interested in.

The piece might contain offers on some of the other prod-
ucts you sell. It might even be a catalog designed speciﬁcally for
new  customers.  Or  even  the  catalog  from  which  the  order  was
originally made. It usually doesn’t cost any more postage to ship
these solicitations. And since it is being sent to a customer, there
is a better chance that it will be read and acted upon than if it was
simply sent to a prospect.

Insert stuffers and bounce backs are ﬂyers that are placed in
packages going to customers. A broadside is the ﬂyer folded to
ﬁt in a standard-sized #10 business envelope.

In  the  case  of  these  solicitations,  the  piece  you  design
should use a similar format to your catalog page to provide a
level of continuity. Use an attention-getting headline, use bullet
points  where  appropriate  and  don’t  forget  to  provide  that  all-
important  ordering  information—a  coupon  with  your  address,
toll-free phone number, and web site address.

Direct Mail
One of the more effective ways to sell in print is through direct
mail. It’s a way to target a speciﬁc prospect who has exhibited
certain  buying  tendencies,  and  it’s  a  way  to  target  all  of  those
tendencies in a very efﬁcient way. But there are some important
notes about copywriting that need to be observed in this form of
communication.

As  I  have  mentioned  throughout  this  handbook,  the  per-
sonal  approach  to  selling  can’t  be  beat.  Selling  is  really  a  per-
sonal  relationship  between  the  seller  and  the  buyer.  It’s  a
relationship  of  trust. And  to  enhance  that  trust  there  is  nothing
like having your prospects know clearly whom they are dealing
with.  Your  prospects  will  pick  up  the  vibrations  of  what  you
write, especially if you are making your communications sound
very personal.

Direct mail copy is among the most personal types of copy

280

W R I T I N G   F O R   D I F F E R E N T   M E D I A

you can write. It is a letter written directly to another individual.
It is a message to a person whom you have sought out by simply
reﬁning your mailing criteria to focus on just those attributes that
represent your prospect. By selecting a mailing list that encom-
passes those attributes, your chances of success will be greatly
enhanced.

The most important thing to be aware of is to keep the mes-
sage personal. Using the ﬁrst person is important. Use the word I
and avoid the term we when referring to your associates. In fact, it
is a lot better when referring to your company to talk about the staff
as a team—for example, “My team of great engineers is available
to help you.” Compare that to: “We at Acme Motors have the skill
and knowledge to provide assistance to you.” And your letter be-
comes even more personal when it is signed by the sender.

In a direct mail piece, the letter is the most important part of
the entire mailing package. In it you must include the sales pitch,
the slippery slide—designed to get the recipient of your mailing
piece to read the entire letter—and all the psychological triggers
described earlier. You have the space and the time to make a very
good sales presentation.

The length of the letter can vary. If you can get your mes-
sage  onto  one  page,  you  make  the  mailing  less  intimidating.
More pages are okay, too, if you’ve written a strong enough ﬁrst
page to keep them reading and of course if the subject is interest-
ing  to  the  reader;  then  you’re  doing  your  job  as  a  copywriter.
Write 10 pages if you feel it is important to do so in order to sell
your product or service, but the letter has got to be so compelling
that  the  reader  continues  to  read  straight  through  to  the  end  of
the letter as if on a slippery slide.

Use any collateral material that is included with the letter to
visually  describe  your  product  or  service.  The  more  important
message,  however,  is  in  the  letter. A brochure  won’t  sell  your
product as effectively as a good letter. The brochure or the color
ﬂyer could be critical to the sale but not nearly as important as
the letter.

And you can certainly refer to the brochure in your letter,
but don’t rely on that fancy brochure to do the complete selling
job. It won’t, no matter how pretty and how good it may look.

281

U T I L I Z I N G   Y O U R   C O P Y W R I T I N G   S K I L L S

Don’t forget that postscript (PS). The PS in a letter is often
the most-read line of type on the page. So either offer something
in the PS that causes the reader to solidify a buying decision or
reiterate a very important point.

Use objects with the letter. When I did advertising for my
ski-lift account I had a small number of prospects—around 500.
It was therefore practical for me to include something unusual in
each mailing. I sent a large button that said “No Jerk” to empha-
size the smooth nature of my ski lift. I sent a brochure that ex-
panded  so  that  one  side  read  “expand”  and  sent  it  with  a  nice
letter.  My  prospects  looked  forward  to  each  mailing  simply  to
ﬁnd out what I was going to say and include in my next mailing.
In direct mail, the mailing list is also a critical element to
the success of a direct mail piece. Your own satisﬁed customers
for a similar product will be your best and hottest list if they’ve
purchased  recently—the  more  recently  the  better.  If  you  pur-
chase lists, make sure the prospects on a list are demographically
similar  to  your  customers  and  that  they  have  bought  fairly  re-
cently through the mail and for purchases within the price range
of what you are offering.

But let’s say you have a great letter, a cute little gimmick
you  are  mailing  with  your  letter  and  a  ﬁrst-rate  mailing  list.
What is missing? How about a great message on your envelope?
Your envelope is like the headline on a mail order ad. It will at-
tract those prospects interested enough to read the subheadline,
which  usually  is  inside  the  envelope  so  you  often  need  to  get
them to open the envelope in order to read the subheadline. Of
course  you  can  put  the  subheadline  on  the  envelope,  too. You
might even try using some attention-getting statement if you feel
the statement will cause the customer to open the envelope. If re-
cipients are interested in your offer, they will know right away
whether to open the envelope or throw it into the trash.

Just as people are inclined to discard Internet spam if they
don’t recognize the sender without even opening the e-mail, re-
cipients of your mailings are inclined to throw out your mailing
piece without even opening it. But there are ways to get them to
open the envelope.

If you put no name or headline on the envelope (just the re-

282

W R I T I N G   F O R   D I F F E R E N T   M E D I A

turn address), most of the recipients will open it out of curiosity.
After all, it might be a credit card (many credit cards are sent this
way). If the envelope has your company name and address and
the person receiving it recognizes it as a company he or she has
bought from before, chances are they will open it.

A computer-addressed envelope that looks like it was in-
dividually typed provides a strong incentive to open the enve-
lope as well.

A good tip is for you to study the mail that comes into your
mailbox.  Which  ones  do  you  open  and  which  ones  do  you
quickly  throw  out?  Often  you  are  representative  of  the  people
who are your prospects.

What  works  can  be  easily  determined  if  you  test  every
mailing  piece  you  send  out  against  a  different  version  of  the
same mailing piece. Testing is the critical factor that makes a big
difference in the success of anything you do in direct marketing.
And as a copywriter you can learn so much by observing what
works and what doesn’t.

Newspapers
Newspapers are one topic I can speak about from a great deal of
experience. Not only have I advertised in many daily and weekly
newspapers,  but  I  actually  published  a  weekly  newspaper,  the
Maui Weekly, for six years in Maui, Hawaii, before I sold it to
the island’s daily newspaper in 2005.

If the ad you are placing in a newspaper is a mail order ad,
it should pay for itself and cover the cost of the insertion the ﬁrst
time it appears.

If you are advertising something that promotes a retail es-
tablishment,  then  frequency  is  a  major  key.  Putting  an  ad  in  a
paper  only  once  is  simply  a  waste  of  time  and  money.  Often
people  don’t  respond  right  away.  There  is  a  lag  time  between
seeing your ad the ﬁrst time and then seeing it so often that a
level of trust develops. Or it could be simply the time isn’t quite
right  when  the  ad  ﬁrst  appears  because  of  other  events  in  the
community.

Let’s say you are advertising a restaurant. The ad is to ap-
pear  each  week  in  the  dining  section  of  the  weekly  newspaper

283

U T I L I Z I N G   Y O U R   C O P Y W R I T I N G   S K I L L S

for a total of 13 weeks. The ad appears the ﬁrst week and there
seems to be little response. The ad appears the second week and
a few more people show up. Slowly but surely the restaurant’s
customers appear in greater numbers.

I can remember when I was in college at the University of
Miami  and  a  restaurant  owner  who  saw  that  I  was  a  student
asked if I knew how to encourage other students to come to his
Old  Hickory  Barbeque  restaurant.  I  told  him  that  I  felt  I  could
reach  the  students.  I  knew  what  the  students  responded  to  and
felt that an ad in the daily college paper, the Hurricane, would
do the trick. But as an aspiring copywriter, I also knew that the
copy for this chicken and rib joint on the outskirts of town had to
be so compelling and different that students would respond to it
and not think of it as just advertising.

So the ad I ran talked about a chicken and rib special and
then I told students that there was a catch. To get this special
price, they had to bring in the top of a Brinks armored car. The
ad ran. I held my breath and at ﬁrst was too embarrassed to go
to  the  restaurant  and  see  the  owner,  concerned  that  maybe  I
had been a little over-the-top in what I had written. But to my
surprise when I ﬁnally pulled up to the restaurant, there was a
line  around  the  block—with  students  carrying  pieces  of  ply-
wood,  sheets  of  tin,  garbage  can  covers  marked  “Brinks Ar-
mored Car Top” and a variety of other similar objects. The ad
was a huge success.

I was communicating with the students in a way that they
appreciated. And  they  responded  in  large  numbers.  It  was  also
one  of  the  few  times  when  an  ad  for  a  retail  establishment
worked without the beneﬁt of frequency.

Mail order ads in newspapers are designed to hit the mass
market. Assuming you are advertising in a daily newspaper cov-
ering a large metropolitan area, then you’ve got to think in terms
of lower-priced items that the mass market may relate to in large
enough numbers. If, however, you have higher-ticket items, the
Wall Street Journal would be your better venue for advertising.
In the case of the Wall Street Journal, you go to a higher demo-
graphic to ﬁnd the target audience you’ll need to sell your prod-
uct or service.

284

W R I T I N G   F O R   D I F F E R E N T   M E D I A

At its peak, my mail order company, JS&A, used the Wall
Street  Journal extensively  to  sell  my  high-priced  gadgets.  In
fact, at one point we were among the Journal’s largest advertis-
ers. I liked the Journal because I was able to get my ads into the
paper quickly—usually within a few days—and get my response
a few days later. With the fast pace at which our products were
introduced, peaked and then became obsolete, this speed was es-
sential in introducing new products quickly and keeping up with
the  rapid  price  deterioration  that  was  taking  place  in  the  con-
sumer electronics industry.

You  could  make  a  nice  proﬁt  in  a  daily  newspaper  if  you
bought your space right. And there are brokers who handle this
type of advertising and are able to provide the newspaper space
at very low prices so that indeed a nice proﬁt can be made.

The  same  principles  that  apply  to  a  mail  order  ad  de-
scribed in the ﬁrst part of the book apply here, of course. And
your goal is to make a proﬁt from your mail order ad the ﬁrst
time you run it.

If the cost of space is a concern and you can get your mes-
sage across in a smaller ad without much copy, then a small ad
might be a good way to conserve your cash. An ad with a low-
priced offer where the low price is the big attraction works well
in this kind of situation. But keep in mind that you are compet-
ing with other small ads instead of dominating the page as you
would with a larger, more descriptive ad.

Daily  newspapers  in  the  United  States  are  losing  circula-
tion. Weekly community newspapers are gaining in circulation.
Why? Because the public can get their national and international
news from TV or on the Internet 24/7. Community newspapers
such  as  the  Maui  Weekly cover  issues  of  interest  to  the  local
community—news that can’t be found on TV or on the Internet.
One of the things I did when I ﬁrst bought the Maui Weekly in
1999 was to change the format of the paper and keep this same
format week after week. Each issue was interesting and consistent.
I also used many of the principles that I’ve explained in the ﬁrst
three sections of this book to enhance my rapport with the com-
munity. I found that consistency was my most important principle.
It took awhile but before long the community embraced the publi-

285

U T I L I Z I N G   Y O U R   C O P Y W R I T I N G   S K I L L S

cation and looked forward to receiving it each week. And our cir-
culation and advertising grew as a result. The one powerful trigger
of consistency also worked for our advertisers. Keeping a regular
schedule and the same format while changing the copy proved to
be successful for our advertisers as well.

The  big  advantage  of  a  newspaper  is  the  fast  response
time—your ability to get your ad into a paper quickly and the
speed  of  the  response  you  receive  after  your  ad  appears.  The
life  of  each  issue  of  a  daily  newspaper  is  usually  just  a  few
days,  so  your  prospect  will  generally  respond  quickly  during
that time frame. For a weekly, the life of an issue is typically
around 10 days.

Frequency  is  also  an  important  consideration  if  you  are
running  retail  advertising  for  such  establishments  as  restau-
rants, car dealerships, furniture stores, clothing outlets and real
estate sales.

Another  nice  feature  of  running  ads  in  newspapers  is  the
sheer volume of newspapers available to advertise in. If your ad
works, it can be run nationally and reach millions of people in a
relatively short period of time.

If  you  have  a  product  or  service  that  would  appeal  to  the
general  public  and  it  is  priced  low  enough  while  representing
good value, newspapers are a good choice. For a higher-priced
product,  reﬁne  your  choice  of  newspapers  to  the  more  upscale
papers such as the Wall Street Journal or many of the other busi-
ness publications.

Billboards
A billboard  uses  few  words  to  convey  its  message,  so  those
words must be very powerful or create immediate awareness or
the billboard is useless. From your research you must write a sin-
gle headline and, at the most, a minimal subheadline, accompa-
nied  by  a  graphic  that  conveys  the  big  idea  you’re  trying  to
convey.

Here is where simplicity is the controlling factor. Your mes-
sage has to be so simple and direct that occupants of cars passing
by  at  75  miles  an  hour  can  pick  out  the  message  and  quickly
grasp its meaning.

286

W R I T I N G   F O R   D I F F E R E N T   M E D I A

A billboard can create curiosity and a buzz such as in the
Folgers coffee teaser campaign of the late 1960s that stated, “A
mountain  is  moving  to  Chicago,”  when  Folgers  introduced  its
coffee  to  the  Chicago  area.  The  mountain  was  actually  the
graphic  on  the  container  of  coffee,  but  nobody  knew  exactly
what the billboards meant until the formal announcement.

The  point  you  always  want  to  remember  when  you  write
copy for a billboard is that you need to capture the imagination
of your prospect in a very short, simple and effective way in a
matter of a few seconds.

Billboards have been used effectively to create a buzz, as in
the Folgers example, or to establish brand recognition, and are
ideal for a recognized brand as well as to build brand awareness.
They can be used to promote an establishment up the road or to
sell beer. But whatever the task, the key is brevity and simplicity.

Press Releases
Press releases are a means of disseminating information to vari-
ous media where the information is published at no charge. It’s
free and sometimes can provide great value.

But wait. There is a risk—the chance that the person pub-
lishing what you send may distort the message in a rewrite. It’s a
two-edged sword. In general, though, this free publicity is a pos-
itive thing and can be used very effectively either as the sole way
to market a product or part of a campaign.

First, let’s make sure that we put the proper heading at the
very top of the paper so the person receiving the message knows
that it’s for public relations (PR). My suggestion is to put “News
Release” at the top—“Press Release” has gotten old hat.

I  would  then  put  the  date  and  the  words  “For  Immediate
Release”  in  the  top  right-hand  corner  of  the  release.  Giving  a
later release date is also acceptable but very rare.

Next,  I  would  come  up  with  a  headline  and  subheadline
that  would  appeal  to  the  readers  of  the  publication  receiving
the release.

Then put the city of origin for the news release, similar to
the  way  news  stories  appear  in  a  newspaper:  something  like
“(Chicago, IL) A major new breakthrough . . .”

287

U T I L I Z I N G   Y O U R   C O P Y W R I T I N G   S K I L L S

The news release should be written like a news story, com-
plete with as much detail at the beginning as possible. Within a
few paragraphs all the salient points should be encapsulated so
an  editor  or  any  reader  can  get  the  gist  of  what  you’re  saying
very quickly. Use the typical who, what, when, where, why and
how at the very beginning of your release.

Remember you are appealing to the editor to view what you
are sending as news and not a puff piece promoting your com-
pany or its product. The editor wants to make sure that the piece
is relevant to the publication’s audience.

You can use quotes in the release that can be attributed to
experts who will say things about your product or service that
you can’t say in the body of your release. “John Jackson, chair-
man  of  the  company  making  the  Bone  Fone,  says,  ‘Never  be-
fore  in  the  history  of  sound  has  a  product  this  novel  been
introduced.’ ” A quote like this has to be attributed to someone,
so use the device as an opportunity to include testimonials, state-
ments from the president of the company or other comments that
enhance the news in your article.

Psychological  triggers  that  play  an  important  role  in  a
news release are “linking” and “current fads.” If there is a fad
sweeping  the  country,  see  if  you  can  cleanly  link  into  it  with
your product or service. For example, in the 1960s at the height
of  the  women’s  liberation  movement,  my  ski  resort  account
asked  if  I  could  help  promote  its  snowmobile  rental  business
through  PR.  It  seems  that  nobody  realized  that  snowmobiles
could be rented at this ski resort.

The hottest fad or trend at the time was the women’s libera-
tion movement, and tying it into my client’s wishes, I came up
with  a  headline,  “Ski  Resort  Bans  Woman  Snowmobile  Dri-
vers.”  The  subheadline  then  explained  the  ban  in  more  detail:
“Schuss  Mountain  Ski  Resort  in  northern  Michigan  claims
women  snowmobile  drivers  are  causing  too  many  accidents  so
owner bans all women from using them.”

The release that followed was brief. It didn’t have to be too
long. I quoted Dan Iannotti, the owner of the resort, as saying,
“There’s  nothing  worse  than  a  woman  behind  the  wheel  of  a
snowmobile.”

288

W R I T I N G   F O R   D I F F E R E N T   M E D I A

Iannotti had an open mind and thought the idea was clever
enough to possibly make a big splash, so he approved it. All hell
broke loose after it was released to the local media. The release
made  the  national  network  news  shows  and  the  front  page  of
many newspapers and became one of the most discussed topics
on  the  talk  shows.  I  had  indeed  linked  into  a  strong  trend  that
helped my client get out his message.

The  snowmobile  rentals  jumped  at  the  resort—of  course
not before we issued another release a week later with the head-
line “Ban Lifted at Ski Resort” and subheadline “Because of the
pressure, Schuss Mountain ski resort lifts ban on women snow-
mobilers”—and all this was followed by text that explained the
change  of  heart  by  the  owner  after  a  number  of  women  com-
plained about the ban. “We have set up a school to teach good
snowmobile habits,” said Iannotti in the text of the release.

A friend of mine had a product that he sold using only PR.
It was a device that he put over his toilet and onto which a cat
climbed  to  use  the  toilet.  I’m  not  kidding.  And  the  product
worked. But he couldn’t advertise it in any magazine as they all
were repulsed by the thought of advertising this type of product.
He  then  resorted  to  PR  and  was  able  to  get  national  publicity
more easily than he could from trying to advertise it.

This  is  not  meant  to  be  a  resource  on  PR  principles  but
rather some of the principles that could apply to a news release
sent  to  a  publication  or  TV network.  Realize  that  as  a  copy-
writer,  your  role  here  is  to  look  at  your  copy  as  news  editors
would and write it to ﬁt their model of what a good news story
should reﬂect.

Radio
Radio draws on the imaginations of your listeners to get a strong,
personal message across. And radio is negotiable and often not
very expensive, making it a good part of an advertiser’s mix.

To make radio work, you need frequency. You can have a
great radio spot but unless it is repeated often enough, it won’t
be as effective.

As with TV, you can buy many different forms of radio. A
radio spot is typically from 10 seconds to 60 seconds in duration,

289

U T I L I Z I N G   Y O U R   C O P Y W R I T I N G   S K I L L S

and there is also the long-form radio commercial referred to as
“brokered time.” This is where the advertiser buys the time slot
(usually a half hour to an hour) and uses it just like a talk show to
promote his or her own business. It might be a real estate show,
an investment program or even a show on health.

Los  Angeles  advertising  guru  and  radio  copywriter  Dan
O’Day says that it is vital to have only one message to convey to
the listener in the typical radio spot, and that should be what he
calls the “core message.”

“Radio is the most personal of all mass media. You listen to
the  message  in  a  linear  fashion  one  statement  after  the  next,”
says O’Day.

O’Day points out that radio is also a very visual medium in
the sense that the listener has to imagine what is being described.
For example, if a child is described as beautiful, the listener pic-
tures a child he or she considers to be beautiful. If this was done
on TV and a child was shown, there might be a credibility gap.
The  child  visualized  by  the  radio  listener  may  be  personally
more beautiful to him or her than the actual one seen on TV.

If  you  are  doing  a  direct  response  radio  spot,  one  of  the
most important elements is the toll-free number. Is it easy to re-
member? Most radio listeners are driving their cars, and others
just may not have a pen and paper handy. Some advertisers are
using words instead of numbers to make it easy to remember.
For  example,  1-800-FLOWERS  or  1-800-CARPETS  or  even
1-800-BLUBLOCKER. These make great radio phone numbers.
In the case of the BluBlocker number, there are a few extra
letters in BluBlocker (9 instead of the correct 7) but that’s okay
as  it  doesn’t  matter  to  the  phone  company  if  you  punch  a  few
more keys after you dial the number, and besides, it’s easy to re-
member. But you’ve got to be careful that people spell the pho-
netic  version  of  your  number  correctly.  For  example,  many
people  have  typed  in  1-800-BLUEBLOCKER  by  mistake,
spelling “blue” correctly even though it is not the actual spelling
of the brand. So we arranged for both the correct and the incor-
rect numbers to be directed to the same phone line. We assumed
in  advance  that  sometimes  it  was  going  to  be  misspelled  and
therefore prepared for it.

290

W R I T I N G   F O R   D I F F E R E N T   M E D I A

The second thing to remember with a direct response spot is
that the start of the spot is critical for people to stay tuned and
pay attention. So you might start out with a curiosity trigger such
as, “I’ve got some important news for those of you who are con-
cerned about the bird ﬂu.” Radio is a music and news medium.
The more you therefore make your message sound like news, the
more compatible your message is with the medium.

Dick Orkin was known in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s for
his humorous spots. They told a story. And the humor was not
for  the  sake  of  being  funny—more  for  the  fact  that  it  grabbed
you and lent a human tone to the message. In the 1960s and early
1970s  radio  personality  Stan  Freberg  produced  some  funny
spots, too. But the spots from both Orkin and Freberg had that
single core message that came across loud and clear.

Take the commercial from Motel 6. “We’ll leave the light
on for ya” was the tagline at the end of those spots. But the core
message, according to O’Day, “was not that well-recalled slogan
but that Motel 6 had the lowest room rates—actually the lowest
room  rates  of  any  national  chain.” And  it  also  had  a  very  per-
sonal message recited by Tom Bodett. Radio became Motel 6’s
primary advertising medium.

I’ve used radio very effectively during my entire advertis-
ing  career.  More  recently,  I  have  used  radio  to  promote  my
BluBlocker sunglasses brand. Since BluBlocker is already an es-
tablished  sunglasses  brand,  I  used  radio  to  draw  attention  to
where you could buy BluBlockers. It’s a product worn in good
weather, so I sponsored the weather and trafﬁc reports. The an-
nouncer would always have a captive audience wanting to hear
this  information  so  I  had  the  perfect  environment  for  my  mes-
sage.  The  announcer  would  start  out,  “The  trafﬁc  and  weather
are  brought  to  you  by  BluBlocker  high-resolution  sunglasses.
Get BluBlockers at your local Walgreens Drug Store.” In just a
few seconds I was able to get across my core message, “Get your
BluBlockers  at Walgreens.” And  those  spots  worked  very  well
for us through daily repetition.

As a copywriter, realize that radio is among the most per-
sonal of all media with a core message—simple, clean and easy
to comprehend.

Television
Writing  copy  for  TV follows  many  of  the  same  principles
you’ve learned in this book, but the copy will vary by length of
the  commercial.  Now  that  might  seem  obvious  but  let  me  ex-
plain further.

I have had personal experience and both success and failure
in all of the various TV formats we will discuss. I have sold mil-
lions of pairs of sunglasses and other products on infomercials,
home shopping channels and TV spots. I have tested all elements
of  a  TV commercial  and  know  what  works  and  what  doesn’t.
What you read here should act as an excellent guideline on how
to write copy for TV because it is presented by somebody with
extensive personal experience in all of the various TV formats.

Some  of  the  facts  mentioned  will  have  more  to  do  with
marketing than copywriting. But as a copywriter you would be
wasting your time writing copy for a TV spot that won’t work
because it is violating some important marketing principle. So in
a sense, knowing a little about marketing in this very powerful
category is very important to the copywriter.

Let’s start with the TV spot commercial or what is called
short-form  TV,  which  can  be  anywhere  from  30  seconds  to
two minutes long, and go over six of the copywriting and mar-
keting  points  you’ll  need  to  know  to  successfully  write  copy
for this format.

1. Typically the most effective way to determine if your product
is suitable for this form of advertising is price point. If your
product is an impulse item (deﬁned as being in the $29.95 or
less retail price category), then chances are this might be an
appropriate format to sell your product.

2. The next criterion should be value. It must appear almost too
good to be true. Greed will play a role here. Your customers
must  feel  that  they  are  getting  a  bigger  value  than  they  be-
lieve  possible.  They  must  subconsciously  think,  “How  can
they do it?”

3. Simplicity  is  extremely  important,  too.  Keeping  the  offer
simple  and  uncomplicated  is  critical. Anything  that  compli-
cates  the  commercial  will  lose  sales. The  only  exception  to

292

W R I T I N G   F O R   D I F F E R E N T   M E D I A

this rule is near the end of the spot when you start adding on
additional items to increase the value. For example, “If you
call  within  the  next  20  minutes,  I’ll  also  include  an  extra
mixer  free  of  charge. That’s  two  mixers  for  $19.95.”  Don’t
give the prospect a choice to make. There should be only one
choice—“Buy this product now and get all of this.” Don’t of-
fer  different  colors  or  sizes.  It’s  one  offer  and  no  choices.
Only when your prospects call on the phone do you “upsell”
them to other items or offer various versions or multiples of
the same offer.

4. Use  a  sense  of  urgency.  You  need  to  make  sure  that  the
prospect doesn’t copy the phone number down with the idea
of purchasing your product later on, because chances are he
or she won’t. Like the preceding, using greed as a motivator
and a time limit to respond works wonders.

5. Include a web site address. Many viewers will copy both the
toll-free number and the web site address and then go to their
computers.  People  are  different.  Some  like  to  buy  on  the
phone, others through the mail and still others on the Internet.
You want to appeal to all of them. Some prospects may get
turned off when they call to order a product and reach some-
body  in  another  country  who  speaks  with  an  unintelligible
accent. They may decide to hang up and buy the item on the
Internet. It has happened to me. And with so much of our ser-
vice  industry  being  exported  to  other  countries,  the  Web
might be a logical place to buy.

6. Your product must appeal to a mass market: all women, all
men, both men and women over the age of 40 or large seg-
ments  of  the  general  public.  After  all,  TV reaches  a  mass
market and unless your product appeals to the masses you are
wasting a lot of money reaching your target market. For ex-
ample,  I  have  run  spots  for  my  BluBlocker  sunglasses  and
have done quite well. Why? They appeal to a mass audience
of  both  men  and  women  and  almost  all  age  groups.  Sun-
glasses are a mass market product.

If your product ﬁts the preceding criteria, then you’ve got a
good chance at succeeding in this medium. Your approach now

293

U T I L I Z I N G   Y O U R   C O P Y W R I T I N G   S K I L L S

is to determine how to write a spot that is compelling, stops the
viewer  and  makes  an  offer  that  provides  a  real  beneﬁt  to  the
consumer.

Once again, the same principles of copywriting apply to a
TV spot.  But  in  a  spot  you  have  to  literally  count  your  words,
making  them  reach  the  point  quickly  while  presenting  your
product and its beneﬁts in the proper environment.

You create the environment by the visuals. If you’re selling
a kitchen appliance, use a kitchen as your background. If you’re
selling an automobile dent remover, show a homeowner at home
removing  the  dents  from  his  or  her  moderately  priced  car.  Re-
member  that  you  are  reaching  the  masses  and  use  props  that
identify and are typical for that market.

Focus on the core message you want to convey. Every word
and every visual element have to lead the viewer to the ﬁnal buy-
ing conclusion. If you offer bonuses, make sure the bonus you
offer  is  something  the  same  audience  would  want.  You  don’t
want to give a free gift of something that a portion of the audi-
ence may not care for. What this does is deter them from buying
the product they intended on buying because they feel they are
paying for something they don’t want.

I recently saw a TV spot offering a very small table to be
used  whenever  you  needed  to  work  or  eat  while  watching TV.
The free bonus gift was a cloth TV remote holder that you would
drape over the side of your chair. Even though logically the cloth
remote holder made sense because the table would be used pri-
marily for TV, this was a bad idea. First, your chair may not have
a side to it. Secondly, many viewers may not care for the free gift
anyway and would reject the main offer because in their minds
they would be paying more for something they didn’t want.

The key in all these offers is to test the free gift versus no
gift  and  maybe  against  another  gift.  It  is  during  the  testing
process that you ﬁnd out what really works, and it is often not
what you expected.

The Infomercial
The infomercial (half-hour commercial), commonly referred to
in the advertising trade as long-form TV, became an advertising

294

W R I T I N G   F O R   D I F F E R E N T   M E D I A

phenomenon  in  the  mid-1980s  when  the  Federal  Communica-
tions  Commission  (FCC)  deregulated  many  of  its  policies  and
allowed for the broadcast of 30 minutes of straight advertising.

At  ﬁrst,  real  estate  shows  appeared  on  the  air.  Then  the
BluBlocker  sunglasses  made  their  ﬁrst  showing  in  1986,  and
shortly thereafter came the exercise, self-help and get-rich-quick
shows.  Infomercials  became  extremely  popular  in  a  very  short
period  of  time.  Overnight  companies  launched  what  soon  be-
came household names. Some marketers became instant million-
aires, making small fortunes in just a few months, while others
lost millions and went bankrupt just as quickly.

The  key  to  this  medium  is  to  determine  a  good  format  in
which to present your show. It should resemble what is popular
and  what  is  currently  being  broadcast.  For  example,  if  reality
shows are popular, then maybe your product would lend itself to
a reality show. If interview shows like Larry King Live are popu-
lar, then set up an interview format. If your product would ap-
peal to the Oprah Winfrey Show audience, then set use a set that
looks  similar  to  Oprah’s.  In  short,  you  identify  with  a  popular
format  that  ﬁts  your  product  and  with  which  your  prospective
audience is comfortable and that they can harmonize with.

A good  example  of  this  approach  is  our  BluBlocker  in-
fomercial, which ran in four different versions for six years and
created a brand name for sunglasses from all the exposure, not to
mention a lot of sales. I used a candid-camera approach famous
during the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. I would walk up to strangers
and interview them right on the street or on the beach, and then
have them try on my sunglasses and react with surprised expres-
sions of wonder or amazement.

For a product to work on long-form TV, the keys for suc-
cess are a good product in the $39 to $250 price range with sufﬁ-
cient margin or one that has good continuity and back-end sales
potential—in short, a product that you can automatically ship to
your customers every month like vitamins or one that has strong
sales after the initial sale. With a half hour you have more time to
sell  and  therefore  can  justify  a  purchase  to  the  viewer  much
more easily than you can in a TV spot.

Today, the infomercial industry has shaken out the ﬂy-by-

295

U T I L I Z I N G   Y O U R   C O P Y W R I T I N G   S K I L L S

nights, and only the more experienced and stable companies re-
main. It is also a lot more difﬁcult to succeed in this ﬁeld unless
you really know what you are doing. And that includes knowing
the importance of a product with continuity and back-end sales.

Back-End Sales
When you produce a successful TV spot or infomercial and your
customer calls to order your product, there is a major sales op-
portunity available to you while your customer is on the phone.
The  sale  in  this  case  is  called  back-end  sales,  or  what  is  com-
monly  called  in  the  industry  “upsells.”  Often,  you  can  take  a
simple $49.95 sale and turn it into a $200 sale if you come up
with some good products to enhance the initial purchase or even
a  service  that  your  prospect  may  want  after  the  sale  such  as
coaching in the case of some income opportunity shows.

For  example,  when  I  called  to  order  the  knife  set  Ron
Popeil offered in an infomercial in early 2006, the operator had
a script she used to try to sell me more related products. This is
one  more  opportunity  for  a  copywriter  to  come  up  with  sales
copy to increase the sales of the product that was originally of-
fered.  It  may  be  copy  that  says,  “Because  you  are  ordering
within 20 minutes of the show, you are entitled to buy our spe-
cial  deluxe  knife  set  holder.  This  handsome  wooden  holder
comes  with  engraved  names  for  each  of  the  knives  you  have
ordered. . . .”

You can offer anything from a deluxe version of a product
or a second one at a discount to a complete set of something that
may  relate  to  your  product  or  even  the  opportunity  to  get  the
product  for  less  if  the  buyer  signs  up  for  automatic  shipments
(what is called “continuity”).

As a copywriter, you may be asked to write copy for the up-
sell. After all, it is a form of selling and you should be prepared
to  write  copy  for  this  selling  opportunity.  My  suggestion  is  to
call up and order some of the products on TV and see how the
operators handle their upsells. Often the upsell will vary greatly
depending on the current approach to upsells. For example, to-
day  many  upsells  try  to  encourage  continuity  sales  (regular
monthly shipments), and other times it might be coaching or a

296

W R I T I N G   F O R   D I F F E R E N T   M E D I A

deluxe version of something. Keeping your ﬁngers on the pulse
of the market is an excellent way for you to become an expert on
this  important  selling  opportunity.  Once  you  are  knowledgable
about  the  product,  the  prospect  and  even  the  currently  offered
upsells  by  others,  you’ll  be  able  to  apply  the  same  principles
you’ve already learned to come up with a variety of different ap-
proaches,  all  of  which  will  require  testing  to  determine  which
one will work best.

After-Sale Opportunities
If you thought that the upsell was the last opportunity to make
that sale, think again. You now have a huge mailing list of those
who have bought your product from your ads on TV, some with
average orders and others spending into the hundreds of dollars.
How do you address these people to sell them more? What
tricks of the copywriting trade do you use to entice them to keep
buying from you?

Here’s a clue. If you have a list that was gathered from cus-
tomers who bought on TV, use telemarketing. If they bought out
of a catalog or from a print ad, use print or direct mail.

You may be wasting your time and money trying to reach
somebody using a catalog or a direct mail solicitation when the
telephone is the way to reach them. And a good copywriter will
create a good telephone selling message to reach this potentially
lucrative audience.

Again, using the principles already expressed in this hand-
book is a start. Begin the conversation with the purpose of estab-
lishing dialogue: “Mrs. Jones, how are you today?” “Fine,” she
says. Then you respond with the reason you are calling and the
offer you are making with the hope of having each question you
ask  elicit  a  yes  or  positive  answer.  For  example,  “I  understand
you have purchased Ron Popeil’s knife set—is that correct?”

Your  customer  once  again  responds  with  a  positive  re-
sponse. “Yes, I did” might be the answer. You have now estab-
lished rapport and have gotten the start of the “yes” answers you
need to create the harmony required to lead you to a positive an-
swer when you ask for the sale.

“Well,  Mrs.  Jones,  Ron  Popeil  has  asked  me  to  call  you

297

U T I L I Z I N G   Y O U R   C O P Y W R I T I N G   S K I L L S

with a special offer—something that would go nicely with your
knife set.” Here you are using a little bit of curiosity. What is the
thing Ron Popeil is offering? “Do you have a minute to talk?”
Here  you  are  getting  another  yes.  Then  you  go  into  the  sales
pitch and ask, “How many sets would you like?”

Home Shopping
I’ve  had  a  lot  of  experience  selling  on  QVC—the  home  shop-
ping network both in Europe and in the United States. There is
not  much  a  copywriter  needs  to  do  there  except  for  creating  a
written sales pitch the show hosts use to brief themselves. Again,
it  is  the  job  of  the  copywriter  to  describe  the  product,  brieﬂy
mentioning all its beneﬁts and features. You can recommend var-
ious upsells and create the copy for the operators, but very often
the upsell is up to QVC both to script and to use as they see ﬁt.

The  home  shopping  networks  in  the  United  States  and
throughout  the  world  are  usually  live  broadcasts  without  the
need for scripts, but they are worth mentioning if only to show
that a copywriter’s job can cover all of the aspects of TV regard-
less of the form it may take.

QVC does over $6 billion in sales a year. Their programs
reach millions of households and have successfully delivered to
consumers quality, value and convenience. And they love prod-
ucts that have proven themselves both in print and on TV. So if
you are successful with a product in the other formats mentioned
here, QVC would make a great opportunity for you once you’ve
proven that you have a winning product.

Once  during  a  “Today’s  Special  Value”  feature  on  QVC
over  250,000  pairs  of  BluBlockers  were  sold.  Now,  that  is  in-
credible power—and all in one day.

The Internet
The  Internet  holds  such  incredible  advantages  for  copywriters
and  marketers  that  it  indeed  has  become  a  major  revolution  in
sales and marketing. And it will continue to grow now and well
into the future. There are four reasons for this.

First, you can be a tiny company with little means but look
like  even  the  biggest  companies  on  the  Internet.  In  short,  your
environment is your graphic presentation. The Internet levels the

298

W R I T I N G   F O R   D I F F E R E N T   M E D I A

playing ﬁeld, and graphics determine your image. Your race, re-
ligion and age do not matter. Cameron Johnson made millions of
dollars  on  the  Internet  before  he  reached  voting  age. At  15  he
earned  $50,000  selling  Beanie  Babies  and  went  on  to  earn
$15,000 a day on one of his many sites. Now, at 21, he’s one of
the most successful Internet marketers in history—and note, he
started as a teenager.

Second, testing is now less expensive and more immediate.
You  can  easily  test  a  marketing  concept  and  your  copy—even
test the results of changing just a few words—to determine the
difference in response, and all at almost no cost. This is a major
breakthrough in the art and science of testing.

Third, the speed at which you can come up with an idea and
implement it quickly at low cost dwarfs almost every other form
of selling and marketing. This is a wonderful time to be living if
you love copywriting and marketing.

Finally, there are many ways to sell using the Internet: e-
mail  broadcasts,  using  other  media  to  call  attention  to  your
web site, links from other web sites, afﬁliate programs and the
list goes on.

And with the emergence of Internet video, a new dimension
has been added—all the features of television combined with all
the advantages of the Internet—resulting in a powerful medium,
one  that  is  still  expanding  and  unfolding.  As  bandwidth  and
video grow on the Web, so do the possibilities for an extremely
effective way to grow a business.

How does a copywriter tackle a copywriting assignment to
write copy for the Internet? How do we write for the Internet?
How do you capture a prospect on this unique and exciting for-
mat? It’s more involved than you may think, but once you under-
stand some of the thinking and the marketing principles behind
the format you can truly build an empire.

First you’ve got to get people to read your copy. They either
have  to  hear  about  your  web  site  from  some  publicity  you’ve
generated, advertising you’ve done, links from other web sites or
e-mail broadcasts you make. The problem is that people refer to
unsolicited e-mails as spam and therefore unwanted.

you  to  build  your  opt-in  names  and  consequently  send  them
communications  they  would  not  only  be  interested  in  but  look
forward to receiving on a frequent basis.

Some  companies  have  found  that  sending  a  catalog  to  a
prospect  from  which  the  prospect  buys  creates  a  great  opt-in
buyer  who  can  easily  become  a  future  Web  buyer.  Catalog
sales are dropping while Internet sales grow, but this doesn’t
mean that the catalog is dead or dying. It’s still alive and well
and  really  needed  to  break  through  the  bad  reputation  spam
has given the Web.

The catalog qualiﬁes the buyer as a potential Internet buyer.
And so would a TV spot or a radio announcement. Your list of
customers  culled  from  some  other  form  of  advertising  can  be-
come a major source of hot prospects and future customers for
Internet sales.

There are a few different formats that you can use to apply
your  copywriting  skills  on  the  Web.  There’s  the  e-mail  broad-
cast, the web site home page, the web catalog, the blog, the e-
zine, the long sales letter and various combinations using video,
links and search engine optimization to attract those prospects.

You can see how many different formats and combinations
there are and how varied each can be. So let’s take the most im-
portant ones and see how the various principles you’ve learned
early in this handbook apply. But let me warn you. A lot of what
I will describe is more marketing oriented than it is copywriting
oriented. But to be a great copywriter you must learn everything
you can about the medium you are working in. And if you know
positively  that  something  won’t  work,  you’ll  save  yourself  or
your client a lot of time and money. So get ready for some good
marketing tips and insights on how to make the World Wide Web
work for you.

The E-Mail Broadcast
As in direct mail, e-mail is the most personal form of communi-
cation on the Web. In fact, using many of the word processing
programs,  you  can  personalize  each  letter  with  the  recipient’s
name. Not only can you start the body of the e-mail with a ﬁrst
or last name, but you can also add personal information or para-

300

W R I T I N G   F O R   D I F F E R E N T   M E D I A

graphs that make each broadcast even more personal. And you
can sign each e-mail with your own signature. But be careful not
to overdo it. Your letter should sound like a very personal letter,
not like you’ve just discovered a new personalization technique
and you’re overdoing it.

The  principle  of  having  a  personal  communication  with
your  prospect  is  important  here.  The  more  personal  the  better.
Keep it brief. If your e-mail is too long, it appears very intimi-
dating and you’ll lose the reader. Remember, the average person
in  business  has  to  ﬁlter  through  hundreds  of  messages  a  day.
Keeping your message brief and offering a link to a catalog or a
longer sales message is the approach you should use.

Unlike  other  forms  of  personal  communication,  the  great
number of e-mails received during a typical business day and the
prevalence of spam mean that recipients are very jaded in what
they will even open and read. The ﬁrst step in enticing them is to
get them to read the subject line. I know that in a long list of e-
mails waiting for me, the ﬁrst thing I do is scan the subject lines.
If I ﬁnd one that interests me or I recognize the person or com-
pany that sent it, I will open it ﬁrst. In this process, I will also
delete the ones I don’t have time for or I know are spam.

A subject  line  should  be  brief  and  either  let  the  prospect
clearly  know  who  is  sending  it  or  cover  a  subject  that  your
prospect  would  be  interested  in.  I  hope  your  business  isn’t  the
stock market, real estate or a pharmacy selling Viagra. It seems
that most of the spam is from these types of companies and the
average recipient is already deleting a lot of that with spam ﬁlters.
Your subject line is like the envelope of a direct mail cam-
paign. The envelope copy compares to a headline in a mail order
print ad. In an e-mail, that subject line is a tough one ﬁrst to get
through the spam ﬁlters and then to draw the attention of recipi-
ents who often discard it as more spam.

Let’s say you have a great headline, one that won’t be ﬁl-
tered out by the spam ﬁlters, which delete such words as “Free”
or “Viagra” or “Low Interest Rates” or—well, you get the pic-
ture—seemingly all of the words that a sales message might use
in a headline. Then how should the copy read?

Well, I’ve already said that the copy should be brief. Maybe

301

U T I L I Z I N G   Y O U R   C O P Y W R I T I N G   S K I L L S

the subject line could direct the prospect someplace else where
the message is a lot longer.

Joe Vitale, proliﬁc top-selling author whose recent book is
There’s  A  Customer  Born  Every  Minute (John  Wiley  &  Sons,
2006), says that the copy should be what he calls “relationship
builders.” In short, don’t try to sell anything but rather develop a
dialogue and a level of trust with your prospect.

Get prospects to open your e-mail each time you send one
because you are sharing valuable or useful information that they
appreciate. Your words should make prospects get into the habit
of  opening  your  e-mail.  By  sharing  this  sought-after  informa-
tion, it is easy then to wax enthusiastic about a product that you
have and would like to sell them.

By the time you do that, the prospect feels a little guilty if
he or she doesn’t respond. Plus you’ve developed this wonderful
rapport and they feel they can trust you. You have integrity.

Vitale calls it “karmic marketing.” Do enough good by giv-
ing of yourself and your knowledge to help people and you will
reap the rewards at the end. “It’s really karmic,” says Vitale.

Joe  Polish,  a  top-niche  marketing  expert  from  Phoenix,
agrees. He says, “You need to educate and provide value in your
e-mails.  Only  after  you’ve  communicated  and  provided  value
and  even  bonded  with  the  prospect  do  you  start  to  offer  them
your product or service.”

Polish says there are three elements to obtain good opt-in e-
mail addresses—push, pull and dangle. You pull them from your
media ads or any off-line activities. Then you dangle something
free that would interest them. And ﬁnally you push out market-
ing messages. Money is made only on the last step.

Polish feels that there are two types of marketing methods:
transaction versus relationship marketing. Once you develop the
relationship,  it  is  much  easier  to  succeed  in  selling  something
than it is in strictly a transaction situation where you are selling
right off the bat. And many marketers don’t realize this.

The Long Internet Letter
Just as the long copy ads of the past 35 years have been a great
method  of  conveying  the  value  of  premium  products  and  ser-

302

W R I T I N G   F O R   D I F F E R E N T   M E D I A

vices, there is an equivalent on the Internet—the long letter or e-
zine (an Internet version of a sales magazine).

I  have  seen  letters  that  were  32  pages  long  on  the Web.  I
have seen testimonials not only in full color with actual people
and real names but also with sound and video. The testimonials
come alive, and you are the one who can play them simply by
clicking on the control strip located below the picture.

The art in all this technology gives Internet marketers tools
they never had before and an involvement with the prospect that
was never even imagined a decade ago.

As  a  copywriter  you  use  the  same  principles  you  would
use to write that print ad but you add a few bells and whistles
to enhance your message. In general, the longer the copy, the
more  expensive  the  purchase.  But  regardless  of  how  much
copy  you  use,  it  should  be  so  interesting  and  compelling  that
your prospects feel like they are on a slippery slide, unable to
stop reading.

Now  here  is  where  the  difference  comes  in  between  the
print ad and the Internet ad. In a print ad, the prospect knows to
glance at the end of the ad to get a summary of the offer and all
the  ordering  information.  Not  so  with  a  long  Internet  ad.
Throughout the ad you need to have “Buy Now” buttons on al-
most every screen, even at the very beginning of the ad.

In a print ad it is very helpful to have paragraph headings
to  make  the  copy  look  less  intimidating.  That  makes  a  lot  of
sense. In a long Internet letter having paragraph headings could
serve  that  purpose  as  well.  But  if  you  make  those  paragraph
headings into links that go straight to your order page, you can
accomplish both—a less intimidating look and a direct link to
your order page.

I always recommend having testimonials in a print ad and
to  make  sure  the  testimonials  are  genuine.  They  become  even
more real and believable when you can include the testimonial
givers’ true names and actual hometowns.

The  Internet  takes  the  matter  of  testimonials  one  notch
higher by incorporating both audio and video. You click on the
“Play”  button  and  the  person  recites  his  or  her  glowing  com-
ments with both sound and motion. In short, you are harnessing

303

U T I L I Z I N G   Y O U R   C O P Y W R I T I N G   S K I L L S

the advantages of television to make the testimonials that much
more impressive. And you can do that several times in a single
letter. You can put them at the beginning or the end, group them
in the middle, or sprinkle them throughout the letter.

The  long  letter  does  not  have  to  limit  audio  and  video  to
just  testimonials.  Often  a  small  demonstration  might  make
sense. Or the person making the sales presentation could do it in
a video clip. But be careful. Make sure the person has good dic-
tion,  can  speak  naturally,  not  like  he  or  she  is  reading  from  a
script,  and  looks  presentable. Whether  you  like  it  or  not,  there
will be some out there who will judge the presenter on his or her
looks  and  you  may  evoke  a  negative  emotion  from  some
prospects and lose them as customers—just because they didn’t
like the presenter’s handsome face or gorgeous ﬁgure. Test the
letter with and without the video or your audio sales presentation
and ﬁnd out if you are creating bad emotional response.

Your  picture  should  be  in  that  long  letter. Again,  like  the
testimonial, it evokes trust and conﬁdence. Prospects feel a real
person  is  behind  the  product  or  service  they  are  contemplating
purchasing.

Long copy is both informative and educational. As long as
you are providing very interesting information to somebody who
is hungry for that information, the length of the letter does not
matter. Just follow the basic principles of copywriting explained
in  the  ﬁrst  part  of  this  handbook,  incorporate  a  lot  of  the  new
video technology if it makes sense, and you will truly capture the
attention, respect and trust of your prospect. And you will make
plenty of sales in the process.

The Internet Infomercial
It  would  stand  to  reason  that  the  Internet  would  be  the  ideal
place  to  run  infomercials.  After  all,  you’ve  got  the  audio  and
video  capabilities  right  on  your  computer—the  same  elements
you see on commercial or cable TV.

And  if  somebody  is  interested  in  your  product  or  service,
they’ll appreciate seeing and hearing as much information about
it as possible.

Typically, the length of an infomercial on TV is 281/2 min-

304

W R I T I N G   F O R   D I F F E R E N T   M E D I A

utes. But when you are using the Web, your infomercial can be
any length you want. You can run one on TV and run it on the
Web in its full length or you can edit it to 15 minutes and run it
in a shorter format. There are also a few rules to keep in mind as
you prepare an infomercial for the Web.

The  ﬁrst  rule  is  regarding  price:  The  more  expensive  the

product, in general, the longer the infomercial.

The second rule covers the ordering process. Since you are
on the Web, you can make it very easy to place an order. Simply
put an “Order Now” button on your screen when you would nor-
mally put the call to action. (It can be in the ﬁrst ﬁve minutes or
later in the show.) Your prospect will press the Order Now but-
ton and place the order.

The  third  rule  to  remember  has  to  do  with  attention  span.
Your  typical  Internet  viewer  has  a  much  shorter  attention  span
than your TV viewer and is more likely to leave your site than a
TV viewer is to switch channels. TV viewers are accustomed to
half-hour segments, so once they are viewing a show they may
be less inclined to change channels. If they did, they would end
up in the middle of some other program. Not so on the Internet.
They  can  go  anywhere  on  their  computers—from  checking  e-
mail to ﬁnding something else that might interest them. So you
need to keep your presentation interesting, fast moving, and in
most cases shorter than an infomercial on TV.

Finally, don’t forget the upsell potential on your infomer-
cial. You can do the upsell with audio and video once they’ve
made  the  buying  decision  and  have  placed  the  order.  You
should also list the toll-free number. Many will not feel com-
fortable placing their order on the Web and will want to talk to
a real human.

Your  infomercial  need  not  be  expensive.  You  can  shoot
your program with a good quality consumer video camera. And
it  could  be  a  simple  format  like  you  being  interviewed  by
somebody.

You will start seeing more and more infomercials on the In-
ternet in the very near future. In fact, I predict that this will be
one of the fastest growing segments on the Internet, so consider
it when you look at your media mix.

The Book Promotion
One of the major changes in marketing has occurred in the book
industry. Traditionally, an author, to get his or her book onto the
best seller lists, had to go on a major public relations (PR) tour
and do book signings, besides getting great reviews and spend-
ing plenty of money on advertising. All that has changed as a re-
sult  of  the  Internet,  and  now  smart  authors  are  taking  a  totally
different route.

Here’s  what  a  copywriter  should  know  to  write  excellent
copy to create a promotion leading to a number one best seller.
And here’s the good part: If you’re an author, you need none of
the old methods you had to use before the advent of the Internet.
Here’s what successful authors are doing now.

A week before the publication date of a book, an author will
create a web site in which he plugs his book and makes an offer
to his opt-in list. He encourages his list to buy the book on its re-
lease date, so all the response comes in at once. Each prospect
who  buys  the  book  on  the  very  day  it  is  released  receives  free
goodies worth sometimes thousands of dollars. The free goodies
often come from the author and the author’s friends.

And these friends also sell books, have web sites, and are
happy to supply their goodies to the author because doing so en-
ables them to expand their own opt-in lists. These friends then
broadcast the author’s offer to their entire opt-in lists, too. Each
friend’s free gift to a book purchaser has a catch to it. The free
gift requires the e-mail address and name of the recipient of the
free gift in order to have access to it. This builds the friend’s opt-
in  e-mail  list  and  becomes  a  win-win  for  both  parties.  Expand
this  to  a  dozen  friends  looking  to  expand  their  opt-in  lists  and
you can see the viral effect this can have for the book’s success
and for the friends’ ability to increase their opt-in names.

The free gifts usually cover electronic ﬁles a customer can
obtain over the Internet by downloading some report or a portion
of an e-book or some similar item.

Joe Vitale  offered  his  recent  book,  Life’s  Missing  Instruc-
tion Manual (John Wiley & Sons, 2006), along with numerous
gifts as part of the purchase if his opt-in list members would or-
der through Amazon.com or Barnes&Noble.com on the publica-

306

W R I T I N G   F O R   D I F F E R E N T   M E D I A

tion day. Over 35,000 books were quickly sold and the book was
number one on Amazon.com for four straight days.

Dozens of Vitale’s friends participated in the offer both by
supplying their own free gifts for his promotion and volunteer-
ing their opt-in lists to spread the word. Millions of opt-in names
were contacted, and the response catapulted the book to the top
slot on Amazon.com. As a result of what was accomplished and
the  resulting  publicity  associated  with  making  the  number  one
list, a single chain purchased 10,000 books.

“The  gifts  were  well  thought  out,”  says  Vitale.  “You  just
don’t offer any old thing but items that the prospect might buy
just on its own. I look for quality items to offer.”

Recently,  Wayne  Dyer,  a  spiritual  guru  and  author  of  the
million seller Your Erroneous Zones (Funk & Wagnalls, 1976),
did  a  major  promotion  of  his  new  best  seller,  Inspiration (Hay
House,  2006).  He  used  the  Internet  selling  method  described
here despite his best-selling-author image. In short, even estab-
lished,  highly  respected  authors  are  using  this  method.  This
handbook that you are holding was to be introduced this way. If
you’re just starting out with your ﬁrst book, you have the oppor-
tunity  to  become  a  successful  author  using  this  method.  The
playing ﬁeld is much more level than at any other time in the his-
tory of the publishing industry.

The Personal Blog
It  started  as  a  way  of  giving  people  the  opportunity  to  express
themselves, tell the world what they are doing and share every-
thing from pictures to emotions—a great opportunity for people
who enjoy writing.

Web logs, or blogs, are now a major trend throughout the
world, with people in all walks of life starting them—from doc-
tors to students, from housewives to authors. It is easy to set one
up, fun to watch it grow and a way to promote yourself if you are
a  copywriter  or  certainly  a  way  to  share  your  personality  and
your view of events with the world.

So if you’re a copywriter, set one up if you haven’t already
done  so.  And  express  yourself  in  writing  each  day.  You’ll  be
amazed at how your writing will improve and how many people
will be interested in reading your musings.

307

U T I L I Z I N G   Y O U R   C O P Y W R I T I N G   S K I L L S

The search engines that look for content pay considerable
attention  to  blogs,  often  placing  them  quite  high  on  search  re-
sults lists. And one of the tips that Joe Vitale offers if you want
high  search  engine  presence  is  to  use  popular  events,  current
trends and famous names to get the best rankings. Vitale ran the
headline,  “What  I  Learned  from  Lindsay  Lohan  about  Losing
Weight,” and it was picked up prominently by the search engines
simply because of the association with a famous personality.

Once  again,  a  blog  is  a  great  way  to  expand  your  writing
skills. You can do reviews, entertain or even brag a little about
what you do. It’s all fair game on a blog. Go for it.

The Viral Transmission
Don’t worry, it’s not a new disease and you won’t need any vac-
cine. Here’s how it works. Let’s say you have a brand-name prod-
uct and you want to promote the brand. Or you have a web site
and want to attract more hits. You can do what I did along with a
friend, Stan Oliver, to promote the BluBlocker brand name.

Oliver has a web site that promotes his “CyberSpacers” car-
toon  characters.  BluBlocker  has  its  web  site  that  promotes  its
sunglasses. What Oliver did was locate an exciting video game
that  had  been  developed  in  one  of  the  Eastern  European  coun-
tries and obtain a license to use the game software. With the help
of  a  cartoonist  he  turned  it  into  a  game  that  incorporated  sun-
glasses, video game action and his cartoon characters.

He  then  made  contact  with  a  small  advertising  agency  in
London that I visited. The agency specialized in sending broad-
casts  out  through  the  Internet  with  games  or  humorous  anima-
tion. After they transmit the game they then monitor and rank the
game to determine how many times it has been played in which
country over a period of time.

Since  there  are  several  similar  games  or  video  clips,  each
item is ranked according to number of hits. Within a week of our
game’s launch, it became a major hit, scoring number one in the
rankings  (the  King  Kong  game  promoting  the  2005  movie
ranked  second).  The  more  than  1.5  million  hits  on  our  game
came  from  many  countries  throughout  the  world.  Every  conti-
nent  and  almost  every  major  country  had  people  playing  the

308

W R I T I N G   F O R   D I F F E R E N T   M E D I A

game. The hits to the BluBlocker web site grew as well, and the
brand  became  known  to  a  whole  new  generation  of  prospects.
And sales followed suit.

It  was  easy  to  understand  the  viral  nature  of  the  game.
When somebody played it and liked it, they referred their friends
to it, who downloaded it, played it and then recommended it to
all  of  their  friends.  If  you  do  the  math,  you  see  it  doesn’t  take
long for the game to circle the globe. And that’s what this game
did. In fact, it probably is still circling the globe as you read this.
With a program like this, we added copy to our web site to
take advantage of the exposure and to suggest to those visiting
us  for  the  ﬁrst  time  to  check  out  our  store. As  a  copywriter,  I
needed to turn those visits into sales. I had to write copy to get
our visitors involved with getting to know more about our line of
sunglasses.

If you have a client and he or she wants to explore the oppor-
tunities  with  viral  broadcasts,  you  now  know  how  it’s  done  and
what you need to do to take advantage of this new opportunity.

The Internet Store
People love to shop on the Internet. It’s convenient and generally
fast, often beating the time needed to call a live operator to place
an order.

To run a successful Internet store you have to learn a few
basic principles. First, let’s start with a few assumptions. Ideally,
prospects have bought from a catalog, know the store that con-
tacted  them  or  searched  on  a  search  engine  for  a  store  selling
what they are looking for. They’ve also agreed to opt in for fu-
ture offers.

Great. These people are now excellent prospects for future
purchases. Your  Internet  company  then  sends  an  e-mail  broad-
cast to its list. A recipient opens the e-mail to see what the com-
pany has to offer.

Here’s where the offer has to be so simple that it will take
only seconds to comprehend. Let’s assume for a moment some-
one purchases a leather jacket on the Internet after ﬁnding a store
that has the style she is looking for.

The  package  arrives  quickly.  This  is  very  important.  The

309

U T I L I Z I N G   Y O U R   C O P Y W R I T I N G   S K I L L S

main advantage of buying retail is that you can bring the product
home with you. No waiting. Instant gratiﬁcation is what a retail
store  offers.  But  when  you  buy  through  the  Internet  and  the
product is shipped to you, there is a lag time. To beat the retailers
at their own game, Internet stores have learned to ship almost on
the  same  day  if  possible  to  allow  that  item  to  arrive  quickly.
Shipping promptly greatly reduces the advantage retail has over
mail order.

Let’s get back to that company that sold the leather jacket.
The customer likes the jacket when she receives it and sees that
the invoice states clearly how she could return it if by chance she
didn’t like it. So far, so good. The leather company has built trust
in her continuing as a loyal customer. She wouldn’t mind receiv-
ing e-mails from that company in the future.

Then an e-mail from the store does arrive. The subject line
is “20% Off on Leather.” And as I mentioned previously, open-
ing  the  e-mail  reveals  a  single  simple  message  with  a  nice
graphic  background.  There  is  enough  curiosity  to  cause  her  to
click  on  the  image  shown  in  the  e-mail  and  connect  with  the
store. This ﬁrst click gets her to the web site, where she can shop
for anything else she might want to buy.

The  store  has  a  list  of  product  categories  of  all  its  leather
products from clothes to accessories, from motorcycle jackets to
fashion jackets. You then click on the category you would like to
explore and the category appears with several thumbnail photos
of various products that come under this category. You then click
on the picture of the item you are interested in and immediately
it enlarges to give you a better view of the product and some text
describing the item.

This is where I ﬁnd a lot of companies fail. They don’t de-
scribe the items in enough detail to make the prospect feel com-
fortable with their purchase. And I suspect dissatisfaction return
rates would drop if they did. But you as a copywriter reading this
handbook will know this and will provide more text in the de-
scription.  Just  mentioning  color,  size  and  texture  won’t  cut  it.
You need something more. Maybe talk about the type of leather,
where it was made, how it was sewn, what features make it bet-
ter than any other similar product. Include as much information

310

W R I T I N G   F O R   D I F F E R E N T   M E D I A

about  the  item  as  possible.  People  don’t  mind  reading  about
something they are about to buy.

One of the things you want to do for your store is to make
sure that ordering is quick and easy. It has been proven that the
more clicks required to consummate a purchase, the less likely it
is  that  the  purchase  will  be  made.  Requiring  several  clicks  al-
lows  the  potential  purchaser  to  change  his  or  her  mind.  When
Amazon.com sends me an e-mail with a book offer, I can order it
with just a few clicks. I don’t mind spending a minute or so to
order the book, as it would have taken me an enormous amount
of time to shop at a retail bookstore.

Make sure you keep your clicks to a minimum, you deliver
quickly and you describe your products fully, and you’ll have a
lot of success with your web site store.

The Future of the Internet
In  the  early  1980s  I  predicted  in  American  Airlines’ in-ﬂight
magazine  that  the  TV,  the  home  computer  and  the  telephone
would  merge  into  a  single  entity  that  would  provide  entertain-
ment, enable communications and become a great research tool.
We have already reached that point and have gone well beyond
it. We can now watch TV shows on our computers, we can shop
the far reaches of the world and we have at our ﬁngertips the re-
search tools to ﬁnd anything we want when we want it. It truly is
an amazing time we live in.

But  even  more  amazing  is  the  equal  opportunity  the  Web
offers everyone reading this handbook. From aspiring entrepre-
neurs to experienced marketers, the Web is offering a new and
more efﬁcient way to distribute, sell or market products and ser-
vices. And we are only at the beginning of that revolution. There
is a lot more to come.

With the ability to communicate in writing you hold one of
the keys to this fast-emerging technology—a technology to en-
rich your life and indeed the lives of others.

Some Final Thoughts Epilogue

The  material  that  you  have  read  was  based  on  an  exclusive
seminar I conducted from 1977 through 2000. During this time I
taught many students who went on to build great companies and
fortunes for themselves. I’m proud of them all.

And you should be proud of yourself, too, for having read
this  book. You  have  had  to  read  and  learn  a  great  deal.  I  hope
you will use this material to contribute to your community and to
your country in a positive and productive way through the infor-
mative, entertaining and effective use of advertising.

There  are  many  businesses  to  build  in  the  future.  There’s
the Internet and all the opportunities associated with it. There’s
the  combination  of  direct  marketing  and  the  new  technologies
that are only now being developed even as you read this. Con-
gratulations for making the effort to succeed.

I am not the smartest of men. Had I been smarter I would
not  have  made  many  of  the  mistakes  I  did.  I  would  have  read
more of the direct marketing books and learned more that would
have  prevented  those  mistakes  from  ever  happening.  I  would
have  tested  more.  I  would  have  thought  more  carefully  before
risking my money and my time.

I  never  graduated  from  college,  my  grades  were  not  great
and I practically ﬂunked English. I’ve never taken an advertising
course (although that may have been the best educational break I
ever had) and I’m not formally educated in many of the subjects
necessary to ply my craft.

I am also not that much more talented than others. There are
many  great  writers,  marketers  and  entrepreneurs.  If  you  work
longer hours, if you risk more of your time and capital, eventu-
ally you learn. I worked and risked a lot. And I learned a lot.

Then what do I have? I would say two things could sum me
up. The ﬁrst is the skill I have to take a very complex issue and
present  it  in  a  very  simple,  understandable  way—in  short,  my

313

E P I L O G U E :   S O M E   F I N A L   T H O U G H T S

communications skill. Because of it, I therefore became a good
teacher and was able to pass along to my students the underly-
ing reasons for why things work. I was able to share the many
experiences  I’ve  had  and  point  out  the  real  lessons  that  I
learned. Very often a teacher does not make a good practitioner
and a practitioner does not make a good teacher. I like to think I
can do both.

The second thing I have is persistence. I don’t easily give
up. And if I do, it is not without a very good reason. To me, it
wasn’t whether I won or lost that was important. It was whether I
played the game. And I played hard.

There comes a time in your life to step out of the trenches
and share the knowledge that you have acquired in your years of
battle—to  examine  the  scars  and  reﬂect  on  the  lessons  and  the
often odd directions you’ve taken. For me, that time is right now
and this book is a product of that introspection.

Claude Hopkins, one of the early pioneers in advertising,
explained why he wrote his book My Life in Advertising in the
1920s: “Any  man  who  by  a  lifetime  of  excessive  application
learns  more  about  anything  than  others  owes  a  statement  to
successors.”

If  I  had  to  pick  another  motivation  for  writing  this  book,  it
would be my strong desire to give of myself to others. I learned
more at my seminars by giving and sharing than I did at any time
before or after. And aside from acquiring many insights from the
seminar  participants  themselves,  I  was  forced  to  organize  and
articulate my concepts to present them properly—which made me
a better copywriter and marketer, as I soon started following my
own advice.

Many  of  the  seminar  participants  were  highly  motivated.
You had to be motivated to spend up to $3,000 to attend. And to
get to know more than 200 of them personally—their successes,
their failures and the lessons they learned—simply added to my
base of knowledge and experience. You learn from the mistakes
and failures of others, and as I was sharing my mistakes and fail-
ures, so were they sharing theirs.

As mentioned in Chapter 1, Edwin Land, the inventor of the
Polaroid  camera,  once  said,  “A mistake  is  a  future  beneﬁt,  the

314

E P I L O G U E :   S O M E   F I N A L   T H O U G H T S

full value of which is yet to be realized.” And in that spirit many
of  my  mistakes  became  learning  tools  that  I  shared  with  my
students and that inspired them.

I  have  helped  many  entrepreneurs  build  outstanding  busi-
nesses and go on to contribute greatly to their industry and their
community. That is my greatest thrill. For if I can continue that
achievement with this book, I will have left a legacy that can live
long after I am gone.

Assumed Constraints, Continued Appendix A

As you can see from the diagram, by not assuming
any constraints the answer to the puzzle on page 56
becomes quite simple. All too often we assume con-
straints  that  aren’t  really  there.  By  breaking  out  of
the  box  you  can  come  up  with  incredibly  effective
answers—whether  you’re  writing  copy  or  simply
solving everyday problems.

Assumed Constraint Examples
The following are examples of assumed constraints
from history. When somebody tells you it can’t be
done, recall these seven historical examples before
you become discouraged.

1. “Drill  for  oil? You  mean  drill  into  the  ground  to  try  to  ﬁnd
oil? You’re crazy.” This was said by drillers whom wildcatter
Edwin L. Drake tried to enlist in his project to drill for oil in
1859.

2. “Airplanes  are  interesting  toys  but  of  no  military  value.”
Ferdinand  Foch, professor of  military  strategy,  Ecole
Superieure  de  Guerre,  later  commander  of Allied Armies
in World War I.

3. “Stocks  have  reached  what  looks  like  a  permanently  high
plateau.”  Irving  Fisher,  professor of  economics, Yale  Uni-
versity, 1929.

4. “I  think  there  is  a  world  market  for  maybe  ﬁve  computers.”

Thomas Watson Sr., president of IBM, 1943.

5. “So we went to Atari and said, ‘Hey, we’ve got this amazing
thing,  even  built  with  some  of  your  parts,  and  what  do  you
think about funding us? Or we’ll give it to you. We just want
to do it. Pay our salary, we’ll come work for you.’ And they
said, ‘No.’ So then we went to Hewlett-Packard, and they said,

317

A S S U M E D   C O N S T R A I N T S ,   C O N T I N U E D

‘Hey,  we  don’t  need  you.  You  haven’t  got  through  college
yet.’” This was related by Steven Jobs, Apple Computer co-
founder,  on  his  attempts  in  the  mid-1970s  to  get Atari  and
Hewlett-Packard  interested  in  his  and  Steve  Wozniak’s  per-
sonal computer.

6. “A cookie store is a bad idea. Besides, the market research re-
ports  say  America  likes  crispy  cookies,  not  soft  and  chewy
cookies like you make.” This was a response in the mid-1970s
to Debbi Fields’ idea of starting Mrs. Fields Cookies.

7. “640K  ought  to  be  enough  for  anybody.”  Bill  Gates,

Microsoft founder, 1981.

Seeds of Curiosity, Continued Appendix B

You couldn’t wait, could you? You had to turn to the back of the
book before you read the next line of copy in Chapter 10. Well,
you just fell for the seeds of curiosity theory big time:

Your message must always be so compelling that you moti-

vate the reader to do things normally not done.

I realize that you might think this is a dirty trick and the story
never  took  place. You’re  wrong  on  both  counts.  This  is  exactly
what happened and this is no dirty trick. But to get people to reach
into their pockets and exchange their hard-earned dollars for your
product is not a natural act. It’s one of the most difﬁcult things a
copywriter must do to sell a product. It requires tremendous moti-
vation—motivation  that  needs  to  be  generated  by  a  compelling
message, a message so compelling that people will become totally
involved with your copy, slide down the slippery slide and call or
write to place an order or feel guilty if they haven’t.

I guess it wouldn’t be fair, now that I’ve proven my point,
to leave you hanging. After all, you were so involved with my
text  that  you  skipped  all  the  rest  of  the  chapters  in  this  book
(something you normally wouldn’t do) to ﬁnd out exactly what
Ginger said to me at that dramatic moment in my ofﬁce.

“Joe, I want only you to help me. I want you as my mentor—
my guide through this direct marketing jungle. I don’t know what
I can do to motivate you to help me, but I do know what most men
appreciate. I’ve had men proposition me all my life but I’ve never
openly propositioned a man. What I’m saying, Joe, is that—”

“Wait,” I said, fumbling for words as I held up one hand as
if to say stop. “You’ve got the wrong guy. Don’t embarrass your-
self any further. I can no longer accept what I think you’re trying
to say. I can’t do the work for you. I’m really too busy to take
outside  projects.  But  attend  my  seminar.  I’ll  let  you  attend  for
free on the condition that you pay me back after you make your
ﬁrst million.”

319

S E E D S   O F   C U R I O S I T Y ,   C O N T I N U E D

Ginger left the ofﬁce, maybe a bit embarrassed. And I never
heard from her again. I suspect that she thought she could entice
me into writing copy by ﬂaunting her body. And would she have
really followed through? I guess I will never know.

When I returned home that evening and my wife asked me
how the day went, I replied, “Oh, I was almost seduced by a gor-
geous blonde who was willing to give me her body for my copy-
writing ability.”

Summary of Axioms and Major Points Appendix C

The following lists summarize the axioms and major points of
copywriting that have been presented throughout this book.

Axioms

Axiom  1: Copywriting  is  a  mental  process  the  successful
execution of which reﬂects the sum total of all your experiences,
your  speciﬁc  knowledge  and  your  ability  to  mentally  process
that information and transfer it onto a sheet of paper for the pur-
pose of selling a product or service. (page 24)

Axiom 2: All the elements in an advertisement are primar-
ily designed to do one thing and one thing only: get you to read
the ﬁrst sentence of the copy. (page 29)

Axiom 3: The sole purpose of the ﬁrst sentence in an adver-

tisement is to get you to read the second sentence. (page 33)

Axiom  4:  Your  ad  layout  and  the  ﬁrst  few  paragraphs  of
your ad must create the buying environment most conducive to
the sale of your product or service. (page 38)

Axiom  5:  Get  the  reader  to  say  yes  and  harmonize  with
your  accurate  and  truthful  statements  while  reading  your  copy.
(page 44)

Axiom 6: Your readers should be so compelled to read your
copy that they cannot stop reading until they read all of it as if
sliding down a slippery slide. (page 49)

Axiom  7: When  trying  to  solve  problems,  don’t  assume

constraints that aren’t really there. (page 58)

Axiom  8: Keep  the  copy  interesting  and  the  reader  inter-

ested through the power of curiosity. (page 63)

Axiom  9:  Never  sell  a  product  or  service. Always  sell  a

concept. (page 71)

Axiom  10:  The  incubation  process  is  the  power  of  your
subconscious mind to use all your knowledge and experiences to

321

S U M M A R Y   O F   A X I O M S   A N D   M A J O R   P O I N T S

solve a speciﬁc problem, and its efﬁciency is dictated by time,
creative orientation, environment and ego. (page 80)

Axiom 11: Copy should be long enough to cause the reader

to take the action you request. (page 85)

Axiom 12: Every communication should be a personal one,
from the writer to the recipient, regardless of the medium used.
(page 92)

Axiom 13: The ideas presented in your copy should ﬂow
in a logical fashion, anticipating your prospect’s questions and
answering  them  as  if  the  questions  were  asked  face-to-face.
(page 97)

Axiom 14: In the editing process, you reﬁne your copy to
express exactly what you want to express with the fewest words.
(page 102)

Axiom 15: Selling a cure is a lot easier than selling a pre-
ventive, unless the preventive is perceived as a cure or the cura-
tive aspects of the preventive are emphasized. (page 197)

Emotion Principles
These are the three points to remember about emotion in adver-
tising from page 66.

Emotion Principle 1: Every word has an emotion associ-

ated with it and tells a story.

Emotion Principle 2: Every good ad is an emotional out-

pouring of words, feelings and impressions.

Emotion Principle 3: You sell on emotion, but you justify

a purchase with logic.

signing a mail order ad. (Chapter 4)

Reading a number of books on a variety of subjects prepares you
to become a good direct marketer and helps you avoid many of
the  mistakes  others  have  made.  That’s  one  of  the  beneﬁts  you
have realized from reading this handbook. Many other people in
the direct marketing industry have also written books that might
be helpful to you. By reading other perspectives on advertising
and copywriting, you can further your education and avoid costly
errors that many before you have made. I wish I had read many
of them earlier in my career.

About the Author

Joseph  Sugarman is  recognized  as  one  of  the  most  effective
and  proliﬁc  advertising  copywriters  in  America.  As  CEO  of
JS&A Group,  Inc.,  he  introduced  hundreds  of  space-age  elec-
tronics products in the 1970s and 1980s, setting the standard for
other copywriters and marketers.

He was born and raised in the Chicago area and attended
the  electrical  engineering  college  of  the  University  of  Miami
for  three  and  a  half  years  before  being  drafted  into  the  U.S.
Army in 1962.

He then spent over three years in Germany where he served
with the Army Intelligence Service and later with the CIA. Re-
turning home, he formed a company to market Austrian ski lifts
in  the  United  States  and  then  later  formed  his  own  advertising
agency to service ski resort accounts.

In  1971,  after  six  years  of  running  his  own  ad  agency,  he
saw  microelectronics  as  an  exciting  opportunity  and  formed  a
company  to  market  the  world’s  ﬁrst  pocket  calculator  through
direct marketing—all from the basement of his home in North-
brook, Illinois.

His  company,  JS&A Group,  Inc.,  soon  grew  to  become
America’s  largest  single  source  of  space-age  products,  and  he
eventually  introduced  dozens  of  new  innovations  and  concepts
in electronics during the 1970s and 1980s, including the pocket
calculator, the digital watch, cordless telephones, computers and
a  variety  of  other  electronic  items.  Each  product  introduction
was made in large, full-page advertisements, which became the
recognized signature of his creative work.

In  1973,  Sugarman’s  company  was  the  ﬁrst  in  the  United
States to use the 800 WATS line service to take credit card orders
over the telephone—something that direct marketers had never
done before.
