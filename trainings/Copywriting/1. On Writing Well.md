INTRODUCTION

One  of  the  pictures  hanging  in  my  office  in  mid-Manhattan  is  a  photograph  of
the  writer  E.  B.  White.  It  was  taken  by  Jill  Krementz  when  White  was  77  years
old,  at  his  home  in  North  Brooklin,  Maine.  A  white-haired  man  is  sitting  on  a
plain wooden bench at a plain wooden table—three boards nailed to four legs—
in a small boathouse. The window is open to a view across the water. White is
typing on a manual typewriter, and the only other objects are an ashtray and a
nail keg. The keg, I don’t have to be told, is his wastebasket.

Many  people  from  many  corners  of  my  life—writers  and  aspiring  writers,
students  and  former  students—have  seen  that  picture.  They  come  to  talk
through a writing problem or to catch me up on their lives. But usually it doesn’t
take more than a few minutes for their eye to be drawn to the old man sitting at
the typewriter. What gets their attention is the simplicity of the process. White
has everything he needs: a writing implement, a piece of paper, and a receptacle
for all the sentences that didn’t come out the way he wanted them to.

Since  then  writing  has  gone  electronic.  Computers  have  replaced  the
typewriter, the delete key has replaced the wastebasket, and various other keys
insert, move and rearrange whole chunks of text. But nothing has replaced the
writer.  He  or  she  is  still  stuck  with  the  same  old  job  of  saying  something  that
other people will want to read. That’s the point of the photograph, and it’s still
the point—30 years later—of this book.

I  first  wrote  On  Writing  Well  in  an  outbuilding  in  Connecticut  that  was  as
small and as crude as White’s boathouse. My tools were a dangling lightbulb, an
Underwood  standard  typewriter,  a  ream  of  yellow  copy  paper  and  a  wire
wastebasket. I had then been teaching my nonfiction writing course at Yale for
five years, and I wanted to use the summer of 1975 to try to put the course into
a book.

E.  B.  White,  as  it  happened,  was  very  much  on  my  mind.  I  had  long
considered  him  my  model  as  a  writer.  His  was  the  seemingly  effortless  style—
achieved,  I  knew,  with  great  effort—that  I  wanted  to  emulate,  and  whenever  I
began a new project I would first read some White to get his cadences into my
ear. But now I also had a pedagogical interest: White was the reigning champ of
the arena I was trying to enter. The Elements of Style, his updating of the book
that had most influenced him, written in 1919 by his English professor at Cornell,
William  Strunk  Jr.,  was  the  dominant  how-to  manual  for  writers.  Tough

competition.

Instead of competing with the Strunk & White book I decided to complement
it. The Elements of Style was a book of pointers and admonitions: do this, don’t
do that. What it didn’t address was how to apply those principles to the various
forms that nonfiction writing and journalism can take. That’s what I taught in my
course, and it’s what I would teach in my book: how to write about people and
places,  science  and  technology,  history  and  medicine,  business  and  education,
sports and the arts and everything else under the sun that’s waiting to be written
about.

So On Writing Well was born, in 1976, and it’s now in its third generation of
readers,  its  sales  well  over  a  million.  Today  I  often  meet  young  newspaper
reporters who were given the book by the editor who hired them, just as those
editors were first given the book by the editor who hired them. I also often meet
gray-haired matrons who remember being assigned the book in college and not
finding it the horrible medicine they expected. Sometimes they bring that early
edition for me to sign, its sentences highlighted in yellow. They apologize for the
mess. I love the mess.

As America has steadily changed in 30 years, so has the book. I’ve revised it
six times to keep pace with new social trends (more interest in memoir, business,
science  and  sports),  new  literary  trends  (more  women  writing  nonfiction),  new
demographic  patterns  (more  writers  from  other  cultural  traditions),  new
technologies (the computer) and new words and usages. I’ve also incorporated
lessons I learned by continuing to wrestle with the craft myself, writing books on
subjects  I  hadn’t  tried  before:  baseball  and  music  and  American  history.  My
purpose is to make myself and my experience available. If readers connect with
my book it’s because they don’t think they’re hearing from an English professor.
They’re hearing from a working writer.

My  concerns  as  a  teacher  have  also  shifted.  I’m  more  interested  in  the
intention,
intangibles  that  produce  good  writing—confidence,  enjoyment,
integrity—and  I’ve  written  new  chapters  on  those  values.  Since  the  1990s  I’ve
also taught an adult course on memoir and family history at the New School. My
students are men and women who want to use writing to try to understand who
they are and what heritage they were born into. Year after year their stories take
me deeply into their lives and into their yearning to leave a record of what they
have done and thought and felt. Half the people in America, it seems, are writing
a memoir.

The bad news is that most of them are paralyzed by the size of the task. How
can they even begin to impose a coherent shape on the past—that vast sprawl of
half-remembered people and events and emotions? Many are near despair. To
offer some help and comfort I wrote a book in 2004 called Writing About Your
Life. It’s a memoir of various events in my own life, but it’s also a teaching book:
along the way I explain the writing decisions I made. They are the same decisions
that confront every writer going in search of his or her past: matters of selection,

reduction,  organization  and  tone.  Now,  for  this  seventh  edition,  I’ve  put  the
lessons I learned into a new chapter called “Writing Family History and Memoir.”
When I first wrote On Writing Well, the readers I had in mind were a small
segment of the population: students, writers, editors, teachers and people who
wanted  to  learn  how  to  write.  I  had  no  inkling  of  the  electronic  marvels  that
would  soon  revolutionize  the  act  of  writing.  First  came  the  word  processor,  in
the 1980s, which made the computer an everyday tool for people who had never
thought  of  themselves  as  writers.  Then  came  the  Internet  and  e-mail,  in  the
1990s, which continued the revolution. Today everybody in the world is writing
to everybody else, making instant contact across every border and across every
time zone. Bloggers are saturating the globe.

On one level the new torrent is good news. Any invention that reduces the
fear of writing is up there with air-conditioning and the lightbulb. But, as always,
there’s  a  catch.  Nobody  told  all  the  new  computer  writers  that  the  essence  of
writing  is  rewriting.  Just  because  they’re  writing  fluently  doesn’t  mean  they’re
writing well.

That condition was first revealed with the arrival of the word processor. Two
opposite  things  happened:  good  writers  got  better  and  bad  writers  got  worse.
Good  writers  welcomed  the  gift  of  being  able  to  fuss  endlessly  with  their
sentences—pruning  and  revising  and  reshaping—without  the  drudgery  of
retyping. Bad writers became even more verbose because writing was suddenly
so  easy  and  their  sentences  looked  so  pretty  on  the  screen.  How  could  such
beautiful sentences not be perfect?

E-mail is an impromptu medium, not conducive to slowing down or looking
back.  It’s  ideal  for  the  never-ending  upkeep  of  daily  life.  If  the  writing  is
disorderly,  no  real  harm  is  done.  But  e-mail  is  also  where  much  of  the  world’s
business  is  now  conducted.  Millions  of  e-mail  messages  every  day  give  people
the information they need to do their job, and a badly written message can do a
lot of damage. So can a badly written Web site. The new age, for all its electronic
wizardry, is still writing-based.

On  Writing  Well  is  a  craft  book,  and  its  principles  haven’t  changed  since  it
was written 30 years ago. I don’t know what still newer marvels will make writing
twice as easy in the next 30 years. But I do know they won’t make writing twice
as  good.  That  will  still  require  plain  old  hard  thinking—what  E.  B.  White  was
doing in his boathouse—and the plain old tools of the English language.

Principles

1

The Transaction

A school in Connecticut once held “a day devoted to the arts,” and I was asked if
I would come and talk about writing as a vocation. When I arrived I found that a
second speaker had been invited—Dr. Brock (as I’ll call him), a surgeon who had
recently begun to write and had sold some stories to magazines. He was going to
talk  about  writing  as  an  avocation.  That  made  us  a  panel,  and  we  sat  down  to
face a crowd of students and teachers and parents, all eager to learn the secrets
of our glamorous work.

Dr.  Brock  was  dressed  in  a  bright  red  jacket,  looking  vaguely  bohemian,  as
authors  are  supposed  to  look,  and  the  first  question  went  to  him.  What  was  it
like to be a writer?

He  said  it  was  tremendous  fun.  Coming  home  from  an  arduous  day  at  the
hospital, he would go straight to his yellow pad and write his tensions away. The
words  just  flowed.  It  was  easy.  I  then  said  that  writing  wasn’t  easy  and  wasn’t
fun. It was hard and lonely, and the words seldom just flowed.

Next  Dr.  Brock  was  asked  if  it  was  important  to  rewrite.  Absolutely  not,  he
said. “Let it all hang out,” he told us, and whatever form the sentences take will
reflect the writer at his most natural. I then said that rewriting is the essence of
writing. I pointed out that professional writers rewrite their sentences over and
over and then rewrite what they have rewritten.

“What do you do on days when it isn’t going well?” Dr. Brock was asked. He
said he just stopped writing and put the work aside for a day when it would go
better.  I  then  said  that  the  professional  writer  must  establish  a  daily  schedule
and stick to it. I said that writing is a craft, not an art, and that the man who runs
away  from  his  craft  because  he  lacks  inspiration  is  fooling  himself.  He  is  also
going broke.

“What if you’re feeling depressed or unhappy?” a student asked. “Won’t that

affect your writing?”

Probably it will, Dr. Brock replied. Go fishing. Take a walk. Probably it won’t, I

said. If your job is to write every day, you learn to do it like any other job.

A  student  asked  if  we  found  it  useful  to  circulate  in  the  literary  world.  Dr.
Brock said he was greatly enjoying his new life as a man of letters, and he told

several  stories  of  being  taken  to  lunch  by  his  publisher  and  his  agent  at
Manhattan restaurants where writers and editors gather. I said that professional
writers are solitary drudges who seldom see other writers.

“Do you put symbolism in your writing?” a student asked me.
“Not  if  I  can  help  it,”  I  replied.  I  have  an  unbroken  record  of  missing  the
deeper meaning in any story, play or movie, and as for dance and mime, I have
never had any idea of what is being conveyed.

“I love symbols!” Dr. Brock exclaimed, and he described with gusto the joys

of weaving them through his work.

So the morning went, and it was a revelation to all of us. At the end Dr. Brock
told me he was enormously interested in my answers—it had never occurred to
him that writing could be hard. I told him I was just as interested in his answers—
it had never occurred to me that writing could be easy. Maybe I should take up
surgery on the side.

As for the students, anyone might think we left them bewildered. But in fact
we gave them a broader glimpse of the writing process than if only one of us had
talked.  For  there  isn’t  any  “right”  way  to  do  such  personal  work.  There  are  all
kinds of writers and all kinds of methods, and any method that helps you to say
what  you  want  to  say  is  the  right  method  for  you.  Some  people  write  by  day,
others by night. Some people need silence, others turn on the radio. Some write
by hand, some by computer, some by talking into a tape recorder. Some people
write  their  first  draft  in  one  long  burst  and  then  revise;  others  can’t  write  the
second paragraph until they have fiddled endlessly with the first.

But all of them are vulnerable and all of them are tense. They are driven by a
compulsion  to  put  some  part  of  themselves  on  paper,  and  yet  they  don’t  just
write  what  comes  naturally.  They  sit  down  to  commit  an  act  of  literature,  and
the  self  who  emerges  on  paper  is  far  stiffer  than  the  person  who  sat  down  to
write. The problem is to find the real man or woman behind the tension.

Ultimately  the  product  that  any  writer  has  to  sell  is  not  the  subject  being
written  about,  but  who  he  or  she  is.  I  often  find  myself  reading  with  interest
about a topic I never thought would interest me—some scientific quest, perhaps.
What holds me is the enthusiasm of the writer for his field. How was he drawn
into it? What emotional baggage did he bring along? How did it change his life?
It’s  not  necessary  to  want  to  spend  a  year  alone  at  Walden  Pond  to  become
involved with a writer who did.

This is the personal transaction that’s at the heart of good nonfiction writing.
Out  of  it  come  two  of  the  most  important  qualities  that  this  book  will  go  in
search of: humanity and warmth. Good writing has an aliveness that keeps the
reader  reading  from  one  paragraph  to  the  next,  and  it’s  not  a  question  of
gimmicks  to  “personalize”  the  author.  It’s  a  question  of  using  the  English
language in a way that will achieve the greatest clarity and strength.

Can such principles be taught? Maybe not. But most of them can be learned.

Simplicity

Clutter  is  the  disease  of  American  writing.  We  are  a  society  strangling  in
unnecessary  words,  circular  constructions,  pompous  frills  and  meaningless
jargon.

Who can understand the clotted language of everyday American commerce:
the memo, the corporation report, the business letter, the notice from the bank
explaining  its  latest  “simplified”  statement?  What  member  of  an  insurance  or
medical plan can decipher the brochure explaining his costs and benefits? What
father or mother can put together a child’s toy from the instructions on the box?
Our national tendency is to inflate and thereby sound important. The airline pilot
who  announces  that  he  is  presently  anticipating  experiencing  considerable
precipitation wouldn’t think of saying it may rain. The sentence is too simple—
there must be something wrong with it.

But  the  secret  of  good  writing  is  to  strip  every  sentence  to  its  cleanest
components. Every word that serves no function, every long word that could be
a short word, every adverb that carries the same meaning that’s already in the
verb,  every  passive  construction  that  leaves  the  reader  unsure  of  who  is  doing
what—these are the thousand and one adulterants that weaken the strength of
a sentence. And they usually occur in proportion to education and rank.

During the 1960s the president of my university wrote a letter to mollify the
alumni after a spell of campus unrest. “You are probably aware,” he began, “that
we  have  been  experiencing  very  considerable  potentially  explosive  expressions
of  dissatisfaction  on  issues  only  partially  related.”  He  meant  that  the  students
had  been  hassling  them  about  different  things.  I  was  far  more  upset  by  the
president’s  English  than  by  the  students’  potentially  explosive  expressions  of
dissatisfaction.  I  would  have  preferred  the  presidential  approach  taken  by
Franklin  D.  Roosevelt  when  he  tried  to  convert
into  English  his  own
government’s memos, such as this blackout order of 1942:

Such  preparations  shall  be  made  as  will  completely  obscure  all  Federal
buildings  and  non-Federal  buildings  occupied  by  the  Federal  government
during an air raid for any period of time from visibility by reason of internal

or external illumination.

“Tell them,” Roosevelt said, “that in buildings where they have to keep the

work going to put something across the windows.”

Simplify,  simplify.  Thoreau  said  it,  as  we  are  so  often  reminded,  and  no
American writer more consistently practiced what he preached. Open Walden to
any page and you will find a man saying in a plain and orderly way what is on his
mind:

I  went  to  the  woods  because  I  wished  to  live  deliberately,  to  front  only
the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and
not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.

How  can  the  rest  of  us  achieve  such  enviable  freedom  from  clutter?  The
answer is to clear our heads of clutter. Clear thinking becomes clear writing; one
can’t exist without the other. It’s impossible for a muddy thinker to write good
English. He may get away with it for a paragraph or two, but soon the reader will
be lost, and there’s no sin so grave, for the reader will not easily be lured back.

Who  is  this  elusive  creature,  the  reader?  The  reader  is  someone  with  an
attention  span  of  about  30  seconds—a  person  assailed  by  many  forces
competing  for  attention.  At  one  time  those  forces  were  relatively  few:
newspapers, magazines, radio, spouse, children, pets. Today they also include a
galaxy  of  electronic  devices  for  receiving  entertainment  and  information—
television,  VCRs,  DVDs,  CDs,  video  games,  the  Internet,  e-mail,  cell  phones,
BlackBerries, iPods—as well as a fitness program, a pool, a lawn and that most
potent  of  competitors,  sleep.  The  man  or  woman  snoozing  in  a  chair  with  a
magazine  or  a  book  is  a  person  who  was  being  given  too  much  unnecessary
trouble by the writer.

It won’t do to say that the reader is too dumb or too lazy to keep pace with
the  train  of  thought.  If  the  reader  is  lost,  it’s  usually  because  the  writer  hasn’t
been careful enough. That carelessness can take any number of forms. Perhaps a
sentence  is  so  excessively  cluttered  that  the  reader,  hacking  through  the
verbiage,  simply  doesn’t  know  what  it  means.  Perhaps  a  sentence  has  been  so
shoddily constructed that the reader could read it in several ways. Perhaps the
writer  has  switched  pronouns  in  midsentence,  or  has  switched  tenses,  so  the
reader  loses  track  of  who  is  talking  or  when  the  action  took  place.  Perhaps
Sentence B is not a logical sequel to Sentence A; the writer, in whose head the
connection  is  clear,  hasn’t  bothered  to  provide  the  missing  link.  Perhaps  the
writer has used a word incorrectly by not taking the trouble to look it up.

Faced  with  such  obstacles,  readers  are  at  first  tenacious.  They  blame
themselves—they  obviously  missed  something,  and  they  go  back  over  the
mystifying sentence, or over the whole paragraph, piecing it out like an ancient
rune, making guesses and moving on. But they won’t do that for long. The writer

is  making  them  work  too  hard,  and  they  will  look  for  one  who  is  better  at  the
craft.

Writers must therefore constantly ask: what am I trying to say? Surprisingly
often they don’t know. Then they must look at what they have written and ask:
have I said it? Is it clear to someone encountering the subject for the first time?
If it’s not, some fuzz has worked its way into the machinery. The clear writer is
someone clearheaded enough to see this stuff for what it is: fuzz.

I  don’t  mean  that  some  people  are  born  clearheaded  and  are  therefore
natural  writers,  whereas  others  are  naturally  fuzzy  and  will  never  write  well.
Thinking  clearly  is  a  conscious  act  that  writers  must  force  on  themselves,  as  if
they were working on any other project that requires logic: making a shopping
list  or  doing  an  algebra  problem.  Good  writing  doesn’t  come  naturally,  though
most people seem to think it does. Professional writers are constantly bearded
by people who say they’d like to “try a little writing sometime”—meaning when
they retire from their real profession, like insurance or real estate, which is hard.
Or they say, “I could write a book about that.” I doubt it.

Writing  is  hard  work.  A  clear  sentence  is  no  accident.  Very  few  sentences
come out right the first time, or even the third time. Remember this in moments
of despair. If you find that writing is hard, it’s because it is hard.

Two  pages  of  the  final  manuscript  of  this  chapter  from  the  First  Edition  of  On  Writing  Well.  Although  they
look  like  a  first  draft,  they  had  already  been  rewritten  and  retyped—like  almost  every  other  page—four  or
five times. With each rewrite I try to make what I have written tighter, stronger and more precise, eliminating
every  element  that’s  not  doing  useful  work.  Then  I  go  over  it  once  more,  reading  it  aloud,  and  am  always
amazed at how much clutter can still be cut. (In later editions I eliminated the sexist pronoun “he” denoting
“the writer” and “the reader.”)

3

Clutter

Fighting clutter is like fighting weeds—the writer is always slightly behind. New
varieties  sprout  overnight,  and  by  noon  they  are  part  of  American  speech.
Consider what President Nixon’s aide John Dean accomplished in just one day of
testimony on television during the Watergate hearings. The next day everyone in
America was saying “at this point in time” instead of “now.”

Consider all the prepositions that are draped onto verbs that don’t need any
help.  We  no  longer  head  committees.  We  head  them  up.  We  don’t  face
problems anymore. We face up to them when we can free up a few minutes. A
small  detail,  you  may  say—not  worth  bothering  about.  It  is  worth  bothering
about. Writing improves in direct ratio to the number of things we can keep out
of it that shouldn’t be there. “Up” in “free up” shouldn’t be there. Examine every
word  you  put  on  paper.  You’ll  find  a  surprising  number  that  don’t  serve  any
purpose.

Take the adjective “personal,” as in “a personal friend of mine,” “his personal
feeling” or “her personal physician.” It’s typical of hundreds of words that can be
eliminated. The personal friend has come into the language to distinguish him or
her  from  the  business  friend,  thereby  debasing  both  language  and  friendship.
Someone’s feeling is that person’s personal feeling—that’s what “his” means. As
for the personal physician, that’s the man or woman summoned to the dressing
room  of  a  stricken  actress  so  she  won’t  have  to  be  treated  by  the  impersonal
physician assigned to the theater. Someday I’d like to see that person identified
as “her doctor.” Physicians are physicians, friends are friends. The rest is clutter.
Clutter  is  the  laborious  phrase  that  has  pushed  out  the  short  word  that
means  the  same  thing.  Even  before  John  Dean,  people  and  businesses  had
stopped  saying  “now.”  They  were  saying  “currently”  (“all  our  operators  are
currently  assisting  other  customers”),  or  “at  the  present  time,”  or  “presently”
(which means “soon”). Yet the idea can always be expressed by “now” to mean
the  immediate  moment  (“Now  I  can  see  him”),  or  by  “today”  to  mean  the
historical present (“Today prices are high”), or simply by the verb “to be” (“It is
raining”).  There’s  no  need  to  say,  “At  the  present  time  we  are  experiencing
precipitation.”

“Experiencing” is one of the worst clutterers. Even your dentist will ask if you
are experiencing any pain. If he had his own kid in the chair he would say, “Does
it hurt?” He would, in short, be himself. By using a more pompous phrase in his
professional role he not only sounds more important; he blunts the painful edge
of truth. It’s the language of the flight attendant demonstrating the oxygen mask
that will drop down if the plane should run out of air. “In the unlikely possibility
that the aircraft should experience such an eventuality,” she begins—a phrase so
oxygen-depriving in itself that we are prepared for any disaster.

Clutter  is  the  ponderous  euphemism  that  turns  a  slum  into  a  depressed
socioeconomic  area,  garbage  collectors  into  waste-disposal  personnel  and  the
town  dump  into  the  volume  reduction  unit.  I  think  of  Bill  Mauldin’s  cartoon  of
two hoboes riding a freight car. One of them says, “I started as a simple bum, but
now I’m hard-core unemployed.” Clutter is political correctness gone amok. I saw
an  ad  for  a  boys’  camp  designed  to  provide  “individual  attention  for  the
minimally exceptional.”

Clutter  is  the  official  language  used  by  corporations  to  hide  their  mistakes.
When  the  Digital  Equipment  Corporation  eliminated  3,000  jobs  its  statement
didn’t  mention  layoffs;  those  were  “involuntary  methodologies.”  When  an  Air
Force missile crashed, it “impacted with the ground prematurely.” When General
Motors had a plant shutdown, that was a “volume-related production-schedule
adjustment.” Companies that go belly-up have “a negative cash-flow position.”

Clutter  is  the  language  of  the  Pentagon  calling  an  invasion  a  “reinforced
protective  reaction  strike”  and  justifying  its  vast  budgets  on  the  need  for
“counterforce  deterrence.”  As  George  Orwell  pointed  out  in  “Politics  and  the
English  Language,”  an  essay  written  in  1946  but  often  cited  during  the  wars  in
Cambodia,  Vietnam  and  Iraq,  “political  speech  and  writing  are  largely  the
defense  of  the  indefensible....  Thus  political  language  has  to  consist  largely  of
euphemism,  question-begging  and  sheer  cloudy  vagueness.”  Orwell’s  warning
that clutter is not just a nuisance but a deadly tool has come true in the recent
decades  of  American  military  adventurism.  It  was  during  George  W.  Bush’s
presidency that “civilian casualties” in Iraq became “collateral damage.”

Verbal  camouflage  reached  new  heights  during  General  Alexander  Haig’s
tenure as President Reagan’s secretary of state. Before Haig nobody had thought
of saying “at this juncture of maturization” to mean “now.” He told the American
people that terrorism could be fought with “meaningful sanctionary teeth” and
that intermediate nuclear missiles were “at the vortex of cruciality.” As for any
worries  that  the  public  might  harbor,  his  message  was  “leave  it  to  Al,”  though
what  he  actually  said  was:  “We  must  push  this  to  a  lower  decibel  of  public
fixation. I don’t think there’s much of a learning curve to be achieved in this area
of content.”

I could go on quoting examples from various fields—every profession has its
growing arsenal of jargon to throw dust in the eyes of the populace. But the list
would be tedious. The point of raising it now is to serve notice that clutter is the

enemy.  Beware,  then,  of  the  long  word  that’s  no  better  than  the  short  word:
“assistance” (help), “numerous” (many), “facilitate” (ease), “individual” (man or
woman),  “remainder”  (rest),  “initial”  (first),  “implement”  (do),  “sufficient”
(enough), “attempt” (try), “referred to as” (called) and hundreds more. Beware
of  all  the  slippery  new  fad  words:  paradigm  and  parameter,  prioritize  and
potentialize. They are all weeds that will smother what you write. Don’t dialogue
with someone you can talk to. Don’t interface with anybody.

Just  as  insidious  are  all  the  word  clusters  with  which  we  explain  how  we
propose to go about our explaining: “I might add,” “It should be pointed out,” “It
is interesting to note.” If you might add, add it. If it should be pointed out, point
it out. If it is interesting to note, make it interesting; are we not all stupefied by
what  follows  when  someone  says,  “This  will  interest  you”?  Don’t  inflate  what
needs  no  inflating:  “with  the  possible  exception  of”  (except),  “due  to  the  fact
that” (because), “he totally lacked the ability to” (he couldn’t), “until such time
as” (until), “for the purpose of” (for).

Is there any way to recognize clutter at a glance? Here’s a device my students
at Yale found helpful. I would put brackets around every component in a piece of
writing  that  wasn’t  doing  useful  work.  Often  just  one  word  got  bracketed:  the
unnecessary  preposition  appended  to  a  verb  (“order  up”),  or  the  adverb  that
carries  the  same  meaning  as  the  verb  (“smile  happily”),  or  the  adjective  that
states a known fact (“tall skyscraper”). Often my brackets surrounded the little
qualifiers that weaken any sentence they inhabit (“a bit,” “sort of”), or phrases
like  “in  a  sense,”  which  don’t  mean  anything.  Sometimes  my  brackets
surrounded  an  entire  sentence—the  one  that  essentially  repeats  what  the
previous  sentence  said,  or  that  says  something  readers  don’t  need  to  know  or
can figure out for themselves. Most first drafts can be cut by 50 percent without
losing any information or losing the author’s voice.

My  reason  for  bracketing  the  students’  superfluous  words,  instead  of
crossing  them  out,  was  to  avoid  violating  their  sacred  prose.  I  wanted  to  leave
the  sentence  intact  for  them  to  analyze.  I  was  saying,  “I  may  be  wrong,  but  I
think  this  can  be  deleted  and  the  meaning  won’t  be  affected.  But  you  decide.
Read  the  sentence  without  the  bracketed  material  and  see  if  it  works.”  In  the
early weeks of the term I handed back papers that were festooned with brackets.
Entire paragraphs were bracketed. But soon the students learned to put mental
brackets around their own clutter, and by the end of the term their papers were
almost  clean.  Today  many  of  those  students  are  professional  writers,  and  they
tell me, “I still see your brackets—they’re following me through life.”

You can develop the same eye. Look for the clutter in your writing and prune
it  ruthlessly.  Be  grateful  for  everything  you  can  throw  away.  Reexamine  each
sentence you put on paper. Is every word doing new work? Can any thought be
expressed with more economy? Is anything pompous or pretentious or faddish?
Are you hanging on to something useless just because you think it’s beautiful?

Simplify, simplify.

4

Style

So  much  for  early  warnings  about  the  bloated  monsters  that  lie  in  ambush  for
the writer trying to put together a clean English sentence.

“But,” you may say, “if I eliminate everything you think is clutter and if I strip
every  sentence  to  its  barest  bones,  will  there  be  anything  left  of  me?”  The
question is a fair one; simplicity carried to an extreme might seem to point to a
style little more sophisticated than “Dick likes Jane” and “See Spot run.”

I’ll  answer  the  question  first  on  the  level  of  carpentry.  Then  I’ll  get  to  the

larger issue of who the writer is and how to preserve his or her identity.

Few people realize how badly they write. Nobody has shown them how much
excess or murkiness has crept into their style and how it obstructs what they are
trying to say. If you give me an eight-page article and I tell you to cut it to four
pages, you’ll howl and say it can’t be done. Then you’ll go home and do it, and it
will be much better. After that comes the hard part: cutting it to three.

The point is that you have to strip your writing down before you can build it
back  up.  You  must  know  what  the  essential  tools  are  and  what  job  they  were
designed  to  do.  Extending  the  metaphor  of  carpentry,  it’s  first  necessary  to  be
able to saw wood neatly and to drive nails. Later you can bevel the edges or add
elegant  finials,  if  that’s  your  taste.  But  you  can  never  forget  that  you  are
practicing  a  craft  that’s  based  on  certain  principles.  If  the  nails  are  weak,  your
house  will  collapse.  If  your  verbs  are  weak  and  your  syntax  is  rickety,  your
sentences will fall apart.

I’ll admit that certain nonfiction writers, like Tom Wolfe and Norman Mailer,
have  built  some  remarkable  houses.  But  these  are  writers  who  spent  years
learning  their  craft,  and  when  at  last  they  raised  their  fanciful  turrets  and
hanging  gardens,  to  the  surprise  of  all  of  us  who  never  dreamed  of  such
ornamentation, they knew what they were doing. Nobody becomes Tom Wolfe
overnight, not even Tom Wolfe.

First,  then,  learn  to  hammer  the  nails,  and  if  what  you  build  is  sturdy  and

serviceable, take satisfaction in its plain strength.

But you will be impatient to find a “style”—to embellish the plain words so
that  readers  will  recognize  you  as  someone  special.  You  will  reach  for  gaudy

similes and tinseled adjectives, as if “style” were something you could buy at the
style  store  and  drape  onto  your  words  in  bright  decorator  colors.  (Decorator
colors  are  the  colors  that  decorators  come  in.)  There  is  no  style  store;  style  is
organic to the person doing the writing, as much a part of him as his hair, or, if
he is bald, his lack of it. Trying to add style is like adding a toupee. At first glance
the formerly bald man looks young and even handsome. But at second glance—
and with a toupee there’s always a second glance—he doesn’t look quite right.
The problem is not that he doesn’t look well groomed; he does, and we can only
admire the wigmaker’s skill. The point is that he doesn’t look like himself.

This is the problem of writers who set out deliberately to garnish their prose.
You lose whatever it is that makes you unique. The reader will notice if you are
putting  on  airs.  Readers  want  the  person  who  is  talking  to  them  to  sound
genuine. Therefore a fundamental rule is: be yourself.

No rule, however, is harder to follow. It requires writers to do two things that
by  their  metabolism  are  impossible.  They  must  relax,  and  they  must  have
confidence.

Telling a writer to relax is like telling a man to relax while being examined for
a hernia, and as for confidence, see how stiffly he sits, glaring at the screen that
awaits his words. See how often he gets up to look for something to eat or drink.
A  writer  will  do  anything  to  avoid  the  act  of  writing.  I  can  testify  from  my
newspaper days that the number of trips to the water cooler per reporter-hour
far exceeds the body’s need for fluids.

What can be done to put the writer out of these miseries? Unfortunately, no
cure  has  been  found.  I  can  only  offer  the  consoling  thought  that  you  are  not
alone.  Some  days  will  go  better  than  others.  Some  will  go  so  badly  that  you’ll
despair of ever writing again. We have all had many of those days and will have
many more.

Still, it would be nice to keep the bad days to a minimum, which brings me

back to the problem of trying to relax.

Assume that you are the writer sitting down to write. You think your article
must be of a certain length or it won’t seem important. You think how august it
will  look  in  print.  You  think  of  all  the  people  who  will  read  it.  You  think  that  it
must have the solid weight of authority. You think that its style must dazzle. No
wonder you tighten; you are so busy thinking of your awesome responsibility to
the  finished  article  that  you  can’t  even  start.  Yet  you  vow  to  be  worthy  of  the
task,  and,  casting  about  for  grand  phrases  that  wouldn’t  occur  to  you  if  you
weren’t trying so hard to make an impression, you plunge in.

Paragraph  1  is  a  disaster—a  tissue  of  generalities  that  seem  to  have  come
out  of  a  machine.  No  person  could  have  written  them.  Paragraph  2  isn’t  much
better.  But  Paragraph  3  begins  to  have  a  somewhat  human  quality,  and  by
Paragraph 4 you begin to sound like yourself. You’ve started to relax. It’s amazing
how  often  an  editor  can  throw  away  the  first  three  or  four  paragraphs  of  an
article,  or  even  the  first  few  pages,  and  start  with  the  paragraph  where  the

writer begins to sound like himself or herself. Not only are those first paragraphs
impersonal  and  ornate;  they  don’t  say  anything—they  are  a  self-conscious
attempt  at  a  fancy  prologue.  What  I’m  always  looking  for  as  an  editor  is  a
sentence  that  says  something  like  “I’ll  never  forget  the  day  when  I  …”  I  think,
“Aha! A person!”

Writers  are  obviously  at  their  most  natural  when  they  write  in  the  first
person.  Writing  is  an  intimate  transaction  between  two  people,  conducted  on
paper,  and  it  will  go  well  to  the  extent  that  it  retains  its  humanity.  Therefore  I
urge people to write in the first person: to use “I” and “me” and “we” and “us.”
They put up a fight.

“Who am I to say what I think?” they ask. “Or what I feel?”
“Who are you not to say what you think?” I tell them. “There’s only one you.

Nobody else thinks or feels in exactly the same way.”

“But  nobody  cares  about  my  opinions,”  they  say.  “It  would  make  me  feel

conspicuous.”

“They’ll care if you tell them something interesting,” I say, “and tell them in

words that come naturally.”

Nevertheless, getting writers to use “I” is seldom easy. They think they must
earn the right to reveal their emotions or their thoughts. Or that it’s egotistical.
Or  that  it’s  undignified—a  fear  that  afflicts  the  academic  world.  Hence  the
professorial  use  of  “one”  (“One  finds  oneself  not  wholly  in  accord  with  Dr.
Maltby’s view of the human condition”), or of the impersonal “it is” (“It is to be
hoped  that  Professor  Felt’s  monograph  will  find  the  wider  audience  it  most
assuredly  deserves”).  I  don’t  want  to  meet  “one”—he’s  a  boring  guy.  I  want  a
professor with a passion for his subject to tell me why it fascinates him.

I  realize  that  there  are  vast  regions  of  writing  where  “I”  isn’t  allowed.
Newspapers don’t want “I” in their news stories; many magazines don’t want it
in their articles; businesses and institutions don’t want it in the reports they send
so  profusely  into  the  American  home;  colleges  don’t  want  “I”  in  their  term
papers  or  dissertations,  and  English  teachers  discourage  any  first-person
pronoun  except  the  literary  “we”  (“We  see  in  Melville’s  symbolic  use  of  the
white whale …”). Many of those prohibitions are valid; newspaper articles should
consist of news, reported objectively. I also sympathize with teachers who don’t
want  to  give  students  an  easy  escape  into  opinion—“I  think  Hamlet  was
stupid”—before they have grappled with the discipline of assessing a work on its
merits and on external sources. “I” can be a self-indulgence and a cop-out.

Still,  we  have  become  a  society  fearful  of  revealing  who  we  are.  The
institutions  that  seek  our  support  by  sending  us  their  brochures  sound
remarkably  alike,  though  surely  all  of  them—hospitals,  schools,  libraries,
museums, zoos—were founded and are still sustained by men and women with
different dreams and visions. Where are these people? It’s hard to glimpse them
impersonal  passive  sentences  that  say  “initiatives  were
among  all  the
undertaken” and “priorities have been identified.”

Even when “I” isn’t permitted, it’s still possible to convey a sense of I-ness.
The  political  columnist  James  Reston  didn’t  use  “I”  in  his  columns;  yet  I  had  a
good idea of what kind of person he was, and I could say the same of many other
essayists and reporters. Good writers are visible just behind their words. If you
aren’t allowed to use “I,” at least think “I” while you write, or write the first draft
in  the  first  person  and  then  take  the  “I”s  out.  It  will  warm  up  your  impersonal
style.

Style  is  tied  to  the  psyche,  and  writing  has  deep  psychological  roots.  The
reasons why we express ourselves as we do, or fail to express ourselves because
of  “writer’s  block,”  are  partly  buried  in  the  subconscious  mind.  There  are  as
many kinds of writer’s block as there are kinds of writers, and I have no intention
of  trying  to  untangle  them.  This  is  a  short  book,  and  my  name  isn’t  Sigmund
Freud.

But I’ve also noticed a new reason for avoiding “I”: Americans are unwilling
to go out on a limb. A generation ago our leaders told us where they stood and
what  they  believed.  Today  they  perform  strenuous  verbal  feats  to  escape  that
fate. Watch them wriggle through TV interviews without committing themselves.
I  remember  President  Ford  assuring  a  group  of  visiting  businessmen  that  his
fiscal  policies  would  work.  He  said:  “We  see  nothing  but  increasingly  brighter
clouds  every  month.”  I  took  this  to  mean  that  the  clouds  were  still  fairly  dark.
Ford’s  sentence  was  just  vague  enough  to  say  nothing  and  still  sedate  his
constituents.

Later  administrations  brought  no

relief.  Defense  Secretary  Caspar
Weinberger, assessing a Polish crisis in 1984, said: “There’s continuing ground for
serious concern and the situation remains serious. The longer it remains serious,
the  more  ground  there  is  for  serious  concern.”  The  first  President  Bush,
questioned about his stand on assault rifles, said: “There are various groups that
think you can ban certain kinds of guns. I am not in that mode. I am in the mode
of being deeply concerned.”

But  my  all-time  champ  is  Elliot  Richardson,  who  held  four  major  cabinet
positions in the 1970s. It’s hard to know where to begin picking from his trove of
equivocal  statements,  but  consider  this  one:  “And  yet,  on  balance,  affirmative
action  has,  I  think,  been  a  qualified  success.”  A  13-word  sentence  with  five
hedging words. I give it first prize as the most wishy-washy sentence in modern
public  discourse,  though  a  rival  would  be  his  analysis  of  how  to  ease  boredom
among assembly-line workers: “And so, at last, I come to the one firm conviction
that  I  mentioned  at  the  beginning:  it  is  that  the  subject  is  too  new  for  final
judgments.”

That’s a firm conviction? Leaders who bob and weave like aging boxers don’t
inspire confidence—or deserve it. The same thing is true of writers. Sell yourself,
and your subject will exert its own appeal. Believe in your own identity and your
own  opinions.  Writing  is  an  act  of  ego,  and  you  might  as  well  admit  it.  Use  its
energy to keep yourself going.

5

The Audience

Soon after you confront the matter of preserving your identity, another question
will occur to you: “Who am I writing for?”

It’s  a  fundamental  question,  and  it  has  a  fundamental  answer:  You  are
writing for yourself. Don’t try to visualize the great mass audience. There is no
such audience—every reader is a different person. Don’t try to guess what sort
of  thing  editors  want  to  publish  or  what  you  think  the  country  is  in  a  mood  to
read. Editors and readers don’t know what they want to read until they read it.
Besides, they’re always looking for something new.

Don’t  worry  about  whether  the  reader  will  “get  it”  if  you  indulge  a  sudden
impulse for humor. If it amuses you in the act of writing, put it in. (It can always
be  taken  out,  but  only  you  can  put  it  in.)  You  are  writing  primarily  to  please
yourself,  and  if  you  go  about  it  with  enjoyment  you  will  also  entertain  the
readers who are worth writing for. If you lose the dullards back in the dust, you
don’t want them anyway.

This  may  seem  to  be  a  paradox.  Earlier  I  warned  that  the  reader  is  an
impatient bird, perched on the thin edge of distraction or sleep. Now I’m saying
you  must  write  for  yourself  and  not  be  gnawed  by  worry  over  whether  the
reader is tagging along.

I’m talking about two different issues. One is craft, the other is attitude. The
first  is  a  question  of  mastering  a  precise  skill.  The  second  is  a  question  of  how
you use that skill to express your personality.

In  terms  of  craft,  there’s  no  excuse  for  losing  readers  through  sloppy
workmanship.  If  they  doze  off  in  the  middle  of  your  article  because  you  have
been careless about a technical detail, the fault is yours. But on the larger issue
of  whether  the  reader  likes  you,  or  likes  what  you  are  saying  or  how  you  are
saying it, or agrees with it, or feels an affinity for your sense of humor or your
vision of life, don’t give him a moment’s worry. You are who you are, he is who
he is, and either you’ll get along or you won’t.

Perhaps this still seems like a paradox. How can you think carefully about not
losing the reader and still be carefree about his opinion? I assure you that they
are separate processes.

First,  work  hard  to  master  the  tools.  Simplify,  prune  and  strive  for  order.
Think of this as a mechanical act, and soon your sentences will become cleaner.
The act will never become as mechanical as, say, shaving or shampooing; you will
always have to think about the various ways in which the tools can be used. But
at least your sentences will be grounded in solid principles, and your chances of
losing the reader will be smaller.

Think of the other as a creative act: the expressing of who you are. Relax and
say what you want to say. And since style is who you are, you only need to be
true to yourself to find it gradually emerging from under the accumulated clutter
and debris, growing more distinctive every day. Perhaps the style won’t solidify
for  years  as  your  style,  your  voice.  Just  as  it  takes  time  to  find  yourself  as  a
person,  it  takes  time  to  find  yourself  as  a  stylist,  and  even  then  your  style  will
change as you grow older.

But whatever your age, be yourself when you write. Many old men still write
with the zest they had in their twenties or thirties; obviously their ideas are still
young. Other old writers ramble and repeat themselves; their style is the tip-off
that  they  have  turned  into  garrulous  bores.  Many  college  students  write  as  if
they were desiccated alumni 30 years out. Never say anything in writing that you
wouldn’t  comfortably  say  in  conversation.  If  you’re  not  a  person  who  says
“indeed”  or  “moreover,”  or  who  calls  someone  an  individual  (“he’s  a  fine
individual”), please don’t write it.

Let’s look at a few writers to see the pleasure with which they put on paper
their passions and their crotchets, not caring whether the reader shares them or
not. The first excerpt is from “The Hen (An Appreciation),” written by E. B. White
in 1944, at the height of World War II:

Chickens  do  not  always  enjoy  an  honorable  position  among  city-bred
people, although the egg, I notice, goes on and on. Right now the hen is in
favor. The war has deified her and she is the darling of the home front, feted
at  conference  tables,  praised  in  every  smoking  car,  her  girlish  ways  and
curious  habits  the  topic  of  many  an  excited  husbandryman  to  whom
yesterday she was a stranger without honor or allure.

My own attachment to the hen dates from 1907, and I have been faithful
to her in good times and bad. Ours has not always been an easy relationship
to maintain. At first, as a boy in a carefully zoned suburb, I had neighbors and
police  to  reckon  with;  my  chickens  had  to  be  as  closely  guarded  as  an
underground newspaper. Later, as a man in the country, I had my old friends
in  town  to  reckon  with,  most  of  whom  regarded  the  hen  as  a  comic  prop
straight  out  of  vaudeville....  Their  scorn  only  increased  my  devotion  to  the
hen. I remained loyal, as a man would to a bride whom his family received
with  open  ridicule.  Now  it  is  my  turn  to  wear  the  smile,  as  I  listen  to  the
enthusiastic  cackling  of  urbanites,  who  have  suddenly  taken  up  the  hen
socially and who fill the air with their newfound ecstasy and knowledge and

the  relative  charms  of  the  New  Hampshire  Red  and  the  Laced  Wyandotte.
You would think, from their nervous cries of wonder and praise, that the hen
was hatched yesterday in the suburbs of New York, instead of in the remote
past in the jungles of India.

To  a  man  who  keeps  hens,  all  poultry  lore  is  exciting  and  endlessly
fascinating.  Every  spring  I  settle  down  with  my  farm  journal  and  read,  with
the same glazed expression on my face, the age-old story of how to prepare a
brooder house....

There’s a man writing about a subject I have absolutely no interest in. Yet I
enjoy  this  piece  thoroughly.  I  like  the  simple  beauty  of  its  style.  I  like  the
rhythms,  the  unexpected  but  refreshing  words  (“deified,”  “allure,”  “cackling”),
the specific details like the Laced Wyandotte and the brooder house. But mainly
what I like is that this is a man telling me unabashedly about a love affair with
poultry that goes back to 1907. It’s written with humanity and warmth, and after
three paragraphs I know quite a lot about what sort of man this hen-lover is.

Or  take  a  writer  who  is  almost  White’s  opposite  in  terms  of  style,  who
relishes the opulent word for its opulence and doesn’t deify the simple sentence.
Yet they are brothers in holding firm opinions and saying what they think. This is
H.  L.  Mencken  reporting  on  the  notorious  “Monkey  Trial”—the  trial  of  John
Scopes,  a  young  teacher  who  taught  the  theory  of  evolution  in  his  Tennessee
classroom—in the summer of 1925:

legs;  their  pupils,  moving

It was hot weather when they tried the infidel Scopes at Dayton, Tenn.,
but  I  went  down  there  very  willingly,  for  I  was  eager  to  see  something  of
evangelical Christianity as a going concern. In the big cities of the Republic,
despite  the  endless  efforts  of  consecrated  men,  it  is  laid  up  with  a  wasting
disease.  The  very  Sunday-school  superintendents,  taking  jazz  from  the
into
stealthy  radio,  shake  their  fire-proof
adolescence, no longer respond to the proliferating hormones by enlisting for
missionary service in Africa, but resort to necking instead. Even in Dayton, I
found, though the mob was up to do execution on Scopes, there was a strong
smell of antinomianism. The nine churches of the village were all half empty
on Sunday, and weeds choked their yards. Only two or three of the resident
pastors managed to sustain themselves by their ghostly science; the rest had
to take orders for mail-order pantaloons or work in the adjacent strawberry
fields;  one,  I  heard,  was  a  barber....  Exactly  twelve  minutes  after  I  reached
the  village  I  was  taken  in  tow  by  a  Christian  man  and  introduced  to  the
favorite tipple of the Cumberland Range; half corn liquor and half Coca-Cola.
It seemed a dreadful dose to me, but I found that the Dayton illuminati got it
down with gusto, rubbing their tummies and rolling their eyes. They were all
hot for Genesis, but their faces were too florid to belong to teetotalers, and
when a pretty girl came tripping down the main street, they reached for the

places where their neckties should have been with all the amorous enterprise
of movie stars....

This is pure Mencken in its surging momentum and its irreverence. At almost
any page where you open his books he is saying something sure to outrage the
professed  pieties  of  his  countrymen.  The  sanctity  in  which  Americans  bathed
their heroes, their churches and their edifying laws—especially Prohibition—was
a well of hypocrisy for him that never dried up. Some of his heaviest ammunition
he  hurled  at  politicians  and  Presidents—his  portrait  of  “The  Archangel
Woodrow”  still  scorches  the  pages—and  as  for  Christian  believers  and  clerical
folk, they turn up unfailingly as mountebanks and boobs.

It may seem a miracle that Mencken could get away with such heresies in the
1920s, when hero worship was an American religion and the self-righteous wrath
of the Bible Belt oozed from coast to coast. Not only did he get away with it; he
was the most revered and influential journalist of his generation. The impact he
made  on  subsequent  writers  of  nonfiction  is  beyond  measuring,  and  even  now
his topical pieces seem as fresh as if they were written yesterday.

The  secret  of  his  popularity—aside  from  his  pyrotechnical  use  of  the
American language—was that he was writing for himself and didn’t give a damn
what the reader might think. It wasn’t necessary to share his prejudices to enjoy
seeing them expressed with such mirthful abandon. Mencken was never timid or
evasive; he didn’t kowtow to the reader or curry anyone’s favor. It takes courage
to  be  such  a  writer,  but  it  is  out  of  such  courage  that  revered  and  influential
journalists are born.

Moving forward to our own time, here’s an excerpt from How to Survive in
Your  Native  Land,  a  book  by  James  Herndon  describing  his  experiences  as  a
teacher in a California junior high school. Of all the earnest books on education
that  have  sprouted  in  America,  Herndon’s  is—for  me—the  one  that  best
captures  how  it  really  is  in  the  classroom.  His  style  is  not  quite  like  anybody
else’s, but his voice is true. Here’s how the book starts:

I might as well begin with Piston. Piston was, as a matter of description, a
red-headed medium-sized chubby eighth-grader; his definitive characteristic
was,  however,  stubbornness.  Without  going  into  a  lot  of  detail,  it  became
clear  right  away  that  what  Piston  didn’t  want  to  do,  Piston  didn’t  do;  what
Piston wanted to do, Piston did.

It really wasn’t much of a problem. Piston wanted mainly to paint, draw
monsters, scratch designs on mimeograph blanks and print them up, write an
occasional horror story—some kids referred to him as The Ghoul—and when
he  didn’t  want  to  do  any  of  those,  he  wanted  to  roam  the  halls  and  on
occasion (we heard) investigate the girls’ bathrooms.

We had minor confrontations. Once I wanted everyone to sit down and
listen to what I had to say—something about the way they had been acting in

the  halls.  I  was  letting  them  come  and  go  freely  and  it  was  up  to  them  (I
planned  to  point  out)  not  to  raise  hell  so  that  I  had  to  hear  about  it  from
other teachers. Sitting down was the issue—I was determined everyone was
going  to  do  it  first,  then  I’d  talk.  Piston  remained  standing.  I  reordered.  He
paid  no  attention.  I  pointed  out  that  I  was  talking  to  him.  He  indicated  he
heard  me.  I  inquired  then  why  in  hell  didn’t  he  sit  down.  He  said  he  didn’t
want to. I said I did want him to. He said that didn’t matter to him. I said do it
anyway.  He  said  why?  I  said  because  I  said  so.  He  said  he  wouldn’t.  I  said
Look I want you to sit down and listen to what I’m going to say. He said he
was listening. I’ll listen but I won’t sit down.

Well, that’s the way it goes sometimes in schools. You as teacher become
obsessed  with  an  issue—I  was  the  injured  party,  conferring,  as  usual,
unheard-of freedoms, and here they were as usual taking advantage. It ain’t
pleasant  coming  in  the  teachers’  room  for  coffee  and  having  to  hear
somebody say that so-and-so and so-and-so from your class were out in the
halls without a pass and making faces and giving the finger to kids in my class
during the most important part of my lesson about Egypt—and you ought to
be  allowed  your  tendentious  speech,  and  most  everyone  will  allow  it,  sit
down  for  it,  but  occasionally  someone  wises  you  up  by  refusing  to  submit
where it isn’t necessary.... How  did any of us get into  this? we ought to be
asking ourselves.

Any  writer  who  uses  “ain’t”  and  “tendentious”  in  the  same  sentence,  who
quotes  without  using  quotation  marks,  knows  what  he’s  doing.  This  seemingly
artless  style,  so  full  of  art,  is  ideal  for  Herndon’s  purpose.  It  avoids  the
pretentiousness that infects so much writing by people doing worthy work, and
it  allows  for  a  rich  vein  of  humor  and  common  sense.  Herndon  sounds  like  a
good  teacher  and  a  man  whose  company  I  would  enjoy.  But  ultimately  he  is
writing for himself: an audience of one.

“Who am I writing for?” The question that begins this chapter has irked some
readers. They want me to say “Whom am I writing for?” But I can’t bring myself
to say it. It’s just not me.

Words

There is a kind of  writing that might be called  journalese, and it’s the death of
freshness  in  anybody’s  style.  It’s  the  common  currency  of  newspapers  and  of
magazines  like  People—a  mixture  of  cheap  words,  made-up  words  and  clichés
that  have  become  so  pervasive  that  a  writer  can  hardly  help  using  them.  You
must fight these phrases or you’ll sound like every hack. You’ll never make your
mark  as  a  writer  unless  you  develop  a  respect  for  words  and  a  curiosity  about
their shades of meaning that is almost obsessive. The English language is rich in
strong  and  supple  words.  Take  the  time  to  root  around  and  find  the  ones  you
want.

What  is  “journalese”?  It’s  a  quilt  of  instant  words  patched  together  out  of
other parts of speech. Adjectives are used as nouns (“greats,” “notables”). Nouns
are used as verbs (“to host”), or they are chopped off to form verbs (“enthuse,”
“emote”), or they are padded to form verbs (“beef up,” “put teeth into”). This is
a world where eminent people are “famed” and their associates are “staffers,”
where  the  future  is  always  “upcoming”  and  someone  is  forever  “firing  off”  a
note.  Nobody  in  America  has  sent  a  note  or  a  memo  or  a  telegram  in  years.
Famed  diplomat  Condoleezza  Rice,  who  hosts  foreign  notables  to  beef  up  the
morale of top State Department staffers, sits down and fires off a lot of notes.
Notes  that  are  fired  off  are  always  fired  in  anger  and  from  a  sitting  position.
What the weapon is I’ve never found out.

Here’s  an  article  from  a  famed  newsmagazine  that  is  hard  to  match  for

fatigue:

Last February, Plainclothes Patrolman Frank Serpico knocked at the door
of  a  suspected  Brooklyn  heroin  pusher.  When  the  door  opened  a  crack,
Serpico shouldered his way in only to be met by a .22-cal. pistol slug crashing
into  his  face.  Somehow  he  survived,  although  there  are  still  buzzing
fragments  in  his  head,  causing  dizziness  and  permanent  deafness  in  his  left
ear. Almost as painful is the suspicion that he may well have been set up for
the shooting by other policemen. For Serpico, 35, has been waging a lonely,
four-year war against the routine and endemic corruption that he and others

claim  is  rife  in  the  New  York  City  police  department.  His  efforts  are  now
sending  shock  waves  through  the  ranks  of  New  York’s  finest....  Though  the
impact of the commission’s upcoming report has yet to be felt, Serpico has
little hope that …

The upcoming report has yet to be felt because it’s still upcoming, and as for
the permanent deafness, it’s a little early to tell. And what makes those buzzing
fragments buzz? By now only Serpico’s head should be buzzing. But apart from
these lazinesses of logic, what makes the story so tired is the failure of the writer
to reach for anything but the nearest cliché. “Shouldered his way,” “only to be
met,”  “crashing  into  his  face,”  “waging  a  lonely  war,”  “corruption  that  is  rife,”
“sending  shock  waves,”  “New  York’s  finest”—these  dreary  phrases  constitute
writing at its most banal. We know just what to expect. No surprise awaits us in
the form of an unusual word, an oblique look. We are in the hands of a hack, and
we know it right away. We stop reading.

Don’t  let  yourself  get  in  this  position.  The  only  way  to  avoid  it  is  to  care
deeply about words. If you find yourself writing that someone recently enjoyed a
spell of illness, or that a business has been enjoying a slump, ask yourself how
much  they  enjoyed  it.  Notice  the  decisions  that  other  writers  make  in  their
choice of words and be finicky about the ones you select from the vast supply.
The race in writing is not to the swift but to the original.

Make a habit of reading what is being written today and what was written by
earlier  masters.  Writing  is  learned  by  imitation.  If  anyone  asked  me  how  I
learned  to  write,  I’d  say  I  learned  by  reading  the  men  and  women  who  were
doing the kind of writing I wanted to do and trying to figure out how they did it.
But  cultivate  the  best  models.  Don’t  assume  that  because  an  article  is  in  a
newspaper  or  a  magazine  it  must  be  good.  Sloppy  editing  is  common  in
newspapers,  often  for  lack  of  time,  and  writers  who  use  clichés  often  work  for
editors who have seen so many clichés that they no longer even recognize them.
Also  get  in  the  habit  of  using  dictionaries.  My  favorite  for  handy  use  is
Webster’s New World Dictionary, Second College Edition, although, like all word
freaks,  I  own  bigger  dictionaries  that  will  reward  me  when  I’m  on  some  more
specialized search. If you have any doubt of what a word means, look it up. Learn
its  etymology  and  notice  what  curious  branches  its  original  root  has  put  forth.
See if it has any meanings you didn’t know it had. Master the small gradations
between  words  that  seem  to  be  synonyms.  What’s  the  difference  between
“cajole,”  “wheedle,”  “blandish”  and  “coax”?  Get  yourself  a  dictionary  of
synonyms.

And don’t scorn that bulging grab bag Roget’s Thesaurus. It’s easy to regard
the book as hilarious. Look up “villain,” for instance, and you’ll be awash in such
rascality  as  only  a  lexicographer  could  conjure  back  from  centuries  of  iniquity,
obliquity,  depravity,  knavery,  profligacy,  frailty,  flagrancy,  infamy,  immorality,
corruption, wickedness, wrongdoing, backsliding and sin. You’ll find ruffians and

riffraff,  miscreants  and  malefactors,  reprobates  and  rapscallions,  hooligans  and
hoodlums,  scamps  and  scapegraces,  scoundrels  and  scalawags,  jezebels  and
jades.  You’ll  find  adjectives  to  fit  them  all  (foul  and  fiendish,  devilish  and
diabolical),  and  adverbs  and  verbs  to  describe  how  the  wrongdoers  do  their
wrong,  and  cross-references  leading  to  still  other  thickets  of  venality  and  vice.
Still, there’s no better friend to have around to nudge the memory than Roget. It
saves  you  the  time  of  rummaging  in  your  brain—that  network  of  overloaded
grooves—to find the word that’s right on the tip of your tongue, where it doesn’t
do you any good. The Thesaurus is to the writer what a rhyming dictionary is to
the  songwriter—a  reminder  of  all  the  choices—and  you  should  use  it  with
gratitude. If, having found the scalawag and the scapegrace, you want to know
how they differ, then go to the dictionary.

Also bear in mind, when you’re choosing words and stringing them together,
how they sound. This may seem absurd: readers read with their eyes. But in fact
they  hear  what  they  are  reading  far  more  than  you  realize.  Therefore  such
matters as rhythm and alliteration are vital to every sentence. A typical example
—maybe not the best, but undeniably the nearest—is the preceding paragraph.
Obviously I enjoyed making a certain arrangement of my ruffians and riffraff, my
hooligans and hoodlums, and my readers enjoyed it too—far more than if I had
provided  a  mere  list.  They  enjoyed  not  only  the  arrangement  but  the  effort  to
entertain  them.  They  weren’t  enjoying  it,  however,  with  their  eyes.  They  were
hearing the words in their inner ear.

E. B. White makes the case cogently in The Elements of Style,  a  book  every
writer should read once a year, when he suggests trying to rearrange any phrase
that  has  survived  for  a  century  or  two,  such  as  Thomas  Paine’s  “These  are  the
times that try men’s souls”:

      Times like these try men’s souls.
      How trying it is to live in these times!
      These are trying times for men’s souls.
      Soulwise, these are trying times.

Paine’s phrase is like poetry and the other four are like oatmeal—which is the
divine mystery of the creative process. Good writers of prose must be part poet,
always  listening  to  what  they  write.  E.  B.  White  is  one  of  my  favorite  stylists
because  I’m  conscious  of  being  with  a  man  who  cares  about  the  cadences  and
sonorities of the language. I relish (in my ear) the pattern his words make as they
fall  into  a  sentence.  I  try  to  surmise  how  in  rewriting  the  sentence  he
reassembled  it  to  end  with  a  phrase  that  will  momentarily  linger,  or  how  he
chose one word over another because he was after a certain emotional weight.
It’s the difference between, say, “serene” and “tranquil”—one so soft, the other
strangely disturbing because of the unusual n and q.

Such  considerations  of  sound  and  rhythm  should  go  into  everything  you

write.  If  all  your  sentences  move  at  the  same  plodding  gait,  which  even  you
recognize  as  deadly  but  don’t  know  how  to  cure,  read  them  aloud.  (I  write
entirely by ear and read everything aloud before letting it go out into the world.)
You’ll  begin  to  hear  where  the  trouble  lies.  See  if  you  can  gain  variety  by
reversing the order of a sentence, or by substituting a word that has freshness or
oddity, or by altering the length of your sentences so they don’t all sound as if
they  came  out  of  the  same  machine.  An  occasional  short  sentence  can  carry  a
tremendous punch. It stays in the reader’s ear.

Remember that words are the only tools you’ve got. Learn to use them with

originality and care. And also remember: somebody out there is listening.

Usage

All this talk about good words and bad words brings us to a gray but important
area  called  “usage.”  What  is  good  usage?  What  is  good  English?  What  newly
minted  words  is  it  O.K.  to  use,  and  who  is  to  be  the  judge?  Is  it  O.K.  to  use
“O.K.”?

Earlier

I  mentioned  an

incident  of  college  students  hassling  the
administration, and in the last chapter I described myself as a word freak. Here
are two fairly recent arrivals. “Hassle” is both a verb and a noun, meaning to give
somebody a hard time, or the act of being given a hard time, and anyone who
has ever been hassled for not properly filling out Form 35-BX will agree that the
word sounds exactly right. “Freak” means an enthusiast, and there’s no missing
the  aura  of  obsession  that  goes  with  calling  someone  a  jazz  freak,  or  a  chess
freak, or a sun freak, though it would probably be pushing my luck to describe a
man who compulsively visits circus sideshows as a freak freak.

Anyway, I accept these two usages gladly. I don’t consider them slang, or put
quotation marks around them to show that I’m mucking about in the argot of the
youth culture and really know better. They’re good words and we need them But
I  won’t  accept  “notables”  and  “greats”  and  “upcoming”  and  many  other
newcomers. They are cheap words and we don’t need them.

Why is one word good and another word cheap? I can’t give you an answer,
because usage has no fixed boundaries. Language is a fabric that changes from
one week to another, adding new strands and dropping old ones, and even word
freaks  fight  over  what  is  allowable,  often  reaching  their  decision  on  a  wholly
subjective  basis  such  as  taste  (“notables”  is  sleazy).  Which  still  leaves  the
question of who our tastemakers are.

The  question  was  confronted  in  the  1960s  by  the  editors  of  a  brand-new
dictionary,  The  American  Heritage  Dictionary.  They  assembled  a  “Usage  Panel”
to help them appraise the new words and dubious constructions that had come
knocking  at  the  door.  Which  ones  should  be  ushered  in,  which  thrown  out  on
their  ear?  The  panel  consisted  of  104  men  and  women—mostly  writers,  poets,
editors and teachers—who were known for caring about the language and trying
to use it well. I was a member of the panel, and over the next few years I kept

getting questionnaires. Would I accept “finalize” and “escalate”? How did I feel
about “It’s me”? Would I allow “like” to be used as a conjunction—like so many
people do? How about “mighty,” as in “mighty fine”?

We  were  told  that  in  the  dictionary  our  opinions  would  be  tabulated  in  a
separate  “Usage  Note,”  so  that  readers  could  see  how  we  voted.  The
questionnaire also left room for any comments we might feel impelled to make
—an  opportunity  the  panelists  seized  avidly,  as  we  found  when  the  dictionary
was published and our comments were released to the press. Passions ran high.
“Good  God,  no!  Never!”  cried  Barbara  W.  Tuchman,  asked  about  the  verb  “to
author.” Scholarship hath no fury like that of a language purist faced with sludge,
and I shared Tuchman’s vow that “author” should never be authorized, just as I
agreed  with  Lewis  Mumford  that  the  adverb  “good”  should  be  “left  as  the
exclusive property of Ernest Hemingway.”

But guardians of usage are doing only half their job if they merely keep the
language  from  becoming  sloppy.  Any  dolt  can  rule  that  the  suffix  “wise,”  as  in
“healthwise,” is doltwise, or that being “rather unique” is no more possible than
being rather pregnant. The other half of the job is to help the language grow by
welcoming any immigrant that will bring strength or color. Therefore I was glad
that 97 percent of us voted to admit “dropout,” which is clean and vivid, but that
only 47 percent would accept “senior citizen,” which is typical of the pudgy new
intruders  from  the  land  of  sociology,  where  an  illegal  alien  is  now  an
undocumented  resident.  I’m  glad  we  accepted  “escalate,”  the  kind  of  verbal
contraption  I  generally  dislike  but  which  the  Vietnam  war  endowed  with  a
precise meaning, complete with overtones of blunder.

I’m glad we took into full membership all sorts of robust words that previous
dictionaries  derided  as  “colloquial”:  adjectives  like  “rambunctious,”  verbs  like
“trigger”  and  “rile,”  nouns  like  “shambles”  and  “tycoon”  and  “trek,”  the  latter
approved  by  78  percent  to  mean  any  difficult  trip,  as  in  “the  commuter’s  daily
trek  to  Manhattan.”  Originally  it  was  a  Cape  Dutch  word  applied  to  the  Boers’
arduous  journey  by  ox  wagon.  But  our  panel  evidently  felt  that  the  Manhattan
commuter’s daily trek is no less arduous.

Still, 22 percent were unwilling to let “trek” slip into general usage. That was
the virtue of revealing how our panel voted—it put our opinions on display, and
writers in doubt can conduct themselves accordingly. Thus our 95 percent vote
against  “myself,”  as  in  “He  invited  Mary  and  myself  to  dinner,”  a  word
condemned as “prissy,” “horrible” and “a genteelism,” ought to warn off anyone
who doesn’t want to be prissy, horrible or genteel. As Red Smith put it, “‘Myself’
is the refuge of idiots taught early that ‘me’ is a dirty word.”

On  the  other  hand,  only  66  percent  of  our  panel  rejected  the  verb  “to
contact,” once regarded as tacky, and only half opposed the split infinitive and
the  verbs  “to  fault”  and  “to  bus.”  So  only  50  percent  of  your  readers  will  fault
you if you decide to voluntarily call your school board and to bus your children to
another  town.  If  you  contact  your  school  board  you  risk  your  reputation  by

another  16  percent.  Our  apparent  rule  of  thumb  was  stated  by  Theodore  M.
Bernstein, author of the excellent The Careful Writer: “We should apply the test
of convenience. Does the word fill a real need? If it does, let’s give it a franchise.”
All of this confirms what lexicographers have always known: that the laws of
usage are relative, bending with the taste of the lawmaker. One of our panelists,
Katherine  Anne  Porter,  called  “O.K.”  a  “detestable  vulgarity”  and  claimed  she
had never spoken the word in her life, whereas I freely admit that I have spoken
the  word  “O.K.”  “Most,”  as  in  “most  everyone,”  was  scorned  as  “cute  farmer
talk” by Isaac Asimov and embraced as a “good English idiom” by Virgil Thomson.
“Regime,”  meaning  any  administration,  as  in  “the  Truman  regime,”  drew  the
approval  of  most  everyone  on  the  panel,  as  did  “dynasty.”  But  they  drew  the
wrath of Jacques Barzun, who said, “These are technical terms, you blasted non-
historians!”  Probably  I  gave  my  O.K.  to  “regime.”  Now,  chided  by  Barzun  for
imprecision, I think it looks like journalese. One of the words I railed against was
“personality,” as in a “TV personality.” But now I wonder if it isn’t the only word
for that vast swarm of people who are famous for being famous—and possibly
nothing else. What did the Gabor sisters actually do?

In  the  end  it  comes  down  to  what  is  “correct”  usage.  We  have  no  king  to
establish the King’s English; we only have the President’s English, which we don’t
want. Webster, long a defender of the faith, muddied the waters in 1961 with its
permissive  Third  Edition,  which  argued  that  almost  anything  goes  as  long  as
somebody uses it, noting that “ain’t” is “used orally in most parts of the U.S. by
many cultivated speakers.”

Just  where  Webster  cultivated  those  speakers  I  ain’t  sure.  Nevertheless  it’s
true  that  the  spoken  language  is  looser  than  the  written  language,  and  The
American Heritage Dictionary properly put its question to us in both forms. Often
we allowed an oral idiom that we forbade in print as too informal, fully realizing,
however,  that  “the  pen  must  at  length  comply  with  the  tongue,”  as  Samuel
Johnson said, and that today’s spoken garbage may be tomorrow’s written gold.
The growing acceptance of the split infinitive, or of the preposition at the end of
a  sentence,  proves  that  formal  syntax  can’t  hold  the  fort  forever  against  a
speaker’s  more  comfortable  way  of  getting  the  same  thing  said—and  it
shouldn’t. I think a sentence is a fine thing to put a preposition at the end of.

Our  panel  recognized  that  correctness  can  even  vary  within  a  word.  We
voted  heavily  against  “cohort”  as  a  synonym  for  “colleague,”  except  when  the
tone was jocular. Thus a professor would not be among his cohorts at a faculty
meeting, but they would abound at his college reunion, wearing funny hats. We
rejected “too” as a synonym for “very,” as in “His health is not too good.” Whose
health is? But we approved it in sardonic or humorous use, as in “He was not too
happy when she ignored him.”

These  may  seem  like  picayune  distinctions.  They’re  not.  They  are  signals  to
the  reader  that  you  are  sensitive  to  the  shadings  of  usage.  “Too”  when
substituted for “very” is clutter: “He didn’t feel too much like going shopping.”

But the wry example in the previous paragraph is worthy of Ring Lardner. It adds
a tinge of sarcasm that otherwise wouldn’t be there.

Luckily, a pattern emerged from the deliberations of our panel, and it offers a
guideline that is still useful. We turned out to be liberal in accepting new words
and phrases, but conservative in grammar.

It  would  be  foolish  to  reject  a  word  as  perfect  as  “dropout,”  or  to  pretend
that  countless  words  and  phrases  are  not  entering  the  gates  of  correct  usage
every  day,  borne  on  the  winds  of  science  and  technology,  business  and  sports
and  social  change:  “outsource,”  “blog,”  “laptop,”  “mousepad,”  “geek,”
“boomer,” “Google,” “iPod,” “hedge fund,” “24/7,” “multi-tasking,” “slam dunk”
and  hundreds  of  others.  Nor  should  we  forget  all  the  short  words  invented  by
the  counterculture  in  the  1960s  as  a  way  of  lashing  back  at  the  self-important
verbiage  of  the  Establishment:  “trip,”  “rap,”  “crash,”  “trash,”  “funky,”  “split,”
“rip-off,” “vibes,” “downer,” “bummer.” If brevity is a prize, these were winners.
The  only  trouble  with  accepting  words  that  entered  the  language  overnight  is
that  they  often  leave  just  as  abruptly.  The  “happenings”  of  the  late  1960s  no
longer happen, “out of sight” is out of sight, and even “awesome” has begun to
chill out. The writer who cares about usage must always know the quick from the
dead.

flouting

the  rule,  and

As for the area where our Usage Panel was conservative, we upheld most of
the  classic  distinctions  in  grammar—“can”  and  “may,”  “fewer”  and  “less,”
“eldest” and “oldest,” etc.—and decried the classic errors, insisting that “flout”
still  doesn’t  mean  “flaunt,”  no  matter  how  many  writers  flaunt  their  ignorance
by
that  “fortuitous”  still  means  “accidental,”
“disinterested”  still  means  “impartial,”  and  “infer”  doesn’t  mean  “imply.”  Here
we  were  motivated  by  our  love  of  the  language’s  beautiful  precision.  Incorrect
usage will lose you the readers you would most like to win. Know the difference
between  a  “reference”  and  an  “allusion,”  between  “connive”  and  “conspire,”
between “compare with” and “compare to.” If you must use “comprise,” use it
right. It means “include”; dinner comprises meat, potatoes, salad and dessert.

“I choose always the grammatical form unless it sounds affected,” Marianne
Moore explained, and that’s finally where our panel took its stand. We were not
pedants,  so  hung  up  on  correctness  that  we  didn’t  want  the  language  to  keep
refreshing  itself  with  phrases  like  “hung  up.”  But  that  didn’t  mean  we  had  to
accept every atrocity that comes lumbering in.

Meanwhile  the  battle  continues.  Today  I  still  receive  ballots  from  The
American Heritage Dictionary soliciting my opinion on new locutions: verbs like
like  “affordables,”
“definitize”  (“Congress  definitized  a  proposal”),  nouns
into
colloquialisms
backgammon and she’s into jogging”).

like  “into”  (“He’s

like  “the  bottom

line”  and  strays

It no longer takes a panel of experts to notice that jargon is flooding our daily
life  and  language.  President  Carter  signed  an  executive  order  directing  that
federal regulations be written “simply and clearly.” President Clinton’s attorney

general,  Janet  Reno,  urged  the  nation’s  lawyers  to  replace  “a  lot  of  legalese”
with  “small,  old  words  that  all  people  understand”—words  like  “right”  and
“wrong” and “justice.” Corporations have hired consultants to make their prose
less  opaque,  and  even  the  insurance  industry  is  trying  to  rewrite  its  policies  to
tell us in less disastrous English what redress will be ours when disaster strikes.
Whether  these  efforts  will  do  much  good  I  wouldn’t  want  to  bet.  Still,  there’s
comfort  in  the  sight  of  so  many  watchdogs  standing  Canute-like  on  the  beach,
trying to hold back the tide. That’s where all careful writers ought to be—looking
at every new piece of flotsam that washes up and asking “Do we need it?”

I remember the first time somebody asked me, “How does that impact you?”
I always thought “impact” was a noun, except in dentistry. Then I began to meet
“de-impact,”  usually  in  connection  with  programs  to  de-impact  the  effects  of
some  adversity.  Nouns  now  turn  overnight  into  verbs.  We  target  goals  and  we
access facts. Train conductors announce that the train won’t platform. A sign on
an airport door tells me that the door is alarmed. Companies are downsizing. It’s
part of an ongoing effort to grow the business. “Ongoing” is a jargon word whose
main use is to raise morale. We face our daily job with more zest if the boss tells
us  it’s  an  ongoing  project;  we  give  more  willingly  to  institutions  if  they  have
targeted  our  funds  for  ongoing  needs.  Otherwise  we  might  fall  prey  to
disincentivization.

I  could  go  on;  I  have  enough  examples  to  fill  a  book,  but  it’s  not  a  book  I
would  want  anyone  to  read.  We’re  still  left  with  the  question:  What  is  good
usage? One helpful approach is to try to separate usage from jargon.

I  would  say,  for  example,  that  “prioritize”  is  jargon—a  pompous  new  verb
that  sounds  more  important  than  “rank”—and  that  “bottom  line”  is  usage,  a
metaphor borrowed from the world of bookkeeping that conveys an image we
can  picture.  As  every  businessman  knows,  the  bottom  line  is  the  one  that
matters. If someone says, “The bottom line is that we just can’t work together,”
we  know  what  he  means.  I  don’t  much  like  the  phrase,  but  the  bottom  line  is
that it’s here to stay.

New  usages  also  arrive  with  new  political  events.  Just  as  Vietnam  gave  us
“escalate,”  Watergate  gave  us  a  whole  lexicon  of  words  connoting  obstruction
and  deceit,  including  “deep-six,”  “launder,”  “enemies  list”  and  other  “gate”-
suffix scandals (“Irangate”). It’s a fitting irony that under Richard Nixon “launder”
became a dirty word. Today when we hear that someone laundered his funds to
hide  the  origin  of  the  money  and  the  route  it  took,  the  word  has  a  precise
meaning. It’s short, it’s vivid, and we need it. I accept “launder” and “stonewall”;
I don’t accept “prioritize” and “disincentive.”

I would suggest a similar guideline for separating good English from technical
English. It’s the difference between, say, “printout” and “input.” A printout is a
specific object that a computer emits. Before the advent of computers it wasn’t
needed; now it is. But it has stayed where it belongs. Not so with “input,” which
was  coined  to  describe  the  information  that’s  fed  to  a  computer.  Our  input  is

sought  on  every  subject,  from  diets  to  philosophical  discourse  (“I’d  like  your
input on whether God really exists”).

I don’t want to give somebody my input and get his feedback, though I’d be
glad  to  offer  my  ideas  and  hear  what  he  thinks  of  them.  Good  usage,  to  me,
consists of using good words if they already exist—as they almost always do—to
express  myself  clearly  and  simply  to  someone  else.  You  might  say  it’s  how  I
verbalize the interpersonal.

PART II

Methods

Unity

You learn to write by writing. It’s a truism, but what makes it a truism is that it’s
true.  The  only  way  to  learn  to  write  is  to  force  yourself  to  produce  a  certain
number of words on a regular basis.

If you went to work for a newspaper that required you to write two or three
articles every day, you would be a better writer after six months. You wouldn’t
necessarily be writing well; your style might still be full of clutter and clichés. But
you would be exercising your powers of putting the English language on paper,
gaining confidence and identifying the most common problems.

All writing is ultimately a question of solving a problem. It may be a problem
of  where  to  obtain  the  facts  or  how  to  organize  the  material.  It  may  be  a
problem  of  approach  or  attitude,  tone  or  style.  Whatever  it  is,  it  has  to  be
confronted and solved. Sometimes you will despair of finding the right solution—
or any solution. You’ll think, “If I live to be ninety I’ll never get out of this mess.”
I’ve often thought it myself. But when I finally do solve the problem it’s because
I’m like a surgeon removing his 500th appendix; I’ve been there before.

Unity is the anchor of good writing. So, first, get your unities straight. Unity
not  only  keeps  the  reader  from  straggling  off  in  all  directions;  it  satisfies  your
readers’ subconscious need for order and reassures them that all is well at the
helm. Therefore choose from among the many variables and stick to your choice.
One choice is unity of pronoun. Are you going to write in the first person, as a
participant, or in the third person, as an observer? Or even in the second person,
that darling of sportswriters hung up on Hemingway? (“You knew this had to be
the most spine-tingling clash of giants you’d ever seen from a pressbox seat, and
you weren’t just some green kid who was still wet behind the ears.”)

Unity of tense is another choice. Most people write mainly in the past tense
(“I went up to Boston the other day”), but some people write agreeably in the
present  (“I’m  sitting  in  the  dining  car  of  the  Yankee  Limited  and  we’re  pulling
into Boston”). What is not agreeable is to switch back and forth. I’m not saying
you can’t use more than one tense; the whole purpose of tenses is to enable a
writer  to  deal  with  time  in  its  various  gradations,  from  the  past  to  the
hypothetical future (“When I telephoned my mother from the Boston station, I

realized that if I had written to tell her I would be coming she would have waited
for  me”).  But  you  must  choose  the  tense  in  which  you  are  principally  going  to
address  the  reader,  no  matter  how  many  glances  you  may  take  backward  or
forward along the way.

Another choice is unity of mood. You might want to talk to the reader in the
casual voice that The New Yorker has strenuously refined. Or you might want to
approach  the  reader  with  a  certain  formality  to  describe  a  serious  event  or  to
present a set of important facts. Both tones are acceptable. In fact, any tone is
acceptable. But don’t mix two or three.

Such  fatal  mixtures  are  common  in  writers  who  haven’t  learned  control.
Travel writing is a conspicuous example. “My wife, Ann, and I had always wanted
to  visit  Hong  Kong,”  the  writer  begins,  his  blood  astir  with  reminiscence,  “and
one  day  last  spring  we  found  ourselves  looking  at  an  airline  poster  and  I  said,
‘Let’s go!’ The kids were grown up,” he continues, and he proceeds to describe in
genial detail how he and his wife stopped off in Hawaii and had such a comical
time changing their money at the Hong Kong airport and finding their hotel. Fine.
He is a real person taking us along on a real trip, and we can identify with him
and Ann.

Suddenly  he  turns  into  a  travel  brochure.  “Hong  Kong  affords  many
fascinating  experiences  to  the  curious  sightseer,”  he  writes.  “One  can  ride  the
picturesque ferry from Kowloon and gawk at the myriad sampans as they scuttle
across the teeming harbor, or take a day’s trip to browse in the alleys of fabled
Macao with its colorful history as a den of smuggling and intrigue. You will want
to take the quaint funicular that climbs …” Then we get back to him and Ann and
their  efforts  to  eat  at  Chinese  restaurants,  and  again  all  is  well.  Everyone  is
interested in food, and we are being told about a personal adventure.

Then suddenly the writer is a guidebook: “To enter Hong Kong it is necessary
to  have  a  valid  passport,  but  no  visa  is  required.  You  should  definitely  be
immunized against hepatitis and you would also be well advised to consult your
physician with regard to a possible inoculation for typhoid. The climate in Hong
Kong is seasonable except in July and August when …” Our writer is gone, and so
is Ann, and so—very soon—are we.

It’s  not  that  the  scuttling  sampans  and  the  hepatitis  shots  shouldn’t  be
included. What annoys us is that the writer never decided what kind of article he
wanted  to  write  or  how  he  wanted  to  approach  us.  He  comes  at  us  in  many
guises,  depending  on  what  kind  of  material  he  is  trying  to  purvey.  Instead  of
controlling his material, his material is controlling him. That wouldn’t happen if
he took time to establish certain unities.

Therefore ask yourself some basic  questions before you start. For example:
“In  what  capacity  am  I  going  to  address  the  reader?”  (Reporter?  Provider  of
information? Average man or woman?) “What pronoun and tense am I going to
use?” “What style?” (Impersonal reportorial? Personal but formal? Personal and
casual?)  “What  attitude  am  I  going  to  take  toward  the  material?”  (Involved?

Detached?  Judgmental?  Ironic?  Amused?)  “How  much  do  I  want  to  cover?”
“What one point do I want to make?”

The last two questions are especially important. Most nonfiction writers have
a definitiveness complex. They feel that they are under some obligation—to the
subject,  to  their  honor,  to  the  gods  of  writing—to  make  their  article  the  last
word. It’s a commendable impulse, but there is no last word. What you think is
definitive  today  will  turn  undefinitive  by  tonight,  and  writers  who  doggedly
pursue  every  last  fact  will  find  themselves  pursuing  the  rainbow  and  never
settling down to write. Nobody can write a book or an article “about” something.
Tolstoy  couldn’t  write  a  book  about  war  and  peace,  or  Melville  a  book  about
whaling. They made certain reductive decisions about time and place and about
individual characters in that time and place—one man pursuing one whale. Every
writing project must be reduced before you start to write.

Therefore  think  small.  Decide  what  corner  of  your  subject  you’re  going  to
bite off, and be content to cover it well and stop. This is also a matter of energy
and morale. An unwieldy writing task is a drain on your enthusiasm. Enthusiasm
is the force that keeps you going and keeps the reader in your grip. When your
zest begins to ebb, the reader is the first person to know it.

As  for  what  point  you  want  to  make,  every  successful  piece  of  nonfiction
should leave the reader with one provocative thought that he or she didn’t have
before.  Not  two  thoughts,  or  five—just  one.  So  decide  what  single  point  you
want to leave in the reader’s mind. It will not only give you a better idea of what
route  you  should  follow  and  what  destination  you  hope  to  reach;  it  will  affect
your  decision  about  tone  and  attitude.  Some  points  are  best  made  by
earnestness, some by dry understatement, some by humor.

Once you have your unities decided, there’s no material you can’t work into
your  frame.  If  the  tourist  in  Hong  Kong  had  chosen  to  write  solely  in  the
conversational vein about what he and Ann did, he would have found a natural
way  to  weave  into  his  narrative  whatever  he  wanted  to  tell  us  about  the
Kowloon  ferry  and  the  local  weather.  His  personality  and  purpose  would  have
been intact, and his article would have held together.

Now  it  often  happens  that  you’ll  make  these  prior  decisions  and  then
discover that they weren’t the right ones. The material begins to lead you in an
unexpected  direction,  where  you  are  more  comfortable  writing  in  a  different
tone.  That’s  normal—the  act  of  writing  generates  some  cluster  of  thoughts  or
memories  that  you  didn’t  anticipate.  Don’t  fight  such  a  current  if  it  feels  right.
Trust your material if it’s taking you into terrain you didn’t intend to enter but
where  the  vibrations  are  good.  Adjust  your  style  accordingly  and  proceed  to
whatever  destination  you  reach.  Don’t  become  the  prisoner  of  a  preconceived
plan. Writing is no respecter of blueprints.

If this happens, the second part of your article will be badly out of joint with
the first. But at least you know which part is truest to your instincts. Then it’s just
a matter of making repairs. Go back to the beginning and rewrite it so that your

mood and your style are consistent from start to finish.

There’s nothing in such a method to be ashamed of. Scissors and paste—or
their  equivalent  on  a  computer—are  honorable  writers’  tools.  Just  remember
that  all  the  unities  must  be  fitted  into  the  edifice  you  finally  put  together,
however  backwardly  they  may  be  assembled,  or  it  will  soon  come  tumbling
down.

9

The Lead and the Ending

The  most  important  sentence  in  any  article  is  the  first  one.  If  it  doesn’t  induce
the  reader  to  proceed  to  the  second  sentence,  your  article  is  dead.  And  if  the
second  sentence  doesn’t  induce  him  to  continue  to  the  third  sentence,  it’s
equally  dead.  Of  such  a  progression  of  sentences,  each  tugging  the  reader
forward until he is hooked, a writer constructs that fateful unit, the “lead.”

How long should the lead be? One or two paragraphs? Four or five? There’s
no  pat  answer.  Some  leads  hook  the  reader  with  just  a  few  well-baited
sentences;  others  amble  on  for  several  pages,  exerting  a  slow  but  steady  pull.
Every article poses a different problem, and the only valid test is: does it work?
Your  lead  may  not  be  the  best  of  all  possible  leads,  but  if  it  does  the  job  it’s
supposed to do, be thankful and proceed.

Sometimes  the  length  may  depend  on  the  audience  you’re  writing  for.
Readers of a literary review expect its writers to start somewhat discursively, and
they will stick with those writers for the pleasure of wondering where they will
emerge  as  they  move  in  leisurely  circles  toward  the  eventual  point.  But  I  urge
you  not  to  count  on  the  reader  to  stick  around.  Readers  want  to  know—very
soon—what’s in it for them.

Therefore your lead must capture the reader immediately and force him to
keep  reading.  It  must  cajole  him  with  freshness,  or  novelty,  or  paradox,  or
humor, or surprise, or with an unusual idea, or an interesting fact, or a question.
Anything will do, as long as it nudges his curiosity and tugs at his sleeve.

Next the lead must do some real work. It must provide hard details that tell
the  reader  why  the  piece  was  written  and  why  he  ought  to  read  it.  But  don’t
dwell on the reason. Coax the reader a little more; keep him inquisitive.

Continue to build. Every paragraph should amplify the one that preceded it.
Give more thought to adding solid detail and less to entertaining the reader. But
take  special  care  with  the  last  sentence  of  each  paragraph—it’s  the  crucial
springboard  to  the  next  paragraph.  Try  to  give  that  sentence  an  extra  twist  of
humor or surprise, like the periodic “snapper” in the routine of a stand-up comic.
Make the reader smile and you’ve got him for at least one more paragraph.

Let’s  look  at  a  few  leads  that  vary  in  pace  but  are  alike  in  maintaining

pressure.  I’ll  start  with  two  columns  of  my  own  that  first  appeared  in  Life  and
Look—magazines  which,  judging  by  the  comments  of  readers,  found  their
consumers  mainly  in  barbershops,  hairdressing  salons,  airplanes  and  doctors’
offices (“I was getting a haircut the other day and I saw your article”). I mention
this as a reminder that far more periodical reading is done under the dryer than
under the reading lamp, so there isn’t much time for the writer to fool around.

The first is the lead of a piece called “Block That Chickenfurter”:

I’ve often wondered what goes into a hot dog. Now I know and I wish I

didn’t.

Two very short sentences. But it would be hard not to continue to the second

paragraph:

My trouble began when the Department of Agriculture published the hot
dog’s ingredients—everything that may legally qualify—because it was asked
by  the  poultry  industry  to  relax  the  conditions  under  which  the  ingredients
might  also  include  chicken.  In  other  words,  can  a  chickenfurter  find
happiness in the land of the frank?

One sentence that explains the incident that the column is based on. Then a

snapper to restore the easygoing tone.

Judging  by  the  1,066  mainly  hostile  answers  that  the  Department  got
when  it  sent  out  a  questionnaire  on  this  point,  the  very  thought  is
unthinkable.  The  public  mood  was  most  felicitously  caught  by  the  woman
who replied: “I don’t eat feather meat of no kind.”

Another  fact  and  another  smile.  Whenever  you’re  lucky  enough  to  get  a
quotation  as  funny  as  that  one,  find  a  way  to  use  it.  The  article  then  specifies
what  the  Department  of  Agriculture  says  may  go  into  a  hot  dog—a  list  that
includes  “the  edible  part  of  the  muscle  of  cattle,  sheep,  swine  or  goats,  in  the
diaphragm,  in  the  heart  or  in  the  esophagus  …  [but  not  including]  the  muscle
found in the lips, snout or ears.”

From  there  it  progresses—not  without  an  involuntary  reflex  around  the
esophagus—into  an  account  of  the  controversy  between  the  poultry  interests
and the frankfurter interests, which in turn leads to the point that Americans will
eat anything that even remotely resembles a hot dog. Implicit at the end is the
larger  point  that  Americans  don’t  know,  or  care,  what  goes  into  the  food  they
eat. The style of the article has remained casual and touched with humor. But its
content  turns  out  to  be  more  serious  than  readers  expected  when  they  were
drawn into it by a whimsical lead.

A  slower  lead,  luring  the  reader  more  with  curiosity  than  with  humor,

introduced a piece called “Thank God for Nuts”:

By any reasonable standard, nobody would want to look twice—or even
once—at the piece of slippery elm bark from Clear Lake, Wisc., birthplace of
pitcher Burleigh Grimes, that is on display at the National Baseball Museum
and Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y. As the label explains, it is the kind of
bark  Grimes  chewed  during  games  “to  increase  saliva  for  throwing  the
spitball.  When  wet,  the  ball  sailed  to  the  plate  in  deceptive  fashion.”  This
would  seem  to  be  one  of  the  least  interesting  facts  available  in  America
today.

But  baseball  fans  can’t  be  judged  by  any  reasonable  standard.  We  are
obsessed by the minutiae of the game and nagged for the rest of our lives by
the memory of players we once saw play. No item is therefore too trivial that
puts us back in touch with them. I am just old enough to remember Burleigh
Grimes  and  his  well-moistened  pitches  sailing  deceptively  to  the  plate,  and
when  I  found  his  bark  I  studied  it  as  intently  as  if  I  had  come  upon  the
Rosetta  Stone.  “So  that’s  how  he  did  it,”  I  thought,  peering  at  the  odd
botanical relic. “Slippery elm! I’ll be damned.”

This  was  only  one  of  several  hundred  encounters  I  had  with  my  own
boyhood as I prowled through the Museum. Probably no other museum is so
personal a pilgrimage to our past....

The reader is now safely hooked, and the hardest part of the writer’s job is

over.

One reason for citing this lead is to note that salvation often lies not in the
writer’s style but in some odd fact he or she was able to discover. I went up to
Cooperstown and spent a whole afternoon in the museum, taking notes. Jostled
everywhere  by  nostalgia,  I  gazed  with  reverence  at  Lou  Gehrig’s  locker  and
Bobby Thomson’s game-winning bat. I sat in a grandstand seat brought from the
Polo Grounds, dug my unspiked soles into the home plate from Ebbets Field, and
dutifully copied all the labels and captions that might be useful.

“These  are  the  shoes  that  touched  home  plate  as  Ted  finished  his  journey
around the bases,” said a label identifying the shoes worn by Ted Williams when
he  famously  hit  a  home  run  on  his  last  time  at  bat.  The  shoes  were  in  much
better shape than the pair—rotted open at the sides—that belonged to Walter
Johnson.  But  the  caption  provided  exactly  the  kind  of  justifying  fact  a  baseball
nut would want. “My feet must be comfortable when I’m out there a-pitching,”
the great Walter said.

The  museum  closed  at  five  and  I  returned  to  my  motel  secure  in  my
memories and my research. But instinct told me to go back the next morning for
one more tour, and it was only then that I noticed Burleigh Grimes’s slippery elm
bark, which struck me as an ideal lead. It still does.

One moral of this story is that you should always collect more material than
you  will  use.  Every  article  is  strong  in  proportion  to  the  surplus  of  details  from
which  you  can  choose  the  few  that  will  serve  you  best—if  you  don’t  go  on
gathering  facts  forever.  At  some  point  you  must  stop  researching  and  start
writing.

Another  moral  is  to  look  for  your  material  everywhere,  not  just  by  reading
the  obvious  sources  and  interviewing  the  obvious  people.  Look  at  signs  and  at
billboards  and  at  all  the  junk  written  along  the  American  roadside.  Read  the
labels  on  our  packages  and  the  instructions  on  our  toys,  the  claims  on  our
medicines  and  the  graffiti  on  our  walls.  Read  the  fillers,  so  rich  in  self-esteem,
that come spilling out of your monthly statement from the electric company and
the telephone company and the bank. Read menus and catalogues and second-
class mail. Nose about in obscure crannies of the newspaper, like the Sunday real
estate section—you can tell the temper of a society by what patio accessories it
wants.  Our  daily  landscape  is  thick  with  absurd  messages  and  portents.  Notice
them. They not only have social significance; they are often just quirky enough to
make a lead that’s different from everybody else’s.

Speaking  of  everybody  else’s  lead,  there  are  many  categories  I’d  be  glad
never  to  see  again.  One  is  the  future  archaeologist:  “When  some  future
archaeologist stumbles on the remains of our civilization, what will he make of
the jukebox?” I’m tired of him already and he’s not even here. I’m also tired of
the visitor from Mars: “If a creature from Mars landed on our planet he would be
amazed  to  see  hordes  of  scantily  clad  earthlings  lying  on  the  sand  barbecuing
their skins.” I’m tired of the cute event that just happened to happen “one day
not long ago” or on a conveniently recent Saturday afternoon: “One day not long
ago a small button-nosed boy was walking with his dog, Terry, in a field outside
Paramus, N.J., when he saw something that looked strangely like a balloon rising
out of the ground.” And I’m very tired of the have-in-common lead: “What did
Joseph  Stalin,  Douglas  MacArthur,  Ludwig  Wittgenstein,  Sherwood  Anderson,
Jorge  Luis  Borges  and  Akira  Kurosawa  have  in  common?  They  all  loved
Westerns.” Let’s retire the future archaeologist and the man from Mars and the
button-nosed boy. Try to give your lead a freshness of perception or detail.

Consider  this  lead,  by  Joan  Didion,  on  a  piece  called  “7000  Romaine,  Los

Angeles 38”:

Seven Thousand Romaine Street is in that part of Los Angeles familiar to
admirers  of  Raymond  Chandler  and  Dashiell  Hammett:  the  underside  of
Hollywood,  south  of  Sunset  Boulevard,  a  middle-class  slum  of  “model
studios”  and  warehouses  and  two-family  bungalows.  Because  Paramount
and Columbia and Desilu and the Samuel Goldwyn studios are nearby, many
of the people who live around here have some tenuous connection with the
motion-picture industry. They once processed fan photographs, say, or knew
Jean  Harlow’s  manicurist.  7000  Romaine  looks  itself  like  a  faded  movie

exterior, a pastel building with chipped art moderne  detailing,  the  windows
now  either  boarded  or  paned  with  chicken-wire  glass  and,  at  the  entrance,
among the dusty oleander, a rubber mat that reads WELCOME.

Actually  no  one  is  welcome,  for  7000  Romaine  belongs  to  Howard
Hughes,  and  the  door  is  locked.  That  the  Hughes  “communications  center”
should  lie  here  in  the  dull  sunlight  of  Hammett-Chandler  country  is  one  of
those circumstances that satisfy one’s suspicion that life is indeed a scenario,
for  the  Hughes  empire  has  been  in  our  time  the  only  industrial  complex  in
the world—involving, over the years, machinery manufacture, foreign oil-tool
subsidiaries, a brewery, two airlines, immense real-estate holdings, a major
motion-picture  studio,  and  an  electronics  and  missile  operation—run  by  a
man  whose  modus  operandi  most  closely  resembles  that  of  a  character  in
The Big Sleep.

As  it  happens,  I  live  not  far  from  7000  Romaine,  and  I  make  a  point  of
driving past it every now and then, I suppose in the same spirit that Arthurian
scholars  visit  the  Cornish  coast.  I  am  interested  in  the  folklore  of  Howard
Hughes....

What is pulling us into this article—toward, we hope, some glimpse of how
Hughes  operates,  some  hint  of  the  riddle  of  the  Sphinx—is  the  steady
accumulation  of  facts  that  have  pathos  and  faded  glamour.  Knowing  Jean
Harlow’s  manicurist  is  such  a  minimal  link  to  glory,  the  unwelcoming  welcome
mat  such  a  queer  relic  of  a  golden  age  when  Hollywood’s  windows  weren’t
paned with chicken-wire glass and the roost was ruled by giants like Mayer and
DeMille and Zanuck, who could actually be seen exercising their mighty power.
We want to know more; we read on.

Another approach is to just tell a story. It’s such a simple solution, so obvious
and unsophisticated, that we often forget that it’s available to us. But narrative is
the  oldest  and  most  compelling  method  of  holding  someone’s  attention;
everybody  wants  to  be  told  a  story.  Always  look  for  ways  to  convey  your
information  in  narrative  form.  What  follows  is  the  lead  of  Edmund  Wilson’s
account  of  the  discovery  of  the  Dead  Sea  Scrolls,  one  of  the  most  astonishing
relics  of  antiquity  to  turn  up  in  modern  times.  Wilson  doesn’t  spend  any  time
setting  the  stage.  This
is  not  the  “breakfast-to-bed”  format  used  by
inexperienced writers, in which a fishing trip begins with the ringing of an alarm
clock before daylight. Wilson starts right in—whap!—and we are caught:

At  some  point  rather  early  in  the  spring  of  1947,  a  Bedouin  boy  called
Muhammed  the  Wolf  was  minding  some  goats  near  a  cliff  on  the  western
shore of the Dead Sea. Climbing up after one that had strayed, he noticed a
cave that he had not seen before, and he idly threw a stone into it. There was
an unfamiliar sound of breakage. The boy was frightened and ran away. But
he later came back with another boy, and together they explored the cave.

Inside were several tall clay jars, among fragments of other jars. When they
took  off  the  bowl-like  lids,  a  very  bad  smell  arose,  which  came  from  dark
oblong lumps that were found inside all the jars. When they got these lumps
out of the cave, they saw that they were wrapped up in lengths of linen and
coated with a black layer of what seemed to be pitch or wax. They unrolled
them  and  found  long  manuscripts,  inscribed  in  parallel  columns  on  thin
sheets  that  had  been  sewn  together.  Though  these  manuscripts  had  faded
and  crumbled  in  places,  they  were  in  general  remarkably  clear.  The
character, they saw, was not Arabic. They wondered at the scrolls and kept
them, carrying them along when they moved.

These Bedouin boys belonged to a party of contrabanders, who had been
smuggling  their  goats  and  other  goods  out  of  Transjordan  into  Palestine.
They  had  detoured  so  far  to  the  south  in  order  to  circumvent  the  Jordan
bridge, which the customs officers guarded with guns, and had floated their
commodities across the stream. They were now on their way to Bethlehem
to sell their stuff in the black market....

Yet there can be no firm rules for how to write a lead. Within the broad rule
of  not  letting  the  reader  get  away,  all  writers  must  approach  their  subject  in  a
manner that most naturally suits what they are writing about and who they are.
Sometimes  you  can  tell  your  whole  story  in  the  first  sentence.  Here’s  the
opening sentence of seven memorable nonfiction books:

In the beginning God created heaven and earth.

—TOM WOLFE, THE RIGHT STUFF

You know more than you think you do.

—BENJAMIN SPOCK, BABY AND CHILD CARE

Those  are  some  suggestions  on  how  to  get  started.  Now  I  want  to  tell  you
how  to  stop.  Knowing  when  to  end  an  article  is  far  more  important  than  most
writers realize. You should give as much thought to choosing your last sentence
as you did to your first. Well, almost as much.

That may seem hard to believe. If your readers have stuck with you from the
beginning, trailing you around blind corners and over bumpy terrain, surely they
won’t leave when the end is in sight. Surely they will, because the end that’s in
sight turns out to be a mirage. Like the minister’s sermon that builds to a series
of perfect conclusions that never conclude, an article that doesn’t stop where it
should stop becomes a drag and therefore a failure.

Most  of  us  are  still  prisoners  of  the  lesson  pounded  into  us  by  the
composition  teachers  of  our  youth:  that  every  story  must  have  a  beginning,  a
middle and an end. We can still visualize the outline, with its Roman numerals (I,
II  and  III),  which  staked  out  the  road  we  would  faithfully  trudge,  and  its
subnumerals  (IIa  and  IIb)  denoting  lesser  paths  down  which  we  would  briefly
poke. But we always promised to get back to III and summarize our journey.

That’s  all  right  for  elementary  and  high  school  students  uncertain  of  their
ground.  It  forces  them  to  see  that  every  piece  of  writing  should  have  a  logical
design.  It’s  a  lesson  worth  knowing  at  any  age—even  professional  writers  are
adrift more often than they would like to admit. But if you’re going to write good
nonfiction you must wriggle out of III’s dread grip.

You’ll know you have arrived at III when you see emerging on your screen a
sentence that begins, “In sum, it can be noted that …” Or a question that asks,
“What insights, then, have we been able to glean from …?” These are signals that
you  are  about  to  repeat  in  compressed  form  what  you  have  already  said  in
detail. The reader’s interest begins to falter; the tension you have built begins to
sag. Yet you will be true to Miss Potter, your teacher, who made you swear fealty
to the holy outline. You remind the reader of what can, in sum, be noted. You go
gleaning one more time in insights you have already adduced.

But your readers hear the laborious sound of cranking. They notice what you
are  doing  and  how  bored  you  are  by  it.  They  feel  the  stirrings  of  resentment.
Why didn’t you give more thought to how you were going to wind this thing up?
Or  are  you  summarizing  because  you  think  they’re  too  dumb  to  get  the  point?
Still, you keep cranking. But the readers have another option. They quit.

That’s  the  negative  reason  for  remembering  the  importance  of  the  last

sentence. Failure to know where that sentence should occur can wreck an article
that  until  its  final  stage  has  been  tightly  constructed.  The  positive  reason  for
ending well is that a good last sentence—or last paragraph—is a joy in itself. It
gives the reader a lift, and it lingers when the article is over.

The perfect ending should take your readers slightly by surprise and yet seem
exactly right. They didn’t expect the article to end so soon, or so abruptly, or to
say what it said. But they know it when they see it. Like a good lead, it works. It’s
like the curtain line in a theatrical comedy. We are in the middle of a scene (we
think), when suddenly one of the actors says something funny, or outrageous, or
epigrammatic, and the lights go out. We are startled to find the scene over, and
then  delighted  by  the  aptness  of  how  it  ended.  What  delights  us  is  the
playwright’s perfect control.

For the nonfiction writer, the simplest way of putting this into a rule is: when
you’re ready to stop, stop. If you have presented all the facts and made the point
you want to make, look for the nearest exit.

Often  it  takes  just  a  few  sentences  to  wrap  things  up.  Ideally  they  should
encapsulate the idea of the piece and conclude with a sentence that jolts us with
its  fitness  or  unexpectedness.  Here’s  how  H.  L.  Mencken  ends  his  appraisal  of
President  Calvin  Coolidge,  whose  appeal  to  the  “customers”  was  that  his
“government  governed  hardly  at  all;  thus  the  ideal  of  Jefferson  was  realized  at
last, and the Jeffersonians were delighted”:

We suffer most, not when the White House is a peaceful dormitory, but
when it [has] a tin-pot Paul bawling from the roof. Counting out Harding as a
cipher only, Dr. Coolidge was preceded by one World Saver and followed by
two  more.  What  enlightened  American,  having  to  choose  between  any  of
them  and  another  Coolidge,  would  hesitate  for  an  instant?  There  were  no
thrills  while  he  reigned,  but  neither  were  there  any  headaches.  He  had  no
ideas, and he was not a nuisance.

The  five  short  sentences  send  the  reader  on  his  way  quickly  and  with  an
arresting thought to take along. The notion of Coolidge having no ideas and not
being a nuisance can’t help leaving a residue of enjoyment. It works.

Something I often do in my writing is to bring the story full circle—to strike at
the  end  an  echo  of  a  note  that  was  sounded  at  the  beginning.  It  gratifies  my
sense of symmetry, and it also pleases the reader, completing with its resonance
the journey we set out on together.

But  what  usually  works  best  is  a  quotation.  Go  back  through  your  notes  to
find  some  remark  that  has  a  sense  of  finality,  or  that’s  funny,  or  that  adds  an
unexpected closing detail. Sometimes it will jump out at you during the interview
—I’ve  often  thought,  “That’s  my  ending!”—or  during  the  process  of  writing.  In
the  mid-1960s,  when  Woody  Allen  was  just  becoming  established  as  America’s
resident  neurotic,  doing  nightclub  monologues,  I  wrote  the  first  long  magazine

piece that took note of his arrival. It ended like this:

“If  people  come  away  relating  to  me  as  a  person,”  Allen  says,  “rather
than just enjoying my jokes; if they come away wanting to hear me again, no
matter what I might talk about, then I’m succeeding.” Judging by the returns,
he is. Woody Allen is Mr. Related-To, and he seems a good bet to hold the
franchise for many years.

Yet  he  does  have  a  problem  all  his  own,  unshared  by,  unrelated  to,  the
rest  of  America.  “I’m  obsessed,”  he  says,  “by  the  fact  that  my  mother
genuinely resembles Groucho Marx.”

There’s a remark from so far out in left field that nobody could see it coming.
The  surprise  it  carries  is  tremendous.  How  could  it  not  be  a  perfect  ending?
Surprise  is  the  most  refreshing  element  in  nonfiction  writing.  If  something
surprises you it will also surprise—and delight—the people you are writing for,
especially as you conclude your story and send them on their way.

Bits & Pieces

This is a chapter of scraps and morsels—small admonitions on many points that I
have collected under one, as they say, umbrella.

VERBS.

Use  active  verbs  unless  there  is  no  comfortable  way  to  get  around  using  a
passive verb. The difference between an activeverb style and a passive-verb style
—in clarity and vigor—is the difference between life and death for a writer.

“Joe saw him” is strong. “He was seen by Joe” is weak. The first is short and
precise; it leaves no doubt about who did what. The second is necessarily longer
and it has an insipid quality: something was done by somebody to someone else.
It’s  also  ambiguous.  How  often  was  he  seen  by  Joe?  Once?  Every  day?  Once  a
week? A style that consists of passive constructions will sap the reader’s energy.
Nobody ever quite knows what is being perpetrated by whom and on whom.

I use “perpetrated” because it’s the kind of word that passive-voice writers
are fond of. They prefer long words of Latin origin to short Anglo-Saxon words—
which compounds their trouble and makes their sentences still more glutinous.
Short  is  better  than  long.  Of  the  701  words  in  Lincoln’s  Second  Inaugural
Address, a marvel of economy in itself, 505 are words of one syllable and 122 are
words of two syllables.

Verbs  are  the  most  important  of  all  your  tools.  They  push  the  sentence
forward and give it momentum. Active verbs push hard; passive verbs tug fitfully.
Active  verbs  also  enable  us  to  visualize  an  activity  because  they  require  a
pronoun (“he”), or a noun (“the boy”), or a person (“Mrs. Scott”) to put them in
motion. Many verbs also carry in their imagery or in their sound a suggestion of
what  they  mean:  glitter,  dazzle,  twirl,  beguile,  scatter,  swagger,  poke,  pamper,
vex. Probably no other language has such a vast supply of verbs so bright with
color.  Don’t  choose  one  that  is  dull  or  merely  serviceable.  Make  active  verbs
activate your sentences, and avoid the kind that need an appended preposition
to  complete  their  work.  Don’t  set  up  a  business  that  you  can  start  or  launch.
Don’t say that the president of the company stepped down. Did he resign? Did
he retire? Did he get fired? Be precise. Use precise verbs.

If  you  want  to  see  how  active  verbs  give  vitality  to  the  written  word,  don’t
just  go  back  to  Hemingway  or  Thurber  or  Thoreau.  I  commend  the  King  James
Bible and William Shakespeare.

ADVERBS.

Most adverbs are unnecessary. You will clutter your sentence and annoy the
reader if you choose a verb that has a specific meaning and then add an adverb
that carries the same meaning. Don’t tell us that the radio blared loudly; “blare”
connotes loudness. Don’t write that someone clenched his teeth tightly; there’s
no other way to clench teeth. Again and again in careless writing, strong verbs
are  weakened  by  redundant  adverbs.  So  are  adjectives  and  other  parts  of
speech: “effortlessly easy,” “slightly spartan,” “totally flabbergasted.” The beauty
of “flabbergasted” is that it implies an astonishment that is total; I can’t picture
someone  being  partly  flabbergasted.  If  an  action  is  so  easy  as  to  be  effortless,
use “effortless.” And what is “slightly spartan”? Perhaps a monk’s cell with wall-
to-wall carpeting. Don’t use adverbs unless they do necessary work. Spare us the
news that the winning athlete grinned widely.

And while we’re at it, let’s retire “decidedly” and all its slippery cousins. Every
day I see in the paper that some situations are decidedly better and others are
decidedly worse, but I never know how decided the improvement is, or who did
the deciding, just as I never know how eminent a result is that’s eminently fair,
or whether to believe a fact that’s arguably true. “He’s arguably the best pitcher
on the Mets,” the preening sportswriter writes, aspiring to Parnassus, which Red
Smith  reached  by  never  using  words  like  “arguably.”  Is  the  pitcher—it  can  be
proved  by  argument—the  best  pitcher  on  the  team?  If  so,  please  omit
“arguably.”  Or  is  he  perhaps—the  opinion  is  open  to  argument—the  best
pitcher? Admittedly I don’t know. It’s virtually a toss-up.

ADJECTIVES.

Most  adjectives  are  also  unnecessary.  Like  adverbs,  they  are  sprinkled  into
sentences by writers who don’t stop to think that the concept is already in the
noun. This kind of prose is littered with precipitous cliffs and lacy spiderwebs, or
with adjectives denoting the color of an object whose color is well known: yellow
daffodils  and  brownish  dirt.  If  you  want  to  make  a  value  judgment  about
daffodils,  choose  an  adjective  like  “garish.”  If  you’re  in  a  part  of  the  country
where the dirt is red, feel free to mention the red dirt. Those adjectives would do
a job that the noun alone wouldn’t be doing.

Most writers sow adjectives almost unconsciously into the soil of their prose
to make it more lush and pretty, and the sentences become longer and longer as
they  fill  up  with  stately  elms  and  frisky  kittens  and  hard-bitten  detectives  and
sleepy  lagoons.  This  is  adjective-by-habit—a  habit  you  should  get  rid  of.  Not
every  oak  has  to  be  gnarled.  The  adjective  that  exists  solely  as  decoration  is  a

self-indulgence for the writer and a burden for the reader.

Again,  the  rule  is  simple:  make  your  adjectives  do  work  that  needs  to  be
done. “He looked at the gray sky and the black clouds and decided to sail back to
the  harbor.”  The  darkness  of  the  sky  and  the  clouds  is  the  reason  for  the
decision. If it’s important to tell the reader that a house was drab or a girl was
beautiful,  by  all  means  use  “drab”  and  “beautiful.”  They  will  have  their  proper
power because you have learned to use adjectives sparsely.

LITTLE QUALIFIERS.

Prune out the small words that qualify how you feel and how you think and
what  you  saw:  “a  bit,”  “a  little,”  “sort  of,”  “kind  of,”  “rather,”  “quite,”  “very,”
“too,” “pretty much,” “in a sense” and dozens more. They dilute your style and
your persuasiveness.

Don’t say you were a bit confused and sort of tired and a little depressed and
somewhat  annoyed.  Be  confused.  Be  tired.  Be  depressed.  Be  annoyed.  Don’t
hedge your prose with little timidities. Good writing is lean and confident.

Don’t say you weren’t too happy because the hotel was pretty expensive. Say
you weren’t happy because the hotel was expensive. Don’t tell us you were quite
fortunate. How fortunate is that? Don’t describe an event as rather spectacular
or  very  awesome.  Words  like  “spectacular”  and  “awesome”  don’t  submit  to
measurement. “Very” is a useful word to achieve emphasis, but far more often
it’s  clutter.  There’s  no  need  to  call  someone  very  methodical.  Either  he  is
methodical or he isn’t.

The large point is one of authority. Every little qualifier whittles away some
fraction of the reader’s trust. Readers want a writer who believes in himself and
in what he is saying. Don’t diminish that belief. Don’t be kind of bold. Be bold.

PUNCTUATION.

These are brief thoughts on punctuation, in no way intended as a primer. If
you don’t know how to punctuate—and many college students still don’t—get a
grammar book.

The Period. There’s not much to be said about the period except that most
writers don’t reach it soon enough. If you find yourself hopelessly mired in a long
sentence, it’s probably because you’re trying to make the sentence do more than
it can reasonably do—perhaps express two dissimilar thoughts. The quickest way
out is to break the long sentence into two short sentences, or even three. There
is  no  minimum  length  for  a  sentence  that’s  acceptable  in  the  eyes  of  God.
Among good writers it is the short sentence that predominates, and don’t tell me
about Norman Mailer—he’s a genius. If you want to write long sentences, be a
genius. Or at least make sure that the sentence is under control from beginning
to end, in syntax and punctuation, so that the reader knows where he is at every

step of the winding trail.

The  Exclamation  Point.  Don’t  use  it  unless  you  must  to  achieve  a  certain
effect.  It  has  a  gushy  aura,  the  breathless  excitement  of  a  debutante
commenting on an event that was exciting only to her: “Daddy says I must have
had  too  much  champagne!”  “But  honestly,  I  could  have  danced  all  night!”  We
have  all  suffered  more  than  our  share  of  these  sentences  in  which  an
exclamation  point  knocks  us  over  the  head  with  how  cute  or  wonderful
something was. Instead, construct your sentence so that the order of the words
will put the emphasis where you want it. Also resist using an exclamation point
to notify the reader that you are making a joke or being ironic. “It never occurred
to  me  that  the  water  pistol  might  be  loaded!”  Readers  are  annoyed  by  your
reminder that this was a comical moment. They are also robbed of the pleasure
of finding it funny on their own. Humor is best achieved by understatement, and
there’s nothing subtle about an exclamation point.

The  Semicolon.  There  is  a  19th-century  mustiness  that  hangs  over  the
semicolon. We associate it with  the carefully balanced sentences, the judicious
weighing  of  “on  the  one  hand”  and  “on  the  other  hand,”  of  Conrad  and
Thackeray and Hardy. Therefore it should be used sparingly by modern writers of
nonfiction. Yet I notice that it turns up quite often in the passages I’ve quoted in
this book and that I use it often myself—usually to add a related thought to the
first half of a sentence. Still, the semicolon brings the reader, if not to a halt, at
least  to  a  pause.  So  use  it  with  discretion,  remembering  that  it  will  slow  to  a
Victorian  pace  the  early-21st-century  momentum  you’re  striving  for,  and  rely
instead on the period and the dash.

The  Dash.  Somehow  this  invaluable  tool  is  widely  regarded  as  not  quite
proper—a  bumpkin  at  the  genteel  dinner  table  of  good  English.  But  it  has  full
membership and will get you out of many tight corners. The dash is used in two
ways. One is to amplify  or justify in the second  part of the sentence a thought
you  stated  in  the  first  part.  “We  decided  to  keep  going—it  was  only  100  miles
more  and  we  could  get  there  in  time  for  dinner.”  By  its  very  shape  the  dash
pushes  the  sentence  ahead  and  explains  why  they  decided  to  keep  going.  The
other use involves two dashes, which set apart a parenthetical thought within a
longer  sentence.  “She  told  me  to  get  in  the  car—she  had  been  after  me  all
summer  to  have  a  haircut—and  we  drove  silently  into  town.”  An  explanatory
detail  that  might  otherwise  have  required  a  separate  sentence  is  neatly
dispatched along the way.

The  Colon.  The  colon  has  begun  to  look  even  more  antique  than  the
semicolon,  and  many  of  its  functions  have  been  taken  over  by  the  dash.  But  it
still serves well its pure role of bringing your sentence to a brief halt before you
plunge into, say, an itemized list. “The brochure said the ship would stop at the

following ports: Oran, Algiers, Naples, Brindisi, Piraeus, Istanbul and Beirut.” You
can’t beat the colon for work like that.

MOOD CHANGERS.

Learn to alert the reader as soon as possible to any change in mood from the
previous sentence. At least a dozen words will do this job for you: “but,” “yet,”
“however,”  “nevertheless,”  “still,”  “instead,”  “thus,”  “therefore,”  “meanwhile,”
“now,” “later,” “today,” “subsequently” and several more. I can’t overstate how
much easier it is for readers to process a sentence if you start with “but” when
you’re shifting direction. Or, conversely, how much harder it is if they must wait
until the end to realize that you have shifted.

Many of us were taught that no sentence should begin with “but.” If that’s
what you learned, unlearn it—there’s no stronger word at the start. It announces
total contrast with what has gone before, and the reader is thereby primed for
the  change.  If  you  need  relief  from  too  many  sentences  beginning  with  “but,”
switch  to  “however.”  It  is,  however,  a  weaker  word  and  needs  careful
placement.  Don’t  start  a  sentence  with  “however”—it  hangs  there  like  a  wet
dishrag. And don’t end with “however”—by that time it has lost its howeverness.
Put it as early as you reasonably can, as I did three sentences ago. Its abruptness
then becomes a virtue.

“Yet”  does  almost  the  same  job  as  “but,”  though  its  meaning  is  closer  to
“nevertheless.”  Either  of  those  words  at  the  beginning  of  a  sentence—“Yet  he
decided  to  go”  or  “Nevertheless  he  decided  to  go”—can  replace  a  whole  long
phrase  that  summarizes  what  the  reader  has  just  been  told:  “Despite  the  fact
that all these dangers had been pointed out to him, he decided to go.” Look for
all  the  places  where  one  of  these  short  words  will  instantly  convey  the  same
meaning  as  a  long  and  dismal  clause.  “Instead  I  took  the  train.”  “Still  I  had  to
admire  him.”  “Thus  I  learned  how  to  smoke.”  “It  was  therefore  easy  to  meet
him.”  “Meanwhile  I  had  talked  to  John.”  What  a  vast  amount  of  huffing  and
puffing these pivotal words save! (The exclamation point is to show that I really
mean it.)

As  for  “meanwhile,”  “now,”  “today”  and  “later,”  what  they  also  save  is
confusion,  for  careless  writers  often  change  their  time  frame  without
remembering to tip the reader off. “Now I know better.” “Today you can’t find
such  an  item.”  “Later  I  found  out  why.”  Always  make  sure  your  readers  are
oriented. Always ask yourself where you left them in the previous sentence.

CONTRACTIONS.

Your  style  will  be  warmer  and  truer  to  your  personality  if  you  use
contractions  like  “I’ll”  and  “won’t”  and  “can’t”  when  they  fit  comfortably  into
what you’re writing. “I’ll be glad to see them if they don’t get mad” is less stiff
than “I will be glad to see them if they do not get mad.” (Read that aloud and

hear how stilted it sounds.) There’s no rule against such informality—trust your
ear  and  your  instincts.  I  only  suggest  avoiding  one  form—“I’d,”  “he’d,”  “we’d,”
etc.—because  “I’d”  can  mean  both  “I  had”  and  “I  would,”  and  readers  can  get
well into a sentence before learning which meaning it is. Often it’s not the one
they  thought  it  was.  Also,  don’t  invent  contractions  like  “could’ve.”  They
cheapen your style. Stick with the ones you can find in the dictionary.

THAT AND WHICH.

Anyone who tries to explain “that” and “which” in less than an hour is asking
for trouble. Fowler, in his Modern English Usage, takes 25 columns of type. I’m
going for two minutes, perhaps the world record. Here (I hope) is much of what
you need to bear in mind:

Always  use  “that”  unless  it  makes  your  meaning  ambiguous.  Notice  that  in
carefully  edited  magazines,  such  as  The  New  Yorker,  “that”  is  by  far  the
predominant usage. I mention this because it is still widely believed—a residue
from school and college—that “which” is more correct, more acceptable, more
literary.  It’s  not.  In  most  situations,  “that”  is  what  you  would  naturally  say  and
therefore what you should write.

If your sentence needs a comma to achieve its precise meaning, it probably
needs  “which.”  “Which”  serves  a  particular  identifying  function,  different  from
“that.”  (A)  “Take  the  shoes  that  are  in  the  closet.”  This  means:  take  the  shoes
that are in the closet, not the ones under the bed. (B) “Take the shoes, which are
in the closet.” Only one pair of shoes is under discussion; the “which” usage tells
you where they are. Note that the comma is necessary in B, but not in A.

A high proportion of “which” usages narrowly describe, or identify, or locate,

or explain, or otherwise qualify the phrase that preceded the comma:

The house, which has a red roof,
The store, which is called Bob’s Hardware,
The Rhine, which is in Germany,
The monsoon, which is a seasonal wind,
The moon, which I saw from the porch,

That’s all I’m going to say that I think you initially need to know to write good

nonfiction, which is a form that requires exact marshaling of information.

CONCEPT NOUNS.

Nouns that express a concept are commonly used in bad writing instead of

verbs that tell what somebody did. Here are three typical dead sentences:

The common reaction is incredulous laughter.

Bemused cynicism isn’t the only response to the old system.
The current campus hostility is a symptom of the change.

What is so eerie about these sentences is that they have no people in them.
They also have no working verbs—only “is” or “isn’t.” The reader can’t visualize
anybody performing some activity; all the meaning lies in impersonal nouns that
embody  a  vague  concept:  “reaction,”  “cynicism,”  “response,”  “hostility.”  Turn
these cold sentences around. Get people doing things:

Most people just laugh with disbelief.
Some people respond to the old system by turning cynical; others say …
It’s  easy  to  notice  the  change—you  can  see  how  angry  all  the  students

are.

My revised sentences aren’t jumping with vigor, partly because the material
I’m  trying  to  knead  into  shape  is  shapeless  dough.  But  at  least  they  have  real
people  and  real  verbs.  Don’t  get  caught  holding  a  bag  full  of  abstract  nouns.
You’ll sink to the bottom of the lake and never be seen again.

CREEPING NOUNISM.

This  is  a  new  American  disease  that  strings  two  or  three  nouns  together
where one noun—or, better yet, one verb—will do. Nobody goes broke now; we
have money problem areas. It no longer rains; we have precipitation activity or a
thunderstorm probability situation. Please, let it rain.

Today as many as four or five concept nouns will attach themselves to each
other,  like  a  molecule  chain.  Here’s  a  brilliant  specimen  I  recently  found:
“Communication  facilitation  skills  development  intervention.”  Not  a  person  in
sight, or a working verb. I think it’s a program to help students write better.

OVERSTATEMENT.

“The living room looked as if an atomic bomb had gone off there,” writes the
novice writer, describing what he saw on Sunday morning after a party that got
out of hand. Well, we all know he’s exaggerating to make a droll point, but we
also  know  that  an  atomic  bomb  didn’t  go  off  there,  or  any  other  bomb  except
maybe a water bomb. “I felt as if ten 747 jets were flying through my brain,” he
writes, “and I seriously considered jumping out the window and killing myself.”
These verbal high jinks can get just so high—and this writer is already well over
the  limit—before  the  reader  feels  an  overpowering  drowsiness.  It’s  like  being
trapped with a man who can’t stop reciting limericks. Don’t overstate. You didn’t
really  consider  jumping  out  the  window.  Life  has  more  than  enough  truly
horrible funny situations. Let the humor sneak up so we hardly hear it coming.

CREDIBILITY.

Credibility  is  just  as  fragile  for  a  writer  as  for  a  President.  Don’t  inflate  an
incident  to  make  it  more  outlandish  than  it  actually  was.  If  the  reader  catches
you  in  just  one  bogus  statement  that  you  are  trying  to  pass  off  as  true,
everything  you  write  thereafter  will  be  suspect.  It’s  too  great  a  risk,  and  not
worth taking.

DICTATION.

Much of the “writing” done in America is done by dictation. Administrators,
executives, managers, educators and other officials think in terms of using their
time efficiently. They think the quickest way of getting something “written” is to
dictate it to a secretary and never look at it. This is false economy—they save a
few  hours  and  blow  their  whole  personality.  Dictated  sentences  tend  to  be
pompous,  sloppy  and  redundant.  Executives  who  are  so  busy  that  they  can’t
avoid dictating should at least find time to edit what they have dictated, crossing
words out and putting words in, making sure that what they finally write is a true
reflection of who they are, especially if it’s a document that will go to customers
who will judge their personality and their company on the basis of their style.

WRITING IS NOT A CONTEST.

Every  writer  is  starting  from  a  different  point  and  is  bound  for  a  different
destination.  Yet  many  writers  are  paralyzed  by  the  thought  that  they  are
competing  with  everybody  else  who  is  trying  to  write  and  presumably  doing  it
better.  This  can  often  happen  in  a  writing  class.  Inexperienced  students  are
chilled  to  find  themselves  in  the  same  class  with  students  whose  byline  has
appeared in the college newspaper. But writing for the college paper is no great
credential; I’ve often found that the hares who write for the paper are overtaken
by the tortoises who move studiously toward the goal of mastering the craft. The
same  fear  hobbles  freelance  writers,  who  see  the  work  of  other  writers
appearing in magazines while their own keeps returning in the mail. Forget the
competition and go at your own pace. Your only contest is with yourself.

THE SUBCONSCIOUS MIND.

Your subconscious mind does more writing than you think. Often you’ll spend
a  whole  day  trying  to  fight  your  way  out  of  some  verbal  thicket  in  which  you
seem to be tangled beyond salvation. Frequently a solution will occur to you the
next  morning  when  you  plunge  back  in.  While  you  slept,  your  writer’s  mind
didn’t. A writer is always working. Stay alert to the currents around you. Much of
what you see and hear will come back, having percolated for days or months or
even  years  through  your  subconscious  mind,  just  when  your  conscious  mind,
laboring to write, needs it.

THE QUICKEST FIX.

Surprisingly  often  a  difficult  problem  in  a  sentence  can  be  solved  by  simply
getting rid of it. Unfortunately, this solution is usually the last one that occurs to
writers in a jam. First they will put the troublesome phrase through all kinds of
exertions—moving  it  to  some  other  part  of  the  sentence,  trying  to  rephrase  it,
adding new words to clarify the thought or to oil whatever is stuck. These efforts
only make the situation worse, and the writer is left to conclude that there is no
solution  to  the  problem—not  a  comforting  thought.  When  you  find  yourself  at
such an impasse, look at the troublesome element and ask, “Do I need it at all?”
Probably you don’t. It was trying to do an unnecessary job all along—that’s why
it  was  giving  you  so  much  grief.  Remove  it  and  watch  the  afflicted  sentence
spring to life and breathe normally. It’s the quickest cure and often the best.

PARAGRAPHS.

Keep your paragraphs short. Writing is visual—it catches the eye before it has
a chance to catch the brain. Short paragraphs put air around what you write and
make it look inviting, whereas a long chunk of type can discourage a reader from
even starting to read.

Newspaper  paragraphs  should  be  only  two  or  three  sentences  long;
newspaper type is set in a narrow width, and the inches quickly add up. You may
think  such  frequent  paragraphing  will  damage  the  development  of  your  point.
Obviously  The  New  Yorker  is  obsessed  by  this  fear—a  reader  can  go  for  miles
without relief. Don’t worry; the gains far outweigh the hazards.

But  don’t  go  berserk.  A  succession  of  tiny  paragraphs  is  as  annoying  as  a
paragraph that’s too long. I’m thinking of all those midget paragraphs—verbless
wonders—written  by  modern  journalists  to  make  their  articles  quick  ’n’  easy.
Actually  they  make  the  reader’s  job  harder  by  chopping  up  a  natural  train  of
thought.  Compare  the  following  two  arrangements  of  the  same  article—how
they look at a glance and how they read:

The Associated Press version (left), with its breezy paragraphing and verbless
third  and  fourth  sentences,  is  disruptive  and  condescending.  “Yoo-hoo!  Look
how  simple  I’m  making  this  for  you!”  the  reporter  is  calling  to  us.  My  version
(right)  gives  the  reporter  the  dignity  of  writing  good  English  and  building  three
sentences into a logical unit.

Paragraphing is a subtle but important element in writing nonfiction articles
and books—a road map constantly telling your reader how you have organized
your ideas. Study good nonfiction writers to see how they do it. You’ll find that
almost  all  of  them  think  in  paragraph  units,  not  in  sentence  units.  Each
paragraph has its own integrity of content and structure.

SEXISM.

One of the most vexing new questions for writers is what to do about sexist
language,  especially  the  “he-she”  pronoun.  The  feminist  movement  helpfully
revealed how much sexism lurks in our language, not only in the offensive “he”
but in the hundreds of words that carry an invidious meaning or some overtone
of  judgment.  They  are  words  that  patronize  (“gal”),  or  that  imply  second-class
status  (“poetess”),  or  a  second-class  role  (“housewife”),  or  a  certain  kind  of
empty-headedness (“the girls”), or that demean the ability of a woman to do a
certain kind of job (“lady lawyer”), or that are deliberately prurient (“divorcée,”
“coed,”  “blonde”)  and  are  seldom  applied  to  men.  Men  get  mugged;  a  woman
who gets mugged is a shapely stewardess or a pert brunette.

More  damaging—and  more  subtle—are  all  the  usages  that  treat  women  as
possessions of the family male, not as people with their own identity who played
an equal part in the family saga: “Early settlers pushed west with their wives and
children.” Turn those settlers into pioneer families, or pioneer couples who went
west with their sons and daughters, or men and women who settled the West.
Today  there  are  very  few  roles  that  aren’t  open  to  both  sexes.  Don’t  use

constructions  that  suggest  that  only  men  can  be  settlers  or  farmers  or  cops  or
firefighters.

A  thornier  problem  is  raised  by  the  feminists’  annoyance  with  words  that
contain “man,” such as “chairman” and “spokesman.” Their point is that women
can chair a committee as well as a man and are equally good at spoking. Hence
the flurry of new words like “chairperson” and “spokeswoman.” Those makeshift
words from the 1960s raised our consciousness about sex discrimination, both in
words  and  in  attitudes.  But  in  the  end  they  are  makeshift  words,  sometimes
hurting  the  cause  more  than  helping  it.  One  solution  is  to  find  another  term:
“chair” for “chairman,” “company representative” for “spokesman.” You can also
convert  the  noun  into  a  verb:  “Speaking  for  the  company,  Ms.  Jones  said  …”
Where a certain occupation has both a masculine and a feminine form, look for a
generic substitute. Actors and actresses can become performers.

This  still  leaves  the  bothersome  pronoun.  “He”  and  “him”  and  “his”  are
words that rankle. “Every employee should decide what he thinks is best for him
and his dependents.” What are we to do about these countless sentences? One
solution is to turn them into the plural: “All employees should decide what they
think is best for them and their dependents.” But this is good only in small doses.
A style that converts every “he” into a “they” will quickly turn to mush.

Another  common  solution  is  to  use  “or”:  “Every  employee  should  decide
what  he  or  she  thinks  is  best  for  him  or  her.”  But  again,  it  should  be  used
sparingly. Often a writer will find several situations in an article where he or she
can use “he or she,” or “him or her,” if it seems natural. By “natural” I mean that
the writer is serving notice that he (or she) has the problem in mind and is trying
his (or her) best within reasonable limits. But let’s face it: the English language is
stuck with the generic masculine (“Man shall not live by bread alone”). To turn
every “he” into a “he or she,” and every “his” into a “his or her,” would clog the
language.

In  early  editions  of  On  Writing  Well  I  used  “he”  and  “him”  to  refer  to  “the
reader,” “the writer,” “the critic,” “the humorist,” etc. I felt that the book would
be  harder  to  read  if  I  used  “he  or  she”  with  every  such  mention.  (I  reject
“he/she”  altogether;  the  slant  has  no  place  in  good  English.)  Over  the  years,
however, many women wrote to nudge me about this. They said that as writers
and readers themselves they resent always having to visualize a man doing the
writing  and  reading,  and  they’re  right;  I  stand  nudged.  Most  of  the  nudgers
urged me to adopt the plural: to use “readers” and “writers,” followed thereafter
by “they.” I don’t like plurals; they weaken writing because they are less specific
than  the  singular,  less  easy  to  visualize.  I’d  like  every  writer  to  visualize  one
reader struggling to read what he or she has written. Nevertheless I found three
or four hundred places where I could eliminate “he,” “him,” “his,” “himself” or
“man,” mainly by switching to the plural, with no harm done; the sky didn’t fall
in. Where the male pronoun remains in this edition I felt it was the only solution
that wasn’t cumbersome.

The  best  solutions  simply  eliminate  “he”  and  its  connotations  of  male
ownership by using other pronouns or by altering some other component of the
sentence.  “We”  is  a  handy  replacement  for  “he.”  “Our”  and  “the”  can  often
replace “his.” (A) “First he notices what’s happening to his kids and he blames it
on his neighborhood.” (B) “First we notice what’s happening to our kids and we
blame  it  on  the  neighborhood.”  General  nouns  can  replace  specific  nouns.  (A)
“Doctors often neglect their wives and children.” (B) “Doctors often neglect their
families.” Countless sins can be erased by such small changes.

One  other  pronoun  that  helped  me  in  my  repairs  was  “you.”  Instead  of
talking about what “the writer” does and the trouble he gets into, I found more
places where I could address the writer directly (“You’ll often find …”). It doesn’t
work  for  every  kind  of  writing,  but  it’s  a  godsend  to  anyone  writing  an
instructional  book  or  a  self-help  book.  The  voice  of  a  Dr.  Spock  talking  to  the
mother  of  a  child  with  a  fever,  or  the  voice  of  a  Julia  Child  talking  to  the  cook
stalled  in  mid-recipe,  is  one  of  the  most  reassuring  sounds  a  reader  can  hear.
Always  look  for  ways  to  make  yourself  available  to  the  people  you’re  trying  to
reach.

REWRITING.

Rewriting is the essence of writing well: it’s where the game is won or lost.
That idea is hard to accept. We all have an emotional equity in our first draft; we
can’t believe that it wasn’t born perfect. But the odds are close to 100 percent
that it wasn’t. Most writers don’t initially say what they want to say, or say it as
well  as  they  could.  The  newly  hatched  sentence  almost  always  has  something
wrong  with  it.  It’s  not  clear.  It’s  not  logical.  It’s  verbose.  It’s  klunky.  It’s
pretentious. It’s boring. It’s full of clutter. It’s full of clichés. It lacks rhythm. It can
be read in several different ways. It doesn’t lead out of the previous sentence. It
doesn’t … The point is that clear writing is the result of a lot of tinkering.

Many  people  assume  that  professional  writers  don’t  need  to  rewrite;  the
words just fall into place. On the contrary, careful writers can’t stop fiddling. I’ve
never thought of rewriting as an unfair burden; I’m grateful for every chance to
keep  improving  my  work.  Writing  is  like  a  good  watch—it  should  run  smoothly
and have no extra parts. Students don’t share my love of rewriting. They think of
it  as  punishment:  extra  homework  or  extra  infield  practice.  Please—if  you’re
such a student—think of it as a gift. You won’t write well until you understand
that writing is an evolving process, not a finished product. Nobody expects you to
get it right the first time, or even the second time.

What  do  I  mean  by  “rewriting”?  I  don’t  mean  writing  one  draft  and  then
writing  a  different  second  version,  and  then  a  third.  Most  rewriting  consists  of
reshaping  and  tightening  and  refining  the  raw  material  you  wrote  on  your  first
try. Much of it consists of making sure you’ve given the reader a narrative flow
he can follow with no trouble from beginning to end. Keep putting yourself in the
reader’s place. Is there something he should have been told early in the sentence

that you put near the end? Does he know when he starts sentence B that you’ve
made a shift—of subject, tense, tone, emphasis—from sentence A?

Let’s look at a typical paragraph and imagine that it’s the writer’s first draft.
There’s nothing really wrong with it; it’s clear and it’s grammatical. But it’s full of
ragged  edges:  failures  of  the  writer  to  keep  the  reader  notified  of  changes  in
time, place and mood, or to vary and animate the style. What I’ve done is to add,
in bracketed italics after each sentence, some of the thoughts that might occur
to  an  editor  taking  a  first  look  at  this  draft.  After  that  you’ll  find  my  revised
paragraph, which incorporates those corrective thoughts.

There  used  to  be  a  time  when  neighbors  took  care  of  one  another,  he
remembered.  [Put  “he  remembered”  first  to  establish  reflective  tone.]  It  no
longer  seemed  to  happen  that  way,  however.  [The  contrast  supplied  by
“however” must come first. Start  with “But.” Also establish America locale.]
He wondered if it was because everyone in the modern world was so busy.
[All these sentences are the same length and have the same soporific rhythm;
turn this one into a question?] It occurred to him that people today have so
many  things  to  do  that  they  don’t  have  time  for  old-fashioned  friendship.
[Sentence  essentially  repeats  previous  sentence;  kill  it  or  warm  it  up  with
specific  detail.]  Things  didn’t  work  that  way  in  America  in  previous  eras.
[Reader is still in the present; reverse the sentence to tell him he’s now in the
past. “America” no longer needed if inserted earlier.] And he knew that the
situation was very different in other countries, as he recalled from the years
when he lived in villages in Spain and Italy. [Reader is still in America. Use a
negative  transition  word  to  get  him  to  Europe.  Sentence  is  also  too  flabby.
Break  it  into  two  sentences?]  It  almost  seemed  to  him  that  as  people  got
richer and built their houses farther apart they isolated themselves from the
essentials  of  life.  [Irony  deferred  too  long.  Plant  irony  early.  Sharpen  the
paradox about richness.] And there was another thought that troubled him.
[This is the real point of the paragraph; signal the reader that it’s important.
Avoid weak “there was” construction.] His friends had deserted him when he
needed them most during his recent illness. [Reshape to end with “most”; the
last word is the one that stays in the reader’s ear and gives the sentence its
punch. Hold sickness for next sentence; it’s a separate thought.] It was almost
as if they found him guilty of doing something shameful. [Introduce sickness
here  as  the  reason  for  the  shame.  Omit  “guilty”;  it’s  implicit.]  He  recalled
reading somewhere about societies in primitive parts of the world in which
sick people were shunned, though he had never heard of any such ritual in
America.  [Sentence  starts  slowly  and  stays  sluggish  and  dull.  Break  it  into
shorter units. Snap off the ironic point.]

He  remembered  that  neighbors  used  to  take  care  of  one  another.  But
that no longer seemed to happen in America. Was it because everyone was

so  busy?  Were  people  really  so  preoccupied  with  their  television  sets  and
their cars and their fitness programs that they had no time for friendship? In
previous eras that was never true. Nor was it how families lived in other parts
of  the  world.  Even  in  the  poorest  villages  of  Spain  and  Italy,  he  recalled,
people  would  drop  in  with  a  loaf  of  bread.  An  ironic  idea  struck  him:  as
people got richer they cut themselves off from the richness of life. But what
really  troubled  him  was  an  even  more  shocking  fact.  The  time  when  his
friends  deserted  him  was  the  time  when  he  needed  them  most.  By  getting
sick  he  almost  seemed  to  have  done  something  shameful.  He  knew  that
other societies had a custom of “shunning” people who were very ill. But that
ritual only existed in primitive cultures. Or did it?

My  revisions  aren’t  the  best  ones  that  could  be  made,  or  the  only  ones.
They’re mainly matters of carpentry: altering the sequence, tightening the flow,
sharpening the point. Much could still be done in such areas as cadence, detail
and freshness of language. The total construction is equally important. Read your
article  aloud  from  beginning  to  end,  always  remembering  where  you  left  the
reader in the previous sentence. You might find you had written two sentences
like this:

The tragic hero of the play is Othello. Small and malevolent, Iago feeds his

jealous suspicions.

In itself there’s nothing wrong with the Iago sentence. But as a sequel to the
previous  sentence  it’s  very  wrong.  The  name  lingering  in  the  reader’s  ear  is
Othello; the reader naturally assumes that Othello is small and malevolent.

When you read your writing aloud with these connecting links in mind you’ll
hear a dismaying number of places where you lost the reader, or confused the
reader,  or  failed  to  tell  him  the  one  fact  he  needed  to  know,  or  told  him  the
same thing twice: the inevitable loose ends of every early draft. What you must
do  is  make  an  arrangement—one  that  holds  together  from  start  to  finish  and
that moves with economy and warmth.

Learn to enjoy this tidying process. I don’t like to write; I like to have written.
But I love to rewrite. I especially like to cut: to press the DELETE key and see an
unnecessary  word  or  phrase  or  sentence  vanish  into  the  electricity.  I  like  to
replace  a  humdrum  word  with  one  that  has  more  precision  or  color.  I  like  to
strengthen the transition between one sentence and another. I like to rephrase a
drab sentence to give it a more pleasing rhythm or a more graceful musical line.
With every small refinement I feel that I’m coming nearer to where I would like
to arrive, and when I finally get there I know it was the rewriting, not the writing,
that won the game.

WRITING ON A COMPUTER.

The computer is God’s gift, or technology’s gift, to rewriting and reorganizing.
It puts your words right in front of your eyes for your instant consideration—and
reconsideration; you can play with your sentences until you get them right. The
paragraphs  and  pages  will  keep  rearranging  themselves,  no  matter  how  much
you cut and change, and then your printer will type everything neatly while you
go  and  have  a  beer.  Sweeter  music  could  hardly  be  sung  to  writers  than  the
sound of their article being retyped with all its improvements—but not by them.
It’s no longer necessary for this book to explain, as earlier editions did, how
to operate the wonderful new machine called a word processor that had come
into  our  lives  and  how  to  put  its  wonders  to  use  in  writing,  rewriting,  and
organizing. That’s now common knowledge. I’ll just remind you (if you’re still not
a believer) that the savings in time and drudgery are enormous. With a computer
I sit down to write more willingly than I did when I used a typewriter, especially if
I’m facing a complex task of organization, and I finish the task sooner and with
far  less  fatigue.  These  are  crucial  gains  for  a  writer:  time,  output,  energy,
enjoyment and control.

TRUST YOUR MATERIAL.

The  longer  I  work  at  the  craft  of  writing,  the  more  I  realize  that  there’s
nothing more interesting than the truth. What people do—and what people say
—continues to take me by surprise with its wonderfulness, or its quirkiness, or its
drama, or its humor, or its pain. Who could invent all the astonishing things that
really  happen?  I  increasingly  find  myself  saying  to  writers  and  students,  “Trust
your material.” It seems to be hard advice to follow.

Recently  I  spent  some  time  as  a  writing  coach  at  a  newspaper  in  a  small
American city. I noticed that many reporters had fallen into the habit of trying to
make the news more palatable by writing in a feature style. Their leads consisted
of a series of snippets that went something like this:

Whoosh!
It was incredible.
Ed Barnes wondered if he was seeing things.
Or maybe it was just spring fever. Funny how April can do that to a guy.
It wasn’t as if he hadn’t checked his car before leaving the house.
But then again, he didn’t remember to tell Linda.
Which was odd, because he always remembered to tell Linda. Ever since

they started going together back in junior high.

Was that really 20 years ago?
And now there was also little Scooter to worry about.
Come to think of it, the dog was acting kind of suspicious.

The articles often began on page 1, and I would read as far as “Continued on
page 9” and still have no idea of what they were about. Then I would dutifully
turn to page 9 and find myself in an interesting story, full of specific details. I’d
say to the reporter, “That was a good story when I finally got over here to page
9. Why didn’t you put that stuff in the lead?” The reporter would say, “Well, in
the  lead  I  was  writing  color.”  The  assumption  is  that  fact  and  color  are  two
separate  ingredients.  They’re  not;  color  is  organic  to  the  fact.  Your  job  is  to
present the colorful fact.

In  1988  I  wrote  a  baseball  book  called  Spring  Training.  It  combined  my
lifelong vocation with my lifelong addiction—which is one of the best things that
can happen to a writer; people will write better and with more enjoyment if they
write about what they care about. I chose spring training as my small corner of
the large subject of baseball because it’s a time of renewal, both for the players
and  for  the  fans.  The  game  is  given  back  to  us  in  its  original  purity:  it’s  played
outside, in the sun, on grass, without organ music, by young men who are almost
near enough to touch and whose salaries and grievances are mercifully put aside
for  six  weeks.  Above  all,  it’s  a  time  of  teaching  and  learning.  I  chose  the
Pittsburgh Pirates as the team I would cover because they trained in an old-time
ballpark  in  Bradenton,  Florida,  and  were  a  young  club  just  starting  to  rebuild,
with a manager, Jim Leyland, who was committed to teaching.

I  didn’t  want  to  romanticize  the  game.  I  don’t  like  baseball  movies  that  go
into  slow  motion  when  the  batter  hits  a  home  run,  to  notify  me  that  it’s  a
pregnant  moment.  I  know  that  about  home  runs,  especially  if  they’re  hit  with
two  out  in  the  bottom  of  the  ninth  to  win  the  game.  I  resolved  not  to  let  my
writing  go  into  slow  motion—not  to  nudge  the  reader  with  significance—or  to
claim  baseball  as  a  metaphor  for  life,  death,  middle  age,  lost  youth  or  a  more
innocent America. My premise was that baseball is a job—honorable work—and
I wanted to know how that job gets taught and learned.

So I went to Jim Leyland and his coaches and I said, “You’re a teacher. I’m a
teacher. Tell me: How do you teach hitting? How do you teach pitching? How do
you  teach  fielding?  How  do  you  teach  baserunning?  How  do  you  keep  these
young  men  up  for  such  a  brutally  long  schedule?”  All  of  them  responded
generously and told me in detail how they do what they do. So did the players
and  all  the  other  men  and  women  who  had  information  I  wanted:  umpires,
scouts, ticket sellers, local boosters.

One day I climbed up into the stands behind home plate to look for a scout.
Spring  training  is  baseball’s  ultimate  talent  show,  and  the  camps  are  infested
with laconic men who have spent a lifetime appraising talent. I spotted an empty
seat  next  to  a  weathered  man  in  his  sixties  who  was  using  a  stopwatch  and
taking notes. When the inning was over I asked him what he was timing. He said
he was Nick Kamzic, Northern Scouting Coordinator of the California Angels, and
he was timing runners on the base paths. I asked him what kind of information
he was looking for.

“Well, it takes a right-handed batter 4.3 seconds to reach first base,” he
said,  “and  a  left-handed  batter  4.1  or  4.2  seconds.  Naturally  that  varies  a
little—you’ve got to take the human element into consideration.”

“What do those numbers tell you?” I asked.
“Well, of course the average double play takes 4.3 seconds,” he said. He
said it as if it was common knowledge. I had never given any thought to the
elapsed time of a double play.

“So that means …”
“If you see a player who gets to first base in less than 4.3 seconds you’re

interested in him.”

As a fact that’s self-sufficient. There’s no need to add a sentence pointing out
that  4.3  seconds  is  remarkably  little  time  to  execute  a  play  that  involves  one
batted ball, two thrown balls and three infielders. Given 4.3 seconds, readers can
do  their  own  marveling.  They  will  also  enjoy  being  allowed  to  think  for
themselves. The reader plays a major role in the act of writing and must be given
room  to  play  it.  Don’t  annoy  your  readers  by  over-explaining—by  telling  them
something  they  already  know  or  can  figure  out.  Try  not  to  use  words  like
“surprisingly,” “predictably” and “of course,” which put a value on a fact before
the reader encounters the fact. Trust your material.

GO WITH YOUR INTERESTS.

There’s no subject you don’t have permission to write about. Students often
avoid  subjects  close  to  their  heart—skateboarding,  cheerleading,  rock  music,
cars—because  they  assume  that  their  teachers  will  regard  those  topics  as
“stupid.” No area of life is stupid to someone who takes it seriously. If you follow
your affections you will write well and will engage your readers.

I’ve read elegant books on fishing and poker, billiards and rodeos, mountain
climbing  and  giant  sea  turtles  and  many  other  subjects  I  didn’t  think  I  was
interested  in.  Write  about  your  hobbies:  cooking,  gardening,  photography,
knitting, antiques, jogging, sailing, scuba diving, tropical birds, tropical fish. Write
about  your  work:  teaching,  nursing,  running  a  business,  running  a  store.  Write
about  a  field  you  enjoyed  in  college  and  always  meant  to  get  back  to:  history,
biography,  art,  archaeology.  No  subject  is  too  specialized  or  too  quirky  if  you
make an honest connection with it when you write about it.

Nonfiction as Literature

One weekend a few years ago I went to Buffalo to talk at a writers’ conference
that had been organized by a group of women writers in that city. The women
were serious about their craft, and the books and articles they had written were
solid and useful. They asked me if I would take part in a radio talk show earlier in
the week to publicize the conference—they would be with the host in the studio
and I would be on a telephone hookup from my apartment in New York.

The  appointed  evening  arrived,  and  my  phone  rang,  and  the  host  came  on
and  greeted  me  with  the  strenuous  joviality  of  his  trade.  He  said  he  had  three
lovely  ladies  in  the  studio  with  him  and  he  was  eager  to  find  out  what  we  all
thought  of  the  present  state  of  literature  and  what  advice  we  had  for  all  his
literary  ambitions
listeners  who  were  members  of  the
themselves. This hearty introduction dropped like a stone in our midst, and none
of  the  three  lovely  ladies  said  anything,  which  I  thought  was  the  proper
response.

literati  and  had

The silence lengthened, and finally I said, “I think we should banish all further
mention of the words ‘literature’ and ‘literary’ and ‘literati.’” I knew that the host
had  been  briefed  about  what  kind  of  writers  we  were  and  what  we  wanted  to
discuss.  But  he  had  no  other  frame  of  reference.  “Tell  me,”  he  said,  “what
insights do you all have about the literary experience in America today?” Silence
also greeted this question. Finally I said, “We’re here to talk about the craft of
writing.”

He didn’t know what to make of that, and he began to invoke the names of
authors  like  Ernest  Hemingway  and  Saul  Bellow  and  William  Styron,  whom  we
surely regarded as literary giants. We said those writers didn’t happen to be our
models, and we mentioned people like Lewis Thomas and Joan Didion and Gary
Wills. He had never heard of them. One of the women mentioned Tom Wolfe’s
The  Right  Stuff,  and  he  hadn’t  heard  of  that.  We  explained  that  these  were
writers  we  admired  for  their  ability  to  harness  the  issues  and  concerns  of  the
day.

“But  don’t  you  want  to  write  anything  literary?”  our  host  said.  The  three
women said they felt they were already doing satisfying work. That brought the

program  to  another  halt,  and  the  host  began  to  accept  phone  calls  from  his
listeners, all of whom were interested in the craft of writing and wanted to know
how  we  went  about  it.  “And  yet,  in  the  stillness  of  the  night,”  the  host  said  to
several  callers,  “don’t  you  ever  dream  of  writing  the  great  American  novel?”
They  didn’t.  They  had  no  such  dreams—in  the  stillness  of  the  night  or  at  any
other time. It was one of the all-time lousy radio talk shows.

The  story  sums  up  a  situation  that  any  practitioner  of  nonfiction  will
recognize. Those of us who are trying to write well about the world we live in, or
to teach students to write well about the world they live in, are caught in a time
warp, where literature by definition still consists of forms that were certified as
“literary” in the 19th century: novels and short stories and poems. But the great
preponderance  of  what  writers  now  write  and  sell,  what  book  and  magazine
publishers publish and what readers demand is nonfiction.

The shift can be documented by all kinds of examples. One is the history of
the  Book-of-the-Month  Club.  When  the  club  was  founded  in  1926  by  Harry
Scherman,  Americans  had  little  access  to  good  new  literature  and  were  mainly
reading  junk  like  Ben-Hur.  Scherman’s  idea  was  that  any  town  that  had  a  post
office  had  the  equivalent  of  a  bookstore,  and  he  began  sending  the  best  new
books to his newly recruited readers all over the country.

Much of what he sent was fiction. The list of main selections chosen by the
club  from  1926  through  1941  is  heavily  laced  with  novelists:  Ellen  Glasgow,
Sinclair  Lewis,  Virginia  Woolf,  John  Galsworthy,  Elinor  Wylie,  Ignazio  Silone,
Rosamond  Lehmann,  Edith  Wharton,  Somerset  Maugham,  Willa  Cather,  Booth
Tarkington, Isak Dinesen, James Gould Cozzens, Thornton Wilder, Sigrid Undset,
Ernest  Hemingway,  William  Saroyan,  John  P.  Marquand,  John  Steinbeck  and
many others. That was the high tide of “literature” in America. Members of the
Book-of-the-Month  Club  hardly  heard  the  approach  of  World  War  II.  Not  until
1940 was it brought home to them in a book, Mrs. Miniver, a stiff-upper-lip novel
about the early days of the Battle of Britain.

All  of  this  changed  with  Pearl  Harbor.  World  War  II  sent  seven  million
Americans  overseas  and  opened  their  eyes  to  reality:  to  new  places  and  issues
and events. After the war that trend was reinforced by the advent of television.
People who saw reality every evening in their living room lost patience with the
slower  rhythms  and  glancing  allusions  of  the  novelist.  Overnight,  America
became  a  fact-minded  nation.  After  1946  the  Book-of-the-Month  Club’s
members predominantly demanded—and therefore received—nonfiction.

Magazines  were  swept  along  on  the  same  tide.  The  Saturday  Evening  Post,
which had long spoon-fed its readers a heavy diet of short stories by writers who
all  seemed  to  have  three  names—Clarence  Budington  Kelland,  Octavus  Roy
Cohen—reversed  the  ratio  in  the  early  1960s.  Ninety  percent  of  the  magazine
was  now  allotted  to  nonfiction  articles,  with  just  one  short  story  by  a  three-
named author to keep the faithful from feeling abandoned. It was the beginning
of a golden era of nonfiction, especially in Life, which ran finely crafted articles

every  week;  in  The  New  Yorker,  which  elevated  the  form  by  originating  such
landmarks  of  modern  American  writing  as  Rachel  Carson’s  Silent  Spring  and
Truman  Capote’s  In  Cold  Blood;  and  in  Harper’s,  which  commissioned  such
remarkable  pieces  as  Norman  Mailer’s  Armies  of  the  Night.  Nonfiction  became
the new American literature.

Today  there’s  no  area  of  life—present  or  past—that  isn’t  being  made
accessible to ordinary readers by men and women writing with high seriousness
and  grace.  Add  to  this  literature  of  fact  all  the  disciplines  that  were  once
regarded as academic, like anthropology and economics and social history, that
have  become  the  domain  of  nonfiction  writers  and  of  broadly  curious  readers.
Add  all  the  books  combining  history  and  biography  that  have  distinguished
American  letters  in  recent  years:  David  McCullough’s  Truman  and  The  Path
Between the Seas; Robert A. Caro’s The Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall
of  New  York;  Taylor  Branch’s  Parting  the  Waters:  America  in  the  King  Years,
1954–63; Richard Kluger’s The Paper: The Life and Death of the New York Herald
Tribune;  Richard  Rhodes’s  The  Making  of  the  Atomic  Bomb;  Thomas  L.
Friedman’s  From  Beirut  to  Jerusalem;  J.  Anthony  Lukas’s  Common  Ground:  A
Turbulent Decade in the Lives of American Families;  Edmund  Morris’s  Theodore
Rex; Nicholas Lemann’s The Promised Land: The Great Black Migration and How
It Changed America; Adam Hochschild’s King Leopold’s Ghost: A Story of Greed,
Terror  and  Heroism  in  Colonial  Africa;  Ronald  Steel’s  Walter  Lippmann  and  the
American  Century;  Marion  Elizabeth  Rodgers’s  Mencken:  The  American
Iconoclast;  David  Remnick’s  Lenin’s  Tomb:  The  Last  Days  of  the  Soviet  Empire;
Andrew Delbanco’s Melville; Mark Stevens’s and Annalyn Swan’s de Kooning: An
American Master. My roster of the new literature of nonfiction, in short, would
include  all  the  writers  who  come  bearing  information  and  who  present  it  with
vigor, clarity and humanity.

I’m  not  saying  that  fiction  is  dead.  Obviously  the  novelist  can  take  us  into
places  where  no  other  writer  can  go:  into  the  deep  emotions  and  the  interior
life.  What  I’m  saying  is  that  I  have  no  patience  with  the  snobbery  that  says
nonfiction is only journalism by another name and that journalism by any name
is a dirty word. While we’re redefining literature, let’s also redefine journalism.
Journalism  is  writing  that  first  appears  in  any  periodic  journal,  whatever  its
constituency. Lewis Thomas’s first two books, Lives of a Cell and The Medusa and
the Snail, were first written as essays for the New England Journal of Medicine.
Historically,
literature.  H.  L.
Mencken,  Ring  Lardner,  Joseph  Mitchell,  Edmund  Wilson  and  dozens  of  other
major American writers were working journalists before they were canonized in
the  church  of  literature.  They  just  did  what  they  did  best  and  never  worried
about how it was defined.

in  America,  good  journalism  becomes  good

Ultimately every writer must follow the path that feels most comfortable. For
most people learning to write, that path is nonfiction. It enables them to write
about what they know or can observe or can find out. This is especially true of

young people and students. They will write far more willingly about subjects that
touch their own lives or that they have an aptitude for. Motivation is at the heart
of writing. If nonfiction is where you do your best writing, or your best teaching
of writing, don’t be buffaloed into the idea that it’s an inferior species. The only
important  distinction  is  between  good  writing  and  bad  writing.  Good  writing  is
good writing, whatever form it takes and whatever we call it.

Writing About People

The Interview

Get people talking. Learn to ask questions that will elicit answers about what is
most interesting or vivid in their lives. Nothing so animates writing as someone
telling what he thinks or what he does—in his own words.

His  own  words  will  always  be  better  than  your  words,  even  if  you  are  the
most  elegant  stylist  in  the  land.  They  carry  the  inflection  of  his  speaking  voice
and  the  idiosyncrasies  of  how  he  puts  a  sentence  together.  They  contain  the
regionalisms  of  his  conversation  and  the  lingo  of  his  trade.  They  convey  his
enthusiasms. This is a person talking to the reader directly, not through the filter
of  a  writer.  As  soon  as  a  writer  steps  in,  everyone  else’s  experience  becomes
secondhand.

Therefore  learn  how  to  conduct  an  interview.  Whatever  form  of  nonfiction
you  write,  it  will  come  alive  in  proportion  to  the  number  of  “quotes”  you  can
weave into it as you go along. Often you’ll find yourself embarking on an article
so apparently lifeless—the history of an institution, or some local issue such as
storm  sewers—that  you  will  quail  at  the  prospect  of  keeping  your  readers,  or
even yourself, awake.

Take  heart.  You’ll  find  the  solution  if  you  look  for  the  human  element.
Somewhere  in  every  drab  institution  are  men  and  women  who  have  a  fierce
attachment to what they are doing and are rich repositories of lore. Somewhere
behind  every  storm  sewer  is  a  politician  whose  future  hangs  on  getting  it
installed  and  a  widow  who  has  always  lived  on  the  block  and  is  outraged  that
some damn-fool legislator thinks it will wash away. Find these people to tell your
story and it won’t be drab.

I’ve proved this to myself often. Many years ago I was invited to write a small
book  for  the  New  York  Public  Library  to  celebrate  the  50th  anniversary  of  its
main building on Fifth Avenue. On the surface it seemed to be just the story of a
marble  building  and  millions  of  musty  volumes.  But  behind  the  facade  I  found
that  the  library  had  19  research  divisions,  each  with  a  curator  supervising  a
hoard  of  treasures  and  oddities,  from  Washington’s  handwritten  Farewell

Address to 750,000 movie stills. I decided to interview all those curators to learn
what was in their collections, what they were adding to keep up with new areas
of knowledge, and how their rooms were being used.

I  found  that  the  Science  &  Technology  division  had  a  collection  of  patents
second  only  to  that  of  the  United  States  Patent  Office  and  was  therefore  a
second home to the city’s patent lawyers. But it also had a daily stream of men
and  women  who  thought  they  were  on  the  verge  of  discovering  perpetual
motion. “Everybody’s got something to invent,” the curator explained, “but they
won’t tell us what they’re looking for—maybe because they think we’ll patent it
ourselves.” The whole building turned out to be just such a mixture of scholars
and searchers and crackpots, and my story, though ostensibly the chronicle of an
institution, was really a story about people.

I  used  the  same  approach  in  a  long  article  about  Sotheby’s,  the  London
auction firm. Sotheby’s was also divided into various domains, such as silver and
porcelain and art, each with an expert in charge, and, like the Library, it subsisted
on the whims of a capricious public. The experts were like department heads in a
small college, and all of them had anecdotes that were unique both in substance
and in the manner of telling:

“We just sit here like Micawber waiting for things to come in,” said R. S.
Timewell,  head  of  the  furniture  department.  “Recently  an  old  lady  near
Cambridge wrote that she wanted to raise two thousand pounds and asked if
I would go through her house and see if her furniture would fetch that much.
I  did,  and  there  was  absolutely  nothing  of  value.  As  I  was  about  to  leave  I
said, ‘Have I seen everything?’ She said I had, except for a maid’s room that
she  hadn’t  bothered  to  show  me.  The  room  had  a  very  fine  18th-century
chest that the old lady was using to store blankets in. ‘Your worries are over,’
I  told  her,  ‘if  you  sell  that  chest.’  She  said,  ‘But  that’s  quite  impossible—
where will I store my blankets?’”

My worries were over, too. By listening to the quizzical scholars who ran the
business and to the men and women who flocked there every morning bearing
unloved objects found in British attics (“I’m afraid it isn’t Queen Anne, madam—
much  nearer  Queen  Victoria,  unfortunately”),  I  got  as  much  human  detail  as  a
writer could want.

Again, when I was asked in 1966 to write a history of the Book-of-the-Month
Club  to  mark  its  40th  birthday,  I  thought  I  might  encounter  nothing  but  inert
matter. But I found a peppery human element on both sides of the fence, for the
books had always been selected by a panel of strong-minded judges and sent to
equally stubborn subscribers, who never hesitated to wrap up a book they didn’t
like  and  send  it  right  back.  I  was  given  more  than  a  thousand  pages  of
transcribed  interviews  with  the  five  original  judges  (Heywood  Broun,  Henry
Seidel Canby, Dorothy Canfield, Christopher Morley and William Allen White), to

which I added my own interviews with the club’s founder, Harry Scherman, and
with  the  judges  who  were  then  active.  The  result  was  four  decades’  worth  of
personal memories on how America’s reading tastes had changed, and even the
books took on a life of their own and became characters in my story:

“Probably it’s difficult for anyone who remembers the prodigious success
of Gone With the Wind,” Dorothy Canfield said, “to think how it would have
seemed  to  people  who  encountered  it  simply  as  a  very,  very  long  and
detailed book about the Civil War and its aftermath. We had never heard of
the author and didn’t have anybody else’s opinion on it. It was chosen with a
little difficulty, because some of the characterization was not very authentic
or  convincing.  But  as  a  narrative  it  had  the  quality  which  the  French  call
attention: it made you want to turn over the page to see what happens next.
I  remember  that  someone  commented,  ‘Well,  people  may  not  like  it  very
much, but nobody can deny that it gives a lot of reading for your money.’ Its
tremendous success was, I must say, about as surprising to us as to anybody
else.”

Those  three  examples  are  typical  of  the  kind  of  information  that  is  locked
inside people’s heads, which a good nonfiction writer must unlock. The best way
to practice is to go  out and interview people. The  interview itself is one of the
most popular nonfiction forms, so you should master it early.

How  should  you  start?  First,  decide  what  person  you  want  to  interview.  If
you are a college student, don’t interview your roommate. With all due respect
for  what  terrific  roommates  you’ve  got,  they  probably  don’t  have  much  to  say
that the rest of us want to hear. To learn the craft of nonfiction you must push
yourself  out  into  the  real  world—your  town  or  your  city  or  your  county—and
pretend  that  you’re  writing  for  a  real  publication.  If  it  helps,  decide  which
publication you are hypothetically writing for. Choose as your subject someone
whose  job  is  so  important,  or  so  interesting,  or  so  unusual  that  the  average
reader would want to read about that person.

That doesn’t mean he or she has to be president of the bank. It can be the
owner of the local pizza parlor or supermarket or hairdressing academy. It can be
the fisherman who puts out to sea every morning, or the Little League manager,
or the nurse. It can be the butcher, the baker or—better yet, if you can find him
—the  candlestick  maker.  Look  for  the  women  in  your  community  who  are
unraveling  the  old  myths  about  what  the  two  sexes  were  foreordained  to  do.
Choose, in short, someone who touches some corner of the reader’s life.

Interviewing is one of those skills you can only get better at. You will never
again feel so ill at ease as when you try it for the first time, and probably you’ll
never feel entirely comfortable prodding another person for answers he or she
may be too shy or too inarticulate to reveal. But much of the skill is mechanical.
The rest is instinct—knowing how to make the other person relax, when to push,

when to listen, when to stop. This can all be learned with experience.

The basic tools for an interview are paper and some well-sharpened pencils.
Is that insultingly obvious advice? You’d be surprised how many writers venture
forth to stalk their quarry with no pencil, or with one that breaks, or with a pen
that doesn’t work, and with nothing to write on. “Be prepared” is as apt a motto
for the nonfiction writer on his rounds as it is for the Boy Scout.

But  keep  your  notebook  out  of  sight  until  you  need  it.  There’s  nothing  less
likely to relax a person than the arrival of a stranger with a stenographer’s pad.
Both  of  you  need  time  to  get  to  know  each  other.  Take  a  while  just  to  chat,
gauging what sort of person you’re dealing with, getting him or her to trust you.

Never  go  into  an  interview  without  doing  whatever  homework  you  can.  If
you  are  interviewing  a  town  official,  know  his  or  her  voting  record.  If  it’s  an
actress, know what plays or movies she has been in. You will be resented if you
inquire about facts you could have learned in advance.

Make  a  list  of  likely  questions—it  will  save  you  the  vast  embarrassment  of
going dry in mid-interview. Perhaps you won’t need the list; better questions will
occur  to  you,  or  the  people  being  interviewed  will  veer  off  at  an  angle  you
couldn’t  have  foreseen.  Here  you  can  only  go  by  intuition.  If  they  stray
hopelessly off the subject, drag them back. If you like the new direction, follow
along and forget the questions you intended to ask.

Many beginning interviewers are inhibited by the fear that they are imposing
on  other  people  and  have  no  right  to  invade  their  privacy.  This  fear  is  almost
wholly  unfounded.  The  so-called  man  in  the  street  is  delighted  that  somebody
wants  to  interview  him.  Most  men  and  women  lead  lives,  if  not  of  quiet
desperation, at least of desperate quietness, and they jump at a chance to talk
about their work to an outsider who seems eager to listen.

This  doesn’t  necessarily  mean  it  will  go  well.  Often  you  will  be  talking  to
people  who  have  never  been  interviewed  before,  and  they  will  warm  to  the
process  awkwardly,  self-consciously,  perhaps  not  giving  you  anything  you  can
use. Come back another day; it will go better. You will both even begin to enjoy it
—proof  that  you  aren’t  forcing  your  victims  to  do  something  they  really  don’t
want to do.

Speaking of tools, is it all right (you ask) to use a tape recorder? Why not just

take one along, start it going, and forget all that business of pencil and paper?

Obviously the tape recorder is a superb machine for capturing what people
have  to  say—especially  people  who,  for  reasons  of  their  culture  or
temperament, would never get around to writing it down. In such areas as social
history and anthropology it’s invaluable. I admire the books of Studs Terkel, such
as  Hard  Times:  An  Oral  History  of  the  Great  Depression,  which  he  “wrote”  by
recording interviews with ordinary people and patching the results into coherent
shape. I also like the question-and-answer interviews, obtained by tape recorder,
that are published in certain magazines. They have the sound of spontaneity, the
refreshing absence of a writer hovering over the product and burnishing it to a

high gloss.

Strictly, however, this isn’t writing. It’s a process of asking questions and then
pruning  and  splicing  and  editing  the  transcribed  answers,  and  it  takes  a
tremendous  amount  of  time  and  labor.  Educated  people  who  you  think  have
been talking into your tape recorder with linear precision turn out to have been
stumbling so aimlessly over the sands of language that they haven’t completed a
single decent sentence. The ear makes allowances for missing grammar, syntax
and transitions that the eye wouldn’t tolerate in print. The seemingly simple use
of a tape recorder isn’t simple; infinite stitchery is required.

But my main reasons for warning you off it are practical. One hazard is that
you don’t usually have a tape recorder with you; you are more likely to have a
pencil. Another is that tape recorders malfunction. Few moments in journalism
are as glum as the return of a reporter with “a really great story,” followed by his
pushing of the PLAY button and silence. But above all, a writer should be able to
see  his  materials.  If  your  interview  is  on  tape  you  become  a  listener,  forever
fussing  with  the  machine,  running  it  backward  to  find  the  brilliant  remark  you
can never quite find, running it forward, stopping, starting, driving yourself crazy.
Be a writer. Write things down.

I do my interviewing by hand, with a sharp No. 1 pencil. I like the transaction
with another person. I like the fact that that person can see me working—doing
a job, not just sitting there letting a machine do it for me. Only once did I use a
tape recorder extensively: for my book, Mitchell & Ruff, about the jazz musicians
Willie Ruff and Dwike Mitchell. Although I knew both men well, I felt that a white
writer  who  presumes  to  write  about  the  black  experience  has  an  obligation  to
get  the  tonalities  right.  It’s  not  that  Ruff  and  Mitchell  speak  a  different  kind  of
English; they speak good and often eloquent English. But as Southern blacks they
use  certain  words  and  idioms  that  are  distinctive  to  their  heritage,  adding
richness and humor to what they say. I didn’t want to miss any of those usages.
My tape recorder caught them all, and readers of the book can hear that I got
the two men right. Consider using a tape recorder in situations where you might
violate the cultural integrity of the people you’re interviewing.

Taking notes, however, has one big problem: the person you’re interviewing
often starts talking faster than you can write. You are still scribbling Sentence A
when  he  zooms  into  Sentence  B.  You  drop  Sentence  A  and  pursue  him  into
Sentence  B,  meanwhile  trying  to  hold  the  rest  of  Sentence  A  in  your  inner  ear
and hoping Sentence C will be a dud that you can skip altogether, using the time
to catch up. Unfortunately, you now have your subject going at high speed. He is
finally saying all the things you have been trying to cajole out of him for an hour,
and saying them with what seems to be Churchillian eloquence. Your inner ear is
clogging up with sentences you want to grab before they slip away.

Tell him to stop. Just say, “Hold it a minute, please,” and write until you catch
up.  What  you  are  trying  to  do  with  your  feverish  scribbling  is  to  quote  him
correctly, and nobody wants to be misquoted.

With  practice  you  will  write  faster  and  develop  some  form  of  shorthand.
You’ll find yourself devising abbreviations for often-used words and also omitting
the small connective syntax. As soon as the interview is over, fill in all the missing
words you can remember. Complete the uncompleted sentences. Most of them
will still be lingering just within the bounds of recall.

When  you  get  home,  type  out  your  notes—probably  an  almost  illegible
scrawl—so  that  you  can  read  them  easily.  This  not  only  makes  the  interview
accessible, along with the clippings and other materials you have assembled. It
enables you to review in tranquillity a torrent of words you wrote in haste, and
thereby discover what the person really said.

You’ll find that he said much that’s not interesting, or not pertinent, or that’s
repetitive. Single out the sentences that are most important or colorful. You’ll be
tempted to use all the words that are in your notes because you performed the
laborious chore of getting them all down. But that’s a self-indulgence—no excuse
for putting the reader to the same effort. Your job is to distill the essence.

What about your obligation to the person you interviewed? To what extent
can you cut or juggle his words? This question vexes every writer returning from
a  first  interview—and  it  should.  But  the  answer  isn’t  hard  if  you  keep  in  mind
two standards: brevity and fair play.

Your ethical duty to the person being interviewed is to present his position
accurately. If he carefully weighed two sides of an issue and you only quote his
views of one side, making him seem to favor that position, you will misrepresent
what he told you. Or you might misrepresent him by quoting him out of context,
or by choosing only some flashy remark without adding the serious afterthought.
You are dealing with a person’s honor and reputation—and also with your own.

But  after  that  your  duty  is  to  the  reader.  He  or  she  deserves  the  tightest
package.  Most  people  meander  in  their  conversation,  filling  it  with  irrelevant
tales and trivia. Much of it is delightful, but it’s still trivia. Your interview will be
strong to the extent that you get the main points made without waste. Therefore
if you find on page 5 of your notes a comment that perfectly amplifies a point on
page  2—a  point  made  earlier  in  the  interview—you  will  do  everyone  a  favor  if
you link the two thoughts, letting the second sentence follow and illustrate the
first. This may violate the truth of how the interview actually progressed, but you
will be true to the intent of what was said. Play with the quotes by all means—
selecting, rejecting, thinning, transposing their order, saving a good one for the
end. Just make sure the play is fair. Don’t change any words or let the cutting of
a sentence distort the proper context of what remains.

Do  I  literally  mean  “don’t  change  any  words”?  Yes  and  no.  If  a  speaker
chooses his words carefully you should make it a point of professional pride to
quote him verbatim. Most interviewers are sloppy about this; they think that if
they  achieve  a  rough  approximation  it’s  good  enough.  It’s  not  good  enough:
nobody wants to see himself in print using words or phrases he would never use.
But  if  the  speaker’s  conversation  is  ragged—if  his  sentences  trail  off,  if  his

thoughts are disorderly, if his language is so tangled that it would embarrass him
—the writer has no choice but to clean up the English and provide the missing
links.

Sometimes you can fall into a trap by trying to be too true to the speaker. As
you write your article, you type his words exactly as you took them down. You
even  allow  yourself  a  moment  of  satisfaction  at  being  such  a  faithful  scribe.
Later,  editing  what  you’ve  written,  you  realize  that  several  of  the  quotes  don’t
quite  make  sense.  When  you  first  heard  them  they  sounded  so  felicitous  that
you didn’t give them a second thought. Now, on second thought, there’s a hole
in  the  language  or  the  logic.  To  leave  the  hole  is  no  favor  to  the  reader  or  the
speaker—and  no  credit  to  the  writer.  Often  you  only  need  to  add  one  or  two
clarifying words. Or you might find another quote in your notes that makes the
same  point  clearly.  But  also  remember  that  you  can  call  the  person  you
interviewed. Tell him you want to check a few of the things he said. Get him to
rephrase  his  points  until  you  understand  them.  Don’t  become  the  prisoner  of
your  quotes—so  lulled  by  how  wonderful  they  sound  that  you  don’t  stop  to
analyze  them.  Never  let  anything  go  out  into  the  world  that  you  don’t
understand.

As  for  how  to  organize  the  interview,  the  lead  should  obviously  tell  the
reader why the person is worth reading about. What is his claim to our time and
attention?  Thereafter,  try  to  achieve  a  balance  between  what  the  subject  is
saying in his words and what you are writing in your words. If you quote a person
for  three  or  four  consecutive  paragraphs  it  becomes  monotonous.  Quotes  are
livelier  when  you  break  them  up,  making  periodic  appearances  in  your  role  as
guide.  You  are  still  the  writer—don’t  relinquish  control.  But  make  your
appearances useful; don’t just insert one of those dreary sentences that shout to
the  reader  that  your  sole  purpose  is  to  break  up  a  string  of  quotations  (“He
tapped  his  pipe  on  a  nearby  ashtray  and  I  noticed  that  his  fingers  were  quite
long.” “She toyed idly with her arugula salad”).

When you use a quotation, start the sentence with it. Don’t lead up to it with

a vapid phrase saying what the man said.

BAD:

Mr. Smith said that he liked to “go downtown once a week and have lunch with some of
my old friends.”

GOOD:

“I usually like to go downtown once a week,” Mr. Smith said, “and have lunch with some
of my old friends.”

The second sentence has vitality, the first one is dead. Nothing is deader than
to  start  a  sentence  with  a  “Mr.  Smith  said”  construction—it’s  where  many
readers stop reading. If the man said it, let him say it and get the sentence off to
a warm, human start.

But be careful where you break the quotation. Do it as soon as you naturally
can,  so  that  the  reader  knows  who  is  talking,  but  not  where  the  break  will
destroy the rhythm or the meaning. Notice how the following three variants all

inflict some kind of damage:

“I usually like,” Mr. Smith said, “to go downtown once a week and have

lunch with some of my old friends.”

“I usually like to go downtown,” Mr. Smith said, “once a week and have

lunch with some of my old friends.”

“I usually like to go downtown once a week and have lunch,” Mr. Smith

said, “with some of my old friends.”

Finally,  don’t  strain  to  find  synonyms  for  “he  said.”  Don’t  make  your  man
assert,  aver  and  expostulate  just  to  avoid  repeating  “he  said,”  and  please—
please!—don’t  write  “he  smiled”  or  “he  grinned.”  I’ve  never  heard  anybody
smile.  The  reader’s  eye  skips  over  “he  said”  anyway,  so  it’s  not  worth  a  lot  of
fuss. If you crave variety, choose synonyms that catch the shifting nature of the
conversation. “He pointed out,” “he explained,” “he replied,” “he added”—these
all  carry  a  particular  meaning.  But  don’t  use  “he  added”  if  the  man  is  merely
averring and not putting a postscript on what he just said.

All these technical skills, however, can take you just so far. Conducting a good
interview is finally related to the character and personality of the writer, because
the  person  you’re  interviewing  will  always  know  more  about  the  subject  than
you do. Some ideas on how to overcome your anxiety in this uneven situation,

intelligence,  are  offered

The proper and improper use of quotations has been much in the news, dragged
there  by  some  highly  visible  events.  One  was  the  libel  and  defamation  trial  of
Janet  Malcolm,  whom  a  jury  found  guilty  of  “fabricating”  certain  quotes  in  her
New  Yorker  profile  of  the  psychiatrist  Jeffrey  M.  Masson.  The  other  was  the
revelation by Joe McGinniss that in his biography of Senator Edward M. Kennedy,
The  Last  Brother,  he  had  “written  certain  scenes  and  described  certain  events
from what I have inferred to be his point of view,” though he never interviewed
Kennedy himself. Such blurring of fact and fiction is a trend that bothers careful
writers  of  nonfiction—an  assault  on  the  craft.  Yet  even  for  a  conscientious
reporter this is uncertain terrain. Let me invoke the work of Joseph Mitchell to
suggest some guidelines. The seamless weaving of quotes through his prose was
a  hallmark  of  Mitchell’s  achievement  in  the  brilliant  articles  he  wrote  for  The
New Yorker from 1938 to 1965, many of them dealing with people who worked
around  the  New  York  waterfront.  Those  articles  were  hugely  influential  on
nonfiction writers of my generation—a primary textbook.

The six Mitchell pieces that would eventually constitute his book, The Bottom
of the Harbor, a classic of American nonfiction, ran with maddening infrequency
in The New Yorker during the late 1940s and early ’50s, often several years apart.
Sometimes I would ask friends who worked at the magazine when I might expect

a  new  one,  but  they  never  knew  or  even  presumed  to  guess.  This  was  mosaic
work, they reminded me, and the mosaicist was finicky about fitting the pieces
together until he got them right. When at last a new article did appear I saw why
it  had  taken  so  long;  it  was  exactly  right.  I  still  remember  the  excitement  of
reading “Mr. Hunter’s Grave,” my favorite Mitchell piece. It’s about an 87-year-
old elder of the African Methodist Church, who was one of the last survivors of a
19th-century village of Negro oystermen on Staten Island called Sandy Ground.
With The Bottom of the Harbor the past became a major character in Mitchell’s
work, giving it a tone both elegiac and historical. The old men who were his main
subject were custodians of memory, a living link with an earlier New York.

The  following  paragraph,  quoting  George  H.  Hunter  on  the  subject  of
pokeweed,  is  typical  of  many  very  long  quotes  in  “Mr.  Hunter’s  Grave”  in  its
leisurely accretion of enjoyable detail:

“In the spring, when it first comes up, the young shoots above the root
are good to eat. They taste like asparagus. The old women in Sandy Ground
used  to  believe  in  eating  pokeweed  shoots,  the  old  Southern  women.  They
said it renewed your blood. My mother believed it. Every spring she used to
send me out in the woods to pick pokeweed shoots. And I believe it. So every
spring,  if  I  think  about  it,  I  go  pick  some  and  cook  them.  It’s  not  that  I  like
them so much—in fact, they give me gas—but they remind me of the days
gone by, they remind me of my mother. Now, away down here in the woods
in  this  part  of  Staten  Island,  you  might  think  you  were  fifteen  miles  on  the
other  side  of  nowhere,  but  just  a  little  ways  up  Arthur  Kill  Road,  up  near
Arden Avenue, there’s a bend in the road where you can sometimes see the
tops of the skyscrapers in New York. Just the tallest skyscrapers, and just the
tops of them. It has to be an extremely clear day. Even then, you might be
able  to  see  them  one  moment  and  the  next  moment  they’re  gone.  Right
beside  this  bend  in  the  road  there’s  a  little  swamp,  and  the  edge  of  this
swamp  is  the  best  place  I  know  to  pick  pokeweed.  I  went  up  there  one
morning this spring to pick some, but we had a late spring, if you remember,
and  the  pokeweed  hadn’t  come  up.  The  fiddleheads  were  up,  and  golden
club, and spring beauty, and skunk cabbage, and bluets, but no pokeweed. So
I was looking here and looking there, and not noticing where I was stepping,
and I made a misstep, and the next thing I knew I was up to my knees in mud.
I  floundered  around  in  the  mud  a  minute,  getting  my  bearings,  and  then  I
happened to raise my head and look up, and suddenly I saw, away off in the
distance,  miles  and  miles  away,  the  tops  of  the  skyscrapers  in  New  York
shining in the morning sun. I wasn’t expecting it, and it was amazing. It was
like a vision in the Bible.”

Now, nobody thinks Mr. Hunter really said all that in one spurt; Mitchell did a
heap of splicing. Yet I have no doubt that Mr. Hunter did say it at one moment or

another—that  all  the  words  and  turns  of  phrase  are  his.  It  sounds  like  him;
Mitchell didn’t write the scene from what he “inferred” to be his subject’s point
of  view.  He  made  a  literary  arrangement,  pretending  to  have  spent  one
afternoon  being  shown  around  the  cemetery,  whereas  I  would  guess,  knowing
his  famously  patient  and  courteous  manner  and  his  lapidary  methods,  that  the
article took at least a year of strolling, chatting, writing and rewriting. I’ve seldom
read a piece so rich in texture; Mitchell’s “afternoon” has the unhurried quality
of an actual afternoon. By the time it’s over, Mr. Hunter, reflecting on the history
of  oyster  fishing  in  New  York  harbor,  on  the  passing  of  generations  in  Sandy
Ground,  on  families  and  family  names,  planting  and  cooking,  wildflowers  and
fruit, birds and trees, churches and funerals, change and decay, has touched on
much of what living is all about.

I have no problem calling “Mr. Hunter’s Grave” nonfiction. Although Mitchell
altered  the  truth  about  elapsed  time,  he  used  a  dramatist’s  prerogative  to
compress  and  focus  his  story,  thereby  giving  the  reader  a  manageable
framework. If he had told  the story in real time, strung  across all the days and
months  he  did  spend  on  Staten  Island,  he  would  have  achieved  the  numbing
truth of Andy Warhol’s eight-hour film of a man having an eight-hour sleep. By
careful  manipulation  he  raised  the  craft  of  nonfiction  to  art.  But  he  never
manipulated Mr. Hunter’s truth; there has been no “inferring,” no “fabricating.”
He has played fair.

That,  finally,  is  my  standard.  I  know  that  it’s  just  not  possible  to  write  a
competent interview without some juggling and eliding of quotes; don’t believe
any writer who claims he never does it. But many shades of opinion exist on both
sides of mine. Purists would say that Joseph Mitchell has taken a novelist’s wand
to  the  facts.  Progressives  would  say  that  Mitchell  was  a  pioneer—that  he
anticipated by several decades the “new journalism” that writers like Gay Talese
and Tom Wolfe were hailed for inventing in the 1960s, using fictional techniques
of  imagined  dialogue  and  emotion  to  give  narrative  flair  to  works  whose  facts
they had punctiliously researched. Both views are partly right.

What’s wrong, I believe, is to fabricate quotes or to surmise what someone
might have said. Writing is a public trust. The nonfiction writer’s rare privilege is
to have the whole wonderful world of real people to write about. When you get
people talking, handle what they say as you would handle a valuable gift.

Writing About Places

The Travel Article

Next  to  knowing  how  to  write  about  people,  you  should  know  how  to  write
about a place. People and places are the twin pillars on which most nonfiction is
built.  Every  human  event  happens  somewhere,  and  the  reader  wants  to  know
what that somewhere was like.

In a few cases you’ll need only a paragraph or two to sketch the setting of an
event. But more often you’ll need to evoke the mood of a whole neighborhood
or town to give texture to the story you’re telling. And in certain cases, such as
the travel piece itself—that hardy form in which you recall how you took a boat
through  the  isles  of  Greece  or  went  backpacking  in  the  Rockies—descriptive
detail will be the main substance.

Whatever  the  proportion,  it  would  seem  to  be  relatively  easy.  The  dismal
truth  is  that  it’s  very  hard.  It  must  be  hard,  because  it’s  in  this  area  that  most
writers—professional and amateur—produce not only their worst work but work
that is just plain terrible. The terrible work has nothing to do with some terrible
flaw  of  character.  On  the  contrary,  it  results  from  the  virtue  of  enthusiasm.
Nobody  turns  so  quickly  into  a  bore  as  a  traveler  home  from  his  travels.  He
enjoyed his trip so much that he wants to tell us all about it—and “all” is what
we don’t want to hear. We only want to hear some. What made his trip different
from  everybody  else’s?  What  can  he  tell  us  that  we  don’t  already  know?  We
don’t  want  him  to  describe  every  ride  at  Disneyland,  or  tell  us  that  the  Grand
Canyon is awesome, or that Venice has canals. If one of the rides at Disneyland
got  stuck,  if  somebody  fell  into  the  awesome  Grand  Canyon,  that  would  be
worth hearing about.

It’s natural for all of us when we have gone to a certain place to feel that we
are  the  first  people  who  ever  went  there  or  thought  such  sensitive  thoughts
about it. Fair enough: it’s what keeps us going and validates our experience. Who
can visit the Tower of London without musing on the wives of Henry VIII, or visit
Egypt and not be moved  by the size and antiquity  of the pyramids? But that is
ground  already  covered  by  multitudes  of  people.  As  a  writer  you  must  keep  a

tight rein on your subjective self—the traveler touched by new sights and sounds
and  smells—and  keep  an  objective  eye  on  the  reader.  The  article  that  records
everything you did on your trip will fascinate you because it was your trip. Will it
fascinate the reader? It won’t. The mere agglomeration of detail is no free pass
to the reader’s interest. The detail must be significant.

The  other  big  trap  is  style.  Nowhere  else  in  nonfiction  do  writers  use  such
syrupy  words  and  groaning  platitudes.  Adjectives  you  would  squirm  to  use  in
conversation—“wondrous,”  “dappled,”  “roseate,”  “fabled,”  “scudding”—are
common  currency.  Half  the  sights  seen  in  a  day’s  sightseeing  are  quaint,
especially  windmills  and  covered  bridges;  they  are  certified  for  quaintness.
Towns  situated  in  hills  (or  foothills)  are  nestled—I  hardly  ever  read  about  an
unnestled  town  in  the  hills—and  the  countryside  is  dotted  with  byways,
preferably  half  forgotten.  In  Europe  you  awake  to  the  clip-clop  of  horse-drawn
wagons  along  a  history-haunted  river;  you  seem  to  hear  the  scratch  of  a  quill
pen.  This  is  a  world  where  old  meets  new—old  never  meets  old.  It’s  a  world
where  inanimate  objects  spring  to  life:  storefronts  smile,  buildings  boast,  ruins
beckon and the very chimneytops sing their immemorial song of welcome.

Travelese  is  also  a  style  of  soft  words  that  under  hard  examination  mean
nothing,  or  that  mean  different  things  to  different  people:  “attractive,”
“charming,” “romantic.” To write that “the city has its own attractiveness” is no
help.  And  who  will  define  “charm,”  except  the  owner  of  a  charm  school?  Or
“romantic”? These are subjective concepts in the eye of the beholder. One man’s
romantic sunrise is another man’s hangover.

How can you overcome such fearful odds and write well about a place? My

advice can be reduced to two principles—one of style, the other of substance.

First, choose your words with unusual care. If a phrase comes to you easily,
look at it with deep suspicion; it’s probably one of the countless clichés that have
woven their way so tightly into the fabric of travel writing that you have to make
a  special  effort  not  to  use  them.  Also  resist  straining  for  the  luminous  lyrical
phrase  to  describe  the  wondrous  waterfall.  At  best  it  will  make  you  sound
artificial—unlike  yourself—and  at  worst  pompous.  Strive  for  fresh  words  and
images. Leave “myriad” and their ilk to the poets. Leave “ilk” to anyone who will
take it away.

As for substance, be intensely selective. If you are describing a beach, don’t
write  that  “the  shore  was  scattered  with  rocks”  or  that  “occasionally  a  seagull
flew over.” Shores have a tendency to be scattered with rocks and to be flown
over by seagulls. Eliminate every such fact that is a known attribute: don’t tell us
that the sea had waves and the sand was white. Find details that are significant.
They  may  be  important  to  your  narrative;  they  may  be  unusual,  or  colorful,  or
comic, or entertaining. But make sure they do useful work.

I’ll  give  you  some  examples  from  various  writers,  widely  different  in
temperament but alike in the power of the details they choose. The first is from
an  article  by  Joan  Didion  called  “Some  Dreamers  of  the  Golden  Dream.”  It’s

about a lurid crime that occurred in the San Bernardino Valley of California, and
in this early passage the writer is taking us, as if in her own car, away from urban
civilization  to  the  lonely  stretch  of  road  where  Lucille  Miller’s  Volkswagen  so
unaccountably caught fire:

This is the California where it is easy to Dial-A-Devotion; but hard to buy a
book. This is the country of the teased hair and the Capris and the girls for
whom all life’s promise comes down to a waltz-length white wedding dress
and the birth of a Kimberly or a Sherry or a Debbi and a Tijuana divorce and a
return  to  hairdresser’s  school.  “We  were  just  crazy  kids,”  they  say  without
regret,  and  look  to  the  future.  The  future  always  looks  good  in  the  golden
land, because no one remembers the past. Here is where the hot wind blows
and the old ways do not seem relevant, where the divorce rate is double the
national average and where one person in every 38 lives in a trailer. Here is
the last stop for all those who come from somewhere else, for all those who
drifted away from the cold and the past and the old ways. Here is where they
are trying to find a new life style, trying to find it in the only places they know
to look: the movies and the newspapers. The case of Lucille Marie Maxwell
Miller is a tabloid monument to the new style.

Imagine  Banyan  Street  first,  because  Banyan  is  where  it  happened.  The
way to Banyan is to drive west from San Bernardino out Foothill Boulevard,
Route 66: past the Santa Fe switching yards, the Forty Winks Motel. Past the
motel that is 19 stucco tepees: “SLEEP  IN  A  WIGWAM—GET  MORE  FOR  YOUR  WAMPUM.”
Past Fontana Drag City and Fontana Church of the Nazarene and the Pit Stop
A  Go-Go;  past  Kaiser  Steel,  through  Cucamonga,  out  to  the  Kapu  Kai
Restaurant-Bar  and  Coffee  Shop,  at  the  corner  of  Route  66  and  Carnelian
Avenue.  Up  Carnelian  Avenue  from  the  Kapu  Kai,  which  means  “Forbidden
Seas,”  the  subdivision  flags  whip  in  the  harsh  wind.  “HALFACRE  RANCHES!  SNACK
BARS! TRAVERTINE ENTRIES! $95 DOWN.” It is the trail of an intention gone haywire, the
flotsam  of  the  New  California.  But  after  a  while  the  signs  thin  out  on
Carnelian  Avenue,  and  the  houses  are  no  longer  the  bright  pastels  of  the
Springtime Home owners but the faded bungalows of the people who grow a
few grapes and keep a few chickens out here, and then the hill gets steeper
and  the  road  climbs  and  even  the  bungalows  are  few,  and  here—desolate,
roughly surfaced, lined with eucalyptus and lemon groves—is Banyan Street.

In  only  two  paragraphs  we  have  a  feeling  not  only  for  the  tackiness  of  the
New  California  landscape,  with  its  stucco  tepees  and  instant  housing  and
borrowed  Hawaiian  romance,  but  for  the  pathetic  impermanence  of  the  lives
and pretensions of the people who have alighted there. All the details—statistics
and names and signs—are doing useful work.

Concrete detail is also the anchor of John McPhee’s prose. Coming Into the
Country,  his  book  about  Alaska—to  choose  one  example  from  his  many

craftsmanlike books—has a section devoted to the quest for a possible new state
capital. It takes McPhee only a few sentences to give us a sense of what’s wrong
with the present capital, both as a place to live and as a place for lawmakers to
make good laws:

A pedestrian today in Juneau, head down and charging, can be stopped
for  no  gain  by  the  wind.  There  are  railings  along  the  streets  by  which
senators  and  representatives  can  haul  themselves  to  work.  Over  the  past
couple of years, a succession of wind gauges were placed on a ridge above
the town. They could measure velocities up to 200 miles per hour. They did
not survive. The taku winds tore them apart after driving their indicators to
the  end  of  the  scale.  The  weather  is  not  always  so  bad;  but  under  its
influence  the  town  took  shape,  and  so  Juneau  is  a  tight  community  of
adjacent  buildings  and  narrow  European  streets,  adhering
its
mountainsides and fronting the salt water....

to

The urge to move the capital came over Harris during those two years [in
the Alaska State Senate]. Sessions began in January and ran on at least three
months, and Harris developed what he called “a complete sense of isolation
—stuck there. People couldn’t get at you. You were in a cage. You talked to
the hard lobbyists every day. Every day the same people. What was going on
needed more airing.”

The oddity of the city, so remote from the ordinary American experience, is
instantly  clear.  One  possibility  for  the  legislators  was  to  move  the  capital  to
Anchorage.  There  at  least  people  wouldn’t  feel  they  were  in  an  alien  town.
McPhee  distills  its  essence  in  a  paragraph  that  is  adroit  both  in  detail  and  in
metaphor:

Almost all Americans would recognize Anchorage, because Anchorage is
that part of any city where the city has burst its seams and extruded Colonel
Sanders.  Anchorage  is  sometimes  excused  in  the  name  of  pioneering.  Build
now,  civilize  later.  But  Anchorage  is  not  a  frontier  town.  It  is  virtually
unrelated to its environment. It has come in on the wind, an American spore.
A  large  cookie  cutter  brought  down  on  El  Paso  could  lift  something  like
Anchorage into the air. Anchorage is the northern rim of Trenton, the center
of  Oxnard,  the  ocean-blind  precincts  of  Daytona  Beach.  It  is  condensed,
instant Albuquerque.

What McPhee has done is to capture the idea of Juneau and Anchorage. Your
main task as a travel writer is to find the central idea of the place you’re dealing
with.  Over  the  decades  countless  writers  have  tried  to  harness  the  Mississippi
River,  to  catch  the  essence  of  the  mighty  highway  that  runs  down  the  pious
center  of  America,  often  with  Biblical  wrath.  But  nobody  has  done  it  more

succinctly  than  Jonathan  Raban,  revisiting  the  Midwestern  states  inundated  by
the river’s recent massive floods. Here’s how his article begins:

Flying to Minneapolis from the West, you see it as a theological problem.
The great flat farms of Minnesota are laid out in a ruled grid, as empty of
surprises  as  a  sheet  of  graph  paper.  Every  gravelled  path,  every  ditch  has
been  projected  along  the  latitude  and  longitude  lines  of  the  township-and-
range-survey system. The farms are square, the fields are square, the houses
are square; if you could pluck their roofs off from over people’s heads, you’d
see  families  sitting  at  square  tables  in  the  dead  center  of  square  rooms.
Nature  has  been  stripped,  shaven,  drilled,  punished  and  repressed  in  this
right-angled, right-thinking Lutheran country. It makes you ache for the sight
of  a  rebellious  curve  or  the  irregular,  dappled  colour  of  a  field  where  a
careless farmer has allowed corn and soybeans to cohabit.

But  there  are  no  careless  farmers  on  this  flight  path.  The  landscape  is
open  to  your  inspection—as  to  God’s—as  an  enormous  advertisement  for
the awful rectitude of the people. There are no funny goings-on down here,
it says; we are plain upright folk, fit candidates for heaven.

Then  the  river  enters  the  picture—a  broad  serpentine  shadow  that
sprawls unconformably across the checkerboard. Deviously winding, riddled
with black sloughs and green cigar-shaped islands, the Mississippi looks as if
it  had  been  put  here  to  teach  the  god-fearing  Midwest  a  lesson  about
stubborn and unregenerate nature. Like John Calvin’s bad temper, it presents
itself as the wild beast in the heart of the heartland.

When people who live on the river attribute a gender to the Mississippi,
they  do  so  without  whimsy,  and  nearly  always  they  give  it  their  own  sex.
“You  better  respect  the  river,  or  he’ll  do  you  in,”  growls  the  lockmaster.
“She’s mean—she’s had a lot of people from round here,” says the waitress
at the lunch counter. When Eliot wrote that the river is within us (as the sea
is all about us), he was nailing something true in an everyday way about the
Mississippi. People do see its muddy turmoil as a bodying-forth of their own
turbulent  inner  selves.  When  they  boast  to  strangers  about  their  river’s
wantonness,
its  floods  and
drownings, there’s a note in their voices that says, I have it in me to do that …
I know how it feels.

its  appetite  for  trouble  and  destruction,

What  could  be  luckier  for  a  nonfiction  writer  than  to  live  in  America?  The
country is unendingly various and surprising. Whether the locale you write about
is urban or rural, east or west, every place has a look, a population and a set of
cultural  assumptions  unlike  any  other  place.  Find  those  distinctive  traits.  The
following  three  passages  describe  parts  of  America  that  could  hardly  be  more
different. Yet in each case the writer has given us so many precise images that
we feel we are there. The first excerpt, from “Halfway to Dick and Jane: A Puerto

Rican Pilgrimage,” by Jack Agueros, describes the Hispanic neighborhood of the
writer’s boyhood in New York, a place where different principalities could exist
within a single block:

Every classroom had ten kids who spoke no English. Black, Italian, Puerto
Rican relations in the classroom were good, but we all knew we couldn’t visit
one  another’s  neighborhoods.  Sometimes  we  could  not  move  too  freely
within  our  own  blocks.  On  109th,  from  the  lamp  post  west,  the  Latin  Aces,
and from the lamp post east, the Senecas, the “club” I belonged to. The kids
who spoke no English became known as the Marine Tigers, picked up from a
popular Spanish song. The Marine Tiger and the Marine Shark were two ships
that  sailed  from  San  Juan  to  New  York  and  brought  over  many,  many
migrants from the island.

The  neighborhood  had  its  boundaries.  Third  Avenue  and  east,  Italian.
Fifth Avenue and west, black. South, there was a hill on 103rd Street known
locally  as  Cooney’s  Hill.  When  you  got  to  the  top  of  the  hill,  something
strange  happened:  America  began,  because  from  the  hill  south  was  where
the “Americans” lived. Dick and Jane were not dead; they were alive and well
in a better neighborhood.

When,  as  a  group  of  Puerto  Rican  kids,  we  decided  to  go  swimming  in
Jefferson  Park  Pool,  we  knew  we  risked  a  fight  and  a  beating  from  the
Italians. And when we went to La Milagrosa Church in Harlem, we knew we
risked  a  fight  and  a  beating  from  the  blacks.  But  when  we  went  over
Cooney’s Hill, we risked dirty  looks, disapproving looks, and questions from
the police like “What are you doing in this neighborhood?” and “Why don’t
you kids go back where you belong?”

Where  we  belonged!  Man,  I  had  written  compositions  about  America.
Didn’t I belong on the Central Park tennis courts, even if I didn’t know how to
play?  Couldn’t  I  watch  Dick  play?  Weren’t  these  policemen  working  for  me
too?

Go  from  there  to  a  small  town  in  East  Texas,  just  across  the  border  from
Arkansas. This piece by Prudence Mackintosh ran in Texas Monthly, a magazine I
enjoy for the aliveness with which she and her fellow Texas writers take me—a
resident of mid-Manhattan—to every corner of their state.

I  gradually  realized  that  much  of  what  I  had  grown  up  believing  was
Texan was really Southern. The cherished myths of Texas had little to do with
my part of the state. I knew dogwood, chinaberry, crape myrtle, and mimosa,
but no bluebonnets or Indian paintbrush. Although the Four States Fair and
Rodeo  was  held  in  my  town,  I  never  really  learned  to  ride  a  horse.  I  never
knew  anyone  who  wore  cowboy  hats  or  boots  as  anything  other  than  a
costume. I knew farmers whose property was known as Old Man So-and-so’s

place,  not  ranches  with  their  cattle  brands  arched  over  entrance  gates.
Streets  in  my  town  were  called  Wood,  Pine,  Olive,  and  Boulevard,  not
Guadalupe and Lavaca.

Go still farther west—to Muroc Field, in California’s Mojave Desert, the one
place in America that was hard and desolate enough, as Tom Wolfe explains in
the brilliant early chapters of The Right Stuff, for the Army Air Force to use when
it set out a generation ago to break the sound barrier.

It looked like some fossil landscape that had long since been left behind
by  the  rest  of  territorial  evolution.  It  was  full  of  huge  dry  lake  beds,  the
biggest  being  Rogers  Lake.  Other  than  sagebrush  the  only  vegetation  was
Joshua  trees,  twisted  freaks  of  the  plant  world  that  looked  like  a  cross
between cactus and Japanese bonsai. They had a dark petrified green color
and  horribly  crippled  branches.  At  dusk  the  Joshua  trees  stood  out  in
silhouette  on  the  fossil  wasteland  like  some  arthritic  nightmare.  In  the
summer the temperature went up to 110 degrees as a matter of course, and
the dry lake beds were covered in sand, and there would be windstorms and
sandstorms  right  out  of  a  Foreign  Legion  movie.  At  night  it  would  drop  to
near  freezing,  and  in  December  it  would  start  raining,  and  the  dry  lakes
would fill up with a few inches of water, and some sort of putrid prehistoric
shrimps would work their way up from out of the ooze, and sea gulls would
come flying in a hundred miles or more from the ocean, over the mountains,
to  gobble  up  these  squirming  little  throwbacks.  A  person  had  to  see  it  to
believe it....

When the wind blew the few inches of water back and forth across the
lake  beds,  they  became  absolutely  smooth  and  level.  And  when  the  water
evaporated in the spring, and the sun baked the ground hard, the lake beds
became  the  greatest  natural  landing  fields  ever  discovered,  and  also  the
biggest,  with  miles  of  room  for  error.  That  was  highly  desirable,  given  the
nature of the enterprise at Muroc:

Besides  the  wind,  sand,  tumbleweed,  and  Joshua  trees,  there  was
nothing  at  Muroc  except  for  two  quonset-style  hangars,  side  by  side,  a
couple of gasoline pumps, a single concrete runway, a few tarpaper shacks,
and  some  tents.  The  officers  stayed  in  the  shacks  marked  “barracks,”  and
lesser souls stayed in the tents and froze all night and fried all day. Every road
into the property had a guardhouse on it manned by soldiers. The enterprise
the Army had undertaken in this godforsaken place was the development of
supersonic jet and rocket planes.

Practice  writing  this  kind  of  travel  piece,  and  just  because  I  call  it  a  travel
piece  I  don’t  mean  you  have  to  go  to  Morocco  or  Mombasa.  Go  to  your  local
mall, or bowling alley, or day-care center. But whatever place you write about,

go  there  often  enough  to  isolate  the  qualities  that  make  it  distinctive.  Usually
this will be some combination of the place and the people who inhabit it. If it’s
your  local  bowling  alley  it  will  be  a  mixture  of  the  atmosphere  inside  and  the
regular patrons. If it’s a foreign city it will be a mixture of the ancient culture and
the present populace. Try to find it.

A master of this feat of detection was the English author V. S. Pritchett, one
of the best and most versatile of nonfiction writers. Consider what he squeezes
out of a visit to Istanbul:

Istanbul  has  meant  so  much  to  the  imagination  that  the  reality  shocks
most travelers. We cannot get the sultans out of our minds. We half expect
to  find  them  still  cross-legged  and  jeweled  on  their  divans.  We  remember
tales of the harem. The truth is that Istanbul has no glory except its situation.
It is a city of steep, cobbled, noisy hills....

Mostly  the  shops  sell  cloth,  clothes,  stockings,  shoes,  the  Greek  traders
rushing  out,  with  cloth  unrolled,  at  any  potential  customer,  the  Turks
passively waiting. Porters shout; everyone shouts; you are butted by horses,
knocked sideways by loads of bedding, and, through all this, you see one of
the  miraculous  sights  of  Turkey—a  demure  youth  carrying  a  brass  tray
suspended on three chains, and in the exact center of the tray a small glass of
red tea. He never spills it; he maneuvers it through chaos to his boss, who is
sitting on the doorstep of his shop.

One realizes there are two breeds in Turkey: those who carry and those
who sit. No one sits quite so relaxedly, expertly, beatifically as a Turk; he sits
with every inch of his body; his very face sits. He sits as if he inherited the art
from  generations  of  sultans  in  the  palace  above  Seraglio  Point.  Nothing  he
likes better than to invite you to sit with him in his shop or in his office with
half  a  dozen  other  sitters:  a  few  polite  inquiries  about  your  age,  your
marriage, the sex of your children, the number of your relations, and where
and how you live, and then, like the other sitters, you clear your throat with a
hawk that surpasses anything heard in Lisbon, New York or Sheffield, and join
the general silence.

I like the phrase “his very face sits”—just four short words, but they convey
an  idea  so  fanciful  that  they  take  us  by  surprise.  They  also  tell  us  a  great  deal
about  Turks.  I’ll  never  be  able  to  visit  Turkey  again  without  noticing  its  sitters.
With  one  quick  insight  Pritchett  has  caught  a  whole  national  trait.  This  is  the
essence  of  good  writing  about  other  countries.  Distill  the  important  from  the
immaterial.

The English (as Pritchett reminds me) have long excelled at a distinctive form
of travel writing—the article that’s less notable for what a writer extracts from a
place than for what the place extracts from him. New sights touch off thoughts
that otherwise wouldn’t have entered the writer’s mind. If travel is broadening,

it should broaden more than just our knowledge of how a Gothic cathedral looks
or how the French make wine. It should generate a whole constellation of ideas
about  how  men  and  women  work  and  play,  raise  their  children,  worship  their
gods,  live  and  die.  The  books  by  Britain’s  desert-crazed  scholar-adventurers  in
Arabia, like T. E. Lawrence, Freya Stark and Wilfred Thesiger, who chose to live
among  the  Bedouin,  derive  much  of  their  strange  power  from  the  reflections
born of surviving in so harsh and minimal an environment.

So  when  you  write  about  a  place,  try  to  draw  the  best  out  of  it.  But  if  the
process should work in reverse, let it draw the best out of you. One of the richest
travel books written by an American is Walden, though Thoreau only went a mile
out of town.

Finally,  however,  what  brings  a  place  alive  is  human  activity:  people  doing
the  things  that  give  a  locale  its  character.  Forty  years  later  I  still  remember
reading James Baldwin’s dynamic account, in The Fire Next Time, of being a boy
preacher  in  a  Harlem  church.  I  still  carry  with  me  what  it  felt  like  to  be  in  that
sanctuary on a Sunday morning, because Baldwin pushed himself beyond mere
description into a higher literary region of sounds and rhythms, of shared faith
and shared emotions:

The  church  was  very  exciting.  It  took  a  long  time  for  me  to  disengage
myself from this excitement, and on the blindest, most visceral level, I never
really have, and never will. There is no music like that music, no drama like
the  drama  of  the  saints  rejoicing,  the  sinners  moaning,  the  tambourines
racing,  and  all  those  voices  coming  together  and  crying  holy  unto  the  Lord.
There is still, for me, no pathos quite like the pathos of those multicolored,
worn,  somehow  triumphant  and  transfigured  faces,  speaking  from  the
depths of a visible, tangible continuing despair of the goodness of the Lord. I
have never seen anything to equal the fire and excitement that sometimes,
without warning, fill a church, causing the church, as Leadbelly and so many
others  have  testified,  to  “rock.”  Nothing  that  has  happened  to  me  since
equals the power and the glory that I sometimes felt when, in the middle of a
sermon, I knew that I was somehow, by some miracle, really carrying, as they
said, “the Word”—when the church and I were one. Their pain and their joy
were  mine,  and  mine  were  theirs—and  their  cries  of  “Amen!”  and
“Hallelujah!”  and  “Yes,  Lord!”  and  “Praise  His  name!”  and  “Preach  it,
brother!”  sustained  and  whipped  on  my  solos  until  we  all  became  equal,
wringing wet, singing and dancing, in anguish and rejoicing, at the foot of the
altar.

Never be afraid to write about a place that you think has had every last word
written  about  it.  It’s  not  your  place  until  you  write  about  it.  I  set  myself  that
challenge  when  I  decided  to  write  a  book,  American  Places,  about  15  heavily
touristed,  cliché  sites  that  have  become  American  icons  or  that  represent  a

powerful idea about American ideals and aspirations.

Nine  of  my  sites  were  super-icons:  Mount  Rushmore,  Niagara  Falls,  the
Alamo,  Yellowstone  Park,  Pearl  Harbor,  Mount  Vernon,  Concord  &  Lexington,
Disneyland,  and  Rockefeller  Center.  Five  were  places  that  embody  a  distinctive
idea about America: Hannibal, Missouri, Mark Twain’s boyhood town, which he
used  to  create  twin  myths  of  the  Mississippi  River  and  an  ideal  childhood;
Appomattox, where the Civil War ended; Kitty Hawk, where the Wright brothers
invented  flight,  symbolic  of  America  as  a  nation  of  genius-tinkerers;  Abilene,
Kansas,  Dwight  D.  Eisenhower’s  prairie  town,  symbolic  of  the  values  of  small-
town America; and Chautauqua, the upstate New York village that hatched most
of America’s notions of self-improvement and adult education. Only one of my
shrines was new: Maya Lin’s Civil Rights Memorial, in Montgomery, Alabama, to
the  men  and  women  and  children  who  were  killed  during  the  civil  rights
movement in the South. Except for Rockefeller Center, I had never visited any of
those places and knew nothing of their history.

My method was not to ask tourists gazing up at Mount Rushmore, “What do
you  feel?”  I  know  what  they  would  have  said:  something  subjective  (“It’s
incredible!”) and therefore not useful to me as information. Instead I went to the
custodians of these sites and asked: Why do you think two million people a year
come  to  Mount  Rushmore?  Or  three  million  to  the  Alamo?  Or  one  million  to
Concord  bridge?  Or  a  quarter  million  to  Hannibal?  What  kind  of  quest  are  all
these people on? My purpose was to enter into the intention of each place: to
find out what it was trying to be, not what I might have expected or wanted it to
be.

By  interviewing  local  men  and  women—park  rangers,  curators,  librarians,
merchants, old-timers, Daughters of the Republic of Texas, ladies of the Mount
Vernon Ladies Association—I tapped into one of the richest veins waiting for any
writer who goes looking for America: the routine eloquence of people who work
at a place that fills a need for someone else. Here are things that custodians at
three sites told me:

MOUNT RUSHMORE: “In the afternoon when the sunlight throws the shadows
into that socket,” one of the rangers, Fred Banks, said, “you feel that the eyes
of  those  four  men  are  looking  right  at  you,  no  matter  where  you  move.
They’re  peering  right  into  your  mind,  wondering  what  you’re  thinking,
making you feel guilty: ‘Are you doing your part?’”

KITTY HAWK: “Half the people who come to Kitty Hawk are people who have
some  tie  to  aviation,  and  they’re  looking  for  the  roots  of  things,”  says
superintendent  Ann  Childress.  “We  periodically  have  to  replace  certain
photographs of Wilbur and Orville Wright because their faces get rubbed out
—visitors want to touch them. The Wrights were everyday guys, barely out of
high school in their education, and yet they did something extraordinary, in a
very  short  time,  with  minimal  funds.  They  succeeded  wildly—they  changed

how we all live—and I think, ‘Could I be so inspired and work so diligently to
create something of such magnitude?’”

YELLOWSTONE PARK: “Visiting national parks is an American family tradition,”
said ranger George B. Robinson, “and the one park everyone has heard of is
Yellowstone. But there’s also a hidden reason. I think people have an innate
need to reconnect with the places from which they have evolved. One of the
closest bonds I’ve noticed here is the bond between the very young and the
very old. They’re nearer to their origins.”

The strong emotional content of the book was supplied by what I got other
people to say. I didn’t need to wax emotional or patriotic. Beware of waxing. If
you’re  writing  about  places  that  are  sacred  or  meaningful,  leave  the  waxing  to
someone else. One fact that I learned soon after I got to Pearl Harbor is that the
battleship Arizona, sunk by the Japanese on December 7, 1941, continues to leak
as  much  as  a  gallon  of  oil  every  day.  When  I  later  interviewed  superintendent
Donald  Magee  he  recalled  that  upon  taking  the  job  he  reversed  a  bureaucratic
fiat prohibiting children under 45 inches tall from visiting the Arizona Memorial.
Their  behavior,  it  had  been  decreed,  could  “negatively  impact  the  experience”
for other tourists.

“I  don’t  think  children  are  too  young  to  appreciate  what  that  ship
represents,” Magee told me. “They’ll remember it if they see the leaking oil—if
they see that the ship is still bleeding.”

Writing About Yourself

The Memoir

Of all the subjects available to you as a writer, the one you know best is yourself:
your past and your present, your thoughts and your emotions. Yet it’s probably
the subject you try hardest to avoid.

Whenever I’m invited to visit a writing class in a school or a college, the first
thing I ask the students is: “What are your problems? What are your concerns?”
Their answer, from Maine to California, is the same: “We have to write what the
teacher wants.” It’s a depressing sentence.

“That’s the last thing any good teacher wants,” I tell them. “No teacher wants
twenty-five copies of the same person, writing about the same topic. What we’re
all  looking  for—what  we  want  to  see  pop  out  of  your  papers—is  individuality.
We’re looking for whatever it is that makes you unique. Write about what you
know and what you think.”

They  can’t.  They  don’t  think  they  have  permission.  I  think  they  get  that

permission by being born.

Middle age brings no release. At writers’ conferences I meet women whose
children  have  grown  up  and  who  now  want  to  sort  out  their  lives  through
writing.  I  urge  them  to  write  in  personal  detail  about  what  is  closest  to  them.
They  protest.  “We  have  to  write  what  editors  want,”  they  say.  In  other  words,
“We  have  to  write  what  the  teacher  wants.”  Why  do  they  think  they  need
permission  to  write  about  the  experiences  and  feelings  they  know  best—their
own?

Jump  still  another  generation.  I  have  a  journalist  friend  who  has  spent  a
lifetime  writing  honorably,  but  always  out  of  secondhand  sources,  explicating
other people’s events. Over the years I’ve often heard him mention his father, a
minister who took many lonely liberal stands in a conservative Kansas town, and
obviously  that’s  where  my  friend  got  his  own  strong  social  conscience.  A  few
years ago I asked him when he was going to start writing about the elements in
his life that were really important to him, including his father. One of these days,
he said. But the day was always put off.

When he turned 65 I began to pester him. I sent him some memoirs that had
moved  me,  and  finally  he  agreed  to  spend  his  mornings  writing  in  that
retrospective  vein.  Now  he  can  hardly  believe  what  a  liberating  journey  he  is
embarked  on:  how  much  he  is  discovering  about  his  father  that  he  never
understood, and about his own life. But when he describes his journey he always
says,  “I  never  had  the  nerve  before,”  or  “I  was  always  afraid  to  try.”  In  other
words, “I didn’t think I had permission.”

Why  not?  Wasn’t  America  the  land  of  the  “rugged  individualist”?  Let’s  get
that lost land and those lost individualists back. If you’re a writing teacher, make
your students believe in the validity of their lives. If you’re a writer, give yourself
permission to tell us who you are.

By  “permission”  I  don’t  mean  “permissive.”  I  have  no  patience  with  sloppy
workmanship—the  let-it-all-hang-out  verbiage  of  the  ’60s.  To  have  a  decent
career in this country it’s important to be able to write decent English. But on the
question of who you’re writing for, don’t be eager to please. If you consciously
write for a teacher or for an editor, you’ll end up not writing for anybody. If you
write for yourself, you’ll reach the people you want to write for.

Writing about one’s life is naturally related to how long one has lived. When
students say they have to write what the teacher wants, what they often mean is
that they don’t have anything to say—so meager is their after-school existence,
bounded largely by television and the mall, two artificial versions of reality. Still,
at any age, the physical act of writing is a powerful search mechanism. I’m often
amazed, dipping into my past, to find some forgotten incident clicking into place
just when I need it. Your memory is almost always good for material when your
other wells go dry.

Permission,  however,  is  a  two-edged  instrument,  and  nobody  should  use  it
without posting a surgeon general’s warning: EXCESSIVE WRITING ABOUT YOURSELF CAN BE
HAZARDOUS  TO  THE  HEALTH  OF  THE  WRITER  AND  THE  READER.  A  thin  line  separates  ego  from
egotism.  Ego  is  healthy;  no  writer  can  go  far  without  it.  Egotism,  however,  is  a
drag,  and  this  chapter  is  not  intended  as  a  license  to  prattle  just  for  therapy.
Again, the rule I suggest is: Make sure every component in your memoir is doing
useful  work.  Write  about  yourself,  by  all  means,  with  confidence  and  with
pleasure. But see that all  the details—people, places, events, anecdotes, ideas,
emotions—are moving your story steadily along.

Which brings me to memoir as a form. I’ll read almost anybody’s memoir. For
me, no other nonfiction form goes so deeply to the roots of personal experience
—to all the drama and pain and humor and unexpectedness of life. The books I
remember most vividly from my first reading of them tend to be memoirs: books
such  as  André  Aciman’s  Out  of  Egypt,  Michael  J.  Arlen’s  Exiles,  Russell  Baker’s
Growing Up, Vivian Gornick’s Fierce  Attachments,  Pete  Hamill’s  A  Drinking  Life,
Moss Hart’s Act One, John Houseman’s Run-Through, Mary Karr’s The Liars’ Club,
Frank  McCourt’s  Angela’s  Ashes,  Vladimir  Nabokov’s  Speak,  Memory,  V.  S.
Pritchett’s A Cab at the Door, Eudora Welty’s One Writer’s Beginnings,  Leonard

Woolf’s Growing.

What  gives  them  their  power  is  the  narrowness  of  their  focus.  Unlike
autobiography, which spans an entire life, memoir assumes the life and ignores
most  of  it.  The  memoir  writer  takes  us  back  to  some  corner  of  his  or  her  past
that was unusually intense—childhood, for instance—or that was framed by war
or some other social upheaval. Baker’s Growing Up is a box within a box. It’s the
story  of  a  boy  growing  up,  set  inside  the  story  of  a  family  battered  by  the
Depression;  it  takes  its  strength  from  its  historical  context.  Nabokov’s  Speak,
Memory, the most elegant memoir I know, invokes a golden boyhood in czarist
St.  Petersburg,  a  world  of  private  tutors  and  summer  houses  that  the  Russian
Revolution would end forever. It’s an act of writing frozen in a unique time and
place.  Pritchett’s  A  Cab  at  the  Door  recalls  a  childhood  that  was  almost
Dickensian; his grim apprenticeship to the London leather trade seems to belong
to the 19th century. Yet Pritchett describes it without self-pity and even with a
certain  merriment.  We  see  that  his  childhood  was  inseparably  joined  to  the
particular moment and country and class he was born into—and was an organic
part of the wonderful writer he grew up to be.

Think narrow, then, when you try the form. Memoir isn’t the summary of a
life;  it’s  a  window  into  a  life,  very  much  like  a  photograph  in  its  selective
composition.  It  may  look  like  a  casual  and  even  random  calling  up  of  bygone
events.  It’s  not;  it’s  a  deliberate  construction.  Thoreau  wrote  seven  different
drafts  of  Walden  in  eight  years;  no  American  memoir  was  more  painstakingly
pieced  together.  To  write  a  good  memoir  you  must  become  the  editor  of  your
own  life,  imposing  on  an  untidy  sprawl  of  half-remembered  events  a  narrative
shape and an organizing idea. Memoir is the art of inventing the truth.

One  secret  of  the  art  is  detail.  Any  kind  of  detail  will  work—a  sound  or  a
smell or a song title—as long as it played a shaping role in the portion of your life
you have chosen to distill. Consider sound. Here’s how Eudora Welty begins One
Writer’s Beginnings, a deceptively slender book packed with rich remembrance:

In  our  house  on  North  Congress  Street,  in  Jackson,  Mississippi,  where  I
was born, the oldest of three children, in 1909, we grew up to the striking of
clocks. There was a mission-style oak grandfather clock standing in the hall,
which sent its gonglike strokes through the living room, dining room, kitchen,
and pantry, and up the sounding board of the stairwell. Through the night, it
could  find  its  way  into  our  ears;  sometimes,  even  on  the  sleeping  porch,
midnight could wake us up. My parents’ bedroom had a smaller striking clock
that  answered  it.  Though  the  kitchen  clock  did  nothing  but  show  the  time,
the dining room clock was a cuckoo clock with weights on long chains, on one
of which my baby brother, after climbing on a chair to the top of the china
closet,  once  succeeded  in  suspending  the  cat  for  a  moment.  I  don’t  know
whether  or  not  my  father’s  Ohio  family,  in  having  been  Swiss  back  in  the
1700s before the first three Welty brothers came to America, had anything to

do with this; but we all of us have been time-minded all our lives. This was
good at least for a future fiction writer, being able to learn so penetratingly,
and almost first of all, about chronology. It was one of a good many things I
learned almost without knowing it; it would be there when I needed it.

My  father  loved  all  instruments  that  would  instruct  and  fascinate.  His
place to keep things was the drawer in the “library table” where lying on top
of his folded maps was a telescope with brass extensions, to find the moon
and the Big Dipper after supper in our front yard, and to keep appointments
with eclipses. There was a folding Kodak that was brought out for Christmas,
birthdays,  and  trips.  In  the  back  of  the  drawer  you  could  find  a  magnifying
glass, a kaleidoscope, and a gyroscope kept in a black buckram box, which he
would set dancing for us on a string pulled tight. He had also supplied himself
with an assortment of puzzles composed of metal rings and intersecting links
and keys chained together, impossible for the rest of us, however patiently
shown, to take apart; he had an almost childlike love of the ingenious.

In  time,  a  barometer  was  added  to  our  dining  room  wall;  but  we  really
didn’t  need  it.  My  father  had  the  country  boy’s  accurate  knowledge  of  the
weather and its skies. He went out and stood on our front steps first thing in
the morning and took a look at it and a sniff. He was a pretty good weather
prophet.

“Well, I’m not,” my mother would say with enormous self-satisfaction....
So I developed a strong meteorological sensibility. In years ahead when I
wrote stories, atmosphere took its influential role from the start. Commotion
in the weather and the inner feelings aroused by such a hovering disturbance
emerged connected in dramatic form.

Notice  how  much  we  learn  instantly  about  Eudora  Welty’s  beginnings—the
kind of home she was born into, the kind of man her father was. She has rung us
into her Mississippi girlhood with the chiming of clocks up and down the stairs
and even out onto the sleeping porch.

For Alfred Kazin, smell is a thread that he follows back to his boyhood in the
Brownsville section of Brooklyn. From my first encounter with Kazin’s A  Walker
in the City, long ago, I remember it as a sensory memoir. The following passage is
not only a good example of how to write with your nose; it shows how memoir is
nourished by a writer’s ability to create a sense of place—what it was that made
his neighborhood and his heritage distinctive:

It was the darkness and emptiness of the streets I liked most about Friday
evening, as if in preparation for that day of rest and worship which the Jews
greet “as a bride”—that day when the very touch of money is prohibited, all
work, all travel, all household duties, even to the turning on and off of a light
—Jewry  had  found  its  way  past  its  tormented  heart  to  some  ancient  still
center of itself. I waited for the streets to go dark on Friday evening as other

children waited for the Christmas lights.... When I returned home after three,
the  warm  odor  of  a  coffee  cake  baking  in  the  oven,  and  the  sight  of  my
mother on her hands and knees scrubbing the linoleum on the dining room
floor, filled me with such tenderness that I could feel my senses reaching out
to embrace every single object in our household....

My great moment came at six, when my father returned from work, his
overalls smelling faintly of turpentine and shellac, white drops of silver paint
still gleaming on his chin. Hanging his overcoat in the long dark hall that led
into our kitchen, he would leave in one pocket a loosely folded copy of the
New York World; and then everything that beckoned to me from that other
hemisphere of my brain beyond the East River would start up from the smell
of  fresh  newsprint  and  the  sight  of  the  globe  on  the  front  page.  It  was  a
paper  that  carried  special  associations  for  me  with  Brooklyn  Bridge.  They
published  the  World  under  the  green  dome  on  Park  Row  overlooking  the
bridge; the fresh salt air of New York harbor lingered for me in the smell of
paint  and  damp  newsprint  in  the  hall.  I  felt  that  my  father  brought  the
outside straight into our house with each day’s copy of the World.

Kazin  would  eventually  cross  the  Brooklyn  Bridge  and  become  the  dean  of
American literary critics. But the literary genre that was at the center of his life is
not the usual stuff of literature: the novel, or the short story, or the poem. It’s
memoir,  or  what  he  calls  “personal  history”—specifically,  such  “personal
American classics,” discovered when he was a boy, as Walt Whitman’s Civil War
diary  Specimen  Days  and  his  Leaves  of  Grass,  Thoreau’s  Walden  and  especially
his  Journals,  and  The  Education  of  Henry  Adams.  What  excited  Kazin  was  that
Whitman, Thoreau and Adams wrote themselves into the landscape of American
literature by daring to use the most intimate forms—journals, diaries, letters and
memoirs—and  that  he  could  also  make  the  same  “cherished  connection”  to
America  by  writing  personal  history  and  thereby  place  himself,  the  son  of
Russian Jews, in the same landscape.

You  can  use  your  own  personal  history  to  cross  your  own  Brooklyn  Bridge.
Memoir  is  the  perfect  form  for  capturing  what  it’s  like  to  be  a  newcomer  in
America, and every immigrant son and daughter brings a distinctive voice from
his  or  her  culture.  The  following  passage  by  Enrique  Hank  Lopez,  “Back  to
Bachimba,” is typical of the powerful tug of the abandoned past, of the country
left behind, which gives the form so much of its emotion.

I am a pocho from Bachimba, a rather small Mexican village in the state of
Chihuahua, where my father fought with the army of Pancho Villa. He was, in
fact, the only private in Villa’s army.

Pocho is ordinarily a derogatory term in Mexico (to define it succinctly, a
pocho is a Mexican slob who has pretensions of being a gringo sonofabitch),
but  I  use  it  in  a  very  special  sense.  To  me  that  word  has  come  to  mean

“uprooted  Mexican,”  and  that’s  what  I  have  been  all  my  life.  Though  my
entire upbringing and education took place in the United States, I have never
felt completely American; and when I am in Mexico, I sometimes feel like a
displaced gringo with a curiously Mexican name—Enrique Preciliano Lopez y
Martinez  de  Sepulveda  de  Sapien.  One  might  conclude  that  I’m  either  a
schizo-cultural Mexican or a cultured schizoid American.

In  any  event,  the  schizoing  began  a  long  time  ago,  when  my  father  and
many of Pancho Villa’s troops fled across the border to escape the oncoming
federales  who  eventually  defeated  Villa.  My  mother  and  I,  traveling  across
the  hot  desert  plains  in  a  buckboard  wagon,  joined  my  father  in  El  Paso,
Texas, a few days after his hurried departure. With more and more Villistas
swarming  into  El  Paso  every  day,  it  became  apparent  that  jobs  would  be
exceedingly  scarce  and  insecure,  so  my  parents  packed  our  few  belongings
and we took the first available bus to Denver. My father had hoped to move
to Chicago because the name sounded so Mexican, but my mother’s meager
savings were hardly enough to buy tickets for Colorado.

There we moved into a ghetto of Spanish-speaking residents who chose
to call themselves Spanish-Americans and resented the sudden migration of
their  brethren  from  Mexico,  whom  they  sneeringly  called  surumatos  (slang
in  a
for  “southerners”)....  We  surumatos  began  huddling  together
subneighborhood  within  the  larger  ghetto,  and  it  was  there  that  I  became
painfully  aware  that  my  father  had  been  the  only  private  in  Pancho  Villa’s
army.  Most  of  my  friends  were  the  sons  of  captains,  colonels,  majors,  and
even  generals,  though  a  few  fathers  were  admittedly  mere  sergeants  and
corporals....  My  chagrin  was  accentuated  by  the  fact  that  Pancho  Villa’s
exploits  were  a  constant  topic  of  conversation  in  our  household.  My  entire
childhood seems to be shadowed by his presence. At our dinner table, almost
every  night,  we  would  listen  to  endlessly  repeated  accounts  of  this  battle,
that stratagem, or some great act of Robin Hood kindness by el centauro del
norte....

As if to deepen our sense of Villismo, my parents also taught us “Adelita”
and  “Se  llevaron  el  cañón  para  Bachimba”  (“They  took  the  cannon  to
Bachimba”),  the  two  most  famous  songs  of  the  Mexican  revolution.  Some
twenty  years  later  (during  my  stint  at  Harvard  Law  School),  while  strolling
along  the  Charles  River,  I  would  find  myself  softly  singing  “Se  Llevaron  el
cañón para Bachimba, para Bachimba, para Bachimba” over and over again.
That’s all I could remember of that poignant rebel song. Though I had been
born there, I had always regarded “Bachimba” as a fictitious, made-up, Lewis
Carroll kind of name. So that eight years ago, when I first returned to Mexico,
I  was  literally  stunned  when  I  came  to  a  crossroad  south  of  Chihuahua  and
saw  an  old  road  marker:  “Bachimba  18km.”  Then  it  really  exists—I  shouted
inwardly—Bachimba is a real town! Swinging onto the narrow, poorly paved
road, I gunned the motor and sped toward the town I’d been singing about

since infancy.

For  Maxine  Hong  Kingston,  a  daughter  of  Chinese  immigrants  in  Stockton,
California, shyness and embarrassment were central to the experience of being a
child  starting  school  in  a  strange  land.  In  this  passage,  aptly  called  “Finding  a
Voice,” from her book The Woman Warrior,  notice  how  vividly  Kingston  recalls
both facts and feelings from those traumatic early years in America:

When I went to kindergarten and had to speak English for the first time, I
became  silent.  A  dumbness—a  shame—still  cracks  my  voice  in  two,  even
when I want to say  “hello” casually, or ask an easy  question in front of the
check-out counter, or ask directions of a bus driver. I stand frozen....

During the first silent year I spoke to no one at school, did not ask before
going to the lavatory, and flunked kindergarten. My sister also said nothing
for three years, silent in the playground and silent at lunch. There were other
quiet  Chinese  girls  not  of  our  family,  but  most  of  them  got  over  it  sooner
than  we  did.  I  enjoyed  the  silence.  At  first  it  did  not  occur  to  me  I  was
supposed to talk or to pass kindergarten. I talked at home and to one or two
of  the  Chinese  kids  in  class.  I  made  motions  and  even  made  some  jokes.  I
drank  out  of  a  toy  saucer  when  the  water  spilled  out  of  the  cup,  and
everybody laughed, pointed at me, so I did it some more. I didn’t know that
Americans don’t drink out of saucers....

It was when I found out I had to talk that school became a misery, that
the silence became a misery. I did not speak and felt bad each time that I did
not speak. I read aloud in first grade, though, and heard the barest whisper
with  little  squeaks  come  out  of  my  throat.  “Louder,”  said  the  teacher,  who
scared the voice away again. The other Chinese girls did not talk either, so I
knew the silence had to do with being a Chinese girl.

That childhood whisper is now an adult writer’s voice that speaks to us with
wisdom and humor, and I’m grateful to have that voice in our midst. Nobody but
a  Chinese-American  woman  could  have  made  me  feel  what  it’s  like  to  be  a
Chinese  girl  plunked  down  in  an  American  kindergarten  and  expected  to  be  an
American girl. Memoir is one way to make sense of the cultural differences that
can be a painful fact of daily life in America today. Consider the quest for identity
described by Lewis P. Johnson in the following essay, “For My Indian Daughter.”
Johnson,  who  grew  up  in  Michigan,  is  a  great-grandson  of  the  last  recognized
chief of the Potawatomi Ottawas:

One day when I was 35 or thereabouts I heard about an Indian powwow.
My father used to attend them and so with great curiosity and a strange joy
at discovering a part of my heritage, I decided the thing to do to get ready for
the big event was to have my friend make me a spear in his forge. The steel

was fine and blue and iridescent. The feathers on the shaft were bright and
proud.

In  a  dusty  state  fairground  in  southern  Indiana,  I  found  white  people
dressed  as  Indians.  I  learned  they  were  “hobbyists,”  that  is,  it  was  their
hobby  and  leisure  pastime  to  masquerade  as  Indians  on  weekends.  I  felt
ridiculous with my spear, and I left.

It  was  years  before  I  could  tell  anyone  of  the  embarrassment  of  this
weekend and see any humor in it. But in a way it was that weekend, for all its
stillness, that was my awakening. I realized I didn’t know who I was. I didn’t
have  an  Indian  name.  I  didn’t  speak  the  Indian  language.  I  didn’t  know  the
Indian customs. Dimly I remembered the Ottawa word for dog, but it was a
baby word, kahgee, not the full word, muhkahgee, which I was later to learn.
I
Even  more  hazily
remembered legs dancing around me, dust. Where had that been? Who had I
been?  “Suwaukquat,”  my  mother  told  me  when  I  asked,  “where  the  tree
begins to grow.”

I  remembered  a  naming  ceremony  (my  own).

That  was  1968,  and  I  was  not  the  only  Indian  in  the  country  who  was
feeling the need to remember who he or she was. There were others. They
had  powwows,  real  ones,  and  eventually  I  found  them.  Together  we
researched our past, a search that for me culminated in the Longest Walk, a
march on Washington in 1978. Maybe because I now know what it means to
be Indian, it surprises me that others don’t. Of course there aren’t very many
of us left. The chances of an average person knowing an average Indian in an
average lifetime are pretty slim.

The crucial ingredient in memoir is, of course, people. Sounds and smells and
songs  and  sleeping  porches  will  take  you  just  so  far.  Finally  you  must  summon
back the men and women and children who notably crossed your life. What was
it that made them memorable—what turn of mind, what crazy habits? A typical
odd bird from memoir’s vast aviary is John Mortimer’s father, a blind barrister,
as recalled by the son in Clinging to the Wreckage, a memoir that manages the
feat of being both tender and hilarious. Mortimer, a lawyer himself and a prolific
author and playwright, best known for Rumpole of the Bailey, writes that when
his  father  became  blind  he  “insisted  on  continuing  with  his  legal  practice  as
though  nothing  had  happened”  and  that  his  mother  thereupon  became  the
person who would read his briefs to him and make notes on his cases.

She became a well-known figure in the Law Courts, as well known as the
Tipstaff  or  the  Lord  Chief  Justice,  leading  my  father  from  Court  to  Court,
smiling  patiently  as  he  tapped  the  paved  floors  with  his  clouded  malacca
cane and shouted abuse either at her or at his instructing solicitor, or at both
of  them  at  the  same  time.  From  early  in  the  war,  when  they  settled
permanently in the country, my mother drove my father fourteen miles a day

to Henley Station and took him up in the train. Ensconced in a corner seat,
dressed like Winston Churchill, in a black jacket and striped trousers, bow-tie
worn  with  a  wing-collar,  boots  and  spats,  my  father  would  require  her  to
read in a loud and clear voice the evidence in the divorce case that would be
his  day’s  work.  As  the  train  ground  to  a  halt  around  Maidenhead  the  first-
class carriage would fall silent as my mother read out the reports of Private
Investigators  on  adulterous  behavior  which  they  had  observed  in  detail.  If
she  dropped  her  voice  over  descriptions  of  stained  bed-linen,  male  and
female  clothing  found  scattered  about,  or  misconduct  in  motor  cars,  my
father would call out, “Speak up, Kath!” and their fellow travelers would be
treated to another thrilling installment.

But the most interesting character in a memoir, we hope, will turn out to be
the person who wrote it. What did that man or woman learn from the hills and
valleys  of  life?  Virginia  Woolf  was  an  avid  user  of  highly  personal  forms—
memoirs,  journals,  diaries,  letters—to  clarify  her  thoughts  and  emotions.  (How
often  we  start  writing  a  letter  out  of  obligation  and  only  discover  in  the  third
paragraph  that  we  have  something  we  really  want  to  say  to  the  person  we’re
writing  to.)  What  Virginia  Woolf  intimately  wrote  during  her  lifetime  has  been
immensely  helpful  to  other  women  wrestling  with  similar  angels  and  demons.
Acknowledging that debt in a review of a book about Woolf’s abused girlhood,
Kennedy Fraser begins with a memoir of her own that seizes our attention with
its honesty and vulnerability:

There  was  a  time  when  my  life  seemed  so  painful  to  me  that  reading
about the lives of other women writers was one of the few things that could
help. I was unhappy, and ashamed of it; I was baffled by my life. For several
years  in  my  early  thirties,  I  would  sit  in  my  armchair  reading  books  about
these other lives. Sometimes when I came to the end, I would sit down and
read  the  book  through  from  the  beginning  again.  I  remember  an  incredible
intensity about all this, and also a kind of furtiveness—as if I were afraid that
someone might look through the window and find me out. Even now, I feel I
should pretend that I was reading only these women’s fiction or their poetry
—their lives as they chose to present them, alchemized as art. But that would
be a lie. It was the private messages I really liked—the journals and letters,
and autobiographies and biographies whenever they seemed to be telling the
truth.  I  felt  very  lonely  then,  self  absorbed,  shut  off.  I  needed  all  this
murmured  chorus,  this  continuum  of  true-life  stories,  to  pull  me  through.
They  were  like  mothers  and  sisters  to  me,  these  literary  women,  many  of
them already dead; more than my own family, they seemed to stretch out a
hand. I had come to New York when I was young, as so many come, in order
to invent myself. And, like many modern people—modern women, especially
—I had catapulted out of my context.... The successes [of the writers] gave

me hope, of course, yet it was the desperate bits I liked best. I was looking
for  directions,  gathering  clues.  I  was  especially  grateful  for  the  secret,
shameful  things  about  these  women—the  pain:  the  abortions  and
misalliances, the pills they took, the amount they drank. And what had made
them  live  as  lesbians,  or  fall  in  love  with  homosexual  men,  or  men  with
wives?

The best gift you have to offer when you write personal history is the gift of
yourself. Give yourself permission to write about yourself, and have a good time
doing it.

Science and Technology

Take a class of writing students in a liberal arts college and assign them to write
about some aspect of science, and a pitiful moan will go around the room. “No!
Not  science!”  the  moan  says.  The  students  have  a  common  affliction:  fear  of
science. They were told at an early age by a chemistry or a physics teacher that
they don’t have “a head for science.”

Take an adult chemist or physicist or engineer and ask him or her to write a
report, and you’ll see something close to panic. “No! Don’t make us write!” they
say.  They  also  have  a  common  affliction:  fear  of  writing.  They  were  told  at  an
early age by an English teacher that they don’t have “a gift for words.”

Both are unnecessary fears to lug through life, and in this chapter I’d like to
help you ease whichever one is yours. The chapter is based on a simple principle:
writing is not a special language owned by the English teacher. Writing is thinking
on  paper.  Anyone  who  thinks  clearly  can  write  clearly,  about  anything  at  all.
Science,  demystified,  is  just  another  nonfiction  subject.  Writing,  demystified,  is
just another way for scientists to transmit what they know.

Of the two fears, mine has been fear of science. I once flunked a chemistry
course taught by a woman who had become a legend with three generations of
students, the legend being she could teach chemistry to anybody. Even today I’m
not much farther along than James Thurber’s grandmother, who, as he recalled
her in My Life and Hard Times, thought “electricity was dripping invisibly all over
the  house”  from  wall  sockets.  But  as  a  writer  I’ve  learned  that  scientific  and
technical  material  can  be  made  accessible  to  the  layman.  It’s  just  a  matter  of
putting  one  sentence  after  another.  The  “after,”  however,  is  crucial.  Nowhere
else must you work so hard to write sentences that form a linear sequence. This
is no place for fanciful leaps or implied truths. Fact and deduction are the ruling
family.

The science assignment that I give to students is a simple one. I just ask them
to describe how something works. I don’t care about style or any other graces. I
only want them to tell me, say, how a sewing machine does what it does, or how
a pump operates, or why an apple falls down, or how the eye tells the brain what
it  sees.  Any  process  will  do,  and  “science”  can  be  defined  loosely  to  include

technology, medicine and nature.

A  tenet  of  journalism  is  that  “the  reader  knows  nothing.”  As  tenets  go,  it’s
not  flattering,  but  a  technical  writer  can  never  forget  it.  You  can’t  assume  that
your  readers  know  what  you  assume  everybody  knows,  or  that  they  still
remember what was once explained to them. After hundreds of demonstrations
I’m  still  not  sure  I  could  get  into  one  of  those  life  jackets  that  airline  flight
attendants have shown me: something about “simply” putting my arms through
the  straps,  “simply”  pulling  two  toggle  knobs  sharply  downward  (or  is  it
sideways?)  and  “simply”  blowing  it  up—but  not  too  soon.  The  only  step  I’m
confident I could perform is to blow it up too soon.

Describing how a process works is valuable for two reasons. It forces you to
make sure you know how it works. Then it forces you to take the reader through
the same sequence of ideas and deductions that made the process clear to you.
I’ve  found  it  to  be  a  breakthrough  for  many  students  whose  thinking  was
disorderly.  One  of  them,  a  bright  Yale  sophomore  still  spraying  the  page  with
fuzzy generalities at midterm, came to class in a high mood and asked if he could
read his paper on how a fire extinguisher works. I was sure we were in for chaos.
But  his  piece  moved  with  simplicity  and  logic.  It  clearly  explained  how  three
different kinds of fires are attacked by three different kinds of fire extinguishers.
I  was  elated  by  his  overnight  change  into  a  writer  who  had  learned  to  write
sequentially, and so was he. By the end of his junior year he had written a how-
to book that sold better than any book I had written.

Many other fuzzy students tried the same cure and have written with clarity
ever since. Try it. For the principle of scientific and technical writing applies to all
nonfiction  writing.  It’s  the  principle  of  leading  readers  who  know  nothing,  step
by step, to a grasp of subjects they didn’t think they had an aptitude for or were
afraid they were too dumb to understand.

Imagine science writing as an upside-down pyramid. Start at the bottom with
the  one  fact  a  reader  must  know  before  he  can  learn  any  more.  The  second
sentence  broadens  what  was  stated  first,  making  the  pyramid  wider,  and  the
third sentence broadens the second, so that you can gradually move beyond fact
into significance and speculation—how a new discovery alters what was known,
what  new  avenues  of  research  it  might  open,  where  the  research  might  be
applied. There’s no limit to how wide the pyramid can become, but your readers
will understand the broad implications only if they start with one narrow fact.

A good example is an article by Harold M. Schmeck, Jr., which ran on page 1

of the New York Times.

WASHINGTON—There  was  a  chimpanzee  in  California  with  a  talent  for
playing ticktacktoe. Its trainers were delighted with this evidence of learning,
but  they  were  even  more  impressed  by  something  else.  They  found  they
could  tell  from  the  animal’s  brain  whether  any  particular  move  would  be
right  or  wrong.  It  depended  on  the  chimpanzee’s  state  of  attention.  When

the trained animal was properly attentive, he made the right move.

Well, that’s a reasonably interesting fact. But why is it worth page 1 of the

Times? Paragraph 2 tells me:

The significant fact was that scientists were able to recognize that state.
By  elaborate  computer  analysis  of  brain  wave  signals  they  were  learning  to
distinguish what might be called “states of mind.”

But hadn’t this been possible before?

This was far more ambitious than simply detecting gross states of arousal,
drowsiness or sleep. It was a new step toward understanding how the brain
works.

How is it a new step?

The chimpanzee and the research team at the University of California at
Los  Angeles  have  graduated  from  the  ticktacktoe  stage,  but  the  work  with
brain waves is continuing. It has already revealed some surprising insights to
the  brain’s  behavior  during  space  flight.  It  shows  promise  of  application  to
social and domestic problems on earth and even to improvements in human
learning.

Good.  I  could  hardly  ask  for  a  broader  application  of  the  research:  space,
human  problems  and  the  cognitive  process.  But  is  it  an  isolated  effort?  No
indeed.

It  is  part  of  the  large  ferment  of  modern  brain  research  in  progress  in
laboratories  throughout  the  United  States  and  abroad.  Involved  are  all
manner  of  creatures  from  men  and  monkeys  to  rats  and  mice,  goldfish,
flatworms and Japanese quail.

I begin to see the total context. But what is the purpose?

The  ultimate  goal  is  to  understand  the  human  brain—that  incredible
three-pound  package  of  tissue  that  can  imagine  the  farthest  reaches  of  the
universe  and  the  ultimate  core  of  the  atom  but  cannot  fathom  its  own
functioning.  Each  research  project  bites  off  a  little  piece  of  an  immense
puzzle.

So  now  I  know  where  the  chimp  at  U.C.L.A.  fits  into  the  spectrum  of
international science. Knowing this, I’m ready to learn more about his particular
contribution.

In the case of the chimpanzee being taught to play ticktacktoe, even the
trained  eye  could  see  nothing  beyond  the  ordinary  in  the  wavy  lines  being
traced  on  paper  to  represent  electrical  waves  from  an  animal’s  brain.  But
through analysis by computer it was possible to tell which traces showed that
the animal was about to make the right move and which preceded a mistake.
An important key was the system of computer analysis developed largely
by  Dr.  John  Hanley.  The  state  of  mind  that  always  foreshadowed  a  correct
answer  was  one  that  might  be  described  as  trained  attentiveness.  Without
the computer’s ability to analyze the huge complexities of the recorded brain
waves, the “signatures” of such states could not have been detected.

The  article  goes  on  for  four  columns  to  describe  potential  uses  of  the
research—measuring  causes  of  domestic  tension,  reducing  drivers’  rush-hour
stress—and  eventually  it  touches  on  work  being  done  in  many  pockets  of
it  started  with  one  chimpanzee  playing
medicine  and  psychology.  But
ticktacktoe.

You  can  take  much  of  the  mystery  out  of  science  writing  by  helping  the
reader to identify with the scientific work being done. Again, this means looking
for  the  human  element—and  if  you  have  to  settle  for  a  chimpanzee,  at  least
that’s the next-highest rung on the Darwinian ladder.

One  human  element  is  yourself.  Use  your  own  experience  to  connect  the
reader to some mechanism that also touches his life. In the following article on
memory, notice how the writer, Will Bradbury, gives us a personal handle with
which to grab a complex subject:

Even  now  I  see  the  dark  cloud  of  sand  before  it  hits  my  eyes,  hear  my
father’s  calm  voice  urging  me  to  cry  the  sting  away,  and  feel  anger  and
humiliation  burn  in  my  chest.  More  than  30  years  have  passed  since  that
moment when a playmate, fighting for my toy ambulance, tossed a handful
of sand in my face. Yet the look of the sand and ambulance, the sound of my
father’s voice and the throb of my bruised feelings all remain sharp and clear
today. They are the very first things I can remember, the first bits of visual,
verbal and emotional glass imbedded in the mosaic I have come to know as
me by what is certainly the brain’s most essential function—memory.

Without  this  miracle  function  that  enables  us  to  store  and  recall
information,  the  brain’s  crucial  systems  for  waking  and  sleeping,  for
expressing  how  we  feel  about  things  and  for  performing  complicated  acts
could  do  little  more  than  fumble  with  sensory  inputs  of  the  moment.  Nor
would  man  have  a  real  feeling  of  self,  for  he  would  have  no  gallery  of  the

past  to  examine,  learn  from,  enjoy  and,  when  necessary,  hide  away  in.  Yet
after  thousands  of  years  of  theorizing,  of  reading  and  misreading  his  own
behavioral quirks, man is just beginning to have some understanding of the
mysterious process that permits him to break and store bits of passing time.

One problem has been to decide what memory is and what things have it.
Linseed oil, for example, has a kind of memory. Once exposed to light, even if
only  briefly,  it  will  change  consistency  and  speed  the  second  time  it  is
exposed. It will “remember” its first encounter with the light. Electronic and
fluidic  circuits  also  have  memory,  of  a  more  sophisticated  kind.  Built  into
computers,  they  are  able  to  store  and  retrieve  extraordinary  amounts  of
information. And the human body has at least four kinds of memory....

That’s a fine lead. Who doesn’t possess some cluster of vivid images that can
be  recalled  from  an  inconceivably  early  age?  The  reader  is  eager  to  learn  how
such a feat of storage and retrieval is accomplished. The example of the linseed
oil is just piquant enough to make us wonder what “memory” really is, and then
the writer reverts to the human frame of reference, for it is man who has built
the computer circuits and has four kinds of memory himself.

Another personal method is to weave a scientific story around someone else.
That  was  the  appeal  of  the  articles  called  “Annals  of  Medicine”  that  Berton
Roueché  wrote  for  many  years  in  The  New  Yorker.  They  are  detective  stories,
almost  always  involving  a  victim—some  ordinary  person  struck  by  a  mystifying
ailment—and  a  gumshoe  obsessed  with  finding  the  villain.  Here’s  how  one  of
them begins:

At about 8 o’clock on Monday morning, Sept. 25, 1944, a ragged, aimless
old  man  of  82  collapsed  on  the  sidewalk  on  Dey  Street,  near  the  Hudson
Terminal. Innumerable people must have noticed him, but he lay there alone
for  several  minutes,  dazed,  doubled  up  with  abdominal  cramps,  and  in  an
agony  of  retching.  Then  a  policeman  came  along.  Until  the  policeman  bent
over the old man he may have supposed that he had just a sick drunk on his
hands; wanderers dropped by drink are common in that part of town in the
early morning. It was not an opinion that he could have held for long. The old
man’s nose, lips, ears and fingers were sky-blue.

By noon, eleven blue men have been admitted to nearby hospitals. But never
fear: Dr. Ottavio Pellitteri, field epidemiologist, is on the scene and telephoning
Dr. Morris Greenberg at the Bureau of Preventable Diseases. Slowly the two men
piece together fragments of evidence that seem to defy medical history until the
case is nailed down and the villain identified as a type of poisoning so rare that
many standard texts on toxicology don’t even mention it. Roueché’s secret is as
old as the art of storytelling. We are in on a chase and a mystery. But he doesn’t
start  with  the  medical  history  of  poisoning,  or  talk  about  standard  texts  on

toxicology. He gives us a man—and not only a man but a blue one.

Another  way  to  help  your  readers  understand  unfamiliar  facts  is  to  relate
them to sights they are familiar with. Reduce the abstract principle to an image
they  can  visualize.  Moshe  Safdie,  the  architect  who  conceived  Habitat,  the
innovative housing complex at Montreal’s Expo ’67, explains in his book Beyond
Habitat that man would build better than he does if he took the time to see how
nature  does  the  job,  since  “nature  makes  form,  and  form  is  a  by-product  of
evolution”:

One  can  study  plant  and  animal  life,  rock  and  crystal  formations,  and
discover  the  reasons  for  their  particular  form.  The  nautilus  has  evolved  so
that when its shell grows,  its head will not get stuck  in the opening. This is
known  as  gnomonic  growth;  it  results  in  the  spiral  formation.  It  is,
mathematically, the only way it can grow.

The same is true of achieving strength with a particular material. Look at
the  wings  of  a  vulture,  at  its  bone  formation.  A  most  intricate  three-
dimensional geometric pattern has evolved, a kind of space frame, with very
thin  bones  that  get  thicker  at  the  ends.  The  main  survival  problem  for  the
vulture  is  to  develop  strength  in  the  wing  (which  is  under  tremendous
bending  movement  when  the  bird  is  flying)  without  building  up  weight,  as
that  would  limit  its  mobility.  Through  evolution  the  vulture  has  the  most
efficient structure one can imagine—a space frame in bone.

“For  each  aspect  of  life  there  are  responses  of  form,”  Safdie  writes,  noting
that the maple and the elm have wide leaves to absorb the maximum amount of
sun  for  survival  in  a  temperate  climate,  whereas  the  olive  tree  has  a  leaf  that
rotates because it must preserve moisture and can’t absorb heat, and the cactus
turns itself perpendicular to light. We can all picture a maple leaf and a cactus
plant. With every hard principle, Safdie gives us a simple illustration:

Economy and survival are the two key words in nature. Examined out of
context,  the  neck  of  the  giraffe  seems  uneconomically  long,  but  it  is
economical in view of the fact that most of the giraffe’s food is high on the
tree.  Beauty  as  we  understand  it,  and  as  we  admire  it  in  nature,  is  never
arbitrary.

Or  take  this  article  about  bats,  by  Diane  Ackerman.  Most  of  us  know  only
three  facts  about  bats:  they’re  mammals,  we  don’t  like  them,  and  they’ve  got
some kind of radar that enables them to fly at night without bumping into things.
Obviously  anyone  writing  about  bats  must  soon  get  around  to  explaining  how
that  mechanism  of  “echo-location”  works.  In  the  following  passage  Ackerman
gives  us  details  so  precise—and  so  easy  to  relate  to  what  we  know—that  the
process becomes a pleasure to read about:

It’s not hard to understand echo-location if you picture bats as calling or
whistling  to  their  prey  with  high-frequency  sounds.  Most  of  us  can’t  hear
these. At our youngest and keenest of ear, we might detect sounds of 20,000
vibrations a second, but bats can vocalize at up to 200,000. They do it not in a
steady stream but at intervals—20 or 30 times a second. A bat listens for the
sounds to return to it, and when the echoes start coming faster and louder it
knows  that  the  insect  it’s  stalking  has  flown  nearer.  By  judging  the  time
between  echoes,  a  bat  can  tell  how  fast  the  prey  is  moving  and  in  which
direction.  Some  bats  are  sensitive  enough  to  register  a  beetle  walking  on
sand, and some can detect the movement of a moth flexing its wings as it sits
on a leaf.

That’s  my  idea  of  sensitive;  I  couldn’t  ask  a  writer  to  give  me  two  more
wonderful  examples.  But  there’s  more  to  my  admiration  than  gratitude.  I  also
wonder:  how  many  other  examples  of  bat  sensitivity  did  she  collect—dozens?
hundreds?—to  be  able  to  choose  those  two?  Always  start  with  too  much
material. Then give your reader just enough.

As the bat closes in, it may shout faster, to pinpoint its prey. And there’s a
qualitative difference between a steady, solid echo bouncing off a brick wall
and the light, fluid echo from a swaying flower. By shouting at the world and
listening  to  the  echoes,  bats  can  compose  a  picture  of  their  landscape  and
the  objects  in  it  which  includes  texture,  density,  motion,  distance,  size  and
probably other features, too. Most bats really belt it out; we just don’t hear
them. This is an eerie thought when one stands in a silent grove filled with
bats. They spend their whole lives yelling. They yell at their loved ones, they
yell  at  their  enemies,  they  yell  at  their  dinner,  they  yell  at  the  big,  bustling
world. Some yell faster, some slower, some louder, some softer. Long-eared
bats  don’t  need  to  yell;  they  can  hear  their  echoes  perfectly  well  if  they
whisper.

Another  way  of  making  science  accessible  is  to  write  like  a  person  and  not
like a scientist. It’s the same old question of being yourself. Just because you’re
dealing  with  a  scholarly  discipline  that’s  usually  reported  in  a  style  of  dry
pedantry  is  no  reason  why  you  shouldn’t  write  in  good  fresh  English.  Loren
Eiseley was a naturalist who refused to be cowed by nature as he passed on to
us, in The Immense Journey, not only his knowledge but his enthusiasms:

I  have  long  been  an  admirer  of  the  octopus.  The  cephalopods  are  very
old,  and  they  have  slipped,  protean,  through  many  shapes.  They  are  the
wisest of the mollusks, and I have always felt it to be just as well for us that
they never came ashore, but—there are other things that have.

There is no need to be frightened. It is true that some of the creatures are

odd, but I find the situation rather heartening than otherwise. It gives one a
feeling of confidence to see nature still busy with experiments, still dynamic,
and  not  through  or  satisfied  because  a  Devonian  fish  managed  to  end  as  a
two-legged  character  with  a  straw  hat.  There  are  other  things  brewing  and
growing in the oceanic vat. It pays to know this. It pays to know there is just
as much future as past. The only thing that doesn’t pay is to be sure of man’s
own part in it.

Eiseley’s  gift  is  that  he  helps  us  to  feel  what  it’s  like  to  be  a  scientist.  The
central transaction in his writing is the naturalist’s love affair with nature, just as
in  Lewis  Thomas’s  writing  it’s  the  cell  biologist’s  love  of  the  cell.  “Watching
television,” Dr. Thomas wrote in his elegant book Lives of a Cell, “you’d think we
lived at bay, in total jeopardy, surrounded on all sides by human-seeking germs,
shielded against infection and death only by a chemical technology that enables
us  to  keep  killing  them  off.  We  explode  clouds  of  aerosol,  mixed  for  good  luck
with deodorants, into our noses, mouths, underarms, privileged crannies—even
into the intimate insides of our telephones.” But even at our most paranoid, he
says,  “we  have  always  been  a  relatively  minor  interest  of  the  vast  microbial
world. The man who catches a meningococcus is in considerably less danger for
his life, even without chemotherapy, than the meningococci with the bad luck to
catch a man.”

Lewis Thomas was scientific proof that scientists can write as well as anybody
else. It’s not necessary to be a “writer” to write well. We think of Rachel Carson
as  a  writer  because  she  launched  the  environmental  movement  with  a  book,
Silent Spring. But Carson wasn’t a writer; she was a marine biologist who wrote
well. She wrote well because she was a clear thinker and had a passion for her
subject. Charles Darwin’s The Voyage of the Beagle is not only a classic of natural
history;  it’s  a  classic  of  literature,  its  sentences  striding  forward  with  vividness
and vigor. If you’re a student with a bent for science or technology, don’t assume
that  the  English  department  has  a  monopoly  on  “literature.”  Every  scientific
discipline  has  a  fine  literature  of  its  own.  Read  the  scientists  who  write  well  in
fields  that  interest  you—for  example,  Primo  Levi  (The  Periodic  Table),  Peter
Medawar (Pluto’s Republic), Oliver Sacks (The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a
Hat),  Stephen  Jay  Gould  (The  Panda’s  Thumb),  S.  M.  Ulam  (Adventures  of  a
Mathematician),  Paul  Davies  (God  and  the  New  Physics),  Freeman  Dyson
(Weapons  and  Hope)—and  use  them  as  models  for  your  own  writing.  Imitate
their linear style, their avoidance of technical jargon, their constant relating of an
arcane process to something any reader can visualize.

Here’s an article called “The Future of the Transistor,” in Scientific American,
by  Robert  W.  Keyes,  who  holds  a  doctorate  in  physics  and  is  a  specialist  in
semiconductors  and  information-processing  systems.  About  98  percent  of
people who hold a doctorate in physics can’t write their way out of a petri dish,
but that’s not because they can’t. It’s because they won’t. They won’t deign to

learn to use the simple tools of the English language—precision instruments as
refined as any that are used in a physics lab. This is Keyes’s lead:

I  am  writing  this  article  on  a  computer  that  contains  some  10  million
transistors, an astounding number of manufactured items for one person to
own. Yet they cost less than the hard disk, the keyboard, the display and the
cabinet.  Ten  million  staples,  in  contrast,  would  cost  about  as  much  as  the
entire  computer.  Transistors  have  become  this  cheap  because  during  the
past 40 years engineers have learned to etch ever more of them on a single
wafer of silicon. The cost of a given manufacturing step can thus be spread
over a growing number of units.

How much longer can this trend continue? Scholars and industry experts
have declared many times in the past that some physical limit exists beyond
which  miniaturization  could  not  go.  An  equal  number  of  times  they  have
been confounded by the facts. No such limit can be discerned in the quantity
of transistors that can be fabricated on silicon, which has proceeded through
eight orders of magnitude in the 46 years since the transistor was invented.

Take one more look at the sequential style. You’ll see a scientist leading you
in  logical  steps,  one  sentence  after  another,  along  the  path  of  the  story  he  set
out to tell. He is also enjoying himself and therefore writing enjoyably.

I’ve  quoted  from  so  many  writers,  writing  about  so  many  facets  of  the
physical  world,  to  show  that  they  all  come  across  first  as  people:  men  and
women  finding  a  common  thread  of  humanity  between  themselves  and  their
specialty  and  their  readers.  You  can  achieve  the  same  rapport,  whatever  your
subject.  The  principle  of  sequential  writing  applies  to  every  field  where  the
reader must be escorted over difficult new terrain. Think of all the areas where
biology  and  chemistry  are  intertwined  with  politics,  economics,  ethics  and
religion: AIDS, abortion, asbestos, drugs, gene splicing, geriatrics, global warming,
health  care,  nuclear  energy,  pollution,  toxic  waste,  steroids,  cloning,  surrogate
motherhood and dozens of others. Only through clear writing by experts can the
rest of us make educated choices as citizens in these areas where we have little
or no education.

I’ll  close  with  an  example  that  sums  up  everything  this  chapter  has  been
about.  Reading  in  my  morning  paper  about  the  National  Magazine  Awards  for
1993, I saw that the winner in the highly prized category of reporting, edging out
such  heavyweights  as  The  Atlantic  Monthly,  Newsweek,  The  New  Yorker  and
Vanity Fair, was a magazine called I.E.E.E. Spectrum, which I had never heard of.
It  turned  out  to  be  the  flagship  magazine  of  the  Institute  of  Electrical  and
Electronics  Engineers,  a  professional  association  with  320,000  members.
According  to  its  editor,  Donald  Christiansen,  the  magazine  was  once  full  of
integral  signs  and  acronyms,  its  articles  often  unfathomable  even  to  other
engineers. “There are 37 different identifiable disciplines within I.E.E.E.,” he said.

“If  you  can’t  describe  something  in  words,  our  own  people  can’t  understand
each other.”

In  making  his  magazine  accessible  to  320,000  engineers,  Christiansen  also
made  it  accessible  to  the  general  reader,  as  I  found  when  I  tracked  down  the
award-winning  article,  “How  Iraq  Reverse-Engineered  the  Bomb,”  by  Glenn
Zorpette.  It’s  as  good  a  piece  of  investigative  reporting  as  I’ve  read—the  best
kind of nonfiction writing in the service of informed public knowledge.

Constructed like a detective story, it describes the efforts of the International
Atomic  Energy  Agency  (I.A.E.A.)  to  monitor  the  secret  program  whereby  the
Iraqis almost built an atomic bomb and to explain how they came so close. Thus
the article was both a work of science history and a political document, one that
was still hot, for Iraqi research was conducted—and presumably continued until
the fall of Saddam Hussein—in violation of the I.A.E.A.’s disclosure rules; much of
the bomb-making material was illicitly acquired from various industrial nations,
including the United States. The Spectrum article focuses on a technique known
as E.M.I.S. (electromagnetic isotope separation), which was being carried out at
a research complex south of Baghdad called Al Tuwaitha:

The  EMIS  program  surprised  not  only  the  IAEA,  but  the  Western
intelligence  agencies.  With  this  technique  a  stream  of  uranium  ions  is
deflected  by  electromagnets  in  a  vacuum  chamber.  The  chamber  and  its
associated  equipment  are  called  a  calutron.  The  heavier  U–238  ions  are
deflected  less  than  the  U–235  ions,  and  this  slight  difference  is  used  to
separate  out  the  fissile  U–235.  However,  “what  in  theory  is  a  very  efficient
procedure  is  in  practice  a  very,  very  messy  affair,”  said  Leslie  Thorne,  who
recently  retired  as  field  activities  manager  on  the  IAEA  action  team.
Invariably, some U–238 ions remain mixed with the U–235, and ion streams
can be hard to control.

O.K.  That’s  very  clear.  But  why  is  the  process  so  messy?  Why  are  the  ion
streams hard to control? The writer obliges. He never forgets where he left his
readers in the previous paragraph and what they want to know next.

The  two  different  isotopic  materials  accumulate  in  cup-shaped  graphite
containers.  But  their  accumulation  in  the  two  containers  can  be  thrown  off
wildly  by  small  variations  in  the  power  to,  and  temperature  of,  the
electromagnets.  Thus  in  practice  the  materials  tend  to  spatter  all  over  the
inside of the vacuum chamber, which must be cleaned after every few dozen
hours of operation.

That’s  anybody’s  idea  of  messy.  But  has  this  process,  nevertheless,  ever

worked?

Hundreds  of  magnets  and  tens  of  millions  of  watts  are  needed.  During
the  Manhattan  Project,  for  example,  the  Y–12  EMIS  facility  at  Oak  Ridge  in
Tennessee  used  more  power  than  Canada,  plus  the  entire  U.S.  stockpile  of
silver; the latter was used to wind the many electromagnets required (copper
was needed elsewhere in the war effort). Mainly because of such problems,
U.S. scientists believed that no country would ever turn to EMIS to produce
the  relatively  large  amounts  of  enriched  material  needed  for  atomic
weapons....

The  discovery  of  the  Iraqi  EMIS  program  had  much  of  the  drama  of  a
good  spy  novel.  The  first  clue  apparently  came  in  the  clothing  of  U.S.
hostages held by Iraqi forces at Tuwaitha. After the hostages were released,
their clothes were analyzed by intelligence experts, who found infinitesimal
samples of nuclear materials with isotopic concentrations producible only in
a calutron....

“Suddenly  we  found  a  live  dinosaur,”  said  Demetrios  Perricos,  deputy

head of the IAEA’s Iraq action team.

Even in the midst of such high technology the writer never loses the human
ingredient.  This  isn’t  a  story  about  “science”;  it’s  a  story  about  people  doing
science—a gang of clandestine bomb-makers and a team of high-tech cops. The
quote about the dinosaur is pure gold, a metaphor we can all understand. Even a
child knows that dinosaurs aren’t around anymore.

With  the  inevitability  of  good  detective  work,  the  article  builds  to  the
outcome that has been the whole point of the investigation: the discovery that
Iraq, “not limiting itself to producing weapons-grade materials, was concurrently
struggling  to  build  a  deliverable  weapon  around  the  material,  a  daunting  task
known  as  weaponization.”  First  we  are  told  what  options  exist  for  anyone
attempting that task:

The  two  basic  types  of  atomic  bombs  are  gun  devices  and  implosion
weapons. The latter are much more difficult to design and build, but provide
higher  explosive  yields  for  a  given  amount  of  fissile  material.  IAEA
investigators  have  found  no  evidence  that  Iraq  was  actively  pursuing  a  gun
device;  it  is  clear,  they  say,  that  they  concentrated  their  money  and
resources  on  an  implosion  device,  and  had  even  started  work  on  fairly
advanced implosion designs.

What’s an implosion device? Read on:

In an implosion device the fissile material is physically compressed by the
force of a shock wave created with conventional explosives. Then, at just the
right  instant,  neutrons  are  released,  initiating  the  ultrafast  fission  chain
reaction—an  atomic  blast.  Thus  the  main  elements  of  an  implosion  device

are  a  firing  system,  an  explosive  assembly,  and  the  core.  The  firing  system
includes  vacuum-tube-based,  high-energy  discharge  devices  called  krytons
that  are  capable  of  releasing  enough  energy  to  detonate  the  conventional
explosive. The explosive assembly includes “lenses” that precisely focus the
spherical,  imploding  shock  wave  on  the  fissile  core,  within  which  is  a
neutronic initiator. The IAEA had amassed ample evidence that the Iraqis had
made progress in each of these areas.

Speaking  of  compression,  that  paragraph  is  a  gem  of  tight  linear  writing,
successively  explaining  the  implosion  device  and  its  three  main  elements.  But
how (we now want to know) was the I.A.E.A.’s evidence amassed?

Iraq’s  attempts  to  import  krytons  from  CSI  Technologies,  Inc.,  San
Marcos, Calif., made news in March 1990, when two Iraqis were arrested at
London’s  Heathrow  airport  after  an  18-month  “sting”  operation  involving
U.S.  and  British  Customs.  Several  years  before  that,  however,  Iraq  did
manage to get weapons-quality capacitors from other U.S. concerns, and also
produced its own capacitors....

I rest my case—or, rather, I let Spectrum rest it for me. If a scientific subject
of that complexity can be made that clear and robust, in good English, with only
a  few  technical  words,  which  are  quickly  explained  (kryton)  or  can  be  quickly
looked up (fissile), any subject can be made clear and robust by all you writers
who think you’re afraid of science and all you scientists who think you’re afraid
of writing.

Business Writing

Writing in Your Job

If you have to do any writing in your job, this chapter is for you. Just as in science
writing, anxiety is a big part of the problem and humanity and clear thinking are
a big part of the solution.

Although  this  is  a  book  about  writing,  it’s  not  just  for  writers.  Its  principles
apply to everyone who is expected to do some writing as part of his or her daily
employment.  The  memo,  the  business  letter,  the  administrative  report,  the
financial  analysis,  the  marketing  proposal,  the  note  to  the  boss,  the  fax,  the  e-
mail, the Post-it—all the pieces of paper that circulate through your office every
day  are  forms  of  writing.  Take  them  seriously.  Countless  careers  rise  or  fall  on
the  ability  or  the  inability  of  employees  to  state  a  set  of  facts,  summarize  a
meeting or present an idea coherently.

Most  people  work  for  institutions:  businesses,  banks,  insurance  firms,  law
firms, government agencies, school systems, non-profit organizations and other
entities.  Many  of  those  people  are  managers  whose  writing  goes  out  to  the
public:  the  president  addressing  the  stockholders,  the  banker  explaining  a
change  in  procedure,  the  school  principal  writing  a  newsletter  to  parents.
Whoever they are, they tend to be so afraid of writing that their sentences lack
all humanity—and so do their institutions. It’s hard to imagine that these are real
places where real men and women come to work every morning.

But just because people work for an institution, they don’t have to write like
one.  Institutions  can  be  warmed  up.  Administrators  can  be  turned  into  human
beings.  Information  can  be  imparted  clearly  and  without  pomposity.  You  only
have to remember that readers identify with people, not with abstractions like
“profitability,” or with Latinate nouns like “utilization” and “implementation,” or
with  inert  constructions  in  which  nobody  can  be  visualized  doing  something:
“pre-feasibility studies are in the paperwork stage.”

Nobody has made the point better than George Orwell in his translation into

modern bureaucratic fuzz of this famous verse from Ecclesiastes:

I  returned  and  saw  under  the  sun,  that  the  race  is  not  to  the  swift,  nor
the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men
of  understanding,  nor  yet  favor  to  men  of  skill;  but  time  and  chance
happeneth to them all.

Orwell’s version goes:

Objective  consideration  of  contemporary  phenomena  compels  the
conclusion  that  success  or  failure  in  competitive  activities  exhibits  no
tendency to be commensurate with innate capacity, but that a considerable
element of the unpredictable must invariably be taken into account.

First notice how the two passages look. The first one at the top invites us to
read it. The words are short and have air around them; they convey the rhythms
of human speech. The second one is clotted with long words. It tells us instantly
that a ponderous mind is at work. We don’t want to go anywhere with a mind
that expresses itself in such suffocating language. We don’t even start to read.

Also  notice  what  the  two  passages  say.  Gone  from  the  second  one  are  the
short words and vivid images of everyday life—the race and the battle, the bread
and  the  riches—and  in  their  place  have  waddled  the  long  and  flabby  nouns  of
generalized meaning. Gone is any sense of what one person did (“I returned”) or
what he realized (“saw”) about one of life’s central mysteries: the capriciousness
of fate.

Let me illustrate how this disease infects the writing that most people do in
their jobs. I’ll use school principals as my first example, not because they are the
worst offenders (they aren’t) but because I happen to have such an example. My
points,  however,  are  intended  for  all  the  men  and  women  who  work  in  all  the
organizations where language has lost its humanity and nobody knows what the
people in charge are talking about.

My  encounter  with  the  principals  began  when  I  got  a  call  from  Ernest  B.
Fleishman, superintendent of schools in Greenwich, Connecticut. “We’d like you
to come and ‘dejargonize’ us,” he said. “We don’t think we can teach students to
write unless all of us at the top of the school system clean up our own writing.”
He said he would send me some typical materials that had originated within the
system. His idea was for me to analyze the writing and then conduct a workshop.
What appealed to me was the willingness of Dr. Fleishman and his colleagues
to  make  themselves  vulnerable;  vulnerability  has  a  strength  of  its  own.  We
decided on a date, and soon a fat envelope arrived. It contained various internal
memos  and  mimeographed  newsletters  that  had  been  mailed  to  parents  from
the town’s 16 elementary, junior and senior high schools.

The  newsletters  had  a  cheery  and  informal  look.  Obviously  the  system  was
making  an  effort  to  communicate  warmly  with  its  families.  But  even  at  first
glance certain chilly phrases caught my eye (“prioritized evaluative procedures,”

“modified  departmentalized  schedule”),  and  one  principal  promised  that  his
school  would  provide  “enhanced  positive  learning  environments.”  Just  as
obviously the system wasn’t communicating as warmly as it thought it was.

I studied the principals’ material and divided it into good and bad examples.
On  the  appointed  morning  in  Greenwich  I  found  40  principals  and  curriculum
coordinators  assembled  and  eager  to  learn.  I  told  them  I  could  only  applaud
them for submitting to a process that so threatened their identity. In the national
clamor  over  why  Johnny  can’t  write,  Dr.  Fleishman  was  the  first  adult  in  my
experience who admitted that youth has no monopoly on verbal sludge.

I told the principals that we want to think of the men and women who run
our  children’s  schools  as  people  not  unlike  ourselves.  We  are  suspicious  of
pretentiousness,  of  all  the  fad  words  that  the  social  scientists  have  coined  to
avoid making themselves clear to ordinary mortals. I urged them to be natural.
How we write and how we talk is how we define ourselves.

I  asked  them  to  listen  to  how  they  were  defining  themselves  to  the
community. I had made copies of certain bad examples, changing the names of
the  schools  and  the  principals.  I  explained  that  I  would  read  some  of  the
examples  aloud.  Later  we  would  see  if  they  could  turn  what  they  had  written
into plain English. This was my first example:

Dear Parent:

We  have  established  a  special  phone  communication  system  to  provide
additional opportunities for parent input. During this year we will give added
emphasis  to  the  goal  of  communication  and  utilize  a  variety  of  means  to
accomplish this goal. Your inputs, from the unique position as a parent, will
help us to plan and implement an educational plan that meets the needs of
your child. An open dialogue, feedback and sharing of information between
parents  and  teachers  will  enable  us  to  work  with  your  child  in  the  most
effective manner.

DR. GEORGE B. JONES
Principal

That’s the kind of communication I don’t want to receive, unique though my
parent  inputs  might  be.  I  want  to  be  told  that  the  school  is  going  to  make  it
easier  for  me  to  telephone  the  teachers  and  that  they  hope  I’ll  call  often  to
discuss how my children are getting along. Instead the parent gets junk: “special
the  goal  of
phone
communication,”  “plan  and  implement  an  educational  plan.”  As  for  “open
dialogue,  feedback  and  sharing  of  information,”  they  are  three  ways  of  saying
the same thing.

“added  emphasis

Dr. Jones is clearly a man who means well, and his plan is one we all want: a
chance  to  pick  up  the  phone  and  tell  the  principal  what  a  great  kid  Johnny  is

despite that unfortunate incident in the playground last Tuesday. But Dr. Jones
doesn’t sound like a person I want to call. In fact, he doesn’t sound like a person.
His message could have been tapped out by a computer. He is squandering a rich
resource: himself.

Another example I chose was a “Principal’s Greeting” sent to parents at the

start of the school year. It consisted of two paragraphs that were very different:

Fundamentally, Foster is a good school. Pupils who require help in certain
subjects  or  study  skills  areas  are  receiving  special  attention.  In  the  school
year  ahead  we  seek  to  provide  enhanced  positive  learning  environments.
Children,  and  staff,  must  work  in  an  atmosphere  that  is  conducive  to
learning.  Wide  varieties  of  instructional  materials  are  needed.  Careful
attention  to  individual  abilities  and  learning  styles  is  required.  Cooperation
between school and home is extremely important to the learning process. All
of us should be aware of desired educational objectives for every child.

Keep informed about what is planned for our children this year and let us
know about your own questions and about any special needs your child may
have. I have met many of you in the first few weeks. Please continue to stop
in  to  introduce  yourself  or  to  talk  about  Foster.  I  look  forward  to  a  very
productive year for all of us.

DR. RAY B. DAWSON
Principal

In  the  second  paragraph  I’m  being  greeted  by  a  person;  in  the  first  I’m
hearing from an educator. I like the real Dr. Dawson of Paragraph 2. He talks in
warm  and  comfortable  phrases:  “Keep  informed,”  “let  us  know,”  “I  have  met,”
“Please continue,” “I look forward.”

By contrast, Educator Dawson of Paragraph 1 never uses “I” or even suggests
a sense of “I.” He falls back on the jargon of his profession, where he feels safe,
not stopping to notice that he really isn’t telling the parent anything. What are
“study  skills  areas,”  and  how  do  they  differ  from  “subjects”?  What  are
“enhanced  positive  learning  environments,”  and  how  do  they  differ  from  “an
atmosphere  that  is  conducive  to  learning”?  What  are  “wide  varieties  of
instructional  materials”:  pencils,  textbooks,  filmstrips?  What  exactly  are
“learning styles”? What “educational objectives” are “desired”?

The second paragraph, in short, is warm and personal; the other is pedantic
and  vague.  That  was  a  pattern  I  found  repeatedly.  Whenever  the  principals
wrote to notify the parents of some human detail, they wrote with humanity:

It seems that traffic is beginning to pile up again in front of the school. If
you can possibly do so, please come to the rear of the school for your child at
the end of the day.

I  would  appreciate  it  if  you  would  speak  with  your  children  about  their
behavior in the cafeteria. Many of you would be totally dismayed if you could
observe  the  manners  of  your  children  while  they  are  eating.  Check
occasionally to see if they owe money for lunch. Sometimes children are very
slow in repaying.

But  when  the  educators  wrote  to  explain  how  they  proposed  to  do  their

educating, they vanished without a trace:

In this document you will find the program goals and objectives that have
been identified and prioritized. Evaluative procedures for the objectives were
also established based on acceptable criteria.

Prior  to  the  implementation  of  the  above  practice,  students  were  given
very  little  exposure  to  multiple  choice  questions.  It  is  felt  that  the  use  of
practice questions correlated to the unit that a student is presently studying
has had an extremely positive effect as the test scores confirm.

After I had read various good and bad examples, the principals began to hear
the difference between their true selves and their educator selves. The problem
was  how  to  close  the  gap.  I  recited  my  four  articles  of  faith:  clarity,  simplicity,
brevity and humanity. I explained about using active verbs and avoiding “concept
nouns.” I told them not to use the special vocabulary of education as a crutch;
almost any subject can be made accessible in good English.

These  were  all  basic  tenets,  but  the  principals  wrote  them  down  as  if  they
had never heard them before—and maybe they hadn’t, or at least not for many
years.  Perhaps  that’s  why  bureaucratic  prose  becomes  so  turgid,  whatever  the
bureaucracy. Once an administrator rises to a certain level, nobody ever points
out to him again the beauty of a simple declarative sentence, or shows him how
his writing has become swollen with pompous generalizations.

Finally  our  workshop  got  down  to  work.  I  distributed  my  copies  and  asked
the principals to rewrite the more knotty sentences. It was a grim moment. They
had met the enemy for the first time. They scribbled on their pads and scratched
out  what  they  had  scribbled.  Some  didn’t  write  anything.  Some  crumpled  their
paper.  They  began  to  look  like  writers.  An  awful  silence  hung  over  the  room,
broken only by the crossing out of sentences and the crumpling of paper. They
began to sound like writers.

As  the  day  went  on,  they  slowly  relaxed.  They  began  to  write  in  the  first
person and to use active verbs. For a while they still couldn’t loose their grip on
long words and vague nouns (“parent communication response”). But gradually
their  sentences  became  human.  When  I  asked  them  to  tackle  “Evaluative
procedures  for  the  objectives  were  also  established  based  on  acceptable
criteria,”  one  of  them  wrote:  “At  the  end  of  the  year  we  will  evaluate  our

progress.” Another wrote: “We will see how well we have succeeded.”

That’s the kind of plain talk a parent wants. It’s also what stockholders want
from their corporation, what customers want from their bank, what the widow
wants  from  the  agency  that’s  handling  her  social  security.  There  is  a  deep
yearning for human contact and a resentment of bombast. Recently I got a “Dear
Customer” letter from the company that supplies my computer needs. It began:
“Effective March 30 we will be migrating our end user order entry and supplies
referral processing to a new telemarketing center.” I finally figured out that they
had  a  new  800  number  and  that  the  end  user  was  me.  Any  organization  that
won’t  take  the  trouble  to  be  both  clear  and  personal  in  its  writing  will  lose
friends,  customers  and  money.  Let  me  put  it  another  way  for  business
executives: a shortfall will be experienced in anticipated profitability.

Here’s  an  example  of  how  companies  throw  away  their  humanity  with
pretentious
language.  It’s  a  “customer  bulletin”  distributed  by  a  major
corporation.  The  sole  purpose  of  a  customer  bulletin  is  to  give  helpful
information to a customer. This one begins: “Companies are increasingly turning
to capacity planning techniques to determine when future processing loads will
exceed  processing  capabilities.”  That  sentence  is  no  favor  to  the  customer;  it’s
congealed with Orwellian nouns like “capacity” and “capabilities” that convey no
procedures that a customer can picture. What are capacity planning techniques?
Whose  capacity  is  being  planned?  By  whom?  The  second  sentence  says:
“Capacity planning adds objectivity to the decision-making process.” More dead
nouns.  The  third  sentence  says:  “Management  is  given  enhanced  decision
participation in key areas of information system resources.”

The customer has to stop after every sentence and translate it. The bulletin
might as well be in Hungarian. He starts with the first sentence—the one about
capacity  planning  techniques.  Translated,  that  means  “It  helps  to  know  when
you’re  giving  your  computer  more  than  it  can  handle.”  The  second  sentence
—“Capacity  planning  adds  objectivity  to  the  decision-making  process”—means
you should know the facts before you decide. The third sentence—the one about
enhanced  decision  participation—means  “The  more  you  know  about  your
system, the better it will work.” It could also mean several other things.

But the customer isn’t going to keep translating. Soon he’s going to look for
another company. He thinks, “If these guys are so smart, why can’t they tell me
what they do? Maybe they’re not so smart.” The bulletin goes on to say that “for
future  cost  avoidance,  productivity  has  been  enhanced.”  That  seems  to  mean
the product will be free—all costs have been avoided. Next the bulletin assures
the  customer  that  “the  system  is  delivered  with  functionality.”  That  means  it
works. I would hope so.

Finally, at the end, we get a glimmer of humanity. The writer of the bulletin
asks  a  satisfied  customer  why  he  chose  this  system.  The  man  says  he  chose  it
because of the company’s reputation for service. He says: “A computer is like a
sophisticated  pencil.  You  don’t  care  how  it  works,  but  if  it  breaks  you  want

someone  there  to  fix  it.”  Notice  how  refreshing  that  sentence  is  after  all  the
garbage that preceded it: in its language (comfortable words), in its details that
we  can  visualize  (the  pencil),  and  in  its  humanity.  The  writer  has  taken  the
coldness  out  of  a  technical  process  by  relating  it  to  an  experience  we’re  all
familiar with: waiting for the repairman when something breaks. I’m reminded of
a  sign  I  saw  in  the  New  York  subway  that  proves  that  even  a  huge  municipal
bureaucracy  can  talk  to  its  constituents  humanely:  “If  you  ride  the  subway
regularly you may have seen signs directing you to trains you’ve never heard of
before. These are only new names for very familiar trains.”

Still,  plain  talk  will  not  be  easily  achieved  in  corporate  America.  Too  much
vanity is on the line. Managers at every level are prisoners of the notion that a
simple  style  reflects  a  simple  mind.  Actually  a  simple  style  is  the  result  of  hard
work and hard thinking; a muddled style reflects a muddled thinker or a person
too arrogant, or too dumb, or too lazy to organize his thoughts. Remember that
what  you  write  is  often  the  only  chance  you’ll  get  to  present  yourself  to
someone whose business or money or good will you need. If what you write is
ornate, or pompous, or fuzzy, that’s how you’ll be perceived. The reader has no
other choice.

I learned about corporate America by venturing out into it, after Greenwich,
to  conduct  workshops  for  some  major  corporations,  which  also  asked  to  be
dejargonized. “We don’t even understand our own memos anymore,” they told
me. I worked with the men and women who write the vast amounts of material
these  companies  generate  for  internal  and  external  consumption.  The  internal
material  consists  of  house  organs  and  newsletters  whose  purpose  is  to  tell
employees  what’s  happening  at  their  “facility”  and  to  give  them  a  sense  of
belonging.  The  external  material  includes  the  glossy  magazines  and  annual
reports  that  go  to  stockholders,  the  speeches  delivered  by  executives,  the
releases  sent  to  the  press,  and  the  consumer  manuals  that  explain  how  the
product  works.  I  found  almost  all  of  it  lacking  in  human  juices  and  much  of  it
impenetrable.

Typical of the sentences in the newsletters was this one:

Announced concurrently with the above enhancements were changes to
the  System  Support  Program,  a  program  product  which  operates
in
conjunction  with  the  NCP.  Among  the  additional  functional  enhancements
are dynamic reconfiguration and inter-systems communications.

There’s no joy for the writer in such work, and certainly none for the reader.
It’s language out of Star Trek, and if I were an employee I wouldn’t be cheered—
or informed—by these efforts to raise my morale. I would stop reading them. I
told  the  corporate  writers  they  had  to  find  the  people  behind  the  fine
achievements  being  described.  “Go  to  the  engineer  who  conceived  the  new
system,”  I  said,  “or  to  the  designer  who  designed  it,  or  to  the  technician  who

assembled it, and get them to tell you in their own words how the idea came to
them, or how they put it together, or how it will be used by real people in the
real  world.”  The  way  to  warm  up  any  institution  is  to  locate  the  missing  “I.”
Remember: “I” is the most interesting element in any story.

The writers explained that they often did interview the engineer but couldn’t
get  him  to  talk  English.  They  showed  me  some  typical  quotes.  The  engineers
spoke  in  an  arcane  language  studded  with  acronyms  (“Sub-system  support  is
available only with VSAG or TNA”). I said that the writers had to keep going back
to the engineer until he finally made himself intelligible. They said the engineer
didn’t want to be made intelligible: if he spoke too simply he would look like a
jerk  to  his  peers.  I  said  that  their  responsibility  was  to  the  facts  and  to  the
reader, not to the vanity of the engineer. I urged them to believe in themselves
as  writers  and  not  to  relinquish  control.  They  replied  that  this  was  easier  said
than  done  in  hierarchical  corporations,  where  approval  of  written  reports  is
required  at  a  succession  of  higher  levels.  I  sensed  an  undercurrent  of  fear:  do
things  the  company  way  and  don’t  risk  your  job  trying  to  make  the  company
human.

High executives were equally victimized by wanting to sound important. One
corporation  had  a  monthly  newsletter  to  enable  “management”  to  share  its
concerns with middle managers and lower employees. Prominent in every issue
was  a  message  of  exhortation  from  the  division  vice-president,  whom  I’ll  call
Thomas  Bell.  Judging  by  his  monthly  message,  he  was  a  pompous  ass,  saying
nothing and saying it in inflated verbiage.

When  I  mentioned  this,  the  writers  said  that  Thomas  Bell  was  actually  a
diffident man and a good executive. They pointed out that he doesn’t write the
message  himself;  it’s  written  for  him.  I  said  that  Mr.  Bell  was  being  done  a
disservice—that the writers should go to him every month (with a tape recorder,
if  necessary)  and  stay  there  until  he  talked  about  his  concerns  in  the  same
language he would use when he got home and talked to Mrs. Bell.

What  I  realized  was  that  most  executives  in  America  don’t  write  what
appears  over  their  signature  or  what  they  say  in  their  speeches.  They  have
surrendered  the  qualities  that  make  them  unique.  If  they  and  their  institutions
seem cold, it’s because they acquiesce in the process of being pumped up and
dried out. Preoccupied with their high technology, they forget that some of the
most powerful tools they possess—for good and for bad—are words.

If  you  work  for  an  institution,  whatever  your  job,  whatever  your  level,  be
yourself when you write. You will stand out as a real person among the robots,
and your example might even persuade Thomas Bell to write his own stuff.

Sports

As an addict of the sports pages in my boyhood, I learned about the circuit clout
before  I  learned  about  the  electrical  circuit.  I  learned  that  a  hurler  (or  twirler)
who  faces  left  when  he  toes  the  slab  is  a  southpaw  or  a  portsider.  Southpaws
were always lanky, portsiders always chunky, though I’ve never heard “chunky”
applied to anything else except peanut butter (to distinguish it from “creamy”),
and I have no idea what a chunky person would look like. When hurlers fired the
old  horsehide,  a  batsman  would  try  to  solve  their  slants.  If  he  succeeded  he
might  rap  a  sharp  bingle  to  the  outfield,  garnering  a  win  for  the  home
contingent,  or  at  least  knotting  the  count.  If  not,  he  might  bounce  into  a  twin
killing, snuffing out a rally and dimming his team’s hopes in the flag scramble.

I could go on, mining every sport for its lingo and extracting from the mother
lode a variety of words found nowhere else in the mother tongue. I could write
of  hoopsters  and  pucksters,  grapplers  and  matmen,  strapping  oarsmen  and
gridiron greats. I could rhapsodize about the old pigskin—more passionately than
any  pig  farmer—and  describe  the  frenzied  bleacherites  caught  up  in  the
excitement of the autumn classic. I could, in short, write sports English instead of
good  English,  as  if  they  were  two  different  languages.  They’re  not.  Just  as  in
writing about science or any other field, there’s no substitute for the best.

What, you might ask, is wrong with “southpaw”? Shouldn’t we be grateful for
a  word  so  picturesque?  Why  isn’t  it  a  relief  to  have  twirlers  and  circuit  clouts
instead of the same old pitchers and home runs? The answer is that these words
have become even cheaper currency than the coins they were meant to replace.
They  come  flooding  automatically  out  of  the  typewriter  of  every  scribe
(sportswriter) in every press box.

The man who first thought of “southpaw” had a right to be pleased. I like to
think he allowed himself the small smile that is the due of anyone who invents a
good novelty. But how long ago was that? The color that “southpaw” added to
the  language  has  paled  with  decades  of  repetition,  along  with  the  hundreds  of
other  idioms  that  form  the  fabric  of  daily  sportswriting.  There  is  a  weariness
about them. We read the articles to find out who won, but we don’t read them
with enjoyment.

The  best  sportswriters  know  this.  They  avoid  the  exhausted  synonyms  and
strive for freshness elsewhere in their sentences. You can search the columns of
Red  Smith  and  never  find  a  batsman  bouncing  into  a  twin  killing;  Smith  wasn’t
afraid to let a batter hit into a double play. But you will find hundreds of unusual
words—good  English  words—chosen  with  precision  and  fitted  into  situations
where no other sportswriter would put them. They please us because the writer
cared  about  using  fresh  imagery  in  a  journalistic  form  where  his  competitors
settled for the same old stuff. That’s why Red Smith was still king of his field after
half a century of writing, and why his competitors had long since been sent—as
they would be the first to say—to the showers.

I can still remember many phrases in Red Smith’s columns that took me by
surprise with their humor and originality. Smith was a devout angler, and it was a
pleasure to watch him bait his hook and come up with that slippery fish, a sports
commissioner, gasping for air. “In most professional sports the bottom has just
about  dropped  out  of  the  czar  business,”  he  wrote,  noting  that  the  cupidity  of
team owners has a tendency to outrun the courage of the sport’s monitors. “The
first  and  toughest  of  the  [baseball]  overlords  was  Kenesaw  Mountain  Landis,
who came to power in 1920 and ruled with a heavy hand until his death in 1944.
But  if  baseball  started  with  Little  Caesar,  it  wound  up  with  Ethelred  the
Unready.”  Red  Smith  was  the  daily  guardian  of  our  perspective,  a  writer  who
kept  us  honest.  But  that  was  largely  because  he  was  writing  good  English.  His
style was not only graceful; it was strong enough to carry strong convictions.

from  writing  good  English

What  keeps  most  sportswriters

is  the
misapprehension that they shouldn’t be trying to. They have been reared on so
many clichés that they assume they are the required tools of the trade. They also
have  a  dread  of  repeating  the  word  that’s  easiest  for  the  reader  to  visualize—
batter,  runner,  golfer,  boxer—if  a  synonym  can  be  found.  And  usually,  with
exertion, it can. This excerpt from a college newspaper is typical:

Bob Hornsby extended his skein yesterday by toppling Dartmouth’s Jerry
Smithers, 6–4, 6–2, to lead the netmen to victory over a surprisingly strong
foe. The gangling junior put his big serve to good use in keeping the Green
captain off balance. The Memphis native was in top form as he racked up the
first four games, breaking the Indian’s service twice in the first four games.
The Exeter graduate faltered and the Hanover mainstay rallied to cop three
games. But the racquet ace was not to be denied, and the Yankee’s attempt
to  knot  the  first  stanza  at  4–4  failed  when  he  was  passed  by  a  cross-court
volley on the sixth deuce point. The redhead was simply too determined, and
…

What  ever  became  of  Bob  Hornsby?  Or  Jerry  Smithers?  Hornsby  has  been
metamorphosed  within  one  paragraph  into  the  gangling  junior,  the  Memphis
native, the Exeter graduate, the racquet ace and the redhead, and Smithers turns

up  as  the  Green  captain,  the  Indian,  the  Hanover  mainstay  and  the  Yankee.
Readers  don’t  know  them  in  these  various  disguises—or  care.  They  only  want
the  clearest  picture  of  what  happened.  Never  be  afraid  to  repeat  the  player’s
name  and  to  keep  the  details  simple.  A  set  or  an  inning  doesn’t  have  to  be
recycled  into  a  stanza  or  a  frame  just  to  avoid  redundancy.  The  cure  is  worse
than the ailment.

Another obsession is with numbers. Every sports addict lives with a head full
of  statistics,  cross-filed  for  ready  access,  and  many  a  baseball  fan  who  flunked
simple  arithmetic  in  school  can  perform  prodigies  of  instant  calculation  in  the
ballpark. Still, some statistics are more important than others. If a pitcher wins
his  20th  game,  if  a  golfer  shoots  a  61,  if  a  runner  runs  the  mile  in  3:48,  please
mention it. But don’t get carried away:

AUBURN,  Ala.,  Nov.  1

(UPI)—Pat  Sullivan,  Auburn’s  sophomore
quarterback,  scored  two  touchdowns  and  passed  for  two  today  to  hand
Florida a 38–12 defeat, the first of the season for the ninth-ranked Gators.

John  Reaves  of  Florida  broke  two  Southeastern  Conference  records  and
tied another. The tall sophomore from Tampa, Fla., gained 369 yards passing,
pushing  his  six-game  season  total  to  2,115.  That  broke  the  S.E.C.  season
record of 2,012 set by the 1966 Heisman trophy winner, in 10 games.

Reaves attempted 66 passes—an S.E.C. record—and tied the record of 33

completions set this fall by Mississippi’s Archie Manning.

Fortunately  for  Auburn,  nine  of  Reaves’s  passes  were  intercepted—
breaking  the  S.E.C.  record  of  eight  interceptions  suffered  by  Georgia’s  Zeke
Bratkowski against Georgia Tech in 1951.

Reaves’s performance left him only a few yards short of the S.E.C. season
total offense record of 2,187 set by Georgia’s Frank Sinkwich in 11 games in
1942.  And  his  two  touchdown  passes  against  Auburn  left  him  only  one
touchdown  pass  short  of  the  S.E.C.  season  record  of  23  set  in  1950  by
Kentucky’s Babe Parilli …

Those  are  the  first  five  paragraphs  of  a  six-paragraph  story  that  was
prominently  displayed  in  my  New  York  newspaper,  a  long  way  from  Auburn.  It
has  a  certain  mounting  hilarity—a  figure  freak  amok  at  his  typewriter.  But  can
anybody read it? And does anybody care? Only Zeke Bratkowski—finally off the
hook.

Sports  is  one  of  the  richest  fields  now  open  to  the  nonfiction  writer.  Many
authors  better  known  for  “serious”  books  have  done  some  of  their  most  solid
work as observers of athletic combat. John McPhee’s Levels of the Game, George
Plimpton’s  Paper  Lion  and  George  F.  Will’s  Men  at  Work—books  about  tennis,
pro football and baseball—take us deeply into the lives of the players. In mere
detail  they  have  enough  information  to  keep  any  fan  happy.  But  what  makes
them special is their humanity. Who is this strange bird, the winning athlete, and

what engines keep him going? One of the classics in the literature of baseball is
“Hub Fans Bid Kid Adieu,” John Updike’s account of Ted Williams’s final game, on
September 28, 1960, when the 42-year-old “Kid,” coming up for his last time at
bat in Fenway Park, hit one over the wall. But before that Updike has distilled the
essence of “this brittle and temperamental player”:

… of all team sports, baseball, with its graceful intermittences of action,
its immense and tranquil field sparsely settled with poised men in white, its
dispassionate  mathematics,  seems  to  me  best  suited  to  accommodate,  and
be  ornamented  by,  a  loner.  It  is  essentially  a  lonely  game.  No  other  player
visible  to  my  generation  has  concentrated  within  himself  so  much  of  the
sport’s  poignance,  has  so  assiduously  refined  his  natural  skills,  has  so
constantly brought to the plate that intensity of competence that crowds the
throat with joy.

What  gives  the  article  its  depth  is  that  it’s  the  work  of  a  writer,  not  a
sportswriter.  Updike  knows  there’s  not  much  more  to  say  about  Williams’s
matchless  ability  at  the  plate:  the  famous  swing,  the  eyes  that  could  see  the
stitches on a ball arriving at 90 miles an hour. But the mystery of the man is still
unsolved, even on the final day of his career, and that’s where Updike steers our
attention,  suggesting  that  baseball  was  suited  to  such  a  reclusive  star  because
it’s a lonely game. Baseball lonely? Our great American tribal rite? Think about it,
Updike says.

Something in Updike made contact with something in Williams: two solitary
craftsmen  laboring  in  the  glare  of  the  crowd.  Look  for  this  human  bond.
Remember  that  athletes  are  men  and  women  who  become  part  of  our  lives
during the season, acting out our dreams or filling some other need for us, and
we  want  that  bond  to  be  honored.  Hold  the  hype  and  give  us  heroes  who  are
believable.

Even Babe Ruth was ushered down from the sanitized slopes of Olympus and
converted  into  a  real  person,  with  appetites  as  big  as  his  girth,  in  Robert
Creamer’s fine biography Babe. The same qualities would go into Creamer’s later
book,  Stengel.  Until  then  readers  willingly  settled  for  the  standard  version  of
Casey  Stengel  as  an  aging  pantaloon  who  mangled  the  language  and  somehow
managed  to  win  10  pennants.  Creamer’s  Stengel  is  far  more  interesting:  a
complex man who was nobody’s fool and whose story is very much the story of
baseball itself, stretching back to 19th-century rural America.

Honest  portraiture  is  only  one  of  many  new  realities  in  what  used  to  be  a
fairy-tale world. Sport is now a major frontier of social change, and some of the
nation’s most vexing issues—drug abuse and steroids, crowd violence, women’s
rights, minorities in management, television contracts—are being played out in
our stadiums, grandstands and locker rooms. If you want to write about America,
this  is  one  place  to  pitch  your  tent.  Take  a  hard  look  at  such  stories  as  the

financial  seduction  of  school  and  college  athletes.  It’s  far  more  than  a  sports
story.  It’s  the  story  of  our  values  and  our  priorities  in  the  education  of  our
children. King Football and King Basketball sit secure on their throne. How many
coaches get paid more than the college president, the school principal and the
teachers?

is  the

Money

looming  monster

in  American  sport,

its  dark  shadow
everywhere.  Salaries  of  obscene  magnitude  swim  through  the  sports  section,
which now contains almost as much financial news as the financial section. How
much  money  a  player  earned  for  winning  a  golf  or  tennis  tournament  is
mentioned  in  the  lead  of  the  story,  ahead  of  the  score.  Big  money  has  also
brought big emotional trouble. Much of today’s sports reporting has nothing to
do  with  sport.  First  we  have  to  be  told  whose  feelings  are  hurt  because  he’s
being booed by fans who think a $12 million player ought to bat higher than .225
and run after fly balls hit in his direction. In tennis the pot of gold is huge and the
players  are  strung  as  tightly  as  their  high-tech  racquets—millionaires  quick  to
whine and to swear at the referee and the linesmen. In football and basketball
the pay is sky-high, and so are the sulks.

The  ego  of  the  modern  athlete  has  in  turn  rubbed  off  on  the  modern
sportswriter. I’m struck by how many sportswriters now think they are the story,
their  thoughts  more  interesting  than  the  game  they  were  sent  to  cover.  I  miss
the days when reporters had the modesty to come right out and say who won.
Today that news can be a long time in arriving. Half the sportswriters think they
are Guy de Maupassant, masters of the exquisitely delayed lead. The rest think
they  are  Sigmund  Freud,  privy  to  the  athlete’s  psychic  needs  and  wounded
sensibilities.  Some  also  practice  orthopedics  and  arthroscopic  surgery  on  the
side,  quicker  than  the  team  physician  to  assess  what  the  magnetic  resonance
imaging  scan  revealed  or  didn’t  reveal  about  the  pitcher’s  torn  or  perhaps  not
torn rotator cuff. “His condition is day-to-day,” they conclude. Whose condition
isn’t?

The  would-be  Maupassants  specialize  in  episodes  that  took  place  earlier,
which  they  gleaned  by  hanging  around  the  clubhouse  in  search  of  “color.”  No
nugget is too trivial or too boring if it can be cemented into that baroque edifice,
the  lead.  The  following  example  is  one  that  I’ll  invent,  but  every  fan  will
recognize the genre:

Two weeks ago Alex Rodriguez’s grandmother had a dream. She told him
she  dreamed  he  and  some  of  his  Yankee  teammates  went  to  a  Chinese
restaurant  for  dinner.  When  it  came  time  for  dessert,  Rodriguez  asked  the
waiter to bring him a fortune cookie. “Sometimes those things can really tell
it to you straight,” his grandmother said he told Derek Jeter. Unwrapping the
paper message, he saw the words: “You will soon do something powerful to
confound your enemies.”

Maybe  A-Rod  was  thinking  of  his  grandmother’s  dream  last  night  at

Yankee  Stadium  when  he  stepped  to  the  plate  to  face  Red  Sox  ace  Curt
Schilling.  He  was  3-for-27  against  Schilling  in  2004  and  was  mired  in  his
longest  slump  of  the  season.  Nobody  had  to  tell  him  the  fans  were  on  his
case; he had heard the boos. This would be the perfect moment to confound
his enemies. It was the bottom of the eighth, two men were on, and the Sox
were leading, 3–1. Time was running out.

Working  the  count  full,  Rodriguez  got  a  waist-high  slider  from  Schilling
and crunched it. The ball rose in a high arc, and you knew just by watching A-
Rod that he thought the ball might carry to the left-field seats. A strong wind
was swirling into the Stadium, but the fortune cookie’s “something powerful”
was not to be denied, and when Mariano Rivera shut down the Sox in the top
of the ninth, the scoreboard said Yankees 4, Boston 3. Thanks, Granny.

The  would-be  Freuds  are  no  less  eager  to  swagger  before  settling  down.
“Somebody should have told André Agassiz he was into mortality denial before
he took the court yesterday against a foe 20 years his junior,” they write, experts
in human motivation, using words like “predictably futile”—no proper part of a
reporter’s  vocabulary—to  show  their  superiority  over  an  athlete  having  an
inferior  day.  “Last  night  the  Mets  took  the  field  determined  to  find  another
ridiculous way to lose,” the reporter covering that team for my local paper kept
telling me, typically, during a recent lean season, using sarcasm instead of fact.
The  Mets  did  no  such  thing;  no  athlete  sets  out  to  lose.  If  you  want  to  write
about  sports,  remember  that  the  men  and  women  you’re  writing  about  are
doing  something  immensely  difficult,  and  they  have  their  pride.  You,  too,  are
doing a job that has its codes of honor. One of them is that you are not the story.
Red Smith had no patience with self-important sportswriting. He said it was
always  helpful  to  remember  that  baseball  is  a  game  that  little  boys  play.  That
also  goes  for  football  and  basketball  and  hockey  and  tennis  and  most  other
games. The little boys—and girls—who once played those games grow up to be
readers of the sports pages, and in their imagination they are still young, still on
the field and the court and the rink, still playing those games. What they want to
know when they open their newspaper is how the players played and how the
game came out. Please tell us.

One  new  role  for  the  sportswriter  is  to  let  us  know  what  it  feels  like  to
actually perform a sport: to be a marathon runner or a soccer goalie, a skier or a
golfer or a gymnast. The moment is ripe—popular interest in how far the body
can be pushed has never been higher. Americans are on a health kick, keeping fit
on  fitness  machines,  calibrating  every  nuance  of  weight  gain  and  weight  loss,
pulmonary  intake  and  cardiac  stress.  For  a  nonfiction  writer  these  weekend
warriors provide a whole new readership: sports fans who are also recreational
sportsmen, eager to be put inside the head of athletes at the top of their form.

High  speed,  a  central  thrill  of  many  sports,  is  typical  of  the  sensations  that
ordinary mortals can only try to imagine. As the owner of cars that tend to shake

at  65  miles  per  hour,  I’ve  never  come  close  to  knowing  how  it  feels  to  drive  a
racing  car.  I  needed  a  writer,  Lesley  Hazleton,  to  strap  me  into  the  seat  of  a
Formula One vehicle. “Whenever I drive fast,” she writes, “there is an awareness
that I am in transgression of the laws of nature, moving faster than my body was
designed  to  move.”  This  awareness  doesn’t  truly  begin,  Hazleton  says,  until  a
driver  experiences  the  g-force,  an  outside  force  that  “works  on  you  with  such
pressure that it seems as though your body is moved first and your insides follow
after”:

Race drivers contend with g-forces so great that they are subject to three
or  four  times  the  normal  force  of  gravity.  From  a  standing  start,  a  Formula
One car will reach a hundred miles an hour in just under three seconds. And
in that first second the driver’s head is pushed back so violently that his face
distends, giving him a ghostly smile.

Within  another  second  he  has  changed  gears  twice,  and  each  time  he
does so, the acceleration force smashes him back into the seat again. After
three  seconds,  accelerating  upward  from  a  hundred  miles  an  hour  toward
two  hundred,  his  peripheral  vision  is  completely  blurred.  He  can  only  see
straight ahead. The 800-horsepower engine is screaming at 130 decibels, and
each piston completes four combustion cycles 10,000 times a minute, which
means that the vibration he feels is at that rate.

His neck and shoulder muscles are under immense strain, trying to keep
his eyes level as the g-force pushes his head from side to side in the corners.
The strong acceleration makes blood pool in his legs so that less is delivered
to the heart, which means that there’s less cardiac output, forcing the pulse
rate up. Formula One drivers’ pulses are often up to 180, even 200, and they
stay  at  85  percent  of  that  maximum  for  almost  the  entire  length  of  a  two-
hour race.

Breathing  quickens  as  the  muscles  call  for  more  blood—speed  literally
takes your breath away—and the whole body goes into emergency stance. A
two-hour emergency. The mouth goes dry, the eyes dilate as the car travels
the length of a football field for every normal heartbeat. The brain processes
information  at  an  astonishingly  rapid  rate,  since  the  higher  the  speed,  the
less  the  reaction  time.  Reactions  have  to  be  not  only  quick  but  also
extraordinarily precise, no matter how great the physical strain. Split seconds
may  be  mere  slivers  of  time,  but  they  are  also  the  difference  between
winning and losing a race, or between entering and avoiding a crash.

In  short,  a  Formula  One  driver  has  to  be  almost  preternaturally  alert
under conditions of maximum physical pressure. Obviously, the adrenaline is
pumping....  But  in  addition  to  the  physical  fitness  of  top  athletes,  he  needs
that  chess  player’s  mind  as  he  assimilates  telemetry  data,  calculates
overtaking points, and executes a racing strategy. All of which is why speed is
so  dangerous  for  most  of  us:  we  simply  have  neither  the  physical  nor  the

mental stamina to handle it.

Psychologically,  what  happens  in  a  race  is  still  more  complex.  The
muscles,  the  brain  chemicals,  the  laws  of  physics,  the  vibration,  the
conditions  of  the  race—all  these  combine  to  generate  a  high  level  of
excitement  and  tension  in  the  body,  making  the  driver  feel  absolutely
clearheaded and alert. And high.

Although  Hazleton  keeps  using  “his”—his  muscles,  his  eyes,  his  legs—the
pronoun  for  her  article  should  be  “her.”  Amid  all  the  erosions  in  sports  and
sports journalism today, she represents one huge gain: the emergence of women
as fine athletes, often on turf previously monopolized by men, and as reporters
with  equal  access  to  male  locker  rooms  and  the  other  routine  rights  of
journalism.  Consider  the  many  kinds  of  progress—both  in  performance  and  in
attitude—embodied  in  the  following  piece  by  one  of  those  writers,  Janice
Kaplan:

To  understand  how  good  women  have  become  in  sports,  you  have  to
understand  how  bad  they  were  just  a  decade  ago.  In  the  early  ’70s  the
debate wasn’t how much women could do athletically, but whether a normal
woman should be athletic at all.

Marathoning, for example, was said to be bad for children, for the elderly
and  for  women.  The  formidable  Boston  Marathon  was  officially  closed  to
women until 1972. That year Nina Kuscsik battled sexism and a mid-race bout
with diarrhea to become the first winner of the women’s division. Those of
us  who  knew  about  it  felt  a  surge  of  pride,  mixed  with  a  tinge  of
embarrassment.  Pride,  because  Kuscsik’s  victory  proved  that  women  could
run 26 miles after all. Embarrassment, because her time of three hours and
ten  minutes  was  more  than  50  minutes  slower  than  the  best  men’s  times.
Fifty minutes. That’s an eternity in racing lingo. The obvious explanation was
that  women  had  rarely  run  marathons  before  and  lacked  training  and
experience. An obvious explanation—but who really believed it?

Flash ahead to this year. For the first time, the women’s marathon will be
an Olympic event. One of the top competitors is likely to be Joan Benoit, who
holds the current women’s world record—two hours and 22 minutes. In the
dozen years since the first woman raced in Boston, the best women’s times
have improved by about 50 minutes. Another eternity.

Men’s  times  in  the  marathon  have  meanwhile  improved  by  only  a  few
minutes,  so  this  dramatic  progress  should  begin  to  answer  the  question  of
training vs. hormones: Are women slower and weaker than men because of
built-in  biological  differences—or  because  of  cultural  bias  and  the  fact  that
we haven’t been given a chance to prove what we can do? … Whether the
gap  between  men  and  women  will  ever  be  totally  closed  seems  almost
beside  the  point.  What  matters  is  that  women  are  doing  what  they  never

dreamed they could do—taking themselves and their bodies seriously.

A pivotal event in this revolution of altered consciousness was the mid-1970s
tennis  match  between  Billie  Jean  King  and  Bobby  Riggs.  “It  was  billed  as  the
battle of the sexes,” Kaplan recalls in another article, “and it was.”

There  has  probably  never  been  a  sporting  event  that  was  less  about
sports and more about social issues. The big issue in this match was women:
where we belonged and what we could do. Forget Supreme Court decisions
and ERA votes; we looked to two athletes to settle the issues of equality for
women in a way that  really mattered. In sports, all is  writ large and writ in
concrete. There is a winner and a loser; there is no debate.

For  many  women  there  was  a  sense  of  personal  triumph  in  Billie  Jean’s
victory. It seemed to release an energy in women all over the country. Young
women  demanded—and  got—a  greater  role  in  college  sports.  Prize  money
for women in many professional sports soared. Little girls began playing Little
League,  joining  boys’  teams,  proving  that  the  physiological  differences
between males and females aren’t as great as they were once imagined.

American sport has always been interwoven with social history, and the best
writers  are  men  and  women  who  make  the  connection.  “It  wasn’t  my  idea  for
basketball to become tax-shelter show biz,” Bill Bradley writes in Life on the Run,
a chronicle of his seasons with the New York Knicks. Ex-Senator Bradley’s book is
a  good  example  of  modern  sportswriting  because  it  ponders  some  of  the
destructive  forces  that  are  altering  American  sport—the  greed  of  owners,  the
worship of stars, the inability to accept defeat:

After  Van’s  departure  I  realized  that  no  matter  how  kind,  friendly  and
genuinely  interested  the  owners  may  be,  in  the  end  most  players  are  little
more than depreciable assets to them.

Self-definition comes from external sources, not from within. While their
physical  skill
lasts,  professional  athletes  are  celebrities—fondled  and
excused, praised and believed. Only toward the end of their careers do the
stars realize that their sense of identity is insufficient.

The winning team, like the conquering army, claims everything in its path
and seems to say that only winning is important. Yet victory has very narrow
meanings  and  can  become  a  destructive  force.  The  taste  of  defeat  has  a
richness of experience all its own.

Bradley’s  book  is  also  an  excellent  travel  journal,  catching  the  fatigue  and
loneliness of the professional athlete’s nomadic life—the countless night flights
and bus rides, the dreary days and endless waits in motel rooms and terminals:

“In  the  airports  that  have  become  our  commuter  stations  we  see  so  many
dramatic  personal  moments  that  we  are  callused.  To  some,  we  live  romantic
lives. To me, every day is a struggle to stay in touch with life’s subtleties.”

Those  are  the  values  to  look  for  when  you  write  about  sport:  people  and
places, time and transition. Here’s an enjoyable list of the kind of people every
sport comes furnished with. It’s from the obituary of G. F. T. Ryall, who covered
thoroughbred racing for The New Yorker, under the pen name Audax Minor, for
more than half a century, until a few months before he died at 92. The obituary
said  that  Ryall  “came  to  know  everyone  connected  with  racing—owners,
breeders,  stewards,  judges,  timers,  mutuel  clerks,  Pinkertons,  trainers,  cooks,
grooms, handicappers, hot-walkers, starters, musicians, jockeys and their agents,
touts, high-rolling gamblers and tinhorns.”

Hang  around  the  track  and  the  stable,  the  stadium  and  the  rink.  Observe
closely. Interview in depth. Listen to old-timers. Ponder the changes. Write well.

Writing About the Arts

Critics and Columnists

The arts are all around us, a daily enrichment of our lives, whether we perform
them ourselves—acting, dancing, painting, writing poetry, playing an instrument
—or seek them out in concert halls and theaters and museums and galleries. We
also want to read about the arts: to be kept in touch with the cultural currents of
the day, wherever art is being made.

Some of the writing that accomplishes that job is journalistic—the interview
with the new symphony orchestra conductor, the tour of the new museum with
its architect or its curator—and it calls for the same methods as the other forms
discussed  in  this  book.  Writing  about  how  the  new  museum  got  designed  and
financed  and  built  is  no  different  in  principle  from  explaining  how  the  Iraqis
almost built an atomic bomb.

But  to  write  about  the  arts  from  the  inside—to  appraise  a  new  work,  to
evaluate  a  performance,  to  recognize  what’s  good  and  what’s  bad—calls  for  a
special set of skills and a special body of knowledge. It’s necessary, in short, to be
a critic—which, at some point in his or her career, almost every writer wants to
be.  Smalltown  reporters  dream  of  the  moment  when  their  editor  will  summon
them to cover the pianist or the ballet troupe or the repertory company that has
been booked into the local auditorium. They will trot out the hard-won words of
their college education—“intuit” and “sensibility” and “Kafkaesque”—and show
the  whole  county  that  they  know  a  glissando  from  an  entrechat.  They  will
discern more symbolism in Ibsen than Ibsen thought of.

This  is  part  of  the  urge.  Criticism  is  the  stage  on  which  journalists  do  their
fanciest  strutting.  It’s  also  where  reputations  for  wit  are  born.  The  American
vernacular  is  rich  in  epigrams  (“She  ran  the  gamut  of  emotions  from  A  to  B”)
minted  by  people  like  Dorothy  Parker  and  George  S.  Kaufman,  who  became
famous  partly  by  minting  them,  and  the  temptation  to  make  a  name  at  the
expense  of  some  talentless  ham  is  too  strong  for  all  but  the  most  saintly.  I
particularly  like  Kaufman’s  hint  that  Raymond  Massey  in  Abe  Lincoln  in  Illinois
was  overplaying  the  title  role:  “Massey  won’t  be  satisfied  until  he’s

assassinated.”

True wit, however, is rare, and a thousand barbed arrows fall at the feet of
the archer for every one that flies. It’s also too facile an approach if you want to
write serious criticism, for the only epigrams that have survived are cruel ones.
It’s  far  easier  to  bury  Caesar  than  to  praise  him—and  that  goes  for  Cleopatra,
too. But to say why you think a play is good, in words that don’t sound banal, is
one of the hardest chores in the business.

So don’t be deluded that criticism is an easy route to glory. Nor does the job
carry as much power as is widely supposed. Probably only the daily drama critic
of the New York Times can make or break the product. Music critics have almost
no power, writing about a cluster of sounds that have vanished into the air and
will never be heard in the same way again, and literary critics haven’t kept the
best-seller  list  from  becoming  a  nesting  ground  for  authors  like  Danielle  Steel,
whose sensibility they don’t intuit.

A distinction should therefore be made between a “critic” and a “reviewer.”
Reviewers write for a newspaper or a popular magazine, and what they cover is
primarily  an  industry—the  output  of,  for  instance,  the  television  industry,  the
motion-picture industry and, increasingly, the publishing industry in its flood of
cookbooks,  health  books,  how-to  books,  “as  told  to”  books,  “gift  books”  and
other such items of merchandise. As a reviewer your job is more to report than
to  make  an  aesthetic  judgment.  You  are  the  deputy  for  the  average  man  or
woman who wants to know: “What is the new TV series about?” “Is the movie
too dirty for the kids?” “Will the book really improve my sex life or tell me how
to make a chocolate mousse?” Think what you would want to know if you had to
spend the money for the movie, the baby-sitter and the long-promised dinner at
a  good  restaurant.  Obviously  you  will  make  your  review  plainer  and  less
sophisticated than if you were judging a new production of Chekhov.

Yet I suggest several conditions that apply to both good reviewing and good

criticism.

One  is  that  critics  should  like—or,  better  still,  love—the  medium  they  are
reviewing.  If  you  think  movies  are  dumb,  don’t  write  about  them.  The  reader
deserves a movie buff who will bring along a reservoir of knowledge, passion and
prejudice. It’s not necessary for the critic to like every film; criticism is only one
person’s opinion. But he should go to every movie wanting to like it. If he is more
often disappointed than pleased, it’s because the film has failed to live up to its
best possibilities. This is far different from the critic who prides himself on hating
everything. He becomes tiresome faster than you can say “Kafkaesque.”

Another  rule  is:  don’t  give  away  too  much  of  the  plot.  Tell  readers  just
enough to let them decide whether it’s the kind of story they tend to enjoy, but
not so much that you’ll kill their enjoyment. One sentence will often do the trick.
“This  is  a  picture  about  a  whimsical  Irish  priest  who  enlists  the  help  of  three
orphan boys dressed as leprechauns to haunt a village where a mean widow has
hidden a crock of gold.” I couldn’t be flailed into seeing that movie—I’ve had my

fill  of  “the  little  people”  on  stage  and  screen.  But  there  are  legions  who  don’t
share that crotchet of mine and would flock to the film. Don’t spoil their pleasure
by revealing every twist of the narrative, especially the funny part about the troll
under the bridge.

A  third  principle  is  to  use  specific  detail.  This  avoids  dealing  in  generalities,
which,  being  generalities,  mean  nothing.  “The  play  is  always  fascinating”  is  a
typical  critic’s  sentence.  But  how  is  it  fascinating?  Your  idea  of  fascinating  is
different from someone else’s. Cite a few examples and let your readers weigh
them  on  their  own  fascination  scale.  Here  are  excerpts  from  two  reviews  of  a
film directed by Joseph Losey. (1) “In its attempts to be civilized and restrained it
denies  its  possibilities  for  vulgarity  and  mistakes  bloodlessness  for  taste.”  The
sentence is vague, giving us  a whiff of the movie’s mood  but no image we can
visualize.  (2)  “Losey  pursues  a  style  that  finds  portents  in  lampshades  and
meanings in table settings.” The sentence is precise—we know just what kind of
arty  filmmaking  this  is.  We  can  almost  see  the  camera  lingering  with  studied
sluggishness over the family crystal.

In  book  reviewing  this  means  allowing  the  author’s  words  to  do  their  own
documentation. Don’t say that Tom Wolfe’s style is gaudy and unusual. Quote a
few of his gaudy and unusual sentences and let the reader see how quirky they
are.  In  reviewing  a  play,  don’t  just  tell  us  that  the  set  is  “striking.”  Describe  its
various levels, or how it is ingeniously lit, or how it helps the actors to make their
entrances  and  exits  as  a  conventional  set  would  not.  Put  your  readers  in  your
theater seat. Help them to see what you saw.

A  final  caution  is  to  avoid  the  ecstatic  adjectives  that  occupy  such
disproportionate  space  in  every  critic’s  quiver—words  like  “enthralling”  and
“luminous.”  Good  criticism  needs  a  lean  and  vivid  style  to  express  what  you
observed and what you think. Florid adjectives smack of the panting prose with
which Vogue likes to disclose its latest chichi discovery: “We’ve just heard about
the most utterly enchanting little beach at Cozumel!”

So much for reviewing and the simpler rules of the game. What is criticism?
Criticism is a serious intellectual act. It tries to evaluate serious works of art
and to place them in the context of what has been done before in that medium
or  by  that  artist.  This  doesn’t  mean  that  critics  must  limit  themselves  to  work
that  aims  high;  they  may  select  some  commercial  product  like  Law  &  Order  to
make  a  point  about  American  society  and  values.  But  on  the  whole  they  don’t
want to waste their time on peddlers. They see themselves as scholars, and what
interests them is the play of ideas in their field.

Therefore  if  you  want  to  be  a  critic,  steep  yourself  in  the  literature  of  the
medium you hope to make your specialty. If you want to be a theater critic, see
every possible play—the good and the bad, the old and the new. Catch up on the
past  by  reading  the  classics  or  seeing  them  in  revival.  Know  your  Shakespeare
and  Shaw,  your  Chekhov  and  Molière,  your  Arthur  Miller  and  Tennessee
Williams,  and  know  how  they  broke  new  ground.  Learn  about  the  great  actors

and directors and how their methods differed. Know the history of the American
musical:  the  particular  contribution  of  Jerome  Kern  and  the  Gershwin  brothers
and  Cole  Porter,  of  Rodgers  and  Hart  and  Hammerstein,  of  Frank  Loesser  and
Stephen  Sondheim,  of  Agnes  de  Mille  and  Jerome  Robbins.  Only  then  can  you
place  every  new  play  or  musical  within  an  older  tradition  and  tell  the  pioneer
from the imitator.

I could make the same kind of list for every art. A film critic who reviews a
new Robert Altman picture without having seen Altman’s earlier films isn’t much
help to the serious moviegoer. A music critic should know not only his Bach and
Palestrina,  his  Mozart  and  Beethoven,  but  his  Schoenberg  and  Ives  and  Philip
Glass—the theoreticians and mavericks and experimenters.

Obviously I’m now assuming a more urbane body of readers. As a critic you
can  presuppose  certain  shared  areas  of  knowledge  with  the  men  and  women
you  are  writing  for.  You  don’t  have  to  tell  them  that  William  Faulkner  was  a
Southern novelist. What you do have to do, if you are assessing the first novel of
is  to  generate  a
a  Southern  author  and  weighing  Faulkner’s
provocative  idea  and  throw  it  onto  the  page,  where  your  readers  can  savor  it.
They may disagree with your point—that’s part of their intellectual fun. But they
have  enjoyed  the  turn  of  your  mind  and  the  journey  that  took  you  to  your
conclusion.  We  like  good  critics  as  much  for  their  personality  as  for  their
opinions.

influence,

There’s no medium like the movies to give us the pleasure of traveling with a
good critic. The shared territory is so vast. Movies are intertwined with our daily
lives  and  attitudes,  our  memories  and  myths—four  different
lines  from
Casablanca have made it into  Bartlett’s  Familiar  Quotations—and  we  count  on
the  critic  to  make  those  connections  for  us.  A  typical  service  that  the  critic
provides  is  to  freeze  briefly  for  our  inspection  the  stars  who  shoot  across  the
screen in film after film, sometimes arriving from a galaxy previously unknown to
stargazers.  Molly  Haskell,  reviewing  A  Cry  in  the  Dark,  in  which  Meryl  Streep
plays  an  Australian  woman  convicted  of  killing  her  baby  on  a  camping  trip,
ponders  Streep’s  “delight  in  disguise—in  bizarre  wigs,  unorthodox  getups  and
foreign  accents—and  in  playing  women  who  are  outside  the  normal  range  of
audience  sympathy.”  Putting  this  in  a  historical  context,  as  good  critics  should,
she writes:

The aura of the old  stars radiated out of a sense  of self, a core identity
projected into every role. However varied the performances of Bette Davis,
or Katharine Hepburn, or Margaret Sullavan, we always felt we were in the
presence  of  something  knowable,  familiar,  constant.  They  had  recognizable
voices,  ways  of  reading  a  line,  even  certain  expressions  that  remained
constant  from  film  to  film.  Comics  could  do  imitations  of  them,  and  you
either responded to them, unambivalently, or you didn’t. Streep, chameleon-
like,  undercuts  this  response  by  never  staying  in  one  place  long  enough  for

you to get a fix on her.

Bette  Davis,  stretching  the  bounds  of  type,  went  in  for  costume  (The
Virgin  Queen)  and  period  (The  Old  Maid),  but  she  was  always  Bette  Davis,
and no one would have thought to want it otherwise. Like Streep, she even
dared to play unlikable, morally ambiguous heroines, her greatest being the
wife  of  the  plantation  owner  in  The  Letter  who  murders  her  treacherous
lover in cold blood, then refuses to repent. The difference is that Davis fused
with the role, poured her own passion and intensity into it. Her heroine is as
icily  proud  and  implacable  as  Medea—which  may  be  why  members  of  the
Academy denied her the Oscar she deserved in favor of sweeter and tamer
Ginger Rogers for Kitty Foyle—but Davis makes us respond to the fire within.
It’s  hard  to  imagine  an  actress  like  Streep,  who  remains  at  a  safe  distance
from her roles, rising to such heights … or falling to such depths.

The passage deftly connects Hollywood past and Hollywood present, leaving
us to fathom the postmodern cool of Meryl Streep but also telling us everything
we  need  to  know  about  Bette  Davis.  By  extension  it  tells  us  about  a  whole
generation of grand dragons who reigned with Davis in the golden age of the star
system—the likes of Joan Crawford and Barbara Stanwyck—and who didn’t mind
being hated on the screen as long as they were loved at the box office.

Turning  to  another  medium,  here’s  an  excerpt  from  Living-Room  War,  by
Michael J. Arlen, a collection of columns of television criticism that Arlen wrote
in the mid-1960s.

Vietnam is often referred to as “television’s war,” in the sense that this is
the  first  war  that  has  been  brought  to  the  people  preponderantly  by
television. People indeed look at television. They really look at it. They look at
Dick Van Dyke and become his friend. They look at thoughtful Chet Huntley
and find him thoughtful, and at witty David Brinkley and find him witty. They
look  at  Vietnam.  They  look  at  Vietnam,  it  seems,  as  a  child  kneeling  in  the
corridor, his eye to the keyhole, looks at two grownups arguing in a locked
room—the aperture of the keyhole small; the figures shadowy, mostly out of
sight;  the  voices  indistinct,  isolated  threats  without  meaning;  isolated
glimpses, part of an elbow, a man’s jacket (who is the man?), part of a face, a
woman’s  face.  Ah,  she  is  crying.  One  sees  the  tears.  (The  voices  continue
indistinctly.)  One  counts  the  tears.  Two  tears.  Three  tears.  Two  bombing
raids.  Four  seek-and-destroy  missions.  Six  administration  pronouncements.
Such a fine-looking woman. One searches in vain for the other grownup, but,
ah,  the  keyhole  is  so  small,  he  is  somehow  never  in  the  line  of  sight.  Look!
There  is  General  Ky.  Look!  There  are  some  planes  returning  safely  to  the
Ticonderoga.  I  wonder  (sometimes)  what  it  is  that  the  people  who  run
television think about the war, because they have given us this keyhole view;
we  have  given  them  the  airwaves,  and  now,  at  this  crucial  time,  they  have

given  back  to  us  this  keyhole  view—and  I  wonder  if  they  truly  think  that
those  isolated  glimpses  of  elbow,  face,  a  swirl  of  dress  (who  is  that  other
person anyway?) are all that we children can stand to see of what is going on
inside the room.

This  is  criticism  at  its  best:  stylish,  allusive,  disturbing.  It  disturbs  us—as
criticism often should—because it jogs a set of beliefs and forces us to reexamine
them. What holds our attention is the metaphor of the keyhole, so exact and yet
so  mysterious.  But  what  remains  is  a  fundamental  question  about  how  the
country’s  most  powerful  medium  told  the  people  about  the  war  they  were
fighting—and  escalating.  The  column  ran  in  1966,  when  most  Americans  still
supported the Vietnam war. Would they have turned against it sooner if TV had
widened the keyhole, had shown us not only the “swirl of dress” but the severed
head and the burning child? It’s too late now to know. But at least one critic was
keeping watch. Critics should be among the first to notify us when the truths we
hold to be self-evident cease to be true.

Some  arts  are  harder  to  catch  in  print  than  others.  One  is  dance,  which
consists  of  movement.  How  can  a  writer  freeze  all  the  graceful  leaps  and
pirouettes?  Another  is  music.  It’s  an  art  that  we  receive  through  our  ears,  yet
writers  are  stuck  with  describing  it  in  words  we  will  see.  At  best  they  can  only
partly succeed, and many a music critic has built a long career by hiding behind a
hedge of Italian technical terms. He will find just a shade too much rubato  in  a
pianist, a tinge of shrillness in a soprano’s tessitura.

But even in this world of evanescent notes a good critic can make sense of
what happened by writing good English. Virgil Thomson, the music critic of the
New  York  Herald  Tribune  from  1940  to  1954,  was  an  elegant  practitioner.  A
composer  himself,  an  erudite  and  cultivated  man,  he  never  forgot  that  his
readers were real people, and he wrote with a zest that swept them along, his
style  alive  with  pleasant  surprises.  He  was  also  fearless;  during  his  tenure  no
sacred  cow  could  safely  graze.  He  never  forgot  that  musicians  are  real  people,
and he didn’t hesitate to shrink the giants to human scale:

It  is  extraordinary  how  little  musicians  discuss  among  themselves
Toscanini’s rightness or wrongness about matters of speed and rhythm and
the  tonal  amenities.  Like  other  musicians,  he  is  frequently  apt  about  these
and as frequently in error. What seems to be more important is his unvarying
ability  to  put  over  a  piece.  He  quite  shamelessly  whips  up  the  tempo  and
sacrifices  clarity  and  ignores  a  basic  rhythm,  just  making  the  music,  like  his
baton,  go  round  and  round,  if  he  finds  his  audience’s  attention  tending  to
waver.  No  piece  has  to  mean  anything  specific;  every  piece  has  to  provoke
from  its  hearers  a  spontaneous  vote  of  acceptance.  This  is  what  I  call  the
“wow technique.”

No rubatos or tessituras there, and no blind hero worship. Yet the paragraph
catches the essence of what made Toscanini great: an extra helping of show biz.
If  his  fans  are  offended  to  think  that  the  essence  contained  so  coarse  an
ingredient, they can continue to admire the Maestro for his “lyrical colorations”
or  “orchestral  tuttis.”  I’ll  go  along  with  Thomson’s  diagnosis,  and  so,  I  suspect,
would the Maestro.

One  lubricant  in  criticism  is  humor.  It  allows  the  critic  to  come  at  a  work
obliquely  and  to  write  a  piece  that  is  itself  an  entertainment.  But  the  column
should be an organic piece of writing, not just a few rabbit punches of wit. James
Michener’s books have long defied reviewers to say anything bad about them; by
their earnestness they are unassailable. Reviewing The Covenant, however, John
Leonard ambushed Michener by the roundabout route of metaphor:

What must be said for James A. Michener is that he wears you down. He
numbs you into acquiescence. Page after page of pedestrian prose marches,
like a defeated army, across the optic tract. It is a Great Trek from platitude
to piety. The mind, between the ears, might as well be the South African veld
after  one  of  the  devastations  of  Mzilikazi  or  the  “scorched  earth”  policy  of
the British during the Boer War. No bird sings and the antelope die of thirst.

And  yet  Mr.  Michener  is  as  sincere  as  shoes.  In  The  Covenant,  as  in
Hawaii  and  Centennial  and  Chesapeake,  he  takes  the  long  view.  He  begins
15,000  years  ago  and  he  stops  at  the  end  of  1979.  He  is  going  to  make  us
understand  South  Africa  whether  we  want  to  or  not.  Like  the  Dutchmen
whose  point  of  view  he  often  presents  with  a  grim  sense  of  fair  play,  he  is
stubborn; he endures his own bad weather; he drives the cattle of his facts
until they drop.

After  300  pages  or  so  the  reader—this  reader  anyway—submits  with  a
sigh. Of course, if we are going to spend a week with a book, the book should
be written by Proust or Dostoyevsky, not stapled together from file cards by
Mr.  Michener.  But  there  is  no  turning  back.  This  is  less  fiction  than  it  is
drudgery;  we  are  lashed  on  by  the  pedagogue  who  rides  our  shoulders.
Maybe learning will be good for us.

Learn  we  do.  Mr.  Michener  doesn’t  cheat.  His  personal  covenant  is  not
with God, but with the encyclopedia. If, 15,000 years ago in the African bush,
the  San  used  poison  arrows,  he  will  describe  those  arrows  and  name  the
source of the poison.

How  should  a  good  piece  of  criticism  start?  You  must  make  an  immediate
effort to orient your readers to the special world they are about to enter. Even if
they are broadly educated men and women they need to be told or reminded of
certain facts. You can’t just throw them in the water and expect them to swim
easily. The water needs to be warmed up.

This  is  particularly  true  of  literary  criticism.  So  much  has  gone  before;  all

writers are part of a long stream, whether they decide to swim with the current
or to hurl themselves against it. No poet of this century was more innovative and
influential than T. S. Eliot. Yet his 100th birthday in 1988 passed with surprisingly
little public attention, as Cynthia Ozick noted at the start of a critical essay in The
New  Yorker,  pointing  out  that  today’s  college  students  have  almost  no
knowledge  of  the  poet’s  “mammoth  prophetic  presence”  for  her  generation:
“[To us], in a literary period that resembled eternity, T. S. Eliot … seemed pure
zenith,  a  colossus,  nothing  less  than  a  permanent  luminary,  fixed  in  the
firmament like the sun and the moon.”

How  adroitly  Ozick  warms  up  the  waters,  beckoning  us  to  return  to  the
literary  landscape  of  her  own  college  years  and  thereby  understand  her
amazement at the tale of near oblivion she is about to unfold.

The doors to Eliot’s poetry were not easily opened. His lines and themes
were not readily understood. But the young flung themselves through those
portals, lured by unfamiliar enchantments and bound by pleasurable ribbons
of  ennui.  “April  is  the  cruellest  month”—Eliot’s  voice,  with  its  sepulchral
cadences, came spiraling out of student phonographs—“breeding/Lilacs out
of the dead land, mixing/Memory and desire.” That tony British accent—flat,
precise, steady, unemotive, surprisingly high-pitched, bleakly passive—coiled
through  awed  English  Departments  and  worshipful  dormitories,  rooms
where the walls had pinup Picassos, and where Pound and Eliot and Ulysses
and Proust jostled one another higgledy-piggledy in the rapt late adolescent
breast.  The  voice  was,  like  the  poet  himself,  nearly  sacerdotal;  it  was
impersonal, winding and winding across the country’s campuses like a spool
of  blank  robotic  woe.  “Shantih  shantih  shantih,”  “not  with  a  bang  but  a
whimper,”  “an  old  man  in  a  dry  month,”  “I  shall  wear  the  bottoms  of  my
trousers rolled”: these were the devout chants of the literarily passionate in
the forties and fifties, who in their own first verses piously copied Eliot’s tone
—its  restraint,  gravity,  mystery,  its  invasive  remoteness  and  immobilized,
disjointed despair.

in

is  brilliant

The  paragraph

its  remembered  detail,

its  scholarly
fastidiousness, its conjuring back of Eliot himself as a huge physical presence on
campuses  across  America.  As  readers  we  are  transported  back  to  the  high
priest’s highest moment—a perfect launch for the descent that lies ahead. Many
scholars  didn’t  like  Ozick’s  essay;  they  thought  she  had  exaggerated  the  poet’s
fall  from  renown.  But  for  me  that  merely  validated  her  piece.  Literary  criticism
that  doesn’t  stir  a  few  combative  juices  is  hardly  worth  writing,  and  there  are
few spectator sports as enjoyable as a good academic brawl.

Today,  criticism  has  many  first  cousins  in  journalism:  the  newspaper  or
magazine  column,  the  personal  essay,  the  editorial,  and  the  essay-review,  in
which  a  critic  digresses  from  a  book  or  a  cultural  phenomenon  into  a  larger

point. (Gore Vidal has brought a high impudence and humor to the form.) Many
of  the  same  principles  that  govern  good  criticism  go  into  these  columns.  A
political  columnist,  for  example,  must  love  politics  and  its  ancient,  tangled
threads.

But what is common to all the forms is that they consist of personal opinion.
Even the editorial that uses “we” was obviously written by an “I.” What is crucial
for you as the writer is to express your opinion firmly. Don’t cancel its strength
with  last-minute  evasions  and  escapes.  The  most  boring  sentence  in  the  daily
newspaper is the last sentence of the editorial, which says “It is too early to tell
whether the new policy will work” or “The effectiveness of the decision remains
to  be  seen.”  If  it’s  too  early  to  tell,  don’t  bother  us  with  it,  and  as  for  what
remains  to  be  seen,  everything  remains  to  be  seen.  Take  your  stand  with
conviction.

Many  years  ago,  when  I  was  writing  editorials  for  the  New  York  Herald
Tribune, the editor of the page was a huge and choleric man from Texas named
L.  L.  Engelking.  I  respected  him  because  he  had  no  pretense  and  hated  undue
circling  around  a  subject.  Every  morning  we  would  all  meet  to  discuss  what
editorials  we  would  like  to  write  for  the  next  day  and  what  position  we  would
take. Frequently we weren’t quite sure, especially the writer who was an expert
on Latin America.

“What about that coup in Uruguay?” the editor would ask.
“It  could  represent  progress  for  the  economy,”  the  writer  would  reply,  “or
then  again  it  might  destabilize  the  whole  political  situation.  I  suppose  I  could
mention the possible benefits and then—”

“Well,” the man from Texas would break in, “let’s not go peeing down both

legs.”

It  was  a  plea  he  made  often,  and  it  was  the  most  inelegant  advice  I  ever
received.  But  over  a  long  career  of  writing  reviews  and  columns  and  trying  to
make a point I felt strongly about, it was also probably the best.

Humor

Humor is the secret weapon of the nonfiction writer. It’s secret because so few
writers realize that humor is often their best tool—and sometimes their only tool
—for making an important point.

If this strikes you as a paradox, you’re not alone. Writers of humor live with
the knowledge that many of their readers don’t know what they are trying to do.
I remember a reporter calling to ask how I happened to write a certain parody in
Life. At the end he said, “Should I refer to you as a humorist? Or have you also
written anything serious?”

The answer is that if you’re trying to write humor, almost everything you do
is serious. Few Americans understand this. We dismiss our humorists as triflers
because they never settled down to “real” work. The Pulitzer Prizes go to authors
like Ernest Hemingway and William Faulkner, who are (God knows) serious and
are therefore certified as men of literature. The prizes seldom go to people like
George  Ade,  H.  L.  Mencken,  Ring  Lardner,  S.  J.  Perelman,  Art  Buchwald,  Jules
Feiffer, Woody Allen and Garrison Keillor, who seem to be just fooling around.

They’re not just fooling around. They are as serious in purpose as Hemingway
or Faulkner—a national asset in forcing the country to see itself clearly. Humor,
to them, is urgent work. It’s an attempt to say important things in a special way
that  regular  writers  aren’t  getting  said  in  a  regular  way—or  if  they  are,  it’s  so
regular that nobody is reading it.

One  strong  editorial  cartoon  is  worth  a  hundred  solemn  editorials.  One
Doonesbury  comic  strip  by  Garry  Trudeau  is  worth  a  thousand  words  of
moralizing. One Catch–22 or Dr. Strangelove is more powerful than all the books
and movies that try to show war “as it is.” Those two works of comic invention
are  still  standard  points  of  reference  for  anyone  trying  to  warn  us  about  the
military mentality that could blow us all up tomorrow. Joseph Heller and Stanley
Kubrick heightened the truth about war just enough to catch its lunacy, and we
recognize it as lunacy. The joke is no joke.

This heightening of some crazy truth—to a level where it will be seen as crazy
—is the essence of what serious humorists are trying to do. Here’s one example
of how they go about their mysterious work.

One day in the 1960s I realized that half the girls and women in America were
suddenly  wearing  hair  curlers.  It  was  a  weird  new  blight,  all  the  more  puzzling
because I couldn’t understand when the women took the curlers out. There was
no  evidence  that  they  ever  did—they  wore  them  to  the  supermarket  and  to
church  and  on  dates.  So  what  was  the  wonderful  event  they  were  saving  the
wonderful hairdo for?

I tried for a year to think of a way to write about this phenomenon. I could
have  said  “It’s  an  outrage”  or  “Have  these  women  no  pride?”  But  that  would
have been a sermon, and sermons are the death of humor. The writer must find
some comic device—satire, parody, irony, lampoon, nonsense—that he can use
to disguise his serious point. Very often he never finds it, and the point doesn’t
get made.

Luckily, my vigil was at last rewarded. I was browsing at a newsstand and saw
four  magazines  side  by  side:  Hairdo,  Celebrity  Hairdo,  Combout  and  Pouf.  I
bought  all  four—to  the  alarm  of  the  newsdealer—and  found  a  whole  world  of
journalism  devoted  solely  to  hair:  life  from  the  neck  up,  but  not  including  the
brain. The magazines had diagrams of elaborate roller positions and columns in
which  a  girl  could  send  her  roller  problem  to  the  editors  for  their  advice.  That
was what I needed. I invented a magazine called Haircurl and wrote a series of
parody letters and replies. The piece ran in Life and it began like this:

Dear Haircurl:

I am 15 and am considered pretty in my group. I wear baby pink rollers,
jumbo size. I have been going steady with a certain boy for 2½ years and he
has never seen me without my rollers. The other night I took them off and
we had a terrible fight. “Your head looks small,” he told me. He called me a
dwarf and said I had misled him. How can I win him back?

HEARTSICK
Speonk, N.Y.

Dear Heartsick:

You have only yourself to blame for doing something so stupid. The latest
“Haircurl” survey shows that 94% of American girls now wear rollers in their
hair 21.6 hours a day and 359 days a year. You tried to be different and you
lost your fella. Take our advice and get some super-jumbo rollers (they come
in  your  favorite  baby  pink  shade,  too)  and  your  head  will  look  bigger  than
ever and twice as lovely. Don’t ever take them off again.

Dear Haircurl:

My  boyfriend  likes  to  run  his  fingers  through  my  hair.  The  trouble  is  he
keeps  getting  them  pinched  in  my  rollers.  The  other  night  a  terribly
embarrassing episode happened. We were at the movies and somehow my
boyfriend got two of his fingers caught (it was right where the medium roller

meets the clipcurl) and couldn’t get them out. I felt very conspicuous leaving
the theater with his hand still in my hair, and going home on the bus several
people  gave  us  “funny  looks.”  Fortunately  I  was  able  to  reach  my  stylist  at
home and he came right over with his tools and got poor Jerry loose. Jerry
was  very  mad  and  said  he’s  not  going  to  date  me  again  until  I  get  some
rollers that don’t have this particular habit. I think he is being unfair, but he
“means business.” Can you help me?

FRANTIC
Buffalo

Dear Frantic Buffalo:

We’re sorry to have to tell you that no rollers have yet been developed
that  do  not  occasionally  catch  the  fingers  of  boys  who  tousle.  The  roller
industry,  however,  is  working  very  hard  on  the  problem,  as  this  complaint
frequently  comes  up.  Meanwhile  why  not  ask  Jerry  to  wear  mittens?  That
way you’ll be happy and he’ll be safe.

There  were  many  more,  and  perhaps  I  even  made  a  small  contribution  to
Lady Bird Johnson’s “beautification” program. But the point is this: once you’ve
read that article you can never look at hair curlers in the same way again. You’ve
been jolted by humor into looking with a fresh eye at something bizarre in our
daily environment that was previously taken for granted. The subject here isn’t
important—hair  curlers  won’t  be  the  ruin  of  our  society.  But  the  method  will
work for subjects that are important, or for almost  any subject, if you can find
the right comic frame.

Over the last five years of the old Life, 1968–1972, I used humor to get at a
number of unlikely subjects, such as the excesses of military power and nuclear
testing. One column was on the petty squabbling over the shape of the table at
the Vietnam peace conference in Paris. The situation had become so outrageous
after  nine  weeks  that  it  could  be  approached  only  through  ridicule,  and  I
described  various  efforts  to  get  peace  at  my  own  dinner  table  by  changing  its
shape every night, or by lowering the chairs of different people to give them less
“status,”  or  by  turning  their  chairs  around  so  the  rest  of  us  wouldn’t  have  to
“recognize” them. It was exactly what was happening in Paris.

What  made  those  pieces  work  was  that  they  stuck  close  to  the  form  they
were  parodying.  Humor  may  seem  to  be  an  act  of  gross  exaggeration.  But  the
hair  curler  letters  wouldn’t  succeed  if  we  didn’t  recognize  them  as  a  specific
journalistic  form,  both  in  their  style  and  in  their  mentality.  Control  is  vital  to
humor. Don’t use comical names like Throttlebottom. Don’t make the same kind
of  joke  two  or  three  times—readers  will  enjoy  themselves  more  if  you  make  it
only once. Trust the sophistication of readers who do know what you’re doing,
and don’t worry about the rest.

The columns that I wrote for Life made people laugh. But they had a serious
purpose, which was to say: “Something crazy is going on here—some erosion in
the  quality  of  life,  or  some  threat  to  life  itself,  and  yet  everyone  assumes  it’s
normal.” Today the outlandish becomes routine overnight. The humorist is trying
to say that it’s still outlandish.

I remember a cartoon by Bill Mauldin during the student turmoil of the late
1960s, when infantrymen and tanks were summoned to keep peace at a college
in North Carolina and undergraduates at Berkeley were dispersed by a helicopter
spraying them with Mace. The cartoon showed a mother pleading with her son’s
draft  board:  “He’s  an  only  child—please  get  him  off  the  campus.”  It  was
Mauldin’s way of pinning down this particular lunacy, and he was right on target
—in  fact,  at  the  center  of  the  bull’s-eye,  as  the  killing  of  four  students  at  Kent
State University proved not long after his cartoon appeared.

The targets will change from week to week, but there will never be a dearth
of  new  lunacies  and  dangers  for  the  humorist  to  fight.  Lyndon  Johnson,  in  the
years of his disastrous war in Vietnam, was brought down partly by Jules Feiffer
and  Art  Buchwald.  Senator  Joseph  McCarthy  and  Vice-President  Spiro  Agnew
were brought down partly by Walt Kelly in the comic strip Pogo. H. L. Mencken
brought down a whole galaxy of hypocrites in high places, and “Boss” Tweed of
Tammany Hall was partly toppled by the cartoons of Thomas Nast. Mort Sahl, a
comic,  was  the  only  person  who  stayed  awake  during  the  Eisenhower  years,
when America was under sedation and didn’t want to be disturbed. Many people
regarded  Sahl  as  a  cynic,  but  he  thought  of  himself  as  an  idealist.  “If  I  criticize
somebody,” he said, “it’s because I have higher hopes for the world, something
good to replace the bad. I’m not saying what the Beat Generation says: ‘Go away
because I’m not involved.’ I’m here and I’m involved.”

“I’m  here  and  I’m  involved”:  make  that  your  creed  if  you  want  to  write
serious  humor.  Humorists  operate  on  a  deeper  current  than  most  people
suspect. They must be willing to go against the grain, to say what the populace
and  the  President  may  not  want  to  hear.  Art  Buchwald  and  Garry  Trudeau
perform an act of courage every week. They say things that need to be said that
a regular columnist couldn’t get away with. What saves them is that politicians
are not known for humor and are therefore even more befuddled by it than the
general public.

But  humor  has  many  uses  besides  the  topical.  They  aren’t  as  urgent,  but  they
help us to look at far older problems of the heart, the home, the family, the job
and  all  the  other  frustrations  of  just  getting  from  morning  to  night.  I  once
interviewed  Chic  Young,  creator  of  Blondie,  when  he  had  been  writing  and
drawing that daily and Sunday comic strip for 40 years, or 14,500 strips. It was
the most popular of all strips, reaching 60 million readers in every corner of the
world, and I asked Young why it was so durable.

“It’s  durable  because  it’s  simple,”  he  said.  “It’s  built  on  four  things  that
everybody does: sleeping, eating, raising a family and making money.” The comic

variations on those four themes are as numerous in the strip as they are in life.
Dagwood’s efforts to get money from his boss, Mr. Dithers, have their perpetual
counterweight in Blondie’s efforts to spend it. “I try to keep Dagwood in a world
that people are used to,” Young told me. “He never does anything as special as
playing golf, and the people who come to the door are just the people that an
average family has to deal with.”

I cite Young’s four themes to remind you that most humor, however freakish
it may seem, is based on fundamental truths. Humor is not a separate organism
that can survive on its own frail metabolism. It’s a special angle of vision granted
to certain writers who already write good English. They aren’t writing about life
that’s essentially ludicrous; they are writing about life that’s essentially serious,
but their eye falls on areas where serious hopes are mocked by some ironic turn
of  fate—“the  strange  incongruity,”  as  Stephen  Leacock  put  it,  “between  our
aspiration and our achievement.” E. B. White made the same point. “I don’t like
the word ‘humorist,’” he said. “It seems to me misleading. Humor is a by-product
that occurs in the serious work of some and not others. I was more influenced by
Don Marquis than by Ernest Hemingway, by Perelman than by Dreiser.”

Therefore  I  suggest  several  principles  for  the  writer  of  humor.  Master  the
craft  of  writing  good  “straight”  English;  humorists  from  Mark  Twain  to  Russell
Baker are, first of all, superb writers. Don’t search for the outlandish and scorn
what seems too ordinary; you will touch more chords by finding what’s funny in
what  you  know  to  be  true.  Finally,  don’t  strain  for  laughs;  humor  is  built  on
surprise, and you can surprise the reader only so often.

Unfortunately  for  writers,  humor  is  elusive  and  subjective.  No  two  people
think the same things are funny, and a piece that one magazine will reject as a
dud is often published by another that finds it a jewel. The reasons for rejection
are equally elusive. “It just doesn’t work,” editors say, and there’s not much they
can add. Occasionally such a piece can be made to work—it has some flaw that
can be repaired. Mortality, however, is high. “Humor can be dissected, as a frog
can,” E. B. White once wrote, “but the thing dies in the process and the innards
are discouraging to any but the pure scientific mind.”

I’m  no  fancier  of  dead  frogs,  but  I  wanted  to  see  if  at  least  a  few  lessons
could be learned by poking about in the innards, and when I was teaching at Yale
I  decided,  one  year,  to  teach  a  course  in  humor  writing.  I  warned  my  students
that possibly it couldn’t be done and that we might end up killing the thing we
loved.  Luckily,  humor  not  only  didn’t  die;  it  bloomed  in  the  desert  of  solemn
term  papers,  and  I  repeated  the  course  the  following  year.  Let  me  briefly
reconstruct our journey.

“I  hope  to  point  out  that  American  humor  has  an  honorable  literature,”  I
wrote  in  a  memo  for  prospective  students,  “and  to  consider  the  influence  of
certain  pioneers  on  their  successors....  Although  the  line  between  ‘fiction’  and
‘nonfiction’  is  fuzzy  in  humor,  I  see  this  as  a  nonfiction  course:  what  you  write
will be based on external events. I’m not interested in ‘creative writing,’ flights of

pure imagination and pointless whimsy.”

I began by reading excerpts from early writers to show that a humorist can
employ  a  wide  range  of  literary  forms,  or  invent  new  ones.  We  started  with
George  Ade’s  “Fables  in  Slang,”  the  first  of  which  appeared  in  1897  in  the
Chicago Record, where Ade was a reporter. “He was just sitting unsuspectingly in
front  of  a  sheet  of  paper,”  Jean  Shepherd  writes  in  a  fine  introduction  to  his
anthology, The America of George Ade, “when the innocent idea came to him to
write  something  in  fable  form,  using  the  language  and  the  clichés  of  the
moment. In other words, slang. To let people know that he knew better than to
use slang in writing, he decided to capitalize all suspicious words and phrases. He
was mortally afraid people would think he was illiterate.”

He  needn’t  have  worried;  by  1900  the  Fables  were  so  popular  that  he  was
earning $1,000 a week. Here’s “The Fable of the Subordinate Who Saw a Great
Light”:

Once there was an Employé who was getting the Nub End of the Deal. He
kicked  on  the  long  Hours  and  the  small  Salary,  and  helped  to  organize  a
Clerks’  Protective  Association.  He  was  for  the  Toiler  as  against  the  Main
Squeeze.

To keep him simmered down, the Owners gave him an Interest. After that
he began to perspire when he looked at the Pay-Roll, and it did seem to him
that  a  lot  of  big,  lazy  Lummixes  were  standing  around  the  shop  doing  the
Soldier Act. He learned to snap his Fingers every time the Office Boy giggled.
As  for  the  faithful  old  Book-Keeper  who  wanted  an  increase  to  $9  and  a
week’s  Vacation  in  the  Summer,  the  best  he  got  was  a  little  Talk  about
Contentment being a Jewel.

The  saddest  moment  of  the  Day  for  him  was  when  the  whole  Bunch
knocked off at 6 o’clock in the Evening. It seemed a Shame to call 10 Hours a
Full  Day.  As  for  the  Saturday  Half-Holiday  Movement,  that  was  little  better
than  Highway  Robbery.  Those  who  formerly  slaved  alongside  of  him  in  the
Galleys had to address him as Mister, and he had them numbered the same
as Convicts.

One day an Underling ventured to remind the Slave-Driver that once he

had been the Friend of the Salaried Minion.

“Right you are,” said the Boss. “But when I plugged for the lowly Wage-
Earner I never had been in the Directors’ Office to see the beautiful Tableau
entitled  ‘Virtue  copping  out  the  Annual  Dividend.’  I  don’t  know  that  I  can
make the situation clear to you, so I will merely remark that all those who get
on  our  side  of  the  Fence  are  enabled  to  catch  a  new  Angle  on  this  Salary
Question.”

Moral: For Educational Purposes, every Employé should be taken into the

Firm.

The universal truth in that hundred-year-old gem is still true today, as it is in
almost all the Fables. “Ade was my first influence as a humorist,” S. J. Perelman
told me. “He had a social sense of history. His pictures of Hoosier life at the turn
of  the  century  are  more  documentary  than  any  of  those  studies  on  how  much
people paid for their coal. His humor was rooted in a perception of people and
places.  He  had  a  cutting  edge  and  an  acerbic  wit  that  no  earlier  American
humorist had.”

From Ade I proceeded to Ring Lardner, author of the classic line “Shut up, he
explained,”  partly  to  demonstrate  that  dramatic  dialogue  is  another  form  that
can  serve  the  humorist.  I’m  a  pushover  for  Lardner’s  nonsense  plays,  which  he
presumably  wrote  just  to  amuse  himself.  But  he  was  also  lampooning  the  holy
conventions  of  playwriting,  in  which  yards  of  italic  type  are  used  to  establish
what’s happening onstage. Act I of Lardner’s I Gaspiri (The Upholsterers) consists
of ten lines of dialogue, none of it involving the listed characters, and nine lines
of  irrelevant  italic,  concluding  with  “The  curtain  is  lowered  for  seven  days  to
denote the lapse of a week.” In his career Lardner would put humor to powerful
use in many literary forms, such as the baseball novel, You Know Me, Al. His ear
was perfectly tuned to American piety and self-delusion.

Next I resurrected Archy and Mehitabel,  by  Don  Marquis,  to  show  that  this
influential  humorist  also  used  an  unorthodox  medium—doggerel—for  his
message.  Marquis,  a  columnist  for  the  New  York  Sun,  stumbled  on  a  novel
solution  to  the  newspaperman’s  brutal  problem  of  meeting  a  deadline  and
presenting  his  material  in  orderly  prose,  just  as  Ade  stumbled  on  the  fable.  In
1916 he created the cockroach Archy, who banged out free verse on Marquis’s
typewriter  at  night,  minus  capital  letters  because  he  wasn’t  strong  enough  to
press  the  shift  key.  Archy’s  poems,  describing  his  friendship  with  a  cat  named
Mehitabel, are of a philosophical bent that one wouldn’t guess from their ragged
appearance.  No  formal  essay  could  more  thoroughly  deflate  the  aging  actors
who  bemoan  the  current  state  of  the  theater  than  Marquis  does  in  “The  Old
Trouper,” a long poem in which Archy describes Mehitabel’s meeting with an old
theater cat named Tom:

i come of a long line
of theatre cats
my grandfather
was with forrest
he had it he was a real trouper …

Marquis  was  using  the  cat  to  leaven  his  impatience  with  a  type  of  bore  he
knew well. It’s a universal impatience, whatever the category of old-timer, just as
it’s  a  universal  trait  of  old-timers  to  complain  that  their  field  has  gone  to  the
dogs.  Marquis  achieves  one  of  the  classic  functions  of  humor:  to  deflect  anger
into a channel where we can laugh at frailty instead of railing against it.

The  next  writers  on  my  tour  were  Donald  Ogden  Stewart,  Robert  Benchley
and Frank Sullivan, who greatly broadened the possibilities of “free association”
humor.  Benchley  added  a  dimension  of  warmth  and  vulnerability  that  wasn’t
present  in  humorists  like  Ade  and  Marquis,  who  ducked  into  impersonal  forms
like fable and doggerel, where they could hide. Nobody is better than Benchley
at diving headlong into his subject:

St.  Francis  of  Assisi  (unless  I  am  getting  him  mixed  up  with  St.  Simeon
Stylites, which might be very easy to do as both their names begin with “St.”)
was very fond of birds, and often had his picture taken with them sitting on
his shoulders and pecking at his wrists. That was all right, if St. Francis liked it.
We all have our likes and dislikes, and I have more of a feeling for dogs.

Perhaps they were all just paving the way for S. J. Perelman. If so, Perelman
gratefully  acknowledged  the  debt.  “You  must  learn  by  imitation,”  he  said.  “I
could have been arrested for imitating Lardner in my pieces in the late 1920s—
not the content, but the manner. These influences gradually fall away.”

His  own  influence  hasn’t  been  so  easily  shed.  At  his  death  in  1979  he  had
been writing steadily for more than half a century, putting the language through
breathtaking loops, and the woods are still full of writers and comics who were
drawn  into  the  gravitational  pull  of  his  style  and  never  quite  got  back  out.  It
doesn’t take a detective to see Perelman’s hand not only in writers like Woody
Allen  but  in  the  BBC’s  Goon  Show  and  Monty  Python,  in  the  radio  skits  of  Bob
and  Ray,  and  in  the  glancing  wit  of  Groucho  Marx—an  influence  more  easily
traceable because Perelman wrote several of the Marx Brothers’ early movies.

What  he  created  was  an  awareness  that  when  the  writer’s  mind  works  by
free  association  it  can  ricochet  from  the  normal  to  the  absurd  and,  by  the
unexpectedness  of  its  angle,  demolish  whatever  trite  idea  had  been  there
before. Onto this element of constant surprise he grafted the dazzling wordplay
that was his trademark, a rich and recondite vocabulary, and an erudition based
on reading and travel.

But even that mixture wouldn’t have sustained him if he hadn’t had a target.
“All humor must be about something—it must touch concretely on life,” he said,
and although readers savoring his style may lose sight of his motive, some form
of  pomposity  lies  in  ruins  at  the  end  of  a  Perelman  piece,  just  as  grand  opera
never quite recovered from the Marx Brothers’ A Night at the Opera or banking
from  W.  C.  Fields’s  The  Bank  Dick.  He  was  seldom  at  a  loss  for  charlatans  and
knaves,  especially  in  the  worlds  of  Broadway,  Hollywood,  advertising  and
merchandising.

I  still  remember  the  teenage  moment  when  I  first  got  hit  by  one  of
Perelman’s sentences. His sentences were unlike any I had ever seen, and they
fractured me:

The  whistle  shrilled  and  in  a  moment  I  was  chugging  out  of  Grand
Central’s dreaming spires. I had chugged only a few feet when I realized that I
had left without the train, so I had to run back and wait for it to start.... With
only two hours in Chicago I would be unable to see the city, and the thought
drew me into a state of composure. I noted with pleasure that a fresh coat of
grime  had  been  given  to  the  Dearborn  Street  station,  though  I  was  hardly
vain enough to believe that it had anything to do with my visit.

Women loved this impetual Irish adventurer who would rather fight than
eat  and  vice-versa.  One  night  he  was  chafing  at  The  Bit,  a  tavern  in
Portsmouth,  when  he  overheard  a  chance  remark  from  a  brawny  gunner’s
mate in his cups.... The following morning the “Maid of Hull,” a frigate of the
line  mounting  36  guns,  out  of  Bath  and  into  bed  in  a  twinkling,  dropped
downstream  on  the  tide,  bound  for  Bombay,  object  matrimony.  On  her  as
passenger went my great-grandfather.... Fifty-three days later, living almost
entirely on cameo brooches and the ptarmigan which fell to the ptrigger of
his pfowling piece, he at last sighted the towers of Ishpeming, the Holy City
of the Surds and Cosines, fanatical Mohammedan warrior sects.

My classroom survey ended with Woody Allen, the most cerebral practitioner
of the trade. Allen’s magazine pieces, now collected in three books, constitute a
body of written humor unique for being both intellectual and hilarious, probing
not  only  his  well-known  themes  of  death  and  anxiety  but  such  overbearing
academic  disciplines  and  literary  forms  as  philosophy,  psychology,  drama,  Irish
poetry  and  the  explication  of  texts  (“Hasidic  Tales”).  “A  Look  at  Organized
Crime,”  a  parody  of  all  the  articles  ever  written  explaining  the  Mafia,  is  one  of
the  funniest  pieces  I  know,  and  “The  Schmeed  Memoirs”—the  recollections  of
Hitler’s barber—is the ultimate jab at the “good German” who was just doing his
job:

I have been asked if I was aware of the moral implications of what I was
doing. As I told the tribunal at Nuremberg, I did not know that Hitler was a
Nazi.  The  truth  was  that  for  years  I  thought  he  worked  for  the  phone
company. When I finally did find out what a monster he was, it was too late
to  do  anything,  as  I  had  made  a  down  payment  on  some  furniture.  Once,
toward  the  end  of  the  war,  I  did  contemplate  loosening  the  Führer’s  neck-
napkin  and  allowing  some  tiny  hairs  to  get  down  his  back,  but  at  the  last
minute my nerve failed me.

The  brief  excerpts  in  this  chapter  can  convey  only  a  glimmer  of  the  vast
output and artistry of these giants. But I wanted my students to know that they
were  working  within  a  long  tradition  of  serious  intent  and  considerable  nerve,
one that is still alive in the work of such writers as Ian Frazier, Garrison Keillor,

Fran Lebowitz, Nora Ephron, Calvin Trillin and Mark Singer. Singer is the current
star  in  a  long  lineage  of  New  Yorker  writers—St.  Clair  McKelway,  Robert  Lewis
Taylor,  Lillian  Ross,  Wolcott  Gibbs—who  used  deadpan  humor  to  assassinate
such  public  nuisances  as  Walter  Winchell,  leaving  hardly  a  mark  where  their
stiletto broke the skin.

Singer’s  lethal  potion  is  concocted  of  hundreds  of  outlandish  facts  and
quotes—he is a tenacious reporter—and a style that barely suppresses his own
amusement. It works particularly well on the buccaneers who continue to try the
patience  of  the  citizenry,  as  proved  by  his  profile  in  The  New  Yorker  of  the
developer  Donald  Trump.  Noting  that  Trump  “had  aspired  to  and  achieved  the
ultimate  luxury,  an  existence  unmolested  by  the  rumbling  of  a  soul,”  Singer
describes  a  visit  to  Mar-a-Lago,  the  Palm  Beach  spa  converted  by  Trump  from
the 118-room Hispano-Moorish-Venetian mansion built in the 1920s by Marjorie
Merriweather Post and E. F. Hutton:

Evidently,  Trump’s  philosophy  of  wellness  is  rooted  in  a  belief  that
prolonged  exposure  to  exceptionally  attractive  young  spa  attendants  will
instill  in  the  male  clientele  a  will  to  live.  Accordingly,  he  limits  his  role  to  a
pocket  veto  of  key  hiring  decisions.  While  giving  me  a  tour  of  the  main
exercise room, where Tony Bennett, who does a couple of gigs at Mar-a-Lago
each season and had been designated an “artist-in-residence,” was taking a
brisk  walk  on  a  treadmill,  Trump  introduced  me  to  “our  resident  physician,
Dr.  Ginger  Lee  Southall”—a  recent  chiropractic-college  graduate.  As  Dr.
Ginger,  out  of  earshot,  manipulated  the  sore  back  of  a  grateful  member,  I
asked  Trump  where  she  had  done  her  training.  “I’m  not  sure,”  he  said.
“Baywatch  Medical  School?  Does  that  sound  right?  I’ll  tell  you  the  truth.
Once I saw Dr. Ginger’s photograph, I didn’t really need to look at her résumé
or  anyone  else’s.  Are  you  asking,  ‘Did  we  hire  her  because  she  trained  at
Mount  Sinai  for  fifteen  years?’  The  answer  is  no.  And  I’ll  tell  you  why:
because by the time she’s spent fifteen years at Mount Sinai, we don’t want
to look at her.”

Of  all  the  current  humorists,  Garrison  Keillor  has  the  surest  eye  for  social
change  and  the  most  inventive  mind  for  making  his  point  obliquely.  Again  and
again he gives us the pleasure of encountering an old genre dressed up in new
clothes. America’s current hostility to cigarette smokers is a trend that any alert
writer  might  have  noticed  and  written  about  with  due  sobriety.  This  approach,
however, is pure Keillor:

The last cigarette smokers in America were located in a box canyon south
of  Donner  Pass  in  the  High  Sierra  by  two  federal  tobacco  agents  in  a
helicopter who spotted the little smoke puffs just before noon. One of them,
the district chief, called in the ground team by air-to-ground radio. Six men in

camouflage  outfits,  members  of  a  crack  anti-smoking  joggers  unit,  moved
quickly  across  the  rugged  terrain,  surrounded  the  bunch  in  their  hideout,
subdued them with tear gas, and made them lie face down on the gravel in
the hot August sun. There were three females and two males, all in their mid-
forties.  They  had  been  on  the  run  since  the  adoption  of  the  Twenty-eighth
Amendment.

The genre that’s in Keillor’s head has been a staple of American newspapers
since  the  Dillinger  era  of  the  1930s,  and  his  enjoyment  of  that  form,  with  its
echoes  of  gangsters  and  G-men,  of  stakeouts  and  shootouts,  is  obvious  in  his
writing.

Another  situation  that  Keillor  obviously  enjoyed  having  found  a  perfect
framework for was the first Bush administration’s bailout of the savings-and-loan
industry. This is how his piece “How the Savings and Loans Were Saved” begins:

The  President  was  playing  badminton  in  Aspen  the  day  vast  hordes  of
barbaric Huns invaded Chicago, and a reporter whose aunt lives in Evanston
shouted  to  him  as  he  headed  for  the  clubhouse,  “The  Huns  are  wreaking
carnage in Chicago, Mr. President! Any comment?”

Mr. Bush, though caught off guard by news of the invasion, said, “We’re
following  that  whole  Hun  situation  very  closely,  and  right  now  it  looks
encouraging,  but  I’m  hoping  we  can  get  back  to  you  in  a  few  hours  with
something  more  definite.”  The  President  appeared  concerned  but  relaxed
and definitely chin-up and in charge.

The  piece  goes  on  to  describe  how  rapacious  barbarians  swarmed  into  the
city, “burned churches and performing-arts centers and historic restorations, and
dragged away monks, virgins and associate professors … to be sold into slavery”
and seized the savings-and-loan offices, provoking no action by President Bush,
however, because “exit polling at shopping malls showed that people thought he
was handling it O.K.”

The President decided not to interfere with the takeover attempts in the
savings-and-loan industry and to pay the hundred and sixty-six billion dollars,
not as a ransom of any type but as ordinary government support, plain and
simple, nothing irregular about it, and the Huns and the Vandals rode away,
carrying  their  treasure  with  them,  and  the  Goths  sailed  away  up  Lake
Michigan.

Keillor’s satire left me full of admiration—first for an act of humor so original,
but also for expressing the citizen outrage I hadn’t found a way to express. All I
had been able to muster was helpless anger that my grandchildren in their old

age would still be paying for Bush’s rescue of the industry that the greedy hordes
had plundered.

But there’s no law that says humor has to make a point. Pure nonsense is a
joy forever, as Keats didn’t quite say. I love to see a writer flying high, just for the
hell of it. The following two excerpts, from recent pieces by Ian Frazier and John
Updike,  are  100  percent  off-the-wall;  nothing  written  during  America’s  earlier
golden ages was any funnier. Frazier’s piece is called “Dating Your Mom,” and it
begins like this:

In  today’s  fast-moving,  transient,  rootless  society,  where  people  meet
and make love and part without ever really touching, the relationship every
guy  already  has  with  his  own  mother  is  too  valuable  to  ignore.  Here  is  a
grown, experienced, loving woman—one you do not have to go to a party or
a singles bar to meet, one you do not have to go to great lengths to get to
know. There are hundreds of times when you and your mother are thrown
together naturally, without the tension that usually accompanies courtship—
just the two of you, alone. All you need is a little presence of mind to take
advantage of these situations. Say your mom is driving you downtown in the
car to buy you a new pair of slacks. First, find a nice station on the car radio,
one  that  she  likes.  Get  into  the  pleasant  lull  of  freeway  driving—tires
humming along the pavement, air conditioner on max. Then turn to look at
her  across  the  front  seat  and  say  something  like,  “You  know,  you’ve  really
kept  your  shape,  Mom,  and  don’t  think  I  haven’t  noticed.”  Or  suppose  she
comes into your room to bring you some clean socks. Take her by the wrist,
pull her close, and say, “Mom, you’re the most fascinating woman I’ve ever
met.” Probably she’ll tell you to cut out the foolishness, but I can guarantee
you one thing: she will never tell your dad. Possibly she would find it hard to
say, “Dear, Piper just made a pass at me,” or possibly she is secretly flattered,
but whatever the reason, she will keep it to herself until the day comes when
she is no longer ashamed to tell the world of your love.

Updike’s  piece,  “Glad  Rags,”  though  no  less  an  act  of  bungee-jumping,
bringing  him  within  inches  of  the  rocks  at  the  bottom  of  the  gorge,  has  a
disturbing core of reality. Not only does it flirt with some of the nation’s darker
suppositions  about  J.  Edgar  Hoover;  it  deals  with  high-ranking  Americans  of
recent memory—a sainted President and his cabinet. What makes it work, for all
its  seeming  frivolity,  is  Updike’s  meticulous  research.  You  can  bet  that  all  the
details—names, dates and fashion terminology—are correct:

To  those  of  us  who  were  alive  and  sartorially  active  at  the  time,  it  was
saddening to read in the Boston Globe recently the allegation, by “New York
socialite” Susan Rosenstiel, that in 1958 J. Edgar Hoover was parading around
in  a  Plaza  Hotel  suite  wearing  women’s  clothes:  “He  was  wearing  a  fluffy

black dress, very fluffy, with flounces, and lace stockings and high heels, and
a black curly wig.” I was saddened to think that future generations, trying to
grasp  the  peculiar  splendor  and  excitement  of  high-echelon  cross-dressing
during Eisenhower’s second term, will imagine that dowdy bit of black fluff,
with its fussy flounces and matching wig, to have been très à la mode, when
the truth is we all considered J. Edgar something of a frump.

Ike, for instance, dear Ike with his infallible instincts, would never have let
himself  be  caught  in  lace  stockings,  even  though  he  did  have  the  legs  for
them. I remember, within a month of Saint Laurent’s 1958 collection for Dior,
Ike  coming  out  in  a  stunning  cobalt-blue  wool  trapeze,  with  white  open-
backed  heels  and  a  false  chignon.  That  very  day,  if  memory  serves,  he  had
sent  five  thousand  marines  to  Lebanon,  and  not  a  hair  out  of  place.  It  was
with this outfit—or was it a belted A-line from the previous year?—that he
sported  a  flowered  silk  neck  cloth,  when  scarves  were  still  thought  to  be
strictly  for  babushkas.  He  was  very  conservative  as  to  hemlines,  however;
when  Saint  Laurent  lifted  skirts  to  the  knee  in  1959,  the  President  waited
three months for Congress to decide the issue, and then, losing all patience,
switched to Balenciaga with a stroke of his pen. Thenceforth, to the very end
of his administration, he stuck with long-waisted day dresses in neutral duns
and beiges.

John Foster Dulles, on the other hand, favored a slinky-pajama look and
pastel  pants  suits  with  a  touch  of  glimmer  in  the  fabric.  Oodles  of  bangles,
upswept  blond  wigs,  and  pom-pommed  mules.  Despite  his  staunch  anti-
Communism, he was oddly partial to red, though I believe on good authority
that Sherman Adams at least once took Foster aside and made the point that
bright  colors  did  not  become  a  big-boned  frame.  Sherman,  though  he  was
undone  by  vicuña,  lingers  in  my  mind’s  eye  as  a  creature  of  whimsical
ostrich-feather boas and enchantments in lightly starched lemon voile....

Enjoyment, finally, is what all humorists must convey—the idea that they are
having a terrific time, and this notion of cranked-up audacity is what I wanted my
Yale students to grapple with. At first I told them to write in one of the existing
humor forms—satire, parody, lampoon, etc.—and not to use “I” or to write from
their  own  experience.  I  assigned  the  same  topic  to  the  whole  class,  bringing  in
some absurdity I had noticed in the newspaper. The students jumped boldly into
free association, surrealism and nonsense. They found that it was possible to slip
off  the  chains  of  logic  and  to  have  fun  making  a  serious  point  within  a  given
humor  form.  They  were  heavily  under  the  influence  of  Woody  Allen’s  non
sequiturs (“For this the Rabbi bashes his head in, which, according to the Torah,
is one of the most subtle methods of showing concern”).

After about four weeks, fatigue set in. The students learned that they were
capable  of  writing  humor.  But  they  also  learned  how  tiring  it  is  to  sustain  a
weekly act of comic invention, writing in other voices. It was time to slow down

their  metabolism—to  start  them  writing  in  their  own  voice,  about  their  own
lives. I declared a moratorium on Woody Allen and said I would tell them when
they could read him again. That day never came.

I adopted the Chic Young principle—stick to what you know—and began to
read from writers who use humor as a vein that runs quietly through their work.
One piece was E. B. White’s “The Eye of Edna,” in which White recalls waiting on
his Maine farm for the arrival of Hurricane Edna while listening for several days
to  inane  radio  reports  of  its  progress.  It’s  a  perfect  essay,  full  of  wisdom  and
gentle wit.

Another writer whose work I excavated was Stephen Leacock, a Canadian. I
recalled him from my boyhood as hilarious but was afraid that, as often happens
in looking up old friends, he would turn out to be merely “comical.” His pieces,
however,  had  survived  the  erosion  of  time,  and  one  that  I  particularly
remembered—“My Financial Career,” in which he tries to open a bank account
with $56—still seems the model piece of humor on how rattled we all become
when  dealing  with  banks,  libraries  and  other  uptight  institutions.  Rereading
Leacock  reminded  me  that  another  function  of  the  humorist  is  to  represent
himself or herself as the victim or dunce, helpless in most situations. It’s therapy
for readers, enabling them to feel superior to the writer, or at least to identify
with a fellow victim. A humorist who deals with ordinary life never runs out of
material, as Erma Bombeck enjoyably proved over many decades.

So that was the direction in which our Yale humor class began to move. Many
of  the  students  wrote  about  their  families.  We  ran  into  problems,  mainly  of
exaggeration,  and  gradually  solved  them,  trying  to  achieve  control,  cutting  the
extra sentence that explains a funny point that is already implicit. A hard decision
was  to  know  how  much  exaggeration  was  allowable  and  how  much  was  too
much.  One  student  wrote  a  funny  piece  about  what  a  terrible  cook  his
grandmother  was.  When  I  praised  it  he  said  she  was  really  a  very  good  cook.  I
said I was sorry to hear it—somehow the piece now seemed less funny. He asked
if that made a difference. I said it didn’t make a difference in this piece, since I
had enjoyed it without knowing it was untrue, but that I thought he would last
longer if he started from the truth rather than from invention—surely one secret
of  James  Thurber’s  longevity  as  a  major  American  humorist.  In  Thurber’s  “The
Night the Bed Fell” we know that he has slightly enlarged the facts. But we also
know that something happened to the bed that night in the attic.

In short, our class began by striving first for humor and hoping to wing a few
truths along the way. We ended by striving for truth and hoping to add humor
along the way. Ultimately we realized that the two are intertwined.

The Sound of Your Voice

I wrote one book about baseball and one about jazz. But it never occurred to me
to  write  one  of  them  in  sports  English  and  the  other  in  jazz  English.  I  tried  to
write them both in the best English I could, in my usual style. Though the books
were  widely  different  in  subject,  I  wanted  readers  to  know  that  they  were
hearing  from  the  same  person.  It  was  my  book  about  baseball  and  my  book
about  jazz.  Other  writers  would  write  their  book.  My  commodity  as  a  writer,
whatever I’m writing about, is me. And your commodity is you. Don’t alter your
voice to fit your subject. Develop one voice that readers will recognize when they
hear it on the page, a voice that’s enjoyable not only in its musical line but in its
avoidance of sounds that would cheapen its tone: breeziness and condescension
and clichés.

Let’s start with breeziness.
There is a kind of writing that sounds so relaxed that you think you hear the
author  talking  to  you.  E.  B.  White  was  probably  its  best  practitioner,  though
many other masters of the style—James Thurber, V. S. Pritchett, Lewis Thomas—
come to mind. I’m partial to it because it’s a style I’ve always tried to write. The
common assumption is that the style is effortless. In fact the opposite is true: the
effortless style is achieved by strenuous effort and constant refining. The nails of
grammar  and  syntax  are  in  place  and  the  English  is  as  good  as  the  writer  can
make it.

Here’s how a typical piece by E. B. White begins:

I spent several days and nights in mid-September with an ailing pig and I
feel driven to account for this stretch of time, more particularly since the pig
died  at  last,  and  I  lived,  and  things  might  easily  have  gone  the  other  way
round and none left to do the accounting.

The  sentence  is  so  folksy  that  we  imagine  ourselves  sitting  on  the  porch  of
White’s  house  in  Maine.  White  is  in  a  rocking  chair,  puffing  on  a  pipe,  and  the
words just tumble out in his storyteller’s voice. But look at the sentence again.
Nothing  about  it  is  accidental.  It’s  a  disciplined  act  of  writing.  The  grammar  is

formal, the words are plain and precise, and the cadences are those of a poet.
That’s  the  effortless  style  at  its  best:  a  methodical  act  of  composition  that
disarms  us  with  its  generated  warmth.  The  writer  sounds  confident;  he’s  not
trying to ingratiate himself with the reader.

Inexperienced writers miss this point. They think that all they have to do to
achieve a casual effect is to be “just folks”—good old Betty or Bob chatting over
the  back  fence.  They  want  to  be  a  pal  to  the  reader.  They’re  so  eager  not  to
appear formal that they don’t even try to write good English. What they write is
the breezy style.

How would a breezy writer handle E. B. White’s vigil with the pig? He might

sound like this:

Ever stay up late babysitting for a sick porker? Believe you me, a guy can
lose  a  heckuva  lot  of  shut-eye.  I  did  that  gig  for  three  nights  back  in
September  and  my  better  half  thought  I’d  lost  my  marbles.  (Just  kidding,
Pam!) Frankly, the whole deal kind of bummed me out. Because, you see, the
pig  up  and  died  on  me.  To  tell  you  the  truth,  I  wasn’t  feeling  in  the  pink
myself,  so  I  suppose  it  could  have  been  yours  truly  and  not  old  Porky  who
kicked the bucket. And you can bet your bottom dollar Mr. Pig wasn’t going
to write a book about it!

There’s  no  need  to  labor  all  the  reasons  why  this  stuff  is  so  terrible.  It’s
crude.  It’s  corny.  It’s  verbose.  It’s  contemptuous  of  the  English  language.  It’s
condescending. (I stop reading writers who say “You see.”) But the most pathetic
thing about the breezy style is that it’s harder to read than good English. In the
writer’s  attempt  to  ease  the  reader’s  journey  he  has  littered  the  path  with
obstacles:  cheap  slang,  shoddy  sentences,  windy  philosophizing.  E.  B.  White’s
style  is  much  easier  to  read.  He  knows  that  the  tools  of  grammar  haven’t
survived for so many centuries by chance; they are props the reader needs and
subconsciously wants. Nobody ever stopped reading E. B. White or V. S. Pritchett
because the writing was too good. But readers will stop reading you if they think
you are talking down to them. Nobody wants to be patronized.

Write  with  respect  for  the  English  language  at  its  best—and  for  readers  at
their best. If you’re smitten by the urge to try the breezy style, read what you’ve
written aloud and see if you like the sound of your voice.

Finding a voice that your readers will enjoy is largely a matter of taste. Saying
that isn’t much help—taste is a quality so intangible that it can’t even be defined.
But we know it when we meet it. A woman with taste in clothes delights us with
her  ability  to  turn  herself  out  in  a  combination  that’s  not  only  stylish  and
surprising, but exactly right. She knows what works and what doesn’t.

For  writers  and  other  creative  artists,  knowing  what  not  to  do  is  a  major
component  of  taste.  Two  jazz  pianists  may  be  equally  proficient.  The  one  with
taste  will  put  every  note  to  useful  work  in  telling  his  or  her  story;  the  one

without  taste  will  drench  us  in  ripples  and  other  unnecessary  ornaments.
Painters  with  taste  will  trust  their  eye  to  tell  them  what  needs  to  be  on  the
canvas and what doesn’t; a painter without taste will give us a landscape that’s
too  pretty,  or  too  cluttered,  or  too  gaudy—anyway,  too  something.  A  graphic
designer  with  taste  knows  that  less  is  more:  that  design  is  the  servant  of  the
written  word.  A  designer  without  taste  will  smother  the  writing  in  background
tints and swirls and decorative frills.

I  realize  I’m  trying  to  pin  down  a  matter  that’s  subjective;  one  person’s
beautiful  object  is  somebody  else’s  kitsch.  Taste  can  also  change  from  one
decade  to  another—yesterday’s  charm  is  derided  today  as  junk,  but  it  will  be
back in vogue tomorrow, certified again as charming. So why do I even raise the
issue?  Just  to  remind  you  that  it  exists.  Taste  is  an  invisible  current  that  runs
through writing, and you should be aware of it.

Sometimes,  in  fact,  it’s  visible.  Every  art  form  has  a  core  of  verities  that
survive the fickleness of time. There must be something innately pleasing in the
proportions of the Parthenon; Western man continues to let the Greeks of two
thousand  years  ago  design  his  public  buildings,  as  anyone  walking  around
Washington, D.C., soon discovers. The fugues of Bach have a timeless elegance
that’s rooted in the timeless laws of mathematics.

Does  writing  have  any  such  guideposts  for  us?  Not  many;  writing  is  the
expression  of  every  person’s  individuality,  and  we  know  what  we  like  when  it
comes  along.  Again,  however,  much  can  be  gained  by  knowing  what  to  omit.
Clichés, for instance. If a writer lives in blissful ignorance that clichés are the kiss
of death, if in the final analysis he leaves no stone unturned to use them, we can
infer that he lacks an instinct for what gives language its freshness. Faced with a
choice  between  the  novel  and  the  banal,  he  goes  unerringly  for  the  banal.  His
voice is the voice of a hack.

Not that clichés are easy to stamp out. They are everywhere in the air around
us, familiar friends just waiting to be helpful, ready to express complex ideas for
us  in  the  shorthand  form  of  metaphor.  That’s  how  they  became  clichés  in  the
first place, and even careful writers use quite a few on their first draft. But after
that we are given a chance to clean them out. Clichés are one of the things you
should  keep  listening  for  when  you  rewrite  and  read  your  successive  drafts
aloud. Notice how incriminating they sound, convicting you of being satisfied to
use  the  same  old  chestnuts  instead  of  making  an  effort  to  replace  them  with
fresh phrases of your own. Clichés are the enemy of taste.

Extend  the  point  beyond  individual  clichés  to  your  larger  use  of  language.
Again, freshness is crucial. Taste chooses words that have surprise, strength and
precision.  Non-taste  slips  into  the  breezy  vernacular  of  the  alumni  magazine’s
class notes—a world where people in authority are the top brass or the powers
that be. What exactly is wrong with “the top brass”? Nothing—and everything.
Taste  knows  that  it’s  better  to  call  people  in  authority  what  they  are:  officials,
executives, chairmen, presidents, directors, managers. Non-taste reaches for the

corny synonym, which has the further disadvantage of being imprecise; exactly
which  company  officers  are  the  top  brass?  Non-taste  uses  “umpteenth.”  And
“zillions.” Non-taste uses “period”: “She said she didn’t want to hear any more
about it. Period.”

But  finally  taste  is  a  mixture  of  qualities  that  are  beyond  analyzing:  an  ear
that can hear the difference between a sentence that limps and a sentence that
lilts, an intuition that knows when a casual or a vernacular phrase dropped into a
formal  sentence  will  not  only  sound  right  but  will  seem  to  be  the  inevitable
choice.  (E.  B.  White  was  a  master  of  that  balancing  act.)  Does  this  mean  that
taste can be learned? Yes and no. Perfect taste, like perfect pitch, is a gift from
God.  But  a  certain  amount  can  be  acquired.  The  trick  is  to  study  writers  who
have it.

Never  hesitate  to  imitate  another  writer.  Imitation  is  part  of  the  creative
process for anyone learning an art or a craft. Bach and Picasso didn’t spring full-
blown as Bach and Picasso; they needed models. This is especially true of writing.
Find  the  best  writers  in  the  fields  that  interest  you  and  read  their  work  aloud.
Get  their  voice  and  their  taste  into  your  ear—their  attitude  toward  language.
Don’t  worry  that  by  imitating  them  you’ll  lose  your  own  voice  and  your  own
identity.  Soon  enough  you  will  shed  those  skins  and  become  who  you  are
supposed to become.

By  reading  other  writers  you  also  plug  yourself  into  a  longer  tradition  that
enriches you. Sometimes you will tap a vein of eloquence or racial memory that
gives your writing a depth it could never attain on its own. Let me illustrate what
I mean by a roundabout route.

Ordinarily I don’t read the proclamations issued by state officials to designate
important  days  of  the  year  as  important  days  of  the  year.  But  in  1976,  when  I
was teaching at Yale, the governor of Connecticut, Ella Grasso, had the pleasant
idea  of  reissuing  the  Thanksgiving  Proclamation  written  40  years  earlier  by
Governor  Wilbur  Cross,  which  she  called  “a  masterpiece  of  eloquence.”  I  often
wonder  whether  eloquence  has  vanished  from  American  life,  or  whether  we
even  still  consider  it  a  goal  worth  striving  for.  So  I  studied  Governor  Cross’s
words to see how they had weathered the passage of time, that cruel judge of
the  rhetoric  of  earlier  generations.  I  was  delighted  to  find  that  I  agreed  with
Governor Grasso. It was a piece written by a master:

Time out of mind at this turn of the seasons when the hardy oak leaves
rustle in the wind and the frost gives a tang to the air and the dusk falls early
and  the  friendly  evenings  lengthen  under  the  heel  of  Orion,  it  has  seemed
good  to  our  people  to  join  together  in  praising  the  Creator  and  Preserver,
who  has  brought  us  by  a  way  that  we  did  not  know  to  the  end  of  another
year.  In  observance  of  this  custom,  I  appoint  Thursday,  the  26th  of
November, as a day of Public Thanksgiving for the blessings that have been
our common lot and have placed our beloved state with the favored regions

of earth—for all the creature comforts: the yield of the soil that has fed us
and  the  richer  yield  from  labor  of  every  kind  that  has  sustained  our  lives—
and  for  all  those  things,  as  dear  as  breath  to  the  body,  that  quicken  man’s
faith  in  his  manhood,  that  nourish  and  strengthen  his  word  and  act;  for
honor  held  above  price;  for  steadfast  courage  and  zeal  in  the  long,  long
search  after  truth;  for  liberty  and  for  justice  freely  granted  by  each  to  his
fellow  and  so  as  freely  enjoyed;  and  for  the  crowning  glory  and  mercy  of
peace upon our land—that we may humbly take heart of these blessings as
we  gather  once  again  with  solemn  and  festive  rites  to  keep  our  Harvest
Home.

Governor  Grasso  added  a  postscript  urging  the  citizens  of  Connecticut  “to
renew  their  dedication  to  the  spirit  of  sacrifice  and  commitment  which  the
Pilgrims invoked during their first harsh winter in the New World,” and I made a
mental  note  to  look  at  Orion  that  night.  I  was  glad  to  be  reminded  that  I  was
living in one of the favored regions of earth. I was also glad to be reminded that
peace is not the only crowning glory to be thankful for. So is the English language
when it is gracefully used for the public good. The cadences of Jefferson, Lincoln,
Churchill,  Roosevelt  and  Adlai  Stevenson  came  rolling  down  to  me.  (The
cadences of Eisenhower, Nixon and the two Bushes did not.)

I posted the Thanksgiving Proclamation on a bulletin board for my students
to  enjoy.  From  their  comments  I  realized  that  several  of  them  thought  I  was
being  facetious.  Knowing  my  obsession  with  simplicity,  they  assumed  that  I
regarded Governor Cross’s message as florid excess.

The  incident  left  me  with  several  questions.  Had  I  sprung  Wilbur  Cross’s
prose on a generation that had never been exposed to nobility of language as a
means of addressing the populace? I couldn’t recall a single attempt since John F.
Kennedy’s  inaugural  speech  in  1961.  (Mario  Cuomo  and  Jesse  Jackson  would
partly  restore  my  faith.)  This  was  a  generation  reared  on  television,  where  the
picture is valued more than the word—where the word, in fact, is devalued, used
as mere chatter and often misused and mispronounced. It was also a generation
reared on music—songs and rhythms meant primarily to be heard and felt. With
so  much  noise  in  the  air,  was  any  American  child  being  trained  to  listen?  Was
anyone calling attention to the majesty of a well-constructed sentence?

My  other  question  raised  a  more  subtle  mystery:  what  is  the  line  that
separates eloquence from bombast? Why are we exalted by the words of Wilbur
Cross  and  anesthetized  by  the  speeches  of  most  politicians  and  public  officials
who ply us with oratorical ruffles and flourishes?

Part of the answer takes us back to taste. A writer with an ear for language
will reach for fresh imagery and avoid phrases that are trite. The hack will reach
for those very clichés, thinking he will enrich his thoughts with currency that is,
as he would put it, tried and true. Another part of the answer lies in simplicity.
Writing  that  will  endure  tends  to  consist  of  words  that  are  short  and  strong;

words  that  sedate  are  words  of  three,  four  and  five  syllables,  mostly  of  Latin
origin, many of them ending in “ion” and embodying a vague concept. In Wilbur
Cross’s Thanksgiving Proclamation there are no four-syllable words and only ten
three-syllable words, three of which are proper nouns he was stuck with. Notice
how many of the governor’s words are anything but vague: leaves, wind, frost,
air,  evening,  earth,  comforts,  soil,  labor,  breath,  body,  justice,  courage,  peace,
land,  rites,  home.  They  are  homely  words  in  the  best  sense—they  catch  the
rhythm of the seasons and the dailiness of life. Also notice that all of them are
nouns.  After  verbs,  plain  nouns  are  your  strongest  tools;  they  resonate  with
emotion.

But ultimately eloquence runs on a deeper current. It moves us with what it
leaves  unsaid,  touching  off  echoes  in  what  we  already  know  from  our  reading,
our  religion  and  our  heritage.  Eloquence  invites  us  to  bring  some  part  of
ourselves  to  the  transaction.  It  was  no  accident  that  Lincoln’s  speeches
resounded with echoes of the King James Bible; he knew it almost by heart from
his  boyhood,  and  he  had  so  soaked  himself  in  its  sonorities  that  his  formal
English  was  more  Elizabethan  than  American.  The  Second  Inaugural  Address
reverberates  with  Biblical  phrases  and  paraphrases:  “It  may  seem  strange  that
any men should dare to ask a just God’s assistance in wringing their bread from
the sweat of other men’s faces, but let us judge not, that we be not judged.” The
first  half  of  the  sentence  borrows  a  metaphor  from  Genesis,  the  second  half
reshapes a famous command in Matthew, and “a just God” is from Isaiah.

If  this  speech  affects  me  more  than  any  other  American  document,  it’s  not
only  because  I  know  that  Lincoln  was  killed  five  weeks  later,  or  because  I’m
moved by all the pain that culminated in his plea for a reconciliation that would
have  malice  toward  none  and  charity  for  all.  It’s  also  because  Lincoln  tapped
some of Western man’s oldest teachings about slavery, clemency and judgment.
His  words  carried  stern  overtones  for  the  men  and  women  who  heard  him  in
1865, reared, as he was, on the Bible. But even in the 21st century it’s hard not
to feel a wrath almost too ancient to grasp in Lincoln’s notion that God might will
the  Civil  War  to  continue  “until  all  the  wealth  piled  by  the  bondsman’s  two
hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of
blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was
said three thousand years ago, so still it must be said ‘the judgments of the Lord
are true and righteous altogether.’”

Wilbur  Cross’s  Thanksgiving  Proclamation  also  echoes  with  truths  that  we
know  in  our  bones.  To  such  mysteries  as  the  changing  of  the  seasons  and  the
bounty  of  the  earth  we  bring  strong  emotions  of  our  own.  Who  hasn’t  looked
with awe at Orion? To such democratic processes as “the long search after truth”
and “liberty and justice freely granted” we bring fragments of our own searches
after truth, our own grantings and receivings, in a nation where so many human
rights  have  been  won  and  so  many  still  elude  us.  Governor  Cross  doesn’t  take
our  time  to  explain  these  processes,  and  I’m  grateful  to  him  for  that.  I  hate  to

think  how  many  clichés  a  hack  orator  would  marshal  to  tell  us  far  more—and
nourish us far less.

Therefore  remember  the  uses  of  the  past  when  you  tell  your  story.  What
moves us in writing that has regional or ethnic roots—Southern writing, African-
American writing, Jewish-American writing—is the sound of voices far older than
the  narrator’s,  talking  in  cadences  that  are  more  than  ordinarily  rich.  Toni
Morrison, one of the most eloquent of black writers, once said: “I remember the
language of the people I grew up with. Language was so important to them. All
that power was in it. And grace and metaphor. Some of it was very formal and
Biblical, because the habit is that when you have something important to say you
go into parable, if you’re from Africa, or you go into another level of language. I
wanted to use language that way, because my feeling was that a black novel was
not black because I wrote it, or because there were black people in it, or because
it was about black things. It was the style. It had a certain style. It was inevitable.
I couldn’t describe it, but I could produce it.”

Go with what seems inevitable in your own heritage. Embrace it and it may

lead you to eloquence.

21

Enjoyment, Fear and Confidence

As a boy I never wanted to grow up to be a writer, or—God forbid—an author. I
wanted to be a newspaperman, and the newspaper I wanted to be a man on was
the  New  York  Herald  Tribune.  Reading  it  every  morning,  I  loved  the  sense  of
enjoyment  it  conveyed.  Everyone  who  worked  on  the  paper—editors,  writers,
photographers, make-up men—was having a wonderful time. The articles usually
had  an  extra  touch  of  gracefulness,  or  humanity,  or  humor—some  gift  of
themselves  that  the  writers  and  editors  enjoyed  making  to  their  readers.  I
thought they were putting out the paper just for me. To be one of those editors
and writers was my idea of the ultimate American dream.

That  dream  came  true  when  I  returned  home  from  World  War  II  and  got  a
job  on  the  Herald  Tribune  staff.  I  brought  with  me  my  belief  that  a  sense  of
enjoyment is a priceless attribute for a writer or for a publication, and I was now
in  the  same  room  with  the  men  and  women  who  had  first  put  that  idea  in  my
head.  The  great  reporters  wrote  with  warmth  and  gusto,  and  the  great  critics
and columnists like Virgil Thomson and Red Smith wrote with elegance and with
a mirthful confidence in their opinions. On the “split page”—as the first page of
the second section was called, when papers only had two sections—the political
column  of  Walter  Lippmann,  America’s  most  venerated  pundit,  ran  above  the
one-panel cartoon by H. T. Webster, creator of “The Timid Soul,” who was also
an American institution. I liked the insouciance that presented on the same page
two features so different in gravity. Nobody thought of hustling Webster off to
the comics section. Both men were giants, part of the same equation.

Among those blithe souls a city-desk reporter named John O’Reilly, who was
admired for his deadpan coverage of human-interest and animal-interest stories,
managed  to  make  whimsy  a  serious  beat.  I  remember  his  annual  article  about
the woolly bear, the caterpillar whose brown and black stripes are said to foretell
by their width whether the coming winter will be harsh or mild. Every fall O’Reilly
would drive to Bear Mountain Park with the photographer Nat Fein, best known
for his Pulitzer Prize–winning shot of Babe Ruth’s farewell at Yankee Stadium, to
observe a sample of woolly bears crossing the road, and his article was written in
mock-scientific museum-expedition style, duly portentous. The paper always ran

the story at the bottom of page one under a three-column head, along with a cut
of a woolly bear, its stripes none too distinct. In the spring O’Reilly would write a
follow-up piece telling his readers whether the woolly bears had been right, and
nobody blamed him—or them—if they hadn’t. The point was to give everybody a
good time.

Since  then  I’ve  made  that  sense  of  enjoyment  my  credo  as  a  writer  and  an
editor.  Writing  is  such  lonely  work  that  I  try  to  keep  myself  cheered  up.  If
something  strikes  me  as  funny  in  the  act  of  writing,  I  throw  it  in  just  to  amuse
myself. If I think it’s funny I assume a few other people will find it funny, and that
seems  to  me  to  be  a  good  day’s  work.  It  doesn’t  bother  me  that  a  certain
number of readers will not be amused; I know that a fair chunk of the population
has  no  sense  of  humor—no  idea  that  there  are  people  in  the  world  trying  to
entertain them.

When I was teaching at Yale I invited the humorist S. J. Perelman to talk to
my  students,  and  one  of  them  asked  him,  “What  does  it  take  to  be  a  comic
writer?”  He  said,  “It  takes  audacity  and  exuberance  and  gaiety,  and  the  most
important one is audacity.” Then he said: “The reader has to feel that the writer
is feeling good.” The sentence went off in my head like a Roman candle: it stated
the entire case for enjoyment. Then he added: “Even if he isn’t.” That sentence
hit me almost as hard, because I knew that Perelman’s life contained more than
the usual share of depression and travail. Yet he went to his typewriter every day
and  made  the  English  language  dance.  How  could  he  not  be  feeling  good?  He
cranked it up.

Writers  have  to  jump-start  themselves  at  the  moment  of  performance,  no
less than actors and dancers and painters and musicians. There are some writers
who sweep us along so strongly in the current of their energy—Norman Mailer,
Tom  Wolfe,  Toni  Morrison,  William  F.  Buckley,  Jr.,  Hunter  Thompson,  David
Foster  Wallace,  Dave  Eggers—that  we  assume  that  when  they  go  to  work  the
words just flow. Nobody thinks of the effort they made every morning to turn on
the switch.

You also have to turn on the switch. Nobody is going to do it for you.
Unfortunately, an equally strong negative current—fear—is at work. Fear of
writing gets planted in most Americans at an early age, usually at school, and it
never  entirely  goes  away.  The  blank  piece  of  paper  or  the  blank  computer
screen,  waiting  to  be  filled  with  our  wonderful  words,  can  freeze  us  into  not
writing any words at all, or writing words that are less than wonderful. I’m often
dismayed by the sludge I see appearing on my screen if I approach writing as a
task—the  day’s  work—and  not  with  some  enjoyment.  My  only  consolation  is
that I’ll get another shot at those dismal sentences tomorrow and the next day
and  the  day  after.  With  each  rewrite  I  try  to  force  my  personality  onto  the
material.

Probably the biggest fear for nonfiction writers is the fear of not being able
to  bring  off  their  assignment.  With  fiction  it’s  a  different  situation.  Because

authors of fiction are writing about a world of their own invention, often in an
allusive  style  that  they  have  also  invented  (Thomas  Pynchon,  Don  DeLillo),  we
have no right to tell them, “That’s wrong.” We can only say, “It doesn’t work for
me.” Nonfiction writers get no such break. They are infinitely accountable: to the
facts,  to  the  people  they  interviewed,  to  the  locale  of  their  story  and  to  the
events that happened there. They are also accountable to their craft and all its
perils of excess and disorder: losing the reader, confusing the reader, boring the
reader,  not  keeping  the  reader  engaged  from  beginning  to  end.  With  every
inaccuracy of reporting and every misstep of craft we can say, “That’s wrong.”

How can you fight off all those fears of disapproval and failure? One way to
generate  confidence  is  to  write  about  subjects  that  interest  you  and  that  you
care about. The poet Allen Ginsberg, another writer who came to Yale to talk to
my students, was asked if there was a moment when he consciously decided to
become  a  poet.  Ginsberg  said,  “It  wasn’t  quite  a  choice—it  was  a  realization.  I
was  twenty-eight  and  I  had  a  job  as  a  market  researcher.  One  day  I  told  my
psychiatrist  that  what  I  really  wanted  to  do  was  to  quit  my  job  and  just  write
poetry.  And  the  psychiatrist  said,  ‘Why  not?’  And  I  said,  ‘What  would  the
American Psychoanalytical Association say?’ And he said, ‘There’s no party line.’
So I did.”

We’ll  never  know  how  big  a  loss  that  was  for  the  field  of  market  research.
But  it  was  a  big  moment  for  poetry.  There’s  no  party  line:  good  advice  for
writers. You can be your own party line. Red Smith, delivering the eulogy at the
funeral of a fellow sports-writer, said, “Dying is no big deal. Living is the trick.”
One of the reasons I admired Red Smith was that he wrote about sports for 55
years,  with  grace  and  humor,  without  succumbing  to  the  pressure,  which  was
the  ruin  of  many  sportswriters,  that  he  ought  to  be  writing  about  something
“serious.”  He  found  in  sportswriting  what  he  wanted  to  do  and  what  he  loved
doing,  and  because  it  was  right  for  him  he  said  more  important  things  about
American  values  than  many  writers  who  wrote  about  serious  subjects—so
seriously that nobody could read them.

Living is the trick. Writers who write interestingly tend to be men and women
who  keep  themselves  interested.  That’s  almost  the  whole  point  of  becoming  a
writer.  I’ve  used  writing  to  give  myself  an  interesting  life  and  a  continuing
education. If you write about subjects you think you would enjoy knowing about,
your enjoyment will show in what you write. Learning is a tonic.

That doesn’t mean you won’t be nervous when you go forth into unfamiliar
terrain. As a nonfiction writer you’ll be thrown again and again into specialized
worlds, and you’ll worry that you’re not qualified to bring the story back. I feel
that  anxiety  every  time  I  embark  on  a  new  project.  I  felt  it  when  I  went  to
Bradenton  to  write  my  baseball  book,  Spring  Training.  Although  I’ve  been  a
baseball fan all my life, I had never done any sports reporting, never interviewed
a professional athlete. Strictly, I had no credentials; any of the men I approached
with  my  notebook—managers,  coaches,  players,  umpires,  scouts—could  have

asked, “What else have you written about baseball?” But nobody did. They didn’t
ask because I had another kind of credential: sincerity. It was obvious to those
men that I really wanted to know how they did their work. Remember this when
you  enter  new  territory  and  need  a  shot  of  confidence.  Your  best  credential  is
yourself.

Also  remember  that  your  assignment  may  not  be  as  narrow  as  you  think.
Often  it  will  turn  out  to  touch  some  unexpected  corner  of  your  experience  or
your education, enabling you to broaden the story with strengths of your own.
Every such reduction of the unfamiliar will reduce your fear.

That lesson was brought home to me in 1992 when I got a call from an editor
at Audubon asking if I would write an article for the magazine. I said I wouldn’t.
I’m  a  fourth-generation  New  Yorker,  my  roots  deep  in  the  cement.  “That
wouldn’t be right for me, or for you, or for Audubon,” I told the editor. I’ve never
accepted  an  assignment  I  didn’t  think  I  was  suited  for,  and  I’m  quick  to  tell
editors that they should look for someone else. The Audubon editor replied—as
good editors should—that he was sure we could come up with something, and a
few weeks later he called to say that the magazine had decided it was time for a
new  article  on  Roger  Tory  Peterson,  the  man  who  made  America  a  nation  of
birdwatchers,  his  Field  Guide  to  the  Birds  a  best-seller  since  1934.  Was  I
interested? I said I didn’t know enough about birds. The only one I can identify
for sure is the pigeon, a frequent caller at my Manhattan windowsill.

I  need  to  feel  a  certain  rapport  with  the  person  I’ll  be  writing  about.  The
Peterson assignment wasn’t one that I originated; it came looking for me. Almost
every profile I’ve written has been of someone whose work I knew and had an
affection  for:  such  creative  souls  as  the  cartoonist  Chic  Young  (Blondie),  the
songwriter  Harold  Arlen,  the  British  actor  Peter  Sellers,  the  pianist  Dick  Hyman
and the British travel writer Norman Lewis. My gratitude for the pleasure of their
company over the years was a source of energy when I sat down to write. If you
want your writing to convey enjoyment, write about people you respect. Writing
to  destroy  and  to  scandalize  can  be  as  destructive  to  the  writer  as  it  is  to  the
subject.

Something  came  up,  however,  that  changed  my  mind  about  the  Audubon
offer.  I  happened  to  see  a  PBS  television  documentary  called  A  Celebration  of
Birds,  which  summed  up  Roger  Tory  Peterson’s  life  and  work.  The  film  had  so
much beauty that I wanted to know more about him. What caught my attention
was that Peterson was still going at full momentum at 84—painting four hours a
day and photographing birds in habitats all over the world. That did interest me.
Birds  aren’t  my  subject,  but  survivors  are:  how  old  people  keep  going.  I
remembered that Peterson lived in a Connecticut town not far from where our
family goes in the summer. I could just drive over and meet him; if the vibrations
weren’t right, nothing would be lost except a gallon of gas. I told the Audubon
editor I would try something informal—“a visit with Roger Tory Peterson,” not a
major profile.

Of course it did turn into a major profile, 4,000 words long, because as soon
as I saw Peterson’s studio I realized that to think of him as an ornithologist, as I
always had, was to miss the point of his life. He was above all an artist. It was his
skill as a painter that had made his knowledge of birds accessible to millions and
had given him his authority as a writer, editor and conservationist. I asked him
about  his  early  teachers  and  mentors—major  American  artists  like  John  Sloan
and Edwin Dickinson—and about the influence of the great bird painters James
Audubon  and  Louis  Agassiz  Fuertes,  and  my  story  became  an  art  story  and  a
teaching story as well as a bird story, engaging many of my interests. It was also
a survivor story; in his mid-80s Peterson was on a schedule that would tax a man
of 50.

The  moral  for  nonfiction  writers  is:  think  broadly  about  your  assignment.
Don’t assume that an article for Audubon has to be strictly about nature, or an
article for Car & Driver  strictly  about  cars.  Push  the  boundaries  of  your  subject
and see where it takes you. Bring some part of your own life to it; it’s not your
version of the story until you write it.

As for my version of the Peterson story, not long after it ran in Audubon  my
wife  found  a  message  on  our  home  answering  machine  that  said,  “Is  this  the
William  Zinsser  who  writes  about  nature?”  She  thought  it  was  hilarious,  and  it
was. But in fact my article was received by the birding community as a definitive
portrait of Peterson. I mention this to give confidence to all nonfiction writers: a
point  of  craft.  If  you  master  the  tools  of  the  trade—the  fundamentals  of
interviewing  and  of  orderly  construction—and  if  you  bring  to  the  assignment
your  general  intelligence  and  your  humanity,  you  can  write  about  any  subject.
That’s your ticket to an interesting life.

Still, it’s hard not to be intimidated by the expertise of the expert. You think,
“This man knows so much about his field, I’m too dumb to interview him. He’ll
think I’m stupid.” The reason he knows so much about his field is because it’s his
field;  you’re  a  generalist  trying  to  make  his  work  accessible  to  the  public.  That
means  prodding  him  to  clarify  statements  that  are  so  obvious  to  him  that  he
assumes they are obvious to everyone else. Trust your common sense to figure
out what you need to know, and don’t be afraid to ask a dumb question. If the
expert thinks you’re dumb, that’s his problem.

Your test should be: is the expert’s first answer sufficient? Usually it’s not. I
learned that when I signed up for a second expedition into Peterson territory. An
editor  at  Rizzoli,  the  publisher  of  art  books,  called  to  say  that  the  firm  was
preparing  a  coffee-table  volume  on  “The  Art  and  Photography  of  Roger  Tory
Peterson,” with hundreds of color plates. An 8,000-word text was needed, and as
the new Peterson authority I was asked to write it. Talk about hilarious.

I told the editor that I made it a point never to write the same story twice. I
had written my Audubon article as carefully as I could the first time and wouldn’t
be able to rework it. He would be welcome, however, to acquire and reprint my
article in his book. He agreed to that if I would write an additional 4,000 words—

invisible weaving—that would deal mainly with Peterson’s methods as an artist
and a photographer.

That  sounded  interesting,  and  I  went  back  to  Peterson  with  a  new  set  of
questions,  more  technical  than  the  ones  I  had  put  to  him  for  Audubon.  That
audience  had  wanted  to  hear  about  a  life.  Now  I  was  writing  for  readers  who
wanted to know how the artist created his art, and my questions got right down
to process and technique. We began with painting.

“I call my work ‘mixed media,’” Peterson told me, “because my main purpose
is  to  instruct.  I  may  start  with  transparent  watercolors,  then  I  go  to  gouache,
then  I  give  it  a  protective  coat  of  acrylic,  then  I  go  over  that  with  acrylics  or  a
touch of pastel, or colored pencil, or pencil, or ink—anything that will do what I
want.”

I  knew  from  my  earlier  interview  that  Peterson’s  first  answer  was  seldom
sufficient.  He  was  a  taciturn  man,  the  son  of  Swedish  immigrants,  not  given  to
amplitude.  I  asked  him  how  his  present  technique  differed  from  his  previous
methods.

“Right  now  I’m  straddling,”  he  said.  “I’m  trying  to  add  more  detail  without

losing the simplified effect.” Then he stopped again.

But why did he feel that he needed more detail at this late point in his life?
“Over  the  years  so  many  people  have  become  familiar  with  the  straight
profile of my birds,” he said, “that they’ve begun to want something more: the
look of feathers, or a more three-dimensional feeling.”

After we got through with painting we moved on to photography. Peterson
recalled  every  bird-shooting  camera  he  ever  owned,  starting  at  age  13  with  a
Primo  #9,  which  used  glass  plates  and  had  bellows,  and  ended  with  praise  for
such  modern  technology  as  auto-focus  and  the  fill-in  flash.  Not  being  a
photographer, I had never heard of auto-focus or the fill-in flash, but I only had
to reveal my stupidity to learn why they are so helpful. Auto-focus: “If you can
get  the  bird  in  your  viewfinder  the  camera  will  do  the  rest.”  Fill-in  flash:  “Film
never sees as much as you see. The human eye sees detail in the shadows, but
the fill-in flash enables the camera to pick up that detail.”

Technology,  however,  is  only  technology,  Peterson  reminded  me.  “Many
people  think  good  equipment  makes  it  easy,”  he  said.  “They’re  deceived  into
thinking the camera does it all.” He knew what he meant by that, but I needed to
know why the camera doesn’t do it all. When I pressed him with my “Why not?”
and my “What else?” I got not just one answer but three:

“As  a  photographer,  you  bring  your  eye  and  a  sense  of  composition  to  the
process, and also warmth—you don’t shoot pictures at high noon, for instance,
or at the beginning or the end of the day. You’re also mindful of the quality of
light;  a  thin  overcast  can  do  nice  things.  Knowledge  of  the  animal  is  also  a
tremendous  help:  anticipating  what  a  bird  will  do.  You  can  anticipate  such
activities as a feeding frenzy, when birds feed on fish traveling in small groups.
Feeding  frenzies  are  important  to  a  photographer  because  one  of  the  basic

things birds do is eat, and they’ll put up with you a lot longer if they’re eating. In
fact, they’ll often ignore you.”

So  we  proceeded,  Mr.  Expert  and  Mr.  Stupid,  until  I  had  extracted  many
ideas  that  I  found  interesting.  “I  go  halfway  back  to  Audubon,”  Peterson  said
—that  was  interesting—“so  I  have  a  feeling  for  the  changes  that  have  taken
place  because  of  the  environmental  movement.”  In  his  boyhood,  he  recalled,
every kid with a slingshot would shoot birds, and many species had been killed
off or brought close to extermination by hunters who slaughtered them for their
plumes, or to sell to restaurants, or for sport. The good news, which he had lived
long  enough  to  see,  was  that  many  species  had  made  a  comeback  from  their
narrow escape, helped by a citizenry that now takes an active role in protecting
birds and their habitats. Then he said: “The attitude of people towards birds has
changed the attitude of birds towards people.”

That  was  interesting.  I’m  struck  by  how  often  as  a  writer  I  say  to  myself,
“That’s interesting.” If you find yourself saying it, pay attention and follow your
nose. Trust your curiosity to connect with the curiosity of your readers.
What did Peterson mean about birds changing their attitudes?
“Crows  are  becoming  tamer,”  he  said.  “Gulls  have  increased—they’re  the
cleanup crew at garbage dumps. The Least Tern has taken to nesting on top of
shopping malls; a few years ago there were a thousand pair on the roof of the
Singing  River  Mall  in  Gautier,  Mississippi.  Mockingbirds  are  particularly  fond  of
malls—they like the planting, especially the multiflora rose; its tiny hips are small
enough for them to swallow. They also enjoy the bustle of shopping malls—they
sit there and direct the traffic.”

We had been talking for several hours in Peterson’s studio. The studio was a
small  outpost  of  the  arts  and  sciences—easels,  paints,  paintbrushes,  paintings,
prints,  maps,  cameras,  photographic  equipment,  tribal  masks,  and  shelves  of
reference books and journals—and at the end of my visit, as he was walking me
out,  I  said,  “Have  I  seen  everything?”  Often  you’ll  get  your  best  material  after
you  put  your  pencil  away,  in  the  chitchat  of  leave-taking.  The  person  being
interviewed,  off  the  hook  after  the  hard  work  of  making  his  or  her  life
presentable to a stranger, thinks of a few important afterthoughts.

When I asked whether I had seen everything, Peterson said, “Would you like
to  see  my  collection  of  birds?”  I  said  I  certainly  would.  He  led  me  down  an
outside  staircase  to  a  cellar  door,  which  he  unlocked,  ushering  me  into  a
basement  full  of  cabinets  and  drawers—the  familiar  furniture  of  scientific
storage, reminiscent of every small college museum that never got modernized.
Darwin might have used such drawers.

“I’ve got two thousand specimens down here that I use for research,” he told
me. “Most of them are around a hundred years old, and they’re still useful.” He
pulled  open  a  drawer  and  took  out  a  bird  and  showed  me  the  tag,  which  said
ACORN WOODPECKER, APRIL 10, 1882. “Think of it! This bird is 112 years old,” he said.
He opened some other drawers and gently held several other late Victorians for

me to ponder—a link to the presidency of Grover Cleveland.

The Rizzoli book, with its stunning paintings and photographs, was published
in  1995,  and  Peterson  died  a  year  later,  his  quest  finally  over,  having  sighted
“scarcely more than 4,500” of the world’s 9,000 species of birds. Did I enjoy the
time I spent on the two articles? I can’t really say I did; Peterson was too dour for
that,  not  much  fun.  But  I  enjoyed  having  brought  off  a  complicated  story  that
took me outside my normal experience. I also had bagged a rare bird of my own,
and when I put Peterson away in a drawer with my other collected specimens, I
thought: that was interesting.

22

The Tyranny of the Final Product

In  the  writing  course  that  I’ve  taught  for  many  years  at  the  New  School,  in
Manhattan, students often tell me they have an idea for an article that would be
perfect for New York, or for Sports Illustrated, or for some other magazine. That’s
the  last  thing  I  want  to  hear.  They  can  already  picture  their  story  in  print:  the
headline,  the  layout,  the  photographs  and,  best  of  all,  the  byline.  Now  all  they
have to do is write it.

This fixation on the finished article causes writers a lot of trouble, deflecting
them from all the earlier decisions that have to be made to determine its shape
and voice and content. It’s a very American kind of trouble. We are a culture that
worships  the  winning  result:  the  league  championship,  the  high  test  score.
Coaches are paid to win, teachers are valued for getting students into the best
colleges. Less glamorous gains made along the way—learning, wisdom, growth,
confidence,  dealing  with  failure—aren’t  given  the  same  respect  because  they
can’t be given a grade.

For  writers  the  winning  grade  is  the  check.  The  question  that  professional
authors  get  asked  most  often  at  writing  conferences  is  “How  can  I  sell  my
writing?”  It’s  the  only  question  I  won’t  try  to  answer,  partly  because  I’m  not
qualified—I have no idea what editors in today’s market are looking for; I wish I
did. But mainly it’s because I have no interest in teaching writers how to sell. I
want to teach them how to write. If the process is sound, the product will take
care of itself, and sales are likely to follow.

That’s  the  premise  of  my  course  at  the  New  School.  Founded  in  1919  by
liberal-minded scholars as the New School for Social Research, it has been one of
the  city’s  most  vibrant  centers  of  learning  ever  since.  I  like  to  teach  there
because  I’ve  always  felt  sympathetic  to  its  historic  role:  to  provide  information
that helps motivated adults to get on with their lives. I like arriving by subway for
my  evening  class  and  being  part  of  the  rush  of  men  and  women  entering  the
building and getting out of classes that have just ended.

I chose “People and Places” as the title of my course because together they
are at the heart of expository writing. By concentrating on those two elements I
thought I would be able to teach much of what nonfiction writers need to know:

how to situate what they write in a particular place, and how to get the people
who live in that place to talk about what makes it—or once made it—special.

But I also wanted to conduct an experiment. As an editor and a teacher I’ve
found  that  the  most  untaught  and  underestimated  skill  in  nonfiction  writing  is
how to organize a long article: how to put the jigsaw puzzle together. Writers are
endlessly taught how to write a clear declarative sentence. But ask them to try
something more extensive—an article or a book—and their sentences leach out
all over the floor like marbles. Every editor of a lengthy manuscript knows that
grim moment of irreversible chaos. The writer, his eye on the finish line, never
gave enough thought to how to run the race.

I wondered if there was any way to wrest writers away from their infatuation
with the completed act of writing. Suddenly I had a radical idea: I would teach a
writing course in which no writing is required.

At  our  first  session  my  class  consisted—as  it  has  ever  since—of  two  dozen
adults,  ranging  from  their  twenties  to  their  sixties,  mostly  women.  A  few  were
journalists  with  small  suburban  newspapers  and  television  stations  and  trade
magazines. But mainly they were people with everyday jobs who wanted to learn
how to use writing to make sense of their lives: to find out who they were at that
particular moment, who they once were, and what heritage they were born into.
I devoted the first period to getting us all introduced and explaining some of
the principles of writing about people and places. At the end I said: “Next week I
want you to come here prepared to tell us about one place that’s important to
you  that  you’d  like  to  write  about.  Tell  us  why  you  want  to  write  about  it  and
how  you  want  to  write  about  it.”  I’ve  never  been  a  teacher  who  likes  to  read
student writing aloud unless it’s unusually good; people are too vulnerable about
what they have written. But I guessed that they wouldn’t be self-conscious about
what  they  were  merely  thinking.  Thoughts  haven’t  been  committed  to  sacred
paper;  they  can  always  be  changed  or  rearranged  or  disowned.  Still,  I  didn’t
know what to expect.

The  first  volunteer  the  following  week  was  a  young  woman  who  said  she
wanted  to  write  about  her  church,  on  upper  Fifth  Avenue,  which  had  recently
had  a  bad  fire.  Although  the  church  was  back  in  use,  its  walls  were  blackened
and  its  wood  was  charred  and  it  smelled  of  smoke.  The  woman  found  that
unsettling,  and  she  wanted  to  sort  out  what  the  fire  meant  to  her  as  a
parishioner and to the church. I asked her what she proposed to write. She said
she might interview the minister, or the organist, or the firemen, or maybe the
sexton, or the choirmaster.

“You’ve given us five good pieces by Francis X. Clines,” I told her, referring to
a  New  York  Times  reporter  who  writes  local  features  warmly  and  well.  “But
they’re not good enough for you, or for me, or for this course. I want you to go
deeper.  I  want  you  to  find  some  connection  between  yourself  and  the  place
you’re writing about.”

The woman asked what sort of piece I had in mind. I said I was reluctant to

suggest one because the idea of the course was to think our way collectively to
possible  solutions.  But  since  she  was  our  first  guinea  pig  I  would  give  it  a  try.
“When you go to church in the next few weeks,” I said, “just sit there and think
about the fire. After three or four Sundays the church is going to tell you what
that fire means.” Then I said: “God is going to tell that church to tell you what
the fire means.”

There  was  a  small  gasp  in  the  classroom;  Americans  get  squeamish  at  any
mention  of  religion.  But  the  students  saw  that  I  was  serious,  and  from  that
moment they took my idea seriously. Every week they invited the rest of us into
their  lives,  telling  us  about  some  place  that  touched  their  interests  or  their
emotions and trying to decide how to write about it. I would spend the first half
of each class teaching the craft and reading passages by nonfiction writers who
had solved issues the students were struggling with. The other half was our lab: a
dissecting table of writers’ organizational problems.

By  far  the  biggest  problem  was  compression:  how  to  distill  a  coherent
narrative  from  a  huge  and  tangled  mass  of  experiences  and  feelings  and
memories. “I want to write an article about the disappearance of small towns in
Iowa,” one woman told us, describing how the fabric of life in the Midwest had
frayed  since  she  was  a  girl  on  her  grandparents’  farm.  It  was  a  good  American
subject,  valuable  as  social  history.  But  nobody  can  write  a  decent  article  about
the disappearance of small towns in Iowa; it would be all generalization and no
humanity.  The  writer  would  have  to  write  about  one  small  town  in  Iowa  and
thereby tell her larger story, and even within that one town she would have to
reduce  her  story  still  further:  to  one  store,  or  one  family,  or  one  farmer.  We
talked  about  different  approaches,  and  the  writer  gradually  thought  her  story
down to human scale.

I was struck by how often my students’ gropings led to a sudden revelation of
the  proper  path,  obvious  to  everyone  in  the  room.  A  man  would  say  that  he
wanted to try a piece about the town where he once lived and would venture a
possible approach: “I could write about X.” X, however, was uninteresting, even
to him, lacking any distinctiveness, and so were Y and Z, and so were P and Q and
R,  the  writer  continuing  to  dredge  up  fragments  of  his  life,  when,  almost
accidentally,  he  stumbled
long-forgotten  memory,  seemingly
unimportant but unassailably true, encapsulating in one incident everything that
had  made  him  want  to  write  about  the  town  in  the  first  place.  “There’s  your
story,” several people in the class would say, and it was. The student had been
given time to find it.

into  M,  a

That release from immediacy was what I wanted to get into the metabolism
of my students. I told them that if they actually wrote their piece I would be glad
to  read  it,  even  if  they  sent  it  to  me  after  the  course  was  over,  but  that  that
wasn’t  my  primary  interest.  I  was  primarily  interested  in  the  process,  not  the
product.  At  first  that  made  them  uneasy.  This  was  America—they  not  only
wanted validation; it was their national right. Quite a few came to me privately,

almost furtively, as if letting me in on some shabby secret, and said, “You know,
this  is  the  only  writing  course  I’ve  ever  taken  that  isn’t  market-driven.”  It’s  a
depressing sentence. But after a while they found it liberating to be freed from a
deadline,  the  monster  of  all  their  school  and  college  and  postgraduate  years
(“the paper is due on Friday”), insatiably demanding to be fed. They relaxed and
enjoyed considering different ways of getting where they wanted to go. Some of
those ways would work and some wouldn’t. The right to fail was liberating.

Occasionally  I’ve  described  this  course  to  elementary  and  high  school
teachers at a workshop. I didn’t particularly expect them to find it pertinent to
their age group—adolescents with fewer memories and attachments than adults
have. But they always pressed me for more details. When I asked why they were
so interested they said, “You’ve given us a new timetable.” By which they meant
that  the  traditional  assigning  of  short-term  papers  may  be  a  tradition  that
teachers  have  followed  too  unquestioningly  for  too  long.  They  began  to  muse
about writing assignments that would give their pupils more room and would be
judged by different expectations.

The  methodology  of  my  course—thinking  of  a  particular  place—is  only  a
pedagogical  device.  My  real  purpose  was  to  give  writers  a  new  mentality,  one
they could apply to whatever writing projects they might try thereafter, allowing
as much time as they need for the journey. For one of my students, a lawyer in
his late 30s, the journey took three years. One day in 1996 he called me to say
that  he  had  finally  wrestled  into  submission  the  subject  whose  organizational
problems he had presented to our class in 1993. Would I look at it?

What arrived was a 350-page manuscript. I’ll admit that one part of me didn’t
want  to  receive  a  350-page  manuscript.  But  a  larger  part  of  me  was  delighted
that  the  process  I  had  set  in  motion  had  worked  its  way  to  a  conclusion.  I  was
also  curious  to  see  how  the  lawyer  had  solved  his  problems,  because  I
remembered them well.

The  place  he  wanted  to  write  about,  he  told  us,  was  the  town  in  suburban
Connecticut where he grew up, and his theme was soccer. Playing on the school
team as a boy, he had formed close friendships with five other boys who loved
the  sport  as  much  as  he  did,  and  he  wanted  to  write  about  that  bonding
experience  and  his  gratitude  to  soccer  for  providing  it.  I  said  that  was  a  good
writer’s subject: a memoir.

So strong was the bond, the lawyer went on to say, that the six men were still
bonded  as  midlife  professionals  in  the  northeast—they  continued  to  see  each
other  regularly—and  he  also  wanted  to  write  about  that  experience  and  about
his  gratitude  for  such  lasting  friendships.  I  said  that  was  also  a  good  subject:  a
personal essay.

But  there  was  more.  The  lawyer  also  wanted  to  write  about  the  state  of
soccer  today.  The  texture  of  the  sport  he  remembered  had  been  eroded  by
social  change.  Among  other  losses,  he  said,  players  no  longer  change  in  the
locker room; they get into their uniform at home and drive to the field and then

drive home again. The lawyer’s idea was to volunteer as a soccer coach at his old
school and to write about the contrast between the present and the past. That
was still another good subject: investigative reporting.

I  enjoyed  hearing  the  lawyer’s  story.  I  was  being  taken  into  a  world  I  knew
nothing  about,  and  his  affection  for  that  world  was  appealing.  But  I  also  knew
that  he  was  about  to  drive  himself  crazy,  and  I  told  him  so.  He  couldn’t  fit  all
those stories under one small roof; he would have to choose one story that had
its own unity. As it turned out, he did fit all those stories under one roof, but the
house had to be greatly enlarged and the job took three years.

After I had read his manuscript, which was called The Autumn of Our Lives, he
asked me if it was good enough to submit to a publisher. Not yet, I told him; it
was still one rewrite away. Maybe he just didn’t want to make that kind of effort.
He gave it some thought and said that, having traveled this far, he would give it
one more shot.

“But even if it never gets published,” he said, “I’m glad I did it. I can’t begin to
tell you how important this has been to me—how rewarding it’s been to write
about what soccer has meant in my life.”

Two final words occur to me. One is quest, the other is intention.
The quest is one of the oldest themes in storytelling, an act of faith we never
get tired of hearing about. Looking back, I notice that many students in my class,
assigned to think about a place that was important to them, used the assignment
to go on a quest for something deeper than the place itself: a meaning, an idea,
some sliver of the past. The result was that the class always had a warm dynamic
for a group of strangers. (Some classes even held reunions.) Every quest that a
student  embarked  on  found  an  echo  in  some  search  or  yearning  of  our  own.
Moral: any time you can tell a story in the form of a quest or a pilgrimage you’ll
be  ahead  of  the  game.  Readers  bearing  their  own  associations  will  do  some  of
your work for you.

Intention is what we wish to accomplish with our writing. Call it the writer’s
soul. We can write to affirm and to celebrate, or we can write to debunk and to
destroy;  the  choice  is  ours.  Destruction  has  long  been  a  journalistic  mode,
rewarding  the  snoop  and  the  hatchet  man  (or  woman)  and  the  invader  of
privacy. But nobody can make us write what we don’t want to write. We get to
keep  intention.  Nonfiction  writers  often  forget  that  they  are  not  required  to
acquiesce in tawdry work, to carry the trash for magazine editors who have an
agenda of their own—to sell a commercial product.

Writing is related to character. If your values are sound, your writing will be
sound. It all begins with intention. Figure out what you want to do and how you
want to do it, and work your way with humanity and integrity to the completed
article. Then you’ll have something to sell.

23

A Writer’s Decisions

This has been a book about decisions—the countless successive decisions that go
into  every  act  of  writing.  Some  of  the  decisions  are  big  (“What  should  I  write
about?”)  and  some  are  as  small  as  the  smallest  word.  But  all  of  them  are
important.

The  previous  chapter  was  about  big  decisions:  matters  of  shape,  structure,
compression,  focus  and  intention.  This  chapter  is  about  little  decisions:  the
hundreds of choices that go into organizing a long article. I thought it might be
helpful  to  show  how  some  of  those  decisions  get  made,  using  one  of  my  own
pieces as the specimen being dissected.

Learning how to organize a long article is just as important as learning how to
write a clear and pleasing sentence. All your clear and pleasing sentences will fall
apart  if  you  don’t  keep  remembering  that  writing  is  linear  and  sequential,  that
logic is the glue that holds it together, that tension must be maintained from one
sentence to the next and from one paragraph to the next and from one section
to the next, and that narrative—good old-fashioned storytelling—is what should
pull your readers along without their noticing the tug. The only thing they should
notice is that you have made a sensible plan for your journey. Every step should
seem inevitable.

My  article,  called  “The  News  From  Timbuktu,”  which  ran  in  Condé  Nast
Traveler,  is  one  writer’s  solution  to  one  problem,  but  it  illustrates  issues  that
apply to all extended tasks of nonfiction. I’ve annotated the piece, explaining the
decisions I made along the way.

The hardest decision about any article is how to begin it. The lead must grab
the  reader  with  a  provocative  idea  and  continue  with  each  paragraph  to  hold
him  or  her  in  a  tight  grip,  gradually  adding  information.  The  point  of  the
information  is  to  get  readers  so  interested  that  they  will  stick  around  for  the
whole trip. The lead can be as short as one paragraph and as long as it needs to
be. You’ll know it’s over when all the necessary work has been done and you can
take  a  more  relaxed  tone  and  get  on  with  your  narrative.  Here  the  first
paragraph gives readers an arresting notion to think about—one that I hope has
never occurred to them before.

What  struck  me  most  powerfully  when  I  got  to  Timbuktu  was  that  the
streets were of sand. I suddenly realized that sand is very different from dirt.
Every  town  starts  with  dirt  streets  that  eventually  get  paved  as  the
inhabitants  prosper  and  subdue  their  environment.  But  sand  represents
defeat. A city with streets of sand is a city at the edge.

Notice how simple those five sentences are: plain declarative sentences, not
a comma in sight. Each sentence contains one thought—and only one. Readers
can process only one idea at a time, and they do it in linear sequence. Much of
the trouble that writers get into comes from trying to make one sentence do too
much  work.  Never  be  afraid  to  break  a  long  sentence  into  two  short  ones,  or
even three.

That, of course, is why I was there: Timbuktu is the ultimate destination
for  edge-seekers.  Of  the  half-dozen  places  that  have  always  lured  travelers
with  the  mere  sound  of  their  name—Bali  and  Tahiti,  Samarkand  and  Fez,
Mombasa  and  Macao—none  can  match  Timbuktu  for  the  remoteness  it
conveys. I was surprised by how many people, hearing of my trip, didn’t think
Timbuktu was a real place, or, if it was, couldn’t think where in the world it
might be. They knew it well as a word—the most vivid of all synonyms for the
almost-unreachable, a God-given toy for songwriters stuck for an “oo” rhyme
and a metaphor for how far a lovestruck boy would go to win the unwinnable
girl.  But  as  an  actual  place—surely  Timbuktu  was  one  of  those  “long-lost”
African  kingdoms  like  King  Solomon’s  Mines  that  turned  out  not  to  exist
when the Victorian explorers went looking for them.

The  first  sentence  of  that  paragraph  grows  out  of  the  last  sentence  of  the
previous paragraph; the reader is given no chance to squirm away. After that the
paragraph has one purpose: it acknowledges what the reader already knows—or
half  knows—about  Timbuktu.  It  thereby  welcomes  him  as  a  fellow  traveler,
someone who brings the same emotions to the trip as the writer himself. It also
adds a certain kind of information—not hard facts, but enjoyable lore.

The following paragraph gets down to hard work—work that can’t be put off
any  longer.  Notice  how  much  information  is  crammed  into  these  three
sentences:

The long-lost Timbuktu, however, got found, though the men who finally
found it after terrible ordeals—the Scotsman Gordon Laing in 1826 and the
Frenchman  René  Caillié  in  1828—must  have  felt  cruelly  mocked  for  their
efforts. The legendary city of 100,000 people described by the 16th-century
traveler  Leo  Africanus—a  center  of  learning  with  20,000  students  and  180
Koranic schools—was a desolate settlement of mud buildings, its glory and its
population  long  gone,  surviving  only  because  of  its  unique  location  as  the

junction of important camel caravan routes across the Sahara. Much of what
got traded in Africa, especially salt from the north and gold from the south,
got traded in Timbuktu.

So much for the history of Timbuktu and the reason for its fame. It’s all that a
magazine reader needs to know about the city’s past and its significance. Don’t
give  readers  of  a  magazine  piece  more  information  than  they  require;  if  you
want to tell more, write a book or write for a scholarly journal.

Now,  what  do  your  readers  want  to  know  next?  Ask  yourself  that  question
after every sentence. Here what they want to know is: why did I go to Timbuktu?
What  was  the  purpose  of  my  trip?  The  following  paragraph  gets  right  to  it—
again, keeping the thread of the previous sentence taut:

It  was  to  watch  the  arrival  of  one  of  those  caravans  that  I  had  come  to
Timbuktu. I was one of six men and women bright enough or dumb enough—
we  didn’t  yet  know  which—to  sign  up  for  a  two-week  tour  we  had  seen
announced  in  the  Sunday  New  York  Times,  run  by  a  small  travel  agency  of
French origins that specializes in West Africa. (Timbuktu is in Mali, the former
French Sudan.) The agency’s office is in New York, and I had gone there first
thing  Monday  morning  to  beat  the  crowd;  I  asked  the  usual  questions  and
got the usual answers—yellow fever shots, cholera shots, malaria pills, don’t
drink the water—and was given a brochure.

Besides explaining the genesis of the trip, that paragraph does one other job:
it  establishes  the  writer’s  personality  and  voice.  In  travel  writing  you  should
never forget that you are the guide. It’s not enough just to take your readers on
a trip; you must take them on your trip. Make them identify with you—with your
hopes  and  apprehensions.  This  means  giving  them  some  idea  of  who  you  are.
The phrase “bright enough or dumb enough” calls up a familiar figure in travel
literature: the tourist as a possible patsy or buffoon. Another throwaway phrase
is the line about beating the crowd. I put it in just to amuse myself. Strictly, that
fourth paragraph is too late to say where Timbuktu is. But I couldn’t find a way to
mention it earlier without pulling apart the fabric of the lead.

Here’s paragraph five:

“It’s your opportunity to participate in a once-in-a-lifetime extravaganza
—the annual Azalai Salt Caravan to Timbuktu!” the brochure began. “Picture
this: Hundreds of camels carrying huge slabs of precious salt (‘white gold’ to
the  natives  of  land-locked  West  Africa)  make  their  triumphant  entry  into
Timbuktu,  an  ancient  and  mystical  part  desert/part  city  of  some  7,000
inhabitants. The colorful nomads who drive the caravans have traveled 1,000
miles across the Sahara to celebrate the end of their trek with outdoor feasts
and traditional tribal dances. Spend the night in a desert tent as guest of the

tribal chief.”

That’s a typical example of how a writer can get other people to do helpful
work for him—in their words, which are usually more revealing than the writer’s
words. In this case the brochure not only tells the reader what kind of trip has
been  promised;  its  language  is  an  amusement  in  itself  and  a  window  into  the
grandiosity  of  the  promoters.  Be  on  the  watch  for  funny  or  self-serving  quotes
and use them with gratitude. Here’s the last paragraph of the lead:

Well, that’s my kind of trip, if not necessarily my kind of prose, and it also
turned out to be my wife’s kind of trip and four other people’s kind of trip. In
years we ranged from late middle age to Medicare. Five of us were from mid-
Manhattan,  one  was  a  widow  from  Maryland,  and  all  of  us  had  made  a
lifelong  habit  of  traveling  to  places  on  the  edge.  Names  like  Venice  and
Versailles didn’t bob up in our accounts of earlier trips, or even Marrakech or
Luxor  or  Chiang  Mai.  The  talk  was  of  Bhutan  and  Borneo,  Tibet  and  Yemen
and  the  Moluccas.  Now—praise  Allah!—we  had  made  it  to  Timbuktu.  Our
camel caravan was about to come in.

That  concludes  the  lead.  Those  six  paragraphs  took  as  long  to  write  as  the
entire remainder of the piece. But when I finally wrestled them into place I felt
confidently  launched.  Maybe  someone  else  could  write  a  better  lead  for  that
story, but I couldn’t. I felt that readers who were still with me would stay to the
end.

No  less  important  than  decisions  about  structure  are  decisions  about
individual words. Banality is the enemy of good writing; the challenge is to not
write like everybody else. One fact that had to be stated in the lead was how old
the  six  of  us  were.  Initially  I  wrote  something  serviceable  like  “we  were  in  our
fifties  and  sixties.”  But  the  merely  serviceable  is  a  drag.  Was  there  any  way  to
state the fact with freshness? There didn’t seem to be. At last a merciful muse
gave me Medicare—and thus the phrase “from late middle age to Medicare.” If
you look long enough you can usually find a proper name or a metaphor that will
bring those dull but necessary facts to life.

Even  more  time  went  into  the  sentence  about  Venice  and  Versailles.
Originally I wrote, “Names like London and Paris didn’t turn up in our accounts of
earlier trips.” Not much fun there. I tried to think of other popular capitals. Rome
and  Cairo?  Athens  and  Bangkok?  No  better.  Maybe  alliteration  would  help—
readers  enjoy  any  effort  to  gratify  their  sense  of  rhythm  and  cadence.  Madrid
and Moscow? Tel Aviv and Tokyo? Too tricky. I stopped thinking of capitals and
tried  to  think  of  tourist-infested  cities.  Venice  popped  into  my  head  and  I  was
glad to see it; everybody goes to Venice. Did any other cities begin with V? Only
Vienna,  which  was  too  close  to  Venice  in  several  respects.  Finally  I  shifted  my
thinking from tourist cities to tourist sites, mentally fanning out from the major

capitals, and it was on one of those excursions that I hit Versailles. It made my
day.

Next  I  needed  a  fresher  verb  than  “turn  up.”  I  wanted  an  active  verb  that
conveyed  an  image.  None  of  the  usual  synonyms  was  quite  right.  Finally  I
thought of “bob”—a three-letter word, ludicrously simple. Yet it was the perfect
word:  it  paints  a  picture  of  an  object  periodically  rising  to  the  surface  of  the
water. That left just one decision: what slightly offbeat tourist sites would seem
commonplace to six travelers who had signed up for Timbuktu? The three that I
finally  chose—Luxor,  Marrakech  and  Chiang  Mai—were  quite  exotic  in  the
1950s, when I first visited them. Today they’re not; the age of jet travel has made
them almost as popular as London and Paris.

Altogether, the sentence took almost an hour. But I didn’t begrudge a minute
of it. On the contrary, seeing it fall into place gave me great pleasure. No writing
decision is too small to be worth a large expenditure of time. Both you and the
reader  know  it  when  your  finicky  labor  is  rewarded  by  a  sentence  coming  out
right.

Notice that there’s an asterisk at the end of the lead. (It could also be a blank
space.)  That  asterisk  is  a  signpost.  It  announces  to  the  reader  that  you  have
organized your article in a certain way and that a new phase is about to begin—
perhaps a change of chronology, such as a flashback, or a change of subject, or
emphasis, or tone. Here, after a highly compressed lead, the asterisk enables the
writer to take a deep breath and start over, this time at the more leisurely gait of
a storyteller:

We  got  to  Timbuktu  by  flying  from  New  York  to  Abidjan,  capital  of  the
Ivory  Coast,  and  taking  a  plane  from  there  to  Bamako,  capital  of  Mali,  its
neighbor  to  the  north.  Unlike  the  verdant  Ivory  Coast,  Mali  is  dry,  its
southern half nourished mainly by the Niger River, its upper half pure desert;
Timbuktu is literally the last stop for travelers going north across the Sahara,
or the first stop for travelers coming south—a coveted speck on the horizon
after weeks of heat and thirst.

None of us on the tour knew much about Mali or what to expect of it—
our  thoughts  were  fixed  on  our  rendezvous  with  the  salt  caravan  at
Timbuktu, not on the country we would cross to get there. What we didn’t
expect  was  that  we  would  be  so  instantly  taken  with  it.  Mali  was  an
immersion in color: handsome people wearing fabrics of intoxicating design,
markets bright with fruits and vegetables, children whose smile was a routine
miracle.  Desperately  poor,  Mali  was  people-rich.  The  tree-lined  city  of
Bamako delighted us with its energy and confidence.

Up early the next morning, we drove for ten hours in a van that had seen
better  days,  but  not  much  better  days,  to  reach  the  holy  city  of  Djenné,  a
medieval center of trade and Islamic scholarship on the Niger that predated
Timbuktu  and  rivaled  it  in  luster.  Today  Djenné  can  only  be  reached  by  a

small  ferry,  and  as  we  bounced  over  unspeakable  roads,  hurrying  to  arrive
before  dark,  the  spires  and  turrets  of  its  great  clay  mosque,  looking  like  a
distant  sandcastle,  taunted  us  by  seeming  to  recede.  When  we  finally  got
there  the  mosque  still  looked  like  a  sandcastle—an  elegant  fortress  that
might have been built by children on a beach. Architecturally (I later learned)
it was in the Sudanese style; all these years, children on beaches have been
building  in  the  Sudanese  style.  To  linger  in  Djenné’s  ancient  square  at  dusk
was a high moment of our trip.

The  next  two  days  were  no  less  rich.  One  was  spent  driving  into—and
back  out  of—Dogon  country.  The  Dogon,  who  live  on  an  escarpment  not
easily  reached  by  outsiders,  are  prized  by  anthropologists  for  their  animist
culture and cosmology and by art collectors for their masks and statues, and
the  few  hours  that  we  spent  climbing  around  their  villages  and  watching  a
masked  dance  gave  us  too  brief  a  glimpse  of  a  society  that  was  far  from
simple.  The  second  day  was  spent  in  Mopte,  a  vibrant  market  town  on  the
Niger that we liked enormously and also left too soon. But we had a date in
Timbuktu and a chartered plane to take us there.

Obviously there’s far more to say about Mali than is jammed into those four
paragraphs—many scholarly books have been written about the Dogon culture
and the Niger River peoples. But this wasn’t an article about Mali; it was about a
quest for a camel caravan. Therefore a decision had to be made about the larger
shape  of  the  piece.  My  decision  was  to  get  across  Mali  as  fast  as  possible—to
explain  in  the  barest  number  of  sentences  what  route  we  took  and  what  was
important about the places where we stopped.

At such moments I ask myself one very helpful question: “What is the piece
really about?” (Not just “What is the piece about?”) Fondness for material you’ve
gone to a lot of trouble to gather isn’t a good enough reason to include it if it’s
not  central  to  the  story  you’ve  chosen  to  tell.  Self-discipline  bordering  on
masochism is required. The only consolation for the loss of so much material is
that it isn’t totally lost; it remains in your writing as an intangible that the reader
can  sense.  Readers  should  always  feel  that  you  know  more  about  your  subject
than you’ve put in writing.

Back to “But we had a date in Timbuktu”:

The exactness of that date was what had worried me most when I visited
the travel agency. I asked the head of the agency how she could be so sure
the salt caravan would arrive on December 2; nomads leading camels aren’t
my idea of people operating on a timetable. My wife, who isn’t cursed with
my optimism about such life forces as camels and travel agents, was certain
we would be told at Timbuktu that the salt caravan had come and gone, or,
more probably, hadn’t been heard from at all. The travel agent scoffed at my
question.

“We’re in close touch with the caravan,” she said. “We send scouts into
the desert. If they tell us the caravan is going to be a few days late we can
juggle  your  itinerary  in  Mali.”  That  made  sense  to  me—optimists  can  make
sense  of  anything—and  now  I  was  in  a  plane  not  much  bigger  than
Lindbergh’s, flying north toward Timbuktu over terrain so barren that I saw
no  sign  of  human  habitation  below.  Simultaneously,  however,  hundreds  of
camels carrying huge slabs of salt were moving south to meet me. Even now
tribal  chiefs  were  turning  their  thoughts  to  how  to  entertain  me  in  their
desert tent.

Both  of  the  preceding  paragraphs  contain  touches  of  humor—tiny  jokes.
Again,  they  are  efforts  to  keep  myself  amused.  But  they  are  also  a  deliberate
attempt  to  maintain  a  persona.  One  of  the  oldest  strains  in  travel  writing  and
humor  writing  is  the  eternal  credulity  of  the  narrator.  Used  in  moderation,
making  yourself  gullible—or  downright  stupid—gives  the  reader  the  enormous
pleasure of feeling superior.

Our  pilot  circled  over  Timbuktu  to  give  us  an  aerial  view  of  the  city  we
had traveled so far to see. It was a large sprawl of mud buildings that looked
long abandoned, as dead as Fort Zinderneuf at the end of Beau Geste; surely
nobody was alive down there. The Sahara in its steady encroachment, which
has  created  the  drought  belt  across  central  Africa  known  as  the  Sahel,  had
long since pushed past Timbuktu and left it marooned. I felt a tremor of fear;
I didn’t want to be put down in such a forsaken place.

The reference to Beau Geste is an effort to tap into associations that readers
bring  to  the  story.  Much  of  what  makes  Timbuktu  legendary  was  put  there  by
Hollywood.  By  invoking  the  fate  of  Fort  Zinderneuf—Brian  Donlevy  played  a
sadistic French Foreign Legion commandant who propped the dead bodies of his
soldiers back into the niches of the fort—I’m revealing my own fondness for the
genre and striking a bond with fellow movie buffs. What I’m after is resonance; it
can do a great deal of emotional work that writers can’t achieve on their own.

Two  words—“tremor”  and  “forsaken”—took  a  while  to  find.  When  I  found
“forsaken” in my Roget’s Thesaurus I was quite sure I had never used it before. I
was  glad  to  see  it  there  among  the  synonyms.  As  one  of  Jesus’s  last  words
(speaking  of  resonance),
loneliness  and
abandonment.

it  could  hardly  convey  more

At  the  airport  we  were  met  by  our  local  guide,  a  Tuareg  named
Mohammed Ali. For a travel buff he was a consoling sight—if anybody can be
said to own this part of the Sahara, it is the Tuareg, a race of proud Berbers
who  wouldn’t  submit  to  the  Arabs  or  the  later  French  colonials  who  swept
into  North  Africa,  withdrawing  instead  into  the  desert  and  making  it  their

preserve.  Mohammed  Ali,  who  was  wearing  the  traditional  blue  robe  of
Tuareg men, had a dark, intelligent face, somewhat Arabic in the angularity
of its features, and he moved with an assurance that was obviously part of
his character. As a teen-ager, it turned out, he had gone with his father on
the  haj  to  Mecca  (many  Tuareg  eventually  converted  to  Islam)  and  had
stayed  for  seven  years  in  Arabia  and  Egypt  to  study  English,  French  and
Arabic.  The  Tuareg  have  a  language  of  their  own,  with  a  complex  written
alphabet, called Tamashek.

Mohammed  Ali  said  he  had  to  take  us  first  to  the  police  station  in
Timbuktu to have our passports checked. I’ve seen too many movies to feel
comfortable in this kind of interview situation, and as we sat in a dungeon-
like room being interrogated by two armed policemen, not far from a jail cell
where we could see a man and a boy sleeping, I had another flashback—this
one  to  The  Four  Feathers  and  the  scene  of  the  British  soldiers  long
imprisoned at Omdurman. The oppressiveness stayed with me when we got
back  out  and  Mohammed  Ali  walked  us  through  the  forlorn  city,  dutifully
showing us its few “points of interest”: the Grand Mosque, the market, and
three  dilapidated  houses,  commemorated  by  plaques,  where  Laing,  Caillié
and  the  German  explorer  Heinrich  Barth  lived.  We  didn’t  see  any  other
tourists.

Again, the Four Feathers allusion, like the mention of Beau Geste, will bring a
chill of recognition to anyone who knows the movie. The fact that the movie was
based  on  a  real  campaign—Kitchener’s  expedition  up  the  Nile  to  avenge  the
Mahdi’s  defeat  of  General  Gordon—gives  the  sentence  an  edge  of  fear.
Obviously Arab justice in outposts of the Sahara is still far from merciful.

Once more the asterisk announces a change of mood. It says, in effect: “So
much for Timbuktu itself. Now we’re going to get down to the real business of
the  story:  looking  for  a  camel  caravan.”  Making  these  divisions  in  a  long  and
complex article not only helps the reader to follow your road map. It also takes
some of the anxiety out of the act of writing, enabling you to break your material
into manageable chunks and to take one chunk at a time. The total task seems
less formidable, and panic is staved off.

At the Azalai Hotel, where we appeared to be the only guests, we asked
Mohammed  Ali  how  many  tourists  were  in  Timbuktu  to  greet  the  salt
caravan.

“Six,” he said. “The six of you.”
“But  …”  Something  in  me  didn’t  want  to  finish  the  sentence.  I  took  a
different approach. “I don’t understand what this word ‘Azalai’ means. Why
is it called the Azalai Salt Caravan?”

“That’s  the  word  the  French  used,”  he  said,  “when  they  organized  the
caravan  and  all  the  camels  made  the  trip  together  once  a  year,  around  the

beginning of December.”

“What do they do now?” several voices asked.
“Well,  when  Mali  got  its  independence  they  decided  to  let  the  traders

bring their salt caravans to Timbuktu whenever they wanted to.”

Mali  got  its  independence  in  1960.  We  were  in  Timbuktu  for  an  event

that hadn’t been held in 27 years.

The last sentence is a small bomb dropped into the story. But it is allowed to
speak  for  itself—just  the  facts,  please—without  comment.  I  didn’t  add  an
exclamation point to notify readers that it was an amazing moment. That would
have spoiled their own pleasure of discovery. Trust your material.

My wife, among others, was not surprised. We took the news calmly: old
travel hands who have faith that they will find their camel caravan one way
or  another.  Mainly  our  reaction  was  one  of  amazement  that  the  canons  of
truth-in-advertising had been so brazenly disregarded. Mohammed Ali knew
nothing about the gaudy promises tendered by the brochure. He only knew
he had been hired to take us to meet a salt caravan, and he told us that in
the morning we would go looking for one and would spend the night in the
Sahara.  Early  December,  he  said,  was  the  usual  time  for  caravans  to  start
arriving. He didn’t say anything about a chieftain’s tent.

More  carefully  chosen  words:  “canons,”  “brazenly,”  “gaudy,”  “tendered.”
They’re vivid and precise, but not long or fancy. Best of all, they are words that
readers  probably  weren’t  expecting  and  that  they  therefore  welcome.  The
sentence about the chieftain’s tent, referring back to a phrase in the brochure, is
another  tiny  joke.  These  “snappers”  at  the  end  of  a  paragraph  propel  readers
into the next paragraph and keep them in a good mood.

In  the  morning  my  wife—a  voice  of  reason  at  the  edge  of  infinity—said
she  wouldn’t  go  into  the  Sahara  unless  we  went  in  two  vehicles.  I  was
therefore glad to see two Land Rovers awaiting us outside the hotel. One of
them was having its front tire pumped up by a boy with a bicycle pump. Four
of us squeezed into the back seat of one Land Rover; Mohammed Ali sat in
front,  next  to  the  driver.  The  second  Land  Rover  took  our  other  two  tour
members and two boys who  were described as “apprentices.” Nobody said
what they were apprenticing for.

Another startling fact that needs no embellishment—the tire-pumping—and

another small joke at the end.

We drove straight out into the Sahara. The desert was a brown blanket

without  any  end  and  with  no  tracks  of  any  kind;  the  next  big  town  was
Algiers.  That  was  the  moment  when  I  felt  most  at  the  edge,  when  a  small
voice said, “This is crazy. Why are you doing this?” But I knew why; I was on a
quest  that  I  could  trace  back  to  my  first  encounters  with  the  books  by
Britain’s “desert eccentrics”—solitaries such as Charles Doughty, Sir Richard
Burton, T. E. Lawrence and Wilfred Thesiger, who lived among the Bedouin. I
had  always  wondered  what  that  austere  existence  was  like.  What  was  its
hold over those obsessed Englishmen?

More resonance. The reference to Doughty and his compatriots is a reminder
that the desert has a written literature no less powerful than its movie literature.
It adds one more item to the emotional baggage that I was carrying and that the
reader was entitled to know about.

The  following  sentence  pursues  the  question  that  ended  the  previous

paragraph:

Now I was starting to find out. As we drove over the sand, Mohammed Ali
gave the driver an occasional gesture: a little more to the right, a little more
to the left. We asked how he knew where he was going. He said he could tell
by the dunes. The dunes, however, all looked alike. We asked how long we
would have to drive to find a salt caravan. Mohammed Ali said he hoped it
wouldn’t be more than three or four hours. We kept driving. To my object-
oriented eye there was almost nothing to see. But after a while the almost-
nothingness became an object in itself—the entire point of the desert. I tried
to  get  that  fact  into  my  metabolism.  It  lulled  me  into  a  certain  acceptance
and I totally forgot why we were out there.

Suddenly the driver made a sharp left and came to a stop. “Camels,” he
said.  I  strained  my  urban  eyes  and  didn’t  see  anything.  Then  it  came  into
focus,  far  away:  a  caravan  of  forty  camels  moving  at  a  stately  gait  toward
Timbuktu,  as  camel  caravans  have  for  a  thousand  years,  bringing  salt  from
the  mines  at  Taoudenni,  twenty  days  to  the  north.  We  drove  to  within  a
hundred  yards  of  the  caravan—no  nearer,  Mohammed  Ali  explained,
because camels are nervous creatures, easily panicked by anything “strange.”
(We  were  undeniably  strange.)  He  said  that  the  camels  are  always  brought
into  Timbuktu  to  unload  the  salt  late  at  night,  when  the  city  is  empty  of
people. So much for the “triumphant entry.”

It was a thrilling sight, far more dramatic than an organized march would
have been. The aloneness of the caravan was the aloneness of every caravan
that had ever crossed the Sahara. The camels were hitched to each other and
seemed to be walking in unison, as precise as Rockettes in their undulating
rhythm. Each camel had two slabs of salt roped to each side. The salt looked
like  dirty  white  marble.  The  slabs  (which  I  subsequently  measured  in  the
Timbuktu  market)  are  3½  feet  long,  1½  feet  high,  and  ¾  inch  thick—the

maximum size and weight, presumably, that can be loaded onto a camel. We
sat  on  the  sand  and  watched  the  caravan  until  the  last  camel  disappeared
over a dune.

The  tone  has  now  settled  into  straight  narrative—one  declarative  sentence
after another. The only hard decision involved “aloneness,” which is not my kind
of  word—it’s  too  “poetic.”  But  I  finally  decided  that  there  was  no  other  word
that could do the same job, and I reluctantly stayed with it.

By now it was midday and the sun was fiercely hot. We climbed back into
our Land Rovers and drove farther into the desert until Mohammed Ali found
a tree that cast a shadow just big enough for five New Yorkers and a widow
from  Maryland,  and  there  we  stayed  until  about  4,  having  a  picnic  lunch,
gazing  at  the  bleached-out
landscape,  dozing,  moving  our  blanket
periodically  as  our  shadow  moved  with  the  sun.  The  two  drivers  spent  the
entire  siesta  tinkering  with  and  seeming  to  dismantle  the  engine  of  one  of
the Land Rovers. A nomad appeared from nowhere and stopped to ask if we
had  any  quinine.  Another  nomad  appeared  from  nowhere  and  stopped
briefly  to  talk.  Later  we  saw  two  men  walking  toward  us  across  the  desert
and beyond them … was it our first mirage? It was another salt caravan, this
one  fifty  camels  long,  silhouetted  against  the  sky.  Spotting  us  from  God
knows how far away, the two men had left the caravan to come over for a
visit.  One  of  them  was  an  old  man,  full  of  laughter.  They  sat  down  with
Mohammed Ali and got the latest news of Timbuktu.

The hardest sentence there was the one about the drivers tinkering with the
Land Rover. I wanted it to be as simple as all the other sentences and yet have a
small  surprise  tucked  into  it—a  wry  touch  of  humor.  Otherwise  my  purpose  at
this point was to tell the remainder of the story as simply as possible:

So the four hours passed before we knew they were gone, as if we had
slipped  into  a  different  time  zone,  Sahara  time,  and  in  the  late  afternoon,
when  the  sun’s  heat  had  begun  to  ebb,  we  got  back  into  our  Land  Rovers,
which,  to  my  surprise,  still  worked,  and  set  out  across  the  Sahara  for  what
Mohammed Ali called our “encampment.” I pictured, if not a chieftain’s tent,
at least a tent—something that announced itself as an encampment. When
we finally did stop, it was at a spot that looked strikingly similar to what we
had  been  driving  over  all  day.  It  did,  however,  have  one  small  tree.  Some
Bedouin  women  were  crouched  under  it—black-garbed  figures,  their  faces
veiled—and Mohammed Ali put us down on the desert next to them.

The women shrank back at the sight of us—white aliens dumped abruptly
in their midst. They were huddled so close together that they looked like a
frieze. Obviously Mohammed Ali had just stopped at the first sight of “local

color” that he happened to find for his tourists, counting on us to manage for
ourselves after that. We could only sit and try to look friendly. But we were
very conscious of being intruders, and we probably looked as uncomfortable
as we felt. Only after we had sat there for a while did the black frieze slowly
come apart and turn into four women, three children and two naked babies.
Mohammed  Ali  had  gone  off  somewhere,  seemingly  not  wanting  to  have
anything  to  do  with  the  Bedouin;  perhaps  as  a  Tuareg  he  considered  them
desert riffraff.

But it was the Bedouin who had the grace to put us at ease. One of the
women,  lowering  her  veil  and  revealing  a  movie  star’s  smile—white  teeth
and  shining  black  eyes  in  a  beautiful  face—rummaged  in  her  belongings,
pulled out a blanket and a straw mat, and brought them over for us to sit on.
I remembered from all those books that in the desert there’s no such thing as
an intruder; anyone who turns up is somehow expected. Soon after that, two
Bedouin men came in from the desert, completing the family unit, which, we
now saw, consisted of two men, two wives for each man, and their various
children. The older husband, who had a strong and handsome face, greeted
both  of  his  wives  with  a  gentle  tap  on  the  head,  somewhat  like  a  blessing,
and  then  sat  down  not  far  from  me.  One  of  the  women  brought  him  his
dinner—some  millet  in  a  bowl.  He  immediately  offered  the  bowl  to  me.  I
declined, but the offer is one I won’t forget. We sat in companionable silence
while he ate. The children came over to get acquainted. The sun went down
and a full moon came up over the Sahara.

Meanwhile  our  drivers  had  spread  some  blankets  next  to  the  two  Land
Rovers  and  started  a  fire  with  desert  wood.  We  regrouped  on  our  own
blankets, watched the stars coming out in the desert sky, had some kind of
chicken for dinner, and got ready to turn in. Bathroom facilities were ad hoc
—to  each  his  own.  We  had  been  warned  that  Sahara  nights  were  cold  and
had  brought  sweaters  along.  I  put  on  my  sweater,  rolled  up  in  a  blanket,
which  slightly  softened  the  hardness  of  the  desert,  and  fell  asleep
surrounded  by  an  immense  stillness.  An  hour  later  I  was  awakened  by  an
equally  immense  racket—our  Bedouin  family  had  brought  in  their  herd  of
goats and their camels for the night. Then all was quiet again.

In  the  morning  I  noticed  paw  prints  in  the  sand  next  to  my  blanket.
Mohammed Ali said that a jackal had come by to clean up the leftovers from
our dinner—of which, as I recalled the chicken, there must have been quite a
few. But I didn’t hear a thing. I was too busy dreaming that I was Lawrence of
Arabia.

[END]

A crucial decision about a piece of writing is where to end it. Often the story
will tell you where it wants to stop. This ending was not the one I originally had
in mind. Because the goal of our trip was to find a salt caravan I assumed that I

would have to complete the ancient cycle of trade: to describe how we returned
to Timbuktu and saw the salt being unloaded and bought and sold in the market.
But the nearer I got to writing that final section, the more I didn’t want to write
it. It loomed as drudgery, no fun for me or for the reader.

Suddenly I remembered that I was under no obligation to the actual shape of
our trip. I didn’t have to reconstruct everything. The real climax of my story was
not finding the salt caravan; it was finding the timeless hospitality of the people
who  live  in  the  Sahara.  Not  many  moments  in  my  life  have  matched  the  one
when  a  family  of  nomads  with  almost  no  possessions  offered  to  share  their
dinner. Nor could any other moment distill more vividly what I had come to the
desert to find and what all those Englishmen had written about—the nobility of
living on the edge.

When you get such a message from your material—when your story tells you
it’s over, regardless of what subsequently happened—look for the door. I got out
fast, pausing only long enough to make sure that the unities were intact: that the
writer-guide who started the trip was the same person who was ending it. The
playful  reference  to  Lawrence  preserves  the  persona,  wraps  up  a  multitude  of
associations  and  brings  the  journey  full  circle.  The  realization  that  I  could  just
stop  was  a  terrific  feeling,  not  only  because  my  labors  were  over—the  jigsaw
puzzle solved—but because the ending felt right. It was the correct decision.

As a postscript, there’s one last decision I’d like to mention. It has to do with
the nonfiction writer’s need to make his or her own luck. An exhortation I often
use  to  keep  myself  going  is  “Get  on  the  plane.”  Two  of  the  most  emotional
moments of my life came as a result of getting on the plane in connection with
my book Mitchell & Ruff. First I went to Shanghai with the musicians Willie Ruff
and  Dwike  Mitchell  when  they  introduced  jazz  to  China  at  the  Shanghai
Conservatory of Music. A year later I went to Venice with Ruff to hear him play
Gregorian chants on his French horn in St. Mark’s basilica at night, when nobody
else was there, to study the acoustics that inspired the Venetian school of music.
In  both  cases  Ruff  had  no  assurance  that  he  would  be  allowed  to  play;  I  might
have wasted my time and money by deciding to go along. But I got on the plane,
and those two long pieces, which originally ran in The New Yorker, are probably
my two best articles. I got on the plane to Timbuktu to look for a camel caravan
that was an even bet not to materialize, and I got on the plane to Bradenton for
spring training not knowing whether I would be welcomed or rebuffed. My book
Writing to Learn was born because of one phone call from a stranger. It raised an
educational idea so interesting that I got on the plane to Minnesota to pursue it.
Getting on the plane has taken me to unusual stories all over the world and
all over America, and it still does. That isn’t to say I’m not nervous when I leave
for the airport; I always am—that’s part of the deal. (A little nervousness gives
writing an edge.) But I’m always replenished when I get back home.

As a nonfiction writer you must get on the plane. If a subject interests you, go
after it, even if it’s in the next county or the next state or the next country. It’s

not going to come looking for you.

Decide what you want to do. Then decide to do it. Then do it.

Writing Family History and Memoir

One  of  the  saddest  sentences  I  know  is  “I  wish  I  had  asked  my  mother  about
that.”  Or  my  father.  Or  my  grandmother.  Or  my  grandfather.  As  every  parent
knows, our children are not as fascinated by our fascinating lives as we are. Only
when  they  have  children  of  their  own—and  feel  the  first  twinges  of  their  own
advancing age—do they suddenly want to know more about their family heritage
and all its accretions of anecdote and lore. “What exactly were those stories my
dad used to tell about coming to America?” “Where exactly was that farm in the
Midwest where my mother grew up?”

Writers are the custodians of memory, and that’s what this chapter is about:
how to leave some kind of record of your life and of the family you were born
into. That record can take many shapes. It can be a formal memoir—a careful act
of  literary  construction.  Or  it  can  be  an  informal  family  history,  written  to  tell
your children and your grandchildren about the family they were born into. It can
be  the  oral  history  that  you  extract  by  tape  recorder  from  a  parent  or  a
grandparent too old or too sick to do any writing. Or it can be anything else you
want it to be: some hybrid mixture of history and reminiscence. Whatever it is,
it’s an important kind of writing. Memories too often die with their owner, and
time too often surprises us by running out.

My  father,  a  businessman  with  no  literary  pretensions,  wrote  two  family
histories in his old age. It was the perfect task for a man with few gifts for self-
amusement. Sitting in his favorite green leather armchair in an apartment high
above Park Avenue, he wrote a history of his side of the family—the Zinssers and
the Scharmanns—going back to 19th-century Germany. Then he wrote a history
of the family shellac business on West 59th Street that his grandfather founded
in  1849.  He  wrote  with  a  pencil  on  a  yellow  legal  pad,  never  pausing—then  or
ever again—to rewrite. He had no patience with any enterprise that obliged him
to  reexamine  or  slow  down.  On  the  golf  course,  walking  toward  his  ball,  he
would assess the situation, pick a club out of the bag and swing at the ball as he
approached it, hardly breaking stride.

When  my  father  finished  writing  his  histories  he  had  them  typed,
mimeographed  and  bound  in  a  plastic  cover.  He  gave  a  copy,  personally

inscribed, to each of his three daughters, to their husbands, to me, to my wife,
and to his 15 grandchildren, some of whom couldn’t yet read. I like the fact that
they all got their own copy; it recognized each of them as an equal partner in the
family saga. How many of those grandchildren spent any time with the histories I
have  no  idea.  But  I’ll  bet  some  of  them  did,  and  I  like  to  think  that  those  15
copies  are  now  squirreled  away  somewhere  in  their  houses  from  Maine  to
California, waiting for the next generation.

What  my  father  did  strikes  me  as  a  model  for  a  family  history  that  doesn’t
aspire  to  be  anything  more;  the  idea  of  having  it  published  wouldn’t  have
occurred to him. There are many good reasons for writing that have nothing to
do with being published. Writing is a powerful search mechanism, and one of its
satisfactions  is  to  come  to  terms  with  your  life  narrative.  Another  is  to  work
illness,  addiction,
life’s  hardest  knocks—loss,  grief,
through  some  of
disappointment, failure—and to find understanding and solace.

My father’s two histories have steadily grown on me. At first I don’t think I
was as generous toward them as I should have been; probably I condescended to
the ease with which he brought off a process I found so hard. But over the years
I’ve  often  found  myself  dipping  into  them  to  remind  myself  of  some  long-lost
relative, or to check some long-lost fact of New York geography, and with every
reading I admire the writing more.

Above  all,  there’s  the  matter  of  voice.  Not  being  a  writer,  my  father  never
worried  about  finding  his  “style.”  He  just  wrote  the  way  he  talked,  and  now,
when I read his sentences, I hear his personality and his humor, his idioms and
his usages, many of them an echo of his college years in the early 1900s. I also
hear his honesty. He wasn’t sentimental about blood ties, and I smile at his terse
appraisals  of  Uncle  X,  “a  second-rater,”  or  Cousin  Y,  who  “never  amounted  to
much.”

Remember  this  when  you  write  your  own  family  history.  Don’t  try  to  be  a
“writer.” It now occurs to me that my father was a more natural writer than I am,
with  my  constant  fiddling  and  fussing.  Be  yourself  and  your  readers  will  follow
you  anywhere.  Try  to  commit  an  act  of  writing  and  your  readers  will  jump
overboard  to  get  away.  Your  product  is  you.  The  crucial  transaction  in  memoir
and  personal  history  is  the  transaction  between  you  and  your  remembered
experiences and emotions.

In  his  family  history  my  father  didn’t  dodge  the  central  trauma  of  his
childhood:  the  abrupt  end  of  his  parents’  marriage  when  he  and  his  brother
Rudolph  were  still  small  boys.  Their  mother  was  the  daughter  of  a  self-made
German immigrant, H. B. Scharmann, who went to California as a teenager in a
covered wagon with the Forty-niners and lost both his mother and his sister on
the journey. Frida Scharmann inherited his fierce pride and ambition, and when
she  married  William  Zinsser,  a  promising  young  man  in  her  circle  of  German-
American  friends,  she  saw  him  as  the  answer  to  her  cultural  aspirations.  They
would  spend  their  evenings  going  to  concerts  and  to  the  opera  and  holding

musical salons. But the promising husband evidently turned out to have no such
yearnings. Home was for falling asleep in his chair after dinner.

How bitterly his lassitude must have dawned on the young Frida Zinsser I can
imagine  from  knowing  her  as  an  older  woman,  endlessly  pushing  herself  to
Carnegie Hall, playing Beethoven and Brahms on the piano, traveling to Europe
and  learning  foreign  languages,  prodding  my  father  and  my  sisters  and  me  to
cultural self-improvement. Her drive to fulfill the broken dreams of her marriage
never faltered. But she had the German penchant for telling people off, and she
died alone at 81, having scolded away all her friends.

I wrote about her once, many years ago, in a memoir for a book called Five
Boyhoods.  Describing  the  grandmother  I  knew  as  a  boy,  I  praised  her  strength
but also noted that she was a difficult presence in our lives. After the book came
out my mother defended the mother-in-law who had made her own life far from
easy.  “Grandma  was  really  quite  shy,”  she  said,  “and  she  wanted  to  be  liked.”
Maybe so; the truth is somewhere between my mother’s version and mine. But
she was like that to me. That was my remembered truth, and that’s how I wrote
it.

I mention this because one of the questions often asked by memoir writers
is: Should I write from the point of view of the child I once was, or of the adult I
am now? The strongest memoirs, I think, are those that preserve the unity of a
remembered  time  and  place:  books  like  Russell  Baker’s  Growing  Up,  or  V.S.
Pritchett’s A Cab at the Door, or Jill Ker Conway’s The Road from Coorain, which
recall  what  it  was  like  to  be  a  child  or  an  adolescent  in  a  world  of  adults
contending with life’s adversities.

But  if  you  prefer  the  other  route—to  write  about  your  younger  years  from
the  wiser  perspective  of  your  older  years—that  memoir  will  have  its  own
integrity.  One  good  example  is  Poets  in  Their  Youth,  in  which  Eileen  Simpson
recalls her early life with her first husband, John Berryman, and his famously self-
destructive fellow poets, including Robert Lowell and Delmore Schwartz, whose
demons  she  was  too  young  as  a  bride  to  understand.  When  she  revisited  that
period  in  her  memoir  as  an  older  woman  she  had  become  a  writer  and  a
practicing  psychotherapist,  and  she  used  that  clinical  knowledge  to  create  an
invaluable  portrait  of  a  major  school  of  American  poetry.  But  these  are  two
different kinds of writing. Choose one.

My father’s family history told me details about his mother’s marriage that I
didn’t  have  when  I  wrote  my  memoir.  Now,  knowing  those  facts,  I  can
understand the disappointments that made her the woman she became, and if I
were to take another shot at the family saga today I would bring to it a lifetime
of  trying  to  fathom  its  Germanic  storms  and  stresses.  (My  mother’s  family  of
New  England  Yankees—Knowltons  and  Joyces—managed  to  get  through  life
without emotional melodrama.) I would also bring to it a lifetime of regret over
the tremendous hole at the center of my father’s story. In his two histories his
father gets scant mention and no forgiveness; all sympathy goes to the aggrieved

young divorcée and her lifelong grit.

Yet some of my father’s most attractive qualities—the charm, the humor, the
lightness,  the  bluest  of  blue  eyes—must  have  come  from  the  Zinsser  side,  not
from  the  brooding,  brown-eyed  Scharmanns.  I’ve  always  felt  deprived  of
knowing  more  about  that  missing  grandfather.  Whenever  I  asked  my  father
about  him  he  changed  the  subject  and  had  no  stories  to  tell.  When  you  write
your family history, be a recording angel and record everything your descendants
might want to know.

This  brings  me  to  another  question  that  memoir  writers  often  ask:  What
about  the  privacy  of  the  people  I  write  about?  Should  I  leave  out  things  that
might offend or hurt my relatives? What will my sister think?

Don’t worry about that problem in advance. Your first job is to get your story
down  as  you  remember  it—now.  Don’t  look  over  your  shoulder  to  see  what
relatives are perched there. Say what you want to say, freely and honestly, and
finish  the  job.  Then  take  up  the  privacy  issue.  If  you  wrote  your  family  history
only for your family, there’s no legal or ethical need to show it to anyone else.
But  if  you  have  in  mind  a  broader  audience—a  mailing  to  friends  or  a  possible
book—you  may  want  to  show  your  relatives  the  pages  in  which  they  are
mentioned. That’s a basic courtesy; nobody wants to be surprised in print. It also
gives  them  their  moment  to  ask  you  to  take  certain  passages  out—which  you
may or may not agree to do.

Finally,  it’s  your  story—you’re  the  one  who  has  done  all  the  work.  If  your
sister has a problem with your memoir she can write her own memoir, and it will
be  just  as  valid  as  yours;  nobody  has  a  monopoly  on  the  shared  past.  Some  of
your relatives will wish you hadn’t said some of the things you said, especially if
you  reveal  various  family  traits  that  are  less  than  lovable.  But  I  believe  that  at
some deep level most families want to have a record left of their effort to be a
family, however flawed that effort was, and they will give you their blessing and
will thank you for taking on the job. If you do it honestly and not for the wrong
reasons.

What  are  the  wrong  reasons?  Let  me  take  you  back  to  the  memoir-crazed
1990s. Until that decade, memoir writers drew a veil over their most shameful
experiences and thoughts; certain civilities were still agreed on by society. Then
talk shows came into their own and shame went out the window. Suddenly no
remembered episode was too squalid, no family too dysfunctional, to be trotted
out for the titillation of the masses on cable TV and in magazines and books. The
result  was  an  avalanche  of  memoirs  that  were  little  more  than  therapy,  their
authors  using  the  form  to  wallow  in  self-revelation  and  self-pity  and  to  bash
everyone who had ever done them wrong. Writing was out and whining was in.

But  nobody  remembers  those  books  today;  readers  won’t  connect  with
whining. Don’t use your memoir to air old grievances and to settle old scores; get
rid of that anger somewhere else. The memoirs that we do remember from the
1990s are the ones that were written with love and forgiveness, like Mary Karr’s

The  Liars’  Club,  Frank  McCourt’s  Angela’s  Ashes,  Tobias  Wolff’s  This  Boy’s  Life,
and  Pete  Hamill’s  A  Drinking  Life.  Although  the  childhoods  they  describe  were
painful,  the  writers  are  as  hard  on  their  younger  selves  as  they  are  on  their
elders.  We  are  not  victims,  they  want  us  to  know.  We  come  from  a  tribe  of
fallible people and we have survived without resentment to get on with our lives.
For them, writing a memoir became an act of healing.

It  can  also  be  an  act  of  healing  for  you.  If  you  make  an  honest  transaction
with your own humanity and with the humanity of the people who crossed your
life, no matter how much pain they caused you or you caused them, readers will
connect with your journey.

Now  comes  the  hard  part:  how  to  organize  the  damn  thing.  Most  people
embarking  on  a  memoir  are  paralyzed  by  the  size  of  the  task.  What  to  put  in?
What to leave out? Where to start? Where to stop? How to shape the story? The
past  looms  over  them  in  a  thousand  fragments,  defying  them  to  impose  on  it
some kind of order. Because of this anxiety, many memoirs linger for years half-
written, or never get written at all.

What can be done?
You  must  make  a  series  of  reducing  decisions.  For  example:  in  a  family
history, one big decision would be to write about only one branch of the family.
Families  are  complex  organisms,  especially  if  you  trace  them  back  several
generations.  Decide  to  write  about  your  mother’s  side  of  the  family  or  your
father’s side, but not both. Return to the other one later and make it a separate
project.

Remember that you are the protagonist in your memoir—the tour guide. You
must  find  a  narrative  trajectory  for  the  story  you  want  to  tell  and  never
relinquish  control.  This  means  leaving  out  of  your  memoir  many  people  who
don’t need to be there. Like siblings.

One  of  my  students  in  a  memoir  class  was  a  woman  who  wanted  to  write
about  the  house  in  Michigan  where  she  grew  up.  Her  mother  had  died,  the
house  had  been  sold,  and  she  and  her  father  and  her  ten  sisters  and  brothers
were about to meet at the house to dispose of its contents. Writing about that
task,  she  thought,  would  help  her  to  understand  her  childhood  in  that  large
Catholic family. I agreed—it was a perfect framework for a memoir—and I asked
her how she was going to proceed.

She said she was going to start by interviewing her father and all her brothers
and sisters to find out how they remembered the house. I asked her if the story
she wanted to write was their story. No, she said, it was her story. In that case, I
said,  interviewing  all  those  siblings  would  be  an  almost  complete  waste  of  her
time  and  energy.  Only  then  did  she  begin  to  glimpse  the  proper  shape  of  her
story  and  to  prepare  her  mind  for  confronting  the  house  and  its  memories.  I
saved  her  hundreds  of  hours  of  interviewing  and  transcribing  and  trying  to  fit
what she transcribed into her memoir, where it didn’t belong. It’s your story. You
only need to interview family members who have a unique insight into a family

situation, or an anecdote that unlocks a puzzle you were unable to solve.

Here’s another story from another class.
A young Jewish woman named Helen Blatt was very eager to write about her
father’s  experience  as  a  survivor  of  the  Holocaust.  He  had  escaped  from  his
village  in  Poland  at  the  age  of  14—one  of  the  few  Jews  to  get  away—and  had
made his way to Italy, to New Orleans and, finally, to New York. Now he was 80,
and his daughter asked him to go back with her to that Polish village so she could
hear about his early life and write his story. But he begged off; he was too frail
and the past was too painful.

So she made the trip on her own in 2004. She took notes and photographs
and  talked  with  people  in  the  village.  But  she  couldn’t  find  enough  facts  to
enable  her  to  do  justice  to  her  father’s  story,  and  she  was  deeply  upset  about
that. Her despair hung over the class.

For a few moments I couldn’t think of anything to tell her. Finally I said, “It’s

not your father’s story.”

She  gave  me  a  look  that  I  still  remember  as  it  dawned  on  her  what  I  was

saying.

“It’s your story,” I told her. I pointed out that nobody has enough facts—not
even scholars of the Holocaust—to reconstruct her father’s early life; too much
of the Jewish past in Europe has been obliterated. “If you write about your own
search for your father’s past,” I said, “you’ll also tell the story of his life and his
heritage.”

I saw a heavy weight drop off her shoulders. She smiled a smile that none of

us had seen before and said she would get started on the story right away.

The course ended and no paper was handed in. I called her and she said she
was  still  writing  and  needed  more  time.  Then,  one  day,  a  24-page  manuscript
arrived in the mail. It was called “Returning Home,” and it described Helen Blatt’s
pilgrimage to Plesna, a small rural town in southeastern Poland that wasn’t even
on  the  map.  “Sixty-five  years  later,”  she  wrote,  “I  was  the  first  member  of  the
Blatt family the town had seen since 1939.” Gradually making herself known to
the  townspeople,  she  found  that  many  of  her  father’s  relatives—grandparents
and  uncles  and  aunts—were  still  remembered.  When  one  old  man  said,  “You
look  just  like  your  grandmother  Helen,”  she  felt  “an  overwhelming  sense  of
safety and peacefulness.”

This is how her story ends:

After I returned home my father and I spent three straight days together.
He  watched  every  minute  of  the  four-hour  video  I  made  as  if  it  were  a
masterpiece. He wanted to hear every detail of my trip: who I met, where I
went,  what  I  saw,  what  foods  I  liked  and  disliked,  and  how  I  was  treated.  I
assured  him  that  I  was  welcomed  with  open  arms.  Although  I  still  have  no
photos  of  my  family  telling  me  what  their  faces  looked  like,  I  now  have  a
mental  picture  of  their  character.  The  fact  that  I  was  treated  so  well  by

complete  strangers  is  a  reflection  of  the  respect  my  grandparents  earned
from the community. I gave my father boxes of letters and gifts from his old
friends: Polish vodka and maps and framed photos and drawings of Plesna.

As I told him my stories he looked like an excited child waiting to open his
birthday present. The sadness in his eyes also disappeared; he looked jubilant
and giddy. When he saw his family’s property on my video I expected to see
him cry, and he did, but they were tears of joy. He seemed so proud, and I
asked  him,  “Daddy,  what  are  you  looking  at  with  such  pride?  Is  it  your
house?” He said, “No, it’s you! You have become my eyes and ears and legs.
Thank you for taking this trip. It makes me feel as if I’ve gone there myself.”

My  final  reducing  advice  can  be  summed  up  in  two  words:  Think  small.  Don’t
rummage around in your past—or your family’s past—to find episodes that you
think are “important” enough to be worthy of including in your memoir. Look for
small  self-contained  incidents  that  are  still  vivid  in  your  memory.  If  you  still
remember them it’s because they contain a universal truth that your readers will
recognize from their own life.

That  turned  out  to  be  the  main  lesson  I  learned  by  writing  a  book  in  2004
called Writing About Your Life. The book is a memoir of my own life, but along
the way, I also pause to explain the reducing and organizing decisions I made. I
never  felt  that  my  memoir  had  to  include  all  the  important  things  that  ever
happened  to  me—a  common  temptation  when  old  people  sit  down  to
summarize  their  life  journey.  Many  of  the  chapters  in  my  memoir  are  about
small episodes that were not objectively “important” but that were important to
me.  Because  they  were  important  to  me  they  also  struck  an  emotional  chord
with readers, touching a universal truth that was important to them.

One chapter is about a mechanical baseball game I played for thousands of
hours  with  my  boyhood  friend  Charlie  Willis.  The  chapter  begins  by  explaining
that  in  1983  I  wrote  an  article  in  the  New  York  Times  describing  that  youthful
obsession. I said that my mother must have thrown my game away when I went
into  the  army.  “But  in  the  mists  of  memory  I  see  the  word  WOLVERINE.  What
‘Rosebud’ was to Citizen Kane, ‘Wolverine’ is to me—a clue almost irrecoverably
faint. I mention it in case anyone finds the game in an attic or a basement or a
garage. I can be there on the next plane—and so can Charlie Willis.”

It only took a few days for letters to arrive from other men who once owned
the game and who recalled playing it incessantly with boyhood friends. The last
one was postmarked Booneville, Arkansas, and I could hardly believe the return
address:  WOLVERINE  TOY  COMPANY.  The  letter  was  from  William  W.  Lehren,  vice
president for sales. “We stopped making the ‘Pennant Winner’ in 1950,” he said,
“but  I  dug  around  in  our  museum  and  found  that  we  still  had  one.  If  you  ever
happen to be in this vicinity I’d love to take you on for a few games.”

I never made it to Booneville, but in 1999 Bill Lehren retired to Connecticut,
and  one  day  he  gave  me  a  call.  He  said  he  had  bought  that  last  “Pennant

Winner” from Wolverine and he wanted to know if I was still up for a game. A
few  days  later  he  came  to  my  office  in  New  York  and  unwrapped  the  game  I
hadn’t seen in more than 60 years.

It was a thing of beauty, and as I gazed upon its shiny green metallic infield I
could still feel in my fingertips the bat as I used to hold it back on its tightly coiled
spring, waiting for the pitch. I could also feel the “fast” and “slow” buttons, one
on each side, that delivered the pitch at various speeds. Bill and I lifted the game
down  onto  the  rug  and  went  to  work—two  men  in  their  seventies  kneeling  at
opposite ends and getting up every half-inning to change sides. Outside, the sun
went down and the sky over Lexington Avenue turned dark. But we didn’t notice.
That’s  a  highly  specialized  subject  for  a  piece  of  writing;  not  many  people
owned a mechanical baseball game. But everybody had a favorite childhood toy
or game or doll. The fact that I had such a toy, and that it was brought back to
me  at  the  other  end  of  my  life,  can’t  help  connecting  with  readers  who  would
like to hold their favorite toy or game or doll one more time. They don’t identify
with  my  baseball  game;  they  identify  with  the  idea  of  the  game—a  universal
idea.  Remember  this  when  you  write  your  memoir  and  worry  that  your  story
isn’t big enough to interest anyone else. The small stories that still stick in your
memory have a resonance of their own. Trust them.

Another  chapter  in  Writing  About  Your  Life  is  about  serving  in  the  army  in
World  War  II.  Like  most  men  of  my  generation,  I  recall  that  war  as  the  pivotal
experience  of  my  life.  But  in  my  memoir  I  don’t  write  anything  about  the  war
itself.  I  just  tell  one  story  about  one  trip  I  took  across  North  Africa  after  our
troopship  landed  at  Casablanca.  My  fellow  GIs  and  I  were  put  on  a  train
consisting  of  decrepit  wooden  boxcars  called  “forty-and-eights,”  so  named
because they were first used by the French in World War I to transport forty men
or eight horses. The words QUARANTE HOMMES OU HUIT CHEVAUX were still stenciled on
them.

For six days I sat in the open door of that boxcar with my feet hanging out
over  Morocco,  Algeria  and  Tunisia.  It  was  the  most  uncomfortable  ride  I  ever
took—and the best. I couldn’t believe I was in North Africa. I was the sheltered
son of Northeastern WASPs; nobody in my upbringing or my education had ever
mentioned the Arabs. Now, suddenly, I was in a landscape where everything was
new—every sight and sound and smell. The eight months I would spend in that
exotic land were the start of a romance that has never cooled. They would make
me  a  lifelong  traveler  to  Africa  and  Asia  and  other  remote  cultures  and  would
forever change how I thought about the world.

Remember: Your biggest stories will often have less to do with their subject
than  with  their  significance—not  what  you  did  in  a  certain  situation,  but  how
that situation affected you and shaped the person you became.

As  for  how  to  actually  put  your  memoir  together,  my  final  advice  is—again—
think  small.  Tackle  your  life  in  manageable  chunks.  Don’t  visualize  the  finished
product: the grand edifice you have vowed to construct. That will only make you

anxious.

Here’s what I suggest.
Go to your desk on Monday morning and write about some event that’s still
vivid in your memory. It doesn’t have to be long—three pages, five pages—but it
should have a beginning and an end. Put that episode in a folder and get on with
your  life.  On  Tuesday  morning,  do  the  same  thing.  Tuesday’s  episode  doesn’t
have to be related to Monday’s episode. Take whatever memory comes calling;
your subconscious mind, having been put to work, will start delivering your past.
Keep  this  up  for  two  months,  or  three  months,  or  six  months.  Don’t  be
impatient to start writing your “memoir”—the one you had in mind before you
began. Then, one day, take all your entries out of their folder and spread them
on the floor. (The floor is often a writer’s best friend.) Read them through and
see what they tell you and what patterns emerge. They will tell you what your
memoir is about—and what it’s not about. They will tell you what’s primary and
what’s  secondary,  what’s  interesting  and  what’s  not,  what’s  emotional,  what’s
important, what’s unusual, what’s funny, what’s worth pursuing and expanding.
You’ll  begin  to  glimpse  your  story’s  narrative  shape  and  the  road  you  want  to
take.

Then all you have to do is put the pieces together.

Write as Well as You Can

I’m occasionally asked if I can recall the moment when I knew I wanted to be a
writer. No such blinding flash occurred; I only knew that I thought I would like to
work for a newspaper. But I can point to a set of attitudes that I inherited early in
life and that have guided me ever since. They came from both sides of my family,
by different routes.

My  mother  loved  good  writing,  and  she  found  it  as  often  in  newspapers  as
she did in books. She regularly clipped columns and articles out of the paper that
delighted  her  with  their  graceful  use  of  language,  or  their  wit,  or  their  original
vision of life. Because of her I knew at an early age that good writing can appear
anywhere,  even  in  the  lowly  newspaper,  and  that  what  matters  is  the  writing
itself, not the medium where it’s published. Therefore I’ve always tried to write
as well as I could by my own standards; I’ve never changed my style to fit the size
or  the  presumed  education  of  the  audience  I  was  writing  for.  My  mother  was
also  a  woman  of  humor  and  optimism.  These  are  lubricants  in  writing,  as  they
are in life, and a writer lucky enough to have them in his baggage will start the
day with an extra round of confidence.

Originally  I  wasn’t  meant  to  be  a  writer.  My  father  was  a  businessman.  His
grandfather  had  come  from  Germany  in  the  great  immigration  of  1848  with  a
formula for making shellac. He built a small house and factory in a rocky field far
uptown  in  Manhattan—at  what  is  now  59th  Street  and  Tenth  Avenue—and
started a business called William Zinsser & Company. I still have a photograph of
that pastoral scene; the land slopes down toward the Hudson River, and the only
living  creature  is  a  goat.  The  firm  stayed  at  that  location  until  1973,  when  it
moved to New Jersey.

For a business to remain in the same family on the same Manhattan block for
more  than  a  century  is  rare,  and  as  a  boy  I  couldn’t  escape  the  naggings  of
continuity, for I was the fourth William Zinsser and the only son; my father’s fate
was  to  have  three  daughters  first.  In  those  Dark  Ages  the  idea  that  daughters
could  run  a  business  as  well  as  sons,  or  better,  was  still  two  decades  off.  My
father was a man who  loved his business. When he  talked about it I never felt
that he regarded it as a venture for making money; it was an art, to be practiced

with  imagination  and  only  the  best  materials.  He  had  a  passion  for  quality  and
had no patience with the second-rate; he never went into a store looking for a
bargain.  He  charged  more  for  his  product  because  he  made  it  with  the  best
ingredients, and his company prospered. It was a ready-made future for me, and
my father looked forward to the day when I would join him.

But inevitably a different day arrived, and not long after I came home from
the war I went to work for the New York Herald Tribune and had to tell my father
I  wasn’t  going  to  carry  on  the  family  business.  He  accepted  the  news  with  his
usual  generosity  and  wished  me  well  in  my  chosen  field.  No  boy  or  girl  could
receive  a  finer  gift.  I  was  liberated  from  having  to  fulfill  somebody  else’s
expectations, which were not the right ones for me. I was free to succeed or fail
on my own terms.

Only later did I realize that I took along on my journey another gift from my
father: a bone-deep belief that quality is its own reward. I, too, have never gone
into  a  store  looking  for  a  bargain.  Although  my  mother  was  the  literary  one  in
our  family—magpie  collector  of  books,  lover  of  the  English  language,  writer  of
dazzling  letters—it  was  from  the  world  of  business  that  I  absorbed  my
craftsman’s  ethic,  and  over  the  years,  when  I  found  myself  endlessly  rewriting
what I had endlessly rewritten, determined to write better than everybody who
was competing for the same space, the inner voice I was hearing was the voice of
my father talking about shellac.

Besides  wanting  to  write  as  well  as  possible,  I  wanted  to  write  as
entertainingly as possible. When I tell aspiring writers that they should think of
themselves  as  part  entertainer,  they  don’t  like  to  hear  it—the  word  smacks  of
carnivals  and  jugglers  and  clowns.  But  to  succeed  you  must  make  your  piece
jump out of a newspaper or a magazine by being more diverting than everyone
else’s  piece.  You  must  find  some  way  to  elevate  your  act  of  writing  into  an
entertainment. Usually this means giving the reader an enjoyable surprise. Any
number  of  devices  will  do  the  job:  humor,  anecdote,  paradox,  an  unexpected
quotation,  a  powerful  fact,  an  outlandish  detail,  a  circuitous  approach,  an
elegant arrangement of words. These seeming amusements in fact become your
“style.” When we say we like the style of certain writers, what we mean is that
we like their personality as they express it on paper. Given a choice between two
traveling companions—and a writer is someone who asks us to travel with him—
we usually choose the one who we think will make an effort to brighten the trip.
Unlike  medicine  or  the  other  sciences,  writing  has  no  new  discoveries  to
spring  on  us.  We’re  in  no  danger  of  reading  in  our  morning  newspaper  that  a
breakthrough  has  been  made  in  how  to  write  a  clear  English  sentence—that
information  has  been  around  since  the  King  James  Bible.  We  know  that  verbs
have more vigor than nouns, that active verbs are better than passive verbs, that
short  words  and  sentences  are  easier  to  read  than  long  ones,  that  concrete
details are easier to process than vague abstractions.

Obviously  the  rules  have  often  been  bent.  Victorian  writers  had  a  taste  for

the  ornate  and  didn’t  consider  brevity  a  virtue,  and  many  modern  writers,  like
Tom  Wolfe,  have  broken  out  of  the  cage,  turning  a  headlong  exuberance  of
language  into  a  source  of  positive  energy.  Such  skillful  acrobats,  however,  are
rare; most nonfiction writers will do well to cling to the ropes of simplicity and
clarity.  We  may  be  given  new  technologies  like  the  computer  to  ease  the
burdens  of  composition,  but  on  the  whole  we  know  what  we  need  to  know.
We’re all working with the same words and the same principles.

Where, then, is the edge? Ninety percent of the answer lies in the hard work
of mastering the tools discussed in this book. Add a few points for such natural
gifts as a good musical ear, a sense of rhythm and a feeling for words. But the
final advantage is the same one that applies in every other competitive venture.
If you would like to write better than everybody else, you have to want to write
better  than  everybody  else.  You  must  take  an  obsessive  pride  in  the  smallest
details  of  your  craft.  And  you  must  be  willing  to  defend  what  you’ve  written
against  the  various  middlemen—editors,  agents  and  publishers—whose  sights
may be different from yours, whose standards not as high. Too many writers are
browbeaten into settling for less than their best.

I’ve always felt that my “style”—the careful projection onto paper of who I
think I am—is my main marketable asset, the one possession that might set me
apart from other writers. Therefore I’ve never wanted anyone to tinker with it,
and after I submit an article I protect it fiercely. Several magazine editors have
told me I’m the only writer they know who cares what happens to his piece after
he gets paid for it. Most writers won’t argue with an editor because they don’t
want to annoy him; they’re so grateful to be published that they agree to having
their style—in other words, their personality—violated in public.

Yet to defend what you’ve written is a sign that you are alive. I’m a known
crank  on  this  issue—I  fight  over  every  semicolon.  But  editors  put  up  with  me
because  they  can  see  that  I’m  serious.  In  fact,  my  crankiness  has  brought  me
more  work  than  it  has  driven  away.  Editors  with  an  unusual  assignment  often
thought  of  me  because  they  knew  I  would  do  it  with  unusual  care.  They  also
knew  they  would  get  the  article  on  time  and  that  it  would  be  accurate.
Remember that the craft of nonfiction writing involves more than writing. It also
means being reliable. Editors will properly drop a writer they can’t count on.

Which brings us to editors. Are they friends or enemies—gods who save us
from our sins or bums who trample on our poetic souls? Like the rest of creation,
they  come  in  all  varieties.  I  think  with  gratitude  of  a  half-dozen  editors  who
sharpened my writing by changing its focus or emphasis, or questioning its tone,
or detecting weaknesses of logic or structure, or suggesting a different lead, or
letting  me  talk  a  problem  through  with  them  when  I  couldn’t  decide  between
several  routes,  or  cutting  various  forms  of  excess.  Twice  I  threw  out  an  entire
chapter  of  a  book  because  editors  told  me  it  was  unnecessary.  But  above  all  I
remember those good editors for their generosity. They had an enthusiasm for
whatever project we were trying to bring off together as writer and editor. Their

confidence that I could make it work kept me going.

What a good editor brings to a piece of writing is an objective eye that the
writer  has  long  since  lost,  and  there  is  no  end  of  ways  in  which  an  editor  can
improve  a  manuscript:  pruning,  shaping,  clarifying,  tidying  a  hundred
inconsistencies  of  tense  and  pronoun  and  location  and  tone,  noticing  all  the
sentences  that  could  be  read  in  two  different  ways,  dividing  awkward  long
sentences  into  short  ones,  putting  the  writer  back  on  the  main  road  if  he  has
strayed down a side path, building bridges where the writer has lost the reader
by not paying attention to his transitions, questioning matters of judgment and
taste.  An  editor’s  hand  must  also  be  invisible.  Whatever  he  adds  in  his  own
words  shouldn’t  sound  like  his  own  words;  they  should  sound  like  the  writer’s
words.

For  all  these  acts  of  salvation,  editors  can’t  be  thanked  fervently  enough.
Unfortunately, they can also do considerable harm. In general the damage takes
two forms: altering style and altering content. Let’s look at style first.

A  good  editor  likes  nothing  better  than  a  piece  of  copy  he  hardly  has  to
touch. A bad editor has a compulsion to tinker, proving with busywork that he
hasn’t  forgotten  the  minutiae  of  grammar  and  usage.  He  is  a  literal  fellow,
catching  cracks  in  the  road  but  not  enjoying  the  scenery.  Very  often  it  simply
doesn’t occur to him that a writer is writing by ear, trying to achieve a particular
sound or cadence, or playing with words just for the pleasures of wordplay. One
of  the  bleakest  moments  for  writers  is  the  one  when  they  realize  that  their
editor has missed the point of what they are trying to do.

I remember many such dismal revelations. A minor one that comes to mind
involved an article I wrote about a program called Visiting Artists, which brought
artists  and  musicians  to  a  group  of  economically  depressed  Midwestern  cities.
Describing  them,  I  wrote:  “They  don’t  look  like  cities  that  get  visited  by  many
visiting artists.” When the galleys came back the sentence said: “They don’t look
like cities that are on the itinerary of many visiting artists.” A small point? Not to
me. I had used repetition because it’s a device I like—it takes readers by surprise
and refreshes them in midsentence. But the editor remembered the rule about
substituting synonyms for words that are repeated, and he corrected my error.
When I called to protest, he was amazed. We argued for a long time, neither of
us yielding. Finally he said, “You really feel strongly about this, don’t you?” I feel
strongly that one such erosion leads to another and that the writer must take a
stand.  I’ve  even  bought  articles  back  from  magazines  that  made  changes  I
wouldn’t accept. If you allow your distinctiveness to be edited out, you will lose
one of your main virtues. You will also lose your virtue.

Ideally  the  relationship  between  a  writer  and  an  editor  should  be  one  of
negotiation and trust. Frequently an editor will make a change to clarify a muddy
sentence and will inadvertently lose an important point—a fact or a nuance that
the writer included for reasons the editor didn’t know about. In such cases the
writer should ask to have his point back. The editor, if he agrees, should oblige.

But he should also insist on his right to fix whatever had been unclear. Clarity is
what every editor owes the reader. An editor should never allow something to
get  into  print  that  he  doesn’t  understand.  If  he  doesn’t  understand  it,  at  least
one other person won’t, and that’s one too many. The process, in short, is one in
which  the  writer  and  the  editor  proceed  through  the  manuscript  together,
finding for every problem the solution that best serves the finished article.

It’s a process that can be done just as well over the phone as in person. Don’t
let editors use distance or their own disarray as an excuse for altering your work
without  your  consent.  “We  were  on  deadline,”  “we  were  already  late,”  “the
person who usually deals with you was out sick,” “we had a big shake-up here
last week,” “our new publisher has just come on board,” “it got put in the wrong
pile,”  “the  editor’s  on  vacation”—these  dreary  phrases  cloak  a  multitude  of
inefficiencies  and  sins.  One  unpleasant  change  in  the  publishing  profession  has
been  the  erosion  of  courtesies  that  were  once  routine.  Magazine  editors,
especially, have become cavalier about a whole series of procedures that should
be  automatic:  notifying  the  writer  that  the  piece  has  arrived,  reading  it  with
reasonable speed, telling the writer whether it’s O.K., returning it immediately if
it’s not, working supportively with the writer if the piece needs changes, sending
the  writer  galley  proofs,  seeing  that  the  writer  gets  paid  promptly.  Writers  are
vulnerable enough without being put through the repeated indignities of calling
to learn the status of their article and to beg for their money.

The  prevailing  notion  is  that  such  “courtesies”  are  merely  frills  and  can
therefore be dismissed. On the contrary, they are organic to the craft. They are
the  code  of  honor  that  anchors  the  whole  enterprise,  and  editors  who  forget
them are toying with nothing less than the writer’s fundamental rights.

This arrogance is at its most injurious when an editor goes beyond changes of
style or structure and enters the sacred realm of content. I often hear freelance
writers say, “When I got the magazine I looked for my article and I didn’t even
recognize it. They had written a whole new lead and had me saying things that
aren’t  what  I  believe.”  That’s  the  cardinal  sin—tampering  with  a  writer’s
opinions. But editors will do what writers allow them to do, especially if time is
short.  Writers  conspire  in  their  own  humiliation,  allowing  their  piece  to  be
rewritten  by  an  editor  to  serve  his  own  purposes.  With  every  surrender  they
remind editors that they can be treated like hired help.

But finally the purposes that writers serve must be their own. What you write
is yours and nobody else’s. Take your talent as far as you can and guard it with
your  life.  Only  you  know  how  far  that  is;  no  editor  knows.  Writing  well  means
believing  in  your  writing  and  believing  in  yourself,  taking  risks,  daring  to  be
different,  pushing  yourself  to  excel.  You  will  write  only  as  well  as  you  make
yourself write.

My favorite definition of a careful writer comes from Joe DiMaggio, though
he didn’t know that’s what he was defining. DiMaggio was the greatest player I
ever  saw,  and  nobody  looked  more  relaxed.  He  covered  vast  distances  in  the

outfield, moving in graceful strides, always arriving ahead of the ball, making the
hardest  catch  look  routine,  and  even  when  he  was  at  bat,  hitting  the  ball  with
tremendous power, he didn’t appear to be exerting himself. I marveled at how
effortless he looked because what he did could only be achieved by great daily
effort.  A  reporter  once  asked  him  how  he  managed  to  play  so  well  so
consistently, and he said: “I always thought that there was at least one person in
the stands who had never seen me play, and I didn’t want to let him down.”
