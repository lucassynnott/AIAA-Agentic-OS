Advanced Praise for

The 16-Word Sales Letter™

“This is the book I've been waiting for.
For years, I've been asking myself: How can a guy
whose native language is not even English be one of
the best U.S. copywriters in history? Now I have the
answer... nicely reduced to a simple, understandable
formula. And the best thing is that it’s a usable
formula. Anyone seriously interested in copywriting
should discover Evaldo's secret.” —Bill Bonner,
Founder Agora Inc.

“It’s not often that I come upon a copywriting

strategy that feels new to me. And even less
frequently do I encounter one that is both new and
exciting. Evaldo Albuquerque’s “16 Word Sales
Letter™” is such a strategy. I’m going to
recommend this as a must-read to all my
copywriting proteges.” —Mark Ford, best-selling
author and chief growth strategist for Agora, Inc.

“Evaldo is the world’s greatest

copywriter you’ve never heard of. Why haven’t
you heard of him? Because while others are self-
promoting ... heck, while they’re eating, sleeping and
relaxing... he’s cranking out the next blockbuster. He
never stops. He’s a 9-figure sales machine and our
business’s secret weapon. This book is your blueprint
to how the machine dominates. Read it and put it
into action. Your royalty check will thank you.”
—Peter Coyne, founder of Paradigm Press, Agora
Financial’s largest imprint

“I'm recommending this book to everyone in

my company, and making it required reading for all
new hires. When it comes to books on "writing" I try
to read everything new, and no matter how many
books I pick up, I rarely find any ideas that are
innovative (or even useful), but this book
shattered my expectations—I found page
after page packed with fresh ideas. It's
engaging to read, and very easy to implement the
writing techniques.

“Evaldo has uncovered a new way to write

sales copy that is perfect for today's buyers; I really
love this book, and after you turn the first two pages,
you'll see exactly why. It’s a must-read primer
for anyone who writes sales copy…. Read this
book—and learn from one of the best.” —Oren
Klaff, best-selling author of Pitch Anything and Flip
the Script

“Few people know his name. Yet, those

at the highest levels of direct response
advertising consider Evaldo Albuquerque the
Michael Jordan of modern financial
copywriting. His new book, The 16 Word Sales
Letter™, reveals for the first time the secret to his
astonishing success. In split tests, the selling formula
Evaldo reveals in his book has won, repeatedly,
against ad copy written by the world’s top
copywriters. When asked at a recent seminar I gave
what are the two best books I’ve ever read on
copywriting, my answer was Breakthrough
Advertising by Eugene Schwartz and The 16 Word
Sales Letter™ by Evaldo Albuquerque.” —Caleb
O’Dowd, www.roitips.com

The 16-Word Sales Letter™

Foreword
The Power of Just
16 Little Words…

(and how those words can
change
your future, forever)

Can a short sentence change the history of the

world?

And more importantly, can those same words

change your fate… your destiny… your future?

To answer, we simply have to go back to a
steamy day in Houston, TX more than 50 years ago…

SETTING: RICE STADIUM, Houston, Texas,

81 degrees

DATE: September 12, 1962

CHARACTERS: John F. Kennedy, Jr… and

40,000 packed fans (many of whom, children.)

In front of a filled stadium Kennedy muttered

these now famous 10 words…

8

The 16-Word Sales Letter™

“We choose to go to the Moon in this

decade…”

10. Short. Words.

And America was changed, forever…

As you may remember from history class,
America was losing the race to space badly at the time.
The Soviets were dominating.

Kennedy knew he needed to persuade the

nation with his desire to “put a man on the moon.”

So he (and his speechwriters, no doubt) went to
work on his act of persuasion…  eventually coming up
with the 10 words you’ve just read.

Now, although the sentence was short, the
rhetoric packed in those 10 words whallowed the
trajectory of the nation.

John Jordan, author of "Kennedy's Romantic

Moon and Its Rhetorical Legacy for Space
Exploration" explains the three techniques Kennedy
used to move America to act…

"[Kennedy’s speech used] a
characterization of space as a beckoning
frontier; an articulation of time that locates
the endeavor within a historical moment of
urgency and plausibility; and a final,
cumulative strategy that invites audience
members to live up to their pioneering
heritage by going to the Moon."

Just over seven years later, Apollo 11 touched

down on the gray, sandy surface of the moon. Neil and

9

The 16-Word Sales Letter™

Buzz took their famous walk outside and planted the
American flag.

And now, think about how much space

technology touches your life everyday…

From Google Earth imagery of your house… to
the GPS you enjoy in your car… to listening to SIRIUS
satellite radio…

Would it all have been possible without

Kennedy’s 10 words?

Now, back to you… and the reason

you’re reading this book…
which surely ISN’T for a history lesson...

To transition to your story, I need to take you

to a wholly different, much colder setting...

SETTING: Agora Financial offices in

Baltimore, MD

DATE: February 1st, 2019

CHARACTERS: Me (Joe Schriefer) and the

author of this book (Evaldo)

And this story starts with a question. Or,

rather, a list of questions…

“How do you do it?” I asked Evaldo.

“Do what?,” he quipped back.

“How does a Brazilian man… whose native

language is Portuguese… crush every single
American copywriter that I’ve ever seen?”

10

The 16-Word Sales Letter™

To put the question in context, at Agora

Financial we eat, live and sleep copywriting. In my
part in helping to run the business I’ve personally
worked with more than 100+ copywriters…

… Many of which are the “A-list” copywriters

you’ve come to know…

And none of them… NONE of them… could

hold a proverbial candle to the year that Evaldo has
just had.

Just a decade before I met Evaldo he only knew

a basic few English words -- like “book,” “cat”, and
“table.”

Yet in 2018 alone he (somehow) managed to

bring in more than 100,000 front end customers AND
write more than $80,000,000 worth of backend sales
copy.

And to put those numbers in perspective…

They were more than 6 times more revenue I’d

ever seen ANYONE produce.

Said a different way, 600% more than any “A-

list” writer I’d ever worked with.

And Evaldo wasn’t even a native English

speaker!

I had to know his “secret…”

“C’mon, Evaldo, you’re doing something

differently than anyone I’ve ever met,” I started to
ask again. “Spill it… what’s the secret.”

11

The 16-Word Sales Letter™

“It all comes down to 16 simple words…” he

said in his (still thick) accent.

As we spent the rest of the day together, he

walked me through his secret “16-word sales letter™.”

It’s a strategy I’d never seen before in any of

the copywriting guru courses…

A totally brand new breakthrough that allows
you to tap into your customer’s core belief, persuade
that customer, and influence action.

Just like JFK muttered 10 words that put a

man on the moon, you, too, can use Evaldo’s 16 words
to alter your copywriting future… your financial
future… forever.

Read this book. Memorize these 16 words. Use

Evaldo’s system in your next sales letter.

Then, just weeks later…

Watch in amazement as these 16 words add

dollars to your bank account.

Best of all, it’s so simple to execute that

ANYONE can do it…

… Even a Brazilian man… who doesn’t speak
native English… Who invented a system that turned
himself into America’s #1 copywriter.

Sincerely,

Joe Schriefer

Introduction

"...Baby One More Time" (Britney Spears), "I

Kissed a Girl" (Katy Perry), "One More Night"
(Maroon 5), "Shake It Off" (Taylor Swift), "Can't Feel
My Face" (The Weeknd), "Can't Stop the Feeling!"
(Justin Timberlake).

What do all these songs have in common?

Two things. First, they all hit #1 on the
Billboard Hot 100 list. Second, believe it or not, they
were all written by the same man: Max Martin. This
guy has his hands in countless blockbuster pop songs
of the last two decades. With 22 number one singles in
the U.S., he’s catching up with John Lennon (26) and
Paul McCartney (32) as the most successful
songwriter in Billboard chart history.

What’s even more interesting is that, unlike

John Lennon and Paul McCartney, Max Martin writes
songs for a diverse range of artists, from the
Backstreet Boys to Rhianna to Bon Jovi. And English
isn’t his first language: he’s Swedish.

Some of his lyrics don’t even quite make sense.

And yet, it seems everything he touches turns into a
major hit. His songs just strike an emotional chord
with people and make them want to sing along.

What do all his songs have in common? First,

they have short unique intro, a kind of a pattern
interrupt. When you listen to his songs, you’ll
recognize it right off the bat.

13

The 16-Word Sales Letter™

Max explains that he “came from the DJ

world…. [T]o keep people on the floor, they had to
know what was the song right away.” A great example
of this is the opening to Britney Spears’s “…Baby One
More Time" with its immediately recognizable “DUN
DUN DUN.”

Second, all of Max’s songs hit the chorus within

a minute, and often much faster. Why? Because
today’s audience has a much shorter attention span
than audiences of the past. Max’s songs get to the
point fast, before people have a chance to switch the
station.

Third, his lyrics are written in very, very basic
English. Most are well below a fourth-grade reading
level. His songs also have simple harmonic structure,
mainly 3 to 4 chords.

And finally, they develop slowly, introducing
one new sound or instrument at a time. He doesn’t
overwhelm the listener with too much at the same
time. And he uses those different elements to create
tension and balance.

If you’re a copywriter like myself or work in

direct marketing, you can see some parallels between
what Max does with music and some basic principles
of copywriting. I’m sure there’s a lot more to his
formula for success.

After all, I’m no musician. I can’t play a single

instrument. But my point is, this guy has definitely
figured something out. As a copywriter, I’m intrigued.
Because at the end of the day, much like movies and
songs, sales letters also try to touch people on an
emotional level.

14

The 16-Word Sales Letter™

If Max Martin has figured out a formula for

success, could there also be a secret formula for sales
letters that would virtually guarantee success? That’s
the question I’ve been trying to answer for the past
few years. After years of studying copy that converts,
reading books on persuasion techniques, and most
important, writing many, many, many sales letters
that were total failures… I think I finally found it.

Before finding this formula, I was selling an

average of about $2-3 million a year. Nothing
spectacular. I was an average copywriter who had a
“hit ratio” of about 20%-40%. Meaning, for every five
sales letter I wrote, only one or two would work.

That meant I spent most of my time writing

bombs that made me no royalties. But I did gain
something that’s worth way more than a fat royalty
check. Those bombs helped me find the right
direction. They showed me what works. And what
doesn’t.

After so much trial and error, I developed a

simple formula… one so simple that it can be
explained in just 16 words. In theory, it made a lot of
sense to me. But I had no idea if it would work.

When I first used it in early 2017 in a video
sales letter I was working on, I wasn’t expecting much.

What happened next blew me away….

15

The 16-Word Sales Letter™

Chapter 1

The 16-Word Sales Letter™
that Sold $120+ Million in Two
Years

That VSL went live on July 2017. Within an

hour, sales started to pour in. And they haven’t
stopped yet, as I write this in 2019.

So far, that single piece of copy that followed
the formula has generated more than $30 million in
sales. After that blockbuster, I was hooked. Who
wouldn’t be?

All I have to do is follow this 16-word method
and I can sell millions? Count me in! I started using
this formula in every single project I wrote. As a
result, my copy has generated over $120 million in
just two years, from several different offers, different
products, and different ideas. The one constant was
this formula.

My “hit ratio” went from 20-30% to 60%-80%.

Now, before you assume I’m some sort of copy
genius, you should know that when I was 21 years old,
I knew only a few words in English, words like “book,”
“cat,” “dog,” and “table.” No joke. A decade ago I
didn’t even know what copywriting was. When I
started writing copy in 2013, I had zero training in

16

The 16-Word Sales Letter™

direct marketing—or any kind of marketing, for that
matter.

So if this works for me, I know it can work for

anyone.

Yes, even if you’re a complete newbie. How do I

know? Because as soon as I started mentoring other
copywriters and applying my method to their copy,
many of them went from zero to multi-million-dollar
sales, seemingly out of the blue. One guy (I’ll call him
Mike) wrote me to say:

“Before I worked with Evaldo, I knew squat

about copywriting. Nothing. I had made zero dollars
writing persuasive copy.

“Within five months, my very first sales letter
generated over $5 million in sales. I couldn't believe
it. I knew my life would never be the same.

“The copywriting strategies and concepts
Evaldo taught me have forever altered the direction of
my life and career, and ensured my future prosperity
as a professional copywriter.”

Another guy, I’ll call him Justin, says:

“Before I started working with Evaldo, I was
just a 23-year old college dropout with no prospects
and less than $200 to my name.

“Two years later, and I’m making 6-figures a

year, working when and where I want.

“While all the copywriting ‘gurus’ are at

seminars talking about hypothetical, theoretical
bullshit… Evaldo is sitting in the corner with his

17

The 16-Word Sales Letter™

laptop, writing tens of millions of dollars in winning
copy every single year.”

Brian (also an alias) also sent me a “thank you”

note, saying:

“It’s crazy to think… this year I’ll take home 10

times more money than I made last year. I paid off
$30k in student loans in one lump sum payment….
Now I’m looking for a new house to buy!

“Working with Evaldo is the closest thing to

guaranteeing a multi-million dollar promotion
EVERY TIME you put a campaign together.

“This might sound ridiculous… But if I had the

choice of ANY mentor in the history of copywriting
(Gary Halbert, Gene Schwartz, Gary Bencivenga)… I
would choose Evaldo Albuquerque. The results speak
for themselves… I’ve got $20mm+ in sales with a little
more than a year of copywriting experience.”

Yeah, I know… Brian has lost his mind for

comparing me to those copy legends. But holy shit...
Isn’t that amazing?

So What’s the Secret 16-Word Sales

Letter™?

Here it is:

“The secret to converting copy is to define the

one belief, then answer these ten questions.”

That’s it. I’ll make it even easier for you to

remember. Just four words: One belief. Ten
questions.

18

The 16-Word Sales Letter™

The one belief will not only help you judge the
strength of your idea. It will also set the tone of your
entire copy, the common thread that keeps everything
together.

The ten questions will add a ton of emotional

triggers to your copy. And since they’re sequential,
they will also help you organize your promo from lead
all the way to the closing.

The beauty here is that these questions never

change. Once you internalize them, writing a sales
letter will become automatic for you. Follow this
process, and staring at a blank page for hours not
knowing what to write next will become a thing of the
past.

You’ll also never get lost in the middle of the

project. I know that for newbie copywriters, that’s
probably one of the biggest challenges they face. I
know because I’ve been there. It’s easy to get lost in
the woods when you don’t have a map pointing you in
the right direction.

Imagine how much easier writing copy will
become once you know exactly what to write, even
before you type your first word. Your productivity will
skyrocket. You know that means for you?

If you own a business, once you share this with

your copywriters, you’ll have no shortage of sales
letters. This could help explode your business. If
you’re a copywriter like myself, it means more
royalties! And more time to do whatever the heck you
want!

19

The 16-Word Sales Letter™

I’m telling you this because that’s exactly what
happened to me. I used to write one full package every
two months, which is average. After implementing
this method, I was writing one new sales letter a
month.

That’s right. My productivity doubled. Using
this method, I’ve written full packages in as little as
two weeks… including a crypto offer that went on to
bring in 100,000+ new paid names (before it “broke
the Internet” and got banned on Google and other
networks).

People around the office in Agora started

asking me “how the hell do you crank out so much
copy?” Some people thought I must be working 20
hours a day. But the truth is, I wasn’t working harder.
I was just working smarter.

So how does it work?

It all begins with the one belief.

20

The 16-Word Sales Letter™

Chapter 2

Your Mission: Make the
Reader Believe in the One
Belief

Before the 1980s, military plans used to be

extremely robust, including every single detail
imaginable. What each unit will do. What equipment
they’ll use. How they’ll replace ammunition. And so
on.

There was just one problem. The plans often

became useless a few minutes into battle. As Mike
Tyson has said, “Everyone has a plan, until they get
punched in the mouth.”

As you can imagine, a lot of unpredictable

things happen in the battlefield. And when they do,
everything you planned becomes useless.

After so many failed missions, the U.S. Army

adapted its strategy and invented a concept called
Commander’s Intent (CI). It appears on top of every
order specifying the desired end state of the operation
(the goal).

Instead of being a play-by-play instruction

manual, the CI provides only the desired destination.
It gives everyone on the team the flexibility they need
to react to unpredictable events. As Jocko Willink and

21

The 16-Word Sales Letter™

Leif Babin write in their excellent book Extreme
Ownership, about Navy SEAL leadership:

“While a simple statement, the Commander’s

Intent is actually the most important part of the brief.
When understood by everyone involved in the
execution of the plan, it guides each decision and
action on the ground.”

When you write a sales letter, you also must

have a Commander’s Intent. And that’s exactly what
“the one belief” is. It describes the ultimate goal of the
sales letter.

When most people write copy, they don’t have

a mission. But how are you supposed to write copy
that converts if you don’t know the ultimate goal of
the letter? How are you supposed to succeed if you
don’t know what you’re trying to accomplish?

It’s impossible. And it’s a big reason why a lot

of copywriters fail. It’s a big reason why I’ve failed
many times.

With the one belief, you will know what your
mission is. It’s your North Star, guiding you all the
way to a high-converting sales letter.

Officers arrive at the Commander’s Intent by
asking themselves the question “What is the single
most important thing we must do during the
mission?” And that’s how we arrive at the one belief.

The single most important thing you can do
when you write a sales letter is to make the reader
believe that:

22

The 16-Word Sales Letter™

This new opportunity is the key to their

desire and it’s only attainable through my new
mechanism.

That’s your mission. Write it down.

I learned this concept from Russel Brunson,

who said: “If I can get someone to TRULY believe that
the new opportunity is the key to what they want the
most, and they can only get it through my vehicle,
then they have no other options but to buy.”

While Russel was talking about launching your

business online, this concept can easily be applied to
every single sales letter you write. It’s a critical part of
my formula.

The one belief will force you to find the core of

your idea. It will force you to get rid of superfluous
stuff and less important insights. As a result, you’ll
focus on the one idea that will drive your sales letter.

As you can see, you can break the one belief

down into three main elements: the new opportunity,
your prospect’s desire, and the new mechanism. Let’s
dig deeper into each one.

The New Opportunity

Remember when I said the one belief will help

you judge the strength of your idea? If you can’t
identify the new opportunity, then your idea isn’t
unique. And that means it’s not even worth testing.

For example, “eating healthy and exercising”

cannot be your new opportunity. Neither can

23

The 16-Word Sales Letter™

“investing in the stock market.” There’s nothing
unique about those ideas.

The new opportunity is what makes your idea
unique, your unique selling proposition (USP). If you
don’t have one, your idea is worthless, as I’ll prove to
you in the next chapter.

But here’s the thing. If your idea is truly

unique, then your prospect will have no idea they
need it, right? That’s why it’s not enough just to have
something that’s new.

In the sales letter, we also need to show why

they need it. That’s where their desires come in. They
must believe that the new opportunity you’re
presenting is the key to their desire.

If they don’t believe that, your new opportunity
won’t touch them on an emotional level. And it will be
extremely hard for you to persuade your prospect.

Your Prospect Desire

The main thing here is to remember that your
new opportunity can be the key to their desire only if
it provides benefits. It can be the key to their desire
only if it will help your prospect feel more significant,
respected, and valued. If it can help increase your
prospect’s mental, physical, social, emotional, sexual,
or financial well-being. Or if it can decrease or
eliminate the risk of events that will negatively impact
your prospect’s mental, physical, social, emotional,
sexual, or financial well-being.

For the health niche, the desire could be to lose

weight, lower your blood pressure, build muscle, etc.

24

The 16-Word Sales Letter™

For the biz op space, it could be to work from home,
quit your job, etc. And for the financial space, where I
operate, it could be safety in retirement or taking care
of family.

The New Mechanism

Once your readers believe your new

opportunity is the key to their desire, now they must
believe you’re the only one who can meet that need.
You have to make them believe that ONLY your new
mechanism can help them.

Having a new mechanism is key in today’s
competitive market environment. No matter what
niche you operate in, chances are your prospects have
seen everything. Remember the wise words of Eugene
Schwartz:

“If your market is at the stage where they’ve

heard all the claims, in all their extremes, then mere
repetition or exaggeration won’t work any longer.
What this market needs now is a new device… a new
mechanism, a new way to make the old promise work.
A fresh chance, a brand-new possibility of success
where only disappointment has resulted before.”

While the new opportunity reveals WHAT is

unique about your solution, the new mechanism
reveals HOW it works. It’s the vehicle that deliver the
new opportunity. It’s the secret sauce that explains
why your solution works.

In the financial niche, it could be the
proprietary algorithm behind the strategy/trading
system you’re selling.

25

The 16-Word Sales Letter™

In the biz op space, it could be a mentorship

program about a new type of online business.

In the health niche, it could be a unique
combination of natural herbs in just one pill, which is
very common in supplement offers.

Once you know your new opportunity, your

customer’s desire, and your new mechanism, you’re
ready to write down your one belief.

Here are a Few Examples of “The

One Belief”

The one belief for P-90X:

Avoiding the plateau effect (new opportunity)

is the key to building muscle (desire) and it’s
attainable only through the P90-X “muscle confusion”
system (new mechanism).

The one belief for Jeff Walker’s Product

Launch Formula:

Warming up your prospects (new opportunity)

is the key to successfully launching a new product
online (desire) and it’s attainable only through the
Jeff Walker’s Product Launch Formula (new
mechanism).

The one belief for Proactive:

Attacking acne at every stage of the cycle (new
opportunity) is the key to keeping your skin clear and
healthy-looking (desire) and it’s attainable only
through Proactiv’s Combination Therapy® (new
mechanism).

26

The 16-Word Sales Letter™

The one belief for Invisalign:

Aligning your teeth without ugly braces (new
opportunity) is the key to getting the smile you want
without disrupting your life (desire) and it’s attainable
only through the Invisalign proprietary technology
(new mechanism).

The one belief for Subway (before Jared got

arrested for child pornography):

Eating healthy fast food (new opportunity) is

the key to losing weight (desire) and it’s attainable
only through a diet based on Subway sandwiches (new
mechanism).

The one belief for water pitcher Turapur:

Drinking ionized water (new opportunity) is

the key to feeling young and energetic (desire) and it’s
attainable only through Turapur Pitcher’s unique
filtering system (new mechanism).

The one belief for Febreze:

Adding a pleasant smell at the end of your
cleaning routine (new opportunity) is the key to
keeping your home looking fresh and clean (desire)
and it’s attainable only through Febreze’s OdorClear
technology (new mechanism.)

The one belief for three different financial

offers I wrote:

Getting in the trade before the news is

published (new opportunity) is the key to making easy
money every week (desire) and it’s attainable only

27

The 16-Word Sales Letter™

through the patent-pending Weekly Paycheck
Indicator (new mechanism).

Trading penny stocks on Friday (new
opportunity) is the key to making easy money every
weekend (desire) and it’s attainable only through Tim
Sykes’s proprietary news screen system (new
mechanism).

Investing in private companies before they go

public (new opportunity) is the key to making the
biggest gains in the stock market (desire) and it’s
attainable only through the secret IPO account I
uncovered (new mechanism).

And here’s the one belief for my copy method:

Following a copy system that provides clarity,

purpose, and structure (new opportunity) is the key to
writing converting copy in no time (desire) and it’s
attainable only through the 16-word sales letter™
(new mechanism).

I could go on and on. But the truth of the
matter is you could write the one belief for every
single successful marketing campaign throughout
history.

So what’s the one belief for the project you’re

working on?

Once you write that down, you can move on to

the ten sequential questions. They’ll structure the
promo for you, making your job way easier.

Chapter 3

Injecting Dopamine into Your
Prospect’s Brain with Question
#1

He was a very quiet kid. He hardly spoke at all

until he was three years old. In fact, his parents
worried there was something wrong with him.

When he was five years old, his parents gave

him a magnetic compass. And that changed
everything.

He was fascinated by the fact that no matter

which way he turned the compass, the needle always
pointed the same direction. That new toy made him
wonder about magnetic fields, which got him
interested in physics.

That’s how his lifetime journey of exploration

started. Many years later, he wrote about the
compass, saying: “That experience made a deep and
lasting impression on me. Something deeper had to be
hidden behind things.”

The name of the kid? Albert Einstein. Most of
us are not geniuses like he was. But we all have that
same capacity to be curious about something new. We
love novelty.

29

The 16-Word Sales Letter™

And that’s why the first question you must

answer is this:

Question #1: How is this different from

everything else I’ve seen?

You must begin by explaining what the new

opportunity is. As I mentioned in the last chapter, if
your idea is not unique, it’s useless.

Why? Because it will not active dopamine
pathways in your prospect’s brains. Without the
release of dopamine, your customer will just ignore
your message.

Cognitive neuroscientists Nico Bunzeck and

Emrah Düzel used MRI images to study how the brain
reacts to novelty. They found that there’s a region of
our midbrain called the substantia nigra or ventral
segmental area that “lights up” when we see new stuff.

This “novelty center” of our brain is activated

only when we come across something completely new.
If it’s something familiar, it stays dormant.

Here’s how Bunzeck and Düzel explain it:

“When we see something new, we see it has a

potential for rewarding us in some way. This potential
that lies in new things motivates us to explore our
environment for rewards. The brain learns that the
stimulus, once familiar, has no reward associated with
it and so it loses its potential.

“For this reason, only completely new objects
activate the midbrain area and increase our levels of
dopamine.”

30

The 16-Word Sales Letter™

Our Brains are Wired for Novelty

If you think about it, that makes perfect sense
from an evolutionary point of view. It was exploring
new things that led humans to spread around the
world. It’s how we were able to adapt to all sorts of
different environments.

That happened because we evolved from acting

on raw instinct alone to identifying new things and
learning about them. The fact that our brains release
dopamine when we come across novelty probably
gave us a great evolutionary advantage.

My buddy Oren Klaff talks about this in his

great book Pitch Anything. He says: “Attention will be
given when information novelty is high and will drift
away when information novelty is low.”

He goes on to explain how humans survived in

the African Savanna by detecting change:

“The only way to survive from one day to the

next is detecting change, because trees were not
threatening, grass was not threatening, clouds were
not threatening unless they moved.

“Things that moved were threatening to our

survival and we dedicated most of the 60% to 80% of
our brain matter to detecting change. So if you don’t
characterize things in terms of change, the physical
nature of our brain isn’t attracted to it.”

Here's the bottom line. Only novelty will
release the right dose of dopamine that will get your
customer into “exploring” mode—that will get them

31

The 16-Word Sales Letter™

excited enough to keep reading a sales letter to find
out more about that “new” thing.

That’s how our brains are wired. Nobody can

change that. If you ignore that fact, you’ll never
succeed in copy.

That’s why your USP should always be in your
headline and at the beginning of your sales letter. The
new opportunity needs to feel like a breakthrough. It
needs to feel like you just figured something out, and
you’re revealing what you discovered to the reader.

It could be a new cure, a new way of losing

weight, a new way of making money, a new business
model, etc.

In the financial niche, I’ve written about a new
law, a new loophole, a new threat, a new prediction, a
new discovery, a new conspiracy, a new political
scandal, a new trading system, etc.

Here’s how I started the first sales letter I wrote

using this method (the one that has sold more than
$30 mil):

“Hi, I’m Alan Knuckman.

I’ll introduce myself fully in just a

moment.

But right now I want you to look at this

piece of paper I’m holding in my hand.

It’s patent application # D0365193.

32

The 16-Word Sales Letter™

It was filed with U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office to protect the invention of a
powerful NEW market indicator…

The ONLY indicator in the world that
can tip you off about impending big market
news…

BEFORE the news becomes public.”

Notice how I begin the letter by explaining why

this is different from everything else they’ve seen in
the past. It has to be truly unique. Once you answer
that question, your prospect’s brain will be filled with
dopamine.

Now you can move on to the next question….

33

The 16-Word Sales Letter™

Chapter 4

The Man Who Helped Ending
World War I with Toilet Paper

At the end of 1914, the British came up with a

new plan to defeat Germany: starve the German
people into submission through a blockade strategy.

By 1917, only Sweden and a handful of other

minor sources on the European continent were selling
goods to Germany.

As a result, German soldiers at the front lines

weren’t getting the food, clothing, and equipment they
needed. Hundreds of thousands of German soldiers
didn’t have boots, socks, or jackets.

That’s when the Allies employed Harry

Reichenbach, at that time the greatest American
advertiser in history. His mission was to figure out a
way to persuade German soldiers to surrender.

How do you persuade someone to become a

prisoner of war?

After interviewing hundreds of German
soldiers in prison camps, Reichenbach made a list of
what their biggest desires were. He then wrote a short
sales letter based on those big “pain points.”

Their direct mail strategy was to drop 45

million of those letters over Germany’s lines. The

34

The 16-Word Sales Letter™

result? German soldiers started surrendering in
masses. So much so that it became a capital offense to
pick up any pieces of paper on the ground.

Here’s what that sales letter offered:

If they surrendered, all German prisoners
would be given officer rank. As “prisoners with officer
rank,” every day they would get bread and meat to eat,
cigarettes to smoke, a comb, and 24 sheets of toilet
paper (German soldiers had none in the trenches).

This letter worked because it immediately

answered the question “what’s in it for me?”

And that’s our next question in the process.

Question #2: What’s in it for me?

My two boys never seem to listen to me when I
try telling them what to do. If you have kids, I’m sure
you can relate to that. But there’s one little trick that
never seem to fail.

If I frame my request with “what’s in it for

them,” they will listen to me. Something as simple as
“go finish your homework because as soon as you’re
done, we can go to the park and play soccer” always
works.

In the classic book How to Win Friends and
Influence People, pretty much all of Dale Carnegie’s
secrets are about focusing on the other person. Want
to make people like you? Become genuinely interested
in them and talk in terms of their interests.

Use their name because to that person it’s the
sweetest and most important sound in any language.

35

The 16-Word Sales Letter™

Encourage them to talk about themselves. Make them
feel important.

Do any of these influence secrets mention
yourself? No. It’s all about the other person. And your
sales letter should be, too, especially at the beginning.
That’s why the most important word in any sales letter
is “You.”

Dale Carnegie talks explicitly about how we’re

all interested in what we want. For that reason, the
only way to influence other people is to talk about
what they want.

It seems like such an obvious statement. But

I’ve lost count of how many sales letters I’ve read that
don’t answer that question within seconds. They go on
and on talking about other stuff, and by the time they
answer “what’s in it for me?”, the reader has given up
reading the letter a long time ago.

Never forget: people don’t have to read

your shit.

It’s not like they’re sitting at home just waiting

for you to send them your offer. It’s the opposite.

You’re most likely disrupting their day. A lot of
people are probably reading your stuff on their phone.
And that trend will only accelerate in the coming
years.

For that reason, they’re looking for a reason

NOT to read your letter or watch your VSL. If you
don’t answer this question within seconds, you’re
giving them that reason. They’ll leave your page and
go back to whatever they were doing before.

36

The 16-Word Sales Letter™

So put yourself in your customer’s shoes and

ask yourself “what promise can I make here at the
beginning of my letter that will get my customer
salivating?”

The big promise must be tied to your

customer’s key desires.

In the health space, it could be “lose up to 20

pounds a month eating nothing but donuts and pizza.”

In the biz op space it could be “make $10,000 a
month online without having to build a website, hire a
copywriter, or even develop a product.”

And here’s a section of one of my sales letters
with the big promise: “I call it the “weekly paycheck
indicator” because it gives you the chance to collect a
BIG Paycheck of $10,200 or more… Every. Single.
Week.”

Make that big promise in the first page of your

letter. Because that will probably be the only chance
you’ll have to make an emotional impact.

We’ve all heard about the study showing that

people today have attention spans shorter than a
goldfish’s and that we lose focus after eight seconds. I
don’t know how accurate that number is. But the
undeniable truth is that our attention span or patience
for irrelevant details is lower than ever.

That’s because we’re bombarded every day with

so much information that we must ignore most of it
and focus only on what matters to us. And we tend to
do that very, very quickly.

37

The 16-Word Sales Letter™

And that’s why it’s important to answer the
question very quickly. In my sales letters, I like to
answer both questions #1 and #2 in the first page.

Once you tell your customer how your idea is

unique and the big promise it can deliver, you’ve
piqued their interest.

Now you just have to prove you’re not full of

shit.

And that bring us to the next question….

38

The 16-Word Sales Letter™

Chapter 5

In a World Full of Bullshit,
Proof is King

Check out this ad for a 1995 Pontiac found on
Craigslist. “Never in your life has a car made you so
appealing to the opposite sex.” WOW. The landscape
is so competitive these days that the only way you can
grab someone’s attention is by having a ridiculous
promise like this one.

For example, in the competitive financial niche,

the promises have become more and more ridiculous
in the last few years. Doubling your money in one year
used to be a good promise.

39

The 16-Word Sales Letter™

Now you have to promise doubling your money
every day to stand out. Everything needs to be bigger,
faster, easier… or you’ll have no chance of competing
with all the other aggressive promises out there.

Eugene Schwartz talks about this trend of one-

upmanship in Breakthrough Advertising:

“If a competitor has just introduced a new

mechanism to achieve the same claim as that
performed by your product, and that new mechanism
announcement is producing sales, then you counter in
this way. Simply elaborate or enlarge upon the
successful mechanism. Make it easier, quicker, surer;
allow it to solve more of the problem: overcome old
limitations; promise extra benefits.”

The problem with this race is that eventually

we all hit a point where our promises are
unbelievable. And that’s why, if you’re operating in a
competitive market—and these days everyone is—you
must follow the first two questions with some proof
that supports your one belief. That’s why the third
question in our method is…

Question #3: How do I know this is

real?

If you’ve done your job right on the previous

two questions, your prospect will be pretty skeptical at
this point. If you don’t show some proof that you can
deliver on your promise, they might leave your page.
They’ll want to believe you because you’ve made such
a good promise. But they’ll be skeptical anyway.

So you’ll want to show some initial proof, such
as historical charts, testimonials, third party quotes,

40

The 16-Word Sales Letter™

etc. I’m not going to get into the different types of
proofs. There are plenty of other copywriting courses
and books that talk about them.

Here’s what’s really important: whatever proof

you end up using, you should wrap it up in an ABT
structure.

What’s an ABT structure? It’s a simple story-

telling format.

A lot of copywriters show proof and more

proof and more proof, but they never create a story
around those proof elements. Therefore, their sales
letters become boring to read and fail to convert
prospects into customers.

And there you have it. I just used the ABT

structure, which stands for “And” “But” “Therefore.”

In the book Houston, We Have a Narrative:
Why Science Needs Story, author Randy Olson talks
about how this ABT idea came from Trey Parker, co-
creator of South Park.

In a documentary about the show, Parker has
explained how he edits the scripts: “I sort of always
call it the rule of replacing “and” with either “but” or
“therefore”... this happens, THEREFORE this
happens, BUT this happens.”

Isn’t that brilliant? So simple, and so brilliant.

If you think about it, these three little words

are the basic building blocks of any narrative.

“And” helps set up the background and give

momentum to the story. “But” creates conflict, adding

41

The 16-Word Sales Letter™

the tension any good story needs. And “therefore”
gives the story a conclusion.

No wonder Hollywood screenwriters often
follow that format when writing their logline maker, a
short description of the concept.

Here’s an example of a logline: A young man

meets a crazy scientist and travels to the past in a time
machine and meets his future parents. But he
accidently distracts his mother from noticing and
falling in love with his father. Therefore, he is forced
to bring them together or he will cease to exist.

Notice that whatever follows after “but” is what
really makes the story good. It’s all about the tension.

This ABT format is effective because we are
hardwired for storytelling. Just like our brains are
wired to pay attention to new things, they’re also
wired to receive information in the ABT format.

A Copy Lesson from Rokia

In 2004, researchers at Carnegie Mellon

University conducted a study to see what sorts of
messaging compelled people to donate to a charity
called Save the Children.

Half the study participants were given the story

of Rokia, a little girl in Mali growing up in extreme
poverty. She often goes days without food, and her
family can’t afford basic needs such as healthcare and
education.

The other half of the participants were given a

letter with all the facts and statistics on poverty in

42

The 16-Word Sales Letter™

Africa. Those who saw Rokia’s story donated an
average of $2.38. Those who saw the facts donated an
average of $1.14.

But here’s the interesting part. They ran the

study again, but this time they gave one group both,
the story and the facts. They expected that having all
the information would boost donations.

But they were wrong. The people in that group
donated an average of $1.43, still lower than the story
alone. Why did that happen?

As Chip and Dan Heath explain in Made to

Stick, Why Some Ideas Survive and Others Die: “The
researchers theorized that thinking about statistics
shifts people into a more analytical frame of mind.
When people think analytically, they're less like to
think emotionally.”

Isn’t that fascinating? Give people only facts,

and they’ll think analytically.

If you’re writing a sales letter, that’s the last
thing you want. That’s why it’s important when you
answer question #3 to use storytelling.

This ABT story format will get your reader to

act emotionally, which is exactly what you want.

For example, in the financial niche you can
turn even a boring chart with an indicator into an ABT
format story with something like this:

“The company had ‘sell’ ratings… and earnings

were declining…. Most people thought the company

43

The 16-Word Sales Letter™

was going bankrupt…. No wonder shares were
tanking, as you can see in the chart.

But then out of the blue my indicator flashed a

buy signal, indicating shares were about to explode
higher. At first nothing happened. I thought the
indicator had failed.

But as soon as the market opened the next day,

boom, shares exploded higher. So (therefore) had
you placed a simple trade, you could have made a
quick $9,500 that day.”

Here’s another example from another sales

letter I wrote. Notice two important things. First, I’m
revealing some proof this is a real opportunity right
on the first page, without revealing what the secret is.

Second, notice how I wrapped all the third-
party quotes in an ABT format, which helped add
some tension to the lead.

“There’s a lot of money at stake….

As Forbes says, those who know how to

take advantage of this provision ‘may be on
course for a multimillion-dollar tax break.’

Ed Kleinbard, a former chief of staff of

Congress’s Joint Committee on Taxation, called
this provision a ‘complete giveaway.’

And Bloomberg called it ‘a multimillion-

dollar windfall.’

44

The 16-Word Sales Letter™

I call this opportunity ‘Congressional

Checks’…

Because while 99.9% of everyday

Americans are in the dark…

A handful of congressmen have already been
collecting this easy cash.

The media is NOT reporting on this

shocking scandal…

But I’ll show you the truth in the next

two minutes…

I’ll even show you the documents they

filed with the clerk of the House of
Representatives…

Documents that PROVE they’re
collecting Congressional Checks of $115,000…
$350,000… and even $2 million.

In fact, the International Business
Times reviewed the most recent personal
financial disclosure records of 44 lawmakers in
the House and Senate.

And they’ve confirmed congressmen
have collected up to ‘$16 million of annual
income from those [Congressional Checks].’

Does that seem fair to you?

45

The 16-Word Sales Letter™

While these politicians are collecting

millions of dollars…

Most hardworking taxpayers like you
don’t even know about this little-known tax
provision…

And they’re missing out on what CNBC

called ‘a tax windfall’…

Simply because this provision was
buried in more than 500 pages of new tax
rules.”

If you’re writing sales letters in the health
space, instead of just citing scientific results, try to tell
the story of the scientific discovery.

Here’s an example from a successful health
promotion written by Paul Amos, one of the best in
the business:

“In the 1930s and 1940s, Dr.
Warburg’s experiments on cellular
respiration… the way our cells use oxygen
for energy… revealed
something ASTONISHING.

In order to survive, cancer cells

function in a way completely unlike that of
regular cells.

They actually use a different cellular

‘fuel’ than healthy cells normally use…

46

The 16-Word Sales Letter™

And if you simply ‘shut off’ this fuel

supply, cancer cells die.

But because regular cells don’t have

to use this ‘fuel’… they aren’t affected at all.

The cancer cells die… almost
immediately… and regular cells continue to
stay healthy.”

Can you see how this is way more effective than

just citing a boring scientific paper? A narrative is
always much more engaging than simply listing data,
facts, and findings.

Here’s a different way of thinking about this.

Imagine you’re talking to your prospect through a
two-way radio. Your prospect is always on the
storytelling channel. If you’re just citing facts, he
won’t get your message. You must be on the same
channel.

Remember, your mission is to make the reader

believe in the one belief. So the entire purpose of
presenting proof in an ABT format is to help make
your customer believe. Once you have some proof, you
can move to the next question…

And that’s where the magic really happens!

47

The 16-Word Sales Letter™

Chapter 6

It’s Time to Reveal the REAL
Problem with Question #4

Imagine trying to sell a product in the healthy

diet space with the following copy:

“If you’re struggling to lose weight, it’s
probably because your diet is based on bagels, donuts,
and pizza… and you never go to the gym.”

Or imagine trying to sell a financial newsletter

with this:

“If you haven’t saved enough for retirement, it’s

probably because you’re bad with money and didn’t
start saving early enough.”

Or this one in the biz op space:

“If you haven’t launched your own online
business, it’s probably because you’re afraid of failing
and not really the entrepreneur type.”

Think any of these pieces of copy would have

any chance of success? Hell no. That’s not what people
want to hear.

In general, people don’t want to take
responsibility for their failures. If you want to sell
more, you need to justify their failures.

48

The 16-Word Sales Letter™

As Blair Warren wrote in The One Sentence

Persuasion Course (my favorite copywriting book of
all time):

“While millions cheer Dr. Phil as he tells people

to accept responsibility for their mistakes, millions
more are looking for someone to take the
responsibility off their shoulders. To tell them
that they are not responsible for their lot in life.

“And while accepting responsibility is essential

for gaining control of one’s own life, assuring others
they are not responsible is essential for gaining
influence over theirs.”

And that’s why the next question you must

answer is…

Question #4: What’s holding me

back?

The purpose of this question is to justify your
prospect failure by revealing the REAL PROBLEM.

When your prospects hit the sales page, many

of them have already tried numerous similar
products.

In the financial niche, maybe they’ve tried

several different investment strategies.

In the health niche, maybe they’ve tried

multiple weight loss products or plans.

Most of those probably didn’t work for them.

Maybe they’ve lost money with other financial

49

The 16-Word Sales Letter™

newsletters. Or maybe they’ve tried a supplement or a
workout plan and didn’t lose any weight.

Whatever the situation, it’s important to realize

they’ve probably tried something similar in the past.

We need to justify their failure by showing

them the REAL reason why those strategies or
products they’ve tried in the past have not worked.

And here’s where the simplicity of this copy

method comes in. In order to find the real problem, all
you need to do is reverse-engineer your answer to
question #1.

I know this may sound confusing. Let me walk

you through a real example using one of my sales
letters.

This particular promo was selling a financial

indicator that could help you get in a trade before
market-moving news was published. The answer to
question #1 (How is this unique?) for that sales letter
was this:

It’s the only indicator in the world that helps
you get in the trade BEFORE the news is published.

Now, here’s question #4: What’s holding me

back?

Answer: The real problem is that you’re getting
in the trade AFTER the news is published. By the time
you get in it’s already too late and the big gains have
already been made.

See how simple this can be? It’s simple, but

very powerful. You’re telling your customers the

50

The 16-Word Sales Letter™

reason why they failed in the past is that all the
solutions they tried never addressed the REAL
problem. But now there’s finally a NEW
OPPORTUNITY, a new solution that addresses the
real problem.

It’s All About Giving Your Prospect

Hope

Your prospects will think this could finally be

what they’ve been looking for. This won’t fail like
everything else they’ve tried in the past.

You’re essentially giving them hope. And isn’t

that what we’re all really selling?

That’s why I said before that this is where the
magic happens. Without hope, your prospect will not
buy. And the good news is that you can use this in any
niche.

In fact, this is very common in the health space,
where you’ll see things like “if you’re working out and
eating healthy, but you’re still struggling to lose
weight… it’s not your fault. It’s because your
testosterone levels are low/ your thyroid isn’t
working/ you have bad bacteria in your gut, [insert
the real problem here]….”

You’re revealing the real problem, a problem
that can be solved only by your new mechanism. Of
course, all this needs to be based on solid logic and
backed up by facts.

Here’s how I did it in that financial offer I

mentioned before:

51

The 16-Word Sales Letter™

“If you’ve lost money with other
indicators or trading systems in the past… it’s
NOT your fault.

That’s because all other systems on
earth that I’m aware of are based on price data.

They only trigger a ‘buy’ signal when the

price changes... AFTER the big moves.

By the time you get in, it’s already too

late.

The breakthrough indicator you’re about

to see is totally different….

It’s a brand new way of making money.

It’s all about getting AHEAD of everyone

else…

And collecting a BIG paycheck when the

information finally becomes public.

That’s why it’s protected by U.S. Patent

Application # D0365193.”

See how I took the blame of their failures off
their shoulders and put it onto the old opportunities
they tried?

That’s how you plant the seeds of hope in your

prospects’ minds. You’re starting to tell them,
indirectly, that they’ve failed because they didn’t have
what you’re offering.

52

The 16-Word Sales Letter™

And FINALLY you’re giving them the

opportunity to replace what’s not working with
something better: your new mechanism.

At this point your prospects will begin to

believe that your new mechanism is the only thing
that can help them achieve what they desire (a key
part of the one belief).

You’ve justified your prospects’ failures and

given them hope. Now we’re going to inject even more
emotion into your sales letter by leveraging your
prospects’ tribal instincts.

53

The 16-Word Sales Letter™

Chapter 7

It’s Time to Play the “Us vs.
Them” Card with Question #5

“The end of Earth is near. You need to leave the
planet now by boarding a spaceship that’s trailing the
Hale-Bopp Comet. But in order to enter that
spaceship, you must abandon your human body.

All you need to do is eat this apple sauce mixed

with lethal doses of phenobarbital. But don’t worry.
An unidentified flying object (UFO) will take your soul
to another level of existence above human.”

What would you do if I told you that? Probably

put me in a straitjacket, right?

But in 1997, 38 people believed every word of
that and followed those directions, in a mass suicide
by the Heaven's Gate cult.

As a copywriter, I find this very interesting. I’m

just trying to persuade people to give me their credit
card number. And here you have a cult leader who
convinced 38 people that committing suicide would
enable them to enter a spaceship flying in the wake of
a comet.

Don’t you want to know his persuasive secrets?

Well, one of the secrets of this cult (and every
cult) is that cult leaders make their members feel like

54

The 16-Word Sales Letter™

they’re part of a special group. They isolate members
from friends and family by convincing them that those
outside the cult just don’t get it.

That’s why Scientology (yes, it’s a cult!)
advocates something they call “disconnection” as key
to their members’ spiritual growth. What is
disconnection? It’s basically cutting all ties to anyone
who criticizes scientology, including family and
friends.

But this type of group dynamic doesn’t happen

only in cults. Our brains are wired to be tribal.
According to psychological studies, any group of
humans will sort themselves into us/them groups
within seconds, and for almost any reason.

One study has shown that a 50-millisecond
exposure to the face of someone of another race is
enough to activate the amygdala. Another study has
shown that fans at a soccer match are more likely to
aid an injured spectator if he’s wearing the home team
jersey.

My favorite is a study showing how this
happens at the subconscious level, proving that “us vs.
them” happens automatically.

This study involved morning commuters at a

train station in a predominantly white neighborhood.
They filled out questionnaires about their political
views. Then at half the stations, a pair of Mexicans
began to appear each morning chatting quietly in
Spanish before boarding the train.

After two weeks, commuters filled out a second
questionnaire. The presence of the Mexicans speaking

55

The 16-Word Sales Letter™

Spanish made people more supportive of decreasing
LEGAL immigration from Mexico and making English
the official language. Fascinating, right?

If you think about it from the point of view of

evolution, it makes a lot of sense. Our caveman
ancestors survived only by being part of a group. The
group provided comfort and protection against rival
groups and the challenging environment.

Nobody is immune to this need to be part of a

group.

There are many ways to make people feel like
they’re part of a group. But having a common enemy
is one of the most powerful ways.

That’s why the “us vs. them” card is so
powerful. We’ve seen its power throughout history in
some of the most memorable conflicts.

Conquistadors vs. Natives in the 16th century.

Christians vs. Muslims during the Crusades.

American Colonies vs. the British Empire

during the American Revolution.

North vs. South during the American Civil War.

Nazi Germans vs. Jews before and during

WWII.

Capitalism vs. socialism during the Cold War.

Jihadists vs. “Infidels” in acts of terrorism that

continue through today.

The 16-Word Sales Letter™

Back in 2001, I personally experienced this “us

vs. them” mentality. In the immediate aftermath of
the 9/11 attacks, America came together. The nation
was united as one. Stores ran out of flags, millions
donated blood, thousands enlisted.

At the time, I was an international student

trying to learn English in Nebraska. The day after the
attack, I was in one my classes when a discussion
about immigration began. One of the students
proclaimed: “Why do we even allow these
international students here? We should just kick them
out.”

At that time, I couldn’t comprehend why

anyone would say something dumb like that,
especially a college student. But now I know he was
just putting me in the “them” bucket. If I wasn’t an
American, I must have been one of “them.”

That comment wasn’t coming from his frontal

cortex. It was coming from his reptilian brain. I’m
sure you’ve experienced us vs. them too. We all have.
We see it in our day-to-day lives… your favorite team
vs. the other teams, Democrats vs. Republicans, dog
lovers vs. cat lovers, etc.

Science shows that having a common enemy
releases oxytocin, increasing the sense of belonging.
And guess what? If you make your prospects feel like
part of a group, they’ll be more inclined to buy your
product. No wonder some of the most successful ads
set someone or something up as a common enemy.

Just look at what most critics rank as one of the
best ads of all time, the iconic 1984 ad for Apple’s first
Macintosh. In that ad, PC users are portrayed as gray,

57

The 16-Word Sales Letter™

mindless drones blindly taking direction from a Big
Brother-like character.

Then enters a young, fit, and attractive woman

(representing Apple) who is heroic enough to smash
the giant screen. Or how about the more recent ads
featured the PC guy (wearing a suit and looking like a
nerd) and the “Mac,” looking cool and competent?

That’s how Apple created an enemy, the PC and

its users. And they built that common enemy into
much of their marketing. No wonder Apple has
created an obsessive brand loyalty.

The bottom line is that having a common
enemy will do wonders for your sales letter. And that’s
why it’s the next step in the process.

In the previous question, we revealed the real
reason why your prospect has failed so far. Now it’s
time to blame someone or something for that. And we
do that by answering the following question…

Question #5: Who/What is to

Blame?

In order to find an effective enemy, you must
understand your prospect. Instead of trying to create
an enemy out of the blue, you must leverage existing
beliefs.

For example, most financial newsletter buyers

are conservatives who distrust the media and Wall
Street and, of course, despise Democrats and liberals.
For that reason, Obama, Hillary, Democrats, Wall
Street bankers, and the biased media have all been
effectively used as a common enemy.

58

The 16-Word Sales Letter™

In the anti-aging supplement niche, a lot of the

prospects are older people who already believe
prescription costs are out of control. Naturally, it’s
common to set up greedy pharmaceutical companies
as the enemy.

Here’s how I set up the rigged game on Wall

Street as the common enemy in one of my sales
letters:

“Remember that famous line from the

movie Wall Street…

When trader Gordon Gecko said…

‘You’re either on the inside or the

outside.’

Well, everyday investors like you and me

have always been ‘on the outside’…

I’m sure you’ve noticed this too, right?

Only insiders with access to special
information were able to profit from those BIG
one-day moves.

The little guy was simply left out of

those big gains.

That rigged-game ends today….”

And here’s how I set up Democrats as the

common enemy in another letter:

“While Democrats and the corrupt

liberal media are busy trying to destroy our
country…

59

The 16-Word Sales Letter™

The Republican Congress has passed a

groundbreaking new law that could benefit
millions of REAL Americans like you.

You won’t hear this from the disgraced

mainstream media…

But a few everyday folks like you are

already collecting extra income thanks to this
new tax provision…

And collecting what I call ‘Republican

Checks.’

Just look what happened with Kevin

Larry, from Chicago.

He’s set to collect a massive check for

$44,577 this month.

Imagine if that happened to you….

That’s 34 times MORE money than the

average monthly Social Security benefit.

No wonder Kevin has retired

comfortably…

And now, instead of worrying about

money, he says: ‘It’s time to pursue my
personal interests full time.’”

Once you inject more emotion into your copy

by attacking a common enemy, it’s time to give them a
strong reason to act right now.

Let’s take a page from Hitler’s book.

60

The 16-Word Sales Letter™

Chapter 8

The One Sentence that Killed
as Many as 21 Million People

“Either the German people annihilate the Jews

or the Jews will enslave them.” Adolf Hitler

This one sentence killed millions of people.

Yes, Hitler was a monster. He was also a master
persuader. Did you ever stop to think how he
convinced an entire nation to slaughter as many as 21
million people during his brutal 12-year Third Reich?

He applied several persuasion techniques in his

speeches, like the one you see above. This powerful
technique is known as the “either-or” fallacy. It’s a
sentence that drastically raises the stakes by creating a
false dilemma in the mind of the audience.

By using that technique, Hitler made Germans

believe they had no other option. They had to kill
Jews. There was no compromise.

As a result, that sentence created an incredible

sense of urgency among Germans. They had to act.

If this technique can make 70 million rational
people engage in horrible atrocities, imagine what it
could do your sales letter.

61

The 16-Word Sales Letter™

That’s why the next question in the process is

designed to create a false dilemma in the mind of your
prospect with the “either-or” technique.

Here’s the question…

Question #6: Why Now?

Studies show that whenever you try to
persuade someone, you’ll face four levels of resistance
from your prospect.

The first one is reactance. That happens when

your prospect feels like you’re trying to limit their
freedom to choose or act. Nobody likes losing their
freedom. That’s why high-pressure sales techniques
often backfire.

And it’s why it’s often a bad idea to mention

your product in the lead of your sales letter. Because if
your prospects get even a whiff that you’re trying to
sell something, there’s a high chance they’ll close that
page.

Just think about it… how do you feel when a

salesperson rings your doorbell, and the moment you
open the door they ask you: “Would you like to
buy…?” Before they finish the sentence, you already
want to slam the door in their face, right? That’s
reactance.

The second level of resistance is distrust. And

that means your prospect will be skeptical of any
claims you make. We’ve already discussed how to
overcome that with question #3.

62

The 16-Word Sales Letter™

As you’ll see in the next chapter, Question #7

will also help destroy this persuasion barrier.

The third level is scrutiny. Your prospect will

need to see proof. We all know that people buy on
emotion and justify their emotional decision with
logic. That’s scrutiny. As you’ll see later in this book,
Question #8 is designed to break that barrier.

Finally, another face of resistance is inertia.

You can make an incredible promise with tons of
proof. But that’s still not enough to make your
prospect buy. That’s because of inertia. Staying put is
a lot easier than acting on something. We simply tend
to resist change.

And that’s where “why now?” comes in.

We need to start planting the seeds in your

prospect’s head that he’s facing an “either-or”
situation. Either you act now, or you’ll miss out on
this incredible opportunity. Either you act now, or you
could lose everything.

The key here is to raise the stakes. Just having
a date as a deadline is not enough. You need to trigger
FOMO in your prospect.

You can start doing that in the lead, and
throughout the promo, especially in the offer section.
After teasing an urgent event on October 26 in one of
my sales letters, here’s how I revealed the details and
raised the stakes:

“In fact, I want you to mark October 26

on your calendar…

63

The 16-Word Sales Letter™

Because this single event is about to
catapult cryptocurrencies into the third and
most explosive stage of the boom.

I am certain that Amazon WILL

ACCEPT Bitcoin.

They have no choice. And this will be the

tipping point that will create massive
generational wealth unlike we’ve ever seen
before.

Given the company's history of staying

ahead of its retail rivals…

Amazon could make the announcement

as early as October 26, at 4 p.m., during its
next earnings conference call.

Which is why you need to act RIGHT

NOW.

Once they make this announcement, the

impact on cryptocurrencies will be huge.

We’ll see a buying frenzy like never

before.

It'll be like a Black Friday crowd at Best

Buy.

Only those who get in early will get

a good deal.

Most people will be left out.

That’s why I urge you to get in right

now…

64

The 16-Word Sales Letter™

Get ahead of the crowd…

Ahead of the massive buying frenzy that

will push cryptocurrencies straight up.”

See how I used the “either-or” technique to

create massive urgency? Either you get in now, ahead
of this big event, or you won’t make any money.

For your next project, think about how you can

use this lesson from Hitler to destroy inertia and get
your prospect to act.

We’ve covered a lot of ground so far, so let’s
recap a bit. At this point, your prospects have been
presented with a new opportunity. You’ve shown
evidence that this is real. You’ve justified your
prospects’ failure and established a common enemy.
And you’ve teased why they must act now.

But remember, distrust is one of the
psychological barriers. Now it’s time to show them
why they should trust you.

65

The 16-Word Sales Letter™

Chapter 9

How to Make Your Prospect
Know, Trust, and Like You

Secretary: “Pan American airlines, can I help

you?”

Frank: “Yes ma’am, I’d like to speak with

someone in the purchasing department.”

Secretary: “One moment please”

Clerk: “How can I help you?”

Frank: “My name is John Black. I’m a co-pilot

with the company, based out of San Francisco. I’ve
been with the company seven years and I’ve never had
something like this come up before.”

Clerk: “What’s the problem?”

Frank: “Well, we flew in yesterday and we’re
going out today. Yesterday, I sent my uniform to my
hotel to have it dry cleaned. Now the hotel and the
cleaner said they can’t find it. And I have to flight in 4
hours.”

Clerk: “Don’t you have a spare uniform?”

Frank: “Certainly, back home in San Francisco,

but I’d never get it in time for my flight”

66

The 16-Word Sales Letter™

Clerk: “Hold on....”

A few minutes later…

Clerk: “My supervisor says you need to go
down to the Well-Built Uniform Company on 5th
Avenue. They’re our supplier. I’ll call them and let
them know you’re on the way.”

And that’s how Frank Abagnale was able to get
a Pan Am uniform, even though he couldn’t fly a kite,
let alone an airplane.

If you’ve read the book or watched the movie

Catch Me if You Can, you know the story. Pan Am
estimates that between the ages of 16 and 18, Frank
flew more than 1 million miles for free, boarded more
than 250 commercial airlines and traveled to 26
countries around the world. He never once stepped
onboard a Pan Am aircraft.

Instead, he abused the professional courtesy of
other airlines to provide free transport for competing
airline pilots if they had to move to another city at
short notice. He only pulled this off because of that
uniform. It gave him instant authority, just like white
lab coats give doctors authority. It made people trust
that he was a pilot with the airline.

And that’s why authority is one of the key
elements of persuasion, as you probably already know
from Robert Cialdini’s classic book.

And that’s why the next question in the process

is this…

67

The 16-Word Sales Letter™

Question #7: Why should I trust

you?

This will be the credibility section of your sales

letter. There are three main “storylines” I’ve found
that work best to establish authority and make your
prospect trust and like you.

The first and most powerful one is the “I’ve

been in your shoes” storyline. Then there are the
Robin Hood and the expert storylines.

Let’s take a look at each one.

The “I’ve been in your shoes” Storyline

The goal here is to show your prospect that you

(the guru, editor, etc.) went through the same
challenges your prospect is facing right now. That at
some point everything seemed lost. But then you
discovered your new mechanism, and it changed
everything. It helped you overcome all the challenges
and achieve the same things your prospect desires.

This is powerful because you’re indirectly
talking about your prospect’s deepest desires through
your own story. You’re painting the picture of how
their life could be. But you’re doing it in a very
indirect way that will trigger no resistance from your
prospect.

By telling your journey, your reader will think
“OMG, this guy is just like me. Finally, someone who
gets it. That’s exactly what I’m going through right
now. And he already achieved what I want.” How can
your prospect not trust that?

68

The 16-Word Sales Letter™

Here’s how I did that in one of my sales letters

that offered a penny stock advisory service.

I knew most of my prospects were frustrated

with slow-moving stocks and not making much money
with those “safe” stocks. I also knew most of them
came from middle-class families. To make this even
more powerful, I also added a testimonial/case study
towards the end to show that anybody can do this.

Here’s the copy:

“You see, when I started investing…

I traded expensive, blue chip stocks

because that’s what everyone told me you had
to do to get rich in the long run.

But those stocks move way too slow. My

portfolio didn’t move an inch for months at a
time.

So I started trading penny stocks….

And I started making 20%, 40%, 50% or

more in profits… in a matter of days.

I also didn’t start with a lot of money.

I grew up as a middle-class kid in a

small rural town in Connecticut.

I wasn’t born with a silver spoon in my

mouth.

So penny stocks were perfect for
someone like me… who wasn’t rich yet.

69

The 16-Word Sales Letter™

But WANTED to get rich.

That’s the beauty of penny stocks….

You can start with very little money

because they trade for pennies on the dollar….

And because they’re so explosive, you

can make a fortune fast.

Look what happened to Tim Gritanni….

When he started following my strategy a

few years ago….

He was selling insurance for State

Farm… and he only had $1,500 to his name.

Today he’s a multimillionaire.”

The Robin Hood Storyline

As you know, the folkloric hero Robin Hood is

a noble outlaw in Sherwood Forest who fights the
oppressive evil of King John by robbing from the rich
and giving to the poor. In this storyline, you will be
“stealing” a secret from the rich and giving it to the
reader.

This works even better if you accidently
stumbled into a secret “they didn’t want you to know.”
And now for the first time ever you’re blowing the
whistle to level the playing field.

Here’s something I’ve used in one of my sales

letters:

70

The 16-Word Sales Letter™

“I’ve spent most of my adult life trading

derivatives on Wall Street.

As a 22-year old kid, I was already

trading $100 million accounts….

After that, the stakes only got higher.

At one point, I was personally making

millions of dollars per year…

Going on annual ski trip to Switzerland,
where I stayed at billionaire Richard Branson's
chalet…

Attending lavish events, like the Grand
Prix in Monaco… even the Kill Bill premiere in
Cannes.

If you’ve watched the movie The Wolf of

Wall Street, you get the idea.

But no matter how much money I

made…

I wasn’t happy working on Wall Street.

Helping the rich getting richer and

watching bankers screw the little guy wasn’t
fulfilling.

So after years of seeing the rotten

machine from the inside…

I had finally had enough…

And decided to leave everything behind.

71

The 16-Word Sales Letter™

But here’s what’s important…

When I left Wall Street I took an income

secret with me…

One that I’ve never revealed to anyone

until today….”

The Expert Storyline

If you can’t use “I’ve been in your shoes” or

Robin Hood storylines, then your next best option is
to position your main character as a guru by talking
about his expertise. That includes books, TV
appearances, experience, or any accomplishments
that proves expertise in the field.

Here’s an example from one of my sales letters:

“I started my trading career in 1991,

when I joined the Chicago Board of Trade right
out of college.

And I’ve spent the last 25 years on the

trading floor…

Working through the ranks… from being

a runner, phone clerk and broker…

All the way up to becoming a

professional trader…

And a member of the Chicago Board of

Trade…

Where I traded my own account on the

floor…

72

The 16-Word Sales Letter™

And competed with the world’s best

traders.

You might have seen me on Bloomberg,
CNBC, Fox Business, and other major financial
news…

Where I’m frequently invited to share

my views on the market.”

These storylines are not mutually exclusive.
You can mix and match them when appropriate to
make the story even more powerful. Once your
prospect knows, trusts, and likes you, by this point
they should be emotionally sold.

I know I’ve covered a lot of ground so far. But
on average I answer all these first seven question in
the first 1/3 of the sales letter. Once the emotional sale
is done, you’re going to help your prospects justify
their decision with solid logic.

It’s time to show them how your new

mechanism actually works.

73

The 16-Word Sales Letter™

Chapter 10

How to Make Your Prospect
Nod his Head and Think
“Yeah, that Makes Sense.”

Here’s a real conversation between a farmer

and a doctor back in the 1920s:

Farmer: “Doc, is there anything you can do

for…you know… sexual weakness?”

Doctor: “Sorry, but there’s nothing to be done

for impotence.”

Farmer, after noticing a male goat mounting a
female goat through the window: “It’s too bad I don’t
have billy goat nuts. Say, Doc! Why don’t you just put
some goat nuts in me? Graft ‘em on, like the way I
graft Pound Sweet on an apple stray!”

Doctor: “Are you serious?”

Farmer: “Well, Doc, they can’t be worse than
the nuts I got. Just give it a try, and if it don’t work, I
sure as heck won’t tell nobody.”

And that’s how one of the most bizarre stories
in quackery began. If you’ve read the great book from
Dan Kennedy, Make Them Believe, you know the
Brinkley story.

74

The 16-Word Sales Letter™

According to Dr. John Brinkley, that farmer’s

wife gave birth to a healthy baby boy nine months
after the goat testicle transplant. The boy was named
Billy (after the goat).

Goat testicle transplant. Talk about a brand-
new mechanism. This worked because farmers (Dr.
Brinkley’s primary prospects) already believed goats
were sexual dynamos. It was an accepted fact.

Heck, to this date, many people still believe

that. It’s why eating penises and testicles from
donkeys, goats, and bulls is popular in certain parts of
Asia.

Without that existing belief, Dr. Brinkley would
probably have never pulled this off. Even though there
was no scientific proof that his method worked,
whenever he explained the mechanism, his prospects
went “yeah, that makes sense.”

He channeled an existing belief (goats are
sexual dynamos) to support what would otherwise be
a ridiculous claim.

And that’s your goal in this next step of the

copy. You have to answer this next question in a way
that will make your prospects nod their heads.

Here’s the question…

Question #8: How does it work?

It’s time to reveal how your new mechanism

actually works. If you can do that by exploring an
existing belief (like Dr. Brinkley did), it will make your
copy stronger.

75

The 16-Word Sales Letter™

Now, we’re not farmers back in the 1920s. Your
prospects are a lot smarter now. Aside from exploring
an existing belief, you better be able to explain your
mechanism in a very logical way… in a way that will
make you reader think “oh yeah, that makes total
sense.”

Your prospect needs to understand exactly how

your new mechanism gives him the end result you’re
promising. The key here is to remember that this
proof and the explanation of your mechanism are also
copy. As such, they cannot be boring.

That’s a mistake I see many writers making.

Remember, if you wrap the explanation of the
mechanism in an ABT storytelling frame, your copy
will be much easier for the reader to consume.

Here’s how I answered that question in one of

my sales letters that talked about a new tax law that
would trigger repatriation of money.

That repatriation was my new mechanism. And

I called it the “cash for patriots program.” My
prospects were conservatives who already believed
Trump was trying to do everything he could to “make
America great again.”

Here’s the copy:

“There are literally trillions of dollars at

stake.

I’m talking about $27,718 on average for

every American taxpayer.

76

The 16-Word Sales Letter™

In order to take advantage of this
opportunity, it’s important that you first
understand where all this money is coming
from.

The first thing you should know is that it

doesn’t come from the U.S. government.

Even though this is a government

program, the money comes from the private
sector.

The Trump administration is simply

creating the conditions to unleash $2.6 trillion
into the hands of everyday Americans.

You see, because the U.S. dollar is the

world’s reserve currency…

Other countries around the world also

use our currency.

For that reason, there are trillions of

dollars circulating outside the U.S.

And the Joint Committee on Taxation
(JCT) has identified a stash of $2.6 trillion…
mostly hiding in Ireland.

Trump’s plan is designed to bring some

of the cash back home.

In a recent speech to the Detroit
Economic Club he said his administration will
‘bring back trillions of dollars that is now
parked overseas.’

77

The 16-Word Sales Letter™

He believes that’s money that belongs to

American patriots.

It’s part of his ‘America comes first’

philosophy.

Why leave all the cash outside the U.S. if

it can come home and help our citizens?

It’s hard to argue with that argument.

In fact, BOTH Democrats and

Republicans agree it’s a good idea.

As Bloomberg says, ‘[the cash for
patriots program] may be one of the few things
Republicans and Democrats can agree on.’”

Notice how I explored an already existing

belief. But I also added extra proof with the quotes
from Trump himself and Bloomberg, a credible
source. There’s no way in hell my prospect will read
this and think “this makes no sense.”

Once you show your prospect how your new

mechanism works, they’re ready to buy. They’re pre-
sold.

At this point, you’ve proven that your new
opportunity is the key to what they desire and it’s only
attainable through your new mechanism.

Now all you need to do is make a no-brainer

offer.

78

The 16-Word Sales Letter™

Chapter 11

From Flipping Burgers to
Becoming the Richest Man
Alive… All Thanks to a No-
Brainer Offer

His first job was working at McDonald’s in the
summer, while also helping out his grandfather on his
South Texas ranch.

After developing a no-brainer offer, this kid

from Albuquerque, New Mexico, went from flipping
burgers to becoming richer than Warren Buffet, Bill
Gates, and Mark Zuckerberg.

It all started in his garage in 1994, when he

read that the web had grown 2,300% in one year. He
then made a list of 20 possible products to sell online.
At the top of the list? Books.

Yes, I’m talking about founder of Amazon, Jeff

Bezos.

Using scale and thin margins to offer
unbeatable prices, Amazon seems to be taking over
the world. Combine competitive prices with its
shopping experience (1-Click checkout and fast
doorstep delivery), and you got a no-brainer offer.

79

The 16-Word Sales Letter™

Who doesn’t want to buy quality products for

less money and receive them as fast as possible? With
all the value they offer, you’d have to be a moron NOT
to shop on amazon.com. The key word here is “value.”

And that’s where the next question of the

process comes in. It’s time to make an offer. But not
just any offer.

You must answer the following question with a

no-brainer offer…

Question #9: How can I get

started?

Your goal here is to put together an offer so

good (product/service, price, bonuses, guarantee) that
will take your copy to a whole other level. In fact, if
you can get your offer right, your copy doesn’t even
have to be top-notch.

As the saying goes, “the product is mightier
than the pen.” So how can you make a no-brainer
offer?

By creating a huge GAP between the value and
the price. In order to accomplish that, you can either
offer a ton of value or cut the price or do a combo of
both.

Many businesses make the mistake of cutting
their prices, and they end up making their products
look “cheap” (“with such a low price, this can’t be
good”). They eventually price themselves out of
existence.

80

The 16-Word Sales Letter™

Have you ever bought anything that was both

the best in the industry and also the cheapest? No!
You get what you pay for. And that’s how your
prospect thinks too. So lowering the price reduces the
perceived value of your product and can actually
reduce sales.

That’s why the best option is to focus on
increasing the value of your proposition. Lowering the
price is for losers. Don’t do it.

You can create the perception of value by

comparing it with a higher-price product that could
provide a similar solution.

For example, a hedge fund that provides a

similar strategy would charge you $100,000. That
way, you’re anchoring the high price, creating the
illusion that your offer is a really good deal.

You can also use scarcity (limiting the number
of units available) to increase the perceived value and
create urgency.

But the best way to add value to your offer is by
adding bonus gifts. And I’m not talking about just any
bonuses that you slap together without giving it much
thought.

Master online marketer Todd Brown talks
about the importance of putting together what he calls
S.I.N. Offers — superior, irresistible, and no-brainer.
Here’s how Todd explains the importance of bonuses:

“The right way to construct your offer is to

create your premiums specifically for the offer.
Premiums should be so good and so valuable… They

81

The 16-Word Sales Letter™

should demonstrate such exciting, compelling
benefits... That your prospects would happily pay
money for them!”

Todd says the way you begin the construction

of these premiums is by asking yourself…

“What premiums would perfectly complement

my main product and add enormous value to the
offer?”

Adding a few good bonuses to your offer will

drive your value proposition through the roof. And it
will allow you to use the value stack technique from
Russell Brunson. What’s the value stack?

You basically show the value (not the price) of

each item you’re offering and add them all up. The
goal is to show a huge value that will make your final
price offer look like a total give away.

For example, when you see that you’re getting

$23,450 worth of products for only $1,999, it’s an
offer that’s really hard to pass up.

Once you offer a ton of value, then you want to

eliminate the risk for your prospect with a money-
back guarantee or other type of risk reversal (“it will
cost you nothing if you’re not happy”).

Here’s a basic template for an offer that I like

to use in my sales letters:

Reveal the special report (the main

offer)

Introduce subscription service (you get

the report when you join the service)

82

The 16-Word Sales Letter™

It’s Time to Close with the
Powerful Push-Pull Technique

Here’s advice from a famous pickup artist on

how to seduce “a legit 10” at a bar:

“Let’s say she has long nails which are most

likely fake. Now why do 10s dress so FINE if they
don’t want the attention? Sometimes they LOVE the
feeling of control.

They are in a club with friends and they want to

be the leader of the circle (social hierarchy in
primates) and so she gets all the attention.

The guys come and buy drinks for them and
she gets off on knocking the guys down. It’s all in a
day’s play.

Ok, so she is wearing fake nails to look even

BETTER! Most guys will say, “Wow you are so
beautiful!”

BORING, typical and in her mind by now,

TRUE.

Imagine now, a guy comes along and says “Nice

nails. Are they real?”

She will have to concede, “No, acrylic.”

84

The 16-Word Sales Letter™

And he says (like he didn’t notice it was a put

down), “Oh. (Pause) well I guess they still LOOK
good.”

Then he turns his back to her.”

This comes straight from Mystery, the famous

pick-up artist featured in the book The Game. Have
you ever come across as “too needy” when
approaching a girl? I know I have.

And in those cases, my failure rate was 100%.

Nobody likes a needy person.

As my buddy Oren Klaff likes to say, “people

want what they can’t have, they chase what moves
away from them, and they only value that which they
pay for.”

The same way you can turn a hot woman off by
being too needy, you can turn your prospect off if you
sound too desperate for the sale.

And that’s exactly a mistake many copywriters

make at the closing.

They’re so desperate for those royalties… so
desperate to close the sale… so desperate to finally
have that blockbuster hit they’ve been dreaming
about… that it shows in the copy.

They’re basically begging the prospect to buy.

And that’s the last thing you want to do in the offer
section.

So what should you do? You should take a page
from the pickup artist playbook and alternate between

85

The 16-Word Sales Letter™

attraction and disinterest signals in a push-pull
fashion.

First, you’re going to push your prospect away

by making them feel they’re in control. It’s their
decision. They have options. Maybe this is not even
right for them.

Then pull them back in by reminding them of
what’s at stake. Paint the picture of what they have to
lose if they don’t act.

It’s time to answer the last question of the

process…

Question #10: What do I have to

lose?

Remember, we started this whole process with
the one belief. By now, your prospect either believes it
or you have no chance of selling. So remind him how
your new opportunity is the key to what he desires
and that it’s only attainable through your new
mechanism.

Then, raise the pain levels by painting the
picture of how his life will remain the same if he
doesn’t act. Whatever problem he has will not be
solved. The key here is not to be needy and to let your
prospect decide for himself.

Here’s how I closed one of my letters:

“Look, you’ve seen how you could have

made weekend profits of $8,780, $9,100 or
even $15,820… All by using my simple
weekend strategy.

86

The 16-Word Sales Letter™

You saw how people who are following

my strategy are already making a quick fortune
on the weekends…

I’ve negotiated a special charter

membership offer with a one-time $2,000
discount…

With a performance guarantee that fully

covers the price of your subscription.

Now it’s time for a decision.

The Way I See It You Have Three

Options…

Option #1: Do absolutely nothing and

stay exactly where you are right now.

If you already have enough to retire and
you’re not worried about running out of money
during your golden years…

Then maybe you don’t need this

weekend strategy.

But if you’d like to make some extra

income on the weekends, that leaves you with
two other options…

Option #2: Do it yourself.

You can try to keep track of all the

millions of financial news and blog posts that
are published every day…

Then try to analyze all the 1,887 stocks

that are currently trading below $5…

87

The 16-Word Sales Letter™

And hope you’ll pick the right one… the

one that could pay you a fortune on Monday.

If you’re willing to work hard and spend
hours in front of your computer, you might be
able to pull it off.

Option #3: Let me do the heavy lifting

for you

I’ll put my proven news filtering system

to work for you.

I’ll do the legwork and send you my

research and video alerts.

All you need to do is read my research

and place the trade on a Friday if you decide to
invest…

Go enjoy your weekend…

Then come back on Monday to collect

your profits.

Of these three options, ask yourself…

What’s Going to Be Easier for You?

You see, there are two types of people in

this world…

Those who only dream about achieving

their financial goals without ever taking any
action to make it happen…

And those who are ready to take action

when the opportunity presents itself.

88

The 16-Word Sales Letter™

Most people will tell you they want to

retire rich.

But we both know very few actually

make it happen.

It’s a natural law of financial wealth….

The classic tale of the willful and the

wishful.

Most people will keep dreaming…

While the few who are actually serious

about their financial future will take action.

Since you’ve watched my entire
presentation this far, I think you’re one of the
few special ones…

One of the 250 people I’m looking for.

If I’m right and you’re still with me…

I’m ready to send you that email with

the subject line: The Weekend Trade that
Could Pay You $6,250 Next Monday.

Only you can decide.”

Notice how I only presented the options,
without trying to convince the prospect which one he
should choose. I’ve created the illusion that he’s in
control.

Then I painted the picture that nothing would

change in his life if he didn’t act. But I did that
without being needy. Instead, I created the

89

The 16-Word Sales Letter™

impression that I couldn’t care less what he decides to
do.

That’s how you want to finish the letter.

Remember, people chase what moves away from
them.

Putting it All Together

We’ve reached the end of the road. Even
though it seems we covered a lot, this is a very simple
process. It’s designed to get you thinking before you
write a single piece of copy.

In fact, when I mentor writers in my team, I
highly encourage them to write down the one belief
for the promo idea… and try to answer at least the
first seven question with just a couple of lines.

I do that myself with every single promotion I

write. And I’ve found that very helpful. It’s a way to
map out the entire promotion in 5-10 minutes.

Then all you need to do is research and start

writing on the appropriate sections.

Remember the 16-word sales letter™ that

helped me sell $120 million+ in the last two years…

“The secret to converting copy is to define the

one belief, then answer these ten questions.”

Here’s the one belief…

This new opportunity is the key to their

desire and it’s attainable only through my new
mechanism.

Here are the ten questions...

91

The 16-Word Sales Letter™

Question #1: How is this different from

everything else I’ve seen?

Question #2: What’s in it for me?

Question #3: How do I know this is

real?

Question #4: What’s holding me back?

Question #5: Who/What is to blame?

Question #6: Why now?

Question #7: Why should I trust you?

Question #8: How does it work?

Question #9: How can I get started?
Question #10: What do I have to lose?

Here’s what to do next…

As you know, writing copy is a very complex

process. The market is always evolving… new
techniques emerge… the environment change.

There’s always something new to learn…

Which is why what I’ve showed you here is just

the tip of the iceberg.

Acknowledgements

I could not have written this book without the

support of a handful of people.

Big thanks to Justin Ford, who hired me and
introduced me to the Agora world. I never forgot the

Big thanks to my former boss Erika Nolan.

When I decided to learn more about copy, you were
100% behind me and helped me anyway you could.

Big thanks to Oren Klaff and Blair Warren.

publisher of Agora Financial. You’re the best mentor
anyone could ask for. Your friendship and guidance
over the last few years is a big, big reason behind my
