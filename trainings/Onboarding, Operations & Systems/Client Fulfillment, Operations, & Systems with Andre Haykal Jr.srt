1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:29,859
Thank you.

2
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:59,859
Thank you.

3
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:29,859
Thank you.

4
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:30,540
Hey, Brady.

5
00:01:30,819 --> 00:01:31,730
What's going on?

6
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:32,959
What's going on?

7
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:34,019
What's going on?

8
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:36,719
Jam, jam, jam.

9
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:38,090
Love it.

10
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:39,469
Love it.

11
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:40,609
How are you doing, guys?

12
00:01:42,349 --> 00:01:43,819
This is super weird for me because

13
00:01:43,819 --> 00:01:45,319
I'm used to being on Zoom calls

14
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:46,950
where I can see everyone's faces

15
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:48,000
and we can talk.

16
00:01:48,269 --> 00:01:50,530
And so I'm going to need you guys

17
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:52,840
to help out as much as possible

18
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,260
just by being super active in the

19
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:56,060
chat.

20
00:01:56,109 --> 00:01:56,739
Say what's up.

21
00:01:56,909 --> 00:01:58,280
Let me know where you're from,

22
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:59,650
where you're calling in from.

23
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,500
How's the challenge been up to

24
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,299
this point?

25
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:05,099
Let's talk in the chat because it

26
00:02:05,099 --> 00:02:06,700
feels weird just being up here

27
00:02:06,969 --> 00:02:08,650
without seeing any of you guys.

28
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:10,030
Where is everyone calling from?

29
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:11,750
You can probably tell that I'm

30
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:13,960
calling from Christian's office.

31
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:15,939
Christian hosted the call on

32
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:16,750
Tuesday.

33
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:18,610
And I'm staying with him down here

34
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:19,250
in Tampa.

35
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:21,080
We have an event this weekend.

36
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,139
And so I'm in his office, which

37
00:02:23,189 --> 00:02:25,259
probably looks familiar if you

38
00:02:25,389 --> 00:02:27,500
guys were on Tuesday's call.

39
00:02:27,669 --> 00:02:28,939
So calling from Tampa.

40
00:02:29,009 --> 00:02:29,319
Wow.

41
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,580
We got people from Paraguay,

42
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:31,590
Finland, Michigan, Fort

43
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:35,939
Lauderdale, Chicago, Moldova,

44
00:02:36,169 --> 00:02:37,530
Sweden.

45
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:38,680
Wow.

46
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,069
Seattle.

47
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,120
This is awesome.

48
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:43,250
We got people joining from all

49
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,020
over India, Orlando.

50
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:47,000
Charlie, what up, boy?

51
00:02:47,169 --> 00:02:48,180
My dude, Charlie.

52
00:02:48,449 --> 00:02:49,759
Good to see you, bro.

53
00:02:49,909 --> 00:02:52,750
Keelan, good to have you on here,

54
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:53,370
bro.

55
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:54,500
Load up that chat.

56
00:02:54,629 --> 00:02:56,580
If you guys are just joining in,

57
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:58,210
just let me know where you're

58
00:02:58,569 --> 00:02:59,610
calling in from.

59
00:02:59,689 --> 00:03:01,210
It's pretty cool to see we have

60
00:03:01,449 --> 00:03:03,120
people literally calling in from

61
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,310
all over the world.

62
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,310
And I'm even seeing some people

63
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:08,699
from the same places.

64
00:03:08,699 --> 00:03:09,669
I see a couple of guys from

65
00:03:09,669 --> 00:03:11,050
Orlando, a couple of guys from

66
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:11,740
Seattle.

67
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:13,349
And so maybe you guys will find

68
00:03:13,349 --> 00:03:15,159
some new friends and connections

69
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:16,919
in the area where you're from.

70
00:03:17,139 --> 00:03:17,819
That'd be pretty cool.

71
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:20,099
But we'll get started here in the

72
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:21,620
next minute or so.

73
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:22,629
I just want to give some people

74
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:23,680
more time to join.

75
00:03:25,229 --> 00:03:27,900
What I would love to see in the

76
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,879
chat is what has been the number

77
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:34,080
one learning, the number one key

78
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:36,340
takeaway, the number one action

79
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:38,139
item from the first three days

80
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:39,520
with Daniel on Monday, Christian

81
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,219
on Tuesday, and Dan yesterday.

82
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,949
Post in the chat, number one key

83
00:03:43,949 --> 00:03:46,400
takeaway from Monday through

84
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:47,810
Wednesday.

85
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:48,810
Go.

86
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:51,620
And yes, for everyone asking, I'm

87
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:53,180
in Christian's office right now.

88
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:55,199
So I'm borrowing Christian's

89
00:03:55,289 --> 00:03:57,080
office for today's call.

90
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:59,240
Awesome.

91
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,810
So we got a sales scripting

92
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:02,960
process, specific product offering

93
00:04:03,229 --> 00:04:04,780
with a guarantee, adding a

94
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:07,439
performance guarantee, nailing the

95
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:08,310
offer.

96
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:09,639
My offer sucks.

97
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:10,120
Okay.

98
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:10,960
That's okay.

99
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,020
Have a no-brainer offer.

100
00:04:13,449 --> 00:04:16,589
Dan's sales call was goaded.

101
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:18,500
Authentically selling.

102
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:20,089
Follow up with interested leaves

103
00:04:20,089 --> 00:04:20,990
until doomsday.

104
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:22,170
Your offer needs to have a

105
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:23,680
guarantee and a claim if you don't

106
00:04:23,899 --> 00:04:24,910
have social proof.

107
00:04:25,129 --> 00:04:26,509
Having very detailed terms on the

108
00:04:26,509 --> 00:04:27,800
guarantee is super, super

109
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,560
important.

110
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:31,199
How to properly do outreach.

111
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:32,709
It's harder to get someone on the

112
00:04:32,709 --> 00:04:33,980
phone than it is to sell them

113
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:34,540
something.

114
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:36,949
Need a better offer with a

115
00:04:36,949 --> 00:04:38,279
guarantee.

116
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:39,519
Contract stipulations.

117
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:40,800
Detailed sales process.

118
00:04:41,009 --> 00:04:42,720
The top offer will win every

119
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,439
client in the market.

120
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:46,660
Super easy objection handling.

121
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:48,259
This is awesome, guys.

122
00:04:48,259 --> 00:04:49,480
So if you're just now joining in,

123
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,610
what we're putting in the chat is

124
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:52,500
like the number one key takeaway,

125
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:55,540
the number one learning from the

126
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:58,290
sessions on Monday with Daniel,

127
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,879
Tuesday with Christian, and

128
00:05:00,149 --> 00:05:01,639
yesterday with Dan.

129
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:03,860
And then we'll get started here in

130
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:04,680
a minute.

131
00:05:04,889 --> 00:05:06,509
And we'll go for about an hour to

132
00:05:06,509 --> 00:05:08,339
an hour and a half is I think what

133
00:05:08,339 --> 00:05:09,860
we have scheduled here.

134
00:05:10,189 --> 00:05:12,199
So I'll present for around an hour

135
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:14,360
on something that I think is super

136
00:05:14,819 --> 00:05:15,899
important and relevant

137
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:17,990
based on the information that you

138
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:19,879
guys learned over the past three

139
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:20,439
days.

140
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:23,160
And then we'll get into Q&A.

141
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:27,069
So before we get started, three

142
00:05:27,939 --> 00:05:28,339
things.

143
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:32,790
One, tomorrow's session with

144
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,860
Daniel is going to be the most

145
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,750
important session of the entire

146
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:37,550
challenge.

147
00:05:37,829 --> 00:05:39,370
And so if you've shown up today

148
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:40,980
and if you've shown up on the

149
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,000
previous days,

150
00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:44,029
make sure you show up to Daniel's

151
00:05:44,029 --> 00:05:45,220
call tomorrow.

152
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:46,899
Myself, Daniel, Dan, and

153
00:05:46,899 --> 00:05:48,860
Christian, we're all going to be

154
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:49,600
on that call.

155
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:52,000
And I'm telling you guys, that

156
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,610
call alone makes the entire

157
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:55,379
challenge worth your investment

158
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,009
10x.

159
00:05:56,149 --> 00:05:57,550
So make sure to show up to the

160
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:58,660
call tomorrow.

161
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:01,160
I believe that's also at 1 p.m.

162
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:03,930
Number two, because I cannot see

163
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:05,529
your faces and because I cannot

164
00:06:05,529 --> 00:06:07,860
hear from you guys in a more

165
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:08,660
interactive way

166
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,029
because of this format on Zoom, I

167
00:06:10,029 --> 00:06:12,040
need you guys to be super active

168
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,519
in the chat because I need that

169
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:15,889
validation to see that people are

170
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:17,430
still here, you're listening,

171
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:18,629
you're getting value.

172
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:19,490
Okay.

173
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:22,779
And then number three, if you have

174
00:06:22,779 --> 00:06:25,069
questions, I'm going to do my best

175
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:27,300
to answer as many questions as

176
00:06:27,569 --> 00:06:29,709
possible at the very end of this

177
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:30,420
call.

178
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:33,560
And for me to make sure I hit your

179
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,899
questions, please use the Q&A

180
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,120
feature in Zoom because I'm not

181
00:06:38,129 --> 00:06:40,279
going to be scrolling through the

182
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:42,120
chat to find out, you know, which

183
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,449
one of the chat messages are

184
00:06:43,819 --> 00:06:44,660
actual questions.

185
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:47,959
So please use the Q&A box on the

186
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:51,220
bottom of the Zoom meeting.

187
00:06:51,379 --> 00:06:52,819
You should see it in your screen.

188
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:53,680
It says Q&A.

189
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:56,420
And if you have questions, make

190
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:58,180
sure you put your questions in

191
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:58,800
there.

192
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,860
And at the end of the

193
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,850
presentation, I'll spend however

194
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:03,610
much time we have left doing some

195
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,660
Q&A with you guys.

196
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:05,220
All right.

197
00:07:05,329 --> 00:07:06,910
So three things again, tomorrow's

198
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:07,939
call with Daniel.

199
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,379
It's an absolute must attend.

200
00:07:10,589 --> 00:07:12,199
Number two, be super active in the

201
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:13,720
chat throughout this entire

202
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,439
session.

203
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:15,810
So I know that you're still with

204
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,189
me and you're getting value and

205
00:07:17,189 --> 00:07:18,600
you're not falling asleep.

206
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:20,209
And number three, if you have

207
00:07:20,209 --> 00:07:22,160
questions, put them specifically

208
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,139
in the Q&A box.

209
00:07:24,149 --> 00:07:24,360
Okay.

210
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:26,560
All right.

211
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:27,899
So I'm going to get started.

212
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:30,750
As you guys probably know, what

213
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,449
I'm going to be sharing with you

214
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:36,129
guys today, it's operations

215
00:07:36,129 --> 00:07:37,250
focused.

216
00:07:37,449 --> 00:07:37,819
All right.

217
00:07:38,029 --> 00:07:40,610
So it's client fulfillment,

218
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:43,480
operations, and systems.

219
00:07:44,269 --> 00:07:46,480
And the reason this is so

220
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,870
important is because we need to be

221
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:53,509
able to capture the sales velocity

222
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:55,699
that was created from the

223
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:58,660
conversations you had with Daniel

224
00:07:58,829 --> 00:08:01,180
on Monday, Christian on Tuesday,

225
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,579
and Dan yesterday.

226
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:05,269
You need to be able to capture the

227
00:08:05,269 --> 00:08:07,759
value of your sales velocity.

228
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:09,889
If you only do a good job getting

229
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:11,740
leads and closing deals and you

230
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:13,589
don't have client fulfillment

231
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,629
operations and systems dialed in,

232
00:08:15,769 --> 00:08:17,389
you're only going to go so far

233
00:08:17,459 --> 00:08:19,430
before it crashes and burns to the

234
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:20,269
ground.

235
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,040
And so you can't just get really

236
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,620
good at marketing and sales.

237
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,720
You also have to do the follow

238
00:08:25,069 --> 00:08:25,720
through.

239
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:27,819
And that's the simplicity of

240
00:08:27,819 --> 00:08:28,839
business.

241
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:29,829
It's really just those three

242
00:08:29,829 --> 00:08:30,240
things.

243
00:08:30,379 --> 00:08:32,269
It's marketing, and then sales,

244
00:08:32,269 --> 00:08:33,759
and then fulfillment.

245
00:08:34,668 --> 00:08:36,500
But so often people underestimate

246
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,548
the importance of the fulfillment

247
00:08:38,548 --> 00:08:40,320
piece because it's a later on type

248
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:41,048
thing.

249
00:08:41,288 --> 00:08:42,259
You have to do marketing and sales

250
00:08:42,418 --> 00:08:43,470
first, which I completely

251
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:44,120
understand.

252
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:45,950
But once you get marketing and

253
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:48,059
sales going, you need to make your

254
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:50,330
fulfillment operations and systems

255
00:08:50,409 --> 00:08:52,289
as dialed as possible so that you

256
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:54,009
can capture the value of your

257
00:08:54,059 --> 00:08:55,440
sales velocity.

258
00:08:55,549 --> 00:08:56,960
So I'm going to get straight into

259
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,409
it, and this is going to be a bit

260
00:08:58,409 --> 00:09:00,000
of a marathon presentation.

261
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:02,009
And then, again, we'll make as

262
00:09:02,009 --> 00:09:03,940
much time at the end for Q&A.

263
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:07,009
So sales velocity, what is sales

264
00:09:07,009 --> 00:09:08,059
velocity?

265
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:09,940
So sales velocity is the lifeblood

266
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:11,360
of your agency, okay?

267
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,610
So the definition, at least in my

268
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:16,039
mind, is consistently signing new

269
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:18,129
clients for your agency by never

270
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:20,549
turning off marketing and sales,

271
00:09:20,629 --> 00:09:21,250
okay?

272
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:23,399
The critical importance of this is

273
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:25,539
without a continuous stream of new

274
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:27,700
clients, your agency simply won't

275
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:28,600
survive.

276
00:09:28,779 --> 00:09:31,049
So you can sign a bunch of clients

277
00:09:31,049 --> 00:09:32,559
until you can't.

278
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:33,659
Not because marketing and sales

279
00:09:33,909 --> 00:09:34,990
isn't working, but because you

280
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:36,379
can't fulfill for more clients.

281
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:37,580
You're, quote, unquote, at

282
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,139
capacity.

283
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:40,429
And if that's where you're stuck

284
00:09:40,429 --> 00:09:42,799
at for too long, your agency just

285
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:44,730
simply will not survive.

286
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:46,700
And so the key insight here is

287
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,470
it's not just about getting

288
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:49,340
clients.

289
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:50,440
It's about getting them

290
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,600
consistently.

291
00:09:51,809 --> 00:09:53,720
And in business, what you'll learn

292
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,710
is that momentum is everything,

293
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:56,299
okay?

294
00:09:56,509 --> 00:09:58,610
And so here's the hard reality of

295
00:09:58,610 --> 00:09:59,860
agency churn.

296
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:02,120
The standard for agencies from the

297
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,269
ones I've run and who we've worked

298
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:06,899
with is anywhere from a 10% to 20%

299
00:10:07,169 --> 00:10:08,480
monthly churn rate.

300
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:10,779
And so let's just take the best of

301
00:10:10,779 --> 00:10:12,600
those numbers and look at 10%

302
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,850
monthly churn rates.

303
00:10:14,129 --> 00:10:15,830
If you have 10 clients every

304
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:17,639
month, you're going to lose one

305
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:19,549
client with a 10% churn.

306
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:21,360
If you have 20 clients, you're

307
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,860
going to lose two clients this

308
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,370
month with a 10% churn.

309
00:10:24,539 --> 00:10:25,960
If you have 50 clients, you're

310
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,330
going to lose five clients with a

311
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:28,559
10% monthly churn.

312
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,720
So what does this mean?

313
00:10:30,929 --> 00:10:33,330
Well, you need to at least replace

314
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:35,529
churn clients with new clients

315
00:10:35,889 --> 00:10:37,490
just to stay flatline,

316
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:38,230
a.k.a.

317
00:10:38,379 --> 00:10:39,720
you're not even growing at that

318
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,299
point.

319
00:10:40,509 --> 00:10:42,470
You're literally just staying at

320
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:44,080
even growth, right?

321
00:10:44,289 --> 00:10:46,570
You're stuck at 10K a month or 30K

322
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:49,000
a month or 50K a month or 300K a

323
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:49,259
month

324
00:10:49,669 --> 00:10:51,769
because you're churning 10% and

325
00:10:51,769 --> 00:10:53,789
you're replacing only that same

326
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,750
amount of churn customers.

327
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:58,779
So if you have 50 clients and your

328
00:10:58,779 --> 00:11:00,440
churn's 10%,

329
00:11:00,649 --> 00:11:02,100
you need to sign at least six

330
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,980
clients to continue growing,

331
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:04,620
right?

332
00:11:04,779 --> 00:11:05,720
And for a lot of you guys, signing

333
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,580
six clients is like a pipe dream

334
00:11:07,789 --> 00:11:09,139
because you haven't even signed

335
00:11:09,139 --> 00:11:09,720
one yet.

336
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:11,279
But what does that look like for

337
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,899
some of the more advanced guys in

338
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:14,820
here that have 100 clients?

339
00:11:15,029 --> 00:11:17,480
Well, if you turn at 10%, you got

340
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,960
to sign at least 11 clients to see

341
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:21,309
positive growth.

342
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:24,139
And so as you start to grow, sales

343
00:11:24,139 --> 00:11:26,210
velocity has to continue to

344
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:27,279
increase.

345
00:11:27,419 --> 00:11:28,379
It has to pick up.

346
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:29,519
You have to sign more clients

347
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:31,059
every single month as you grow

348
00:11:31,269 --> 00:11:33,269
because churn will always weigh

349
00:11:33,269 --> 00:11:34,559
that back down.

350
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:36,250
And so you always, always, always

351
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:37,820
have to be able to outsell churn.

352
00:11:38,019 --> 00:11:39,500
And that is the hard reality of

353
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,500
agency churn.

354
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:42,450
So this is the flywheel that will

355
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:43,740
make you go rogue.

356
00:11:44,009 --> 00:11:46,210
And this is the number one reason

357
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:48,320
why people who start and have

358
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:50,389
success later on fizzle out of

359
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:51,039
their agency.

360
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,379
And it just doesn't work out for

361
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:54,799
them long term.

362
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:56,500
And it's also why Client

363
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,500
Ascension, our agency, our

364
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,429
software business list kit,

365
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,740
and all the businesses we're

366
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:03,269
involved in have been going on for

367
00:12:03,269 --> 00:12:03,759
years.

368
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,259
And every single year they've

369
00:12:05,259 --> 00:12:06,340
grown in revenue.

370
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:08,350
It's because we understand the

371
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:10,379
concept of sales velocity and we

372
00:12:10,379 --> 00:12:11,580
understand this flywheel.

373
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:12,679
And we've also lived it.

374
00:12:13,009 --> 00:12:13,960
It's also why our previous

375
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,860
agencies didn't work out, right?

376
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:18,320
So at some point in your career,

377
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,940
you're going to have to learn it.

378
00:12:20,899 --> 00:12:22,159
You might as well learn it from me

379
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:23,370
rather than having to go and

380
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:24,960
experience this yourself because

381
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:25,539
it's painful.

382
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:27,860
So number one, sign several

383
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:28,879
clients.

384
00:12:29,019 --> 00:12:29,980
You have initial success.

385
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:30,289
Great.

386
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:31,820
Then after you sign a bunch of

387
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,710
clients, you feel overwhelmed with

388
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:35,480
fulfillment issues, right?

389
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:36,740
You have a lot of clients that you

390
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:37,639
have to deliver on.

391
00:12:37,789 --> 00:12:39,289
So that puts strain on your

392
00:12:39,289 --> 00:12:40,279
operations.

393
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:41,820
And so what do you do?

394
00:12:42,029 --> 00:12:43,299
Well, you pause sales so that you

395
00:12:43,299 --> 00:12:44,919
can, quote unquote, catch up.

396
00:12:45,129 --> 00:12:47,190
And when you do this, growth

397
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:47,980
stops.

398
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:49,080
You lose momentum.

399
00:12:50,009 --> 00:12:51,500
The sales pipeline dries up.

400
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,389
You struggle to restart the sales

401
00:12:53,389 --> 00:12:55,149
engine because momentum is the

402
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:56,950
most important force that drives

403
00:12:57,019 --> 00:12:57,710
the sales engine.

404
00:12:57,879 --> 00:12:59,110
And you just completely cut the

405
00:12:59,110 --> 00:12:59,779
lights out.

406
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:01,269
And then your business fizzles

407
00:13:01,269 --> 00:13:01,679
out.

408
00:13:01,889 --> 00:13:03,840
And so this stop-start approach

409
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,000
will kill your growth potential

410
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,450
and keep you broke.

411
00:13:07,669 --> 00:13:10,120
But luckily, we're going to show

412
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,269
you today how operations can

413
00:13:12,629 --> 00:13:15,220
enable and help you to capitalize

414
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,460
on your sales velocity.

415
00:13:18,529 --> 00:13:20,320
Before I continue, I see some

416
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,559
stuff happening in the chat, all

417
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,129
right?

418
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,779
I need to know that you guys are

419
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:25,580
listening.

420
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:26,870
I need to know that you guys are

421
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:28,070
even interested in what I'm

422
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:29,200
talking about so far.

423
00:13:29,779 --> 00:13:31,759
So if you are, just please put W

424
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:33,970
in the chat, W in the chat, like

425
00:13:34,299 --> 00:13:35,769
blow it up, crash the Zoom

426
00:13:35,769 --> 00:13:37,830
servers, W in the chat all day

427
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:38,529
long.

428
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,220
I'll even start putting W in the

429
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:40,700
chat.

430
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:42,259
Any letter at this point, just

431
00:13:42,259 --> 00:13:43,259
blow up the chat.

432
00:13:43,259 --> 00:13:44,830
I want to see as many messages as

433
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:46,340
Zoom can handle just to get the

434
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,860
validation that I should keep

435
00:13:48,039 --> 00:13:48,440
going.

436
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:48,980
Okay, great.

437
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:49,970
Okay, great.

438
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:50,659
All right, we're good.

439
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:51,840
All right, guys, chill out, chill

440
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,120
out.

441
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,220
I think we might get charged for

442
00:13:53,789 --> 00:13:54,399
additional comments in the

443
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:55,320
comments section.

444
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,419
I don't know if we can afford it.

445
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:59,340
Awesome, awesome, awesome.

446
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:00,139
Okay, thank you guys.

447
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:01,690
I appreciate that because, you

448
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:02,820
know, I've sat through

449
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,299
presentations and lectures that

450
00:14:04,299 --> 00:14:05,690
for whatever reason, they're just

451
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:06,000
not hitting.

452
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:08,750
And I just need that reinforcement

453
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,929
from you guys to keep this same

454
00:14:11,289 --> 00:14:13,460
energy and keep pushing through

455
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:15,840
and show you how, at the different

456
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:17,919
businesses we've built, operations

457
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:19,730
has enabled sales philosophy.

458
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:21,570
So what this should look like is

459
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:23,480
you can continue signing clients

460
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,629
without pausing.

461
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:25,840
So you have an uninterrupted

462
00:14:26,149 --> 00:14:26,820
growth trajectory.

463
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:27,919
You can convert sales momentum

464
00:14:28,389 --> 00:14:29,639
into client success.

465
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:30,740
So meaning you can turn new

466
00:14:30,889 --> 00:14:32,090
business into long-term

467
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:33,960
relationships that actually grow.

468
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,059
And I'll show you what that looks

469
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:35,879
like later on.

470
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:38,240
Because the real math of agency

471
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,080
churn is if you can upsell to

472
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,259
cancel out churn, you actually

473
00:14:42,259 --> 00:14:44,279
don't have to worry about it as

474
00:14:44,289 --> 00:14:45,029
much.

475
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:46,139
But we'll get to that later

476
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:47,490
because you have to at least not

477
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:48,769
churn them before you can even

478
00:14:48,769 --> 00:14:50,470
start to focus on upselling them.

479
00:14:50,669 --> 00:14:52,250
And then you can maintain quality

480
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:53,100
as you scale.

481
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:54,830
So consistent delivery regardless

482
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:56,019
of the client volume.

483
00:14:56,139 --> 00:14:58,440
If I have 100 clients or 1,000

484
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,190
clients, how can I make sure that

485
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,879
the quality of my deliverables is

486
00:15:02,149 --> 00:15:02,789
consistent?

487
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,230
It's super important, but it's

488
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:05,360
also really hard to do.

489
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,610
And so the bottom line here, guys,

490
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:08,870
is you should never slow down

491
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:10,240
sales and marketing because of

492
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:11,899
fulfillment bottles, bottlenecks,

493
00:15:12,169 --> 00:15:12,529
right?

494
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:13,629
You should simply be able to

495
00:15:13,629 --> 00:15:14,340
figure it out.

496
00:15:14,509 --> 00:15:15,990
And that's, you know, something

497
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:17,460
that Daniel has coined as a term

498
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:18,879
is like the figure the fuck out

499
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:19,519
ability.

500
00:15:19,789 --> 00:15:21,399
That's like a real thing.

501
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:23,090
That is like one of the key traits

502
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:24,860
of an entrepreneur and a business

503
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:27,259
owner is what is your ability to

504
00:15:27,529 --> 00:15:29,210
just simply figure it out?

505
00:15:30,289 --> 00:15:31,960
And what I always lean on from my

506
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,789
own business experience is if

507
00:15:33,789 --> 00:15:35,529
someone else has been able to

508
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,669
figure it out, then why not me?

509
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:40,659
They're no better than I, right?

510
00:15:40,769 --> 00:15:41,759
And that's kind of the ego thing.

511
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:42,899
But that's how you can start to

512
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:44,080
leverage your ego in a really

513
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,639
healthy, really productive way.

514
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,070
And so here's what we're going to

515
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:48,440
cover.

516
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,230
Efficient client onboarding

517
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:52,159
systems and management systems

518
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:53,889
that'll create smooth client

519
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,779
experiences from day one.

520
00:15:55,889 --> 00:15:56,879
Scalable fulfillment processes

521
00:15:57,409 --> 00:15:58,820
that don't depend on you.

522
00:15:59,269 --> 00:16:00,279
So building systems that work

523
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:01,799
without your constant involvement.

524
00:16:02,009 --> 00:16:03,250
Team structures that grow with

525
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:04,139
your business.

526
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,240
And that's just basically

527
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:06,929
developing organizational

528
00:16:06,929 --> 00:16:08,879
frameworks that support expansion,

529
00:16:08,919 --> 00:16:10,000
not just retention.

530
00:16:10,289 --> 00:16:11,720
And so you may be asking, how do

531
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,379
we deliver consistent results

532
00:16:13,379 --> 00:16:14,909
while continuously adding new

533
00:16:15,269 --> 00:16:15,759
clients?

534
00:16:16,009 --> 00:16:17,809
That's really what we're talking

535
00:16:17,809 --> 00:16:18,799
about today.

536
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:20,340
I'm going to show you how you can

537
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:21,940
capitalize on the marketing and

538
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,419
sales trainings that you went

539
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,210
through Monday through Wednesday

540
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:27,200
so that you can continue adding

541
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,250
fuel to the fire and signing more

542
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:31,080
clients than you ever have.

543
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:31,820
Ready?

544
00:16:32,029 --> 00:16:32,919
Let's do it.

545
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,700
So part one is we have to

546
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:37,019
understand the client journey.

547
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:38,450
Like what should this even look

548
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:38,860
like?

549
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:40,759
When someone pays us money for a

550
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:42,799
service, we close them on a sales

551
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:43,399
call.

552
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:45,000
What should the journey look like

553
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:45,720
from there?

554
00:16:45,929 --> 00:16:47,399
And if we look at it in like the

555
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:49,320
simplest form, it's onboarding,

556
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,529
which is first impressions and

557
00:16:50,889 --> 00:16:51,490
getting them set up.

558
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:53,720
It's implementation, which is just

559
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,210
executing on the strategy or the

560
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:56,559
service they sign up for.

561
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:59,190
It's optimization, refining for

562
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:01,059
even better results.

563
00:17:01,269 --> 00:17:03,379
And then growth, finding new ways

564
00:17:03,379 --> 00:17:05,619
to help, essentially expanding

565
00:17:05,838 --> 00:17:06,480
success.

566
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,578
And so that's like at the highest

567
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:09,299
level what the client journey

568
00:17:09,299 --> 00:17:10,279
should look like.

569
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:12,400
And if we dive into specifically

570
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,150
onboarding, I like to use a

571
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:16,759
framework called the 24 activation

572
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:17,720
framework.

573
00:17:18,029 --> 00:17:19,880
And there's three steps to it.

574
00:17:20,009 --> 00:17:21,818
So one, the critical time frame is

575
00:17:21,818 --> 00:17:23,990
that the first 24 hours determine

576
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:26,088
the entire client relationship.

577
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:27,140
And I couldn't stress the

578
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:28,119
importance of this.

579
00:17:28,328 --> 00:17:30,569
Like quite literally, you win or

580
00:17:30,569 --> 00:17:32,930
lose a client for life within the

581
00:17:33,289 --> 00:17:34,710
first 24 hours.

582
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:37,970
You can do everything right, you

583
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:39,210
know, a week into the client

584
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:40,079
relationship.

585
00:17:40,279 --> 00:17:42,099
But if that first 24 hours, you

586
00:17:42,099 --> 00:17:43,779
know, didn't knock out their

587
00:17:43,779 --> 00:17:46,259
buyer's remorse, you already lost

588
00:17:46,279 --> 00:17:46,849
them.

589
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:49,319
It's really hard to recover, to

590
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:50,990
build trust back after

591
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,529
expectations didn't meet reality

592
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:55,849
immediately after they paid us

593
00:17:55,849 --> 00:17:56,670
money.

594
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:59,029
And then there's a psychological

595
00:17:59,029 --> 00:18:01,359
factor to this as well, right?

596
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:03,000
Buyer's remorse kicks in quickly.

597
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:04,500
We've all experienced this on

598
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,180
purchasing decisions that we've

599
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,039
made, right?

600
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:08,900
And so you must counter it with

601
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,599
immediate engagement.

602
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,769
So when someone pays you money for

603
00:18:12,769 --> 00:18:15,180
a service, those first 24 hours

604
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:17,180
are of utmost importance.

605
00:18:18,089 --> 00:18:20,650
And ultimately, what we want to do

606
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:23,039
in those first 24 hours is

607
00:18:23,049 --> 00:18:25,690
obviously get them onboarded and

608
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:28,039
started into the fulfillment

609
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:28,789
cycle.

610
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:31,119
But at the same time, be super

611
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:33,680
careful by avoiding what customers

612
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,960
hate more than anything else,

613
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:38,450
which is unknowns, surprises, and

614
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:40,210
repeating themselves.

615
00:18:41,089 --> 00:18:42,269
Okay, this is something I've

616
00:18:42,269 --> 00:18:43,769
learned from one of my mentors,

617
00:18:43,769 --> 00:18:45,339
Lincoln Murphy, on the customer

618
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:46,690
success side of things.

619
00:18:46,869 --> 00:18:48,109
And he's identified these are

620
00:18:48,109 --> 00:18:49,700
three things that customers hate

621
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:50,339
the most.

622
00:18:50,549 --> 00:18:52,740
Unknowns, surprises, and repeating

623
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,240
themselves, right?

624
00:18:54,359 --> 00:18:55,559
So if they pay you money and

625
00:18:55,559 --> 00:18:57,000
they're surprised that they

626
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,619
haven't heard from anyone on our

627
00:18:58,619 --> 00:19:00,299
team about what the next steps are

628
00:19:00,369 --> 00:19:02,049
for two days, customers hate that

629
00:19:02,289 --> 00:19:03,750
more than anything else.

630
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,420
Or the unknown of what happens

631
00:19:05,819 --> 00:19:07,119
after I pay them money.

632
00:19:07,329 --> 00:19:08,220
What do I need to do?

633
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:09,140
What are they doing?

634
00:19:09,339 --> 00:19:10,559
When is this all going to start?

635
00:19:10,769 --> 00:19:12,000
When am I going to see results?

636
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:13,619
They hate that.

637
00:19:13,769 --> 00:19:15,769
Or if onboarding kind of overlaps

638
00:19:15,769 --> 00:19:17,930
with the sales process and you ask

639
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:20,059
them the same questions, and you

640
00:19:20,099 --> 00:19:21,980
already have this information from

641
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:23,349
the sales call, and you're just

642
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:24,529
making them repeat themselves.

643
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,559
And they hate those things more

644
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:26,380
than anything else.

645
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,880
So when you're looking at your

646
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,559
entire onboarding process, ask

647
00:19:29,559 --> 00:19:31,190
yourself, do I have anything in

648
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,519
this process that creates

649
00:19:32,519 --> 00:19:33,309
unknowns?

650
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:34,849
Do I have anything in this process

651
00:19:34,849 --> 00:19:36,210
that makes them surprised in a

652
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:37,039
negative way?

653
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,140
And do I have anything in the

654
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:39,640
process that makes them repeat

655
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,440
themselves?

656
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:42,259
And if I do, how can I weed those

657
00:19:42,259 --> 00:19:44,240
out and get rid of them, right?

658
00:19:44,339 --> 00:19:45,980
So again, the first 24 hours, so,

659
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:47,309
so, so important to any client

660
00:19:47,309 --> 00:19:48,220
relationship.

661
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:50,359
And so here's the action plan in a

662
00:19:50,359 --> 00:19:52,140
little bit more detail.

663
00:19:52,279 --> 00:19:54,160
So immediately upon them signing

664
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,869
up, I'll send them a welcome

665
00:19:55,869 --> 00:19:56,950
email, right?

666
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:58,660
This is like immediately after

667
00:19:58,660 --> 00:19:59,339
payment.

668
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:00,799
And this should ideally be an

669
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,490
intro from the salesperson to the

670
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:03,799
fulfillment person.

671
00:20:04,009 --> 00:20:05,430
And so the handoff is super

672
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:06,380
important.

673
00:20:06,549 --> 00:20:08,359
In an agency or a B2B sales

674
00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:10,809
process, like a phone call sales

675
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,970
process, typically the person that

676
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:14,769
closes them is different from the

677
00:20:14,809 --> 00:20:16,349
person that'll do the service

678
00:20:16,359 --> 00:20:17,079
delivery.

679
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:18,819
And so you want to bridge that

680
00:20:18,819 --> 00:20:19,279
gap.

681
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:21,000
You want that to be a really

682
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,029
smooth handoff and a really smooth

683
00:20:23,029 --> 00:20:25,099
transition because it's all about

684
00:20:25,109 --> 00:20:26,799
relationships when it comes to

685
00:20:26,829 --> 00:20:28,799
agencies, you know, services and

686
00:20:28,809 --> 00:20:29,799
fulfillment.

687
00:20:30,029 --> 00:20:31,750
And if you abruptly swap out the

688
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,839
person who they're used to having

689
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:35,680
that relationship with in the

690
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:37,869
sales process, with someone in the

691
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:39,690
fulfillment process that they just

692
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,529
don't know anything about, that

693
00:20:41,529 --> 00:20:43,279
can really fall off the rails

694
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,000
quickly.

695
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,119
The second thing they need is

696
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:47,500
clear direction, right?

697
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,690
So including specific next steps,

698
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:51,500
not just we'll be in touch.

699
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:53,650
Like the first thing you send them

700
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:55,180
should have a very clear

701
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:57,299
step-by-step, you know, set of

702
00:20:57,309 --> 00:20:58,539
instructions.

703
00:20:58,759 --> 00:21:00,220
For us, it's really as simple as

704
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:01,809
fill out the onboarding form,

705
00:21:01,809 --> 00:21:03,279
number one, and then book an

706
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,920
onboarding call, number two,

707
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:05,569
right?

708
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:06,890
So you don't want to give them a

709
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:08,289
bunch of steps, but at least give

710
00:21:08,289 --> 00:21:09,589
them one or two things to work on

711
00:21:09,589 --> 00:21:10,400
immediately.

712
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,750
So as soon as they pay, they fill

713
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,099
out the onboarding form and book

714
00:21:13,099 --> 00:21:14,140
an onboarding call.

715
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:15,829
And then on the onboarding call,

716
00:21:15,829 --> 00:21:17,599
we can continue making progress on

717
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:18,950
the client journey that we looked

718
00:21:19,309 --> 00:21:20,730
at at the very beginning.

719
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:22,779
Then you want to get some, you

720
00:21:22,779 --> 00:21:24,099
know, really simple things set up,

721
00:21:24,099 --> 00:21:25,279
like communication and project

722
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:25,980
management.

723
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:27,630
So like I would set up a Slack

724
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:29,680
workspace and potentially like a

725
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,430
Trello or a ClickUp or a Notion

726
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,789
board for them to track progress.

727
00:21:34,009 --> 00:21:34,900
Then you want to gather

728
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:36,259
information.

729
00:21:36,259 --> 00:21:37,359
So again, like the onboarding form

730
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:38,400
is where we're gathering

731
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,079
information.

732
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,869
But we should also see, again,

733
00:21:41,869 --> 00:21:43,359
knowing that customers hate

734
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:45,029
repeating themselves, we should

735
00:21:45,369 --> 00:21:46,809
see what information we could get

736
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:48,460
from the sales call so we can take

737
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:50,109
out questions that we'd otherwise

738
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,640
ask in the onboarding form.

739
00:21:51,869 --> 00:21:52,759
Because we don't want to make them

740
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,079
do more work than they need to.

741
00:21:54,289 --> 00:21:54,940
Okay.

742
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,640
But information gathering is super

743
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,319
important.

744
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,019
And then get to that first meeting

745
00:21:59,019 --> 00:22:00,240
as soon as possible.

746
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:02,049
That first meeting is the

747
00:22:02,049 --> 00:22:03,559
onboarding call.

748
00:22:03,769 --> 00:22:05,789
And ideally, the onboarding form

749
00:22:05,789 --> 00:22:07,559
and the onboarding call get

750
00:22:08,259 --> 00:22:09,720
completed while they're still on

751
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:10,960
the sales call.

752
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:12,509
So if you have like a one-call

753
00:22:12,509 --> 00:22:14,089
close or if your sales process

754
00:22:14,089 --> 00:22:15,799
collects payments on the actual

755
00:22:15,799 --> 00:22:18,420
sales call, you should stay on

756
00:22:18,589 --> 00:22:21,930
them for another five minutes and

757
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,250
just have them fill out the

758
00:22:23,619 --> 00:22:25,019
onboarding form with your guidance

759
00:22:25,029 --> 00:22:27,309
and book an onboarding call before

760
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:28,930
hopping off.

761
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:30,319
Like you already have them there.

762
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:31,529
You already have their undivided

763
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:32,099
attention.

764
00:22:32,769 --> 00:22:33,700
Why wait for them to get an

765
00:22:34,279 --> 00:22:35,279
automated email from us with the

766
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:36,019
next steps?

767
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:37,009
Why not just get the process

768
00:22:37,019 --> 00:22:38,259
started right then and there?

769
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:40,339
And then resource access.

770
00:22:40,519 --> 00:22:42,000
You want to provide them access to

771
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,460
resources and trainings.

772
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,099
And you want these to be tailored

773
00:22:45,099 --> 00:22:46,740
towards best practices that the

774
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,269
clients need to implement to see

775
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:49,119
results.

776
00:22:49,259 --> 00:22:50,799
So for example, we ran a cold

777
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:51,799
email agency.

778
00:22:52,009 --> 00:22:53,799
And we knew that even though we

779
00:22:53,799 --> 00:22:56,140
would book calls for our clients,

780
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:58,390
they needed a really good offer.

781
00:22:58,569 --> 00:22:59,740
And they needed a really good

782
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:00,640
sales process.

783
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:02,670
So while setting everything else

784
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:04,539
up, we gave them access to free

785
00:23:04,539 --> 00:23:06,500
training for offer creation and

786
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,230
free training for sales call

787
00:23:08,369 --> 00:23:10,150
training from Dan so that when our

788
00:23:10,349 --> 00:23:12,450
service actually started, we knew

789
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,960
we're promoting a good offer

790
00:23:14,029 --> 00:23:15,230
through cold email.

791
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:16,339
And we knew if we got a call

792
00:23:16,759 --> 00:23:18,069
booked, they'd have an increased

793
00:23:18,069 --> 00:23:20,019
likelihood of actually closing it.

794
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,609
And so overarching, the three

795
00:23:21,609 --> 00:23:23,450
pillars of an effective onboarding

796
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:25,200
process is removing friction.

797
00:23:25,609 --> 00:23:27,109
So making everything as simple and

798
00:23:27,109 --> 00:23:28,160
clear as possible.

799
00:23:28,359 --> 00:23:29,890
One of the best ways to do that is

800
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:31,640
by doing it right then and there

801
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,319
on the sales call after you've

802
00:23:33,329 --> 00:23:34,750
collected payment.

803
00:23:34,869 --> 00:23:36,289
If you can't do it, then make it,

804
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:37,880
you know, an automated follow-up

805
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,359
email after payments collected

806
00:23:39,539 --> 00:23:41,160
with just really clear next steps.

807
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,259
It's like two simple things like

808
00:23:42,359 --> 00:23:43,400
an onboarding form and a kickoff

809
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:43,799
call.

810
00:23:44,009 --> 00:23:46,839
Focus on time to value.

811
00:23:47,049 --> 00:23:49,140
Like how can you get results

812
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:50,160
quickly?

813
00:23:50,369 --> 00:23:52,720
And it doesn't have to be like the

814
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,579
North Star results.

815
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:55,819
Like if you're doing cold email,

816
00:23:55,819 --> 00:23:57,660
the result doesn't necessarily

817
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:59,319
need to be you have to get them a

818
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:01,339
client from cold email, you know,

819
00:24:01,349 --> 00:24:02,819
during onboarding.

820
00:24:03,019 --> 00:24:04,700
No, but like if we can show them

821
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,400
progress, progress is more

822
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,059
important than results.

823
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,049
If we can show them that the first

824
00:24:10,049 --> 00:24:12,000
email was sent out, then that's

825
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:12,910
time to value.

826
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:14,769
So you want to map out like what

827
00:24:14,769 --> 00:24:16,579
are the different activation or

828
00:24:16,579 --> 00:24:18,279
value points along the way.

829
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:20,170
So for cold email agency offering,

830
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:21,700
it could literally be we wrote

831
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,519
scripts that they're happy with.

832
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:24,720
We built them a leads list that

833
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:25,680
they're happy with.

834
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:27,500
We sent the first email.

835
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:29,920
We got the first reply.

836
00:24:30,309 --> 00:24:32,069
We booked the first meeting and we

837
00:24:32,069 --> 00:24:33,559
closed the first deal.

838
00:24:33,769 --> 00:24:35,230
Those are like six different steps

839
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:36,059
along the way.

840
00:24:36,269 --> 00:24:37,750
And we can celebrate each and

841
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:39,359
every single one of them as a

842
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:40,869
valuable step and a valuable

843
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:42,549
progress milestone.

844
00:24:42,769 --> 00:24:44,519
And then we want to reward desired

845
00:24:44,519 --> 00:24:45,339
behavior.

846
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,420
So again, if we know that if our

847
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:49,509
customers go through our sales

848
00:24:50,119 --> 00:24:51,450
training, it increases the

849
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:53,509
likelihood that they get an ROI

850
00:24:53,549 --> 00:24:55,869
from our cold email services.

851
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,740
We want to reward the behavior of

852
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:01,099
going through our sales training.

853
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,200
So we might say something along

854
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:03,460
the lines of like if you go

855
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:04,930
through Dan's sales call training

856
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:06,230
before we launch our cold email

857
00:25:06,269 --> 00:25:08,140
campaigns, you know, we'll give

858
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:09,900
you some additional leads for

859
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:10,450
free.

860
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:13,380
Or we'll give you $100 off your

861
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:15,720
next subscription payment or we'll

862
00:25:15,759 --> 00:25:17,880
give you some free bonus or reward

863
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:19,049
of some sort.

864
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:20,180
We'll unlock another training

865
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:21,720
resource for you, right?

866
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,390
It doesn't even have to be

867
00:25:22,539 --> 00:25:22,819
monetary.

868
00:25:23,019 --> 00:25:24,490
But you want to reward desired

869
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:26,240
behaviors and remind them that

870
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,250
doing these things will ultimately

871
00:25:28,259 --> 00:25:29,859
help them get the results that

872
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:30,630
they want.

873
00:25:32,569 --> 00:25:33,819
So let's get even deeper into

874
00:25:33,819 --> 00:25:34,720
these, right?

875
00:25:34,809 --> 00:25:35,579
So remove friction.

876
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:37,339
So step-by-step instructions with

877
00:25:37,339 --> 00:25:38,819
visuals, like clear guidance

878
00:25:38,819 --> 00:25:40,450
that's easy to follow, similar to

879
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:41,500
this presentation.

880
00:25:41,849 --> 00:25:43,470
Assume they know nothing about

881
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:44,500
your process.

882
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:46,250
So like explain as much as you can

883
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:47,339
without jargon.

884
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:48,380
Like you don't want to try to

885
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:49,019
sound smart.

886
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:50,119
You just want them to understand

887
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:51,400
what you're actually saying,

888
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:51,839
right?

889
00:25:52,099 --> 00:25:53,640
So a lot of us like to use, you

890
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,250
know, big words like sales

891
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:57,140
qualified leads because we think

892
00:25:57,349 --> 00:25:59,000
it sounds cool, but like you have

893
00:25:59,269 --> 00:26:00,579
to understand they're not

894
00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:02,660
registering what that means a lot

895
00:26:02,819 --> 00:26:03,759
of the times.

896
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,430
So dumb it down and just make sure

897
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:07,170
they understand everything that

898
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:08,569
you're explaining about the

899
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:09,309
process.

900
00:26:09,529 --> 00:26:11,559
Use tools they're already familiar

901
00:26:11,559 --> 00:26:13,809
with to minimize learning curves,

902
00:26:14,099 --> 00:26:14,480
right?

903
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:16,279
Break complex tasks into smaller

904
00:26:16,279 --> 00:26:16,819
steps.

905
00:26:17,029 --> 00:26:17,859
Again, like make progress

906
00:26:17,869 --> 00:26:18,500
manageable.

907
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:20,059
This is key for lowering turn.

908
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:21,730
Always give them something to look

909
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:23,269
forward to so that they're feeling

910
00:26:23,269 --> 00:26:24,880
like they're making progress.

911
00:26:25,019 --> 00:26:26,819
So if there's one big step, like

912
00:26:26,819 --> 00:26:28,700
launch a cold email campaign,

913
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,720
break that down into build a leads

914
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,839
list, right?

915
00:26:32,059 --> 00:26:34,680
By identifying your ICP, write a

916
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:37,390
cold email script, refine your

917
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:40,299
offer, set up email accounts, do

918
00:26:40,309 --> 00:26:43,579
warmup, like break complex stacks

919
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:45,700
into smaller steps.

920
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,880
And then always end communication.

921
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:49,720
This is like the number one line

922
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,400
that you guys should be using in

923
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,220
your client communications is the

924
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,630
next step is you need to provide

925
00:26:55,769 --> 00:26:57,549
clear direction forward and

926
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:59,849
specify who's responsible.

927
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:01,599
You are the client and have due

928
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:03,180
dates like operation systems

929
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:04,119
fulfillment.

930
00:27:04,299 --> 00:27:06,140
It's all about clarity.

931
00:27:06,259 --> 00:27:07,809
At the end of the day, there's no

932
00:27:07,809 --> 00:27:09,079
room for obscurity.

933
00:27:09,289 --> 00:27:11,380
Obscurity only leads to chaos and

934
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,410
chaos leads to churn and churn

935
00:27:13,819 --> 00:27:15,670
leads to you not having a business

936
00:27:15,849 --> 00:27:16,670
anymore.

937
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:17,440
Okay.

938
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:20,160
And so always end communications,

939
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,250
whether it's an email or call with

940
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:23,779
here's the next step because

941
00:27:24,049 --> 00:27:25,980
there's always a next step.

942
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:27,750
But you also need to clearly

943
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:29,829
identify who's responsible for

944
00:27:29,829 --> 00:27:31,640
that step and when are the due

945
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:32,380
dates.

946
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:34,869
And remember, bottom line, confuse

947
00:27:34,869 --> 00:27:36,339
clients, don't become long-term

948
00:27:36,339 --> 00:27:36,920
clients.

949
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:37,359
All right.

950
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:40,849
I see some questions, hands being

951
00:27:40,849 --> 00:27:41,980
raised.

952
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:42,839
I'm not going to stop for

953
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:43,500
questions.

954
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:45,750
So please, if you have a question,

955
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:47,400
write it in the Q&A box.

956
00:27:48,569 --> 00:27:50,000
There's a Q&A feature in Zoom.

957
00:27:50,099 --> 00:27:52,710
I already see one question from

958
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:54,809
Fabrico or Fabricio.

959
00:27:55,029 --> 00:27:57,329
Apologies if I'm getting that name

960
00:27:57,329 --> 00:27:59,670
pronunciation wrong, but I only

961
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:01,630
see one question in Q&A.

962
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,900
I'll do Q&A after the presentation

963
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:04,660
is done.

964
00:28:04,869 --> 00:28:06,890
And so please use the Q&A feature

965
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:09,109
in Zoom and I'll go through those

966
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,150
questions at the very end for

967
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:12,059
whatever time we have left.

968
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:14,779
But we're going to continue.

969
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:16,789
So pillar number two, deliver

970
00:28:16,789 --> 00:28:18,700
immediate value, right?

971
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:20,109
So create quick win deliverables

972
00:28:20,109 --> 00:28:21,319
in the first week, tangible

973
00:28:21,319 --> 00:28:22,819
results that build confidence,

974
00:28:22,819 --> 00:28:24,559
like sending that first email out

975
00:28:24,829 --> 00:28:26,460
or getting that first reply or

976
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:28,210
giving them access to super

977
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:31,759
valuable, world-changing training,

978
00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:32,619
right?

979
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:34,789
On how to build no-brainer offers,

980
00:28:34,789 --> 00:28:36,880
like something that Daniel offers

981
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,519
to our cold email clients that

982
00:28:38,789 --> 00:28:40,250
they love because his offers

983
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:43,000
training is world-changing, right?

984
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:44,680
Like it changes up everything they

985
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,309
thought about business and their

986
00:28:46,309 --> 00:28:46,859
offer.

987
00:28:47,019 --> 00:28:48,460
And you guys have experienced that

988
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:49,119
on Monday.

989
00:28:49,299 --> 00:28:50,690
You also want to identify, you

990
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:52,460
want to show progress before their

991
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:53,930
subscription renewals or just

992
00:28:54,289 --> 00:28:55,559
validating their investment

993
00:28:55,599 --> 00:28:56,930
because not only did like the

994
00:28:57,170 --> 00:28:58,569
salesperson close them on the

995
00:28:58,609 --> 00:29:00,029
call, but you have to close them

996
00:29:00,299 --> 00:29:01,349
every month, right?

997
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:03,289
Because they're making a decision

998
00:29:03,289 --> 00:29:04,670
typically on a month-to-month

999
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:05,890
basis whether or not this is

1000
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:06,549
worthwhile.

1001
00:29:06,869 --> 00:29:08,099
And so, yeah, just because you

1002
00:29:08,099 --> 00:29:09,549
close them on a sales call doesn't

1003
00:29:09,549 --> 00:29:10,420
mean it's over.

1004
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:12,210
You're always selling them on

1005
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:12,980
staying.

1006
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:14,079
And a lot of times you're selling

1007
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:15,930
them on paying you more money for

1008
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:17,079
expanded services.

1009
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:19,750
And so, keep in mind when those

1010
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:21,970
subscriptions renew because that's

1011
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:23,960
essentially a deadline for you to

1012
00:29:24,049 --> 00:29:25,990
make sure that their investment is

1013
00:29:26,019 --> 00:29:28,059
proven as a good investment.

1014
00:29:28,269 --> 00:29:30,450
You want to identify what clients

1015
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:32,119
value most up front.

1016
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:33,960
So, this is a great question in

1017
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,759
your onboarding forms and on your

1018
00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:37,460
kickoff calls is focusing on what

1019
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,319
they care about and prioritize.

1020
00:29:39,769 --> 00:29:41,589
And like I said, ask them, what

1021
00:29:41,589 --> 00:29:43,799
are their most important goals and

1022
00:29:43,799 --> 00:29:45,700
what would they consider?

1023
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:47,309
What would they need to see happen

1024
00:29:47,309 --> 00:29:48,619
to consider this a win?

1025
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:51,400
You want to demonstrate competence

1026
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,079
through early action.

1027
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:54,700
So, prove your expertise quickly

1028
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:56,150
even when results are not there

1029
00:29:56,150 --> 00:29:57,609
because results are not always

1030
00:29:57,859 --> 00:29:57,890
there.

1031
00:29:58,349 --> 00:30:00,490
And if the only way someone stays

1032
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:02,910
on versus churns is whether or not

1033
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:05,380
you're getting results, your churn

1034
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:06,750
is going to be through the roof.

1035
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:09,369
You have to get them focused on

1036
00:30:09,369 --> 00:30:11,569
progress over results.

1037
00:30:11,869 --> 00:30:13,130
Results will ultimately be there

1038
00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:14,599
and you need to generate results,

1039
00:30:14,599 --> 00:30:15,960
but you need to buy yourself some

1040
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,380
time to do it because it's not

1041
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:19,099
realistic to get results right

1042
00:30:19,099 --> 00:30:19,529
away.

1043
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:21,259
So, there's got to be some element

1044
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:22,789
of patience, but there has to be

1045
00:30:22,789 --> 00:30:24,480
progress milestones along the way.

1046
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:26,640
And that's really that last one.

1047
00:30:26,829 --> 00:30:27,740
Just set realistic expectations

1048
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:29,180
about bigger milestones.

1049
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:30,789
Balance quick wins with long-term

1050
00:30:30,789 --> 00:30:31,299
goals.

1051
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:34,220
It's all about making progress.

1052
00:30:34,329 --> 00:30:35,740
So, early wins, build trust for

1053
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:37,269
the longer journey, especially

1054
00:30:37,269 --> 00:30:39,029
when proper expectations are set.

1055
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:42,490
Pillar three, rewarding desired

1056
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:43,839
behavior.

1057
00:30:43,839 --> 00:30:44,940
So, acknowledge when clients

1058
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:45,819
follow your process.

1059
00:30:46,029 --> 00:30:47,410
Again, positive reinforcement for

1060
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:48,160
cooperation.

1061
00:30:49,089 --> 00:30:49,880
Celebrate their engagement and

1062
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:50,559
participation.

1063
00:30:50,769 --> 00:30:52,430
Highlight how their actions

1064
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:54,059
accelerate results.

1065
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:55,809
This is one of the best lines in

1066
00:30:55,809 --> 00:30:57,630
the entire presentation is you

1067
00:30:57,630 --> 00:30:59,589
want to connect their behavior to

1068
00:30:59,589 --> 00:31:00,390
outcomes.

1069
00:31:00,609 --> 00:31:01,220
Right?

1070
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:03,109
This is the best way to train not

1071
00:31:03,109 --> 00:31:05,289
just your clients, but also, like

1072
00:31:05,289 --> 00:31:07,559
I say here, remember these steps

1073
00:31:07,609 --> 00:31:08,809
when hiring.

1074
00:31:09,019 --> 00:31:10,490
The best way to get your team to

1075
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:12,380
do the things you know they should

1076
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:13,630
be doing to get the desired

1077
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:15,589
outcome is show them how certain

1078
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:17,210
behaviors track to certain

1079
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:18,130
outcomes.

1080
00:31:18,349 --> 00:31:19,099
Right?

1081
00:31:19,309 --> 00:31:20,420
Rather than saying, hey, you

1082
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,700
should go through this offers

1083
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:23,069
training just because I want you

1084
00:31:23,069 --> 00:31:23,910
to go through this offers

1085
00:31:24,269 --> 00:31:24,759
training.

1086
00:31:25,029 --> 00:31:26,289
You need to show them how going

1087
00:31:26,289 --> 00:31:27,980
through the offers training makes

1088
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:29,480
them more money because that's

1089
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,180
really what they care about.

1090
00:31:31,309 --> 00:31:32,029
They don't care about the offers

1091
00:31:32,029 --> 00:31:32,440
training.

1092
00:31:32,619 --> 00:31:33,539
They care about making more money

1093
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:34,890
and they'll do anything you tell

1094
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:35,970
them to do that increases the

1095
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:37,140
likelihood of them making more

1096
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:37,619
money.

1097
00:31:37,829 --> 00:31:38,480
Right?

1098
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,789
So this is like psychological and

1099
00:31:40,789 --> 00:31:41,880
it's super important.

1100
00:31:42,069 --> 00:31:42,980
And then you want to create

1101
00:31:43,299 --> 00:31:44,769
incentives for completing

1102
00:31:44,769 --> 00:31:46,369
onboarding steps because you

1103
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:48,039
cannot start the service or the

1104
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:49,690
engagement if you don't get them

1105
00:31:49,930 --> 00:31:51,180
through onboarding.

1106
00:31:51,319 --> 00:31:53,119
So stuff like small discounts on

1107
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:54,980
their next renewal or access to

1108
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:57,039
bonus trainings, these are, you

1109
00:31:57,309 --> 00:31:58,990
know, really nice things you can

1110
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:00,900
do to just unlock, like we call

1111
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:02,819
them unlockables, right?

1112
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:04,299
If you complete these steps,

1113
00:32:04,299 --> 00:32:05,740
you'll unlock free content or

1114
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:07,240
you'll unlock free credits for

1115
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:07,670
ListKit.

1116
00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:10,660
And again, what gets rewarded gets

1117
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:11,680
repeated.

1118
00:32:11,779 --> 00:32:13,039
If they do something and they get

1119
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:14,549
something for it, they're going to

1120
00:32:14,549 --> 00:32:15,839
do that thing more often.

1121
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,359
And again, this becomes especially

1122
00:32:18,359 --> 00:32:20,150
relevant when you're hiring and

1123
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:21,730
managing teams, right?

1124
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,140
Not just client relationships.

1125
00:32:23,349 --> 00:32:24,240
Okay?

1126
00:32:24,579 --> 00:32:26,759
I'm going to stop for water.

1127
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:29,279
If you're still with me, let's do

1128
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:31,809
that thing we did about blowing up

1129
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:33,200
the Zoom chat.

1130
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,710
W is in the chat while I take a

1131
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:35,640
sip of water.

1132
00:32:35,849 --> 00:32:36,119
Thank you.

1133
00:32:36,259 --> 00:32:36,349
Thank you.

1134
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:41,240
All right, man.

1135
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,400
Way more people here than I

1136
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:43,920
originally thought would be.

1137
00:32:44,619 --> 00:32:45,450
And it's great to see some

1138
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:46,700
familiar names out there.

1139
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:49,160
So thank you all for the support

1140
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,799
and for the attention that you're

1141
00:32:51,869 --> 00:32:52,559
giving.

1142
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:53,819
Because this is super important

1143
00:32:53,819 --> 00:32:54,400
stuff, guys.

1144
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,089
I know marketing and sales is way

1145
00:32:56,089 --> 00:32:57,910
more sexy than onboarding systems

1146
00:32:57,910 --> 00:32:59,059
and fulfillment.

1147
00:32:59,269 --> 00:33:00,950
But you can't have marketing and

1148
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:02,799
sales without fulfillment.

1149
00:33:03,009 --> 00:33:03,900
You just can't.

1150
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:04,339
Okay?

1151
00:33:04,509 --> 00:33:05,440
You need all of them.

1152
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:07,539
And so you can't drop the ball

1153
00:33:07,539 --> 00:33:09,730
after going through Daniel,

1154
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,420
Christian, and Dan's training.

1155
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:14,559
You won't have a business for very

1156
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:15,539
long if you do.

1157
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:17,869
So even if this stuff is boring or

1158
00:33:17,869 --> 00:33:20,349
if this stuff is hard, it's what's

1159
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:21,400
required.

1160
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:23,410
And so let's get into part two,

1161
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:25,640
the weekly engagement system.

1162
00:33:25,769 --> 00:33:27,519
So weekly engagement is just like

1163
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:29,269
how are you communicating with

1164
00:33:29,269 --> 00:33:30,279
your clients?

1165
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:32,299
Number one, you need proactive

1166
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,309
communication, like regular touch

1167
00:33:34,309 --> 00:33:34,880
points.

1168
00:33:35,089 --> 00:33:37,119
You need, and the key word here is

1169
00:33:37,119 --> 00:33:39,039
proactive, not reactive,

1170
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:40,039
proactive.

1171
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:41,660
You need progress tracking.

1172
00:33:41,869 --> 00:33:43,380
Again, not results tracking.

1173
00:33:43,589 --> 00:33:45,279
Progress tracking.

1174
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:47,150
Measuring results and important

1175
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:47,660
KPIs.

1176
00:33:47,869 --> 00:33:49,799
Expectations management.

1177
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:51,819
Aligning their perceptions with

1178
00:33:51,819 --> 00:33:53,819
reality or what's realistic.

1179
00:33:54,549 --> 00:33:55,720
And then relationship building.

1180
00:33:55,869 --> 00:33:57,140
How can you strengthen trust?

1181
00:33:57,349 --> 00:33:59,819
Because when results aren't there

1182
00:33:59,819 --> 00:34:02,569
or progress is not there, what you

1183
00:34:02,579 --> 00:34:04,950
do to build the relationship

1184
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:06,849
is what will keep them hanging

1185
00:34:06,849 --> 00:34:08,800
around longer than they really

1186
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,500
should.

1187
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:11,449
Longer than what's smart for their

1188
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:12,260
business.

1189
00:34:12,469 --> 00:34:14,000
And so remember that.

1190
00:34:15,949 --> 00:34:17,530
The number one mistake that kills

1191
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:20,090
client retention that I see, even

1192
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:21,519
if you get onboarding correct,

1193
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:23,800
is silence, right?

1194
00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:26,530
Your silence, your communication

1195
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:28,329
gaps, or your unwillingness to

1196
00:34:28,579 --> 00:34:29,659
communicate with your clients

1197
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:31,480
creates uncertainty.

1198
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:33,340
It also leaves room for them to

1199
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:35,380
have a dialogue with themselves

1200
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:37,139
where negative assumptions could

1201
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:38,289
be formed, right?

1202
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:39,980
They assume nothing's happening.

1203
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:41,750
They question if their investment

1204
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:42,460
was smart.

1205
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:44,260
They start looking elsewhere and

1206
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:45,199
they get FOMO.

1207
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:46,730
Like, man, I should have went with

1208
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:48,119
that agency instead because I keep

1209
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:49,260
seeing their case studies

1210
00:34:49,469 --> 00:34:51,079
and they lose confidence in the

1211
00:34:51,079 --> 00:34:51,800
results.

1212
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:54,400
And so by the time they actually

1213
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,980
express this concern, it's too

1214
00:34:57,199 --> 00:34:57,659
late.

1215
00:34:58,070 --> 00:34:59,900
Because usually this concern

1216
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:02,099
festers for a long period of time

1217
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:04,630
before they will share it with

1218
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,360
you because it's hard for them.

1219
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:07,980
They don't want to have conflict

1220
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,380
with a service provider.

1221
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:10,480
So they'll keep it to themselves

1222
00:35:11,039 --> 00:35:12,820
until they just can't anymore.

1223
00:35:13,019 --> 00:35:14,360
You never want to get to that

1224
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:14,980
point.

1225
00:35:15,159 --> 00:35:16,539
And the way you don't get to that

1226
00:35:16,539 --> 00:35:18,159
point is you become proactive in

1227
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:19,320
your communication,

1228
00:35:19,530 --> 00:35:20,420
not reactive.

1229
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:22,139
And one of the easiest ways to do

1230
00:35:22,139 --> 00:35:23,579
this is weekly updates.

1231
00:35:23,789 --> 00:35:25,969
And weekly updates doesn't have to

1232
00:35:25,969 --> 00:35:27,519
be anything crazy.

1233
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:29,400
It can just be wins and progress,

1234
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,019
right?

1235
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:31,760
Like KPIs and metrics that matter.

1236
00:35:31,969 --> 00:35:33,619
Work status.

1237
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,019
Like, what work did you complete?

1238
00:35:35,519 --> 00:35:36,619
What are you currently working on?

1239
00:35:36,809 --> 00:35:38,159
And then future planning.

1240
00:35:38,369 --> 00:35:39,260
What are some upcoming progress

1241
00:35:39,639 --> 00:35:40,400
milestones?

1242
00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:42,769
And what are some upcoming action

1243
00:35:42,769 --> 00:35:43,500
items?

1244
00:35:44,119 --> 00:35:46,039
So what's important here is the

1245
00:35:46,039 --> 00:35:48,440
consistency of your communication

1246
00:35:48,739 --> 00:35:50,550
with clients is more important

1247
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,820
than the format and how you're

1248
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:53,099
communicating with them.

1249
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:54,929
And novelty is important as well

1250
00:35:54,929 --> 00:35:56,559
to keep things exciting.

1251
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:57,969
You don't want to communicate in a

1252
00:35:57,969 --> 00:35:59,619
way that's super robotic, right?

1253
00:35:59,829 --> 00:36:01,090
Like you want your personality to

1254
00:36:01,090 --> 00:36:01,920
shine through.

1255
00:36:03,699 --> 00:36:05,170
The way to deliver this, it's

1256
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:07,059
really just figuring out, like,

1257
00:36:07,059 --> 00:36:08,179
where are they most responsive?

1258
00:36:08,389 --> 00:36:09,280
That's going to be their preferred

1259
00:36:09,769 --> 00:36:10,300
method.

1260
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:12,199
Whether it's email, whether it's

1261
00:36:12,199 --> 00:36:14,230
Slack, whether it's text, whether

1262
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:15,480
it's on a live call or a phone

1263
00:36:15,699 --> 00:36:15,960
call.

1264
00:36:16,699 --> 00:36:17,940
But that's kind of my guide.

1265
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:20,690
It's like emails for formal, more

1266
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:22,539
old school clients.

1267
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:23,539
Slack is quick.

1268
00:36:23,719 --> 00:36:25,059
It's conversational.

1269
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:25,719
It's fun.

1270
00:36:25,929 --> 00:36:27,579
It's more modern.

1271
00:36:27,679 --> 00:36:28,679
Loom videos are great, especially

1272
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:31,380
when there's, like, more in-depth

1273
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:33,730
updates or visual things that you

1274
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:34,349
want to show them.

1275
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:36,550
And then live calls are great for,

1276
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:38,780
like, talking through hurdles and

1277
00:36:39,179 --> 00:36:39,849
bottlenecks.

1278
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,030
And just, again, like, getting

1279
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:44,000
their input and feedback on things

1280
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:44,739
as well.

1281
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:45,599
And just overall building

1282
00:36:45,679 --> 00:36:46,559
relationships, right?

1283
00:36:46,769 --> 00:36:48,250
Other things for client

1284
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:50,760
communication best practices.

1285
00:36:50,969 --> 00:36:52,179
Over-communicate rather than

1286
00:36:52,179 --> 00:36:53,300
under-communicate.

1287
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:55,449
Hold clients accountable for their

1288
00:36:55,449 --> 00:36:56,860
responsibilities.

1289
00:36:57,070 --> 00:36:59,099
Because, again, like, success is a

1290
00:36:59,099 --> 00:37:01,099
joint accountability effort.

1291
00:37:01,309 --> 00:37:03,360
You cannot get someone meaningful

1292
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,599
business results with cold email

1293
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:06,760
if they don't have a good offer

1294
00:37:06,869 --> 00:37:07,690
and if they don't have a good

1295
00:37:07,869 --> 00:37:08,360
sales process.

1296
00:37:09,099 --> 00:37:11,380
So, like, even though you crush it

1297
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:13,739
with cold email, it's not going to

1298
00:37:13,739 --> 00:37:15,960
lead to actual business results

1299
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:18,289
like new clients sign without them

1300
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,849
doing their part.

1301
00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:21,900
And so that's super important.

1302
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:24,730
Celebrate wins, even the small

1303
00:37:24,730 --> 00:37:25,519
ones.

1304
00:37:25,730 --> 00:37:27,440
Again, like, you need to highlight

1305
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,190
progress and achievements, not

1306
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:30,139
just results.

1307
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,539
If all you celebrate is when you

1308
00:37:32,539 --> 00:37:34,849
get a client signed, it's not

1309
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:37,179
going to be enough, right?

1310
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:38,559
They're going to feel like they're

1311
00:37:38,559 --> 00:37:40,019
just not getting enough results.

1312
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:43,219
So you need to, like, switch this

1313
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:46,309
wording in your brain of, like,

1314
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,190
results is king.

1315
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,900
It's like progress is king,

1316
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:50,699
actually.

1317
00:37:50,909 --> 00:37:53,179
And progress leads to results in

1318
00:37:53,179 --> 00:37:54,139
due time.

1319
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:57,010
But you can't lead to results if

1320
00:37:57,010 --> 00:37:58,880
you don't have enough time to make

1321
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,809
progress, which is why you need to

1322
00:38:00,809 --> 00:38:02,869
highlight progress, not results,

1323
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:04,280
to keep them around.

1324
00:38:04,489 --> 00:38:06,079
Frame everything in a way that

1325
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:08,159
benefits the client, focusing on

1326
00:38:08,159 --> 00:38:09,940
their outcomes and goals.

1327
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:11,239
And then be the first to address

1328
00:38:11,519 --> 00:38:13,300
problems with solutions attached.

1329
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:15,280
So, like, proactive communication

1330
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,230
looks like, hey, like, if you're,

1331
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:18,960
you know, doing cold email, hey,

1332
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:20,699
look, like, we've ran a campaign

1333
00:38:20,869 --> 00:38:21,760
for you guys.

1334
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:23,679
And based on what we've seen from

1335
00:38:23,679 --> 00:38:25,619
our most successful clients, this

1336
00:38:25,619 --> 00:38:27,469
one's just on track to be a flop.

1337
00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:28,780
Like, quite honestly, like, this

1338
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:29,880
one's just going to completely

1339
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:30,260
flop.

1340
00:38:30,469 --> 00:38:32,070
And I want to let you know now so

1341
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:34,030
that we can work on your offer and

1342
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:35,710
work on your targeting.

1343
00:38:35,989 --> 00:38:36,880
Because those are the two things

1344
00:38:37,130 --> 00:38:38,130
that can really turn the

1345
00:38:38,130 --> 00:38:39,139
performance around.

1346
00:38:39,349 --> 00:38:41,199
But that needs to be worked on.

1347
00:38:41,389 --> 00:38:42,760
But if you wait for them to tell

1348
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,460
you that the results are shit and

1349
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:46,010
that, you know, their campaigns

1350
00:38:46,369 --> 00:38:48,239
are flopping, you're in a position

1351
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:50,650
of defense instead of offense.

1352
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:52,059
And most of the times at that

1353
00:38:52,059 --> 00:38:53,840
point, you already lost them.

1354
00:38:54,050 --> 00:38:56,760
So, this is one of my favorite

1355
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:57,780
signs.

1356
00:38:57,989 --> 00:38:59,889
When you're performing well, let

1357
00:38:59,889 --> 00:39:01,099
the client know.

1358
00:39:01,239 --> 00:39:02,199
And I'm pretty sure all of you

1359
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,340
guys are good about this.

1360
00:39:03,730 --> 00:39:05,519
But when you're not performing

1361
00:39:05,519 --> 00:39:07,480
well, let the client know.

1362
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:08,949
Still, a lot of you guys are

1363
00:39:08,949 --> 00:39:10,699
probably more shy to do that.

1364
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:12,130
When doing that is actually going

1365
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:13,440
to be the best thing you can do to

1366
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,940
keep people around long term.

1367
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:17,900
So, part three, I'm zooming

1368
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:19,139
through.

1369
00:39:19,349 --> 00:39:20,400
There's just a lot of content and

1370
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,559
a lot of things that I got to get

1371
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:22,829
through to make sure you guys are

1372
00:39:22,829 --> 00:39:24,110
fully equipped to capitalize on

1373
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:25,570
what you learned from Daniel, Dan,

1374
00:39:25,570 --> 00:39:26,480
and Christian.

1375
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:28,130
And so, we're going to get through

1376
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:29,630
this as fast as possible and then

1377
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:31,090
go through as many questions as

1378
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:31,679
possible.

1379
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:33,619
Part three, building scalable

1380
00:39:33,619 --> 00:39:34,960
fulfillment systems.

1381
00:39:35,079 --> 00:39:36,059
So, it's all about documenting

1382
00:39:36,639 --> 00:39:38,590
your process, making sure everyone

1383
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:40,139
on the team is following those

1384
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,550
processes and systems,

1385
00:39:41,730 --> 00:39:44,309
implementing different forms of

1386
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:46,679
automation, and then ensuring that

1387
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:48,570
there's quality control as things

1388
00:39:48,730 --> 00:39:49,559
start to scale.

1389
00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:52,570
Making sure that as things scale,

1390
00:39:52,570 --> 00:39:54,730
you're not doing things at a lower

1391
00:39:55,099 --> 00:39:56,909
standard than what was previously

1392
00:39:57,090 --> 00:39:58,780
expected or accepted.

1393
00:39:58,989 --> 00:40:00,670
And what that really goes back to

1394
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:02,630
is like, you should have the same

1395
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:04,440
quality or even better quality

1396
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:07,010
with 1,000 clients as you do with

1397
00:40:07,010 --> 00:40:07,789
10.

1398
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:10,159
And this is, you know, the

1399
00:40:10,159 --> 00:40:12,199
presentation is trying in a way to

1400
00:40:12,199 --> 00:40:14,360
show you how to exactly do that.

1401
00:40:15,389 --> 00:40:16,280
But okay, the optimization

1402
00:40:16,849 --> 00:40:18,730
framework for operations, the

1403
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:21,010
72-hour task audit, the removing

1404
00:40:21,010 --> 00:40:22,940
the unnecessary steps is one of my

1405
00:40:22,969 --> 00:40:24,210
favorite quotes.

1406
00:40:24,349 --> 00:40:26,030
It's not a direct quote, but Elon

1407
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:28,170
Musk essentially says, most people

1408
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:29,769
try to optimize things that

1409
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,260
shouldn't exist in the first

1410
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:32,030
place.

1411
00:40:32,559 --> 00:40:34,449
So, remove unnecessary steps,

1412
00:40:34,449 --> 00:40:36,349
create systems for repeatable

1413
00:40:36,349 --> 00:40:38,280
work, like just having an SOP that

1414
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:40,230
you can then delegate to other

1415
00:40:40,469 --> 00:40:42,139
team members and then automate

1416
00:40:42,139 --> 00:40:44,139
things that are more predictable

1417
00:40:44,210 --> 00:40:46,030
and use AI tools to do that.

1418
00:40:46,349 --> 00:40:48,969
Because the world we live in now,

1419
00:40:48,969 --> 00:40:52,000
like, man, like when I was running

1420
00:40:52,210 --> 00:40:55,230
an agency with over 100 clients

1421
00:40:55,309 --> 00:40:58,750
before ChatGPT existed, man, like

1422
00:40:58,809 --> 00:41:02,179
it was so different than what it's

1423
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:03,650
like today.

1424
00:41:03,989 --> 00:41:05,500
Like today, there's just no excuse

1425
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:06,860
not to be able to handle a high

1426
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:08,309
volume of clients because the

1427
00:41:08,559 --> 00:41:09,639
tools available are just so

1428
00:41:09,639 --> 00:41:10,369
advanced.

1429
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:14,199
So, 72-hour task audit is where I

1430
00:41:14,199 --> 00:41:15,400
would start.

1431
00:41:15,610 --> 00:41:17,269
You need to document all the

1432
00:41:17,269 --> 00:41:19,630
things that you do for 72 hours

1433
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:21,829
and show how much time is spent on

1434
00:41:21,829 --> 00:41:23,159
each activity.

1435
00:41:23,179 --> 00:41:25,420
Categorize them, each activity by

1436
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:27,510
what gives you energy versus what

1437
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:28,980
drains your energy.

1438
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:31,460
High-value task, low-value task,

1439
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:33,550
and then client-facing task,

1440
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:34,840
internal task.

1441
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:36,969
And what this audit is going to

1442
00:41:36,969 --> 00:41:38,429
do, it's going to give you a lot

1443
00:41:38,429 --> 00:41:39,920
of insights and clarity as to,

1444
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,199
like, how your time is being

1445
00:41:41,309 --> 00:41:41,980
spent.

1446
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:43,730
And if you have a team, you should

1447
00:41:43,730 --> 00:41:45,219
have your team do this as well

1448
00:41:45,219 --> 00:41:47,019
because that's going to show you,

1449
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:48,940
like, where you need to systemize,

1450
00:41:48,969 --> 00:41:49,570
right?

1451
00:41:49,849 --> 00:41:51,400
Time tracking.

1452
00:41:51,539 --> 00:41:53,300
It's not something you need to do

1453
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:55,420
forever, but you should do it for,

1454
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:57,610
you know, a 72-hour time period

1455
00:41:57,610 --> 00:41:59,210
and see what insights come of

1456
00:41:59,449 --> 00:41:59,860
that.

1457
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,380
And then create systems for

1458
00:42:02,530 --> 00:42:03,500
repeatable work.

1459
00:42:03,610 --> 00:42:05,090
So, you want to identify patterns

1460
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:06,119
like tasks you perform

1461
00:42:06,119 --> 00:42:07,000
repetitively.

1462
00:42:07,210 --> 00:42:09,059
And you might think you know right

1463
00:42:09,059 --> 00:42:11,090
now, but I promise you, if you do

1464
00:42:11,090 --> 00:42:13,489
a 72-hour task audit, you're going

1465
00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:14,809
to be blown away.

1466
00:42:15,070 --> 00:42:16,269
You're going to be like, wow, I

1467
00:42:16,269 --> 00:42:17,469
had no idea I was spending all

1468
00:42:17,469 --> 00:42:18,559
that time doing this.

1469
00:42:18,559 --> 00:42:20,019
I need to get rid of that.

1470
00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:22,670
Or processes that have really

1471
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:24,380
predictable steps or work that

1472
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:25,980
follows similar patterns or

1473
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:27,360
activities that could be

1474
00:42:27,409 --> 00:42:28,750
templated, right?

1475
00:42:28,969 --> 00:42:30,199
Just made easier instead of

1476
00:42:30,199 --> 00:42:32,119
starting from scratch each time.

1477
00:42:32,329 --> 00:42:34,170
And so, document those processes

1478
00:42:34,170 --> 00:42:36,130
with start and end points, clear

1479
00:42:36,130 --> 00:42:38,280
start and end points, step-by-step

1480
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:40,739
procedures, triggers, like, what

1481
00:42:40,889 --> 00:42:42,610
triggers that step or process to

1482
00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:43,030
start?

1483
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:44,449
And what are the different

1484
00:42:44,449 --> 00:42:45,860
decision points along the way?

1485
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:48,179
And then the expected outcomes and

1486
00:42:48,179 --> 00:42:50,139
the standards of the work.

1487
00:42:50,349 --> 00:42:51,900
That's how you create a system for

1488
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:53,039
repeatable work.

1489
00:42:53,239 --> 00:42:54,369
And then automating the

1490
00:42:54,369 --> 00:42:56,440
predictable parts, things that you

1491
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,570
can automate are, like, repetitive

1492
00:42:58,579 --> 00:43:00,849
data entry, notification systems.

1493
00:43:01,130 --> 00:43:02,699
Like, when a client signs on, you

1494
00:43:02,699 --> 00:43:04,440
can send an onboarding email.

1495
00:43:04,599 --> 00:43:05,739
And if they don't fill out the

1496
00:43:05,739 --> 00:43:06,989
onboarding form and book an

1497
00:43:06,989 --> 00:43:08,619
onboarding call, you can automate

1498
00:43:08,619 --> 00:43:09,869
a follow-up reminder.

1499
00:43:10,010 --> 00:43:11,469
Or if they don't show up to the

1500
00:43:11,469 --> 00:43:13,059
call, you can have a no-show

1501
00:43:13,059 --> 00:43:13,920
sequence.

1502
00:43:14,059 --> 00:43:15,670
Or, you know, after they've

1503
00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:17,710
successfully onboarded, you can

1504
00:43:17,710 --> 00:43:19,780
trigger, like, an education-based

1505
00:43:20,050 --> 00:43:22,929
flow to give them drip-fed value

1506
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:24,829
as, you know, they continue to

1507
00:43:24,829 --> 00:43:26,150
become a paying customer.

1508
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:29,780
Or document generation, like,

1509
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:31,320
creating SOPs.

1510
00:43:31,510 --> 00:43:32,829
One of the best processes for

1511
00:43:32,829 --> 00:43:34,510
using AI and automation tools is

1512
00:43:34,510 --> 00:43:35,539
creating SOPs.

1513
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:37,599
Follow-up sequences, like I talked

1514
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:39,750
about, email, text, those sorts of

1515
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:40,349
things.

1516
00:43:40,639 --> 00:43:41,980
And then status updates.

1517
00:43:42,190 --> 00:43:43,639
There's ways to automate, you

1518
00:43:43,639 --> 00:43:45,309
know, weekly reporting using

1519
00:43:45,309 --> 00:43:47,099
automation tools like ChatGPT,

1520
00:43:47,150 --> 00:43:49,019
Zapier, project management, like

1521
00:43:49,269 --> 00:43:50,780
Intrello, email sequence tools

1522
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:52,500
like ConvertKit, and just

1523
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:53,789
templates in general.

1524
00:43:54,179 --> 00:43:55,610
And just Google Doc templates, one

1525
00:43:55,610 --> 00:43:56,980
of the best things you can, you

1526
00:43:56,980 --> 00:43:58,440
know, spend your time on putting

1527
00:43:58,440 --> 00:43:58,829
in place.

1528
00:43:59,150 --> 00:44:02,219
I get this question all the time.

1529
00:44:02,329 --> 00:44:03,739
It's like, send me your SOPs.

1530
00:44:03,949 --> 00:44:07,530
And it's like, SOPs, I'm not big

1531
00:44:07,530 --> 00:44:08,550
on SOPs.

1532
00:44:09,010 --> 00:44:10,960
Because not, most things don't

1533
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:13,500
have step-by-step instructions.

1534
00:44:13,710 --> 00:44:16,429
They're not, you know, do this, do

1535
00:44:16,429 --> 00:44:17,159
that.

1536
00:44:17,469 --> 00:44:19,460
They're more creative.

1537
00:44:19,659 --> 00:44:20,780
They're more free-flowing.

1538
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:22,840
And they're more often changing.

1539
00:44:23,050 --> 00:44:25,610
And so I lean into training more

1540
00:44:25,610 --> 00:44:26,820
than SOPs.

1541
00:44:27,030 --> 00:44:29,119
Training is teaching your team how

1542
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:29,940
to think.

1543
00:44:30,099 --> 00:44:32,389
It's giving them mental frameworks

1544
00:44:32,389 --> 00:44:34,079
for decision-making,

1545
00:44:34,719 --> 00:44:36,960
problem-solving approaches, when

1546
00:44:36,969 --> 00:44:38,710
to escalate versus when to handle

1547
00:44:38,719 --> 00:44:39,449
yourself.

1548
00:44:39,670 --> 00:44:41,650
And then developing judgment, like

1549
00:44:41,650 --> 00:44:44,239
decision-making, intuition, right?

1550
00:44:44,449 --> 00:44:46,849
And so I find trainings to be more

1551
00:44:46,849 --> 00:44:49,789
valuable than straight-up SOPs.

1552
00:44:50,030 --> 00:44:51,710
Obviously, SOPs are valuable,

1553
00:44:51,710 --> 00:44:52,320
right?

1554
00:44:52,530 --> 00:44:53,900
Like, you should use SOPs when the

1555
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:55,389
process is repeatable, when

1556
00:44:55,389 --> 00:44:57,500
consistency is critical, when the

1557
00:44:57,719 --> 00:44:59,659
steps don't change, when you need

1558
00:44:59,690 --> 00:45:00,780
to scale quickly.

1559
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:03,460
But training is when the work

1560
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:05,400
requires a decision to be made,

1561
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:07,599
best judgment, decision-making.

1562
00:45:07,869 --> 00:45:10,639
Situations vary significantly.

1563
00:45:10,639 --> 00:45:11,739
It's different than what you've

1564
00:45:11,969 --> 00:45:12,420
seen before.

1565
00:45:12,630 --> 00:45:15,469
And then creativity is valued,

1566
00:45:15,469 --> 00:45:16,420
right?

1567
00:45:16,579 --> 00:45:17,889
And then you want to develop your

1568
00:45:17,889 --> 00:45:19,340
team's ability to handle things

1569
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:20,900
without you always being there or

1570
00:45:21,199 --> 00:45:22,079
without, you know, step-by-step

1571
00:45:22,190 --> 00:45:23,460
instructions needed to be given.

1572
00:45:24,070 --> 00:45:26,090
So the more you SOP and tell them

1573
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:28,380
exactly what to do, the more you

1574
00:45:28,679 --> 00:45:30,489
create robotic humans as team

1575
00:45:30,670 --> 00:45:33,090
members, not problem solvers.

1576
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:34,619
And problem solvers are the types

1577
00:45:34,619 --> 00:45:36,039
of people in your organization

1578
00:45:36,039 --> 00:45:37,289
that are going to help you to

1579
00:45:37,289 --> 00:45:37,800
scale.

1580
00:45:38,010 --> 00:45:40,119
And so how do you have quality

1581
00:45:40,119 --> 00:45:43,250
control without micromanagement?

1582
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:45,099
So we're getting more into, like,

1583
00:45:45,099 --> 00:45:46,719
the team aspect of operations,

1584
00:45:46,719 --> 00:45:48,110
systems, and fulfillment.

1585
00:45:48,570 --> 00:45:50,449
Like, okay, it's not just you at

1586
00:45:50,449 --> 00:45:51,400
this point.

1587
00:45:51,610 --> 00:45:52,719
There's people involved.

1588
00:45:52,929 --> 00:45:55,420
Real quick, just for, like, a

1589
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:58,269
litmus test, can you guys just put

1590
00:45:58,340 --> 00:46:01,010
in the chat, if you have a team,

1591
00:46:01,059 --> 00:46:03,250
just put the number one.

1592
00:46:03,369 --> 00:46:04,909
If you have any team members, just

1593
00:46:04,909 --> 00:46:05,980
put the number one.

1594
00:46:06,119 --> 00:46:07,079
It could be a VA.

1595
00:46:07,219 --> 00:46:08,960
It could be, like, a co-founder.

1596
00:46:09,090 --> 00:46:10,760
If you're not the only one running

1597
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:12,510
the business and doing things in

1598
00:46:12,510 --> 00:46:14,619
your business, please, in the Zoom

1599
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:16,769
chat, put one, because this part

1600
00:46:16,969 --> 00:46:18,690
of the presentation is going to be

1601
00:46:18,829 --> 00:46:20,769
absolutely critical for you.

1602
00:46:20,989 --> 00:46:23,900
Okay, so some of you guys.

1603
00:46:24,110 --> 00:46:25,969
Again, if you're listening in, put

1604
00:46:25,969 --> 00:46:27,769
the number one in the Zoom chat,

1605
00:46:27,769 --> 00:46:29,699
if you currently have a team, even

1606
00:46:29,710 --> 00:46:31,489
if it's just one other person that

1607
00:46:31,630 --> 00:46:33,409
works on your business other than

1608
00:46:33,610 --> 00:46:34,420
yourself.

1609
00:46:34,849 --> 00:46:36,960
Because, again, this part of the

1610
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,199
presentation is going to be worth

1611
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:41,409
all of the money that you invested

1612
00:46:41,530 --> 00:46:43,079
into this challenge.

1613
00:46:43,289 --> 00:46:45,889
Okay, so quality control without

1614
00:46:45,889 --> 00:46:47,659
micromanagement.

1615
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:48,760
You need to establish clear

1616
00:46:49,050 --> 00:46:50,260
quality standards.

1617
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:51,090
Like, what does excellence

1618
00:46:51,099 --> 00:46:51,800
actually look like?

1619
00:46:52,010 --> 00:46:53,670
With examples, you need to have

1620
00:46:53,670 --> 00:46:55,440
review processes in place.

1621
00:46:55,539 --> 00:46:56,889
So, like, call reviews are one of

1622
00:46:56,889 --> 00:46:58,159
the best review processes.

1623
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:00,300
So, like, when we hire salespeople

1624
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:02,050
and they're not, like, hitting

1625
00:47:02,050 --> 00:47:03,559
KPIs, we need to review their

1626
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:04,539
sales calls.

1627
00:47:04,630 --> 00:47:05,929
So, like, Dan, he probably talked

1628
00:47:05,929 --> 00:47:07,360
about this on his call yesterday.

1629
00:47:07,539 --> 00:47:09,110
And if you didn't, it's a critical

1630
00:47:09,110 --> 00:47:09,639
piece.

1631
00:47:09,789 --> 00:47:11,949
It's reviewing sales calls to see,

1632
00:47:11,949 --> 00:47:13,949
like, how can I coach and train

1633
00:47:13,949 --> 00:47:16,039
this person to be better at sales

1634
00:47:16,039 --> 00:47:16,679
calls?

1635
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:18,400
And you can do that on onboarding

1636
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:20,150
calls by reviewing them and even,

1637
00:47:20,150 --> 00:47:21,590
like, checking calls with clients

1638
00:47:21,949 --> 00:47:22,590
as well.

1639
00:47:23,409 --> 00:47:24,639
You want to create feedback loops

1640
00:47:24,639 --> 00:47:25,860
for improvement, right?

1641
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:26,960
So, like, a feedback loop can be

1642
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:27,920
through a call review.

1643
00:47:28,090 --> 00:47:29,019
And then you want to set specific

1644
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:30,809
check-in points for complex

1645
00:47:30,809 --> 00:47:31,500
projects.

1646
00:47:31,690 --> 00:47:33,300
And that could be through the form

1647
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:35,250
of, like, weekly team meetings or

1648
00:47:35,250 --> 00:47:36,679
huddles at the start of every

1649
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:37,639
single day.

1650
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:39,380
Or end-of-day type forms.

1651
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:40,480
And an end-of-day type form, you

1652
00:47:40,639 --> 00:47:41,500
can ask, like, what are you

1653
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:42,719
currently struggling with or what

1654
00:47:42,719 --> 00:47:43,719
do you need help with?

1655
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:45,800
And that way you have, you know,

1656
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:47,469
consistent communication without

1657
00:47:47,469 --> 00:47:48,940
having to micromanage and check

1658
00:47:49,050 --> 00:47:50,769
in, you know, by your own memory

1659
00:47:50,849 --> 00:47:52,090
with every team member.

1660
00:47:54,510 --> 00:47:56,329
If quality across the board

1661
00:47:56,329 --> 00:47:58,489
decreases, and it's not like

1662
00:47:58,489 --> 00:48:00,829
you've never had a high quality,

1663
00:48:00,909 --> 00:48:03,239
it's just you started at a really

1664
00:48:03,239 --> 00:48:05,760
high quality and it decreases over

1665
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:07,949
time, it's probably a case where

1666
00:48:08,110 --> 00:48:09,960
you're at capacity and you need to

1667
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:11,670
hire more people to manage more

1668
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:12,500
clients.

1669
00:48:12,789 --> 00:48:13,570
That's really it.

1670
00:48:13,699 --> 00:48:15,190
So, if you start to see quality

1671
00:48:15,190 --> 00:48:16,800
drop and it's been, you know,

1672
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,539
where you wanted it before, it's

1673
00:48:18,750 --> 00:48:20,349
probably because the existing team

1674
00:48:20,469 --> 00:48:22,199
members are spread too thin.

1675
00:48:22,340 --> 00:48:23,880
So, that's something, that's

1676
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:25,730
something, that's like a signal to

1677
00:48:25,730 --> 00:48:26,900
keep out an eye on.

1678
00:48:27,079 --> 00:48:29,579
So, how do you protect your energy

1679
00:48:29,579 --> 00:48:31,710
while managing clients?

1680
00:48:31,889 --> 00:48:33,300
We're going to get into, like,

1681
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:34,710
your day-to-day and then your

1682
00:48:34,710 --> 00:48:35,860
team's day-to-day.

1683
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:37,500
So, time management, structuring

1684
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:38,559
your day for a balance of

1685
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:40,219
productivity and fulfillment.

1686
00:48:40,369 --> 00:48:42,780
Go back to the 72-hour task audit.

1687
00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:44,519
What gives you energy?

1688
00:48:44,789 --> 00:48:46,670
And by identifying what gives you

1689
00:48:46,670 --> 00:48:48,599
energy, you can add those into

1690
00:48:48,599 --> 00:48:50,440
your day-to-day and you can weed

1691
00:48:50,710 --> 00:48:52,389
out the things that drain your

1692
00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:53,199
energy.

1693
00:48:53,469 --> 00:48:54,389
And as long as you have the

1694
00:48:54,389 --> 00:48:55,730
self-awareness and know these

1695
00:48:55,730 --> 00:48:56,949
things, you can operate at a

1696
00:48:56,949 --> 00:48:58,000
really high level.

1697
00:48:58,210 --> 00:49:00,599
Setting boundaries, right?

1698
00:49:00,690 --> 00:49:01,599
So, like, creating clear

1699
00:49:01,639 --> 00:49:02,789
expectations with clients and

1700
00:49:02,789 --> 00:49:03,960
things like expected response

1701
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:04,360
times.

1702
00:49:05,130 --> 00:49:07,559
I know a lot of us are, like, just

1703
00:49:07,559 --> 00:49:09,849
confused about this where we think

1704
00:49:10,210 --> 00:49:12,440
clients really value, like,

1705
00:49:12,610 --> 00:49:14,550
immediate responses.

1706
00:49:14,809 --> 00:49:15,860
Like, if I have a question and I

1707
00:49:15,860 --> 00:49:17,010
send it, I expect immediate

1708
00:49:17,010 --> 00:49:17,659
response.

1709
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:18,750
Like, it's not true.

1710
00:49:18,969 --> 00:49:21,519
And it's not fair to you if those

1711
00:49:21,519 --> 00:49:24,619
boundaries are not properly set.

1712
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:26,550
So, give them an expected response

1713
00:49:26,550 --> 00:49:27,000
time.

1714
00:49:27,210 --> 00:49:28,619
Like, hey, if you message me on

1715
00:49:28,619 --> 00:49:30,420
Slack within these hours, I'll get

1716
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:31,809
back to you within an hour to two

1717
00:49:32,170 --> 00:49:32,550
hours.

1718
00:49:33,159 --> 00:49:34,849
If it's outside of business hours,

1719
00:49:34,849 --> 00:49:36,780
it'll be, you know, the next day.

1720
00:49:37,710 --> 00:49:39,210
Some of you guys are on Slack, you

1721
00:49:39,210 --> 00:49:40,989
know, up until midnight, and I'm

1722
00:49:40,989 --> 00:49:42,309
guilty of this as well, getting

1723
00:49:42,670 --> 00:49:44,539
back to clients when you really,

1724
00:49:44,769 --> 00:49:45,960
you really just need to set

1725
00:49:46,090 --> 00:49:47,840
boundaries so that you can protect

1726
00:49:48,010 --> 00:49:49,730
your time and protect your energy.

1727
00:49:50,059 --> 00:49:51,730
So, anyways, and then strategic

1728
00:49:51,730 --> 00:49:53,340
delegation, knowing what you

1729
00:49:53,340 --> 00:49:54,750
should handle personally versus

1730
00:49:55,110 --> 00:49:56,230
what to delegate.

1731
00:49:56,449 --> 00:49:58,130
And this is, like, a limiting

1732
00:49:58,130 --> 00:50:00,539
belief, but, like, by implementing

1733
00:50:01,019 --> 00:50:02,079
boundaries, the client

1734
00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:04,000
relationship is actually much

1735
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,039
better off.

1736
00:50:05,199 --> 00:50:07,000
It's strengthened, not weakened.

1737
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:08,599
So, super, super important.

1738
00:50:08,849 --> 00:50:10,380
And then this is the daily

1739
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:12,300
structure for operational

1740
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:14,500
excellence, at least for me.

1741
00:50:14,769 --> 00:50:16,139
So, if you're more of an

1742
00:50:16,139 --> 00:50:18,380
operations-minded person, I'll

1743
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:20,469
usually do a meetings block from

1744
00:50:20,469 --> 00:50:22,019
when I wake up to when I have

1745
00:50:22,190 --> 00:50:22,909
lunch.

1746
00:50:23,130 --> 00:50:24,599
And so, I have, like, a specific

1747
00:50:24,599 --> 00:50:25,679
morning routine.

1748
00:50:25,849 --> 00:50:26,780
But then from 9 a.m.

1749
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:28,739
to 1 p.m., pretty much for four

1750
00:50:28,739 --> 00:50:30,340
hours, it's a meeting time block

1751
00:50:30,449 --> 00:50:31,340
on my calendar.

1752
00:50:31,550 --> 00:50:32,539
So, all my team and client

1753
00:50:32,690 --> 00:50:34,360
meetings are during that time.

1754
00:50:34,570 --> 00:50:36,590
And then afternoons are for deep

1755
00:50:36,590 --> 00:50:37,199
work.

1756
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:39,099
So, I have, you know, my mind is

1757
00:50:39,099 --> 00:50:40,750
clear and I can just fully focus

1758
00:50:40,750 --> 00:50:42,190
on deep work rather than going

1759
00:50:42,550 --> 00:50:44,280
into a meeting and then having 30

1760
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:46,179
minutes and then a meeting and 30

1761
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:47,110
minutes.

1762
00:50:47,730 --> 00:50:50,519
So, that whole stop and start

1763
00:50:50,519 --> 00:50:53,960
pattern of your day structure will

1764
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,139
kill all momentum.

1765
00:50:56,389 --> 00:50:57,570
You're just not going to be able

1766
00:50:57,570 --> 00:50:58,659
to get anything done.

1767
00:50:59,929 --> 00:51:01,360
And then, like, post lunch or

1768
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:03,000
during lunch for catching up on

1769
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,550
Slack and email, that's usually

1770
00:51:04,909 --> 00:51:05,949
super effective.

1771
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:07,710
So, like, for me, like, I clear

1772
00:51:07,710 --> 00:51:09,429
Slack and email before my meeting

1773
00:51:09,429 --> 00:51:10,000
block.

1774
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:12,460
I clear Slack and email at the end

1775
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:14,039
of my meeting block.

1776
00:51:14,199 --> 00:51:15,610
And then after, like, my deep work

1777
00:51:15,610 --> 00:51:17,030
at the end of the day, I'll clear

1778
00:51:17,030 --> 00:51:18,019
Slack and email.

1779
00:51:18,019 --> 00:51:19,119
So, pretty much three times.

1780
00:51:20,150 --> 00:51:22,239
And if you do that, like, the

1781
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:24,750
response times are not, like,

1782
00:51:24,750 --> 00:51:26,980
going to be 24 hours.

1783
00:51:27,039 --> 00:51:28,139
It's still going to be a couple of

1784
00:51:28,369 --> 00:51:28,579
hours.

1785
00:51:28,739 --> 00:51:30,739
It's just set specific times and

1786
00:51:30,739 --> 00:51:31,820
check Slack.

1787
00:51:32,030 --> 00:51:34,280
Morning, afternoon, end of day,

1788
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:36,489
rather than just always being on

1789
00:51:36,599 --> 00:51:37,679
Slack and email.

1790
00:51:38,110 --> 00:51:39,480
Otherwise, again, it's the stop

1791
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:40,400
and start thing.

1792
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:41,260
You're never going to get anything

1793
00:51:41,340 --> 00:51:41,500
done.

1794
00:51:42,449 --> 00:51:43,380
And then reserve late afternoon

1795
00:51:43,829 --> 00:51:45,489
for strategic work because that's

1796
00:51:45,489 --> 00:51:47,090
when you're going to get the least

1797
00:51:47,449 --> 00:51:48,489
emails, the least last Slack

1798
00:51:48,570 --> 00:51:50,349
messages, the least text messages.

1799
00:51:50,449 --> 00:51:51,619
So, you can actually focus on,

1800
00:51:51,619 --> 00:51:52,980
like, more high-level strategic

1801
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:53,480
things.

1802
00:51:53,690 --> 00:51:55,320
And then weekly planning.

1803
00:51:55,530 --> 00:51:56,739
Here's how I plan my weeks.

1804
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:58,949
On Monday, usually actually Sunday

1805
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:01,059
night, I'll set my objectives.

1806
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:02,309
Like, here's what I want to do

1807
00:52:02,309 --> 00:52:02,940
this week.

1808
00:52:03,099 --> 00:52:04,460
And then on Friday, I'll review my

1809
00:52:04,460 --> 00:52:05,119
progress.

1810
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:05,940
What did I get done?

1811
00:52:06,099 --> 00:52:06,929
What's still in progress?

1812
00:52:07,139 --> 00:52:07,760
What did I learn?

1813
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:09,150
And I'll just simply keep, like, a

1814
00:52:09,150 --> 00:52:10,500
running to-do list throughout the

1815
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:10,920
week.

1816
00:52:11,409 --> 00:52:12,760
And then I'll adjust, you know, as

1817
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:13,219
needed.

1818
00:52:13,429 --> 00:52:14,829
Like, maybe some things that I

1819
00:52:14,829 --> 00:52:16,489
thought I wanted to get done this

1820
00:52:16,489 --> 00:52:18,360
week just need to be pushed back.

1821
00:52:18,530 --> 00:52:20,780
Or, you know, this is something

1822
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:23,030
that just no longer needs to get

1823
00:52:23,139 --> 00:52:23,539
done.

1824
00:52:23,909 --> 00:52:26,360
So, okay.

1825
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:27,110
So, when to push back

1826
00:52:27,179 --> 00:52:27,920
professionally.

1827
00:52:28,130 --> 00:52:29,719
This is, I've also, I also realize

1828
00:52:29,719 --> 00:52:31,340
just going through this again,

1829
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:33,099
that this is kind of out of order.

1830
00:52:33,329 --> 00:52:35,219
But stay with me.

1831
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:36,320
And if you're extra focused,

1832
00:52:36,539 --> 00:52:37,559
you'll still get value.

1833
00:52:37,739 --> 00:52:39,360
But anyways, this is talking about

1834
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:40,780
pushing back on clients.

1835
00:52:41,449 --> 00:52:43,130
And this is, like, when, again,

1836
00:52:43,130 --> 00:52:45,210
like, they're crossing boundaries,

1837
00:52:45,210 --> 00:52:45,860
right?

1838
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:46,929
You set boundaries and then they

1839
00:52:46,940 --> 00:52:47,460
break them.

1840
00:52:47,559 --> 00:52:48,559
So, like, scope creep.

1841
00:52:48,869 --> 00:52:50,570
They request something that falls

1842
00:52:50,570 --> 00:52:52,340
outside of the scope of work.

1843
00:52:52,550 --> 00:52:54,019
Unrealistic expectations, like

1844
00:52:54,019 --> 00:52:55,750
timelines and expected results are

1845
00:52:55,750 --> 00:52:56,619
unrealistic.

1846
00:52:56,829 --> 00:52:58,340
Quality compromises, like work

1847
00:52:58,340 --> 00:52:59,809
that they're asking you to do

1848
00:52:59,809 --> 00:53:01,429
would compromise on the overall

1849
00:53:01,789 --> 00:53:02,070
quality.

1850
00:53:02,789 --> 00:53:03,739
And then strategy buy-in.

1851
00:53:04,070 --> 00:53:05,000
Like, the demands are inherently

1852
00:53:05,159 --> 00:53:06,500
bad for their business, right?

1853
00:53:06,590 --> 00:53:07,800
So, like, a client might ask you

1854
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:08,619
to do something.

1855
00:53:08,809 --> 00:53:10,429
But it might be, like, something

1856
00:53:10,429 --> 00:53:12,170
that you shouldn't do even if they

1857
00:53:12,170 --> 00:53:13,429
wanted you to do it.

1858
00:53:13,650 --> 00:53:15,400
Because it would set them further

1859
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:16,440
back, right?

1860
00:53:16,530 --> 00:53:17,699
So, you want to make sure that,

1861
00:53:17,699 --> 00:53:19,070
like, what they're demanding are

1862
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:20,400
also in their best interest.

1863
00:53:21,809 --> 00:53:23,980
And you always want to, again, go

1864
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:25,869
back to framing what you're

1865
00:53:26,380 --> 00:53:28,010
pushing back on as, like, I'm

1866
00:53:28,010 --> 00:53:30,219
doing this to protect you and to

1867
00:53:30,369 --> 00:53:32,119
deliver the quality you deserve.

1868
00:53:32,239 --> 00:53:34,050
So, here's, like, there's a couple

1869
00:53:34,050 --> 00:53:35,670
of, you know, snippets in this

1870
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:36,929
presentation that you can

1871
00:53:37,289 --> 00:53:37,980
literally take.

1872
00:53:38,329 --> 00:53:39,980
Like, the next best step is, like,

1873
00:53:39,980 --> 00:53:41,380
use that in your emails.

1874
00:53:41,530 --> 00:53:43,219
Or to deliver the quality you

1875
00:53:43,219 --> 00:53:45,440
deserve, we need to, and then you

1876
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:47,559
tell them what you need to do.

1877
00:53:47,789 --> 00:53:49,300
Like, these are actual blurbs that

1878
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:50,949
you can include when writing, you

1879
00:53:50,949 --> 00:53:52,610
know, emails or Slack messages or

1880
00:53:52,750 --> 00:53:53,909
even on a live call with your

1881
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:54,619
customer.

1882
00:53:54,929 --> 00:53:56,699
Super helpful.

1883
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:58,650
So, this actually now gets into

1884
00:53:58,650 --> 00:54:00,980
building your dream team, right?

1885
00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:02,940
So, like, here's the structure

1886
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:04,179
from the top down.

1887
00:54:04,269 --> 00:54:05,630
So, you have, like, leadership,

1888
00:54:05,630 --> 00:54:06,750
which is you, your, like,

1889
00:54:06,750 --> 00:54:07,840
strategic direction.

1890
00:54:08,050 --> 00:54:10,030
Actually, you guys are probably,

1891
00:54:10,030 --> 00:54:11,980
like, one to four all at the same

1892
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:12,619
time.

1893
00:54:12,809 --> 00:54:13,480
And I get that.

1894
00:54:13,679 --> 00:54:14,320
And that's okay.

1895
00:54:14,519 --> 00:54:15,420
But you want to be strategic

1896
00:54:15,860 --> 00:54:16,719
direction.

1897
00:54:16,869 --> 00:54:17,820
You're going to want to have

1898
00:54:18,269 --> 00:54:19,320
managers in place to coordinate,

1899
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:20,860
you know, what the team is doing.

1900
00:54:21,070 --> 00:54:22,260
Then you have specialists.

1901
00:54:22,469 --> 00:54:24,510
They are the ones that actually,

1902
00:54:24,510 --> 00:54:26,679
like, execute on the ideas.

1903
00:54:26,849 --> 00:54:28,110
And then you have support to,

1904
00:54:28,110 --> 00:54:29,489
like, help the specialists

1905
00:54:29,489 --> 00:54:30,159
execute.

1906
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:31,619
Like, operational foundations.

1907
00:54:32,409 --> 00:54:33,949
Those are more, like, executive

1908
00:54:33,949 --> 00:54:35,820
assistants, chief of staff, those

1909
00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:37,380
sorts of roles, VA roles.

1910
00:54:37,579 --> 00:54:39,110
But those are, like, the four

1911
00:54:39,110 --> 00:54:40,440
levels of your team.

1912
00:54:40,650 --> 00:54:43,059
This is a really important slide

1913
00:54:43,059 --> 00:54:45,579
because I get this question all

1914
00:54:45,610 --> 00:54:46,599
the time.

1915
00:54:46,829 --> 00:54:48,579
Like, when should I start hiring?

1916
00:54:48,710 --> 00:54:50,409
So, here's a couple of signs that

1917
00:54:50,409 --> 00:54:52,480
it's time for you to start hiring.

1918
00:54:52,670 --> 00:54:53,960
One, quality issues start

1919
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:55,579
appearing that weren't there

1920
00:54:55,579 --> 00:54:56,679
before, right?

1921
00:54:56,889 --> 00:54:58,170
Standards slip due to overload to

1922
00:54:58,170 --> 00:54:59,619
the point where you're actively

1923
00:54:59,619 --> 00:55:01,280
losing clients because of this.

1924
00:55:01,489 --> 00:55:03,349
Tasks take longer than they

1925
00:55:03,349 --> 00:55:04,179
should.

1926
00:55:04,179 --> 00:55:06,010
Efficiency decreases with volume

1927
00:55:06,010 --> 00:55:07,550
to a point where it diminishes

1928
00:55:07,550 --> 00:55:08,380
your value.

1929
00:55:08,590 --> 00:55:10,019
You're turning down sales

1930
00:55:10,019 --> 00:55:11,260
opportunities.

1931
00:55:11,369 --> 00:55:13,059
So, growth is limited by capacity.

1932
00:55:13,269 --> 00:55:14,980
This is actually number one,

1933
00:55:14,980 --> 00:55:15,619
right?

1934
00:55:16,059 --> 00:55:17,460
I just didn't want to change it to

1935
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:18,949
number one because I was trying to

1936
00:55:18,949 --> 00:55:20,300
rip through this as fast as

1937
00:55:20,730 --> 00:55:21,719
possible last night when I was

1938
00:55:21,719 --> 00:55:22,650
making some edits.

1939
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,679
But, like, man, like, if you have

1940
00:55:24,679 --> 00:55:26,360
to turn down sales opportunities

1941
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:27,630
because you don't have the

1942
00:55:27,989 --> 00:55:29,860
capacity, like, that's business

1943
00:55:30,130 --> 00:55:31,090
critical.

1944
00:55:31,309 --> 00:55:32,820
That's as big of an issue, as

1945
00:55:32,820 --> 00:55:34,710
important as an issue, or a red

1946
00:55:34,710 --> 00:55:36,739
flag, as anything I've ever come

1947
00:55:36,739 --> 00:55:38,030
across before.

1948
00:55:38,250 --> 00:55:41,099
Also, this one, super relatable.

1949
00:55:41,260 --> 00:55:42,199
You're working harder but

1950
00:55:42,659 --> 00:55:43,769
accomplishing the same amount or

1951
00:55:43,769 --> 00:55:44,199
less.

1952
00:55:44,309 --> 00:55:45,780
So, you have diminishing returns

1953
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:46,639
on your effort.

1954
00:55:46,820 --> 00:55:48,110
And then if you're just stuck

1955
00:55:48,110 --> 00:55:49,900
doing low-value work, right?

1956
00:55:50,070 --> 00:55:51,559
And that, you know, prevents you

1957
00:55:51,559 --> 00:55:52,900
from focusing on strategic

1958
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:54,349
priorities and higher-level

1959
00:55:54,679 --> 00:55:55,079
projects.

1960
00:55:56,269 --> 00:55:57,840
So, if you need to hire because

1961
00:55:57,840 --> 00:55:59,559
any of those things resonate,

1962
00:55:59,559 --> 00:56:01,670
here's what you should hire first.

1963
00:56:01,780 --> 00:56:03,179
At least from my experience, these

1964
00:56:03,179 --> 00:56:04,380
are the roles that you should

1965
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:04,940
focus on.

1966
00:56:05,150 --> 00:56:06,789
The first one is client-facing

1967
00:56:06,789 --> 00:56:08,670
roles, like customer success

1968
00:56:08,670 --> 00:56:09,539
managers.

1969
00:56:09,750 --> 00:56:11,179
Now, free up your time on a

1970
00:56:11,179 --> 00:56:12,730
day-to-day doing client

1971
00:56:12,730 --> 00:56:14,349
management, talking to the

1972
00:56:14,710 --> 00:56:16,309
clients, having consistent

1973
00:56:16,429 --> 00:56:18,159
communication with the clients on

1974
00:56:18,309 --> 00:56:19,840
calls, on Slack, on email,

1975
00:56:19,940 --> 00:56:20,940
so that you can just flow doing

1976
00:56:21,150 --> 00:56:22,510
other work and not have to worry

1977
00:56:22,510 --> 00:56:23,659
about getting back to your

1978
00:56:23,659 --> 00:56:25,179
customers because someone else is

1979
00:56:25,239 --> 00:56:25,699
doing that.

1980
00:56:26,260 --> 00:56:27,239
Admin support, like handling

1981
00:56:27,739 --> 00:56:29,530
back-end projects, like project

1982
00:56:29,530 --> 00:56:31,570
management, meeting coordination,

1983
00:56:31,570 --> 00:56:33,159
KPIs, results reporting, et

1984
00:56:33,159 --> 00:56:33,730
cetera.

1985
00:56:34,050 --> 00:56:36,190
Systems and documentation for what

1986
00:56:36,190 --> 00:56:38,519
everyone else is doing, right?

1987
00:56:38,619 --> 00:56:39,619
So, like SOPs and just creating

1988
00:56:39,929 --> 00:56:41,289
structure, similar to what we

1989
00:56:41,289 --> 00:56:43,019
talked about in previous slides.

1990
00:56:43,230 --> 00:56:45,250
And then, eventually, delivery

1991
00:56:45,250 --> 00:56:47,760
specialists for your core service.

1992
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:49,659
So, like if you offer SEO, like

1993
00:56:49,659 --> 00:56:51,429
bringing in an actual like SEO

1994
00:56:51,429 --> 00:56:53,400
expert that can help, you know,

1995
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:55,349
deliver services for your clients

1996
00:56:55,489 --> 00:56:57,710
and get them results and scale

1997
00:56:57,730 --> 00:57:00,690
your capacity to get results, you

1998
00:57:00,739 --> 00:57:01,940
know, for more clients.

1999
00:57:02,550 --> 00:57:04,230
So, in that order, CSMs, admin

2000
00:57:04,230 --> 00:57:05,909
support, and then eventually

2001
00:57:05,909 --> 00:57:07,849
delivery specialists because, at

2002
00:57:07,849 --> 00:57:09,460
least for right now, like you're

2003
00:57:09,730 --> 00:57:11,440
pretty much the expert and that's

2004
00:57:11,449 --> 00:57:11,929
okay.

2005
00:57:12,199 --> 00:57:13,780
You can continue being the expert,

2006
00:57:13,780 --> 00:57:15,269
especially if you free up time

2007
00:57:15,269 --> 00:57:16,829
communicating to your customers

2008
00:57:17,110 --> 00:57:18,510
and free up your time doing, you

2009
00:57:18,590 --> 00:57:19,829
know, admin level work.

2010
00:57:20,530 --> 00:57:21,960
Then you can spend all your time

2011
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:23,780
doing delivery, and that's, you

2012
00:57:23,780 --> 00:57:25,469
know, much more worth your time

2013
00:57:25,489 --> 00:57:26,909
than client-facing and admin

2014
00:57:27,090 --> 00:57:27,719
stuff.

2015
00:57:27,869 --> 00:57:29,880
So, focus on these first and then

2016
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:31,440
move over into delivery

2017
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:32,530
specialists.

2018
00:57:34,829 --> 00:57:36,329
The way I like to hire is

2019
00:57:36,329 --> 00:57:38,940
performance-based compensation

2020
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:40,909
that aligns them with your

2021
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:42,780
incentives, right?

2022
00:57:42,989 --> 00:57:44,329
Like your incentives as the

2023
00:57:44,329 --> 00:57:45,099
business.

2024
00:57:45,269 --> 00:57:47,719
So, like, for example, the CSMs,

2025
00:57:47,719 --> 00:57:49,570
you can pay them a specific

2026
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:51,690
percentage of revenue for each

2027
00:57:51,869 --> 00:57:53,900
client that they manage or for a

2028
00:57:53,980 --> 00:57:55,440
setter, right?

2029
00:57:55,570 --> 00:57:56,989
We do this with salespeople, and

2030
00:57:56,989 --> 00:57:58,519
it's like the standard for hiring

2031
00:57:58,519 --> 00:57:59,989
salespeople, but we don't do it

2032
00:58:00,150 --> 00:58:01,320
for any other role, which to me

2033
00:58:01,590 --> 00:58:02,769
makes no sense, right?

2034
00:58:03,530 --> 00:58:04,940
Like, for a salesperson, you pay

2035
00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:06,489
them when they collect cash, and

2036
00:58:06,489 --> 00:58:07,989
you pay them a percentage of cash

2037
00:58:08,099 --> 00:58:08,769
collected.

2038
00:58:08,989 --> 00:58:09,239
Simple.

2039
00:58:09,409 --> 00:58:11,639
So, like, for a CSM, what is the

2040
00:58:11,639 --> 00:58:12,900
goal of a CSM?

2041
00:58:13,010 --> 00:58:13,760
To keep clients.

2042
00:58:13,940 --> 00:58:15,349
And so, if they keep clients, they

2043
00:58:15,349 --> 00:58:16,789
should get paid every month that

2044
00:58:16,789 --> 00:58:18,010
that client pays us because

2045
00:58:18,010 --> 00:58:19,550
they're keeping them and managing

2046
00:58:19,559 --> 00:58:20,820
them actively, right?

2047
00:58:21,019 --> 00:58:21,679
Setter compensation.

2048
00:58:21,889 --> 00:58:23,139
Maybe you throw in a base.

2049
00:58:23,349 --> 00:58:24,429
Maybe you throw in money for

2050
00:58:24,429 --> 00:58:26,250
completing certain activities, but

2051
00:58:26,250 --> 00:58:27,880
really what you're paying a setter

2052
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:29,429
for is booked calls, right?

2053
00:58:29,550 --> 00:58:30,909
So, you should pay them per book

2054
00:58:30,909 --> 00:58:31,360
call.

2055
00:58:31,679 --> 00:58:32,679
It's also like an inbox manager

2056
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:34,179
role that you would hire at your

2057
00:58:34,179 --> 00:58:35,039
lead gen agency.

2058
00:58:35,250 --> 00:58:37,179
You should pay an inbox manager

2059
00:58:37,179 --> 00:58:39,320
for every call that they book,

2060
00:58:39,730 --> 00:58:39,849
right?

2061
00:58:40,150 --> 00:58:41,139
Or if you have someone doing

2062
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:42,760
revenue recovery, right?

2063
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:43,860
You have clients that keep failing

2064
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:44,460
payments.

2065
00:58:44,670 --> 00:58:46,280
This is super relevant for us at

2066
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:47,519
our SaaS company.

2067
00:58:47,650 --> 00:58:48,619
We pay our revenue recovery

2068
00:58:49,050 --> 00:58:51,039
specialist 5% of the revenue that

2069
00:58:51,039 --> 00:58:52,889
they recover, and we're happy to

2070
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:54,559
do it because that's revenue that

2071
00:58:54,829 --> 00:58:55,329
we lost.

2072
00:58:55,599 --> 00:58:57,099
If they get it back, we're happy

2073
00:58:57,099 --> 00:58:58,599
to give them 5%, right?

2074
00:58:59,619 --> 00:59:01,440
The benefits of performance-based

2075
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:03,309
comp is you hire when you need to,

2076
00:59:03,309 --> 00:59:04,849
not when you can afford to,

2077
00:59:04,849 --> 00:59:06,820
because the biggest hesitation to

2078
00:59:06,820 --> 00:59:08,510
hire is like, I can't afford to

2079
00:59:08,590 --> 00:59:09,150
hire.

2080
00:59:09,449 --> 00:59:10,340
Well, yeah, you can.

2081
00:59:10,539 --> 00:59:11,929
You can hire a salesperson because

2082
00:59:11,929 --> 00:59:13,349
you don't have to pay them unless

2083
00:59:13,349 --> 00:59:14,730
they bring you money, and that

2084
00:59:15,050 --> 00:59:16,219
should be the same for every other

2085
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:17,420
role in your business.

2086
00:59:18,909 --> 00:59:20,190
It's a natural alignment with your

2087
00:59:20,190 --> 00:59:21,019
business goals.

2088
00:59:21,159 --> 00:59:22,880
So, if your business goal is to

2089
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:24,829
close more deals and to decrease

2090
00:59:24,829 --> 00:59:26,469
churn, then align the comp

2091
00:59:26,539 --> 00:59:27,980
structures to that.

2092
00:59:29,110 --> 00:59:30,449
It scales automatically with

2093
00:59:30,449 --> 00:59:31,000
growth.

2094
00:59:31,139 --> 00:59:32,099
So, as you grow, the

2095
00:59:32,260 --> 00:59:34,309
performance-based compensation

2096
00:59:34,309 --> 00:59:36,130
grows, and if you dip and have a

2097
00:59:36,170 --> 00:59:37,769
bad month, you don't go out of

2098
00:59:37,889 --> 00:59:40,059
business because you overcommitted

2099
00:59:40,070 --> 00:59:42,210
to hiring, and your payroll will

2100
00:59:42,309 --> 00:59:44,059
put you out because it scales up

2101
00:59:44,070 --> 00:59:44,840
and down.

2102
00:59:44,969 --> 00:59:46,800
It rewards performance, not just

2103
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:48,610
time, which is really like, we

2104
00:59:48,610 --> 00:59:50,699
don't care if someone's working 80

2105
00:59:50,969 --> 00:59:52,429
hours a week or someone that's

2106
00:59:52,570 --> 00:59:54,840
working 40, as long as the output

2107
00:59:54,929 --> 00:59:57,070
is there, the performance, right?

2108
00:59:57,670 --> 00:59:58,619
And then it also creates healthy

2109
00:59:58,869 --> 01:00:00,369
competition, like, even amongst

2110
01:00:00,369 --> 01:00:01,079
themselves.

2111
01:00:01,260 --> 01:00:03,420
So, okay, I got to zip through

2112
01:00:03,420 --> 01:00:05,760
this because I'm already at the

2113
01:00:05,860 --> 01:00:08,460
one-hour mark, and I still, I want

2114
01:00:08,460 --> 01:00:10,969
to have time for Q&A, but there's

2115
01:00:11,019 --> 01:00:13,309
a decent amount left to still go

2116
01:00:13,679 --> 01:00:14,300
through.

2117
01:00:14,530 --> 01:00:17,039
Hopefully, at least, this is

2118
01:00:17,039 --> 01:00:18,219
valuable.

2119
01:00:18,429 --> 01:00:21,260
Hopefully, it's valuable.

2120
01:00:21,469 --> 01:00:22,929
Okay, I didn't even have to tell

2121
01:00:22,929 --> 01:00:24,510
you guys to put W's in the chat,

2122
01:00:24,510 --> 01:00:26,070
and you already are, so that tells

2123
01:00:26,409 --> 01:00:27,119
me enough.

2124
01:00:27,940 --> 01:00:28,800
So, thank you, guys.

2125
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,480
But the five-step hiring system

2126
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:32,369
for A-players, so define the role,

2127
01:00:32,369 --> 01:00:33,969
source the right candidates,

2128
01:00:33,989 --> 01:00:35,590
screen them properly, test that

2129
01:00:35,710 --> 01:00:37,409
they can actually do the job, and

2130
01:00:37,420 --> 01:00:38,980
then set them up for success with

2131
01:00:39,110 --> 01:00:40,460
proper onboarding.

2132
01:00:40,710 --> 01:00:43,019
Funny enough, the way you hire an

2133
01:00:43,019 --> 01:00:45,090
A-player is the same way you

2134
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:47,090
market and sell a client.

2135
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:48,599
And then the way you onboard an

2136
01:00:48,599 --> 01:00:50,070
A-player team member is the same

2137
01:00:50,070 --> 01:00:51,480
way you onboard a client.

2138
01:00:51,579 --> 01:00:52,780
So, it's actually the same.

2139
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:54,800
It's the same foundational skill

2140
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:56,960
sets and concepts, which is pretty

2141
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:57,539
cool.

2142
01:00:58,489 --> 01:01:00,320
So, the first step is to define

2143
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:02,380
the role scorecard, right?

2144
01:01:02,510 --> 01:01:04,340
So, the core responsibilities,

2145
01:01:04,340 --> 01:01:06,369
what are the required skills, what

2146
01:01:06,369 --> 01:01:08,190
are the performance metrics and

2147
01:01:08,199 --> 01:01:10,820
KPIs, what defines your culture,

2148
01:01:10,820 --> 01:01:12,099
and what is the reporting

2149
01:01:12,110 --> 01:01:13,889
structure and autonomy level?

2150
01:01:14,250 --> 01:01:16,300
Who are they reporting to?

2151
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:17,860
Who's making the decisions, right?

2152
01:01:18,030 --> 01:01:19,400
And the main takeaway here is you

2153
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:20,639
don't want to just create a

2154
01:01:20,639 --> 01:01:22,119
generic job description.

2155
01:01:22,309 --> 01:01:24,000
You want to define what excellence

2156
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,920
looks like in the specific role.

2157
01:01:26,679 --> 01:01:28,059
And here's the big thing.

2158
01:01:28,179 --> 01:01:29,829
If you're not abundantly clear on

2159
01:01:29,829 --> 01:01:31,340
what you're hiring for, the

2160
01:01:31,340 --> 01:01:32,869
candidates or whoever you hire

2161
01:01:33,230 --> 01:01:34,550
will not be abundantly clear on

2162
01:01:34,630 --> 01:01:36,679
what they're supposed to be doing.

2163
01:01:36,989 --> 01:01:38,780
And that is what results in low

2164
01:01:38,780 --> 01:01:40,699
performance, no matter how

2165
01:01:40,699 --> 01:01:42,989
talented the person you hire is.

2166
01:01:43,179 --> 01:01:44,889
We've probably all, including

2167
01:01:44,889 --> 01:01:47,000
myself, have hired A-players, but

2168
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:48,900
because the scorecard and the role

2169
01:01:49,150 --> 01:01:51,329
is not clearly defined, they look

2170
01:01:51,380 --> 01:01:53,949
like C or D or F-players, but it's

2171
01:01:54,219 --> 01:01:55,269
not their fault.

2172
01:01:55,769 --> 01:01:57,130
It's your fault, and you need to

2173
01:01:57,130 --> 01:01:58,639
realize when that's the case.

2174
01:01:58,849 --> 01:02:00,579
Finding A-players, like you need

2175
01:02:00,579 --> 01:02:02,250
to source and find them, it's

2176
01:02:02,250 --> 01:02:04,300
similar to cold email outreach.

2177
01:02:04,570 --> 01:02:06,639
It's a volume game, right?

2178
01:02:06,820 --> 01:02:08,260
And you should also, again, it

2179
01:02:08,260 --> 01:02:10,059
parallels marketing, sales, and

2180
01:02:10,059 --> 01:02:11,300
client fulfillment.

2181
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:12,400
You should never stop sourcing

2182
01:02:12,769 --> 01:02:13,650
talent the same way you should

2183
01:02:13,650 --> 01:02:15,349
never stop marketing, because what

2184
01:02:15,349 --> 01:02:16,960
this will allow you to do is build

2185
01:02:17,070 --> 01:02:18,699
a bench of talent before you need

2186
01:02:18,829 --> 01:02:19,110
it.

2187
01:02:19,230 --> 01:02:20,460
So, as you continue to grow,

2188
01:02:20,460 --> 01:02:21,809
you're going to start to hire a

2189
01:02:21,809 --> 01:02:23,369
lot more often, and going through

2190
01:02:23,369 --> 01:02:24,780
the five-step hiring process

2191
01:02:25,050 --> 01:02:25,940
might take you a long time.

2192
01:02:26,199 --> 01:02:27,739
And maybe you need, you know,

2193
01:02:27,739 --> 01:02:29,329
someone in that CSM role as of

2194
01:02:29,329 --> 01:02:30,239
yesterday.

2195
01:02:30,389 --> 01:02:32,239
So, if you build a bench and just

2196
01:02:32,239 --> 01:02:34,489
continue to source candidates that

2197
01:02:34,489 --> 01:02:36,309
you can just tap in, and like in

2198
01:02:36,369 --> 01:02:36,980
sports, right?

2199
01:02:36,980 --> 01:02:37,579
It's like a bench.

2200
01:02:37,789 --> 01:02:39,539
Like, if I need to swap someone

2201
01:02:39,539 --> 01:02:41,269
out, like I have a guy on the

2202
01:02:41,269 --> 01:02:43,239
bench warmed up and ready to go.

2203
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:45,000
I don't have to go find, you know,

2204
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,619
someone to bring to the team.

2205
01:02:46,739 --> 01:02:47,280
They're already there.

2206
01:02:47,489 --> 01:02:50,139
Screening them properly.

2207
01:02:51,070 --> 01:02:51,960
This is my framework.

2208
01:02:52,079 --> 01:02:53,510
It's attitude, competency, and

2209
01:02:53,510 --> 01:02:54,280
experience.

2210
01:02:54,489 --> 01:02:56,260
And then I'll go through, and I

2211
01:02:56,260 --> 01:02:58,489
won't hire anyone that scores less

2212
01:02:58,489 --> 01:02:59,940
than a six in any of these

2213
01:03:00,050 --> 01:03:01,050
categories.

2214
01:03:01,309 --> 01:03:03,030
And the key is, if you have a

2215
01:03:03,030 --> 01:03:05,420
co-founder or other team members

2216
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:08,000
that you really trust, have them

2217
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,539
do an interview as well and score

2218
01:03:10,550 --> 01:03:12,199
attitude, competency, and

2219
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:12,820
experience.

2220
01:03:13,519 --> 01:03:15,059
And then see how they compare to

2221
01:03:15,059 --> 01:03:15,619
yours.

2222
01:03:15,769 --> 01:03:16,719
And this is a good sanity check

2223
01:03:16,909 --> 01:03:18,420
because maybe you really like this

2224
01:03:18,420 --> 01:03:19,849
candidate and you're biased or,

2225
01:03:19,849 --> 01:03:21,070
you know, their, you know,

2226
01:03:21,139 --> 01:03:22,389
referral from a friend.

2227
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:23,980
And you just say their attitude,

2228
01:03:23,980 --> 01:03:25,449
competency, and experience is good

2229
01:03:25,449 --> 01:03:26,809
enough, but maybe someone else in

2230
01:03:26,809 --> 01:03:28,210
your organization sees something,

2231
01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:29,679
you know, that's flawed with their

2232
01:03:29,690 --> 01:03:30,869
attitude or flawed with their

2233
01:03:30,869 --> 01:03:32,150
competency that you should know

2234
01:03:32,150 --> 01:03:33,190
about before hiring.

2235
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:35,429
If they're a fit, then you test

2236
01:03:35,429 --> 01:03:37,480
their skills with a practical

2237
01:03:38,099 --> 01:03:38,500
evaluation.

2238
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:40,659
So the evaluation components are

2239
01:03:40,659 --> 01:03:42,559
role-specific assignments,

2240
01:03:42,559 --> 01:03:44,280
realistic scenarios, clear

2241
01:03:44,389 --> 01:03:46,210
evaluation criteria, and then

2242
01:03:46,349 --> 01:03:48,590
appropriate time constraints.

2243
01:03:48,719 --> 01:03:50,269
So example, test for different

2244
01:03:50,269 --> 01:03:52,050
roles, like a CSM, I'll give them

2245
01:03:52,050 --> 01:03:53,780
like a client scenario to handle,

2246
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,639
like a client requesting a refund.

2247
01:03:56,099 --> 01:03:57,480
How would you respond to this

2248
01:03:57,480 --> 01:03:59,389
client that's clearly aggravated

2249
01:03:59,389 --> 01:04:01,230
and clearly, you know, won't go

2250
01:04:01,300 --> 01:04:03,300
away unless we give them a refund.

2251
01:04:03,460 --> 01:04:05,210
Or if you're hiring a designer,

2252
01:04:05,210 --> 01:04:06,889
make a design of this as like a

2253
01:04:06,889 --> 01:04:07,559
sample.

2254
01:04:07,659 --> 01:04:09,079
Or if you're hiring copywriters,

2255
01:04:09,079 --> 01:04:10,550
write cold email scripts for this

2256
01:04:10,550 --> 01:04:11,039
offer.

2257
01:04:11,929 --> 01:04:12,920
Or a developer, do a coding

2258
01:04:13,079 --> 01:04:13,780
challenge.

2259
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:15,940
Or sales, do a mock call with me.

2260
01:04:16,079 --> 01:04:17,860
So you can see how they perform on

2261
01:04:17,860 --> 01:04:18,860
a sales call.

2262
01:04:19,070 --> 01:04:21,380
And if you like what you see from

2263
01:04:21,380 --> 01:04:23,670
the first four steps, you then

2264
01:04:24,030 --> 01:04:26,619
make the decision to hire them and

2265
01:04:26,650 --> 01:04:29,199
then set them up for success.

2266
01:04:30,369 --> 01:04:31,360
So you need a structured

2267
01:04:31,820 --> 01:04:33,090
onboarding plan, comprehensive

2268
01:04:33,090 --> 01:04:34,630
integration roadmaps, such as

2269
01:04:35,039 --> 01:04:36,119
introducing them to other team

2270
01:04:36,389 --> 01:04:38,070
members, clear documentation of

2271
01:04:38,070 --> 01:04:39,769
resources, access to necessary

2272
01:04:39,969 --> 01:04:41,579
information and tools, regular

2273
01:04:41,590 --> 01:04:43,380
check-ins, daily at first, super

2274
01:04:43,460 --> 01:04:45,389
important, consistent support and

2275
01:04:45,449 --> 01:04:47,380
guidance via one-on-one calls.

2276
01:04:47,610 --> 01:04:49,150
Like, this you have to take to an

2277
01:04:49,150 --> 01:04:50,179
extreme level.

2278
01:04:50,389 --> 01:04:52,420
Like, I just hired a really big

2279
01:04:52,420 --> 01:04:53,860
role at ListKit.

2280
01:04:54,059 --> 01:04:55,750
And I literally flew down to Tampa

2281
01:04:55,750 --> 01:04:57,639
two days early before our event,

2282
01:04:57,639 --> 01:04:59,039
that's this weekend.

2283
01:04:59,309 --> 01:05:00,750
And I flew in the guy I hired from

2284
01:05:00,750 --> 01:05:02,389
Texas so that we could spend two

2285
01:05:02,389 --> 01:05:03,900
days in person working close

2286
01:05:03,909 --> 01:05:04,670
together.

2287
01:05:04,949 --> 01:05:06,619
Because I know how important

2288
01:05:06,619 --> 01:05:08,789
onboarding and setting him up for

2289
01:05:08,789 --> 01:05:11,079
success is and how much, you know,

2290
01:05:11,130 --> 01:05:13,179
more valuable that is if we can do

2291
01:05:13,179 --> 01:05:14,250
it in person.

2292
01:05:15,690 --> 01:05:17,690
Early wins in confidence builders,

2293
01:05:17,690 --> 01:05:19,900
specific actionable feedback, and

2294
01:05:20,179 --> 01:05:21,809
then a gradual increase in their

2295
01:05:21,820 --> 01:05:23,239
responsibilities.

2296
01:05:23,449 --> 01:05:25,199
And that's when, essentially, the

2297
01:05:25,199 --> 01:05:26,780
training wheels come off.

2298
01:05:26,989 --> 01:05:28,940
But, again, I could put a

2299
01:05:28,940 --> 01:05:31,590
blindfold on so you can't see what

2300
01:05:31,949 --> 01:05:33,769
the screen is saying.

2301
01:05:33,909 --> 01:05:35,849
Or, like, yeah, you can't actually

2302
01:05:35,849 --> 01:05:36,800
see the words.

2303
01:05:37,010 --> 01:05:38,800
And you might believe that I'm

2304
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:40,719
talking about setting up new

2305
01:05:40,719 --> 01:05:42,349
clients for success.

2306
01:05:42,489 --> 01:05:43,480
It's the same thing.

2307
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:44,949
And the same way you set up new

2308
01:05:44,949 --> 01:05:46,559
clients for success is the same

2309
01:05:46,559 --> 01:05:47,889
way you set up new hires for

2310
01:05:48,280 --> 01:05:48,679
success.

2311
01:05:48,889 --> 01:05:50,820
And that's what's so cool about

2312
01:05:50,820 --> 01:05:53,489
hiring and fulfillment processes.

2313
01:05:53,690 --> 01:05:55,039
It's the same concepts.

2314
01:05:56,949 --> 01:05:58,750
And then I also use this process

2315
01:05:58,750 --> 01:05:59,579
for PIPs.

2316
01:05:59,579 --> 01:06:00,679
A PIP is a performance improvement

2317
01:06:01,230 --> 01:06:01,699
plan.

2318
01:06:01,909 --> 01:06:02,800
Because you're going to hire

2319
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:04,440
people that are not performing to

2320
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:05,690
the level that they need to be

2321
01:06:05,690 --> 01:06:06,500
performing.

2322
01:06:06,630 --> 01:06:08,079
So when that happens, you can

2323
01:06:08,079 --> 01:06:09,809
identify specific performance

2324
01:06:09,809 --> 01:06:11,090
gaps, create measurable

2325
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:12,820
improvement objectives, establish

2326
01:06:12,820 --> 01:06:14,559
a 30-day timeline, provide

2327
01:06:14,570 --> 01:06:16,659
necessary resources and support,

2328
01:06:16,789 --> 01:06:18,730
schedule weekly check-ins, and

2329
01:06:19,099 --> 01:06:20,679
then make a firm decision after 30

2330
01:06:20,980 --> 01:06:21,289
days.

2331
01:06:22,340 --> 01:06:23,239
The bottom line, important

2332
01:06:23,730 --> 01:06:25,429
takeaway here is we need to fire

2333
01:06:25,429 --> 01:06:26,949
fast to protect culture.

2334
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:28,269
But at the same time, we need to

2335
01:06:28,460 --> 01:06:29,260
give them a fair chance to

2336
01:06:29,260 --> 01:06:29,880
improve.

2337
01:06:30,050 --> 01:06:32,170
We need to give everyone we hire a

2338
01:06:32,170 --> 01:06:34,650
fair chance to improve while still

2339
01:06:34,659 --> 01:06:36,840
maintaining that mindset of we

2340
01:06:36,869 --> 01:06:38,340
need to fire fast.

2341
01:06:40,530 --> 01:06:41,500
So that's it, guys.

2342
01:06:41,809 --> 01:06:42,789
So this is the roadmap to

2343
01:06:42,789 --> 01:06:44,139
operational excellence.

2344
01:06:44,349 --> 01:06:46,760
Look at your current systems.

2345
01:06:46,940 --> 01:06:48,559
And if they don't exist, you know,

2346
01:06:48,559 --> 01:06:50,000
that's also a sign of where to

2347
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:50,500
start.

2348
01:06:50,710 --> 01:06:54,010
Create improved, design improved

2349
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:55,679
new processes.

2350
01:06:55,980 --> 01:06:57,960
Implement, like deploy new

2351
01:06:57,960 --> 01:06:59,179
operations.

2352
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:00,719
And then optimize, refine for

2353
01:07:00,719 --> 01:07:01,940
maximum efficiency.

2354
01:07:02,070 --> 01:07:03,590
So like at a high level, how do

2355
01:07:03,590 --> 01:07:05,400
you take everything that we just

2356
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:07,119
talked to and implement it?

2357
01:07:07,309 --> 01:07:09,340
It's these four steps, right?

2358
01:07:09,550 --> 01:07:12,300
And what does this actually look

2359
01:07:12,300 --> 01:07:15,199
like on a more granular scale?

2360
01:07:15,489 --> 01:07:17,090
Like in the next seven days, map

2361
01:07:17,090 --> 01:07:19,059
out your entire client onboarding

2362
01:07:19,059 --> 01:07:19,820
process.

2363
01:07:20,730 --> 01:07:22,360
Implement a weekly update template

2364
01:07:22,360 --> 01:07:23,980
and get feedback from the clients

2365
01:07:23,980 --> 01:07:24,480
on it.

2366
01:07:24,690 --> 01:07:26,440
And then begin a 72-hour task

2367
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:27,039
audit.

2368
01:07:27,250 --> 01:07:28,849
Like literally complete a 72-hour

2369
01:07:28,849 --> 01:07:30,559
task audit in the next seven days.

2370
01:07:30,559 --> 01:07:31,420
It'll be the best thing you ever

2371
01:07:31,500 --> 01:07:31,659
did.

2372
01:07:31,860 --> 01:07:33,369
And then in the next 30 days,

2373
01:07:33,369 --> 01:07:35,139
design a first role scorecard once

2374
01:07:35,139 --> 01:07:36,860
you've identified who your next

2375
01:07:37,079 --> 01:07:37,679
hire should be.

2376
01:07:37,889 --> 01:07:38,780
Automate three repetitive

2377
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:40,380
processes.

2378
01:07:40,590 --> 01:07:42,840
Create client health scoring

2379
01:07:42,840 --> 01:07:44,980
system to see like where each of

2380
01:07:45,159 --> 01:07:46,239
your clients at.

2381
01:07:46,550 --> 01:07:47,840
Who needs proactive outreach?

2382
01:07:48,039 --> 01:07:49,010
Who do I need to hop on a

2383
01:07:49,210 --> 01:07:50,440
one-on-one call with?

2384
01:07:50,619 --> 01:07:51,829
Who do I need to provide more

2385
01:07:51,829 --> 01:07:52,500
value to?

2386
01:07:52,710 --> 01:07:54,610
Who's, you know, potentially an

2387
01:07:54,610 --> 01:07:56,710
upsell or an expansion that's just

2388
01:07:57,230 --> 01:07:58,050
waiting to be had?

2389
01:07:58,289 --> 01:08:00,039
And then in the next 90 days, you

2390
01:08:00,039 --> 01:08:01,610
can make your first strategic

2391
01:08:01,610 --> 01:08:02,119
hire.

2392
01:08:02,329 --> 01:08:03,980
You can implement that hiring

2393
01:08:03,980 --> 01:08:06,210
decision with a performance-based

2394
01:08:06,210 --> 01:08:07,300
comp structure.

2395
01:08:07,639 --> 01:08:08,559
And then you want to establish

2396
01:08:08,980 --> 01:08:10,260
meeting rhythms for your

2397
01:08:10,260 --> 01:08:12,239
organization with proper review

2398
01:08:12,250 --> 01:08:12,909
processes

2399
01:08:13,079 --> 01:08:15,079
to ensure quality standards are

2400
01:08:15,079 --> 01:08:16,699
met across the board.

2401
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:18,170
So that's just how I would

2402
01:08:18,170 --> 01:08:19,659
approach a lot of this.

2403
01:08:19,869 --> 01:08:21,829
Obviously, it's also dependent on

2404
01:08:21,829 --> 01:08:23,720
where you're currently at.

2405
01:08:23,930 --> 01:08:25,079
Some of you might already have

2406
01:08:25,079 --> 01:08:26,710
teams and, you know, some of these

2407
01:08:26,710 --> 01:08:28,159
different things in place.

2408
01:08:28,359 --> 01:08:30,100
But at least, you know, check the

2409
01:08:30,100 --> 01:08:31,920
box on these things and see where

2410
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:32,970
that leaves you.

2411
01:08:33,390 --> 01:08:35,260
But there's a lot to implement.

2412
01:08:35,399 --> 01:08:36,670
And maybe you guys have, you know,

2413
01:08:36,670 --> 01:08:38,329
even more things that you wrote

2414
01:08:38,329 --> 01:08:38,720
down

2415
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:39,819
that you're going to go out and

2416
01:08:39,970 --> 01:08:41,600
implement immediately after this.

2417
01:08:41,810 --> 01:08:43,399
And I'd love to hear those.

2418
01:08:43,550 --> 01:08:45,439
So next actions, document your

2419
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:47,399
client journey from sign-up to

2420
01:08:47,399 --> 01:08:48,210
success.

2421
01:08:48,470 --> 01:08:49,359
Create templates for client

2422
01:08:49,649 --> 01:08:51,199
updates and communication.

2423
01:08:51,409 --> 01:08:53,359
Identify your highest value and

2424
01:08:53,359 --> 01:08:55,100
energy draining task.

2425
01:08:55,310 --> 01:08:57,159
Define the next role to hire for.

2426
01:08:57,310 --> 01:08:58,260
And then develop performance

2427
01:08:58,430 --> 01:09:00,100
metrics for your fulfillment team.

2428
01:09:00,310 --> 01:09:02,420
Like, what does success look like?

2429
01:09:03,189 --> 01:09:05,479
And some of the major themes from

2430
01:09:05,479 --> 01:09:07,789
this entire talk is it comes down

2431
01:09:08,149 --> 01:09:09,140
to clarity.

2432
01:09:09,369 --> 01:09:11,239
And for anyone, including your

2433
01:09:11,239 --> 01:09:13,090
clients and your team to have

2434
01:09:13,090 --> 01:09:15,750
clarity, you need to have clarity.

2435
01:09:16,050 --> 01:09:16,939
Number one.

2436
01:09:17,449 --> 01:09:20,109
And number two, progress is more

2437
01:09:20,109 --> 01:09:22,420
important than results.

2438
01:09:23,449 --> 01:09:25,479
And so lean into making your

2439
01:09:25,479 --> 01:09:28,050
clients feel like they're making

2440
01:09:28,409 --> 01:09:32,239
progress, not just results.

2441
01:09:32,430 --> 01:09:33,340
So important.

2442
01:09:33,829 --> 01:09:35,250
Much more scalable, much more

2443
01:09:35,250 --> 01:09:36,199
sustainable.

2444
01:09:36,409 --> 01:09:38,159
Your turn rate will thank you if

2445
01:09:38,159 --> 01:09:40,420
you switch your mindset on that.

2446
01:09:41,979 --> 01:09:43,590
My final thoughts before we go

2447
01:09:43,590 --> 01:09:44,300
into Q&A.

2448
01:09:44,510 --> 01:09:46,600
One, operations is the foundation

2449
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:48,640
that makes growth possible.

2450
01:09:48,850 --> 01:09:51,010
Again, even if it's the least sexy

2451
01:09:51,010 --> 01:09:53,449
of, you know, the marketing sales

2452
01:09:53,810 --> 01:09:56,649
and, like, the Christian Dan and

2453
01:09:56,689 --> 01:09:58,149
Daniel calls earlier this week.

2454
01:09:59,050 --> 01:10:00,239
It's what makes what they do

2455
01:10:00,239 --> 01:10:00,899
possible.

2456
01:10:01,109 --> 01:10:03,260
Like, you can't market and sell a

2457
01:10:03,260 --> 01:10:05,000
client into nothing.

2458
01:10:05,210 --> 01:10:06,260
Like, you have to be able to

2459
01:10:06,260 --> 01:10:07,359
deliver something.

2460
01:10:07,569 --> 01:10:09,619
Otherwise, you're a scammer.

2461
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:11,319
And that's going to be revealed,

2462
01:10:11,319 --> 01:10:12,720
you know, really soon.

2463
01:10:12,869 --> 01:10:14,069
And you're going to, you know,

2464
01:10:14,069 --> 01:10:15,140
have a rude awakening.

2465
01:10:15,300 --> 01:10:17,539
So operations is what makes growth

2466
01:10:17,539 --> 01:10:18,500
possible.

2467
01:10:18,710 --> 01:10:20,090
Systems create freedom, not

2468
01:10:20,090 --> 01:10:21,079
restrictions.

2469
01:10:21,750 --> 01:10:23,930
So get out of the thinking that,

2470
01:10:23,930 --> 01:10:26,390
like, systems are too strict and,

2471
01:10:26,750 --> 01:10:29,340
you know, they trap creativity.

2472
01:10:29,529 --> 01:10:30,210
That's just not true.

2473
01:10:30,420 --> 01:10:32,050
You should never slow down sales

2474
01:10:32,050 --> 01:10:33,750
and marketing because of your

2475
01:10:33,750 --> 01:10:35,399
fulfillment bottlenecks.

2476
01:10:35,750 --> 01:10:36,640
Again, you need to have that

2477
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:38,380
figure-the-fuck-out ability that

2478
01:10:38,380 --> 01:10:39,500
Daniel talks about.

2479
01:10:39,710 --> 01:10:41,600
The journey from you being the

2480
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:43,949
operator you currently are doing

2481
01:10:44,199 --> 01:10:45,710
the day-to-day task of the

2482
01:10:45,789 --> 01:10:48,119
business to becoming a leader,

2483
01:10:48,270 --> 01:10:49,470
like a true leader,

2484
01:10:49,689 --> 01:10:52,359
like we saw in that pyramid of

2485
01:10:52,359 --> 01:10:55,319
hierarchy, it requires you letting

2486
01:10:55,319 --> 01:10:57,539
go and trusting other people.

2487
01:10:57,710 --> 01:10:58,970
And the best way to trust other

2488
01:10:58,970 --> 01:11:00,539
people is to go through a really,

2489
01:11:00,539 --> 01:11:02,069
you know, well-defined hiring

2490
01:11:02,319 --> 01:11:03,399
process that I mapped out.

2491
01:11:03,779 --> 01:11:05,289
And then number five, I love this

2492
01:11:05,289 --> 01:11:06,750
one, is you should always be

2493
01:11:06,750 --> 01:11:08,340
striving to hire people better

2494
01:11:08,380 --> 01:11:09,050
than you.

2495
01:11:09,270 --> 01:11:11,430
Doing this will make number four

2496
01:11:11,430 --> 01:11:12,640
really easy.

2497
01:11:12,810 --> 01:11:13,739
You'll want to let go because

2498
01:11:13,989 --> 01:11:15,710
you're like, man, like, I'd so

2499
01:11:15,710 --> 01:11:17,819
much rather this person do it than

2500
01:11:18,039 --> 01:11:19,130
me because they're better at it.

2501
01:11:19,329 --> 01:11:20,600
And they have more time and they

2502
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:22,050
can fully focus on just this and

2503
01:11:22,050 --> 01:11:22,920
nothing else.

2504
01:11:23,130 --> 01:11:25,630
And once you get there, you have a

2505
01:11:25,630 --> 01:11:28,350
business that you can truly scale

2506
01:11:28,359 --> 01:11:30,510
in a very enjoyable way.

2507
01:11:30,810 --> 01:11:32,609
And you can capitalize on what

2508
01:11:32,609 --> 01:11:35,189
Daniel, Christian, and Dan already

2509
01:11:35,380 --> 01:11:37,189
spent three days teaching you

2510
01:11:37,369 --> 01:11:37,640
guys.

2511
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:38,850
So thank you so much.

2512
01:11:38,949 --> 01:11:40,960
I also made a workbook for you

2513
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:43,420
guys where you can just go through

2514
01:11:43,640 --> 01:11:45,899
different action items that relate

2515
01:11:46,170 --> 01:11:47,949
to the presentation.

2516
01:11:48,199 --> 01:11:49,680
And I would highly encourage you

2517
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:50,640
guys to do this.

2518
01:11:50,739 --> 01:11:52,869
I spent a lot of time on this

2519
01:11:52,869 --> 01:11:55,449
stuff and I used, you know, AI

2520
01:11:55,810 --> 01:11:57,229
tools to help organize it and

2521
01:11:57,229 --> 01:11:59,029
format it in a way that is super

2522
01:11:59,029 --> 01:12:00,640
interactive and easy for you guys

2523
01:12:00,729 --> 01:12:01,170
to follow.

2524
01:12:01,539 --> 01:12:03,289
But the underlying content, it's

2525
01:12:03,289 --> 01:12:05,100
all fully based on what was in the

2526
01:12:05,100 --> 01:12:06,789
presentation here today.

2527
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:08,539
So if you've got value and you

2528
01:12:08,539 --> 01:12:10,500
have, you know, some different

2529
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:12,310
notes on things you want to do or

2530
01:12:12,380 --> 01:12:13,850
things that you had as a key

2531
01:12:13,859 --> 01:12:14,619
takeaway,

2532
01:12:15,310 --> 01:12:17,359
like that workbook is going to be,

2533
01:12:17,359 --> 01:12:19,479
you know, one of the best things

2534
01:12:19,479 --> 01:12:21,439
for you guys because it's got a

2535
01:12:21,489 --> 01:12:23,560
lot of, you know, really clear

2536
01:12:23,689 --> 01:12:24,760
action items and things that you

2537
01:12:24,810 --> 01:12:25,630
guys can do in there.

2538
01:12:26,029 --> 01:12:28,699
So before I get into Q&A, I don't

2539
01:12:28,699 --> 01:12:31,590
want to forget to share this with

2540
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:32,590
you all.

2541
01:12:32,909 --> 01:12:35,020
And the nice thing is this Google

2542
01:12:35,020 --> 01:12:37,340
Doc also links back to the actual

2543
01:12:37,479 --> 01:12:39,140
gamma presentation.

2544
01:12:39,310 --> 01:12:41,109
So instead of just using the

2545
01:12:41,109 --> 01:12:43,600
presentation link, I'll send you

2546
01:12:43,859 --> 01:12:45,729
the workbook link and that has

2547
01:12:45,909 --> 01:12:46,449
both.

2548
01:12:46,670 --> 01:12:48,260
And so enjoy.

2549
01:12:48,470 --> 01:12:50,000
But that's it.

2550
01:12:50,199 --> 01:12:50,619
Thank you guys.

2551
01:12:51,430 --> 01:12:53,939
I'm going to take a minute to take

2552
01:12:53,939 --> 01:12:56,149
a sip of water and then I'll get

2553
01:12:56,510 --> 01:12:57,920
into doing Q&A.

2554
01:12:58,079 --> 01:12:58,539
All right.

2555
01:12:58,750 --> 01:13:00,859
And in the chat, I posted the

2556
01:13:00,859 --> 01:13:02,479
Google Doc link.

2557
01:13:02,689 --> 01:13:05,359
So everyone chill out in the chat

2558
01:13:05,359 --> 01:13:08,340
for a minute so that everyone can,

2559
01:13:08,609 --> 01:13:10,869
everyone can grab that.

2560
01:13:11,020 --> 01:13:11,109
Okay.

2561
01:13:11,289 --> 01:13:15,060
I'll send it one more time just

2562
01:13:15,060 --> 01:13:18,180
so, just so each of you guys can

2563
01:13:18,449 --> 01:13:19,529
grab that.

2564
01:13:20,159 --> 01:13:20,840
But okay, Q&A.

2565
01:13:20,899 --> 01:13:22,300
So there's 20 questions in here.

2566
01:13:22,390 --> 01:13:24,890
I got about 20 minutes to rip

2567
01:13:24,890 --> 01:13:26,279
through them.

2568
01:13:26,409 --> 01:13:28,079
So I'm going to go through as many

2569
01:13:28,079 --> 01:13:29,739
of them as I can in the time that

2570
01:13:29,739 --> 01:13:30,760
we have left.

2571
01:13:30,970 --> 01:13:32,239
And that'll be that.

2572
01:13:32,420 --> 01:13:33,760
But for a minute here, I got to

2573
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:34,939
take a sip of water.

2574
01:13:48,329 --> 01:13:48,600
Okay.

2575
01:13:48,810 --> 01:13:49,699
All right.

2576
01:13:49,909 --> 01:13:50,979
This is the last time I'm going to

2577
01:13:50,979 --> 01:13:52,220
ask you guys to use the chat.

2578
01:13:52,430 --> 01:13:54,109
But if that was valuable, and if

2579
01:13:54,109 --> 01:13:56,069
you're still here, and if you're

2580
01:13:56,069 --> 01:13:58,710
still wide awake, send whatever

2581
01:13:58,789 --> 01:13:59,479
you want in the chat.

2582
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:00,140
Just let me know.

2583
01:14:00,350 --> 01:14:01,239
Just let me know.

2584
01:14:01,369 --> 01:14:02,359
It doesn't have to be anything

2585
01:14:02,609 --> 01:14:03,239
specific.

2586
01:14:03,449 --> 01:14:04,340
Just blow up the chat.

2587
01:14:04,630 --> 01:14:05,390
Thank you.

2588
01:14:05,510 --> 01:14:05,630
Thank you.

2589
01:14:05,810 --> 01:14:06,000
Thank you.

2590
01:14:06,180 --> 01:14:06,619
Let's go.

2591
01:14:06,829 --> 01:14:08,180
Thank you guys.

2592
01:14:08,390 --> 01:14:09,039
Appreciate it.

2593
01:14:09,289 --> 01:14:10,180
Man, that was fun.

2594
01:14:10,609 --> 01:14:11,760
That was good stuff.

2595
01:14:13,850 --> 01:14:14,100
All right.

2596
01:14:14,310 --> 01:14:18,170
So Fabricio, what software do you

2597
01:14:18,170 --> 01:14:21,909
use to send automated emails when

2598
01:14:22,149 --> 01:14:23,829
onboarding?

2599
01:14:24,069 --> 01:14:25,680
ConvertKit is what I would

2600
01:14:25,680 --> 01:14:26,720
recommend.

2601
01:14:26,890 --> 01:14:28,380
But there's all different kinds of

2602
01:14:28,380 --> 01:14:29,800
softwares that you can use for

2603
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:30,260
that.

2604
01:14:30,470 --> 01:14:33,220
But ConvertKit is what I would use

2605
01:14:33,220 --> 01:14:34,119
there.

2606
01:14:36,170 --> 01:14:37,119
Can you talk through your whole

2607
01:14:37,319 --> 01:14:38,670
process for hiring and managing

2608
01:14:38,670 --> 01:14:39,319
sales reps?

2609
01:14:39,470 --> 01:14:41,420
So Kareem asked that earlier on in

2610
01:14:41,420 --> 01:14:43,430
the call, and I answered it with

2611
01:14:43,430 --> 01:14:44,770
the later part of the

2612
01:14:44,840 --> 01:14:45,319
presentation.

2613
01:14:45,489 --> 01:14:47,600
So check out literally like the

2614
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:49,420
last 15 minutes.

2615
01:14:49,420 --> 01:14:51,100
I went through the entire process

2616
01:14:51,100 --> 01:14:51,859
for hiring.

2617
01:14:52,039 --> 01:14:53,779
Managing sales reps is different.

2618
01:14:53,989 --> 01:14:54,880
That's more of what Dan does

2619
01:14:55,090 --> 01:14:56,539
because Dan manages the sales

2620
01:14:56,539 --> 01:14:57,020
team.

2621
01:14:57,229 --> 01:14:58,800
But a lot of the same concepts

2622
01:14:58,800 --> 01:14:59,439
apply.

2623
01:14:59,649 --> 01:15:00,539
Yeah.

2624
01:15:01,430 --> 01:15:03,739
Better for the partner who did the

2625
01:15:03,739 --> 01:15:05,899
call yesterday for the sales

2626
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:07,380
specific hires.

2627
01:15:07,590 --> 01:15:10,000
How much do you know?

2628
01:15:10,210 --> 01:15:10,989
How much?

2629
01:15:11,210 --> 01:15:12,760
How much do you know?

2630
01:15:12,970 --> 01:15:14,750
How much you should pay the people

2631
01:15:14,750 --> 01:15:15,539
you hire?

2632
01:15:15,689 --> 01:15:17,659
Oh, it's performance based.

2633
01:15:18,220 --> 01:15:19,180
And so, okay, so some of these

2634
01:15:19,710 --> 01:15:20,619
questions are already answered

2635
01:15:20,619 --> 01:15:22,359
later on in the presentation

2636
01:15:22,520 --> 01:15:23,460
when you put the question in here.

2637
01:15:23,829 --> 01:15:25,210
But if you have a follow-up

2638
01:15:25,210 --> 01:15:27,170
question or need more clarity on

2639
01:15:27,170 --> 01:15:28,430
that, let me know.

2640
01:15:28,810 --> 01:15:30,489
But the way we determine how much

2641
01:15:30,489 --> 01:15:32,239
to pay someone is performance

2642
01:15:32,239 --> 01:15:32,840
based.

2643
01:15:33,050 --> 01:15:34,409
Would you say having a full

2644
01:15:34,409 --> 01:15:36,279
website with an intro video is a

2645
01:15:36,279 --> 01:15:37,649
good way to onboard?

2646
01:15:37,949 --> 01:15:39,880
Yeah, you could do a website.

2647
01:15:40,090 --> 01:15:42,029
But like, I think that's a little

2648
01:15:42,029 --> 01:15:42,960
overkill.

2649
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:44,369
I think it's a nice way to stand

2650
01:15:44,369 --> 01:15:45,960
out and make it a great onboarding

2651
01:15:45,960 --> 01:15:47,319
experience for new hires.

2652
01:15:47,989 --> 01:15:49,460
But like, that's not what's

2653
01:15:49,460 --> 01:15:50,260
required.

2654
01:15:50,470 --> 01:15:51,939
Like, if you don't spin up an

2655
01:15:51,939 --> 01:15:53,619
entire website with an intro

2656
01:15:53,619 --> 01:15:55,710
video, you're going to be okay.

2657
01:15:55,949 --> 01:15:59,420
Focus on the elements that I...

2658
01:15:59,619 --> 01:16:02,329
Oh, actually, this would be for a

2659
01:16:02,329 --> 01:16:03,279
client.

2660
01:16:03,439 --> 01:16:04,380
But same thing, right?

2661
01:16:04,710 --> 01:16:05,359
Because it applies to both.

2662
01:16:05,510 --> 01:16:06,619
But yeah, like, you don't need a

2663
01:16:06,619 --> 01:16:07,279
full website.

2664
01:16:07,479 --> 01:16:08,529
Like, you could do it in a Loom

2665
01:16:08,529 --> 01:16:09,500
video and an email.

2666
01:16:10,909 --> 01:16:11,859
But again, you can make a really

2667
01:16:12,109 --> 01:16:13,510
good first impression if you have

2668
01:16:13,510 --> 01:16:14,720
something that goes a little bit

2669
01:16:14,720 --> 01:16:15,340
above and beyond.

2670
01:16:15,489 --> 01:16:16,439
But don't take too much of the

2671
01:16:16,819 --> 01:16:17,960
focus away from doing the actual

2672
01:16:17,960 --> 01:16:18,760
fulfillment.

2673
01:16:18,970 --> 01:16:20,930
Communication, like I said, it's

2674
01:16:20,930 --> 01:16:25,199
not about the quality necessarily.

2675
01:16:25,439 --> 01:16:28,199
It's more about the consistency of

2676
01:16:28,199 --> 01:16:28,760
it.

2677
01:16:28,890 --> 01:16:30,850
So like, clients value consistency

2678
01:16:30,850 --> 01:16:32,859
of communication more than like,

2679
01:16:32,859 --> 01:16:34,619
oh, like, that's really cool that

2680
01:16:34,890 --> 01:16:36,520
you put together an impressive

2681
01:16:36,550 --> 01:16:38,109
website just to make an intro

2682
01:16:38,180 --> 01:16:39,100
video for them.

2683
01:16:39,930 --> 01:16:42,250
Someone asked, what are the five

2684
01:16:42,250 --> 01:16:44,119
most important SOPs?

2685
01:16:44,329 --> 01:16:47,890
Again, I focus more on training,

2686
01:16:47,890 --> 01:16:48,930
not SOPs.

2687
01:16:49,350 --> 01:16:50,319
And I couldn't tell you because

2688
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:51,539
your agency, I don't know what

2689
01:16:51,539 --> 01:16:52,340
your agency is.

2690
01:16:53,060 --> 01:16:54,899
I don't know what the bottlenecks

2691
01:16:54,899 --> 01:16:56,760
are and where you're currently,

2692
01:16:56,760 --> 01:16:58,239
you know, needing help.

2693
01:16:58,550 --> 01:17:00,909
So do the 72-hour task audit and

2694
01:17:00,909 --> 01:17:02,949
go through the process that I

2695
01:17:03,159 --> 01:17:05,399
outlined to identify, you know,

2696
01:17:05,409 --> 01:17:07,890
what you need to systemize first.

2697
01:17:08,289 --> 01:17:10,539
What if you do sales?

2698
01:17:10,750 --> 01:17:11,850
Marketing will also handle most of

2699
01:17:11,850 --> 01:17:13,060
the comms, most of my employees

2700
01:17:13,060 --> 01:17:14,010
overseas, and usually a

2701
01:17:14,010 --> 01:17:15,060
communications gap.

2702
01:17:15,270 --> 01:17:16,699
Great question.

2703
01:17:16,909 --> 01:17:18,380
You have to hire someone to do

2704
01:17:18,380 --> 01:17:20,680
communications with your clients.

2705
01:17:21,329 --> 01:17:22,920
And if the overseas people are not

2706
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:24,649
capable of doing it because they

2707
01:17:24,649 --> 01:17:26,319
don't have great communication

2708
01:17:26,539 --> 01:17:28,729
skills, then you have to find

2709
01:17:28,869 --> 01:17:31,140
someone who's capable.

2710
01:17:31,350 --> 01:17:34,399
And we have overseas talent that

2711
01:17:34,399 --> 01:17:37,909
does customer communications from

2712
01:17:38,029 --> 01:17:39,300
Lebanon.

2713
01:17:39,510 --> 01:17:40,989
And we run a business, I run a

2714
01:17:40,989 --> 01:17:43,300
business called RemotelyX.com.

2715
01:17:43,439 --> 01:17:44,789
It's a hiring business,

2716
01:17:44,789 --> 01:17:45,760
recruiting.

2717
01:17:46,949 --> 01:17:48,579
And you can hire people from

2718
01:17:48,579 --> 01:17:50,739
Lebanon for cheap, and they're

2719
01:17:50,739 --> 01:17:52,899
really good in customer-facing

2720
01:17:52,899 --> 01:17:53,510
roles.

2721
01:17:53,699 --> 01:17:54,960
So check that out if that's, you

2722
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:56,479
know, something of interest.

2723
01:17:56,630 --> 01:17:58,420
Do you share wins as soon as they

2724
01:17:58,420 --> 01:17:59,119
happen?

2725
01:17:59,329 --> 01:18:01,079
Yeah, literally share wins as soon

2726
01:18:01,079 --> 01:18:02,119
as they happen.

2727
01:18:02,329 --> 01:18:04,000
No reason to wait.

2728
01:18:06,170 --> 01:18:07,420
What happens during the onboarding

2729
01:18:07,420 --> 01:18:08,649
call if I have a YouTube content

2730
01:18:08,649 --> 01:18:09,159
agency?

2731
01:18:09,350 --> 01:18:10,260
That's for you to decide.

2732
01:18:10,479 --> 01:18:11,920
That's the service you're selling.

2733
01:18:12,130 --> 01:18:13,939
So map that out.

2734
01:18:14,149 --> 01:18:15,039
What do you, what is your

2735
01:18:15,199 --> 01:18:17,100
onboarding and fulfillment process

2736
01:18:17,100 --> 01:18:17,859
look like?

2737
01:18:18,069 --> 01:18:20,140
That's, that's homework for you.

2738
01:18:20,350 --> 01:18:22,760
Can you give an example of how you

2739
01:18:22,760 --> 01:18:24,949
reward a desired action?

2740
01:18:25,289 --> 01:18:26,579
When do you bring it up?

2741
01:18:26,789 --> 01:18:28,199
And how do you phrase it?

2742
01:18:28,199 --> 01:18:29,500
Do you offer ongoing incentives?

2743
01:18:30,510 --> 01:18:32,539
Yeah, so again, like, if I know

2744
01:18:32,539 --> 01:18:34,460
that going through our sales

2745
01:18:35,079 --> 01:18:36,479
training will get them better

2746
01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:37,069
results,

2747
01:18:37,170 --> 01:18:39,630
I'll tell them if they go through

2748
01:18:39,630 --> 01:18:41,810
the training, they'll get a

2749
01:18:41,859 --> 01:18:43,850
discount, or they'll get, you

2750
01:18:43,970 --> 01:18:45,060
know, a $100 gift card,

2751
01:18:45,210 --> 01:18:47,079
or they'll get free bonuses that

2752
01:18:47,079 --> 01:18:49,029
they would otherwise not get if

2753
01:18:49,029 --> 01:18:50,239
they don't do it.

2754
01:18:50,489 --> 01:18:51,739
So that's all you really do to

2755
01:18:51,739 --> 01:18:53,239
reward desired behavior.

2756
01:18:53,449 --> 01:18:54,989
What's the best way to phrase a

2757
01:18:54,989 --> 01:18:56,949
client that you need them to do X,

2758
01:18:56,949 --> 01:18:57,699
Y, and Z?

2759
01:18:57,909 --> 01:18:59,529
Grant access, pay invoice, signed

2760
01:18:59,529 --> 01:19:01,220
contracts, sent assets, or else

2761
01:19:01,220 --> 01:19:02,500
you'll need to delay the current

2762
01:19:02,500 --> 01:19:03,149
timeframe.

2763
01:19:03,319 --> 01:19:05,649
It's, yeah, like, it's literally

2764
01:19:05,649 --> 01:19:07,710
like, hey, I want to make sure

2765
01:19:07,939 --> 01:19:09,930
that we get this launched for you

2766
01:19:10,050 --> 01:19:11,619
as soon as possible.

2767
01:19:12,270 --> 01:19:14,109
And we, we help you achieve your

2768
01:19:14,109 --> 01:19:16,319
desired goals and outcomes as fast

2769
01:19:16,319 --> 01:19:17,239
as possible.

2770
01:19:17,609 --> 01:19:19,319
And for, in order for that to

2771
01:19:19,319 --> 01:19:21,420
happen, I need X, Y, and Z.

2772
01:19:21,590 --> 01:19:23,130
Can you, you know, please get that

2773
01:19:23,130 --> 01:19:24,729
done, or can you please commit to

2774
01:19:24,729 --> 01:19:25,520
doing that?

2775
01:19:25,659 --> 01:19:27,579
So it's joint accountability.

2776
01:19:27,739 --> 01:19:29,850
It's always tying the things that

2777
01:19:29,850 --> 01:19:31,939
you need them to do back to their

2778
01:19:32,359 --> 01:19:33,420
desired outcome.

2779
01:19:33,630 --> 01:19:34,520
Okay.

2780
01:19:34,829 --> 01:19:37,109
Insight into tech recommendations

2781
01:19:37,109 --> 01:19:39,430
for 15 to 25K company.

2782
01:19:41,090 --> 01:19:42,270
Task management, I would do

2783
01:19:42,270 --> 01:19:43,939
Trello, knowledge base, Google

2784
01:19:43,939 --> 01:19:45,689
Docs, communication, Slack.

2785
01:19:45,989 --> 01:19:47,220
Those are the three.

2786
01:19:47,369 --> 01:19:49,189
My current business, I handle

2787
01:19:49,189 --> 01:19:50,760
sales and marketing.

2788
01:19:50,869 --> 01:19:52,430
He's, he handles fulfillment and

2789
01:19:52,430 --> 01:19:53,020
hiring.

2790
01:19:53,229 --> 01:19:53,380
Perfect.

2791
01:19:53,569 --> 01:19:53,609
Yes.

2792
01:19:53,970 --> 01:19:55,560
That's, that's the exact way you

2793
01:19:55,560 --> 01:19:57,109
should structure a business

2794
01:19:57,109 --> 01:19:58,939
partnership is someone should be

2795
01:19:59,159 --> 01:20:00,800
sales and marketing and someone

2796
01:20:01,069 --> 01:20:02,670
should be hiring and fulfillment.

2797
01:20:02,720 --> 01:20:04,520
I do hiring and fulfillment.

2798
01:20:04,710 --> 01:20:06,270
Dan does sales and Christian and

2799
01:20:06,270 --> 01:20:07,640
Daniel do marketing.

2800
01:20:07,770 --> 01:20:09,640
So we have even more co-founders.

2801
01:20:10,909 --> 01:20:13,899
But yeah, that's a good way to go.

2802
01:20:14,109 --> 01:20:16,869
What percentage of project revenue

2803
01:20:16,869 --> 01:20:18,710
do you suggest for CSM?

2804
01:20:19,090 --> 01:20:21,340
I mentioned that in one of the

2805
01:20:21,340 --> 01:20:22,380
slides.

2806
01:20:22,590 --> 01:20:24,029
Seven and a half to 12 and a half

2807
01:20:24,029 --> 01:20:24,680
percent.

2808
01:20:24,810 --> 01:20:26,430
It's going to vary depending on

2809
01:20:26,430 --> 01:20:27,979
the type of business and how

2810
01:20:27,979 --> 01:20:29,859
involved they are in the delivery

2811
01:20:30,010 --> 01:20:31,020
of the project.

2812
01:20:31,489 --> 01:20:33,060
But anywhere from seven and a half

2813
01:20:33,060 --> 01:20:34,619
to 12 and a half percent is

2814
01:20:34,619 --> 01:20:35,579
usually good.

2815
01:20:35,729 --> 01:20:37,159
But don't take those numbers, you

2816
01:20:37,159 --> 01:20:39,479
know, and run with them without

2817
01:20:39,479 --> 01:20:41,989
doing your own thought experiment

2818
01:20:41,989 --> 01:20:44,199
and calculating ROI and margins

2819
01:20:44,350 --> 01:20:46,479
and profit and all this sort of

2820
01:20:46,479 --> 01:20:47,279
stuff.

2821
01:20:47,670 --> 01:20:49,090
But at least that's a range that's

2822
01:20:49,090 --> 01:20:49,979
worked for me.

2823
01:20:49,979 --> 01:20:51,569
I run an email marketing agency

2824
01:20:51,569 --> 01:20:53,260
for e-com brands and have two team

2825
01:20:53,260 --> 01:20:55,029
members, tons of action items out

2826
01:20:55,149 --> 01:20:55,640
of this.

2827
01:20:56,270 --> 01:20:57,199
What would you say are the biggest

2828
01:20:57,560 --> 01:20:58,539
needle movers trying to figure out

2829
01:20:58,539 --> 01:20:59,420
what to prioritize?

2830
01:20:59,630 --> 01:21:01,520
Start with a 72-hour task audit

2831
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:03,060
and even have your two team

2832
01:21:03,060 --> 01:21:05,079
members go through the 72-hour

2833
01:21:05,189 --> 01:21:06,010
task audit.

2834
01:21:06,689 --> 01:21:08,649
That'll give you a lot of clarity

2835
01:21:08,649 --> 01:21:10,680
on where you should spend your

2836
01:21:10,680 --> 01:21:12,770
time or where you're currently

2837
01:21:12,779 --> 01:21:14,869
spending your time and how that

2838
01:21:14,869 --> 01:21:16,210
needs to change.

2839
01:21:16,550 --> 01:21:17,159
Okay.

2840
01:21:17,369 --> 01:21:19,109
72-hour task audit is usually

2841
01:21:19,109 --> 01:21:20,869
where I would recommend anyone

2842
01:21:20,869 --> 01:21:21,479
start.

2843
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:23,220
If you're confused, I'm like, I

2844
01:21:23,220 --> 01:21:24,590
don't know, based on this

2845
01:21:24,590 --> 01:21:26,289
presentation, what to do first

2846
01:21:26,289 --> 01:21:28,380
because it all sounds important.

2847
01:21:28,590 --> 01:21:30,250
Otherwise, like, if you're pretty

2848
01:21:30,250 --> 01:21:31,930
set on what your day-to-day looks

2849
01:21:31,930 --> 01:21:33,560
like right now and you're signing

2850
01:21:33,779 --> 01:21:35,310
clients but the onboarding is not

2851
01:21:35,319 --> 01:21:35,779
good,

2852
01:21:35,989 --> 01:21:36,920
like, onboarding is a great place

2853
01:21:37,100 --> 01:21:37,479
to start.

2854
01:21:37,579 --> 01:21:38,579
Or if you have a bunch of clients

2855
01:21:38,819 --> 01:21:40,149
and you're scared that they're

2856
01:21:40,149 --> 01:21:40,979
going to churn,

2857
01:21:41,189 --> 01:21:42,699
focus on, like, the weekly update

2858
01:21:42,699 --> 01:21:43,979
system and improving your

2859
01:21:43,979 --> 01:21:45,789
proactive communication, right?

2860
01:21:46,170 --> 01:21:48,029
How do you balance progress is

2861
01:21:48,029 --> 01:21:50,529
better than results and operations

2862
01:21:50,739 --> 01:21:51,819
with client and the results

2863
01:21:52,090 --> 01:21:53,260
promised in your offers that sales

2864
01:21:53,270 --> 01:21:54,319
and marketing put out there to

2865
01:21:54,319 --> 01:21:54,960
your clients?

2866
01:21:55,170 --> 01:21:57,750
Actually, the best way, the best

2867
01:21:57,750 --> 01:22:00,050
part about what Daniel teaches is

2868
01:22:00,130 --> 01:22:02,000
an offer with stipulations.

2869
01:22:02,359 --> 01:22:03,340
Stipulations are progress

2870
01:22:03,689 --> 01:22:04,560
milestones.

2871
01:22:05,359 --> 01:22:06,260
You can't get the guarantee

2872
01:22:06,689 --> 01:22:08,630
without doing the stipulations,

2873
01:22:08,630 --> 01:22:09,220
right?

2874
01:22:09,390 --> 01:22:10,319
You can't get results without

2875
01:22:10,640 --> 01:22:11,939
first seeing progress.

2876
01:22:12,109 --> 01:22:14,300
It's not just start, result.

2877
01:22:14,399 --> 01:22:15,880
It's start, progress, progress,

2878
01:22:15,880 --> 01:22:17,409
progress, progress, progress,

2879
01:22:17,409 --> 01:22:17,960
result.

2880
01:22:18,170 --> 01:22:20,460
And the offer is, it's guarantee.

2881
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:21,560
It's not just you sign up,

2882
01:22:21,560 --> 01:22:22,180
guarantee.

2883
01:22:22,300 --> 01:22:23,279
It's you sign up and then

2884
01:22:23,649 --> 01:22:25,020
stipulation, stipulation,

2885
01:22:25,020 --> 01:22:26,640
stipulation, stipulation,

2886
01:22:26,890 --> 01:22:28,239
stipulation, guarantee.

2887
01:22:29,010 --> 01:22:30,279
So it's the same thing.

2888
01:22:30,460 --> 01:22:32,720
It's just we call it performance

2889
01:22:32,720 --> 01:22:35,710
or, sorry, progress, milestones,

2890
01:22:35,710 --> 01:22:37,319
and results instead of

2891
01:22:37,590 --> 01:22:40,010
stipulations and a guarantee.

2892
01:22:42,229 --> 01:22:43,460
For context, you want to call the

2893
01:22:43,460 --> 01:22:44,180
email agency.

2894
01:22:44,180 --> 01:22:45,819
I want to know if the focus should

2895
01:22:45,819 --> 01:22:47,520
now be on AI or actual people, for

2896
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:48,239
example.

2897
01:22:51,140 --> 01:22:52,399
Some low leverage activities.

2898
01:22:52,550 --> 01:22:56,449
I'm a big proponent of AI is best

2899
01:22:56,449 --> 01:22:59,989
to assist existing team.

2900
01:23:00,310 --> 01:23:02,239
It's to get more out of your

2901
01:23:02,239 --> 01:23:04,140
current headcount.

2902
01:23:04,789 --> 01:23:06,649
So the answer is, most of the

2903
01:23:06,649 --> 01:23:09,029
time, you should hire someone to

2904
01:23:09,369 --> 01:23:10,479
then manage the AI.

2905
01:23:10,859 --> 01:23:13,020
So AI is going to allow you to get

2906
01:23:13,020 --> 01:23:15,000
more out of your human team

2907
01:23:15,460 --> 01:23:15,859
members.

2908
01:23:18,239 --> 01:23:19,550
I'm a new agency owner, so I'm a

2909
01:23:19,550 --> 01:23:20,319
first client.

2910
01:23:20,529 --> 01:23:21,699
About two weeks ago, I've been

2911
01:23:21,699 --> 01:23:23,130
focusing on and been making a lot

2912
01:23:23,130 --> 01:23:24,619
of mistakes on fulfillment.

2913
01:23:24,829 --> 01:23:25,720
What should I focus on?

2914
01:23:26,029 --> 01:23:28,840
Focus on onboarding to start and

2915
01:23:28,840 --> 01:23:32,260
then focus on ongoing engagement,

2916
01:23:32,300 --> 01:23:33,550
which happens through that

2917
01:23:33,560 --> 01:23:35,170
communications framework that I

2918
01:23:35,239 --> 01:23:37,630
spent like the first half of the

2919
01:23:37,930 --> 01:23:39,279
presentation on.

2920
01:23:41,079 --> 01:23:42,180
I'm currently stuck on how to

2921
01:23:42,569 --> 01:23:43,510
properly onboard clients into my

2922
01:23:43,510 --> 01:23:44,340
content agency.

2923
01:23:44,340 --> 01:23:45,439
Do you have experience on that?

2924
01:23:45,539 --> 01:23:46,819
On what answers to ask in order to

2925
01:23:46,819 --> 01:23:48,270
give them the best scripting that

2926
01:23:48,270 --> 01:23:49,340
is tailored to them?

2927
01:23:49,550 --> 01:23:53,659
That's tough because I don't run a

2928
01:23:54,119 --> 01:23:56,109
content agency.

2929
01:23:56,409 --> 01:24:00,199
But like, how to properly onboard?

2930
01:24:00,310 --> 01:24:01,569
Do you have experience on what

2931
01:24:01,569 --> 01:24:02,930
answers to ask in order to give

2932
01:24:02,930 --> 01:24:04,350
them the best scripting that's

2933
01:24:04,350 --> 01:24:05,359
tailored to them?

2934
01:24:05,569 --> 01:24:07,600
Yeah, I mean, I guess reverse

2935
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:09,220
engineer success.

2936
01:24:09,340 --> 01:24:10,890
If you have content that's doing

2937
01:24:10,890 --> 01:24:12,500
well or if you have clients that

2938
01:24:12,500 --> 01:24:14,399
are doing really well, what from

2939
01:24:14,619 --> 01:24:16,260
those clients enables you to

2940
01:24:16,529 --> 01:24:18,279
create really good content for

2941
01:24:18,289 --> 01:24:18,729
them?

2942
01:24:19,109 --> 01:24:20,399
Like, what do you know about those

2943
01:24:20,399 --> 01:24:21,729
clients that if you knew for the

2944
01:24:21,729 --> 01:24:23,170
rest of the clients would help you

2945
01:24:23,170 --> 01:24:24,449
write better scripts or create

2946
01:24:24,520 --> 01:24:25,829
better content for them?

2947
01:24:25,939 --> 01:24:26,939
It's usually like the obvious

2948
01:24:27,109 --> 01:24:28,359
things that like, what do you

2949
01:24:28,359 --> 01:24:29,500
create content about?

2950
01:24:29,710 --> 01:24:31,350
Like personal anecdotes and

2951
01:24:31,350 --> 01:24:33,739
stories, previous failures and how

2952
01:24:33,739 --> 01:24:35,840
you were able to overcome them,

2953
01:24:35,890 --> 01:24:37,539
success and accomplishments.

2954
01:24:39,430 --> 01:24:41,319
Just pure tactics and training.

2955
01:24:41,529 --> 01:24:46,130
What's your offer?

2956
01:24:46,390 --> 01:24:47,359
You know, what do you help people

2957
01:24:47,619 --> 01:24:47,819
with?

2958
01:24:48,029 --> 01:24:48,890
These sorts of things.

2959
01:24:49,109 --> 01:24:50,000
Getting clarity on that is usually

2960
01:24:50,260 --> 01:24:51,319
a good starting point.

2961
01:24:51,479 --> 01:24:53,489
At what point should you take the

2962
01:24:53,489 --> 01:24:55,739
initiative to offer a client?

2963
01:24:55,850 --> 01:24:56,600
How do you offer a client?

2964
01:24:56,829 --> 01:24:58,279
Smoothly.

2965
01:24:58,850 --> 01:25:00,989
When they become a problem child,

2966
01:25:00,989 --> 01:25:03,010
essentially, just like they

2967
01:25:03,420 --> 01:25:05,229
complain, they're too demanding

2968
01:25:05,409 --> 01:25:07,529
and it's worth getting your time

2969
01:25:07,529 --> 01:25:09,550
back more than it is getting paid

2970
01:25:09,819 --> 01:25:10,779
from them.

2971
01:25:12,100 --> 01:25:13,399
You have to have somewhat of a

2972
01:25:13,399 --> 01:25:15,239
tolerance, though, to put up with

2973
01:25:15,239 --> 01:25:16,729
pain in the ass clients because

2974
01:25:17,090 --> 01:25:18,409
there will be a decent amount of

2975
01:25:18,489 --> 01:25:19,989
pain in the ass clients.

2976
01:25:20,109 --> 01:25:21,039
And that's the reality of running

2977
01:25:21,050 --> 01:25:21,560
a business.

2978
01:25:21,680 --> 01:25:22,239
And that's okay.

2979
01:25:22,449 --> 01:25:23,989
That's why we have frameworks like

2980
01:25:23,989 --> 01:25:25,699
setting proper boundaries that I

2981
01:25:25,699 --> 01:25:27,050
taught you on this call so that

2982
01:25:27,409 --> 01:25:28,680
even if you have pain in the ass

2983
01:25:28,720 --> 01:25:30,529
clients, at least they're not, you

2984
01:25:30,579 --> 01:25:31,970
know, wrecking the way you go

2985
01:25:32,109 --> 01:25:33,449
about living your life.

2986
01:25:35,380 --> 01:25:36,100
How do you offer a client

2987
01:25:36,180 --> 01:25:36,739
smoothly?

2988
01:25:36,880 --> 01:25:37,960
You just let them know, like,

2989
01:25:38,149 --> 01:25:39,329
look, like you do it through email

2990
01:25:39,329 --> 01:25:40,550
or on a call and you just let them

2991
01:25:40,550 --> 01:25:42,289
know that, like, respectfully.

2992
01:25:42,510 --> 01:25:44,600
What you want from us is not

2993
01:25:44,600 --> 01:25:47,750
something that we can deliver on.

2994
01:25:47,989 --> 01:25:49,409
And I don't think it's fair for

2995
01:25:49,409 --> 01:25:51,380
you to continue paying us money.

2996
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:52,479
And I just don't think we're the

2997
01:25:52,789 --> 01:25:53,899
best service providers for what

2998
01:25:53,899 --> 01:25:54,960
you're looking for.

2999
01:25:55,140 --> 01:25:57,479
So best of luck with what you're,

3000
01:25:57,479 --> 01:25:59,770
you know, going to do next.

3001
01:25:59,979 --> 01:26:01,119
But that's it from us.

3002
01:26:01,329 --> 01:26:03,250
Can hire internationally or can I

3003
01:26:03,250 --> 01:26:04,680
only hire locally?

3004
01:26:05,010 --> 01:26:05,899
You can hire international.

3005
01:26:06,130 --> 01:26:07,670
Like I said, we have team members

3006
01:26:07,670 --> 01:26:09,979
from Lebanon, from remotelyx.com.

3007
01:26:10,189 --> 01:26:12,710
And I have team members in other

3008
01:26:12,710 --> 01:26:15,159
areas in the Middle East.

3009
01:26:15,199 --> 01:26:16,890
I have team members in Portugal,

3010
01:26:16,890 --> 01:26:18,689
some team members in the U.S.,

3011
01:26:18,689 --> 01:26:20,649
some in Canada, some in the U.K.

3012
01:26:20,659 --> 01:26:21,760
We have team members all over the

3013
01:26:21,989 --> 01:26:22,159
place.

3014
01:26:22,279 --> 01:26:23,680
So, yeah, you can do that.

3015
01:26:23,680 --> 01:26:24,180
No problem.

3016
01:26:24,390 --> 01:26:27,880
Is hiring for sales, delivery, or

3017
01:26:27,880 --> 01:26:30,770
admin of first priority?

3018
01:26:31,510 --> 01:26:34,369
Well, if you can't deliver work,

3019
01:26:34,369 --> 01:26:37,510
then why hire for a salesperson?

3020
01:26:37,729 --> 01:26:39,220
Because you're just going to sell

3021
01:26:39,220 --> 01:26:40,859
more people into a system that's

3022
01:26:40,859 --> 01:26:43,069
broken or actually just doesn't

3023
01:26:43,140 --> 01:26:43,920
have capacity.

3024
01:26:44,859 --> 01:26:46,260
So delivery is usually top

3025
01:26:46,260 --> 01:26:47,039
priority.

3026
01:26:47,250 --> 01:26:48,670
Unless, you know, you can handle

3027
01:26:48,670 --> 01:26:50,460
10 more clients, but you're just

3028
01:26:50,460 --> 01:26:52,220
not getting those 10 clients, then

3029
01:26:52,439 --> 01:26:53,250
hire for sales.

3030
01:26:53,420 --> 01:26:54,260
You just got to hire where you

3031
01:26:54,260 --> 01:26:55,220
actually have the need.

3032
01:26:58,000 --> 01:26:59,000
We don't have time for a screen

3033
01:26:59,180 --> 01:27:00,060
share right now.

3034
01:27:00,060 --> 01:27:01,689
I got a couple more questions in

3035
01:27:01,689 --> 01:27:02,159
here.

3036
01:27:02,369 --> 01:27:04,449
How has your experience been with

3037
01:27:04,449 --> 01:27:06,659
overseas talent and what should

3038
01:27:06,939 --> 01:27:08,930
cost expectations be roughly?

3039
01:27:10,640 --> 01:27:12,409
My experience with overseas talent

3040
01:27:12,409 --> 01:27:13,960
is they're as good as any other

3041
01:27:13,960 --> 01:27:15,329
talent I've worked with.

3042
01:27:15,500 --> 01:27:17,220
I have some of the guys that I

3043
01:27:17,220 --> 01:27:19,100
work with from Lebanon on this

3044
01:27:19,100 --> 01:27:20,949
call right now, and they're some

3045
01:27:21,020 --> 01:27:22,270
of the smartest people I've ever

3046
01:27:22,390 --> 01:27:22,899
worked with.

3047
01:27:24,430 --> 01:27:26,729
So, yeah, like, I would 100%

3048
01:27:26,729 --> 01:27:29,050
recommend working with people from

3049
01:27:29,060 --> 01:27:31,239
Lebanon, at least, as a starting

3050
01:27:31,270 --> 01:27:32,010
point.

3051
01:27:32,020 --> 01:27:33,800
I have experience working with

3052
01:27:33,800 --> 01:27:35,750
people from Canada, from the UK,

3053
01:27:35,750 --> 01:27:36,829
from Portugal.

3054
01:27:37,069 --> 01:27:38,560
The people I work with, it doesn't

3055
01:27:38,560 --> 01:27:40,479
really matter where they're from.

3056
01:27:40,619 --> 01:27:41,300
They're all really good.

3057
01:27:42,109 --> 01:27:43,920
In terms of cost, it's going to

3058
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:45,970
vary based on location, but you

3059
01:27:45,970 --> 01:27:47,619
can hire people for as low as

3060
01:27:47,729 --> 01:27:50,569
$1,000 a month, part-time, most

3061
01:27:50,579 --> 01:27:52,479
likely, from somewhere like

3062
01:27:52,479 --> 01:27:53,470
Lebanon.

3063
01:27:53,590 --> 01:27:57,119
I provide video editing services.

3064
01:27:57,329 --> 01:27:58,550
Should I hire for someone to do

3065
01:27:58,550 --> 01:28:00,039
outreach for me or someone to do

3066
01:28:00,039 --> 01:28:01,199
the editing for me?

3067
01:28:01,340 --> 01:28:05,340
I mean, it's like a chicken before

3068
01:28:05,340 --> 01:28:07,689
the egg, right?

3069
01:28:07,930 --> 01:28:08,819
What came first?

3070
01:28:09,970 --> 01:28:11,789
You need clients to do designs

3071
01:28:11,789 --> 01:28:12,319
for.

3072
01:28:12,430 --> 01:28:13,850
So, if you don't have clients,

3073
01:28:13,850 --> 01:28:14,899
then do outreach.

3074
01:28:15,109 --> 01:28:16,539
And then if you have too many

3075
01:28:16,539 --> 01:28:18,460
clients to do editing for, hire

3076
01:28:18,460 --> 01:28:20,430
people on the delivery side.

3077
01:28:20,649 --> 01:28:24,329
Could you share the original doc

3078
01:28:24,329 --> 01:28:27,479
so we can make a copy of it?

3079
01:28:27,930 --> 01:28:29,220
What is the original doc?

3080
01:28:29,430 --> 01:28:31,800
Yeah, we'll send everything in a

3081
01:28:31,800 --> 01:28:33,439
follow-up email.

3082
01:28:33,649 --> 01:28:35,500
Whatever's in the chat is what we

3083
01:28:35,500 --> 01:28:37,100
have right now, but we'll send

3084
01:28:37,100 --> 01:28:37,659
everything.

3085
01:28:38,250 --> 01:28:39,869
The Gamma doc and the Google doc

3086
01:28:39,869 --> 01:28:42,100
in a follow-up email for you guys.

3087
01:28:42,310 --> 01:28:45,779
Okay, the Gamma doc.

3088
01:28:45,779 --> 01:28:48,029
I'm pretty sure the Gamma doc is

3089
01:28:48,029 --> 01:28:50,960
in the Google doc that I sent.

3090
01:28:51,170 --> 01:28:52,140
It's hyperlinked.

3091
01:28:52,350 --> 01:28:52,449
Yep.

3092
01:28:52,600 --> 01:28:54,039
It's hyperlinked in the Google

3093
01:28:54,039 --> 01:28:55,460
doc, like I pointed out.

3094
01:28:55,609 --> 01:28:57,640
A couple more.

3095
01:28:57,640 --> 01:28:58,739
Do you hire employees or are they

3096
01:28:59,270 --> 01:28:59,439
contractors?

3097
01:28:59,649 --> 01:29:00,479
Everyone that I hire is an

3098
01:29:00,489 --> 01:29:01,659
independent contractor,

3099
01:29:01,659 --> 01:29:02,399
technically.

3100
01:29:02,920 --> 01:29:04,600
So, independent contractor.

3101
01:29:04,750 --> 01:29:05,899
How do you track A players if you

3102
01:29:05,899 --> 01:29:07,060
only pay on performance?

3103
01:29:07,270 --> 01:29:09,310
Well, you make the performance

3104
01:29:09,310 --> 01:29:11,569
incentives really rewarding so

3105
01:29:11,789 --> 01:29:13,220
that they end up making more money

3106
01:29:13,390 --> 01:29:15,350
if they perform than they would if

3107
01:29:15,350 --> 01:29:17,229
they were in a consistent base

3108
01:29:17,229 --> 01:29:18,050
salary role.

3109
01:29:19,510 --> 01:29:20,439
And A players love to be rewarded

3110
01:29:20,869 --> 01:29:22,199
for their performance.

3111
01:29:22,289 --> 01:29:24,720
A players are actually attracted

3112
01:29:24,720 --> 01:29:27,010
to performance-based pay because

3113
01:29:27,229 --> 01:29:28,060
they know that their performance

3114
01:29:28,329 --> 01:29:30,000
is what will make them the most

3115
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:30,470
money.

3116
01:29:30,689 --> 01:29:32,239
They're entrepreneurial is the

3117
01:29:32,239 --> 01:29:33,720
best way to describe it.

3118
01:29:35,930 --> 01:29:36,819
The doc is shared.

3119
01:29:37,149 --> 01:29:38,460
How do you do performance for VA

3120
01:29:38,460 --> 01:29:40,069
manual work that's needed to fill

3121
01:29:40,069 --> 01:29:41,789
the, like, how do you determine

3122
01:29:42,090 --> 01:29:42,840
the value of that?

3123
01:29:43,229 --> 01:29:46,279
It just depends.

3124
01:29:46,449 --> 01:29:46,979
What is the work?

3125
01:29:47,189 --> 01:29:49,439
What is the work that you're

3126
01:29:49,439 --> 01:29:50,779
hiring for?

3127
01:29:50,989 --> 01:29:53,210
There's not like a, oh, just pay

3128
01:29:53,210 --> 01:29:55,479
them this much or hire them this

3129
01:29:55,560 --> 01:29:55,960
way.

3130
01:29:56,449 --> 01:29:58,550
Like, there's not a, if this, then

3131
01:29:58,550 --> 01:30:00,640
that answer to that question.

3132
01:30:00,840 --> 01:30:02,390
You have to think smarter about

3133
01:30:02,390 --> 01:30:02,760
it.

3134
01:30:02,970 --> 01:30:04,939
What tools do you use to manage

3135
01:30:04,939 --> 01:30:07,300
tasks, work, and clients?

3136
01:30:07,510 --> 01:30:09,449
Really, again, like Google

3137
01:30:09,449 --> 01:30:11,819
Workspace, Trello, Slack.

3138
01:30:12,029 --> 01:30:12,819
That's it.

3139
01:30:13,069 --> 01:30:16,659
Are you hiring people full-time?

3140
01:30:16,750 --> 01:30:18,779
I almost never hire people

3141
01:30:18,779 --> 01:30:19,979
part-time.

3142
01:30:20,569 --> 01:30:22,199
Pretty much everyone that works at

3143
01:30:22,199 --> 01:30:24,119
any of our businesses is full-time

3144
01:30:24,119 --> 01:30:26,220
because they're fully invested

3145
01:30:26,489 --> 01:30:28,649
into their work at our business.

3146
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:30,060
If you don't have capacity or you

3147
01:30:30,060 --> 01:30:31,619
just don't need someone full-time,

3148
01:30:31,619 --> 01:30:32,880
then you can start someone off

3149
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:33,510
part-time.

3150
01:30:33,810 --> 01:30:35,590
Like, for a graphic designer, for

3151
01:30:35,590 --> 01:30:37,659
your email, like, yeah, they only

3152
01:30:37,659 --> 01:30:39,760
need to do, you know, 10 hours of

3153
01:30:39,779 --> 01:30:41,409
graphic design work every single

3154
01:30:41,649 --> 01:30:42,220
week.

3155
01:30:42,449 --> 01:30:44,640
Just pay them per email design.

3156
01:30:46,329 --> 01:30:47,710
And if they do 10, they make X

3157
01:30:47,710 --> 01:30:48,680
amount of money.

3158
01:30:48,770 --> 01:30:50,180
If they do 100, they make, you

3159
01:30:50,180 --> 01:30:52,180
know, 100 or 10 times that amount.

3160
01:30:52,390 --> 01:30:54,770
So, do you think that a contract's

3161
01:30:54,770 --> 01:30:56,199
always required?

3162
01:30:56,409 --> 01:30:56,430
Yes.

3163
01:30:56,829 --> 01:30:58,680
Test?

3164
01:30:58,890 --> 01:30:59,300
Okay.

3165
01:30:59,510 --> 01:31:01,649
Have you integrated AI into your

3166
01:31:01,649 --> 01:31:02,460
ops yet?

3167
01:31:02,659 --> 01:31:02,689
Yes.

3168
01:31:03,069 --> 01:31:07,659
Again, AI is a tool.

3169
01:31:07,829 --> 01:31:09,659
It's a sidekick to make your

3170
01:31:09,659 --> 01:31:11,689
existing team members more

3171
01:31:12,439 --> 01:31:12,840
productive.

3172
01:31:14,479 --> 01:31:15,579
So, that's how you should always

3173
01:31:15,750 --> 01:31:16,619
be thinking about it.

3174
01:31:16,829 --> 01:31:19,479
Most people think about AI as,

3175
01:31:19,479 --> 01:31:22,449
like, how can I outsource all of

3176
01:31:22,449 --> 01:31:24,210
my work using AI?

3177
01:31:24,350 --> 01:31:25,340
It's just not realistic.

3178
01:31:25,729 --> 01:31:27,949
How can I enable my team to

3179
01:31:27,949 --> 01:31:31,380
deliver higher quality work, more

3180
01:31:31,649 --> 01:31:34,869
volume of work, more consistently

3181
01:31:34,939 --> 01:31:37,329
on time, without changing anything

3182
01:31:37,630 --> 01:31:39,680
about the amount of time that they

3183
01:31:39,680 --> 01:31:41,810
spend working on the business?

3184
01:31:42,069 --> 01:31:43,899
Well, using AI, right?

3185
01:31:44,039 --> 01:31:44,899
That's how you should think about

3186
01:31:44,939 --> 01:31:45,000
it.

3187
01:31:45,300 --> 01:31:47,560
Do you think a performance offer

3188
01:31:47,560 --> 01:31:49,720
can scale at the same time as a

3189
01:31:49,899 --> 01:31:51,260
retainer offer?

3190
01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:54,739
If you're performing and if you've

3191
01:31:54,739 --> 01:31:57,170
found, you know, a system in which

3192
01:31:57,180 --> 01:31:59,439
you can consistently perform, but

3193
01:31:59,710 --> 01:32:01,689
in terms of, like, long-term

3194
01:32:01,689 --> 01:32:05,119
scalability, you'll find that most

3195
01:32:05,140 --> 01:32:08,579
agencies are retainer-based.

3196
01:32:08,949 --> 01:32:10,739
For the most part, maybe they're

3197
01:32:10,739 --> 01:32:12,880
retainer-based performance, but

3198
01:32:12,880 --> 01:32:14,600
you have, for the most part as

3199
01:32:14,869 --> 01:32:16,079
well, you have to start

3200
01:32:16,109 --> 01:32:17,649
performance-based.

3201
01:32:17,890 --> 01:32:19,250
Otherwise, no one's going to pay

3202
01:32:19,250 --> 01:32:20,710
you a retainer if you don't have

3203
01:32:20,710 --> 01:32:22,489
proper experience and expertise.

3204
01:32:22,789 --> 01:32:23,939
When hiring for CSM, are you

3205
01:32:23,939 --> 01:32:25,380
vetting for client success or

3206
01:32:25,380 --> 01:32:26,659
project management?

3207
01:32:26,789 --> 01:32:28,399
Do you have a job ad example?

3208
01:32:30,789 --> 01:32:33,460
When hiring for CSM, you're

3209
01:32:33,460 --> 01:32:37,170
looking for people skills, really,

3210
01:32:37,350 --> 01:32:40,029
because they're just doing

3211
01:32:40,069 --> 01:32:42,810
communication, right?

3212
01:32:43,029 --> 01:32:43,880
Like, they're not really doing

3213
01:32:43,920 --> 01:32:44,720
project management.

3214
01:32:44,930 --> 01:32:45,819
They're streamlining

3215
01:32:46,170 --> 01:32:48,449
communications between whoever's

3216
01:32:48,449 --> 01:32:50,579
doing the actual service delivery

3217
01:32:50,850 --> 01:32:52,310
and the client, right?

3218
01:32:52,479 --> 01:32:53,479
So, like, they're that bridge.

3219
01:32:53,670 --> 01:32:54,300
They're a connector.

3220
01:32:54,510 --> 01:32:55,399
They're a really effective

3221
01:32:56,010 --> 01:32:57,159
communicator.

3222
01:32:57,350 --> 01:32:58,770
How do you set up contracts for

3223
01:32:58,770 --> 01:33:00,130
clients and independent

3224
01:33:00,130 --> 01:33:01,100
contractors?

3225
01:33:01,229 --> 01:33:02,880
Do you make them one page max?

3226
01:33:03,090 --> 01:33:05,109
Most of them are much longer than

3227
01:33:05,109 --> 01:33:07,260
one page, and we have business

3228
01:33:07,659 --> 01:33:08,329
attorneys.

3229
01:33:08,380 --> 01:33:10,560
I'm not a lawyer or an attorney,

3230
01:33:10,560 --> 01:33:11,979
so I don't do that.

3231
01:33:11,979 --> 01:33:13,960
I outsource that to an actual

3232
01:33:13,960 --> 01:33:16,119
lawyer so that everything that

3233
01:33:16,119 --> 01:33:18,470
needs to be in the contract for an

3234
01:33:18,550 --> 01:33:20,439
independent contractor

3235
01:33:20,630 --> 01:33:22,470
or for a client relationship is

3236
01:33:22,470 --> 01:33:23,680
covered fully.

3237
01:33:23,880 --> 01:33:25,880
But, all right, that's it, guys.

3238
01:33:25,979 --> 01:33:26,640
We're at time.

3239
01:33:26,850 --> 01:33:29,189
That was a marathon, an hour and a

3240
01:33:29,189 --> 01:33:31,819
half of systems, operations, and

3241
01:33:32,039 --> 01:33:33,680
fulfillment sauce.

3242
01:33:33,970 --> 01:33:35,630
Hopefully, you guys got some

3243
01:33:35,630 --> 01:33:36,260
value.

3244
01:33:36,470 --> 01:33:38,600
And, again, last reminder for,

3245
01:33:38,600 --> 01:33:41,069
like, the 50 people who are still

3246
01:33:41,350 --> 01:33:41,920
on here.

3247
01:33:42,210 --> 01:33:45,140
Tomorrow is going to be the most

3248
01:33:45,140 --> 01:33:48,210
valuable day out of this entire

3249
01:33:48,289 --> 01:33:50,439
challenge by far.

3250
01:33:50,689 --> 01:33:52,359
Like, if you thought today was

3251
01:33:52,359 --> 01:33:54,319
good, if you thought yesterday

3252
01:33:54,319 --> 01:33:56,029
with Dan was good, if you thought

3253
01:33:56,100 --> 01:33:57,439
Tuesday with Christian was good,

3254
01:33:57,470 --> 01:33:59,100
if you thought Monday with Daniel

3255
01:33:59,250 --> 01:34:01,800
was good, tomorrow is going to be

3256
01:34:01,810 --> 01:34:04,399
even better, if that's even

3257
01:34:04,449 --> 01:34:05,680
possible.

3258
01:34:06,670 --> 01:34:08,489
And it's going to be Daniel to

3259
01:34:08,489 --> 01:34:11,270
start, but me, Dan, Christian, and

3260
01:34:11,270 --> 01:34:13,500
Daniel, all four of us will be on

3261
01:34:13,770 --> 01:34:14,270
there.

3262
01:34:14,409 --> 01:34:15,420
So it's going to be a lot of fun.

3263
01:34:15,829 --> 01:34:17,420
Like, that call, I so look forward

3264
01:34:17,420 --> 01:34:18,859
to it, and I hope to see every

3265
01:34:18,859 --> 01:34:20,359
single one of you on there from

3266
01:34:20,399 --> 01:34:21,460
start to finish.

3267
01:34:22,329 --> 01:34:25,310
It is quite literally, like, the

3268
01:34:25,310 --> 01:34:28,329
most valuable call that we host,

3269
01:34:28,409 --> 01:34:29,710
like, ever.

3270
01:34:30,010 --> 01:34:32,529
So, yeah, tomorrow can't come soon

3271
01:34:32,529 --> 01:34:33,380
enough.

3272
01:34:33,550 --> 01:34:34,789
And I hope to see all of you guys

3273
01:34:34,789 --> 01:34:36,270
there, and I hope that today's

3274
01:34:36,270 --> 01:34:37,619
session was valuable.

3275
01:34:37,829 --> 01:34:38,340
Thanks so much.

3276
01:34:38,550 --> 01:34:39,399
God bless.

3277
01:34:39,560 --> 01:34:40,500
See you all tomorrow.

3278
01:34:40,729 --> 01:34:41,039
Peace.
