1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,790
All right.

2
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:02,480
So what is a contract?

3
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:03,540
We're going to talk about client

4
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:04,440
contracts and just kind

5
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:05,629
of like how all this works.

6
00:00:05,629 --> 00:00:06,940
So it's a formalized agreement

7
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:08,669
between two parties outlining deal

8
00:00:08,699 --> 00:00:09,490
terms, right?

9
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:11,009
So like payments, if there's a

10
00:00:11,089 --> 00:00:12,859
guarantee, what's being done, like

11
00:00:12,859 --> 00:00:13,380
bullshit

12
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:14,210
like that.

13
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:15,910
So the contract examples I'm

14
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:18,059
giving you are example contracts.

15
00:00:18,109 --> 00:00:19,079
Your use of them

16
00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:20,800
does not constitute me giving you

17
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:21,600
legal advice.

18
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:23,019
This is not legal advice.

19
00:00:23,059 --> 00:00:23,980
Use them at your

20
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:24,480
own risk.

21
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:25,899
Consult the lawyer of your own for

22
00:00:25,899 --> 00:00:26,609
legal advice.

23
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:27,920
My providing of these example

24
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:29,960
contracts is merely to illustrate

25
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,829
how a contract works and provide

26
00:00:31,829 --> 00:00:32,710
an example.

27
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:33,460
If you were

28
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:34,649
to use them, it would require

29
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:36,500
editing to adjust to your specific

30
00:00:36,509 --> 00:00:38,039
situation and specific offer

31
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:38,829
being sold.

32
00:00:38,979 --> 00:00:40,789
Have I taken example contracts

33
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,719
from the internet or chat GPT and

34
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:43,740
use them myself

35
00:00:44,329 --> 00:00:45,500
personally in the past?

36
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:45,979
Yes.

37
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:47,969
I now personally do not do that

38
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:49,840
since I can afford an actual

39
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:50,960
lawyer to write mine.

40
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,520
Proceed with that information as

41
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,079
you will.

42
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:54,070
All right, cool.

43
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:54,750
So proceeding

44
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:55,549
forward.

45
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:57,700
So this is just an example of a

46
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:59,670
marketing funnel build out

47
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:02,000
contract between, it's going

48
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,119
to be using a retainer with no

49
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:03,920
refunds, right?

50
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,040
And then I'll show you another

51
00:01:05,299 --> 00:01:06,000
example as well.

52
00:01:06,019 --> 00:01:08,329
So just staying in disagreement is

53
00:01:08,409 --> 00:01:10,090
entered into as of date.

54
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:11,739
So what you'd want to do here

55
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:13,150
is, and the links to these would

56
00:01:13,329 --> 00:01:14,150
be below as well.

57
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:15,359
So what you would want to do,

58
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:15,900
you'd want

59
00:01:15,939 --> 00:01:18,650
to take these, copy everything, or

60
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:20,849
just go to file, make a copy.

61
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:23,560
It's entered into as of here by in

62
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,790
between client and agency.

63
00:01:25,099 --> 00:01:26,079
This would be a name field.

64
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:27,480
This would be a name field here

65
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,019
for yourself.

66
00:01:28,019 --> 00:01:29,290
So the way this works is you

67
00:01:29,629 --> 00:01:31,060
probably want to use DocuSign.

68
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:32,640
I think DocuSign is cheap.

69
00:01:32,689 --> 00:01:33,120
We use

70
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:33,810
PandaDoc.

71
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:35,439
PandaDoc is more expensive.

72
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:37,159
But generally people tend to use

73
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:38,810
DocuSign because of how cheap it

74
00:01:38,819 --> 00:01:39,230
is.

75
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:41,540
So what you do, the way contracts

76
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:43,939
work is that you upload, you would

77
00:01:43,939 --> 00:01:45,790
literally like go to file,

78
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,750
you'd go to download, and then you

79
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:49,590
would, you would download it as a

80
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:49,989
PDF.

81
00:01:49,989 --> 00:01:51,579
And what you would do inside

82
00:01:51,579 --> 00:01:53,329
of a contract software is you'd

83
00:01:53,329 --> 00:01:54,329
upload the PDF.

84
00:01:54,379 --> 00:01:56,090
And now it will take you through

85
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:57,370
what's called field

86
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,109
mapping.

87
00:01:58,109 --> 00:02:00,040
So what you would do right here is

88
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,739
you put a field, it's a field

89
00:02:01,739 --> 00:02:03,189
mapping and like person

90
00:02:03,219 --> 00:02:03,560
mapping.

91
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,409
So like for instance, you'd upload

92
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:04,700
it.

93
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:05,530
You'd be like, okay, two people

94
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:06,260
are signing this

95
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:06,769
contract.

96
00:02:06,859 --> 00:02:08,069
Client is signing the contract and

97
00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:09,139
I'm signing the contract.

98
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:10,270
So right here, you'd put

99
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:10,659
date.

100
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:12,680
And then you, I would assign the

101
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,219
date field to yourself.

102
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,000
Then you would put a name field

103
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:16,439
here,

104
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:16,939
right here.

105
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:18,099
You would assign the name field to

106
00:02:18,099 --> 00:02:18,590
the client.

107
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:19,500
And then you'd have a name field

108
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:19,979
here

109
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,259
that's assigned to you.

110
00:02:21,259 --> 00:02:23,039
So let's, let's go through scope

111
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:23,639
of work.

112
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:25,199
Agency agrees to deliver the

113
00:02:25,259 --> 00:02:25,719
following.

114
00:02:25,819 --> 00:02:26,629
So this is just where you list

115
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:27,460
your deliverables.

116
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:28,759
Here's what I'm actually doing for

117
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:29,259
you.

118
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:31,389
So this has like an example of an

119
00:02:31,389 --> 00:02:33,379
appendix where it shows like

120
00:02:33,379 --> 00:02:34,469
project specific,

121
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:35,620
specifications.

122
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:37,449
I personally never used this to be

123
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:38,560
honest with you.

124
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,639
It's, it's there just,

125
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:42,360
just to be there.

126
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,090
You can remove it.

127
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,250
You can leave it, but you got to

128
00:02:44,259 --> 00:02:45,500
understand that you would,

129
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,240
you would need to use the

130
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:46,639
appendix.

131
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:47,509
So this is, this is like a, for

132
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,360
instance, where you'd want to use

133
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,789
this if you specifically wanted to

134
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,879
use a certain software.

135
00:02:51,969 --> 00:02:53,110
So like if you were building a

136
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:53,560
funnel for

137
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,860
someone and you wanted to use

138
00:02:55,169 --> 00:02:56,610
click funnels, like this is saying

139
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:58,400
that we got to use, we got to use

140
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,409
click funnels, right?

141
00:02:59,409 --> 00:03:00,610
Cause you don't want the client

142
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:01,990
coming in and say, Hey, I actually

143
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:02,259
want

144
00:03:02,259 --> 00:03:02,699
to do this.

145
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:03,530
But when you only know click

146
00:03:03,789 --> 00:03:04,780
funnels or some shit, you get what

147
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:05,310
I'm saying?

148
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,849
So timeline

149
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,129
project will begin upon receipt of

150
00:03:08,129 --> 00:03:09,479
the initial payment and the client

151
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:10,620
submission of all required

152
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:12,389
information assets, estimated

153
00:03:12,389 --> 00:03:13,139
completion.

154
00:03:13,229 --> 00:03:15,069
And you'd have, um, you'd have a,

155
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:16,340
uh, uh, a thing right

156
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:16,949
here.

157
00:03:17,069 --> 00:03:18,900
Um, you, you just assign another

158
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,650
field for weeks to yourself.

159
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:22,199
Now you could just not have

160
00:03:22,219 --> 00:03:22,509
that.

161
00:03:22,509 --> 00:03:23,409
You can, you, you, you could

162
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:24,740
theoretically just remove that.

163
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:25,979
And it's just like vague about

164
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,229
the completion time.

165
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,099
So, um, client responsibilities.

166
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,340
Um, this is what you're requiring

167
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:32,120
the client to do.

168
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,310
They need to, they need to do all

169
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:33,800
of this.

170
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,159
Payment terms, ongoing fee, X per

171
00:03:35,419 --> 00:03:35,659
month.

172
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,189
There are no

173
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:37,430
refunds for any reason.

174
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:38,509
Um, revisions.

175
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:40,349
They can revise things two times.

176
00:03:40,349 --> 00:03:41,550
Additional revisions are about

177
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:42,389
a 200 hour.

178
00:03:42,539 --> 00:03:44,030
Upon final payment for each month,

179
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:45,360
all those become the property to

180
00:03:45,409 --> 00:03:45,960
client.

181
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,020
Um, you can see

182
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,169
what deliver the assets outline,

183
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,259
but does not guarantee specific

184
00:03:50,259 --> 00:03:51,300
results, such as lead volume,

185
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,419
cost per, uh, lead sales or

186
00:03:52,419 --> 00:03:53,909
revenue, unless explicitly stated

187
00:03:53,909 --> 00:03:55,460
in separate written agreement.

188
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:57,550
So again, this is a non, this is a

189
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:59,340
non-refund, uh, contract

190
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,659
confidentiality.

191
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,680
Um, you can't share

192
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,789
the shit termination.

193
00:04:03,789 --> 00:04:04,949
Who, when can the thing be

194
00:04:04,949 --> 00:04:05,639
terminated?

195
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:06,909
Limitation of liability.

196
00:04:06,909 --> 00:04:07,479
You're not

197
00:04:08,069 --> 00:04:09,319
responsible for shit.

198
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:10,969
Um, governing law.

199
00:04:10,969 --> 00:04:12,789
Um, I live in Florida.

200
00:04:12,789 --> 00:04:14,969
I put Florida, put your state

201
00:04:14,969 --> 00:04:15,740
there,

202
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,750
um, or country that, that, that

203
00:04:17,819 --> 00:04:19,430
works, that works too.

204
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:21,279
So this agreement, um,

205
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,750
um, so this is just saying the,

206
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:24,670
the, the entire agreement applies.

207
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:25,980
So now this, this is where

208
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,670
you would set, like, I would make

209
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:29,089
this, I want to make this a little

210
00:04:29,339 --> 00:04:29,800
bigger.

211
00:04:29,819 --> 00:04:32,670
So again,

212
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,589
this is where you'd set a

213
00:04:33,589 --> 00:04:34,939
signature field for the client and

214
00:04:34,939 --> 00:04:36,339
you'd assign the signature field

215
00:04:36,339 --> 00:04:37,129
to the client.

216
00:04:37,129 --> 00:04:38,790
Then you'd have a date field here.

217
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:40,240
You'd assign that date field to

218
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:40,949
the client.

219
00:04:40,949 --> 00:04:41,139
And then

220
00:04:41,139 --> 00:04:43,149
you have yours down here, which is

221
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:45,079
a signature field you'd assign to

222
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:45,899
yourself.

223
00:04:45,899 --> 00:04:46,759
And then a date

224
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:48,769
field you'd assign to yourself.

225
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:50,399
And then what happens is you

226
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:52,040
upload this and you send the

227
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:52,569
contract.

228
00:04:52,629 --> 00:04:53,850
And then what will happen is like

229
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:55,079
you assigned you yourself as the

230
00:04:55,339 --> 00:04:55,569
agency.

231
00:04:55,569 --> 00:04:55,980
So you put

232
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:57,889
your email address there, bam, you

233
00:04:57,889 --> 00:04:59,500
sign the contract and then they

234
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,889
sign the contract and then the

235
00:05:00,899 --> 00:05:02,259
contract is fully executed.

236
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,629
And then that, that's it.

237
00:05:03,629 --> 00:05:03,959
Right.

238
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:06,899
So now here's an example of one

239
00:05:06,899 --> 00:05:07,050
where

240
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:09,149
it's a performance guarantee.

241
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,810
Um, there's a, there's a

242
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,079
performance fee and a guarantee,

243
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:13,779
right?

244
00:05:13,779 --> 00:05:16,120
So there's all fucking different

245
00:05:16,379 --> 00:05:18,740
kinds of ways that, that, that,

246
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,180
that you, you could write

247
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,579
these things, but I'm just, I'm

248
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:23,079
just showing you these examples to

249
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:24,410
help you understand like how

250
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:26,100
things could be presented.

251
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:26,629
Right.

252
00:05:26,629 --> 00:05:28,519
So for instance, um, it's pretty

253
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:30,160
much all the same except for a

254
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:30,779
couple of things.

255
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:31,410
So like performance guarantee

256
00:05:31,829 --> 00:05:32,529
agency guarantees that the client

257
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:33,120
will sign at least

258
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,120
three clients of their own per

259
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,240
month, provided that the client

260
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,060
strictly adheres to the

261
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:36,620
eligibility

262
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:37,810
requirements outlined in section

263
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:38,220
three.

264
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:39,230
If the client does not sign at

265
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,319
least three clients in a given

266
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:41,509
month or request a refund, the

267
00:05:41,509 --> 00:05:42,769
terms in section four apply.

268
00:05:42,769 --> 00:05:43,980
So, okay, now we have section

269
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:44,319
three

270
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,610
eligibility requirements.

271
00:05:45,709 --> 00:05:46,860
To qualify for the, for the

272
00:05:46,949 --> 00:05:48,569
performance guarantee, the client

273
00:05:48,569 --> 00:05:49,360
must spend at

274
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,800
least $10,000 per month in ad

275
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:51,879
spend paid by the client, not the

276
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:52,329
agency.

277
00:05:52,329 --> 00:05:54,040
Maintain a minimum 15%

278
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,259
sales call closing rate in all

279
00:05:55,339 --> 00:05:56,560
calls booked by the agency.

280
00:05:56,649 --> 00:05:57,959
Maintain an active ad account in

281
00:05:57,959 --> 00:05:58,079
good

282
00:05:58,079 --> 00:05:59,310
standing throughout the agreement.

283
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:00,389
Maintain at least eight hours of

284
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:01,620
availability each business day for

285
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:02,829
sales call scheduled by the

286
00:06:02,889 --> 00:06:03,379
agency.

287
00:06:03,379 --> 00:06:04,629
Failure to meet any of these

288
00:06:04,629 --> 00:06:07,430
requirements voids the performance

289
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:08,620
guarantee.

290
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:09,240
Okay.

291
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,560
So refund policy.

292
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,589
If the client requests a refund

293
00:06:12,589 --> 00:06:14,490
due to failure to sign three

294
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,689
clients in a month, the following

295
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:17,019
conditions apply.

296
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,449
The client must provide proof of

297
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,180
ad spend of at

298
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,579
least $10,000 for that month.

299
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:21,689
Sales call recordings of all calls

300
00:06:21,689 --> 00:06:22,350
booked by the agency.

301
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,120
Proof that the ad

302
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:23,910
account is active in good

303
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,389
standing.

304
00:06:24,389 --> 00:06:25,600
Login access to all the sales call

305
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,290
scheduling tools.

306
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:26,819
If the client

307
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:28,040
cannot provide all four items, the

308
00:06:28,089 --> 00:06:29,129
refund request is denied.

309
00:06:29,129 --> 00:06:30,459
Refunds are limited to the last 30

310
00:06:30,459 --> 00:06:30,899
days of work

311
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,339
only.

312
00:06:31,509 --> 00:06:32,670
Performance fees paid are

313
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:33,959
non-refundable under any

314
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,000
circumstances.

315
00:06:35,009 --> 00:06:37,420
Payment terms.

316
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:37,819
Base fee,

317
00:06:37,819 --> 00:06:38,790
$5,000 per month.

318
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:39,910
Performance fee, 10% of gross

319
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:40,980
revenue generated from agency's

320
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:41,579
activities.

321
00:06:41,589 --> 00:06:41,889
Gross

322
00:06:41,899 --> 00:06:42,930
revenue is defined as cash

323
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:44,209
collected from agency's efforts

324
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:44,930
minus ad spend.

325
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:45,970
Performance fees are due

326
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,199
within seven days of each month.

327
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,470
Failure to pay within seven days

328
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:49,860
means that the agency reserves the

329
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,050
right to pause all advertising

330
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:52,009
activity.

331
00:06:52,009 --> 00:06:53,939
14 days, agency reserves the right

332
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:55,300
to delete the funnel created for

333
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,300
the client.

334
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,389
These are the client's

335
00:06:57,389 --> 00:06:58,360
responsibilities.

336
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,420
Intellectual property.

337
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,579
Funnels, ad creatives, and email

338
00:07:01,579 --> 00:07:02,850
sequences remain the property of

339
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:04,100
the agency until all fees based in

340
00:07:04,189 --> 00:07:05,519
performance are paid in full.

341
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:06,199
Upon full

342
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,430
payment, ownership of deliverables

343
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:08,370
transfers to client.

344
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:09,279
You get what I'm saying?

345
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:11,420
Like, again, I'm not a lawyer.

346
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:13,339
Like, you can write the shit

347
00:07:13,339 --> 00:07:14,860
whichever fuck way.

348
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:17,100
Like, you can upload it to ChatGPT

349
00:07:17,129 --> 00:07:17,959
and fuck with it if you

350
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:18,579
want it to.

351
00:07:18,579 --> 00:07:20,139
But that's not, it's not my, I'm

352
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:21,639
not giving you legal advice.

353
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:22,720
You get what I'm saying?

354
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,480
Like, I'm just

355
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,670
trying to convey to you, like,

356
00:07:25,269 --> 00:07:30,779
it's part, like, a part of a deal

357
00:07:30,779 --> 00:07:33,149
with the client are the deal

358
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,170
terms, right?

359
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:34,860
So you might hear this,

360
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,379
like, if you ever, like, if

361
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:38,480
everyone teaches you real estate,

362
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,420
you're getting involved in, like,

363
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:41,449
real estate investing.

364
00:07:41,449 --> 00:07:42,730
Like, real estate investors like

365
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:44,040
to say this thing where it's,

366
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:44,879
like, it's not

367
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:45,949
all about the price.

368
00:07:45,949 --> 00:07:47,290
It's also about the terms.

369
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:49,029
Like, sometimes terms of contracts

370
00:07:49,029 --> 00:07:50,000
are, like, big

371
00:07:50,589 --> 00:07:52,120
negotiation points where, like,

372
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,939
you can do certain things and,

373
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:55,560
like, you get what I'm saying?

374
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,060
I'm just

375
00:07:56,649 --> 00:07:57,769
providing these as examples to

376
00:07:57,769 --> 00:07:58,149
you.

377
00:07:58,149 --> 00:07:59,819
And you can fuck with them if you

378
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:00,970
want to, right?

379
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,199
But yeah,

380
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:04,259
the links to them will be in the

381
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:04,879
description.

382
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:05,290
Peace.
