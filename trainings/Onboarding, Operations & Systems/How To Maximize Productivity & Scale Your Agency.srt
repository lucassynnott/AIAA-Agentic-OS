1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:00,790
My name is Andy.

2
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:02,399
I'm the head of Student Success.

3
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:05,000
So I've made this kind of document

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:05,299
here in

5
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:07,790
presentation just because I've

6
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:10,269
noticed probably the most common

7
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,820
theme with students and client

8
00:00:11,869 --> 00:00:14,660
ascension, whether you are just

9
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:17,149
beginning or you are well into

10
00:00:17,239 --> 00:00:19,260
your agency, is just time

11
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:19,579
management

12
00:00:19,649 --> 00:00:21,120
and how to scale and people just

13
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,480
kind of really running out of

14
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:22,789
time.

15
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:24,359
And depending on your life,

16
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:25,670
whether you have a relationship,

17
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:26,929
family, whatever it is, or just

18
00:00:26,929 --> 00:00:28,559
realistically, most people just

19
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:29,769
kind of want to have some sort of

20
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:30,989
work-life balance to a certain

21
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:32,320
degree and typically don't enjoy

22
00:00:32,429 --> 00:00:34,170
working until 8 or 9 p.m.

23
00:00:34,179 --> 00:00:35,960
at night, you know, trying to get

24
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:37,689
up and catch up on tasks because

25
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,060
certain things come up.

26
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:40,539
And I found out when I reverse

27
00:00:40,539 --> 00:00:42,130
engineered like all my top 5%

28
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:42,740
students,

29
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,200
I was like, what was their common

30
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,329
habits and what do they do?

31
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:46,899
And basically I kind of crafted

32
00:00:46,899 --> 00:00:47,020
this

33
00:00:47,109 --> 00:00:47,829
kind of playbook of like

34
00:00:47,829 --> 00:00:48,820
realistically how you can craft

35
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:49,590
your day where you can get

36
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:50,130
everything you

37
00:00:50,149 --> 00:00:50,939
need to get done with your

38
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:52,460
business while also being able to

39
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:54,299
maintain your fulfillment, keep

40
00:00:54,299 --> 00:00:54,420
the

41
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:56,090
business operating, and be able to

42
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:57,520
finish up at a relatively early

43
00:00:57,530 --> 00:00:57,979
time.

44
00:00:57,979 --> 00:00:59,140
So you actually can enjoy

45
00:00:59,149 --> 00:01:00,240
a few hours of your life and your

46
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,439
day and maintain your hobbies and

47
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:02,600
your goals and things like that

48
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:03,090
as well.

49
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:04,439
Because sometimes you can get

50
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:05,920
really lost in, you know, just

51
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,260
like the business, the business,

52
00:01:07,269 --> 00:01:08,590
the business, and it can just kind

53
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:09,560
of get very consuming.

54
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,540
And you're basically on a, you

55
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:12,170
know,

56
00:01:12,189 --> 00:01:13,530
fast course to burning yourself

57
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:14,640
out as soon as possible.

58
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,140
So if you're not doing anything to

59
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:16,579
really

60
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:18,319
benefit your life or even make

61
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:19,909
this process even slightly

62
00:01:19,909 --> 00:01:20,780
enjoyable.

63
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:24,000
And yeah, you're not gonna

64
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:25,530
have a great time with it.

65
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:27,290
So how do people look from scale

66
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:28,280
your agency?

67
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:30,120
So this outline plan,

68
00:01:30,129 --> 00:01:31,560
is it going to be easy?

69
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:31,920
No.

70
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,079
Is it realistic?

71
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:34,379
Yes, very much so.

72
00:01:34,379 --> 00:01:36,250
So by following this guide,

73
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:37,430
you, and by the way, it'll be

74
00:01:37,569 --> 00:01:38,640
linked in the Kachabi below.

75
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,819
So don't worry, you can actually

76
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:40,540
read it in

77
00:01:40,549 --> 00:01:41,250
thorough depth.

78
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:42,269
I'm just going to give you an

79
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:43,519
explainer basically as much fast

80
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:44,000
as I can.

81
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:46,459
So this is going to offer you

82
00:01:46,569 --> 00:01:47,870
freedom of long-term stress.

83
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:50,109
The majority of our stress comes

84
00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:50,390
from

85
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:51,750
not getting things done on a

86
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,280
day-to-day basis that we need to

87
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,719
get done for the business.

88
00:01:54,829 --> 00:01:55,000
You

89
00:01:55,069 --> 00:01:56,219
need to do stuff that is going to

90
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:57,150
be for business growth.

91
00:01:57,189 --> 00:01:58,400
It's going to move the needle.

92
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:58,810
And then

93
00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:00,290
you also need to do the actual

94
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:02,140
work for your clients, manage your

95
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:04,549
team members, all that sort of

96
00:02:04,569 --> 00:02:05,250
fun stuff.

97
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,500
So organizing your time

98
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,390
effectively.

99
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:09,469
I've managed over 150 businesses

100
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,500
at this point.

101
00:02:10,508 --> 00:02:11,909
And the worst thing that you

102
00:02:11,909 --> 00:02:13,490
actually can do on a day-to-day

103
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:14,039
basis,

104
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,250
is what I've seen commonly, and

105
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:16,469
you're probably even guilty of

106
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:18,039
this from working with your SSE or

107
00:02:18,069 --> 00:02:19,810
even on a day-to-day basis, is the

108
00:02:19,819 --> 00:02:21,349
plan of your day is just way too

109
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:21,979
loose.

110
00:02:21,979 --> 00:02:24,520
It's just, there's no

111
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:26,039
finite kind of timetable.

112
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:27,539
There's no structure to it.

113
00:02:27,539 --> 00:02:29,039
You know, you're making some

114
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:29,840
content and then

115
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:30,789
you're putting out a fire with a

116
00:02:30,789 --> 00:02:31,840
client and then you're doing some

117
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,840
fulfillment and then you've

118
00:02:32,849 --> 00:02:33,990
scraped a new lead list or do

119
00:02:34,129 --> 00:02:35,409
something new generation or send

120
00:02:35,409 --> 00:02:35,960
some DMs.

121
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,400
And you're kind of

122
00:02:37,469 --> 00:02:38,250
doing everything in multiple

123
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:39,729
different kinds of avenues.

124
00:02:39,729 --> 00:02:40,960
And you're kind of messing your

125
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,460
brain around

126
00:02:41,469 --> 00:02:42,780
because now it's like, you know,

127
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,050
you're in one mode, you're in like

128
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:45,120
sales mode one minute,

129
00:02:45,129 --> 00:02:45,909
then you're in content creation

130
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:47,060
mode, and then you're in like

131
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:47,879
fulfillment mode.

132
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:48,800
And it's just

133
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:50,000
throwing you way out of sync.

134
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:51,259
It's actually much better if you

135
00:02:51,259 --> 00:02:52,479
can just kind of try and do your

136
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:53,939
best to batch everything up.

137
00:02:53,939 --> 00:02:55,610
And if you are, especially in the

138
00:02:55,629 --> 00:02:56,939
beginning phases of your

139
00:02:56,949 --> 00:02:58,050
business, this is absolutely going

140
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:58,740
to be perfect for you.

141
00:02:58,770 --> 00:02:59,969
And you need to implement this as

142
00:02:59,969 --> 00:03:00,259
soon as

143
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:01,280
absolutely possible.

144
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,430
And if you are for the guys that

145
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:03,770
feel like they have this kind of

146
00:03:03,789 --> 00:03:04,259
like mixed

147
00:03:04,389 --> 00:03:05,550
cocktail of a day where every day

148
00:03:05,669 --> 00:03:06,840
seems to be completely different,

149
00:03:06,849 --> 00:03:07,919
that there's no structure

150
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:08,280
to it.

151
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,699
This is how you can also just pull

152
00:03:09,699 --> 00:03:11,250
everything back and start working

153
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:12,319
more effectively.

154
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:13,939
So this is based off all the most

155
00:03:13,939 --> 00:03:15,669
successful students I've worked

156
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,080
with.

157
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:18,620
So the gold in rule

158
00:03:18,629 --> 00:03:20,370
is you actually just need to get

159
00:03:20,379 --> 00:03:22,159
up early and do your, you do your

160
00:03:22,259 --> 00:03:23,919
work for your business early in

161
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,080
the

162
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:24,490
morning.

163
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:25,530
This is if you actually want to

164
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:26,669
have proper work-life balance.

165
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:27,580
If you're someone who

166
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:29,310
prefers working late tonight,

167
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:30,169
that's all you.

168
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:31,860
You go ahead, you enjoy it.

169
00:03:31,969 --> 00:03:33,430
I typically don't find it

170
00:03:33,449 --> 00:03:34,189
too productive.

171
00:03:34,189 --> 00:03:35,310
I find like when you've done a

172
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:36,580
whole day of fulfillment work and

173
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,719
calls, then you're

174
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,039
trying to do something to move the

175
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:39,460
needle.

176
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:40,750
There's not really too much brain

177
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:41,740
power left for you at the

178
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:42,080
end.

179
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,819
These things require brain power.

180
00:03:43,819 --> 00:03:45,479
These are things that are actually

181
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:46,800
going to have an effect on

182
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:47,330
the business.

183
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,229
So it's better to do it first

184
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:49,280
thing in the morning and just get

185
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:49,870
it off your back

186
00:03:49,889 --> 00:03:51,969
instead of leaving it for the end.

187
00:03:51,969 --> 00:03:53,419
It's always best to get the

188
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,180
hardest stuff done first.

189
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:57,569
And as much as you hate to admit

190
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:58,620
it, it is true.

191
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,379
You have to be an early riser.

192
00:04:00,509 --> 00:04:01,120
You have to get

193
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:03,379
stuff done when people are asleep,

194
00:04:03,379 --> 00:04:05,199
where clients basically can't

195
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:07,210
reach you, where your team members

196
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:08,090
can't reach you, where

197
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:09,610
realistically you need to find

198
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:10,960
three or four hours in your day,

199
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,580
five hours of

200
00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:13,229
your day, where you are not going

201
00:04:13,229 --> 00:04:14,460
to be bothered on Slack.

202
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,860
You're just going to be really

203
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:16,480
left alone.

204
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:17,790
And that is best to do when the

205
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:19,069
earth is still asleep, when

206
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:20,480
everyone's still asleep, when

207
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:22,470
everyone's, you know, not paying

208
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,720
any attention to you.

209
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:25,160
6 a.m.

210
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:26,060
to 10 a.m.

211
00:04:26,069 --> 00:04:27,480
is gold, you know, but even

212
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:28,480
9 or 9.30.

213
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,829
Now, the reason why I say even up

214
00:04:29,829 --> 00:04:30,620
to 10 a.m.

215
00:04:30,629 --> 00:04:32,589
is because realistically, not many

216
00:04:32,589 --> 00:04:33,000
of us are

217
00:04:33,089 --> 00:04:34,560
taking sales calls at 9 a.m.

218
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,019
It's probably once in a blue moon,

219
00:04:36,019 --> 00:04:36,829
realistically.

220
00:04:36,939 --> 00:04:37,990
And even then, did you

221
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:38,209
have to?

222
00:04:38,329 --> 00:04:38,980
It could have been 10.

223
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,949
Your team members aren't really

224
00:04:40,949 --> 00:04:43,019
coming at you with any fires that

225
00:04:43,019 --> 00:04:43,100
need

226
00:04:43,129 --> 00:04:43,509
to be put out.

227
00:04:43,509 --> 00:04:44,439
Your clients aren't really asking

228
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:45,300
too much of your attention.

229
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:46,470
So you can kind of get that

230
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:47,839
extra hour in and out of the day

231
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:49,399
anyway, which is actually quite

232
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:50,720
useful and beneficial.

233
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,000
So from

234
00:04:52,069 --> 00:04:52,720
6 a.m.

235
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,689
to 10 a.m.

236
00:04:53,689 --> 00:04:54,230
is gold.

237
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:55,790
And what you're going to do here

238
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:57,360
is you're going to set a timer for

239
00:04:57,439 --> 00:04:57,920
a 15

240
00:04:57,970 --> 00:04:59,910
minute sprint to focus on one

241
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:01,079
specific task.

242
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,589
You know, give yourself a breather

243
00:05:03,589 --> 00:05:05,319
in between as well,

244
00:05:05,329 --> 00:05:07,110
like give yourself 10 minutes, you

245
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:08,670
know, go outside for a quick walk,

246
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:10,370
make a cup of coffee, use the

247
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,000
bathroom, do some push-ups, listen

248
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,449
to some music, pray, meditate,

249
00:05:13,449 --> 00:05:14,759
whatever you feel like, you know,

250
00:05:14,769 --> 00:05:16,199
something that's just going to

251
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:17,569
help you just kind of give your

252
00:05:17,569 --> 00:05:18,939
brain kind of a little bit of a

253
00:05:18,939 --> 00:05:19,259
rest.

254
00:05:19,269 --> 00:05:20,589
But what to not do under

255
00:05:20,589 --> 00:05:22,800
absolutely no circumstances

256
00:05:22,899 --> 00:05:25,389
whatsoever is anything that's

257
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:26,199
going to be a quick

258
00:05:26,209 --> 00:05:28,279
dopamine hit or a vice.

259
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:30,769
And that means no phones, no

260
00:05:30,889 --> 00:05:33,949
social media, no YouTube, no TV,

261
00:05:34,089 --> 00:05:35,209
no video games,

262
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:37,209
like just keep your phone away

263
00:05:37,209 --> 00:05:37,930
from you.

264
00:05:38,089 --> 00:05:40,589
Like you're, you know, put your

265
00:05:40,589 --> 00:05:42,100
phone on like airplane

266
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:43,610
mode if you need to and use it

267
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:45,110
only strictly as a timer.

268
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,930
Do not go on any of these apps.

269
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:48,899
They will completely distract you.

270
00:05:48,899 --> 00:05:50,029
That's how you fall into

271
00:05:50,029 --> 00:05:51,870
daydreaming and your concentration

272
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,490
breaks

273
00:05:52,569 --> 00:05:54,050
and your focus breaks.

274
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:56,310
Like, you know, we're only human.

275
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:58,079
We get easily distracted, but you

276
00:05:58,079 --> 00:05:58,860
really need

277
00:05:58,870 --> 00:05:59,939
to be disciplined about this.

278
00:05:59,939 --> 00:06:01,120
Like this is a category here where

279
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,620
it's like, you really can't

280
00:06:02,689 --> 00:06:03,470
dick around.

281
00:06:03,579 --> 00:06:05,269
And I really can't stress that

282
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:07,089
enough because once you start

283
00:06:07,089 --> 00:06:09,139
entertaining, like those

284
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:10,410
ideas and thoughts of like, Oh,

285
00:06:10,449 --> 00:06:11,670
well, what if, or whatever, or

286
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:12,920
you're scrolling on Instagram,

287
00:06:13,019 --> 00:06:13,160
it's

288
00:06:13,269 --> 00:06:14,689
like, Oh, she's pretty cute.

289
00:06:14,689 --> 00:06:16,139
My texts are whatever your brains

290
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:16,800
you're gone.

291
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,959
You're just gone, dude.

292
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:19,639
You just, you're not going to get

293
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:20,139
it back.

294
00:06:20,209 --> 00:06:21,870
It's like watching a movie and you

295
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:23,000
zoned out or you're on

296
00:06:23,009 --> 00:06:24,290
your phone for it for 50, you

297
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:25,180
know, 50% of it.

298
00:06:25,189 --> 00:06:26,149
Like, did you watch it?

299
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,000
No, you didn't.

300
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:27,560
You know,

301
00:06:27,569 --> 00:06:28,290
you zoned out.

302
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:29,709
You didn't actually consume the

303
00:06:29,709 --> 00:06:30,860
movie that you were kind of

304
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:31,819
watching because you

305
00:06:31,829 --> 00:06:33,019
kept checking your phone.

306
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:34,379
It's, this is very much the same

307
00:06:34,379 --> 00:06:34,779
thing.

308
00:06:34,779 --> 00:06:36,240
Just lock in and stay focused.

309
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:38,300
And it's really not that bad once

310
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,160
you get used to it as well.

311
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,829
Um, so, and again, it's like going

312
00:06:43,829 --> 00:06:43,970
to

313
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:45,129
the gym as well and just like

314
00:06:45,269 --> 00:06:46,389
spending more time talking to

315
00:06:46,389 --> 00:06:47,939
people and getting ready and doing

316
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:48,379
stretching.

317
00:06:48,379 --> 00:06:49,360
It's like, you didn't actually get

318
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,279
a workout in, you know, you did a

319
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:50,879
couple of bumps.

320
00:06:50,889 --> 00:06:52,449
You didn't actually do shit.

321
00:06:52,449 --> 00:06:54,629
So now to achieve your goal, you

322
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:57,459
know, and by neglecting these

323
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:58,670
things as well, you're just asking

324
00:06:58,750 --> 00:06:59,649
yourself to be stressed.

325
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:00,920
Like the majority of your stress

326
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,160
comes

327
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,839
from generally not doing the work

328
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:03,920
that you need to do.

329
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,439
You didn't do the work that was

330
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:05,990
absolutely

331
00:07:06,029 --> 00:07:07,430
necessary for you to like

332
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:09,139
generally feel at ease for your

333
00:07:09,259 --> 00:07:09,560
day.

334
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,540
You know, going, you can go for as

335
00:07:11,629 --> 00:07:12,600
many walks as you want.

336
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,819
You can puff your vape as much as

337
00:07:13,819 --> 00:07:14,379
you need to.

338
00:07:14,379 --> 00:07:15,500
You can pop as many zins.

339
00:07:15,509 --> 00:07:16,939
Your stress isn't going to go away

340
00:07:16,939 --> 00:07:18,399
because you just actually didn't

341
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:19,500
do the work that you know you

342
00:07:19,629 --> 00:07:21,230
needed to get done that day.

343
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:23,029
You're just not going to feel good

344
00:07:23,029 --> 00:07:23,620
about it.

345
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:24,060
So,

346
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:26,129
and this is also how people have

347
00:07:26,129 --> 00:07:28,220
these things called what I call

348
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,579
white noise days.

349
00:07:29,629 --> 00:07:30,930
These are days, and I think

350
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:32,529
everyone's had them before where

351
00:07:32,529 --> 00:07:33,889
you think back to yourself and

352
00:07:34,009 --> 00:07:34,160
think,

353
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:35,790
what the fuck did I do today?

354
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:37,029
Like what happened?

355
00:07:37,029 --> 00:07:39,209
Like what, where did the day go

356
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:39,970
wrong?

357
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:41,860
You know, you just get, you wake

358
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:44,319
up, it's maybe eight, 8 a.m., 8.30

359
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:44,899
a.m.

360
00:07:45,029 --> 00:07:46,120
You're logged on to Slack

361
00:07:46,129 --> 00:07:47,540
and you have fulfillment to do

362
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:48,709
from the night before.

363
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:50,029
Then all of a sudden the team

364
00:07:50,029 --> 00:07:50,939
members asking for

365
00:07:50,949 --> 00:07:51,670
your attention.

366
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:52,569
You know, you have to do

367
00:07:52,579 --> 00:07:53,889
check-ins, inbox management.

368
00:07:53,889 --> 00:07:55,100
You're checking your DMs.

369
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:55,220
You're

370
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:55,980
checking your socials.

371
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:56,939
You might be checking out how this

372
00:07:56,939 --> 00:07:57,779
content's performing.

373
00:07:57,779 --> 00:07:59,500
You know, you need to

374
00:07:59,529 --> 00:08:01,040
kind of do all of that first and

375
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:02,649
foremost, and then you just can

376
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:04,300
get sucked into doing so many

377
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:05,079
different things.

378
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:06,360
And then, you know, you're trying

379
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,639
to make it this YouTube script,

380
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:08,199
and then you have

381
00:08:08,209 --> 00:08:09,529
to do this bit of fulfillment, and

382
00:08:09,529 --> 00:08:10,629
then Slack's going off, and

383
00:08:10,629 --> 00:08:11,689
clients are asking this.

384
00:08:11,689 --> 00:08:12,100
And it's

385
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:13,459
just, you know, you snap your

386
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:14,000
fingers.

387
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,790
It's been 6 p.m., you're tired,

388
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:17,829
you're burnt out, and, you know,

389
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:19,410
you need a rest because, you know,

390
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:20,370
you're only human.

391
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:21,839
You've been going for like 10

392
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:22,949
hours, 11 hours

393
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:24,480
already, and you're just like,

394
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:25,550
what have I done today?

395
00:08:25,709 --> 00:08:26,920
Like what's actually after

396
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,699
happening?

397
00:08:27,699 --> 00:08:28,240
Like what did

398
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:29,399
I do to really move the needle in

399
00:08:29,529 --> 00:08:30,019
the business?

400
00:08:30,019 --> 00:08:31,220
The truth is you didn't actually

401
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:31,699
do shit.

402
00:08:31,699 --> 00:08:33,220
You just worked.

403
00:08:34,309 --> 00:08:35,899
So this is what we're going to

404
00:08:35,899 --> 00:08:36,700
cover here.

405
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,480
And these things are, this, these

406
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,350
white noise days are

407
00:08:39,389 --> 00:08:40,740
actually really dangerous because

408
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:41,779
these can really seriously

409
00:08:41,779 --> 00:08:42,700
compound over time.

410
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,580
You may genuinely at

411
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:46,009
some point feel like I'm getting

412
00:08:46,009 --> 00:08:47,440
stuff done for my business, and

413
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,070
you're not.

414
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:48,860
And it's a really

415
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:50,679
dangerous game to play because you

416
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:51,820
get into that habit.

417
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,500
It can, you can have a white noise

418
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:53,769
day,

419
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:55,240
a white noise day can turn into a

420
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,779
white noise week, and then it can

421
00:08:56,779 --> 00:08:58,259
turn into a white noise month.

422
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:01,190
Like, genuinely ask yourself, how

423
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:03,429
many times has it been when you

424
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:06,000
did a BHA with your student

425
00:09:06,009 --> 00:09:07,330
success coach, and you're going

426
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:08,590
through all the action items that

427
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,559
you've done, and you've only

428
00:09:10,649 --> 00:09:12,720
gotten like 50, 60% of the stuff

429
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:13,159
done.

430
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:14,779
But you're kind of sitting there

431
00:09:14,779 --> 00:09:16,059
like, that was a really busy

432
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:16,850
month though.

433
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:17,860
Like I was flat out.

434
00:09:17,889 --> 00:09:19,320
And then you look at your stats

435
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,299
too, and you're like, everything's

436
00:09:21,309 --> 00:09:22,440
kind of the same.

437
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:24,419
Same amount of booked calls, same

438
00:09:24,539 --> 00:09:26,309
amount of deals closed, same

439
00:09:26,309 --> 00:09:26,980
amount of

440
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:28,129
revenue, or maybe you just

441
00:09:28,269 --> 00:09:29,570
slightly went up, but you also had

442
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:30,639
some churn in between.

443
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:31,419
So you kind of

444
00:09:31,429 --> 00:09:32,210
balanced out.

445
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:33,620
It wasn't like too much of a

446
00:09:33,669 --> 00:09:34,200
spike.

447
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,700
I hate to tell you, it's because

448
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,049
your day is kind of

449
00:09:38,129 --> 00:09:40,080
screwed up and your scheduling is

450
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,620
completely screwed up.

451
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:43,419
So we want to avoid these as much

452
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:43,879
as humanly

453
00:09:43,889 --> 00:09:44,580
possible.

454
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,470
So you want to do three to four 50

455
00:09:46,629 --> 00:09:47,419
minute blocks.

456
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,929
And you know, when the world

457
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,690
doesn't have a

458
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:50,509
chance to break your

459
00:09:51,009 --> 00:09:52,309
concentration, you don't also have

460
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:53,259
an excuse to do so.

461
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,730
Now, what should you do

462
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:57,990
during these 50 minute time blocks

463
00:09:58,009 --> 00:09:58,960
in your morning?

464
00:09:59,059 --> 00:10:00,840
Well, every single day without

465
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,240
fail, one of them

466
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,840
has to be lead generation.

467
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,639
You know, this is the time of the

468
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:07,360
day to scrape a new lead list for

469
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:07,529
a

470
00:10:07,549 --> 00:10:09,279
campaign, write a new cold email

471
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,830
sequence to test, set up a new

472
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:12,759
campaign and launch it, test your

473
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:12,840
own

474
00:10:12,909 --> 00:10:14,419
deliverability in your cold email

475
00:10:14,419 --> 00:10:16,279
setup, you know, do some Dream 100

476
00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:18,159
outreach, do some Dream 100 list

477
00:10:18,169 --> 00:10:18,799
building.

478
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:20,320
If it's past 9am, do some cold

479
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,919
calling, do some DM outreach, do

480
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:22,980
some script writing,

481
00:10:23,049 --> 00:10:24,309
personalized email outreach,

482
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:25,809
LinkedIn connections, social media

483
00:10:25,809 --> 00:10:27,799
engagement, making new ad

484
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:28,320
creatives

485
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:28,850
for you.

486
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:30,360
If you're doing any paid ads or

487
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,049
making and send any looms that you

488
00:10:32,049 --> 00:10:33,360
need to send to for any

489
00:10:33,409 --> 00:10:34,779
clients that you know, you may

490
00:10:34,779 --> 00:10:36,200
have promised a loom to maybe the

491
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,820
day before, which by the way, you

492
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:37,940
should

493
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:39,360
be doing as soon as possible.

494
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,769
I'm just giving you a note, but

495
00:10:40,769 --> 00:10:42,450
like just in case, and some people

496
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:42,980
apply

497
00:10:43,029 --> 00:10:44,759
to their personalized messaging

498
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:45,379
process.

499
00:10:45,379 --> 00:10:46,980
And then CRM reactivation.

500
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,019
This one is absolutely key.

501
00:10:49,029 --> 00:10:50,429
The amount of times I've spoken

502
00:10:50,429 --> 00:10:51,909
with students and be like, have

503
00:10:51,909 --> 00:10:53,580
you, what's up with your CRM?

504
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:53,580
And

505
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:55,090
they're like, oh, it's like six,

506
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:56,289
seven interested prospects from

507
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:57,200
the entire year.

508
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:57,899
Like we're in

509
00:10:57,909 --> 00:10:59,370
October right now, pushing

510
00:10:59,370 --> 00:10:59,990
November.

511
00:11:00,029 --> 00:11:01,659
And it's like, okay, so you have

512
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:03,200
basically a year of a CRM of

513
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:04,659
prospects that responded

514
00:11:04,659 --> 00:11:06,620
positively to either your cold DM,

515
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:08,379
your D you know, your cold DM,

516
00:11:08,389 --> 00:11:09,850
your cold email, or maybe a cold

517
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:10,230
call.

518
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:11,740
And just they slipped through the

519
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:12,940
cracks and follow up with

520
00:11:13,009 --> 00:11:13,379
them.

521
00:11:13,379 --> 00:11:14,519
So follow up with them.

522
00:11:14,529 --> 00:11:16,049
Now you have now an hour, you have

523
00:11:16,049 --> 00:11:17,419
50 minutes to just start

524
00:11:17,429 --> 00:11:19,029
chat ramming messages.

525
00:11:19,029 --> 00:11:19,860
Just do it.

526
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,669
Next is going to be content.

527
00:11:21,669 --> 00:11:23,429
This is the perfect time to,

528
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:23,789
again,

529
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:25,340
record a YouTube video, script a

530
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:26,960
YouTube video, make some reels for

531
00:11:27,059 --> 00:11:28,580
short form, write your newsletter,

532
00:11:28,789 --> 00:11:30,159
make a LinkedIn post for the week,

533
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:31,330
like using Hypefury and other

534
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:32,259
tools like that.

535
00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:33,340
Link, you know,

536
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:34,769
your Twitter posts for the entire

537
00:11:34,769 --> 00:11:35,120
week.

538
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,370
Again, just load them up into

539
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:37,039
Hypefury.

540
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:38,250
Write a sales

541
00:11:38,269 --> 00:11:39,769
assets, write a lead magnet, you

542
00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:41,289
know, update your landing page,

543
00:11:41,289 --> 00:11:42,769
which you should be doing every

544
00:11:42,789 --> 00:11:42,980
three

545
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:44,330
to six months, because you should

546
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:45,549
be having new case studies that

547
00:11:45,549 --> 00:11:46,440
need to be uploaded.

548
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:46,980
There may be

549
00:11:47,009 --> 00:11:48,210
new adjustments that the offering

550
00:11:48,289 --> 00:11:49,450
or the messaging that we need to

551
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:49,759
test.

552
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:50,879
And, you know, we need to

553
00:11:50,889 --> 00:11:51,399
adjust.

554
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:52,850
This should be happening very

555
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:54,309
frequently, and especially

556
00:11:54,309 --> 00:11:56,179
rewriting and re-recording your

557
00:11:56,259 --> 00:11:56,690
VSL,

558
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:58,570
which also should be done every

559
00:11:58,570 --> 00:11:59,820
three to six months.

560
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,759
It's kind of insane that some of

561
00:12:01,779 --> 00:12:02,190
you are

562
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:03,529
not doing this on a consistent

563
00:12:03,529 --> 00:12:03,950
basis.

564
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,269
It kind of drives me insane.

565
00:12:05,269 --> 00:12:06,759
It's like testing the same email

566
00:12:06,889 --> 00:12:08,200
copy for an entire year.

567
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,000
You're going to find some winners,

568
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,159
winning aspects of it.

569
00:12:11,269 --> 00:12:12,179
You're going to find

570
00:12:12,269 --> 00:12:13,639
some losing aspects of it.

571
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:15,250
Do some market research on this as

572
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:15,649
well.

573
00:12:15,649 --> 00:12:17,360
And I'll explain to you actually

574
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:17,539
how

575
00:12:17,549 --> 00:12:18,330
to do that right now.

576
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,320
And that is going to be in the

577
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,490
most neglected phase, which is

578
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:21,460
your sales analysis.

579
00:12:21,909 --> 00:12:23,580
This is something I see absolutely

580
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:24,360
none of you do.

581
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:26,090
Some of you, you're like literally

582
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:26,730
in the five

583
00:12:26,789 --> 00:12:27,360
percent.

584
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,740
Like it's extremely rare.

585
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,320
And this is re-watching your sales

586
00:12:30,419 --> 00:12:31,830
calls and taking notes.

587
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:33,710
If you re-watch your sales calls

588
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:36,139
and you take notes, and then you

589
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:39,440
listen back to analyze and flesh

590
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:41,240
out your objections, be better

591
00:12:41,269 --> 00:12:42,009
prepared.

592
00:12:42,009 --> 00:12:43,970
You can apply those objections and

593
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:45,360
apply your most common

594
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:47,279
objections to your new VSL.

595
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:48,870
It is an absolute hack.

596
00:12:48,889 --> 00:12:50,409
This is why you should be

597
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,799
uploading it every so

598
00:12:51,809 --> 00:12:52,309
often.

599
00:12:52,309 --> 00:12:53,980
If there's an objection that you

600
00:12:54,049 --> 00:12:55,759
commonly faced on sales calls,

601
00:12:55,759 --> 00:12:57,519
pretty much 80% under your

602
00:12:57,529 --> 00:12:58,889
sales calls, you get this

603
00:12:58,889 --> 00:12:59,610
objection.

604
00:12:59,649 --> 00:13:01,269
You should put it to your VSL and

605
00:13:01,269 --> 00:13:02,980
basically upfront that objection

606
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,710
before they even get a chance to

607
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:05,570
book the call.

608
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:07,740
Your booking rate will increase.

609
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:10,190
So, and your qualified rate will

610
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:11,490
also increase.

611
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,870
So, doing these things as well.

612
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:15,220
Practice your three

613
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:15,690
pillars.

614
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:16,950
Something I don't see many of you

615
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:17,620
doing enough.

616
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:18,940
You need to have good tonality.

617
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:19,379
It needs

618
00:13:19,389 --> 00:13:19,970
to be natural.

619
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:20,759
It needs to be clean.

620
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:21,730
It needs to be efficient.

621
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:23,080
Another thing as well is like, you

622
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:23,179
know,

623
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:24,590
if someone's willing to get up

624
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:26,139
early with you as well, run a mock

625
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:26,529
call.

626
00:13:26,529 --> 00:13:28,200
A good time to actually sit down

627
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:29,470
for an hour and just flesh out and

628
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:30,779
go back to back and toe to toe.

629
00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:32,480
Another tip for when you're doing

630
00:13:32,509 --> 00:13:34,059
any sort of mock calls with people

631
00:13:34,059 --> 00:13:35,460
is practicing your frames.

632
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:37,059
Don't just sit there on a call and

633
00:13:37,059 --> 00:13:37,200
go

634
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:37,990
easy on each other.

635
00:13:38,149 --> 00:13:39,279
Say to someone, hey, can you run

636
00:13:39,299 --> 00:13:40,580
through the commodity frame with

637
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:40,740
me?

638
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,120
Hey,

639
00:13:41,129 --> 00:13:42,240
could you do the power frame with

640
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:42,440
me?

641
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,549
Hey, could you do the time frame

642
00:13:43,549 --> 00:13:43,870
for me?

643
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:45,120
Like, what frame do you

644
00:13:45,169 --> 00:13:46,779
commonly get in your ICP in your

645
00:13:46,779 --> 00:13:48,610
nation or the industry that you're

646
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:49,600
working with?

647
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,289
And practice that.

648
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,870
Let them practice theirs.

649
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:54,440
If someone doesn't know their

650
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:56,149
frames and they're doing mock

651
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:56,419
calls,

652
00:13:56,429 --> 00:13:57,909
they need to go back over the

653
00:13:57,909 --> 00:13:59,889
modules from David and the Kajabi.

654
00:13:59,889 --> 00:14:01,250
Just giving you an FYI.

655
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:01,519
You're

656
00:14:01,529 --> 00:14:03,409
probably wasting your time with

657
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:04,320
that person.

658
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,720
They're too early on.

659
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,379
So you need to know your frames

660
00:14:07,419 --> 00:14:07,649
when

661
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:09,169
you're doing mock calls.

662
00:14:09,169 --> 00:14:10,769
And learning your numbers.

663
00:14:10,769 --> 00:14:12,509
I've seen you many times on sales

664
00:14:12,509 --> 00:14:13,559
calls not actually

665
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:15,379
know your numbers off by heart.

666
00:14:15,379 --> 00:14:17,120
You need to know your numbers.

667
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,799
You need to know the numbers of

668
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:18,870
your

669
00:14:18,909 --> 00:14:20,019
case studies when you're on a

670
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:20,590
sales call.

671
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:21,809
That is called drip feeding the

672
00:14:21,809 --> 00:14:22,559
information.

673
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:23,340
You just need to

674
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:25,080
just be able to throw it out there

675
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,440
in a moment's notice.

676
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,740
There's nothing more awkward when

677
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:28,440
someone asks

678
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:30,019
you a metric or a number of one of

679
00:14:30,019 --> 00:14:31,740
your clients and you have to go,

680
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:34,450
let me think about that.

681
00:14:34,539 --> 00:14:36,899
And so just learn your

682
00:14:36,929 --> 00:14:37,279
numbers.

683
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,240
Again, analyze your objections,

684
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:41,179
incorporate into your new VSL, key

685
00:14:41,179 --> 00:14:42,360
for conversions.

686
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,639
So listen to other

687
00:14:44,669 --> 00:14:46,309
people's sales calls and take

688
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:46,830
notes.

689
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,659
Again, listen to someone else's

690
00:14:48,779 --> 00:14:49,490
sales call.

691
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:51,399
I cannot stress this enough.

692
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:52,419
There are many of them in the

693
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:53,539
Kajabi that you can watch and

694
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:54,039
analyze.

695
00:14:54,039 --> 00:14:55,440
So please do so.

696
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,269
And here's the next one is

697
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:57,570
learning.

698
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:59,850
I would say on average, most of

699
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:02,139
you get through about on average

700
00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:04,730
30% of Kajabi, which is just

701
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:05,519
baffling.

702
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,330
Like there are so many videos that

703
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:09,019
answer so many of your standard

704
00:15:09,019 --> 00:15:10,559
questions on a day-to-day basis

705
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:11,850
where you could really, in theory,

706
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:12,960
like take that information and

707
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,240
just apply it to your business.

708
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:14,559
Now,

709
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:16,190
and this is, I often hear from

710
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:18,019
students, like I just can't find

711
00:15:18,019 --> 00:15:20,019
the time to get through Kajabi.

712
00:15:20,029 --> 00:15:21,200
You know, you get through the

713
00:15:21,309 --> 00:15:22,559
sales section and that's it.

714
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:25,539
You drop it like a bag of bricks,

715
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:26,620
like it's just gone then.

716
00:15:28,649 --> 00:15:30,000
But you really need to go back and

717
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,179
rewatch these modules.

718
00:15:31,179 --> 00:15:32,769
There's a lot of in-depth

719
00:15:32,769 --> 00:15:34,620
knowledge here and something that

720
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,399
when you're at 5K may not have

721
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:37,259
made sense.

722
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:38,460
But now you're at 15K and it's

723
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:39,629
like, oh, now this is starting to

724
00:15:39,629 --> 00:15:40,200
make sense.

725
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,899
Now this is starting to click into

726
00:15:42,029 --> 00:15:43,350
place, especially things like

727
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,049
Daniel's offer videos, especially

728
00:15:45,049 --> 00:15:46,220
Daniel's offer videos.

729
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:47,649
This is now going to make sense

730
00:15:47,649 --> 00:15:49,179
when you're at a different, you

731
00:15:49,179 --> 00:15:50,769
know, a different, you're just

732
00:15:50,769 --> 00:15:52,779
more sophisticated business owner.

733
00:15:52,789 --> 00:15:54,039
You're more experienced now.

734
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:55,370
You've more clients, you've more

735
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:57,000
MRR, you've team members probably.

736
00:15:57,129 --> 00:15:58,190
And it's just going to make a lot

737
00:15:58,190 --> 00:15:59,289
more sense of the tips and tricks

738
00:15:59,309 --> 00:16:00,460
that he's going to tell you.

739
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:01,600
So you probably need to rewatch

740
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:02,480
them every so often.

741
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,919
I know for a fact that all the

742
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:05,570
SSEs do once every so often.

743
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:06,809
And the biggest tip for when

744
00:16:06,889 --> 00:16:08,320
you're watching the content is to

745
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:10,429
watch the video at 1.5, 2x speed

746
00:16:10,509 --> 00:16:12,340
and watch it in a 15 minute

747
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:13,059
sprint.

748
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:14,690
Like just super concentrated, just

749
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:15,149
lock in.

750
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:16,190
Like it's the last thing you were

751
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,230
ever going to, like it's the last

752
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:18,230
time you'll ever be able to watch

753
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:18,580
it.

754
00:16:18,669 --> 00:16:20,009
Like it's the last thing you will

755
00:16:20,009 --> 00:16:21,159
ever be able to watch in your

756
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:21,519
life.

757
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:22,559
Just watch it like your life

758
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:23,230
depends on it.

759
00:16:23,269 --> 00:16:24,570
And as soon as you hear strategy,

760
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:25,830
a theory or something you can put

761
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:27,259
into practice for your business,

762
00:16:27,379 --> 00:16:28,299
pause the video.

763
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:30,250
And instead of like writing down

764
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,070
notes or typing out notes, use

765
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:33,059
otter.io.

766
00:16:33,059 --> 00:16:34,899
It's a real time voice to text

767
00:16:34,899 --> 00:16:35,409
app.

768
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:36,519
It's a really, really good one.

769
00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:38,460
You get 303 minutes, so you don't

770
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:39,889
have to go on any payment plans

771
00:16:39,889 --> 00:16:41,000
and stuff like that.

772
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:43,269
Just press record and voice the

773
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:44,559
actual notes.

774
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:46,059
Force yourself to contextualize

775
00:16:46,059 --> 00:16:47,460
the information and how you're

776
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:48,509
going to apply it to your

777
00:16:48,509 --> 00:16:49,120
business.

778
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:50,809
You're now no longer just mentally

779
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:52,230
copying and pasting notes that

780
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,779
realistically you're not going to

781
00:16:53,909 --> 00:16:55,230
look back on or really understand

782
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,220
in like a month's time.

783
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:57,529
But when you force yourself to

784
00:16:57,529 --> 00:16:59,159
contextualize it, you're actually

785
00:16:59,159 --> 00:17:00,470
forcing yourself to learn and

786
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:02,009
absorb this information and apply

787
00:17:02,009 --> 00:17:02,350
it.

788
00:17:02,409 --> 00:17:03,789
And when you look back at these

789
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:05,359
notes, these notes are actually

790
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:06,680
going to have a lot more effect

791
00:17:06,789 --> 00:17:07,309
for you.

792
00:17:07,369 --> 00:17:08,598
You're going to look at it and go,

793
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:09,900
oh, yeah, that's when Daniel was

794
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,059
talking about lead generation

795
00:17:11,059 --> 00:17:11,920
versus lead capture.

796
00:17:12,049 --> 00:17:13,460
This is how I applied it to my

797
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:14,210
offering.

798
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:15,578
This is how I applied it to this

799
00:17:15,578 --> 00:17:15,940
ICP.

800
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:17,150
I noticed one ICP was a demand

801
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:18,529
capture, but I actually noticed

802
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:19,848
this ICP that I'm targeting is

803
00:17:19,848 --> 00:17:20,769
lead generation.

804
00:17:20,828 --> 00:17:21,609
So I need to come up with a

805
00:17:21,799 --> 00:17:22,789
different content strategy or a

806
00:17:22,789 --> 00:17:24,039
different targeting strategy or a

807
00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:25,240
different email sequence.

808
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:26,380
You see where I'm coming from

809
00:17:26,529 --> 00:17:26,769
here.

810
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:27,809
We need to contextualize the

811
00:17:27,809 --> 00:17:28,390
information.

812
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:29,690
Otherwise, we're just going to sit

813
00:17:29,769 --> 00:17:30,940
around here and go in circles.

814
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:35,009
So watch the video, pause it.

815
00:17:35,029 --> 00:17:36,079
When you hear something useful to

816
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:37,190
your business, record it and apply

817
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:38,529
the information to your business.

818
00:17:38,549 --> 00:17:39,960
Very, very straightforward.

819
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:41,130
And then you actually have long

820
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:42,160
detailed notes that you can

821
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:43,079
actually go back to.

822
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:44,500
Another time and area you can do

823
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,029
this, and sometimes depending on

824
00:17:46,029 --> 00:17:47,500
the scale of your business, of

825
00:17:47,509 --> 00:17:48,640
course, you may look into doing

826
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:49,829
some operations or some admin

827
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:50,190
work.

828
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:52,190
This is a time to go and build out

829
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:53,740
a Loom SOP tutorial.

830
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:55,150
This is maybe when you can clean

831
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:55,819
up your CRM.

832
00:17:55,829 --> 00:17:57,170
This is when you can just clean up

833
00:17:57,170 --> 00:17:57,839
your Slack.

834
00:17:57,849 --> 00:17:58,920
Maybe you've just a bunch of

835
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:00,220
messages all over the place.

836
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:02,559
Things are in threads, buried.

837
00:18:02,569 --> 00:18:04,450
Channels have a bunch of pin shit

838
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:05,990
that don't need to be there

839
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:06,759
anymore.

840
00:18:06,769 --> 00:18:08,569
There might be one or two channels

841
00:18:08,589 --> 00:18:10,059
that aren't necessary.

842
00:18:10,609 --> 00:18:11,640
You know, you need to deactivate

843
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,349
certain members.

844
00:18:12,369 --> 00:18:13,619
Like, this is the time to go

845
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:14,720
through all of this.

846
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:16,349
You know, and audit all of your

847
00:18:16,349 --> 00:18:18,230
staff's end-of-day type forms.

848
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:19,349
Audit their work.

849
00:18:19,529 --> 00:18:20,700
Look at the stuff that they're

850
00:18:20,809 --> 00:18:21,359
working on.

851
00:18:21,369 --> 00:18:22,819
Make sure all the Google Drives

852
00:18:22,819 --> 00:18:24,329
are in order or whatever that you

853
00:18:24,329 --> 00:18:24,710
use.

854
00:18:24,789 --> 00:18:26,210
Like, just make sure that your

855
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:27,690
house is tidy in the back end here

856
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:29,009
because it can get messy very

857
00:18:29,009 --> 00:18:30,299
quickly, especially if you're

858
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,410
using something like Notion.

859
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:32,789
Like, clean up your Notion

860
00:18:32,789 --> 00:18:34,259
documents, especially.

861
00:18:34,269 --> 00:18:36,460
Map out your fulfillment timeline,

862
00:18:36,509 --> 00:18:37,269
you know.

863
00:18:37,289 --> 00:18:38,619
Start using, like, a Miro board

864
00:18:38,619 --> 00:18:39,869
and build out your entire process

865
00:18:40,029 --> 00:18:41,279
like a company brain of, like,

866
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,369
right, from the moment of

867
00:18:42,369 --> 00:18:43,400
onboarding to the moment of

868
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:44,349
fulfillment.

869
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:46,680
Like, break out every single step

870
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,089
in between of, like, what's

871
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:49,849
happening in the business and who

872
00:18:49,869 --> 00:18:51,559
the work is being allocated to and

873
00:18:51,559 --> 00:18:53,190
what department and what team or

874
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:54,569
what do you do and what do you

875
00:18:54,569 --> 00:18:55,220
cover?

876
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:56,589
And then you can send that to your

877
00:18:56,589 --> 00:18:57,829
team and you can just pin that to

878
00:18:57,990 --> 00:18:59,390
your channel and say, like, hey,

879
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:00,730
this is your entire process just

880
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,190
so everyone knows how this machine

881
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:02,619
works.

882
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:03,990
And you trust me, your operations

883
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:05,420
will massively increase from doing

884
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:05,750
that.

885
00:19:05,809 --> 00:19:07,400
You know, audit your onboarding

886
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,279
process and your onboarding calls.

887
00:19:09,289 --> 00:19:10,640
This is absolutely crucial.

888
00:19:11,029 --> 00:19:12,099
Someone's after paying you a

889
00:19:12,309 --> 00:19:13,420
couple of thousand dollars to sign

890
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:14,559
on to your service and if you have

891
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:15,839
a shitty onboarding process or a

892
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:17,339
shitty onboarding call, you're

893
00:19:17,339 --> 00:19:18,589
never going to, that's the

894
00:19:18,589 --> 00:19:20,009
greatest way to create buyer's

895
00:19:20,009 --> 00:19:20,599
regret.

896
00:19:20,609 --> 00:19:22,130
Every one of you that came to

897
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:24,140
client ascension, you can see that

898
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,710
all of us as the SSEs have done

899
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:27,750
onboarding many, many, many, many

900
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:29,349
times and we practice that

901
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:30,390
thoroughly.

902
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:32,170
So, one, we can build a pretty

903
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:33,960
nice relationship with you.

904
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:34,750
You can trust us.

905
00:19:34,829 --> 00:19:36,029
You get the right information.

906
00:19:36,069 --> 00:19:37,569
But really, you feel like, hey, I

907
00:19:37,569 --> 00:19:38,960
can message you if I need you.

908
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:40,380
That's really the goal of this.

909
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:42,190
You know, you need to feel like,

910
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:43,319
yeah, I'm in good hands.

911
00:19:43,329 --> 00:19:45,910
So, update your agency's contract.

912
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:46,660
This is massive.

913
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:47,839
I've seen many of you do this

914
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:48,359
before.

915
00:19:48,369 --> 00:19:49,809
The amount of times as well where,

916
00:19:49,809 --> 00:19:50,950
you know, you said, oh, this

917
00:19:51,109 --> 00:19:52,559
client is causing this problem and

918
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:53,880
it's not the contract and causing

919
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:54,369
this.

920
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:55,930
And then I would say to you, cool,

921
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:57,200
add this stipulation to your

922
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,640
contract for future cases so you

923
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,180
don't run into this problem.

924
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:01,859
And it falls through the cracks.

925
00:20:01,869 --> 00:20:03,259
And I asked you, did you update

926
00:20:03,259 --> 00:20:04,119
your contract?

927
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:05,420
And you go, no.

928
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:06,819
And I go, why?

929
00:20:06,829 --> 00:20:08,559
You ran into this problem before.

930
00:20:08,569 --> 00:20:09,470
You think you're not going to run

931
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:10,019
into it again.

932
00:20:10,829 --> 00:20:12,349
This is the time to do it.

933
00:20:12,369 --> 00:20:13,150
If you find a gap in your

934
00:20:13,339 --> 00:20:14,430
contract, this is a good time to

935
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:15,779
sit down and just hash it out.

936
00:20:15,789 --> 00:20:17,950
Building out your next higher

937
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,059
scorecard.

938
00:20:19,069 --> 00:20:21,339
You know, again, my report.

939
00:20:21,349 --> 00:20:23,430
And building out a project plan.

940
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:24,250
Or just build out an automation

941
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:25,880
that you need to build out.

942
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:27,329
Anything that simple as, like,

943
00:20:27,329 --> 00:20:28,789
from your smart lead to your Slack

944
00:20:28,789 --> 00:20:30,160
to say, hey, you got a positive

945
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,039
notification.

946
00:20:31,049 --> 00:20:32,359
You got a positive reply.

947
00:20:32,369 --> 00:20:33,569
Whatever it may be.

948
00:20:33,609 --> 00:20:34,920
You need to be doing stuff like

949
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,339
this.

950
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:36,180
Now, listen.

951
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:38,130
I know this list of stuff here is

952
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:39,039
a lot to do.

953
00:20:39,049 --> 00:20:40,180
Like, it is a lot.

954
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:40,759
You know.

955
00:20:40,769 --> 00:20:42,059
And I'm not going to sit here and

956
00:20:42,059 --> 00:20:42,940
pretend it isn't.

957
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:45,299
And the operations stuff,

958
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:46,789
realistically, as well, depending

959
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:47,920
on where you're at with your

960
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,460
business, you could do that during

961
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:50,119
the day, too.

962
00:20:50,509 --> 00:20:51,710
It's mainly for the first three

963
00:20:51,789 --> 00:20:52,910
things that you need to kind of

964
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:54,039
really focus on the most.

965
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:56,910
But, again, completely depends on

966
00:20:56,910 --> 00:20:58,680
where you're at with your

967
00:20:58,809 --> 00:20:59,839
business.

968
00:20:59,849 --> 00:21:01,200
You need to just kind of put your

969
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,430
head on a little bit here and try

970
00:21:02,589 --> 00:21:03,990
and map this out and apply this to

971
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:05,359
your business and where you're

972
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:06,220
currently at.

973
00:21:06,509 --> 00:21:07,750
But everyone in different MRR

974
00:21:07,789 --> 00:21:09,049
rates is going to be a little bit

975
00:21:09,049 --> 00:21:09,640
different.

976
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:11,230
Like, realistically, if you're a

977
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:12,789
little under 5K, you have time to

978
00:21:12,789 --> 00:21:14,210
do tons of this stuff throughout

979
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:14,789
the day.

980
00:21:14,829 --> 00:21:15,609
And you should be.

981
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:16,819
But if you're busy, you have,

982
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:18,509
like, 12 clients, you have, like,

983
00:21:18,509 --> 00:21:19,869
three team members, you have team

984
00:21:19,869 --> 00:21:21,259
calls, you have sales calls coming

985
00:21:21,259 --> 00:21:22,359
in, you have a bunch of other

986
00:21:22,359 --> 00:21:23,099
stuff to do.

987
00:21:23,769 --> 00:21:24,710
Like, this is where you need to

988
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:25,660
really apply, you know, your

989
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:26,339
thinking brain.

990
00:21:26,349 --> 00:21:28,930
But by doing this, even if you

991
00:21:29,089 --> 00:21:31,559
commit only three tasks every

992
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:34,730
morning, you've done 15 hours of

993
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:37,890
deep work for the business a week,

994
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:39,789
which I don't think anyone is

995
00:21:39,789 --> 00:21:41,619
realistically able to do.

996
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:43,500
I really don't think so.

997
00:21:43,509 --> 00:21:45,299
So if you can do this, you now

998
00:21:45,329 --> 00:21:47,400
have to, you've now gotten some

999
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,470
really high leverage tasks done

1000
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:50,400
every day.

1001
00:21:52,289 --> 00:21:54,049
So you build sales assets, you did

1002
00:21:54,049 --> 00:21:56,279
some Dream 100 outreach, you know,

1003
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,990
you cleaned up your CRM, like,

1004
00:21:57,990 --> 00:21:58,859
brilliant.

1005
00:21:58,869 --> 00:22:00,349
Most of you aren't able to get

1006
00:22:00,349 --> 00:22:01,450
that done in a day.

1007
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:02,579
And if you can do four hours,

1008
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,960
you're getting 20 hours done a

1009
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:04,400
week.

1010
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:06,440
That is absolutely massive.

1011
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:07,849
And you've done it all before,

1012
00:22:07,849 --> 00:22:09,490
like, really the day even begins,

1013
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:11,200
and you can really be unbothered.

1014
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:13,359
So, listen, while Rome wasn't

1015
00:22:13,359 --> 00:22:15,599
built in a day, you know, you may

1016
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:17,660
see an immediate ROI from doing

1017
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:18,269
this.

1018
00:22:18,289 --> 00:22:19,869
You may see nothing for about a

1019
00:22:19,869 --> 00:22:20,700
month or so.

1020
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:22,099
But that's fine.

1021
00:22:22,109 --> 00:22:23,259
It's just completely dependent on

1022
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:24,259
the business and where you're

1023
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:24,880
currently at.

1024
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:27,470
But by doing this, after 10 a.m.,

1025
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:29,440
you're free to put out any fires

1026
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,180
you need to do, take any team

1027
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:32,470
meetings you need to do, take any

1028
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:34,940
sales calls, do any client calls,

1029
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:36,349
new hire interviews, work on

1030
00:22:36,349 --> 00:22:37,099
fulfillment.

1031
00:22:38,109 --> 00:22:39,779
Go to a coaching call in the

1032
00:22:39,779 --> 00:22:41,779
evening time that you need to go

1033
00:22:41,779 --> 00:22:43,839
to if you need to talk to, like,

1034
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:45,809
Nick or David or Connor or Mario

1035
00:22:45,809 --> 00:22:46,720
or Andre.

1036
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:48,470
Like, now you actually have that

1037
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:49,829
time in your day to go and do

1038
00:22:49,829 --> 00:22:51,529
those things because you pretty

1039
00:22:51,529 --> 00:22:53,289
much have the day covered because

1040
00:22:53,289 --> 00:22:54,490
you've got every high leverage

1041
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:56,920
task for the business done here.

1042
00:22:57,670 --> 00:22:59,109
And you can call it a day at 5

1043
00:22:59,109 --> 00:22:59,680
p.m.

1044
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,420
or 6 p.m.

1045
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,339
or 5.30 p.m.

1046
00:23:01,349 --> 00:23:03,000
Whatever you need, like, depending

1047
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:03,930
on your business.

1048
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:05,720
But most of you can actually call

1049
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,009
it a day at 5 p.m.

1050
00:23:07,029 --> 00:23:08,549
You can generally, like, close

1051
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:10,140
your computer at 5 o'clock and go

1052
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:11,460
about your day and enjoy your

1053
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:11,930
life.

1054
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:14,990
And I mean, yeah, no one's really

1055
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:16,950
had an emergency at 9 o'clock in

1056
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:17,869
the morning.

1057
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:19,480
Completely depends on the agency.

1058
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:20,930
But, like, you know, have an SOP

1059
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:22,029
in place that if there is an

1060
00:23:22,029 --> 00:23:23,630
emergency at 9 a.m., tell your

1061
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:24,460
team to call you.

1062
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:25,240
Just huddle you.

1063
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:26,579
You know, like, you'll know.

1064
00:23:26,589 --> 00:23:28,130
Like, it rarely happens, but you

1065
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:28,549
know.

1066
00:23:28,569 --> 00:23:29,920
Not to mention, what fire is

1067
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,410
really coming out that can't be

1068
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,059
fixed within the hour anyway.

1069
00:23:33,069 --> 00:23:35,519
So, manage to do the inverter by

1070
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:37,339
blocking your time.

1071
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:38,839
If you block your time, like, your

1072
00:23:38,839 --> 00:23:40,299
four-hour block in the morning and

1073
00:23:40,299 --> 00:23:41,759
get your high leverage task done,

1074
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:42,390
perfect.

1075
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:44,309
I personally like the first hour

1076
00:23:44,309 --> 00:23:45,859
after that is, again, to just kind

1077
00:23:45,859 --> 00:23:47,180
of check house a little bit.

1078
00:23:47,269 --> 00:23:48,319
Check your email box.

1079
00:23:48,329 --> 00:23:49,920
Check your DMs.

1080
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:50,880
Check your content.

1081
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:52,220
Check in on Slack.

1082
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:53,319
See what's going on.

1083
00:23:53,329 --> 00:23:54,380
Announce yourself to your team.

1084
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:55,460
Let people know that you're here.

1085
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:55,980
You're present.

1086
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:56,769
You're ready to work.

1087
00:23:56,829 --> 00:23:58,900
And, again, you're not going to do

1088
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,940
this every day.

1089
00:24:00,009 --> 00:24:01,559
But, like, stack your team calls

1090
00:24:01,559 --> 00:24:03,069
together back to back to back.

1091
00:24:03,089 --> 00:24:04,289
Like, literally get really

1092
00:24:04,369 --> 00:24:05,670
disciplined in giving people just

1093
00:24:05,829 --> 00:24:07,220
30 minutes of their time.

1094
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:08,009
And you should be constructing

1095
00:24:08,119 --> 00:24:08,660
your time.

1096
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:09,450
And if you have any problems

1097
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:11,059
about, like, if your team calls

1098
00:24:11,059 --> 00:24:12,579
are going a little over or, again,

1099
00:24:12,589 --> 00:24:14,160
they seem really unnecessary, talk

1100
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,460
to, you can feel free to talk to

1101
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:16,329
myself or Andre.

1102
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:17,700
And we'll show you how this kind

1103
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:18,990
of, like, how we construct our

1104
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:19,519
calls.

1105
00:24:19,589 --> 00:24:22,539
And then blocking your sales calls

1106
00:24:22,539 --> 00:24:23,480
as well.

1107
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:24,950
And then on top of that, one thing

1108
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:26,309
that people really need to do is

1109
00:24:26,309 --> 00:24:28,180
that if you have any outside work

1110
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:28,660
tasks,

1111
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:30,220
like if you know Monday I have to

1112
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:31,710
go get my hair cut, Tuesday I have

1113
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:32,359
to go to the bank,

1114
00:24:32,369 --> 00:24:33,150
Wednesday I have to go grocery

1115
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:33,839
shopping,

1116
00:24:34,509 --> 00:24:35,700
Thursday I have to go and drop

1117
00:24:35,789 --> 00:24:37,049
this thing back into my friend or

1118
00:24:37,049 --> 00:24:38,500
whatever, like that, don't do

1119
00:24:38,619 --> 00:24:39,059
that.

1120
00:24:39,069 --> 00:24:40,569
Just stack it all into one day and

1121
00:24:40,569 --> 00:24:42,180
just do everything in a three-hour

1122
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:42,599
gap.

1123
00:24:42,609 --> 00:24:44,210
Go get your hair cut, go to the

1124
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:45,190
bank, go get your grocery

1125
00:24:45,349 --> 00:24:45,730
shopping,

1126
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:47,220
and then pop into whoever you need

1127
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:48,329
to see or do or whatever at the

1128
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:49,250
end of the day.

1129
00:24:49,269 --> 00:24:51,180
Just block it all off and get it

1130
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:52,960
done in one fail sweep and just

1131
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:53,819
get it done and finish in the

1132
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:54,170
week.

1133
00:24:55,089 --> 00:24:57,039
All right, ideally after 3.30, 4

1134
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:57,440
p.m.

1135
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,079
if you can.

1136
00:24:58,089 --> 00:24:59,279
But, like, if it has to be sooner,

1137
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:00,019
it has to be sooner.

1138
00:25:00,029 --> 00:25:01,099
It depends completely on how you

1139
00:25:01,309 --> 00:25:02,059
organize your business.

1140
00:25:02,069 --> 00:25:03,710
So most of you fall into

1141
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:06,319
exhaustion because, again, it's

1142
00:25:06,319 --> 00:25:08,069
just a cocktail of all this

1143
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:08,779
madness.

1144
00:25:08,789 --> 00:25:10,410
And your day is just, you're being

1145
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:12,079
pulled in too many directions.

1146
00:25:12,089 --> 00:25:15,829
I think anyone would love to see

1147
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:19,809
this be their day if they could.

1148
00:25:20,089 --> 00:25:21,559
If you can have an ideal business

1149
00:25:21,559 --> 00:25:23,329
day, this would be something most

1150
00:25:23,329 --> 00:25:24,650
of you would love to see.

1151
00:25:25,319 --> 00:25:26,460
You're getting YouTube scripting

1152
00:25:26,609 --> 00:25:28,759
done, Dream 100 Outreach, watching

1153
00:25:28,759 --> 00:25:30,599
a module that you needed to watch,

1154
00:25:30,609 --> 00:25:31,700
write a sales assets, do some

1155
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:33,440
check-ins, and then straight into

1156
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,000
just doing some back-to-back sales

1157
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:35,509
calls.

1158
00:25:35,529 --> 00:25:36,779
Have an hour gap in between to

1159
00:25:36,809 --> 00:25:38,299
check on anything, do some sort of

1160
00:25:38,299 --> 00:25:39,059
fulfillment,

1161
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:40,200
cover whatever you need to do,

1162
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:41,319
maybe take a break, whatever it

1163
00:25:41,369 --> 00:25:41,599
is.

1164
00:25:41,609 --> 00:25:43,230
Do some back-to-back team calls,

1165
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:44,589
and then go back on about your

1166
00:25:44,589 --> 00:25:45,000
day.

1167
00:25:45,009 --> 00:25:46,609
Most of you would love to have a

1168
00:25:46,609 --> 00:25:47,539
day like this.

1169
00:25:47,549 --> 00:25:49,430
That is an extremely productive

1170
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:51,299
day, and you log off today at 5

1171
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:51,819
p.m.

1172
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:53,240
That's gold.

1173
00:25:53,849 --> 00:25:55,619
This is just an example, but, you

1174
00:25:55,619 --> 00:25:57,339
know, most of us would love to see

1175
00:25:57,339 --> 00:25:57,839
that.

1176
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:59,410
And you can have those days if you

1177
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:00,789
just take this and apply it to

1178
00:26:00,789 --> 00:26:02,279
your business, you know.

1179
00:26:02,289 --> 00:26:04,000
So, here's another thing.

1180
00:26:04,009 --> 00:26:04,789
But what happens if I can't wake

1181
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:05,039
up?

1182
00:26:05,049 --> 00:26:06,440
What happens if you're just like a

1183
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,960
really shitty sleeper like myself,

1184
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:10,029
and getting up in the morning

1185
00:26:10,029 --> 00:26:12,529
sounds absolutely horrendous,

1186
00:26:12,569 --> 00:26:14,609
and I'd rather, you know, pull

1187
00:26:14,609 --> 00:26:17,000
nails out of my eyes or something?

1188
00:26:17,009 --> 00:26:17,640
I don't know.

1189
00:26:18,029 --> 00:26:19,750
But I'd love to say, yeah, I just

1190
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:20,609
have to do it.

1191
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:22,069
In one sense, yes, you do just

1192
00:26:22,069 --> 00:26:22,789
have to do it.

1193
00:26:22,849 --> 00:26:23,799
It's just going to have to be a

1194
00:26:23,829 --> 00:26:24,339
necessity.

1195
00:26:24,349 --> 00:26:26,029
But if you have a genuinely shitty

1196
00:26:26,029 --> 00:26:27,759
sleeping schedule, and you wake up

1197
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:28,619
at 11 a.m.,

1198
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:30,190
and you're going to bed at like 2

1199
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:31,019
or 3 a.m.,

1200
00:26:31,029 --> 00:26:32,089
well, one, you need to kind of

1201
00:26:32,089 --> 00:26:33,190
pull that back a little bit.

1202
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:34,380
It's just not super healthy in the

1203
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:34,920
long term.

1204
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:36,990
But if that's your jam, that's

1205
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:37,839
your jam.

1206
00:26:37,849 --> 00:26:38,460
No judgment.

1207
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:39,730
You go off and do whatever you

1208
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:40,380
want to do.

1209
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:41,690
But this is just my personal

1210
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:43,690
preference here, opinion of, you

1211
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:43,880
know,

1212
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:44,900
what's the most productive way.

1213
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:46,309
So let's just say you usually wake

1214
00:26:46,309 --> 00:26:48,039
up at 10 a.m., start waking up at

1215
00:26:48,049 --> 00:26:48,339
9.

1216
00:26:48,349 --> 00:26:49,740
Just slowly go into it.

1217
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:51,089
Don't force yourself to just get

1218
00:26:51,089 --> 00:26:52,559
up at like 5.30 a.m.

1219
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:53,000
one morning.

1220
00:26:53,009 --> 00:26:53,710
You're just not going to be

1221
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:54,180
productive.

1222
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:55,390
It's going to shell shock the

1223
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:55,809
body.

1224
00:26:55,829 --> 00:26:57,990
Start slowly integrating it until

1225
00:26:58,069 --> 00:26:59,720
you can get to sleep at like

1226
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:02,279
waking up at like 8 a.m.,

1227
00:27:02,289 --> 00:27:03,660
you know, 7 a.m.

1228
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:05,069
Then when you start doing that,

1229
00:27:05,069 --> 00:27:06,660
start hitting your early hours.

1230
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:07,450
So like you probably want to wake

1231
00:27:07,539 --> 00:27:07,680
up.

1232
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:09,250
If you want to start work for 6,

1233
00:27:09,259 --> 00:27:11,049
you need to get up at about 5.30

1234
00:27:11,049 --> 00:27:11,490
a.m.

1235
00:27:11,589 --> 00:27:13,500
Go look at the sun, like Leary, go

1236
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,529
outside, sit there for like 15

1237
00:27:15,529 --> 00:27:16,380
minutes.

1238
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:17,480
Just go outside for five minutes.

1239
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:19,509
You know, at the start, go back to

1240
00:27:19,509 --> 00:27:20,279
bed then.

1241
00:27:20,289 --> 00:27:21,589
You know, wake up then at your 8

1242
00:27:21,589 --> 00:27:22,970
or 9 o'clock or 7 o'clock then at

1243
00:27:23,029 --> 00:27:23,680
that point,

1244
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:25,089
but just try and get kind of used

1245
00:27:25,089 --> 00:27:26,019
to it into a flow.

1246
00:27:26,029 --> 00:27:27,680
Get up for five minutes and stay

1247
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,359
outside.

1248
00:27:28,369 --> 00:27:29,309
Then the next day, get up at the

1249
00:27:29,309 --> 00:27:30,329
same thing, but stay outside for

1250
00:27:30,329 --> 00:27:30,950
10 minutes.

1251
00:27:31,009 --> 00:27:32,119
Then you can go back to bed.

1252
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:33,769
And then the third day, you know,

1253
00:27:33,779 --> 00:27:34,900
you're trying to push yourself to

1254
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:35,660
about 15 minutes.

1255
00:27:36,369 --> 00:27:37,680
Now you're starting to train your

1256
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,920
body a little bit to wake up.

1257
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:40,970
Associating like the sunrise or

1258
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:42,920
going outside, do all that.

1259
00:27:43,009 --> 00:27:43,980
And don't do any work for that

1260
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:44,599
half an hour.

1261
00:27:44,609 --> 00:27:45,579
Just take a chill pill for

1262
00:27:45,589 --> 00:27:46,180
yourself.

1263
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:47,299
Sit around, have a coffee.

1264
00:27:47,309 --> 00:27:49,039
Good time to actually journal and

1265
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:50,630
like map out what you want out of

1266
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:51,460
your real life

1267
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:52,869
and what are your goals and what

1268
00:27:52,869 --> 00:27:54,279
are you actually doing all this

1269
00:27:54,279 --> 00:27:54,539
for?

1270
00:27:54,549 --> 00:27:55,660
And start, you know, planning

1271
00:27:55,829 --> 00:27:56,809
like, all right, I'm currently

1272
00:27:56,809 --> 00:27:57,119
here.

1273
00:27:57,130 --> 00:27:58,319
I want to be here next year.

1274
00:27:58,329 --> 00:27:59,970
What are steps I need to do here?

1275
00:28:00,009 --> 00:28:01,420
It's a very good motivating time,

1276
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:03,150
but it's just nice to sit there on

1277
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:03,720
your own

1278
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:04,920
and just be with your thoughts for

1279
00:28:05,009 --> 00:28:06,309
half an hour just before you deep

1280
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:07,420
dive into your work.

1281
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:09,470
So that's how I'd personally

1282
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:11,170
recommend doing it.

1283
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:12,299
Again, the document goes into more

1284
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:13,240
detail, so you can read it over

1285
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:13,619
there.

1286
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:14,730
And then again, you need to stay

1287
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:15,960
accountable to this.

1288
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:17,759
And that is another factor that a

1289
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:19,220
lot of you need a lot of help

1290
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:19,559
with.

1291
00:28:19,569 --> 00:28:20,349
And accountability is a massive

1292
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:20,880
factor.

1293
00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:22,089
Accountability is just really

1294
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:22,819
disciplined.

1295
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:25,319
And really what I recommend is

1296
00:28:25,319 --> 00:28:27,119
Jeremy Newsom's tactic.

1297
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:28,289
I spoke to him about this just in

1298
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:28,700
Tampa.

1299
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:30,660
I asked him, like, how I can keep

1300
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:32,380
people more accountable.

1301
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:33,400
And he was like, challenge them.

1302
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:35,099
You made a really good point.

1303
00:28:35,109 --> 00:28:36,400
So challenge yourself, though,

1304
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,650
because that's the ultimate form

1305
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:38,420
of accountability

1306
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:39,460
is if you don't need to be told to

1307
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:40,529
do something, you just can do it

1308
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:41,000
yourself.

1309
00:28:41,009 --> 00:28:42,460
And it shows that you have

1310
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:43,380
discipline.

1311
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:45,119
So when Jeremy needed to hold

1312
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:46,890
himself accountable and he failed

1313
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:47,920
a task, he punished himself.

1314
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:49,480
He gave himself a pretty severe

1315
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,789
punishment so that he learned a

1316
00:28:50,789 --> 00:28:51,079
lesson.

1317
00:28:51,089 --> 00:28:52,640
He maintained what he was meant to

1318
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:52,960
do.

1319
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:54,710
And that meant donating money to

1320
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:56,009
the opposite political party,

1321
00:28:56,170 --> 00:28:57,420
going vegan for a month,

1322
00:28:57,529 --> 00:28:59,190
running until you puke, quitting

1323
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:01,059
alcohol for a month, a cold shower

1324
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,799
every morning before work.

1325
00:29:02,809 --> 00:29:04,880
Like, come up with something that

1326
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,930
you would genuinely hate to do and

1327
00:29:06,930 --> 00:29:07,500
do it.

1328
00:29:07,509 --> 00:29:09,220
And punish yourself from doing it.

1329
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:10,730
And commit to that punishment.

1330
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:12,750
You'll never make that mistake

1331
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:13,329
again.

1332
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:15,089
You just need to get an iron

1333
00:29:15,089 --> 00:29:16,529
mindset on things.

1334
00:29:16,549 --> 00:29:18,279
And that's the way to do it.

1335
00:29:18,289 --> 00:29:19,779
So you just actually, there needs

1336
00:29:19,779 --> 00:29:21,170
to be consequences for not being

1337
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:21,960
accountable.

1338
00:29:22,869 --> 00:29:25,450
I mean, you can ask your SSC to do

1339
00:29:25,609 --> 00:29:25,980
it.

1340
00:29:26,069 --> 00:29:27,099
But I mean, sure.

1341
00:29:27,109 --> 00:29:29,500
But like, what are we going to do?

1342
00:29:29,509 --> 00:29:30,289
Virtually slap you?

1343
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:31,000
I don't know.

1344
00:29:31,009 --> 00:29:31,619
Maybe.

1345
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:33,980
But you need to do something.

1346
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:34,769
So.

1347
00:29:34,789 --> 00:29:38,130
And here's some final notes.

1348
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:40,339
These are just some off-topic

1349
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:42,140
things that, you know, I've

1350
00:29:42,259 --> 00:29:44,099
accumulated from over the years.

1351
00:29:44,109 --> 00:29:45,000
And it's like, perfection's a

1352
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,039
silent killer of productivity.

1353
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:47,799
When it's good enough, launch it.

1354
00:29:47,809 --> 00:29:48,400
Move on.

1355
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:50,859
Don't let shiny object syndrome

1356
00:29:50,869 --> 00:29:52,680
kill your progress.

1357
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:54,250
You can only climb one mountain at

1358
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:54,730
a time.

1359
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:55,940
Don't let others deter you from

1360
00:29:56,029 --> 00:29:57,099
climbing your mountains.

1361
00:29:57,109 --> 00:29:58,420
Don't stop halfway through.

1362
00:29:58,430 --> 00:29:59,579
Just see it through to the end.

1363
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:01,940
If you're in the early stages of

1364
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:03,400
your agency, make looms.

1365
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:05,019
Videos of all your fulfillment.

1366
00:30:05,029 --> 00:30:06,220
Start building a catalog of

1367
00:30:06,309 --> 00:30:07,109
training videos.

1368
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:08,319
So that when you do make a hire,

1369
00:30:08,450 --> 00:30:09,539
you actually have a library of,

1370
00:30:09,539 --> 00:30:11,569
like, videos and trainings already

1371
00:30:11,569 --> 00:30:12,200
set to go.

1372
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:13,390
I'm going to call this now because

1373
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,289
it's 30 minutes.

1374
00:30:14,309 --> 00:30:15,400
You can read the rest of this.

1375
00:30:15,410 --> 00:30:16,799
The document is at the bottom.

1376
00:30:16,809 --> 00:30:18,299
Or you can, like, pause this video

1377
00:30:18,299 --> 00:30:19,660
and read some of these here.

1378
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:23,829
Yeah, go get to work.

1379
00:30:23,849 --> 00:30:24,630
Love you.

1380
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:25,059
Bye.
