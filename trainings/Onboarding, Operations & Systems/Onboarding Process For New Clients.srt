00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,080
Welcome back to another video.

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:05,480
It's Andre here and in this video,

3
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:07,559
basically where we're at currently

4
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:09,460
in the onboarding process is we

5
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:11,009
talked about the service

6
00:00:11,009 --> 00:00:11,960
agreement.

7
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:14,240
So when you have a client ready

8
00:00:14,279 --> 00:00:16,100
to sign up, you want to basically,

9
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:17,660
the first thing you want to get

10
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:19,120
them to do or the first thing you

11
00:00:19,339 --> 00:00:21,370
have to get them to do is review

12
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:23,980
and sign the service agreement and

13
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:25,839
you can use a tool called

14
00:00:26,059 --> 00:00:26,649
HelloSign.

15
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:28,160
There's also DocuSign.

16
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:30,030
There's also like PandaDoc.

17
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:31,829
There's a bunch of tools out there

18
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,240
where you can send PDF contracts

19
00:00:34,429 --> 00:00:37,210
like the service agreements, like

20
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:40,079
the one we are creating and

21
00:00:40,409 --> 00:00:41,939
editing in Canva and send it to

22
00:00:41,939 --> 00:00:43,780
someone's email and get them to

23
00:00:43,859 --> 00:00:46,240
sign it electronically, which is

24
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,969
still valid legally.

25
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:49,929
So look into those tools.

26
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:52,380
But basically by this point, you

27
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:53,619
already came up

28
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:54,939
with a service agreement and

29
00:00:54,939 --> 00:00:56,420
contract, got it signed by your

30
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:56,979
client.

31
00:00:56,979 --> 00:00:59,619
You also decided on how

32
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:01,039
you're going to set or how much

33
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:02,640
you're going to charge for a setup

34
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,180
fee or your onboarding fees

35
00:01:04,219 --> 00:01:05,099
so that you can invoice your

36
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:05,540
clients.

37
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:07,219
So basically right now, all that

38
00:01:07,219 --> 00:01:09,540
you've done is you got that

39
00:01:09,859 --> 00:01:11,519
signed service agreement from the

40
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:12,129
client.

41
00:01:12,129 --> 00:01:13,269
And then now you have to

42
00:01:13,719 --> 00:01:14,980
understand what are the next

43
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:15,129
steps.

44
00:01:15,269 --> 00:01:17,150
So you had the sales call, they

45
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:19,230
signed the service agreement.

46
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,219
What are the next steps?

47
00:01:21,489 --> 00:01:23,579
And what you're looking at here is

48
00:01:23,579 --> 00:01:25,370
a tool called Trello.

49
00:01:25,579 --> 00:01:26,680
This is what we use for our

50
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,159
agency.

51
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:27,390
It's

52
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:29,719
basically like another tool or

53
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:31,200
version of Notion.

54
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:33,400
It's just we prefer to use Trello

55
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:34,280
because we've used

56
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:36,450
it forever and it works for us.

57
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:38,409
So we actually don't use Notion at

58
00:01:38,459 --> 00:01:39,640
all at our agency.

59
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,599
We just use Trello.

60
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,810
And again, you could also use

61
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:43,400
ClickUp.

62
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,840
There's so many tools out there

63
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,629
for basically it's just project

64
00:01:47,049 --> 00:01:49,129
management or task management or

65
00:01:49,189 --> 00:01:50,140
task management, however you want

66
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:50,840
to call it.

67
00:01:50,859 --> 00:01:54,840
So we have a very set and standard

68
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:57,620
set of procedures in place for

69
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:59,799
what happens once we get a signed

70
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,760
contract.

71
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,120
So as soon as we get a signed

72
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:02,840
contract,

73
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:05,170
we go to this board here, which is

74
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:06,540
a template board.

75
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,979
So in Trello, it's really just a

76
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:09,479
template.

77
00:02:09,569 --> 00:02:11,360
And it's really nice because we

78
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,210
don't have to change anything to

79
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:14,840
this specific template.

80
00:02:14,889 --> 00:02:16,889
We can create a board that looks

81
00:02:16,889 --> 00:02:18,569
just like this from the actual

82
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:19,800
template.

83
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,400
So this is part of being

84
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:23,080
like a Trello pro member or

85
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,919
whatever, which we are.

86
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:27,879
And all I'll do in the top is hit

87
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:28,840
create board from

88
00:02:29,169 --> 00:02:29,479
template.

89
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:31,159
And then usually the way I name

90
00:02:31,349 --> 00:02:33,169
the board is I'll put the client's

91
00:02:33,169 --> 00:02:35,400
name and then X our business.

92
00:02:35,449 --> 00:02:37,000
So like X knowledge X and I'll

93
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,400
create the board.

94
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,979
And now I just created like a

95
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:42,360
workspace for our

96
00:02:42,689 --> 00:02:44,360
client and I'll walk you through

97
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,550
the entire workspace.

98
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:47,090
So you understand what each card

99
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:47,960
is there for.

100
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:49,860
And obviously this is tailored

101
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,759
specifically to knowledge X, my

102
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:53,939
lead generation agency and the

103
00:02:54,389 --> 00:02:56,349
services that we provide.

104
00:02:56,349 --> 00:02:58,580
So it won't look the same exact

105
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:00,840
for you because your business is

106
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,639
unique in

107
00:03:01,689 --> 00:03:03,400
in various ways, obviously.

108
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,000
But I'll walk you through

109
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,599
basically how to leverage a tool

110
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:07,479
like Trello or

111
00:03:07,689 --> 00:03:10,330
any other project management tool

112
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:12,449
to have a very rigid and set

113
00:03:12,569 --> 00:03:15,800
process in place to go through

114
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,280
next steps.

115
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:17,669
Because once someone signs a

116
00:03:17,669 --> 00:03:19,979
contract, you have a very short

117
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:23,159
window of time to make a really

118
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:23,479
good

119
00:03:23,569 --> 00:03:24,289
first impression.

120
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,680
That's like one of the most

121
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,180
important things in the agency

122
00:03:27,629 --> 00:03:27,629
base

123
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:30,879
or agency business, excuse me, is

124
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:33,159
to make a good first impression.

125
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:35,560
It's so, so important in client

126
00:03:35,889 --> 00:03:36,199
services.

127
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:37,759
You want to impress your clients

128
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,259
right out of the bat, because what

129
00:03:39,259 --> 00:03:41,000
that does is it gives it

130
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:42,569
gives them comfort in the decision

131
00:03:42,569 --> 00:03:43,639
that they just made.

132
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:44,800
Because when you make a big

133
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:45,400
decision,

134
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:46,949
like signing on with an agency,

135
00:03:46,949 --> 00:03:48,520
which is probably going to cost

136
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,960
you a couple thousand of dollars,

137
00:03:50,009 --> 00:03:51,449
at least without any like

138
00:03:51,449 --> 00:03:53,650
guarantee of results or any like

139
00:03:53,669 --> 00:03:55,400
way to predict what's actually

140
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:55,960
going to happen

141
00:03:56,009 --> 00:03:57,960
or unfold with full certainty,

142
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,919
giving them comfort and

143
00:04:01,069 --> 00:04:03,770
reassurance and more reasons to

144
00:04:04,099 --> 00:04:05,080
trust you is

145
00:04:05,169 --> 00:04:06,689
the best thing you can do.

146
00:04:06,689 --> 00:04:08,449
And you can do it very simply by

147
00:04:08,449 --> 00:04:11,240
having a rigid set of processes in

148
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:11,879
place,

149
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:13,930
ready to basically fire off as

150
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:16,069
soon as that signed contract or

151
00:04:16,069 --> 00:04:18,040
the service agreement is signed.

152
00:04:18,129 --> 00:04:19,720
So for us, as soon as the signed

153
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,290
service agreement or the service

154
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:22,279
agreement is signed, I keep

155
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:22,839
messing that

156
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:23,129
up.

157
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:24,589
As soon as we get that service

158
00:04:24,589 --> 00:04:26,339
agreement signed, we go into this

159
00:04:26,339 --> 00:04:28,120
Trello board and we create a

160
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:29,670
we create a board from the

161
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:30,449
template.

162
00:04:30,629 --> 00:04:32,089
And then all we have here is

163
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,639
resources.

164
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:35,120
So we have general resources,

165
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:36,910
campaign resources, educational

166
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,759
resources, which I'll explain, and

167
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:39,790
then a to do list.

168
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,730
So you'll see,

169
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:41,889
and then obviously completed

170
00:04:41,889 --> 00:04:43,089
tasks, because we'll move things

171
00:04:43,269 --> 00:04:43,959
over in Trello.

172
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:45,000
You just simply move

173
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:46,819
cards over from the to do list to

174
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:48,160
the completed task.

175
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,910
And that'll help us know where

176
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:50,990
we're at with this

177
00:04:51,329 --> 00:04:52,709
specific project and with this

178
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:53,819
specific client.

179
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:55,339
So like, I'll just walk you

180
00:04:55,339 --> 00:04:56,519
through everything on this

181
00:04:56,569 --> 00:04:57,180
Trello board.

182
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,459
So the first thing you'll notice

183
00:04:58,459 --> 00:05:00,220
is that there's some cards are

184
00:05:00,699 --> 00:05:02,040
labeled in green,

185
00:05:02,129 --> 00:05:03,569
which is actually what the client

186
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:04,370
is supposed to do.

187
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:07,240
And then other ones are labeled in

188
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:07,620
blue,

189
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:08,870
which is called knowledge X,

190
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:10,199
because that's what our agency is

191
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:10,970
supposed to do.

192
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,290
So as soon as we get a

193
00:05:13,649 --> 00:05:15,870
signed service agreement from the

194
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:18,290
client, the first thing we have to

195
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:20,319
do is if we open this card,

196
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,290
there is a checklist of two action

197
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:22,769
items.

198
00:05:22,949 --> 00:05:24,589
The first is to add a signed date

199
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:25,560
to the signed service

200
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:26,540
agreement card.

201
00:05:26,579 --> 00:05:28,139
And the second is to attach the

202
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:29,850
signed PDF to the signed service

203
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:30,759
agreement card.

204
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,079
So that's a card here under

205
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:34,009
general resources, where if you

206
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:36,439
open it, it says when the contract

207
00:05:36,529 --> 00:05:37,250
was signed.

208
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:39,019
And it also says when the first

209
00:05:39,019 --> 00:05:40,480
campaign was started.

210
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,839
So that's helpful information

211
00:05:42,889 --> 00:05:43,470
to have.

212
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:45,079
So you can get an idea for how

213
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:47,050
long does it usually take to start

214
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:49,639
campaigns after a contract's

215
00:05:49,689 --> 00:05:50,129
been signed?

216
00:05:50,129 --> 00:05:51,170
Because that's a common question

217
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:51,970
you'll probably get on sales

218
00:05:52,149 --> 00:05:52,360
calls.

219
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,160
It's like, okay,

220
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:53,970
great, let's do it.

221
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,220
How long do you think until the

222
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,399
first campaign is going to get

223
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:56,860
started?

224
00:05:57,089 --> 00:05:58,810
And you can give them an accurate

225
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:00,699
answer by just recording those two

226
00:06:00,699 --> 00:06:01,970
very important dates.

227
00:06:02,129 --> 00:06:03,639
And you'll want to add an

228
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:05,740
attachment of the signed service

229
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:07,560
agreement to this card,

230
00:06:07,889 --> 00:06:09,300
because what you're going to do,

231
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,060
you're going to invite the client

232
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:11,290
by email

233
00:06:11,649 --> 00:06:13,720
to this Trello board.

234
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,920
So they have access to it.

235
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,480
So it's super nice for them

236
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,790
because they come on here

237
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:18,889
and they could see when they

238
00:06:18,889 --> 00:06:20,129
signed, they could see when the

239
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:21,240
first campaign started,

240
00:06:21,329 --> 00:06:22,680
and they could see when their

241
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,000
invoices do each month.

242
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,800
And they could also see a PDF

243
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,199
version of

244
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:27,740
the signed service agreement in

245
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,319
case they have any questions or

246
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:30,920
whatever it might be.

247
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,639
They might

248
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:34,339
be wondering, oh, what happens in

249
00:06:34,339 --> 00:06:35,649
this scenario?

250
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:36,839
And then they could go back or you

251
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:37,399
could do the same

252
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:38,899
thing and say, hey, you know, you

253
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:40,300
didn't pay the invoice on time.

254
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,550
So based on the signed service

255
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:42,939
agreement, which you could refer

256
00:06:42,939 --> 00:06:43,889
back to in this card here on

257
00:06:44,069 --> 00:06:46,439
Trello, we're going to charge you

258
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:47,079
a 3%

259
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:48,639
late fee, you know, something like

260
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:48,990
that.

261
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:50,329
But anyway, so that's the first

262
00:06:50,329 --> 00:06:51,050
action item.

263
00:06:51,069 --> 00:06:51,709
So you want to add

264
00:06:51,769 --> 00:06:53,060
the signed service agreement and

265
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,329
the date it was signed, and then

266
00:06:54,329 --> 00:06:55,639
you just simply move it over to

267
00:06:55,689 --> 00:06:56,589
the completed task.

268
00:06:56,589 --> 00:06:57,879
And that's all we're doing.

269
00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:00,600
So this is almost like an SOP for

270
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:01,209
us.

271
00:07:01,339 --> 00:07:01,870
It actually is

272
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:03,529
like our SOP for the most part.

273
00:07:03,529 --> 00:07:05,399
What do we do when a client signs?

274
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:08,279
First thing we do is we download

275
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:08,439
the

276
00:07:08,529 --> 00:07:10,550
PDF version of the signed contract

277
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:12,259
and we upload it to this card in

278
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:13,069
Trello.

279
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:15,240
And we also put the date

280
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:16,550
of when it was signed in Trello.

281
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:17,879
And before that, we actually had

282
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:19,240
to create a board in Trello for

283
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:19,300
the

284
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:20,120
new client.

285
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,100
So that's really the second step.

286
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,810
The third step now for us to do is

287
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:24,889
to send an invoice

288
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:26,980
in Stripe for the setup fee or for

289
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,439
the onboarding fee.

290
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:30,350
And part of doing that is to set

291
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:31,079
up the client

292
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,550
as a new customer in Stripe or

293
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:34,209
whatever billing system you're

294
00:07:34,209 --> 00:07:35,959
going to use to collect payments

295
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:36,050
from

296
00:07:36,209 --> 00:07:37,019
your customer.

297
00:07:37,019 --> 00:07:38,449
So that's the second thing.

298
00:07:38,629 --> 00:07:40,180
The next thing is actually for the

299
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:40,920
client to do,

300
00:07:41,009 --> 00:07:42,449
and that's for them to review and

301
00:07:42,449 --> 00:07:43,250
pay the invoice.

302
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:44,720
So the reason I have this as a

303
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:45,160
card

304
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:46,579
is so I can keep it here at the

305
00:07:46,579 --> 00:07:48,250
top of the to-do list card until I

306
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,040
get confirmation that they paid.

307
00:07:50,129 --> 00:07:51,379
Because if I don't have this here

308
00:07:51,379 --> 00:07:53,019
and I just send the invoice, I

309
00:07:53,019 --> 00:07:54,360
might forget and I might,

310
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:55,699
it might be a week or two after it

311
00:07:55,699 --> 00:07:56,910
was actually due and I might

312
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:57,720
realize, oh,

313
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,209
shit, this client still hasn't

314
00:07:59,209 --> 00:08:00,050
paid the invoice.

315
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:01,439
I should reach out to him about

316
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:01,879
it.

317
00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:02,600
But if we keep it

318
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,110
at the top of the to-do list, the

319
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:05,639
client will see that and I'll see

320
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:07,319
it so that if I continue to see

321
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,879
it and it stays there, I can reach

322
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,279
out and say, hey, this still

323
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:11,240
hasn't gotten paid,

324
00:08:11,329 --> 00:08:12,680
you know, pay it.

325
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,920
But let's just say the client paid

326
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,240
the invoice, we can move it over

327
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:15,800
to completed

328
00:08:15,889 --> 00:08:16,180
task.

329
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,660
And this is all that's happening

330
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,019
is we're moving our to-do list

331
00:08:19,019 --> 00:08:21,000
items to completed task items.

332
00:08:21,089 --> 00:08:22,959
And we're having a very specific

333
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:24,800
set of processes to follow as soon

334
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:26,680
as the client is onboarded.

335
00:08:26,769 --> 00:08:28,759
And the next one is just to set up

336
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:30,199
the Trello board.

337
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:31,560
And all we have to do to set up

338
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,038
the Trello

339
00:08:32,129 --> 00:08:33,190
board is what we did in the very

340
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:34,679
beginning of this video, which is

341
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:35,740
to create a board from the

342
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:36,600
template

343
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:38,360
and then invite anyone you need to

344
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,960
invite to the Trello board.

345
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,529
So I'd invite like my partner,

346
00:08:42,529 --> 00:08:42,918
Dan,

347
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,169
I'd invite my partner, Christian.

348
00:08:45,169 --> 00:08:46,610
And then what I do is I just

349
00:08:46,629 --> 00:08:48,759
create a link and I include that

350
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:49,080
in an

351
00:08:49,299 --> 00:08:50,519
onboarding email, which we'll get

352
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:51,409
to in a second here.

353
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:53,090
So just we'll come back to the

354
00:08:53,259 --> 00:08:53,960
actual link

355
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,870
and I'll show you where that's

356
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:55,320
relevant.

357
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,279
I'm not actually going to invite

358
00:08:56,289 --> 00:08:56,919
Dan and Christian,

359
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,440
because this is just an example

360
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,399
board that I'm going to delete

361
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:01,720
right after this video,

362
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:03,220
because it's just for example

363
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:04,759
purposes for this program.

364
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:07,080
So what is involved with setting

365
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:07,240
up the

366
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:08,970
Trello board is just inviting

367
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:10,909
everyone that needs to be invited

368
00:09:10,909 --> 00:09:13,000
and obviously actually setting it

369
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:13,230
up.

370
00:09:13,289 --> 00:09:14,919
So I'll move that one over.

371
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:16,200
The next thing I want to do is set

372
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,960
up a shared Dropbox folder for the

373
00:09:18,289 --> 00:09:18,700
clients.

374
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,559
So for us, we get on Zoom calls

375
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:21,690
with our clients.

376
00:09:21,909 --> 00:09:23,950
We get on an onboarding call

377
00:09:24,049 --> 00:09:24,960
initially,

378
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:26,090
which is part of this process

379
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:26,919
we'll talk about.

380
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:28,720
And there's going to be a video on

381
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,399
how to prepare

382
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:30,549
for the onboarding call and what

383
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:32,450
you should actually discuss on

384
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:33,100
that call.

385
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:35,799
But we get on an onboarding

386
00:09:35,889 --> 00:09:36,899
call and then we also get on

387
00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:38,379
check-in calls, which we'll talk

388
00:09:38,379 --> 00:09:39,600
again about, I think in the next

389
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:40,200
module,

390
00:09:40,409 --> 00:09:41,769
which is how to like retain and

391
00:09:41,769 --> 00:09:44,600
just, yeah, just retain clients

392
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,120
and what you should be doing once

393
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:47,269
you're actually working with

394
00:09:47,409 --> 00:09:48,450
clients for a long time.

395
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:51,039
So we record all of those Zoom

396
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:51,690
calls.

397
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:52,519
And since

398
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,639
Zoom calls are pretty large files,

399
00:09:55,639 --> 00:09:57,220
we just create a Dropbox folder

400
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:59,000
because we have a Dropbox account

401
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:01,620
for our company or for our agency.

402
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,629
And we just have a folder for

403
00:10:03,629 --> 00:10:05,000
every client.

404
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:06,000
And anytime we get on a

405
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:08,070
Zoom call, we just save the drop,

406
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:10,100
the Zoom recording to the client's

407
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:11,320
Dropbox folder.

408
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,029
So it's just nice

409
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:13,590
to have because obviously on the

410
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:15,210
onboarding call, we'll talk about

411
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:16,360
a lot of important stuff.

412
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:17,799
And then also on the check-in

413
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:19,419
calls, we'll talk about a lot of

414
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:20,360
important stuff.

415
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:23,240
And that will be added.

416
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,509
Once we set that up, part of that

417
00:10:25,509 --> 00:10:27,720
setup process is linking it,

418
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:29,690
including a link in this card here

419
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:30,519
on Trello.

420
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:31,960
And that's important because

421
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,600
everyone from my team and

422
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:36,220
from the client's team is on this

423
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:36,929
Trello board.

424
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:38,620
So they could see and access all

425
00:10:38,779 --> 00:10:39,480
the information

426
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:40,110
here.

427
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:42,539
So if I have a Dropbox folder that

428
00:10:42,539 --> 00:10:44,970
has all the recordings, then my

429
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:46,759
team can access those too,

430
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,129
because I also want my team to

431
00:10:48,129 --> 00:10:49,559
know what's going on with this

432
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:50,480
specific client.

433
00:10:50,679 --> 00:10:51,720
And if we need to refer

434
00:10:51,889 --> 00:10:53,500
back to a call where we discuss a

435
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,289
lot of important things, we can

436
00:10:55,289 --> 00:10:57,720
easily access that Dropbox folder

437
00:10:57,809 --> 00:10:59,220
right there in Trello at any time.

438
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,570
So that's the first, that's the

439
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:01,240
next thing.

440
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,279
The next thing is

441
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:04,350
talking about setting up Slack.

442
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:06,009
So the next thing we'll do is set

443
00:11:06,009 --> 00:11:07,639
up Slack, which is where we

444
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:08,200
communicate

445
00:11:08,289 --> 00:11:08,909
with the client.

446
00:11:08,909 --> 00:11:10,029
I'm not going to open this card

447
00:11:10,029 --> 00:11:11,259
because there's some sensitive

448
00:11:11,259 --> 00:11:12,679
information in there.

449
00:11:12,889 --> 00:11:15,009
And I'll also do another video on

450
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:17,470
how to use Slack for your agency

451
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:18,710
because Slack, and we're already

452
00:11:18,769 --> 00:11:19,159
using

453
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,490
Slack right now for our program.

454
00:11:21,669 --> 00:11:23,909
And part of the reason we're using

455
00:11:23,909 --> 00:11:26,600
Slack is because not everyone is

456
00:11:26,929 --> 00:11:28,149
familiar with Slack and I want to

457
00:11:28,149 --> 00:11:29,580
just train you guys and get you

458
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:31,480
comfortable with using Slack

459
00:11:31,809 --> 00:11:33,200
because it's just another one of

460
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,909
those things that's an absolute

461
00:11:34,909 --> 00:11:37,049
must for running an agency

462
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:37,480
business.

463
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:40,240
But basically what we do, and

464
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,190
again, I'll have a more expansive

465
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:43,470
video explaining some of this

466
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:43,720
stuff,

467
00:11:43,809 --> 00:11:45,889
but we just set up channels for

468
00:11:45,889 --> 00:11:48,230
the client and then we'll invite

469
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:50,360
the client to Slack and we'll

470
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:50,679
include

471
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,960
a link in the onboarding form or

472
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:53,399
the onboarding email, which we'll

473
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:53,879
get to.

474
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:55,559
So I'm going to move this

475
00:11:55,649 --> 00:11:56,850
over just to pretend like it's

476
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:57,240
done.

477
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:00,139
And there's multiple tasks there

478
00:12:00,139 --> 00:12:01,399
that I have to check off

479
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,070
because there's multiple channels.

480
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:04,379
And then I have to basically do a

481
00:12:04,379 --> 00:12:05,559
few other things, which again,

482
00:12:05,649 --> 00:12:07,879
will be talked about in one of the

483
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:10,279
later videos.

484
00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:11,440
But so far, let's just look at

485
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,120
what we've done.

486
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:14,440
So as soon as we get confirmation

487
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,919
from HelloSign or whatever signing

488
00:12:16,299 --> 00:12:18,519
tool or e-signature tool we're

489
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:20,490
using that the client has signed

490
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:22,580
our service agreement, we went to

491
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,039
the Trello board or to the

492
00:12:24,129 --> 00:12:25,990
Notion board or however, wherever

493
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:27,730
you have this set up, we created

494
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:29,559
something from the template and

495
00:12:29,559 --> 00:12:29,720
we,

496
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:31,210
or we just created a board.

497
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:32,899
And basically the board tells us

498
00:12:32,899 --> 00:12:36,279
that we, what we need to do.

499
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:36,600
The first

500
00:12:36,809 --> 00:12:38,029
thing we needed to do was attach

501
00:12:38,029 --> 00:12:39,519
the signed service agreement to

502
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:41,230
this card, add the contract signed

503
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:41,620
date.

504
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:43,029
The second thing we needed to do

505
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:44,490
was send an invoice to the client

506
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:45,480
through Stripe.

507
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,039
Part of that

508
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,820
process was adding them or setting

509
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,169
them up as a new customer in

510
00:12:49,169 --> 00:12:49,730
Stripe.

511
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:52,519
Then we see here that the

512
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:53,669
client has to pay the invoice

513
00:12:53,809 --> 00:12:55,320
before the next step can happen.

514
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,799
After that, we have a few more

515
00:12:57,799 --> 00:12:58,080
steps

516
00:12:58,210 --> 00:12:59,610
that we completed, which consisted

517
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:00,919
of setting up the Trello board.

518
00:13:00,929 --> 00:13:03,080
Again, it's a project management

519
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:03,399
tool

520
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:03,960
that we use.

521
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,580
I think it'd be great for you to

522
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:07,100
use Trello because then I could

523
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:09,080
really, really help you.

524
00:13:09,129 --> 00:13:10,659
And because I have experience with

525
00:13:10,659 --> 00:13:12,240
it, hands-on experience, but if

526
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,200
it's Notion or something else,

527
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,590
it's the same framework and

528
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:16,279
concepts.

529
00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:17,639
So as long as you're comfortable

530
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:18,679
with the tool, that's really

531
00:13:18,769 --> 00:13:19,830
all that matters.

532
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:21,879
So we set up the Trello board and

533
00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:23,309
really all that was, was creating

534
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:23,879
a

535
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:25,909
a board from the template and then

536
00:13:25,909 --> 00:13:27,679
also inviting everyone that needs

537
00:13:28,059 --> 00:13:30,360
to be on the board to be on

538
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:30,779
here.

539
00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:32,580
So they all have access, including

540
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,049
the client, obviously.

541
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:36,389
We set up a shared Dropbox folder

542
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:37,080
so that

543
00:13:37,129 --> 00:13:38,539
we can have a place to store

544
00:13:38,549 --> 00:13:40,600
specific files that we're going to

545
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,840
want everyone involved in the

546
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:43,240
project

547
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:44,629
to have access to at any time

548
00:13:44,629 --> 00:13:46,000
throughout the working

549
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,940
relationship.

550
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,679
And also added that to the card

551
00:13:48,679 --> 00:13:48,809
here

552
00:13:48,929 --> 00:13:49,649
here on Trello.

553
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,909
And then we set up the Slack

554
00:13:50,909 --> 00:13:52,529
channels and invited the client to

555
00:13:52,529 --> 00:13:53,320
Slack so that

556
00:13:53,409 --> 00:13:54,289
there's a workspace to

557
00:13:54,289 --> 00:13:55,080
communicate.

558
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,039
So the two most important tools

559
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,519
for our agency, at least with

560
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:02,679
onboarding clients and managing

561
00:14:02,679 --> 00:14:04,830
clients is Trello because Trello

562
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:06,679
is basically like our project

563
00:14:07,049 --> 00:14:07,769
management dot.

564
00:14:07,769 --> 00:14:08,909
It's a dashboard.

565
00:14:08,909 --> 00:14:10,730
It has all the information we'll

566
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:14,120
ever need to have to answer all

567
00:14:14,169 --> 00:14:15,490
the questions that will come up

568
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:17,080
about how our campaign is going.

569
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,039
Where can I find this?

570
00:14:18,279 --> 00:14:18,519
Where can I

571
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:19,330
find that?

572
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:21,129
It's like a storage unit.

573
00:14:21,129 --> 00:14:23,340
Um, but also like, uh, it covers

574
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:24,200
everything because there's

575
00:14:24,289 --> 00:14:25,570
also a to-do list to see like the

576
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:27,129
progress and what we're currently

577
00:14:27,129 --> 00:14:27,879
working on.

578
00:14:27,879 --> 00:14:29,080
So it, oh my God,

579
00:14:29,169 --> 00:14:30,779
you'll be, if you've set up

580
00:14:30,779 --> 00:14:32,509
something like this or even

581
00:14:32,509 --> 00:14:34,519
remotely close to it, especially

582
00:14:34,519 --> 00:14:35,000
in the early

583
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:37,330
days, it'll pay off immensely

584
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:39,529
because people are so, so

585
00:14:39,529 --> 00:14:41,509
impressed about our onboarding

586
00:14:41,509 --> 00:14:42,000
process.

587
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:43,779
Again, it's like something we get

588
00:14:43,779 --> 00:14:45,559
complimented about all the time.

589
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:46,840
And the onboarding process is

590
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:48,830
everything from having a very

591
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:50,539
professional and attractive

592
00:14:51,019 --> 00:14:52,919
looking signed service agreement.

593
00:14:53,139 --> 00:14:55,250
And it's also all the way to

594
00:14:55,429 --> 00:14:58,480
having, uh, an professional

595
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,000
onboarding email being quick to

596
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,149
actually onboard them.

597
00:15:02,289 --> 00:15:03,710
Once you get confirmation that the

598
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:05,679
client signed, there's so much

599
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:06,440
involved

600
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,779
in making a first impression in

601
00:15:07,779 --> 00:15:08,950
the onboarding process.

602
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,139
And it's everything that we're

603
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:10,759
discussing

604
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:12,330
here in this module.

605
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:14,019
So every piece is part of a

606
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,330
greater puzzle that we have to put

607
00:15:16,539 --> 00:15:17,159
together fully

608
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,539
to, to really experience the true

609
00:15:18,539 --> 00:15:19,240
benefits of.

610
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:22,480
So anyways, that's where we're

611
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,139
currently at.

612
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,039
Um,

613
00:15:24,259 --> 00:15:25,820
these next two items for us are

614
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,620
getting very specific to some

615
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:29,559
internal processes that we have

616
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,360
at our agency.

617
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,820
So to be honest, like it won't

618
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:34,820
really make much sense to you, but

619
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:35,720
basically we have a

620
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:36,389
scoreboard.

621
00:15:36,389 --> 00:15:37,779
Uh, so we could keep track of all

622
00:15:37,779 --> 00:15:39,299
the results we're getting for each

623
00:15:39,299 --> 00:15:39,870
client.

624
00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:40,519
And we also

625
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:42,490
have like an invoice tracker sheet

626
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:44,159
so we can keep track of how much

627
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:45,799
to invoice the clients.

628
00:15:45,889 --> 00:15:48,330
Um, so we want to add a new row

629
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:50,970
and a new tab to both of those,

630
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:52,049
uh, documents.

631
00:15:52,179 --> 00:15:53,080
Once we sign a new

632
00:15:53,429 --> 00:15:55,639
client, um, we also have inbox

633
00:15:55,639 --> 00:15:58,269
managers that we hire, uh, and

634
00:15:58,269 --> 00:16:00,919
inbox managers are also using,

635
00:16:01,009 --> 00:16:02,850
like we have a KPI sheet for them.

636
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:04,169
And we also have a Trello

637
00:16:04,169 --> 00:16:05,879
dashboard specifically for our

638
00:16:06,029 --> 00:16:06,360
inbox

639
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:07,320
manager team.

640
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,259
Um, so basically when we get a new

641
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:11,029
client, that new client has to

642
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:12,350
have an inbox manager

643
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:14,500
dedicated to their campaigns.

644
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,730
And that step basically reminds us

645
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:18,360
to assign an inbox manager

646
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:19,990
to this new client and then also

647
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:21,740
follow through with what needs to

648
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:22,679
be done there.

649
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:24,350
Um, and then the,

650
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:25,899
the next step is to send the

651
00:16:25,899 --> 00:16:27,159
onboarding email.

652
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:28,700
So the onboarding email is

653
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:31,559
basically it's recapping

654
00:16:31,929 --> 00:16:33,159
everything you just did and

655
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:35,169
outlining what you need the client

656
00:16:35,169 --> 00:16:37,720
to do now that all this stuff that

657
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:37,809
you

658
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:38,960
did is done.

659
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,389
So one thing I'll grab real quick

660
00:16:41,389 --> 00:16:43,450
is just, uh, I'll create the link

661
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:44,759
so that I can invite

662
00:16:44,809 --> 00:16:45,909
the client here and I'm going to

663
00:16:46,049 --> 00:16:47,090
open the onboarding email.

664
00:16:47,259 --> 00:16:48,460
So before I open and show you our

665
00:16:48,529 --> 00:16:49,000
onboarding

666
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,259
email, what I would say is just to

667
00:16:51,259 --> 00:16:53,509
not, please don't copy this word

668
00:16:53,509 --> 00:16:54,440
for word.

669
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,519
Um, like with anything

670
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:58,590
here, like there's no value or use

671
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:00,490
to copy things exactly how they're

672
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,360
laid out for our agency because

673
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:04,390
every agency and every business is

674
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:05,220
different.

675
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:07,160
And if you start to copy things,

676
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:07,940
your business is not

677
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:09,019
going to be unique and it's not

678
00:17:09,059 --> 00:17:10,009
going to be sustainable.

679
00:17:10,009 --> 00:17:11,240
That's the most important thing

680
00:17:11,289 --> 00:17:13,279
is to have a sustainable business

681
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:15,250
or have a sustainable agency.

682
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:17,230
You have to understand the

683
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:18,970
frameworks and the reasonings

684
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:20,680
behind why we're actually doing

685
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,720
all this stuff.

686
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,279
So if you're just

687
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,009
copying everything mindlessly,

688
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:25,380
you're not actually going to

689
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:26,759
understand things and they're

690
00:17:26,759 --> 00:17:27,318
going to break

691
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:29,359
or they're going to crumble with

692
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:31,200
your business as time goes on.

693
00:17:31,569 --> 00:17:32,970
So we want you to have a

694
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:33,880
sustainable

695
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:35,940
business and skill sets and a

696
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:38,359
foundation that you can build off

697
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:40,599
of for the rest of your life.

698
00:17:40,599 --> 00:17:41,079
Like

699
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:42,170
past just this agency.

700
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:42,529
Sure.

701
00:17:42,529 --> 00:17:43,930
Like you have a goal to scale your

702
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:45,230
agency in the short term.

703
00:17:45,259 --> 00:17:46,039
That's awesome.

704
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:47,359
But these skills and these

705
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:49,160
practices that we're teaching you

706
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,759
are going to be the foundation to

707
00:17:50,759 --> 00:17:51,400
so much more

708
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:53,039
success as life goes on.

709
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,049
And that only happens if you go in

710
00:17:55,049 --> 00:17:56,759
with the mindset that I just

711
00:17:56,759 --> 00:17:57,650
explained.

712
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:58,869
So anyways, in this card in

713
00:17:59,009 --> 00:18:01,049
Trello, another reason why Trello

714
00:18:01,059 --> 00:18:02,380
is so great is because we could

715
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:02,599
have

716
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:04,839
information like this stored.

717
00:18:04,839 --> 00:18:06,400
So here in the description of this

718
00:18:06,779 --> 00:18:08,170
card is our onboarding email.

719
00:18:08,289 --> 00:18:10,240
So the first thing I do is that

720
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,400
Trello card.

721
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,089
I'm just going to add it here.

722
00:18:13,089 --> 00:18:13,779
So we have it and then

723
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,170
I'll explain basically what you're

724
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:15,720
looking at.

725
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,569
So this first line here is our

726
00:18:18,059 --> 00:18:18,759
subject line.

727
00:18:18,759 --> 00:18:19,079
So I'll

728
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:20,509
say client company name x

729
00:18:20,509 --> 00:18:22,329
knowledge x basically the same

730
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,819
naming convention we use for the

731
00:18:23,819 --> 00:18:24,650
Trello board

732
00:18:24,849 --> 00:18:26,440
and then with a dash that says

733
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,289
next steps.

734
00:18:27,289 --> 00:18:29,509
And then here's the actual body of

735
00:18:29,509 --> 00:18:30,990
the email says hey

736
00:18:31,049 --> 00:18:32,359
and then their client name.

737
00:18:32,359 --> 00:18:33,109
My name is Andre.

738
00:18:33,109 --> 00:18:34,400
I'm one of the co-founders here at

739
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,319
knowledge x because

740
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:37,130
they haven't talked to me yet.

741
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:39,000
At least for my agents, the way my

742
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,599
agency works, I have not

743
00:18:40,599 --> 00:18:40,890
interacted

744
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:42,839
with this person at all because

745
00:18:42,839 --> 00:18:44,730
Dan is actually in charge of sales

746
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:46,279
and he's the one getting on sales

747
00:18:46,279 --> 00:18:46,519
calls

748
00:18:46,609 --> 00:18:48,089
and having those conversations

749
00:18:48,089 --> 00:18:49,480
with prospects, right?

750
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,799
So I'm introducing myself because

751
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:51,880
they

752
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:53,240
don't even know who I am yet.

753
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,869
And then basically, I just premise

754
00:18:54,869 --> 00:18:56,119
it with hey, I just wanted to

755
00:18:56,119 --> 00:18:56,359
share

756
00:18:56,569 --> 00:18:58,230
some tasks for you to work on as

757
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:00,049
we were as we get you fully as we

758
00:19:00,099 --> 00:19:03,000
get you fully onboarded, right?

759
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,529
So the whole premise of this email

760
00:19:04,529 --> 00:19:06,059
is what are the next steps because

761
00:19:06,059 --> 00:19:07,720
once they sign a contract,

762
00:19:07,759 --> 00:19:09,410
it's they're probably going to be

763
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:10,920
like, all right, what's next?

764
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,680
Do I just wait to hear from them?

765
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,200
When do campaign?

766
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,890
There's all these questions that

767
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:17,490
are going to come up and at the

768
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:18,039
same time,

769
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:18,839
doubts, right?

770
00:19:18,839 --> 00:19:19,880
They're going to doubt like was

771
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,079
that actually a good decision?

772
00:19:21,079 --> 00:19:21,769
Should I have signed that

773
00:19:22,289 --> 00:19:22,690
contract?

774
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:24,140
Is this going to pay off?

775
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:24,670
Right?

776
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:26,309
So that's why this onboarding

777
00:19:26,309 --> 00:19:27,880
process is so important to keep

778
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,420
it rigid and professional and

779
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:32,049
systemized because you're going to

780
00:19:32,059 --> 00:19:33,799
get rid of that doubt and you're

781
00:19:34,009 --> 00:19:35,240
going to build trust and it's

782
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,500
going to result in client

783
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,359
relationships that last a lifetime

784
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:39,799
if you do this correctly.

785
00:19:39,799 --> 00:19:41,410
So anyways, the premise of this

786
00:19:41,589 --> 00:19:42,809
email again is to outline next

787
00:19:43,259 --> 00:19:43,640
steps for

788
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:44,789
them to work on.

789
00:19:44,789 --> 00:19:46,329
And then I added this.

790
00:19:46,329 --> 00:19:48,569
This was like a modification since

791
00:19:48,569 --> 00:19:50,119
we started collecting

792
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:52,069
onboarding fees and setup fees.

793
00:19:52,069 --> 00:19:53,799
So just to kind of expand on what

794
00:19:53,799 --> 00:19:55,690
we discussed in the last video,

795
00:19:55,759 --> 00:19:57,180
I add this note in our email

796
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:58,910
before going into what needs to

797
00:19:58,910 --> 00:19:59,779
happen next.

798
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:01,160
I say important note,

799
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:01,160
we're not able to begin working on

800
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:01,160
this project until you receive

801
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:01,160
payment for the onboarding

802
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:05,789
invoice.

803
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:07,950
The invoice was sent to you via

804
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:09,480
Stripe to your email address.

805
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,920
If you're experiencing issues when

806
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:12,329
trying to pay the invoice, please

807
00:20:12,329 --> 00:20:13,720
don't hesitate to contact us.

808
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,839
So it's basically saying, Hey,

809
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:17,140
we signed on, we did all this work

810
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:19,029
up to this point, but we can't do

811
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:20,410
anything else until that gets

812
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:21,240
paid.

813
00:20:21,329 --> 00:20:23,000
And it was already sent to you.

814
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,470
If you have any issues trying to

815
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:25,400
find it or pay for it,

816
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:27,140
let us know we're here to help.

817
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:28,519
And that's really it.

818
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:29,319
So we're setting that,

819
00:20:29,529 --> 00:20:31,400
uh, we're setting that expectation

820
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,000
that nothing's going to move

821
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,680
forward until the invoice is paid,

822
00:20:34,769 --> 00:20:35,829
which is super important because

823
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:37,670
even when we're, so the reason we

824
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:39,319
added this modification

825
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:40,880
is because even when we started

826
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,660
charging setup fees, they wouldn't

827
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:43,000
be paid

828
00:20:43,089 --> 00:20:45,319
as quickly as we would have liked

829
00:20:45,509 --> 00:20:46,359
them to.

830
00:20:46,359 --> 00:20:47,789
And we even ran into a scenario

831
00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:49,039
where we signed a client

832
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:50,769
and we started doing all the work

833
00:20:50,769 --> 00:20:52,200
because we're excited.

834
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,380
Anytime we sign a client, we're

835
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:53,720
excited.

836
00:20:53,809 --> 00:20:55,109
Like we want to be on top of

837
00:20:55,109 --> 00:20:57,079
things and we want to impress them

838
00:20:57,079 --> 00:20:58,039
and build trust by

839
00:20:59,009 --> 00:21:00,500
getting all this stuff done for

840
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,119
them as soon as possible.

841
00:21:02,119 --> 00:21:03,400
Like a lot of agencies,

842
00:21:03,619 --> 00:21:05,720
this is actually important to

843
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:07,549
mention our agency.

844
00:21:07,579 --> 00:21:10,680
Um, we onboard, like as soon as a

845
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,319
client signs,

846
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:12,460
we could get their campaigns

847
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:13,650
launched within seven days.

848
00:21:13,829 --> 00:21:15,640
And a lot of our competitors take

849
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,309
14 to 30 days

850
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:18,470
to launch campaigns.

851
00:21:18,609 --> 00:21:20,420
So like right there, that's an

852
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:23,480
instant, um, selling point for us

853
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:23,640
is,

854
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,789
hey, like we're going to be really

855
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:25,480
quick to launch.

856
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,490
We're going to, as soon as you

857
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:26,839
sign,

858
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,809
we're going to hit the ground

859
00:21:27,809 --> 00:21:28,279
running.

860
00:21:28,279 --> 00:21:29,950
We have a very rigid process and

861
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:30,900
place to follow.

862
00:21:31,009 --> 00:21:32,509
And we're going to get campaigns

863
00:21:32,509 --> 00:21:34,180
launched within a week, which is

864
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,490
way quicker and sooner than any

865
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:37,900
other agency would be able to do

866
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,099
that, uh, that you might be

867
00:21:39,109 --> 00:21:40,299
considering working with.

868
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:41,319
And it's true.

869
00:21:41,369 --> 00:21:42,910
And again, it's one of the biggest

870
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:44,289
reasons why we have such great

871
00:21:44,289 --> 00:21:45,799
success retaining clients and

872
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:47,269
building trust with clients and

873
00:21:47,269 --> 00:21:48,809
having great relationships with

874
00:21:48,809 --> 00:21:49,960
clients right off the bat.

875
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,640
It's because we're, we're doing

876
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,920
our work very quickly.

877
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,119
And it's because we have these

878
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:54,759
processes

879
00:21:54,809 --> 00:21:55,730
set up in order for that to

880
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:56,160
happen.

881
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,720
But anyways, back to the, to the

882
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,359
email.

883
00:21:58,359 --> 00:21:59,960
Um, yeah, we, oh,

884
00:22:00,009 --> 00:22:00,200
okay.

885
00:22:00,279 --> 00:22:01,789
We had a client that signed and we

886
00:22:01,789 --> 00:22:03,559
did all the work super quick up

887
00:22:03,559 --> 00:22:04,359
front because we were

888
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:05,940
excited and they ended up not

889
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:08,019
paying the invoice and like a week

890
00:22:08,019 --> 00:22:09,640
or two went on and we just didn't

891
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:10,349
hear from them.

892
00:22:10,349 --> 00:22:11,579
They didn't pay the invoice and

893
00:22:11,579 --> 00:22:12,890
that we literally just never heard

894
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:13,609
back from this

895
00:22:13,859 --> 00:22:14,180
person.

896
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:15,799
So they literally entered into a

897
00:22:15,799 --> 00:22:16,819
legal agreement.

898
00:22:16,819 --> 00:22:19,000
They signed the service agreement,

899
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:21,640
but just after that ghosted us.

900
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:24,380
So that's why it's important to

901
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:26,000
say like you're charging an

902
00:22:26,259 --> 00:22:27,460
onboarding fee and a setup fee to

903
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:28,890
get compensated for all the work

904
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:30,440
that you're going to be doing

905
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:32,119
before campaigns are even started.

906
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:33,690
And in, you know, the 90 days that

907
00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:34,759
you're going to be working

908
00:22:34,809 --> 00:22:37,009
on this relationship or 30 days or

909
00:22:37,009 --> 00:22:38,779
whatever you decided on in the

910
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:39,480
last video,

911
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,640
so just make sure you collect that

912
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:42,430
payment.

913
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:44,579
Um, and it's a very fair standard

914
00:22:44,579 --> 00:22:45,170
to set.

915
00:22:45,299 --> 00:22:45,640
Like

916
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,039
we've never had anyone say, oh, we

917
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:47,650
work on this.

918
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:48,430
I'll pay it later.

919
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,960
Like no one would ever say that.

920
00:22:50,049 --> 00:22:51,630
Like it's a very fair standard to

921
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:52,009
set.

922
00:22:52,009 --> 00:22:53,650
Uh, just be sure to be clear about

923
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,319
it and set that standard.

924
00:22:55,369 --> 00:22:57,210
So that's the important note.

925
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:59,019
Um, and then we go right into the

926
00:22:59,019 --> 00:23:00,890
task for them to get started.

927
00:23:01,019 --> 00:23:01,549
So this is

928
00:23:01,769 --> 00:23:03,029
also super important.

929
00:23:03,029 --> 00:23:04,230
Like psychology.

930
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:06,039
If you keep your client busy,

931
00:23:06,039 --> 00:23:07,269
you're setting a great.

932
00:23:07,339 --> 00:23:07,549
So

933
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:09,500
you want to engage the client.

934
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,359
You want to involve the client as

935
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,119
much as possible in the working

936
00:23:13,509 --> 00:23:14,119
relationship.

937
00:23:14,119 --> 00:23:15,400
Obviously they hired you to save

938
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:15,950
them time.

939
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,480
And so that a lot of this can be

940
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:17,720
done

941
00:23:18,049 --> 00:23:19,200
without their input.

942
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,279
But at the same time, in order for

943
00:23:21,279 --> 00:23:22,839
you to have a successful

944
00:23:22,839 --> 00:23:23,289
relationship

945
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:24,900
with the client, they have to feel

946
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,039
like they're involved.

947
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:27,319
They have to feel like they're

948
00:23:27,579 --> 00:23:27,960
playing a

949
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:29,480
role in the process.

950
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,559
And the way we can do that is just

951
00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:33,529
by giving them actual work to do

952
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:33,990
and actual

953
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:35,599
work that we can use and benefit

954
00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:36,019
from.

955
00:23:36,019 --> 00:23:37,289
So we could get them better

956
00:23:37,359 --> 00:23:40,289
results and just make everything

957
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:42,339
better is, is really the way to

958
00:23:42,339 --> 00:23:42,950
say it.

959
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:45,079
So we want to involve the clients

960
00:23:45,079 --> 00:23:47,640
day one of the working

961
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:48,339
relationship.

962
00:23:48,339 --> 00:23:49,509
As soon as they sign, we want to

963
00:23:49,509 --> 00:23:50,890
start giving them homework, just

964
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:51,359
like we're doing

965
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:52,710
with you here in this program.

966
00:23:52,849 --> 00:23:54,039
Like as soon as you signed on,

967
00:23:54,069 --> 00:23:55,240
we're giving you homework.

968
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:56,180
You got to get on these calls.

969
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:57,240
You got to watch these videos.

970
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,759
Like we're giving you tasks

971
00:23:58,849 --> 00:24:00,440
that we need you to accomplish.

972
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,880
And that's what you want to do

973
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:02,910
with your clients.

974
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:03,559
Now that they signed

975
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:05,240
on and agreed to work with you,

976
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,799
here's what they need to do to

977
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:08,680
make this a smashing success.

978
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:08,839
And

979
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:10,470
obviously it has to be reasonable.

980
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:11,769
And we'll explain why each of

981
00:24:11,769 --> 00:24:13,079
these is reasonable and why you

982
00:24:13,079 --> 00:24:13,319
should

983
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:14,869
have something similar with your

984
00:24:14,869 --> 00:24:15,359
agency.

985
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:17,019
So the four tasks we give them.

986
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:20,039
The first is to fill out our

987
00:24:20,259 --> 00:24:20,970
onboarding form.

988
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:22,369
So we just call it like something

989
00:24:22,549 --> 00:24:24,279
fancy, new client onboarding form

990
00:24:24,279 --> 00:24:25,009
by clicking here.

991
00:24:25,329 --> 00:24:27,069
And then the email will include a

992
00:24:27,069 --> 00:24:28,849
link to our onboarding form, which

993
00:24:28,849 --> 00:24:29,960
is just a simple Google

994
00:24:30,049 --> 00:24:30,309
form.

995
00:24:30,309 --> 00:24:31,509
So you could use type form.

996
00:24:31,509 --> 00:24:32,609
You could use a form on your

997
00:24:32,609 --> 00:24:34,019
website, or you could just use

998
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:34,359
Google

999
00:24:34,579 --> 00:24:35,509
forms like we do.

1000
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:36,940
It's really simple.

1001
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:38,089
And I have a whole video

1002
00:24:38,539 --> 00:24:41,079
explaining our onboarding form and

1003
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:41,319
how

1004
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:42,920
to come up with an onboarding form

1005
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,599
of your own.

1006
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:45,119
It's just what questions or what

1007
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,200
answers do you need

1008
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:48,890
to know or to have so that you can

1009
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:50,849
go about doing everything else you

1010
00:24:50,849 --> 00:24:52,039
have to do

1011
00:24:52,089 --> 00:24:53,940
to work on their campaigns or

1012
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:55,160
their project.

1013
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,839
So that's the first thing.

1014
00:24:56,839 --> 00:24:57,960
So an onboarding form is

1015
00:24:58,049 --> 00:24:58,700
super important.

1016
00:24:58,700 --> 00:24:59,869
You got to collect an onboarding

1017
00:24:59,869 --> 00:25:00,900
form because there's lots of

1018
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:01,690
information that you

1019
00:25:01,849 --> 00:25:03,210
and your team are going to need to

1020
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:04,690
operate off of that obviously you

1021
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:06,599
don't have access to yet just from

1022
00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:08,250
the sales call in the contract

1023
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:09,400
that they signed.

1024
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,299
So that's the first step.

1025
00:25:10,779 --> 00:25:12,170
The second step is you

1026
00:25:12,289 --> 00:25:13,910
want to get on an onboarding call.

1027
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:15,339
So we call this the onboarding

1028
00:25:15,339 --> 00:25:15,920
zoom call.

1029
00:25:16,349 --> 00:25:18,680
So you want them to schedule

1030
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:19,829
an onboarding call.

1031
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:21,690
And we could use Calendly, which

1032
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:23,329
we use for our sales process to

1033
00:25:23,329 --> 00:25:24,200
actually coordinate

1034
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:26,130
the scheduling of those onboarding

1035
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:27,880
calls to make things really easy

1036
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,559
for both you and for the client.

1037
00:25:29,769 --> 00:25:30,880
Again, another way to look

1038
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,759
professional.

1039
00:25:31,759 --> 00:25:33,799
So we send this link in our email

1040
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:35,130
and it just says KnowledgeX

1041
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:36,740
new client onboarding call.

1042
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:38,619
And basically they could see when

1043
00:25:38,619 --> 00:25:41,000
I'm available and when the entire

1044
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:41,400
team is

1045
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:42,839
available to get on an onboarding

1046
00:25:42,839 --> 00:25:43,190
call.

1047
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,470
And all we ask is for their name

1048
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:45,089
and email.

1049
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:45,880
And then we also

1050
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:47,369
ask if they completed the

1051
00:25:47,369 --> 00:25:49,279
onboarding form, because what

1052
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:51,240
started to happen sometimes is

1053
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,039
they would book an

1054
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:52,990
onboarding call.

1055
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:54,359
But by the time the onboarding

1056
00:25:54,549 --> 00:25:55,769
call happened, they didn't yet

1057
00:25:55,769 --> 00:25:57,720
fill out the onboarding form,

1058
00:25:57,809 --> 00:25:58,869
which makes the onboarding call

1059
00:25:59,009 --> 00:25:59,640
pointless.

1060
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,400
So again, we'll have videos

1061
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,599
specifically talking about

1062
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:04,079
the onboarding form in the

1063
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:05,690
onboarding call and why it's

1064
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:07,480
important to have the onboarding

1065
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,170
form responses

1066
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,319
before getting on the onboarding

1067
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:10,690
call.

1068
00:26:10,869 --> 00:26:12,549
But that's like the process we

1069
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:12,990
use.

1070
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:13,880
So that's the second thing

1071
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:14,470
we ask for.

1072
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:15,890
So they filled out a form, they

1073
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:17,130
booked the call with us.

1074
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,000
And the onboarding call is great

1075
00:26:19,319 --> 00:26:20,440
because it's basically them

1076
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:21,819
getting a chance to meet the

1077
00:26:21,819 --> 00:26:23,660
entire team behind the project.

1078
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:24,569
And those calls

1079
00:26:24,769 --> 00:26:26,819
are usually like the easiest way

1080
00:26:26,819 --> 00:26:28,869
to build trust because you have

1081
00:26:28,869 --> 00:26:30,440
some face to face time on a

1082
00:26:30,529 --> 00:26:31,150
zoom call.

1083
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:33,079
You can answer all their questions

1084
00:26:33,079 --> 00:26:34,619
and you're just spending time with

1085
00:26:34,619 --> 00:26:35,319
the client.

1086
00:26:35,369 --> 00:26:36,650
And that's why going back to the

1087
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:38,410
last video, it's important to

1088
00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:40,200
charge a setup fee because there's

1089
00:26:40,289 --> 00:26:41,950
real time that you're committing

1090
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,450
early on to this relationship

1091
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:45,160
before the campaigns are even

1092
00:26:45,309 --> 00:26:45,559
launched.

1093
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:47,250
And you want to be compensated for

1094
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:48,759
that time investment, right?

1095
00:26:48,759 --> 00:26:49,279
You want to protect

1096
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:51,000
your time as a business owner.

1097
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,259
It's one of the most important

1098
00:26:52,259 --> 00:26:53,640
things to train yourself to do.

1099
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:56,890
And then the last two tasks for

1100
00:26:56,890 --> 00:26:59,549
them involve, again, Slack and

1101
00:26:59,549 --> 00:27:01,319
Trello, like the two most

1102
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:03,109
important tools for us to manage

1103
00:27:03,109 --> 00:27:04,839
our work and relationship.

1104
00:27:04,839 --> 00:27:06,200
So the first one is Slack.

1105
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:06,519
So we

1106
00:27:06,609 --> 00:27:08,140
give them a link to join our Slack

1107
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:08,839
workspace.

1108
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:10,400
So when you set up a workspace in

1109
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:11,799
Slack, you'll have

1110
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:13,410
like a unique link that you can

1111
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:14,970
send to invite people to your

1112
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:15,769
workspace.

1113
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:16,920
And then once they're in your

1114
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,220
workspace, you could add them to

1115
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,589
the specific channels that you set

1116
00:27:19,589 --> 00:27:19,880
up.

1117
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,240
We use Slack for

1118
00:27:21,569 --> 00:27:21,829
everything.

1119
00:27:21,829 --> 00:27:22,970
We even have an announcements

1120
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:24,240
channel in our Slack, similar to

1121
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,200
like we have in our Slack

1122
00:27:26,549 --> 00:27:28,019
workspace for the program where

1123
00:27:28,019 --> 00:27:29,750
all the clients are in that, in

1124
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:31,640
that announcements channel.

1125
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:31,960
Also,

1126
00:27:32,049 --> 00:27:33,519
just to take a step back, I know

1127
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:35,200
there's going to be another video

1128
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,839
on, on how to use Slack for your

1129
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:39,150
agency, but just pay attention to

1130
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:40,809
how Slack is set up for this

1131
00:27:41,019 --> 00:27:42,759
program specifically.

1132
00:27:42,759 --> 00:27:43,720
We have an announcements

1133
00:27:44,049 --> 00:27:45,529
channel, which is basically like

1134
00:27:45,529 --> 00:27:47,220
company-wide announcements or

1135
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:48,680
program-wide announcements in

1136
00:27:48,769 --> 00:27:49,640
our scenario.

1137
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,009
So have something like that.

1138
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:52,480
We have a general chat channel,

1139
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:53,799
which actually isn't really

1140
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:55,289
applicable to this because you

1141
00:27:55,289 --> 00:27:56,890
don't want your clients chatting

1142
00:27:56,890 --> 00:27:58,279
amongst themselves in most

1143
00:27:58,279 --> 00:27:59,160
scenarios.

1144
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,720
So that you could probably do away

1145
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,160
with.

1146
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,349
But just really pay attention to

1147
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:04,039
the two things,

1148
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:05,759
the announcements channel, which

1149
00:28:05,759 --> 00:28:06,779
is like company-wide

1150
00:28:06,779 --> 00:28:08,359
announcements, and then also

1151
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:10,079
each of us having our own private

1152
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:10,690
channel.

1153
00:28:10,869 --> 00:28:12,519
That's basically how you set up a

1154
00:28:12,539 --> 00:28:14,349
channel or a workspace for

1155
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:16,029
your agency and for your clients

1156
00:28:16,029 --> 00:28:17,960
is you'll have announcements which

1157
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,480
everyone has access to.

1158
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:20,980
So you could send any relevant

1159
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:22,720
updates for your company that'll

1160
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,279
be sent to all people involved

1161
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,420
or all the clients involved in or

1162
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:28,359
working with your company.

1163
00:28:28,359 --> 00:28:29,640
And then you could also on a

1164
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:29,960
lower,

1165
00:28:30,049 --> 00:28:32,990
on a more specific level, have a

1166
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:35,519
channel that's private and only

1167
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:37,240
includes the client and anyone

1168
00:28:37,329 --> 00:28:38,039
from their team.

1169
00:28:38,039 --> 00:28:39,390
And then everyone from your team

1170
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:40,740
that's working on that client's

1171
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:41,160
project.

1172
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,799
So pay attention to the way we set

1173
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:44,599
these things up because there's

1174
00:28:44,599 --> 00:28:47,000
intention behind it to start to

1175
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:48,920
train you guys to think in this

1176
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,359
way and then in this framework.

1177
00:28:50,410 --> 00:28:52,200
So that's the third thing.

1178
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,579
We send them the link so they

1179
00:28:53,579 --> 00:28:55,160
could join the Slack workspace.

1180
00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:56,220
And Slack is where they could

1181
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,470
start communicating with us.

1182
00:28:57,470 --> 00:28:58,880
So once they join there, we'll

1183
00:28:58,880 --> 00:28:59,400
send like

1184
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,910
a message saying, "Hey, welcome.

1185
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:02,470
Thanks for being here." And we'll

1186
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:03,559
just kind of kick off the

1187
00:29:03,579 --> 00:29:04,279
conversation

1188
00:29:04,369 --> 00:29:05,599
and give them a warm welcome

1189
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:06,119
there.

1190
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:07,890
And then the Trello project

1191
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:09,640
management board, which you're

1192
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:09,849
seeing

1193
00:29:10,049 --> 00:29:10,410
here.

1194
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:12,140
So basically that's why I copied

1195
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:13,930
the link because every board has a

1196
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:14,839
unique link.

1197
00:29:14,839 --> 00:29:15,720
And so I just

1198
00:29:16,069 --> 00:29:17,670
basically copied it into the email

1199
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:19,329
and had that as a fourth step,

1200
00:29:19,329 --> 00:29:20,690
which is to join the project

1201
00:29:21,109 --> 00:29:22,230
management board on Trello.

1202
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:23,579
So the client will join it and

1203
00:29:23,599 --> 00:29:25,019
they'll just see exactly what

1204
00:29:25,019 --> 00:29:25,720
we're seeing

1205
00:29:25,809 --> 00:29:26,140
here.

1206
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:27,819
And for the most part, they'll be

1207
00:29:27,819 --> 00:29:28,970
super overwhelmed.

1208
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:32,599
But what I say, I give them some

1209
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:34,269
guidance here in the email, which

1210
00:29:34,269 --> 00:29:35,160
kind of helps.

1211
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:37,569
So first, after I go through all

1212
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:38,579
the steps that they

1213
00:29:38,769 --> 00:29:40,039
need to do to get properly

1214
00:29:40,039 --> 00:29:41,839
onboarded or fully onboarded, I

1215
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:43,309
say, "That's all for now.

1216
00:29:43,319 --> 00:29:44,519
I'm excited to formally

1217
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:45,559
welcome you as a client.

1218
00:29:45,559 --> 00:29:46,690
I speak on behalf of my entire

1219
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:48,200
team when I say we're grateful for

1220
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:48,250
the

1221
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:49,980
opportunity to work with you."

1222
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:51,559
Enthusiastically, Andre.

1223
00:29:51,559 --> 00:29:52,990
So that's the onboarding email.

1224
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:53,880
Again,

1225
00:29:54,089 --> 00:29:56,200
this has worked extremely well.

1226
00:29:56,390 --> 00:29:58,069
And we try to send this to our

1227
00:29:58,069 --> 00:30:00,109
clients that sign.

1228
00:30:00,259 --> 00:30:01,619
The timeline for this

1229
00:30:01,809 --> 00:30:04,039
is, excuse me, we try to send this

1230
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:06,480
out to clients the same day that

1231
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,680
they signed the contract.

1232
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,400
So we want

1233
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:11,329
to have a really quick turnaround

1234
00:30:11,329 --> 00:30:11,730
time.

1235
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:13,670
We almost want them to think it's

1236
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:15,390
an automated email for how

1237
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:16,869
fast it's sent since when they've

1238
00:30:16,869 --> 00:30:17,940
signed the contract.

1239
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:19,319
But then they go in the email and

1240
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:19,460
they're

1241
00:30:19,569 --> 00:30:20,509
like, "Oh, no way.

1242
00:30:20,509 --> 00:30:22,220
This can't be automated." Because

1243
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:23,819
there's so many custom things that

1244
00:30:23,819 --> 00:30:24,759
are set up here,

1245
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:26,650
like the Slack workspace and the

1246
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:28,450
Trello board being specifically

1247
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:31,160
customized to their company.

1248
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,039
So anyways,

1249
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:33,190
it's not an automated email.

1250
00:30:33,329 --> 00:30:34,690
There's probably ways to automate

1251
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:36,099
this, but I manually send this

1252
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:36,680
because

1253
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,839
I enjoy the onboarding process and

1254
00:30:38,839 --> 00:30:41,650
the clients also really value it.

1255
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:43,240
So our onboarding process,

1256
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:45,200
again, out of all the things we do

1257
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,970
at our agency gets complimented

1258
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:48,759
more than anything else.

1259
00:30:49,849 --> 00:30:51,650
So that's the whole email.

1260
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:53,690
So I include a PS because there's

1261
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:56,069
a lot of information here and

1262
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,269
a lot of our clients aren't

1263
00:30:57,410 --> 00:30:59,009
familiar with Slack or they're not

1264
00:30:59,009 --> 00:31:00,359
familiar with Trello or they're

1265
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:00,599
not

1266
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:02,220
familiar with Google Forms or

1267
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:02,910
Calendly.

1268
00:31:02,910 --> 00:31:04,289
So we want to give them some

1269
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:05,160
guidance.

1270
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:05,559
Obviously,

1271
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:06,710
they could respond to this email

1272
00:31:06,849 --> 00:31:07,640
with questions.

1273
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:10,009
But in a PS, I just kind of give

1274
00:31:10,009 --> 00:31:11,130
them like a starting

1275
00:31:11,329 --> 00:31:11,640
point.

1276
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,029
So I say, "When you join the Slack

1277
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:14,599
workspace, please read the pinned

1278
00:31:14,599 --> 00:31:15,799
messages in the announcements

1279
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:16,779
channel." So that's the first

1280
00:31:16,819 --> 00:31:17,160
thing.

1281
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,359
When they join Slack, I'm like,

1282
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:20,130
just basically catch up to all the

1283
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:22,059
recent announcements we've put out

1284
00:31:22,059 --> 00:31:22,990
to our client

1285
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:23,450
base.

1286
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:24,789
So you can see where we're

1287
00:31:24,789 --> 00:31:26,450
currently at as a company and if

1288
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:28,200
there are any important updates

1289
00:31:28,289 --> 00:31:29,789
that we've shared recently that

1290
00:31:29,789 --> 00:31:31,180
might be applicable to your

1291
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,759
working relationship with us and

1292
00:31:32,759 --> 00:31:33,000
you might

1293
00:31:33,089 --> 00:31:34,359
even have questions on.

1294
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:36,079
And then I also say, "When you

1295
00:31:36,079 --> 00:31:38,569
join the Trello board, please

1296
00:31:38,779 --> 00:31:39,240
review

1297
00:31:39,329 --> 00:31:40,579
the first few videos in the

1298
00:31:40,579 --> 00:31:42,650
educational resources column." So

1299
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:44,759
I have this column here in Trello

1300
00:31:44,759 --> 00:31:45,079
called

1301
00:31:45,299 --> 00:31:47,190
Educational Resources and

1302
00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:49,799
basically I just recorded videos

1303
00:31:49,799 --> 00:31:52,599
to help the client onboard

1304
00:31:52,599 --> 00:31:53,640
themselves.

1305
00:31:53,690 --> 00:31:55,230
So I have a video on how to use

1306
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:57,089
the Trello board and I literally

1307
00:31:57,089 --> 00:31:58,599
just recorded a Loom video

1308
00:31:58,769 --> 00:31:59,829
saying, "Hey, thanks so much for

1309
00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:00,519
being here.

1310
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:01,640
This is our Trello board.

1311
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,680
This is what it's used for.

1312
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:05,319
Here's what every single card is

1313
00:32:05,319 --> 00:32:07,009
meeting and what you might want to

1314
00:32:07,009 --> 00:32:08,930
use them for." So I have a video

1315
00:32:09,349 --> 00:32:10,690
explaining Trello and then I have

1316
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:12,200
a video explaining Slack.

1317
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,579
That way they know exactly how to

1318
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:15,400
use Trello and

1319
00:32:15,609 --> 00:32:17,369
they know exactly how to use Slack

1320
00:32:17,369 --> 00:32:19,000
because of the videos that I

1321
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,359
recorded for them.

1322
00:32:20,359 --> 00:32:21,960
So what I would

1323
00:32:22,309 --> 00:32:24,099
recommend is, yeah, you need SOPs

1324
00:32:24,099 --> 00:32:26,190
internally so your team knows what

1325
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:29,559
to do, but also consider SOPs for

1326
00:32:29,769 --> 00:32:31,369
your clients so that they know

1327
00:32:31,369 --> 00:32:33,259
what to do and they get the proper

1328
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:35,400
guidance because that's always

1329
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:35,809
forgotten

1330
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:37,019
about from my experience.

1331
00:32:37,019 --> 00:32:38,200
People forget about the clients

1332
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:39,450
and they just assume that the

1333
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:40,119
client knows

1334
00:32:40,329 --> 00:32:40,519
everything.

1335
00:32:40,519 --> 00:32:44,049
But if the client's confused, it's

1336
00:32:44,299 --> 00:32:45,250
going to lead to doubt.

1337
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:46,599
It's going to lead to more

1338
00:32:46,599 --> 00:32:47,119
uncertainty.

1339
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:48,579
It's going to lead to more doubt

1340
00:32:48,579 --> 00:32:49,569
and it's going to spoil the

1341
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:51,880
relationship from the very

1342
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:52,359
beginning,

1343
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:53,509
which is you never want to do

1344
00:32:53,509 --> 00:32:53,880
that.

1345
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:56,049
So how do you flip the script

1346
00:32:56,539 --> 00:32:58,119
there and ensure that the

1347
00:32:58,470 --> 00:32:59,839
relationship goes well and ensure

1348
00:32:59,839 --> 00:33:01,609
that there's confidence instilled

1349
00:33:01,609 --> 00:33:02,920
is by setting up a process

1350
00:33:03,009 --> 00:33:03,579
like this.

1351
00:33:03,579 --> 00:33:05,019
So that's the next step in the

1352
00:33:05,019 --> 00:33:05,730
to-do list.

1353
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:07,420
So I drag that over here.

1354
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:08,759
And now those are

1355
00:33:08,849 --> 00:33:10,059
the completed tasks.

1356
00:33:10,059 --> 00:33:11,730
And then in the to-do list, the

1357
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:13,140
next few things are for the

1358
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:13,880
client.

1359
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:14,279
So they have

1360
00:33:14,319 --> 00:33:15,819
to fill out the onboarding form.

1361
00:33:15,819 --> 00:33:17,170
So we'd move that over once they

1362
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:19,000
fill out the onboarding form.

1363
00:33:19,089 --> 00:33:20,420
They have to book an onboarding

1364
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:20,789
call.

1365
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:22,250
So we'll move that over once they

1366
00:33:22,319 --> 00:33:23,400
book an onboarding call.

1367
00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:25,710
And then, yeah, everything else is

1368
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:27,460
basically what we would work on at

1369
00:33:27,579 --> 00:33:29,160
our agency to get them onboarded.

1370
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,759
So since we're a lead gen agency,

1371
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:32,410
I'll just quickly run through some

1372
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,400
of this stuff.

1373
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,000
We'll set up a Google workspace

1374
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,119
account for them.

1375
00:33:36,119 --> 00:33:37,880
We'll set up a Google Chrome user

1376
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:38,839
for them.

1377
00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:40,809
We'll begin the email warmup

1378
00:33:40,809 --> 00:33:42,279
process for them.

1379
00:33:42,279 --> 00:33:43,730
We'll create a leads list for

1380
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:44,200
them.

1381
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,400
The client

1382
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:46,819
has a task here real quick.

1383
00:33:46,819 --> 00:33:48,309
They only have a few more tasks

1384
00:33:48,309 --> 00:33:49,799
after the initial onboarding

1385
00:33:49,799 --> 00:33:50,200
process,

1386
00:33:50,410 --> 00:33:51,740
which is to approve the leads

1387
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:52,190
list.

1388
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:53,869
That's all discussed on the

1389
00:33:53,869 --> 00:33:55,559
onboarding call itself,

1390
00:33:55,650 --> 00:33:56,880
which again, there's going to be a

1391
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:57,720
separate video on.

1392
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:00,359
So they'd approve the leads list.

1393
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,920
We'd also craft the scripts for

1394
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,609
the campaigns and they'd approve

1395
00:34:03,609 --> 00:34:04,839
the scripts as well.

1396
00:34:04,839 --> 00:34:05,160
Again,

1397
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:06,569
this is all discussed on the

1398
00:34:06,569 --> 00:34:07,690
onboarding call.

1399
00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:09,610
We'll configure their Calendly

1400
00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:10,519
event because that's

1401
00:34:10,739 --> 00:34:12,760
what we use to schedule calls for

1402
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,219
our clients and to track

1403
00:34:14,699 --> 00:34:16,920
everything in an automated way.

1404
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,510
We'll set up Zapier workflows for

1405
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:19,230
the client.

1406
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:21,400
We'll set up their sky lead

1407
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:21,719
account.

1408
00:34:21,809 --> 00:34:23,050
That's what we're currently using

1409
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:24,030
to do our outreach.

1410
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:26,440
And then we'll start the sky lead

1411
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,079
sequences.

1412
00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:28,900
And then basically that's like the

1413
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:29,639
last step.

1414
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:30,880
And then the two last steps are

1415
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:31,960
for the client,

1416
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:33,630
just as a constant reminder to

1417
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:35,659
review the educational resources,

1418
00:34:36,139 --> 00:34:36,920
because there's also

1419
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:38,559
some good resources here on how to

1420
00:34:38,559 --> 00:34:40,360
optimize their LinkedIn profile.

1421
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:42,920
Since we're doing lead generation,

1422
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:44,409
that's what our agency does.

1423
00:34:44,409 --> 00:34:45,719
We want them to have the most

1424
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:47,320
optimized website and LinkedIn

1425
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:47,880
profile

1426
00:34:48,309 --> 00:34:50,250
possible because that helps us get

1427
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:51,590
the best results.

1428
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:53,349
And then we also have like a

1429
00:34:53,349 --> 00:34:54,920
project timeline here,

1430
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:57,650
which just talks about what they

1431
00:34:57,650 --> 00:34:59,280
can expect now that they're an

1432
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,119
onboarded client.

1433
00:35:00,119 --> 00:35:00,489
So again,

1434
00:35:00,559 --> 00:35:02,000
we want to like give them as much

1435
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,510
guidance as possible.

1436
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:06,090
So they know exactly what's the

1437
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:06,679
deal.

1438
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:09,000
Like, what can they expect?

1439
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,920
What do they need to be doing?

1440
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,760
What are we supposed to be doing?

1441
00:35:12,809 --> 00:35:13,909
And they could see all of that

1442
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:15,090
here on the Trello board.

1443
00:35:15,269 --> 00:35:16,710
That's why Trello is so great,

1444
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:17,320
because they have,

1445
00:35:17,409 --> 00:35:18,469
again, they have access to this

1446
00:35:18,610 --> 00:35:19,650
board so they could see, okay,

1447
00:35:19,829 --> 00:35:21,719
KnowledgeX still has all this

1448
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:22,289
stuff to do.

1449
00:35:22,449 --> 00:35:23,920
And then they could come tomorrow

1450
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,369
and say, oh, KnowledgeX just

1451
00:35:25,369 --> 00:35:27,320
completed a bunch of tasks, right?

1452
00:35:27,369 --> 00:35:28,469
And now it looks like we're

1453
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:29,920
actually pretty close to having

1454
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,840
campaigns started.

1455
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:33,800
And all this will be discussed.

1456
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,239
So like on the onboarding call,

1457
00:35:35,329 --> 00:35:36,929
the onboarding call is really

1458
00:35:36,929 --> 00:35:38,840
simple because all I do is I share

1459
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,809
my screen and I just share what

1460
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:41,000
you're

1461
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:42,039
seeing here, the screen I'm

1462
00:35:42,039 --> 00:35:43,179
currently sharing, which is the

1463
00:35:43,179 --> 00:35:43,789
Trello board.

1464
00:35:43,889 --> 00:35:45,840
And it's just a logical way to

1465
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,349
walk through exactly what they

1466
00:35:47,349 --> 00:35:49,239
need to do and what to expect.

1467
00:35:49,289 --> 00:35:51,469
So just to kind of backtrack, I'll

1468
00:35:51,469 --> 00:35:53,480
explain some of this stuff here.

1469
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,820
So general resources,

1470
00:35:54,969 --> 00:35:56,019
you have a signed service

1471
00:35:56,019 --> 00:35:56,679
agreement.

1472
00:35:56,679 --> 00:35:57,980
And what you'll do is you'll

1473
00:35:57,980 --> 00:35:59,480
upload the actual PDF there.

1474
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:01,400
So everyone has access to it.

1475
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,199
And you'll also keep track of when

1476
00:36:03,639 --> 00:36:05,000
that contract was signed and when

1477
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:05,059
the

1478
00:36:05,369 --> 00:36:06,550
first campaign was signed or

1479
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:07,159
started.

1480
00:36:07,159 --> 00:36:09,400
So you know when to invoice them,

1481
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,360
like what day of the month

1482
00:36:10,409 --> 00:36:12,280
to invoice them each month.

1483
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,949
We have a link to the Slack

1484
00:36:13,949 --> 00:36:14,920
workspace.

1485
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:17,360
So this sometimes happens when

1486
00:36:17,449 --> 00:36:19,219
we'll invite, obviously in the

1487
00:36:19,219 --> 00:36:22,070
onboarding email we send, there's

1488
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:23,280
a link to join Slack, but

1489
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:23,880
sometimes

1490
00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:26,280
the client will say, Hey, you

1491
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,130
know, we just hired this other

1492
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:29,960
person or my partner after seeing

1493
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:30,019
how

1494
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:31,530
this relationship has been going

1495
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:32,679
wants to join the Slack.

1496
00:36:32,679 --> 00:36:34,920
So they always have a link to join

1497
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:35,320
the Slack

1498
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:36,920
workspace right on the Trello

1499
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,530
board anytime they need to add

1500
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:39,050
someone.

1501
00:36:39,289 --> 00:36:41,239
So that's, you know, convenient.

1502
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:43,340
There's a Dropbox folder, which we

1503
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:44,469
talked about.

1504
00:36:44,469 --> 00:36:47,639
And then we have credentials.

1505
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:48,840
So basically we set

1506
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:49,989
up a cold email account.

1507
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:51,539
We ask for the LinkedIn account

1508
00:36:51,539 --> 00:36:52,639
credentials through their

1509
00:36:53,019 --> 00:36:53,800
onboarding form.

1510
00:36:53,849 --> 00:36:55,550
We set up a Skylite account and

1511
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:57,300
then we ask for their Calendly

1512
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,920
credentials through the onboarding

1513
00:36:59,010 --> 00:36:59,219
form.

1514
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:00,409
And then if they don't have it,

1515
00:37:00,409 --> 00:37:01,159
we'll set it up.

1516
00:37:01,159 --> 00:37:02,599
But basically the credentials are

1517
00:37:02,599 --> 00:37:03,320
all there.

1518
00:37:03,409 --> 00:37:05,489
And the clients especially love

1519
00:37:05,489 --> 00:37:07,949
this because it's transparency.

1520
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,239
We're giving them credentials

1521
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,889
to all the different tools we're

1522
00:37:10,889 --> 00:37:12,679
using to perform our services.

1523
00:37:12,679 --> 00:37:14,519
So even though the client will

1524
00:37:14,849 --> 00:37:16,300
probably never log into the cold

1525
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,010
email account or never log into

1526
00:37:18,010 --> 00:37:20,090
Skylite, they at least have access

1527
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:21,750
and they know they have access,

1528
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:23,380
which gives them peace of mind to

1529
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,920
say, Hey, we're not doing anything

1530
00:37:25,139 --> 00:37:25,480
fishy.

1531
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,250
Like everything we're doing is

1532
00:37:27,429 --> 00:37:29,110
transparent and right there in

1533
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:30,900
front of you to review, ask

1534
00:37:31,010 --> 00:37:31,400
questions

1535
00:37:31,619 --> 00:37:33,320
about, give feedback on, and

1536
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,460
clients really love that about our

1537
00:37:35,579 --> 00:37:36,280
process.

1538
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,719
So I'd recommend, you know,

1539
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:39,889
implementing something similar if

1540
00:37:39,889 --> 00:37:42,039
that's something you want to do.

1541
00:37:42,039 --> 00:37:44,679
And then, so we already talked

1542
00:37:44,889 --> 00:37:46,269
about educational resources

1543
00:37:46,269 --> 00:37:48,030
basically being just SOPs for the

1544
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:49,639
actual client on what to do now

1545
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:49,800
that

1546
00:37:49,889 --> 00:37:51,179
they're our client and then the

1547
00:37:51,179 --> 00:37:52,760
to-do list and completed tasks.

1548
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:53,590
So the last thing is campaign

1549
00:37:54,309 --> 00:37:55,000
resources.

1550
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,440
This again is super specific to

1551
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,590
our agency.

1552
00:37:58,599 --> 00:38:01,650
Our agency is a lead generation

1553
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:02,280
agency where

1554
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,780
we're scheduling calls for our

1555
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:04,360
client.

1556
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:06,849
So campaign resources could be

1557
00:38:06,849 --> 00:38:09,239
whatever makes sense for you

1558
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:10,860
depending on the services you're

1559
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:11,500
offering.

1560
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:12,940
But that first card and another

1561
00:38:12,989 --> 00:38:14,039
card down here could

1562
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:14,940
be the same for you.

1563
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:15,989
So the first one is client

1564
00:38:15,989 --> 00:38:17,289
onboarding form responses.

1565
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,760
So as soon as you get

1566
00:38:18,849 --> 00:38:20,340
that onboarding form filled out by

1567
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:21,920
the client, whether it be through

1568
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,480
Google forms or type form or

1569
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:23,730
something

1570
00:38:23,889 --> 00:38:25,460
you have on your website, you want

1571
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:26,780
to have the onboarding form

1572
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:28,119
responses available here.

1573
00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:28,280
The

1574
00:38:28,610 --> 00:38:30,599
reason I like using Google forms

1575
00:38:30,849 --> 00:38:32,760
is because I could download it as

1576
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,909
a PDF and just upload it here to

1577
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:36,320
this card, which makes it really

1578
00:38:36,579 --> 00:38:38,630
easy for everyone to refer back to

1579
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:40,659
the questions and answers that the

1580
00:38:40,659 --> 00:38:41,719
client filled out.

1581
00:38:41,769 --> 00:38:43,289
And our onboarding form responses,

1582
00:38:43,289 --> 00:38:44,829
again, there's going to be another

1583
00:38:44,829 --> 00:38:46,119
video on this, explaining it

1584
00:38:46,210 --> 00:38:46,420
further.

1585
00:38:46,489 --> 00:38:49,349
But our onboarding form responses,

1586
00:38:49,349 --> 00:38:51,639
we always refer back to those

1587
00:38:51,639 --> 00:38:53,000
because there's

1588
00:38:53,090 --> 00:38:54,670
all the information we'll ever

1589
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:56,090
need to know to perform our

1590
00:38:56,090 --> 00:38:56,699
services.

1591
00:38:56,699 --> 00:38:58,570
So that's why it's like at the

1592
00:38:58,699 --> 00:38:58,920
very

1593
00:38:59,010 --> 00:38:59,320
top.

1594
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:01,250
And then there's another card down

1595
00:39:01,429 --> 00:39:02,619
here called any additional

1596
00:39:03,099 --> 00:39:03,800
resources.

1597
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,159
So we use this card like

1598
00:39:05,369 --> 00:39:06,820
this is for the client.

1599
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:10,130
Anytime they have, uh, like case

1600
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:11,880
studies or new information that

1601
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:12,440
they want us

1602
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:15,690
to include, um, in, in like their

1603
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:18,599
campaigns or use to perform our

1604
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:19,880
services.

1605
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:20,840
Cause obviously when they

1606
00:39:20,929 --> 00:39:21,989
fill up that onboarding form,

1607
00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:23,099
they're still writing their

1608
00:39:23,099 --> 00:39:23,590
business.

1609
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:24,900
So they might create a new case

1610
00:39:25,019 --> 00:39:25,239
study

1611
00:39:25,289 --> 00:39:26,909
or get a new video testimonial

1612
00:39:26,909 --> 00:39:28,659
from a client, something that

1613
00:39:28,659 --> 00:39:30,119
might help us to get better

1614
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:30,519
results

1615
00:39:30,610 --> 00:39:31,610
with our services.

1616
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:33,239
That's what this card is for.

1617
00:39:33,239 --> 00:39:34,679
If they have like a customer list,

1618
00:39:34,769 --> 00:39:36,190
they want to exclude whatever it

1619
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:37,429
might be, any additional

1620
00:39:37,429 --> 00:39:38,369
resources, really

1621
00:39:38,429 --> 00:39:39,719
self-explainable.

1622
00:39:39,809 --> 00:39:42,050
It's helpful to have both these,

1623
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:44,349
uh, like cards or places to have

1624
00:39:44,349 --> 00:39:45,000
both of these,

1625
00:39:45,090 --> 00:39:46,820
the onboarding form responses, and

1626
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:48,239
then a card for the client to

1627
00:39:48,239 --> 00:39:49,800
continue to provide you with any

1628
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:51,260
additional resources.

1629
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:52,840
And again, this card you'll

1630
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,360
explain to the client on the

1631
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,639
onboarding call

1632
00:39:55,730 --> 00:39:56,789
what it's used for.

1633
00:39:56,929 --> 00:39:58,440
So they know like, Oh, I have

1634
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:00,199
this, this testimonial.

1635
00:40:00,199 --> 00:40:01,159
Should I email it to

1636
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:01,489
them?

1637
00:40:01,530 --> 00:40:02,599
Should I send it to Slack?

1638
00:40:02,599 --> 00:40:04,530
No, you should upload it to this

1639
00:40:04,530 --> 00:40:05,789
card here in Trello.

1640
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:07,239
Okay.

1641
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:10,409
Um, so it's just training the

1642
00:40:10,409 --> 00:40:11,760
client on how to be an active

1643
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:12,679
participant in the working

1644
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:13,239
relationship.

1645
00:40:13,239 --> 00:40:15,539
Other than that, we have a leads

1646
00:40:15,539 --> 00:40:17,239
list tracker spreadsheet.

1647
00:40:17,239 --> 00:40:18,269
So that's like, again,

1648
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:20,150
specific to our services.

1649
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:22,050
And then we have our scripts for

1650
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:23,239
our campaigns.

1651
00:40:23,239 --> 00:40:24,519
So the client at any

1652
00:40:24,610 --> 00:40:26,179
time can access the leads list and

1653
00:40:26,179 --> 00:40:27,719
they could see what the scripts

1654
00:40:27,719 --> 00:40:29,079
are that we're sending.

1655
00:40:29,079 --> 00:40:29,489
And again,

1656
00:40:29,650 --> 00:40:31,480
for transparency purposes, they

1657
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,199
love this.

1658
00:40:32,199 --> 00:40:34,199
Like they get to see everything

1659
00:40:34,199 --> 00:40:35,400
that we're using and

1660
00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:36,789
everything that we're doing.

1661
00:40:36,789 --> 00:40:38,199
Like there's nothing happening

1662
00:40:38,199 --> 00:40:39,409
behind the scenes that that

1663
00:40:39,579 --> 00:40:40,030
they're not

1664
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:41,789
aware of and that they didn't sign

1665
00:40:41,789 --> 00:40:43,730
off on, or they're not okay with.

1666
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,159
Um, other than that,

1667
00:40:45,199 --> 00:40:46,309
we have a sales appointment

1668
00:40:46,449 --> 00:40:47,239
feedback form.

1669
00:40:47,239 --> 00:40:49,110
So basically again, our service is

1670
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:50,039
lead generation

1671
00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:52,679
and we're getting clients on

1672
00:40:52,679 --> 00:40:55,159
calls, uh, or on sales calls.

1673
00:40:55,159 --> 00:40:58,340
So we collect feedback after every

1674
00:40:58,650 --> 00:40:59,099
sales call.

1675
00:40:59,099 --> 00:41:00,519
And we just have that, uh, as a

1676
00:41:00,519 --> 00:41:01,639
card here in Trello.

1677
00:41:01,639 --> 00:41:03,400
And again, with like a lot of the

1678
00:41:03,719 --> 00:41:05,039
things we do, we have the form

1679
00:41:05,039 --> 00:41:07,190
here in Google, and I'll just open

1680
00:41:07,579 --> 00:41:09,880
this in case you're interested in

1681
00:41:10,099 --> 00:41:11,440
seeing, because I think having a

1682
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,059
feedback loop, regardless of the

1683
00:41:13,059 --> 00:41:14,360
agency you're running is

1684
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:14,760
important.

1685
00:41:14,809 --> 00:41:16,380
So we have a feedback loop with

1686
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:17,090
our clients.

1687
00:41:17,269 --> 00:41:18,440
Every time they get on a sales

1688
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:18,920
appointment,

1689
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:20,019
they fill out this form.

1690
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:21,250
They tell us their email, they

1691
00:41:21,429 --> 00:41:22,599
tell us the name of the prospect

1692
00:41:22,599 --> 00:41:22,840
they're

1693
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:24,300
providing feedback on.

1694
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:25,690
We ask if the client or the

1695
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:27,500
prospect showed up, we ask them to

1696
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:27,960
score the

1697
00:41:28,179 --> 00:41:29,329
quality of the appointment with

1698
00:41:29,329 --> 00:41:30,780
the prospect, and then tell us the

1699
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:32,360
detailed reasoning for the score

1700
00:41:32,449 --> 00:41:34,039
and anything else we might need to

1701
00:41:34,039 --> 00:41:35,559
know to make improvements.

1702
00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:37,719
So even though you don't run,

1703
00:41:37,769 --> 00:41:39,239
or you might not run elite

1704
00:41:39,239 --> 00:41:40,619
generation agency or a

1705
00:41:40,619 --> 00:41:42,519
pay-per-call agency like I do,

1706
00:41:43,650 --> 00:41:45,500
use something similar where you

1707
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,230
could create a feedback loop

1708
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:49,719
behind, uh, a feedback loop

1709
00:41:49,719 --> 00:41:50,039
between

1710
00:41:50,130 --> 00:41:51,750
you and your client so that they

1711
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:53,579
can be an active participant in

1712
00:41:53,579 --> 00:41:55,239
the relationship.

1713
00:41:55,239 --> 00:41:56,280
Otherwise,

1714
00:41:56,369 --> 00:41:57,429
they're going to feel left out.

1715
00:41:57,570 --> 00:41:59,079
This has been one of the best

1716
00:41:59,079 --> 00:42:00,679
things we ever implemented

1717
00:42:01,010 --> 00:42:02,489
because we're not just so that

1718
00:42:02,489 --> 00:42:04,190
they could feel involved, but

1719
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:05,559
because we actually value our

1720
00:42:05,559 --> 00:42:05,880
client's

1721
00:42:06,199 --> 00:42:06,449
feedback.

1722
00:42:06,449 --> 00:42:07,849
They could tell us whether or not

1723
00:42:07,849 --> 00:42:09,320
a sales appointment is valuable

1724
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:10,440
and we can learn from

1725
00:42:10,650 --> 00:42:12,460
that and adjust our targeting or

1726
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:14,570
just our scripting or whatever, or

1727
00:42:14,619 --> 00:42:16,150
our qualification process like

1728
00:42:16,219 --> 00:42:16,429
this

1729
00:42:16,769 --> 00:42:18,269
is valuable feedback.

1730
00:42:18,269 --> 00:42:20,760
So again, a reoccurring theme here

1731
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:24,679
is that the clients, if you can

1732
00:42:24,679 --> 00:42:25,400
get them to be

1733
00:42:25,449 --> 00:42:27,239
an active participant in the

1734
00:42:27,239 --> 00:42:29,860
working relationship, the chances

1735
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:31,820
that you have success with that

1736
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:32,199
client

1737
00:42:32,289 --> 00:42:34,199
skyrockets, I promise you.

1738
00:42:34,199 --> 00:42:36,920
I've seen it happen time and time

1739
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:37,480
again.

1740
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:38,679
We've had clients that have

1741
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:40,289
so much potential and we, we

1742
00:42:40,289 --> 00:42:42,059
showcase that potential and we

1743
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:43,639
show it to the client and they're

1744
00:42:43,639 --> 00:42:44,199
just not

1745
00:42:44,519 --> 00:42:44,760
engaging.

1746
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:45,820
They're not involved.

1747
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:46,929
They're not available for

1748
00:42:46,929 --> 00:42:47,530
questions.

1749
00:42:47,539 --> 00:42:49,079
They're not available to get on a

1750
00:42:49,079 --> 00:42:49,320
quick

1751
00:42:49,409 --> 00:42:49,610
call.

1752
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:50,619
They're not filling out the

1753
00:42:50,619 --> 00:42:51,320
feedback form.

1754
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:53,880
Those relationships don't last.

1755
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:55,000
They just don't

1756
00:42:55,090 --> 00:42:55,300
last.

1757
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:57,159
That's the reality of it.

1758
00:42:57,159 --> 00:42:59,159
So by putting these systems in

1759
00:42:59,179 --> 00:43:01,250
place day one, right after someone

1760
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:01,639
signs

1761
00:43:01,849 --> 00:43:03,719
your service agreement, you're

1762
00:43:03,719 --> 00:43:06,889
putting good standards in place

1763
00:43:06,889 --> 00:43:08,599
and expectations in place that

1764
00:43:08,599 --> 00:43:09,320
will carry

1765
00:43:09,650 --> 00:43:10,829
throughout the relationship.

1766
00:43:10,829 --> 00:43:12,360
And I already admitted, we've had

1767
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:14,280
clients that just aren't active.

1768
00:43:14,429 --> 00:43:15,239
And we do all

1769
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:17,469
this stuff the same way we do with

1770
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:19,719
any other client that we sign on

1771
00:43:19,719 --> 00:43:21,000
and they're still not active for

1772
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:21,809
whatever reason.

1773
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:23,119
So it's not a hundred percent

1774
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:23,849
success rate.

1775
00:43:23,849 --> 00:43:24,969
We can't always control other

1776
00:43:25,179 --> 00:43:25,559
people,

1777
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:28,280
but this is everything we can do

1778
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:30,530
in our control to help the

1779
00:43:30,659 --> 00:43:32,519
situation, at least from my

1780
00:43:32,519 --> 00:43:33,000
understanding.

1781
00:43:33,050 --> 00:43:34,599
Oh, and just to touch back on

1782
00:43:34,599 --> 00:43:37,239
this, we have the feedback form.

1783
00:43:37,239 --> 00:43:38,579
And then again, I have a loom

1784
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:39,159
video.

1785
00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:41,699
So loom is super important to, as

1786
00:43:41,699 --> 00:43:43,659
an agency, because you could just

1787
00:43:43,659 --> 00:43:44,519
record SOPs.

1788
00:43:44,610 --> 00:43:46,550
So I have an SOP here where I'm

1789
00:43:46,550 --> 00:43:49,179
recording myself explaining the

1790
00:43:49,179 --> 00:43:50,760
feedback form so that they know,

1791
00:43:50,809 --> 00:43:51,889
like, what is this actually used

1792
00:43:51,889 --> 00:43:52,199
for?

1793
00:43:52,199 --> 00:43:53,000
Why does it matter?

1794
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,159
Why should they invest their time

1795
00:43:55,250 --> 00:43:57,030
into filling out the feedback form

1796
00:43:57,030 --> 00:43:58,719
every single day or anytime they

1797
00:43:58,719 --> 00:43:59,730
get on a sales call?

1798
00:43:59,730 --> 00:43:59,960
Because

1799
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,480
it's still, it's a time investment

1800
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:02,039
for them.

1801
00:44:02,039 --> 00:44:04,610
So I'm explaining how it's used

1802
00:44:04,610 --> 00:44:06,199
and why it's important

1803
00:44:06,289 --> 00:44:07,690
and making sure that there's no

1804
00:44:07,690 --> 00:44:09,010
questions or that all their

1805
00:44:09,019 --> 00:44:11,000
questions are answered more

1806
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,119
specifically.

1807
00:44:12,469 --> 00:44:16,840
So I think I covered everything

1808
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:17,690
here in this video.

1809
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:19,860
And man, I gotta, I gotta be

1810
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:20,920
careful.

1811
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:21,550
I've been doing

1812
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:23,480
videos for this program and a lot

1813
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:25,599
of them are going like close to an

1814
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:28,360
hour on end without stopping and

1815
00:44:28,409 --> 00:44:29,510
And I might lose my voice.

1816
00:44:29,650 --> 00:44:32,900
So I gotta be really careful, uh,

1817
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:33,719
with this stuff.

1818
00:44:33,719 --> 00:44:34,280
But anyways,

1819
00:44:34,599 --> 00:44:37,070
with all that being said, just to

1820
00:44:37,070 --> 00:44:40,119
recap, it's again, so important to

1821
00:44:40,119 --> 00:44:41,639
properly communicate with

1822
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:43,960
your clients and to also set

1823
00:44:44,150 --> 00:44:46,309
expectations and answer any

1824
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:48,519
questions that are looming in

1825
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:48,639
their

1826
00:44:48,889 --> 00:44:50,119
brain as soon as they sign the

1827
00:44:50,119 --> 00:44:50,780
contract.

1828
00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:52,869
Once they sign the contract, that

1829
00:44:52,869 --> 00:44:54,250
is like basically the race

1830
00:44:54,570 --> 00:44:54,840
begins.

1831
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:56,360
You, you hit start.

1832
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:57,579
You're the game started.

1833
00:44:57,579 --> 00:44:58,059
You're in.

1834
00:44:58,059 --> 00:44:58,840
That's it.

1835
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:00,599
It's go time.

1836
00:45:00,690 --> 00:45:02,760
And once they sign the contract,

1837
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:04,329
you want to have systems and

1838
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:07,000
processes in place to follow

1839
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:07,480
without

1840
00:45:07,570 --> 00:45:07,710
question.

1841
00:45:07,829 --> 00:45:09,710
Like mindlessly, anyone can follow

1842
00:45:09,710 --> 00:45:10,199
this.

1843
00:45:10,199 --> 00:45:12,110
It's like an instruction manual

1844
00:45:12,119 --> 00:45:12,920
where you go into

1845
00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:14,809
Trello or you go into Notion and

1846
00:45:14,809 --> 00:45:16,610
you copy a project management

1847
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:18,489
board and you know exactly the

1848
00:45:18,619 --> 00:45:18,840
steps

1849
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:20,579
that have to take place to get

1850
00:45:20,579 --> 00:45:22,039
this client signed.

1851
00:45:22,039 --> 00:45:24,550
And basically the steps that we

1852
00:45:24,619 --> 00:45:25,320
took was

1853
00:45:25,650 --> 00:45:27,570
setting up a Trello board, getting

1854
00:45:27,570 --> 00:45:29,019
the signed service agreement

1855
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:32,199
uploaded to Trello, um, saying

1856
00:45:32,199 --> 00:45:32,599
what,

1857
00:45:32,690 --> 00:45:34,389
when the signed service agreement

1858
00:45:34,389 --> 00:45:36,110
was signed and including the date

1859
00:45:36,110 --> 00:45:38,119
in that card, sending an invoice,

1860
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:39,269
waiting for the client to pay the

1861
00:45:39,409 --> 00:45:40,639
invoice, setting up the Trello

1862
00:45:40,639 --> 00:45:41,820
board, inviting all the people

1863
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:42,360
that

1864
00:45:42,449 --> 00:45:44,090
need to be invited to the Trello

1865
00:45:44,090 --> 00:45:45,610
board, setting up a Dropbox

1866
00:45:45,679 --> 00:45:48,610
folder, setting up Slack channels,

1867
00:45:48,739 --> 00:45:49,360
uh,

1868
00:45:49,619 --> 00:45:51,219
adding different things to some of

1869
00:45:51,219 --> 00:45:53,090
our internal processes that aren't

1870
00:45:53,090 --> 00:45:54,969
really worth explaining because

1871
00:45:55,289 --> 00:45:56,699
again, it's, it's very, very

1872
00:45:56,699 --> 00:45:58,079
specific to the way we do our

1873
00:45:58,079 --> 00:45:58,760
business.

1874
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:01,480
But again, like think in terms of

1875
00:46:01,690 --> 00:46:02,980
what do I have to do that is

1876
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:04,739
similar to what KnowledgeX is

1877
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:05,719
doing here?

1878
00:46:05,719 --> 00:46:06,920
What do I have to do that's

1879
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:08,070
similar to what KnowledgeX is

1880
00:46:08,210 --> 00:46:08,769
doing here?

1881
00:46:08,769 --> 00:46:10,170
Like, do I have to assign someone

1882
00:46:10,170 --> 00:46:11,320
to this account?

1883
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:12,840
Do I have a project manager?

1884
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:14,440
Do I have an account manager?

1885
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:16,039
Do I have inbox managers that I

1886
00:46:16,039 --> 00:46:16,289
have to

1887
00:46:16,570 --> 00:46:17,480
assign to new clients?

1888
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:19,610
If so, replace what you're doing

1889
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:21,820
with what we're saying here.

1890
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:22,590
Um, and then

1891
00:46:22,690 --> 00:46:24,239
send an onboarding for email.

1892
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:25,820
And that onboarding email is,

1893
00:46:25,820 --> 00:46:27,909
should be sent again, the same

1894
00:46:27,909 --> 00:46:28,280
day,

1895
00:46:28,369 --> 00:46:30,019
for sure, the same day that the

1896
00:46:30,019 --> 00:46:31,980
client signs the contract so that

1897
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:34,920
they get the sense it's automated

1898
00:46:35,010 --> 00:46:37,130
for how fast the turnaround is.

1899
00:46:37,130 --> 00:46:39,099
And if you do it like that, and

1900
00:46:39,099 --> 00:46:40,489
you include all this information

1901
00:46:40,619 --> 00:46:40,760
that

1902
00:46:40,849 --> 00:46:42,440
you're seeing here, you let them

1903
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:44,000
know that you can't start until

1904
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,159
the setup fees paid.

1905
00:46:45,159 --> 00:46:45,880
You let them know

1906
00:46:45,929 --> 00:46:47,030
all the steps that you need them

1907
00:46:47,170 --> 00:46:48,449
to take to make this relationship

1908
00:46:48,449 --> 00:46:49,480
a smashing success.

1909
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:51,559
I guarantee you,

1910
00:46:51,610 --> 00:46:53,269
if you start here with these

1911
00:46:53,269 --> 00:46:55,260
processes, not only is your agency

1912
00:46:55,739 --> 00:46:57,400
going to run a lot more smoothly

1913
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:57,550
and

1914
00:46:57,610 --> 00:46:59,369
be a lot more organized, but your

1915
00:46:59,369 --> 00:47:01,190
clients are really going to see it

1916
00:47:01,190 --> 00:47:03,599
and appreciate it and be retained

1917
00:47:03,650 --> 00:47:03,719
a

1918
00:47:03,809 --> 00:47:05,079
lot longer because of it.

1919
00:47:05,079 --> 00:47:07,309
It's just really simple stuff,

1920
00:47:07,309 --> 00:47:07,960
guys.

1921
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:09,880
It's, it's, it's also necessary.

1922
00:47:09,969 --> 00:47:11,699
Like, I would rather have this in

1923
00:47:11,699 --> 00:47:13,570
place than running an agency where

1924
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:14,679
I sign a client and I

1925
00:47:14,889 --> 00:47:16,489
just am kind of going off of my

1926
00:47:16,489 --> 00:47:18,670
memory of, Oh, what do I do now?

1927
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:20,039
Because even for you, like,

1928
00:47:20,130 --> 00:47:21,480
this is serving you as much as it

1929
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:22,269
is the client.

1930
00:47:22,269 --> 00:47:23,650
Like, what do you do when a new

1931
00:47:23,650 --> 00:47:24,599
client signed?

1932
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:25,130
Right?

1933
00:47:25,130 --> 00:47:26,769
Like, it's not always an easy

1934
00:47:26,769 --> 00:47:27,369
answer.

1935
00:47:27,369 --> 00:47:29,309
And sometimes you'll forget, but

1936
00:47:29,309 --> 00:47:30,170
if you have it all

1937
00:47:30,550 --> 00:47:32,519
documented, this is like creating

1938
00:47:32,530 --> 00:47:33,130
an SOP.

1939
00:47:33,130 --> 00:47:35,159
And also the best thing you could

1940
00:47:35,309 --> 00:47:36,190
ever do for client

1941
00:47:36,610 --> 00:47:37,789
retention all in one video.

1942
00:47:37,789 --> 00:47:39,099
Like this could be the most

1943
00:47:39,099 --> 00:47:41,159
valuable video that I create in

1944
00:47:41,159 --> 00:47:41,849
this entire

1945
00:47:42,230 --> 00:47:42,690
program.

1946
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:45,019
And I hope you agree, or at least

1947
00:47:45,019 --> 00:47:47,400
we'll consider it because I think

1948
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:48,519
this is like,

1949
00:47:48,739 --> 00:47:50,760
again, just from our experience,

1950
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:52,920
we get complimented on this stuff

1951
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:54,760
more than anything else in our

1952
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:55,239
agency.

1953
00:47:55,329 --> 00:47:56,940
And it's consistent and it's

1954
00:47:56,940 --> 00:47:58,969
really meaningful compliments.

1955
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:00,039
Like, wow.

1956
00:48:00,039 --> 00:48:01,239
And from big companies,

1957
00:48:01,329 --> 00:48:03,289
like fortune 500 companies saying,

1958
00:48:03,289 --> 00:48:04,829
wow, like we really need to brush

1959
00:48:04,829 --> 00:48:06,199
up our onboarding process.

1960
00:48:06,289 --> 00:48:06,840
This is great.

1961
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:07,639
Or wow.

1962
00:48:07,639 --> 00:48:09,110
You give me a bunch of ideas on

1963
00:48:09,110 --> 00:48:10,599
how I can make my onboarding

1964
00:48:10,599 --> 00:48:11,400
process or my

1965
00:48:11,750 --> 00:48:13,320
business run a lot smoother or

1966
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:15,000
more professionally.

1967
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,960
So I'm, we just gave you the, the,

1968
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:18,679
we just gave you

1969
00:48:18,719 --> 00:48:19,130
it all.

1970
00:48:19,130 --> 00:48:20,619
I just showed you exactly how we

1971
00:48:20,619 --> 00:48:21,900
get those compliments.

1972
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:24,199
And again, the biggest thing that

1973
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:26,519
what I'll end this video with is

1974
00:48:26,710 --> 00:48:29,170
make it unique to your business.

1975
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:31,639
Copying everything you're seeing

1976
00:48:31,730 --> 00:48:33,239
here is not going to do you any

1977
00:48:33,239 --> 00:48:33,710
good.

1978
00:48:33,710 --> 00:48:35,340
It might in the short term, it

1979
00:48:35,349 --> 00:48:36,920
might look good for a little

1980
00:48:37,139 --> 00:48:38,789
while, but like with anything

1981
00:48:38,789 --> 00:48:40,619
that's copied without a complete

1982
00:48:40,789 --> 00:48:42,440
and full understanding of

1983
00:48:42,530 --> 00:48:44,260
the reasonings behind it and the

1984
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:45,920
foundations and why it actually

1985
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:46,239
works.

1986
00:48:46,239 --> 00:48:47,400
If you can't answer those

1987
00:48:47,829 --> 00:48:49,289
questions and answer why, why,

1988
00:48:49,289 --> 00:48:50,730
why, how is this unique?

1989
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:51,929
How is this unique?

1990
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:53,000
How is this unique?

1991
00:48:53,219 --> 00:48:55,619
Your business, your agency, it's

1992
00:48:55,619 --> 00:48:57,010
going to crumble.

1993
00:48:57,179 --> 00:48:59,880
It's going to not be sustainable.

1994
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:00,360
So again,

1995
00:49:00,449 --> 00:49:02,690
by actually investing the time,

1996
00:49:02,869 --> 00:49:05,170
actually doing things with your

1997
00:49:05,170 --> 00:49:09,159
unique spin, come on, like that's

1998
00:49:09,159 --> 00:49:09,480
all it

1999
00:49:09,690 --> 00:49:09,969
takes.

2000
00:49:09,969 --> 00:49:11,380
It's really that simple.

2001
00:49:11,380 --> 00:49:12,909
And you'll have a sustainable

2002
00:49:12,909 --> 00:49:14,920
skillset and a sustainable

2003
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:15,469
business.

2004
00:49:15,570 --> 00:49:17,269
And again, I want you not only to

2005
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:19,039
just scale your agency to where

2006
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:20,360
you want to scale it,

2007
00:49:20,449 --> 00:49:22,110
but throughout this process, one

2008
00:49:22,110 --> 00:49:23,800
of my proudest achievements.

2009
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:25,800
And one thing I'm super excited

2010
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:28,130
about is I'm 21 years old.

2011
00:49:28,309 --> 00:49:30,659
I'm not even a year into my agency

2012
00:49:30,659 --> 00:49:31,719
business.

2013
00:49:31,719 --> 00:49:33,400
And even though the agency

2014
00:49:33,750 --> 00:49:35,400
business is super successful, I

2015
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:37,130
know that everything that I've

2016
00:49:37,579 --> 00:49:39,559
learned from building this agency,

2017
00:49:39,889 --> 00:49:44,440
if this agency goes to zero

2018
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:45,039
tomorrow, I have all the skill

2019
00:49:45,039 --> 00:49:47,269
sets and the know how to basically

2020
00:49:47,699 --> 00:49:48,280
do it all

2021
00:49:48,369 --> 00:49:49,789
over again or start another

2022
00:49:49,789 --> 00:49:51,760
business or have success somewhere

2023
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:52,079
else.

2024
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:54,260
And I hope that after you go

2025
00:49:54,369 --> 00:49:54,519
through

2026
00:49:54,610 --> 00:49:55,929
this program, regardless of where

2027
00:49:55,929 --> 00:49:57,670
your agency is, obviously our one

2028
00:49:57,670 --> 00:49:59,239
goal is to get you to where you

2029
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:00,789
want it to be and where you want

2030
00:50:00,789 --> 00:50:01,530
to get it to.

2031
00:50:01,530 --> 00:50:02,969
But in addition to that, I want

2032
00:50:03,110 --> 00:50:04,119
you to feel super

2033
00:50:04,469 --> 00:50:05,820
confident knowing that if your

2034
00:50:05,820 --> 00:50:07,179
agency goes to zero or for

2035
00:50:07,179 --> 00:50:09,000
whatever reason you want to stop

2036
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:09,400
doing your

2037
00:50:09,719 --> 00:50:11,190
agency, you have the skill sets

2038
00:50:11,199 --> 00:50:12,469
and the know how and the

2039
00:50:12,469 --> 00:50:15,559
foundation to build on great new

2040
00:50:15,559 --> 00:50:16,119
businesses.

2041
00:50:16,210 --> 00:50:17,719
And that's really it.

2042
00:50:17,719 --> 00:50:19,219
So thank you so much for taking

2043
00:50:19,219 --> 00:50:20,840
the time to watch this video all

2044
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:21,690
the way through.

2045
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:23,429
I know a lot of this stuff is

2046
00:50:23,429 --> 00:50:24,320
super long.

2047
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:26,340
And for a lot of you, this might

2048
00:50:26,340 --> 00:50:28,800
just be basic and repeating

2049
00:50:28,929 --> 00:50:29,980
what you already have set up or

2050
00:50:29,980 --> 00:50:31,000
what you already know.

2051
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,639
So if you, if that's you and you,

2052
00:50:33,639 --> 00:50:34,280
you hung on

2053
00:50:34,489 --> 00:50:35,739
until the very end, I really do

2054
00:50:35,739 --> 00:50:36,590
appreciate it.

2055
00:50:36,590 --> 00:50:38,119
And yeah, I'm looking forward to

2056
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:39,239
hearing your feedback

2057
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:41,230
on this one because man, my voice

2058
00:50:41,230 --> 00:50:42,860
is like fading away.

2059
00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:44,679
I don't know if you noticed

2060
00:50:44,679 --> 00:50:45,230
towards the end

2061
00:50:45,289 --> 00:50:46,989
of the video, but it's really

2062
00:50:46,989 --> 00:50:48,179
starting to fade.

2063
00:50:48,179 --> 00:50:49,860
So I'm going to hang up now and

2064
00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:50,760
just wait to hear

2065
00:50:51,090 --> 00:50:52,260
feedback from you guys and any

2066
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:53,760
questions that you might have

2067
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:55,719
looking forward to them and happy

2068
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:55,880
to

2069
00:50:56,099 --> 00:50:58,210
help answer them either through

2070
00:50:58,389 --> 00:51:00,489
Slack or on the next coaching

2071
00:51:00,489 --> 00:51:00,920
call.
