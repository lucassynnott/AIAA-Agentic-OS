1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:00,700
Real quick.

2
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:03,439
I'll let more people in as they

3
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:04,240
come.

4
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,380
So I see a lot of new faces today,

5
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:09,199
which is super

6
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:09,910
exciting.

7
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:11,810
And so we'll start with some

8
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:14,189
intros for anyone that's new here.

9
00:00:14,189 --> 00:00:15,880
And then today, usually on

10
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:17,480
these calls, it's really like

11
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:18,920
open-ended Q&A and it's really

12
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,820
like conversational and discussion

13
00:00:20,899 --> 00:00:21,379
based.

14
00:00:21,429 --> 00:00:23,589
But I've been working on sort of

15
00:00:23,589 --> 00:00:25,629
like a masterclass for client

16
00:00:25,629 --> 00:00:27,500
retention, which is really

17
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,250
the topic of conversation people

18
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:30,820
have the most questions on that

19
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:32,359
I'm able to help them with.

20
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:34,060
And so I'll run through that today

21
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:35,770
and there's different phases.

22
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:37,259
Maybe we'll make it through

23
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:38,609
just a few of them and not all of

24
00:00:38,609 --> 00:00:38,990
them.

25
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:40,570
And we'll have a discussion around

26
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:41,039
that.

27
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:42,259
And then hopefully

28
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:44,070
at the end, we'll have some time

29
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:46,060
for questions and whatever else.

30
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:47,509
But I want to get started with

31
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:48,450
intros.

32
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:51,920
We have Oscar, Connor, and Jacob

33
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:52,829
and Avery.

34
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,990
I think all of you are new here to

35
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:57,009
this call

36
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,859
specifically, the operations call

37
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:00,090
every Thursday at noon.

38
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:01,420
So it's great to have you guys

39
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:02,149
here for

40
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,260
whichever one of you wants to give

41
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:05,870
a quick intro to the group.

42
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:07,409
Let us know who you are, what

43
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:07,560
you're

44
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,260
working on.

45
00:01:08,599 --> 00:01:09,900
That'd be a good way to kick it

46
00:01:10,099 --> 00:01:10,359
off.

47
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:13,379
I'll go first.

48
00:01:13,379 --> 00:01:14,459
Hey everyone, I'm Connor.

49
00:01:14,459 --> 00:01:15,650
I just joined Client Ascension

50
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:16,640
yesterday.

51
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:18,400
I run

52
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,959
a marketing and sales ops agency

53
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:23,099
for HubSpot customers.

54
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,239
Nice.

55
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:24,989
Cool, man.

56
00:01:24,989 --> 00:01:26,379
Great to have you here.

57
00:01:26,379 --> 00:01:27,260
Thank you.

58
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:28,939
What's up, everybody?

59
00:01:28,939 --> 00:01:30,060
I'm in the same boat as Connor

60
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:31,219
just joined Client Ascension

61
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:31,939
yesterday.

62
00:01:31,939 --> 00:01:32,450
So really

63
00:01:32,819 --> 00:01:33,950
excited to be here.

64
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:35,670
I do a good old e-commerce email

65
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:37,700
marketing, work with four clients

66
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:38,500
right now.

67
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:39,060
Nice.

68
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:40,799
And really keen to get stuck in

69
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,129
with the live calls and the course

70
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:42,739
content.

71
00:01:42,819 --> 00:01:44,500
Let's go, dude.

72
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,319
I love the email marketing guys.

73
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,980
People ask me if I were to start

74
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:50,209
another agency

75
00:01:50,299 --> 00:01:51,370
from scratch.

76
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:53,239
I always say probably email

77
00:01:53,329 --> 00:01:54,299
marketing.

78
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:56,819
So you're in the right industry.

79
00:01:56,819 --> 00:01:57,799
You have a great

80
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:58,260
offer.

81
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:59,739
And so we're excited to work with

82
00:01:59,739 --> 00:02:00,140
you.

83
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:01,120
Love it.

84
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:01,799
Appreciate it, brother.

85
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:02,510
Of course.

86
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,780
Yeah, I'll go ahead next.

87
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:07,030
Yes, my name's Avery.

88
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:08,750
I joined Client Ascension last

89
00:02:09,099 --> 00:02:09,620
week, Friday,

90
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,288
I believe.

91
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:11,759
I run a software development

92
00:02:12,129 --> 00:02:12,310
agency.

93
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:13,479
Really excited for these

94
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:14,689
operations calls because

95
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:15,500
that's probably our biggest

96
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:16,259
struggle right now.

97
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,199
Solid, dude.

98
00:02:17,469 --> 00:02:19,099
Yeah, we've worked with a lot of

99
00:02:19,099 --> 00:02:21,289
software development, app

100
00:02:21,289 --> 00:02:22,719
development types of

101
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,419
agencies at our lead gen company.

102
00:02:25,419 --> 00:02:27,669
And so I have a pretty good idea

103
00:02:27,669 --> 00:02:29,789
on backend and how to systemize

104
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:30,180
that.

105
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,560
So excited to work with you.

106
00:02:31,979 --> 00:02:32,740
Great to hear.

107
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,030
What got you into that?

108
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:35,550
Were you like, are you a coder

109
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:36,259
yourself or?

110
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:36,960
Yeah.

111
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,659
Yeah.

112
00:02:37,659 --> 00:02:40,379
So I've been a software engineer

113
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:42,689
for past five years, working at a

114
00:02:42,689 --> 00:02:43,330
tech company.

115
00:02:43,419 --> 00:02:45,169
And then when COVID hit, I just

116
00:02:45,539 --> 00:02:47,159
started doing some freelance dev

117
00:02:47,169 --> 00:02:48,370
work for clients.

118
00:02:48,889 --> 00:02:50,030
And then as I got

119
00:02:50,219 --> 00:02:52,000
more people to work for, I got

120
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,740
some devs under me and kind of

121
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:55,129
grew it from there.

122
00:02:55,129 --> 00:02:56,159
So I've been doing

123
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,270
it for about two years now.

124
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:58,419
And now we've gotten to a point

125
00:02:58,650 --> 00:02:59,539
where we're like an actual

126
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:00,960
full-fledged agency, not just

127
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,159
freelance operation.

128
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,050
That's sick.

129
00:03:03,259 --> 00:03:03,879
Yeah.

130
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:05,099
That's usually the transition

131
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:07,000
everyone goes through.

132
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,259
I've been

133
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,240
just kind of messing around with

134
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:10,879
agencies for four or five years

135
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:11,259
now.

136
00:03:11,259 --> 00:03:12,580
And just the past year,

137
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:14,090
year and a half has really been

138
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:15,590
like, you know, when things

139
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,159
started to come together.

140
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:17,520
So

141
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:18,840
it's cool to hear.

142
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:20,539
Cool.

143
00:03:20,539 --> 00:03:22,199
I think that leaves me here.

144
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:22,909
Yes, sir.

145
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:23,780
All right.

146
00:03:24,139 --> 00:03:24,340
Sorry.

147
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,319
I'm outside with my dog, but I was

148
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:27,960
outside of my cam on.

149
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,090
Yeah.

150
00:03:29,419 --> 00:03:30,099
Great to be

151
00:03:30,219 --> 00:03:30,419
here.

152
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:32,409
Operations is also something I

153
00:03:32,699 --> 00:03:34,000
struggle with the most.

154
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:35,240
I run an e-commerce development

155
00:03:36,099 --> 00:03:36,719
agency.

156
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:39,370
So very similar to you, Avery.

157
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:41,050
Started out as a freelance

158
00:03:42,069 --> 00:03:43,120
designer working with tech

159
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:44,009
companies and just slowly

160
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:45,870
transitioned into e-commerce as

161
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:47,340
that's what most of my clients

162
00:03:47,419 --> 00:03:47,620
were in.

163
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:48,699
Got it.

164
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:49,229
Yeah.

165
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,379
Super stoked for this.

166
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:51,539
Likewise, dude.

167
00:03:51,539 --> 00:03:52,539
Good to have you here.

168
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:53,240
Thanks.

169
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:53,979
Being here.

170
00:03:53,979 --> 00:03:55,449
Real quick, actually, if we could

171
00:03:55,449 --> 00:03:56,819
go back through, we have Oscar,

172
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:58,490
Connor, Avery

173
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,469
and Jacob, you guys mentioned like

174
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:01,889
operations being a really

175
00:04:01,889 --> 00:04:03,550
important reason why you joined

176
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,610
the program.

177
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,300
Like what's one operations problem

178
00:04:07,409 --> 00:04:09,729
or question that you have that we

179
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:10,400
could get

180
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:11,229
started with?

181
00:04:11,469 --> 00:04:12,409
And then I'll go into the

182
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:13,539
presentation I have.

183
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,689
I can, I can just throw one out

184
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:16,420
there.

185
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:19,800
So I, you know, doing creative

186
00:04:19,939 --> 00:04:21,560
work, it's, it's

187
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:23,839
almost like every project is, uh,

188
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:25,819
a new project is not really a ton

189
00:04:25,819 --> 00:04:27,279
of repeatability.

190
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:28,250
Um, so

191
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:30,509
I'd love to learn how to, uh, what

192
00:04:30,509 --> 00:04:32,620
one train people, but also trust

193
00:04:32,829 --> 00:04:34,459
people to do, you know,

194
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:37,240
as good of a job as, as I think I

195
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:37,899
do.

196
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:38,600
Yeah.

197
00:04:38,819 --> 00:04:40,500
Plus one, plus one, plus one.

198
00:04:40,579 --> 00:04:41,720
Yeah, exactly.

199
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,120
Yeah.

200
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,009
Uh, Scott on this call, he's been

201
00:04:45,009 --> 00:04:46,790
in the program for quite a while,

202
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:47,699
uh, and he's

203
00:04:47,779 --> 00:04:49,279
making really big strides.

204
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,980
So he runs a creative agency.

205
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:51,500
So very.

206
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:52,120
Similar.

207
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:53,810
Like every project is unique in a

208
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:55,759
way it's very creative video work.

209
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:56,620
So I think

210
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:58,220
you can learn a lot from what he's

211
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:59,300
done successful.

212
00:04:59,379 --> 00:05:00,029
Yeah.

213
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:01,339
Hit me up.

214
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:02,439
We'll, we'll, we'll, we'll, we'll,

215
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:03,540
we'll, we'll, we'll, we'll, we'll,

216
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:03,920
we'll

217
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,420
write on it.

218
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:04,439
Yeah, we'll do it.

219
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:06,259
Well,

220
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:09,300
solid.

221
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:12,459
Um, Avery, Oscar, Connor, any

222
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,300
specific questions or focus points

223
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,759
when it comes to operations?

224
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,939
Um, pretty similar to Jacob's

225
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,899
point, you know, like we're doing

226
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:21,920
custom app development.

227
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,360
So each,

228
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:23,600
each job is really different.

229
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,680
Um, so I'd be interested in ways

230
00:05:26,889 --> 00:05:28,480
to figure out how we can,

231
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,639
like, I mean, there's no way we

232
00:05:30,689 --> 00:05:32,810
can make them all, um, you know,

233
00:05:33,009 --> 00:05:34,980
repeatable, but as much as

234
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:37,089
we can, like reduce the difference

235
00:05:37,189 --> 00:05:38,699
from project to project.

236
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:40,600
Um, and another question that I

237
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:41,199
had,

238
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,430
I mean, it's, it's sort of vague,

239
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:44,629
I guess, but like, and maybe this

240
00:05:44,629 --> 00:05:46,920
is what you're trying to get

241
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,240
at, but it's like, how do you

242
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,899
start taming an existing ops mess?

243
00:05:49,899 --> 00:05:51,240
Like, do you have suggestions

244
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,420
on, um, ways to kind of like come

245
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,439
up with a list?

246
00:05:54,529 --> 00:05:56,000
Yeah, where do you start?

247
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,449
Yeah, it'll be a phase

248
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,290
five of my presentation today.

249
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:02,009
Uh, so it'll be all the way at the

250
00:06:02,009 --> 00:06:02,319
end.

251
00:06:02,459 --> 00:06:03,560
And if we don't make it to

252
00:06:03,899 --> 00:06:06,060
phase five, there's a full lesson

253
00:06:06,379 --> 00:06:08,149
dedicated to what phase five is in

254
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:10,439
the learning platform that I'll

255
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:10,509
send

256
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,350
you a link to, but yeah, that

257
00:06:12,699 --> 00:06:14,100
phase five will be a good start

258
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:14,730
for you.

259
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:15,629
Sounds good.

260
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:17,279
Great question,

261
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:18,319
by the way.

262
00:06:18,579 --> 00:06:20,449
Um, okay, great.

263
00:06:20,459 --> 00:06:23,759
Oscar, Connor, anything to add?

264
00:06:23,779 --> 00:06:26,579
No, yeah.

265
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:26,910
No.

266
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:27,620
Okay, cool.

267
00:06:27,699 --> 00:06:29,240
Oh, sweet, brother.

268
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:29,860
Sweet.

269
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:31,939
And we have one more new, uh, new

270
00:06:32,149 --> 00:06:33,009
member here.

271
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:34,319
Zach, if you don't mind,

272
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:36,120
uh, this is the first I'm seeing

273
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,629
you on my operations call.

274
00:06:37,629 --> 00:06:39,250
So I always like to give the

275
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:40,019
spotlight to new

276
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,199
members and have them give a quick

277
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:42,819
intro.

278
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:43,439
Great.

279
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:43,819
Hi.

280
00:06:43,819 --> 00:06:45,360
Yeah, I'm brand new.

281
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:46,699
I signed up the day before

282
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:50,600
yesterday and I essentially run a

283
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,870
small shop.

284
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,319
I do coaching and, uh, fractional

285
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,339
work based around,

286
00:06:58,420 --> 00:06:59,910
uh, global sales.

287
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:02,180
So I coach global sales managers

288
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:04,779
and I do fractional global sales

289
00:07:04,779 --> 00:07:06,189
management for

290
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,850
small to medium sized companies

291
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:09,180
that are looking to expand

292
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:09,910
globally.

293
00:07:10,779 --> 00:07:11,589
super exciting.

294
00:07:11,589 --> 00:07:12,410
Awesome, man.

295
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:13,720
Are you at like a conference or

296
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:14,439
something?

297
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:15,779
It looks like I am.

298
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:16,800
I am.

299
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:18,379
I'm at a conference today and I

300
00:07:18,379 --> 00:07:20,040
just took a coffee break to join

301
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:20,660
the call.

302
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,629
Awesome, man.

303
00:07:21,629 --> 00:07:22,420
Thank you so

304
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,699
much for being here.

305
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:25,259
Really appreciate that.

306
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:25,800
Right.

307
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,740
All right, cool.

308
00:07:26,949 --> 00:07:28,939
So, uh, again, for anyone that

309
00:07:28,939 --> 00:07:29,100
just

310
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,870
joined, uh, after the very

311
00:07:31,339 --> 00:07:32,740
beginning, my plan for today's

312
00:07:32,829 --> 00:07:34,850
call is quite different than what

313
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:35,769
I've done in the

314
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:36,339
past.

315
00:07:36,379 --> 00:07:38,660
Usually these calls are more so

316
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:40,990
like open question, uh, Q and a

317
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:42,839
style discussion style,

318
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,040
conversation style.

319
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,660
Uh, but I've been working in the

320
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:47,449
background a little bit on sort of

321
00:07:47,449 --> 00:07:47,870
like a

322
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:49,889
presentation on client retention,

323
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:51,740
like an intro to client retention,

324
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:53,500
which we'll talk all about like

325
00:07:53,579 --> 00:07:56,180
operations, hiring, uh, stuff like

326
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:56,730
that.

327
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:58,500
So I want to run it by you guys

328
00:07:58,579 --> 00:08:00,459
real quick and just get some

329
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:02,079
feedback and there's multiple,

330
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:03,339
there's five phases of the

331
00:08:03,339 --> 00:08:04,220
presentation.

332
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:06,079
So we'll just go phase by phase.

333
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,560
Um, and we'll open up for

334
00:08:08,209 --> 00:08:09,660
questions in between and hopefully

335
00:08:09,709 --> 00:08:11,899
have a discussion around that if

336
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:12,360
you

337
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:15,069
guys find it interesting.

338
00:08:15,069 --> 00:08:16,079
So cool.

339
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:18,509
Let's get into it then.

340
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:23,100
Where is this document?

341
00:08:25,899 --> 00:08:28,769
Um, I can't, I lost the tab where

342
00:08:28,769 --> 00:08:30,740
the document is on.

343
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:33,279
So there we go.

344
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,080
All right.

345
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,379
I'm going to do a

346
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:37,519
screen share and then I'm also

347
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:38,710
going to hit, or we already hit

348
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:39,129
record.

349
00:08:39,129 --> 00:08:39,769
So we're good.

350
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:40,240
All right.

351
00:08:40,379 --> 00:08:40,519
Is

352
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,600
that showing up for you guys?

353
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,879
Yep.

354
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:45,110
All right, cool.

355
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:45,549
Yeah.

356
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:47,549
So this is just in a Google doc.

357
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,500
So like I was

358
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:50,309
saying in Slack, it's very much a

359
00:08:50,309 --> 00:08:51,519
beta presentation.

360
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:52,820
Uh, and so I'll run you guys

361
00:08:53,029 --> 00:08:55,480
through it and I'll stop at

362
00:08:55,559 --> 00:08:57,139
certain points just so I don't

363
00:08:57,139 --> 00:08:59,019
bore you guys with just a straight

364
00:08:59,019 --> 00:08:59,690
lecture.

365
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:01,340
Uh, and again, so this is

366
00:09:01,419 --> 00:09:02,750
going to be all about client

367
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,470
retention and there's going to be

368
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:06,200
five different phases we cover,

369
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:06,629
uh, to

370
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,009
go back to, uh, I forgot who I

371
00:09:08,009 --> 00:09:09,250
already forgot who asked the

372
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:10,600
question, but phase five will

373
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:11,059
teach you

374
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,759
like really how to implement all

375
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:14,440
this stuff, but we'll start from

376
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,950
the ground up just to make sure

377
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,110
you

378
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,019
have the right foundation going

379
00:09:18,299 --> 00:09:18,649
into it.

380
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:20,399
So this is really just now that

381
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,000
you imagine at this point,

382
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,690
you've closed the deal, signed the

383
00:09:24,139 --> 00:09:25,500
contract, collected the onboarding

384
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,330
fee or the initial

385
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:26,929
payment.

386
00:09:26,929 --> 00:09:27,860
What happens next?

387
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:29,240
How do you ensure that the rest of

388
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,490
the business runs smoothly and

389
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:32,080
that

390
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:34,570
customers, uh, become raving fans

391
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:35,860
of the business.

392
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:36,399
Right.

393
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:38,580
And so the first phase is really

394
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:39,360
just to start

395
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,070
with your offer, which sounds

396
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:42,070
really simple.

397
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:43,919
Uh, but the number one thing that

398
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:45,259
I've noticed is I've done

399
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:47,419
agencies in the past where I don't

400
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,279
really believe in what we're

401
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,039
offering and I'm not very

402
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:51,759
confident in

403
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,990
what we're offering.

404
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:54,580
Uh, the example I give is in the

405
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:56,309
past, we used to do like Facebook

406
00:09:56,309 --> 00:09:56,759
ads.

407
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:57,279
And to be

408
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,139
honest, I didn't really understand

409
00:09:59,379 --> 00:10:00,700
what Facebook ads were or why we

410
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,570
were even offering Facebook ads in

411
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,350
the first place.

412
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:04,580
So I think you have to truly

413
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,179
believe in what you're offering.

414
00:10:06,179 --> 00:10:06,899
So if you don't

415
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:09,220
feel like that conviction of, I

416
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:10,759
really know why, and I can answer

417
00:10:10,899 --> 00:10:11,970
the question, why I'm offering

418
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:12,620
what

419
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:14,049
I'm offering, then that's

420
00:10:14,049 --> 00:10:15,850
something, you know, to revisit

421
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,639
and to think about, uh, also with

422
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:18,399
your offer,

423
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,950
you want to set yourself up in a

424
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:21,419
way where you can prioritize

425
00:10:21,509 --> 00:10:22,000
results.

426
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:23,899
So your offer should be set up

427
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:25,789
so that you can get impactful,

428
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:27,970
meaningful, and valuable results

429
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:29,799
for whoever you work with.

430
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,250
And so it's gotta be like that

431
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:31,860
balance.

432
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,259
It's gotta be something you

433
00:10:33,259 --> 00:10:34,759
believe in, and it's gotta be

434
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,340
something that can get results

435
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,250
consistently.

436
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,929
And then the shit test, uh, that

437
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:39,830
you always want to

438
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,279
run an offer through is what do

439
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,240
you buy yourself?

440
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,740
Um, and I always think about this

441
00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:44,740
anytime I'm selling

442
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,629
anything, uh, or fulfilling on

443
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:48,110
anything is what I buy this

444
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:48,600
myself.

445
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:50,029
And if you can't answer that

446
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,909
question confidently, then some of

447
00:10:51,909 --> 00:10:53,259
these different action items and

448
00:10:53,259 --> 00:10:54,519
things we talked through today

449
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,019
might help you to layer in more

450
00:10:56,019 --> 00:10:57,690
value to what you're doing so that

451
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,179
you can then say, yeah, I would

452
00:10:59,179 --> 00:10:59,350
buy

453
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,059
this myself.

454
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:01,700
Uh, and there's a few examples

455
00:11:01,909 --> 00:11:03,440
like client ascension, uh, like

456
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,940
that's my business along with

457
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:06,230
a few of the other coaches.

458
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:07,590
And we all actively use client

459
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:09,240
ascension as if we're students.

460
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,009
So I'm always

461
00:11:10,259 --> 00:11:12,120
learning from guys like, you know,

462
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:13,730
that are on the call, uh, like

463
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:15,399
Oliver and Scott and Faison who've

464
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:15,620
been in

465
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,120
the program for a little while.

466
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,570
We're all learning together.

467
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:19,860
And so I would buy it myself

468
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:21,450
because I actively use it.

469
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:23,169
Uh, another example is my lead

470
00:11:23,169 --> 00:11:25,139
generation business knowledge X.

471
00:11:25,909 --> 00:11:26,529
We sell cold

472
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,190
email Legion and the way we get

473
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:30,129
our clients is through cold email.

474
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:32,059
So I'm literally using the same

475
00:11:32,139 --> 00:11:33,809
service that I'm selling to get

476
00:11:34,259 --> 00:11:34,490
clients.

477
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:35,620
And so it's an active

478
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:37,659
representation of we would buy it

479
00:11:37,659 --> 00:11:37,980
ourselves

480
00:11:38,059 --> 00:11:39,230
because we're using it.

481
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:40,360
And then it's not just my

482
00:11:40,539 --> 00:11:41,110
businesses.

483
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:42,970
It supplies to every business, uh,

484
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:43,049
like

485
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:45,090
Apple, like all the guys that work

486
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:46,690
at Apple, even at the C level

487
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:48,429
executives use the iPhone and use

488
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:48,919
the

489
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,220
different products that Apple

490
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:50,620
sales.

491
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:51,019
Right.

492
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,220
So you want to start with your

493
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:53,240
offer and make sure these

494
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:55,100
three things are solid.

495
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,409
Uh, this is pretty basic stuff,

496
00:11:57,409 --> 00:11:59,720
but it is very important to really

497
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,279
go through

498
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,960
and, and, you know, ask yourself

499
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,129
these questions and have

500
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:04,600
conviction on all three of these

501
00:12:04,809 --> 00:12:05,250
things.

502
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:05,350
So

503
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:07,299
any questions or points to

504
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,620
discussion before we go into phase

505
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:09,879
two,

506
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:25,220
anyone, anyone, anyone, anyone,

507
00:12:25,299 --> 00:12:30,210
cool.

508
00:12:30,809 --> 00:12:31,899
All right.

509
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,269
Actually, I'll, I'll, I'll toss

510
00:12:33,409 --> 00:12:34,480
something in just to mix it up.

511
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,519
Um, we've,

512
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,029
we've talked about this a little

513
00:12:37,029 --> 00:12:38,830
bit before, but, uh, because there

514
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:40,179
are other guys in here who are

515
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:41,809
doing creative services stuff for

516
00:12:41,809 --> 00:12:43,309
number two, when you talk about

517
00:12:43,309 --> 00:12:45,720
prioritized results, what would be

518
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:45,860
a

519
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:48,070
good way to, uh, essentially

520
00:12:48,419 --> 00:12:50,179
quantify results for creative

521
00:12:50,389 --> 00:12:50,929
offers?

522
00:12:51,019 --> 00:12:53,019
Uh, because it's, it's a

523
00:12:53,019 --> 00:12:53,259
different,

524
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:54,549
different nature than lead gen or

525
00:12:54,549 --> 00:12:55,460
anything like that.

526
00:12:55,539 --> 00:12:57,980
Yeah, that's a great question.

527
00:12:58,019 --> 00:13:00,320
So results doesn't, they don't

528
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,779
have to be like quantitative.

529
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:02,299
It doesn't

530
00:13:02,379 --> 00:13:04,039
have to be a number result.

531
00:13:04,039 --> 00:13:05,879
It could be, um, the fact that

532
00:13:05,899 --> 00:13:07,590
they now have a video to use in

533
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:07,820
their

534
00:13:07,899 --> 00:13:08,220
ads.

535
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,950
Like that can be a result that is

536
00:13:10,379 --> 00:13:10,820
successful.

537
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,340
And this is why I love, uh,

538
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:13,720
agencies like yours and

539
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:15,289
like the creative agencies like

540
00:13:15,289 --> 00:13:16,960
app development, because the end

541
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,720
result that they're looking for

542
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,679
is a functional app or a new

543
00:13:21,299 --> 00:13:23,120
website that actually works and,

544
00:13:23,309 --> 00:13:25,460
and it loads really quickly and

545
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:25,799
they're

546
00:13:25,899 --> 00:13:27,500
getting, uh, you know,

547
00:13:28,029 --> 00:13:29,679
complimented on it by their, their

548
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:30,389
users.

549
00:13:30,389 --> 00:13:32,200
Like that can be an end result.

550
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:34,039
Doesn't necessarily have to be

551
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:35,779
numbers, ROI conversion.

552
00:13:35,809 --> 00:13:37,879
It never, it doesn't always have

553
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,950
to be quantitative.

554
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:40,419
It really depends on your offer

555
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,009
and the service you're providing

556
00:13:42,009 --> 00:13:42,779
and what the goal

557
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:43,340
of it is.

558
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:45,460
There's also a question down here,

559
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:47,090
uh, that we'll talk about later

560
00:13:47,309 --> 00:13:48,620
on, which is how's your

561
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,210
client measuring success.

562
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:51,809
And you want to get really clear

563
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:52,940
on that question.

564
00:13:53,149 --> 00:13:53,690
And you should

565
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,830
literally ask your client at the

566
00:13:56,059 --> 00:13:57,720
start of every relationship.

567
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,980
Like how are you measuring success

568
00:14:00,059 --> 00:14:02,340
after 30 days or after the, the

569
00:14:02,539 --> 00:14:04,629
completion of our services, what

570
00:14:04,629 --> 00:14:06,659
does success look like to you?

571
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:08,659
And so from the very beginning,

572
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:10,559
you now understand what to work

573
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:12,580
towards because they told you what

574
00:14:12,659 --> 00:14:13,289
success looks like.

575
00:14:13,389 --> 00:14:14,570
So when you work with someone,

576
00:14:14,779 --> 00:14:16,129
Scott, they might say, Hey, I just

577
00:14:16,129 --> 00:14:16,889
want a really

578
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,830
nice video that I can use in my

579
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:20,929
Twitter ads, or I want a really

580
00:14:20,929 --> 00:14:22,899
nice video that I can put on my

581
00:14:23,139 --> 00:14:23,139
landing

582
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:25,019
page that really fits the branding

583
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:26,730
and showcases what my product can

584
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:27,779
do for people.

585
00:14:27,779 --> 00:14:29,299
And they're not

586
00:14:29,379 --> 00:14:29,679
good.

587
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:30,940
And that might just be it.

588
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:32,429
And so working towards what they

589
00:14:32,429 --> 00:14:34,820
define success to be is, is a

590
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:35,379
great leverage

591
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:35,700
point.

592
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:39,139
Good question.

593
00:14:39,139 --> 00:14:41,379
Any follow-up to that or anyone

594
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,620
else have anything to chime in?

595
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:47,779
Well, it's not just yourself, but

596
00:14:47,779 --> 00:14:50,299
it's also the team.

597
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,720
If you have somebody on your team

598
00:14:51,809 --> 00:14:52,190
that doesn't

599
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:54,019
believe in the offer, that's a

600
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:54,899
problem too.

601
00:14:54,899 --> 00:14:56,580
I've seen that in the past.

602
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:58,899
Yeah, that's a great point.

603
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:00,820
That's a great point.

604
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:04,240
Um, yeah, especially your sales

605
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:05,110
guys.

606
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:06,100
Like that's,

607
00:15:06,179 --> 00:15:08,360
that's usually where this matters

608
00:15:08,649 --> 00:15:10,220
most is the sales process.

609
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:12,179
Um, but also like the point of

610
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:12,779
asking this

611
00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:15,059
question is if you don't answer

612
00:15:15,379 --> 00:15:17,559
confidently and then, and this is

613
00:15:17,559 --> 00:15:18,929
a great test too.

614
00:15:19,159 --> 00:15:20,399
Like if you find a team

615
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,309
member that doesn't fully buy into

616
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:24,179
what you're selling, ask them why

617
00:15:24,179 --> 00:15:25,620
and ask them what would they

618
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,360
need to see or what would need to

619
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:28,889
change for that answer to be

620
00:15:28,889 --> 00:15:29,700
different.

621
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,220
And then that'll just give

622
00:15:31,299 --> 00:15:32,779
you answers and clarity on what

623
00:15:32,779 --> 00:15:33,980
you need to improve or do

624
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:34,799
differently.

625
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:38,720
So it's not just, Oh, I don't

626
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,769
believe in my service.

627
00:15:39,769 --> 00:15:41,379
Maybe I should think of something

628
00:15:41,379 --> 00:15:41,620
else.

629
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,220
Or maybe I should quit.

630
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,549
It's like, no, like figure out

631
00:15:44,549 --> 00:15:45,779
what it takes for you to then

632
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:46,259
believe in your

633
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:46,820
service.

634
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:48,549
When I first started doing cold

635
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:50,120
email, I had no experience with

636
00:15:50,259 --> 00:15:51,460
cold email and I couldn't

637
00:15:51,539 --> 00:15:52,659
see tangible results.

638
00:15:52,659 --> 00:15:54,129
And so I didn't fully believe in

639
00:15:54,129 --> 00:15:54,409
it.

640
00:15:54,409 --> 00:15:55,769
So I tested it myself and I was

641
00:15:55,779 --> 00:15:56,100
able to

642
00:15:56,179 --> 00:15:57,919
see results and therefore I was

643
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,679
able to confidently sell it.

644
00:15:59,789 --> 00:16:01,860
Um, and the more results, the more

645
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:02,730
success,

646
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:03,750
the more you're going to believe

647
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:04,340
in something.

648
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:07,620
Uh, and so that's that.

649
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:07,809
Okay.

650
00:16:07,809 --> 00:16:08,659
So phase one,

651
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,049
really basic stuff, right?

652
00:16:10,049 --> 00:16:11,620
I don't want to bore you guys, but

653
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,539
there, there are layers to it that

654
00:16:14,259 --> 00:16:15,769
really often get overlooked that

655
00:16:15,769 --> 00:16:17,370
affect the other phases, which is

656
00:16:17,409 --> 00:16:18,490
why we start there.

657
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:19,960
Uh, so phase two, this is just

658
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,519
talking about, okay, now you've

659
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:22,519
signed a client.

660
00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:22,809
Like first

661
00:16:23,059 --> 00:16:25,230
impressions are so, so important.

662
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:27,480
Uh, and the most common mistake I

663
00:16:27,509 --> 00:16:29,460
see like new agency owners make

664
00:16:29,539 --> 00:16:31,120
is they don't really have an

665
00:16:31,629 --> 00:16:32,580
onboarding process.

666
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:34,490
And if they do, it's, it's pretty

667
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:35,539
all over the place.

668
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:38,240
Uh, I don't want to call out names

669
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,190
or anything like that, but like

670
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:41,539
recently we bought a service

671
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:44,409
uh, and I just paid the invoice.

672
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:46,519
And after I paid the invoice, like

673
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:48,100
nothing happened for like 24

674
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:48,740
hours.

675
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,320
And so I was pretty confused.

676
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,110
I'm like, did they get the

677
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:53,049
invoice?

678
00:16:53,269 --> 00:16:54,580
What's the next steps?

679
00:16:54,659 --> 00:16:55,470
Did I get scammed?

680
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:56,019
Right?

681
00:16:56,019 --> 00:16:57,580
Like these questions start coming

682
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,570
in your head and that really

683
00:16:59,570 --> 00:16:59,649
affects

684
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,460
the remainder of the relationship.

685
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:03,129
And so let's talk about

686
00:17:03,159 --> 00:17:04,279
onboarding, right?

687
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:06,568
The first 24 hours I say

688
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,279
are the most important because in

689
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:10,160
the first 24 hours, that's when

690
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:12,660
buyers remorse starts to settle

691
00:17:12,779 --> 00:17:12,980
in.

692
00:17:13,059 --> 00:17:14,328
Did I make the right decision?

693
00:17:14,328 --> 00:17:15,220
Did I get scammed?

694
00:17:15,539 --> 00:17:17,930
Maybe I spent too much money,

695
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:18,269
whatever.

696
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:18,740
Like these

697
00:17:18,818 --> 00:17:20,588
are all thoughts that are natural

698
00:17:20,588 --> 00:17:21,930
for humans after they make a big

699
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:22,980
purchase decision.

700
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:23,809
And so you want

701
00:17:24,019 --> 00:17:25,480
to confirm to them that they made

702
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,568
the right decision.

703
00:17:26,568 --> 00:17:28,098
And the example I always use is

704
00:17:28,098 --> 00:17:28,259
like,

705
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:29,529
what happens after you buy

706
00:17:29,529 --> 00:17:30,900
something off of Amazon?

707
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:33,059
Like immediately they send you a

708
00:17:33,059 --> 00:17:33,299
confirmation

709
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:33,940
email.

710
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,779
Like imagine a scenario where you

711
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:37,480
bought something off Amazon and

712
00:17:37,619 --> 00:17:38,910
they never sent you an

713
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:40,539
email and nothing happened after

714
00:17:40,539 --> 00:17:41,069
the fact.

715
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:42,250
You'd be confused as shit.

716
00:17:42,289 --> 00:17:43,220
You would have, you would have

717
00:17:43,299 --> 00:17:44,640
been like me last week thinking

718
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,109
that I went to some other website

719
00:17:46,109 --> 00:17:47,460
and put in my social security

720
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:47,779
number

721
00:17:47,859 --> 00:17:48,740
and got scammed.

722
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:50,269
Like that's the feeling you'd

723
00:17:50,339 --> 00:17:50,740
have.

724
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:52,740
And you'd probably never buy from

725
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:53,460
Amazon again,

726
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:55,200
because you're scared that you

727
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,390
might get scammed.

728
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:57,779
So it's the same thing when

729
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:59,220
someone buys your agency

730
00:17:59,299 --> 00:18:00,279
services and they don't get a

731
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:01,660
confirmation email, they're going

732
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:02,410
to be confused.

733
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:02,819
They're going to be

734
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:03,359
lost.

735
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:05,140
They're going to be concerned,

736
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:05,670
right?

737
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:07,450
And so have a confirmation email

738
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:08,819
and not just a confirmation

739
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,660
email, but same thing with Amazon.

740
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:12,099
They send you emails when your

741
00:18:12,099 --> 00:18:14,339
order ships, when it delivers,

742
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:15,759
when it's out for delivery, right?

743
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:16,829
So like each step of the way,

744
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,500
they're notifying you what's going

745
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:18,650
on

746
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:20,119
with your order and you should do

747
00:18:20,119 --> 00:18:21,529
the same thing with your agency

748
00:18:21,529 --> 00:18:22,180
services.

749
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:23,460
And then they have a

750
00:18:23,539 --> 00:18:24,369
feedback loop.

751
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:26,119
So once your order delivers, they

752
00:18:26,119 --> 00:18:27,680
always send you an email asking

753
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,420
for feedback and

754
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,309
deliver review.

755
00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:30,640
So they constantly have that

756
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:31,440
feedback loop.

757
00:18:31,529 --> 00:18:33,059
And so you can learn a lot from a

758
00:18:33,059 --> 00:18:33,450
simple

759
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:35,779
Amazon ordering process, right?

760
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:38,849
So that's the first 24 hours.

761
00:18:38,849 --> 00:18:41,140
And then the first 30 days for

762
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:41,539
eight,

763
00:18:41,619 --> 00:18:43,289
this is more applicable to like an

764
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:44,299
agency service.

765
00:18:44,299 --> 00:18:46,420
You really have 30 days to impress

766
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,710
the client with your actual

767
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:49,609
service because within 24 hours,

768
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:51,220
they're not going to see whether

769
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:51,450
or not

770
00:18:51,539 --> 00:18:52,730
your service works.

771
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:54,720
So the first 24 hours are more so

772
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,299
about reassuring that they sign up

773
00:18:57,299 --> 00:18:57,700
to something

774
00:18:57,779 --> 00:18:59,190
that's legit and structured,

775
00:18:59,190 --> 00:18:59,650
right?

776
00:18:59,819 --> 00:19:01,019
You just got to show them that

777
00:19:01,019 --> 00:19:02,250
you're professional.

778
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:02,500
Within the

779
00:19:02,579 --> 00:19:03,920
first 30 days, you have to show

780
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,069
them that you actually have a

781
00:19:05,069 --> 00:19:06,359
roadmap to get them to where they

782
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:06,809
want to

783
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:07,259
be.

784
00:19:07,259 --> 00:19:09,200
And so it's similar to like

785
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:10,349
university.

786
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:12,190
When you go and sign up for

787
00:19:13,079 --> 00:19:14,339
university, not all of us went to

788
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,049
school here.

789
00:19:15,349 --> 00:19:16,660
But when you go and sign up for

790
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,359
college, you get a syllabus for

791
00:19:18,359 --> 00:19:19,460
each of the classes,

792
00:19:19,539 --> 00:19:21,200
which outlines exactly what you're

793
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,579
going to cover for the entire

794
00:19:22,579 --> 00:19:24,180
class, like for three or four

795
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:24,750
months.

796
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,440
It's outlined step by step.

797
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,170
And it also outlines exactly what

798
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:29,859
you need to bring the class, what

799
00:19:29,859 --> 00:19:29,960
to

800
00:19:30,099 --> 00:19:31,569
show up with materials.

801
00:19:31,569 --> 00:19:33,319
And so you can learn a lot from a

802
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:34,660
college syllabus.

803
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:36,259
There's also a campus map.

804
00:19:36,339 --> 00:19:38,000
So similar to an offer like Client

805
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,630
Ascension where we have weekly

806
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:41,259
calls, like imagine you

807
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:42,859
didn't know where these calls were

808
00:19:42,859 --> 00:19:43,619
being hosted.

809
00:19:43,619 --> 00:19:45,240
We'd probably have no one showing

810
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:45,619
up.

811
00:19:45,619 --> 00:19:46,180
So we have to

812
00:19:46,259 --> 00:19:47,700
constantly remind students of

813
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,920
where classes are or where they're

814
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,420
taking place, where to find

815
00:19:52,519 --> 00:19:52,740
things,

816
00:19:52,819 --> 00:19:53,029
right?

817
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:53,940
We have to give them a map.

818
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,759
And then there's also a portal,

819
00:19:55,849 --> 00:19:56,599
which is where they're able to

820
00:19:56,819 --> 00:19:58,250
communicate with you or with other

821
00:19:58,250 --> 00:19:58,819
students.

822
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:00,309
And that's essentially what we use

823
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:00,980
Slack for.

824
00:20:01,059 --> 00:20:03,210
And so the whole idea behind this

825
00:20:03,539 --> 00:20:05,519
first part is you want to recreate

826
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:06,269
the same experiences

827
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:08,920
that the universities are creating

828
00:20:09,099 --> 00:20:10,759
and that companies like Amazon are

829
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:11,859
creating because they're

830
00:20:11,859 --> 00:20:11,970
successful

831
00:20:13,059 --> 00:20:13,940
for these reasons.

832
00:20:14,329 --> 00:20:17,579
And first impressions and agency

833
00:20:17,579 --> 00:20:20,009
services, it's all about making

834
00:20:20,099 --> 00:20:22,410
an experience out of it, creating

835
00:20:22,569 --> 00:20:24,809
an experience that really gets the

836
00:20:24,809 --> 00:20:26,980
attention of your clients.

837
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:27,460
So

838
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,950
I'm going to stop there for a

839
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:30,630
second because there's a lot we

840
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,619
just covered.

841
00:20:31,619 --> 00:20:32,750
What are the questions or

842
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:37,920
points of conversation you guys

843
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:42,339
have based on this stuff?

844
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:42,819
I got one.

845
00:20:42,819 --> 00:20:47,440
For a lot of the companies that

846
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:51,119
I've talked to, they'll have net

847
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:52,109
15,

848
00:20:52,259 --> 00:20:53,769
net 30 payments on invoices and

849
00:20:53,769 --> 00:20:54,259
stuff.

850
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:55,759
So there's not that immediate

851
00:20:55,859 --> 00:20:57,220
thing that they can get,

852
00:20:57,299 --> 00:20:58,160
because usually there'll be a

853
00:20:58,430 --> 00:20:58,579
deposit.

854
00:20:58,579 --> 00:20:59,700
There's not an immediate payment

855
00:20:59,779 --> 00:21:00,980
that they can make to trigger

856
00:21:01,029 --> 00:21:02,420
a lot of onboarding actions.

857
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:06,009
What are those triggers

858
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:10,980
that would kind of set in place,

859
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:12,539
like the onboarding email or that

860
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,369
type of stuff?

861
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:16,019
Yeah, the way we have it set up at

862
00:21:16,019 --> 00:21:17,609
our agency is as soon as we get

863
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:18,480
the signed contract.

864
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:21,220
So when we get this, we do two

865
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:21,849
different things.

866
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:23,140
When we get the signed contract,

867
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:24,630
we basically send them like an

868
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:26,720
Amazon email saying, "Congrats,

869
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:28,740
you're now a client of KnowledgeX.

870
00:21:28,819 --> 00:21:30,299
Keep an eye out on your inbox.

871
00:21:30,299 --> 00:21:32,319
Within the next 24 hours, our team

872
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:33,789
will send you an onboarding email

873
00:21:34,019 --> 00:21:35,690
with more information." So even

874
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:38,019
though we send them the onboarding

875
00:21:38,019 --> 00:21:38,900
email right away,

876
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:39,720
there's some point of

877
00:21:40,329 --> 00:21:41,490
communication saying, "Hey, we got

878
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:42,480
your order.

879
00:21:42,579 --> 00:21:44,420
We're working on it."

880
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,700
Right?

881
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,210
And it's like that simple step in

882
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:48,740
the process goes a long way.

883
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:49,710
Let me actually pull that

884
00:21:50,019 --> 00:21:51,740
up to share it with you guys

885
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:55,230
because it's so simple, but it is

886
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:57,970
so effective because the

887
00:21:58,130 --> 00:21:58,819
onboarding

888
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,670
process for a lot of agencies is

889
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:01,309
manual.

890
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,670
There's certain links and assets

891
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:04,900
that you have to put in

892
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:05,920
an onboarding email that's

893
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,140
different for every client.

894
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:08,750
So unless you're on your computer

895
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:09,539
24/7,

896
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:11,160
there's most likely going to be a

897
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,839
delay between when someone signs

898
00:22:12,839 --> 00:22:14,259
or pays and when they get the

899
00:22:14,339 --> 00:22:15,769
onboarding email.

900
00:22:15,769 --> 00:22:17,500
So adding a really simple

901
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,750
automated step in between goes a

902
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:20,420
long way.

903
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:23,380
I'll find this for you real quick.

904
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:25,710
Yeah, this is the onboarding

905
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:26,420
email.

906
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,140
And again, it's like,

907
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:29,859
let's see the emotion that this

908
00:22:29,859 --> 00:22:33,819
produces when you see this email.

909
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:34,980
It's the same thing your client's

910
00:22:35,059 --> 00:22:36,200
going to feel right.

911
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,940
So think of going into, you just

912
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,619
paid or you just signed a contract

913
00:22:39,619 --> 00:22:39,859
and you're

914
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:41,349
kind of like nervous and you're

915
00:22:41,349 --> 00:22:43,130
all tense and you're stressed out.

916
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:44,579
And then you see this email

917
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:45,890
with like the minions cheering and

918
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:46,230
a jiff.

919
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:47,589
And it's like, you now have a

920
00:22:47,589 --> 00:22:48,890
smile on your face and you're

921
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:50,369
happy and it like brings up these

922
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:51,450
different emotions.

923
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:52,759
And it's kind of childish and

924
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:53,210
silly,

925
00:22:53,299 --> 00:22:54,339
but it really works.

926
00:22:54,339 --> 00:22:56,369
So it's as simple as this, like

927
00:22:56,369 --> 00:22:58,289
welcome, name, let's grow.

928
00:22:58,339 --> 00:22:59,700
Congrats.

929
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:00,180
You just took

930
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:01,650
a huge step towards scaling your

931
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:02,180
agency.

932
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:03,539
Keep an eye out for an email from

933
00:23:03,539 --> 00:23:04,819
our CEO outlining the next

934
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:05,240
steps.

935
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,539
We couldn't be more excited to

936
00:23:06,539 --> 00:23:07,329
work together.

937
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:08,170
Simple, right?

938
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:09,769
Like not, like not much goes into

939
00:23:09,859 --> 00:23:10,259
that at all.

940
00:23:10,259 --> 00:23:12,099
Yeah, that's great.

941
00:23:12,339 --> 00:23:14,470
This is, uh, yeah, this is a major

942
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:16,180
step of the process.

943
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:16,460
That's all

944
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:17,359
automated.

945
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:19,180
Um, cause there's really not much

946
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:19,670
there.

947
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:21,380
Same with the client ascension

948
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:22,339
onboarding process.

949
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:23,450
I think we have that pretty

950
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:23,900
dialed.

951
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,299
So if you go back and look like,

952
00:23:25,299 --> 00:23:26,819
what do we do when we first,

953
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:29,059
you know, when you first like paid

954
00:23:29,059 --> 00:23:31,049
or signed the contract, you could

955
00:23:31,049 --> 00:23:32,109
kind of recreate a lot of that

956
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:33,369
as well.

957
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:33,809
Yeah.

958
00:23:33,809 --> 00:23:34,500
That's, that's what I've been

959
00:23:34,819 --> 00:23:35,940
modeling it off of is client

960
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:36,970
ascension stuff.

961
00:23:37,059 --> 00:23:37,539
Yeah.

962
00:23:37,589 --> 00:23:39,250
So client ascension is, is

963
00:23:39,539 --> 00:23:41,299
there's, there's not much

964
00:23:41,509 --> 00:23:43,299
uniqueness to the onboarding

965
00:23:43,319 --> 00:23:43,619
email.

966
00:23:43,619 --> 00:23:43,700
So we

967
00:23:43,859 --> 00:23:44,670
could automate it for something

968
00:23:45,059 --> 00:23:46,319
like knowledge X, it's a little

969
00:23:46,339 --> 00:23:47,140
bit different.

970
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:47,640
We have to like

971
00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:49,349
set up different assets that we

972
00:23:49,349 --> 00:23:51,220
then link in an onboarding email.

973
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:52,809
So we add in that buffer email

974
00:23:53,059 --> 00:23:54,420
before the actual onboarding email

975
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:55,140
gets sent out.

976
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:57,509
So regardless, there's a

977
00:23:57,509 --> 00:23:58,579
confirmation email of

978
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:00,529
some sort and then order updates

979
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:02,759
basically feedback comes later on,

980
00:24:02,759 --> 00:24:04,420
but yeah, great question.

981
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,730
And we'll get more to the onboard.

982
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:08,740
I mean, we can kind of talk about

983
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:10,099
it now since we're

984
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:11,690
headed in that direction, but like

985
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:12,799
in onboarding email is so

986
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:13,539
important.

987
00:24:13,539 --> 00:24:15,390
Uh, the number one goal of

988
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:17,160
an onboarding email is to include

989
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:18,859
specific next steps for yourself

990
00:24:18,859 --> 00:24:20,019
and for the client.

991
00:24:20,019 --> 00:24:21,460
Like, don't be afraid to

992
00:24:21,539 --> 00:24:23,279
give your clients next steps.

993
00:24:23,549 --> 00:24:24,890
Like this is the time when you

994
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:26,529
should be asking your clients to

995
00:24:26,529 --> 00:24:27,380
do specific

996
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:27,809
things.

997
00:24:27,809 --> 00:24:29,160
Basically give them homework.

998
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,529
Like we do for client ascension.

999
00:24:30,529 --> 00:24:31,690
We ask you to watch a welcome

1000
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:32,289
video.

1001
00:24:32,289 --> 00:24:33,319
We ask you to fill out an

1002
00:24:33,319 --> 00:24:34,779
onboarding form and we ask you to

1003
00:24:34,779 --> 00:24:36,200
schedule an onboarding call.

1004
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:36,579
Like we're

1005
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:38,240
giving you homework.

1006
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,430
Uh, so a lot of service providers

1007
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:42,660
are hesitant to ask their clients

1008
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,940
to do something for

1009
00:24:44,019 --> 00:24:44,390
them.

1010
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:45,609
So don't be that guy.

1011
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:47,349
Um, and then one thing we also do

1012
00:24:47,349 --> 00:24:50,019
for knowledge X, at least again,

1013
00:24:50,099 --> 00:24:51,380
let me pull this up real quick as

1014
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:52,759
an example, because it's helpful

1015
00:24:52,759 --> 00:24:54,900
to see it as we do a personalized

1016
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:55,789
welcome video.

1017
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,920
So like right here, I'll just show

1018
00:24:58,009 --> 00:24:58,690
you this.

1019
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:00,000
And this is also in the learning

1020
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:01,220
platform

1021
00:25:01,299 --> 00:25:03,049
as an example, but like, this is

1022
00:25:03,049 --> 00:25:04,940
our knowledge X, uh, onboarding

1023
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:06,819
email that is sent like manually.

1024
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:08,779
And right away we say, I recorded

1025
00:25:08,779 --> 00:25:10,130
a quick welcome video for you.

1026
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:10,970
Check it out here.

1027
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:13,519
And it's literally just me in my

1028
00:25:13,619 --> 00:25:15,609
Tiger Woods hat after a nice golf

1029
00:25:15,609 --> 00:25:17,140
round that morning.

1030
00:25:17,299 --> 00:25:17,299
Uh,

1031
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:18,829
like literally reading them

1032
00:25:18,829 --> 00:25:19,980
through the email.

1033
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:20,740
That's it.

1034
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:22,289
And it goes such a long way

1035
00:25:22,289 --> 00:25:22,369
because

1036
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:23,930
they, they get to see my face.

1037
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:24,930
They see that this isn't

1038
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:26,440
automated, obviously, because I

1039
00:25:26,579 --> 00:25:27,220
recorded this

1040
00:25:27,299 --> 00:25:29,049
video specifically for them.

1041
00:25:29,049 --> 00:25:30,720
And, and then it also gives me

1042
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,500
control over, okay, there's a lot

1043
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:33,059
of steps

1044
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:33,529
here.

1045
00:25:33,529 --> 00:25:35,269
There's a lot of things for them

1046
00:25:35,269 --> 00:25:35,730
to do.

1047
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:37,380
Let me give more context around

1048
00:25:37,589 --> 00:25:38,319
each of them.

1049
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:38,349
So

1050
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,299
there's full clarity and they're

1051
00:25:40,299 --> 00:25:41,609
not confused or lost.

1052
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:43,450
And so the welcome video, I'll

1053
00:25:43,849 --> 00:25:44,339
post this in

1054
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:45,039
the chat.

1055
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:46,859
If you guys want to take a look at

1056
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,660
it after the call, it goes a long

1057
00:25:48,869 --> 00:25:48,980
way.

1058
00:25:49,059 --> 00:25:52,170
Um, so that's that.

1059
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:54,069
Any questions on, uh, anything

1060
00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:56,660
we've talked about so far?

1061
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,779
I'm working now.

1062
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:12,660
This stuff going once going twice.

1063
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:15,730
All right, cool.

1064
00:26:15,849 --> 00:26:17,779
And again, this is pretty

1065
00:26:17,859 --> 00:26:18,779
generic stuff.

1066
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:20,309
It's very surface level.

1067
00:26:20,339 --> 00:26:22,039
The, the idea behind this is to

1068
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:23,460
introduce you guys to client

1069
00:26:23,539 --> 00:26:25,349
retention and what like the core

1070
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:27,170
concepts are, and then to dive

1071
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:28,980
further into real examples, like

1072
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:29,380
I've

1073
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:30,930
been kind of showing and then also

1074
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:32,339
in the learning platform.

1075
00:26:32,339 --> 00:26:34,410
But anyways, onboarding email is

1076
00:26:34,410 --> 00:26:34,450
super

1077
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:35,279
important.

1078
00:26:35,309 --> 00:26:36,589
Um, and then scheduling an

1079
00:26:36,859 --> 00:26:37,509
onboarding call.

1080
00:26:37,519 --> 00:26:38,980
Uh, so I think an onboarding call

1081
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:39,609
is a really

1082
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,440
important step for service

1083
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:43,640
providers to have, uh, cause it

1084
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:46,019
allows you, uh, and your client to

1085
00:26:46,019 --> 00:26:46,299
actually

1086
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:48,019
meet and synchronize as a team.

1087
00:26:48,019 --> 00:26:50,200
It's basically like an, yeah, it's

1088
00:26:50,339 --> 00:26:52,259
an onboarding slash a launch call.

1089
00:26:52,339 --> 00:26:53,819
So on an onboarding call, a few

1090
00:26:53,819 --> 00:26:55,559
things I always like to accomplish

1091
00:26:55,559 --> 00:26:56,900
is team introductions.

1092
00:26:57,619 --> 00:26:59,059
They want to know specifically who

1093
00:26:59,059 --> 00:27:00,549
they're working with and you want

1094
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:01,700
to know who specifically from

1095
00:27:01,779 --> 00:27:02,819
their team you're working with.

1096
00:27:02,819 --> 00:27:05,400
So get aligned on that and just go

1097
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,519
through like basic roles.

1098
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:07,619
Like,

1099
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,079
Hey, I'm focused on design.

1100
00:27:09,079 --> 00:27:10,200
I'm focused on software

1101
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,059
development.

1102
00:27:11,059 --> 00:27:13,380
I'm focused on admin level task.

1103
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:15,190
I'm focused on project management.

1104
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:16,960
Like just make sure there's

1105
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:18,980
clarity, uh, between roles.

1106
00:27:19,059 --> 00:27:20,460
You'll then want to talk through

1107
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:21,529
the roadmap.

1108
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:24,049
So, uh, we use this roadmap at

1109
00:27:24,579 --> 00:27:25,640
knowledge X, I'll do another

1110
00:27:25,779 --> 00:27:26,589
screen share.

1111
00:27:26,819 --> 00:27:29,220
That, uh, is a really great visual

1112
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:31,720
for these onboarding calls.

1113
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:32,180
What is it?

1114
00:27:33,619 --> 00:27:34,589
And it just helps them to

1115
00:27:34,589 --> 00:27:36,079
visualize like where we're going

1116
00:27:36,099 --> 00:27:36,900
with everything.

1117
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:38,859
And you could recreate this pretty

1118
00:27:39,099 --> 00:27:40,490
easily for your own agency.

1119
00:27:40,589 --> 00:27:41,920
And it's a helpful exercise

1120
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:42,339
anyways,

1121
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:44,130
because it'll tell you like, what

1122
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:45,490
are the steps working with

1123
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:46,180
someone?

1124
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:47,410
Scott also does a great job

1125
00:27:47,619 --> 00:27:47,859
with this.

1126
00:27:47,859 --> 00:27:49,460
This is a lot more simple, uh,

1127
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:50,900
cause it's just a video.

1128
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:53,480
And so come up with a roadmap.

1129
00:27:53,589 --> 00:27:53,619
Like,

1130
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,180
what is the actual process week

1131
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:56,849
one or week zero, week one, week

1132
00:27:56,859 --> 00:27:58,680
two, week three, week four,

1133
00:27:58,819 --> 00:27:59,980
what is the process for working

1134
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:00,789
with your agency?

1135
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:02,019
What does that look like?

1136
00:28:02,019 --> 00:28:02,900
And you could just literally

1137
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:04,019
talk through it on the onboarding

1138
00:28:04,019 --> 00:28:04,339
call.

1139
00:28:05,099 --> 00:28:05,619
Right.

1140
00:28:05,619 --> 00:28:08,740
So there's, uh, Scott, actually,

1141
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:09,539
if you don't mind,

1142
00:28:09,619 --> 00:28:10,960
could you share, uh, like your

1143
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,089
version of a roadmap?

1144
00:28:12,099 --> 00:28:16,019
Cause you have a great, uh,

1145
00:28:16,099 --> 00:28:18,049
Yeah, I'm going, I'm, uh, going to

1146
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:18,660
my Twitter.

1147
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:19,859
I'm going to send the link.

1148
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:22,509
Tweeted a while back.

1149
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:23,619
Yeah.

1150
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:25,210
It's just so much more simple.

1151
00:28:25,299 --> 00:28:26,180
It's like,

1152
00:28:26,259 --> 00:28:28,299
it's much better.

1153
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:29,609
Um, but anyways, okay.

1154
00:28:29,609 --> 00:28:30,500
So we'll go back to this.

1155
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:32,180
Here we go.

1156
00:28:32,359 --> 00:28:33,460
Let's see if this opens.

1157
00:28:33,539 --> 00:28:35,700
Yeah.

1158
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,299
So like, literally like this is

1159
00:28:37,299 --> 00:28:38,529
Scott's and it's just so helpful

1160
00:28:39,059 --> 00:28:40,150
for someone to visualize

1161
00:28:40,339 --> 00:28:41,509
because they see what's the

1162
00:28:41,509 --> 00:28:42,049
process.

1163
00:28:42,049 --> 00:28:43,650
Well, I upload the files that I

1164
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:45,460
want in my video to Dropbox.

1165
00:28:45,529 --> 00:28:47,529
I request the videos in the Trello

1166
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:48,119
board.

1167
00:28:48,119 --> 00:28:50,130
I requested changes in frame.

1168
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:51,539
And within five to seven days,

1169
00:28:51,609 --> 00:28:53,700
I received my video and it's like,

1170
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:56,450
that's so simple, but it's so

1171
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:57,940
effective because clients

1172
00:28:58,019 --> 00:28:59,619
now know exactly the four-step

1173
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:01,490
process and the tools involved.

1174
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:03,769
They're not lost and there's no,

1175
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:04,099
um,

1176
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:05,779
typo.

1177
00:29:05,859 --> 00:29:06,509
Yeah.

1178
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:09,640
Another thing I'll note too, on

1179
00:29:09,779 --> 00:29:11,829
not, not the typo thing, but kind

1180
00:29:11,930 --> 00:29:13,140
of in that spirit is that

1181
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:15,099
when you do this in the, I would

1182
00:29:15,339 --> 00:29:17,000
still encourage you to do it

1183
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:19,380
obviously in the early stages of

1184
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:19,539
your

1185
00:29:19,619 --> 00:29:20,950
business, but like, it's going to

1186
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:22,500
probably change significantly.

1187
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,299
Oh yeah.

1188
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:23,859
Yeah.

1189
00:29:23,859 --> 00:29:25,710
So at this point, like this is not

1190
00:29:25,859 --> 00:29:27,539
even accurate to us.

1191
00:29:27,539 --> 00:29:30,500
Cause like we moved away from

1192
00:29:30,579 --> 00:29:31,200
Dropbox.

1193
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,230
We were not using Trello as much.

1194
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:35,519
Uh, the timeline's different, but

1195
00:29:35,549 --> 00:29:36,660
yeah, it's still a really

1196
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:37,940
good concept to utilize.

1197
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:39,299
Yep.

1198
00:29:39,299 --> 00:29:40,740
Great.

1199
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:43,279
Thanks for that, Scott.

1200
00:29:43,289 --> 00:29:44,099
Uh, yeah.

1201
00:29:44,099 --> 00:29:45,230
So talk through the roadmap.

1202
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:47,109
Uh, and then the onboarding call

1203
00:29:47,109 --> 00:29:48,670
is a great opportunity to set

1204
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:49,940
expectations right in the

1205
00:29:50,019 --> 00:29:50,640
beginning.

1206
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,720
Cause at the time of the

1207
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:53,500
onboarding call, like your service

1208
00:29:53,509 --> 00:29:54,940
hasn't really been performed

1209
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:55,480
yet.

1210
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,349
It's more so like a preparation

1211
00:29:57,619 --> 00:29:58,640
slash a launch call.

1212
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:00,079
Uh, and so it was a great

1213
00:30:00,079 --> 00:30:01,140
opportunity to set

1214
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:02,099
expectations.

1215
00:30:02,279 --> 00:30:03,299
Even if you've already done this

1216
00:30:03,339 --> 00:30:04,410
in the sales process, even if

1217
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:05,450
you've already done this

1218
00:30:05,539 --> 00:30:07,589
in your onboarding emails, set

1219
00:30:08,019 --> 00:30:10,039
expectations multiple times, even

1220
00:30:10,039 --> 00:30:11,859
30 days into working with

1221
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:14,039
someone reset realign expectations

1222
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:15,650
because people are going to

1223
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:16,180
forget.

1224
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:20,430
And what I mean by UP and OD is

1225
00:30:20,579 --> 00:30:22,470
under promise and over deliver.

1226
00:30:22,599 --> 00:30:24,269
Uh, so a great example of this is

1227
00:30:24,269 --> 00:30:25,859
that our agency, we used to

1228
00:30:26,259 --> 00:30:26,259
promise

1229
00:30:26,339 --> 00:30:28,640
like 10 calls booked per month and

1230
00:30:28,819 --> 00:30:30,569
majority of the time would fall

1231
00:30:30,789 --> 00:30:31,700
short of that.

1232
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:32,500
We'd get anywhere

1233
00:30:32,579 --> 00:30:34,140
around like five to eight calls

1234
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:35,980
booked and clients would be pretty

1235
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:37,569
upset because we didn't get 10

1236
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:37,789
calls

1237
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:38,660
booked.

1238
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:40,650
And so we didn't change anything

1239
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:42,440
about the service we provided or

1240
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:43,779
how much we charged or

1241
00:30:43,859 --> 00:30:44,930
anything like that.

1242
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:46,450
The only thing we changed is we

1243
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:48,470
told clients instead of 10 calls,

1244
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:49,460
we expect five.

1245
00:30:49,539 --> 00:30:51,480
And that allowed us then to a more

1246
00:30:52,009 --> 00:30:53,569
majority of the time actually hit

1247
00:30:53,569 --> 00:30:56,099
it, hit KPIs, hit expectations.

1248
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:57,470
And when clients would get five

1249
00:30:57,470 --> 00:30:59,259
calls or eight calls, they'd be a

1250
00:30:59,259 --> 00:31:00,900
static and literally nothing

1251
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:02,640
changed except the expectation we

1252
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,089
set in the very beginning.

1253
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:05,460
So it's crazy.

1254
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:06,980
Like how that works.

1255
00:31:07,059 --> 00:31:08,880
And in a story, I always love the

1256
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:11,299
reference here is Warby Parker,

1257
00:31:11,509 --> 00:31:13,539
where I buy my glasses from.

1258
00:31:13,619 --> 00:31:14,849
They're also a public company.

1259
00:31:14,849 --> 00:31:15,539
They're huge.

1260
00:31:16,069 --> 00:31:17,849
What they do, anytime I've ordered

1261
00:31:18,069 --> 00:31:19,140
a pair of glasses from

1262
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:20,690
their website, they give me a

1263
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:22,369
timeline on when I should expect

1264
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,220
to get them.

1265
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:25,299
Usually five to seven days is

1266
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:26,789
like the shipping time.

1267
00:31:26,789 --> 00:31:28,750
But they always deliver within the

1268
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:30,180
next one or two days.

1269
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:31,779
And even though

1270
00:31:31,859 --> 00:31:33,089
at this point, since I've ordered

1271
00:31:33,089 --> 00:31:34,259
so many times from them, I know

1272
00:31:34,339 --> 00:31:35,539
that they're going to show up

1273
00:31:35,539 --> 00:31:36,259
earlier,

1274
00:31:36,339 --> 00:31:37,940
it still tells me five to seven.

1275
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:39,559
And so in my head, I'm expecting

1276
00:31:39,559 --> 00:31:40,980
them to come later and they show

1277
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:41,059
up

1278
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:41,380
early.

1279
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:43,339
And that's a really great feeling

1280
00:31:43,339 --> 00:31:45,369
as a consumer and as a customer.

1281
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:47,109
If they just told me, if they told

1282
00:31:47,109 --> 00:31:48,759
me like Amazon, it's going to be

1283
00:31:48,759 --> 00:31:50,579
next day or overnight delivery.

1284
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:51,460
And it was overnight.

1285
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:52,890
It's like, okay, whatever, like

1286
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:54,349
that was supposed to happen.

1287
00:31:54,349 --> 00:31:55,380
And it's not as exciting.

1288
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:56,849
So great example of under

1289
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,819
promising and over delivering,

1290
00:31:58,819 --> 00:32:00,380
just set yourself up for success

1291
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:02,339
when you set up expectations.

1292
00:32:05,619 --> 00:32:05,859
Cool.

1293
00:32:05,859 --> 00:32:07,220
Connor, good to see you here.

1294
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:08,829
I'll have the recording in the

1295
00:32:08,829 --> 00:32:10,259
learning platform later.

1296
00:32:10,259 --> 00:32:11,380
Appreciate you being here.

1297
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:13,069
The other thing you want to do on

1298
00:32:13,069 --> 00:32:14,940
the onboarding call is just answer

1299
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:16,180
all the questions.

1300
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:18,259
Like most of the time,

1301
00:32:18,339 --> 00:32:20,140
between the sales process and the

1302
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:22,480
onboarding, your clients are going

1303
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,339
to have questions about different

1304
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:25,660
things that they've seen that are

1305
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:26,259
new to them.

1306
00:32:26,539 --> 00:32:29,359
And so make sure you get very

1307
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:31,000
clear on answering those

1308
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:32,210
questions for them.

1309
00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:33,410
And then at the end of the

1310
00:32:33,619 --> 00:32:35,369
onboarding call, set next steps.

1311
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:36,339
What happens next?

1312
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:38,079
What do you need the client to do?

1313
00:32:38,079 --> 00:32:39,619
And what are you going to do?

1314
00:32:39,619 --> 00:32:40,980
And be very clear about that.

1315
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:42,779
So that's phase two, making a

1316
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:44,839
really good first impression.

1317
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:47,059
The two really big leverage points

1318
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:48,869
here is an onboarding email and an

1319
00:32:49,259 --> 00:32:49,970
onboarding call.

1320
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:51,789
What questions do you guys have on

1321
00:32:51,789 --> 00:32:52,660
this stuff?

1322
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:55,920
I actually had a question on that

1323
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:58,900
for like the onboarding call.

1324
00:32:59,859 --> 00:32:59,940
Yeah.

1325
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:01,740
So like for someone, I know like

1326
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,640
mine's more specific, but the

1327
00:33:03,779 --> 00:33:05,299
onboarding call for me,

1328
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:06,740
or maybe someone that's more

1329
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:08,180
creative, it'd be much more

1330
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:09,059
heavily based on

1331
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:13,309
like questions to understand their

1332
00:33:13,309 --> 00:33:15,349
voice, what exactly they're trying

1333
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:15,859
to go for.

1334
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:19,049
Should I keep like, you know,

1335
00:33:19,089 --> 00:33:20,920
should I even set expectations,

1336
00:33:21,269 --> 00:33:22,539
like say it briefly or just

1337
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:24,529
like, cause I want like most of

1338
00:33:24,779 --> 00:33:26,440
that time probably to be asking

1339
00:33:26,579 --> 00:33:28,740
them about what do they want out

1340
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:29,140
of the

1341
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:31,000
content or videos that I'm making

1342
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:31,779
and stuff?

1343
00:33:31,779 --> 00:33:34,170
Like, should that be everything

1344
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:36,339
and changing the order of

1345
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:36,819
stuff here?

1346
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,579
No, this is a great.

1347
00:33:38,579 --> 00:33:40,400
So we did something similar within

1348
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,019
our agency where we would kind of

1349
00:33:42,019 --> 00:33:42,339
run out

1350
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:43,569
of time on our onboarding call

1351
00:33:43,569 --> 00:33:44,740
because we'd try to cover too

1352
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:45,130
much.

1353
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:48,339
So if you can relate to what Kyle

1354
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:50,240
just said, listen up, because this

1355
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,109
is something that had a huge

1356
00:33:52,109 --> 00:33:54,180
impact on our agency.

1357
00:33:54,339 --> 00:33:54,740
So what we would

1358
00:33:54,819 --> 00:33:56,170
do on the onboarding calls, we

1359
00:33:56,170 --> 00:33:57,490
just focus on some of the more

1360
00:33:57,490 --> 00:33:59,069
generic stuff, like you said, like

1361
00:33:59,299 --> 00:34:00,470
trying to like, just ask them

1362
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:01,930
follow up questions based on their

1363
00:34:01,930 --> 00:34:03,940
onboarding form, basically nothing

1364
00:34:04,019 --> 00:34:04,420
crazy.

1365
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:06,819
And you just take out this piece,

1366
00:34:06,819 --> 00:34:10,289
setting expectations, and you move

1367
00:34:10,289 --> 00:34:11,989
that down to another

1368
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:14,099
call, which is what we call an

1369
00:34:14,659 --> 00:34:15,460
alignment call.

1370
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:17,639
So the onboarding call is fully

1371
00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:19,219
focused on strategy and

1372
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:20,110
making sure you have everything

1373
00:34:20,579 --> 00:34:21,940
you need to launch campaigns and

1374
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:23,079
implement your strategy.

1375
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:24,829
And then you set an alignment

1376
00:34:24,829 --> 00:34:26,699
call, which is like, it could be

1377
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:28,340
like five to 15 minutes,

1378
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:29,610
where you literally hop on the

1379
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:30,739
call and you say, okay,

1380
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:33,139
everything's set, very clear on

1381
00:34:33,139 --> 00:34:33,400
what needs

1382
00:34:33,539 --> 00:34:35,360
to happen, strategies, campaigns

1383
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,480
are live, whatever.

1384
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:37,780
Here's what to expect.

1385
00:34:37,989 --> 00:34:39,780
Let's get aligned on

1386
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:40,400
expectations.

1387
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,250
And then you literally just go

1388
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:44,380
through your expectations on that

1389
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:45,699
one call and nothing else,

1390
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:47,619
you're fully aligned.

1391
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,280
And then you could even implement

1392
00:34:49,389 --> 00:34:51,300
alignment calls once a month or

1393
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:51,619
once

1394
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:52,179
a quarter.

1395
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:53,440
It's a healthy practice to

1396
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:55,050
continue to stay aligned with your

1397
00:34:55,050 --> 00:34:55,480
client.

1398
00:34:55,619 --> 00:34:56,500
So I'm happy you asked

1399
00:34:56,579 --> 00:34:57,059
that question.

1400
00:34:57,059 --> 00:34:58,329
Is that clear?

1401
00:34:58,690 --> 00:35:00,079
Does that like help?

1402
00:35:00,099 --> 00:35:01,559
Definitely.

1403
00:35:01,559 --> 00:35:03,059
Yeah, that helps a lot.

1404
00:35:03,139 --> 00:35:03,769
Cool.

1405
00:35:04,099 --> 00:35:05,469
It's like a checkpoint call,

1406
00:35:05,619 --> 00:35:06,250
essentially.

1407
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:09,719
Yeah, because a lot of the times

1408
00:35:09,719 --> 00:35:10,579
with our services,

1409
00:35:10,659 --> 00:35:12,530
there's just so much to talk about

1410
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:13,360
on one call.

1411
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,230
And it's like, you spent 45

1412
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:16,500
minutes talking about

1413
00:35:16,579 --> 00:35:17,929
strategy and answering all their

1414
00:35:17,929 --> 00:35:18,539
questions.

1415
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:19,960
And then you spend the last 15

1416
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,460
talking about expectations.

1417
00:35:21,539 --> 00:35:22,820
And like, because there was so

1418
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:24,579
much information, they don't even,

1419
00:35:24,579 --> 00:35:26,489
they didn't even remember what the

1420
00:35:26,579 --> 00:35:27,460
expectations were.

1421
00:35:27,679 --> 00:35:28,909
They didn't even have the mental

1422
00:35:29,059 --> 00:35:30,360
capacity to process them at the

1423
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:30,820
time.

1424
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:32,550
And so they'll usually forget, or

1425
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:34,090
they'll probably just ask again

1426
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:35,619
later on and be confused.

1427
00:35:35,619 --> 00:35:35,940
So yeah,

1428
00:35:36,019 --> 00:35:37,670
if you could dedicate like a two

1429
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:38,960
call process to that.

1430
00:35:39,050 --> 00:35:39,800
Very smart.

1431
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:43,440
Dope.

1432
00:35:44,059 --> 00:35:45,260
Anyone else to follow up on what

1433
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:46,880
Kyle said or any other questions

1434
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:47,690
on phase two?

1435
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:52,730
Dope.

1436
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,389
All right.

1437
00:35:54,599 --> 00:35:56,909
So going into phase three, it's

1438
00:35:56,909 --> 00:35:58,710
all about ongoing management.

1439
00:35:58,860 --> 00:35:59,780
So now that you've

1440
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:01,630
retained them for 30 days, which

1441
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:03,369
is usually like one billing cycle,

1442
00:36:03,469 --> 00:36:06,980
you know, you're, you did a pretty

1443
00:36:07,059 --> 00:36:07,650
good job.

1444
00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:09,519
You're like, you're started.

1445
00:36:09,539 --> 00:36:11,250
And so this is where the ongoing

1446
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:13,139
management is really shifts

1447
00:36:13,219 --> 00:36:13,849
in the focus.

1448
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:15,880
And it's just a good reminder to

1449
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:18,130
continue to prioritize results.

1450
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:19,619
Above everything

1451
00:36:19,699 --> 00:36:21,130
else, like no matter what tactics

1452
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:22,619
you implement here, no matter how

1453
00:36:22,619 --> 00:36:24,260
cool your onboarding process is,

1454
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:25,980
no matter how often you check in

1455
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:28,010
with your clients, if the results

1456
00:36:28,010 --> 00:36:29,539
aren't there, they're not going to

1457
00:36:29,699 --> 00:36:29,699
be

1458
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:30,130
there.

1459
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:31,449
Because at the end of the day,

1460
00:36:31,449 --> 00:36:32,719
they might be friendly and you

1461
00:36:32,809 --> 00:36:34,340
might be boys with them.

1462
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:34,579
But if

1463
00:36:34,659 --> 00:36:36,110
the results aren't there, as long

1464
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:37,599
as they're a good business owner,

1465
00:36:37,690 --> 00:36:39,380
they're not going to stick around.

1466
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:40,989
And if they're not a good business

1467
00:36:40,989 --> 00:36:42,550
owner and they continue to stick

1468
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:43,619
around, they're not going to be

1469
00:36:43,699 --> 00:36:44,719
in business to be able to pay you

1470
00:36:44,719 --> 00:36:45,539
anymore anyways.

1471
00:36:45,539 --> 00:36:46,980
So it's like, you're going to lose

1472
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:47,480
them if results

1473
00:36:47,699 --> 00:36:48,179
are not there.

1474
00:36:48,179 --> 00:36:51,780
And so always prioritize results.

1475
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:54,119
And there's different ways to work

1476
00:36:54,119 --> 00:36:54,900
around this.

1477
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:55,300
It's not

1478
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,090
just results are all that matters.

1479
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:58,679
If you don't get results, you're

1480
00:36:58,679 --> 00:36:59,159
screwed.

1481
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,340
Or if you're getting results,

1482
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:01,550
you don't have to do anything.

1483
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:02,820
There's still a process to follow

1484
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:03,219
here.

1485
00:37:03,219 --> 00:37:05,329
And so one thing to highlight

1486
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:06,690
is that communication is

1487
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:07,510
everything.

1488
00:37:07,570 --> 00:37:09,210
I think the number one reason why

1489
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:11,539
people lose clients outside of

1490
00:37:11,619 --> 00:37:13,320
not getting the results they could

1491
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,539
be is because they don't

1492
00:37:14,539 --> 00:37:15,849
communicate enough.

1493
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:17,860
Or they communicate

1494
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:19,110
enough about certain things, but

1495
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:20,400
not other things, which we'll talk

1496
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:20,820
about.

1497
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:22,739
So over communicate,

1498
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:24,849
like, over communicate, remind

1499
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:27,059
yourself to over communicate, like

1500
00:37:27,269 --> 00:37:27,780
every single day,

1501
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:28,670
if there's a thought that enters

1502
00:37:28,909 --> 00:37:30,309
your mind, like, hey, maybe I

1503
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:31,940
should do this for a client,

1504
00:37:32,019 --> 00:37:32,650
or maybe I should ask this

1505
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:33,250
question.

1506
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:34,349
Like, don't even think about it

1507
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:35,130
past that thought,

1508
00:37:35,219 --> 00:37:37,309
like implement it, communicate.

1509
00:37:37,349 --> 00:37:39,380
And I've had that happen before.

1510
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:41,300
The more you communicate better.

1511
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:42,670
And there's two sides to it.

1512
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:44,469
When you're performing well, let

1513
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,070
the client know.

1514
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:47,139
A lot of times,

1515
00:37:47,219 --> 00:37:48,219
like if things are going well,

1516
00:37:48,219 --> 00:37:49,329
you're like, oh, great, like

1517
00:37:49,349 --> 00:37:50,260
things are going well,

1518
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:51,269
whatever.

1519
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:52,489
I don't have to do anything like

1520
00:37:52,489 --> 00:37:53,750
you want to let the client know

1521
00:37:53,849 --> 00:37:55,769
when and that things are

1522
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:56,340
going well.

1523
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:57,900
A lot of people just forget to do

1524
00:37:57,989 --> 00:37:59,579
this, because then they'll know

1525
00:37:59,579 --> 00:38:00,420
that things are going

1526
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:00,750
well.

1527
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:01,909
A lot of the times on your end,

1528
00:38:01,909 --> 00:38:03,780
you're like, oh, yeah, like, for

1529
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:05,380
Kyle, like, I just got them a

1530
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:07,010
LinkedIn post that got 1000

1531
00:38:07,579 --> 00:38:07,780
impressions.

1532
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:08,739
That's huge.

1533
00:38:08,739 --> 00:38:10,739
But the client might see that and

1534
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:11,780
not really know the

1535
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:13,650
impact or understand that it is a

1536
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,510
successful accomplishment.

1537
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:17,070
So Kyle has to let them know,

1538
00:38:17,219 --> 00:38:18,480
hey, dude, like, I don't know if

1539
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,739
you saw, but the post that we put

1540
00:38:19,739 --> 00:38:21,300
up last week just passed 1000

1541
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:22,219
impressions.

1542
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,030
That's 10x what we've seen on

1543
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:25,590
average from all of our other

1544
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:26,820
clients just wanted to say

1545
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:27,300
congrats.

1546
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:28,409
And I'm happy to be working with

1547
00:38:28,409 --> 00:38:28,670
you.

1548
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:29,960
And it's like, oh, shit, like that

1549
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:30,980
makes the client feel

1550
00:38:31,059 --> 00:38:31,400
good.

1551
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,900
And it makes it reaffirms that

1552
00:38:33,139 --> 00:38:34,559
they're getting the results that

1553
00:38:34,579 --> 00:38:35,699
they're there for.

1554
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:37,769
So let the clients know when

1555
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:39,559
things are going well.

1556
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:41,139
Right?

1557
00:38:41,139 --> 00:38:41,539
Okay.

1558
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,469
And then the other thing, the

1559
00:38:43,469 --> 00:38:44,780
harder thing is when things are

1560
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:46,179
not performing well, or when

1561
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:47,869
things are not going to plan, let

1562
00:38:47,869 --> 00:38:48,900
the client know.

1563
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:51,250
And this is like the toughest one

1564
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:52,659
for people is

1565
00:38:52,739 --> 00:38:54,489
they try to hide things or they

1566
00:38:54,489 --> 00:38:56,710
try to kind of, you know, like

1567
00:38:56,710 --> 00:39:00,239
tunnel vision, I'll fix it myself

1568
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:02,000
kind of vibe and mentality without

1569
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:03,619
involving the client or without

1570
00:39:03,619 --> 00:39:05,059
letting the client know.

1571
00:39:05,139 --> 00:39:07,610
And this is a recipe for disaster.

1572
00:39:07,619 --> 00:39:09,099
It's just a ticking time bomb all

1573
00:39:09,099 --> 00:39:09,389
the time.

1574
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:10,349
If you do this for long

1575
00:39:10,659 --> 00:39:11,880
enough, you're going to lose the

1576
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,079
client and it's going to blow up

1577
00:39:13,139 --> 00:39:13,690
in your face.

1578
00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:14,159
And they're not

1579
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:15,699
pleasant conversations to have.

1580
00:39:15,699 --> 00:39:19,059
It's just confrontation.

1581
00:39:19,059 --> 00:39:20,940
And it's shying away from

1582
00:39:21,059 --> 00:39:21,960
confrontation.

1583
00:39:22,139 --> 00:39:23,710
And it's not, I mean, I struggled

1584
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:24,570
with that a lot.

1585
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:26,010
I struggled with it for the

1586
00:39:26,099 --> 00:39:26,579
longest time.

1587
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:27,789
And I feel like I've gotten even

1588
00:39:27,789 --> 00:39:29,030
better at it now, but it's still

1589
00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:30,579
difficult conversations

1590
00:39:30,659 --> 00:39:31,980
that have to be had in business.

1591
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:33,219
It's just part of the game.

1592
00:39:33,219 --> 00:39:35,860
And the key thing here is just to

1593
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:35,869
deploy

1594
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:38,159
honesty because it's really easy

1595
00:39:38,159 --> 00:39:39,780
to be honest with someone.

1596
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:41,619
It's very natural and you don't

1597
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:42,099
have to,

1598
00:39:42,179 --> 00:39:43,409
you know, strategize around how to

1599
00:39:43,409 --> 00:39:44,260
present it to them.

1600
00:39:44,309 --> 00:39:46,179
And so what this means is just

1601
00:39:46,179 --> 00:39:46,429
always be

1602
00:39:46,659 --> 00:39:48,019
the first to address problems.

1603
00:39:48,019 --> 00:39:49,889
Clients really, really appreciate

1604
00:39:49,889 --> 00:39:50,340
that.

1605
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:51,650
So again, like if you see

1606
00:39:51,849 --> 00:39:53,860
a problem in the business, don't

1607
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:56,019
be like, oh, maybe we'll fix this

1608
00:39:56,019 --> 00:39:57,699
in a week and the client won't

1609
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:57,940
even

1610
00:39:58,019 --> 00:40:00,170
notice that we had a really bad

1611
00:40:00,489 --> 00:40:00,820
week.

1612
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:01,800
By the time we fix it, things will

1613
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:02,739
be going well and they won't

1614
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:03,690
even notice.

1615
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:05,880
Like address the problem always.

1616
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,739
But also on the flip side, never

1617
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:09,440
address problems

1618
00:40:09,619 --> 00:40:10,250
on their own.

1619
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:11,920
Always address a problem with a

1620
00:40:12,099 --> 00:40:13,119
potential solution.

1621
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:15,539
Clients are not going to be

1622
00:40:15,619 --> 00:40:17,219
so upset if things are going wrong

1623
00:40:17,219 --> 00:40:18,840
as long as you have an action plan

1624
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:21,300
on what to do on the other side.

1625
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:22,710
What is your solution or what are

1626
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:24,179
you going to try differently that

1627
00:40:24,179 --> 00:40:25,630
is going to get things back on

1628
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:27,219
track?

1629
00:40:27,219 --> 00:40:28,889
Every time that I've done this,

1630
00:40:28,929 --> 00:40:30,690
you have to do it enough to like

1631
00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:32,380
see that like clients are humans

1632
00:40:32,659 --> 00:40:34,460
as well and they're understanding

1633
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:36,420
and they're not all douchebags.

1634
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:38,900
And so if you deploy honesty

1635
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:40,329
and you let them know that things

1636
00:40:40,329 --> 00:40:41,659
are not going well and you also

1637
00:40:41,659 --> 00:40:43,210
let them know about your plan

1638
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:44,369
and why you think it's going to

1639
00:40:44,369 --> 00:40:45,619
work and get us back on track,

1640
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:47,699
they really appreciate that.

1641
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:51,289
Like most of the times we do this,

1642
00:40:51,289 --> 00:40:52,840
it buys us another month with our

1643
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:53,409
client.

1644
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:54,030
And even if things

1645
00:40:54,179 --> 00:40:55,750
don't end up working out, there's

1646
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:57,949
no bad blood when we have a client

1647
00:40:58,099 --> 00:40:58,980
breakup.

1648
00:40:58,980 --> 00:40:59,860
And a lot of the times

1649
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:02,110
they'll refer us clients after.

1650
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:04,179
And that's important because a bad

1651
00:41:04,389 --> 00:41:06,260
client is a really big risk to

1652
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:06,489
have

1653
00:41:06,579 --> 00:41:08,079
out in the marketplace because

1654
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:09,519
they'll bad mouth you to other

1655
00:41:09,610 --> 00:41:10,829
people and they'll ruin your

1656
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:11,539
reputation

1657
00:41:12,179 --> 00:41:13,349
even after the fact.

1658
00:41:13,349 --> 00:41:14,730
Uh, and so this is really

1659
00:41:14,730 --> 00:41:15,679
important.

1660
00:41:15,789 --> 00:41:17,860
Integrity in businesses is

1661
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:19,130
something

1662
00:41:19,219 --> 00:41:20,179
that's just not talked about.

1663
00:41:20,179 --> 00:41:21,050
Okay.

1664
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:22,719
Again, a lot of information

1665
00:41:22,739 --> 00:41:23,380
covered there.

1666
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:23,940
What questions

1667
00:41:24,019 --> 00:41:25,239
do you guys have or points of

1668
00:41:25,239 --> 00:41:26,500
conversation to bring up?

1669
00:41:26,579 --> 00:41:35,940
Um, I'm not quite sure how to like

1670
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:38,579
exactly phrase this, but so, you

1671
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:40,980
know, we have quite a few existing

1672
00:41:41,059 --> 00:41:42,599
clients and I think in the last

1673
00:41:42,599 --> 00:41:44,840
month or two, there's, there's a

1674
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,179
couple of them we haven't

1675
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:47,519
done a great job for.

1676
00:41:47,519 --> 00:41:49,559
Um, like we've been behind on some

1677
00:41:49,559 --> 00:41:50,199
things.

1678
00:41:50,199 --> 00:41:52,500
Um, we pushed some bugs out to

1679
00:41:52,579 --> 00:41:54,010
production apps and like, there's

1680
00:41:54,010 --> 00:41:55,309
just been a few things that have

1681
00:41:55,309 --> 00:41:56,900
been going out so smoothly lately.

1682
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:59,230
And I was wondering how you would

1683
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:01,239
approach like, say you haven't

1684
00:42:01,429 --> 00:42:03,059
been doing a great job of checking

1685
00:42:03,139 --> 00:42:05,230
in with, with clients up to now.

1686
00:42:05,269 --> 00:42:07,159
And you want to start like, how

1687
00:42:07,159 --> 00:42:09,699
would you approach those, those

1688
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:11,420
situations like maybe, you know,

1689
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:12,889
maybe where we haven't done the

1690
00:42:12,929 --> 00:42:14,010
best job for them in the last

1691
00:42:14,099 --> 00:42:14,730
month or two?

1692
00:42:14,730 --> 00:42:15,300
Yeah.

1693
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:16,099
How would you approach that?

1694
00:42:16,179 --> 00:42:17,809
It's so easy for you.

1695
00:42:17,809 --> 00:42:19,539
Uh, if I were you, what I would

1696
00:42:19,539 --> 00:42:22,730
say is, uh, I'd basically put

1697
00:42:22,730 --> 00:42:23,219
together a

1698
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:25,150
loom video and say, Hey guys, you

1699
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:26,969
know, Avery here just wanted to

1700
00:42:26,969 --> 00:42:28,500
address, uh, just give you an

1701
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:28,900
admin

1702
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:30,539
level update about the business

1703
00:42:30,539 --> 00:42:31,920
and how things are going.

1704
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:33,860
Uh, you know, with, with the team

1705
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:34,099
and I,

1706
00:42:34,179 --> 00:42:35,500
one thing we've noticed after

1707
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:37,059
doing an audit and kind of looking

1708
00:42:37,059 --> 00:42:39,130
back these past 60 days is we're

1709
00:42:39,219 --> 00:42:40,449
not doing as good a job as we can

1710
00:42:40,449 --> 00:42:41,849
with client communication.

1711
00:42:41,849 --> 00:42:43,219
Uh, and we still have a lot to

1712
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:44,329
learn when it comes to that.

1713
00:42:44,329 --> 00:42:45,659
And we appreciate your patience.

1714
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,079
We appreciate your understanding.

1715
00:42:47,219 --> 00:42:47,860
Uh,

1716
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,210
and so one thing that we're doing

1717
00:42:49,210 --> 00:42:50,579
differently is we invested into

1718
00:42:50,579 --> 00:42:52,420
this program, uh, this coaching

1719
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:53,969
program where we're working with

1720
00:42:53,969 --> 00:42:55,340
other agency owners and we're

1721
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:56,750
learning different tactics and

1722
00:42:56,980 --> 00:42:58,130
strategies and systems we could

1723
00:42:58,130 --> 00:42:59,400
implement to better communicate

1724
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:00,090
with clients.

1725
00:43:00,090 --> 00:43:01,539
So we're investing in

1726
00:43:01,619 --> 00:43:02,690
ourselves, uh, and we're

1727
00:43:02,690 --> 00:43:04,039
implementing everything we're

1728
00:43:04,099 --> 00:43:04,559
learning.

1729
00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:05,849
And so I think you're going to

1730
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:05,869
have

1731
00:43:06,070 --> 00:43:07,400
a much better experience.

1732
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:08,980
And one thing that we ask, uh, of

1733
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:10,340
you as a client is to be honest

1734
00:43:10,550 --> 00:43:10,900
with us,

1735
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:12,329
provide us all your feedback and

1736
00:43:12,329 --> 00:43:13,739
give us things that we can work on

1737
00:43:13,739 --> 00:43:15,050
and do a better job at.

1738
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:15,699
And we can

1739
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:17,239
work together as a team like that

1740
00:43:17,239 --> 00:43:17,989
right there.

1741
00:43:17,989 --> 00:43:19,280
If I'm a client and I hear that

1742
00:43:19,329 --> 00:43:20,260
message, like,

1743
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:21,519
first off, you're addressing the

1744
00:43:21,519 --> 00:43:24,340
problem, which is key, right?

1745
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:25,059
Like, Oh, okay.

1746
00:43:25,059 --> 00:43:25,780
He, he,

1747
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:27,369
he's notices that he could be

1748
00:43:27,369 --> 00:43:28,969
doing a better job of, uh, of

1749
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,460
communicating, but two, you

1750
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:31,699
brought

1751
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:32,409
them a solution.

1752
00:43:32,650 --> 00:43:33,849
You just told me that you noticed

1753
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:34,099
it.

1754
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:35,150
And so you took action and

1755
00:43:35,150 --> 00:43:36,340
actually invested

1756
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:38,469
profits that you probably earned

1757
00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:40,650
from them into a coaching program

1758
00:43:40,659 --> 00:43:41,630
for the sole purpose to get

1759
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:43,300
better and fix these problems.

1760
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:44,599
Like that right there tells me

1761
00:43:44,599 --> 00:43:45,940
everything I need to hear.

1762
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:46,809
And that's my

1763
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:47,139
guy.

1764
00:43:47,139 --> 00:43:48,400
Like I want to be working with

1765
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,269
Avery and his agency because he's

1766
00:43:50,269 --> 00:43:52,179
displaying a willingness to learn

1767
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:52,340
and

1768
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:53,860
improve.

1769
00:43:53,860 --> 00:43:54,780
That's awesome.

1770
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:55,219
Yeah.

1771
00:43:55,219 --> 00:43:55,780
Thanks for that.

1772
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:57,139
Yeah, dude.

1773
00:43:57,139 --> 00:43:59,030
Well, I didn't really help you at

1774
00:43:59,219 --> 00:43:59,400
all.

1775
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:00,730
You made the decision on your own.

1776
00:44:00,730 --> 00:44:01,750
So I just kind of gave you the

1777
00:44:01,750 --> 00:44:02,900
different words to say.

1778
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:03,300
So

1779
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:04,179
props to you, man.

1780
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:05,460
Yeah.

1781
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:06,739
I think that's a great idea to

1782
00:44:06,739 --> 00:44:07,929
like record a video and send it

1783
00:44:07,929 --> 00:44:08,260
over to

1784
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:08,539
him.

1785
00:44:08,539 --> 00:44:09,860
I appreciate that suggestion.

1786
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:10,179
Yeah.

1787
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:12,420
People appreciate honesty and they

1788
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:13,860
also appreciate effort.

1789
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:15,909
Uh, and so I think videos get

1790
00:44:15,909 --> 00:44:17,739
across a lot better because it can

1791
00:44:17,739 --> 00:44:19,780
show like your emotion and like,

1792
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:21,280
it's not just like a typed out

1793
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:23,110
message that can be glossed across

1794
00:44:23,110 --> 00:44:24,099
pretty easily.

1795
00:44:29,219 --> 00:44:30,710
good stuff, dude.

1796
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:31,690
Um, okay.

1797
00:44:31,699 --> 00:44:33,119
So moving on just cause I want to

1798
00:44:33,139 --> 00:44:34,139
make sure we get through

1799
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:36,150
at least the first four phases,

1800
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:37,969
uh, is to hire a client success

1801
00:44:37,969 --> 00:44:38,500
team.

1802
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:40,739
So basically what this is

1803
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:42,510
saying, I mean, there's different

1804
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:44,070
reasons to hire a client success

1805
00:44:44,070 --> 00:44:44,469
team.

1806
00:44:44,469 --> 00:44:46,579
Uh, I think like everyone

1807
00:44:46,659 --> 00:44:48,250
should have a client success team,

1808
00:44:48,250 --> 00:44:49,809
but another reason for this, and

1809
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:51,300
to be honest, part of the reason

1810
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:51,610
why I

1811
00:44:51,699 --> 00:44:53,090
hired a client success team is so

1812
00:44:53,090 --> 00:44:54,449
that I don't have to have these

1813
00:44:54,449 --> 00:44:55,929
difficult conversations with

1814
00:44:55,940 --> 00:44:56,650
clients

1815
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:58,210
because it's just not my strong

1816
00:44:58,210 --> 00:44:58,579
suit.

1817
00:44:58,579 --> 00:44:59,840
It's very similar to sales.

1818
00:44:59,929 --> 00:45:00,900
Like I hate sales.

1819
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:01,539
I never want

1820
00:45:01,619 --> 00:45:02,519
to be on a sales call.

1821
00:45:02,679 --> 00:45:03,980
And so I outsource that to someone

1822
00:45:04,099 --> 00:45:05,300
that's really good at it.

1823
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:06,099
And so it's just

1824
00:45:06,179 --> 00:45:06,809
self-awareness.

1825
00:45:06,809 --> 00:45:08,349
Um, but at the same time, you're

1826
00:45:08,659 --> 00:45:09,679
eventually going to need a client

1827
00:45:09,789 --> 00:45:10,409
success team

1828
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:10,980
either way.

1829
00:45:11,050 --> 00:45:12,519
If you're growing to, you know,

1830
00:45:12,969 --> 00:45:14,000
different levels where you have

1831
00:45:14,019 --> 00:45:15,059
too many clients to manage.

1832
00:45:15,139 --> 00:45:16,929
Um, and the goal of this team,

1833
00:45:17,219 --> 00:45:18,909
like their job is to ensure client

1834
00:45:19,059 --> 00:45:20,019
success, right?

1835
00:45:20,019 --> 00:45:21,139
Just like the job title

1836
00:45:21,219 --> 00:45:23,010
says, uh, and the number one goal

1837
00:45:23,010 --> 00:45:24,690
you should have for your client

1838
00:45:24,690 --> 00:45:26,130
success team is to get

1839
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:27,780
out of email and Slack.

1840
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:29,300
This is so important.

1841
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:31,170
Get out of email and Slack and

1842
00:45:31,170 --> 00:45:32,260
onto phone calls.

1843
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:34,090
And this is why you're, you're

1844
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:35,599
probably going to have to

1845
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:37,860
outsource it because us as

1846
00:45:38,309 --> 00:45:38,949
business owners

1847
00:45:39,219 --> 00:45:40,510
have so much other shit to deal

1848
00:45:40,510 --> 00:45:41,820
with and so much other things

1849
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:43,139
going on that we probably don't

1850
00:45:43,139 --> 00:45:43,380
have

1851
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:44,949
enough time to get on calls with

1852
00:45:44,949 --> 00:45:46,519
all of our clients every week or

1853
00:45:46,519 --> 00:45:48,449
every other week or every month.

1854
00:45:48,739 --> 00:45:49,059
Right.

1855
00:45:49,059 --> 00:45:50,789
And so the whole goal of a client

1856
00:45:51,210 --> 00:45:52,670
success team is so that they could

1857
00:45:52,670 --> 00:45:53,929
get onto calls.

1858
00:45:54,619 --> 00:45:55,059
Um,

1859
00:45:55,139 --> 00:45:56,340
and this is so important.

1860
00:45:56,340 --> 00:45:58,860
So, so important because we're all

1861
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:00,659
really accustomed to using email

1862
00:46:00,659 --> 00:46:01,219
and using

1863
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:01,619
Slack.

1864
00:46:01,619 --> 00:46:03,210
And it's similar to what I was

1865
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:05,079
just telling Avery, but there's a

1866
00:46:05,219 --> 00:46:06,980
big difference between text

1867
00:46:07,699 --> 00:46:08,320
and calling.

1868
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:09,139
Right.

1869
00:46:09,139 --> 00:46:10,380
It's just like, if you were going

1870
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:11,780
to break up with a girl and like,

1871
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:12,590
are you going to text her or

1872
00:46:12,699 --> 00:46:13,539
you're going to call her?

1873
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:15,619
Like what's more respectful?

1874
00:46:15,619 --> 00:46:16,340
What's the right

1875
00:46:16,420 --> 00:46:16,900
thing to do?

1876
00:46:16,949 --> 00:46:18,210
Uh, it's pretty obvious.

1877
00:46:18,469 --> 00:46:18,630
Right.

1878
00:46:18,630 --> 00:46:19,719
And it's the same thing in

1879
00:46:19,719 --> 00:46:20,420
business.

1880
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:21,139
And the reason is

1881
00:46:21,219 --> 00:46:22,949
because tone often gets

1882
00:46:22,949 --> 00:46:25,219
misinterpreted through text.

1883
00:46:25,219 --> 00:46:27,539
You, and, and we're all guilty of

1884
00:46:27,539 --> 00:46:28,260
this and we all do

1885
00:46:28,340 --> 00:46:29,349
this probably every day.

1886
00:46:29,349 --> 00:46:30,530
Like you get an important text

1887
00:46:30,559 --> 00:46:31,780
from a client or a client sends

1888
00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:32,340
you a message

1889
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:33,570
and they're frustrated.

1890
00:46:33,570 --> 00:46:35,210
Like, Hey, like you're not getting

1891
00:46:35,210 --> 00:46:37,059
the results and you read that.

1892
00:46:37,059 --> 00:46:37,409
And it's

1893
00:46:37,539 --> 00:46:39,079
probably right in a very different

1894
00:46:39,079 --> 00:46:40,590
way than they had intended for it

1895
00:46:40,590 --> 00:46:42,489
to be interpreted.

1896
00:46:42,489 --> 00:46:43,619
And so it helps

1897
00:46:43,699 --> 00:46:45,619
to just get on a call rather than

1898
00:46:45,820 --> 00:46:47,469
overanalyzing text and just

1899
00:46:47,469 --> 00:46:49,460
written word, obviously like

1900
00:46:49,909 --> 00:46:50,099
there's

1901
00:46:50,179 --> 00:46:51,559
the time and place for email and

1902
00:46:51,559 --> 00:46:53,119
Slack, and you're still going to

1903
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:55,059
use it a whole lot, but be sure to

1904
00:46:55,139 --> 00:46:56,769
implement calls with clients

1905
00:46:56,769 --> 00:46:57,309
often.

1906
00:46:57,309 --> 00:46:59,170
Uh, cause if you don't, there's

1907
00:46:59,170 --> 00:47:01,139
going to be tone that gets

1908
00:47:01,219 --> 00:47:02,760
misinterpreted that can lead to

1909
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:03,840
confusion, um, and

1910
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:05,699
misunderstandings, which can lead

1911
00:47:05,699 --> 00:47:06,420
to churn,

1912
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:07,590
which is the worst way to lose a

1913
00:47:07,590 --> 00:47:08,099
client.

1914
00:47:08,619 --> 00:47:12,070
That's an important concept that,

1915
00:47:12,070 --> 00:47:12,659
uh,

1916
00:47:12,730 --> 00:47:14,199
I just want to make sure got

1917
00:47:14,199 --> 00:47:16,380
across.

1918
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:20,420
Good.

1919
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:23,460
How would you go about, um,

1920
00:47:25,139 --> 00:47:27,559
I guess differentiating client

1921
00:47:27,619 --> 00:47:30,070
success manager versus project

1922
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:34,260
manager when your primary service

1923
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:36,420
provision is one time?

1924
00:47:36,469 --> 00:47:36,800
Yeah.

1925
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:38,420
So I think for you, Scott, like

1926
00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:40,579
this is not a role you need to

1927
00:47:40,599 --> 00:47:40,889
hire

1928
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:42,840
for, but a responsibility that you

1929
00:47:43,030 --> 00:47:44,389
can add onto what the project

1930
00:47:44,389 --> 00:47:45,619
manager is doing.

1931
00:47:45,619 --> 00:47:46,190
Right.

1932
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:47,380
So it,

1933
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:49,119
it doesn't have to be its own

1934
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:49,699
role.

1935
00:47:49,699 --> 00:47:51,239
It could be a lot of people refer

1936
00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:53,300
to client success managers as

1937
00:47:53,380 --> 00:47:55,050
project managers or account

1938
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:55,849
managers.

1939
00:47:55,860 --> 00:47:58,150
So it's, it's more so the actual

1940
00:47:58,150 --> 00:47:59,619
responsibility

1941
00:47:59,699 --> 00:48:01,449
of getting on calls and

1942
00:48:02,179 --> 00:48:03,929
communicating with clients.

1943
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:06,659
And it's easy for a project

1944
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,539
manager since they're, they're

1945
00:48:08,539 --> 00:48:10,019
really accustomed to what the

1946
00:48:10,019 --> 00:48:10,579
project is

1947
00:48:10,659 --> 00:48:11,059
anyways.

1948
00:48:11,059 --> 00:48:12,050
And so they can have those

1949
00:48:12,050 --> 00:48:12,730
communities.

1950
00:48:12,789 --> 00:48:14,159
They can have those conversations

1951
00:48:14,269 --> 00:48:15,610
in an intelligent

1952
00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:16,559
way.

1953
00:48:16,929 --> 00:48:18,860
Um, and I think that's the hardest

1954
00:48:18,860 --> 00:48:20,599
thing for people is to find client

1955
00:48:20,599 --> 00:48:21,780
success managers that

1956
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:22,969
actually understand the work that

1957
00:48:22,969 --> 00:48:24,030
you're doing, because if they

1958
00:48:24,030 --> 00:48:25,300
don't understand the work you're

1959
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:26,719
doing, your client's going to have

1960
00:48:26,719 --> 00:48:27,940
a conversation with them.

1961
00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:28,889
They're going to notice that they

1962
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:29,159
have no

1963
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:30,369
idea what's going on and they're

1964
00:48:30,369 --> 00:48:31,260
going to ask to talk to you

1965
00:48:31,420 --> 00:48:31,769
instead.

1966
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:33,539
And so that's like the number

1967
00:48:33,699 --> 00:48:35,300
one pain point with people hiring

1968
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:35,960
this role.

1969
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:37,480
So I think, uh, actually doing

1970
00:48:37,619 --> 00:48:38,340
what Scott did

1971
00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:40,480
is a, is a really good strategy is

1972
00:48:40,550 --> 00:48:42,579
to find someone that's already

1973
00:48:42,579 --> 00:48:43,630
somewhat involved in these

1974
00:48:44,579 --> 00:48:44,969
campaigns.

1975
00:48:45,059 --> 00:48:46,119
And they understand the work

1976
00:48:46,119 --> 00:48:47,530
that's going on with these clients

1977
00:48:47,539 --> 00:48:49,289
and either make them a client

1978
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:49,699
success

1979
00:48:49,780 --> 00:48:51,250
manager or give them these client

1980
00:48:51,250 --> 00:48:53,139
success manager responsibilities.

1981
00:48:53,139 --> 00:48:55,619
It's very simple.

1982
00:48:56,039 --> 00:48:56,179
Just,

1983
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:57,510
it could be as simple as adding a

1984
00:48:57,510 --> 00:49:00,039
weekly call or adding a call, uh,

1985
00:49:00,179 --> 00:49:02,019
an alignment call one week into

1986
00:49:02,099 --> 00:49:02,730
the project.

1987
00:49:03,059 --> 00:49:04,630
They're adding, um, an exit

1988
00:49:04,630 --> 00:49:05,840
interview.

1989
00:49:05,849 --> 00:49:08,179
Uh, we do an exit interview

1990
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:09,860
anytime we churn a client

1991
00:49:10,019 --> 00:49:11,449
and it's just an opportunity for

1992
00:49:11,449 --> 00:49:12,949
us to understand why that client

1993
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:14,900
churned, uh, which most of the

1994
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:15,460
time is just

1995
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:17,519
stupid reasons that we could then

1996
00:49:17,519 --> 00:49:18,800
resolve on the call and actually

1997
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:20,420
end up retaining the client,

1998
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:21,750
which is pretty funny.

1999
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:23,599
Um, and then if it is a real

2000
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:25,059
reason, we can figure it out and

2001
00:49:25,059 --> 00:49:25,500
we could improve

2002
00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:27,539
based on that conversation.

2003
00:49:27,539 --> 00:49:29,380
So like calls are so important.

2004
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:32,420
Um, and Scott, you could even have

2005
00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:32,539
a

2006
00:49:32,659 --> 00:49:33,769
project manager.

2007
00:49:33,769 --> 00:49:35,239
As soon as you deliver the

2008
00:49:35,239 --> 00:49:37,269
project, you can say, Hey, uh,

2009
00:49:37,269 --> 00:49:38,340
this is great.

2010
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:39,269
Everything's

2011
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:39,800
good.

2012
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:41,489
You know, go and use this however

2013
00:49:41,579 --> 00:49:42,340
you intended.

2014
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:44,099
It'd be great if we could set up a

2015
00:49:44,099 --> 00:49:44,500
call,

2016
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:46,590
a check-in call 90 days from now,

2017
00:49:46,710 --> 00:49:48,230
just so I can get an idea for how

2018
00:49:48,230 --> 00:49:49,559
you end up using the video

2019
00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:51,170
and how it worked for you.

2020
00:49:51,170 --> 00:49:52,739
And that call could be actually

2021
00:49:52,739 --> 00:49:54,099
part of your sales process

2022
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:55,980
because you can basically pitch

2023
00:49:55,980 --> 00:49:58,019
them another video at that point.

2024
00:49:58,099 --> 00:49:58,340
Yeah.

2025
00:49:58,340 --> 00:49:59,570
I should, I should do, I should do

2026
00:49:59,570 --> 00:49:59,860
that.

2027
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:01,880
Like a quarter delayed exit

2028
00:50:02,010 --> 00:50:02,579
interview.

2029
00:50:02,659 --> 00:50:03,280
Yeah.

2030
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:06,289
Or just a check, just a status

2031
00:50:06,289 --> 00:50:06,739
call.

2032
00:50:06,739 --> 00:50:08,309
Like how, how did the video work

2033
00:50:08,309 --> 00:50:08,659
for you?

2034
00:50:08,659 --> 00:50:08,820
I'm,

2035
00:50:08,889 --> 00:50:10,699
I'm just curious to know how you

2036
00:50:10,989 --> 00:50:11,349
used it.

2037
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:12,900
Uh, what is the feedback that you

2038
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:13,809
got on it?

2039
00:50:13,940 --> 00:50:15,269
And it's just an easy way for you

2040
00:50:15,269 --> 00:50:16,260
to have like that open

2041
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:17,710
conversation, that continued

2042
00:50:17,860 --> 00:50:18,179
conversation

2043
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:18,820
with clients.

2044
00:50:18,820 --> 00:50:23,409
Um, yeah, so that, that's, uh, all

2045
00:50:23,409 --> 00:50:25,019
about conversation.

2046
00:50:25,239 --> 00:50:26,409
The other big thing

2047
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:29,380
about all of this is not to let

2048
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:30,739
emotions fly.

2049
00:50:30,949 --> 00:50:33,780
Um, I think like a lot of times,

2050
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:35,460
especially early on,

2051
00:50:35,539 --> 00:50:37,159
and especially for us, like

2052
00:50:37,610 --> 00:50:39,019
smaller agency owners where we're

2053
00:50:39,030 --> 00:50:40,500
doing a lot of the work and it's a

2054
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:42,780
representation of like who we are,

2055
00:50:43,059 --> 00:50:44,820
negative feedback can be really

2056
00:50:45,030 --> 00:50:46,820
like emotionally damaging

2057
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:48,159
to an agency owner.

2058
00:50:48,159 --> 00:50:50,170
And so my biggest piece of advice

2059
00:50:50,170 --> 00:50:52,500
is not to take things personally.

2060
00:50:52,579 --> 00:50:53,570
Like usually when a client is

2061
00:50:53,570 --> 00:50:54,780
complaining, it's a reflection of

2062
00:50:55,059 --> 00:50:56,019
something that's going on in their

2063
00:50:56,099 --> 00:50:57,360
business that actually has nothing

2064
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:58,019
to do with you.

2065
00:50:58,190 --> 00:50:59,210
And even if it's about your

2066
00:50:59,250 --> 00:51:01,050
service, that's not

2067
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:01,699
you.

2068
00:51:01,699 --> 00:51:03,050
That's your service.

2069
00:51:03,050 --> 00:51:04,559
So separate business from

2070
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:05,309
personal.

2071
00:51:05,309 --> 00:51:06,590
Uh, because a lot of times agency

2072
00:51:07,139 --> 00:51:09,000
owners get really discouraged and

2073
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:10,610
depressed because they take

2074
00:51:10,610 --> 00:51:12,110
negative feedback as a negative

2075
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:12,820
mark on

2076
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:13,920
who they are as a person.

2077
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:15,139
And that's never the case.

2078
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:17,460
Super important.

2079
00:51:19,539 --> 00:51:21,130
Um, a few more things here.

2080
00:51:21,130 --> 00:51:23,170
So ongoing management, you always

2081
00:51:23,170 --> 00:51:24,500
want to over deliver.

2082
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:26,139
Uh, if you could

2083
00:51:26,260 --> 00:51:28,320
kind of hold back certain pieces

2084
00:51:28,389 --> 00:51:30,460
of your offer and drip them out as

2085
00:51:30,469 --> 00:51:33,139
surprises or bonuses, that's a

2086
00:51:33,219 --> 00:51:34,030
great strategy.

2087
00:51:34,219 --> 00:51:36,079
Uh, so we do that by educating our

2088
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:38,139
clients and building community.

2089
00:51:38,139 --> 00:51:39,139
So that's not really

2090
00:51:39,219 --> 00:51:40,090
part of our offer.

2091
00:51:40,309 --> 00:51:41,530
Like people come to work with us

2092
00:51:41,639 --> 00:51:43,869
to do cold email campaigns, but we

2093
00:51:43,869 --> 00:51:45,300
add bonuses

2094
00:51:45,380 --> 00:51:47,260
in value to help them with other

2095
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:49,150
areas in their business through

2096
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:52,260
training, sharing our learnings

2097
00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:54,159
and weekly emails, newsletter

2098
00:51:54,460 --> 00:51:56,099
style emails, super simple.

2099
00:51:56,099 --> 00:51:57,289
So think of ways you can over

2100
00:51:57,780 --> 00:51:57,780
deliver

2101
00:51:57,860 --> 00:51:59,530
outside of what you're doing with

2102
00:51:59,530 --> 00:52:00,409
your service.

2103
00:52:00,409 --> 00:52:01,949
Um, it could even be one thing

2104
00:52:01,949 --> 00:52:02,869
that I've seen people

2105
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:06,000
do here is, uh, sending books to

2106
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,989
their clients, sending, um, gifts

2107
00:52:08,989 --> 00:52:12,199
to their clients, uh, sending

2108
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:13,570
thank you letters to their

2109
00:52:13,570 --> 00:52:15,190
clients, just what are different

2110
00:52:15,190 --> 00:52:17,059
personal touch points you can add

2111
00:52:17,139 --> 00:52:18,739
to show that you really care and

2112
00:52:18,739 --> 00:52:20,550
that you want to, you know, uh,

2113
00:52:20,550 --> 00:52:21,780
impress your clients.

2114
00:52:21,860 --> 00:52:24,900
Events, right.

2115
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:26,099
It's something we're doing with

2116
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:27,219
client ascension events.

2117
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:29,139
Stuff like that.

2118
00:52:29,139 --> 00:52:29,940
What do you do, Andre?

2119
00:52:30,019 --> 00:52:32,440
Uh, this is what we do at our

2120
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:33,460
agency.

2121
00:52:33,460 --> 00:52:35,230
So for the most part at knowledge

2122
00:52:35,989 --> 00:52:37,619
X, at least we just

2123
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:39,969
bury them in training.

2124
00:52:39,969 --> 00:52:41,170
Uh, so the nice thing with

2125
00:52:41,380 --> 00:52:42,679
knowledge X is we work with agency

2126
00:52:42,820 --> 00:52:43,130
owners

2127
00:52:43,219 --> 00:52:45,000
and they come to us for cold

2128
00:52:45,340 --> 00:52:45,679
email.

2129
00:52:45,699 --> 00:52:47,719
And what happens is when we do

2130
00:52:47,719 --> 00:52:50,420
cold email, it just shines light

2131
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:50,500
on

2132
00:52:50,579 --> 00:52:51,849
the fact that they need help with

2133
00:52:51,849 --> 00:52:52,250
sales.

2134
00:52:52,250 --> 00:52:53,510
And then if they do a good enough

2135
00:52:53,610 --> 00:52:54,659
job with sales, it shines

2136
00:52:54,739 --> 00:52:55,820
light on the fact that they need

2137
00:52:55,820 --> 00:52:56,940
help with fulfillment and all

2138
00:52:57,159 --> 00:52:58,099
these different parts of the

2139
00:52:58,099 --> 00:52:58,519
agency.

2140
00:52:58,659 --> 00:53:00,469
And so we just help them with each

2141
00:53:00,469 --> 00:53:02,309
of those parts because we have

2142
00:53:02,309 --> 00:53:03,300
experience.

2143
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:03,940
We have client

2144
00:53:04,019 --> 00:53:05,710
ascension, which coaches people to

2145
00:53:05,710 --> 00:53:06,630
do these things.

2146
00:53:06,630 --> 00:53:08,210
So we just train the shit out of

2147
00:53:08,219 --> 00:53:08,500
them

2148
00:53:08,579 --> 00:53:09,659
when they didn't even pay us for

2149
00:53:09,659 --> 00:53:10,659
training to begin with.

2150
00:53:10,710 --> 00:53:11,940
They just paid us for cold email

2151
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:12,420
strategy.

2152
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:15,420
And, and that could be different

2153
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:16,980
for everyone.

2154
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:17,300
Right.

2155
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:18,820
And then we also have community

2156
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:19,219
another,

2157
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:20,420
oh, this is a great one.

2158
00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:23,309
The, so for us, we do a power

2159
00:53:23,309 --> 00:53:24,219
intros.

2160
00:53:24,570 --> 00:53:26,250
So because we work with so many

2161
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:28,139
agency owners, chances are like we

2162
00:53:28,449 --> 00:53:29,820
could make some really powerful

2163
00:53:29,829 --> 00:53:31,329
connections within our own

2164
00:53:31,329 --> 00:53:32,340
network.

2165
00:53:32,420 --> 00:53:34,019
So some of the guys on this call

2166
00:53:34,019 --> 00:53:35,699
might've experienced this.

2167
00:53:35,699 --> 00:53:36,670
I think I I've done a few

2168
00:53:36,820 --> 00:53:38,300
for Oliver where I've connected

2169
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:39,760
him with some of my clients where

2170
00:53:39,849 --> 00:53:41,059
it made sense.

2171
00:53:41,269 --> 00:53:42,500
And that goes a long

2172
00:53:42,579 --> 00:53:43,900
way because you can help, you

2173
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:45,190
know, cultivate business

2174
00:53:45,190 --> 00:53:46,809
relationships with your clients

2175
00:53:46,820 --> 00:53:47,139
and other

2176
00:53:47,219 --> 00:53:48,679
people in your network.

2177
00:53:48,679 --> 00:53:50,739
Uh, and, and for you too, Lucas,

2178
00:53:50,829 --> 00:53:52,420
like this is something you do

2179
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:52,900
email

2180
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:54,840
marketing, build connections with

2181
00:53:55,099 --> 00:53:56,480
other e-commerce agencies that

2182
00:53:56,519 --> 00:53:58,179
have complimentary services.

2183
00:53:58,260 --> 00:53:59,940
Cause most likely if someone's

2184
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:01,769
using you for email marketing,

2185
00:54:01,869 --> 00:54:02,739
they might be looking

2186
00:54:02,820 --> 00:54:04,099
or needing someone to help with

2187
00:54:04,099 --> 00:54:05,400
Facebook ads or TikTok ads.

2188
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:07,050
And if you could be the person

2189
00:54:07,139 --> 00:54:08,440
that introduces them to that

2190
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:10,380
person that does it, you're now

2191
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:13,139
way more valuable to that client.

2192
00:54:17,219 --> 00:54:18,420
Zach give you some ideas.

2193
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:20,969
Yeah, yeah, no, for sure.

2194
00:54:20,969 --> 00:54:21,300
Thank you.

2195
00:54:21,380 --> 00:54:21,800
Sick.

2196
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:23,289
Uh, of course, dude.

2197
00:54:23,429 --> 00:54:24,070
So, okay.

2198
00:54:24,070 --> 00:54:25,940
Last thing here, expectations

2199
00:54:25,940 --> 00:54:27,619
versus actual results.

2200
00:54:27,699 --> 00:54:29,150
This is probably the most

2201
00:54:29,809 --> 00:54:31,199
important question on the entire

2202
00:54:31,219 --> 00:54:32,420
document when it comes to client

2203
00:54:32,420 --> 00:54:33,539
retention is

2204
00:54:33,619 --> 00:54:34,730
getting an answer to how is your

2205
00:54:34,730 --> 00:54:35,940
client measuring success.

2206
00:54:36,099 --> 00:54:39,150
Uh, and a really easy way to ask a

2207
00:54:39,619 --> 00:54:39,699
client,

2208
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:41,590
this is like, what does success

2209
00:54:41,869 --> 00:54:43,559
look like for you in 30 days or in

2210
00:54:43,690 --> 00:54:45,460
60 days or in 90 days?

2211
00:54:45,539 --> 00:54:46,710
And then it gives you something to

2212
00:54:46,710 --> 00:54:47,380
work towards.

2213
00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:49,269
Um, and a lot of the times what

2214
00:54:49,269 --> 00:54:49,860
happens,

2215
00:54:49,940 --> 00:54:52,190
uh, this is the thing, like we'll

2216
00:54:52,420 --> 00:54:54,500
sometimes get on an alignment call

2217
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:55,300
and we'll ask this question,

2218
00:54:55,380 --> 00:54:56,579
like, Hey, what does success look

2219
00:54:56,579 --> 00:54:57,219
like for you?

2220
00:54:57,219 --> 00:54:58,170
And they'll be like, Hey, I want

2221
00:54:58,170 --> 00:54:59,059
to get 20 calls a

2222
00:54:59,139 --> 00:54:59,409
month.

2223
00:54:59,409 --> 00:55:00,469
And I'll be like, Hey, to be

2224
00:55:00,469 --> 00:55:01,679
honest, it's just not possible

2225
00:55:01,679 --> 00:55:02,500
with our service.

2226
00:55:02,579 --> 00:55:04,500
What we can do is get five really

2227
00:55:04,699 --> 00:55:06,360
good ones, focus on those.

2228
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:07,530
And if it makes sense, we can

2229
00:55:07,530 --> 00:55:07,570
scale

2230
00:55:07,860 --> 00:55:10,139
it up to 20 and it's just getting

2231
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:11,360
on the same page.

2232
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:12,590
And now that we set that

2233
00:55:12,590 --> 00:55:12,840
expectation

2234
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:14,980
and if determine what success

2235
00:55:14,980 --> 00:55:16,590
looks like, there's not any

2236
00:55:16,590 --> 00:55:17,860
friction later on.

2237
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:19,460
Okay.

2238
00:55:19,460 --> 00:55:22,179
Uh, so how's your client measuring

2239
00:55:22,389 --> 00:55:23,139
success?

2240
00:55:23,139 --> 00:55:23,940
Super random.

2241
00:55:23,940 --> 00:55:24,579
I don't know why I thought of

2242
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:24,880
this,

2243
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:26,650
but Scott, like when you set a

2244
00:55:27,099 --> 00:55:28,500
timeline for people that order a

2245
00:55:28,590 --> 00:55:29,929
video from you, you should

2246
00:55:30,019 --> 00:55:31,949
tell them like 14 days and always

2247
00:55:32,239 --> 00:55:33,449
deliver it within seven.

2248
00:55:33,449 --> 00:55:34,969
And I think that the satisfaction

2249
00:55:35,380 --> 00:55:36,019
that people

2250
00:55:36,099 --> 00:55:37,619
have after working with you

2251
00:55:38,219 --> 00:55:39,150
instantly boost for, yeah, I've

2252
00:55:39,150 --> 00:55:41,090
been, I've been, uh, I used to

2253
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:41,380
tell

2254
00:55:41,460 --> 00:55:42,989
people like a week and a half or

2255
00:55:42,989 --> 00:55:43,699
some shit.

2256
00:55:43,699 --> 00:55:45,690
I tell them like three weeks now.

2257
00:55:45,699 --> 00:55:48,409
Um, and then the script

2258
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:50,559
is delivered within like a day and

2259
00:55:50,619 --> 00:55:52,630
a half preview frames are done in

2260
00:55:52,630 --> 00:55:53,860
like four days.

2261
00:55:53,860 --> 00:55:54,260
And then the

2262
00:55:54,340 --> 00:55:55,869
video is done like a week after

2263
00:55:55,869 --> 00:55:56,340
that.

2264
00:55:56,460 --> 00:55:58,349
So it's probably like half the

2265
00:55:58,349 --> 00:56:00,659
time, like including revisions,

2266
00:56:00,739 --> 00:56:02,030
it's usually three weeks, but

2267
00:56:02,030 --> 00:56:03,559
that's like their, their fault,

2268
00:56:03,559 --> 00:56:04,179
you know?

2269
00:56:04,179 --> 00:56:04,519
Yeah.

2270
00:56:04,659 --> 00:56:05,460
So we're actually

2271
00:56:05,539 --> 00:56:07,380
delivering within like half the

2272
00:56:07,659 --> 00:56:08,610
time we tell them.

2273
00:56:08,610 --> 00:56:09,719
So, okay, great.

2274
00:56:09,719 --> 00:56:10,900
I don't know why I thought of

2275
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:11,139
that,

2276
00:56:11,219 --> 00:56:13,300
but anyways, good stuff.

2277
00:56:13,349 --> 00:56:15,190
You're on it as always.

2278
00:56:15,190 --> 00:56:17,619
Um, so yeah, get very clear on how

2279
00:56:17,619 --> 00:56:18,099
is your client

2280
00:56:18,179 --> 00:56:19,300
measuring success.

2281
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:21,079
Uh, so for like a Klaviyo agency,

2282
00:56:21,079 --> 00:56:22,590
they might be looking for a

2283
00:56:22,630 --> 00:56:23,389
specific boost

2284
00:56:23,860 --> 00:56:25,420
and email revenue, uh, for a lead

2285
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:26,099
gen agency.

2286
00:56:26,329 --> 00:56:27,340
They might be looking for a

2287
00:56:27,349 --> 00:56:28,739
specific amount of leads,

2288
00:56:28,820 --> 00:56:30,599
uh, for a content posting agency.

2289
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:31,909
They might be looking for a

2290
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:33,059
certain amount of followers

2291
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:34,539
that they want to gain every

2292
00:56:34,539 --> 00:56:36,230
month, figure out what that is.

2293
00:56:36,329 --> 00:56:36,739
Right.

2294
00:56:36,739 --> 00:56:38,289
And that'll allow you to actually

2295
00:56:38,659 --> 00:56:40,139
come up with a strategy that's

2296
00:56:40,139 --> 00:56:41,599
aligned with what they see as

2297
00:56:41,690 --> 00:56:42,440
successful.

2298
00:56:42,579 --> 00:56:44,579
And again, a lot of the times

2299
00:56:44,659 --> 00:56:46,130
it's not just, Oh, they want 20

2300
00:56:46,130 --> 00:56:46,829
calls booked.

2301
00:56:46,829 --> 00:56:48,159
Let me figure out how to get 20

2302
00:56:48,260 --> 00:56:48,900
calls booked.

2303
00:56:49,110 --> 00:56:49,380
It's like,

2304
00:56:49,460 --> 00:56:51,150
no, I have to realign expectations

2305
00:56:51,150 --> 00:56:52,710
and let them know we can only get

2306
00:56:52,710 --> 00:56:54,449
five and make sure that they're

2307
00:56:54,579 --> 00:56:56,679
still content with getting five.

2308
00:56:56,710 --> 00:56:58,639
And then I'll give them a roadmap

2309
00:56:58,639 --> 00:57:00,500
to scale up to 20, but they need

2310
00:57:00,659 --> 00:57:00,659
to

2311
00:57:00,739 --> 00:57:02,429
understand first that we could

2312
00:57:02,429 --> 00:57:04,230
only get five and they got to make

2313
00:57:04,239 --> 00:57:05,690
sure that that's okay.

2314
00:57:05,780 --> 00:57:06,980
Cause a lot

2315
00:57:07,059 --> 00:57:08,260
of the times will happen is you

2316
00:57:08,260 --> 00:57:09,500
could get five calls and then

2317
00:57:09,539 --> 00:57:11,059
they're like, yeah, we want to get

2318
00:57:11,059 --> 00:57:11,380
20.

2319
00:57:11,460 --> 00:57:12,269
And it's like, okay, sick.

2320
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:13,389
Let's see if we could get really

2321
00:57:13,550 --> 00:57:15,219
good results then let's aim for 20

2322
00:57:15,380 --> 00:57:15,619
and

2323
00:57:15,699 --> 00:57:17,230
guaranteed you fall short of that

2324
00:57:17,230 --> 00:57:18,639
they're pissed off because you

2325
00:57:18,730 --> 00:57:20,179
were enthusiastic when they ran

2326
00:57:20,260 --> 00:57:21,329
it by you in the first place.

2327
00:57:21,329 --> 00:57:22,739
Whereas if you said, no, we can't,

2328
00:57:22,739 --> 00:57:23,619
we could get five.

2329
00:57:23,619 --> 00:57:24,340
And then if we get

2330
00:57:24,420 --> 00:57:25,219
five, we could focus on getting

2331
00:57:25,469 --> 00:57:25,860
10.

2332
00:57:25,860 --> 00:57:27,079
And then if we get 10, we could

2333
00:57:27,079 --> 00:57:27,760
focus on 15.

2334
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:28,670
They're going to stay

2335
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:29,940
with you each step of the way.

2336
00:57:29,940 --> 00:57:33,460
A lot of information today, guys.

2337
00:57:33,460 --> 00:57:33,809
Fuck.

2338
00:57:33,809 --> 00:57:34,340
All right.

2339
00:57:34,699 --> 00:57:35,769
Last few things.

2340
00:57:35,820 --> 00:57:36,179
So

2341
00:57:36,260 --> 00:57:37,659
expectations versus actual

2342
00:57:37,659 --> 00:57:38,269
results.

2343
00:57:38,699 --> 00:57:39,929
Another way to do this is first

2344
00:57:39,929 --> 00:57:41,239
figure out how are clients

2345
00:57:41,239 --> 00:57:41,469
measuring

2346
00:57:42,099 --> 00:57:44,260
success and then give them updates

2347
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:46,250
on where you're at in regards to

2348
00:57:46,250 --> 00:57:48,019
that every single week.

2349
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:48,980
So weekly

2350
00:57:49,059 --> 00:57:50,610
recap messages are a really

2351
00:57:51,179 --> 00:57:52,219
effective way to do this.

2352
00:57:52,219 --> 00:57:54,050
Really practical for our lead gen

2353
00:57:54,050 --> 00:57:54,739
agency.

2354
00:57:54,820 --> 00:57:56,260
Every week we'll give them an

2355
00:57:56,260 --> 00:57:57,659
update on how many leads we

2356
00:57:57,659 --> 00:57:58,500
generated.

2357
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:00,260
So if their goal is 10 leads a

2358
00:58:00,340 --> 00:58:01,789
month and they see this week, we

2359
00:58:01,789 --> 00:58:03,429
got four leads, they know we're on

2360
00:58:03,429 --> 00:58:03,849
track.

2361
00:58:03,949 --> 00:58:05,139
Or if this week they saw we

2362
00:58:05,219 --> 00:58:06,639
got one lead, they know we're

2363
00:58:06,639 --> 00:58:08,260
falling behind and we could then

2364
00:58:08,260 --> 00:58:10,019
shift our attention towards what

2365
00:58:10,019 --> 00:58:10,210
needs to

2366
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:12,159
happen to get back on track,

2367
00:58:12,539 --> 00:58:12,769
right?

2368
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:14,980
Weekly cadences for messages.

2369
00:58:14,980 --> 00:58:15,940
And then live calls.

2370
00:58:16,019 --> 00:58:17,920
So there's different types of live

2371
00:58:18,139 --> 00:58:19,380
calls you can do at an agency.

2372
00:58:19,380 --> 00:58:20,969
You could do check-in calls.

2373
00:58:21,059 --> 00:58:22,139
You could do alignment calls like

2374
00:58:22,139 --> 00:58:23,139
we talked about earlier.

2375
00:58:23,190 --> 00:58:24,260
You could do a training call.

2376
00:58:24,340 --> 00:58:25,800
And you can do audit calls to

2377
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:27,699
really figure out what's going on

2378
00:58:27,699 --> 00:58:29,320
with campaigns and what you might

2379
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:30,090
need to pivot on.

2380
00:58:30,269 --> 00:58:32,389
I went through this super fast

2381
00:58:32,489 --> 00:58:34,809
just because I want to cover phase

2382
00:58:34,809 --> 00:58:36,260
four on this call.

2383
00:58:36,340 --> 00:58:37,579
And then I'll send you guys the

2384
00:58:37,579 --> 00:58:39,019
lesson in the learning platform

2385
00:58:39,019 --> 00:58:39,860
about phase five.

2386
00:58:39,940 --> 00:58:51,480
All right.

2387
00:58:51,670 --> 00:58:53,340
Let me just wrap up phase four and

2388
00:58:53,340 --> 00:58:54,340
then we could do any last

2389
00:58:54,340 --> 00:58:54,980
questions.

2390
00:58:54,980 --> 00:58:55,860
So phase four is

2391
00:58:55,940 --> 00:58:57,219
all about raising your prices.

2392
00:58:57,219 --> 00:58:58,880
So if you've successfully retained

2393
00:58:58,969 --> 00:59:00,420
clients up to this point

2394
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:02,039
pretty consistently, it's time to

2395
00:59:02,039 --> 00:59:03,059
raise your prices.

2396
00:59:03,059 --> 00:59:05,190
And most people just raise their

2397
00:59:05,190 --> 00:59:06,340
prices and that's

2398
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:06,500
it.

2399
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:07,739
Like they just think raising their

2400
00:59:07,739 --> 00:59:09,210
prices is all of a sudden going to

2401
00:59:09,210 --> 00:59:10,579
attract like higher quality

2402
00:59:10,659 --> 00:59:12,570
clients and nothing has to change

2403
00:59:12,780 --> 00:59:13,989
other than the price.

2404
00:59:13,989 --> 00:59:15,610
And that's just not true.

2405
00:59:15,829 --> 00:59:16,420
You have to be able

2406
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:18,230
to justify the price increase,

2407
00:59:18,570 --> 00:59:18,820
right?

2408
00:59:18,980 --> 00:59:20,960
Part of the justification is the

2409
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:21,940
fact that clients are

2410
00:59:22,019 --> 00:59:23,199
actually retaining, meaning

2411
00:59:23,199 --> 00:59:24,440
they're getting the value from

2412
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:25,219
your service.

2413
00:59:25,219 --> 00:59:26,179
So that's part of it.

2414
00:59:27,219 --> 00:59:28,360
But the other part of it is how

2415
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:29,650
can you make your service more

2416
00:59:29,699 --> 00:59:31,449
valuable, right?

2417
00:59:31,460 --> 00:59:32,420
And so, I mean,

2418
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:34,659
Avery honestly could go and raise

2419
00:59:34,900 --> 00:59:36,500
his prices and justify it by

2420
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:38,260
saying we invested in new

2421
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:39,449
education or new

2422
00:59:39,539 --> 00:59:42,039
information to make our services,

2423
00:59:42,039 --> 00:59:44,489
our team, our tech stack better by

2424
00:59:44,489 --> 00:59:47,219
learning from other agency owners,

2425
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:47,750
right?

2426
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:49,500
So if you're going to raise your

2427
00:59:49,780 --> 00:59:51,780
prices, use that additional money,

2428
00:59:51,780 --> 00:59:53,380
that additional cash flow

2429
00:59:53,460 --> 00:59:54,940
to invest in making your service

2430
00:59:54,940 --> 00:59:56,329
more valuable and worth more

2431
00:59:56,329 --> 00:59:56,900
money.

2432
00:59:56,900 --> 00:59:58,019
It's something that

2433
00:59:58,099 --> 01:00:00,320
everyone forgets and nobody talks

2434
01:00:00,579 --> 01:00:00,980
about.

2435
01:00:00,980 --> 01:00:02,789
Everyone just says raise your

2436
01:00:02,789 --> 01:00:04,099
prices and that's the end of

2437
01:00:04,179 --> 01:00:04,469
it.

2438
01:00:04,469 --> 01:00:05,780
It's not the case.

2439
01:00:05,780 --> 01:00:07,280
The reason raising your prices

2440
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:07,829
works.

2441
01:00:07,829 --> 01:00:09,179
And if you want to raise your

2442
01:00:09,860 --> 01:00:09,940
prices and

2443
01:00:10,019 --> 01:00:11,559
never have to lower your prices

2444
01:00:11,559 --> 01:00:12,960
after the fact and do this,

2445
01:00:13,050 --> 01:00:14,820
because I've seen plenty of times

2446
01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:14,969
where

2447
01:00:15,059 --> 01:00:16,530
people raise their prices and they

2448
01:00:16,530 --> 01:00:17,960
don't do anything after the fact

2449
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:19,289
and they initially and then they

2450
01:00:19,300 --> 01:00:19,539
then

2451
01:00:19,619 --> 01:00:20,659
have to put their prices down

2452
01:00:20,659 --> 01:00:21,059
again.

2453
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:24,019
For us, our agency,

2454
01:00:24,099 --> 01:00:26,769
our lead gen agency in the past

2455
01:00:26,769 --> 01:00:30,260
year alone went from charging $600

2456
01:00:30,349 --> 01:00:33,940
a month to $800 a month to $1,100

2457
01:00:33,940 --> 01:00:34,019
a

2458
01:00:34,099 --> 01:00:37,380
month to $1,500 a month to $2,500

2459
01:00:37,380 --> 01:00:37,860
a month.

2460
01:00:37,860 --> 01:00:39,300
And then today we raised it to

2461
01:00:39,300 --> 01:00:40,980
$3,000 a month and our service

2462
01:00:41,059 --> 01:00:42,579
has gotten dramatically better at

2463
01:00:42,579 --> 01:00:44,110
each step of the way, which is why

2464
01:00:44,110 --> 01:00:45,940
we've never had the lower prices

2465
01:00:45,940 --> 01:00:46,269
after a

2466
01:00:46,420 --> 01:00:47,039
price raise.

2467
01:00:47,260 --> 01:00:48,500
And it's why we've been able to

2468
01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:50,070
consistently raise prices even

2469
01:00:50,070 --> 01:00:50,480
more.

2470
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:50,670
It's because

2471
01:00:50,820 --> 01:00:52,780
we have the formula for increasing

2472
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:54,530
the value every single time we

2473
01:00:54,530 --> 01:00:55,739
increase prices.

2474
01:00:55,739 --> 01:00:57,300
Super important.

2475
01:00:57,380 --> 01:00:59,900
A few ideas here again, invest in

2476
01:00:59,900 --> 01:01:01,619
new technology, invest in the team

2477
01:01:01,829 --> 01:01:03,059
members is the easiest one.

2478
01:01:03,139 --> 01:01:04,369
And it's the, I would say the

2479
01:01:04,369 --> 01:01:06,219
biggest lever you could pull as an

2480
01:01:06,219 --> 01:01:07,400
agency owner is just invest in

2481
01:01:07,539 --> 01:01:08,159
more team members.

2482
01:01:08,179 --> 01:01:10,940
And that's an easy way to justify

2483
01:01:10,940 --> 01:01:12,750
raising your prices.

2484
01:01:13,059 --> 01:01:14,739
So I glazed through

2485
01:01:14,820 --> 01:01:15,969
that really quickly.

2486
01:01:15,969 --> 01:01:17,440
What do you guys have for me on

2487
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:17,929
that?

2488
01:01:18,019 --> 01:01:20,960
I've got a quick question.

2489
01:01:21,050 --> 01:01:24,099
With that, Andres, have you ever

2490
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:25,219
experienced like an objection

2491
01:01:25,940 --> 01:01:28,389
from like an existing client when

2492
01:01:28,420 --> 01:01:30,179
raising your prices?

2493
01:01:30,389 --> 01:01:31,460
And how would you go about

2494
01:01:31,860 --> 01:01:32,099
handling that?

2495
01:01:32,179 --> 01:01:34,179
Oh, really good question.

2496
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:35,429
So this is something I did not

2497
01:01:35,429 --> 01:01:36,960
clarify, but when we raise our

2498
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:37,380
prices,

2499
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:39,269
at least at our agency, it doesn't

2500
01:01:39,579 --> 01:01:40,400
affect current clients.

2501
01:01:40,489 --> 01:01:42,420
That's just our way of doing it.

2502
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:42,820
Okay.

2503
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:42,980
Yeah.

2504
01:01:42,980 --> 01:01:44,590
I found that to be a lot easier to

2505
01:01:44,590 --> 01:01:45,539
do it that way.

2506
01:01:45,539 --> 01:01:49,139
But a lot of the times agencies,

2507
01:01:49,219 --> 01:01:50,639
like I remember Lemlist, they're

2508
01:01:50,639 --> 01:01:51,760
SaaS, so it's a little bit

2509
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:53,000
different, but like they just

2510
01:01:53,139 --> 01:01:53,380
increased

2511
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:55,670
their prices for everyone and they

2512
01:01:55,940 --> 01:01:57,699
didn't grandfather anyone in.

2513
01:01:57,909 --> 01:01:59,860
But I'm a pretty firm believer in

2514
01:01:59,860 --> 01:02:00,059
like

2515
01:02:00,340 --> 01:02:02,460
grandfathering in early adopters

2516
01:02:02,469 --> 01:02:04,369
and rewarding them for making

2517
01:02:04,369 --> 01:02:06,130
decisions earlier on in our

2518
01:02:06,599 --> 01:02:06,940
journey.

2519
01:02:07,699 --> 01:02:10,900
But it's really depends on your

2520
01:02:10,900 --> 01:02:12,389
preference and what you want to

2521
01:02:12,389 --> 01:02:12,659
do.

2522
01:02:13,039 --> 01:02:14,579
So I don't necessarily have

2523
01:02:14,659 --> 01:02:15,530
an answer for that.

2524
01:02:15,690 --> 01:02:16,719
But if like, I guess I do.

2525
01:02:16,780 --> 01:02:18,590
It's just, again, like the reason

2526
01:02:18,590 --> 01:02:18,909
you should ask

2527
01:02:19,139 --> 01:02:20,599
these questions is so you have an

2528
01:02:20,599 --> 01:02:21,440
answer for that.

2529
01:02:21,619 --> 01:02:22,909
So if you're going to increase

2530
01:02:23,059 --> 01:02:23,940
prices for existing

2531
01:02:24,019 --> 01:02:25,559
customers, just explain to them

2532
01:02:25,559 --> 01:02:25,900
why.

2533
01:02:25,900 --> 01:02:27,349
I'm increasing prices so I can

2534
01:02:27,349 --> 01:02:29,380
invest in more team members so we

2535
01:02:29,460 --> 01:02:30,460
could communicate with you more

2536
01:02:30,460 --> 01:02:31,579
consistently and we could get you

2537
01:02:31,590 --> 01:02:32,260
better results.

2538
01:02:32,260 --> 01:02:33,460
Pretty simple.

2539
01:02:33,539 --> 01:02:33,860
Yeah.

2540
01:02:33,860 --> 01:02:34,420
Yeah.

2541
01:02:34,719 --> 01:02:34,900
Sweet.

2542
01:02:34,900 --> 01:02:35,139
Awesome.

2543
01:02:35,139 --> 01:02:35,900
That pretty much answered.

2544
01:02:36,019 --> 01:02:36,480
Appreciate that.

2545
01:02:37,300 --> 01:02:37,780
Gotcha, bro.

2546
01:02:37,780 --> 01:02:42,219
Sweet.

2547
01:02:43,559 --> 01:02:46,260
Yeah, go ahead, someone.

2548
01:02:46,340 --> 01:02:47,659
Just want to let you know, is it

2549
01:02:47,659 --> 01:02:48,989
possible for you to link the

2550
01:02:48,989 --> 01:02:50,119
document in Slack?

2551
01:02:50,340 --> 01:02:52,070
No, dude, I'm keeping this

2552
01:02:52,460 --> 01:02:52,840
forever.

2553
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:54,820
I'm burning it after a call.

2554
01:02:54,900 --> 01:02:56,219
Yeah, that's an extra 2K,

2555
01:02:56,219 --> 01:02:56,900
actually.

2556
01:02:56,980 --> 01:02:58,179
Yeah, that's an epic call.

2557
01:02:58,179 --> 01:03:00,480
Yeah, of course, dude.

2558
01:03:00,590 --> 01:03:01,460
I'll share it.

2559
01:03:01,460 --> 01:03:03,059
Again, this is a beta, so I would

2560
01:03:03,139 --> 01:03:04,670
really appreciate any feedback you

2561
01:03:04,670 --> 01:03:05,300
guys have.

2562
01:03:05,619 --> 01:03:06,820
Like, I kind of just threw

2563
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:08,139
all this together randomly.

2564
01:03:08,139 --> 01:03:09,460
I was bored the other night.

2565
01:03:09,460 --> 01:03:11,150
And so if you guys have any

2566
01:03:11,349 --> 01:03:11,619
feedback,

2567
01:03:11,699 --> 01:03:13,429
if this was valuable, I'd really

2568
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:14,980
appreciate anything.

2569
01:03:14,980 --> 01:03:16,900
And then, yeah, I'll share the

2570
01:03:16,900 --> 01:03:17,380
document,

2571
01:03:17,420 --> 01:03:18,659
I'll share this recording, and

2572
01:03:18,659 --> 01:03:20,659
then I'll probably continue to add

2573
01:03:20,659 --> 01:03:23,139
to it for a few more days or

2574
01:03:23,489 --> 01:03:23,539
weeks.

2575
01:03:23,619 --> 01:03:25,059
And then once I feel like it's,

2576
01:03:25,059 --> 01:03:27,099
you know, finalized, I'll do a

2577
01:03:27,110 --> 01:03:28,829
whole lesson on it for the

2578
01:03:28,980 --> 01:03:29,780
learning platform.

2579
01:03:31,059 --> 01:03:32,500
No, bro, that was fucking solid.

2580
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:33,139
I really liked it.

2581
01:03:33,219 --> 01:03:33,699
Sweet.

2582
01:03:33,769 --> 01:03:35,139
I appreciate that, dude.

2583
01:03:35,300 --> 01:03:37,780
And yeah, phase five is just

2584
01:03:37,780 --> 01:03:39,289
talking about how to optimize

2585
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:40,019
operations.

2586
01:03:40,099 --> 01:03:40,739
So if you go on the learning

2587
01:03:41,119 --> 01:03:42,570
platform, it's the lesson titled

2588
01:03:42,579 --> 01:03:43,880
"How to Optimize Operations."

2589
01:03:44,900 --> 01:03:48,230
And I think it was Avery, or one

2590
01:03:48,230 --> 01:03:49,820
of the newer guys, asked about

2591
01:03:49,820 --> 01:03:51,219
like, where do you actually start?

2592
01:03:51,300 --> 01:03:53,130
Like, how do you know what to

2593
01:03:53,420 --> 01:03:54,230
tackle first?

2594
01:03:54,329 --> 01:03:55,530
That is going to cover exactly

2595
01:03:55,750 --> 01:03:56,510
that question.

2596
01:03:56,739 --> 01:03:59,780
Cool, guys.

2597
01:03:59,780 --> 01:04:01,619
Oh, I got to jump.

2598
01:04:01,699 --> 01:04:05,119
So I'm going now to a hotel in the

2599
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:08,639
area here in Tampa to tour a venue

2600
01:04:08,699 --> 01:04:11,059
for our event in October,

2601
01:04:11,139 --> 01:04:12,179
on October 22nd.

2602
01:04:12,179 --> 01:04:13,860
So that's super exciting.

2603
01:04:13,860 --> 01:04:15,380
I'll probably send some pictures

2604
01:04:15,590 --> 01:04:16,579
and stuff in the group.

2605
01:04:16,659 --> 01:04:18,349
But just a reminder, if you guys

2606
01:04:18,679 --> 01:04:20,289
haven't heard about it yet, check

2607
01:04:20,289 --> 01:04:20,900
it out.

2608
01:04:21,110 --> 01:04:22,260
And hopefully you can

2609
01:04:22,340 --> 01:04:23,150
make plans to be there because

2610
01:04:23,449 --> 01:04:24,739
it's going to be pretty dope.

2611
01:04:24,820 --> 01:04:26,590
And there's going to be a lot more

2612
01:04:26,739 --> 01:04:28,110
information coming on that

2613
01:04:28,110 --> 01:04:29,849
probably starting next week.

2614
01:04:29,849 --> 01:04:31,730
Sweet.

2615
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,420
All right.

2616
01:04:34,420 --> 01:04:35,219
Thank you all for being

2617
01:04:35,380 --> 01:04:35,699
here.

2618
01:04:35,699 --> 01:04:37,170
And I'll talk to you in Slack.

2619
01:04:37,460 --> 01:04:38,179
Until next time.

2620
01:04:38,179 --> 01:04:39,159
Thanks, Dondra.
