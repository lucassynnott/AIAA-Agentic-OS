1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,280
What's up, guys?

2
00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:03,299
Welcome back to another video.

3
00:00:03,299 --> 00:00:04,549
And in this video, I want to talk

4
00:00:04,669 --> 00:00:05,370
about setting

5
00:00:05,419 --> 00:00:07,889
up proper communication channels

6
00:00:07,889 --> 00:00:10,359
between you, your team, and your

7
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:12,259
client and their team.

8
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:13,660
So this is key.

9
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:16,359
It's so, so important to do this

10
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:18,949
right away early on because as a

11
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:19,780
client,

12
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:23,160
the biggest frustration is low

13
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,059
turnaround time or long turnaround

14
00:00:27,059 --> 00:00:29,140
times when it comes

15
00:00:29,239 --> 00:00:31,829
to communication or like slow time

16
00:00:31,829 --> 00:00:34,090
to response and also not being

17
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:36,039
organized, like not knowing

18
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,439
where to actually communicate with

19
00:00:38,439 --> 00:00:40,219
your service provider.

20
00:00:40,219 --> 00:00:41,460
So you want it right from the get

21
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:41,770
go.

22
00:00:41,859 --> 00:00:43,530
You want to be really transparent

23
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:45,109
and clear with your client about

24
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,429
where they can reach

25
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:47,000
you.

26
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,649
So traditional ways to do this can

27
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:51,250
be through email.

28
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:53,649
But the reason Slack has blown

29
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,880
up as much as it has in recent

30
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:58,609
months and just the past few years

31
00:00:58,609 --> 00:01:01,219
is because it truly is the best

32
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:03,740
tool for client services business

33
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:06,010
and for tons of other different

34
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:06,760
stuff.

35
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:07,900
Like obviously, we use it

36
00:01:07,939 --> 00:01:09,359
for the client ascension program

37
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:10,790
and it serves that purpose.

38
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,469
But anytime you want to centralize

39
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:16,239
communications and organize it and

40
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:18,219
do it in a way that's fun.

41
00:01:18,219 --> 00:01:20,500
Because one thing that I'm not

42
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:20,879
sure how

43
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,310
much I talked about it in previous

44
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:23,769
videos in this module, but when it

45
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:24,920
comes to onboarding and

46
00:01:25,349 --> 00:01:27,150
fulfillment, it always comes back

47
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:28,299
to experience.

48
00:01:28,299 --> 00:01:31,019
You want to create the ultimate

49
00:01:31,019 --> 00:01:32,569
experience for your

50
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:33,340
clients.

51
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:34,969
Like you want them to enjoy the

52
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,310
experience, right?

53
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:37,769
It has to be enjoyable.

54
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:38,540
It has to be easy

55
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:39,140
to access.

56
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,769
It has to be fun, new, exciting.

57
00:01:40,769 --> 00:01:42,189
Like you don't want to bore them

58
00:01:42,189 --> 00:01:43,359
with just back and forth

59
00:01:43,629 --> 00:01:43,930
emails.

60
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:45,900
And emails are super unorganized.

61
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,540
You know, you might start a new

62
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,620
email thread and you might

63
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:51,140
want to refer back to something in

64
00:01:51,219 --> 00:01:52,280
another email thread.

65
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:53,780
And you might not have included

66
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:54,159
everyone

67
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,549
on your team and their team in the

68
00:01:55,549 --> 00:01:56,379
original email.

69
00:01:56,379 --> 00:01:57,500
So you got to forward it.

70
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,750
So email is super messy.

71
00:01:58,819 --> 00:02:00,939
But Slack is super organized.

72
00:02:00,939 --> 00:02:03,049
So right from the get go, like you

73
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,040
saw in some of our onboarding

74
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:07,620
materials, we include Slack, like

75
00:02:07,629 --> 00:02:09,150
a link to join the Slack

76
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:11,389
workspace, or maybe we just send

77
00:02:11,389 --> 00:02:12,199
them an invite

78
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:13,189
through email.

79
00:02:13,289 --> 00:02:14,759
But it's really simple.

80
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:16,469
You just want to use Slack to set

81
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:18,180
up communications with your

82
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:18,840
client.

83
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,860
And in the beginning, I'd keep it

84
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:21,840
really simple.

85
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,400
Like all you do is set up a

86
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,300
workspace,

87
00:02:24,379 --> 00:02:24,780
right?

88
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,340
So you go to slack.com and you

89
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:28,099
create a new workspace, right?

90
00:02:28,099 --> 00:02:29,500
And you just log in with your

91
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:30,650
account or whatever.

92
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:31,909
And when you create a Slack

93
00:02:31,909 --> 00:02:33,509
workspace, you just name it like

94
00:02:33,509 --> 00:02:34,340
whatever your

95
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:35,340
agency's name is.

96
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:37,259
So like for us, it's knowledge X.

97
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:38,770
So we just name it knowledge X

98
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:39,909
client workspace,

99
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:40,819
and that's it.

100
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:42,330
And then you could throw, you

101
00:02:42,379 --> 00:02:44,000
know, your your company logo in

102
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,520
there.

103
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,879
And you're pretty

104
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:47,159
much all set up at that point.

105
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:48,590
So once you're in the knowledge X

106
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:50,300
client workspace, you're going to

107
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,150
have, I believe, three channels

108
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:53,919
that are default to any new Slack

109
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:54,569
workspace.

110
00:02:54,699 --> 00:02:57,740
And that is a general chat,

111
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,650
a random chat and then an

112
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:02,020
announcements chat, I think, or

113
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:04,479
maybe as general and then chat and

114
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:04,629
then

115
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:05,180
random.

116
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:06,909
I forgot because I haven't started

117
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:08,780
a Slack group in the longest time.

118
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,900
But basically in real

119
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:12,719
quick, just for people who are not

120
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:14,340
too familiar with Slack and the

121
00:03:14,349 --> 00:03:15,650
terminology, right?

122
00:03:15,669 --> 00:03:16,759
So there are Slack

123
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,810
workspaces, which is what we have

124
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:20,800
here within client ascension.

125
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,020
This is a workspace here, right?

126
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:23,319
This,

127
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:24,189
this whole thing.

128
00:03:24,189 --> 00:03:25,199
And then you see, I have two

129
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:26,680
different workspaces on the side.

130
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,259
So I have a

131
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:28,830
regular knowledge X workspace and

132
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:30,139
that's for me and my internal

133
00:03:30,139 --> 00:03:30,520
team.

134
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,979
And then I have a knowledge X

135
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:32,770
client workspace.

136
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,080
So that's for all of our clients.

137
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,009
And then I have the client

138
00:03:35,009 --> 00:03:36,419
ascension workspace, which

139
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:38,270
is for our coaching program.

140
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:40,569
And then within the workspace are

141
00:03:40,569 --> 00:03:41,400
channels.

142
00:03:41,509 --> 00:03:43,219
So all these things you see on

143
00:03:43,259 --> 00:03:44,360
the left-hand side, like

144
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,969
announcements, chat, weekly call

145
00:03:45,969 --> 00:03:47,409
links, wins, and then all these

146
00:03:47,409 --> 00:03:47,810
private

147
00:03:48,259 --> 00:03:49,729
channels are channels within a

148
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:50,629
workspace.

149
00:03:50,629 --> 00:03:52,520
So you have a workspace and then

150
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,080
you have channels, right?

151
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,699
So you want to create a workspace

152
00:03:55,699 --> 00:03:56,719
for your clients.

153
00:03:56,719 --> 00:03:58,039
And then within the client

154
00:03:58,039 --> 00:03:59,360
workspace, you want to

155
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:01,210
create a new channel for every

156
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:02,530
client you sign.

157
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:04,750
And then, so you'll have, so like

158
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:05,620
in our client

159
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:06,719
ascension, right, we have

160
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:07,969
announcements and then we have

161
00:04:07,969 --> 00:04:09,379
chat, weekly call links, wins, and

162
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:09,860
then all

163
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:10,849
these private channels.

164
00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:12,789
So when you sign on a client, I'd

165
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:14,319
keep announcements.

166
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:16,319
And basically announcements,

167
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,980
the way I look at that is like an

168
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:19,209
email newsletter.

169
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:21,300
So every client will be in the

170
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:22,180
workspace, meaning

171
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,639
they'll also have access to the

172
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,980
announcements channel.

173
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:26,110
And you could tailor the

174
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:26,910
announcements

175
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:29,040
channel, like the settings to, so

176
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,000
that like only you or other admins

177
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,509
from your team can post in

178
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:33,259
there.

179
00:04:33,259 --> 00:04:35,259
So it's like a read only chat.

180
00:04:35,259 --> 00:04:37,180
And then you could also do it so

181
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:38,889
that everyone is in it,

182
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:39,449
right?

183
00:04:39,449 --> 00:04:41,209
So like every one of your clients

184
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,750
that are anyone in the Slack

185
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:43,889
workspace is in the

186
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:44,680
announcements channel.

187
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:47,000
So you could, you could treat it

188
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,160
like an email list because it's

189
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:49,459
just

190
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,899
like sending to the entire list,

191
00:04:50,899 --> 00:04:52,180
the entire list of clients.

192
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,639
And then they can't like respond

193
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:54,000
back.

194
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,850
So like you won't really see, you

195
00:04:56,019 --> 00:04:57,990
know, David can't respond or Abdi

196
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:59,779
can't respond to these messages.

197
00:04:59,819 --> 00:05:01,629
So it's not like just another chat

198
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,759
area that's going to blow up.

199
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:04,750
It's just going to be like

200
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,470
strictly important messages, like

201
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:08,160
how we use it in client ascension.

202
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,300
Just pay attention because

203
00:05:09,339 --> 00:05:10,300
that's how you'd use the

204
00:05:10,389 --> 00:05:11,779
announcements channel in your

205
00:05:11,779 --> 00:05:12,740
client workspace.

206
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,399
It's just anytime there's a

207
00:05:14,709 --> 00:05:16,290
really important announcement that

208
00:05:16,459 --> 00:05:17,800
applies to every one of your

209
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,420
clients.

210
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:19,879
Like, you know, right now

211
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,649
it's almost Christmas.

212
00:05:21,649 --> 00:05:23,819
So I might send a Merry Christmas

213
00:05:23,819 --> 00:05:25,750
update in the announcements

214
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:26,569
channel for

215
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,079
all of our clients and wish them a

216
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,689
happy new year and let them know,

217
00:05:29,689 --> 00:05:31,279
you know, what our plans are in

218
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:31,980
the new year.

219
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:32,410
Right.

220
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:33,730
So that's the announcements

221
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:34,339
channel.

222
00:05:34,339 --> 00:05:36,740
You don't need a chat or a weekly

223
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:37,160
call

224
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:38,420
links or a wins channel.

225
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:40,110
Like this is just for our program.

226
00:05:40,149 --> 00:05:42,139
So the only general channel that

227
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:42,699
you

228
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:43,980
should consider having in your

229
00:05:44,029 --> 00:05:44,990
client workspace is an

230
00:05:45,019 --> 00:05:46,540
announcements channel because all

231
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:47,290
of your clients

232
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,170
will be in that channel, including

233
00:05:49,339 --> 00:05:50,949
you and all your, the guys from

234
00:05:50,949 --> 00:05:51,589
your team.

235
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:52,660
And then the only

236
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:53,910
people that could post in that

237
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:55,110
channel are the admins of the

238
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:56,699
Slack workspace, which is going to

239
00:05:56,699 --> 00:05:57,120
be you

240
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,949
and most likely others from your

241
00:05:58,949 --> 00:05:59,410
team.

242
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:01,160
Then in addition, what you're

243
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,660
going to do is have private

244
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:03,189
channels.

245
00:06:03,189 --> 00:06:04,269
So if you look at the private

246
00:06:04,269 --> 00:06:05,709
channels, every single student in

247
00:06:05,709 --> 00:06:07,240
the client ascension program

248
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:09,420
has a private channel set up for

249
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:10,009
them.

250
00:06:10,009 --> 00:06:12,199
So you do the same thing for your

251
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:13,360
clients, right?

252
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:13,899
And the way we

253
00:06:13,939 --> 00:06:15,529
set it up was we just named these

254
00:06:15,529 --> 00:06:17,420
channels, like the person's first

255
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,079
name, dash last name, dash

256
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:19,649
private.

257
00:06:19,649 --> 00:06:20,930
So you could do like the same

258
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:21,370
thing.

259
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:22,759
So if you sign knowledge X as a

260
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:24,069
client, you could just do

261
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:25,600
knowledge X and you don't have to

262
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,319
put private.

263
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,689
You could use whatever naming

264
00:06:27,689 --> 00:06:28,939
convention you'd like.

265
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:31,209
And all you do is you, instead of

266
00:06:31,209 --> 00:06:33,199
leaving it open, so like open

267
00:06:33,329 --> 00:06:35,629
channels have like this hashtag

268
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:37,500
next to it, meaning like anyone in

269
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,889
the workspace can join.

270
00:06:38,889 --> 00:06:40,379
You just want to create it as a

271
00:06:40,379 --> 00:06:40,959
private

272
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:41,509
channel.

273
00:06:41,509 --> 00:06:43,050
So there's like a lock next to it,

274
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:44,319
which is super easy to do.

275
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:45,720
Like when you create a channel

276
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,980
in Slack, you hit add channel,

277
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,220
create new, and then you could

278
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,339
just set it to private.

279
00:06:49,339 --> 00:06:50,560
And then you could

280
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,699
name the channel, right?

281
00:06:51,699 --> 00:06:52,850
Like a knowledge X channel.

282
00:06:52,899 --> 00:06:54,220
You could put a description if you

283
00:06:54,339 --> 00:06:54,600
want

284
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:55,879
to like explain to your client

285
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:57,279
what it's used for, and then you

286
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,259
can make it private.

287
00:06:58,379 --> 00:06:59,980
And then once you

288
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,540
create the channel, you could

289
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:03,160
decide who you want to invite.

290
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,569
And obviously when you first

291
00:07:04,629 --> 00:07:05,180
onboard a

292
00:07:05,269 --> 00:07:06,639
client, the client's not going to

293
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,949
be in your Slack right away.

294
00:07:07,949 --> 00:07:09,439
So you'll first send them like the

295
00:07:09,579 --> 00:07:10,019
general

296
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,000
invite link to join the Slack

297
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:11,649
workspace.

298
00:07:11,649 --> 00:07:12,910
And then once you see that they've

299
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:13,939
joined the workspace,

300
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:15,790
you just go into, you know, like

301
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:18,139
the specific channel, and then you

302
00:07:18,139 --> 00:07:19,509
could add them as a member

303
00:07:19,779 --> 00:07:21,019
now that they're in your

304
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:21,800
workspace.

305
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,319
So that's, that's Slack.

306
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:24,939
So you could set it up however

307
00:07:24,939 --> 00:07:25,310
you'd

308
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:25,769
like.

309
00:07:25,769 --> 00:07:27,399
But like I said, you'd set up a

310
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:29,250
workspace specifically for your

311
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:29,839
agency.

312
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:31,519
So set up a agency

313
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,329
name and then dash, like I have it

314
00:07:33,329 --> 00:07:33,779
here.

315
00:07:33,779 --> 00:07:35,449
So you'll see like clock, like

316
00:07:35,449 --> 00:07:36,620
knowledge X, right?

317
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,379
And then

318
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:38,290
there's that line.

319
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:39,860
And then it says client workspace.

320
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,360
So you just do, you know, your

321
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,220
agency's name,

322
00:07:42,939 --> 00:07:43,879
client workspace.

323
00:07:43,889 --> 00:07:46,060
And then within that workspace,

324
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:48,110
you'd have an announcements

325
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,860
channel, like I have

326
00:07:49,899 --> 00:07:50,459
set up here.

327
00:07:50,459 --> 00:07:51,709
And again, the announcements

328
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:53,060
channel is basically like your

329
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,139
email list that has all of

330
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:55,069
your clients on it.

331
00:07:55,069 --> 00:07:56,240
So you could send important

332
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,680
information and updates through

333
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,579
the announcements

334
00:07:58,980 --> 00:07:59,230
channel.

335
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:00,899
You could even call the channel

336
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,660
like important or company-wide

337
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:03,310
updates.

338
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:04,149
Like you don't

339
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,410
have to use the same naming

340
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:06,740
convention that we use, but

341
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,620
that's, you know, a standard one.

342
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:09,699
So you'll use

343
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:10,689
the announcements channel for

344
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:11,040
that.

345
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,060
And then anytime you sign a new

346
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,600
client, you'll just add a channel

347
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:15,430
and the channel would just be that

348
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:17,019
client's specific name.

349
00:08:17,019 --> 00:08:19,170
And here's the thing, like

350
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,939
sometimes people

351
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,790
like to get super like complicated

352
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:24,600
with Slack and they'll set up like

353
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,300
multiple different channels

354
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:27,259
for one client.

355
00:08:27,259 --> 00:08:29,060
We've done that in the past too.

356
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:30,540
But what we found is like the

357
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:31,870
client is looking for

358
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:33,298
the most straightforward way to

359
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:34,740
communicate with you as a service

360
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:35,320
provider.

361
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:38,220
So just set up one channel for

362
00:08:38,259 --> 00:08:38,710
the client.

363
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:39,679
That's really all you need.

364
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:40,779
If you really need like another

365
00:08:40,779 --> 00:08:42,798
channel, like for example,

366
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:45,240
we actually, for our clients, we

367
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,129
have a client name chat and a

368
00:08:47,259 --> 00:08:48,700
client name calls.

369
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,000
So like the chat

370
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:52,159
is like where, you know, we would

371
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:53,500
discuss anything.

372
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,429
And then the calls is only for an

373
00:08:55,429 --> 00:08:56,639
automation that we

374
00:08:56,679 --> 00:08:58,100
have set up through Calendly.

375
00:08:58,179 --> 00:08:59,799
So anytime a call is booked, since

376
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:01,360
we're doing a lead gen and we're

377
00:09:01,629 --> 00:09:02,360
scheduling appointments for our

378
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:03,539
client, that's like the service we

379
00:09:03,539 --> 00:09:05,539
provide, a notification will be

380
00:09:05,539 --> 00:09:05,940
sent in the

381
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,720
calls channel.

382
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:08,179
And that's just for tracking

383
00:09:08,179 --> 00:09:08,809
purposes.

384
00:09:08,809 --> 00:09:10,529
And it's, it's nice for the client

385
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:11,240
to be able to go

386
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:12,809
to that channel and see all the

387
00:09:12,809 --> 00:09:14,440
calls we've booked for them.

388
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,070
But that's really like the only

389
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:16,580
use case

390
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,200
I could think of to have multiple

391
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,759
channels set up is if you need to

392
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:21,919
like use automations in aggregate

393
00:09:22,169 --> 00:09:23,769
data in real time to another

394
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:24,720
channel.

395
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,269
So the calls channel is only used

396
00:09:27,269 --> 00:09:29,240
to keep track of all the calls

397
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:30,659
that we're booking from our

398
00:09:30,659 --> 00:09:31,340
services.

399
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:32,899
And it's just easy for them to see

400
00:09:33,019 --> 00:09:34,100
that in real time.

401
00:09:34,139 --> 00:09:35,519
But the chat channel is where all

402
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:36,899
the activity is happening.

403
00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:39,029
So that's how I would set up

404
00:09:39,029 --> 00:09:39,669
Slack.

405
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:41,950
And it's so, so important, again,

406
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:42,950
to have this set up

407
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:44,580
professionally, right?

408
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:46,120
As soon as you onboard a

409
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:47,970
client, you want to get them into

410
00:09:48,139 --> 00:09:49,990
your professional workspaces so

411
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:52,120
that they're not confused on like,

412
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:53,419
where do I reach out to their

413
00:09:53,419 --> 00:09:53,700
team?

414
00:09:53,779 --> 00:09:55,259
How do I know what's happening?

415
00:09:55,259 --> 00:09:57,120
I haven't heard any updates.

416
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:57,220
Are

417
00:09:57,379 --> 00:09:58,129
they working yet?

418
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:59,210
Have they gotten started?

419
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,070
Where are they at?

420
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:01,340
How long is it going to take?

421
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:02,000
What did

422
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:03,460
they need for me, if anything,

423
00:10:03,539 --> 00:10:03,850
right?

424
00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:05,340
So you want to make sure you're

425
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,820
super organized and set up on

426
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:06,980
Slack

427
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:07,929
right away.

428
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:09,730
And you can include a link, an

429
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:11,399
invite link to join your Slack

430
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,730
workspace right in that

431
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,850
onboarding email that you'll send

432
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:16,120
out to new clients.

433
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,730
So if you have any questions on

434
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:18,139
this,

435
00:10:18,179 --> 00:10:18,929
let me know.

436
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:20,940
There's tons of videos and tons of

437
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,730
education around Slack and how

438
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:23,559
it's used.

439
00:10:23,559 --> 00:10:23,710
And

440
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,840
that you could get super into it,

441
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,000
like with the private channels and

442
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,330
the automations and the

443
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:30,370
workflows.

444
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,330
But really, like Slack is such a

445
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:33,240
simple tool.

446
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,000
And the best way to learn how to

447
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,580
use it is

448
00:10:36,019 --> 00:10:37,470
through actually using it.

449
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:39,700
So that's part of the reason why

450
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,610
we use Slack for our coaching

451
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:42,240
program,

452
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:44,399
where most other people use like

453
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,409
Telegram, or like a Facebook

454
00:10:46,409 --> 00:10:47,120
group.

455
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:47,809
The reason

456
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,840
we use Slack is because as agency

457
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,720
owners, it's like necessary to use

458
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,860
Slack at this point.

459
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:52,940
Like,

460
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,710
I don't know any agency owners

461
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:56,759
that manage clients that don't use

462
00:10:56,759 --> 00:10:57,419
Slack.

463
00:10:57,419 --> 00:10:59,820
So with that in mind, I want

464
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,690
you guys to be comfortable using

465
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,320
Slack.

466
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,240
So now, you know, being part of

467
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,379
our Client Ascension Slack

468
00:11:06,779 --> 00:11:08,230
workspace, you're learning how

469
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:09,460
Slack is to be used.

470
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,970
So you're watching me in the

471
00:11:11,029 --> 00:11:12,299
announcements channel,

472
00:11:12,389 --> 00:11:13,470
sending, you know, important

473
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:14,940
announcements, and you're watching

474
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,889
how people are communicating in

475
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:17,419
the chat,

476
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:18,879
and you're seeing how you could

477
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,299
like react to messages.

478
00:11:20,299 --> 00:11:21,419
And you're seeing like the

479
00:11:21,419 --> 00:11:21,679
difference

480
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,440
between a public channel and a

481
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,549
private channel.

482
00:11:24,549 --> 00:11:26,080
And you're seeing how you could

483
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,259
send like direct

484
00:11:27,659 --> 00:11:28,179
messages and DMs.

485
00:11:28,179 --> 00:11:29,580
And you're seeing how you could

486
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:31,470
add all these different apps to

487
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:33,259
speed things up and

488
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:34,299
automate things, right?

489
00:11:34,299 --> 00:11:36,289
So there's so much going on here.

490
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:37,500
And you'll even notice like in the

491
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:37,820
weekly

492
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,690
call links, like obviously, these

493
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,460
are all automated messages, I'm

494
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:43,179
not sending, you know, manual

495
00:11:43,179 --> 00:11:43,659
messages

496
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,480
at the same time, twice every

497
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,429
single week.

498
00:11:46,429 --> 00:11:48,539
So that happens through Zapier.

499
00:11:48,539 --> 00:11:49,919
So Zapier works really

500
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,360
nicely with Slack to set up

501
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,860
different automations.

502
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,960
But really, just to keep it simple

503
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,379
is, as soon as you

504
00:11:56,419 --> 00:11:57,940
sign on a client, the standard

505
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:59,529
workflow should be that you

506
00:11:59,529 --> 00:12:01,360
already have a client workspace

507
00:12:01,549 --> 00:12:01,950
set up for

508
00:12:02,019 --> 00:12:02,759
your agency.

509
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:04,460
So that once you have signed a

510
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:06,559
client, you invite them to Slack.

511
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,240
And then in Slack, you have

512
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:09,870
the private channel set up for

513
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:10,690
your client.

514
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:11,960
And then you also have the

515
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,269
announcements channel

516
00:12:13,379 --> 00:12:15,190
that everyone new to the workspace

517
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:16,139
gets added to.

518
00:12:16,139 --> 00:12:18,000
So if I'm a client, the way I see

519
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,909
it is that I signed

520
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,809
on, and then I got an email that's

521
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,309
inviting me to Slack.

522
00:12:22,309 --> 00:12:24,460
And in Slack, I'm being invited to

523
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:24,940
this Slack

524
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:26,549
that gives me two channels, the

525
00:12:26,549 --> 00:12:28,240
announcements channel, where I see

526
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,740
like company wide announcements,

527
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:30,509
and then my

528
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,830
company's name, as a channel

529
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:35,389
that's private, where it's just me

530
00:12:35,389 --> 00:12:37,740
and the service provider, or the

531
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,009
agency, and I just

532
00:12:39,419 --> 00:12:40,379
communicate with them that way.

533
00:12:40,379 --> 00:12:41,419
So set the standard and the

534
00:12:41,419 --> 00:12:42,860
precedent with your clients on

535
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:44,220
where and how to

536
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:45,350
communicate with you.

537
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:46,850
And the nice and everything can be

538
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:48,379
done through Slack, literally

539
00:12:48,379 --> 00:12:48,919
everything.

540
00:12:48,919 --> 00:12:50,210
It's so, it's so

541
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:50,759
dope.

542
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:52,860
And like, for example, right, like

543
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:54,769
you could send files in Slack, you

544
00:12:54,769 --> 00:12:57,100
could attach literal files, like

545
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:57,820
PDFs,

546
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,200
pictures, screenshots, right?

547
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,269
Like you're seeing in here,

548
00:13:00,269 --> 00:13:01,659
there's nothing like you can't do

549
00:13:01,659 --> 00:13:02,080
in Slack

550
00:13:02,179 --> 00:13:03,419
that you can do an email, from

551
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:04,549
what I found, at least.

552
00:13:04,549 --> 00:13:05,740
And the other nice thing that you

553
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:06,139
can do in

554
00:13:06,389 --> 00:13:07,889
Slack is you could record audio

555
00:13:07,889 --> 00:13:08,899
notes, right?

556
00:13:08,899 --> 00:13:10,649
You can literally record audio

557
00:13:10,649 --> 00:13:12,379
clips, which is a nice feature,

558
00:13:12,779 --> 00:13:13,980
because sometimes it's a lot

559
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:15,740
easier to communicate through

560
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:17,659
audio, whether that be for you or

561
00:13:17,659 --> 00:13:17,899
for your

562
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:18,200
client.

563
00:13:18,299 --> 00:13:19,769
You could also record video clips.

564
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:21,200
So you could send video clips

565
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,620
right through Slack.

566
00:13:22,659 --> 00:13:24,429
And then another nice thing is if

567
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:26,240
you're on like the premium trial

568
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,820
or the premium plan or whatever,

569
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:30,539
which is like $8 a month per user,

570
00:13:30,539 --> 00:13:32,090
which is nothing, just add that to

571
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:33,820
your, you know, monthly cost per

572
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,059
clients, like eight bucks a

573
00:13:35,059 --> 00:13:37,070
person, which I highly, I

574
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:38,379
recommend.

575
00:13:38,379 --> 00:13:40,220
You could do this thing in the

576
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:40,779
bottom left,

577
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:41,980
which is a huddle.

578
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:43,429
So when you're in, like, say, I

579
00:13:43,429 --> 00:13:45,259
want to huddle with Abdi or say,

580
00:13:45,259 --> 00:13:46,059
this is like my

581
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:47,860
client A, I'll navigate to their

582
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,460
private channel and I'll just

583
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:50,330
flick this on.

584
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:51,500
And I could actually

585
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:52,899
do calls right through Slack,

586
00:13:52,899 --> 00:13:54,370
instead of having to set up a zoom

587
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:55,779
and having to be on camera on my

588
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,460
client,

589
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,070
when, you know, 90% of the time

590
00:13:58,070 --> 00:13:59,340
when we have client calls,

591
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,620
they're, they're really just

592
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:02,279
quick catch up calls that don't

593
00:14:02,289 --> 00:14:04,269
require us to have our cameras on.

594
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:04,539
Right.

595
00:14:04,539 --> 00:14:06,059
And you even on the huddles,

596
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,759
you can share your screen and you

597
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:08,879
could record them.

598
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:10,610
So it's like, you're getting the

599
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:11,039
same thing

600
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,360
as you are through zoom.

601
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,860
You're just not getting the video

602
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,250
right now, which is, is ideal

603
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:15,980
because when

604
00:14:16,019 --> 00:14:17,789
we're meeting with clients, like

605
00:14:17,789 --> 00:14:19,340
why put on video, if you don't

606
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:20,960
need it, like just hop on an

607
00:14:21,149 --> 00:14:21,500
audio,

608
00:14:21,539 --> 00:14:23,250
it's like a conference call, talk

609
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:24,870
about stuff and then hop off once

610
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:25,740
you're done.

611
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:26,460
And if you need to

612
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,460
share your screen, you can do that

613
00:14:27,549 --> 00:14:28,289
right through Slack.

614
00:14:28,299 --> 00:14:29,980
So why use multiple tools like

615
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:30,299
zoom

616
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:31,730
and Slack, when you could use

617
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:33,570
everything all within Slack, it's,

618
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:34,889
it's just a no brainer.

619
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,399
So I'm not a salesman or anything

620
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,179
for Slack.

621
00:14:37,179 --> 00:14:39,500
Um, but I know that if you're an

622
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,139
agency owner,

623
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:41,129
you're going to need to be using

624
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:42,259
Slack and you're going to need to

625
00:14:42,259 --> 00:14:43,970
get really good at using Slack

626
00:14:44,379 --> 00:14:45,620
because most of your clients are

627
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:47,029
probably not going to have

628
00:14:47,029 --> 00:14:48,220
experience using Slack.

629
00:14:48,259 --> 00:14:50,039
So you have to guide them through

630
00:14:50,039 --> 00:14:51,320
it and be able to answer their

631
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,179
questions and, and, you know,

632
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:54,740
build their comfort level with,

633
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:57,000
with Slack, but it's, it's

634
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,379
required communication with

635
00:14:58,379 --> 00:14:59,169
clients is key.

636
00:15:00,019 --> 00:15:01,830
It's probably the number one

637
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,559
thing, uh, that, that retention

638
00:15:04,629 --> 00:15:07,019
relies on is, is communication.

639
00:15:07,059 --> 00:15:08,480
You have to properly communicate

640
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:09,580
with your clients.

641
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:11,740
Um, and just using a tool like

642
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:12,120
Slack

643
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:14,009
will, will put you already at an

644
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:16,620
advantage, um, as opposed to using

645
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:17,710
email and just not having

646
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:20,220
any organization on, uh, how

647
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,620
things are communicated between

648
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,539
you and your clients.

649
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:26,389
So, uh, look into Slack, get

650
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:28,720
comfortable, uh, and really your

651
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,110
action item after this video

652
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:31,990
is to set up a client workspace

653
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:33,019
within Slack.

654
00:15:33,019 --> 00:15:34,860
If you don't already have one set

655
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:35,659
up an announcements

656
00:15:36,059 --> 00:15:37,490
channel, delete all the other

657
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,500
channels, uh, you know, write

658
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,230
descriptions for, for the

659
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:41,659
announcements

660
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,250
channel.

661
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:43,309
If you want to write a mock

662
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:44,590
description for what a client

663
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:46,620
channel will look like, uh, if you

664
00:15:46,659 --> 00:15:48,360
want, and then if you have clients

665
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,100
already start setting up channels

666
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,899
for them within Slack so you

667
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:54,169
can invite them to it, uh, and,

668
00:15:54,169 --> 00:15:56,490
and just basically migrate all of

669
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:59,419
your communications over to Slack.

670
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:01,620
Uh, and this is going to be like

671
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:04,389
key for making an impression early

672
00:16:04,509 --> 00:16:06,700
on, uh, creating an enjoyable

673
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:08,330
experience early on and just

674
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:09,919
retaining clients long term.
