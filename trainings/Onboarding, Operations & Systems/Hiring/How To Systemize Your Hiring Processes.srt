1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:01,459
What's up guys?

2
00:00:01,459 --> 00:00:03,490
So in this video, I wanted to

3
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:05,509
quickly walk you through our

4
00:00:05,509 --> 00:00:06,839
hiring funnel and

5
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:08,869
process for the student success

6
00:00:08,869 --> 00:00:11,179
coach role here at Clan Ascension.

7
00:00:11,179 --> 00:00:13,640
And I think just seeing how

8
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,730
our process works from A to Z

9
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:18,170
behind the scenes can help inform

10
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:20,379
some of your guys' different

11
00:00:20,379 --> 00:00:20,829
hiring

12
00:00:20,839 --> 00:00:22,609
and recruiting funnels.

13
00:00:22,609 --> 00:00:24,440
And so the way I do it is through

14
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:25,739
a Trello board.

15
00:00:25,739 --> 00:00:27,559
The Trello board is

16
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:28,920
essentially set up like a CRM

17
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,449
because hiring is similar to the

18
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:32,118
sales process of bringing on a new

19
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,229
client, right?

20
00:00:33,229 --> 00:00:34,960
But anyways, I have a resources

21
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:35,329
tab.

22
00:00:35,329 --> 00:00:36,390
So I have a link to the

23
00:00:36,509 --> 00:00:37,329
application.

24
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:37,869
I have a link

25
00:00:37,939 --> 00:00:38,820
to the assessment.

26
00:00:38,909 --> 00:00:40,109
I have a link to book a screening

27
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,250
interview with Andy.

28
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,369
That's like our step one

29
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:42,899
interview.

30
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:43,909
And then I have a link to book a

31
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:45,189
final step interview with Andre.

32
00:00:45,189 --> 00:00:45,990
That's like the final

33
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:47,140
step of the process.

34
00:00:47,259 --> 00:00:48,859
And then pretty much there's a zap

35
00:00:48,859 --> 00:00:50,600
that's linked to the application,

36
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:51,240
which is a

37
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,299
Google form.

38
00:00:52,299 --> 00:00:54,350
So anytime someone applies,

39
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:56,909
they're automatically entered into

40
00:00:57,049 --> 00:00:58,560
this new applications

41
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,130
column.

42
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:00,740
So for example, this kid, Adi

43
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:02,179
Verma, he just applied.

44
00:01:02,259 --> 00:01:04,060
You can see his email and then you

45
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:04,459
have a

46
00:01:04,459 --> 00:01:06,209
link to the responses as well.

47
00:01:06,209 --> 00:01:07,799
These other ones were just added

48
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:09,799
manually because to be honest,

49
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:10,500
this is a

50
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,450
brand new thing I created to come

51
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:14,239
up with this training for.

52
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:16,719
So you have new applications as

53
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,140
the

54
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:17,980
first step.

55
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:19,659
Then you have for whoever had

56
00:01:19,659 --> 00:01:21,599
submitted an application, who do

57
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:22,810
we have a screening interview

58
00:01:22,819 --> 00:01:23,700
scheduled with?

59
00:01:23,829 --> 00:01:25,200
And to schedule the screening

60
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,930
interview, you have that link very

61
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:27,879
easily accessible

62
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:28,609
here.

63
00:01:28,609 --> 00:01:31,430
If the screening interview goes

64
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:33,719
well, then we assign them an

65
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:36,219
assessment, which I'll show you

66
00:01:36,219 --> 00:01:36,510
guys

67
00:01:36,519 --> 00:01:37,120
as well.

68
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,590
And you have the link to the

69
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:39,730
assessment here.

70
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,370
And then if the assessment is

71
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:42,739
good, we'll schedule

72
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,230
them for a culture fit interview

73
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:45,799
with someone else that's currently

74
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:46,859
in the student success

75
00:01:46,859 --> 00:01:47,719
coach role.

76
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:49,849
And if that person says, Hey, this

77
00:01:49,849 --> 00:01:51,719
person checks out, they'll be

78
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:52,780
scheduled with me

79
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,170
for a final interview.

80
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:56,079
And then from there, the person is

81
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:57,859
either hired or at any other step

82
00:01:57,859 --> 00:01:58,219
in the

83
00:01:58,219 --> 00:02:00,200
process, they can be disqualified.

84
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,939
So we have a pipeline for hiring.

85
00:02:01,939 --> 00:02:03,400
And if you hire for a specific

86
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,700
role over and over and over again,

87
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:05,879
it's going to be really helpful

88
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:07,239
for you to create something like

89
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:07,590
this.

90
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:08,889
So real quick, let me just show

91
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:10,430
you some of the different assets.

92
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:11,919
So the first asset is the

93
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:12,969
application.

94
00:02:12,969 --> 00:02:14,539
We do it in Google form.

95
00:02:14,539 --> 00:02:16,340
I also recommend type form,

96
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:18,000
whatever works for you,

97
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,439
but keep it really simple.

98
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:20,930
Pretty much this first part is

99
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:22,740
building out like the introduction

100
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:23,080
to the

101
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,439
role and why someone should be

102
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:26,669
interested.

103
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,750
It's pretty much like a VSL

104
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:31,180
version of your hiring scorecard

105
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:32,560
with the OTE and what you're

106
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,110
looking for and why they should

107
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:34,530
apply.

108
00:02:34,669 --> 00:02:36,400
And then it's the application.

109
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,500
You're just looking for their

110
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,569
name, their email, contact

111
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:39,719
information, where they're

112
00:02:39,729 --> 00:02:40,240
located,

113
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,699
what time zone they're in, how

114
00:02:41,789 --> 00:02:43,590
they heard about this opportunity,

115
00:02:43,729 --> 00:02:45,219
what they know about your company,

116
00:02:45,219 --> 00:02:47,389
what stuck out specifically about

117
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,620
this role and about your company,

118
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,340
why they think they're a good

119
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,250
fit for this role.

120
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:53,759
What is their experience with AI?

121
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:54,960
That's something that we ask

122
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,639
specifically,

123
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:56,520
so you can plug that in with

124
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:57,810
what's your experience with email

125
00:02:57,979 --> 00:02:58,759
marketing or what's your

126
00:02:58,759 --> 00:02:59,240
experience with

127
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:01,270
SEO or what's your experience with

128
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:03,210
account management, whatever is

129
00:03:03,219 --> 00:03:04,460
relevant to the role

130
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:05,259
you're hiring for.

131
00:03:05,259 --> 00:03:06,150
I always love to ask them this

132
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:06,789
question as well.

133
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,789
What's your career goals,

134
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,439
monetary, non-monetary growth?

135
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:10,860
How do you see this role playing a

136
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,240
part in your long-term vision?

137
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,939
Because I really want to find

138
00:03:13,939 --> 00:03:16,129
people that are long-term focused,

139
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:16,680
right?

140
00:03:16,909 --> 00:03:19,740
And then are you available

141
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,360
for a full-time commitment?

142
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:21,930
Yes or no.

143
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:23,240
If you're to get offered this

144
00:03:23,389 --> 00:03:24,860
position, how quickly can you

145
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:25,159
start?

146
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:26,259
And then to complete your

147
00:03:26,259 --> 00:03:27,370
application, here's a quick

148
00:03:27,539 --> 00:03:28,939
assignment, which is basically

149
00:03:28,939 --> 00:03:29,659
like put together

150
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,259
a welcome message for a student,

151
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:32,530
guiding them on the best next

152
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:33,689
steps to get started.

153
00:03:33,699 --> 00:03:35,020
And I always say

154
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:37,180
this is like a bonus record a loom

155
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:39,449
video, but I always, for the most

156
00:03:39,689 --> 00:03:41,419
part, weed out people that

157
00:03:41,419 --> 00:03:42,879
submit this without a loom video

158
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,189
because I want someone who's

159
00:03:44,189 --> 00:03:45,819
willing to go above and beyond and

160
00:03:45,819 --> 00:03:45,879
do

161
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,110
everything that is in their best

162
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,129
interest to stack the cards in

163
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,409
their favor to land this job

164
00:03:52,419 --> 00:03:53,050
opportunity.

165
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,479
So that's the assessment or sorry,

166
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:55,250
the application.

167
00:03:55,389 --> 00:03:56,240
So once they fill out the

168
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,500
application, it shows up

169
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:57,849
here.

170
00:03:57,849 --> 00:03:58,949
We basically review it.

171
00:03:58,949 --> 00:04:00,349
If it looks good, we'll reach out

172
00:04:00,349 --> 00:04:01,879
to schedule a screening interview.

173
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,930
If the screening interview goes

174
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:05,229
well, and we still think this

175
00:04:05,229 --> 00:04:06,939
person might be qualified for

176
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:09,139
the role, we'll then assign them

177
00:04:09,139 --> 00:04:10,199
the homework.

178
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:12,479
So the homework is this step here,

179
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:13,639
assessment,

180
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:15,110
assign, assessment or homework.

181
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,379
You can use either word.

182
00:04:16,379 --> 00:04:19,120
But pretty much what this looks

183
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:19,740
like is

184
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:20,620
different scenarios.

185
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:21,829
So you can read through these

186
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:22,389
scenarios.

187
00:04:22,389 --> 00:04:23,930
They're relevant to the student

188
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:24,189
success

189
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:25,550
coach role.

190
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:28,089
And it just is like mock, it's

191
00:04:28,089 --> 00:04:30,149
like mock scenarios.

192
00:04:30,149 --> 00:04:32,319
And it's just to see how they

193
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:33,100
would respond to these.

194
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,019
Obviously, they haven't gone

195
00:04:34,019 --> 00:04:34,819
through our training.

196
00:04:34,819 --> 00:04:35,920
They don't know the best

197
00:04:36,019 --> 00:04:37,370
way to handle these situations

198
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:37,670
yet.

199
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:38,899
But I just want to see how they

200
00:04:38,899 --> 00:04:40,360
think and approach these different

201
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,490
scenarios and problems.

202
00:04:41,579 --> 00:04:42,810
And I love this last question,

203
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:45,040
especially scenario number four,

204
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:45,920
say a

205
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,790
student assigned to you has

206
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:47,980
communicated privately about their

207
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:49,110
disappointment with your coaching

208
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:49,810
methods.

209
00:04:49,819 --> 00:04:51,319
They're hinting at wanting to

210
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:52,810
switch to a new SSC or receive a

211
00:04:52,899 --> 00:04:53,370
refund.

212
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:54,240
How do you respond

213
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:54,939
to this situation?

214
00:04:54,939 --> 00:04:56,899
So we're basically getting them to

215
00:04:56,899 --> 00:04:58,430
fill this out and evaluating

216
00:04:58,550 --> 00:04:59,319
whether or not

217
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:00,779
we think they can perform well in

218
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:01,899
the SSC role based on the

219
00:05:01,899 --> 00:05:02,529
homework.

220
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,579
If they pass the homework

221
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:06,740
assessment, they then get sent to

222
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,439
one of our existing student

223
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:10,430
success coaches for what we call

224
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:12,209
a culture fit interview, basically

225
00:05:12,209 --> 00:05:13,620
just asking one of the existing

226
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,420
team members that are performing

227
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:15,670
and

228
00:05:15,699 --> 00:05:17,800
excelling well to say, hey, do you

229
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,550
think this person is cut out to

230
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:21,370
join our team and to help us reach

231
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,040
our goals?

232
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,589
And that's typically like a 15

233
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:24,639
minute interview.

234
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:26,360
They'll give you good feedback.

235
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:26,639
It's

236
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:27,740
basically just like a litmus test.

237
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:28,709
If you're the one doing the

238
00:05:28,709 --> 00:05:29,860
interviews all the way through,

239
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:31,699
like in this example, Andy, who

240
00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:33,439
manages our SSC team has done the

241
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:35,040
process up to this point.

242
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:35,550
It's

243
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,459
helpful for him to get a secondary

244
00:05:37,459 --> 00:05:39,339
perspective from someone else on

245
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,009
the team.

246
00:05:40,009 --> 00:05:41,220
And if that passes,

247
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,689
it's then scheduled with me, the

248
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:44,439
ultimate decision maker to say,

249
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:46,000
hey, I've heard from Andy,

250
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,079
I've heard from this other SSC,

251
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:48,189
I've reviewed your application,

252
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:49,350
I've reviewed your homework,

253
00:05:49,379 --> 00:05:50,680
and it looks like you could be a

254
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,529
really good fit.

255
00:05:51,529 --> 00:05:52,879
I'd see if there's any other red

256
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:53,800
flags or concerns

257
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,680
I want to hit on.

258
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:56,560
Otherwise, I go through the next

259
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,990
steps for the hiring and the

260
00:05:58,110 --> 00:05:59,180
onboarding process,

261
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:01,089
and they're moved over to hired.

262
00:06:01,089 --> 00:06:02,740
And again, at any stage in the

263
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:04,579
process, if they're disqualified,

264
00:06:04,579 --> 00:06:06,050
you can put them all the way over

265
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:07,709
here in the disqualified column,

266
00:06:07,709 --> 00:06:08,980
similar to like a closed,

267
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,879
lost column in a CRM.

268
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:12,319
So that's really it.

269
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:14,389
So it just becomes a game of

270
00:06:14,389 --> 00:06:16,620
moving people left to right,

271
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:19,579
same way you'd work your CRM, and

272
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:22,050
getting more people top of funnel,

273
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:22,779
right?

274
00:06:22,779 --> 00:06:23,839
So running ads,

275
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:25,569
campaigns to get people interested

276
00:06:25,569 --> 00:06:27,000
to actually apply in the first

277
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,449
place.

278
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:28,300
So for example,

279
00:06:28,339 --> 00:06:30,259
I posted this 22 hours ago, in our

280
00:06:30,259 --> 00:06:31,939
school community, where there's

281
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,980
over 1000 people in our lower

282
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:34,240
ticket

283
00:06:34,819 --> 00:06:37,339
program, to basically see if any

284
00:06:37,339 --> 00:06:39,339
of these guys might be interested

285
00:06:39,339 --> 00:06:40,819
in this opportunity.

286
00:06:40,819 --> 00:06:41,740
So I put a hiring

287
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:43,569
post here, with a link to the

288
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:44,579
application.

289
00:06:44,579 --> 00:06:46,529
And I posted on Twitter, we sent

290
00:06:46,529 --> 00:06:47,939
it to our email list,

291
00:06:47,939 --> 00:06:50,500
I sent it to some friends as well.

292
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,689
And it's like an ad, right?

293
00:06:52,689 --> 00:06:55,300
I'm pretty much formatting this as

294
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:55,339
an

295
00:06:55,459 --> 00:06:56,589
ad to get people to apply.

296
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,959
Like I'm actually using social

297
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,319
proof as well to say, look, you

298
00:06:59,319 --> 00:06:59,889
want to come

299
00:06:59,939 --> 00:07:01,410
work for this company that

300
00:07:01,579 --> 00:07:03,870
produced 216 reviews that amounted

301
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:06,149
to the 4.9 out of five stars on

302
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:06,689
Trustpilot.

303
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:08,949
Like that's a company you can feel

304
00:07:08,949 --> 00:07:10,449
good about helping and working

305
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:10,870
for.

306
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:13,480
So that's kind of an

307
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:15,509
example of what our hiring posts

308
00:07:15,509 --> 00:07:17,100
look like to feed the top of

309
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,209
funnel, which in this situation

310
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:19,540
would be

311
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:20,639
new applications.

312
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:22,370
And then once these are fed into

313
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:24,250
your hiring funnel, you just move

314
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,209
them from left to

315
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:25,610
right.

316
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:26,870
So you schedule the screening

317
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:28,370
interview, if they're fit, if the

318
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:29,670
screening interview goes well,

319
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:31,329
you do an assessment with them.

320
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,040
If the assessment or the homework

321
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,319
results look good to you,

322
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,870
schedule them with someone else on

323
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:37,120
your team to do a culture fit

324
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:37,750
interview.

325
00:07:37,889 --> 00:07:38,839
And if they look good

326
00:07:38,939 --> 00:07:40,699
or have a good report, you can

327
00:07:40,699 --> 00:07:42,540
schedule them with yourself or a

328
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,610
higher up or just essentially the

329
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:46,000
ultimate decision maker in the

330
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,449
company to do a final interview.

331
00:07:47,449 --> 00:07:48,779
And then from there, they're

332
00:07:48,779 --> 00:07:49,160
hired.

333
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:49,519
But

334
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:51,509
the entire idea and message of

335
00:07:51,509 --> 00:07:53,439
this video is that you should

336
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:55,740
treat your hiring process the same

337
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:56,040
way

338
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,959
you treat your marketing and sales

339
00:07:57,959 --> 00:07:59,629
process to get new clients.

340
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:01,160
So hopefully this video is

341
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:01,680
valuable.

342
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,149
If there's other parts of our

343
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:05,170
hiring process that you'd like to

344
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:07,889
see, such as screening interview

345
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,069
examples, more assessment

346
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,819
examples, maybe even an SOP on the

347
00:08:12,819 --> 00:08:15,399
culture fit interviews, I'd be

348
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,540
happy to

349
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,019
collect those resources from our

350
00:08:18,129 --> 00:08:19,360
various team members who are

351
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,740
involved in the hiring process

352
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:22,740
so that they can be helpful to you

353
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:23,439
as well.

354
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:25,180
But like first things first, just

355
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,199
set up some sort of

356
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:27,670
hiring funnel for the different

357
00:08:27,769 --> 00:08:29,230
roles that you might be hiring

358
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:29,550
for.

359
00:08:29,689 --> 00:08:32,740
Because you'll see as you

360
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:34,769
scale or as you start to scale and

361
00:08:34,769 --> 00:08:36,700
build out your company, a lot of

362
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,179
these roles are going to be

363
00:08:38,179 --> 00:08:38,580
repeated,

364
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:39,059
right?

365
00:08:39,158 --> 00:08:40,759
For client ascension, it's just

366
00:08:40,918 --> 00:08:43,639
going to come down to how can we

367
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:45,980
hire more closers and how can we

368
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:47,960
hire more student success coaches

369
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,940
as you know, the growth demands.

370
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:53,220
So here's the solution to that.

371
00:08:53,269 --> 00:08:53,730
Same way

372
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,070
we do it on the front end, we do

373
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:56,129
it on the back end with our hiring

374
00:08:56,299 --> 00:08:56,779
process.

375
00:08:56,779 --> 00:08:57,720
So again, hopefully this is

376
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,909
helpful and I'm looking forward to

377
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,080
seeing you guys implement this.
