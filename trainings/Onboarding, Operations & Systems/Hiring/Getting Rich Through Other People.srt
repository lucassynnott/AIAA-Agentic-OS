1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,000
All right, can you guys see it?

2
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:07,000
How do you feel so far?

3
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:08,000
Good?

4
00:00:08,028 --> 00:00:09,000
Good?

5
00:00:09,029 --> 00:00:10,000
Good.

6
00:00:10,029 --> 00:00:12,000
A little sleep deprived?

7
00:00:12,029 --> 00:00:13,000
A little tired?

8
00:00:13,029 --> 00:00:14,000
All right, all right.

9
00:00:14,029 --> 00:00:16,079
Everybody just take a deep breath

10
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:17,000
real quick.

11
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:22,989
Okay, good.

12
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:26,350
You guys, you can't let your

13
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:28,000
fatigue set in,

14
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:30,000
but there's a lot of the crazy,

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,989
crazy, crazy stuff you know

16
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:33,000
from .

17
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:35,000
Look at his screen.

18
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:38,000
His screen's bigger.

19
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:39,000
Why?

20
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:41,340
Why don't you have a screen like

21
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:42,000
that?

22
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:45,000
His screen's bigger than yours,

23
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:45,990
bro.

24
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:48,759
The more that you...

25
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:52,000
How much we can actually impact

26
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,000
people,

27
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:54,000
how much that we can help people

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
through our services.

29
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:56,439
Because somebody may not be super

30
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,590
passionate about Klaviyo for email

31
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,000
marketing,

32
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,299
but in reality, you guys, if you

33
00:01:01,299 --> 00:01:03,060
go far enough, are really changing

34
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:04,000
people's lives.

35
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:05,000
All right?

36
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:06,879
So back in 2020, this was when

37
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:08,489
Andre had gotten onto that bad

38
00:01:08,489 --> 00:01:10,000
partnership that he mentioned.

39
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:11,000
We were restarting the agency.

40
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:13,400
And we were struggling by their

41
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,000
footing.

42
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:15,000
We had one offer.

43
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:16,000
Didn't work.

44
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:17,000
Fell flat on our face.

45
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:18,000
We had another offer.

46
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:19,000
Didn't work.

47
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:20,000
Fell flat on our face.

48
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:20,780
We didn't know about cold email

49
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:21,000
yet.

50
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:22,560
This was before we took cold email

51
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,000
mastery.

52
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:24,000
Shout out to Lizard.

53
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:26,079
And we were getting calls through

54
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:27,000
paid media.

55
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:29,040
Which, for a young agency that has

56
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,000
no clients pretty much,

57
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:32,000
and is closing out like a 5% rate

58
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,989
because their sales guy sucks.

59
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:35,659
That's the tough situation to be

60
00:01:35,659 --> 00:01:36,000
in.

61
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:38,840
So, we found ourselves probably

62
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,000
five months in,

63
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:41,420
and just like, less than a

64
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:42,609
thousand bucks in the business

65
00:01:42,609 --> 00:01:43,000
bank.

66
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:45,000
It was really dark.

67
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:46,530
I'd like to think that we wouldn't

68
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:48,000
have quit if we hit zero,

69
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:49,379
but I can't tell you what we would

70
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:50,000
have done.

71
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:51,000
We might have.

72
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:52,000
We might not be here today,

73
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:53,609
and you guys might not be here

74
00:01:53,609 --> 00:01:55,000
today in this beautiful city

75
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:56,450
and this beautiful venue with all

76
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:58,000
these beautiful people.

77
00:01:58,030 --> 00:01:59,450
And for whatever reason, when I

78
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:01,000
was scrolling there,

79
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:02,689
on Instagram, Facebook, whatever

80
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:04,000
it may have been,

81
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:05,390
I clicked on this app, and I sent

82
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:06,000
it to Andre.

83
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:08,000
I was like, this is interesting.

84
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:09,530
And I read through it, and I was

85
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:11,469
like, man, this is really good

86
00:02:11,469 --> 00:02:11,990
copy.

87
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:14,000
Like, I want to buy this thing.

88
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:15,039
And we were in no position to

89
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:16,000
really buy anything.

90
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:17,000
Right?

91
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:19,319
Because we literally had zero

92
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:20,000
dollars.

93
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:21,590
Almost like we had just about

94
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:23,539
enough to sustain us for another

95
00:02:23,539 --> 00:02:23,990
month.

96
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:25,530
And this is only a 97-hour

97
00:02:25,539 --> 00:02:26,000
product.

98
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:27,060
I'm going to run out of hands, so

99
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,000
I think I am going to take this.

100
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:29,000
I'm going to take it.

101
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:30,580
Well, I'm going to take it because

102
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:32,990
I need to set it down and see it.

103
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:33,889
I was freaking out so much about

104
00:02:33,889 --> 00:02:35,439
it because it was helping the

105
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:36,000
sales process

106
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,050
and we just weren't closing deals

107
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:38,379
partially because we put it in our

108
00:02:38,379 --> 00:02:39,000
rider.

109
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:41,000
Yeah, I was like, Andre, listen.

110
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:42,000
You know what that is?

111
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:43,319
I'll work on this massive $97

112
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,000
investment.

113
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:46,000
I'll pay you back in full.

114
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:47,330
And I had no money in my bank

115
00:02:47,509 --> 00:02:48,000
account.

116
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:49,430
So that was like me basically

117
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,000
putting my life savings online.

118
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,680
I'm like, whatever it takes, I'm

119
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,000
going to do this thing.

120
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:56,000
I'm so convinced from this copy

121
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,659
and just from everything I've seen

122
00:02:57,659 --> 00:02:57,990
so far

123
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:59,460
about this guy that this is going

124
00:02:59,509 --> 00:03:00,000
to help.

125
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,000
Right?

126
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:02,000
The whole thing was about

127
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
increasing closure.

128
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:04,000
Hopefully that's compliant.

129
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:05,000
It is.

130
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:06,000
Okay.

131
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:07,000
Yeah.

132
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,000
Because it works.

133
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:09,000
Exactly.

134
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:10,000
Exactly.

135
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,000
And you know what?

136
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,120
The next 12 sales calls that I

137
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,000
took, I closed four.

138
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:14,319
For us that was massive because

139
00:03:14,419 --> 00:03:15,569
they also all had set up fees as

140
00:03:15,569 --> 00:03:16,000
well.

141
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:16,719
So that gave us enough cash,

142
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:17,000
right?

143
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,120
This was like just when we were

144
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,000
finding cold email.

145
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,490
So it was kind of perfect timing

146
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,000
with that.

147
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,639
Combining with me, finding this

148
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:24,250
course and going through it and

149
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,000
actually having a real sales

150
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:27,000
process.

151
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:28,800
And right off the bat, just like

152
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,669
you said, my close rate went from

153
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:32,000
shit to 33%.

154
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:33,569
And since then we've had good

155
00:03:33,569 --> 00:03:35,530
months, we've had bad months, you

156
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:36,000
know, like with anything.

157
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:37,159
There's always going to be another

158
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:38,000
problem that pops up.

159
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:39,000
The grass is always green, right?

160
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:40,430
There's always more that you can

161
00:03:40,509 --> 00:03:41,000
be doing.

162
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,000
But we never really look back.

163
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:44,069
From that moment on, after I took

164
00:03:44,069 --> 00:03:46,150
that course, we've always had

165
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,000
clients.

166
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:48,000
We've always had money coming in.

167
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,800
And that was when we started to

168
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:51,990
actually build a real business.

169
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:53,409
And the guy who made that course

170
00:03:53,509 --> 00:03:55,000
is standing right over there.

171
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:57,280
So when this guy's talking, it can

172
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,990
legitimately change the business

173
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
of speaking from personal

174
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,439
personal experience and basically

175
00:04:01,509 --> 00:04:02,000
save ours.

176
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:03,719
And hopefully that builds up

177
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:05,370
enough credibility because we

178
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,000
obviously build a couple of cool

179
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:07,000
businesses.

180
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:08,000
That's why you guys are all here.

181
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:09,000
It's really just fantastic.

182
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:10,000
So take notes.

183
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:11,000
Take notes.

184
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:12,379
Without further ado, we're

185
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,000
welcome.

186
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:15,000
Man, get along.

187
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:17,000
Thanks, bro.

188
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:18,000
You're the man.

189
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:21,000
What's up, crew?

190
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:22,000
How we doing?

191
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:23,000
How we doing?

192
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:25,000
Hey, let's stand up real fast.

193
00:04:25,029 --> 00:04:26,000
Let's do it.

194
00:04:26,029 --> 00:04:27,000
Come on, stand up.

195
00:04:27,029 --> 00:04:28,470
Let's give a round of applause for

196
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:29,000
the wizard, for Andre.

197
00:04:29,029 --> 00:04:30,000
for Christian.

198
00:04:30,029 --> 00:04:32,600
Hey, look at them in the eyes and

199
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,990
say thank you.

200
00:04:34,029 --> 00:04:36,000
Yeah.

201
00:04:36,029 --> 00:04:38,000
As you collect the applause.

202
00:04:38,029 --> 00:04:39,000
All right.

203
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:40,000
You can sit back down.

204
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:41,019
How many of you run events as

205
00:04:41,019 --> 00:04:42,000
you're sitting down?

206
00:04:42,029 --> 00:04:43,000
Raise your hands.

207
00:04:43,029 --> 00:04:45,000
Nobody.

208
00:04:45,029 --> 00:04:46,000
How many of you run events?

209
00:04:46,029 --> 00:04:49,000
So you guys know it's hard.

210
00:04:49,029 --> 00:04:50,000
It's hard.

211
00:04:50,029 --> 00:04:51,639
How hard is it to put this thing

212
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:52,000
on?

213
00:04:52,029 --> 00:04:54,000
It's a lot of work, isn't it?

214
00:04:54,029 --> 00:04:55,000
Yeah.

215
00:04:55,029 --> 00:04:56,000
It's a lot of work.

216
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:57,000
And it's a lot of money.

217
00:04:57,029 --> 00:04:59,839
Believe me?

218
00:05:00,029 --> 00:05:03,000
You lost money on it.

219
00:05:03,029 --> 00:05:04,689
So we should give them another

220
00:05:04,689 --> 00:05:06,000
round of applause.

221
00:05:11,029 --> 00:05:13,000
Can you guys see me okay?

222
00:05:13,029 --> 00:05:14,000
No.

223
00:05:14,029 --> 00:05:15,000
No?

224
00:05:15,029 --> 00:05:16,000
Cool.

225
00:05:16,029 --> 00:05:17,000
Perfect.

226
00:05:17,029 --> 00:05:18,629
We're going to talk a little bit

227
00:05:18,629 --> 00:05:19,000
about,

228
00:05:19,029 --> 00:05:20,449
we're going to talk about how to

229
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:21,000
hire teams

230
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:23,000
and how to manage teams.

231
00:05:23,029 --> 00:05:24,000
And real quick,

232
00:05:24,029 --> 00:05:26,959
if you've done the math on your

233
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:28,000
targets in your business,

234
00:05:28,029 --> 00:05:29,000
raise your hands.

235
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:31,000
Targets in your business.

236
00:05:31,029 --> 00:05:32,449
If you've never sat down and run

237
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:34,000
the math on targets in your

238
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,000
business,

239
00:05:34,029 --> 00:05:36,000
how much money you want to make.

240
00:05:36,029 --> 00:05:39,000
You've never done that.

241
00:05:39,029 --> 00:05:42,000
You raise your hand.

242
00:05:42,029 --> 00:05:43,000
You raise your hands.

243
00:05:43,029 --> 00:05:45,279
You guys have been coddled by the

244
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:46,000
speakers.

245
00:05:46,029 --> 00:05:47,000
I'm going to make you talk to me.

246
00:05:47,029 --> 00:05:48,800
Raise your hand if you've done the

247
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,000
math on your business.

248
00:05:50,029 --> 00:05:52,000
On your targets.

249
00:05:52,029 --> 00:05:53,000
It's okay.

250
00:05:53,029 --> 00:05:55,000
Throw them all up in the air.

251
00:05:55,029 --> 00:05:56,089
How many of you have something to

252
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:57,000
write down notes with?

253
00:05:58,029 --> 00:06:00,000
Do me a favor.

254
00:06:00,029 --> 00:06:03,180
Have you ever visualized the

255
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:05,269
amount of money that you want to

256
00:06:05,269 --> 00:06:06,000
make from your business?

257
00:06:06,029 --> 00:06:07,000
Yes or no?

258
00:06:07,029 --> 00:06:08,000
Yes.

259
00:06:08,029 --> 00:06:09,000
Write that number down real fast.

260
00:06:09,029 --> 00:06:11,610
On whatever it is you're taking

261
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:12,990
notes with.

262
00:06:13,029 --> 00:06:18,579
How many of you have gotten really

263
00:06:18,579 --> 00:06:22,000
excited at an event like this,

264
00:06:22,029 --> 00:06:23,540
in a cool room like this with

265
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:25,000
entrepreneurs like this,

266
00:06:26,029 --> 00:06:27,259
you're really excited to go make

267
00:06:27,259 --> 00:06:28,000
your goals happen,

268
00:06:28,029 --> 00:06:29,329
only to get back into the work

269
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:30,000
environment.

270
00:06:30,029 --> 00:06:32,000
And it's hard as hell.

271
00:06:32,029 --> 00:06:34,000
And maybe even you're like,

272
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:34,660
I don't even know if I want that

273
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:35,000
anymore.

274
00:06:35,029 --> 00:06:37,000
And you change your goals.

275
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,839
Anybody?

276
00:06:40,029 --> 00:06:42,000
Yeah?

277
00:06:42,029 --> 00:06:44,699
Today, what I want to talk to you

278
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:45,000
about is,

279
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:47,250
I want to talk to you about how to

280
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,000
hit these targets

281
00:06:48,029 --> 00:06:49,569
without actually having to do any

282
00:06:49,569 --> 00:06:50,000
work.

283
00:06:50,029 --> 00:06:51,529
Raise your hand if that's exciting

284
00:06:51,529 --> 00:06:52,000
to you.

285
00:06:55,029 --> 00:06:56,250
If you would like to hit the

286
00:06:56,509 --> 00:06:57,730
numbers that you say you want to

287
00:06:57,730 --> 00:06:58,000
hit with,

288
00:06:58,029 --> 00:07:00,000
with being able to be perfectly

289
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,410
positioned as a founder, CEO, and

290
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:05,000
someone who thinks for a living.

291
00:07:05,029 --> 00:07:06,000
Sound good?

292
00:07:06,029 --> 00:07:07,000
Yes.

293
00:07:07,029 --> 00:07:08,339
This will be interactive if you

294
00:07:08,389 --> 00:07:09,000
can't tell.

295
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:13,060
So, like, if I feel like,

296
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:13,990
hopefully I don't feed back here.

297
00:07:14,029 --> 00:07:16,000
I'm going to do it anyways.

298
00:07:16,029 --> 00:07:18,160
If I feel like you're not talking

299
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,720
back to me, then we're just going

300
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:23,000
to like, have a moment.

301
00:07:23,029 --> 00:07:25,000
Are you safe?

302
00:07:25,029 --> 00:07:25,779
Are you going to sue me if I touch

303
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:26,000
you?

304
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:28,000
You're good.

305
00:07:28,029 --> 00:07:29,000
I love your shirt.

306
00:07:29,029 --> 00:07:30,000
It's amazing.

307
00:07:30,029 --> 00:07:31,149
We've got to raise the level of

308
00:07:31,149 --> 00:07:33,000
the room for a minute, because if

309
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I can get you guys to not only

310
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
participate in what we're doing,

311
00:07:38,029 --> 00:07:40,000
but to write your own notes down.

312
00:07:40,029 --> 00:07:41,000
Did I do something to break this?

313
00:07:41,029 --> 00:07:43,000
Oh, there we go.

314
00:07:44,029 --> 00:07:45,180
If I can get you guys to

315
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:47,180
participate actively with me, you

316
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:48,779
will go home and you will change

317
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,000
your lives forever.

318
00:07:50,029 --> 00:07:52,490
If I could promise you, this is a

319
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:54,720
guarantee, by the way, if I could

320
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,670
promise you that in the next 60

321
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:58,399
minutes I could help you hit your

322
00:07:58,399 --> 00:07:59,620
targets without having you to

323
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,000
actually do all of the work,

324
00:08:01,029 --> 00:08:03,500
would you invest 60 minutes with

325
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,980
no distractions into making that

326
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:08,000
happy?

327
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:09,000
Yes or no?

328
00:08:09,029 --> 00:08:10,000
Hell yes.

329
00:08:10,029 --> 00:08:11,000
This is me.

330
00:08:11,029 --> 00:08:13,000
Go ahead and look and say, aw.

331
00:08:13,029 --> 00:08:16,000
This is a Memphis Grizzlies hat.

332
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:20,579
I was broke, 24 years old, no

333
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:24,000
money, hated my job.

334
00:08:24,029 --> 00:08:25,000
Can you relate to this?

335
00:08:25,029 --> 00:08:27,339
And one day my wife says, this is

336
00:08:27,339 --> 00:08:28,990
my wife right here.

337
00:08:29,029 --> 00:08:31,000
How many of you are married?

338
00:08:31,029 --> 00:08:32,000
Let me see a show of hands.

339
00:08:32,029 --> 00:08:34,000
Congrats.

340
00:08:34,029 --> 00:08:35,000
There's nothing like it.

341
00:08:35,029 --> 00:08:35,639
How many of you want to be

342
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:36,000
married?

343
00:08:37,029 --> 00:08:38,000
Cool.

344
00:08:38,029 --> 00:08:39,000
We'll work on that.

345
00:08:39,029 --> 00:08:43,250
One day my wife comes home and

346
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,970
she's like, hey, I think that you

347
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:48,000
should quit your job.

348
00:08:48,029 --> 00:08:50,000
I was like, why?

349
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:52,000
My wife was an entrepreneur.

350
00:08:52,029 --> 00:08:53,000
I wasn't.

351
00:08:53,029 --> 00:08:54,720
My wife made a ton of money

352
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,000
compared to me.

353
00:08:56,029 --> 00:08:57,960
But she said, I think you should

354
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,929
quit your job because you're not

355
00:08:59,929 --> 00:09:01,700
making any money and you hate your

356
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:02,000
job.

357
00:09:03,029 --> 00:09:04,590
And I said, okay, I'll quit my

358
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:05,000
job.

359
00:09:05,029 --> 00:09:06,620
And I started, I started buying

360
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:07,000
books.

361
00:09:07,029 --> 00:09:09,000
That was my first home office.

362
00:09:09,029 --> 00:09:14,980
Just let them pass for a second.

363
00:09:16,029 --> 00:09:18,070
It was my first home office and

364
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:20,210
one day I came home with a pile of

365
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:21,000
books.

366
00:09:21,029 --> 00:09:23,000
How many of you enjoy reading?

367
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:25,000
Or buying courses?

368
00:09:25,029 --> 00:09:27,000
Yeah, yeah.

369
00:09:27,029 --> 00:09:28,000
This was like 2012.

370
00:09:28,029 --> 00:09:30,490
Your courses is like you had Tai

371
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:31,990
Lopez and Mobe.

372
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:34,000
This is it.

373
00:09:34,029 --> 00:09:35,000
Anybody remember that?

374
00:09:35,029 --> 00:09:36,000
Like basically an MLM thing.

375
00:09:37,029 --> 00:09:38,179
My wife, she was like, I'm going

376
00:09:38,179 --> 00:09:39,120
to sign up for this network

377
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,000
marketing thing.

378
00:09:40,029 --> 00:09:42,000
And I'm like, okay, cool.

379
00:09:42,029 --> 00:09:43,000
Get scammed.

380
00:09:43,029 --> 00:09:44,000
I'm going to buy books on Amazon.

381
00:09:44,029 --> 00:09:46,340
And I come home and I got lucky

382
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:47,450
one day and I read a book called

383
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:47,990
Psycho-Cybernetics.

384
00:09:48,029 --> 00:09:50,000
Anybody read this book?

385
00:09:50,029 --> 00:09:52,000
Yo, this is a fire book.

386
00:09:52,029 --> 00:09:53,350
If you haven't read this book, you

387
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:54,470
should read it like tomorrow

388
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:55,000
morning.

389
00:09:55,029 --> 00:09:58,070
It changed the way I thought about

390
00:09:58,070 --> 00:09:59,750
identity and it changed the way

391
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:01,000
that I thought about myself.

392
00:10:02,029 --> 00:10:03,000
I started making money.

393
00:10:03,029 --> 00:10:05,230
I started making really good

394
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,000
money.

395
00:10:06,029 --> 00:10:09,000
So I went as an entrepreneur.

396
00:10:09,029 --> 00:10:10,899
You guys remember the picture of

397
00:10:10,899 --> 00:10:12,000
my home office.

398
00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:16,659
I started making tons and tons and

399
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:19,000
tons of money.

400
00:10:19,029 --> 00:10:22,000
I went from basically nothing,

401
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,210
broke, working at a church, to

402
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:26,000
4,000 clients at a profit, by the

403
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,000
way.

404
00:10:26,029 --> 00:10:28,850
The pros, I'm going to give you

405
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:30,200
some things that you're going to

406
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,000
want to write down.

407
00:10:32,029 --> 00:10:34,000
And this will be one of them.

408
00:10:34,029 --> 00:10:36,009
The professionals care about

409
00:10:36,009 --> 00:10:37,000
customers.

410
00:10:37,029 --> 00:10:38,919
Amateurs are focused on lead

411
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:40,000
generation.

412
00:10:40,029 --> 00:10:42,000
No offense.

413
00:10:42,029 --> 00:10:43,570
Professionals are focused on

414
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:45,000
customer acquisition.

415
00:10:45,029 --> 00:10:47,000
And we started printing customers.

416
00:10:47,029 --> 00:10:49,289
We got over 4,000 clients at

417
00:10:49,289 --> 00:10:50,000
profit.

418
00:10:50,029 --> 00:10:51,139
A couple hundred thousand

419
00:10:51,509 --> 00:10:52,179
customers came into the

420
00:10:52,179 --> 00:10:53,000
organization.

421
00:10:53,029 --> 00:10:56,000
700 team members.

422
00:10:57,029 --> 00:10:59,759
I've hired 700 staff and fired

423
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:00,990
most of them.

424
00:11:01,029 --> 00:11:03,000
Which is exhausting.

425
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:05,450
The capital cost of having to fire

426
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:06,990
that many people.

427
00:11:07,029 --> 00:11:07,980
And it took me a long time to

428
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,000
figure the system out.

429
00:11:09,029 --> 00:11:10,350
At one point I woke up and I was

430
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:12,700
spending over $800,000 a month in

431
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,000
team and fixed costs.

432
00:11:14,029 --> 00:11:16,840
That's a lot.

433
00:11:18,029 --> 00:11:20,000
And I still fired everybody.

434
00:11:20,029 --> 00:11:21,259
Because I didn't know what I do

435
00:11:21,259 --> 00:11:22,610
today and what I'm going to teach

436
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:23,000
you.

437
00:11:23,029 --> 00:11:24,409
And you can see there's a lot of

438
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:25,000
people.

439
00:11:25,029 --> 00:11:27,269
Anybody ever seen 100,000 people

440
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:28,000
all at once?

441
00:11:28,029 --> 00:11:30,000
Yes, no?

442
00:11:30,029 --> 00:11:32,000
Do we need margaritas?

443
00:11:32,029 --> 00:11:34,000
Or some cigars?

444
00:11:34,029 --> 00:11:36,240
We can do cigars but maybe later

445
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,990
we'll do margaritas.

446
00:11:39,029 --> 00:11:40,269
I'll make you stand up and sit

447
00:11:40,269 --> 00:11:41,460
down as many damn times as it

448
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:42,000
takes.

449
00:11:42,029 --> 00:11:43,000
100,000 students.

450
00:11:43,029 --> 00:11:46,159
We had over a couple million email

451
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:48,000
names, addresses.

452
00:11:48,029 --> 00:11:49,350
One of the worst things that ever

453
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:50,659
happened to me is I actually went

454
00:11:50,659 --> 00:11:53,000
through a bit of,

455
00:11:53,029 --> 00:11:55,299
you could call it a battle, with

456
00:11:55,299 --> 00:11:57,059
the regulatory agency in the

457
00:11:57,059 --> 00:11:58,000
United States.

458
00:11:58,029 --> 00:11:59,929
And I had to give all of these

459
00:11:59,929 --> 00:12:01,000
names back.

460
00:12:01,029 --> 00:12:02,690
Two million people we just had to

461
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:04,000
delete essentially.

462
00:12:05,029 --> 00:12:06,799
And we scaled this thing from zero

463
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:08,620
to multiple millions of dollars a

464
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:09,000
month.

465
00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:10,440
But then something started to

466
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:11,000
happen.

467
00:12:11,029 --> 00:12:12,000
I started to burn out.

468
00:12:12,029 --> 00:12:13,000
Somebody say burn out.

469
00:12:13,029 --> 00:12:14,000
Burn out.

470
00:12:14,029 --> 00:12:14,659
Have you ever felt close to

471
00:12:14,659 --> 00:12:15,000
burnout?

472
00:12:15,029 --> 00:12:17,000
Yeah?

473
00:12:17,029 --> 00:12:18,000
Or you're running out of energy?

474
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:21,000
Man, it's the scariest feeling.

475
00:12:21,029 --> 00:12:23,659
Because you never know if you're

476
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:26,200
going to come back from this

477
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,000
feeling of burnout.

478
00:12:27,029 --> 00:12:29,570
And I hit burnout and by the year

479
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:32,480
2022, all of the companies were

480
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,000
gone.

481
00:12:34,029 --> 00:12:35,000
It was crazy.

482
00:12:35,029 --> 00:12:37,000
700 staff, millions of names,

483
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:37,639
hundreds of thousands of

484
00:12:37,639 --> 00:12:39,840
customers, thousands and thousands

485
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:40,000
of clients.

486
00:12:40,029 --> 00:12:41,870
And I basically burned it because

487
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:43,000
I got burned out.

488
00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:44,590
Now, anybody right now asking

489
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:45,750
like, why would I learn from this

490
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:48,000
person if he basically destroyed?

491
00:12:48,029 --> 00:12:50,429
Because if you can destroy eight

492
00:12:50,429 --> 00:12:53,029
figure companies, you can build

493
00:12:53,029 --> 00:12:53,990
them too.

494
00:12:54,029 --> 00:12:55,240
So I've built and destroyed more

495
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,509
eight figure companies than most

496
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:57,000
people.

497
00:12:58,029 --> 00:12:59,690
And the reason that I got into

498
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:01,610
this place of burnout is because

499
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:03,720
how many hours in a day do we

500
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,000
have?

501
00:13:05,029 --> 00:13:10,000
That's it.

502
00:13:11,029 --> 00:13:15,750
And the only way to get more than

503
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:20,000
24 hours is to buy it.

504
00:13:20,029 --> 00:13:23,700
And you can purchase labor,

505
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:27,690
talents, and decisions and people

506
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:29,669
can multiply the amount of time

507
00:13:29,669 --> 00:13:31,679
that you have in a day if you know

508
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:34,000
the stuff that I am going to take.

509
00:13:34,029 --> 00:13:36,159
So, by the way, does anybody want

510
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:37,990
to have a copy of my slides?

511
00:13:38,029 --> 00:13:39,000
Yes.

512
00:13:39,029 --> 00:13:40,610
I can tell you guys, like, do I

513
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:42,000
take a picture of this?

514
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:43,000
It's a nice circle.

515
00:13:43,029 --> 00:13:45,139
It's like, I want to remember this

516
00:13:45,139 --> 00:13:46,000
for later.

517
00:13:47,029 --> 00:13:48,000
You don't have to.

518
00:13:48,029 --> 00:13:50,019
I actually put all the slides

519
00:13:50,019 --> 00:13:51,000
together.

520
00:13:51,029 --> 00:13:52,000
Pull out your phones real fast.

521
00:13:52,029 --> 00:13:52,460
If you go to

522
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:54,610
taylorawells.com/ascension, you

523
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:57,990
can download my slides.

524
00:13:58,029 --> 00:14:00,000
Make me one promise.

525
00:14:00,029 --> 00:14:01,000
Do not skip ahead.

526
00:14:01,029 --> 00:14:04,990
I hate that shit.

527
00:14:05,029 --> 00:14:08,000
It's disrespectful.

528
00:14:11,029 --> 00:14:12,289
And then look back up at me when

529
00:14:12,289 --> 00:14:13,659
you're done and we'll get back to

530
00:14:13,659 --> 00:14:14,000
it.

531
00:14:14,029 --> 00:14:18,259
If you need help spelling

532
00:14:18,509 --> 00:14:23,000
ascension, let me know.

533
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:26,000
Yeah, some of y'all are like...

534
00:14:26,029 --> 00:14:28,000
Yeah, it's tough.

535
00:14:28,029 --> 00:14:29,000
It's a big word.

536
00:14:29,029 --> 00:14:31,000
It's a big word.

537
00:14:31,029 --> 00:14:33,000
Do you need help?

538
00:14:33,029 --> 00:14:34,000
You got it, bro?

539
00:14:34,029 --> 00:14:35,000
Okay.

540
00:14:35,029 --> 00:14:37,000
With an O.

541
00:14:37,029 --> 00:14:40,000
T-A-Y-L-O-R.

542
00:14:40,029 --> 00:14:41,450
All right, how about we do this at

543
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:42,000
the end?

544
00:14:42,029 --> 00:14:44,110
It's taking you guys a really, a

545
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:45,990
really long time.

546
00:14:46,029 --> 00:14:48,330
Well, I'll just give it to you,

547
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:49,000
okay?

548
00:14:49,029 --> 00:14:51,080
I got some goodies for you guys up

549
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,000
my sleeve.

550
00:14:52,029 --> 00:14:53,000
Sound good?

551
00:14:53,029 --> 00:14:55,000
Say, "Whoo!"

552
00:14:55,029 --> 00:14:57,000
Man, I love rooms like this.

553
00:14:57,029 --> 00:14:59,000
Entrepreneurs change the world.

554
00:14:59,029 --> 00:15:00,820
The world hangs in the balance of

555
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:02,000
people like you.

556
00:15:02,029 --> 00:15:04,000
You realize this?

557
00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:06,090
Like, nothing good ever, ever,

558
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:07,669
ever happened without somebody

559
00:15:07,669 --> 00:15:08,000
selling something,

560
00:15:09,029 --> 00:15:10,379
inventing something or marketing

561
00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:11,000
something.

562
00:15:11,029 --> 00:15:13,340
So, this is the highest honor to

563
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:15,509
be able to come and learn how to

564
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:16,990
build movement.

565
00:15:18,029 --> 00:15:19,330
And I basically torched the old

566
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:20,000
companies.

567
00:15:20,029 --> 00:15:21,000
Somebody say, "Torched."

568
00:15:21,029 --> 00:15:22,000
Torched.

569
00:15:22,029 --> 00:15:23,000
Just set them on fire.

570
00:15:23,029 --> 00:15:24,000
Killed them.

571
00:15:24,029 --> 00:15:27,029
And over the three months in the

572
00:15:27,029 --> 00:15:28,580
summer, I decided to reverse

573
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:29,000
engineer.

574
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:31,000
This is a powerful lesson.

575
00:15:31,029 --> 00:15:32,129
If you have something in your life

576
00:15:32,129 --> 00:15:33,179
that you do not like right now,

577
00:15:33,179 --> 00:15:34,000
raise your hands.

578
00:15:34,029 --> 00:15:36,000
Keep them up.

579
00:15:37,029 --> 00:15:38,000
Cool.

580
00:15:38,029 --> 00:15:40,759
Everyone in the room has their

581
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:41,990
hands up.

582
00:15:42,029 --> 00:15:43,740
Which is good, because I was going

583
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,000
to call you out if you didn't.

584
00:15:45,029 --> 00:15:47,090
The greatest thing you can learn

585
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:49,220
how to do is reverse engineer,

586
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:51,000
because this is Charlie Mugger.

587
00:15:51,029 --> 00:15:52,070
He said, "If you just tell me

588
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:53,299
where I'm going to die, I'll just

589
00:15:53,299 --> 00:15:54,000
not go there."

590
00:15:54,029 --> 00:15:56,000
He's reverse engineering.

591
00:15:57,029 --> 00:15:58,000
And so, I reverse engineer.

592
00:15:58,029 --> 00:15:59,899
What is it that makes businesses

593
00:15:59,899 --> 00:16:01,000
work long term?

594
00:16:01,029 --> 00:16:02,000
There's eight categories.

595
00:16:02,029 --> 00:16:03,600
I'm going to actually read them to

596
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,000
you.

597
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:04,929
You can write them down if you

598
00:16:04,929 --> 00:16:06,000
want, but you do not have to.

599
00:16:06,029 --> 00:16:07,000
The first is marketing.

600
00:16:07,029 --> 00:16:08,000
Somebody say, "Marketing."

601
00:16:08,029 --> 00:16:10,009
Marketing is defined as the

602
00:16:10,009 --> 00:16:12,370
acquisition of attention and

603
00:16:12,919 --> 00:16:13,990
reputation.

604
00:16:15,029 --> 00:16:17,370
People don't think about this, but

605
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:19,360
if you convert people, they should

606
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,000
not be converted.

607
00:16:20,029 --> 00:16:21,299
You actually chip away at your

608
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:22,000
reputation.

609
00:16:22,029 --> 00:16:23,000
True or false?

610
00:16:23,029 --> 00:16:24,000
True.

611
00:16:24,029 --> 00:16:25,000
The second is sales.

612
00:16:25,029 --> 00:16:26,889
This is monetization and

613
00:16:26,889 --> 00:16:28,000
certainty.

614
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:29,899
The third is offer, desire,

615
00:16:29,899 --> 00:16:31,000
fulfillment.

616
00:16:31,029 --> 00:16:32,000
This is your deliverable.

617
00:16:32,029 --> 00:16:33,620
How many of you feel like you have

618
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:35,179
a great offer right now to offer

619
00:16:35,179 --> 00:16:35,990
your crowd?

620
00:16:36,029 --> 00:16:38,000
Cool.

621
00:16:38,029 --> 00:16:40,000
The fourth is finance.

622
00:16:40,029 --> 00:16:43,000
If you like money, say, "Yeah."

623
00:16:44,029 --> 00:16:46,000
Money is a great thing.

624
00:16:46,029 --> 00:16:48,000
You know, we're raised societally

625
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,120
that, you know, if you're just

626
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,000
like a capitalist, rich

627
00:16:51,029 --> 00:16:52,309
capitalist, there's nothing wrong

628
00:16:52,309 --> 00:16:53,610
with you, but capitalists actually

629
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:54,000
finance everything.

630
00:16:54,029 --> 00:16:56,000
And so, it's good to have money.

631
00:16:56,029 --> 00:16:57,000
Next is team.

632
00:16:57,029 --> 00:16:58,000
Say team.

633
00:16:58,029 --> 00:16:59,419
This is what we're going to focus

634
00:16:59,509 --> 00:17:00,000
on today.

635
00:17:00,029 --> 00:17:01,279
How do I build a team that

636
00:17:01,509 --> 00:17:03,000
multiplies the hours in the day

637
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
and hits all of my targets?

638
00:17:05,029 --> 00:17:06,059
The subtitle is how to get rich

639
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:07,000
through other people.

640
00:17:07,029 --> 00:17:08,000
And this is the key.

641
00:17:08,029 --> 00:17:10,000
It's a symbiotic relationship.

642
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,259
And I'm going to give you guys

643
00:17:11,509 --> 00:17:12,000
frameworks.

644
00:17:12,029 --> 00:17:13,559
If you do have a team, can I see a

645
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:15,000
show of hands real fast?

646
00:17:15,029 --> 00:17:16,000
Amazing.

647
00:17:16,029 --> 00:17:17,000
It's a change of life.

648
00:17:17,029 --> 00:17:18,130
I think it will be an amazing

649
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:19,000
training for you.

650
00:17:19,029 --> 00:17:20,000
And when you have all of these,

651
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,369
the next is balance, mind work,

652
00:17:21,369 --> 00:17:22,000
retention.

653
00:17:22,029 --> 00:17:23,460
I run a company today that trains

654
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:25,000
on all of these eight drivers.

655
00:17:25,029 --> 00:17:27,338
And so, today I'm going to give

656
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:30,000
you about 5% of the team playbook.

657
00:17:31,029 --> 00:17:32,140
And we basically go in and we

658
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:33,309
equip members on how to build

659
00:17:33,309 --> 00:17:34,000
their teams.

660
00:17:34,029 --> 00:17:35,349
I'm going to give you guys

661
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:37,099
actually the entire playbook at

662
00:17:37,099 --> 00:17:38,000
the end for free because I don't

663
00:17:38,029 --> 00:17:39,000
need your money.

664
00:17:39,029 --> 00:17:40,140
When you actually get this right,

665
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:41,200
there's only two things that can

666
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,000
kill your business.

667
00:17:42,029 --> 00:17:43,000
Two.

668
00:17:43,029 --> 00:17:43,779
Would you like to know what they

669
00:17:43,779 --> 00:17:44,000
are?

670
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:45,000
Yes.

671
00:17:45,029 --> 00:17:46,000
You want me to keep going?

672
00:17:46,029 --> 00:17:47,000
Yes.

673
00:17:47,029 --> 00:17:48,000
You sure?

674
00:17:48,029 --> 00:17:51,529
Number one, taking the wrong

675
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:53,000
clients.

676
00:17:53,029 --> 00:17:55,000
Think about it.

677
00:17:55,029 --> 00:17:56,880
How many of y'all just took a

678
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,990
client to hit your numbers?

679
00:17:59,029 --> 00:18:01,960
Then they ruined your literal

680
00:18:02,109 --> 00:18:02,990
life.

681
00:18:04,029 --> 00:18:05,869
There's nothing worse than taking

682
00:18:05,869 --> 00:18:07,000
the wrong client.

683
00:18:07,029 --> 00:18:09,609
The only way, the only acceptable

684
00:18:09,609 --> 00:18:11,730
way to get rich is through the

685
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,000
exchange of service.

686
00:18:13,029 --> 00:18:15,470
The second thing that can kill

687
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:18,250
your business is hiring the wrong

688
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:18,990
team.

689
00:18:19,029 --> 00:18:22,700
If you've ever had the wrong team

690
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:25,039
members, don't look at them if

691
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:26,000
they're here with you.

692
00:18:26,029 --> 00:18:29,000
But man, you know it's a pain.

693
00:18:29,029 --> 00:18:30,779
And then the hardest thing is

694
00:18:30,779 --> 00:18:32,859
getting rid of them after you know

695
00:18:32,859 --> 00:18:34,000
that they're not the

696
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:35,000
right hire.

697
00:18:35,029 --> 00:18:37,049
You're in an event called Client

698
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:38,000
Ascension.

699
00:18:38,029 --> 00:18:39,450
These guys are some of the best in

700
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:41,000
the world at getting clients.

701
00:18:41,029 --> 00:18:41,970
So I'm not going to talk a lot

702
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:43,000
about getting clients.

703
00:18:43,029 --> 00:18:44,000
You've been trained on that.

704
00:18:44,029 --> 00:18:45,750
But what I am going to teach you

705
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,579
is how do I assemble an Avengers

706
00:18:47,579 --> 00:18:49,980
squad that can multiply

707
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:51,000
my business.

708
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:52,000
You want to hit nine figures?

709
00:18:52,029 --> 00:18:53,250
Only way you're doing it is

710
00:18:53,509 --> 00:18:54,000
through a team.

711
00:18:54,029 --> 00:18:55,450
Or else you're going to lose your

712
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:56,000
minds.

713
00:18:56,029 --> 00:18:57,000
Okay?

714
00:18:57,029 --> 00:18:58,000
We're going to do some exercises.

715
00:18:58,029 --> 00:18:59,000
Is that cool?

716
00:18:59,029 --> 00:19:00,000
Yeah.

717
00:19:00,029 --> 00:19:02,000
So here's what I want you to do.

718
00:19:02,029 --> 00:19:02,960
And before I prep you for this,

719
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,000
but we're going to get ready.

720
00:19:04,029 --> 00:19:05,359
We're going to put some time on

721
00:19:05,509 --> 00:19:06,000
the clock.

722
00:19:06,029 --> 00:19:07,779
Write this down in whatever you're

723
00:19:07,779 --> 00:19:09,000
using to take notes.

724
00:19:09,029 --> 00:19:11,000
You can make money by doing stuff.

725
00:19:11,029 --> 00:19:12,000
Somebody say stuff.

726
00:19:12,029 --> 00:19:13,000
Stuff.

727
00:19:13,029 --> 00:19:15,250
But you get really rich by what

728
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:16,000
you don't do.

729
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:21,000
You can make money by doing stuff.

730
00:19:21,029 --> 00:19:24,920
But you get really rich by what

731
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,990
you don't do.

732
00:19:27,029 --> 00:19:29,000
You guys know what a to-do list

733
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
is, right?

734
00:19:30,029 --> 00:19:31,000
Yeah.

735
00:19:31,029 --> 00:19:32,000
We all have a to-do list.

736
00:19:32,029 --> 00:19:35,000
But you have a do not do list.

737
00:19:35,029 --> 00:19:37,099
Something written down like I will

738
00:19:37,099 --> 00:19:38,000
not do this.

739
00:19:38,029 --> 00:19:39,000
The money is energy.

740
00:19:39,029 --> 00:19:40,000
And it flows.

741
00:19:40,029 --> 00:19:41,380
And it interacts with the realm of

742
00:19:41,509 --> 00:19:42,000
the spirit.

743
00:19:42,029 --> 00:19:44,000
I just get really weird sometimes.

744
00:19:44,029 --> 00:19:46,809
Because if you do things that you

745
00:19:46,809 --> 00:19:49,509
hate doing, you actually will end

746
00:19:49,509 --> 00:19:51,000
up killing the business.

747
00:19:51,029 --> 00:19:52,450
Because it's not worth it for the

748
00:19:52,519 --> 00:19:53,000
money.

749
00:19:53,029 --> 00:19:54,000
And we're going to prove that.

750
00:19:54,029 --> 00:19:55,000
So I'm going to prove it to you.

751
00:19:55,029 --> 00:19:56,000
We'll get into it.

752
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:57,000
First exercise.

753
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,000
You ready?

754
00:19:58,029 --> 00:19:59,369
We're going to put two minutes on

755
00:19:59,509 --> 00:20:00,000
the clock.

756
00:20:00,029 --> 00:20:01,549
And did you guys write your goals

757
00:20:01,549 --> 00:20:03,000
down in the first section?

758
00:20:03,029 --> 00:20:06,000
Were you obedient or rebellious?

759
00:20:06,029 --> 00:20:08,000
You wrote them down?

760
00:20:08,029 --> 00:20:09,000
Okay.

761
00:20:09,029 --> 00:20:09,670
We're going to put two minutes on

762
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:10,000
the clock.

763
00:20:10,029 --> 00:20:11,420
I'm going to actually turn some

764
00:20:11,509 --> 00:20:12,000
music on.

765
00:20:12,029 --> 00:20:13,000
This isn't weird.

766
00:20:13,029 --> 00:20:14,000
Don't make it weird.

767
00:20:14,029 --> 00:20:15,000
Don't make it weird.

768
00:20:15,029 --> 00:20:16,450
But I want you to write down three

769
00:20:16,519 --> 00:20:17,000
things.

770
00:20:17,029 --> 00:20:18,000
You ready?

771
00:20:18,029 --> 00:20:20,490
The first is, what is the amount

772
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:23,000
of money you make per month?

773
00:20:23,029 --> 00:20:25,000
By what date?

774
00:20:25,029 --> 00:20:27,339
And what are the things that you

775
00:20:27,339 --> 00:20:29,500
are not doing on a day-to-day

776
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,000
basis to make that money?

777
00:20:32,029 --> 00:20:33,000
Think of it this way.

778
00:20:33,029 --> 00:20:34,430
If there's things that are going

779
00:20:34,509 --> 00:20:35,910
on in your business right now that

780
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:37,000
you don't enjoy doing,

781
00:20:37,029 --> 00:20:38,000
write those things down.

782
00:20:38,029 --> 00:20:39,380
Because we're going to cross those

783
00:20:39,509 --> 00:20:40,000
things off.

784
00:20:40,029 --> 00:20:41,259

00:20:42,839 --> 00:20:43,990
having to do for money

787
00:20:44,029 --> 00:20:45,000
that you do not want to do?

788
00:20:45,029 --> 00:20:46,000
All right.

789
00:20:46,029 --> 00:20:46,730
You've got a minute and a half

790
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:47,000
left.

791
00:20:47,029 --> 00:20:48,000
You can turn that music up.

792
00:20:48,029 --> 00:20:49,000
Write it down.

793
00:20:49,029 --> 00:20:50,000
Be detailed.

794
00:20:50,029 --> 00:20:55,950
What are the things you're

795
00:20:55,960 --> 00:21:03,569

796

00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:32,719
How much money do you make per

2306
00:39:32,719 --> 00:39:33,000
month?

2307
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:34,460
How much money do you make per

2308
00:39:34,519 --> 00:39:35,000
month?

2309
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:35,719
How much money do you make per

2310
00:39:35,719 --> 00:39:36,000
month?

2311
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:36,789
How much money do you make per

2312
00:39:36,789 --> 00:39:37,000
month?

2313
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:49,000
And then rehearse wins every

2314
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
morning.

2315
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:52,000
Whatever it is, it doesn't matter.

2316
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:54,000
The point is we're being

2317
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,230
algorithmic in taking our

2318
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:57,000
objectives,

2319
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:58,510
breaking them down into key

2320
00:39:58,519 --> 00:39:59,000
results,

2321
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:00,320
and then breaking those down into

2322
00:40:00,519 --> 00:40:01,000
assignments.

2323
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:02,110
You'll write this down because

2324
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:03,000
it's not on my slides.

2325
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:04,949
Every objective should have two to

2326
00:40:04,949 --> 00:40:06,000
three key results.

2327
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:10,630
And every key result is usually

2328
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:11,980
going to have

2329
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:15,489
three to ten assignments

2330
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:19,000
underneath it.

2331
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:21,750
And here's how this starts fitting

2332
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:24,000
in to the equation.

2333
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:25,389
You can see this water flow

2334
00:40:25,519 --> 00:40:26,000
effect.

2335
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:29,000
As you begin setting objectives,

2336
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:31,199
your team begins going in and

2337
00:40:31,199 --> 00:40:32,989
implementing the key results.

2338
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:35,090
And then the managers tend to the

2339
00:40:35,090 --> 00:40:38,230
assignments according to the key

2340
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:39,000
results.

2341
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:40,000
Does this make sense?

2342
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:41,000
Yeah.

2343
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:42,000
So this is the chart we have.

2344
00:40:42,030 --> 00:40:44,000
Your T1's up here at the top.

2345
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:45,000
These are your what?

2346
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:46,000
Decision makers.

2347
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:47,000
Decision makers.

2348
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:49,000
Your T2's are what?

2349
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:50,000
Managers.

2350
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:51,000
And your T3's?

2351
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:52,000
Laborers.

2352
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:53,000
Are your laborers.

2353
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:54,000
So here's the main job,

2354
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:55,300
and I'm just going to give all of

2355
00:40:55,510 --> 00:40:56,000
these to you.

2356
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:57,670
Your T1's, these are your decision

2357
00:40:57,670 --> 00:40:58,000
makers.

2358
00:40:58,030 --> 00:41:00,000
They set the objectives,

2359
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:02,000
and they manage the implementation

2360
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
against the key results.

2361
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:04,599
Is this a little bit too in the

2362
00:41:04,599 --> 00:41:05,000
weeds?

2363
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:06,000
Do you want to bump back up?

2364
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:07,000
We're good?

2365
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:08,000
We're good?

2366
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:09,000
Cool.

2367
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:12,000
The T2, they set the assignments,

2368
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:13,929
and they ensure that the work is

2369
00:41:13,929 --> 00:41:16,380
being completed on time, under

2370
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:19,000
budget, inside of quality control.

2371
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:20,909
And T3, these are the people that

2372
00:41:20,909 --> 00:41:22,000
are doing the actual work.

2373
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:25,650
One break at any level can slow

2374
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:29,880
your organization down or break it

2375
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,900
all together.

2376
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:33,000
It's terrifying.

2377
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:35,550
People will say, Eddie was talking

2378
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:36,590
about the importance of A players

2379
00:41:36,599 --> 00:41:38,349
earlier, which by the way, he

2380
00:41:38,349 --> 00:41:39,000
crushed it.

2381
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:40,000
He's a brilliant dude right there.

2382
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:42,000
He's a brilliant dude right there.

2383
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:43,000
Worth listening to.

2384
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:45,250
An A player has to fit into every

2385
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:46,000
level.

2386
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:47,409
So you need A players on your

2387
00:41:47,409 --> 00:41:48,000
T3's.

2388
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:50,000
You need A players on your T2's.

2389
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:52,000
A players on your T1's.

2390
00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:53,769
And your job, part of your job as

2391
00:41:53,769 --> 00:41:56,170
a CEO, is to fire the people if

2392
00:41:56,170 --> 00:41:57,989
you cannot train them.

2393
00:41:58,030 --> 00:41:59,420
If you can't change the person,

2394
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:01,000
you've got to change the person.

2395
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:02,000
Make sense?

2396
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:03,000
How are we feeling?

2397
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:04,000
Good.

2398
00:42:04,030 --> 00:42:05,000
Scale of one to ten?

2399
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:06,000
Ten.

2400
00:42:06,030 --> 00:42:07,000
Cool.

2401
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:07,690
Alright, we're going to do another

2402
00:42:07,690 --> 00:42:08,000
exercise.

2403
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:09,000
You ready?

2404
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:10,000
Go back on the clock.

2405
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:11,000
Here's what I want you to do.

2406
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:12,320
Pick one objective for your

2407
00:42:12,510 --> 00:42:13,000
business.

2408
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:14,320
Write down a couple of key

2409
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:15,000
results.

2410
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:16,170
And write down a couple of

2411
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:17,000
assignments.

2412
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:18,000
You have two minutes.

2413
00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:20,000
We're going to turn the music on.

2414
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:21,000
Just one objective.

2415
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:22,000
Don't do like 12.

2416
00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:24,000
We'll be here all night.

2417
00:42:24,030 --> 00:42:25,000
Alright?

2418
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:30,000
Give me that sophisticated tunes.

2419
00:42:36,030 --> 00:42:37,000
One objective.

2420
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:39,000
Couple of key results.

2421
00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:41,000
And a couple of assignments.

2422
00:43:06,030 --> 00:43:13,000
You're doing great.

2423
00:43:13,030 --> 00:43:14,000
You've got another minute.

2424
00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:15,000
Do the work.

2425
00:43:15,030 --> 00:43:16,000
You're doing great.

2426
00:43:16,030 --> 00:43:17,000
You've got another minute.

2427
00:43:17,030 --> 00:43:19,000
Do the work.

2428
00:43:20,519 --> 00:43:41,059
You done?

2429
00:43:41,090 --> 00:43:41,519
Yeah.

2430
00:43:41,550 --> 00:43:43,079
It's fast.

2431
00:43:43,110 --> 00:43:44,599
I was thinking about it.

2432
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:46,199
It was fast.

2433
00:43:46,230 --> 00:43:46,880
I want to hire you.

2434
00:43:49,030 --> 00:43:50,469
30 seconds.

2435
00:43:50,510 --> 00:44:02,420
15 seconds.

2436
00:44:02,449 --> 00:44:15,760
All right, here we go.

2437
00:44:15,789 --> 00:44:17,289
Turn to someone you haven't talked

2438
00:44:17,289 --> 00:44:17,599
to.

2439
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:18,500
So if you turn to the right the

2440
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:19,570
first time, turn to the left this

2441
00:44:19,570 --> 00:44:20,420
time, and you guys are

2442
00:44:20,449 --> 00:44:22,539
going to share your OKRs with one

2443
00:44:22,539 --> 00:44:23,380
another.

2444
00:44:23,409 --> 00:44:24,519
We have a minute and a half

2445
00:44:24,530 --> 00:44:26,079
because I don't want to go late.

2446
00:44:26,110 --> 00:44:27,659
So go ahead and pick your partner.

2447
00:44:27,690 --> 00:44:29,239
Share your plan right now.

2448
00:44:29,269 --> 00:44:29,739
Let's go.

2449
00:44:29,769 --> 00:44:34,579
Hey, real quick.

2450
00:44:34,610 --> 00:44:36,380
What time do I actually need to

2451
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:37,079
cut off?

2452
00:44:37,110 --> 00:44:38,159
We got like 20 minutes.

2453
00:44:38,190 --> 00:44:38,739
20 minutes.

2454
00:44:38,769 --> 00:44:38,980
That's good?

2455
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:39,800
Yeah, that's great.

2456
00:44:39,989 --> 00:44:40,599
Whatever you need.

2457
00:44:40,630 --> 00:44:41,199
Yeah, yeah.

2458
00:44:41,239 --> 00:44:49,489
Hey, bro.

2459
00:44:49,530 --> 00:44:50,340
What's your job?

2460
00:44:50,369 --> 00:44:51,639
I'm going to skip ahead a little

2461
00:44:51,639 --> 00:44:51,960
bit.

2462
00:44:51,989 --> 00:44:52,659
Oh, sure.

2463
00:44:52,699 --> 00:45:08,170
That's better, huh?

2464
00:45:09,670 --> 00:45:14,139
Way better.

2465
00:45:14,139 --> 00:45:14,829
30 more seconds.

2466
00:45:14,829 --> 00:45:15,199
All right.

2467
00:45:15,199 --> 00:45:16,630
Let the other person talk.

2468
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:17,659
Switch.

2469
00:45:17,690 --> 00:45:20,269
Objective key result and

2470
00:45:20,269 --> 00:45:24,659
assignment.

2471
00:45:24,699 --> 00:45:34,380
Good stuff?

2472
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:35,659
It's fucking dope, bro.

2473
00:45:35,690 --> 00:45:35,940
Good.

2474
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:36,659
What do you think?

2475
00:45:36,690 --> 00:45:37,659
I'm taking notes.

2476
00:45:37,690 --> 00:45:38,659
I'm taking notes.

2477
00:45:38,690 --> 00:45:40,659
You've already heard this before.

2478
00:45:40,690 --> 00:45:41,659
Really?

2479
00:45:41,690 --> 00:45:43,659
On how you're doing it, too.

2480
00:45:43,659 --> 00:45:44,659
I'm like, this is fucking good.

2481
00:45:44,690 --> 00:45:45,659
Yeah, bro.

2482
00:45:45,659 --> 00:45:47,110
It just keeps the room, like, way

2483
00:45:47,110 --> 00:45:47,659
happier.

2484
00:45:47,659 --> 00:45:50,650
That way we don't all fall asleep.

2485
00:45:50,690 --> 00:45:51,889
Let's get drinks next time and

2486
00:45:51,889 --> 00:45:52,659
start morning.

2487
00:45:52,690 --> 00:45:53,659
Bro, I actually do that for real.

2488
00:45:53,690 --> 00:45:54,659
Do you?

2489
00:45:54,690 --> 00:45:55,980
I was speaking at an Agora

2490
00:45:56,179 --> 00:45:57,969
conference, and I was like, can we

2491
00:45:57,969 --> 00:45:59,659
get tequila for everyone?

2492
00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:00,820
And Gabe's was like, you're going

2493
00:46:00,820 --> 00:46:01,659
to have to pay for it.

2494
00:46:01,659 --> 00:46:02,659
I was like, do it.

2495
00:46:02,690 --> 00:46:03,659
Fuck it.

2496
00:46:03,690 --> 00:46:04,440
And nobody remembers anything

2497
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:04,659
else.

2498
00:46:04,659 --> 00:46:06,800
The tequila guy was there, and

2499
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,659
like, I was everyone's favorite.

2500
00:46:08,690 --> 00:46:09,659
It's more, what happened?

2501
00:46:09,690 --> 00:46:10,659
All right.

2502
00:46:10,690 --> 00:46:11,659
We ready?

2503
00:46:11,690 --> 00:46:12,659
Yeah.

2504
00:46:12,690 --> 00:46:13,329
How did you say you were giving

2505
00:46:13,329 --> 00:46:13,949
people drinks when you were

2506
00:46:13,949 --> 00:46:15,000
talking and they were like, dialed

2507
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:15,659
in or what?

2508
00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:17,360
Yeah, people always pay attention

2509
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:18,659
if you give them drinks.

2510
00:46:18,690 --> 00:46:19,659
Okay, how we feel?

2511
00:46:19,690 --> 00:46:20,659
Great.

2512
00:46:20,690 --> 00:46:21,639
How many of you are feeling a

2513
00:46:21,639 --> 00:46:22,659
little bit more clarity?

2514
00:46:22,690 --> 00:46:23,659
A little bit better?

2515
00:46:23,690 --> 00:46:25,260
Anybody want to share one of their

2516
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:26,690
objectives, one of their key

2517
00:46:26,690 --> 00:46:28,659
results, one of their assignments?

2518
00:46:28,690 --> 00:46:29,659
What do we got?

2519
00:46:29,690 --> 00:46:30,659
Instagram, man.

2520
00:46:30,690 --> 00:46:31,969
Are you going to work with me or

2521
00:46:31,969 --> 00:46:32,659
not, dude?

2522
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:34,059
This dude's trying to hard sell me

2523
00:46:34,159 --> 00:46:34,659
in the bar.

2524
00:46:34,690 --> 00:46:35,659
You did pretty good, though.

2525
00:46:35,690 --> 00:46:36,659
It's not true.

2526
00:46:36,690 --> 00:46:37,659
All right, tell me.

2527
00:46:37,690 --> 00:46:38,659
What'd you got?

2528
00:46:38,690 --> 00:46:40,289
100 courses within the first 30

2529
00:46:40,289 --> 00:46:41,659
days of launch is the objective.

2530
00:46:41,690 --> 00:46:42,789
The key results, just one of them

2531
00:46:42,789 --> 00:46:43,750
would be start a wait list and

2532
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:44,659
build anticipation.

2533
00:46:44,690 --> 00:46:46,400
And then an assignment for that

2534
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,130
result would be create content

2535
00:46:48,130 --> 00:46:49,659
firstly and then launch trailer.

2536
00:46:49,690 --> 00:46:50,659
Epic.

2537
00:46:50,690 --> 00:46:51,480
You feel like you're getting a

2538
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:52,210
plan dialed in to scale your

2539
00:46:52,210 --> 00:46:52,659
business?

2540
00:46:52,690 --> 00:46:53,659
100%.

2541
00:46:53,690 --> 00:46:55,659
Anybody else want to share?

2542
00:46:55,690 --> 00:46:56,659
Anybody?

2543
00:46:56,690 --> 00:46:57,659
You don't want to.

2544
00:46:57,690 --> 00:46:58,659
I can tell.

2545
00:46:58,690 --> 00:46:59,659
He doesn't want to talk to me.

2546
00:46:59,690 --> 00:47:00,719
I keep trying to look at you and

2547
00:47:00,719 --> 00:47:01,659
you're looking away.

2548
00:47:01,690 --> 00:47:02,659
I can share, but it won't be lit.

2549
00:47:02,690 --> 00:47:04,280
Like, because I'm still a sales

2550
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:04,659
guy.

2551
00:47:04,690 --> 00:47:05,659
Like, so it's going to be hard.

2552
00:47:05,690 --> 00:47:06,659
Yeah, you're the best of us.

2553
00:47:06,690 --> 00:47:07,659
You're sales guy.

2554
00:47:07,690 --> 00:47:08,659
No, we're going to go with him.

2555
00:47:08,690 --> 00:47:09,269
You're not confident, so we're

2556
00:47:09,269 --> 00:47:09,659
skipping you.

2557
00:47:09,690 --> 00:47:10,659
Okay.

2558
00:47:10,690 --> 00:47:12,530
500K a month in new sales, not

2559
00:47:12,530 --> 00:47:13,659
counting back end.

2560
00:47:13,690 --> 00:47:15,199
So in order to do that, we need

2561
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:18,090
400 book calls, 80% show rate, 20%

2562
00:47:18,090 --> 00:47:19,659
close rate at a ticket size of

2563
00:47:19,659 --> 00:47:21,400
like 8K, which is between our two

2564
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:22,659
offers.

2565
00:47:22,690 --> 00:47:24,000
The assignments to get that would

2566
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,659
be at least 2,000 opt-ins.

2567
00:47:25,690 --> 00:47:26,269
So I don't know how much that's

2568
00:47:26,269 --> 00:47:26,659
going to cost.

2569
00:47:26,690 --> 00:47:27,659
Probably not that much.

2570
00:47:27,690 --> 00:47:28,659
Probably not.

2571
00:47:28,690 --> 00:47:29,659
Yeah, he'll let me know.

2572
00:47:29,690 --> 00:47:30,659
He'll let me know.

2573
00:47:30,690 --> 00:47:31,659
Need to have 200 sets.

2574
00:47:31,690 --> 00:47:32,989
So our setters back there got to

2575
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:33,659
get dialed.

2576
00:47:33,690 --> 00:47:35,659
I'm guessing at least $50 a day.

2577
00:47:35,690 --> 00:47:37,139
We have to text each and every

2578
00:47:37,179 --> 00:47:39,309
lead immediately within 10 minutes

2579
00:47:39,309 --> 00:47:40,989
if they don't book a call from the

2580
00:47:40,989 --> 00:47:41,659
BSL directly.

2581
00:47:41,690 --> 00:47:42,659
Hell yeah.

2582
00:47:42,690 --> 00:47:44,349
Round of applause right here for

2583
00:47:44,349 --> 00:47:45,659
that brilliant plan.

2584
00:47:45,690 --> 00:47:46,659
Who's your setter?

2585
00:47:46,690 --> 00:47:47,659
Stand up.

2586
00:47:47,690 --> 00:47:48,659
Who's the setter?

2587
00:47:48,690 --> 00:47:49,659
I'm in.

2588
00:47:49,690 --> 00:47:50,659
I'm in.

2589
00:47:50,690 --> 00:47:51,659
All right.

2590
00:47:51,690 --> 00:47:52,659
Round of applause.

2591
00:47:52,690 --> 00:47:53,659
Round of applause.

2592
00:47:53,690 --> 00:47:54,659
Wait.

2593
00:47:54,690 --> 00:47:55,659
You're a setter too?

2594
00:47:55,690 --> 00:47:56,659
Both of you?

2595
00:47:56,690 --> 00:47:57,659
All right.

2596
00:47:57,690 --> 00:47:59,659
150 calls a day.

2597
00:47:59,690 --> 00:48:00,659
It's easy.

2598
00:48:00,690 --> 00:48:02,659
You'll be fine.

2599
00:48:02,690 --> 00:48:04,510
Go to the bathroom before you

2600
00:48:04,510 --> 00:48:06,650
start and then power through.

2601
00:48:06,690 --> 00:48:07,659
All right.

2602
00:48:07,690 --> 00:48:08,659
One more person.

2603
00:48:08,690 --> 00:48:09,659
Anybody else?

2604
00:48:09,690 --> 00:48:10,659
We don't have to.

2605
00:48:10,690 --> 00:48:11,659
All right.

2606
00:48:11,690 --> 00:48:12,659
We'll skip it.

2607
00:48:12,690 --> 00:48:14,550
Because the world belongs to the

2608
00:48:14,550 --> 00:48:15,659
enthusiastic.

2609
00:48:15,690 --> 00:48:16,659
We got to be enthusiastic.

2610
00:48:16,690 --> 00:48:17,230
You know what happens when you

2611
00:48:17,230 --> 00:48:17,659
share your goals?

2612
00:48:17,690 --> 00:48:18,659
I don't have time.

2613
00:48:18,690 --> 00:48:20,659
I've got to end in 20 minutes.

2614
00:48:20,690 --> 00:48:23,269
Would it be nice to know if the

2615
00:48:23,269 --> 00:48:26,159
team you have right now is going

2616
00:48:26,159 --> 00:48:28,659
to get you to your goals?

2617
00:48:28,690 --> 00:48:30,730
Like if we had a way to sort of

2618
00:48:30,730 --> 00:48:33,480
qualify or disqualify, we're not

2619
00:48:33,579 --> 00:48:35,659
going to do it for you guys.

2620
00:48:35,690 --> 00:48:38,659
You guys are safe.

2621
00:48:38,690 --> 00:48:40,849
How do we actually qualify the

2622
00:48:40,849 --> 00:48:43,389
people before we hire them, after

2623
00:48:43,559 --> 00:48:44,650
we hire them?

2624
00:48:44,690 --> 00:48:46,329
At the end of the training, I'm

2625
00:48:46,329 --> 00:48:48,070
actually going to give you guys a

2626
00:48:48,070 --> 00:48:48,659
playbook.

2627
00:48:48,690 --> 00:48:50,969
And it's the same playbook, Colin,

2628
00:48:50,969 --> 00:48:52,650
that you have access to.

2629
00:48:52,690 --> 00:48:54,190
And it goes through some of the

2630
00:48:54,199 --> 00:48:55,659
personality profiling.

2631
00:48:55,690 --> 00:48:57,210
We have like really deep research

2632
00:48:57,210 --> 00:48:58,659
on personality profiling.

2633
00:48:58,690 --> 00:48:59,659
But I want to give you two models.

2634
00:48:59,690 --> 00:49:00,659
Just two.

2635
00:49:00,690 --> 00:49:01,690
And then we're going to wrap up

2636
00:49:01,690 --> 00:49:02,659
and get into takeaways.

2637
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:05,369
The first is person, personality,

2638
00:49:05,369 --> 00:49:06,650
and position.

2639
00:49:06,690 --> 00:49:08,789
If you put a person with skill,

2640
00:49:08,789 --> 00:49:10,360
but they do not have the

2641
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:12,659
personality for the position,

2642
00:49:12,659 --> 00:49:14,659
they're going to fail.

2643
00:49:14,690 --> 00:49:15,659
Make sense?

2644
00:49:15,690 --> 00:49:16,659
Yeah.

2645
00:49:16,690 --> 00:49:18,920
If you're going to be a setter and

2646
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:21,460
you hate talking to people, what's

2647
00:49:21,579 --> 00:49:22,650
the problem?

2648
00:49:22,690 --> 00:49:25,090
Like, do you think that a setter

2649
00:49:25,090 --> 00:49:27,340
who hates people is going to be

2650
00:49:27,579 --> 00:49:29,769
able to actually dial and talk to

2651
00:49:29,769 --> 00:49:30,659
people?

2652
00:49:30,690 --> 00:49:31,659
No.

2653
00:49:31,690 --> 00:49:32,820
It's going to be very difficult

2654
00:49:32,820 --> 00:49:33,659
for them to do that.

2655
00:49:33,690 --> 00:49:34,909
And so we'll go deep into this

2656
00:49:35,170 --> 00:49:36,659
person, personality, position.

2657
00:49:36,690 --> 00:49:37,619
I'm going to skip it for now so

2658
00:49:37,619 --> 00:49:38,659
that we don't miss the bar.

2659
00:49:38,690 --> 00:49:40,360
But the next thing we're going to

2660
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:41,929
go into is rating current team

2661
00:49:41,929 --> 00:49:42,650
members.

2662
00:49:42,690 --> 00:49:44,750
So, we rate team members based on

2663
00:49:44,750 --> 00:49:46,650
a three-pronged approach.

2664
00:49:46,690 --> 00:49:48,659
It is also a triangle.

2665
00:49:48,690 --> 00:49:51,659
Different colors.

2666
00:49:51,690 --> 00:49:54,659
It's different colors.

2667
00:49:54,690 --> 00:49:55,659
And here they are.

2668
00:49:55,690 --> 00:49:56,659
Attitude is number one.

2669
00:49:56,690 --> 00:49:57,659
Let me say attitude.

2670
00:49:57,690 --> 00:49:58,659
Attitude.

2671
00:49:58,690 --> 00:50:00,630
Now, attitude we're going to

2672
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:03,150
define as culture, communication,

2673
00:50:03,150 --> 00:50:04,650
and teachability.

2674
00:50:04,690 --> 00:50:06,449
If you have people on your team

2675
00:50:06,449 --> 00:50:07,940
that are not teachable or

2676
00:50:07,949 --> 00:50:09,820
coachable or they do not accept a

2677
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:12,659
level of feedback from you, their

2678
00:50:12,659 --> 00:50:13,659
attitude is going to rate low.

2679
00:50:13,690 --> 00:50:14,969
Scale them one to ten, we rate

2680
00:50:15,170 --> 00:50:16,659
people on one to ten very quickly.

2681
00:50:16,690 --> 00:50:17,659
Make sense?

2682
00:50:17,690 --> 00:50:18,659
Yeah.

2683
00:50:18,690 --> 00:50:19,409
Where did you get that hat, by the

2684
00:50:19,409 --> 00:50:19,659
way?

2685
00:50:19,690 --> 00:50:21,659
Carte Blanche.

2686
00:50:21,690 --> 00:50:23,659
It's sick.

2687
00:50:23,690 --> 00:50:24,659
It's cool.

2688
00:50:24,690 --> 00:50:25,760
I just saw it and I was like, I

2689
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:26,659
need one of those.

2690
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:28,659
I need yours too.

2691
00:50:28,690 --> 00:50:29,659
But I got one.

2692
00:50:29,690 --> 00:50:30,659
Give me hats.

2693
00:50:30,690 --> 00:50:32,489
Attitude is your culture, your

2694
00:50:32,489 --> 00:50:33,659
communication.

2695
00:50:33,690 --> 00:50:35,659
And your teachability.

2696
00:50:35,690 --> 00:50:37,659
The second is competency.

2697
00:50:37,690 --> 00:50:38,659
Whoa.

2698
00:50:38,690 --> 00:50:39,659
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

2699
00:50:39,690 --> 00:50:40,659
Whoa, dude.

2700
00:50:40,690 --> 00:50:43,500
Competency.

2701
00:50:43,690 --> 00:50:44,659
We're back.

2702
00:50:44,690 --> 00:50:46,900
Skill, resourcefulness, and follow

2703
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:47,659
through.

2704
00:50:47,690 --> 00:50:49,500
Have you ever assigned something

2705
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:51,139
out to your team and they do not

2706
00:50:51,139 --> 00:50:51,650
do it?

2707
00:50:51,690 --> 00:50:53,659
Oh, dude.

2708
00:50:53,690 --> 00:50:55,659
Oh, my God.

2709
00:50:55,690 --> 00:50:57,059
Like nothing in the world is worse

2710
00:50:57,170 --> 00:50:57,659
than that.

2711
00:50:57,690 --> 00:50:59,019
And so the follow through is

2712
00:50:59,179 --> 00:51:00,659
actually a competency piece.

2713
00:51:00,690 --> 00:51:02,070
If they are competent, then they

2714
00:51:02,170 --> 00:51:03,659
have the follow through ability.

2715
00:51:03,690 --> 00:51:04,789
And then experience is the

2716
00:51:05,070 --> 00:51:06,170
decision making, the street

2717
00:51:06,170 --> 00:51:07,650
smarts, the poison confidence.

2718
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:09,659
Real quick warning on experience.

2719
00:51:09,690 --> 00:51:11,110
When I say experience, I mean

2720
00:51:11,199 --> 00:51:12,780
experience at the level that you

2721
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:13,650
want to get to.

2722
00:51:13,690 --> 00:51:15,219
Not experience at your current

2723
00:51:15,219 --> 00:51:17,409
level, but experience at the level

2724
00:51:17,409 --> 00:51:18,659
that you want to get through.

2725
00:51:18,690 --> 00:51:20,949
And typically, this is just for

2726
00:51:20,949 --> 00:51:21,659
later.

2727
00:51:21,690 --> 00:51:23,659
We can talk about it on the boat.

2728
00:51:23,690 --> 00:51:26,659
We stick in realms of threes.

2729
00:51:26,690 --> 00:51:29,639
If you're at $100,000 a month and

2730
00:51:29,639 --> 00:51:31,659
you hire the CMO of Coca-Cola,

2731
00:51:31,659 --> 00:51:34,659
they ain't going to do a good job.

2732
00:51:34,690 --> 00:51:36,659
They're too big.

2733
00:51:36,690 --> 00:51:38,460
And so you want to stick into this

2734
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:40,280
realm of like three to five X your

2735
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:41,659
current business.

2736
00:51:41,690 --> 00:51:42,659
Okay?

2737
00:51:42,690 --> 00:51:43,659
Is that helpful?

2738
00:51:43,690 --> 00:51:44,659
Yeah.

2739
00:51:44,690 --> 00:51:46,659
What is culture though?

2740
00:51:46,690 --> 00:51:48,420
I want to define this quickly for

2741
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:49,420
you.

2742
00:51:49,690 --> 00:51:51,429
Because when you look at attitude,

2743
00:51:51,429 --> 00:51:52,659
what do we see up here?

2744
00:51:52,690 --> 00:51:54,269
Communication, teachability, and

2745
00:51:54,269 --> 00:51:54,659
what?

2746
00:51:54,690 --> 00:51:57,090
Communication, teachability, and

2747
00:51:57,090 --> 00:51:57,659
what?

2748
00:51:57,690 --> 00:51:58,659
Culture.

2749
00:51:58,690 --> 00:52:00,659
Communication, teachability,

2750
00:52:00,659 --> 00:52:01,659
culture.

2751
00:52:01,690 --> 00:52:02,659
Culture.

2752
00:52:02,690 --> 00:52:03,900
Culture will make or break your

2753
00:52:04,170 --> 00:52:04,659
organization.

2754
00:52:04,690 --> 00:52:05,659
What is culture?

2755
00:52:05,690 --> 00:52:06,659
How do we define it?

2756
00:52:06,690 --> 00:52:07,659
What do we think?

2757
00:52:07,690 --> 00:52:08,659
Just raise your hands.

2758
00:52:08,690 --> 00:52:09,659
Blurt it out.

2759
00:52:09,690 --> 00:52:10,659
Yes, sir.

2760
00:52:10,690 --> 00:52:11,869
Dude, you have always come through

2761
00:52:11,869 --> 00:52:12,659
for me, by the way.

2762
00:52:12,690 --> 00:52:15,659
The polo, the answers.

2763
00:52:15,690 --> 00:52:17,659
It's all perfect.

2764
00:52:17,690 --> 00:52:18,659
Anybody else?

2765
00:52:18,690 --> 00:52:20,659
What people do.

2766
00:52:20,690 --> 00:52:21,659
What they do?

2767
00:52:21,690 --> 00:52:22,659
When no one's around.

2768
00:52:22,690 --> 00:52:23,659
When no one's around.

2769
00:52:23,690 --> 00:52:24,659
Great answer.

2770
00:52:24,690 --> 00:52:25,659
What else we got?

2771
00:52:25,690 --> 00:52:26,659
Can you guys see me in the back?

2772
00:52:26,690 --> 00:52:27,659
What else we got?

2773
00:52:27,690 --> 00:52:28,659
Yeah.

2774
00:52:28,690 --> 00:52:31,440
The kinds of videos you send each

2775
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:32,650
other out.

2776
00:52:32,690 --> 00:52:36,739
Round of applause for whoever you

2777
00:52:36,739 --> 00:52:37,659
are.

2778
00:52:37,690 --> 00:52:39,199
That's actually maybe kind of

2779
00:52:39,199 --> 00:52:39,659
true.

2780
00:52:39,690 --> 00:52:41,340
Here's what I want you guys to

2781
00:52:41,340 --> 00:52:43,119
mentally think about in terms of

2782
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:43,650
culture.

2783
00:52:43,690 --> 00:52:45,989
Culture is what they believe, why

2784
00:52:45,989 --> 00:52:49,639
they believe it, and what do you

2785
00:52:49,639 --> 00:52:50,659
see?

2786
00:52:50,690 --> 00:52:53,659
How strongly they believe it.

2787
00:52:53,690 --> 00:52:54,659
What do they believe?

2788
00:52:54,690 --> 00:52:55,659
What do they believe?

2789
00:52:55,690 --> 00:52:56,659
Why do they believe it?

2790
00:52:56,690 --> 00:52:59,659
How strongly they believe it.

2791
00:52:59,690 --> 00:53:01,550
You can honestly, if you're taking

2792
00:53:01,550 --> 00:53:02,929
notes, you can put next to

2793
00:53:02,929 --> 00:53:04,659
strongly, you can put parentheses,

2794
00:53:04,690 --> 00:53:06,659
and put violently.

2795
00:53:06,690 --> 00:53:08,590
Because when you believe something

2796
00:53:08,590 --> 00:53:11,039
really strongly, you're protective

2797
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:11,659
of it.

2798
00:53:11,690 --> 00:53:12,659
You're defensive of it.

2799
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:13,659
True or false?

2800
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:14,659
True.

2801
00:53:14,690 --> 00:53:15,659
A good culture.

2802
00:53:15,690 --> 00:53:16,550
You want to know how a good

2803
00:53:16,550 --> 00:53:17,659
culture is a good culture?

2804
00:53:17,690 --> 00:53:19,179
They will literally eat you alive

2805
00:53:19,179 --> 00:53:20,480
if you don't believe the same

2806
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:22,659
things that the culture believes.

2807
00:53:22,690 --> 00:53:25,500
A good culture is not a safe place

2808
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:28,650
unless you belong to the tribe.

2809
00:53:28,690 --> 00:53:29,659
Does this make sense?

2810
00:53:29,690 --> 00:53:30,659
Yeah.

2811
00:53:30,690 --> 00:53:31,659
Yeah.

2812
00:53:31,690 --> 00:53:34,170
So we've kind of deviated in the

2813
00:53:34,170 --> 00:53:36,900
last 30 years with corporate

2814
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:38,849
America to kind of trying to build

2815
00:53:38,849 --> 00:53:40,039
culture that's pleasing and safe

2816
00:53:40,039 --> 00:53:40,659
for everyone.

2817
00:53:40,690 --> 00:53:43,269
But real good culture, you've got

2818
00:53:43,269 --> 00:53:45,659
to fit in or you do not fit in.

2819
00:53:45,690 --> 00:53:47,190
And so this is my charge on this

2820
00:53:47,190 --> 00:53:48,670
is make sure that when you're

2821
00:53:48,670 --> 00:53:50,659
rating culture, you're rating

2822
00:53:50,659 --> 00:53:52,300
their attitude and it'll fit on

2823
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:53,760
whether they actually buy in to

2824
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:54,659
what you are doing.

2825
00:53:54,690 --> 00:53:55,679
Who has a written set of values

2826
00:53:55,679 --> 00:53:56,659
for your organization?

2827
00:53:56,690 --> 00:53:58,659
Show of hands.

2828
00:53:58,690 --> 00:53:59,659
Cool.

2829
00:53:59,690 --> 00:54:01,110
This is a great idea for you to

2830
00:54:01,179 --> 00:54:01,659
know.

2831
00:54:01,690 --> 00:54:03,619
When we read our culture, if that

2832
00:54:03,619 --> 00:54:05,650
person looks sick, fire them.

2833
00:54:05,690 --> 00:54:06,659
Easy.

2834
00:54:06,690 --> 00:54:08,739
If we're reading our set of values

2835
00:54:08,739 --> 00:54:10,739
and somebody does not align with

2836
00:54:10,739 --> 00:54:12,769
the values, they're not going to

2837
00:54:12,769 --> 00:54:13,659
be a culture fit.

2838
00:54:13,690 --> 00:54:15,280
It doesn't matter how skilled they

2839
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:15,659
are.

2840
00:54:15,690 --> 00:54:16,659
They don't belong.

2841
00:54:16,690 --> 00:54:17,659
Does this make sense?

2842
00:54:17,690 --> 00:54:18,659
Yeah.

2843
00:54:18,690 --> 00:54:20,480
Raise your hand if you would like

2844
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:22,650
my organizational values to read.

2845
00:54:22,690 --> 00:54:23,659
Yes, please.

2846
00:54:23,690 --> 00:54:25,739
If your hand's not up, what are

2847
00:54:25,739 --> 00:54:26,659
you doing?

2848
00:54:26,690 --> 00:54:27,659
I'm going to give them to you.

2849
00:54:27,690 --> 00:54:28,659
It's fine.

2850
00:54:28,690 --> 00:54:30,659
We'll get there later.

2851
00:54:30,690 --> 00:54:34,559
Once you have your players, the

2852
00:54:35,579 --> 00:54:41,780
question is what do you do as a

2853
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:43,659
CEO?

2854
00:54:43,690 --> 00:54:44,659
Huh?

2855
00:54:44,690 --> 00:54:45,659
Embody?

2856
00:54:45,690 --> 00:54:46,659
Embody them.

2857
00:54:46,690 --> 00:54:47,659
Embody?

2858
00:54:47,690 --> 00:54:48,659
Embody them.

2859
00:54:48,690 --> 00:54:49,659
Embody them.

2860
00:54:49,690 --> 00:54:50,659
Embody them.

2861
00:54:50,690 --> 00:54:51,659
They go into...

2862
00:54:51,690 --> 00:54:54,889
I didn't know it was that kind of

2863
00:54:54,889 --> 00:54:56,659
event, dude.

2864
00:54:56,690 --> 00:54:57,659
Pretty sus.

2865
00:54:57,690 --> 00:54:58,659
Pretty sus.

2866
00:54:58,690 --> 00:54:59,659
Was that my dude who...

2867
00:54:59,690 --> 00:55:00,659
Is that you?

2868
00:55:00,690 --> 00:55:01,659
Bro, you always...

2869
00:55:01,690 --> 00:55:02,309
This is the first time you've

2870
00:55:02,309 --> 00:55:02,659
failed me.

2871
00:55:02,690 --> 00:55:04,550
Our job is to engineer an

2872
00:55:04,550 --> 00:55:07,030
environment where people have

2873
00:55:07,579 --> 00:55:08,550
almost enough time to perform

2874
00:55:08,550 --> 00:55:09,659
their best but not quite.

2875
00:55:09,690 --> 00:55:10,659
I'm about to blow your minds.

2876
00:55:10,679 --> 00:55:11,320
I can see you wrestling with it

2877
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:11,659
right now.

2878
00:55:11,690 --> 00:55:12,659
And I'm going to explain it.

2879
00:55:12,690 --> 00:55:13,329
This man looked at me like I was

2880
00:55:13,329 --> 00:55:13,659
stupid.

2881
00:55:13,690 --> 00:55:17,000
Our job is to engineer an

2882
00:55:18,579 --> 00:55:19,730
environment where people have

2883
00:55:19,730 --> 00:55:21,260
almost enough time to perform

2884
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:22,659
their best but not quite.

2885
00:55:22,659 --> 00:55:24,659
I'm about to blow your mind.

2886
00:55:24,659 --> 00:55:28,260
I can see you wrestling with it

2887
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:32,289
right now and I'm going to explain

2888
00:55:32,289 --> 00:55:33,099
it.

2889
00:55:33,099 --> 00:55:34,960
This man looked at me like I was

2890
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:35,639
stupid.

2891
00:55:35,650 --> 00:55:38,659
He's like, do you even math?

2892
00:55:43,690 --> 00:55:45,070
All right.

2893
00:55:45,170 --> 00:55:48,170
So we want to actually create

2894
00:55:48,579 --> 00:55:49,070
flow.

2895
00:55:49,070 --> 00:55:49,889
Yes.

2896
00:55:50,079 --> 00:55:53,340
Flow comes when you are right at

2897
00:55:53,340 --> 00:55:55,949
the line of your abilities, maybe

2898
00:55:55,949 --> 00:55:57,559
even a little bit beyond the line.

2899
00:55:57,559 --> 00:55:59,659
I was telling somebody at one of

2900
00:55:59,659 --> 00:56:01,760
our off sites that I will always

2901
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:03,130
be understaffed.

2902
00:56:03,130 --> 00:56:03,860
Always.

2903
00:56:04,070 --> 00:56:04,800
Forever.

2904
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:06,000
You want your business to

2905
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,659
perpetually be understaffed.

2906
00:56:07,659 --> 00:56:08,860
You know, this is why you're

2907
00:56:08,860 --> 00:56:10,010
fighting with your managers

2908
00:56:10,119 --> 00:56:11,119
because it's crazy.

2909
00:56:11,670 --> 00:56:13,150
But when you actually don't have

2910
00:56:13,159 --> 00:56:14,619
enough resources to get the job

2911
00:56:14,619 --> 00:56:15,960
done and you don't have, you

2912
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:17,420
almost have enough time but you

2913
00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:19,389
don't, then you have the flow

2914
00:56:19,389 --> 00:56:21,699
state that forces creativity.

2915
00:56:21,769 --> 00:56:23,360
She's smiling like you do this to

2916
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:24,349
her all the time.

2917
00:56:24,389 --> 00:56:27,460
You guys are doing it right.

2918
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:29,420
I'm sorry.

2919
00:56:30,449 --> 00:56:32,030
But this is how you create flow

2920
00:56:32,030 --> 00:56:32,599
state.

2921
00:56:32,599 --> 00:56:33,639
Somebody say capacity.

2922
00:56:33,670 --> 00:56:35,079
Okay.

2923
00:56:35,159 --> 00:56:36,639
When you're wanting to increase

2924
00:56:36,639 --> 00:56:38,320
your capacity, how is it done?

2925
00:56:38,349 --> 00:56:41,170
Pushing the limits.

2926
00:56:41,250 --> 00:56:42,519
If you want to get biceps like me,

2927
00:56:42,519 --> 00:56:43,320
how do you do it?

2928
00:56:43,349 --> 00:56:45,250
Listen, Hormozzi is always flexing

2929
00:56:45,250 --> 00:56:46,880
and stuff, but my calves are at

2930
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:48,340
least double his size.

2931
00:56:48,369 --> 00:56:50,449
When I go to the gym and I do my

2932
00:56:50,449 --> 00:56:52,579
calves, people leave.

2933
00:56:53,730 --> 00:56:56,099
And it's because, it's because I'm

2934
00:56:56,099 --> 00:56:57,119
a dad, bro.

2935
00:56:57,150 --> 00:56:59,179
Have you seen my son?

2936
00:56:59,210 --> 00:57:01,530
I have an eight-month-old who's 30

2937
00:57:01,530 --> 00:57:02,239
pounds.

2938
00:57:02,269 --> 00:57:03,599
I have a four-and-a-half-year-old

2939
00:57:03,659 --> 00:57:04,699
who's 38 pounds.

2940
00:57:04,730 --> 00:57:07,400
That eight-month-old is going to

2941
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:09,320
be a freaking titan.

2942
00:57:09,349 --> 00:57:10,780
And he's strong.

2943
00:57:10,809 --> 00:57:12,010
I almost pulled my pants down in

2944
00:57:12,010 --> 00:57:13,539
front of everybody the other day.

2945
00:57:13,570 --> 00:57:14,800
He was grabbing onto it.

2946
00:57:14,829 --> 00:57:16,760
Flow state is what you get when

2947
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:18,239
you run out of time.

2948
00:57:19,650 --> 00:57:20,320
Think about it.

2949
00:57:20,349 --> 00:57:21,960
Flow state is what you get when

2950
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:23,760
you are stretched beyond the

2951
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:26,360
normal limits of your traditional

2952
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:27,860
performance.

2953
00:57:27,889 --> 00:57:29,949
The greatest gift you can give to

2954
00:57:29,949 --> 00:57:32,280
an A player, to a high-performance

2955
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:34,780
team, is higher standards that

2956
00:57:34,780 --> 00:57:36,239
move everyone's life forward.

2957
00:57:36,269 --> 00:57:39,289
Does this make sense?

2958
00:57:39,329 --> 00:57:41,400
If you want to run an eight-figure

2959
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:43,250
team, a nine-figure team, a

2960
00:57:43,250 --> 00:57:45,440
high-performance team, do you guys

2961
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:46,469
remember when Elon took over

2962
00:57:46,469 --> 00:57:46,960
Twitter?

2963
00:57:47,610 --> 00:57:49,030
He comes in, fires everyone, and

2964
00:57:49,099 --> 00:57:50,480
says, hey, we're going to double

2965
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:51,829
the innovation, and you're all

2966
00:57:51,829 --> 00:57:53,230
fired, except for like a hundred

2967
00:57:53,230 --> 00:57:53,730
of you.

2968
00:57:53,769 --> 00:57:55,190
And people are like, what in the

2969
00:57:55,260 --> 00:57:55,739
world?

2970
00:57:55,769 --> 00:57:57,190
And what happened to Twitter?

2971
00:57:57,230 --> 00:57:59,179
It got better.

2972
00:57:59,210 --> 00:58:04,719
Waste and excess surplus makes you

2973
00:58:04,719 --> 00:58:06,099
weak.

2974
00:58:06,130 --> 00:58:08,360
It makes you lazy.

2975
00:58:11,230 --> 00:58:12,679
This is the gift that we give

2976
00:58:12,719 --> 00:58:14,440
other people, is we expect more

2977
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:15,190
from them.

2978
00:58:15,230 --> 00:58:18,199
Can we do that?

2979
00:58:18,309 --> 00:58:19,849
I want you really to grab this,

2980
00:58:19,849 --> 00:58:21,429
because this is probably one of

2981
00:58:21,429 --> 00:58:22,860
the biggest takeaways.

2982
00:58:22,889 --> 00:58:25,010
People come into my teams, like I

2983
00:58:25,010 --> 00:58:26,480
remember them all.

2984
00:58:26,510 --> 00:58:29,260
I've trained 58,000 salespeople.

2985
00:58:30,570 --> 00:58:32,289
And I remember all, like the

2986
00:58:32,289 --> 00:58:34,320
A-listers of today, and they're

2987
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:35,500
all brilliant.

2988
00:58:35,530 --> 00:58:36,969
And I remember when they were not

2989
00:58:37,019 --> 00:58:37,699
brilliant.

2990
00:58:37,730 --> 00:58:39,579
And they came into my offices in

2991
00:58:39,579 --> 00:58:41,679
Nashville, and we had all of these

2992
00:58:41,679 --> 00:58:43,889
crazy people, you remember this,

2993
00:58:43,929 --> 00:58:48,619
in an office, for 14 hours a day.

2994
00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:51,070
150 calls a day, by the way, is

2995
00:58:51,070 --> 00:58:52,699
your starting point.

2996
00:58:57,610 --> 00:58:58,780
They're never going to invite me

2997
00:58:58,780 --> 00:58:59,719
back to speak at this.

2998
00:58:59,750 --> 00:59:01,139
I feel like I'm ruining my

2999
00:59:01,239 --> 00:59:01,880
chances.

3000
00:59:01,909 --> 00:59:05,670
And the gift that I gave, Cole,

3001
00:59:05,670 --> 00:59:07,920
Payton, all of the crew, is higher

3002
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,019
standards.

3003
00:59:09,050 --> 00:59:10,590
When a person's standards are

3004
00:59:10,590 --> 00:59:12,400
lifted through culture, they do

3005
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:14,159
things that they never thought

3006
00:59:14,159 --> 00:59:15,539
they were capable of doing.

3007
00:59:15,570 --> 00:59:17,159
This is where we've got to get to

3008
00:59:17,159 --> 00:59:18,110
with our team.

3009
00:59:18,150 --> 00:59:18,539
Make sense?

3010
00:59:18,570 --> 00:59:19,840
Okay.

3011
00:59:19,869 --> 00:59:20,900
Does this make sense?

3012
00:59:20,929 --> 00:59:21,300
Right here.

3013
00:59:21,329 --> 00:59:22,440
If you do want to take a picture,

3014
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:23,579
you can, but I'm going to send it

3015
00:59:23,579 --> 00:59:24,079
to you.

3016
00:59:24,110 --> 00:59:25,329
This is like a traditional,

3017
00:59:25,590 --> 00:59:26,639
classic org chart for one of my

3018
00:59:26,639 --> 00:59:27,340
companies.

3019
00:59:27,610 --> 00:59:28,760
We do run a portfolio.

3020
00:59:28,789 --> 00:59:30,199
I don't talk about it often

3021
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:31,920
because portfolio has become a

3022
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:33,289
thing that I don't want to

3023
00:59:33,289 --> 00:59:34,139
infringe on.

3024
00:59:34,170 --> 00:59:35,719
But you take the C-level, you put

3025
00:59:35,719 --> 00:59:36,679
them at the top.

3026
00:59:36,710 --> 00:59:37,960
If you have finance people, you

3027
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:39,250
just have to put up with them.

3028
00:59:39,289 --> 00:59:40,539
They're over here in the corner.

3029
00:59:40,570 --> 00:59:41,909
I didn't want to give them more

3030
00:59:42,050 --> 00:59:42,400
spots.

3031
00:59:42,429 --> 00:59:44,949
Finance people, their main job is

3032
00:59:44,949 --> 00:59:47,340
to tell you what you can't do.

3033
00:59:47,369 --> 00:59:49,179
Boo.

3034
00:59:49,210 --> 00:59:51,280
You have to listen to them.

3035
00:59:51,309 --> 00:59:53,119
And we have the C-level.

3036
00:59:53,150 --> 00:59:54,300
These are your T-what?

3037
00:59:54,329 --> 00:59:55,760
Ones.

3038
00:59:56,010 --> 00:59:56,920
And then we have the managers.

3039
00:59:56,949 --> 00:59:57,880
These are your T.

3040
00:59:57,909 --> 00:59:59,280
Look over here.

3041
00:59:59,309 --> 01:00:00,659
You've got SDRs.

3042
01:00:00,690 --> 01:00:01,800
This will be your setter manager.

3043
01:00:01,829 --> 01:00:02,920
Your AEs.

3044
01:00:02,949 --> 01:00:03,940
This will be your closer manager.

3045
01:00:03,969 --> 01:00:05,300
You've got your reps underneath

3046
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:05,599
it.

3047
01:00:05,630 --> 01:00:08,070
This is something that you will

3048
01:00:08,070 --> 01:00:10,130
print money if you can get this

3049
01:00:10,130 --> 01:00:11,860
type of org chart in place.

3050
01:00:11,889 --> 01:00:13,940
Again, number two, bros.

3051
01:00:13,969 --> 01:00:16,019
Two of the biggest yawns I've ever

3052
01:00:16,019 --> 01:00:16,590
seen.

3053
01:00:16,630 --> 01:00:17,960
Can you come up here?

3054
01:00:17,989 --> 01:00:20,199
Yeah, come sit with me, dude.

3055
01:00:20,230 --> 01:00:21,619
Come on, man.

3056
01:00:21,690 --> 01:00:22,260
Just give them a round of

3057
01:00:22,260 --> 01:00:22,639
applause.

3058
01:00:22,670 --> 01:00:23,519
Let's go, dude.

3059
01:00:23,550 --> 01:00:24,119
Let's go.

3060
01:00:24,150 --> 01:00:29,500
Hey, what's your name?

3061
01:00:29,530 --> 01:00:30,820
Charlie?

3062
01:00:30,849 --> 01:00:32,579
It's great to meet you, dude.

3063
01:00:32,610 --> 01:00:33,610
Do you take, like, sleep

3064
01:00:33,619 --> 01:00:34,360
supplements?

3065
01:00:34,389 --> 01:00:35,119
No.

3066
01:00:35,150 --> 01:00:36,980
No, I've just been eating a lot of

3067
01:00:36,980 --> 01:00:38,579
that gum, so I think it's been...

3068
01:00:38,610 --> 01:00:39,559
You've been eating gum?

3069
01:00:39,590 --> 01:00:40,039
The...

3070
01:00:40,070 --> 01:00:40,960
Like, swallowing it?

3071
01:00:40,989 --> 01:00:41,739
The focus gum.

3072
01:00:41,769 --> 01:00:43,400
The focus gum.

3073
01:00:43,429 --> 01:00:44,000
The focus gum.

3074
01:00:44,030 --> 01:00:45,329
What's one takeaway you would give

3075
01:00:45,329 --> 01:00:46,119
to the audience?

3076
01:00:46,150 --> 01:00:46,940
From this?

3077
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:51,880
Sure.

3078
01:00:51,909 --> 01:00:53,500
Might as well.

3079
01:00:53,530 --> 01:00:55,440
Culture is everything.

3080
01:00:55,469 --> 01:00:56,699
That was an easy one.

3081
01:00:56,730 --> 01:00:57,519
Give me a better one.

3082
01:00:57,550 --> 01:00:59,480
Hire the right people.

3083
01:00:59,510 --> 01:01:00,690
That was also an easy one, but I

3084
01:01:00,690 --> 01:01:01,599
think it's great.

3085
01:01:01,630 --> 01:01:02,360
You can go sit down.

3086
01:01:02,389 --> 01:01:02,920
Thank you, bro.

3087
01:01:02,949 --> 01:01:03,659
You're the man.

3088
01:01:03,690 --> 01:01:04,619
Give him a round of applause.

3089
01:01:04,650 --> 01:01:08,900
Are we having fun?

3090
01:01:08,929 --> 01:01:10,639
This is freaking fun.

3091
01:01:10,670 --> 01:01:11,260
I'm telling you.

3092
01:01:11,289 --> 01:01:12,380
Listen, we just make money.

3093
01:01:12,409 --> 01:01:14,059
Charlie falls asleep, and it's

3094
01:01:14,059 --> 01:01:14,739
awesome.

3095
01:01:14,769 --> 01:01:16,420
Okay.

3096
01:01:16,449 --> 01:01:18,929
I'm going to skip a quick exercise

3097
01:01:18,929 --> 01:01:21,900
because I want to wrap up, but the

3098
01:01:21,900 --> 01:01:23,059
thing that we have

3099
01:01:23,090 --> 01:01:24,860
to get to after we have this in

3100
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:26,539
place is, what do I do?

3101
01:01:26,570 --> 01:01:28,880
Because what I thought the goal

3102
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:30,440
was was to escape.

3103
01:01:30,469 --> 01:01:32,380
This is what everyone's chasing.

3104
01:01:32,869 --> 01:01:34,550
I got a call a couple weeks ago

3105
01:01:34,550 --> 01:01:36,480
from someone who's a really dear

3106
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:37,820
friend of mine, and he's

3107
01:01:37,849 --> 01:01:39,670
crushing it, and he said, you

3108
01:01:39,670 --> 01:01:41,590
know, we're crushing it, and I

3109
01:01:41,590 --> 01:01:43,800
only spent like 20 minutes at my

3110
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:43,989
last

3111
01:01:44,030 --> 01:01:45,860
event, and I was like, ooh, dude,

3112
01:01:45,860 --> 01:01:46,869
that's not good.

3113
01:01:46,909 --> 01:01:49,480
The escapism is not, you don't

3114
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:51,719
want what other people are

3115
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:52,829
chasing.

3116
01:01:52,869 --> 01:01:54,380
Your job as an entrepreneur is to

3117
01:01:54,380 --> 01:01:55,710
engage, not to escape.

3118
01:01:55,750 --> 01:01:58,900
It's not to escape everything.

3119
01:01:59,449 --> 01:02:01,369
It's to engage in the things that

3120
01:02:01,369 --> 01:02:03,320
you love to do more than anything

3121
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:03,900
else.

3122
01:02:03,929 --> 01:02:04,960
So we're actually going to do,

3123
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:05,940
we're going to do a one minute

3124
01:02:05,940 --> 01:02:06,469
exercise.

3125
01:02:06,510 --> 01:02:08,179
We have 60 seconds to do this, so

3126
01:02:08,179 --> 01:02:09,360
you better do it quick.

3127
01:02:09,389 --> 01:02:11,250
And I want to, I want you to write

3128
01:02:11,250 --> 01:02:13,070
down in one minute, you can put

3129
01:02:13,070 --> 01:02:15,019
some music on, the things

3130
01:02:15,050 --> 01:02:16,710
that you feel like you could do

3131
01:02:16,710 --> 01:02:18,599
forever, for hours and hours and

3132
01:02:18,599 --> 01:02:20,139
hours, and you don't run

3133
01:02:20,170 --> 01:02:21,889
out of time, and you don't run out

3134
01:02:21,889 --> 01:02:23,510
of energy, maybe it's writing

3135
01:02:23,510 --> 01:02:25,179
copy, maybe it's doing sales

3136
01:02:25,210 --> 01:02:26,340
calls, you can turn that music up

3137
01:02:26,340 --> 01:02:26,630
now.

3138
01:02:26,670 --> 01:02:27,599
We're good to go.

3139
01:02:27,630 --> 01:02:28,900
Write down a list of things that

3140
01:02:28,900 --> 01:02:30,210
you love to do more than anything

3141
01:02:30,210 --> 01:02:30,659
else.

3142
01:02:39,289 --> 01:02:40,639
Just join a webinar, Charlie.

3143
01:02:40,679 --> 01:02:44,380
Gosh.

3144
01:02:44,610 --> 01:02:49,699
Oh, I love you, Charlie.

3145
01:02:49,730 --> 01:02:54,539
These are the things you just love

3146
01:02:54,619 --> 01:02:55,739
to do.

3147
01:02:55,880 --> 01:03:21,800
You got some good ones?

3148
01:03:21,849 --> 01:03:22,260
Yeah.

3149
01:03:22,289 --> 01:03:23,059
I got some great ones.

3150
01:03:23,090 --> 01:03:23,559
Yeah?

3151
01:03:23,590 --> 01:03:23,679
Yeah.

3152
01:03:25,869 --> 01:03:28,679
All right, cool.

3153
01:03:28,769 --> 01:03:29,400
Cool, cool, cool.

3154
01:03:29,429 --> 01:03:29,980
Cool, cool, cool.

3155
01:03:30,010 --> 01:03:30,579
What is it?

3156
01:03:30,610 --> 01:03:30,880
What do you got?

3157
01:03:30,909 --> 01:03:32,860
I got filming videos, creating

3158
01:03:32,860 --> 01:03:34,780
offers, and writing BSLs.

3159
01:03:34,809 --> 01:03:35,380
Epic.

3160
01:03:35,409 --> 01:03:36,300
That sounds like a pretty good

3161
01:03:36,300 --> 01:03:36,820
list, yeah?

3162
01:03:36,849 --> 01:03:38,739
What do you have right here?

3163
01:03:38,769 --> 01:03:40,500
I got looking at numbers and

3164
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:43,050
setting objectives, team meetings,

3165
01:03:43,050 --> 01:03:44,059
and hiring.

3166
01:03:44,090 --> 01:03:45,219
Epic.

3167
01:03:45,250 --> 01:03:46,300
You like hiring.

3168
01:03:46,329 --> 01:03:47,880
Praise God for you.

3169
01:03:47,909 --> 01:03:49,320
You're an amazing human.

3170
01:03:49,349 --> 01:03:49,880
Okay.

3171
01:03:49,909 --> 01:03:50,940
Here's the thing.

3172
01:03:50,969 --> 01:03:53,929
That list is going to become our

3173
01:03:53,929 --> 01:03:55,699
new guidebook.

3174
01:03:55,869 --> 01:03:56,800
We're the things that are actually

3175
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:57,679
going to grow our business.

3176
01:03:57,710 --> 01:04:00,039
The entrepreneur who feels like

3177
01:04:00,039 --> 01:04:02,360
their business is killing them

3178
01:04:02,599 --> 01:04:04,019
will eventually kill their

3179
01:04:04,099 --> 01:04:04,460
business.

3180
01:04:05,690 --> 01:04:07,099
So the job that we have is to

3181
01:04:07,179 --> 01:04:08,739
backfill ourselves out of the

3182
01:04:08,739 --> 01:04:10,190
things that we hate and plug

3183
01:04:10,579 --> 01:04:11,530
ourselves into the things that we

3184
01:04:11,530 --> 01:04:11,940
love.

3185
01:04:11,969 --> 01:04:12,460
True or false?

3186
01:04:12,489 --> 01:04:12,960
True.

3187
01:04:13,250 --> 01:04:15,349
Okay, so if we do all of this, you

3188
01:04:15,349 --> 01:04:17,260
have four jobs as the CEO.

3189
01:04:17,289 --> 01:04:19,000
Hire team, train team, equip team,

3190
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,639
hold team accountable, and then as

3191
01:04:20,639 --> 01:04:22,219
the final, whatever you want.

3192
01:04:24,050 --> 01:04:24,380
It's true.

3193
01:04:24,409 --> 01:04:24,619
It's true.

3194
01:04:24,650 --> 01:04:26,440
When you have team in place using

3195
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:27,920
this protocol, and in the

3196
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:29,929
playbook, there's a whole suite of

3197
01:04:29,929 --> 01:04:31,639
training from meetings.

3198
01:04:31,670 --> 01:04:33,519
How do you run them?

3199
01:04:33,550 --> 01:04:34,539
How do you do them?

3200
01:04:34,570 --> 01:04:35,960
This is the job.

3201
01:04:35,989 --> 01:04:39,059
Hire them, train them, equip them,

3202
01:04:39,070 --> 01:04:42,010
hold them accountable, and then do

3203
01:04:42,380 --> 01:04:43,929
whatever you want.

3204
01:04:44,030 --> 01:04:45,059
So listen to this real quick.

3205
01:04:45,090 --> 01:04:46,849
At this point, you have a list of

3206
01:04:46,849 --> 01:04:48,719
things you need to stop doing.

3207
01:04:48,750 --> 01:04:49,300
Yes or no?

3208
01:04:49,329 --> 01:04:49,900
Yes.

3209
01:04:49,929 --> 01:04:51,920
And then you have a toolkit, so to

3210
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:53,579
speak, of how to go replace

3211
01:04:53,579 --> 01:04:55,409
yourself by finding the right

3212
01:04:55,409 --> 01:04:56,219
person.

3213
01:04:56,250 --> 01:04:56,760
Yes or no?

3214
01:04:56,789 --> 01:04:57,099
Yes.

3215
01:04:57,130 --> 01:04:58,920
And then we have a list of things

3216
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:00,880
of what we actually want to do.

3217
01:05:00,909 --> 01:05:01,500
Yes or no?

3218
01:05:01,530 --> 01:05:02,079
Yes.

3219
01:05:02,110 --> 01:05:03,000
That will push our business

3220
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:03,440
forward.

3221
01:05:03,469 --> 01:05:03,980
Yes or no?

3222
01:05:04,010 --> 01:05:04,440
Yes.

3223
01:05:04,469 --> 01:05:05,869
And then we have the numbers,

3224
01:05:05,960 --> 01:05:07,429
objectives, key results, and

3225
01:05:07,429 --> 01:05:08,989
assignments necessary for us to

3226
01:05:08,989 --> 01:05:10,539
hit any level of business that we

3227
01:05:10,539 --> 01:05:11,119
want.

3228
01:05:11,150 --> 01:05:11,679
Yes or no?

3229
01:05:11,710 --> 01:05:12,000
Yes.

3230
01:05:12,030 --> 01:05:13,469
How many of us are feeling rich?

3231
01:05:14,030 --> 01:05:18,159
I feel wealthy right now.

3232
01:05:18,190 --> 01:05:18,960
You feel wealthy.

3233
01:05:18,989 --> 01:05:20,039
Good answer.

3234
01:05:20,070 --> 01:05:21,739
How many of you are feeling

3235
01:05:21,739 --> 01:05:22,579
clarity?

3236
01:05:22,610 --> 01:05:23,860
Yes.

3237
01:05:23,889 --> 01:05:24,659
Yeah, 100%.

3238
01:05:24,690 --> 01:05:25,860
Here's what I want to do.

3239
01:05:25,889 --> 01:05:27,559
The beauty of a room like this is

3240
01:05:27,559 --> 01:05:29,750
there are people doing $20 million

3241
01:05:29,750 --> 01:05:31,460
a year who won't partner with me

3242
01:05:31,460 --> 01:05:32,860
because he hates me.

3243
01:05:32,889 --> 01:05:34,260
And then there are people that are

3244
01:05:34,369 --> 01:05:35,269
doing less than that.

3245
01:05:35,309 --> 01:05:36,880
And we all learn at different

3246
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:37,519
levels.

3247
01:05:37,550 --> 01:05:38,809
How many of you have a takeaway

3248
01:05:38,820 --> 01:05:40,139
that you can share with the rest

3249
01:05:40,139 --> 01:05:40,860
of the crew?

3250
01:05:40,889 --> 01:05:43,139
We're going to just do this for

3251
01:05:43,139 --> 01:05:45,400
just like 30 seconds.

3252
01:05:45,429 --> 01:05:47,780
Do we have time?

3253
01:05:47,809 --> 01:05:48,699
Yeah, five minutes.

3254
01:05:48,730 --> 01:05:49,639
Five minutes?

3255
01:05:49,670 --> 01:05:50,260
Jeez.

3256
01:05:50,289 --> 01:05:51,119
Okay.

3257
01:05:51,150 --> 01:05:52,579
We're going to do some cool stuff

3258
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:52,940
now.

3259
01:05:52,969 --> 01:05:53,739
How many of you have some

3260
01:05:53,739 --> 01:05:54,840
takeaways you want to share?

3261
01:05:54,869 --> 01:05:55,900
What you got?

3262
01:05:56,630 --> 01:05:58,050
Me doing the things that I hate to

3263
01:05:58,110 --> 01:05:59,440
do is like the riskiest thing I

3264
01:05:59,440 --> 01:05:59,980
can do.

3265
01:06:00,010 --> 01:06:01,719
You doing the things you hate to

3266
01:06:01,719 --> 01:06:03,449
do is the riskiest thing you can

3267
01:06:03,449 --> 01:06:03,860
do.

3268
01:06:03,889 --> 01:06:04,960
You want a second shot.

3269
01:06:04,989 --> 01:06:05,739
I'll be right back, dude.

3270
01:06:05,769 --> 01:06:07,159
Let's get somebody in the back.

3271
01:06:07,190 --> 01:06:08,250
What you got?

3272
01:06:08,289 --> 01:06:09,880
Running an audit on the team that

3273
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:11,449
was nice on the memories that we

3274
01:06:11,449 --> 01:06:11,940
said.

3275
01:06:11,969 --> 01:06:13,880
Running an audit so you know who

3276
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:14,590
to fire.

3277
01:06:14,630 --> 01:06:15,960
Let's fix it for you.

3278
01:06:15,989 --> 01:06:16,699
That's great.

3279
01:06:16,889 --> 01:06:17,159
Who else?

3280
01:06:17,190 --> 01:06:17,519
What do we have?

3281
01:06:17,550 --> 01:06:18,940
Yeah, what you got?

3282
01:06:18,969 --> 01:06:20,920
Stop trying to be a tough guy and

3283
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:22,880
thinking you're better because

3284
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:24,139
you're doing boring shit.

3285
01:06:24,170 --> 01:06:25,989
Stop being a tough guy because

3286
01:06:25,989 --> 01:06:27,159
you're boring?

3287
01:06:27,190 --> 01:06:28,019
No.

3288
01:06:28,050 --> 01:06:28,260
Sorry.

3289
01:06:28,289 --> 01:06:29,969
Stop thinking you're a tough guy

3290
01:06:29,969 --> 01:06:31,789
because you're trying to do boring

3291
01:06:31,789 --> 01:06:32,940
shit all the time.

3292
01:06:32,969 --> 01:06:33,559
100%.

3293
01:06:33,590 --> 01:06:34,019
Who else?

3294
01:06:34,050 --> 01:06:35,099
Yeah, hold on.

3295
01:06:35,130 --> 01:06:35,699
Let me give you the mic.

3296
01:06:36,610 --> 01:06:38,179
You can't get good at things that

3297
01:06:38,179 --> 01:06:38,800
you hate.

3298
01:06:38,829 --> 01:06:40,000
You can't get good at things that

3299
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:40,519
you hate.

3300
01:06:40,550 --> 01:06:41,159
Where'd you get these?

3301
01:06:41,190 --> 01:06:42,099
Down the street.

3302
01:06:42,130 --> 01:06:43,179
My man.

3303
01:06:43,210 --> 01:06:44,260
My man.

3304
01:06:44,289 --> 01:06:45,260
Who else wants to share?

3305
01:06:45,289 --> 01:06:46,480
Yep.

3306
01:06:46,510 --> 01:06:48,230
Give the employees more

3307
01:06:48,230 --> 01:06:50,670
responsibility when you know how

3308
01:06:50,670 --> 01:06:52,280
they can handle it.

3309
01:06:52,309 --> 01:06:52,780
Do more.

3310
01:06:52,809 --> 01:06:53,480
Have them do more.

3311
01:06:53,510 --> 01:06:54,380
Anybody else?

3312
01:06:54,409 --> 01:06:56,019
What you got, bro?

3313
01:06:56,050 --> 01:06:57,780
Blow our minds.

3314
01:06:57,809 --> 01:06:59,590
Pretty much I feel very

3315
01:06:59,590 --> 01:07:02,289
irresponsible for not having the

3316
01:07:02,699 --> 01:07:03,599
objectives.

3317
01:07:03,630 --> 01:07:05,159
I feel like a dumbass.

3318
01:07:05,510 --> 01:07:06,880
Like, oh yeah, we got the goal,

3319
01:07:06,989 --> 01:07:08,239
but just didn't make an impact of

3320
01:07:08,239 --> 01:07:08,960
that at all.

3321
01:07:08,989 --> 01:07:11,820
Well, now you're not a dumbass.

3322
01:07:11,869 --> 01:07:14,139
Now you're really, really smart.

3323
01:07:14,170 --> 01:07:16,159
You're actually brilliant.

3324
01:07:16,190 --> 01:07:17,820
Don't talk about yourself that

3325
01:07:17,820 --> 01:07:18,239
way.

3326
01:07:18,269 --> 01:07:20,099
Round two.

3327
01:07:20,130 --> 01:07:21,570
But a lot of people tell you that

3328
01:07:21,619 --> 01:07:23,059
you got to do the things that you

3329
01:07:23,059 --> 01:07:24,019
don't want to do,

3330
01:07:24,050 --> 01:07:25,340
but that kind of went against

3331
01:07:25,530 --> 01:07:26,980
every thought of order of order.

3332
01:07:27,010 --> 01:07:27,699
It makes sense.

3333
01:07:27,730 --> 01:07:29,059
Do the shit that you love.

3334
01:07:29,090 --> 01:07:30,929
Also, breaking down everything,

3335
01:07:30,929 --> 01:07:32,599
kind of like the key results.

3336
01:07:32,630 --> 01:07:33,610
Like, oh, I need to take this many

3337
01:07:33,610 --> 01:07:34,159
sales calls.

3338
01:07:34,409 --> 01:07:35,949
We need to have this show rate and

3339
01:07:35,949 --> 01:07:36,949
this close rate.

3340
01:07:36,989 --> 01:07:37,940
It makes it a lot more apparent to

3341
01:07:37,940 --> 01:07:38,880
actually get those calls.

3342
01:07:38,909 --> 01:07:40,099
Love it.

3343
01:07:40,130 --> 01:07:40,559
Amazing.

3344
01:07:40,590 --> 01:07:43,070
Round of applause for this man who

3345
01:07:43,070 --> 01:07:45,699
finally looked at me in the eyes.

3346
01:07:45,730 --> 01:07:47,449
Do we have any Q&A or questions

3347
01:07:47,449 --> 01:07:48,760
that you guys have?

3348
01:07:48,789 --> 01:07:50,159
It can be directly relevant on

3349
01:07:50,269 --> 01:07:50,599
this.

3350
01:07:50,630 --> 01:07:52,219
Andre's going to come kick me out

3351
01:07:52,219 --> 01:07:53,559
of this room in a second.

3352
01:07:53,969 --> 01:07:55,059
Is there anything you guys want to

3353
01:07:55,059 --> 01:07:56,039
know that I didn't cover?

3354
01:07:56,070 --> 01:07:57,400
Just yell it out.

3355
01:07:57,429 --> 01:07:57,820
Yes, sir.

3356
01:07:57,849 --> 01:08:00,429
What?

3357
01:08:00,469 --> 01:08:01,840
What does it mean to equip the

3358
01:08:01,949 --> 01:08:02,300
team?

3359
01:08:02,329 --> 01:08:04,099
Equip the team is giving them the

3360
01:08:04,110 --> 01:08:05,719
resources necessary and the

3361
01:08:05,719 --> 01:08:06,900
autonomy necessary to make

3362
01:08:07,199 --> 01:08:07,300
decisions.

3363
01:08:08,369 --> 01:08:09,409
So, a lot of people will hire

3364
01:08:09,409 --> 01:08:10,739
people, train them, fire them for

3365
01:08:10,739 --> 01:08:11,599
making mistakes.

3366
01:08:11,630 --> 01:08:12,500
That's not.

3367
01:08:12,530 --> 01:08:14,739
Equipping is giving somebody the

3368
01:08:14,739 --> 01:08:16,579
permission to learn and the

3369
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:18,300
permission to decide.

3370
01:08:18,329 --> 01:08:19,380
Because if you're going to hire a

3371
01:08:19,380 --> 01:08:20,800
T1, they've got to make decisions.

3372
01:08:20,829 --> 01:08:21,579
And they're going to make

3373
01:08:21,579 --> 01:08:22,779
decisions different than you do.

3374
01:08:22,810 --> 01:08:23,819
Make sense?

3375
01:08:23,850 --> 01:08:24,619
Yes.

3376
01:08:25,050 --> 01:08:25,899
Yell it out.

3377
01:08:25,930 --> 01:08:28,010
How do you create congruency of

3378
01:08:28,010 --> 01:08:28,800
vision?

3379
01:08:28,829 --> 01:08:31,199
Congruency of vision, like from me

3380
01:08:31,199 --> 01:08:33,359
down and passing it into the rest

3381
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:34,399
of the team?

3382
01:08:34,430 --> 01:08:36,239
I have a vision.

3383
01:08:36,270 --> 01:08:37,829
If they like that vision, they get

3384
01:08:37,829 --> 01:08:38,479
behind it.

3385
01:08:38,510 --> 01:08:39,550
If they don't, they go work

3386
01:08:39,560 --> 01:08:40,359
somewhere else.

3387
01:08:40,390 --> 01:08:42,640
How do you like to be realising

3388
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:43,699
over time?

3389
01:08:43,729 --> 01:08:46,590
We talk about it a lot, so we'll

3390
01:08:46,590 --> 01:08:48,239
share it a lot.

3391
01:08:48,270 --> 01:08:50,039
People tend to get in line with

3392
01:08:50,060 --> 01:08:52,220
things that they're exposed to.

3393
01:08:53,930 --> 01:08:55,659
They'll get behind things that

3394
01:08:55,659 --> 01:08:57,079
they understand and have

3395
01:08:57,079 --> 01:08:58,500
communicated about.

3396
01:08:58,529 --> 01:08:59,859
So, it's more a communication

3397
01:09:00,010 --> 01:09:01,210
thing than anything else.

3398
01:09:01,250 --> 01:09:04,659
What benchmarks do you hire T2s?

3399
01:09:04,689 --> 01:09:05,899
T2s?

3400
01:09:05,930 --> 01:09:07,500
So, this is a great question.

3401
01:09:07,529 --> 01:09:09,590
When you can no longer manage the

3402
01:09:09,590 --> 01:09:11,850
implementation of the work around

3403
01:09:11,850 --> 01:09:12,340
you,

3404
01:09:12,369 --> 01:09:14,399
you need T2s to backfill you out.

3405
01:09:14,430 --> 01:09:17,590
That's okay.

3406
01:09:17,670 --> 01:09:18,760
Totally fine.

3407
01:09:18,789 --> 01:09:19,899
The T1s right now are doing a

3408
01:09:19,899 --> 01:09:21,079
little bit of management.

3409
01:09:21,109 --> 01:09:22,739
They might not like it, but

3410
01:09:22,739 --> 01:09:23,739
they're doing it.

3411
01:09:24,100 --> 01:09:25,180
As soon as they can't manage the

3412
01:09:25,609 --> 01:09:26,810
implementation, you've got to put

3413
01:09:26,810 --> 01:09:27,979
a manager in between.

3414
01:09:28,010 --> 01:09:30,300
Have you ever moved to T1s?

3415
01:09:30,329 --> 01:09:33,720
I typically don't move them down

3416
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:37,060
or you're going to lose them.

3417
01:09:37,090 --> 01:09:39,569
You can move them up.

3418
01:09:40,069 --> 01:09:42,880
However, businesses die most often

3419
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:45,220
due to internal promotion.

3420
01:09:46,750 --> 01:09:49,520
Yeah, because if I have like a

3421
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:52,529
manager in ops and I raise them to

3422
01:09:52,529 --> 01:09:53,399
a COO.

3423
01:09:53,430 --> 01:09:55,439
Think about that being compared to

3424
01:09:55,439 --> 01:09:57,189
me going and pulling a COO from

3425
01:09:57,189 --> 01:09:58,989
someone else who's a little bit

3426
01:09:58,989 --> 01:09:59,260
bigger.

3427
01:09:59,289 --> 01:10:01,220
You're paying an opportunity cost

3428
01:10:01,220 --> 01:10:02,899
that might as well be cash.

3429
01:10:03,930 --> 01:10:05,409
So, in most cases, it's actually

3430
01:10:05,420 --> 01:10:06,840
safer for the business to go pull

3431
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:08,579
someone with the expertise, bring

3432
01:10:08,649 --> 01:10:09,020
them in.

3433
01:10:09,050 --> 01:10:10,720
Unless you're willing to let that

3434
01:10:10,720 --> 01:10:12,500
person really go through the trial

3435
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:13,680
and error process.

3436
01:10:13,710 --> 01:10:15,550
Yeah, because they're not like T1

3437
01:10:15,550 --> 01:10:16,140
titles.

3438
01:10:16,170 --> 01:10:17,699
But using that org chart, they

3439
01:10:17,699 --> 01:10:19,600
have the T1 responsibilities.

3440
01:10:19,630 --> 01:10:20,649
If they're making all the

3441
01:10:20,649 --> 01:10:22,000
decisions for the department,

3442
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:22,760
they're a T1.

3443
01:10:23,010 --> 01:10:24,359
Yeah, who else?

3444
01:10:24,390 --> 01:10:26,710
As you scaled, how do you balance

3445
01:10:26,710 --> 01:10:28,909
scaling the business with your

3446
01:10:29,279 --> 01:10:29,720
family?

3447
01:10:29,750 --> 01:10:30,819
With my family?

3448
01:10:30,850 --> 01:10:32,920
He said, how did I balance scaling

3449
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:34,859
the business with my family?

3450
01:10:34,890 --> 01:10:36,199
This is a great question if you

3451
01:10:36,369 --> 01:10:37,520
want me to tackle it, if I have

3452
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:38,159
the time.

3453
01:10:38,189 --> 01:10:39,279
Let's do it.

3454
01:10:39,310 --> 01:10:41,500
I actually didn't.

3455
01:10:41,529 --> 01:10:43,439
That's the short answer.

3456
01:10:43,470 --> 01:10:44,720
I had to learn how to do it.

3457
01:10:44,750 --> 01:10:46,659
So, the people who have like, the

3458
01:10:46,659 --> 01:10:48,880
people, talking about productivity

3459
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:50,319
without kids is a joke.

3460
01:10:51,750 --> 01:10:53,159
When I had my first kid, I was

3461
01:10:53,239 --> 01:10:54,189
like, oh, shit.

3462
01:10:54,229 --> 01:10:57,319
There's no time anywhere.

3463
01:10:57,350 --> 01:10:58,430
And then we had the second one,

3464
01:10:58,430 --> 01:10:59,609
and I was like, ooh, this is even

3465
01:10:59,609 --> 01:11:00,039
worse.

3466
01:11:00,069 --> 01:11:02,329
So, reading is like a thing of

3467
01:11:02,329 --> 01:11:03,859
glory for me now.

3468
01:11:03,890 --> 01:11:05,180
Like, I'm, oh, my God, I have an

3469
01:11:05,279 --> 01:11:05,859
hour to read.

3470
01:11:05,890 --> 01:11:10,359
The prioritization is a law.

3471
01:11:10,390 --> 01:11:12,250
So, if you misprioritize, you'll

3472
01:11:12,250 --> 01:11:13,939
lose all of the priorities.

3473
01:11:13,970 --> 01:11:16,199
And so, what I've got right now is

3474
01:11:16,199 --> 01:11:17,600
I've got myself.

3475
01:11:17,630 --> 01:11:19,050
I'm actually at the top.

3476
01:11:19,130 --> 01:11:20,720
I just posted about this today.

3477
01:11:21,489 --> 01:11:22,859
If you cheat yourself, you'll also

3478
01:11:22,970 --> 01:11:24,239
fail everyone else around you.

3479
01:11:24,270 --> 01:11:26,119
So, there's a rule book for me.

3480
01:11:26,149 --> 01:11:27,270
I need a certain amount of

3481
01:11:27,270 --> 01:11:28,640
reading, a certain amount of

3482
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:30,079
studying, a certain amount of

3483
01:11:30,079 --> 01:11:30,779
exercise.

3484
01:11:30,810 --> 01:11:33,680
And I try to be very un, like,

3485
01:11:33,680 --> 01:11:37,149
yeah, I don't compromise that.

3486
01:11:37,189 --> 01:11:38,500
Second is the family.

3487
01:11:38,529 --> 01:11:39,949
So, I'm not going to miss, like,

3488
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:41,300
I'm going to wake my kids up every

3489
01:11:41,300 --> 01:11:41,619
day.

3490
01:11:41,649 --> 01:11:43,319
They wake up at seven.

3491
01:11:43,350 --> 01:11:44,569
I'm going to wake them up every

3492
01:11:44,569 --> 01:11:44,880
day.

3493
01:11:45,170 --> 01:11:46,880
If you cheat on priorities, you

3494
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:48,359
begin to feel like you don't

3495
01:11:48,359 --> 01:11:49,600
deserve anything.

3496
01:11:50,829 --> 01:11:52,439
So, it's not really a balancing

3497
01:11:52,439 --> 01:11:53,039
effect.

3498
01:11:53,069 --> 01:11:54,680
It's a prioritization matter.

3499
01:11:54,710 --> 01:11:56,479
After my family's taken care of,

3500
01:11:56,489 --> 01:11:58,220
there's a playbook for that.

3501
01:11:58,250 --> 01:11:59,390
So, like, I'm going to wake my

3502
01:11:59,390 --> 01:12:00,399
kids up every morning.

3503
01:12:00,430 --> 01:12:01,760
I have a weekly date with my four

3504
01:12:01,909 --> 01:12:03,109
and a half year old, Kate.

3505
01:12:03,550 --> 01:12:05,180
I have a weekly date with my wife,

3506
01:12:05,180 --> 01:12:05,800
Lindsay.

3507
01:12:05,829 --> 01:12:08,210
And when that's done, we're good.

3508
01:12:08,250 --> 01:12:09,600
And I can put all my time into the

3509
01:12:09,729 --> 01:12:10,880
next priority, which is the

3510
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:12,159
business and the team and the

3511
01:12:12,159 --> 01:12:12,720
staff.

3512
01:12:12,750 --> 01:12:13,970
And then after that, I've got

3513
01:12:14,239 --> 01:12:15,680
relationships and everything else.

3514
01:12:16,170 --> 01:12:17,300
And so, that's kind of, like, my

3515
01:12:17,300 --> 01:12:17,840
four things.

3516
01:12:17,869 --> 01:12:21,020
And, like, this morning, I'm on a

3517
01:12:21,020 --> 01:12:21,960
plane.

3518
01:12:21,989 --> 01:12:23,619
I missed donut date with my

3519
01:12:23,619 --> 01:12:24,500
daughter.

3520
01:12:24,529 --> 01:12:25,880
But I'm grabbing that Monday.

3521
01:12:25,909 --> 01:12:27,579
So, I'll just backfill it in.

3522
01:12:27,609 --> 01:12:29,399
So, it's not a sacrifice.

3523
01:12:29,430 --> 01:12:30,500
It's just a moving around.

3524
01:12:30,529 --> 01:12:31,260
Does that help?

3525
01:12:31,289 --> 01:12:32,060
Yeah.

3526
01:12:32,090 --> 01:12:32,779
Cool.

3527
01:12:32,810 --> 01:12:33,619
All right.

3528
01:12:33,649 --> 01:12:35,359
Let's do two more questions.

3529
01:12:35,390 --> 01:12:38,140
And then we're going to bring the

3530
01:12:38,140 --> 01:12:39,539
boss back up.

3531
01:12:39,569 --> 01:12:40,939
What you got?

3532
01:12:40,970 --> 01:12:42,239
So, you know how you said you

3533
01:12:42,449 --> 01:12:44,100
should hire someone who's working

3534
01:12:44,100 --> 01:12:45,640
at another business that's, like,

3535
01:12:45,670 --> 01:12:46,439
three to five X your current

3536
01:12:46,439 --> 01:12:47,000
business size.

3537
01:12:47,029 --> 01:12:47,680
Yes, steal them.

3538
01:12:47,710 --> 01:12:49,970
So, my question is, like, number

3539
01:12:49,970 --> 01:12:51,350
one, how do you sell them to work

3540
01:12:51,350 --> 01:12:52,000
for you because you're

3541
01:12:52,029 --> 01:12:52,779
three to five X smaller?

3542
01:12:52,810 --> 01:12:53,800
And number two, how do you

3543
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:55,220
properly align the incentives?

3544
01:12:55,250 --> 01:12:56,220
Yeah, great question.

3545
01:12:56,250 --> 01:12:57,380
How do you steal them and how do

3546
01:12:57,380 --> 01:12:58,560
you align the incentives?

3547
01:12:58,590 --> 01:13:00,729
The vision that you have as an

3548
01:13:00,729 --> 01:13:03,340
entrepreneur is like a vacuum.

3549
01:13:03,369 --> 01:13:05,380
It sucks people in or repels

3550
01:13:05,380 --> 01:13:06,579
people away.

3551
01:13:06,609 --> 01:13:07,779
So, if you're trying to hire

3552
01:13:08,090 --> 01:13:09,079
somebody from somebody who's a

3553
01:13:09,079 --> 01:13:10,600
bigger company, it doesn't matter.

3554
01:13:10,630 --> 01:13:11,960
What you really are going to

3555
01:13:12,109 --> 01:13:13,369
battle is you're hiring from

3556
01:13:13,369 --> 01:13:14,979
someone with a bigger orbit of

3557
01:13:14,979 --> 01:13:15,239
vision.

3558
01:13:15,670 --> 01:13:16,460
Make sense?

3559
01:13:16,489 --> 01:13:18,010
So, like, Arena is one of my

3560
01:13:18,010 --> 01:13:18,899
businesses.

3561
01:13:18,930 --> 01:13:21,000
The priority for Arena, the

3562
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,439
mission for Arena is to deprogram

3563
01:13:23,819 --> 01:13:26,789
victimhood from the world and to

3564
01:13:26,789 --> 01:13:27,720
eliminate suicide.

3565
01:13:27,750 --> 01:13:29,460
Is that big or little?

3566
01:13:29,489 --> 01:13:31,279
People want to work for me for

3567
01:13:31,279 --> 01:13:31,840
free.

3568
01:13:31,869 --> 01:13:33,800
They want to leave other companies

3569
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:35,319
and work for me for free.

3570
01:13:35,970 --> 01:13:37,199
The mission for a wealthy

3571
01:13:37,460 --> 01:13:38,569
consultant is to unlock and

3572
01:13:38,569 --> 01:13:40,100
monetize human expertise.

3573
01:13:40,130 --> 01:13:41,500
Is that big or little?

3574
01:13:41,529 --> 01:13:44,100
So, it's a missional thing.

3575
01:13:44,149 --> 01:13:45,710
If your vision is big enough,

3576
01:13:45,710 --> 01:13:47,500
they'll be attracted into it.

3577
01:13:47,529 --> 01:13:48,800
How do you align incentives?

3578
01:13:48,829 --> 01:13:51,119
With their T1s at the very top,

3579
01:13:51,119 --> 01:13:53,289
most of the time giving them a bit

3580
01:13:53,289 --> 01:13:56,689
of profit share and then a three

3581
01:13:56,699 --> 01:13:58,539
to four type of, like, bonuses.

3582
01:13:59,529 --> 01:14:01,140
One year, three year, and

3583
01:14:01,140 --> 01:14:02,050
quarterly.

3584
01:14:02,090 --> 01:14:04,199
And we get into all of that in the

3585
01:14:04,199 --> 01:14:05,180
playbook.

3586
01:14:05,210 --> 01:14:06,159
One more question.

3587
01:14:06,189 --> 01:14:08,920
You?

3588
01:14:09,050 --> 01:14:10,039
Yes.

3589
01:14:10,069 --> 01:14:10,680
Isaac.

3590
01:14:10,710 --> 01:14:12,220
Wonderful name.

3591
01:14:12,250 --> 01:14:13,180
What do you got?

3592
01:14:13,210 --> 01:14:14,630
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

3593
01:14:14,710 --> 01:14:15,720
It's in the Bible, dude.

3594
01:14:15,750 --> 01:14:16,600
You're blessed.

3595
01:14:16,630 --> 01:14:17,140
David?

3596
01:14:17,170 --> 01:14:18,359
King David?

3597
01:14:18,390 --> 01:14:19,560
What do you got?

3598
01:14:19,590 --> 01:14:21,010
Can you talk to, like, values and,

3599
01:14:21,079 --> 01:14:22,289
like, how you might think about

3600
01:14:22,289 --> 01:14:23,399
those in your company?

3601
01:14:23,430 --> 01:14:23,979
Values?

3602
01:14:24,010 --> 01:14:24,979
I'm going to give you my values.

3603
01:14:25,529 --> 01:14:26,779
Yeah, so I'm going to skip that

3604
01:14:27,010 --> 01:14:28,109
question and do one more because

3605
01:14:28,109 --> 01:14:29,369
I'm going to give them to you at

3606
01:14:29,369 --> 01:14:29,859
the end.

3607
01:14:29,890 --> 01:14:32,619
Was it hard for you to unlearn the

3608
01:14:32,619 --> 01:14:33,800
strength?

3609
01:14:33,829 --> 01:14:34,920
You talked about that big shift.

3610
01:14:34,949 --> 01:14:36,600
You burned a business to the

3611
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:38,350
ground and then you have this

3612
01:14:38,350 --> 01:14:40,319
model now for doing whatever you

3613
01:14:40,319 --> 01:14:42,140
want, which is what you need to

3614
01:14:42,140 --> 01:14:42,500
do.

3615
01:14:42,529 --> 01:14:43,699
Did you have to unlearn, like,

3616
01:14:43,699 --> 01:14:44,699
just, like, stress?

3617
01:14:44,729 --> 01:14:45,640
Dude, everything.

3618
01:14:45,670 --> 01:14:47,199
Yeah, everything.

3619
01:14:48,029 --> 01:14:51,170
Because the piece of me that felt

3620
01:14:51,170 --> 01:14:54,329
like I was dying in the middle was

3621
01:14:54,439 --> 01:14:57,260
equally next to the piece of me

3622
01:14:57,260 --> 01:14:59,699
that felt like I would be a

3623
01:14:59,779 --> 01:15:01,920
failure if I quit.

3624
01:15:01,949 --> 01:15:04,939
So you've heard, like, quitters

3625
01:15:04,939 --> 01:15:07,720
never win and winners never.

3626
01:15:07,750 --> 01:15:09,520
Bullshit.

3627
01:15:09,550 --> 01:15:11,699
Winners quit all the time.

3628
01:15:12,489 --> 01:15:13,930
Like, they literally quit their

3629
01:15:13,979 --> 01:15:14,800
way to success.

3630
01:15:14,829 --> 01:15:16,340
As soon as you are not deeply

3631
01:15:16,340 --> 01:15:18,310
passionate about the outcome, if

3632
01:15:18,310 --> 01:15:20,260
you win, you should not be playing

3633
01:15:20,260 --> 01:15:21,140
the game.

3634
01:15:21,170 --> 01:15:22,840
The game doesn't matter.

3635
01:15:22,869 --> 01:15:24,460
And so what happened with me is I

3636
01:15:24,460 --> 01:15:26,079
hit that point where I no longer

3637
01:15:26,079 --> 01:15:27,829
cared about the outcome because I

3638
01:15:27,829 --> 01:15:29,010
was out of energy.

3639
01:15:29,069 --> 01:15:30,439
Not out of time.

3640
01:15:30,470 --> 01:15:31,319
I was out of energy.

3641
01:15:31,350 --> 01:15:32,960
Energy is superior to time as a

3642
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:33,729
resource.

3643
01:15:34,489 --> 01:15:35,699
And so when I got into the new

3644
01:15:35,970 --> 01:15:37,010
business units and I started

3645
01:15:37,010 --> 01:15:38,359
building the new thing and the

3646
01:15:38,359 --> 01:15:40,289
portfolio came together, my first

3647
01:15:40,289 --> 01:15:42,250
instinct was, like, I have to

3648
01:15:42,250 --> 01:15:42,899
grind.

3649
01:15:42,930 --> 01:15:44,699
Because that's what it was like a

3650
01:15:44,710 --> 01:15:45,100
TF.

3651
01:15:45,130 --> 01:15:46,100
That's what it was like a sales

3652
01:15:46,100 --> 01:15:46,500
mentor.

3653
01:15:46,529 --> 01:15:49,260
And I felt like I was unproductive

3654
01:15:49,260 --> 01:15:51,439
because I was not busy.

3655
01:15:51,470 --> 01:15:53,119
And so that just works.

3656
01:15:53,149 --> 01:15:55,210
You had to go through unveiling

3657
01:15:55,210 --> 01:15:56,239
the layers.

3658
01:15:56,930 --> 01:15:58,520
And, like, you know, I would

3659
01:15:58,520 --> 01:16:00,350
rather be productive with a little

3660
01:16:00,350 --> 01:16:02,050
bit less time than unproductive

3661
01:16:02,050 --> 01:16:04,659
with 40, 50, 60 hours a week.

3662
01:16:04,689 --> 01:16:05,640
So it's something that you,

3663
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:06,670
there's three things that you

3664
01:16:06,670 --> 01:16:07,579
learn all of the time.

3665
01:16:07,609 --> 01:16:08,979
There's only three categories.

3666
01:16:09,010 --> 01:16:11,100
Things that you have to unlearn.

3667
01:16:11,130 --> 01:16:13,460
Right?

3668
01:16:13,489 --> 01:16:15,460
Things that you have to relearn.

3669
01:16:15,489 --> 01:16:16,569
How many of you have had to learn

3670
01:16:16,569 --> 01:16:17,850
a lesson for the second, third, or

3671
01:16:17,850 --> 01:16:18,520
fourth time?

3672
01:16:18,550 --> 01:16:19,960
Yeah, it sucks.

3673
01:16:19,989 --> 01:16:21,560
But a lesson will repeat itself

3674
01:16:21,560 --> 01:16:22,720
until you learn it.

3675
01:16:23,510 --> 01:16:24,539
And then the third are the things

3676
01:16:24,539 --> 01:16:25,600
you learn for the first time.

3677
01:16:25,630 --> 01:16:28,039
A very small portion of our lives

3678
01:16:28,039 --> 01:16:30,560
today are the third category.

3679
01:16:30,590 --> 01:16:32,720
Most of them are the first two.

3680
01:16:32,750 --> 01:16:34,300
And if we want to learn more

3681
01:16:34,300 --> 01:16:36,390
things, we have to actually grasp

3682
01:16:36,390 --> 01:16:38,340
the lesson so we stop relearning

3683
01:16:38,340 --> 01:16:40,489
the same old shit over and over.

3684
01:16:40,529 --> 01:16:41,989
But, yeah, dude, it was incredibly

3685
01:16:42,020 --> 01:16:42,640
difficult.

3686
01:16:42,670 --> 01:16:43,970
In fact, mentally, if you're not

3687
01:16:44,149 --> 01:16:45,149
feeling like it's difficult,

3688
01:16:45,149 --> 01:16:46,409
you're just not doing something

3689
01:16:46,409 --> 01:16:47,100
worthwhile.

3690
01:16:47,130 --> 01:16:49,539
So it's still difficult for me.

3691
01:16:49,569 --> 01:16:51,250
Every once in a while I'll still

3692
01:16:51,250 --> 01:16:53,239
be like, you know, I'm just like,

3693
01:16:53,239 --> 01:16:54,000
I'm poor.

3694
01:16:54,029 --> 01:16:57,010
Literally going broke.

3695
01:16:57,050 --> 01:16:58,420
And people are like, what are you

3696
01:16:58,539 --> 01:16:59,239
talking about?

3697
01:16:59,270 --> 01:17:01,079
Makes zero sense.

3698
01:17:01,109 --> 01:17:02,239
Cry me a river.

3699
01:17:02,270 --> 01:17:04,550
And I'll be like, I'm completely

3700
01:17:04,550 --> 01:17:05,619
out of time.

3701
01:17:05,649 --> 01:17:07,260
And so I need to work harder.

3702
01:17:07,289 --> 01:17:09,159
Which doesn't make any sense.

3703
01:17:09,189 --> 01:17:10,279
So you have to have that time to

3704
01:17:10,279 --> 01:17:11,569
really piece it all together.

3705
01:17:11,609 --> 01:17:13,399
And have friends that work.

3706
01:17:13,869 --> 01:17:15,949
All right, one, two, three, round

3707
01:17:15,949 --> 01:17:17,520
of applause for the crew.

3708
01:17:17,550 --> 01:17:18,720
You can come take it if you want.

3709
01:17:18,750 --> 01:17:20,100
Thank you, guys.

3710
01:17:20,130 --> 01:17:24,140
We love what you do, man.

3711
01:17:24,170 --> 01:17:24,920
Thanks, bro.

3712
01:17:24,949 --> 01:17:26,279
You're the man.

3713
01:17:26,310 --> 01:17:28,880
One more round of applause for

3714
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:30,319
Taylor Rose.

3715
01:17:30,350 --> 01:17:31,859
Oh, hey.

3716
01:17:31,890 --> 01:17:35,579
Also, that ascension link.

3717
01:17:35,609 --> 01:17:37,000
Oh, yeah, it's on here.

3718
01:17:37,029 --> 01:17:37,680
Yeah, it's on here.

3719
01:17:37,829 --> 01:17:39,159
I just, he's got it off, I think.

3720
01:17:39,189 --> 01:17:40,680
It's not a QR.

3721
01:17:40,710 --> 01:17:43,119
If you go to this link, don't

3722
01:17:43,119 --> 01:17:44,439
share this, please.

3723
01:17:44,470 --> 01:17:45,579
Promise.

3724
01:17:45,609 --> 01:17:46,920
Yeah, I promise.

3725
01:17:46,949 --> 01:17:47,600
Scout's honor.

3726
01:17:47,630 --> 01:17:49,060
I have your IP.

3727
01:17:49,090 --> 01:17:49,619
I'll find you.

3728
01:17:49,649 --> 01:17:52,170
This, I'm going to give you guys

3729
01:17:52,170 --> 01:17:53,720
just a playbook.

3730
01:17:53,750 --> 01:17:55,090
So this is literally, it's a

3731
01:17:55,229 --> 01:17:56,329
10,000.

3732
01:17:56,369 --> 01:17:57,600
People pay 10 grand for this.

3733
01:17:57,630 --> 01:17:59,779
And you don't have to pay for any

3734
01:17:59,779 --> 01:18:00,409
of it.

3735
01:18:00,449 --> 01:18:02,119
But I want you to go in more

3736
01:18:02,119 --> 01:18:02,659
detail.

3737
01:18:02,689 --> 01:18:04,289
Because I need you to change the

3738
01:18:04,289 --> 01:18:04,840
world.

3739
01:18:05,010 --> 01:18:06,250
If you can get this material, it

3740
01:18:06,489 --> 01:18:08,039
makes all of the last five years

3741
01:18:08,039 --> 01:18:08,539
for me worth it.

3742
01:18:08,569 --> 01:18:09,399
So thank you, guys.

3743
01:18:09,430 --> 01:18:16,579
I wanted to, I kind of like that

3744
01:18:16,579 --> 01:18:18,840
style.

3745
01:18:18,869 --> 01:18:20,659
So I'm going to come on the stage,

3746
01:18:20,659 --> 01:18:21,699
keep it casual.

3747
01:18:21,729 --> 01:18:24,100
But, I mean, there's not much more

3748
01:18:24,100 --> 01:18:25,739
to say at this point.

3749
01:18:25,770 --> 01:18:27,189
I think we're all just excited to

3750
01:18:27,260 --> 01:18:28,149
get on that boat.

3751
01:18:28,189 --> 01:18:30,909
Boats.

3752
01:18:31,029 --> 01:18:32,779
But that's really important.

3753
01:18:33,810 --> 01:18:35,100
Because you've got to make dials.

3754
01:18:35,130 --> 01:18:38,279
And right now it's like 530, 540.

3755
01:18:38,310 --> 01:18:39,640
And so we've got to go over there

3756
01:18:39,789 --> 01:18:41,010
because it's going to move,

3757
01:18:41,010 --> 01:18:42,380
whether you're on there or not.

3758
01:18:42,409 --> 01:18:42,550
Sorry.

3759
01:18:42,550 --> 01:18:43,060
What was your question?

3760
01:18:43,090 --> 01:18:45,159
It was similar to that one.

3761
01:18:45,189 --> 01:18:46,789
I was going to say, is it worth it

3762
01:18:46,789 --> 01:18:48,779
to incentivize employees with

3763
01:18:48,779 --> 01:18:50,920
profit share or equity model?

3764
01:18:50,949 --> 01:18:52,000
T2 and T1.

3765
01:18:52,029 --> 01:18:52,869
We're dealing with that literally

3766
01:18:52,869 --> 01:18:53,220
right now.

3767
01:18:53,250 --> 01:18:55,319
T2 and T1, 100%.

3768
01:18:55,350 --> 01:18:57,300
Thank you to each of you for

3769
01:18:57,300 --> 01:18:59,640
allowing me to just live out our

3770
01:19:00,239 --> 01:19:01,359
experience as well.

3771
01:19:01,409 --> 01:19:02,220
So thank you guys so much.

3772
01:19:02,250 --> 01:19:02,779
You're going to be on the boat.

3773
01:19:02,810 --> 01:19:03,359
Yeah.

3774
01:19:03,399 --> 01:19:14,569
Thank you very much.

3775
01:19:14,609 --> 01:19:15,020
Thank you.

3776
01:19:15,050 --> 01:19:16,140
Thank you.

3777
01:19:16,170 --> 01:19:16,760
Thank you.
