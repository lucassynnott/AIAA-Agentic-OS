1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,030
Welcome guys.

2
00:00:01,129 --> 00:00:02,930
So in this video, I'm actually

3
00:00:03,129 --> 00:00:05,009
going to show you how to manage a

4
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:06,379
customer

5
00:00:06,419 --> 00:00:08,028
success manager or client success

6
00:00:08,028 --> 00:00:09,439
manager, CSM essentially,

7
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:10,300
effectively.

8
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:11,160
So this is going

9
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:13,449
to be my guide of how like you as

10
00:00:13,449 --> 00:00:15,570
a founder can do this in your

11
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:16,079
time.

12
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:17,519
And I'll cover a

13
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:19,129
later video later down the line of

14
00:00:19,129 --> 00:00:20,690
like how to actually like remove

15
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:21,980
yourself from the management

16
00:00:22,019 --> 00:00:23,329
kind of situation there, what that

17
00:00:23,449 --> 00:00:24,589
handover actually looks like.

18
00:00:24,739 --> 00:00:25,500
But this is how you the

19
00:00:25,539 --> 00:00:27,149
founder is actually going to

20
00:00:27,149 --> 00:00:28,859
manage your customer success

21
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:30,359
managers or just customer

22
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:32,060
success manager in general, if you

23
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:32,969
only have the one.

24
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:36,799
So the management reality check,

25
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:36,929
why

26
00:00:36,979 --> 00:00:38,640
CSM leadership matters.

27
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:40,399
Like the data paints a clear

28
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:41,149
picture.

29
00:00:41,149 --> 00:00:43,000
CSM teams without systematic

30
00:00:43,049 --> 00:00:44,710
management frameworks, they just

31
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:47,009
achieve like 30% lower retention

32
00:00:47,009 --> 00:00:48,799
rates and 47% higher turnover

33
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,359
compared to teams with structured

34
00:00:50,359 --> 00:00:51,009
oversight.

35
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:52,570
So in other words, you're going to

36
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:53,280
have, you're

37
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,570
you're looking at 50% churn and

38
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:57,640
you're like, you know, you're

39
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,600
probably going to on average,

40
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,700
if you're converting and retaining

41
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:02,570
50% of your clients, you're only

42
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:04,310
going to retain about 20%

43
00:01:04,359 --> 00:01:04,900
of them.

44
00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:06,510
And so it's, it's really not a

45
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:07,219
good look.

46
00:01:07,219 --> 00:01:09,239
It's really much, much lower kind

47
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,099
of insights

48
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:10,609
there.

49
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:12,310
So again, you really do need to

50
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:13,799
keep an eye on your CSMs.

51
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:17,819
And again, they are pretty

52
00:01:17,859 --> 00:01:19,500
much the brand there who your

53
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,030
clients are talking to on a

54
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:22,379
day-to-day basis.

55
00:01:22,379 --> 00:01:23,760
If you're not keeping track

56
00:01:23,859 --> 00:01:26,159
of this and you let them kind of

57
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:28,739
run wild and there's no management

58
00:01:29,269 --> 00:01:31,180
there, they can easily get

59
00:01:31,219 --> 00:01:31,879
complacent.

60
00:01:31,879 --> 00:01:32,780
They can get lazy.

61
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:34,239
They're not going to be proactive

62
00:01:34,299 --> 00:01:35,739
and they're probably not even

63
00:01:35,739 --> 00:01:35,980
going to

64
00:01:36,019 --> 00:01:36,680
put that much effort into your

65
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:37,079
clients.

66
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:38,010
And therefore your clients aren't

67
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:38,939
going to put that much effort

68
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:39,760
into your service and your

69
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,140
product.

70
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:42,849
So the unique challenge of CSM

71
00:01:42,849 --> 00:01:44,980
management is just fundamentally

72
00:01:45,019 --> 00:01:46,590
different approaches to most other

73
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:47,019
roles.

74
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,290
CSMs are the critical bridge

75
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:49,519
between your company and your

76
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,129
clients.

77
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:51,709
And so client trust and loyalty

78
00:01:51,709 --> 00:01:53,049
and revenue retention and

79
00:01:53,049 --> 00:01:53,760
expansion.

80
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:55,000
So, and then your brand

81
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:55,819
reputation.

82
00:01:55,819 --> 00:01:57,310
So most successful CSM teams

83
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:59,010
operate on predictable rhythms

84
00:01:59,010 --> 00:01:59,920
with continuous quality

85
00:02:00,459 --> 00:02:00,840
monitoring,

86
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:02,890
not reactive management based off

87
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:03,670
problems.

88
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:05,290
So you want to be constantly

89
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:06,760
keeping an eye on things and

90
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,469
having a routine and having like

91
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:10,490
an actual system in your calendar

92
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:13,120
and in place, not just clients

93
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:14,139
pissed off.

94
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:15,110
Now I need to react.

95
00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:16,580
Now I need to look and investigate

96
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:18,080
and audit and ask the client and

97
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,099
then ask the CSM

98
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,680
and then look at a call recording

99
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,199
and look back on Slack or like,

100
00:02:22,259 --> 00:02:23,560
you know, like, let me show me

101
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,050
these emails

102
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,180
and going through this entire

103
00:02:25,539 --> 00:02:27,500
investigation to uncover what the

104
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,000
actual problem is.

105
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:30,430
Because sometimes clients are just

106
00:02:30,539 --> 00:02:31,830
being really, really difficult.

107
00:02:31,909 --> 00:02:32,949
In some cases, CSMs are just not

108
00:02:32,949 --> 00:02:34,060
doing their fucking job.

109
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,340
And so it's like

110
00:02:35,379 --> 00:02:36,849
you're going to spend so many

111
00:02:36,849 --> 00:02:38,599
hours wasted on just figuring out

112
00:02:38,629 --> 00:02:39,900
what the problem is.

113
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,360
And no matter what,

114
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,710
you're going to be disappointed by

115
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:43,360
the answer.

116
00:02:43,419 --> 00:02:44,870
So it's just really a head-racking

117
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:45,780
process for you

118
00:02:45,819 --> 00:02:46,340
specifically.

119
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,550
So CSM management fails

120
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,099
consequences, extended more than

121
00:02:51,229 --> 00:02:52,349
team dynamics and poor management

122
00:02:52,419 --> 00:02:53,990
creates a ripple effect that like

123
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:54,990
undermines and client

124
00:02:55,189 --> 00:02:57,300
relationships, damages trust, and

125
00:02:57,699 --> 00:02:57,699
ultimately

126
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:58,340
it always leads to churn.

127
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:59,969
So structured teams have

128
00:02:59,969 --> 00:03:02,389
consistent client communication,

129
00:03:02,389 --> 00:03:03,580
proactive issue

130
00:03:03,629 --> 00:03:05,289
identification, higher client

131
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:07,520
satisfaction scores, and lower

132
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,520
turnover rates, whether that's

133
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:10,439
team and lower

134
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,439
churn rates.

135
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:13,419
Unstructured teams are reactive

136
00:03:13,419 --> 00:03:14,750
client management.

137
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,520
You only react to problems and

138
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:16,719
your

139
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:18,919
firefighting approaches to issues.

140
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:20,949
You've lowered client satisfaction

141
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:21,620
scores.

142
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:22,949
Your team's going to burn

143
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,159
out.

144
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:23,949
Your clients are going to get

145
00:03:23,979 --> 00:03:24,659
pissed off as well.

146
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:28,479
So weekly management rhythm.

147
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:30,289
This is my personal

148
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:32,009
rhythm that I have with the team

149
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:34,000
that I run in Client Ascension.

150
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,419
So on Mondays, I like to run a

151
00:03:37,419 --> 00:03:38,020
power hour

152
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,719
first thing on Monday morning with

153
00:03:39,889 --> 00:03:40,360
my team.

154
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,550
That is there to focus on specific

155
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,379
tasks that we want to

156
00:03:45,419 --> 00:03:45,860
cover.

157
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,430
Like that is important to us.

158
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:48,870
And I'll go into those in a lot

159
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,620
more deeper detail, but just to

160
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:50,740
give

161
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:52,360
you a quick understanding, it

162
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,259
could be churn reactivation, trust

163
00:03:54,259 --> 00:03:56,120
pilot collection, check-ins,

164
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:57,409
health score sheets.

165
00:03:57,539 --> 00:03:59,180
It could be something that we need

166
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,030
to, like anything that we need to

167
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:01,659
do as a team,

168
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:03,219
that's part of the work that we

169
00:04:03,219 --> 00:04:04,330
actually have to do.

170
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,430
I just put it into an hour for us

171
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:07,979
to sit down and silence for the

172
00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:07,979
first

173
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,590
hour of the day and just get

174
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:10,919
something that's a really high

175
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:12,840
leverage task for us out of the

176
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,919
way, first and

177
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,439
foremost.

178
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:17,459
So all CSMs and anyone that is in

179
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:19,189
the management position, that's

180
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:19,720
key.

181
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,389
They need to have the

182
00:04:21,509 --> 00:04:23,170
accountability of the senior there

183
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,519
on the call so that people are

184
00:04:24,579 --> 00:04:26,379
actually getting something done.

185
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:28,500
Otherwise, they will sit on a call

186
00:04:28,509 --> 00:04:29,439
and fuck around for an hour.

187
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,149
an hour.

188
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,879
Not all, but most cases they will,

189
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:35,550
especially as like time goes on

190
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:37,259
and no one's checking that call.

191
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,519
Tuesday is the one-to-one that is

192
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:41,699
there where you, the founder or

193
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:43,540
the manager of the client success

194
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:45,430
team will have an individual

195
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:46,089
performance

196
00:04:46,149 --> 00:04:48,269
development conversation with the

197
00:04:48,269 --> 00:04:48,709
CSM.

198
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:50,800
They're typically 30 minutes.

199
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,100
I would use it as an hour for

200
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:54,839
anyone that's a new hire so that

201
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:55,480
you can kind of

202
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:56,759
have like a bit of more of a

203
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:58,600
training session with that person,

204
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,399
but typically they're only 30

205
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:01,079
minutes long.

206
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:02,620
That's going to be the manager of

207
00:05:02,689 --> 00:05:04,000
the founder and the individual

208
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:07,000
CSM, not a team, just the one CSM.

209
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,319
Then you have Wednesday.

210
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:10,720
I like to do a team training.

211
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,160
Again, I like to run this at 9

212
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:12,529
a.m.

213
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,129
in the morning.

214
00:05:13,209 --> 00:05:15,360
This sometimes is a duration of 60

215
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:16,199
to 90 minutes.

216
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,779
This is for skills development and

217
00:05:17,779 --> 00:05:18,810
knowledge expansion.

218
00:05:19,009 --> 00:05:21,120
CSMs always have to stay ahead of

219
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,300
the curve.

220
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,939
They always have to learn new

221
00:05:23,939 --> 00:05:24,620
things and

222
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,069
new insights, whether you have a

223
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,509
new service, new offering, new

224
00:05:27,509 --> 00:05:28,220
packaging.

225
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:29,540
It doesn't matter.

226
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,459
As long as your business is

227
00:05:31,459 --> 00:05:32,899
evolving, they have something to

228
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:34,209
learn and understand about.

229
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,310
So you can leave them to learn

230
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,310
this on their own sometimes and

231
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:40,129
they can sometimes like they'll

232
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:41,019
forget.

233
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:42,519
It's not their fault because they

234
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:43,019
have calls and they're not

235
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,079
dealing with clients and they're

236
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:45,019
putting out fires and they're

237
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:46,160
helping strategic problems.

238
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,939
So it's helpful just to actually

239
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:49,819
set some time during the week.

240
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:52,019
So at least one hour a week, they

241
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:53,439
are taking the time to learn and

242
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:54,740
develop and they should be doing

243
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,810
this as a team so that everyone's

244
00:05:57,810 --> 00:05:59,189
learning together and everyone's

245
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,430
asking questions and there's

246
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:02,069
alignment there across the board.

247
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:04,870
Then finally, Friday, the

248
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:06,339
leadership alignment.

249
00:06:06,339 --> 00:06:08,199
That is your weekly SSE team call.

250
00:06:08,629 --> 00:06:09,540
That is going to be founder,

251
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:11,759
leadership, CSM managers and the

252
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:12,300
CSMs.

253
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:14,459
Founders, most importantly, if you

254
00:06:14,459 --> 00:06:16,350
are the founder of the company and

255
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:17,839
you have like a head of client

256
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:20,470
success, you should still be on

257
00:06:20,529 --> 00:06:22,149
that call because that is the call

258
00:06:22,209 --> 00:06:23,459
where you are going to give the

259
00:06:23,459 --> 00:06:25,639
CSM team company updates.

260
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,240
What's happening with the company?

261
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,079
What are we doing?

262
00:06:28,089 --> 00:06:29,189
How are we progressing?

263
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:30,279
What are we working on?

264
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:31,139
What's coming up?

265
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:33,069
What are we transitioning in and

266
00:06:33,139 --> 00:06:33,259
out of?

267
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:34,949
What are we transitioning into?

268
00:06:34,949 --> 00:06:36,740
What are we transitioning out to?

269
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:38,199
It's important.

270
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:41,180
And that founder presence there

271
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:43,129
holds a layer of higher

272
00:06:43,189 --> 00:06:43,670
accountability.

273
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:46,089
You'll have people fucking around

274
00:06:46,389 --> 00:06:47,300
less on your calls.

275
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,839
You know, you'll have people being

276
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:50,300
very serious and taking them very

277
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,060
diligently.

278
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:54,850
So that is there to also summarize

279
00:06:54,889 --> 00:06:56,509
what's new in the company, what

280
00:06:56,509 --> 00:06:58,269
we're working on, what updates we

281
00:06:58,269 --> 00:06:59,209
have to cover.

282
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:01,149
And then you can kind of just do a

283
00:07:01,149 --> 00:07:02,500
round robin in the room of

284
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,379
individual people of like, how is

285
00:07:04,379 --> 00:07:05,170
your week?

286
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,519
What wins did you collect?

287
00:07:06,579 --> 00:07:07,610
What like any case studies

288
00:07:08,009 --> 00:07:08,839
collected, any referrals

289
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:10,129
collected, any trust pilots

290
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:10,839
collected?

291
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,019
Like what's, you know, what's

292
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:14,819
working for your clients?

293
00:07:14,819 --> 00:07:15,720
What's not working for your

294
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,000
clients?

295
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:17,560
And then we can all have an open

296
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:19,100
conversation about like what's

297
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,920
happening in that specific space.

298
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:22,529
And it's like, are other CSMs also

299
00:07:22,529 --> 00:07:23,980
running into this problem?

300
00:07:24,019 --> 00:07:25,680
So do you as a company then are

301
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,759
aware like, oh, we need to fix

302
00:07:27,819 --> 00:07:29,920
this because it's not just you and

303
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,160
this client.

304
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:32,860
It's a few other of you guys and

305
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,300
you're a few other different

306
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:34,920
clients.

307
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:36,019
So we're seeing a reoccurring

308
00:07:36,379 --> 00:07:37,410
pattern and there's something we

309
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:38,079
need to fix.

310
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,790
And that's going to fall into next

311
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:42,050
week's situation, either your team

312
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:43,519
training or a power hour or

313
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:44,920
something to address in a

314
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,220
one-to-one call.

315
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:47,930
OK, if you don't have these

316
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:50,459
patterns and rhythms and your CSMs

317
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:52,730
are not talking and learning and

318
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:54,509
having coaching and having

319
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:55,060
one-to-ones

320
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:56,600
and having team calls that are

321
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,240
effective in pushing the needle,

322
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,980
there's no pulse on the company

323
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,040
and what's happening whatsoever.

324
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,540
And you can't hand up having

325
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:05,220
yourself CSMs that are just not

326
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,910
doing their job and just kind of

327
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:08,740
chilling in the background.

328
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:11,319
So your morning focus strategy,

329
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:13,660
again, just try and get them done

330
00:08:14,189 --> 00:08:16,269
first thing in the morning.

331
00:08:16,339 --> 00:08:17,610
It just lets the guys open up

332
00:08:17,769 --> 00:08:19,199
their calendar for the day to take

333
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,360
on client meetings.

334
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,329
Not very often you'll have clients

335
00:08:23,329 --> 00:08:25,019
wanting to do a call at 9 a.m.

336
00:08:25,019 --> 00:08:25,490
in the morning.

337
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,899
Most often it's after 10 a.m.

338
00:08:27,939 --> 00:08:30,060
And again, like there's just no

339
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:30,509
harm.

340
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,689
Just get it done first thing in

341
00:08:31,689 --> 00:08:32,298
the morning.

342
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,200
It adds that.

343
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,798
It kind of kicks the day off in a

344
00:08:34,798 --> 00:08:35,759
positive way.

345
00:08:35,798 --> 00:08:37,470
So, yeah, critical client

346
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,769
meetings, team synchronization,

347
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:42,120
complex problem solving, strategic

348
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:44,500
planning, all that sort of jazz.

349
00:08:44,539 --> 00:08:46,700
And then afternoon, then they can

350
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,580
spend time on Slack messages,

351
00:08:48,669 --> 00:08:50,860
taking calls, things like that as

352
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:51,509
well.

353
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:52,620
Preparation for work.

354
00:08:52,659 --> 00:08:55,009
So, call quality management

355
00:08:55,009 --> 00:08:55,879
system.

356
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:59,110
So, I like to use Fathom for this

357
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:00,259
as well.

358
00:09:00,299 --> 00:09:02,250
But like, as the manager, you're

359
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,980
going to have to review a lot of

360
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:04,600
calls.

361
00:09:05,059 --> 00:09:06,370
And you're going to want to do

362
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:07,779
them like, you want to set up a

363
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:09,100
routine to do it and block some

364
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:10,559
time off in your calendar and

365
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:11,659
things like that.

366
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,159
But what you really want to do

367
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:14,600
there is kind of like almost

368
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,370
catching by surprise a little bit

369
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:17,080
as well.

370
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,179
So, there's always that feeling of

371
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,299
like, oh, I'm always kind of being

372
00:09:19,299 --> 00:09:19,690
watched.

373
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,120
It's not to cause any sort of

374
00:09:23,379 --> 00:09:23,879
creepiness.

375
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:24,870
It's just to let them know like,

376
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:25,580
hey, you're always being

377
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:26,220
monitored.

378
00:09:26,259 --> 00:09:27,690
So, like every call that they get

379
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,269
on then, they have the expectation

380
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:30,610
of like, I need to put in my best

381
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:31,759
performance here.

382
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:32,860
Because if this is a call that

383
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:34,370
either the founder or my manager

384
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,669
is going to check, like I want

385
00:09:35,669 --> 00:09:36,950
this one to be the one that they

386
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:37,519
check.

387
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:39,230
So, you're also going to analyze

388
00:09:39,529 --> 00:09:41,409
it for structured frameworks.

389
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:42,120
Are they doing the right

390
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:42,879
documentation?

391
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:43,870
Are they saying the right things?

392
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:45,570
Are they, you know, are they

393
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:47,340
leveraging the product and the

394
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:49,169
support that we offer clients in

395
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:51,039
the most affectionate way?

396
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,610
And then you can get them actual

397
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:53,259
feedback.

398
00:09:53,299 --> 00:09:54,960
You know, you can send them a

399
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,519
note.

400
00:09:55,559 --> 00:09:56,590
You can send them like a voice

401
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:56,960
note.

402
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,059
You can send them some notes in

403
00:09:58,399 --> 00:09:59,289
general and just be like, hey,

404
00:09:59,289 --> 00:10:00,159
review this call.

405
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,059
Send them the Fathom link.

406
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,500
I recommend you do this.

407
00:10:02,539 --> 00:10:03,600
You did this really well, but you

408
00:10:03,659 --> 00:10:04,559
didn't do that so well.

409
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,269
So, that there's constant quality

410
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,450
assessment and there's constantly

411
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:10,100
like room for improvement.

412
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,509
Because there is always room for

413
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:12,769
improvement with your CSMs.

414
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:14,539
Like, you're going to be dealing.

415
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,080
It's going to take a CSM years

416
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,750
until they're like absolutely

417
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:18,480
perfect.

418
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:19,570
They get everything absolutely

419
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:20,000
right.

420
00:10:20,139 --> 00:10:21,070
Like, there's always room to

421
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:21,429
improve.

422
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,750
So, yeah, you want to check it by,

423
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,009
like, quality, you know,

424
00:10:26,009 --> 00:10:27,580
communication quality, problem

425
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:29,289
solving, relationship management,

426
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:30,740
and process adherence.

427
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:33,129
So, these are some just kind of

428
00:10:33,129 --> 00:10:34,830
like targets here.

429
00:10:34,929 --> 00:10:36,399
Communication quality is going to

430
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:37,750
be the most important aspect of

431
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:38,080
it.

432
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,639
You need to make sure that, you

433
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,450
know, they're able to translate,

434
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:43,000
you know, complex concepts into

435
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,840
kind of like friendly language so

436
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,370
that the client can basically

437
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:48,070
simply understand what it is that

438
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:49,100
you need to do.

439
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,490
A lot of the times, they're going

440
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:52,730
to be doing a lot of problem

441
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:54,389
solving, diagnostic thinking,

442
00:10:54,389 --> 00:10:56,000
solution creativity, resource

443
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,789
utilization, and effectiveness in

444
00:10:57,789 --> 00:10:59,299
terms of addressing the client's

445
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,269
challenge.

446
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,740
Like, your clients are going to

447
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:02,600
have problems.

448
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:03,950
The CSM is there to make sure that

449
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:05,149
those problems are no longer

450
00:11:05,149 --> 00:11:05,779
problems.

451
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:06,879
That's kind of the whole point of

452
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:07,480
this shit.

453
00:11:08,059 --> 00:11:09,299
And then relationship management.

454
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:10,850
Did they do anything to build

455
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:11,399
trust?

456
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,450
Was there some rapport

457
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:13,110
established?

458
00:11:13,299 --> 00:11:14,360
Did the client seem satisfied

459
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:15,419
leaving the call?

460
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:16,759
You know, do you see like a

461
00:11:16,889 --> 00:11:18,320
long-term like relationship

462
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,460
developing here?

463
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,879
That's really another aspect.

464
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:23,500
And then just process adherence.

465
00:11:23,539 --> 00:11:25,000
Just making sure, you know,

466
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,799
documentation was complete, that

467
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:28,419
they left notes, or they did take

468
00:11:28,779 --> 00:11:30,220
notes, or that there's like, you

469
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:32,289
know, you know, you've marked down

470
00:11:32,289 --> 00:11:33,600
like what you need to get done

471
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:35,210
this week or what they need to get

472
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:36,240
done next week.

473
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:37,340
Or if it was a monthly check-in

474
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:38,580
call, what they did that month,

475
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:39,940
what's the goal for next month.

476
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,740
Like, you just want to make sure

477
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,509
that it's, you know, everything's

478
00:11:43,509 --> 00:11:45,100
up to scratch, and it wasn't just

479
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,460
a call, and that there was no

480
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:47,960
follow-up or handover after the

481
00:11:48,009 --> 00:11:49,570
call, so then the client doesn't

482
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,220
go, wait, what did so-and-so say

483
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,049
to me?

484
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,179
What was my next step?

485
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,340
What do I have to do?

486
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,100
Like, and, you know, you can just

487
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,700
quality check it from there.

488
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:00,669
CSM types, again, you know this

489
00:12:00,669 --> 00:12:01,779
already.

490
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,360
Like, high-touch CSMs, they should

491
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,120
be doing 15 to 25 calls a week.

492
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:08,610
Mid-touch CSMs are looking at 10

493
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:09,720
to 15 calls a week.

494
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,179
Low-touch-point CSMs are only

495
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:12,629
going to do about 5 to 10 calls a

496
00:12:12,629 --> 00:12:13,059
week.

497
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,159
Those calls are going to go, like,

498
00:12:15,159 --> 00:12:16,539
smaller and sooner.

499
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:17,500
Mid-touch clients are going to be

500
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,580
about 20 to 30 minutes.

501
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:20,080
High-touch-point CSMs are going to

502
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,730
be doing about 30 to 45-minute

503
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:22,159
calls.

504
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,840
Unless it's an onboarding call,

505
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,220
depending on the product and

506
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:26,740
service, your onboarding calls can

507
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,100
range anywhere between 30 minutes

508
00:12:28,179 --> 00:12:29,460
to an hour, in some cases, even an

509
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:30,149
hour and a half.

510
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,960
So, you know, and you have a

511
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,070
certain quality target for those

512
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:36,840
calls, really nothing below 80%.

513
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:37,889
Like, no one should be doing

514
00:12:37,889 --> 00:12:39,179
anything that's just 80%.

515
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:41,289
Like, an 8 out of 10 below that in

516
00:12:41,289 --> 00:12:42,539
terms of quality calls is kind of

517
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:43,600
a waste of time for everyone

518
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:44,539
across the board.

519
00:12:45,779 --> 00:12:46,379
So, yeah.

520
00:12:46,419 --> 00:12:48,090
Daily performance tracking systems

521
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:48,990
as well.

522
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:50,700
End-of-day type form protocols.

523
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,480
Like, you need to implement, like,

524
00:12:52,649 --> 00:12:53,960
an end-of-day type form.

525
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,669
It only takes, like, five minutes

526
00:12:55,789 --> 00:12:56,480
to complete.

527
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:57,580
It's not that long.

528
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,389
Make sure you also, to avoid

529
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:01,899
missed end-of-day type forms,

530
00:13:01,899 --> 00:13:04,399
don't send it out at 5 p.m.

531
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,220
on the dot when they finish their

532
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:06,679
day.

533
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,250
Like, they're going to miss doing

534
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:08,500
it.

535
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:10,230
Send it to them at, like, 4

536
00:13:10,509 --> 00:13:11,129
o'clock.

537
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:12,860
Ideally, their last hour before

538
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:13,909
their day finishes.

539
00:13:14,019 --> 00:13:15,080
So that they just do the

540
00:13:15,139 --> 00:13:16,590
end-of-day type form and they

541
00:13:16,789 --> 00:13:18,519
complete their last hour of work.

542
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:19,830
You know, because otherwise,

543
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:21,019
they're going to forget.

544
00:13:21,059 --> 00:13:22,720
And, you know, so you want to ask

545
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:24,230
them, like, what did you

546
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:25,480
accomplish today?

547
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:26,669
Which clients need immediate

548
00:13:27,049 --> 00:13:27,929
attention or follow-up?

549
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,429
Did you collect any case studies,

550
00:13:29,429 --> 00:13:30,970
trust pilot reviews, or referrals

551
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:31,460
today?

552
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,789
What challenges did you face with

553
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,320
your work or with clients today?

554
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,789
You know, what process could we

555
00:13:35,789 --> 00:13:36,929
improve based on today's

556
00:13:36,929 --> 00:13:37,700
experience?

557
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:38,799
What are your top three priorities

558
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:39,659
for tomorrow?

559
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,759
Or pretty much, what's your entire

560
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:43,100
plan for tomorrow?

561
00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:44,200
Like, what calls are you taking?

562
00:13:44,259 --> 00:13:45,320
Whose clients are you meeting?

563
00:13:45,419 --> 00:13:46,679
Things like that, too.

564
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,960
And, you know, response analysis.

565
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,659
So, like, daily review, you know,

566
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:52,360
for yourself, the founder, or the

567
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:53,879
head CSM, you want to review all

568
00:13:53,879 --> 00:13:55,019
the submissions,

569
00:13:55,299 --> 00:13:56,590
flagging urgent client details,

570
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:57,820
you know, so you can start all

571
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:59,490
having communication about certain

572
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:00,399
things that are happening.

573
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,480
You're just in the know of what's

574
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,480
happening in the company.

575
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:03,580
Like, there's intervention

576
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:04,820
planning as well.

577
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,100
So you can start seeing if there

578
00:14:06,269 --> 00:14:07,419
isn't CSM particularly that's

579
00:14:07,419 --> 00:14:08,200
having issues.

580
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,299
They can see the additional

581
00:14:09,669 --> 00:14:10,539
support that they need.

582
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:11,559
You can give them some coaching

583
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,000
advice.

584
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:13,080
You can see their response.

585
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,789
And you can just basically help

586
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:16,490
them before, you know, this

587
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:18,289
problem starts spiraling out of

588
00:14:18,529 --> 00:14:19,019
control.

589
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,750
And then, you know, weekly pattern

590
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:21,600
analysis.

591
00:14:21,639 --> 00:14:23,159
You can start compiling insights.

592
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,259
You can start tracking all of this

593
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:24,700
data.

594
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,269
You can start seeing, like, what

595
00:14:26,409 --> 00:14:27,389
problems are occurring.

596
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,389
What's the stress point?

597
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:29,950
Do we need to give extra resources

598
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:31,309
or extra support here to these

599
00:14:31,309 --> 00:14:33,000
clients for, like, a specific area

600
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:33,960
in the business?

601
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,059
And then there's, like, a process

602
00:14:35,419 --> 00:14:35,919
refinement.

603
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,379
Again, just like what I mentioned,

604
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:38,529
like, daily visibility creates

605
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:39,590
accountability.

606
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:40,799
And when CSMs know they'll be

607
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:42,210
reporting on specific actions each

608
00:14:42,409 --> 00:14:43,980
day, they'll naturally prioritize

609
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,289
high-impact activities and

610
00:14:45,289 --> 00:14:47,029
client-focused outcomes.

611
00:14:47,559 --> 00:14:48,929
So this is why it's also very,

612
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,129
very important as well.

613
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,049
So auditing your CSMs.

614
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,179
Another thing you want to do, the

615
00:14:56,179 --> 00:14:58,460
day your CSMs do their check-ins,

616
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:00,090
ideally, like I've mentioned

617
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:01,629
before, they'd, like, do Monday,

618
00:15:01,629 --> 00:15:02,639
Wednesday, and Friday.

619
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:03,840
They should be checking in on

620
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,039
Mondays so that they set up a game

621
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:05,970
plan for the clients.

622
00:15:06,059 --> 00:15:06,990
They should be checking on a

623
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:08,110
Wednesday so they can see how's

624
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:09,389
everything going halfway through

625
00:15:09,389 --> 00:15:09,919
the week.

626
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:10,990
And then Friday, do you kind of

627
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:12,139
want to get an end-of-week kind of

628
00:15:12,139 --> 00:15:13,320
wrap-up of, like, how things are

629
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,200
currently going?

630
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,470
Here, you also, this is the days

631
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:19,539
you also want to do your audits of

632
00:15:19,539 --> 00:15:20,240
the CSMs.

633
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,899
You want to go through, like, all

634
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:23,429
the communication channels to make

635
00:15:23,429 --> 00:15:24,889
sure, like, did you message your

636
00:15:24,889 --> 00:15:25,720
client today?

637
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:27,169
Did you see if everything was

638
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:27,429
okay?

639
00:15:27,659 --> 00:15:29,299
Was the response good?

640
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:30,289
Like, were you helpful?

641
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,649
Was it a standard check-in of,

642
00:15:31,789 --> 00:15:33,320
like, hey, how's your day going?

643
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,419
Because that's not fucking useful

644
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:34,980
to anyone.

645
00:15:35,019 --> 00:15:36,080
Or was it, hey, how are you

646
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,750
currently getting on with, like,

647
00:15:37,789 --> 00:15:38,750
creating your VSL?

648
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:39,919
Or, hey, did you make that landing

649
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:40,419
page yet?

650
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:41,509
Or, hey, how did I call the email

651
00:15:41,509 --> 00:15:41,899
launch?

652
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:42,990
Like, that's a client extension

653
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,320
example, but I'm just throwing one

654
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,259
out for the fuck of it.

655
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:46,490
Like, you want to actually add

656
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,799
something that's, like, why were

657
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,309
they actually working on it?

658
00:15:49,379 --> 00:15:50,440
That was part of the plan and the

659
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:51,620
process and the implementation

660
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:52,720
that you're trying to drive and

661
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:53,120
adopt.

662
00:15:53,179 --> 00:15:56,059
So, and did the client reply, but

663
00:15:56,059 --> 00:15:58,059
the CSM didn't reply?

664
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:59,580
Why is the CSM replying?

665
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:01,179
You know, and how long was the

666
00:16:01,179 --> 00:16:03,039
client waiting for the reply after

667
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:03,500
CSM?

668
00:16:03,539 --> 00:16:04,809
You know, you want to check, like,

669
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:05,889
you know, response times and

670
00:16:05,889 --> 00:16:06,940
things like that, too.

671
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:08,200
So, you need to audit all of this

672
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:08,639
as well.

673
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,179
And then also, like, on those days

674
00:16:10,179 --> 00:16:11,679
as well, you really want to audit,

675
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:12,759
like, Stripe billing.

676
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:14,769
Like, did your CSM message clients

677
00:16:14,769 --> 00:16:15,929
who missed or are late for a

678
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:16,559
payment?

679
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,110
Is there any clients who have not

680
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:20,039
been billed in the past 30 days?

681
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,340
And it's like, wait, has this

682
00:16:21,509 --> 00:16:22,480
person had a back-end sales

683
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:23,340
conversation?

684
00:16:23,379 --> 00:16:24,440
Have this person not renewed?

685
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:25,639
Like, are we doing free work for

686
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:26,480
this individual?

687
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:28,120
And they haven't even paid yet?

688
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,059
Like, what's going on?

689
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,409
You want to, like, check, you

690
00:16:30,529 --> 00:16:31,620
know, communications.

691
00:16:31,659 --> 00:16:33,220
Then you also want to check Stripe

692
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:34,779
and making sure all the payments

693
00:16:34,779 --> 00:16:36,039
are in place and that there's no

694
00:16:36,039 --> 00:16:37,090
failed payments and things like

695
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:37,399
that.

696
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,549
Because your CSMs are responsible

697
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:39,960
for collecting payments, too.

698
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,570
Then another thing you're going to

699
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:44,879
have your CSMs do is a bi-weekly

700
00:16:45,409 --> 00:16:47,340
health score assessment.

701
00:16:47,379 --> 00:16:49,529
This is going to be basically,

702
00:16:49,529 --> 00:16:51,340
like, you can...

703
00:16:51,379 --> 00:16:53,039
I like to do this on the Mondays

704
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:54,899
on a bi-weekly basis, which is

705
00:16:54,899 --> 00:16:56,259
really, really helpful because

706
00:16:56,259 --> 00:16:57,639
it's, like...

707
00:16:57,679 --> 00:16:58,740
So, just to give you an inside

708
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:00,250
look at how I do my structure.

709
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:02,480
So, the first Monday of the month,

710
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,789
my team are going to do a health

711
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:04,619
score sheet.

712
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:06,328
When they do the health score

713
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,559
sheet, then, and it's complete,

714
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:09,960
they bring that with them on their

715
00:17:10,068 --> 00:17:10,838
Tuesday one-to-one.

716
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,818
And we break down their health

717
00:17:11,859 --> 00:17:12,940
score sheet of how their clients

718
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:13,859
are currently doing.

719
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,410
The second week, when they don't

720
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:16,900
have to do a health score sheet,

721
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,390
that Monday, I actually really

722
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:19,640
like to review calls.

723
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,318
So, then I can bring that call

724
00:17:21,318 --> 00:17:22,900
with me to that meeting.

725
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,119
And then we can have a proactive,

726
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:25,338
instructive conversation of how

727
00:17:25,338 --> 00:17:26,539
they can improve that call.

728
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:28,250
But also, then, hey, your health

729
00:17:28,599 --> 00:17:30,130
score sheet, what's the difference

730
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:31,460
in this week than last week?

731
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:32,799
Like, how did we drive?

732
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:33,829
Did you take the advice?

733
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,920
Did you adopt the product?

734
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:35,980
Did you help them improve?

735
00:17:36,019 --> 00:17:37,500
Like, how do we make that work?

736
00:17:37,539 --> 00:17:38,710
Because the next week, they're

737
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:39,900
going to have to do their health

738
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:40,559
score sheet.

739
00:17:40,619 --> 00:17:41,779
And if shit hasn't improved, then

740
00:17:41,779 --> 00:17:43,079
we're going to have a problem.

741
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:45,690
So, it works really, really well,

742
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:46,799
you know.

743
00:17:46,839 --> 00:17:47,789
So, health score sheets must be

744
00:17:47,809 --> 00:17:48,509
completed the night before

745
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:49,859
one-to-ones with management.

746
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:52,450
I know it's a submission by 12

747
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:53,440
o'clock.

748
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,480
I don't really give a shit to get

749
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,640
it done that morning, to be honest

750
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,049
with you.

751
00:17:56,119 --> 00:17:57,180
As long as it's done before the

752
00:17:57,539 --> 00:17:58,690
meeting, that's fucking fine.

753
00:17:58,759 --> 00:17:59,819
Like, they need to just be able to

754
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,400
have it done.

755
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,759
You know, full client company

756
00:18:02,779 --> 00:18:04,859
name, who their SSE is.

757
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:05,740
Again, if it's your team, you're

758
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:06,380
just going to do it.

759
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:07,349
If you're a client, I'm going to

760
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:08,039
be able to see it.

761
00:18:08,079 --> 00:18:09,109
Like, what service and package are

762
00:18:09,109 --> 00:18:09,480
they on?

763
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:10,519
What's their contract value?

764
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,220
Like, you know, was it, like, how

765
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,710
many months they've left or how

766
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:14,480
many days left they have to

767
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:14,880
program?

768
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:15,980
Stage classification.

769
00:18:16,099 --> 00:18:17,920
Are they on pre-launch, launch, or

770
00:18:18,109 --> 00:18:18,670
post-launch?

771
00:18:18,819 --> 00:18:20,490
You know, like, where are they

772
00:18:20,839 --> 00:18:22,200
currently at in terms of, you

773
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,700
know, the service communication

774
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:24,720
assessment?

775
00:18:24,819 --> 00:18:25,880
Like, when did you last have a

776
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,480
call with them?

777
00:18:26,619 --> 00:18:27,859
Are they active on Slack?

778
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,180
You know, like, what's the level

779
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:31,710
of engagement here?

780
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:33,950
Are you proactive or reactive to

781
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:35,059
this client?

782
00:18:35,109 --> 00:18:36,380
Performance metrics.

783
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:37,609
Like, what's their latest ROI?

784
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:39,200
What's their implementation status

785
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:39,900
percentage?

786
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:41,220
And what's their goal progress?

787
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,839
Like, where are they?

788
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:43,829
Like, how are they doing?

789
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:44,940
Like, it depends on the business

790
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:45,549
and the service.

791
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:46,589
But, like, if you're in the

792
00:18:46,589 --> 00:18:47,589
business of helping people make

793
00:18:47,769 --> 00:18:48,769
money, how much money should we

794
00:18:48,769 --> 00:18:49,619
have we help them make?

795
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:50,680
If you're in the business of

796
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,789
helping people, like, fix

797
00:18:51,789 --> 00:18:53,170
operations and save time, how much

798
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:54,500
time are we saving them here?

799
00:18:54,539 --> 00:18:55,839
If it's, you know, so it just

800
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:57,109
depends on the business.

801
00:18:57,259 --> 00:18:58,930
And then the SS, your CSM needs to

802
00:18:59,269 --> 00:19:00,880
then give, like, a health score

803
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,910
sheet, like, a health score rating

804
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:04,259
out of 1 to 10.

805
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:07,480
One is, like, they haven't done

806
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,359
jack shit.

807
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,980
Like, this is the worst client

808
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:10,460
ever.

809
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,079
They're lazy.

810
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:12,069
They're not doing anything.

811
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:14,380
Like, they're going to fail.

812
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:16,079
Like, this person's bad.

813
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,680
Two, not far off.

814
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,359
Three, four.

815
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,779
Like, if any client is a four,

816
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:21,420
they should be marked in the red.

817
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,170
That's critical.

818
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,880
Like, they're a critical risk.

819
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,890
This person, we need to turn this

820
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:27,400
around very quickly.

821
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,099
Either we need to do everything we

822
00:19:29,099 --> 00:19:30,750
possibly can in our power so that

823
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,400
we can uphold our reputation as a

824
00:19:32,829 --> 00:19:33,119
company.

825
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:34,789
Or we need to have a serious,

826
00:19:35,029 --> 00:19:36,170
honest, hard conversation with

827
00:19:36,369 --> 00:19:37,640
that client and, like, why they

828
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,069
are not doing and working as hard

829
00:19:39,069 --> 00:19:40,400
as they possibly should.

830
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,430
Orange is basically your middle of

831
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:43,009
the road.

832
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,470
You're not doing bad, but you're

833
00:19:44,609 --> 00:19:45,279
not doing great.

834
00:19:45,319 --> 00:19:46,380
You're just fine.

835
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:47,720
And it's, like, cool.

836
00:19:47,799 --> 00:19:49,460
We're not in a bad spot, but we

837
00:19:49,809 --> 00:19:51,839
have definitely room for improve.

838
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,779
And we have an area here where we

839
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:56,029
need to, like, increase, like,

840
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:58,059
communication and strategy.

841
00:19:58,119 --> 00:19:59,609
And we need to turn things around

842
00:19:59,609 --> 00:20:01,140
quickly before they do go into the

843
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:01,619
red.

844
00:20:01,779 --> 00:20:03,279
And then green is, like, healthy.

845
00:20:03,319 --> 00:20:04,740
And then you want to also, like,

846
00:20:04,759 --> 00:20:06,420
in these notes, too, leave, like,

847
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:07,450
strategic notes.

848
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,880
Current challenges, opportunities,

849
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:10,049
required actions, next steps,

850
00:20:10,049 --> 00:20:11,039
issues for leadership.

851
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:12,470
This is your notes that you want

852
00:20:12,519 --> 00:20:13,789
to give to either your head of

853
00:20:13,849 --> 00:20:15,279
client success or the founder of

854
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:16,569
the company so they can kind of

855
00:20:16,759 --> 00:20:17,900
get a bit of a, like, a deeper

856
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,359
insight of, like, what's the

857
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:20,420
situation there with these

858
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:21,140
clients?

859
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:23,250
Non-responsive clients,

860
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:25,339
significant missed deadlines and

861
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,509
implementation gaps, expressed

862
00:20:27,579 --> 00:20:29,519
dissatisfaction, escalation

863
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:31,509
concerns, declining business

864
00:20:31,509 --> 00:20:32,930
metrics, or ROI.

865
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:34,640
Inconsistent communication, some

866
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,119
miscommunicates, like, some

867
00:20:36,119 --> 00:20:37,140
miscommitments.

868
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:38,470
Mixed results, both success and

869
00:20:38,609 --> 00:20:40,039
having some challenges, requires

870
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:41,180
attention and support.

871
00:20:42,039 --> 00:20:43,099
Consistive proactive

872
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:44,609
communication, meaning or

873
00:20:44,809 --> 00:20:46,029
exceeding implementation

874
00:20:46,029 --> 00:20:47,859
timelines, positive ROI, strong

875
00:20:47,859 --> 00:20:49,519
relationship and satisfaction

876
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:50,500
indications.

877
00:20:50,539 --> 00:20:52,200
That's how you scale it.

878
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,339
It's not really that difficult.

879
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:56,049
You just need to be very, very

880
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,009
honest about, like, what the

881
00:20:58,009 --> 00:21:00,079
standards of the company are.

882
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,109
And that's where you, the manager,

883
00:21:02,279 --> 00:21:03,880
need to set those standards of,

884
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:05,650
like, what is good and what is not

885
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:06,259
good.

886
00:21:06,299 --> 00:21:07,970
When you're doing these health

887
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:09,759
score sheets, you should be

888
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:11,660
holding the CSMs accountable to

889
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:13,400
why this person is green.

890
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,099
Tell me why they should be in the

891
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:15,750
green.

892
00:21:15,819 --> 00:21:17,480
What results are they bringing in

893
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:19,109
that is such an amazing ROI that

894
00:21:19,109 --> 00:21:20,700
we should be reaching out to them

895
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:22,349
for, like, a case study, for

896
00:21:22,359 --> 00:21:23,119
example.

897
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,819
And then what puts someone in

898
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:25,640
orange?

899
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,339
Which, like, because if they're in

900
00:21:27,339 --> 00:21:28,779
the orange, their most likely

901
00:21:28,779 --> 00:21:30,200
could be as well in the red.

902
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,490
You need to investigate these and

903
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:32,680
you need to troubleshoot all of

904
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,849
these sort of situations.

905
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:34,839
So when you're in your

906
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,690
one-to-ones, then, your first five

907
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:38,539
minutes health score overview.

908
00:21:38,579 --> 00:21:39,640
You just kind of want to review

909
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:41,140
this portfolio and identify the

910
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:42,619
red flags and the opportunities.

911
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:43,910
Then you want to start going

912
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:45,329
through your red and orange

913
00:21:45,529 --> 00:21:46,039
clients.

914
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:47,339
You want to deep dive this

915
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,390
significantly.

916
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,109
What's the root cause?

917
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,440
What can we develop?

918
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,140
What intervention strategies can

919
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:54,049
we apply here?

920
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,779
Then you want to go through the

921
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:57,099
clients that are in the green.

922
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:58,809
Because there's expansion

923
00:21:58,809 --> 00:22:00,230
planning, case study

924
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:02,019
identification, best practice

925
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:03,359
extraction.

926
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,640
We can take something like, what

927
00:22:04,779 --> 00:22:05,920
are these clients doing that's so

928
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,200
well that we can start teaching to

929
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,160
the other clients.

930
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,759
And then also, your clients that

931
00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:11,220
are in the green are the clients

932
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:12,759
that are most likely to give you a

933
00:22:12,769 --> 00:22:13,500
referral.

934
00:22:13,539 --> 00:22:14,730
They're the clients that are most

935
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:15,839
likely to jump on a client case

936
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,710
study interview.

937
00:22:16,759 --> 00:22:18,240
They're the clients that are most

938
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,329
likely going to stay.

939
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:21,319
So it's like, okay, what back-end

940
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,039
strategy are we going to do?

941
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:24,720
What feature or service or product

942
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,250
that we have that they don't have

943
00:22:26,299 --> 00:22:27,960
that they could use at this point?

944
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,869
Like, how can we benefit them

945
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:30,680
more?

946
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,390
What package do we want to sell

947
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:34,170
them on to retain them so that we

948
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:36,000
can add even more value to them?

949
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,859
So they get an even bigger ROI and

950
00:22:38,069 --> 00:22:39,509
it's an even more successful

951
00:22:39,509 --> 00:22:41,039
working relationship.

952
00:22:41,079 --> 00:22:42,140
That's what you want to get

953
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:43,589
through when you're going through

954
00:22:43,589 --> 00:22:44,819
your health score sheets.

955
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,369
And that's why it's important to

956
00:22:46,369 --> 00:22:47,750
have them done before you're

957
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:48,609
one-to-ones.

958
00:22:49,259 --> 00:22:50,180
Otherwise, you're going to have

959
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:51,150
one-to-one calls with the guys and

960
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:52,210
it's going to be like, hey, what's

961
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:52,839
the hell's your week?

962
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,440
And it's like, it's good.

963
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,099
It's like, is it?

964
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:54,700
Okay, cool.

965
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,109
And it's like a fucking waste of

966
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:56,400
time.

967
00:22:56,579 --> 00:22:58,599
So you need to, this is really,

968
00:22:58,599 --> 00:23:00,059
really important.

969
00:23:00,099 --> 00:23:01,500
I cannot stress this enough.

970
00:23:01,539 --> 00:23:03,480
Power Hour Meeting Framework,

971
00:23:03,559 --> 00:23:05,740
again, simple things like that.

972
00:23:05,799 --> 00:23:06,589
First couple of minutes, just

973
00:23:06,589 --> 00:23:07,440
figure out like what you guys are

974
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,369
going to be covering this week.

975
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,650
The manager or the founder on the

976
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:10,779
call should have an idea of what

977
00:23:10,819 --> 00:23:11,940
you're going to be doing.

978
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:13,559
It can be a churn, reactivation

979
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:15,500
campaign, trust pilot collection,

980
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,849
health score updates.

981
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,460
And then you want to re-engage

982
00:23:18,519 --> 00:23:19,950
like, you know, some clients that

983
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:21,119
are just like inactive or like

984
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:22,069
slow to response.

985
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,160
And then you just want to use the

986
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,079
last five minutes to kind of

987
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:25,309
click, collect feedback, track

988
00:23:25,309 --> 00:23:26,500
numbers and share a document or

989
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,480
something like that.

990
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:29,019
You know, personally, I like to

991
00:23:29,019 --> 00:23:30,349
just drop my notes in my Slack

992
00:23:30,349 --> 00:23:31,940
channel where all my CSMs are.

993
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:34,549
Task Execution Sprint.

994
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:36,119
Yeah, that's pretty much this.

995
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:36,980
I pretty much went.

996
00:23:37,019 --> 00:23:38,079
The Power Hour comes from its

997
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:38,690
consistency.

998
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,789
When the team knows every Monday

999
00:23:39,789 --> 00:23:40,299
at 9 a.m.

1000
00:23:40,339 --> 00:23:41,180
They'll focus on specific

1001
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:42,180
operational priorities.

1002
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:43,890
These activities become habitual

1003
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,119
rather than occasional, which is

1004
00:23:46,119 --> 00:23:46,660
true.

1005
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,599
Like if you train your CSMs on

1006
00:23:48,599 --> 00:23:50,559
like on this, that they have to do

1007
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:52,759
this on a regular basis, it kind

1008
00:23:52,759 --> 00:23:54,170
of also falls into like, you know,

1009
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:55,089
secondhand nature.

1010
00:23:56,839 --> 00:23:58,400
So, yeah, doing this, you're going

1011
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,759
to have more tasks complete.

1012
00:23:59,799 --> 00:24:00,460
You're going to have more team

1013
00:24:00,569 --> 00:24:00,950
engagement.

1014
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:01,900
There's going to be more

1015
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,130
efficiency and you're going to

1016
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:04,500
like generate way more reviews and

1017
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,319
testimonials.

1018
00:24:05,359 --> 00:24:06,880
So, Power Hour is like nothing to

1019
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,839
be slept on here.

1020
00:24:09,029 --> 00:24:10,690
Individual CSM development then.

1021
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,380
This is just for their, like your

1022
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:13,970
personal one-to-ones there, you

1023
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:15,470
know, call quality feedback,

1024
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:16,910
client satisfaction, scored

1025
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:18,750
feedback, goal progress, challenge

1026
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:20,180
identification, specific

1027
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:21,630
improvement areas, role-playing

1028
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:22,549
scenarios, resource

1029
00:24:22,549 --> 00:24:24,000
recommendations and learnings that

1030
00:24:24,109 --> 00:24:25,019
you can recommend to them

1031
00:24:25,069 --> 00:24:25,900
specifically.

1032
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:27,599
Industry knowledge and competitive

1033
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:28,160
updates.

1034
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:29,599
Again, you're the founder, you're

1035
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:30,670
the manager, you should know

1036
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:31,809
what's going on more than anyone

1037
00:24:31,809 --> 00:24:32,220
else.

1038
00:24:32,259 --> 00:24:33,319
You know what's also happening

1039
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:35,180
across all the other CSM teams so

1040
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:36,690
that you can give that insight to

1041
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:37,500
these guys.

1042
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:38,920
And then kind of like career

1043
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:40,200
growth and opportunities, maybe

1044
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,509
let them know like, hey, you know,

1045
00:24:41,509 --> 00:24:42,670
you can get some more referrals or

1046
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:43,789
you upset all these clients,

1047
00:24:43,789 --> 00:24:44,819
you're going to make some more

1048
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,390
money.

1049
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:47,119
Process improvement, suggestion,

1050
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,980
implementation, team contribution,

1051
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:50,259
leadership potential.

1052
00:24:50,299 --> 00:24:51,759
And then next week's kind of like,

1053
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:53,309
you know, your priorities and like

1054
00:24:53,309 --> 00:24:54,339
you're what we consider a

1055
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,799
successful week given what that

1056
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:56,980
criteria looks like.

1057
00:24:57,019 --> 00:24:58,690
Your team development and training

1058
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:01,180
calls, communication excellence.

1059
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:02,000
So, you can talk about how to

1060
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:02,880
communicate with clients.

1061
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:03,859
You can break down one of the

1062
00:25:03,859 --> 00:25:04,539
guys' clients.

1063
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:06,220
If one of the CSMs had like a

1064
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:07,730
really amazing call, you can do

1065
00:25:07,809 --> 00:25:08,180
that.

1066
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:09,279
And sometimes, actually, if I have

1067
00:25:09,339 --> 00:25:10,309
a team training and I've really

1068
00:25:10,309 --> 00:25:11,630
nothing planned for whatsoever, I

1069
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:12,980
like to just jump on FASM and take

1070
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,309
a random call and say, boys, we're

1071
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:15,140
going to watch this and we're all

1072
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:15,940
going to review it together.

1073
00:25:16,019 --> 00:25:16,829
That's a really good

1074
00:25:16,829 --> 00:25:18,450
accountability metric, by the way,

1075
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:19,970
because someone kind of goes, oh,

1076
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:21,519
shit, my call is getting picked.

1077
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,700
And I don't know if I did this

1078
00:25:22,759 --> 00:25:24,099
call right or wrong or what's the

1079
00:25:24,099 --> 00:25:25,109
feedback, but it's all

1080
00:25:25,109 --> 00:25:26,480
constructive because we're all

1081
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,859
learning from each other.

1082
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,710
You know, you can also do like

1083
00:25:30,819 --> 00:25:32,369
strategic business analysis, you

1084
00:25:32,369 --> 00:25:33,950
know, work on ROI calculators and

1085
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:35,259
things like that, too.

1086
00:25:35,299 --> 00:25:36,599
And you can work on like

1087
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,299
technology processes.

1088
00:25:38,339 --> 00:25:39,529
We can work on like updates,

1089
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:41,259
dashboards, whatever it might be.

1090
00:25:41,299 --> 00:25:42,349
And then revenue generation

1091
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:42,960
machines.

1092
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:44,099
Also, with like the team training

1093
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,339
and development, sometimes I

1094
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:46,529
actually really like to do a book

1095
00:25:46,529 --> 00:25:47,710
club with some of the guys.

1096
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:49,940
We have a massive section, I have

1097
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:51,440
a module that I'll be developing

1098
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,470
in this section called

1099
00:25:52,549 --> 00:25:54,200
Unreasonable Hospitality, based

1100
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,410
off the book Unreasonable

1101
00:25:55,410 --> 00:25:56,859
Hospitality, because it is

1102
00:25:56,859 --> 00:25:58,140
actually one of the most important

1103
00:25:58,170 --> 00:25:59,079
books to client success

1104
00:25:59,099 --> 00:25:59,759
management.

1105
00:25:59,799 --> 00:26:00,859
But that's a whole separate

1106
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:01,460
module.

1107
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:03,529
Career progression frameworks and

1108
00:26:03,619 --> 00:26:05,480
things like that, junior CSMs.

1109
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:07,819
You're considered a junior CSM

1110
00:26:07,859 --> 00:26:10,019
within their first year.

1111
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,539
Your senior CSM is going to be

1112
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,880
around 12 to 24 months.

1113
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,289
And then you're like a lead CSM

1114
00:26:16,349 --> 00:26:17,490
or, you know, like a really

1115
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:18,880
advanced CSM is going to be

1116
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,369
someone past like two years and

1117
00:26:20,369 --> 00:26:21,500
things like that.

1118
00:26:21,539 --> 00:26:22,690
You know, this person can mentor

1119
00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:24,069
teams and you can like hand over a

1120
00:26:24,069 --> 00:26:25,400
lot of leadership abilities.

1121
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,990
Senior CSM is going to be like,

1122
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:28,460
you know, really strategic

1123
00:26:28,519 --> 00:26:30,309
thinking, like a real go-getter,

1124
00:26:30,309 --> 00:26:32,160
very good, solid portfolio, like

1125
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,079
showed proper revenue growth.

1126
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,450
So, yeah, there's just some

1127
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:37,660
metrics there for you just to kind

1128
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:38,460
of get a little bit of an

1129
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:39,480
understanding of like what I

1130
00:26:39,579 --> 00:26:40,769
consider a junior, a senior, and a

1131
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:41,299
lead.

1132
00:26:41,339 --> 00:26:43,009
And that way, the responsibilities

1133
00:26:43,349 --> 00:26:44,630
and the interactions and the

1134
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:46,200
communication and the style of

1135
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,829
your management can then change

1136
00:26:47,829 --> 00:26:48,619
over time.

1137
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:50,170
Because as someone is more in that

1138
00:26:50,170 --> 00:26:51,680
senior position who's been in the

1139
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:53,460
role for like two years, you know

1140
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:55,319
then they're going to be pretty

1141
00:26:55,319 --> 00:26:56,519
rock solid then.

1142
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:58,079
And you can actually then start

1143
00:26:58,079 --> 00:26:59,700
using that CSM to get more kind of

1144
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,230
like SOPs kind of build out.

1145
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:02,269
And you can kind of give them more

1146
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:03,349
higher leverage tasks and things

1147
00:27:03,349 --> 00:27:03,890
like that.

1148
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:06,859
Performance monitoring, KPIs and

1149
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:08,039
things like that.

1150
00:27:08,079 --> 00:27:10,220
Client retention, you always want

1151
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:12,279
to target like, again, this is,

1152
00:27:12,309 --> 00:27:14,470
these targets, these numbers here

1153
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:16,410
are a very generalized business

1154
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:18,859
kind of, you know, projections.

1155
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:20,359
It's very hard to like, you know,

1156
00:27:20,359 --> 00:27:21,779
do it in very specific fields and

1157
00:27:21,779 --> 00:27:22,839
things like that.

1158
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,309
So, this is just a very generic

1159
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:25,900
like, hey, aim for the fucking,

1160
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,369
aim for the stars if you land on

1161
00:27:27,369 --> 00:27:28,099
the moon.

1162
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:28,519
Amazing.

1163
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:29,859
So, yeah, client retention rate.

1164
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:31,609
It should be about 75%.

1165
00:27:31,779 --> 00:27:33,440
You'd like to retain 75% of your

1166
00:27:33,799 --> 00:27:34,140
clients.

1167
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:35,490
It's like, you know, you don't

1168
00:27:35,609 --> 00:27:36,750
want to be losing more than really

1169
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:37,339
that.

1170
00:27:38,859 --> 00:27:40,289
You know, and like, and by the

1171
00:27:40,299 --> 00:27:41,880
way, client retention is kind of

1172
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,059
different to churn.

1173
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:45,170
Churn is kind of like, you know,

1174
00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:46,970
to a certain degree, people

1175
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:49,019
leaving after like past due.

1176
00:27:49,059 --> 00:27:50,519
So, if you have an offer, for

1177
00:27:50,519 --> 00:27:52,200
example, where it's like, like

1178
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,119
email marketing, for example, it's

1179
00:27:54,119 --> 00:27:55,960
like, we'll add $50,000 revenue in

1180
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:56,640
90 days.

1181
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:57,869
Like, if you hit that goal and the

1182
00:27:58,150 --> 00:27:59,170
client just still doesn't stay on,

1183
00:27:59,170 --> 00:28:00,349
I mean, like, you know, you can

1184
00:28:00,349 --> 00:28:01,609
look into certain factors.

1185
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:03,329
But if that client leaves like 30

1186
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,299
days in, that's like, you know,

1187
00:28:05,309 --> 00:28:07,029
like, that's how you really want

1188
00:28:07,069 --> 00:28:08,609
to like, you know, check in on

1189
00:28:08,609 --> 00:28:10,089
like your churn and be like,

1190
00:28:10,089 --> 00:28:11,849
right, that was a, that was a real

1191
00:28:11,849 --> 00:28:13,119
fuck up on our end.

1192
00:28:13,259 --> 00:28:14,160
Like, what went wrong there?

1193
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,859
But yes, client retention, you

1194
00:28:16,210 --> 00:28:17,940
want to aim it to be about 75%.

1195
00:28:18,019 --> 00:28:19,079
You know, your net revenue

1196
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:20,430
retention about 80%.

1197
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,539
Your average client health score

1198
00:28:21,589 --> 00:28:22,339
is about eight.

1199
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:24,950
Your NPS score plus 70.

1200
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:26,759
You know, your CSM activity is

1201
00:28:26,759 --> 00:28:28,519
like, they should be completing

1202
00:28:28,519 --> 00:28:30,039
95% of their calls.

1203
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:31,640
Documentation quality should be at

1204
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,650
least over 90%.

1205
00:28:32,759 --> 00:28:33,819
Their response time should be less

1206
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:34,430
than two hours.

1207
00:28:34,599 --> 00:28:36,210
And like proactive outreach, like

1208
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:37,730
checking out their clients three

1209
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:38,930
times a week, absolutely

1210
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:39,480
important.

1211
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,390
Business impact, expansion revenue

1212
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:43,460
per CSM, referral generation, they

1213
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:45,490
should be like, you know, at least

1214
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:47,259
getting, you know, out of their

1215
00:28:47,259 --> 00:28:47,660
clients.

1216
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:48,839
At least 25%, they should be

1217
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:49,700
getting referrals.

1218
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:51,210
They should be collecting 25% of

1219
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:52,730
like referrals from their clients,

1220
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:53,470
like minimum.

1221
00:28:53,539 --> 00:28:55,440
They should be aiming to get two

1222
00:28:55,559 --> 00:28:57,000
case studies a month.

1223
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:58,700
And then they should be like, you

1224
00:28:59,049 --> 00:29:00,789
know, really like increasing churn

1225
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:02,730
prevention metrics as much as they

1226
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:03,740
possibly can.

1227
00:29:03,789 --> 00:29:05,390
Essential management tools,

1228
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:07,490
Fathom, Typeform, Zoom, Calendly,

1229
00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:08,660
some sort of customer success

1230
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,009
platform, whether you're using any

1231
00:29:11,029 --> 00:29:11,900
sort of CRM.

1232
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:13,529
I mean, you can use ClickFunnels,

1233
00:29:13,529 --> 00:29:15,589
you can use Trello, you can use,

1234
00:29:15,589 --> 00:29:17,339
you can,

1235
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:18,440
you know, whatever that you are

1236
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:19,359
able to use and what you're

1237
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,200
comfortable with.

1238
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:20,900
Like some people like to use

1239
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:21,299
Notion.

1240
00:29:21,339 --> 00:29:22,890
Some people also like to use, like

1241
00:29:22,890 --> 00:29:24,509
build out their own dashboards.

1242
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:25,930
Some people like HubSpot, like

1243
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:27,130
whatever works for you, like

1244
00:29:27,329 --> 00:29:28,190
Monday.com.

1245
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,299
Like I don't care.

1246
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:30,880
But something to track, like

1247
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,309
what's happening with your

1248
00:29:32,309 --> 00:29:32,990
clients.

1249
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:33,859
So even if you want to use a

1250
00:29:33,859 --> 00:29:34,890
Google Sheet, like that's no

1251
00:29:35,059 --> 00:29:35,400
problem.

1252
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,460
And then of course, Google

1253
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:37,319
Calendar as well.

1254
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:39,559
And this is important too, so that

1255
00:29:39,559 --> 00:29:41,730
you can also see what's happening

1256
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:43,039
with your CSMs.

1257
00:29:43,079 --> 00:29:44,380
Because if you use Google Admin

1258
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:46,700
and Google Calendar, you can then

1259
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:49,900
go through like your actual SSEs

1260
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,279
or sorry, your CSMs like calendar

1261
00:29:52,279 --> 00:29:53,759
and see how many calls they're

1262
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:55,180
doing and things like that as

1263
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:55,660
well.

1264
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:56,990
And then monthly performance

1265
00:29:56,990 --> 00:29:57,440
reviews.

1266
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,539
Allow 30 days for full system

1267
00:29:58,900 --> 00:29:59,990
implementation to focus on

1268
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:01,519
foundational elements, one week in

1269
00:30:01,619 --> 00:30:02,099
process.

1270
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:03,650
So, you know, data preparation,

1271
00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:04,950
trend analysis, contextual

1272
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:06,599
assessment, forward planning, and

1273
00:30:06,599 --> 00:30:07,640
then recognition.

1274
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:10,650
So, you're always checking the

1275
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:12,990
monthly performance of your entire

1276
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:13,480
team.

1277
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:14,720
You want to make sure that

1278
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:16,230
everything is going in the right

1279
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:17,690
direction and that there's

1280
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:19,559
constant learning in portfolios.

1281
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:21,259
There's constant forward planning

1282
00:30:21,259 --> 00:30:22,559
and that you're never really

1283
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:24,089
taking your hand off the steering

1284
00:30:24,089 --> 00:30:24,859
wheel there.

1285
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,420
So, and then scaling and

1286
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:27,720
implementation.

1287
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:29,890
So, as your customer success team

1288
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:32,200
functions and grows, your approach

1289
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,369
evolving, you know, that's also

1290
00:30:34,369 --> 00:30:36,180
going to change then too.

1291
00:30:37,019 --> 00:30:38,079
So, you're going to have process

1292
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,940
integration for your power hours.

1293
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:40,869
You know, you're going to have

1294
00:30:40,869 --> 00:30:41,400
foundation.

1295
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,000
Again, this is just kind of a

1296
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:43,880
recap here.

1297
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,589
So, foundation setup, process

1298
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:47,430
integration, quality control,

1299
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:48,990
optimization, and then your team

1300
00:30:49,339 --> 00:30:50,920
structure is going to evolve from

1301
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:51,579
there.

1302
00:30:51,619 --> 00:30:53,000
This is basically just a TDLR of

1303
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:54,779
everything that you're working on.

1304
00:30:54,819 --> 00:30:56,400
And this is going to be some like

1305
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,160
client count and things like that

1306
00:30:58,170 --> 00:30:59,490
as well, depending.

1307
00:31:00,119 --> 00:31:01,650
Just to start you off to give you

1308
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:03,339
an understanding of like, if you

1309
00:31:03,369 --> 00:31:04,920
are hiring CSMs and when you're

1310
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,759
going to like manage CSMs, like

1311
00:31:06,759 --> 00:31:08,509
what that sort of is going to look

1312
00:31:08,509 --> 00:31:08,920
like.

1313
00:31:09,019 --> 00:31:10,470
So, if you have 25 to 50 clients,

1314
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:11,589
you're really fine with one single

1315
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:12,750
CSM and manager support.

1316
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:14,390
And if you have 45 to 90 clients,

1317
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:15,660
you're going to look at about two

1318
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:17,059
CSMs with, you know, specialized

1319
00:31:17,059 --> 00:31:17,579
roles.

1320
00:31:17,859 --> 00:31:19,410
And then 100 clients, you're

1321
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:20,799
looking at a CSM team with like,

1322
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:21,869
you know, a lead CSM and a

1323
00:31:21,869 --> 00:31:22,500
manager.

1324
00:31:22,539 --> 00:31:23,769
And then 300 clients, you're

1325
00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:24,839
looking at multiple teams with

1326
00:31:24,839 --> 00:31:25,799
specialized focused.

1327
00:31:25,839 --> 00:31:26,740
So, yeah.

1328
00:31:26,779 --> 00:31:28,450
Metrics after 30 days.

1329
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,029
Team engagement should be about

1330
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:30,740
90% high.

1331
00:31:30,779 --> 00:31:33,160
Process compliance should be 95%.

1332
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,259
Health score integration.

1333
00:31:34,299 --> 00:31:35,730
So, making sure they're all

1334
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:37,460
actually done is 100%.

1335
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:38,880
And early warning systems for

1336
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:40,380
yourself, then be able to catch

1337
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:41,890
all this and catch like problems

1338
00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:43,980
with your client should be 100%.

1339
00:31:44,019 --> 00:31:44,869
You always want to be able to

1340
00:31:44,869 --> 00:31:45,309
catch them.

1341
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:46,359
So, yeah.

1342
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:48,490
This framework requires about 8 to

1343
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:50,599
10 works of weekly management,

1344
00:31:50,599 --> 00:31:52,509
which is true, and delivers about

1345
00:31:52,509 --> 00:31:54,369
a 25 to 40% improvement in team

1346
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:56,319
performance and client outcomes.

1347
00:31:56,359 --> 00:31:58,460
So, this is going to bring in a

1348
00:31:58,460 --> 00:31:59,660
massive ROI.

1349
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,369
So, you can read more about this

1350
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:02,799
