1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:02,080
Yo, welcome back guys.

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,500
Here we're going to go through how

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,700
to onboard your CSM in an ideal

4
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:08,599
like 23 day kind of framework.

5
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:10,710
The faster you can get your CSM

6
00:00:10,779 --> 00:00:13,179
onboarded, the easier your life is

7
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:14,439
going to be.

8
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,420
No one wants to take too long

9
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,859
hiring a CSM, though I will say it

10
00:00:18,859 --> 00:00:20,780
is depending on the type of

11
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:22,980
service and product that you do

12
00:00:23,059 --> 00:00:23,620
have.

13
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:25,390
And how dense it actually is.

14
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:27,350
And then it also depends on their

15
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:28,199
experience.

16
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:30,089
But this is my framework to get

17
00:00:30,089 --> 00:00:32,320
someone up and running in about 23

18
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:34,460
days where I'm comfortable enough

19
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:36,439
letting them take onboarding calls

20
00:00:36,439 --> 00:00:37,429
and client meetings and things

21
00:00:37,429 --> 00:00:38,130
like that as well.

22
00:00:38,179 --> 00:00:40,030
So it's kind of my comprehensive

23
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:41,469
structure of how I do it.

24
00:00:41,929 --> 00:00:44,219
This is based off my own data of

25
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:46,729
me hiring a handful of SSEs at

26
00:00:46,729 --> 00:00:49,039
this point and very much my

27
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:51,399
systematic approach.

28
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:55,170
The foundation principle is new

29
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,090
CSMs must master your onboarding

30
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:58,840
process before they even touch

31
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,770
your clients.

32
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,159
I cannot stress this enough.

33
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:04,650
Like you always want to start in

34
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:06,090
the order of the work that they're

35
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:07,400
going to be doing.

36
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:10,069
Like, again, if you're watching

37
00:01:10,069 --> 00:01:11,959
these modules, you might be new to

38
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:13,799
client success management.

39
00:01:13,849 --> 00:01:14,870
That's very fair enough.

40
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:17,040
But like one thing that I would

41
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,030
not do when you hire a success

42
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:21,269
manager is like train them on the

43
00:01:21,269 --> 00:01:23,099
back end sales first.

44
00:01:23,969 --> 00:01:24,319
Why?

45
00:01:24,609 --> 00:01:26,239
They're not going to be doing any

46
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:27,939
back end sales for a period of

47
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:28,560
time.

48
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:30,019
The first thing they're going to

49
00:01:30,019 --> 00:01:31,430
be doing is onboarding clients.

50
00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:33,870
So therefore, train them on the

51
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:35,859
onboarding of clients.

52
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:36,750
Then what are they going to do

53
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:37,799
after onboarding clients?

54
00:01:37,859 --> 00:01:39,299
They're going to take, you know,

55
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:40,650
they're going to take meetings

56
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:41,599
with the clients.

57
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,709
So train them on how to run a

58
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:44,269
proper, correct meeting with the

59
00:01:44,269 --> 00:01:44,819
client.

60
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:46,370
And then later down the line,

61
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:47,620
they're going to be doing renewals

62
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:48,819
and they're going to be doing back

63
00:01:48,819 --> 00:01:49,200
end.

64
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:51,180
So train them later at that point.

65
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:52,640
It's kind of very straightforward.

66
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,719
It all falls a very linear line.

67
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:56,760
But onboarding process is

68
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,480
absolutely first.

69
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:00,510
It also sets them up to understand

70
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:02,060
the product service.

71
00:02:02,299 --> 00:02:04,040
They understand, like, what does

72
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:06,040
the customer journey look like?

73
00:02:06,099 --> 00:02:07,519
They understand, like, what is the

74
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:08,580
client's first steps?

75
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:09,819
Like, what do we need to get done

76
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,060
first in order to get to step two

77
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,210
and get to step three and get to

78
00:02:12,229 --> 00:02:13,000
step four?

79
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:14,039
And so on and so forth.

80
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,699
So the foundation of a successful

81
00:02:16,699 --> 00:02:18,469
CSM development rests critical

82
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:19,219
insight.

83
00:02:19,259 --> 00:02:21,000
So CSMs must thoroughly understand

84
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:22,250
and master the company's

85
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:24,139
onboarding process before engaging

86
00:02:24,139 --> 00:02:25,479
with actual customers.

87
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,550
This isn't just preference.

88
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,240
It's backed by compelling data.

89
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,669
So, you know, the faster, you

90
00:02:30,669 --> 00:02:33,379
know, the more they understand how

91
00:02:33,379 --> 00:02:35,990
to get, you know, a client a first

92
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:36,960
quick win,

93
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,919
you know, they're going to be so

94
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:40,860
much better in terms of actually

95
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,669
providing results and actually

96
00:02:42,669 --> 00:02:43,759
getting engagement.

97
00:02:44,419 --> 00:02:45,449
And when new CSMs need to

98
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:47,120
understand the client journey from

99
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,800
day one, they develop the context

100
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,530
needed to provide this meaningful

101
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:51,900
support at every stage.

102
00:02:51,939 --> 00:02:53,930
So, every fail CSM started with an

103
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:56,080
adequate onboarding knowledge.

104
00:02:56,409 --> 00:02:57,150
Master this first.

105
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:59,240
Again, if your CSM does not know

106
00:02:59,259 --> 00:03:01,479
how to onboard a client properly,

107
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:03,979
not only is the client going to

108
00:03:03,979 --> 00:03:06,370
churn or is the client become

109
00:03:06,379 --> 00:03:07,590
disengaged,

110
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:09,949
like they've lost all authority

111
00:03:10,009 --> 00:03:11,900
and the business brand and

112
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,120
reputation is sunk as well on top

113
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:14,729
of it.

114
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,889
So, you should give your entire

115
00:03:16,889 --> 00:03:18,139
CSM development program by

116
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,759
intensively onboarding mastery in

117
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:21,710
the first 23 days you create, you

118
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:22,740
have a CSM.

119
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,740
So, what you need to have before

120
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:28,430
you onboard a CSM is comprehensive

121
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:30,020
documentation.

122
00:03:30,069 --> 00:03:31,699
You need to make sure that they

123
00:03:31,699 --> 00:03:33,349
have all the document, all the

124
00:03:33,539 --> 00:03:35,280
information, all the business

125
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,490
operations, manuals, breakdowns,

126
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:38,740
client workflows,

127
00:03:39,169 --> 00:03:40,150
everything they can possibly get

128
00:03:40,259 --> 00:03:40,939
their hands on.

129
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,150
It helps significantly more if you

130
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:45,030
have Loom videos, SOBs, or like a

131
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:46,659
Kajabi, or like a school, or

132
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:47,800
whatever it is.

133
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,909
It's like, but just video learning

134
00:03:49,969 --> 00:03:51,750
so that you, the founder or

135
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,750
another CSM or the head of client

136
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,280
success in the company,

137
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,310
actually breaks down the business

138
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:58,990
methodology and the service

139
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:00,889
delivery and can even show some

140
00:04:00,889 --> 00:04:02,979
like recordings of like examples

141
00:04:02,979 --> 00:04:04,539
of client calls and interactions

142
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:05,240
that they've had

143
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,740
so that they can get even further

144
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:08,139
experience, especially the

145
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,319
onboarding process.

146
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,909
And then knowledge verification,

147
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:12,039
like implement rigorous

148
00:04:12,139 --> 00:04:13,479
assessments to ensure complete

149
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:14,870
comprehension of the business

150
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:16,680
fundamentals and the onboarding

151
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:17,379
process.

152
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,569
Pre-onboarding requirements, so

153
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:21,529
yes, set up SOPs, documentations,

154
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:23,329
libraries, all of that, like it's

155
00:04:23,339 --> 00:04:24,899
all kind of written there.

156
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,639
Also, show them client case study

157
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:27,480
interviews.

158
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,730
This is really, really important.

159
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:30,269
They need to see what a successful

160
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,319
client looks like.

161
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:33,050
They need to know the standards of

162
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:34,589
the company, of like what you

163
00:04:34,589 --> 00:04:36,379
consider a case study result.

164
00:04:36,579 --> 00:04:38,060
That's very, very important as

165
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:38,490
well.

166
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:40,009
They need to see clearly the

167
00:04:40,009 --> 00:04:41,199
service delivery.

168
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,199
They need to see previous

169
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:43,120
onboarding calls.

170
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,060
They need to see the tool

171
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,300
navigation and system tutorials

172
00:04:45,379 --> 00:04:46,899
for all the technology products.

173
00:04:46,939 --> 00:04:48,160
So don't just give them SOPs and

174
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:49,740
like how to also talk to clients

175
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,149
and how to like do an onboarding

176
00:04:51,149 --> 00:04:52,540
call and things like that.

177
00:04:52,829 --> 00:04:54,250
They need SOPs of like how are

178
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,829
they going to manage their

179
00:04:55,829 --> 00:04:56,680
calendar?

180
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,870
How are they going to set up

181
00:04:57,910 --> 00:04:58,449
Calendly?

182
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,759
How are they going to manage

183
00:04:59,939 --> 00:05:00,420
Slack?

184
00:05:00,459 --> 00:05:01,850
How are they going to manage, you

185
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:03,660
know, cross-team communications?

186
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,300
Like, you know, how are they going

187
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,000
to handle like emailing clients?

188
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,879
And, you know, just the standard

189
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:10,709
things, like the small things that

190
00:05:10,709 --> 00:05:12,220
you really don't think about on a

191
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:13,160
day-to-day basis,

192
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:14,220
because these are the things that

193
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,189
are going to keep coming back to

194
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:16,279
you with simple questions of,

195
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:18,000
or they're going to, you don't

196
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,860
want to, you know, onboard a new

197
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:20,360
CSM.

198
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:21,430
And then all of a sudden, like,

199
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,399
you know, two weeks go by and

200
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:23,000
they're like,

201
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,680
do I pay for Calendly myself or is

202
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,629
the company paying for Calendly?

203
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:27,959
Because I don't have a Calendly

204
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,189
and the client's asking for a

205
00:05:29,189 --> 00:05:29,620
call,

206
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:30,689
but I'm just going to have to do

207
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:32,079
it manually through Google Meet

208
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:32,949
and things like that.

209
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:33,970
But if I do it through Google

210
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:35,050
Meet, the Fathom recorder is not

211
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:35,740
going to kick in.

212
00:05:35,949 --> 00:05:37,399
See what I mean here?

213
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:38,319
You're going to run into all

214
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:39,579
these, like, annoyances if you

215
00:05:39,579 --> 00:05:41,199
don't have your ducks in a row

216
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,139
before you actually hire CSM.

217
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:44,209
So make sure you're aware of your

218
00:05:44,379 --> 00:05:44,800
tech stack.

219
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:46,220
Make sure that you're aware of,

220
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,060
like, all the, like, ins and outs.

221
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,310
And there's just a small one or

222
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:50,709
even two minute SOP videos just to

223
00:05:50,709 --> 00:05:51,939
explain the simple stuff.

224
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:54,480
So client onboarding process, tech

225
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,910
stack tutorials, all these sort of

226
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:57,759
things.

227
00:05:58,279 --> 00:05:59,889
You want to also give some, like,

228
00:05:59,889 --> 00:06:01,519
different types of SOPs where it's

229
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:02,810
just you, the founder,

230
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:03,889
or, again, the head of client

231
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:05,519
success, whatever it is, just

232
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:07,579
breaking down, like, you know,

233
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,209
the company history, the missions,

234
00:06:09,209 --> 00:06:10,610
the values, the target market,

235
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,000
competitive positioning.

236
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:13,310
You know, they should be able to

237
00:06:13,459 --> 00:06:15,050
articulate, like, where you stand

238
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:16,529
in your market and where you're

239
00:06:16,529 --> 00:06:17,199
currently at.

240
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,819
You want to also explain, you

241
00:06:18,819 --> 00:06:20,189
know, service offering

242
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,949
comprehension, like, quizzes,

243
00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:23,199
assessments, verify understanding.

244
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:24,930
Like, if you have a Google Form

245
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:27,000
quiz, anything like that, too.

246
00:06:27,189 --> 00:06:28,600
That's also really helpful down

247
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,019
the line, whether you make it just

248
00:06:30,259 --> 00:06:31,699
even a few minutes before the CSM

249
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:32,379
takes it.

250
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:33,879
But it's good to just have this

251
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:35,620
stuff locked and loaded, ready to

252
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:37,180
go, you know, before they get

253
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,019
onboarded.

254
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,029
So, again, if they pass the

255
00:06:39,029 --> 00:06:40,360
onboarding process, hey, here's a

256
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,050
Google Form.

257
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,740
It's going to be, like, a quiz on

258
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:43,990
our onboarding process.

259
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:45,410
Just run it through there and let

260
00:06:45,529 --> 00:06:46,759
me know what results you get, you

261
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:47,189
know.

262
00:06:47,259 --> 00:06:48,519
You can see, you know, you'll be

263
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:49,779
able to see their submission and

264
00:06:49,779 --> 00:06:50,420
their results,

265
00:06:50,459 --> 00:06:51,480
and you'll be able to read and

266
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,939
evaluate their actual knowledge.

267
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,600
You know, again, same for the

268
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,639
onboarding process and client

269
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:56,720
interaction, kind of, like,

270
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,339
assessments.

271
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:58,850
Like, small little quizzes and

272
00:06:58,889 --> 00:07:00,620
tests work really, really well.

273
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:03,550
So, new hires have immediate

274
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,800
access to well-structured

275
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,500
resources.

276
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:07,189
So, day to one-seventh, they just

277
00:07:07,189 --> 00:07:08,529
want to get the foundational

278
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:10,160
learning and structure and have a

279
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:10,970
daily plan.

280
00:07:11,019 --> 00:07:12,240
You know, you kind of want to make

281
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:13,930
sure, you know, again, sometimes

282
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:15,180
it's nice to do a one-to-one in

283
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,769
the morning and things like that.

284
00:07:16,899 --> 00:07:18,449
I still like, when I onboard CSM,

285
00:07:18,449 --> 00:07:19,819
to give them kind of, like, a

286
00:07:20,019 --> 00:07:20,839
daily one-to-one.

287
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:22,560
That's my method because it's good

288
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,910
to get them on a call so they can

289
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:25,180
go over today's previous

290
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,019
learnings.

291
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:27,089
They can ask questions.

292
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:28,250
You can set expectations.

293
00:07:28,339 --> 00:07:29,560
You can focus on what they need to

294
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,160
learn next.

295
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:31,759
You're just keeping an eye on them

296
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:33,040
on a day-to-day basis.

297
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:34,279
You want to make sure that they

298
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:35,680
have a goal, they have a plan,

299
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,420
they've mapped out, like, a KPI

300
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:38,819
kind of structure of what they

301
00:07:38,819 --> 00:07:40,100
need to be doing on a day-to-day.

302
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:41,670
Otherwise, it's not very

303
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:43,319
beneficial if you're like, here's

304
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:44,670
all our SOPs, go watch them and

305
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:45,500
best of luck.

306
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:47,540
It's like, it's unmonitored, it's

307
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:48,829
untracked, there's no

308
00:07:49,019 --> 00:07:50,449
communication, there's no

309
00:07:50,449 --> 00:07:52,259
understanding of, like, what

310
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:54,040
you're expecting them to do in an

311
00:07:54,129 --> 00:07:56,410
eight-hour working day, you know?

312
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:58,399
And sometimes as well, it's like,

313
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:00,209
if you give people all these SOPs

314
00:08:00,209 --> 00:08:01,920
and all these videos and it's,

315
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:04,139
like, 14 hours of content, it's

316
00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:05,470
like, yeah, they'll sit there and

317
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:06,699
they'll watch them and you'll see

318
00:08:06,699 --> 00:08:07,519
that they watched it.

319
00:08:07,699 --> 00:08:09,519
But it's like, you know, did they

320
00:08:09,529 --> 00:08:11,250
just hear the video and watch the

321
00:08:11,269 --> 00:08:13,069
video or did they actually listen

322
00:08:13,069 --> 00:08:14,720
and learn from the video?

323
00:08:15,009 --> 00:08:16,149
There's a big difference from

324
00:08:16,149 --> 00:08:16,579
that.

325
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,180
So I like one-to-ones just even

326
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,410
for at least half an hour every

327
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,139
day with them just to ensure

328
00:08:21,139 --> 00:08:22,759
quality that they're actually

329
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:24,480
taking in their attention.

330
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:25,550
And they're coming to me with

331
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,980
their burning questions that I can

332
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:27,810
answer for them.

333
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:29,060
You have to remember every day

334
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:30,470
that you answer a question for any

335
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:32,019
of these CSMs, they're getting 1%

336
00:08:32,019 --> 00:08:33,269
better for every question you

337
00:08:33,269 --> 00:08:33,759
answer.

338
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:36,370
So, yeah, you want to give them

339
00:08:36,538 --> 00:08:37,570
some independent learning, but to

340
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:38,779
make sure it's structured and, you

341
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,480
know, that they actually have a

342
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,059
goal to get reached and what they

343
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:43,190
have a goal to actually finish and

344
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:43,658
get done.

345
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:44,730
And there's, like, a quiz at the

346
00:08:44,889 --> 00:08:45,769
end of it, which is also very

347
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,320
helpful.

348
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,600
So you can split it in, like, a

349
00:08:48,629 --> 00:08:50,000
morning 30 minutes and an end of

350
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,019
day 30 minutes.

351
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:52,460
Sometimes I like to just do a one

352
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,860
hour just off the rip because I

353
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,299
know I'm going to have probably

354
00:08:55,299 --> 00:08:56,740
another call with them the next

355
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:58,659
day or at least the following day.

356
00:08:59,379 --> 00:09:00,639
So you want to just go through,

357
00:09:00,759 --> 00:09:02,539
like, business 101, methodology,

358
00:09:02,539 --> 00:09:03,759
philosophy, case studies,

359
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:04,850
marketing position.

360
00:09:04,909 --> 00:09:06,100
Like, they just need to learn

361
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,509
where they're at and what they're

362
00:09:07,509 --> 00:09:08,759
doing and what the goal is.

363
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,649
Service offerings and packages,

364
00:09:10,649 --> 00:09:11,539
that's next.

365
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:12,940
They need to understand, like,

366
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,759
what do we offer?

367
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:14,539
What's the package?

368
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:15,559
What's the deal size?

369
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,629
How long do you, what's the

370
00:09:16,629 --> 00:09:17,940
customer contract length?

371
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:19,009
How long are they going to be here

372
00:09:19,149 --> 00:09:19,200
for?

373
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:20,850
What's the goal timeline for until

374
00:09:20,889 --> 00:09:22,159
they get their first win?

375
00:09:22,299 --> 00:09:23,330
When should they get their first

376
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:23,769
win?

377
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:25,039
When should clients start really

378
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,019
seeing results?

379
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,470
You know, then you can go into,

380
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,509
like, the tech stack,

381
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:30,250
communications, the tools, project

382
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,860
management softwares, your CRMs,

383
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,500
your workflow integrations, all of

384
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,779
that sort of stuff then.

385
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:36,600
Now that they have a much better

386
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,450
concept of what it is the business

387
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:40,100
is trying to do, then all of the

388
00:09:40,149 --> 00:09:41,600
tech stack is going to actually

389
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,730
start making sense.

390
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:43,750
And then it's going to be

391
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,200
integration and assessment.

392
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,870
Again, this is good time to send

393
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:48,529
them kind of like a test based off

394
00:09:48,659 --> 00:09:50,490
of business and 101 service and

395
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,090
offering packages and the tech

396
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:52,700
stack.

397
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:54,919
So, implement daily feedback to

398
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:56,610
new CSMs to report their

399
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:58,740
confidence level with today's

400
00:09:58,740 --> 00:09:59,720
material.

401
00:09:59,809 --> 00:10:00,960
Score below seven indicate areas

402
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,059
of additional focus before

403
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:02,720
proceeding.

404
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:03,789
So, again, just ask them simple

405
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,909
things like, hey, out of a scale

406
00:10:04,909 --> 00:10:06,039
of one to ten, how proficient do

407
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:06,960
you feel like you're in this

408
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,299
section?

409
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:09,919
The quiz will give you the real

410
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:10,759
answer.

411
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:11,840
That's the point.

412
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:14,629
Days eight to 15, this is like

413
00:10:14,629 --> 00:10:16,070
mock calls and shadowing.

414
00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:17,750
So, this is where you want them to

415
00:10:17,789 --> 00:10:19,009
go through all of your call

416
00:10:19,059 --> 00:10:20,759
recordings and breakdowns and all,

417
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:22,259
like, you know, watching your

418
00:10:22,259 --> 00:10:23,830
onboarding calls in depth.

419
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:25,549
You want to send them, like, three

420
00:10:25,549 --> 00:10:26,700
to five recordings.

421
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:27,940
You're going to ask them to watch

422
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,450
them not just once, but watch them

423
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:29,899
twice.

424
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:31,620
Tell them to start, like, planning

425
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,240
and mapping out their questions.

426
00:10:33,379 --> 00:10:34,399
Why did you ask this?

427
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,679
Why did you ask this client this,

428
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:36,620
not this client that?

429
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:37,710
You know, you want to start

430
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,149
getting them to sort of really

431
00:10:39,149 --> 00:10:40,179
thinking about it.

432
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:41,740
Especially if you provide your

433
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,230
service for multiple different

434
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:45,080
niches and offerings and services.

435
00:10:45,129 --> 00:10:47,190
You know, again, if you're, like,

436
00:10:47,259 --> 00:10:49,480
an ads funnel agency, for example.

437
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,580
Yeah, you do add some funnels for,

438
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:53,409
like, a lot of different B2B

439
00:10:53,409 --> 00:10:54,419
businesses.

440
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:55,720
But some businesses are going to

441
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,070
have different funnel types than

442
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:58,659
other different business types.

443
00:10:59,049 --> 00:11:00,279
Because there's a different market

444
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:01,710
trend or there's, you know, the

445
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:03,139
offer is more elite generation or

446
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,460
demand capture versus demand

447
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:05,279
generation.

448
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,049
Like, again, these little small

449
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,759
nuances here is everything that a

450
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:10,399
CSM needs to know and understand

451
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,169
to actually be applicable to their

452
00:11:12,169 --> 00:11:13,820
role so they can actually do their

453
00:11:13,909 --> 00:11:14,899
job properly.

454
00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:17,190
You know, another thing that I

455
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:18,460
really love to do as well is a

456
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:19,700
live call breakdown.

457
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,279
So, you just get on Zoom.

458
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,179
You share your screen.

459
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,250
You open up a call.

460
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,820
And then you watch the call live

461
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:25,389
with them.

462
00:11:25,539 --> 00:11:27,059
And then you can pause and break

463
00:11:27,059 --> 00:11:28,679
down and explain why I asked this

464
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:29,919
specific question.

465
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,230
Why I held them, like, you know,

466
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,460
why I gave them this implication

467
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:33,059
question.

468
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,559
Why I dig deeper into this pain

469
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:36,360
point specifically for this client

470
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,919
when they're on the onboarding

471
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:38,370
call.

472
00:11:38,889 --> 00:11:40,870
Why did I, you know, suggest to

473
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:43,039
them you should do this instead of

474
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:43,700
that.

475
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:44,769
Like, so because these are the

476
00:11:44,929 --> 00:11:46,000
nuances that they're going to

477
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,259
learn and they're going to be able

478
00:11:47,259 --> 00:11:48,110
to break down a lot more

479
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:48,899
effectively.

480
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,399
So, this is a really, really,

481
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,950
really effective way of teaching

482
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,220
someone live on a call.

483
00:11:53,259 --> 00:11:54,470
And not to mention when that call

484
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:55,919
is recorded, you also have this

485
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:56,879
fathom recording.

486
00:11:56,919 --> 00:11:58,529
So, then this fathom recording can

487
00:11:58,529 --> 00:12:00,090
be a great further training, you

488
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:01,639
know, if the call goes well.

489
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:02,690
So, you can really start

490
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:04,090
compounding a lot of your SOPs and

491
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:05,230
a lot of your trainings.

492
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:07,100
And, again, through the AI Sys

493
00:12:07,169 --> 00:12:08,419
Agency kind of, like, modules and

494
00:12:08,419 --> 00:12:09,740
things like that as well, you'll

495
00:12:09,779 --> 00:12:11,100
be able to actually start, like,

496
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,480
breaking these down and building,

497
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,710
like, really serious SOPs just

498
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:14,990
through all of these transcripts

499
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:16,059
and call recordings.

500
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,090
And then just, like, onboarding

501
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:19,399
document deep dive.

502
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,529
Like, just breaking down the

503
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:21,139
document.

504
00:12:21,179 --> 00:12:22,649
Why we ask these questions.

505
00:12:22,769 --> 00:12:23,750
What you need to ask in this

506
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:24,899
specific category.

507
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,200
How you're going to break down

508
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:27,879
your onboarding in specific ways.

509
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:29,309
Like, this is really, really

510
00:12:29,309 --> 00:12:30,299
important, too.

511
00:12:30,629 --> 00:12:31,610
Because they're going to

512
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,919
understand the flow.

513
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,230
They're going to understand, like,

514
00:12:34,309 --> 00:12:35,379
to learn the documentation.

515
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:36,669
And there's patterns to every

516
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:38,159
single onboarding document.

517
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:40,269
There's, like, there's anchors

518
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:41,700
that I call them.

519
00:12:42,009 --> 00:12:43,470
There's points in the onboarding

520
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:45,240
process where you need to stop and

521
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,100
take a beat.

522
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,549
Otherwise, you're going to

523
00:12:47,549 --> 00:12:49,360
completely overindulge the client

524
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,870
with so much information that

525
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,620
their brain can't possibly take it

526
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:52,990
in.

527
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,110
You need to take a break to say,

528
00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:55,139
like, hey, do you have any

529
00:12:55,139 --> 00:12:55,779
questions?

530
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,039
Does this all make sense to you

531
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:57,720
right now?

532
00:12:57,759 --> 00:12:58,960
Am I going too fast?

533
00:12:59,120 --> 00:12:59,799
Do you need a minute?

534
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:02,679
Like, these little small moments.

535
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,730
And then there's going to be

536
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:04,750
potential moments in your

537
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,009
onboarding process where you're

538
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,090
going to upsell a client to a

539
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:07,879
certain thing.

540
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,600
Or you're going to offer a certain

541
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,779
package to a client.

542
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,100
Or you're going to understand how

543
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,279
they want to be coached and how

544
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:14,309
they want to be managed as a

545
00:13:14,309 --> 00:13:14,919
client.

546
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:17,529
So, these types of deep dives are

547
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,759
very, very important as well.

548
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,419
So, they can see it firsthand.

549
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:23,529
So, first mock call that you're

550
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,580
going to do with your CSM.

551
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:26,649
It's going to be friendly,

552
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,240
engaged, you know, straightforward

553
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,120
business model.

554
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:30,190
No major complications.

555
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,440
Just basic flow.

556
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:32,850
You just want to get them into the

557
00:13:33,019 --> 00:13:33,580
flow of things.

558
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:34,970
The second mock call is going to

559
00:13:35,019 --> 00:13:36,629
be a little bit more challenging.

560
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:39,029
Maybe a skeptical or a hesitant

561
00:13:39,029 --> 00:13:39,919
client.

562
00:13:40,009 --> 00:13:40,980
Maybe a client has a certain

563
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:41,679
personality.

564
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:42,929
Again, use your own personal

565
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,289
experience from the time you

566
00:13:44,289 --> 00:13:45,559
onboarded a client that was a

567
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:46,980
little bit maybe nervous.

568
00:13:47,019 --> 00:13:48,490
You know, maybe they have a more

569
00:13:48,529 --> 00:13:50,139
complex business situation.

570
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:51,590
Maybe they have two founders

571
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:52,250
involved.

572
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:53,860
You know, and then you want to

573
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:55,340
really test them on, like,

574
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,009
handling objections and kind of,

575
00:13:57,049 --> 00:13:58,289
like, building confidence and

576
00:13:58,289 --> 00:13:59,940
building authority onto that call.

577
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,539
Then, the third mock call is you

578
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:02,750
want to make this really

579
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:03,480
difficult.

580
00:14:03,539 --> 00:14:05,240
You want to honestly make this

581
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,460
like an onboarding call from hell.

582
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:08,740
You want them to go through the

583
00:14:08,899 --> 00:14:10,240
worst possible scenario.

584
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:11,830
You can tell your CSM I'm giving

585
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:13,779
you the worst possible scenario.

586
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:15,549
Tell them in hindsight, I'm going

587
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,110
to make this as difficult as I

588
00:14:17,299 --> 00:14:18,360
possibly can for you.

589
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:20,200
And any mock call that you run

590
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,809
after that, give them that

591
00:14:21,809 --> 00:14:22,679
situation.

592
00:14:22,769 --> 00:14:24,789
You need to set them up for hell.

593
00:14:25,389 --> 00:14:26,950
Because if you give them the most

594
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:29,190
annoying, heart, soul-crushing,

595
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:31,429
heartbreaking, like, mock call for

596
00:14:31,549 --> 00:14:33,049
an onboarding that they're

597
00:14:33,049 --> 00:14:34,980
possibly ever going to match,

598
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:37,070
the likelihood of them ever going

599
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:39,309
through that situation is actually

600
00:14:39,309 --> 00:14:40,799
pretty slim to none.

601
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,409
But what you're doing them is

602
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:45,230
you're training them to now take,

603
00:14:45,419 --> 00:14:46,320
like, go to war.

604
00:14:46,419 --> 00:14:48,049
You're training them to go through

605
00:14:48,049 --> 00:14:49,679
the worst possible situation and

606
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:51,289
how they manage to get themselves

607
00:14:51,289 --> 00:14:52,639
out of that situation.

608
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:54,309
You want to be aggressive and a

609
00:14:54,309 --> 00:14:55,580
demanding client.

610
00:14:55,629 --> 00:14:57,549
You want to constantly mention bad

611
00:14:57,559 --> 00:14:59,139
previous experiences.

612
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:00,429
You want to set unrealistic

613
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,279
expectations.

614
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:02,879
And you want to see how they

615
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:04,899
de-escalate the situation and,

616
00:15:04,909 --> 00:15:07,090
like, align expectations for that

617
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:07,840
client.

618
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:09,600
So that's what you want to do

619
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,279
there.

620
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,350
And you want to just keep making

621
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:12,389
them more and more and more and

622
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:13,279
more difficult.

623
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,350
So that way, when they actually do

624
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:15,190
get a client and they're not

625
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:17,000
onboarding, it's going to feel

626
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,580
like a fever dream.

627
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:22,460
After completing the mock call

628
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:24,470
sequence, CSMs should shadow, you

629
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:26,330
know, I wouldn't even say at least

630
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:27,669
one live onboarding.

631
00:15:27,779 --> 00:15:29,210
If you have more, as many as you

632
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:30,980
possibly can, they should honestly

633
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,559
be shadowing as many calls as they

634
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:34,379
can in many different scenarios.

635
00:15:34,419 --> 00:15:35,950
Not just onboarding, but now's a

636
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,159
good time to actually now

637
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,759
integrate them into, like, you

638
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:40,659
know, client meeting calls or

639
00:15:40,659 --> 00:15:41,779
check-in calls,

640
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:42,850
whatever it might be that you do

641
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:43,659
for your business.

642
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,159
It's just so they can actually

643
00:15:45,159 --> 00:15:46,159
start seeing it.

644
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,269
And then you kind of want to run,

645
00:15:48,269 --> 00:15:50,090
you know, a Q&A with them on one

646
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:52,059
of your next one-to-one meetings

647
00:15:52,059 --> 00:15:53,629
of, like, hey, what are your do's

648
00:15:53,629 --> 00:15:54,139
and don'ts?

649
00:15:54,179 --> 00:15:54,879
Like, what are the do's?

650
00:15:54,919 --> 00:15:55,879
Like, do you do this or do you

651
00:15:55,879 --> 00:15:56,539
don't do this?

652
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,990
And just to kind of really start

653
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:59,659
tracking to see, like, you know,

654
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,120
how sophisticated their critical

655
00:16:01,289 --> 00:16:02,909
thinking is developing within the

656
00:16:03,029 --> 00:16:03,399
company

657
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,399
and, like, how well are they

658
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:05,509
understanding the product and the

659
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:06,649
service and the types of clients

660
00:16:06,649 --> 00:16:07,600
that they're serving.

661
00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:09,710
So conduct a comprehensive session

662
00:16:09,809 --> 00:16:11,940
covering critical behaviors.

663
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:13,009
You know, critical do's always

664
00:16:13,179 --> 00:16:14,049
confirm understanding before

665
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:14,779
moving forward.

666
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:15,769
Document everything during the

667
00:16:15,769 --> 00:16:16,029
call.

668
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,019
Set clear expectations.

669
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:18,529
End with specific next steps.

670
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:19,779
Never promise the outcomes you

671
00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:20,649
can't guarantee.

672
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,090
Don't skip discovery to rush to

673
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:22,769
solutions.

674
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:24,019
Never argue with clients about

675
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,440
their current situation.

676
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,679
Don't end calls without clear

677
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:27,759
follow-up plans.

678
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:29,690
Like, again, simple things like

679
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:30,179
this.

680
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,450
This is just all you're trying to

681
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,139
understand.

682
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:34,840
So by the end of this, CSM should

683
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,340
be able to demonstrate confidence

684
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:37,980
on the onboarding call structure,

685
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:39,570
show competency in navigating the

686
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:40,990
actual typical scenarios with

687
00:16:41,139 --> 00:16:41,539
clients,

688
00:16:42,039 --> 00:16:43,289
and then they can articulate the

689
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:44,740
purpose behind each question in

690
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,320
the onboarding process as well.

691
00:16:46,649 --> 00:16:47,960
Again, you shouldn't be asking

692
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,320
questions on an onboarding call

693
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,419
that are not useless to the

694
00:16:50,419 --> 00:16:51,360
onboarding call.

695
00:16:51,419 --> 00:16:52,429
Very straightforward.

696
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,029
It's the same as being on a sales

697
00:16:54,029 --> 00:16:54,500
call.

698
00:16:54,539 --> 00:16:55,909
You wouldn't ask them, like, by

699
00:16:55,919 --> 00:16:56,610
the way, what's your favorite

700
00:16:56,679 --> 00:16:56,899
color?

701
00:16:57,139 --> 00:16:58,169
Like, half which was a sales call

702
00:16:58,340 --> 00:16:59,120
means fucking nothing.

703
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:03,639
So day 16 to 23, live interaction.

704
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:05,539
So now they're going to start

705
00:17:05,539 --> 00:17:07,200
taking on some live calls.

706
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,980
Like, now you can actually kind of

707
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,578
start letting your CSM go through

708
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:11,809
an onboarding call.

709
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:13,930
You know, if you can, the manager

710
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:16,109
or the founder, listen into the

711
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:16,720
call.

712
00:17:17,009 --> 00:17:17,960
Just join the call.

713
00:17:18,369 --> 00:17:19,740
Turn your camera and your

714
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,068
microphone off.

715
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:21,789
Just sit there.

716
00:17:22,539 --> 00:17:23,759
If you're on Zoom, which you

717
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,838
should be, by the way, you can

718
00:17:26,019 --> 00:17:29,799
then, like, directly DM them.

719
00:17:30,039 --> 00:17:31,690
Tell them to keep their Zoom chat

720
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:33,430
open so that you can guide them

721
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:34,680
through the call.

722
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,240
You just be a fly on the wall.

723
00:17:36,279 --> 00:17:37,299
Don't say a thing.

724
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,039
Just pretend you're not there.

725
00:17:39,339 --> 00:17:42,019
And just be there to guide them.

726
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:43,529
Give them live feedback on the

727
00:17:43,569 --> 00:17:44,130
moment.

728
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:45,410
Tell them to answer certain

729
00:17:45,579 --> 00:17:46,220
questions.

730
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:47,779
Ask this question.

731
00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:48,849
Follow up with this.

732
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,029
This, and give them key

733
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,920
information about businesses and

734
00:17:52,119 --> 00:17:53,380
nuances so you can guide them

735
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,119
through that call.

736
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,000
It's really, really effective if

737
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
you can do that.

738
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:58,240
And you're going to make their

739
00:17:58,420 --> 00:17:59,549
first, second, and third

740
00:17:59,549 --> 00:18:01,220
onboarding call much, much easier.

741
00:18:01,549 --> 00:18:02,690
Because now they actually have,

742
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:03,990
like, a guide with them on the

743
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:04,440
call.

744
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,420
Don't worry about your client.

745
00:18:06,529 --> 00:18:07,690
They're not going to get that

746
00:18:07,859 --> 00:18:09,119
fucking weird about it.

747
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,779
I've done it many times.

748
00:18:11,109 --> 00:18:13,210
People just go, oh, who's this

749
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:13,779
guy?

750
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:16,400
And they can just say, that's

751
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:17,519
Andy.

752
00:18:17,559 --> 00:18:18,759
He's the head of client success.

753
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:19,920
He's just here for quality

754
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:20,460
assurance.

755
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:22,019
Cool.

756
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:23,480
No one cares that much.

757
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:24,400
It's not that deep.

758
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,910
And then, you know, if they can

759
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:27,299
get a few under their belt and

760
00:18:27,559 --> 00:18:28,990
stuff like that, they're going to,

761
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:31,180
like, have increased independence.

762
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:32,180
They're going to now feel more

763
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:32,799
comfortable.

764
00:18:32,839 --> 00:18:33,769
The first onboarding call is

765
00:18:33,769 --> 00:18:35,019
always the most nerve-wracking.

766
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:36,299
After they get that done out of

767
00:18:36,299 --> 00:18:37,660
the way, you can give them clear

768
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:39,299
feedback, instruction, support,

769
00:18:39,299 --> 00:18:40,660
how they can improve, what they

770
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:42,059
did good, what they did bad, how

771
00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:43,220
you're going to work on your

772
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,849
training in further detail.

773
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:46,660
Again, at this point, you should

774
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,329
still be doing, you know, at least

775
00:18:48,329 --> 00:18:49,869
a handful of times a week, a quick

776
00:18:49,869 --> 00:18:51,410
one-to-one with these guys, even

777
00:18:51,529 --> 00:18:52,569
for half an hour.

778
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:55,180
I typically like to do it all the

779
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,460
way for 23 days.

780
00:18:56,769 --> 00:18:58,539
When I hire a CSM, which we call

781
00:18:58,539 --> 00:19:00,859
SSC as in client ascension, I'm on

782
00:19:00,859 --> 00:19:03,019
a call with them pretty much four

783
00:19:03,019 --> 00:19:04,529
days out of the week on a

784
00:19:04,539 --> 00:19:06,269
one-to-one basis having a

785
00:19:06,329 --> 00:19:08,220
conversation with them.

786
00:19:09,069 --> 00:19:09,910
I'm at least on a call with them

787
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:10,900
where I can ask them, hey, do you

788
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:11,740
have any questions?

789
00:19:11,779 --> 00:19:12,509
What are you working on?

790
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:13,099
What are you up to?

791
00:19:13,299 --> 00:19:15,210
You should be having some sort of

792
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:17,519
call interaction with them all the

793
00:19:17,579 --> 00:19:19,140
way up to day 23.

794
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:20,869
So it sets that up there, and you

795
00:19:20,869 --> 00:19:22,339
can start working on real,

796
00:19:22,339 --> 00:19:24,200
tackling real, you know, client

797
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,029
problem situations in a real-life

798
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,680
scenario, and it's no longer a

799
00:19:27,769 --> 00:19:28,559
mock call.

800
00:19:28,619 --> 00:19:29,829
They actually now are responsible

801
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,690
for that client.

802
00:19:32,019 --> 00:19:33,950
Now, quality assessment, you know,

803
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:34,920
they can now do them

804
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:35,900
independently.

805
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,150
You can leave them to do it on

806
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:38,119
their own devices.

807
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,779
You know, they can establish

808
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:41,339
standards, you know, they

809
00:19:41,339 --> 00:19:43,359
understand everything that they're

810
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:45,049
doing, and then you can go from

811
00:19:45,049 --> 00:19:45,740
there.

812
00:19:45,779 --> 00:19:47,920
So morning planning, review call

813
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:50,160
clients, client calls, prepare

814
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:51,099
strategy.

815
00:19:51,299 --> 00:19:52,170
That's also helpful.

816
00:19:52,549 --> 00:19:54,109
Post-call debriefs, you know,

817
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:56,079
conduct a quick 15 minutes.

818
00:19:56,119 --> 00:19:56,759
What went well?

819
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:58,140
Maybe they can shoot you a loom,

820
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:59,589
maybe a voice note inside of Slack

821
00:19:59,589 --> 00:20:00,559
or a quick message.

822
00:20:01,339 --> 00:20:02,529
And then end-of-day reflection,

823
00:20:02,529 --> 00:20:03,720
that's also really helpful there

824
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,200
as well.

825
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,509
If they can give you any sort of

826
00:20:05,619 --> 00:20:06,980
insights, you can do that also in

827
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:08,490
the end-of-day type form as well,

828
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:09,299
by the way.

829
00:20:09,339 --> 00:20:10,339
You don't have to worry about that

830
00:20:10,339 --> 00:20:10,779
too much.

831
00:20:10,819 --> 00:20:12,529
I'll explain that in how to manage

832
00:20:12,529 --> 00:20:14,029
a client's success in a later

833
00:20:14,029 --> 00:20:14,640
video.

834
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,819
So, yeah, this is pretty much what

835
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:19,039
you want to get nailed down after

836
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:20,170
23 days.

837
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:21,420
Their technical competency, their

838
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:22,720
communication skills, their client

839
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,799
management, their business

840
00:20:23,809 --> 00:20:25,160
understanding, and their strategic

841
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:25,690
thinking.

842
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:27,410
This is just pretty much one you

843
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:29,000
want to have nailed down.

844
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,039
Just these five things.

845
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,049
If they can get these five things

846
00:20:31,049 --> 00:20:32,150
nailed down in 23 days, you've

847
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:32,970
done a phenomenal job.

848
00:20:33,339 --> 00:20:34,869
Even if they're even efficient in

849
00:20:34,869 --> 00:20:36,480
these areas, you've done a great

850
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:37,019
job.

851
00:20:37,059 --> 00:20:38,490
You know, because if they can get

852
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:39,950
up and running this quickly in 23

853
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:41,420
days, they're going to be in a

854
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:42,700
phenomenal position.

855
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:43,950
Because client success management

856
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:45,099
is one of these jobs where you

857
00:20:45,099 --> 00:20:46,039
just have to wear multiple

858
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:46,880
different hats.

859
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:50,450
So, your seven-month kind of

860
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:52,319
mastery timeline here.

861
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,240
This is basically the timeline of,

862
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,980
like, when your CSM should start

863
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:57,740
hitting, like, all sorts of new

864
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:58,660
strengths.

865
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,160
Like, they need to get the basic

866
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,630
functions down and competency

867
00:21:01,819 --> 00:21:02,000
down.

868
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:03,329
They need to get the onboarding

869
00:21:03,329 --> 00:21:04,180
process nailed.

870
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:05,809
Standard communications in terms

871
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:07,299
of, like, whatever channels you

872
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:07,490
use.

873
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:10,180
Again, just a little heads up.

874
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:11,950
If your CSM has to text clients,

875
00:21:12,019 --> 00:21:14,119
email clients, WhatsApp clients,

876
00:21:14,119 --> 00:21:16,160
Slack clients, they're going to be

877
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,069
in for hell.

878
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,230
Just try and get all communication

879
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:19,059
into one channel.

880
00:21:19,099 --> 00:21:20,130
But I'll break that down in

881
00:21:20,299 --> 00:21:20,960
another video.

882
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:22,910
And basic problem identification

883
00:21:23,079 --> 00:21:24,319
of escalation, they should know

884
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:25,769
how to, like, basically identify a

885
00:21:25,769 --> 00:21:27,029
problem and, like, know how to

886
00:21:27,029 --> 00:21:28,029
prevent escalation.

887
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,130
They should be able to do good

888
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:30,339
documentation and reporting.

889
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:31,819
And they should be able to use all

890
00:21:31,819 --> 00:21:32,490
of the tools.

891
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:34,470
You know, success metrics,

892
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:35,920
complete calls without

893
00:21:36,099 --> 00:21:37,099
supervision.

894
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:38,339
That should be done within 23

895
00:21:38,519 --> 00:21:38,799
days.

896
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:40,259
Maintain client satisfaction

897
00:21:40,259 --> 00:21:41,980
scores above an 8 out of 10.

898
00:21:42,019 --> 00:21:43,220
You could do this by just actually

899
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,789
DMing your clients as the founder

900
00:21:44,789 --> 00:21:46,039
of the company and saying,

901
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:47,779
Hey, how's everything going with,

902
00:21:47,779 --> 00:21:49,069
like, Jack, your CSM?

903
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:50,509
How would you rate them out of 1

904
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:51,140
to 10?

905
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,029
Handle routines, issues

906
00:21:53,339 --> 00:21:54,440
independently.

907
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,690
And then meet the documentation

908
00:21:55,859 --> 00:21:57,240
and the communication standards

909
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,619
that you've set out for them.

910
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:00,390
So, month three, months, like,

911
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:02,180
three to six, they should be more

912
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:04,079
advanced in their proficiency.

913
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:05,650
They should have, like, strategic

914
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:07,410
thinking and client conversations.

915
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:08,660
They should have complete conflict

916
00:22:08,839 --> 00:22:10,150
resolution and difficult situation

917
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:10,750
management.

918
00:22:10,849 --> 00:22:12,019
They should be proactive in

919
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:13,750
problem solving and identification

920
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:15,559
and prevention of these problems.

921
00:22:15,619 --> 00:22:17,049
They should be cross-selling and

922
00:22:17,049 --> 00:22:18,880
expansion opportunity recognition,

923
00:22:19,119 --> 00:22:20,789
team collaboration, knowledge

924
00:22:20,789 --> 00:22:21,500
sharing.

925
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,430
Handle complex situations,

926
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:25,380
generate expansion revenue.

927
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:26,450
They should contribute to team

928
00:22:26,619 --> 00:22:28,400
knowledge, and they should be able

929
00:22:28,539 --> 00:22:30,319
to mentor any new members.

930
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:32,240
After month seven, I've seen guys

931
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,240
master the role in seven months.

932
00:22:34,569 --> 00:22:35,500
Sometimes it takes a little bit

933
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:37,250
longer, but typically it's about

934
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,099
seven months.

935
00:22:39,089 --> 00:22:40,910
Like, that's when they should be,

936
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:43,289
like, really high-level expert, a

937
00:22:43,289 --> 00:22:46,319
genuine strategic advisor.

938
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:47,890
They should have taught leadership

939
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:49,119
skills and be able to give you

940
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:50,569
inputs of what's happening in the

941
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:50,900
business,

942
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:51,910
what's happening in the space,

943
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:53,009
what's happening with clients.

944
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:54,400
Like, they have a real pulse on

945
00:22:54,519 --> 00:22:55,799
what's happening in the business

946
00:22:55,799 --> 00:22:57,180
that they can give to the founder

947
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:57,819
to give, like,

948
00:22:58,150 --> 00:22:59,079
opportunities for maybe new

949
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,680
products, new services, new

950
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:02,589
offerings, new packages, new price

951
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:03,430
points that we should be

952
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:04,099
delivering to clients

953
00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:05,359
because, you know, you can be able

954
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:06,509
to work out and have an honest

955
00:23:06,509 --> 00:23:07,730
conversation about, like,

956
00:23:07,829 --> 00:23:09,170
what's the ROI going to be there

957
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:10,279
and involving that.

958
00:23:10,779 --> 00:23:12,000
Like, process innovation, they

959
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,369
should be bringing new ideas to

960
00:23:13,369 --> 00:23:13,819
the fold,

961
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:15,319
and they're actually going to

962
00:23:15,319 --> 00:23:16,740
start having a genuinely really

963
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,740
strong impact into the business in

964
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:20,839
back-end revenue and retention.

965
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:25,940
So, yeah, onboarding, process

966
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:28,279
mastery, communication excellence,

967
00:23:28,279 --> 00:23:29,519
client call execution,

968
00:23:29,569 --> 00:23:30,930
back-end sales understanding,

969
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:32,349
conflict resolution skills, tough

970
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,099
love delivery as well,

971
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:35,779
critical thinking development, and

972
00:23:35,779 --> 00:23:37,480
then strategic advisor excellence.

973
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:39,410
These is going to be kind of

974
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:40,680
across the board here.

975
00:23:41,009 --> 00:23:43,410
This is kind of the roadmap that

976
00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:46,140
you want to have in terms of your

977
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:46,859
CSM.

978
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:48,970
Step one, onboarding mastery.

979
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:50,150
Step two, communication

980
00:23:50,309 --> 00:23:51,039
excellence.

981
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:52,920
Step three, client call execution.

982
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:53,990
Step four, back-end sales

983
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,029
understanding.

984
00:23:55,299 --> 00:23:57,170
Step five, conflict resolution.

985
00:23:57,509 --> 00:23:59,150
Step six, tough love.

986
00:23:59,369 --> 00:24:01,140
Step seven, critical thinking.

987
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,049
And then finally, becoming a full

988
00:24:03,049 --> 00:24:05,019
strategic advisor to your clients

989
00:24:05,059 --> 00:24:06,309
to the point where they don't

990
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,900
really need the founder's input

991
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:08,349
anymore

992
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:09,970
because your CSM is doing such a

993
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:11,549
killer job at giving them good

994
00:24:11,549 --> 00:24:12,920
feedback, ideas, and

995
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,059
implementation strategies

996
00:24:14,299 --> 00:24:15,920
that they're already soaring and

997
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,380
getting a massive ROI.

998
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:22,440
So, implementation frameworks.

999
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,460
Here's your week one checklist.

1000
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:25,720
Week two, week three.

1001
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:28,230
So, SOPs, past knowledge basis

1002
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:31,059
with, you know, past 90% score,

1003
00:24:31,109 --> 00:24:32,579
demonstrate service offering,

1004
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,819
master tech, complete daily

1005
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,410
one-to-one sessions with you, the

1006
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:35,920
manager.

1007
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:38,150
It says total of 10 sessions.

1008
00:24:38,299 --> 00:24:39,019
It should be more.

1009
00:24:39,059 --> 00:24:40,029
That's just a mistype on my

1010
00:24:40,029 --> 00:24:40,529
behalf.

1011
00:24:41,369 --> 00:24:42,130
Document any identifying and

1012
00:24:42,299 --> 00:24:42,799
leaning gaps.

1013
00:24:42,839 --> 00:24:45,220
Analyze, you know, onboarding

1014
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:47,579
calls, breakdown calls, master

1015
00:24:47,579 --> 00:24:49,400
onboarding, successfully complete

1016
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,240
all three mock calls

1017
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:52,609
with, like, a decent rating, like,

1018
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:53,660
you should feel somewhat good

1019
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:54,579
about those mock calls.

1020
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,309
Shatter at least one of the calls,

1021
00:24:56,309 --> 00:24:57,940
complete do's and don'ts Q&A,

1022
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:59,630
conduct a supervised call,

1023
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:01,230
handle client communications,

1024
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:02,930
complete documentation, receive

1025
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:04,059
client satisfaction,

1026
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:05,779
demonstrate readiness and expanded

1027
00:25:05,779 --> 00:25:07,440
responsibilities, complete final

1028
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,180
assessment.

1029
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,069
So, this is all your pre-launch,

1030
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:13,579
tracking and adjustment systems.

1031
00:25:13,619 --> 00:25:15,660
And, yeah, this framework requires

1032
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:17,539
significant time investment.

1033
00:25:17,579 --> 00:25:19,500
You know, you're looking at, here,

1034
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,650
about 40 to 50 hours of intensive

1035
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:23,119
training and practice.

1036
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,900
You need to actually put in the

1037
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,460
time to train your CSM.

1038
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:27,710
Unless you have a client success

1039
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:29,240
team, unless you have other CSMs.

1040
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:30,309
But if this is going to be your

1041
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:31,789
first CSM, you need to buckle up

1042
00:25:31,789 --> 00:25:32,569
and get prepared.

1043
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,539
It is going to do it properly and

1044
00:25:34,539 --> 00:25:36,480
to have actually set this client

1045
00:25:36,519 --> 00:25:37,799
success manager up

1046
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:39,519
for absolute maximum success.

1047
00:25:39,609 --> 00:25:41,630
Yes, over the course of, like,

1048
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,609
three to four weeks, you're going

1049
00:25:43,609 --> 00:25:45,049
to need to invest about 40 hours

1050
00:25:45,059 --> 00:25:45,480
into them.

1051
00:25:45,819 --> 00:25:47,099
Without a doubt.

1052
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:48,609
Because if you don't, you're

1053
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:50,109
setting them up for fail.

1054
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,420
And if they fail, you're going to

1055
00:25:51,539 --> 00:25:52,690
get annoyed that they failed and

1056
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:54,019
you lost customers and you lost

1057
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:54,380
revenue

1058
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:55,390
and you didn't get back-end

1059
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:55,839
growth.

1060
00:25:56,079 --> 00:25:57,519
Like, it all compounds to the

1061
00:25:57,519 --> 00:25:59,180
money at the end of the day.

1062
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:01,279
That's why this role is so

1063
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,960
important to so many businesses

1064
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:04,980
and why it really is the epicenter

1065
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,119
for a lot of companies.

1066
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,559
So don't skip it, your one-to-one

1067
00:26:08,569 --> 00:26:09,460
sessions.

1068
00:26:09,619 --> 00:26:11,230
Don't rush their interactions

1069
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:12,589
before they're solid.

1070
00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:14,470
Don't have inadequate

1071
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:16,140
documentation in your learnings.

1072
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:17,650
And, like, you know, if you feel

1073
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:19,160
like, if you realize that there's

1074
00:26:19,259 --> 00:26:20,650
an SOP missing, you need to make

1075
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:21,779
that SOP very quickly.

1076
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:22,549
You know?

1077
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,309
And, like, don't, like, you know,

1078
00:26:24,309 --> 00:26:25,589
give insufficient practice

1079
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:27,130
opportunities before live client

1080
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:27,980
interaction.

1081
00:26:28,359 --> 00:26:29,670
Like, don't skip out on any of

1082
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:30,579
these steps.

1083
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:32,160
Because if you do, you're just

1084
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,400
screwing them over.

1085
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,250
And if they screw you over,

1086
00:26:34,339 --> 00:26:35,170
they're screwing the business

1087
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:35,509
over.

1088
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,849
It's very straightforward.

1089
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:38,150
So just make sure that you

1090
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:39,789
actually are willing to put in

1091
00:26:40,039 --> 00:26:40,380
this time.

1092
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:42,140
Or you have a team member in the

1093
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:43,960
company that can give them this

1094
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:44,579
time.

1095
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:47,440
So this focus approach eliminates

1096
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:49,779
the trial and error learning

1097
00:26:49,829 --> 00:26:52,960
because that's why most CSMs fail.

1098
00:26:53,269 --> 00:26:54,579
Master onboarding and kind of go

1099
00:26:54,579 --> 00:26:55,309
from there.

1100
00:26:55,359 --> 00:26:56,990
So, yeah, accelerated time to

1101
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:57,430
value.

1102
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,230
Reduced failure rate.

1103
00:26:59,549 --> 00:27:00,519
Higher client satisfaction.

1104
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:02,349
And team excellence and culture.

1105
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:04,319
So, document everything while

1106
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:06,529
you're doing this process, too, so

1107
00:27:06,529 --> 00:27:08,579
that you can, like, you know,

1108
00:27:08,579 --> 00:27:09,940
include it back in.

1109
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:11,819
Loop it back in for the next CSM.

1110
00:27:12,029 --> 00:27:13,930
Refine continuously again.

1111
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:15,869
So after you've, like, onboarded

1112
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:17,130
this CSM, look back.

1113
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:18,650
Give yourself some retrospect

1114
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:19,099
here.

1115
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,369
How are you going to improve this

1116
00:27:20,519 --> 00:27:21,500
process next time?

1117
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:22,569
You're not going to get it perfect

1118
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:23,269
the first time.

1119
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:24,019
No one ever does.

1120
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:25,079
That's absolutely fine.

1121
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,140
But as long as if you can follow

1122
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:27,339
this guide, you're actually going

1123
00:27:27,339 --> 00:27:28,119
to be half decent.

1124
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,450
You know, how are you going to

1125
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:30,420
extend the approach?

1126
00:27:30,539 --> 00:27:31,569
You know, you know, how are you

1127
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:32,839
going to, you need to make sure

1128
00:27:32,839 --> 00:27:34,000
that you stick with this for the

1129
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:35,069
seven month timeline.

1130
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:36,339
And then, you know, you need to

1131
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:37,920
measure and celebrate the success.

1132
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,630
You know, track key metrics like,

1133
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:41,250
you know, time to productivity and

1134
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,500
client satisfaction.

1135
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:44,730
And then just thank them, like,

1136
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:46,279
give them a pat on the back.

1137
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:47,349
Tell them they're doing amazing.

1138
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,500
Like, keep encouraging them.

1139
00:27:49,539 --> 00:27:50,740
Keep giving them the confidence.

1140
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:52,509
CSMs, when they first join,

1141
00:27:52,509 --> 00:27:54,549
especially the first CSM, is very

1142
00:27:54,549 --> 00:27:56,230
nervous and is very unsure if

1143
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:58,200
they're doing the job properly or

1144
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,809
inadequately in any sort of

1145
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:00,759
capacity.

1146
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,119
So, by giving them the reassurance

1147
00:28:02,299 --> 00:28:03,250
that they're on the right track

1148
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:04,210
and they're doing all the right

1149
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,299
things and giving them that

1150
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:06,970
constructive criticism, but with,

1151
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:08,450
again, the compliment, that's

1152
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:09,920
really, really important.

1153
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,400
For every piece of, like,

1154
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,250
constructive criticism you need to

1155
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,690
give to a CSM or really any

1156
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:16,289
employee, you should also be

1157
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:17,660
bolstering them up with a

1158
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:18,619
compliment.

1159
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:19,930
You need to meet your pair in pair

1160
00:28:20,089 --> 00:28:21,359
because if you keep coming to them

1161
00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:22,779
with constant criticisms, they're

1162
00:28:22,779 --> 00:28:23,960
just going to feel like they're

1163
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,230
inadequate at the job and they're

1164
00:28:25,349 --> 00:28:26,220
going to already feel like

1165
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:27,400
throwing in the towel because,

1166
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:28,720
like, I'm obviously not a fit in

1167
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:29,339
here.

1168
00:28:29,539 --> 00:28:32,670
So, that's pretty much that.

1169
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:33,559
Remember, follow this.

1170
00:28:33,599 --> 00:28:34,799
New CSMs must master your

1171
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,059
onboarding process.

1172
00:28:36,299 --> 00:28:37,640
That's my final tidbit.

1173
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:39,400
Yeah, I hope you found this

1174
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,119
useful.

1175
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,059
I hope you now understand how to

1176
00:28:42,059 --> 00:28:43,140
onboard a CSM.

1177
00:28:43,269 --> 00:28:45,119
And this is my personal best way

1178
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:47,160
to do it in 23 days or less.

1179
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:48,039
All right.

1180
00:28:48,039 --> 00:28:49,920
See you later in the next video.

1181
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:50,359
Peace.
