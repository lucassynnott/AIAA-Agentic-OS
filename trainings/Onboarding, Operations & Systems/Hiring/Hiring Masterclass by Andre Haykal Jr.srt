1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:01,690
All right i strategically placed

2
00:00:01,690 --> 00:00:03,069
the open bar right before my

3
00:00:03,069 --> 00:00:03,589
presentation

4
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:05,929
for a reason so hopefully this

5
00:00:05,929 --> 00:00:08,550
works out um but anyways i got a

6
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,160
hiring master class for you guys

7
00:00:10,289 --> 00:00:12,169
uh number one question i get from

8
00:00:12,169 --> 00:00:13,800
all of you guys in olympia is

9
00:00:14,189 --> 00:00:16,079
essentially how to hire where to

10
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:17,829
hire from what to do when you hire

11
00:00:17,829 --> 00:00:19,500
someone how to know if they need

12
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,960
to be fired how to know if they

13
00:00:21,089 --> 00:00:22,500
need to be promoted how to manage

14
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:23,730
them on a day-to-day and so

15
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:25,199
hopefully i'll cover all the

16
00:00:25,329 --> 00:00:26,739
questions uh in today's

17
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:28,969
presentation so uh your path to

18
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:31,280
scale so all day today you heard

19
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:31,839
from dan

20
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:33,679
christian and daniel on the

21
00:00:33,689 --> 00:00:35,640
marketing and sales systems that

22
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,420
drive our businesses growth but

23
00:00:38,609 --> 00:00:40,250
those systems only scale as far as

24
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:41,969
your fulfillment systems allow

25
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:43,759
them to there's like the biggest

26
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:45,299
missing piece that i've seen in

27
00:00:45,409 --> 00:00:47,130
any info marketer business or any

28
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:49,039
business that comes from the money

29
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:50,780
twitter space is they're really

30
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:52,439
good at sales and marketing but

31
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:53,920
they can't figure it on the

32
00:00:54,049 --> 00:00:55,719
fulfillment side and so today

33
00:00:55,799 --> 00:00:57,520
we're going to go over key mindset

34
00:00:57,950 --> 00:00:59,439
shifts you have to make as a

35
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:01,390
business owner to go from player

36
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:03,259
to coach why hiring a players is

37
00:01:03,469 --> 00:01:05,760
the ultimate growth lever the

38
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,079
framework

39
00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:08,349
to hire manage and retain a

40
00:01:08,349 --> 00:01:10,170
players and then common hiring

41
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:11,760
mistakes to avoid

42
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:13,769
and so first action item this is

43
00:01:13,769 --> 00:01:15,939
going to be like super actionable

44
00:01:15,939 --> 00:01:17,519
i think there's six of these

45
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:18,319
slides

46
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:19,909
um the first one is to just get

47
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:21,670
clarity on where to start so the

48
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:23,189
first question you might be asking

49
00:01:23,349 --> 00:01:23,359
is

50
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:25,810
what do i hire for who do i hire

51
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:28,549
and so to answer this question we

52
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:31,049
first have to understand why

53
00:01:31,329 --> 00:01:33,439
we as business owners and ceos

54
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:35,680
need to hire and so the reason you

55
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,840
need to hire is to simply protect

56
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:40,519
your energy buy back your time so

57
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:42,790
that the business can scale um and

58
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:44,849
so that with that said uh we're

59
00:01:44,849 --> 00:01:44,959
going

60
00:01:45,459 --> 00:01:46,519
to spend a couple of minutes

61
00:01:46,579 --> 00:01:47,840
answering and brain dumping on

62
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:49,599
these first two questions which is

63
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:49,829
one

64
00:01:49,969 --> 00:01:51,920
what do i currently do in my

65
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,549
business that gives me energy also

66
00:01:54,549 --> 00:01:55,959
known as like what you actually

67
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:56,400
enjoy

68
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:58,409
doing in your business and then

69
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:00,319
two what do you currently do in

70
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:02,400
your business that drains your

71
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:02,879
energy and

72
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:05,000
that you absolutely hate to do and

73
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,480
so just spend a couple minutes

74
00:02:06,909 --> 00:02:08,849
writing those things down all

75
00:02:08,849 --> 00:02:10,159
right evan what do you got bro

76
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:12,509
uh draining energy definitely

77
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:15,199
meeting with clients uh vendor

78
00:02:15,229 --> 00:02:17,800

79
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:18,800

like firing and we're resetting

91
00:02:44,949 --> 00:02:47,189
expectations you just have to hold

92
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,000
someone a little bit more

93
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,159

113
00:03:36,969 --> 00:03:37,000
sales though is uh like a protocol

114
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,120
so they're they're just like take

115
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:37,590
my money

116
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:40,060
it's pretty nice making content

117
00:03:40,169 --> 00:03:43,599
hiring and managing people and

118
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:48,240
people solid awesome well a major

119
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,439
thing you guys said is like client

120
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:51,919
communications fulfillment getting

121
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:52,800
on client calls

122
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:54,240
that's one of the most common

123
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,620
roles that we hire for at the

124
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,520
different companies uh i actually

125
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:57,680
have

126
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:58,990
scorecards for and examples for in

127
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,370
this presentation but the reason i

128
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:01,759
have you guys do this

129
00:04:01,849 --> 00:04:02,830
is because a lot of you go into

130
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:05,069
the hiring step of this overall

131
00:04:05,069 --> 00:04:05,840
process

132
00:04:05,969 --> 00:04:08,289
not knowing like what to actually

133
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:10,620
focus on um and hiring takes a lot

134
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:11,960
of time and effort just like

135
00:04:12,129 --> 00:04:13,750
creating a new offer does and so

136
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,599
you might as well get clarity on

137
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:16,879
what's worth hiring for

138
00:04:17,009 --> 00:04:18,189
immediately rather than

139
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:20,139
approaching it having no idea what

140
00:04:20,139 --> 00:04:22,720
you're doing and so uh the five

141
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:23,360
steps of a

142
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:25,069
winning hiring strategy and also

143
00:04:25,069 --> 00:04:26,689
keep that list that you guys have

144
00:04:26,689 --> 00:04:28,240
of what you don't like doing

145
00:04:28,389 --> 00:04:28,399
because

146
00:04:28,529 --> 00:04:29,449
those are all the different roles

147
00:04:29,449 --> 00:04:30,459
you're eventually going to hire

148
00:04:30,459 --> 00:04:32,399
for um but the five steps of a

149
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:32,870
winning hiring

150
00:04:33,089 --> 00:04:34,759
strategy so the first is uh well

151
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:36,959
the steps to hire management 10 a

152
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:40,600
players as follows one offer two

153
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:42,079
traffic three

154
00:04:42,209 --> 00:04:45,089
onboarding four retention and five

155
00:04:45,089 --> 00:04:47,370
expansion so does this sound

156
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,279
familiar to you guys

157
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:53,360
it's the same thing as selling an

158
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,910
offer hiring someone into your

159
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:58,079
organization is the same thing

160
00:04:58,209 --> 00:04:59,879
as selling someone your services

161
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:01,569
and actually fulfilling your

162
00:05:01,569 --> 00:05:03,360
services and i'm going to break

163
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,079
this down

164
00:05:04,189 --> 00:05:05,389
to show you more in depth what

165
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,069
each of those steps actually looks

166
00:05:07,069 --> 00:05:09,839
like and so step number one is you

167
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:12,110
have to sell the role like you

168
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:14,439
sell your offer and so here's a

169
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:17,120
couple of ways on how to hire or

170
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:17,360
sorry

171
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:18,670
how to position your job

172
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:20,560
opportunity as a compelling offer

173
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:22,560
that actually attracts a players

174
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,680
uh so the first

175
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:25,639
thing is to create and define your

176
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:27,250
umbrella vision so this is a

177
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:30,009
concept i learned from patrick bet

178
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:30,319
david

179
00:05:31,649 --> 00:05:33,490
your umbrella vision is your

180
00:05:33,509 --> 00:05:35,579
company's overall vision and

181
00:05:35,579 --> 00:05:37,490
mission and the way that you

182
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:38,149
attract

183
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:40,220
high level a players into your

184
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:42,529
organization is to have a mission

185
00:05:42,529 --> 00:05:44,639
big enough whereas someone else's

186
00:05:44,769 --> 00:05:46,170
mission or vision can fit within

187
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:47,839
that quote-unquote umbrella and so

188
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:49,519
at client ascension we have this

189
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:51,480
massive coaching organization that

190
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,139
other coaches that are doing their

191
00:05:53,509 --> 00:05:55,279
own really cool things outside of

192
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:56,819
our organization with their own

193
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:58,430
offers with their own coaching

194
00:05:58,529 --> 00:05:59,990
with their own info products

195
00:06:00,209 --> 00:06:01,680
could play a role within our

196
00:06:01,689 --> 00:06:03,279
overall ecosystem which is

197
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:05,279
basically online education for

198
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:06,720
business owners

199
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:08,600
and entrepreneurs and so you want

200
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,279
to have some sort of an umbrella

201
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:12,000
vision like you as a leader and as

202
00:06:12,069 --> 00:06:13,610
a ceo you have to sell future

203
00:06:13,649 --> 00:06:15,560
talent on where you're going and

204
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,680
what you're building and that has

205
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:17,829
to

206
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:19,339
excite them there's also the

207
00:06:19,339 --> 00:06:20,889
reason why elon musk is able to

208
00:06:20,889 --> 00:06:22,560
attract the best talent in the

209
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:22,879
world

210
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:25,089
every turn of the way because he's

211
00:06:25,129 --> 00:06:26,600
working on the coolest he's

212
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:28,470
building rockets and sending

213
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:28,720
people

214
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:30,269
to mars and so like that's an

215
00:06:30,329 --> 00:06:32,279
umbrella vision that even if some

216
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:34,000
person within that umbrella vision

217
00:06:34,209 --> 00:06:35,209
just wants to be a part of

218
00:06:35,209 --> 00:06:36,759
building the rocket or doing the

219
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:38,399
radars or doing the underground

220
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:38,550
tunnels

221
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:40,259
whatever it might be he's able to

222
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:42,009
attract that talent because his

223
00:06:42,009 --> 00:06:45,360
vision is so big okay the second

224
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:45,519
is

225
00:06:45,649 --> 00:06:47,480
use a hiring scorecard instead of

226
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:49,120
a job description and on this

227
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:51,360
second slide here i'll go into the

228
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:51,639
next

229
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:52,990
action item which is going to be

230
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,310
to work on a hiring scorecard

231
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:55,920
who's familiar with this concept

232
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,160
of hiring

233
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:56,879
scorecards

234
00:06:57,009 --> 00:06:59,860
just a couple of you guys okay so

235
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:02,879
hiring scorecard is just a really

236
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:06,000
easily digestible understanding of

237
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,139
what

238
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:07,639
you're hiring for uh you see all

239
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:08,629
the time like these job

240
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:10,879
descriptions on linkedin uh that

241
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:11,279
really look

242
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:12,829
like they're just written by chat

243
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:14,379
gpt they don't really speak to you

244
00:07:14,379 --> 00:07:15,750
the same way you would skip over

245
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:17,389
an offer or an ad or a vsl that

246
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:19,329
just sounds like a bunch of fluff

247
00:07:19,329 --> 00:07:21,120
and so your hiring scorecard

248
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,670
should be approached and written

249
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,240
the same way you'd write your ads

250
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,410
or your vsl um or really just any

251
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:26,709
of

252
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:28,769
your content on the marketing side

253
00:07:28,769 --> 00:07:30,750
um my favorite on this entire list

254
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,560
is number three which is designing

255
00:07:32,629 --> 00:07:32,629
a

256
00:07:32,769 --> 00:07:34,819
performance-based compensation

257
00:07:34,819 --> 00:07:36,759
package how many of you guys pay

258
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:38,879
your guys hourly or base pay only

259
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:41,610
a lot of you i don't have a single

260
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:43,740
team member at any of the

261
00:07:43,949 --> 00:07:45,199
organizations

262
00:07:45,329 --> 00:07:46,329
which i think at this point we

263
00:07:46,329 --> 00:07:47,550
have at least over 60 people

264
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:49,439
working with us that are hourly or

265
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:49,939
base

266
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:52,470
only um it's every single team

267
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:54,879
member in the organization is

268
00:07:55,189 --> 00:07:57,439
performance-based pay the same way

269
00:07:57,569 --> 00:07:59,050
you hire a salesperson and pay

270
00:07:59,089 --> 00:08:01,040
them 10 commissions is the same

271
00:08:01,069 --> 00:08:02,730
way you hire a customer success

272
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:03,279
person

273
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:04,129
and i'll get into what that

274
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:06,089
actually looks like um the the the

275
00:08:06,089 --> 00:08:08,600
next one here is teasing future

276
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:10,370
leadership opportunities so to

277
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:11,810
attract an a player you have to

278
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:13,279
understand that a players like

279
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:13,750
more

280
00:08:13,889 --> 00:08:15,879
responsibility they like having a

281
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:17,250
bigger role within the

282
00:08:17,269 --> 00:08:19,040
organization and so you want to

283
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:19,680
show them

284
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:21,370
what that could look like when

285
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:23,240
you're hiring a closer if you feel

286
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,879
like this person can be an a

287
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:24,970
player

288
00:08:25,329 --> 00:08:26,730
within your organization you

289
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:28,250
should tease to them that they

290
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,000
could potentially be leading your

291
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:30,399
entire

292
00:08:30,529 --> 00:08:31,709
team of closers one day and that's

293
00:08:31,709 --> 00:08:32,700
where you want to get them

294
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,000
especially if that's something

295
00:08:34,149 --> 00:08:34,559
that they

296
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:36,360
show interest in when you ask this

297
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,179
question great example of this is

298
00:08:38,259 --> 00:08:40,240
when we first hired a setter way

299
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:41,509
back in the day and i asked him

300
00:08:41,509 --> 00:08:42,879
the question of like what is his

301
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:44,399
future at this company look like

302
00:08:44,529 --> 00:08:46,179
ideally rather than saying he

303
00:08:46,179 --> 00:08:48,000
wanted to go from being a setter

304
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,600
to a closer he said he wanted to

305
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:49,759
run the

306
00:08:50,049 --> 00:08:51,230
setter's team one day and to me

307
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,779
that was the biggest green flag we

308
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,389
could look for uh and we

309
00:08:54,529 --> 00:08:55,950
hired him and he's still with us

310
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:57,250
today um and then share team

311
00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:00,879
member testimonials uh just like i

312
00:09:01,009 --> 00:09:02,549
think it's glassdoor is the the

313
00:09:02,549 --> 00:09:04,169
main software and this is like

314
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:06,080
used in brick and mortar and b2b

315
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:06,149
it's

316
00:09:06,289 --> 00:09:07,460
kind of old school but like

317
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:09,009
testimonials work the same way

318
00:09:09,009 --> 00:09:10,480
they do on the uh sales and

319
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:10,870
marketing

320
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:13,169
side like show that people enjoy

321
00:09:13,169 --> 00:09:15,590
working for you and your business

322
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:16,710
and actually use those in the

323
00:09:16,789 --> 00:09:17,519
hiring process

324
00:09:17,649 --> 00:09:19,690
um and then the next uh bonus tip

325
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:21,610
here is kind of stupid but it

326
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:24,159
actually does work is get creative

327
00:09:24,289 --> 00:09:25,649
with job titles um this is why

328
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:27,240
it's kind of hard to answer your

329
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:28,879
guys questions sometimes because

330
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:29,039
you're

331
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:30,100
like i'm trying to hire an

332
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,509
operations manager but like your

333
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:32,639
definition of an operations

334
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:33,360
manager might

335
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,870
be way different than mine and

336
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:36,629
like this scorecard example on the

337
00:09:36,629 --> 00:09:39,039
next slide i i promise you not a

338
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:39,360
single

339
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:41,159
person here has one of these roles

340
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,750
which is a cold email systems

341
00:09:42,769 --> 00:09:44,649
engineer like how cool does that

342
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:45,200
sound

343
00:09:46,529 --> 00:09:48,169
cold email systems engineer like

344
00:09:48,169 --> 00:09:50,000
people get super excited when they

345
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,679
see that as their job title like

346
00:09:51,809 --> 00:09:53,470
they seriously do i had one guy uh

347
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:55,120
his name is waleed he's in this

348
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,720
role now he's like dude i just

349
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:56,960
went

350
00:09:57,090 --> 00:09:58,470
from being an engineer to this

351
00:09:58,470 --> 00:09:59,929
this is way cooler instead of

352
00:09:59,929 --> 00:10:01,549
onboarding specialist which was

353
00:10:01,659 --> 00:10:02,250
his original

354
00:10:02,529 --> 00:10:04,169
role so all i did was i changed

355
00:10:04,169 --> 00:10:06,000
the job role to cold email systems

356
00:10:06,429 --> 00:10:07,679
engineer and he had way more

357
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:08,639
buy-in and

358
00:10:08,769 --> 00:10:10,929
way more excitement about what he

359
00:10:10,929 --> 00:10:13,110
signed up to do at our company and

360
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:15,279
so uh action item number two you

361
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:15,509
can't

362
00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:17,070
really do this uh while we're here

363
00:10:17,129 --> 00:10:18,519
because it's going to take a lot

364
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:19,919
longer than the time we have

365
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:21,470
um but this is an action item for

366
00:10:21,529 --> 00:10:22,919
you guys to take home with you

367
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:24,389
which is to create your first

368
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:24,870
hiring

369
00:10:25,009 --> 00:10:27,220
scorecard can you guys see like

370
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:29,350
the words on here it's kind of

371
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:31,840
small decent amount i'll send the

372
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:32,240
slides

373
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:33,940
after anyways um but your

374
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:36,129
scorecard really as simple as uh

375
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:38,370
there's there's three sections

376
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:38,720
there's the

377
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:40,029
mission for the role which is

378
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,580
almost like your hook the core

379
00:10:41,659 --> 00:10:43,460
responsibilities and a detailed

380
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:44,480
breakdown of what

381
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:46,269
goes into those and then your

382
00:10:46,269 --> 00:10:48,240
position description and so this

383
00:10:48,509 --> 00:10:50,600
is like the modern take on a job

384
00:10:50,769 --> 00:10:51,799
description it's a hiring

385
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,190

395
00:11:05,649 --> 00:11:07,049
core responsibilities like

396
00:11:07,049 --> 00:11:08,909
minimizing churn daily execution

397
00:11:08,909 --> 00:11:10,470
of team and admin task and then it

398
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:10,960
goes through the

399
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:12,379
the description that does a

400
00:11:12,379 --> 00:11:13,669
breakdown of the time the

401
00:11:13,669 --> 00:11:15,320
compensation and then as you can

402
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:15,909
see there

403
00:11:16,049 --> 00:11:18,240
bonuses and so let's just focus on

404
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,570
compensation real quick we have a

405
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:23,440
1500 base pay for someone in this

406
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:25,889
role in addition to the base pay

407
00:11:25,889 --> 00:11:28,250
they get bonuses if you add up all

408
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:31,080
those bonuses that's an additional

409
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:32,809
two thousand dollars in bonuses so

410
00:11:32,809 --> 00:11:34,110
they can more than double their

411
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,600
base pay if they were to hit every

412
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:35,830
single

413
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:37,279
bonus in any given month which is

414
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,559
super exciting than a player

415
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:39,659
because they like to be

416
00:11:39,809 --> 00:11:42,639
paid and rated based on the actual

417
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:44,720
value they provide to your company

418
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,320
and so bonuses that you

419
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:47,870
can use for an onboarding

420
00:11:47,929 --> 00:11:49,659
specialist or a csm or more of a

421
00:11:49,659 --> 00:11:51,639
cs type role within your company

422
00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:52,240
are

423
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:54,419
if your churn rates 10 or lower

424
00:11:54,419 --> 00:11:56,350
and you can also tier it so we pay

425
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:58,870
250 for churn being lower than 10

426
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:00,899
and then an additional 500 if

427
00:12:00,899 --> 00:12:02,860
churns lower than five percent uh

428
00:12:02,909 --> 00:12:04,710
you heard daniel talk about this

429
00:12:04,789 --> 00:12:05,200
concept

430
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:08,539
called nrr we compensate them 250

431
00:12:08,539 --> 00:12:11,840
if it's above 90 and 500 if it's

432
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,240
above 95 and so if they were to

433
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:14,879
hit

434
00:12:15,009 --> 00:12:16,389
all four of those bonuses they

435
00:12:16,389 --> 00:12:18,080
just doubled their base pay and

436
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,830
they're super excited and the

437
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:20,159
first

438
00:12:20,289 --> 00:12:21,960
time that they hit those bonuses i

439
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:23,519
promise you it's not the last

440
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,360
because they're addicted at that

441
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:25,450
point

442
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,070
it's just like a salesperson

443
00:12:27,159 --> 00:12:28,610
getting that first commissions

444
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,000
check and realizing what it

445
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,230
actually

446
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:31,549
means to go out and close deals

447
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:33,830
for the company some other bonuses

448
00:12:34,269 --> 00:12:37,200
that we do is average time to

449
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:37,870
fulfill

450
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:39,230
and so we pay them a bonus if the

451
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,779
average days for them to launch a

452
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,039
client's campaigns is 10 or less

453
00:12:43,169 --> 00:12:44,519
after the onboarding call so let's

454
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:45,899
make sure that clients are moving

455
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:47,440
through the fulfillment system

456
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:49,100
and that last one is one of my

457
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,590
favorites it's to protect

458
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:52,320
ourselves against people that

459
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:52,559
don't

460
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:54,629
show up on a daily basis it's 250

461
00:12:54,629 --> 00:12:57,029
dollars paid only if you have over

462
00:12:57,259 --> 00:13:00,000
110 county calls completed

463
00:13:00,129 --> 00:13:01,309
and dan i don't know if you went

464
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:03,070
into this in your presentation but

465
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,320
we do a similar thing with

466
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,059
sales people even rather than just

467
00:13:06,059 --> 00:13:07,909
paying them 10 sales commissions

468
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:09,600
we tear it they get started right

469
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:11,070
at seven percent but they unlock

470
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:12,379
another percent if they have

471
00:13:12,379 --> 00:13:13,840
enough calls on calendar if they

472
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,320
do enough

473
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:15,929
follow-ups if they're using their

474
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:17,389
their crm if they're attending

475
00:13:17,389 --> 00:13:18,789
team meetings if they're filling

476
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:20,509
out the end of day type forms so

477
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:22,019
whatever actions you want to

478
00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:23,549
incentivize for is what you want

479
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:24,000
to bake

480
00:13:24,129 --> 00:13:33,259
after so i'll go into the actual

481
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:39,429
like hiring steps uh the scorecard

482
00:13:39,429 --> 00:13:42,000
itself is only used up into the

483
00:13:42,129 --> 00:13:43,759
point of the position description

484
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:45,399
the position description is the

485
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:47,320
thing you pretty much gatekeep

486
00:13:47,649 --> 00:13:49,409
until the very last interview and

487
00:13:49,409 --> 00:13:50,879
i'll go more into what that

488
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:52,799
interview actually looks like go

489
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:53,110
ahead

490
00:13:53,250 --> 00:14:02,379
yeah yeah because it stands out

491
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:04,220
and you can put in like the

492
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:06,080
description and wherever else in

493
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:06,320
there

494
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:07,799
like onboarding specialist or

495
00:14:07,799 --> 00:14:09,330
customer success so it'll still

496
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:11,120
show up in a search but like

497
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:11,519
imagine

498
00:14:11,649 --> 00:14:12,769
someone searching for a customer

499
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:13,870

505
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:23,669
immediately right it's almost like

506
00:14:23,669 --> 00:14:24,590
a unique mechanism on the

507
00:14:24,679 --> 00:14:25,750
marketing and sales side

508
00:14:25,889 --> 00:14:28,950
um a company that does this really

509
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:31,600
well that i was doing it before

510
00:14:31,669 --> 00:14:33,120
but it kind of validated

511
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:35,879
why this works or that it works is

512
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:37,919
clay you guys familiar with clay

513
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:39,919

i promise you you've never seen

521
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:51,600
those

522
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:54,059
job titles at any other company

523
00:14:54,169 --> 00:14:56,549

these job titles before and

527
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:02,480
they've essentially built an

528
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,909
entire brand around it i was

529
00:15:04,139 --> 00:15:05,120
reading a blog post

530
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:06,539
from clay talking about why

531
00:15:06,539 --> 00:15:08,259
go-to-market engineers are like

532
00:15:08,259 --> 00:15:11,200
the new account executives and

533
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:11,679
what that's

534
00:15:11,809 --> 00:15:13,230
doing for their growth is pretty

535
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:15,240
insane they just raised at a 1.25

536
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,440
billion valuation and so the

537
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:17,759
biggest

538
00:15:17,889 --> 00:15:20,019
companies are doing this not just

539
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:22,190
uh the ones on money twitter okay

540
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:24,320
any questions on the scorecard

541
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:24,399
before

542
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:30,399
we move on go ahead um so like

543
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:31,919
this is for the overall company

544
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:32,960
performance so at the end of the

545
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:34,509
month i go into our dashboard and

546
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:35,809
see what the churn rate is and

547
00:15:35,899 --> 00:15:37,360
what the nr is those numbers are

548
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:37,440
really

549
00:15:37,649 --> 00:15:39,070
easily accessible on the average

550
00:15:39,129 --> 00:15:40,590
days to launch after onboarding

551
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,840
call we have that set up in

552
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,399
hubspot

553
00:15:42,529 --> 00:15:44,149
on a per rep basis easy to check

554
00:15:44,149 --> 00:15:46,019
and then on the last one calendly

555
00:15:46,039 --> 00:15:48,240
it's in the calendly analytics

556
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:49,690
but the important thing and i'll

557
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:51,379
go into it more in the rest of the

558
00:15:51,379 --> 00:15:53,120
presentation is don't wait until

559
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:54,789
the end of the month to show them

560
00:15:54,789 --> 00:15:56,649
their performance you want them to

561
00:15:56,649 --> 00:15:58,399
know their performance at least

562
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,710
on a weekly basis so that they can

563
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:01,149
do things throughout the month to

564
00:16:01,149 --> 00:16:01,470
improve

565
00:16:01,649 --> 00:16:06,370
anyone else all right we'll keep

566
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:09,600
it moving okay so the second piece

567
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,440
of it then is traffic right

568
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:13,240
so the goal of traffic is to get

569
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,000
as many candidates into your

570
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,799
hiring funnel uh one of the

571
00:16:17,149 --> 00:16:18,000
biggest mistakes i

572
00:16:18,129 --> 00:16:20,600
see everyone here including myself

573
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,320
make when it comes to hiring is

574
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:26,159
you hire someone that you really

575
00:16:26,289 --> 00:16:27,629
shouldn't have hired and the only

576
00:16:27,629 --> 00:16:29,009
reason you do that is because you

577
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,480
didn't have enough candidates

578
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:31,789
to choose from in the first place

579
00:16:31,879 --> 00:16:33,139
and so if you don't have enough

580
00:16:33,139 --> 00:16:34,950
candidates this is the slide

581
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:35,279
that's

582
00:16:35,409 --> 00:16:36,720
going to help you fill that

583
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,139
pipeline and so hiring is a

584
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:40,070
numbers game the same way you need

585
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:40,559
to send

586
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:42,100
thousands of cold emails and do

587
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:44,169
dream 100 outreach you need to

588
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:45,710
drive traffic using various

589
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:46,389
channels to

590
00:16:46,529 --> 00:16:47,909
build a consistent pipeline of

591
00:16:47,909 --> 00:16:49,519
potential a players and so here's

592
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:51,110
kind of like my order of priority

593
00:16:51,429 --> 00:16:51,519
first

594
00:16:51,649 --> 00:16:53,549
place i go to is i ask my clients

595
00:16:53,549 --> 00:16:55,929
my existing team members and close

596
00:16:55,929 --> 00:16:58,159
industry peers for referrals at

597
00:16:58,159 --> 00:16:58,159
this

598
00:16:58,529 --> 00:17:00,210
point i never really have to go

599
00:17:00,279 --> 00:17:02,159
past this first step because i

600
00:17:02,419 --> 00:17:04,160
have so many clients so many team

601
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:05,950
members and so many industry peers

602
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:07,480
and i know a lot of you guys have

603
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,109
that as well so it's very rare

604
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:09,279
that

605
00:17:09,348 --> 00:17:11,049
i even have to move past that

606
00:17:11,049 --> 00:17:13,130
first step the second step if you

607
00:17:13,309 --> 00:17:15,619
don't find your ideal fit or an a

608
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:15,920
player

609
00:17:16,289 --> 00:17:17,960
through those sources is to post

610
00:17:18,039 --> 00:17:19,759
on your social media in your email

611
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:21,480
list this is like to me the most

612
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:23,818
underrated reason for building a

613
00:17:23,818 --> 00:17:25,650
personal brand is to attract a

614
00:17:25,789 --> 00:17:27,440
player quality talent to your

615
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,318
company

616
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,920
it's not to get clients it's not

617
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:31,619
to you know have authority in the

618
00:17:31,619 --> 00:17:34,150
industry it's to get people to

619
00:17:34,289 --> 00:17:35,880
respect you enough and to look up

620
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,579
to you enough to just want to come

621
00:17:37,579 --> 00:17:39,440
work for you like gary v probably

622
00:17:39,569 --> 00:17:41,529
has dms full of people that just

623
00:17:41,529 --> 00:17:43,700
want to go work for him literally

624
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,920
for free there's people out there

625
00:17:46,039 --> 00:17:47,460
it was me actually a couple years

626
00:17:47,569 --> 00:17:49,279
ago that would drop everything to

627
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:51,599
just go work for gary v for free

628
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:52,599
and so that's the type of

629
00:17:52,599 --> 00:17:54,029
authority you're trying to build

630
00:17:54,029 --> 00:17:55,359
through your personal brand

631
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:57,160
and you could do that through your

632
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,960
email list and wherever wherever

633
00:17:59,289 --> 00:18:00,670
else you've built an audience

634
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:02,950
if you still can't find enough

635
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:05,279
candidates the next place to go is

636
00:18:05,349 --> 00:18:07,359
to find niche communities

637
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:09,599
to share the opportunity with so i

638
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:11,599
can't tell you how many people

639
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:13,480
have successfully found an a

640
00:18:13,569 --> 00:18:14,000
player

641
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:16,539
by posting in client ascension's

642
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:19,309
opportunities channel that simple

643
00:18:19,309 --> 00:18:21,359
and once you have the offer

644
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:22,670
right once you have the scorecard

645
00:18:22,759 --> 00:18:24,009
created and you know exactly what

646
00:18:24,009 --> 00:18:24,799
you're hiring for

647
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:26,960
you can just put it anywhere it's

648
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,119
like the same thing when you have

649
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:30,920
an offer or vsl or a landing page

650
00:18:31,089 --> 00:18:32,759
it doesn't take much more effort

651
00:18:32,759 --> 00:18:34,440
to send it through cold emails

652
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:35,670
dream 100

653
00:18:35,809 --> 00:18:37,470
post it on tick tock email your

654
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:39,269
list it's just you just send it

655
00:18:39,269 --> 00:18:41,440
everywhere uh and so that's

656
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:41,799
exactly

657
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:43,150
what you're doing here uh with

658
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,839
finding niche communities to share

659
00:18:44,839 --> 00:18:45,839
the opportunity with

660
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:46,960
whether it's client ascension or

661
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,970
something else the next step that

662
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:51,430
i usually like to go to if i still

663
00:18:51,569 --> 00:18:53,400
haven't found enough candidates is

664
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:55,059
to pay a recruiting agency um my

665
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:57,200
background is is that my dad is

666
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:57,269
from

667
00:18:57,410 --> 00:18:59,089
lebanon so i'm lebanese and so

668
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,900
i've found uh this niche uh to

669
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,200
hire from people in lebanon uh

670
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:03,839
it's really

671
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:05,390
similar to the amount you'd have

672
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:06,980
to pay someone in the philippines

673
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:08,319
or in latin america but i've

674
00:19:08,529 --> 00:19:10,460
just found the quality to be a lot

675
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:12,000
better and it's also a good

676
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:14,079
feeling to give back to where my

677
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:14,400
dad is

678
00:19:14,529 --> 00:19:15,930
from but a lot of people are

679
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:17,970
having success hiring from lebanon

680
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:19,680
um including liskin and client

681
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:19,990
ascension

682
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:21,799
we have uh almost half our team at

683
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,619
this point is based in lebanon and

684
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:25,289
they're killers you guys have

685
00:19:25,569 --> 00:19:26,599
probably been on calls with some

686
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:27,789
of them and i know dylan and alex

687
00:19:27,789 --> 00:19:29,359
as well have uh an a player that i

688
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:31,160
keep saying i want to poach from

689
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,980
them uh that's from lebanon um

690
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:34,400
they got to her first

691
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:34,640
unfortunately

692
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:37,390
uh if you still haven't found an a

693
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:39,849
player or enough candidates to at

694
00:19:40,069 --> 00:19:41,359
least go through the interview

695
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:43,109
process with you you can post a

696
00:19:43,109 --> 00:19:44,920
job on linkedin um again i don't

697
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,640
really like to resort to just

698
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:46,680
doing

699
00:19:47,089 --> 00:19:48,380
this uh someone here today was

700
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:49,920
telling me they had success with

701
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,440
this was it you re you put adspend

702
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:53,420
behind a linkedin post or was it

703
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:55,140
you guys who who's oh milad yeah

704
00:19:55,549 --> 00:19:56,799
that was you okay so like

705
00:19:56,859 --> 00:19:58,339
i've heard some people having

706
00:19:58,339 --> 00:20:00,069
success with this we even ran five

707
00:20:00,069 --> 00:20:02,089
dollars a day to our account

708
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:04,480
executive job posting uh for link

709
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,390
for uh for list kit on linkedin

710
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:08,400
and we got over like a thousand

711
00:20:08,529 --> 00:20:09,710
applicants i don't think we

712
00:20:09,799 --> 00:20:11,400
interviewed a single one of them

713
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,829
um usually if i were to post on

714
00:20:12,829 --> 00:20:13,349
linkedin

715
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:15,160
i wouldn't use like their quick

716
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,119
hiring process like where you can

717
00:20:17,289 --> 00:20:19,200
do like the easy application like

718
00:20:19,269 --> 00:20:19,359
one

719
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:21,019
click application you have to do

720
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:22,680
that setting i'm pretty sure but

721
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,400
what i do is in the description is

722
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:24,640
i put a

723
00:20:24,769 --> 00:20:26,200
a link to google form and knowing

724
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,730
that most people will not read the

725
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:29,190
description far enough to see

726
00:20:29,329 --> 00:20:30,750
the google form go to the google

727
00:20:30,779 --> 00:20:32,309
form and fill it out but if they

728
00:20:32,309 --> 00:20:33,940
do they're high intent candidate

729
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:34,400
that

730
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:35,990
i should probably look at um and

731
00:20:36,009 --> 00:20:37,220
so you could post a job on

732
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,890
linkedin and put just a couple of

733
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:39,279
dollars

734
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,799
of spend behind it the same way

735
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,309
you'd run an ad to your offer so

736
00:20:42,309 --> 00:20:43,900
you could literally run ads to

737
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:44,319
find a

738
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:46,210
players uh you could post on job

739
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:47,940
boards so you could go to upwork

740
00:20:48,309 --> 00:20:49,759
you could go to indeed you could

741
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:50,000
go to

742
00:20:50,049 --> 00:20:51,509
fiverr again this is like scraping

743
00:20:51,509 --> 00:20:52,809
the bottom of the barrel right

744
00:20:52,809 --> 00:20:54,400
again the way i look at this list

745
00:20:54,529 --> 00:20:56,119
is start at the top and and max it

746
00:20:56,119 --> 00:20:57,779
out and if you still don't have

747
00:20:57,779 --> 00:20:59,680
enough candidates move to the next

748
00:20:59,809 --> 00:21:01,220
ring move to the next ring move to

749
00:21:01,329 --> 00:21:02,799
the next ring until you get all

750
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:04,000
the way down to outbound

751
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:04,720
recruiting

752
00:21:04,849 --> 00:21:07,329
outbound recruiting is there's not

753
00:21:07,329 --> 00:21:09,569
really a clear definition for it's

754
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,680
where you get creative and so i

755
00:21:11,809 --> 00:21:13,390
remember uh there was a point in

756
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:14,880
time at list kit when we were

757
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,920
literally looking up prior sdrs

758
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:18,559
and aes that

759
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:20,250
worked at apollo and we would

760
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:22,160
outbound recruit to those specific

761
00:21:22,589 --> 00:21:23,849
people didn't work that well

762
00:21:24,289 --> 00:21:25,710
and you can kind of burn some

763
00:21:25,769 --> 00:21:27,589
bridges and uh piss some people

764
00:21:27,589 --> 00:21:29,920
off doing it just like christian

765
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:30,079
was

766
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:32,039
saying happens when you send cold

767
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:33,779
dms and cold emails but it's kind

768
00:21:34,069 --> 00:21:35,359
of part of the process so

769
00:21:35,569 --> 00:21:37,910
that's uh the traffic part of it

770
00:21:38,009 --> 00:21:40,650
and so action item number three is

771
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:43,059
to put together uh outreach

772
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:44,380
messages and so here's some

773
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:45,740
screenshots of the different

774
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:47,039
places we've posted our job

775
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:48,160
opportunities

776
00:21:48,289 --> 00:21:49,950
and a couple of different ways

777
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:51,650
that we've done it and so this

778
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:55,190
first one over here is a tweet on

779
00:21:55,359 --> 00:21:55,519
my

780
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:57,299
account basically saying list

781
00:21:57,299 --> 00:21:59,119
kit's looking to hire a cold email

782
00:21:59,549 --> 00:22:01,279
expert um we're looking to hire an

783
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:02,700
onboarding specialist that was

784
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,049
before we had a really cool name

785
00:22:04,049 --> 00:22:05,599
for it i probably think uh if we

786
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:06,160
had cold

787
00:22:06,289 --> 00:22:07,869
email systems engineer in there

788
00:22:07,869 --> 00:22:09,630
would have got even more people to

789
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:11,359
apply i genuinely believe that

790
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:13,890
um so that's an example of a post

791
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:15,640
that you can put on social media

792
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,200
this is another example that

793
00:22:17,319 --> 00:22:18,910
we tweeted from our company page

794
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:20,750
because client ascension has such

795
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:22,319
a strong following we're able

796
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,660
to tweet that it got almost 10 000

797
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:26,240
views on twitter and i think we

798
00:22:26,349 --> 00:22:28,079
hired two closers specifically

799
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:28,240
from

800
00:22:28,369 --> 00:22:30,349
this post i don't know how they

801
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:32,289
worked out but we got tons of

802
00:22:32,289 --> 00:22:34,480
applicants um and the different

803
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:34,799
approach

804
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:36,349
here is dan actually did a loom

805
00:22:36,369 --> 00:22:38,000
video which works really well um

806
00:22:38,049 --> 00:22:39,599
and so you can test out a loom

807
00:22:39,819 --> 00:22:39,839
video

808
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:42,630
in addition to just your post um

809
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:45,960
that top one is i believe that's

810
00:22:46,049 --> 00:22:48,160
in the opportunities channel on

811
00:22:48,289 --> 00:22:49,309
client ascension and then this one

812
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:50,359
here is in the opportunities

813
00:22:50,359 --> 00:22:51,599
channel on client ascension as

814
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:52,240
well

815
00:22:52,369 --> 00:22:54,039
that was to hire a student success

816
00:22:54,119 --> 00:22:56,160
coach and that was to hire more a

817
00:22:56,269 --> 00:22:58,319
more aes and sdrs and so

818
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:01,069
take a minute to craft a message

819
00:23:01,069 --> 00:23:02,720
similar to what you see here

820
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:04,720
whether it's a tweet or a post in

821
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:04,799
the

822
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:07,259
client ascension opportunities

823
00:23:07,259 --> 00:23:09,269
channel to call out uh for your

824
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:12,430
next hire and any questions on

825
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:13,039
that feel

826
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:15,000
free to just throw them out there

827
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:21,359
can you guys see those all right

828
00:23:28,289 --> 00:23:29,660
that honestly though the best

829
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:31,349
example on here that's applicable

830
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,619
to you guys is top left

831
00:23:32,769 --> 00:23:34,599
because it's the most fleshed out

832
00:23:34,599 --> 00:23:36,559
and detailed the others we can get

833
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:38,640
away with because the middle one

834
00:23:38,769 --> 00:23:40,180
has a loom video that explains

835
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,990
more of those things and then the

836
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:43,920
top one on the right the bottom

837
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:44,160
one on

838
00:23:44,289 --> 00:23:45,470
the right are just in client

839
00:23:45,559 --> 00:23:47,119
ascension so people kind of know

840
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:48,950
what those roles uh entail at this

841
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:49,200
point

842
00:23:49,299 --> 00:23:49,759
go ahead mark

843
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:57,910
however many it takes so it's not

844
00:23:57,910 --> 00:24:00,079
about how many candidates apply

845
00:24:00,079 --> 00:24:01,119
it's about how many actually make

846
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,549
it through to the interview

847
00:24:02,549 --> 00:24:04,160
process so i'll show you i think

848
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,990
in the next slide the actual steps

849
00:24:06,089 --> 00:24:07,160
of the interview process once

850
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:08,640
you've sent enough traffic through

851
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,759
um there's not really like a

852
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:12,319
benchmark

853
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:13,630
for like i want because like i

854
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,019
said on linkedin we had over a

855
00:24:15,019 --> 00:24:16,559
thousand applicants i didn't look

856
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:16,720
at a

857
00:24:16,849 --> 00:24:18,509
single one of those applicants

858
00:24:18,509 --> 00:24:20,099
right um but to some of these

859
00:24:20,099 --> 00:24:22,000
tweets we might have gotten five

860
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:22,839
applicants and we

861
00:24:23,009 --> 00:24:24,299
interviewed all five of them and

862
00:24:24,299 --> 00:24:25,740
then out of the five interviews we

863
00:24:25,819 --> 00:24:27,119
sent you know a couple through to

864
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:28,920
the next stage and then from that

865
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,730
stage we had a better idea but i'm

866
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:32,410
usually looking for at least

867
00:24:32,609 --> 00:24:34,279
like just from my own experience

868
00:24:34,359 --> 00:24:35,960
if i follow that process i laid

869
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,759
out and go through each of those

870
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:39,369
different channels if i get 10

871
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:40,960
candidates i usually have plenty

872
00:24:41,009 --> 00:24:41,839
to look through

873
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:45,140
do you both like separate those

874
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:47,759
things for lebanon or different

875
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:49,359
countries where you're hiring

876
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:50,599
um no so if i'm hiring through

877
00:24:50,599 --> 00:24:51,690
like lebanon or through a

878
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:53,180
recruiting company the nice thing

879
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:53,440
is they

880
00:24:53,549 --> 00:24:55,140
do all this for you right that's

881
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:57,039
kind of like the the selling point

882
00:24:57,319 --> 00:24:59,359
of a recruiting agency is you just

883
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:00,950
tell them what you're looking for

884
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,390
they handle everything so you

885
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:03,829
don't have to rely on attracting

886
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:04,309
your own

887
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:06,619
talent so you only hire recruiting

888
00:25:06,619 --> 00:25:08,750
agencies if you can't get talent

889
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:10,319
this way or if you want to hire

890
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:12,519
from a really specific geographic

891
00:25:12,519 --> 00:25:14,720
location that they have way better

892
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,400
access to than you do does that

893
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:16,440
make

894
00:25:16,609 --> 00:25:21,259
sense okay are we good to move on

895
00:25:21,509 --> 00:25:23,039
anyone still working on this one

896
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:24,799
we're good all right cool

897
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:29,920
403 it's already been half an hour

898
00:25:30,049 --> 00:25:34,630
okay uh so my my five-step vetting

899
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:37,259
process so mark this will go more

900
00:25:37,259 --> 00:25:38,640
into what to do once you actually

901
00:25:38,769 --> 00:25:41,099
get the candidate so again never

902
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:43,730
settle for mediocre talent it's

903
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:46,269
like by far the biggest mistake

904
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:46,720
you can

905
00:25:46,849 --> 00:25:48,660
make in the hiring process is

906
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:50,849
settling for mediocre talent it

907
00:25:50,849 --> 00:25:53,029
does your your current a players

908
00:25:53,029 --> 00:25:53,200
the

909
00:25:53,329 --> 00:25:54,509
biggest disservice and it does you

910
00:25:54,599 --> 00:25:55,819
a disservice because guess what

911
00:25:55,819 --> 00:25:57,039
you're gonna have to go back and

912
00:25:57,170 --> 00:25:59,059
do it again please please please

913
00:25:59,059 --> 00:26:01,130
if there's one thing you take from

914
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:03,680
this is never ever ever settle for

915
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:05,940
mediocre talent um and so the way

916
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:08,190
you you are safe from ever running

917
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:10,400
into this being a potential issue

918
00:26:10,529 --> 00:26:12,200
is sending enough traffic right

919
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:14,019
sending enough candidates through

920
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:16,160
this vetting process until you

921
00:26:16,289 --> 00:26:17,700
find an a player that you'll go to

922
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:19,539
your friends and brag about you've

923
00:26:19,539 --> 00:26:21,279
probably heard me brag about and

924
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:22,700
name drop so many of the different

925
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:23,910
team members that work at our

926
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:26,400
companies and i do that genuinely

927
00:26:26,529 --> 00:26:28,079
because i've put candidates uh

928
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:29,960
through this process and i've gone

929
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,599
through this process to hire

930
00:26:31,599 --> 00:26:31,690
everyone

931
00:26:32,049 --> 00:26:33,720
at the company um and so the the

932
00:26:33,799 --> 00:26:35,319
five-step process is one

933
00:26:35,339 --> 00:26:37,279
application right so the only goal

934
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:37,750
of the

935
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:40,039
application is to quickly weed

936
00:26:40,039 --> 00:26:42,480
people out that will save you time

937
00:26:42,789 --> 00:26:44,960
from doing so many interviews so

938
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:45,279
like

939
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:46,940
if you have 10 people interested

940
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,420
in the role don't make the mistake

941
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:49,980
of hopping on 10 interviews

942
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:52,250
it's probably likely that five of

943
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:54,400
them will not be worth your time

944
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,359
and you can figure it out real

945
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:57,369
quick with a google form and i'll

946
00:26:57,369 --> 00:26:59,170
show you some of the applications

947
00:26:59,170 --> 00:27:00,720
we use and and how we use some

948
00:27:00,849 --> 00:27:02,200
strategic questions in there the

949
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,569
second once you've actually put

950
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:05,039
them through an application and

951
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:05,119
you

952
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:06,359
think okay this guy's got

953
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:07,849
potential let me let me see put

954
00:27:07,849 --> 00:27:09,589
them through a screening interview

955
00:27:09,809 --> 00:27:11,720
screening interview is a cat like

956
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:14,150
a casual interview 15 30 minutes

957
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:17,309
uh that assesses culture fit

958
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:18,980
and the way to assess culture fit

959
00:27:19,089 --> 00:27:21,839
in my opinion is to just ask them

960
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:23,920
like why do you want to work here

961
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:26,599
and why do you think you're the

962
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:28,400
right person for this specific

963
00:27:28,829 --> 00:27:30,799
role those are like the only two

964
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:32,339
questions i think to ask on a

965
00:27:32,339 --> 00:27:34,289
screening interview and then i see

966
00:27:34,309 --> 00:27:36,079
how easy it is to hold the rest of

967
00:27:36,289 --> 00:27:37,960
the conversation the easier it is

968
00:27:38,039 --> 00:27:39,539
to hold the conversation the

969
00:27:39,539 --> 00:27:41,039
better culture fit that's

970
00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:42,630
literally the only way i think

971
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,950
about it if they make it past the

972
00:27:45,069 --> 00:27:47,279
screening interview which most

973
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:47,680
people

974
00:27:47,809 --> 00:27:48,990
usually do you give them a

975
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:50,640
homework assignment the way to

976
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,390
think about a homework assignment

977
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:52,960
is

978
00:27:53,069 --> 00:27:54,210
it's a test of their skills

979
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:55,809
relevant to the responsibilities

980
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:58,160
of the role and so again the

981
00:27:58,289 --> 00:27:59,599
sales the sales examples for

982
00:27:59,599 --> 00:28:00,980
hiring are the easiest in my

983
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:02,319
opinion because it's like okay for

984
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:02,650
sales the

985
00:28:02,849 --> 00:28:04,269
homework assignment is mock call

986
00:28:04,369 --> 00:28:05,720
interview you just get them on a

987
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,190
pretend sales call and see how

988
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:07,519
they do

989
00:28:08,529 --> 00:28:09,690
for an onboarding specialist it

990
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:10,730
looks a lot different for a

991
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:12,039
student success coach at client

992
00:28:12,289 --> 00:28:14,269
ascension it looks a lot different

993
00:28:14,269 --> 00:28:16,240
but you want to create scenarios

994
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,160
or projects or questions that they

995
00:28:18,289 --> 00:28:19,670
can work on that are as closely

996
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:21,190
similar to the things they'll

997
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:22,400
actually be doing in the

998
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,279
day-to-day and

999
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:25,079
again i have examples of this that

1000
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,880
you guys will look at on the next

1001
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:29,200
slide here if they make it past

1002
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:29,279
the

1003
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:30,589
homework assignment which you'll

1004
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,910
actually weed people out at this

1005
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:32,920
point because you're already

1006
00:28:33,309 --> 00:28:34,160
asking so much

1007
00:28:34,289 --> 00:28:35,220
you had them fill out an

1008
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,619
application you had them attend

1009
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:38,400
the screening interview now you're

1010
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:38,630
asking

1011
00:28:38,849 --> 00:28:40,150
them to do homework and you're

1012
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:41,420
still not giving them more

1013
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:43,180
information about the role you're

1014
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:44,039
gatekeeping

1015
00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:45,849
the compensation the price all

1016
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:47,529
that sort of stuff and so a lot of

1017
00:28:47,529 --> 00:28:49,359
people will naturally drop off at

1018
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:49,440
this

1019
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:51,400
point which is the intent of the

1020
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:53,160
actual system that's how it's

1021
00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:54,880
supposed to work but if they've

1022
00:28:55,029 --> 00:28:55,359
made it

1023
00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:56,910
through this is where you do the

1024
00:28:56,930 --> 00:28:58,740
scorecard interview the scorecard

1025
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:00,480
interview is i already know i

1026
00:29:00,609 --> 00:29:02,029
want to hire this person but let

1027
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:03,619
me make sure they're aligned on

1028
00:29:03,619 --> 00:29:05,680
the expectations and the kpis

1029
00:29:05,809 --> 00:29:07,599
and all i'm looking for in this

1030
00:29:07,599 --> 00:29:09,279
interview is i just walk through

1031
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:12,000
the scorecard on a screen share

1032
00:29:12,130 --> 00:29:13,519
and i read it to them and i say

1033
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:15,069
any questions what are your

1034
00:29:15,079 --> 00:29:17,759
thoughts on this and i see if

1035
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:19,440
their facial

1036
00:29:19,569 --> 00:29:21,900
reaction changes of like oh shit i

1037
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:24,160
have to go on daily calls oh like

1038
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,960
no so like you're really analyzing

1039
00:29:27,089 --> 00:29:28,269
their reaction to the different

1040
00:29:28,359 --> 00:29:29,809
parts of the responsibility to see

1041
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,039
is like that's something

1042
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:32,579
that gets them excited or is that

1043
00:29:32,579 --> 00:29:34,109
something that kind of is like oh

1044
00:29:34,109 --> 00:29:35,509
man i didn't know that was

1045
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:37,150
involved and so all i'm doing on

1046
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,789
this call is i'm reading through

1047
00:29:38,849 --> 00:29:40,480
and i'm asking them you know for

1048
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:40,640
their

1049
00:29:40,769 --> 00:29:42,400
thoughts for their questions if it

1050
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,130
still seems like something they'd

1051
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:45,680
be interested in doing and then

1052
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:45,839
the

1053
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:47,730
biggest reveal at the end is time

1054
00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:49,440
and compensation once you show

1055
00:29:49,839 --> 00:29:51,680
them compensation it's like again

1056
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:51,750
on

1057
00:29:51,809 --> 00:29:53,299
a sales call you get the reaction

1058
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:56,109
immediately you get the reaction

1059
00:29:56,109 --> 00:29:59,039
immediately it's like they're

1060
00:29:59,039 --> 00:29:59,390
either

1061
00:29:59,809 --> 00:30:01,890
no like this is not what i thought

1062
00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:03,859
it was going to be and it's not

1063
00:30:03,859 --> 00:30:05,799
enough pay or wow that's amazing

1064
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,259
let's get started how can i get

1065
00:30:07,259 --> 00:30:08,920
started it's there's really never

1066
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,559
an in-between if there's an if

1067
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:10,789
there

1068
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:12,579
isn't an in-between there's like a

1069
00:30:12,579 --> 00:30:14,250
conversation around it which is

1070
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:16,720
pretty easy to navigate but

1071
00:30:16,849 --> 00:30:18,519
again the scorecard interview is

1072
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:20,779
just to see like how how excited

1073
00:30:20,779 --> 00:30:24,000
they are or how their reaction is

1074
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:24,240
to

1075
00:30:24,369 --> 00:30:25,269
everything you're going to be

1076
00:30:25,269 --> 00:30:26,259
asking them to do and what the

1077
00:30:26,259 --> 00:30:27,440
actual offer is right it's where

1078
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:27,839
you reveal

1079
00:30:28,049 --> 00:30:29,880
the offer again it's like the end

1080
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,809
of the sales call where you drop

1081
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:33,759
the price the end of the hiring

1082
00:30:33,829 --> 00:30:34,039
process

1083
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:36,430
where you drop the actual details

1084
00:30:36,519 --> 00:30:38,549
of the role um and at this point

1085
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:40,559
it's very rare that you'll have

1086
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:42,299
you know two or three candidates

1087
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:44,029
that you're super happy with and

1088
00:30:44,029 --> 00:30:46,640
torn over as it's been maybe three

1089
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:47,940
or four times in in my career

1090
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:49,099
since we've started these

1091
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:50,720
companies where it's gotten to

1092
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,349
this point

1093
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:52,859
which is step five uh which is

1094
00:30:52,859 --> 00:30:54,549
optional which is a team culture

1095
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:56,079
fit interview so if i have like

1096
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:56,400
three

1097
00:30:56,529 --> 00:30:57,710
candidates and i'm like i just

1098
00:30:57,799 --> 00:30:59,099
don't know which one to go with

1099
00:30:59,099 --> 00:31:00,559
all three of them could crush it

1100
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:01,819
for these different reasons i've

1101
00:31:01,819 --> 00:31:02,910
done the t chart of like this is

1102
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,200
good this is bad about each person

1103
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:06,200
i still can't come to a confident

1104
00:31:06,279 --> 00:31:08,000
decision and if i can't just hire

1105
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:09,690
multiple of them because sometimes

1106
00:31:09,859 --> 00:31:11,069
it's just like well we need two or

1107
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,460
we will need two pretty soon so

1108
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:14,230
let's just bring them both on

1109
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:15,740
i'll do a team culture fit

1110
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:17,480
interview um just to do a sanity

1111
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,119
check for myself and be like yo

1112
00:31:19,349 --> 00:31:19,609
christian

1113
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:20,809
well i never actually do it with

1114
00:31:20,809 --> 00:31:23,960
christian no no offense i do it

1115
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,670
with someone that's in the

1116
00:31:25,809 --> 00:31:26,700
specific department that i'm

1117
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:27,700
hiring that person for and i'm

1118
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,319
like no i don't know why i

1119
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:29,680
mentioned

1120
00:31:29,809 --> 00:31:31,349
christian no offense to christian

1121
00:31:31,349 --> 00:31:32,710
uh but i'll send it to someone

1122
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:34,880
that's either in the role already

1123
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,140
or plays a big part in that

1124
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:37,880
specific department and i'll have

1125
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,599
them just hop on an interview and

1126
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:39,829
say

1127
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:41,000
let me know your thoughts about

1128
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,190
this guy like are you seeing what

1129
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,640
i'm seeing like could he crush it

1130
00:31:44,869 --> 00:31:45,039
here

1131
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:46,650
or am i crazy um and i'll put all

1132
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:48,230
three or all two of the people

1133
00:31:48,289 --> 00:31:50,160
that have made it to this step on

1134
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:50,319
an

1135
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:52,089
interview with someone else on the

1136
00:31:52,089 --> 00:31:53,480
team to get their input on it

1137
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,039
because a lot of times i'm just

1138
00:31:55,339 --> 00:31:55,359
very

1139
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:57,130
tunnel vision and i see something

1140
00:31:57,130 --> 00:31:58,700
i like but i'm ignoring all the

1141
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:00,160
red flags right again you can

1142
00:32:00,289 --> 00:32:01,640
relate this to to any other

1143
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,670
process including selling an offer

1144
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:05,480
go ahead george um

1145
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:22,710
10 to 20 000 what do you mean okay

1146
00:32:22,809 --> 00:32:25,900
i'll do like uh what do you call

1147
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:28,720
like a range give them an idea

1148
00:32:28,849 --> 00:32:38,640
i have that all the time yeah

1149
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,809
right i mean i have that all the

1150
00:32:39,809 --> 00:32:42,000
time i do a range and then you

1151
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:42,099
could

1152
00:32:42,289 --> 00:32:43,769
also get an idea like some of the

1153
00:32:43,809 --> 00:32:45,359
interview questions we ask are

1154
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:46,880
like how much are you making

1155
00:32:47,009 --> 00:32:48,680
now and then what are your goals

1156
00:32:48,759 --> 00:32:50,519
financially and if their goal is

1157
00:32:50,869 --> 00:32:52,200
like i want to make 15k a month

1158
00:32:52,369 --> 00:32:52,480
and

1159
00:32:52,589 --> 00:32:54,069
it's a two thousand dollar a month

1160
00:32:54,069 --> 00:32:55,549
role like i'm going to probably

1161
00:32:55,549 --> 00:32:56,950
bring that up sooner because i

1162
00:32:57,089 --> 00:32:58,099
don't want to waste my time and

1163
00:32:58,099 --> 00:32:59,420
their time going through the whole

1164
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:00,579
interview process just to drop

1165
00:33:00,789 --> 00:33:02,470
a price on them that is totally

1166
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:04,920
out of expectation that's

1167
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:08,259
application yeah screening you

1168
00:33:08,259 --> 00:33:08,640
don't want

1169
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:09,950
to get into like those types of

1170
00:33:10,039 --> 00:33:11,410
questions it's again why do you

1171
00:33:11,410 --> 00:33:13,519
want to work here what about this

1172
00:33:13,650 --> 00:33:15,130
company excites you and then why

1173
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:16,690
do you think you're a good fit in

1174
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:18,109
this specific role those are the

1175
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:18,400
only

1176
00:33:18,529 --> 00:33:23,680
two questions no no i just want

1177
00:33:23,789 --> 00:33:25,309
them to have a conversation with

1178
00:33:25,369 --> 00:33:26,559
them because they're going to

1179
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:28,359
be working with that person right

1180
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,940
so i want them to be able to get

1181
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:31,759
along and and then they also like

1182
00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:33,019
your team will really appreciate

1183
00:33:33,019 --> 00:33:34,230
when you do this because they feel

1184
00:33:34,329 --> 00:33:35,359
like they have a say of who

1185
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:35,519
they're

1186
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:37,319
going to be working with every day

1187
00:33:37,319 --> 00:33:38,920
which not many companies give

1188
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,809
their own team members like that

1189
00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:50,299
you know free reign well yes but

1190
00:33:50,299 --> 00:33:52,869
also again it's like how many

1191
00:33:53,049 --> 00:33:54,420
hires make it all the way through

1192
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:54,640
to

1193
00:33:54,769 --> 00:33:56,349
five right where you don't have

1194
00:33:56,349 --> 00:33:58,200
someone you're thrilled with and

1195
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,589
there's just one of them

1196
00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:01,349
at step four so it's very rare but

1197
00:34:01,349 --> 00:34:02,900
it is like a nice thing to pull

1198
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,549
out of your back pocket when you

1199
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:06,170
need it i don't think it really

1200
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:07,940
matters entry level or you know

1201
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:09,599
more senior but yes for more

1202
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:09,840
senior

1203
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:11,380
people that might not even be

1204
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:12,969
optional it might be something

1205
00:34:12,969 --> 00:34:14,159
that i is i send them through to

1206
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:14,389
five

1207
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:16,079
team members to see their thoughts

1208
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:27,880
on him just like adding on all of

1209
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:33,920
the bad things you're going to

1210
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:35,230
find it anyway so let me just give

1211
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,590
it to you right now yeah we'll go

1212
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:37,739
through this whole and waste

1213
00:34:37,889 --> 00:34:39,349
everybody's time and money and

1214
00:34:39,369 --> 00:34:40,900
things like that so i took that

1215
00:34:40,909 --> 00:34:42,639
and then my first interview is

1216
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:43,070
basically

1217
00:34:43,409 --> 00:34:44,440
just i'm just having a

1218
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,929
conversation yeah i'm having

1219
00:34:45,929 --> 00:34:47,039
questions i just want to talk to

1220
00:34:47,039 --> 00:34:47,599
them and just see

1221
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:49,139
if they're cool basically but at

1222
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:50,860
the beginning i'll say now let me

1223
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:52,000
talk at you for five minutes

1224
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:52,389
because

1225
00:34:52,519 --> 00:34:53,219
they'll probably answer a lot of

1226
00:34:53,219 --> 00:34:54,090
questions you have and i'll tell

1227
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:55,119
them tell the reasons they should

1228
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:56,800
not want to work with us and then

1229
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,610
the cool things like why they want

1230
00:34:58,610 --> 00:35:00,400
to as well but like i don't know

1231
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:01,550
if they're just like you know

1232
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:02,750
you're the person that's hiring

1233
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:03,989
them so they say it's great i

1234
00:35:03,989 --> 00:35:04,119
don't know

1235
00:35:04,289 --> 00:35:05,010
they actually think it's great but

1236
00:35:05,079 --> 00:35:05,960
people are always like wow it's

1237
00:35:06,039 --> 00:35:06,880

1238
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:10,869
yeah i like that i like that just

1239
00:35:10,909 --> 00:35:13,210
being up front i think it'll save

1240
00:35:13,309 --> 00:35:14,480
you a lot of time

1241
00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:17,519
so i like that i'm gonna try it

00:35:21,679 --> 00:35:22,480
good all right i'm gonna keep

1244
00:35:22,610 --> 00:35:23,969
ripping it just because we're a

1245
00:35:23,969 --> 00:35:25,250
little behind but anyways

1246
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:26,949
throughout the interview process

1247
00:35:27,179 --> 00:35:28,239
the things

1248
00:35:28,369 --> 00:35:29,949
that you want to prioritize are

1249
00:35:29,949 --> 00:35:31,780
culture fit potential cognitive

1250
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:33,190

1251
00:35:33,329 --> 00:35:34,960
they perform in a homework

1252
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,210
assignment and then their buy-in

1253
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:39,280
the way to assume their buy-in

1254
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:39,530
again

1255
00:35:39,730 --> 00:35:41,699

1256
00:35:41,699 --> 00:35:43,800

for you

1263
00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:53,159
as well right they always say in

1264
00:35:53,219 --> 00:35:54,460
in the hiring process like if they

1265
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:55,760
don't have questions for you

1266
00:35:55,889 --> 00:35:57,500
after then it's a red flag uh are

1267
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:59,349
they doing the homework assignment

1268
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:01,039
and then how long after it's

1269
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:02,429
assigned are they submitting it

1270
00:36:02,519 --> 00:36:03,909
these are all things you should be

1271
00:36:03,909 --> 00:36:06,559

1272
00:36:06,829 --> 00:36:07,119
scorecard

well

1288
00:36:31,409 --> 00:36:33,739
is intentionally ghost candidates

1289
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,769
at different stages throughout the

1290
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:37,619
interview process to test their

1291
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:38,079

1292
00:36:38,210 --> 00:36:41,139

i just need to test that this is

1298
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:52,480
this is real and then the next

1299
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,039
morning follow-up and i'm like

1300
00:36:54,039 --> 00:36:55,510
perfect i could finally tell him

1301
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:55,760
that was

1302
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:57,250
a test and he passed right um

1303
00:36:57,250 --> 00:36:59,070
there was a story actually of like

1304
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:00,710
someone that went through an

1305
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,039
entire

1306
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:02,650
interview process crushed it had

1307
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:04,210
all the signals that he was going

1308
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:06,719
to get hired and he didn't and so

1309
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,119
he just

1310
00:37:07,969 --> 00:37:09,150
went back to the to the guy and

1311
00:37:09,239 --> 00:37:10,699
said hey i thought it was a really

1312
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:11,449
good fit for this

1313
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:12,909
i thought i deserved the role out

1314
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,440
of curiosity like why didn't i get

1315
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,070
it and he's like you're hired he's

1316
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:17,619
like what what do you mean he's

1317
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:19,480
like you're the only person that

1318
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,369
got turned down and asked why

1319
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:23,269
and that's what we're looking for

1320
00:37:23,269 --> 00:37:24,730
here and so it's like kind of a

1321
00:37:24,769 --> 00:37:25,679
sick thing to do

1322
00:37:25,809 --> 00:37:27,480
but if you do it in just like a

1323
00:37:27,559 --> 00:37:28,530
simple email

1324
00:37:33,329 --> 00:37:34,159
what are you referring to

1325
00:37:34,289 --> 00:37:38,409
is that christian is that your

1326
00:37:38,409 --> 00:37:41,519
tick tock dm strategy

1327
00:37:41,650 --> 00:37:47,340
all right so i mean again you'll

1328
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:51,000
get these slides i don't want to

1329
00:37:51,079 --> 00:37:52,400
go too deep into them because i'm

1330
00:37:52,530 --> 00:37:54,309
behind um but anyway so how to set

1331
00:37:54,309 --> 00:37:56,219
your new hires up for success this

1332
00:37:56,429 --> 00:37:57,690
goes into the nitty-gritty

1333
00:37:58,130 --> 00:37:59,610
um now that you have uh your

1334
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:01,619
potential a player hired uh it's

1335
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:03,119
actually time to facilitate

1336
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:05,030
the environment for that new

1337
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:06,760
talent to thrive this is again

1338
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:08,320
something i hear all the time is

1339
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,039
like

1340
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:10,789
this person sucks they're not

1341
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:12,469
performing i hired the wrong

1342
00:38:12,469 --> 00:38:14,329
person and if you dig a little

1343
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:15,159
deeper it's

1344
00:38:15,329 --> 00:38:16,940
not always the case it's you have

1345
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:18,559
hired someone that has tons of

1346
00:38:18,559 --> 00:38:20,239
potential to succeed to be an a

1347
00:38:20,239 --> 00:38:20,960
player

1348
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:22,760
but your environment's not right

1349
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,510
uh and so that's also something

1350
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:26,960
that you uh need to think about

1351
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:28,619
facilitating is an environment

1352
00:38:28,619 --> 00:38:30,559
where they can thrive um and again

1353
00:38:30,989 --> 00:38:32,550
think of this the same way you

1354
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:33,039
think about

1355
00:38:33,409 --> 00:38:34,889
onboarding a new client right when

1356
00:38:34,929 --> 00:38:36,679
you onboard a new client you don't

1357
00:38:36,679 --> 00:38:38,070
ghost them at that point

1358
00:38:38,210 --> 00:38:39,219
right you want to be very

1359
00:38:39,219 --> 00:38:40,929
intentional about following up and

1360
00:38:40,949 --> 00:38:42,550
providing the right information

1361
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,159
so get really clear on what are

1362
00:38:44,159 --> 00:38:45,489
the next steps what are the

1363
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:47,429
activation points that'll get them

1364
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:49,699
closer to their goals how can you

1365
00:38:49,699 --> 00:38:51,909
over deliver along the way and so

1366
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:54,079
how do we clearly map this out we

1367
00:38:54,369 --> 00:38:55,400
have an independent contractor

1368
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:56,599
agreement for signing which i'll

1369
00:38:56,679 --> 00:38:57,750
give you guys a template for

1370
00:38:58,530 --> 00:38:59,969
send a personalized welcome email

1371
00:38:59,989 --> 00:39:01,550
with next steps schedule a kickoff

1372
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:02,639
call to get clear on their

1373
00:39:02,769 --> 00:39:04,610
goals and personal ambitions that

1374
00:39:04,639 --> 00:39:06,260
that second one key you have to

1375
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:08,000
understand their goals and their

1376
00:39:08,289 --> 00:39:09,570
personal ambitions because you

1377
00:39:09,570 --> 00:39:10,969
need to keep them around the same

1378
00:39:10,969 --> 00:39:12,559
way you understand your clients

1379
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:13,199
goals

1380
00:39:13,329 --> 00:39:15,099
to book more calls or to generate

1381
00:39:15,099 --> 00:39:16,769
new clients or to lower their

1382
00:39:16,769 --> 00:39:18,239
churn we're doing the same thing

1383
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:18,480
with our

1384
00:39:18,769 --> 00:39:20,340
talent in our team members so

1385
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:22,340
create a company email account uh

1386
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:23,960
invest time in their development

1387
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:24,480
with

1388
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:25,630
one-on-ones and huddles uh

1389
00:39:25,699 --> 00:39:27,340
leverage other team members to

1390
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:30,239
shadow their onboarding calls uh

1391
00:39:30,239 --> 00:39:30,559
and then

1392
00:39:30,690 --> 00:39:32,170
constant check-ins and pulse

1393
00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:34,050
checks um and then equip them with

1394
00:39:34,050 --> 00:39:35,869
software tools sops and external

1395
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:37,760
trainings one of the things we do

1396
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,440
at our companies is we invest in

1397
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,760
trainings from let's say cole

1398
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:42,159
gordon

1399
00:39:42,289 --> 00:39:43,880
taylor welsh bill walsh to train

1400
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,360
our guys on sales they're all

1401
00:39:45,409 --> 00:39:48,159
invest in trainings from uh for

1402
00:39:48,159 --> 00:39:48,489
example

1403
00:39:48,639 --> 00:39:50,719
i i i learned from this guy named

1404
00:39:50,719 --> 00:39:53,019
lincoln murphy on the cs side that

1405
00:39:53,019 --> 00:39:55,199
uh really helps our cs team at

1406
00:39:55,349 --> 00:39:55,599
list

1407
00:39:55,730 --> 00:39:57,949
kit drive down churn so i bring in

1408
00:39:58,039 --> 00:40:00,070
experts to help train uh and

1409
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:02,239
improve my team's skill sets

1410
00:40:02,449 --> 00:40:04,369
the next thing is uh how to test

1411
00:40:04,369 --> 00:40:06,610
their readiness now that you put

1412
00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:08,639
them through like the typical

1413
00:40:08,769 --> 00:40:10,920
standard onboarding procedures

1414
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,920
it's time to like i like to call

1415
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,760
it baptism by fire you just throw

1416
00:40:14,849 --> 00:40:14,960
them

1417
00:40:15,090 --> 00:40:16,920
in see how they perform uh and so

1418
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,769
we we still want to do this in a

1419
00:40:18,989 --> 00:40:20,960
way that follows a due diligence

1420
00:40:21,090 --> 00:40:22,989
process and so the steps that i

1421
00:40:22,989 --> 00:40:25,199
like to take here is really three

1422
00:40:25,199 --> 00:40:26,719
steps i start them off by

1423
00:40:26,719 --> 00:40:27,280
shadowing

1424
00:40:27,409 --> 00:40:29,199
you or another team member in the

1425
00:40:29,199 --> 00:40:31,130
same role doing the work they're

1426
00:40:31,309 --> 00:40:33,280
tasked to do so again sales is a

1427
00:40:33,409 --> 00:40:34,980
great example if you hired a

1428
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:36,880
closer have them shadow existing

1429
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:39,039
closers to see what those calls

1430
00:40:39,039 --> 00:40:39,519
are going

1431
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:41,070
like or if you hired an onboarding

1432
00:40:41,130 --> 00:40:42,659
specialist or a customer support

1433
00:40:42,659 --> 00:40:44,400
representative have them get on

1434
00:40:44,530 --> 00:40:46,079
client calls with your existing

1435
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:47,710
csms or with you if you're the guy

1436
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:49,679
for that um just so that they can

1437
00:40:49,809 --> 00:40:51,489
learn and be a fly on the wall um

1438
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:53,280
and they can also watch sops if

1439
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,800
you have them or previous call

1440
00:40:55,969 --> 00:40:57,329
recordings in this step so the

1441
00:40:57,329 --> 00:40:58,690
same way on the sales side you

1442
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:00,309
record your calls and watch them

1443
00:41:00,539 --> 00:41:00,960
back

1444
00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:02,889
you should be doing the same exact

1445
00:41:02,889 --> 00:41:04,730
thing on the cs side you should be

1446
00:41:04,989 --> 00:41:05,679
recording every

1447
00:41:05,809 --> 00:41:07,250
single call of your clients and

1448
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:09,269
using them in your trainings once

1449
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:12,239
they're shadowing and being a fly

1450
00:41:12,369 --> 00:41:14,409
on the wall for long enough um you

1451
00:41:14,409 --> 00:41:16,579
can then switch them to doing the

1452
00:41:16,579 --> 00:41:18,480
actual work with you on a live

1453
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:20,230
call while either you or again

1454
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:22,079
someone else in the role is still

1455
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:23,769
on the call with them so again

1456
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:24,000
it's

1457
00:41:24,130 --> 00:41:25,949
like you ever go to like a grocery

1458
00:41:25,949 --> 00:41:27,920
store or the dentist and they're

1459
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:29,289
like this is you know my

1460
00:41:29,650 --> 00:41:31,269
associate or this is like a junior

1461
00:41:31,269 --> 00:41:32,909
doctor or whatever and they're

1462
00:41:32,909 --> 00:41:34,559
basically you know in their first

1463
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:34,800
days

1464
00:41:35,010 --> 00:41:36,559
here and i'm watching over them

1465
00:41:36,559 --> 00:41:38,360
it's the same thing right like you

1466
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:40,719
can put them in the role and have

1467
00:41:40,849 --> 00:41:42,130
someone more senior still there to

1468
00:41:42,130 --> 00:41:43,179
look over and make sure that

1469
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:45,670
they're doing a good job right

1470
00:41:45,719 --> 00:41:45,760
it's

1471
00:41:45,889 --> 00:41:47,559
like having the training wheels on

1472
00:41:47,639 --> 00:41:49,250
is the way to think about it once

1473
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:51,119
you do this long enough uh and

1474
00:41:51,409 --> 00:41:52,940
when they feel comfortable or even

1475
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:54,300
a little bit before they feel

1476
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:56,030
comfortable right because baptism

1477
00:41:56,199 --> 00:41:57,619
by fire we like to throw them in

1478
00:41:57,619 --> 00:41:59,280
before they're fully ready have

1479
00:41:59,329 --> 00:42:01,199
them do the work themselves and at

1480
00:42:01,329 --> 00:42:03,010
this point all you're doing is

1481
00:42:03,079 --> 00:42:05,019
call reviews so you send them on

1482
00:42:05,170 --> 00:42:07,039
to an onboarding call or a client

1483
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:07,320
call

1484
00:42:07,489 --> 00:42:08,840
all by themselves and then have

1485
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,039
them send you the the call

1486
00:42:10,039 --> 00:42:11,789
recording after and then you can

1487
00:42:11,789 --> 00:42:12,309
watch the

1488
00:42:12,449 --> 00:42:14,000
call recording back and give them

1489
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,619
feedback on how to improve on the

1490
00:42:15,619 --> 00:42:17,269
next call and that's really like

1491
00:42:17,409 --> 00:42:18,440
the three steps in the beginning

1492
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:19,630
that you actively want to make

1493
00:42:19,630 --> 00:42:21,760
sure you're doing and once you

1494
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:22,320
finally

1495
00:42:22,449 --> 00:42:24,250
do those three steps it's time to

1496
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:26,360
take the training wheels fully off

1497
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:28,400
and get out of their own way this

1498
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:28,559
is

1499
00:42:28,690 --> 00:42:30,170
another problem that a lot of you

1500
00:42:30,210 --> 00:42:31,630
guys have is you never do that

1501
00:42:31,639 --> 00:42:33,179
final step which is get out of the

1502
00:42:33,329 --> 00:42:35,119
way a lot of you guys are babying

1503
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:36,840
your team you're scared to just

1504
00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:38,789
let them go off on their own

1505
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:39,119
because

1506
00:42:39,239 --> 00:42:40,139
for whatever reason you don't

1507
00:42:40,139 --> 00:42:41,219
trust they're going to do a good

1508
00:42:41,219 --> 00:42:42,480
job and it's probably because you

1509
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:42,630
didn't

1510
00:42:42,769 --> 00:42:44,989
follow structure that i mapped out

1511
00:42:44,989 --> 00:42:47,000
leading up to this point um and

1512
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,960
then really all you're doing at

1513
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:49,119
that

1514
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:50,420
point it's not like you're just

1515
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:51,820
going on vacation now and you have

1516
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:53,039
no work left to do you're doing

1517
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:53,280
other

1518
00:42:53,409 --> 00:42:54,849
things in the business but you're

1519
00:42:54,869 --> 00:42:56,250
also monitoring to see if they

1520
00:42:56,250 --> 00:42:57,599
need help with anything you're

1521
00:42:57,730 --> 00:42:58,690
responsive on slack you're

1522
00:42:58,690 --> 00:43:00,070
available for one-off calls you're

1523
00:43:00,170 --> 00:43:01,519
reviewing their end of day type

1524
00:43:01,630 --> 00:43:02,070
forms

1525
00:43:02,369 --> 00:43:03,929
you're getting on weekly team

1526
00:43:03,929 --> 00:43:05,800
meetings and so you're still in it

1527
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:07,440
but you're not in their way

1528
00:43:07,570 --> 00:43:09,789
and so action number number five

1529
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:12,179
again i've realized that these

1530
00:43:12,469 --> 00:43:14,079
things are not like sit down and

1531
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:14,400
do it

1532
00:43:14,530 --> 00:43:15,710
here in this room action items at

1533
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:17,210
this point um but drafting an

1534
00:43:17,210 --> 00:43:19,099
independent contractor agreement

1535
00:43:19,099 --> 00:43:19,280
which

1536
00:43:19,409 --> 00:43:20,980
will give you the uh the template

1537
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:22,880
for outline all the software tools

1538
00:43:22,949 --> 00:43:24,570
you'll need to give them access to

1539
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:25,110
with the

1540
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:27,289
sops research external trainings

1541
00:43:27,289 --> 00:43:29,550
like books podcast courses uh that

1542
00:43:29,550 --> 00:43:31,760
you can give them access to

1543
00:43:31,969 --> 00:43:33,389
identify existing team members to

1544
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:34,989
help with the onboarding process

1545
00:43:35,030 --> 00:43:36,639
and then compile examples of

1546
00:43:36,769 --> 00:43:39,099
successful work again on the sales

1547
00:43:39,210 --> 00:43:41,349
side when you onboard a closer

1548
00:43:41,670 --> 00:43:43,280
give them a folder of 10 calls

1549
00:43:43,889 --> 00:43:45,570
that other closers close or if

1550
00:43:45,639 --> 00:43:47,360
you're an onboarding specialist

1551
00:43:47,789 --> 00:43:49,050
give them calls of other

1552
00:43:49,469 --> 00:43:49,760
onboarding

1553
00:43:49,889 --> 00:43:50,920
specialists getting really good

1554
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:51,969
feedback from the client at the

1555
00:43:51,969 --> 00:43:53,840
end of the call and so you want to

1556
00:43:53,969 --> 00:43:55,389
show them what successful work

1557
00:43:55,409 --> 00:43:56,900
looks like and it doesn't just

1558
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:58,630
apply to roles that involve calls

1559
00:43:58,860 --> 00:43:58,880
either

1560
00:43:58,989 --> 00:44:00,190
if you hired a copywriter show

1561
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:01,909
them your 10 best performing ad

1562
00:44:01,909 --> 00:44:03,360
creatives or show them your 10

1563
00:44:03,429 --> 00:44:03,679
best

1564
00:44:03,809 --> 00:44:05,130
performing cold email scripts

1565
00:44:05,130 --> 00:44:06,750
because that's the easiest way for

1566
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:09,360
them to learn uh and and know what

1567
00:44:09,489 --> 00:44:11,139
works any questions before we

1568
00:44:11,139 --> 00:44:12,960
continue because we're getting

1569
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:15,489
into like a lot of detail i think

1570
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:16,000
we got

1571
00:44:18,929 --> 00:44:23,920
just just just a couple more

1572
00:44:24,050 --> 00:44:25,460
um

1573
00:44:25,650 --> 00:44:39,869
so like are they submitting

1574
00:44:39,869 --> 00:44:40,960
projects at some point

1575
00:44:43,409 --> 00:44:50,150
so yeah yeah so it's almost like a

1576
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:51,650
campaign manager on the cold email

1577
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:52,880
side go set up this client's

1578
00:44:53,010 --> 00:44:54,570
campaign with all the details and

1579
00:44:54,570 --> 00:44:55,719
sops that i've given you and let

1580
00:44:55,719 --> 00:44:57,039
me know when you're done so i can

1581
00:44:57,039 --> 00:44:57,269
go

1582
00:44:57,389 --> 00:44:58,829
in and check that all the settings

1583
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:00,349
are configured the copy was you

1584
00:45:00,349 --> 00:45:02,070
know copy and pasted and formatted

1585
00:45:02,210 --> 00:45:03,170
properly the leads list is in

1586
00:45:03,170 --> 00:45:04,250
there with the same amount of

1587
00:45:04,250 --> 00:45:05,590
leads that i originally gave them

1588
00:45:06,530 --> 00:45:08,610
sort of like that yes yeah you

1589
00:45:08,610 --> 00:45:12,670
want like a launch checklist for

1590
00:45:12,670 --> 00:45:15,659
that type of stuff of like things

1591
00:45:15,809 --> 00:45:17,690
to look for right so like again on

1592
00:45:17,690 --> 00:45:19,320
the cold email side do the leads

1593
00:45:19,710 --> 00:45:20,969
add up to the amount in the

1594
00:45:21,250 --> 00:45:22,610
original csv is it titled and

1595
00:45:22,610 --> 00:45:24,230
labeled to the right client are

1596
00:45:24,230 --> 00:45:26,159
the right email accounts assigned

1597
00:45:26,179 --> 00:45:27,119
is the

1598
00:45:27,250 --> 00:45:29,179
copy copy and pasted into that

1599
00:45:29,179 --> 00:45:31,519
software without any formatting

1600
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:33,690
issues or weird white spaces so

1601
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:33,760
you

1602
00:45:33,969 --> 00:45:34,929
could come up with a list of like

1603
00:45:34,929 --> 00:45:35,599
things to look for

1604
00:45:35,730 --> 00:45:39,170
in the beginning in the beginning

1605
00:45:39,630 --> 00:45:41,929
same way you don't review every

1606
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:43,230
single sales call

1607
00:45:43,489 --> 00:45:45,150
right but you'll do it ongoing and

1608
00:45:45,150 --> 00:45:46,960
by doing it ongoing they know that

1609
00:45:47,039 --> 00:45:48,480
any campaign that they work on

1610
00:45:48,610 --> 00:45:50,170
could potentially get reviewed and

1611
00:45:50,170 --> 00:45:51,550
so they apply the same level of

1612
00:45:51,559 --> 00:45:52,960
standard to all of them in case

1613
00:45:53,179 --> 00:45:53,760
that

1614
00:45:53,889 --> 00:45:55,070
just any one of them gets reviewed

1615
00:45:55,159 --> 00:45:56,360
because they don't want to be

1616
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:58,150
exposed right that's what that

1617
00:45:58,150 --> 00:45:58,960
does

1618
00:45:59,090 --> 00:45:59,969
just because you're not reviewing

1619
00:45:59,969 --> 00:46:00,760
all of them doesn't mean they

1620
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:01,809
don't have in the back of their

1621
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:02,159
mind when

1622
00:46:02,289 --> 00:46:03,650
they're doing it this might get

1623
00:46:03,650 --> 00:46:05,250
reviewed at some point and that's

1624
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:07,449
why you do the reviews it's a big

1625
00:46:07,809 --> 00:46:08,309
part of it right

1626
00:46:08,449 --> 00:46:12,559
okay so this is one of my

1627
00:46:12,559 --> 00:46:14,650
favorites so systems to manage

1628
00:46:14,750 --> 00:46:17,360
without micromanaging right

1629
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:17,679
because this

1630
00:46:17,769 --> 00:46:18,829
is one of the biggest pain in the

1631
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:20,030
next is when you hire a bunch of

1632
00:46:20,119 --> 00:46:21,190
people and you're just running

1633
00:46:21,329 --> 00:46:22,880
around micromanaging all of them

1634
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,599
it's like you're almost doing more

1635
00:46:24,610 --> 00:46:26,150
and more annoying work than you

1636
00:46:26,239 --> 00:46:26,320
were

1637
00:46:26,449 --> 00:46:28,130
doing before and so first off the

1638
00:46:28,199 --> 00:46:29,940
reason for the performance based

1639
00:46:30,349 --> 00:46:31,610
compensation structures

1640
00:46:31,969 --> 00:46:33,650
the reason they're so great is

1641
00:46:33,719 --> 00:46:35,460
because they make it so you almost

1642
00:46:35,869 --> 00:46:37,519
never have to micromanage

1643
00:46:37,650 --> 00:46:39,000
the only reason you have to

1644
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,659
micromanage is if they're not

1645
00:46:40,659 --> 00:46:42,800
doing things that are adding value

1646
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:42,809
but

1647
00:46:43,010 --> 00:46:43,650
if they're compensated on adding

1648
00:46:43,659 --> 00:46:45,730
value they're going to do those

1649
00:46:45,730 --> 00:46:48,000
things naturally because they want

1650
00:46:48,030 --> 00:46:48,239
to get

1651
00:46:48,369 --> 00:46:49,719
paid right not just because you

1652
00:46:49,719 --> 00:46:51,500
want them to but you can also do a

1653
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:53,519
couple of other things to manage

1654
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:53,530
and

1655
00:46:53,809 --> 00:46:55,869
improve performance ongoing so one

1656
00:46:55,869 --> 00:46:57,829
of those is having mandatory end

1657
00:46:57,829 --> 00:46:59,280
of day type forms which we'll

1658
00:46:59,409 --> 00:47:01,349
get into weekly team meetings

1659
00:47:01,349 --> 00:47:03,750
where you review kpis call reviews

1660
00:47:03,889 --> 00:47:05,920
or like george was asking review

1661
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:06,480
their

1662
00:47:06,610 --> 00:47:07,889
work whatever that looks like to

1663
00:47:07,889 --> 00:47:08,929
find their work or their

1664
00:47:08,929 --> 00:47:10,730
deliverables and review those and

1665
00:47:10,730 --> 00:47:11,219
then

1666
00:47:11,409 --> 00:47:13,170
implement a pip when necessary a

1667
00:47:13,170 --> 00:47:14,869
pip is a performance improvement

1668
00:47:15,309 --> 00:47:16,559
plan the the times to implement

1669
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:16,960
those

1670
00:47:17,090 --> 00:47:18,760
are when kpis are being missed

1671
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:20,940
they're not showing initiative and

1672
00:47:20,989 --> 00:47:23,039
there's other red flags that come

1673
00:47:23,170 --> 00:47:25,059
up that you guys could probably uh

1674
00:47:25,059 --> 00:47:27,019
you know know when to implement a

1675
00:47:27,070 --> 00:47:28,960
pip but what a pip looks like is

1676
00:47:29,090 --> 00:47:30,769
just getting clear on exactly why

1677
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:32,239
and when and what they're

1678
00:47:32,239 --> 00:47:34,239
underperforming on creating a

1679
00:47:34,679 --> 00:47:35,599
30-day improvement

1680
00:47:35,809 --> 00:47:37,190
plan with them and then making a

1681
00:47:37,190 --> 00:47:38,690
real effort to help them that's

1682
00:47:38,690 --> 00:47:40,079
like one of the most important

1683
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:40,159
parts

1684
00:47:40,449 --> 00:47:41,800
of a pip is like we're in this

1685
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:43,400
together type of vibe it's not

1686
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:45,360
like i'm disciplining you because

1687
00:47:45,369 --> 00:47:45,610
you suck

1688
00:47:45,969 --> 00:47:47,530
and you're underperforming turn

1689
00:47:47,530 --> 00:47:49,099
around or you're gone it's like

1690
00:47:49,099 --> 00:47:50,960
you're underperforming but i want

1691
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:51,599
to help

1692
00:47:51,730 --> 00:47:53,590
before i just let you go and that

1693
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:55,219
does a lot that can turn around

1694
00:47:55,630 --> 00:47:58,239
underperformers and put them back

1695
00:47:58,449 --> 00:48:00,070
on track to being an a player or

1696
00:48:00,070 --> 00:48:01,880
what a pip does really nicely is

1697
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:03,269
it almost forces people out

1698
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:03,599
without

1699
00:48:03,730 --> 00:48:05,050
you having to have like andy was

1700
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:06,639
saying the awkward conversation

1701
00:48:06,639 --> 00:48:07,989
firing someone a lot of people

1702
00:48:07,989 --> 00:48:08,079
will

1703
00:48:08,289 --> 00:48:10,079
just leave after something like

1704
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:12,550
this and so uh here's some

1705
00:48:12,550 --> 00:48:15,789
performance tracking tools that

1706
00:48:15,849 --> 00:48:16,239
you guys can

1707
00:48:16,369 --> 00:48:17,780
go through and implement uh on

1708
00:48:17,889 --> 00:48:19,519
your on your trips back home so

1709
00:48:19,519 --> 00:48:21,440
number one is end of day type form

1710
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:21,599
in my

1711
00:48:21,889 --> 00:48:23,440
end of day type form i've tested

1712
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,159
so many different ways of

1713
00:48:25,159 --> 00:48:27,679
structuring these things but the

1714
00:48:27,679 --> 00:48:27,880
best

1715
00:48:28,050 --> 00:48:29,670
structure i've ever come up with

1716
00:48:29,670 --> 00:48:31,409
for this uh is the following four

1717
00:48:31,429 --> 00:48:33,199
questions here's what i did today

1718
00:48:33,409 --> 00:48:35,559
here's what i'm currently working

1719
00:48:35,559 --> 00:48:37,599
on here's what i need help with

1720
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:39,619
and here's how i'd rate my day and

1721
00:48:39,710 --> 00:48:39,920
why

1722
00:48:40,050 --> 00:48:42,269
four questions and let them fill

1723
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:44,389
in for whatever they feel they

1724
00:48:44,469 --> 00:48:46,480
need to fill in for that day

1725
00:48:46,610 --> 00:48:48,000
and then all you're doing is

1726
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,559
you're setting up a type form

1727
00:48:49,570 --> 00:48:51,519
automation into a specific slack

1728
00:48:51,519 --> 00:48:52,239
channel

1729
00:48:52,369 --> 00:48:53,900
and you're reading through all

1730
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:55,760
their responses and you're seeing

1731
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:57,519
what did they do today you can ask

1732
00:48:57,650 --> 00:48:58,769
questions on that what do they

1733
00:48:58,769 --> 00:48:59,980
need help with you can provide

1734
00:49:00,090 --> 00:49:01,440
help right there in slack what are

1735
00:49:01,550 --> 00:49:01,920
they

1736
00:49:02,050 --> 00:49:03,070
currently working on you can see

1737
00:49:03,070 --> 00:49:04,170
if they're working on the right

1738
00:49:04,170 --> 00:49:05,369
things and if not you can court

1739
00:49:05,369 --> 00:49:05,429
you

1740
00:49:05,570 --> 00:49:06,989
could course correct and then

1741
00:49:06,989 --> 00:49:08,719
write their day maybe someone put

1742
00:49:08,719 --> 00:49:10,480
two out of ten day rating because

1743
00:49:10,610 --> 00:49:12,230
they got bad news from a family

1744
00:49:12,230 --> 00:49:13,679
member dan touched on the

1745
00:49:13,730 --> 00:49:15,360
importance of also checking in

1746
00:49:15,510 --> 00:49:15,679
with your

1747
00:49:15,809 --> 00:49:17,219
team not just in the business

1748
00:49:17,289 --> 00:49:18,969
realm but also from a personal

1749
00:49:18,969 --> 00:49:20,800
side of things because you're

1750
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:21,039
working with

1751
00:49:21,329 --> 00:49:23,010
humans at the end of the day um

1752
00:49:23,079 --> 00:49:24,809
the next one here schedule weekly

1753
00:49:25,230 --> 00:49:27,030
team meetings with proper notes so

1754
00:49:27,099 --> 00:49:28,340
a lot of you are doing team

1755
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:30,110
meetings but you have no idea what

1756
00:49:30,110 --> 00:49:31,780
to talk about there's no structure

1757
00:49:32,070 --> 00:49:32,880
you lose

1758
00:49:33,010 --> 00:49:34,769
control people are talking over

1759
00:49:34,769 --> 00:49:36,500
you and it almost feels like you

1760
00:49:36,869 --> 00:49:39,000
just wasted 30 minutes and so the

1761
00:49:39,170 --> 00:49:40,329
easiest structure to follow for

1762
00:49:40,329 --> 00:49:41,679
team meetings is start with wins

1763
00:49:41,679 --> 00:49:45,119
set the set the vibe um get you

1764
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:45,360
know the

1765
00:49:45,489 --> 00:49:47,820
culture right get people excited

1766
00:49:47,929 --> 00:49:50,280
and then go into kpi updates the

1767
00:49:50,380 --> 00:49:52,000
kpi updates on team meetings

1768
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:52,559
should

1769
00:49:52,690 --> 00:49:54,739
align with how that specific team

1770
00:49:54,739 --> 00:49:56,829
is paid on the performance based

1771
00:49:56,829 --> 00:49:58,639
side of things so if if we flip

1772
00:49:58,769 --> 00:50:00,440
back to that scorecard example

1773
00:50:00,519 --> 00:50:02,239
earlier on when i do weekly team

1774
00:50:02,670 --> 00:50:03,920
meetings with my cold email

1775
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:03,920
systems

1776
00:50:04,449 --> 00:50:06,550
engineers i update them on churn

1777
00:50:06,550 --> 00:50:08,690
rate nrr average days to launch

1778
00:50:08,690 --> 00:50:10,239
and how many calendar calls

1779
00:50:10,239 --> 00:50:10,400
they've

1780
00:50:10,530 --> 00:50:12,190
completed so far this month so

1781
00:50:12,190 --> 00:50:14,269
they know exactly where they're at

1782
00:50:14,409 --> 00:50:16,400
in relation to their bonus at any

1783
00:50:16,530 --> 00:50:17,900
point in the month and again if

1784
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:19,570
they're off track they can course

1785
00:50:19,570 --> 00:50:24,050
correct right so uh that's the

1786
00:50:24,369 --> 00:50:24,559
weekly

1787
00:50:24,690 --> 00:50:26,670
team meeting structure and then

1788
00:50:26,670 --> 00:50:28,909
action for you guys there's almost

1789
00:50:28,909 --> 00:50:30,800
a hundred percent chance that

1790
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:31,039
there's

1791
00:50:31,170 --> 00:50:33,119
an underperformer on your team

1792
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:35,280
right now that you need to pip and

1793
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:38,659
so pip them right uh really simple

1794
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:38,960
have a

1795
00:50:39,090 --> 00:50:40,119
written agreement with

1796
00:50:40,179 --> 00:50:41,659
expectations conduct weekly

1797
00:50:41,670 --> 00:50:43,349
one-on-ones and if you don't see

1798
00:50:43,349 --> 00:50:44,280
any improvement

1799
00:50:44,530 --> 00:50:46,010
fire them fast and move on if you

1800
00:50:46,050 --> 00:50:47,400
don't fire someone that's

1801
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:50,079
underperforming not only are you

1802
00:50:50,210 --> 00:50:51,690
not getting your money's worth

1803
00:50:51,730 --> 00:50:53,190
from that person but you're

1804
00:50:53,190 --> 00:50:54,550
creating a cancer within your

1805
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:55,400
organization

1806
00:50:55,809 --> 00:50:58,019
because the last thing an a player

1807
00:50:58,019 --> 00:51:00,150
wants is to show up to work and be

1808
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:01,679
surrounded by people that

1809
00:51:01,809 --> 00:51:03,769
have lower standards than them and

1810
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:05,380
the last thing they want in a

1811
00:51:05,710 --> 00:51:06,800
leader is someone that doesn't

1812
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:07,039
hold those

1813
00:51:07,409 --> 00:51:08,829
standards and allows for

1814
00:51:08,889 --> 00:51:11,440
underperformance they'll lose

1815
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:13,619
respect for you and i'm going to

1816
00:51:13,710 --> 00:51:14,250
get into

1817
00:51:14,449 --> 00:51:16,489
uh a slide next that goes into you

1818
00:51:16,489 --> 00:51:18,170
as a leader and how you're

1819
00:51:18,349 --> 00:51:20,800
supposed to show up um but i kind

1820
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:20,960
of

1821
00:51:21,090 --> 00:51:22,489
hit on it right there and it's so

1822
00:51:22,489 --> 00:51:24,030
important like you have to fire

1823
00:51:24,039 --> 00:51:25,760
people that are underperforming

1824
00:51:27,010 --> 00:51:27,940
you do it in a way that's

1825
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:29,480
respectful right and you do it in

1826
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:31,039
a way that you at least gave them

1827
00:51:31,039 --> 00:51:31,349
a chance

1828
00:51:31,550 --> 00:51:32,900
to get back on track so it's a lot

1829
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:34,489
easier of a conversation because

1830
00:51:34,489 --> 00:51:35,840
it's not abrupt and it's not

1831
00:51:35,969 --> 00:51:37,639
surprising at that point but don't

1832
00:51:37,719 --> 00:51:39,400
delay that decision because by

1833
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:41,969
delaying the decision you're

1834
00:51:42,050 --> 00:51:42,400
having a

1835
00:51:42,530 --> 00:51:44,099
negative impact on your culture

1836
00:51:44,099 --> 00:51:45,860
you're losing respect as a leader

1837
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:47,679
and your a players are starting to

1838
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:48,320
think of

1839
00:51:48,449 --> 00:51:50,059
going elsewhere because they hate

1840
00:51:50,059 --> 00:51:51,619
showing up to work and not being

1841
00:51:51,619 --> 00:51:54,320
surrounded by other a players

1842
00:51:54,449 --> 00:51:56,119
so one last slide and then we can

1843
00:51:56,199 --> 00:51:58,480
do q and a i think sorry two more

1844
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:02,139
slides shit uh how to keep your a

1845
00:52:02,289 --> 00:52:03,960
players producing forever um same

1846
00:52:04,039 --> 00:52:06,369
way again you want to keep your

1847
00:52:06,369 --> 00:52:08,639
clients forever you want to keep

1848
00:52:08,639 --> 00:52:08,800
your

1849
00:52:08,929 --> 00:52:10,480
clients paying forever you want to

1850
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:11,909
keep your a players not just on

1851
00:52:11,909 --> 00:52:13,269
the team but continuing to

1852
00:52:13,409 --> 00:52:14,949
produce right there's kind of like

1853
00:52:14,949 --> 00:52:16,349
a drop off after the beginning

1854
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:17,760
phase like the honeymoon phase

1855
00:52:18,050 --> 00:52:19,079
you hear about this in the

1856
00:52:19,139 --> 00:52:20,679
relationship world right how do

1857
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:22,380
you continue the honeymoon phase

1858
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:22,789
forever

1859
00:52:22,929 --> 00:52:25,000
so on a hiring side a players need

1860
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,219
growth opportunities they need

1861
00:52:27,219 --> 00:52:28,480
recognition they need

1862
00:52:28,610 --> 00:52:30,420
performance-based incentives and

1863
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:32,099
once you identify the a player in

1864
00:52:32,179 --> 00:52:33,199
your organization

1865
00:52:33,409 --> 00:52:35,739
it's time to invest significantly

1866
00:52:35,849 --> 00:52:38,070
more time to develop them into a

1867
00:52:38,309 --> 00:52:39,909
leader for your company

1868
00:52:40,050 --> 00:52:41,389
don't wait right i think gary vee

1869
00:52:41,389 --> 00:52:42,769
has a saying where it's like hire

1870
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:44,320
fast fire faster but promote

1871
00:52:44,449 --> 00:52:46,449
faster or promote fastest and so

1872
00:52:46,449 --> 00:52:48,659
like when you see that someone's a

1873
00:52:48,659 --> 00:52:50,159
killer and an a player

1874
00:52:50,289 --> 00:52:52,429
the ways to identify those people

1875
00:52:52,429 --> 00:52:54,630
is they're self-sufficient they

1876
00:52:54,860 --> 00:52:56,480
exceed kpis they take initiative

1877
00:52:56,610 --> 00:52:57,610
but beyond the specific

1878
00:52:57,610 --> 00:52:59,130
responsibilities you assign to

1879
00:52:59,130 --> 00:53:00,800
them they're proactive in solving

1880
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:01,519
problems and helping

1881
00:53:01,650 --> 00:53:03,070
the team and they're willing to

1882
00:53:03,090 --> 00:53:05,010
push back on your ideas it's the

1883
00:53:05,019 --> 00:53:06,880
one people hate it's the one we

1884
00:53:07,239 --> 00:53:07,760
hate

1885
00:53:07,889 --> 00:53:09,289
because we have big egos you show

1886
00:53:09,289 --> 00:53:10,760
up to a team meeting you present

1887
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:12,159
this idea that you think is

1888
00:53:12,289 --> 00:53:14,170
sick and then your guys are like

1889
00:53:14,170 --> 00:53:16,320
that's not going to work it's like

1890
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:18,280
that's what you are looking for

1891
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:20,449
a players are willing to speak up

1892
00:53:20,449 --> 00:53:22,329
and push back on your ideas a

1893
00:53:22,349 --> 00:53:24,559
players are not the ones that

1894
00:53:24,690 --> 00:53:26,360
just think every idea and

1895
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:28,949
everything that you say is right

1896
00:53:28,949 --> 00:53:30,559
and amazing because they're just

1897
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:31,119
pandering

1898
00:53:31,219 --> 00:53:32,369
to you those are not a players a

1899
00:53:32,369 --> 00:53:33,769
players can think for themselves

1900
00:53:33,769 --> 00:53:34,730
because what's going to happen

1901
00:53:34,869 --> 00:53:35,039
when

1902
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:36,480
you're gone you're not in the

1903
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:38,150
day-to-day and they need to think

1904
00:53:38,150 --> 00:53:40,320
on their own and lead another team

1905
00:53:40,530 --> 00:53:42,199
you want them to be able to come

1906
00:53:42,199 --> 00:53:44,389
with their own ideas again it's

1907
00:53:44,429 --> 00:53:46,880
not the greatest feeling when you

1908
00:53:47,010 --> 00:53:48,320
when you have this but if you

1909
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:49,869
think about it this way you'll

1910
00:53:49,869 --> 00:53:51,369
actually be happy when you hear a

1911
00:53:51,429 --> 00:53:51,599
team

1912
00:53:51,730 --> 00:53:53,489
member push back on your next idea

1913
00:53:53,489 --> 00:53:55,219
and so then how to retain them now

1914
00:53:55,570 --> 00:53:56,889
that you have identified them

1915
00:53:57,250 --> 00:53:58,659
get clarity on their career goals

1916
00:53:58,769 --> 00:54:00,139
and how you can help them get

1917
00:54:00,139 --> 00:54:02,239
there number one most important

1918
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:02,409
whether

1919
00:54:02,769 --> 00:54:04,440
it's financially whether it's uh

1920
00:54:04,519 --> 00:54:06,170
where they want to live whether

1921
00:54:06,170 --> 00:54:07,840
it's the type of work they want to

1922
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:08,480
do

1923
00:54:08,610 --> 00:54:10,429
the work schedule whatever it is

1924
00:54:10,429 --> 00:54:12,119
get clarity on those goals help

1925
00:54:12,510 --> 00:54:14,809
them get there through the role

1926
00:54:15,010 --> 00:54:16,650
that you have them in uh spend way

1927
00:54:16,650 --> 00:54:18,340
more one-on-one time with them

1928
00:54:18,340 --> 00:54:20,170
right i feel like most of us spend

1929
00:54:20,369 --> 00:54:21,920
way more one-on-one time with our

1930
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:23,719
underperformers trying to get them

1931
00:54:23,719 --> 00:54:25,360
back on track and by doing so we

1932
00:54:25,489 --> 00:54:27,320
neglect the overperformers but we

1933
00:54:27,329 --> 00:54:28,960
really should be flip-flopping

1934
00:54:29,389 --> 00:54:31,039
that and spending all of our time

1935
00:54:31,170 --> 00:54:32,349
with the guys that actually

1936
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:34,039
deserve our time and so spend way

1937
00:54:34,039 --> 00:54:35,760
more time with your a players uh

1938
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:35,989
give

1939
00:54:36,130 --> 00:54:37,940
them shout outs and recognition uh

1940
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:39,599
paint a future vision for where

1941
00:54:39,679 --> 00:54:41,199
this company is going right you

1942
00:54:41,329 --> 00:54:42,510
want to get them excited that

1943
00:54:42,599 --> 00:54:44,059
they're investing their time in

1944
00:54:44,139 --> 00:54:45,679
their career and a leader that's

1945
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:46,150
actually

1946
00:54:46,289 --> 00:54:47,960
going somewhere this this company

1947
00:54:48,039 --> 00:54:49,650
is not just you know existing for

1948
00:54:49,670 --> 00:54:51,199
a couple of months and then it's

1949
00:54:51,329 --> 00:54:52,280
going to fall off the map and

1950
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:53,510
you're going to go do something

1951
00:54:53,510 --> 00:54:54,800
else like show them a long-term

1952
00:54:55,230 --> 00:54:55,440
vision

1953
00:54:55,570 --> 00:54:56,920
and then give them upside upside

1954
00:54:56,920 --> 00:54:57,900
can come again through

1955
00:54:58,010 --> 00:54:59,679
performance-based incentives but

1956
00:54:59,679 --> 00:54:59,909
it could

1957
00:55:00,050 --> 00:55:01,389
also come through promotion

1958
00:55:01,389 --> 00:55:03,239
opportunities upgrading them to an

1959
00:55:03,239 --> 00:55:05,039
actual leader within the company

1960
00:55:05,039 --> 00:55:05,210
and so

1961
00:55:05,489 --> 00:55:07,059
many other things so quick action

1962
00:55:07,059 --> 00:55:08,750
items here identify at least one a

1963
00:55:08,750 --> 00:55:10,719
player and promote them to being a

1964
00:55:11,010 --> 00:55:13,039
player coach this makes sense uh

1965
00:55:13,039 --> 00:55:15,119
if you have like let's say three

1966
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:17,360
or four onboarding specialists

1967
00:55:18,530 --> 00:55:19,639
promote one of those onboarding

1968
00:55:19,639 --> 00:55:20,860
specialists to be a player coach

1969
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:22,000
meaning they're still an

1970
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:22,400
onboarding

1971
00:55:22,530 --> 00:55:23,920
specialist but they're also

1972
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:25,559
coaching and leading the other

1973
00:55:25,559 --> 00:55:27,519
three onboarding specialists so

1974
00:55:27,519 --> 00:55:27,679
it's almost

1975
00:55:27,969 --> 00:55:29,860
like a trial role that eventually

1976
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:31,579
then leads to them becoming a

1977
00:55:31,860 --> 00:55:33,679
full-time leader uh if you guys

1978
00:55:33,750 --> 00:55:33,920
are

1979
00:55:34,050 --> 00:55:35,719
in client ascension most of you

1980
00:55:35,809 --> 00:55:37,280
are uh you know andy who's a

1981
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:40,250
student success coach andy was one

1982
00:55:40,349 --> 00:55:40,559
of four

1983
00:55:40,929 --> 00:55:42,550
student success coaches and over

1984
00:55:42,550 --> 00:55:44,000
time i identified andy as an a

1985
00:55:44,050 --> 00:55:45,510
player because of all these

1986
00:55:45,829 --> 00:55:46,079
reasons and so

1987
00:55:46,219 --> 00:55:47,670
i told andy look i have a vision

1988
00:55:47,670 --> 00:55:49,230
for you long term to run the team

1989
00:55:49,230 --> 00:55:51,360
of student success coaches is that

1990
00:55:51,489 --> 00:55:53,159
something you'd be interested in

1991
00:55:53,239 --> 00:55:54,949
yes okay cool so i start working

1992
00:55:54,949 --> 00:55:56,400
on that idea and i eventually

1993
00:55:56,530 --> 00:55:57,889
make him a player coach he stays

1994
00:55:57,889 --> 00:55:59,400
student success coach but then

1995
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:01,719
he's also getting on one-on-ones

1996
00:56:02,130 --> 00:56:03,769
checking in update type forms

1997
00:56:03,769 --> 00:56:05,610
running team meetings and managing

1998
00:56:06,030 --> 00:56:07,760
the entire team of student success

1999
00:56:07,889 --> 00:56:09,559
coaches which frees up my time for

2000
00:56:09,559 --> 00:56:11,119
managing four people to only

2001
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:13,039
manage one person make sense

2002
00:56:14,849 --> 00:56:16,030
and then that second one is to

2003
00:56:16,030 --> 00:56:17,440
create a wins channel in slack

2004
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:20,480
create a wins channel on your

2005
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:20,960
slack

2006
00:56:21,090 --> 00:56:23,000
internally right when your team is

2007
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,030
out there doing really cool things

2008
00:56:25,030 --> 00:56:26,639
for your company a lot of times

2009
00:56:26,769 --> 00:56:28,530
it gets swept under the rug no one

2010
00:56:28,530 --> 00:56:30,239
sees about it no one cares about

2011
00:56:30,329 --> 00:56:32,480
it and they feel underappreciated

2012
00:56:32,610 --> 00:56:33,969
create a wins channel and

2013
00:56:33,969 --> 00:56:35,869
encourage your team to post in it

2014
00:56:35,869 --> 00:56:37,679
and when they do go crazy with the

2015
00:56:37,679 --> 00:56:37,760
slack

2016
00:56:38,050 --> 00:56:40,369
emojis people love that people

2017
00:56:40,369 --> 00:56:44,159
love that yeah

2018
00:56:44,210 --> 00:56:44,320
i'm

2019
00:56:44,449 --> 00:57:02,889
i love it all right one more slide

2020
00:57:03,139 --> 00:57:04,480
and then we could get into q a

2021
00:57:04,610 --> 00:57:09,769
um so again this all falls back on

2022
00:57:10,199 --> 00:57:11,980
you being able to step into a

2023
00:57:11,980 --> 00:57:13,840
leadership role right so

2024
00:57:13,969 --> 00:57:15,739
the question becomes how you can

2025
00:57:15,739 --> 00:57:18,079
become a better leader and so i

2026
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:19,360
heard this recently and this was

2027
00:57:19,489 --> 00:57:21,519
like the best this is like the

2028
00:57:21,519 --> 00:57:22,969
best leadership tip i've ever

2029
00:57:23,380 --> 00:57:24,679
heard and it was about donald

2030
00:57:25,079 --> 00:57:25,280
trump

2031
00:57:26,449 --> 00:57:27,630
and patrick bet david was

2032
00:57:27,719 --> 00:57:29,659
basically describing like what

2033
00:57:29,659 --> 00:57:31,579
donald trump has essentially

2034
00:57:31,579 --> 00:57:32,400
turned into

2035
00:57:32,530 --> 00:57:34,090
recently i don't know who's a fan

2036
00:57:34,090 --> 00:57:35,570
of trump who's not but i think

2037
00:57:35,570 --> 00:57:37,719
you'll resonate uh with what

2038
00:57:38,130 --> 00:57:40,260
patrick bet david calls trifecta

2039
00:57:40,260 --> 00:57:41,889
mode he's talking about this from

2040
00:57:41,929 --> 00:57:43,119
a leadership perspective

2041
00:57:43,250 --> 00:57:45,739
donald trump has achieved trifecta

2042
00:57:45,739 --> 00:57:48,070
mode he's currently in trifecta

2043
00:57:48,150 --> 00:57:50,639
mode which means he's respected

2044
00:57:51,809 --> 00:57:54,019
he's feared but at the same time

2045
00:57:54,019 --> 00:57:56,420
he's liked and he's got all three

2046
00:57:56,420 --> 00:57:59,269
of those things a lot of us just

2047
00:57:59,409 --> 00:58:00,960
want to be liked and so when we

2048
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:02,699
just want to be liked we're not

2049
00:58:02,699 --> 00:58:04,559
telling our underperformers that

2050
00:58:04,559 --> 00:58:04,800
they

2051
00:58:04,929 --> 00:58:06,210
need to step it up and we're not

2052
00:58:06,210 --> 00:58:07,789
pipping them we're not firing the

2053
00:58:07,789 --> 00:58:09,269
people that shouldn't be on the

2054
00:58:09,269 --> 00:58:09,519
team

2055
00:58:09,650 --> 00:58:10,800
anymore because we want them to

2056
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:13,110
like us we're not feared because

2057
00:58:13,250 --> 00:58:17,150
we're not we're not expecting and

2058
00:58:17,329 --> 00:58:18,349
actually holding the team

2059
00:58:18,349 --> 00:58:19,860
accountable to the standards that

2060
00:58:19,860 --> 00:58:21,670
we've set and so all the things

2061
00:58:21,809 --> 00:58:23,769
that i'm explaining to you guys is

2062
00:58:23,769 --> 00:58:25,769
so that you can get into trifecta

2063
00:58:25,769 --> 00:58:28,000
mode where you're respected as a

2064
00:58:28,130 --> 00:58:30,280
leader you're feared as a leader

2065
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:32,400
because they have no idea what

2066
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:34,480
you're gonna do or if they don't

2067
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:34,639
do

2068
00:58:34,849 --> 00:58:36,199
certain things they're they're

2069
00:58:36,199 --> 00:58:37,670
scared to tell you right i've had

2070
00:58:37,670 --> 00:58:39,190
team members tell me this and it's

2071
00:58:39,190 --> 00:58:39,309
not

2072
00:58:39,429 --> 00:58:41,250
a great thing to hear all the time

2073
00:58:41,250 --> 00:58:43,059
but part of it knowing that i'm i

2074
00:58:43,090 --> 00:58:44,639
ear on the the side of being liked

2075
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:45,869
a lot more but like when they get

2076
00:58:45,869 --> 00:58:46,840
a dm from me they're kind of

2077
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:48,480
scared to open it they're like

2078
00:58:48,610 --> 00:58:50,440
oh shit what's what's andre gonna

2079
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:52,099
yell at me for this time and so

2080
00:58:52,110 --> 00:58:53,769
like that that's good feedback

2081
00:58:54,130 --> 00:58:55,920
because i again i i over index i'm

2082
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:57,820
being liked and so to hear that it

2083
00:58:58,030 --> 00:58:59,679
means yeah i'm starting to be

2084
00:58:59,809 --> 00:59:01,570
more like a leader who's feared

2085
00:59:01,570 --> 00:59:03,239
but at the same time is still

2086
00:59:03,239 --> 00:59:04,960
liked right so if you can achieve

2087
00:59:05,489 --> 00:59:07,159
trifecta mode you can run up a

2088
00:59:07,239 --> 00:59:09,429
massive organization with a ton of

2089
00:59:09,429 --> 00:59:11,920
a ton of a players working for you

2090
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:12,420
and so

2091
00:59:12,610 --> 00:59:14,760
how you show up for your team sets

2092
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:16,940
the standards this is also what

2093
00:59:17,179 --> 00:59:18,800
culture is and so three things

2094
00:59:18,929 --> 00:59:20,480
model the behavior you expect show

2095
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:21,900
up early leave late do what you

2096
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:23,519
say you're going to do over

2097
00:59:23,650 --> 00:59:24,820
communicate always take

2098
00:59:24,829 --> 00:59:26,719
responsibility constantly level up

2099
00:59:26,769 --> 00:59:28,369
by investing time into training

2100
00:59:28,559 --> 00:59:29,039
right all of

2101
00:59:29,170 --> 00:59:30,710
you guys as business owners go

2102
00:59:30,710 --> 00:59:32,440
back to your teams on monday and

2103
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:34,320
and tell them about the training

2104
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:34,329
that

2105
00:59:34,610 --> 00:59:36,019
you receive right if you go

2106
00:59:36,019 --> 00:59:38,039
through training they're going to

2107
00:59:38,039 --> 00:59:39,840
be more motivated and excited to

2108
00:59:39,969 --> 00:59:40,079
go

2109
00:59:40,210 --> 00:59:41,210
through training if you just

2110
00:59:41,210 --> 00:59:42,400
assign them a bunch of training

2111
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:43,469
and you don't go through any

2112
00:59:43,469 --> 00:59:43,679
training

2113
00:59:44,050 --> 00:59:45,630
yourself it's kind of it's

2114
00:59:45,630 --> 00:59:48,079
backwards you want to model the

2115
00:59:48,079 --> 00:59:50,559
behavior right that you expect

2116
00:59:51,119 --> 00:59:52,239
from them so

2117
00:59:52,369 --> 00:59:54,389
you're here for training there you

2118
00:59:54,389 --> 00:59:56,170
go talk about it step into the

2119
00:59:56,269 --> 00:59:58,239
challenges to squash uncertainty

2120
00:59:58,369 --> 00:59:59,940
and inspire a great example of

2121
00:59:59,940 --> 01:00:01,570
this dan and i reference each

2122
01:00:01,570 --> 01:00:03,519
other a lot in our presentations

2123
01:00:03,650 --> 01:00:04,969
because it's really the same topic

2124
01:00:04,969 --> 01:00:06,119
it's just for two different

2125
01:00:06,119 --> 01:00:07,429
departments but like a great

2126
01:00:07,550 --> 01:00:07,760
example

2127
01:00:07,869 --> 01:00:09,369
of squashing uncertainty and then

2128
01:00:09,409 --> 01:00:10,880
also using the opportunity to

2129
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:13,599
squash uncertainty to also inspire

2130
01:00:13,730 --> 01:00:15,610
is when dan put himself back on

2131
01:00:15,610 --> 01:00:17,630
calendar when sales are low or

2132
01:00:17,630 --> 01:00:19,920
close rate decrease to prove that

2133
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:20,159
it's not

2134
01:00:20,260 --> 01:00:23,010
a lead quality issue it's a skill

2135
01:00:23,099 --> 01:00:25,440
issue or a mindset issue or a

2136
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:28,159
behavior issue it's just not a

2137
01:00:28,159 --> 01:00:28,400
lead

2138
01:00:28,530 --> 01:00:30,079
quality issue because dan was able

2139
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:31,559
to go back on calendar and close

2140
01:00:31,559 --> 01:00:32,860
at the rate that they were

2141
01:00:33,010 --> 01:00:34,429
previously closing at so there's

2142
01:00:34,530 --> 01:00:35,929
something else here and again it

2143
01:00:35,929 --> 01:00:37,199
squashes uncertainty the

2144
01:00:37,199 --> 01:00:37,619
uncertainty

2145
01:00:37,809 --> 01:00:38,989
about the lead quality and it also

2146
01:00:39,079 --> 01:00:40,329
inspires them to see that they

2147
01:00:40,329 --> 01:00:41,320
have a leader that's willing

2148
01:00:41,570 --> 01:00:43,599
to get back into the trenches with

2149
01:00:43,599 --> 01:00:45,599
them and do the work and then the

2150
01:00:45,599 --> 01:00:47,269
last one is be proactive and

2151
01:00:47,409 --> 01:00:49,380
direct as a leader you have to be

2152
01:00:49,380 --> 01:00:51,639
proactive and direct so set clear

2153
01:00:51,639 --> 01:00:53,840
expectations and actually hold

2154
01:00:53,969 --> 01:00:55,320
your team accountable to getting

2155
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:56,869
the results and doing these things

2156
01:00:56,869 --> 01:00:58,000
and then address issues

2157
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,130
immediately

2158
01:00:59,329 --> 01:01:00,699
before they become bigger problems

2159
01:01:00,699 --> 01:01:01,920
the last thing you want to get

2160
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:03,119
caught up you know spending your

2161
01:01:03,230 --> 01:01:03,440
time

2162
01:01:03,570 --> 01:01:05,690
in is drama and you can do this by

2163
01:01:05,690 --> 01:01:07,909
just squashing and solving and

2164
01:01:08,139 --> 01:01:10,880
addressing issues immediately when

2165
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:11,030
they

2166
01:01:11,170 --> 01:01:12,579
come up and not letting them go on

2167
01:01:12,690 --> 01:01:14,320
any further but again the entire

2168
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:16,869
goal is to get into trifecta

2169
01:01:17,010 --> 01:01:21,579
that's why he's such an effective

2170
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:26,559
leader at a time he was only fear

2171
01:01:26,559 --> 01:01:27,920
he wasn't respect he wasn't

2172
01:01:28,050 --> 01:01:29,349
like but now at this point in

2173
01:01:29,349 --> 01:01:31,079
history he's hitting all three of

2174
01:01:31,079 --> 01:01:32,800
those boxes which is why you're

2175
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:33,119
seeing

2176
01:01:33,250 --> 01:01:34,920
such like a euphoric reaction to

2177
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:36,579
where we're at as a country and

2178
01:01:36,579 --> 01:01:38,400
how he's approaching this new

2179
01:01:38,530 --> 01:01:40,010
administration and you guys can

2180
01:01:40,050 --> 01:01:41,590
achieve that same thing within

2181
01:01:41,590 --> 01:01:45,039
your businesses and so that's all

2182
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:46,239
we made it to

2183
01:01:46,369 --> 01:01:53,880
the end uh thank you sweet all

2184
01:01:54,219 --> 01:01:57,150
right uh we got time for questions

2185
01:01:57,159 --> 01:01:57,760
still

2186
01:01:59,489 --> 01:02:12,880
um yeah if anyone has questions we

2187
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:12,880
can do it

2188
01:02:13,010 --> 01:02:30,079
yeah well i wouldn't create a

2189
01:02:30,170 --> 01:02:31,360
powerpoint and teach them anything

2190
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:32,639
because the trainings for you as

2191
01:02:32,639 --> 01:02:32,679
the

2192
01:02:32,849 --> 01:02:34,650
business owner and so it usually

2193
01:02:34,650 --> 01:02:36,489
doesn't trickle down to them in

2194
01:02:36,750 --> 01:02:38,530
their specific role it's more so

2195
01:02:38,530 --> 01:02:39,360
again like a

2196
01:02:39,510 --> 01:02:40,980
a respect thing of like okay

2197
01:02:41,090 --> 01:02:42,920
george asked me to do something

2198
01:02:42,949 --> 01:02:44,710
but he also is out there doing it

2199
01:02:44,710 --> 01:02:44,960
and so

2200
01:02:45,039 --> 01:02:47,099
i respect this guy right um and so

2201
01:02:47,099 --> 01:02:49,300
with training i would simply just

2202
01:02:49,300 --> 01:02:51,289
document the fact that you're

2203
01:02:51,489 --> 01:02:53,110
coming out here like tell your

2204
01:02:53,110 --> 01:02:54,969
team like hey this weekend i'm

2205
01:02:55,389 --> 01:02:57,119
traveling uh to florida to go meet

2206
01:02:57,119 --> 01:02:57,190
with

2207
01:02:57,329 --> 01:02:58,650
these guys that have consulted and

2208
01:02:58,650 --> 01:02:59,900
helped us grow to this certain

2209
01:02:59,900 --> 01:03:01,599
point um they're actually the

2210
01:03:01,599 --> 01:03:01,679
reason

2211
01:03:01,900 --> 01:03:03,340
i've hired a lot of you guys and

2212
01:03:03,340 --> 01:03:04,690
so i'm excited to see you know

2213
01:03:04,780 --> 01:03:06,880
what their next level of learnings

2214
01:03:06,909 --> 01:03:07,119
is for

2215
01:03:07,250 --> 01:03:08,730
this business um and if you have

2216
01:03:08,769 --> 01:03:10,400
any questions on what i learned

2217
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:12,320
feel free i'm you know i have my

2218
01:03:12,449 --> 01:03:14,059
doors open that's it that's the

2219
01:03:14,059 --> 01:03:15,670
extent of it they just need to

2220
01:03:15,670 --> 01:03:18,650
hear it right um i think a lot of

2221
01:03:18,750 --> 01:03:18,960
uh

2222
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:20,579
entrepreneurs and business owners

2223
01:03:20,579 --> 01:03:21,880
fall into the trap of like they

2224
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:23,280
share their lifestyle on social

2225
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:23,750
media

2226
01:03:23,820 --> 01:03:25,369
a little bit too much and their

2227
01:03:25,409 --> 01:03:27,110
team sees that and they're like

2228
01:03:27,110 --> 01:03:29,039
what is this dude doing out at the

2229
01:03:29,039 --> 01:03:29,050
club

2230
01:03:29,409 --> 01:03:31,239
every night on a tuesday or he's

2231
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:32,900
in dubai and then he's in europe

2232
01:03:33,309 --> 01:03:35,199
and then he's not even working he

2233
01:03:35,329 --> 01:03:36,710
can't be and it's like no one

2234
01:03:36,710 --> 01:03:38,550
wants to work for that person they

2235
01:03:38,550 --> 01:03:40,239
want to be that person right

2236
01:03:40,239 --> 01:03:40,480
essentially

2237
01:03:41,010 --> 01:03:42,190
but if they see you hustling and

2238
01:03:42,280 --> 01:03:43,670
grinding and you know investing

2239
01:03:43,670 --> 01:03:45,119
back into the business and its

2240
01:03:45,119 --> 01:03:45,920
growth

2241
01:03:46,050 --> 01:03:47,530
they're going to respect you a lot

2242
01:03:47,570 --> 01:03:49,070
more so i gatekeep a lot of what i

2243
01:03:49,079 --> 01:03:50,619
do in my personal life

2244
01:03:50,769 --> 01:03:52,309
for that reason because i've heard

2245
01:03:52,309 --> 01:03:54,739
horror stories um and it's not

2246
01:03:54,739 --> 01:03:56,000
like i do that stuff for the most

2247
01:03:56,349 --> 01:03:57,119
part but

2248
01:03:57,250 --> 01:03:59,469
uh you you have to you have a

2249
01:03:59,559 --> 01:04:02,400
higher level of responsibility if

2250
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:03,760
there's a summer in a year

2251
01:04:04,329 --> 01:04:05,340
to the point where you have to

2252
01:04:05,340 --> 01:04:06,590
really like watch your everything

2253
01:04:10,369 --> 01:04:13,090
how long do you usually post like

2254
01:04:13,179 --> 01:04:16,360
tv for do you keep it 30 minutes

2255
01:04:16,449 --> 01:04:17,869
right max 30 minutes

2256
01:04:18,130 --> 01:04:20,230
now if you can't get it done in 30

2257
01:04:20,230 --> 01:04:22,159
minutes you're not you're over

2258
01:04:22,159 --> 01:04:24,239
over complicated the only reason

2259
01:04:24,369 --> 01:04:25,519
you can't get it over 30 minutes

2260
01:04:25,519 --> 01:04:26,699
is there's either too many people

2261
01:04:26,699 --> 01:04:27,840
on there which means you need to

2262
01:04:27,969 --> 01:04:30,070
teach the meetings down further by

2263
01:04:30,070 --> 01:04:32,219
department or you're not meeting

2264
01:04:32,219 --> 01:04:34,159
frequently enough so there's

2265
01:04:34,199 --> 01:04:35,320
a build-up of things that need to

2266
01:04:35,380 --> 01:04:36,630
get talked about because you're

2267
01:04:36,639 --> 01:04:39,110
waiting once a month or once every

2268
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:41,849
couple weeks prior than we did and

2269
01:04:41,849 --> 01:04:44,030
do you pay the team out at the end

2270
01:04:44,150 --> 01:04:46,159
of the month yeah last friday

2271
01:04:46,289 --> 01:04:48,510
of every month that's what i do

2272
01:04:48,599 --> 01:04:50,929
and how do you pay them out like

2273
01:04:51,190 --> 01:04:54,079
how do you pay them out ach uh it

2274
01:04:54,210 --> 01:04:56,010
depends where you're located so we

2275
01:04:56,010 --> 01:04:58,000
really just use wise.com which is

2276
01:04:58,110 --> 01:05:00,719
like a direct deposit ach bank

2277
01:05:00,719 --> 01:05:01,050
wire

2278
01:05:01,250 --> 01:05:03,369
or from our bank account without

2279
01:05:03,369 --> 01:05:05,590
fees don't pay them after fees pay

2280
01:05:05,710 --> 01:05:07,599
them the full amount to take on

2281
01:05:07,599 --> 01:05:07,760
the fees

2282
01:05:08,130 --> 01:05:13,260
so you said you uh listen to the

2283
01:05:13,260 --> 01:05:15,519
calls initially a lot and then

2284
01:05:15,519 --> 01:05:17,130
once they're in the zone you kind

2285
01:05:17,210 --> 01:05:17,840
of just do it

2286
01:05:17,969 --> 01:05:19,550
incrementally so that they think

2287
01:05:19,550 --> 01:05:21,210
that they can check in time do you

2288
01:05:21,210 --> 01:05:23,119
if somebody's doing well would you

2289
01:05:23,250 --> 01:05:25,469
still give their uh yeah yeah so

2290
01:05:25,559 --> 01:05:27,539
like and it doesn't just have to

2291
01:05:27,539 --> 01:05:29,449
come from you right so like this

2292
01:05:29,519 --> 01:05:29,760
week

2293
01:05:30,210 --> 01:05:31,880
the theme and uh our onboarding

2294
01:05:31,880 --> 01:05:33,679
specialist team was called reviews

2295
01:05:34,050 --> 01:05:35,119
i didn't do a single call

2296
01:05:35,250 --> 01:05:36,800
review and i i should have because

2297
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:38,550
again model the behavior to expect

2298
01:05:38,550 --> 01:05:40,400
but the point i'm trying to

2299
01:05:40,610 --> 01:05:41,909
make is the entire team was doing

2300
01:05:41,909 --> 01:05:43,449
call reviews so we had four

2301
01:05:43,449 --> 01:05:45,760
onboarding specialists i told them

2302
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:45,769
all

2303
01:05:46,050 --> 01:05:47,469
the week we needed send three of

2304
01:05:47,530 --> 01:05:48,980
your recent calls that you're

2305
01:05:48,980 --> 01:05:50,639
really proud of and then you think

2306
01:05:50,639 --> 01:05:51,199
the other

2307
01:05:51,329 --> 01:05:52,860
guys on the team to learn from and

2308
01:05:52,860 --> 01:05:54,659
then everyone else would review at

2309
01:05:54,659 --> 01:05:57,199
least two other calls and so

2310
01:05:57,329 --> 01:05:58,670
they're doing that so all week in

2311
01:05:58,670 --> 01:06:00,280
slide they're getting messages and

2312
01:06:00,300 --> 01:06:01,909
threads and things about feedback

2313
01:06:02,050 --> 01:06:03,699
from the calls and the team is

2314
01:06:03,699 --> 01:06:05,559
hyping each other up at this point

2315
01:06:05,949 --> 01:06:08,000
which is feeding into the culture

2316
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:10,739
so it could be a peer review not

2317
01:06:10,739 --> 01:06:12,469
necessarily it doesn't always have

2318
01:06:12,469 --> 01:06:13,119
to be from you

2319
01:06:13,969 --> 01:06:15,280
right because it could also serve

2320
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:17,170
as training for someone else and

2321
01:06:17,170 --> 01:06:21,119
again part of the call review

2322
01:06:21,250 --> 01:06:22,690
process is to show them that

2323
01:06:22,719 --> 01:06:24,719
you're watching right because they

2324
01:06:25,050 --> 01:06:26,800
talk about character character is

2325
01:06:26,840 --> 01:06:26,880
what

2326
01:06:27,010 --> 01:06:28,679
you do when no one's watching not

2327
01:06:28,679 --> 01:06:30,360
everyone has you know the best

2328
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:32,000
character and so what are they

2329
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:32,159
doing

2330
01:06:32,340 --> 01:06:33,550
if you're not watching and we're

2331
01:06:33,639 --> 01:06:34,880
doing certain things are they

2332
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:36,320
slacking off right like you're

2333
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:37,280
telling me

2334
01:06:37,409 --> 01:06:38,829
not to expose you but like your

2335
01:06:38,849 --> 01:06:40,480
work mentality is like are they

2336
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:42,320
reviewing how many hours you're

2337
01:06:42,320 --> 01:06:42,570
logging

2338
01:06:42,849 --> 01:06:44,750
and all this sort of stuff like

2339
01:06:44,750 --> 01:06:46,320
probably we've got a lot more

2340
01:06:46,719 --> 01:06:49,360
value if they did right so

2341
01:06:49,489 --> 01:06:51,820
same thing that's like what enough

2342
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:52,079
to do

2343
01:06:52,210 --> 01:06:56,320
i probably do get this a lot going

2344
01:06:56,320 --> 01:06:59,550
when you know is that in the right

2345
01:06:59,550 --> 01:07:00,239
time to hire someone

2346
01:07:00,369 --> 01:07:02,699
when um

2347
01:07:02,929 --> 01:07:08,539
i think the right time to hire

2348
01:07:08,539 --> 01:07:10,940
someone is when you can't scale

2349
01:07:10,940 --> 01:07:11,679
any further

2350
01:07:12,769 --> 01:07:14,179
number one like when you have the

2351
01:07:14,179 --> 01:07:15,599
fear of like oh i should i pick on

2352
01:07:15,599 --> 01:07:16,800
another client at this point

2353
01:07:16,869 --> 01:07:18,760
i don't have capacity for this or

2354
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:21,929
when you're doing the role to a

2355
01:07:21,929 --> 01:07:24,719
lesser quality than the client

2356
01:07:24,760 --> 01:07:24,880
would

2357
01:07:25,010 --> 01:07:26,400
expect simply because you're time

2358
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:28,480
restricted so like if you're doing

2359
01:07:28,900 --> 01:07:31,000
fulfillment you're doing the media

2360
01:07:31,170 --> 01:07:32,449
buying and at this point you're

2361
01:07:32,449 --> 01:07:33,900
just doing it for so many clients

2362
01:07:33,980 --> 01:07:35,280
you can't like in your head to

2363
01:07:35,409 --> 01:07:36,380
process all the different

2364
01:07:36,380 --> 01:07:37,630
strategies that you can go into

2365
01:07:37,719 --> 01:07:38,920
plus all the other stresses that

2366
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:39,599
come behind your

2367
01:07:39,730 --> 01:07:41,019
business so that when you show up

2368
01:07:41,019 --> 01:07:42,449
and do your app creative it's half

2369
01:07:42,539 --> 01:07:43,760
you know it's half after

2370
01:07:43,869 --> 01:07:45,190
it's just not standard you can

2371
01:07:45,190 --> 01:07:46,960
expect that's when you need to

2372
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:48,250
hire it's when the quality of work

2373
01:07:48,449 --> 01:07:50,500
finishes because of the time for

2374
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:52,239
the sprint that's a big part of it

2375
01:07:52,369 --> 01:07:56,710
i don't know a quick question uh

2376
01:07:56,869 --> 01:07:58,000
do you ever feel like you're not

2377
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:58,880
firing people enough

2378
01:07:59,969 --> 01:08:01,559
oh yeah all the time yeah all the

2379
01:08:01,559 --> 01:08:02,989
time how do you is there like a

2380
01:08:02,989 --> 01:08:04,309
way to think about that one

2381
01:08:04,389 --> 01:08:04,639
because i

2382
01:08:04,769 --> 01:08:06,650
kind of i did fire people enough

2383
01:08:06,650 --> 01:08:08,880
really i'm not doing it more often

2384
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:09,960
but still if i don't fire somebody

2385
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:11,590
for long enough

2386
01:08:13,750 --> 01:08:15,480
i kind of get like this feeling

2387
01:08:15,559 --> 01:08:17,279
about a whole few people in that

2388
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:18,399
place because there has to be like

2389
01:08:18,529 --> 01:08:19,630
financial or how to tell for a

2390
01:08:19,630 --> 01:08:20,869
number it has to be a lot of what

2391
01:08:20,970 --> 01:08:22,220
we're doing so you're like

2392
01:08:22,369 --> 01:08:24,000
probably requiring somebody or

2393
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,680
like i don't even think about it

2394
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:28,479
so well i mean i guess it depends

2395
01:08:28,609 --> 01:08:30,770
it's different on the css side we

2396
01:08:30,770 --> 01:08:32,250
hire so rarely yeah on the

2397
01:08:32,510 --> 01:08:33,760
customer success side because of

2398
01:08:33,760 --> 01:08:34,239
this budget

2399
01:08:34,369 --> 01:08:36,590
constraints um and also we usually

2400
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:38,689
need more people than we don't

2401
01:08:38,689 --> 01:08:40,880
yeah like we have the issue with

2402
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:41,300
not having

2403
01:08:41,489 --> 01:08:42,880
enough calendar availability for

2404
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:44,220
an onboarding call so yeah like

2405
01:08:44,229 --> 01:08:46,130
there's other performers that i

2406
01:08:46,369 --> 01:08:47,850
wanted to fire during that time

2407
01:08:47,890 --> 01:08:49,380
but couldn't simply because

2408
01:08:49,380 --> 01:08:51,279
capacity issues which is a hiring

2409
01:08:51,279 --> 01:08:51,520
problem

2410
01:08:52,050 --> 01:08:53,970
so the way you solve that problem

2411
01:08:53,970 --> 01:08:56,079
is you just go back to the certain

2412
01:08:56,079 --> 01:08:57,210
presentation you do the process

2413
01:08:57,630 --> 01:08:57,680
over

2414
01:08:57,810 --> 01:08:59,850
you you're usually not firing

2415
01:08:59,850 --> 01:09:02,020
someone because the limiting

2416
01:09:02,020 --> 01:09:04,319
belief or like the belief that you

2417
01:09:04,590 --> 01:09:05,310
can't go and

2418
01:09:05,489 --> 01:09:07,710
find another person to replace it

2419
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:09,829
yeah so like go find more talent

2420
01:09:09,949 --> 01:09:12,000
you that's the best way to do it

2421
01:09:12,090 --> 01:09:13,149
it's like you have someone you

2422
01:09:13,220 --> 01:09:14,350
really want to hire but you can't

2423
01:09:14,439 --> 01:09:16,239
because it's a role during build

2424
01:09:16,369 --> 01:09:17,750
you're going to go and find out

2425
01:09:17,750 --> 01:09:19,210
who fired as soon as possible

2426
01:09:19,210 --> 01:09:20,960
because you want to make room for

2427
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:21,119
that

2428
01:09:21,250 --> 01:09:23,319
next person so better hire your

2429
01:09:23,329 --> 01:09:27,760
funnel fire more often but i still

2430
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:30,960
think you need to pit and you also

2431
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:31,359
need to

2432
01:09:31,489 --> 01:09:33,430
get you need to give them a chance

2433
01:09:33,430 --> 01:09:35,489
to potentially be in a different

2434
01:09:35,489 --> 01:09:37,479
role so like for example we just

2435
01:09:37,649 --> 01:09:39,130
hired someone like three months

2436
01:09:39,170 --> 01:09:40,590
ago i listed it like a customer

2437
01:09:40,619 --> 01:09:42,319
support person and i thought she

2438
01:09:42,319 --> 01:09:42,319
was

2439
01:09:42,449 --> 01:09:44,619
doing great she's awful uh and so

2440
01:09:44,619 --> 01:09:46,470
i got on a call to to fire her

2441
01:09:46,470 --> 01:09:48,399
because it was like at the point

2442
01:09:48,399 --> 01:09:48,560
where

2443
01:09:48,689 --> 01:09:50,810
she was and still in a curve um

2444
01:09:50,810 --> 01:09:53,300
and she just brought up the point

2445
01:09:53,590 --> 01:09:55,199
like she she feels like she can

2446
01:09:55,350 --> 01:09:55,600
still

2447
01:09:55,729 --> 01:09:56,760
have value but in a completely

2448
01:09:56,819 --> 01:09:58,060
different role and she explained

2449
01:09:58,170 --> 01:09:59,420
really logically why she didn't

2450
01:09:59,630 --> 01:10:00,069
perform

2451
01:10:00,289 --> 01:10:01,399
because she doesn't get well

2452
01:10:01,399 --> 01:10:02,630
stressed she doesn't do well

2453
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:04,239
thinking on her feet but she would

2454
01:10:04,239 --> 01:10:04,630
be really

2455
01:10:04,770 --> 01:10:06,600
good at organizing things and

2456
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:08,720
doing operations and so i it was

2457
01:10:08,720 --> 01:10:10,880
like a a light bulb moment like i

2458
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:11,119
wasn't

2459
01:10:11,250 --> 01:10:13,470
wrong to hire this person just in

2460
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:15,890
the wrong role and so i moved her

2461
01:10:16,149 --> 01:10:17,760
into uh an operations uh assistant

2462
01:10:18,130 --> 01:10:20,039
role or q able so this is elisa

2463
01:10:20,039 --> 01:10:22,270
who works with us at list kit and

2464
01:10:22,270 --> 01:10:24,640
so she's amazing she's like to me

2465
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:24,640
the

2466
01:10:24,930 --> 01:10:26,500
most valuable team member i have

2467
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:28,119
this has just been a week in this

2468
01:10:28,119 --> 01:10:29,840
new role and all she does is she

2469
01:10:29,850 --> 01:10:30,000
like

2470
01:10:30,130 --> 01:10:31,409
goes for all the meetings looks at

2471
01:10:31,409 --> 01:10:32,619
the notes looks at the action

2472
01:10:32,619 --> 01:10:34,000
items make sure the person that

2473
01:10:34,029 --> 01:10:34,159
got

2474
01:10:34,289 --> 01:10:35,420
assigned to that action item gets

2475
01:10:35,420 --> 01:10:36,619
followed up with throughout the

2476
01:10:36,619 --> 01:10:37,779
week to make sure that it got done

2477
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:38,239
and if it

2478
01:10:38,369 --> 01:10:39,779
doesn't get done she reaches up to

2479
01:10:39,779 --> 01:10:41,090
the person that they need help

2480
01:10:41,180 --> 01:10:42,640
from to get it done and so she's

2481
01:10:42,770 --> 01:10:44,439
just keeping things organized

2482
01:10:44,529 --> 01:10:46,260
across slack hubspot trello my

2483
01:10:46,630 --> 01:10:48,079
email she's essentially like an

2484
01:10:48,350 --> 01:10:48,399
executive

2485
01:10:48,529 --> 01:10:50,210
assistant and i just had her in

2486
01:10:50,279 --> 01:10:52,250
the wrong hole and so that's a big

2487
01:10:52,430 --> 01:10:53,119
part of it too

2488
01:10:53,250 --> 01:10:56,279
um i have a question relating to

2489
01:10:56,279 --> 01:10:59,380
like fire and morale so like uh as

2490
01:10:59,380 --> 01:11:00,739
you know there's something on

2491
01:11:00,930 --> 01:11:02,689
Thursday but i'm trying to give

2492
01:11:02,689 --> 01:11:04,439
another person on a hip that's

2493
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:06,090
like going to fire the next couple

2494
01:11:06,520 --> 01:11:07,119
weeks

2495
01:11:07,250 --> 01:11:08,649
back to back people there so i'm

2496
01:11:08,649 --> 01:11:10,189
curious how do you approach the

2497
01:11:10,189 --> 01:11:12,000
organization holistic things like

2498
01:11:12,069 --> 01:11:13,680
i can tell the pc team like hey

2499
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:15,640
this person's doing it for yeah so

2500
01:11:16,029 --> 01:11:19,279
this might help yeah sometimes

2501
01:11:19,409 --> 01:11:22,140
you really are asking too much

2502
01:11:22,220 --> 01:11:24,529
sometimes your performance as i

2503
01:11:24,529 --> 01:11:25,920
said are unrealists

2504
01:11:26,210 --> 01:11:28,189
and so you should ask your team

2505
01:11:28,189 --> 01:11:31,199
then like hey by the way i i i

2506
01:11:31,199 --> 01:11:32,640
fired this person for this reason

2507
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:33,119
and now i'm

2508
01:11:33,250 --> 01:11:35,050
not going to fire this person for

2509
01:11:35,050 --> 01:11:36,880
this reason help me out here guys

2510
01:11:37,130 --> 01:11:39,460
is five percent turn unrealistic

2511
01:11:39,649 --> 01:11:41,640
okay it is okay okay i understand

2512
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:43,680
let's move it to seven and a half

2513
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:46,159
percent and go from there and so

2514
01:11:46,310 --> 01:11:46,479
i've

2515
01:11:46,609 --> 01:11:48,279
done that sometimes i'm like i'm

2516
01:11:48,279 --> 01:11:50,000
so anxious to get turned down so

2517
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:51,359
low that i set it to the point

2518
01:11:51,420 --> 01:11:51,600
where it's

2519
01:11:51,729 --> 01:11:53,399
number of those and that has a

2520
01:11:53,479 --> 01:11:55,199
negative effect because now

2521
01:11:55,590 --> 01:11:57,430
they're like honey can you try at

2522
01:11:57,510 --> 01:11:57,600
this

2523
01:11:57,729 --> 01:11:59,289
point because there's no chance to

2524
01:11:59,289 --> 01:12:00,640
get it yeah all right so that

2525
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:02,550
could be a part of the problem too

2526
01:12:02,689 --> 01:12:04,109
like check yourself in any event

2527
01:12:04,170 --> 01:12:05,409
that it is realistic and what

2528
01:12:05,500 --> 01:12:07,840
those people needed fired then how

2529
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:08,000
do you

2530
01:12:08,130 --> 01:12:09,789
communicate that organization

2531
01:12:09,789 --> 01:12:11,199
around you still have that

2532
01:12:11,250 --> 01:12:12,949
conversation so that they can see

2533
01:12:13,039 --> 01:12:13,359
that you're not

2534
01:12:14,689 --> 01:12:16,170
unreasonable person yeah right

2535
01:12:16,210 --> 01:12:17,689
you're inviting them into the

2536
01:12:17,689 --> 01:12:19,350
conversation like you're basically

2537
01:12:19,489 --> 01:12:21,260
telling them to tell you why

2538
01:12:21,260 --> 01:12:23,000
you're not wrong to fire that

2539
01:12:23,390 --> 01:12:25,439
person rather than you explaining

2540
01:12:25,439 --> 01:12:25,840
to it

2541
01:12:25,970 --> 01:12:27,449
explaining it to them on the call

2542
01:12:27,489 --> 01:12:29,020
you see what i mean like get them

2543
01:12:29,020 --> 01:12:30,560
involved in the conversation

2544
01:12:30,930 --> 01:12:32,869
okay and then it's like an open

2545
01:12:32,869 --> 01:12:34,409
dialogue yeah you need different

2546
01:12:34,829 --> 01:12:35,840
departments and everything

2547
01:12:35,970 --> 01:12:41,909
like when something happens on the

2548
01:12:41,909 --> 01:12:44,899
snail side yeah i don't tell my

2549
01:12:44,899 --> 01:12:46,960
team like i don't know if you do

2550
01:12:47,090 --> 01:12:48,760
that but no i think after i fire

2551
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:50,560
people if you bring it the right

2552
01:12:50,710 --> 01:12:52,250
way they kind of fire the main

2553
01:12:52,680 --> 01:12:53,090
guys

2554
01:12:53,239 --> 01:12:54,729
as long as we don't be strong like

2555
01:12:54,770 --> 01:12:56,399
yeah because we're always wrong

2556
01:12:56,399 --> 01:12:57,819
we're having this if you watch

2557
01:12:57,970 --> 01:12:59,640
that let's get it and just once

2558
01:12:59,729 --> 01:13:01,710
again we're here hey guys this is

2559
01:13:01,869 --> 01:13:02,960
what happened this is why i feel

2560
01:13:03,020 --> 01:13:04,569
a lot of you're working here but

2561
01:13:04,609 --> 01:13:06,289
you guys are all here we're not at

2562
01:13:06,289 --> 01:13:08,000
the top of a underperformance so

2563
01:13:08,130 --> 01:13:09,550
you guys all want to integrate and

2564
01:13:09,649 --> 01:13:10,720
put up 10 percent of this month

2565
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:13,279
and then you're like okay cool

2566
01:13:13,489 --> 01:13:14,670
like i'm hard to like improve

2567
01:13:14,760 --> 01:13:16,399
where like the standards i would

2568
01:13:16,399 --> 01:13:17,760
i'm still here so i'll keep you

2569
01:13:17,890 --> 01:13:19,300
that standard real time so you're

2570
01:13:19,300 --> 01:13:20,800
reassuring that if you're okay

2571
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:22,800
like it's not you just george's

2572
01:13:22,930 --> 01:13:24,340
lost my growing fire experience

2573
01:13:24,449 --> 01:13:26,000
like no the companies will be in

2574
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,479
the right direction you guys are

2575
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:28,630
still

2576
01:13:28,770 --> 01:13:33,529
there for a reason this is the

2577
01:13:33,529 --> 01:13:33,590
standard let's keep building okay

2578
01:13:33,590 --> 01:13:33,680
unless the company's done i mean

2579
01:13:33,810 --> 01:13:36,270
it's right you're growing right

2580
01:13:36,270 --> 01:13:38,159
yeah we're growing okay we can go

2581
01:13:38,229 --> 01:13:39,279
faster there you go

2582
01:13:43,409 --> 01:13:48,439
so if you fire them you'll fire

2583
01:13:48,439 --> 01:13:48,989
them no i get the whole team on a

2584
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:49,199
closet

2585
01:13:49,329 --> 01:13:53,670
yeah that'd be like why you stop

2586
01:13:53,970 --> 01:13:57,439
you've only done that once for

2587
01:13:57,869 --> 01:14:00,319
like a rep salesman you put the

2588
01:14:00,319 --> 01:14:01,359
you put the trump and

2589
01:14:01,489 --> 01:14:15,010
you put it on in too far yeah

2590
01:14:15,229 --> 01:14:18,119
right uh just in a minute so if

2591
01:14:18,119 --> 01:14:19,359
you fire them do you get them like

2592
01:14:19,489 --> 01:14:21,670
next week yeah yeah yeah yeah oh

2593
01:14:21,670 --> 01:14:22,920
it's good that's what you're

2594
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:25,119
renting too usually usually

2595
01:14:25,119 --> 01:14:29,310
because there's a lot of cleanups

2596
01:14:29,489 --> 01:14:32,409
yeah uh if they're terrible then

2597
01:14:32,409 --> 01:14:33,680
you can just try to just get them

2598
01:14:33,680 --> 01:14:36,000
off immediately if it's mutual but

2599
01:14:36,310 --> 01:14:38,449
i would always give 14 days and

2600
01:14:38,449 --> 01:14:40,529
usually go on 14 days even if

2601
01:14:40,529 --> 01:14:42,239
they're not good because you just

2602
01:14:42,239 --> 01:14:42,479
need

2603
01:14:42,609 --> 01:14:44,829
the extra body there temporarily

2604
01:14:44,920 --> 01:14:47,359
so it buys you 14 days to go find

2605
01:14:47,420 --> 01:14:49,840
a replacement even if they're not

2606
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:50,100
great

2607
01:14:50,289 --> 01:14:54,409
at least you guys don't have to

2608
01:14:54,409 --> 01:15:04,819
step back into the room so

2609
01:15:05,170 --> 01:15:07,229
if they're like excited about

2610
01:15:07,229 --> 01:15:11,680
what's going on yeah um

2611
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:11,920
not yet right not yet

2612
01:15:12,050 --> 01:15:14,130
yeah it's been like yeah three of

2613
01:15:14,130 --> 01:15:15,199
course correct yeah it's been

2614
01:15:15,199 --> 01:15:15,920
before five weeks

2615
01:15:16,050 --> 01:15:17,039
so kind of treats

2616
01:15:17,170 --> 01:15:22,739
just talk about the go after the

2617
01:15:22,760 --> 01:15:24,630
approach it's like okay we're

2618
01:15:24,630 --> 01:15:25,920
running this we're gone i'm new to

2619
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:25,920
this

2620
01:15:26,050 --> 01:15:27,880
like big boy grandparent right

2621
01:15:27,890 --> 01:15:29,909
because this is someone that you

2622
01:15:29,949 --> 01:15:30,800
build but i've been up trust

2623
01:15:30,930 --> 01:15:33,130
at this point like look i've been

2624
01:15:33,130 --> 01:15:34,310
running the show one-handed show

2625
01:15:34,310 --> 01:15:35,270
i've not really hired a lot of

2626
01:15:35,300 --> 01:15:35,920
people yet but

2627
01:15:36,010 --> 01:15:37,079
we just now have a realization

2628
01:15:37,140 --> 01:15:38,270
that this is something we can

2629
01:15:38,359 --> 01:15:39,840
really learn from people right the

2630
01:15:39,949 --> 01:15:40,000
people

2631
01:15:40,130 --> 01:15:41,489
around me really smart people that

2632
01:15:41,489 --> 01:15:43,359
i get consulted with training from

2633
01:15:43,359 --> 01:15:44,789
are telling me that this thing has

2634
01:15:45,439 --> 01:15:46,420
huge potential so we've got to

2635
01:15:46,420 --> 01:15:48,029
really walk in because i don't

2636
01:15:48,029 --> 01:15:49,600
want to miss out and it's one

2637
01:15:49,729 --> 01:15:51,100
time opportunity and so that means

2638
01:15:51,100 --> 01:15:52,380
things are going to be around a

2639
01:15:52,380 --> 01:15:53,920
lot a little different here north

2640
01:15:54,050 --> 01:15:55,359
forward right we can still have

2641
01:15:55,359 --> 01:15:56,729
our phone we can still you know

2642
01:15:56,729 --> 01:15:58,079
have this culture but let's

2643
01:15:58,079 --> 01:15:58,079
identify hey guys the things that

2644
01:15:58,079 --> 01:15:58,079
we're going to come to and make

2645
01:15:58,079 --> 01:16:03,909
sure we get done and so now you're

2646
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:03,920
you've just created an opportunity

2647
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:03,920
in a window where you're going to

2648
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:07,270
slightly change behavior

2649
01:16:07,279 --> 01:16:07,279
with an actor where you support i

2650
01:16:07,279 --> 01:16:07,279
mean that sounds like actually

2651
01:16:07,279 --> 01:16:13,520
what happens like at the beginning

2652
01:16:13,649 --> 01:16:14,939
you're not running it the other

2653
01:16:14,939 --> 01:16:16,560
thing now you're like oh shit like

2654
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:18,239
i gotta i gotta strap in and take

2655
01:16:18,369 --> 01:16:20,159
this thing way more serious

2656
01:16:20,159 --> 01:16:22,310
explain it that way to them and i

2657
01:16:22,310 --> 01:16:24,569
think from there you can slowly

2658
01:16:24,670 --> 01:16:24,880
change

2659
01:16:25,010 --> 01:16:26,579
your behavior a little bit and the

2660
01:16:26,579 --> 01:16:28,270
way you think about changing your

2661
01:16:28,270 --> 01:16:29,670
behaviors if you see something

2662
01:16:29,810 --> 01:16:31,289
that they did that you don't like

2663
01:16:31,329 --> 01:16:32,819
that you might have called out

2664
01:16:32,819 --> 01:16:34,270
before but you just didn't

2665
01:16:34,449 --> 01:16:35,869
like do it this time or if they

2666
01:16:35,930 --> 01:16:37,600
say something on a meeting that

2667
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:38,939
you like laugh at but you're

2668
01:16:39,090 --> 01:16:41,609
thinking you're in my life like

2669
01:16:41,609 --> 01:16:44,069
say that right so when you get

2670
01:16:44,069 --> 01:16:46,880
those feelings of like i want to

2671
01:16:46,939 --> 01:16:47,119
say

2672
01:16:47,250 --> 01:16:48,859
something what i'm not saying

2673
01:16:48,859 --> 01:16:50,720
that's all that and it's not even

2674
01:16:50,720 --> 01:16:52,239
we talked about this in my

2675
01:16:52,239 --> 01:16:52,399
relationship

2676
01:16:52,930 --> 01:16:54,100
around too right that's how you

2677
01:16:54,100 --> 01:16:55,649
should show them your relationship

2678
01:16:57,810 --> 01:17:10,399
so anyone else i do um um

2679
01:17:16,529 --> 01:17:33,300
okay so real line overall and just

2680
01:17:33,470 --> 01:17:34,920
be a specific part of the one on

2681
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:36,960
the shoe back and then assign the

2682
01:17:37,090 --> 01:17:38,729
other part of someone else well

2683
01:17:38,729 --> 01:17:40,579
you can't just bring them on

2684
01:17:40,989 --> 01:17:42,239
overlap and that would just help

2685
01:17:42,239 --> 01:17:42,399
you to

2686
01:17:42,520 --> 01:17:43,500
see how you're performing so you

2687
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:44,659
gotta go to the existing person to

2688
01:17:44,659 --> 01:17:45,989
say where you're ever performing

2689
01:17:46,529 --> 01:17:48,319
why you think they're performing

2690
01:17:48,319 --> 01:17:49,550
or you guess there's a possibility

2691
01:17:49,590 --> 01:17:50,560
to open up the door for

2692
01:17:50,680 --> 01:17:51,720
the other person behind and you

2693
01:17:51,779 --> 01:17:53,199
know what you just set up right

2694
01:17:53,199 --> 01:17:55,039
here yeah so what's that where the

2695
01:17:55,170 --> 01:17:57,289
main role is and then i saw that

2696
01:17:57,289 --> 01:17:59,510
okay she also has time to like

2697
01:17:59,739 --> 01:18:01,920
make it higher because she's been

2698
01:18:02,050 --> 01:18:12,600
being involved yeah or just i mean

2699
01:18:12,739 --> 01:18:14,750
try to approach her career have

2700
01:18:14,750 --> 01:18:16,239
you tried to push her career have

2701
01:18:16,239 --> 01:18:16,399
you

2702
01:18:16,529 --> 01:18:18,859
told her that the quality checks

2703
01:18:18,970 --> 01:18:20,489
aren't good yeah okay you can try

2704
01:18:20,489 --> 01:18:21,760
to approach her career like what

2705
01:18:21,909 --> 01:18:22,479
to look for

2706
01:18:22,609 --> 01:18:29,979
okay so go based off of that just

2707
01:18:29,979 --> 01:18:31,960
have to read that again like i had

2708
01:18:32,100 --> 01:18:33,659
someone in the wrong role

2709
01:18:33,810 --> 01:18:35,439
and she was just not happy with

2710
01:18:35,439 --> 01:18:37,380
the specific responsibility she

2711
01:18:37,399 --> 01:18:38,149
was doing that and just

2712
01:18:38,449 --> 01:18:40,119
re-focused her to nothing else

2713
01:18:40,199 --> 01:18:42,140
that's okay too but maybe like the

2714
01:18:42,350 --> 01:18:43,270
quality checks is something that

2715
01:18:43,359 --> 01:18:43,439
you

2716
01:18:43,569 --> 01:18:53,520
you can't i try to limit them i'm

2717
01:18:53,729 --> 01:18:54,960
not going to pay a show for the

2718
01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:58,100
project you can you can i don't

2719
01:18:58,390 --> 01:18:59,439
like to

2720
01:18:59,569 --> 01:19:05,489
because that sets the standard

2721
01:19:05,489 --> 01:19:11,270
like again if you go back through

2722
01:19:11,890 --> 01:19:17,199
the presentation like what is an a

2723
01:19:17,329 --> 01:19:19,659
player right an a player how can

2724
01:19:19,770 --> 01:19:22,420
we identify them they exceed cave

2725
01:19:22,420 --> 01:19:24,829
guys they take initiative beyond

2726
01:19:25,149 --> 01:19:25,199
the

2727
01:19:25,329 --> 01:19:27,250
specific responsibility right so

2728
01:19:27,250 --> 01:19:29,130
if it's a player they're happy to

2729
01:19:29,229 --> 01:19:30,880
do as long as it doesn't become

2730
01:19:31,010 --> 01:19:33,329
like the standard without some

2731
01:19:33,329 --> 01:19:36,000
formal conversation around look

2732
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,079
the role is different than what

2733
01:19:38,079 --> 01:19:38,159
you

2734
01:19:38,289 --> 01:19:39,420
originally signed up for and

2735
01:19:39,420 --> 01:19:40,609
therefore pay is going to be

2736
01:19:40,609 --> 01:19:42,159
different right usually they'll

2737
01:19:42,189 --> 01:19:43,010
get a quick

2738
01:19:43,250 --> 01:19:44,890
project that fits into their skill

2739
01:19:44,890 --> 01:19:46,590
setting and help the overall team

2740
01:19:46,590 --> 01:19:48,159
or help them or help you or help

2741
01:19:48,289 --> 01:19:49,960
the company they'll happily take

2742
01:19:50,039 --> 01:19:51,689
it on and run with it and you can

2743
01:19:51,689 --> 01:19:53,989
decide to notice them or you can

2744
01:19:54,069 --> 01:19:54,159
just

2745
01:19:54,289 --> 01:19:55,630
point to how it gives them a

2746
01:19:55,630 --> 01:19:57,550
better chance in the performance

2747
01:19:57,560 --> 01:19:59,840
and he's happy to do it and i

2748
01:19:59,970 --> 01:20:04,920
actually i think people were still

2749
01:20:04,930 --> 01:20:05,229
going to want to give them that

2750
01:20:05,229 --> 01:20:05,520
and that was my fear like i don't

2751
01:20:05,649 --> 01:20:06,829
want to have to be the president

2752
01:20:06,920 --> 01:20:08,180
or whatever you can ask him to do

2753
01:20:08,180 --> 01:20:09,520
this why do you do that because

2754
01:20:09,649 --> 01:20:12,720
you want to be like maybe that's

2755
01:20:12,720 --> 01:20:14,470
like three month project three

2756
01:20:14,550 --> 01:20:16,960
times probably yeah five percent

2757
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:17,520
but

2758
01:20:17,649 --> 01:20:19,220
even just saying that without you

2759
01:20:19,220 --> 01:20:20,850
know thinking about it and going

2760
01:20:20,850 --> 01:20:22,640
through a problem i've done this

2761
01:20:22,770 --> 01:20:23,789
before and i'm like i don't you

2762
01:20:23,789 --> 01:20:24,960
know i want to be like oh that's

2763
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:28,979
awesome right but that that's kind

2764
01:20:29,069 --> 01:20:29,119
of

2765
01:20:29,250 --> 01:20:30,890
worth the fact and it's not saying

2766
01:20:30,890 --> 01:20:32,520
you can't pay that for it if it's

2767
01:20:32,539 --> 01:20:33,920
a size of a project that's going

2768
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:34,000
to

2769
01:20:34,130 --> 01:20:36,180
take them away from their core

2770
01:20:36,180 --> 01:20:38,470
responsibility sure uh but yeah

2771
01:20:38,520 --> 01:20:40,640
don't just assume you have to pay

2772
01:20:40,789 --> 01:20:40,960
for

2773
01:20:41,090 --> 01:20:42,270
any additional things you ask them

2774
01:20:42,359 --> 01:20:43,609
to do because again a player to do

2775
01:20:43,609 --> 01:20:46,250
things beyond the scope

2776
01:20:46,770 --> 01:20:48,689
go ahead do you like allocate a

2777
01:20:48,689 --> 01:20:52,399
certain amount of margin to um

2778
01:20:52,399 --> 01:20:54,640
fulfillment and to continually

2779
01:20:54,640 --> 01:20:55,199
yeah

2780
01:20:55,329 --> 01:20:56,899
um but that kind of also changes

2781
01:20:56,899 --> 01:20:58,800
the scale you're going to pay more

2782
01:20:59,229 --> 01:21:01,439
now then you will look later but

2783
01:21:01,560 --> 01:21:02,989
if you don't pay more now you'll

2784
01:21:03,010 --> 01:21:04,710
never get till later right so like

2785
01:21:04,710 --> 01:21:06,159
you almost have to pay like

2786
01:21:06,289 --> 01:21:08,770
an initiation degree like you have

2787
01:21:08,770 --> 01:21:10,630
to pay for a team that's more

2788
01:21:10,859 --> 01:21:12,800
expensive than how much revenue

2789
01:21:12,930 --> 01:21:15,250
you're currently building or

2790
01:21:15,250 --> 01:21:17,869
building for um to get to the next

2791
01:21:17,869 --> 01:21:19,840
revenue tier so there will be

2792
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:20,430
times

2793
01:21:20,609 --> 01:21:21,789
when you go on a harness where you

2794
01:21:21,880 --> 01:21:23,279
bring people in where your margins

2795
01:21:23,279 --> 01:21:26,810
don't look that good but it's not

2796
01:21:27,010 --> 01:21:28,430
variable to as you're ready to

2797
01:21:28,479 --> 01:21:30,279
grow those costs that will fall in

2798
01:21:30,279 --> 01:21:30,880
73.

2799
01:21:30,909 --> 01:21:32,470
they're what allows for the

2800
01:21:32,600 --> 01:21:32,880
increase

2801
