1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:00,760
Hey there, guys.

2
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:01,459
My name's Andy.

3
00:00:01,459 --> 00:00:02,879
I'm the head of client success

4
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:04,019
inside of Client Ascension.

5
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,790
Today, I'm going to go over how to

6
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:07,240
hire your customer success

7
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:07,980
manager.

8
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:08,939
If this is the first time you're

9
00:00:08,939 --> 00:00:10,009
ever going to do it, this is going

10
00:00:10,009 --> 00:00:10,960
to be a comprehensive guide

11
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:12,750
and more of a strategic kind of

12
00:00:12,759 --> 00:00:14,640
framework of basically how to do

13
00:00:14,679 --> 00:00:16,429
it properly and how to do it most

14
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:16,980
effectively.

15
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:18,879
If you are on the path of now

16
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:21,140
making your first hire or maybe

17
00:00:21,269 --> 00:00:23,219
your additional hire to your

18
00:00:23,219 --> 00:00:24,399
client success team,

19
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:26,530
you're probably making the biggest

20
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:28,440
step towards making the most ROI

21
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,969
you possibly can out of any

22
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:30,500
employee

23
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:32,479
that you can possibly imagine.

24
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:36,289
CSMs are kind of like really the

25
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:38,579
core pillar in terms of your

26
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:39,799
fulfillment for your clients

27
00:00:39,979 --> 00:00:42,780
and bring in the highest amount of

28
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:44,399
ROI returns.

29
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,399
You're talking six figures a year,

30
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:48,840
potentially.

31
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,340
If you can hire properly, if you

32
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:53,679
actually follow this framework and

33
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:55,140
make the right steps.

34
00:00:55,219 --> 00:00:57,149
So, the data is clear.

35
00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:00,189
73% of CSMs' hires fail within the

36
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:02,219
first 18 months.

37
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,700
I actually see this more commonly

38
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,060
across a lot of businesses.

39
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:07,280
I see a lot of guys hire customer

40
00:01:07,349 --> 00:01:09,120
success managers in most

41
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:10,170
businesses

42
00:01:10,349 --> 00:01:12,040
and they don't actually hire a

43
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,939
customer success manager.

44
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,620
They end up hiring basically an

45
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:17,540
overpaid customer support rep.

46
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,349
There's a big difference between

47
00:01:20,349 --> 00:01:22,299
having someone to just remove

48
00:01:22,329 --> 00:01:24,450
yourself from the client-facing

49
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:25,859
aspect in your business.

50
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:27,519
A lot of founders just want to get

51
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:29,209
away from the client-facing.

52
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:30,939
It's very time-consuming.

53
00:01:31,069 --> 00:01:32,849
But you cannot replace that with

54
00:01:32,849 --> 00:01:34,920
someone who is inadequate in terms

55
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:35,680
of skill set

56
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,939
and someone who is basically a

57
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:40,090
pretty face or a nice guy.

58
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,739
You need someone who's actually

59
00:01:41,739 --> 00:01:43,299
going to drive results for your

60
00:01:43,299 --> 00:01:43,959
clients.

61
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,159
So, it's a critical hire to make

62
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:49,109
and you need to understand the

63
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:50,989
principal reason of someone who

64
00:01:50,989 --> 00:01:52,480
lacks both client success

65
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,340
management experience

66
00:01:53,409 --> 00:01:54,780
or business acumen in your

67
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,319
industry or your niche or your

68
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:57,120
service.

69
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,109
You're just setting yourself up

70
00:02:00,109 --> 00:02:01,260
for absolute hell.

71
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,780
You're just going to have to

72
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:04,159
double train them on so many

73
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:05,359
different aspects.

74
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:06,400
You're going to have to train them

75
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,000
to be a good CSM.

76
00:02:07,069 --> 00:02:08,240
You're going to have to train them

77
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,319
then on your business and your

78
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:09,860
service.

79
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:12,430
That's just a nightmarish kind of

80
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:13,120
situation.

81
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:14,560
I really do not recommend it.

82
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:17,159
This is kind of like my experience

83
00:02:17,219 --> 00:02:18,879
across the board.

84
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:21,870
If you can find a CSM, this would

85
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,960
be ideal for your first hire is

86
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:26,120
someone who has client success

87
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,639
manager experience

88
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:29,300
and someone who has knowledge

89
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,990
experience in the space and the

90
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:32,729
service or the product that you

91
00:02:32,729 --> 00:02:33,340
serve.

92
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,939
That is an absolute winner.

93
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,139
That is what you're absolutely

94
00:02:37,189 --> 00:02:37,819
looking for.

95
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,219
Depending on your business, that

96
00:02:40,219 --> 00:02:41,979
could be quite tricky.

97
00:02:42,659 --> 00:02:43,879
So if you can get someone with

98
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:45,139
client success management

99
00:02:45,139 --> 00:02:46,400
experience, amazing.

100
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:47,879
They're going to be way more

101
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:49,689
effective in a much faster period

102
00:02:49,689 --> 00:02:50,120
of time

103
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,870
because it's much easier to have

104
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:53,310
the actual frameworks and

105
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:54,460
understanding of being a client

106
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:55,099
success manager

107
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,740
but then just having to learn the

108
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,020
business knowledge.

109
00:02:58,199 --> 00:03:00,240
However, if you're taking someone

110
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,180
who has just standard business

111
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:02,919
knowledge

112
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,460
but needs to learn the client

113
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:06,219
success management actual role

114
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:06,680
itself,

115
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:08,430
you're going to be in for a much

116
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:09,979
longer kind of period.

117
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,030
I wouldn't typically take someone

118
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,159
in that role

119
00:03:14,379 --> 00:03:16,370
unless they have a really solid

120
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,360
experience in the business

121
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,159
because then they're going to have

122
00:03:20,169 --> 00:03:21,360
a faster ramp-up period

123
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:23,939
but they would really need a good

124
00:03:23,949 --> 00:03:26,500
like year or two under their belt,

125
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,439
have done something in the role,

126
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:29,479
really understand your business

127
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:30,840
and that would be come down to the

128
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,169
vetting process like for that

129
00:03:32,169 --> 00:03:33,099
individual person

130
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:34,460
and I'll show you some kind of

131
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:35,840
frameworks of how you can do that

132
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:36,879
a little bit later on in this

133
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:37,159
video

134
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:38,800
but that's essentially what you

135
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:40,379
kind of want to establish here.

136
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:42,840
If you can nail these two here,

137
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,539
CSM experience and business

138
00:03:44,699 --> 00:03:45,280
knowledge,

139
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:46,370
you're in for a winner.

140
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:47,620
It'll be like two to four weeks

141
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:48,879
until they start really at the

142
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:49,729
ground running.

143
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,530
Yeah.

144
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:53,710
But yes, anyone with no prior

145
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:56,280
experience in either field, just

146
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,800
never hire them.

147
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,710
You will, yeah, you're going to be

148
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:02,300
a long, long period of time

149
00:04:02,379 --> 00:04:03,319
until you really get them up and

150
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:03,740
running.

151
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,150
It's going to be a really negative

152
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:06,719
ROI.

153
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:08,409
I'm not even talking about the

154
00:04:08,409 --> 00:04:10,270
investment in terms of training

155
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:10,780
them.

156
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:13,340
I'm talking like a client's

157
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:14,439
journey as well.

158
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:17,439
So there's a learning curve with

159
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:20,170
being a really good, airtight

160
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:21,680
client success manager.

161
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:22,939
It takes experience.

162
00:04:23,019 --> 00:04:24,360
It takes interpersonal skills.

163
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:26,389
It takes someone who actually can

164
00:04:26,389 --> 00:04:27,959
be quick on their feet.

165
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:29,699
They have good communication

166
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:30,339
skills.

167
00:04:30,629 --> 00:04:31,629
They have the ability to be

168
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:32,459
multitasked.

169
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:33,600
They have the ability to wear

170
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,050
multiple different hats across the

171
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:35,670
business.

172
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:38,050
Again, this is especially if you

173
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:39,480
service like multiple different

174
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:40,420
types of business types.

175
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,509
You know, it's not the same as

176
00:04:42,509 --> 00:04:43,939
like an account manager for

177
00:04:44,029 --> 00:04:45,329
e-commerce, right?

178
00:04:45,379 --> 00:04:47,089
I really want to get that clear.

179
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:48,319
Sometimes account manager and

180
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:49,500
client success manager can

181
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,420
sometimes fall into the same kind

182
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:51,920
of category.

183
00:04:52,019 --> 00:04:52,579
They're not.

184
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:54,410
Account manager is there to just

185
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:55,879
kind of manage like certain

186
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:57,920
accounts that are the same niche,

187
00:04:58,089 --> 00:04:59,779
same service, same business model.

188
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:01,279
Like it's very repeat and

189
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:02,079
re-rinse.

190
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,569
It's very heavy on fulfillment.

191
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:06,550
Account managers actually do a lot

192
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:08,300
of like done-for-you work.

193
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,519
Client success managers don't.

194
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:13,509
Client success managers are there

195
00:05:13,509 --> 00:05:15,610
to make sure that your actual

196
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:18,000
client is adopting to the product,

197
00:05:18,069 --> 00:05:18,980
to the service.

198
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,399
They're using it.

199
00:05:20,569 --> 00:05:22,000
They're making sure that they're

200
00:05:22,019 --> 00:05:23,269
getting an ROI out of it.

201
00:05:23,459 --> 00:05:25,189
That is the important difference

202
00:05:25,189 --> 00:05:25,779
there.

203
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:27,639
Just so you know.

204
00:05:27,819 --> 00:05:30,019
Again, with client success

205
00:05:30,019 --> 00:05:32,990
managers, having sales experience

206
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:34,740
is just invaluable.

207
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:36,860
If you don't have to train someone

208
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,490
in sales, you're in for an

209
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:39,819
absolute winner.

210
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:41,810
That's not always going to be the

211
00:05:41,829 --> 00:05:42,279
case.

212
00:05:42,459 --> 00:05:43,240
Getting people with sales

213
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,449
experience can be a bit tricky.

214
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,069
But I mean, even if it's something

215
00:05:46,089 --> 00:05:47,480
as simple as they cold called,

216
00:05:47,569 --> 00:05:48,860
they did door-to-door sales,

217
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,519
you know, even if they worked in

218
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:51,959
something even like retail or

219
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:52,649
something,

220
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:54,500
as long as they kind of understand

221
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,959
how to kind of like motivate

222
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:57,839
people to purchase a product,

223
00:05:58,019 --> 00:05:58,819
that's okay.

224
00:05:59,019 --> 00:06:00,660
But actual sales experience like

225
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,980
closing, setting, amazing.

226
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,000
If you can, you're on to a serious

227
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,120
winner because sales is actually a

228
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:08,879
massive part of client success

229
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:09,410
management.

230
00:06:10,689 --> 00:06:12,029
So your interview kind of

231
00:06:12,029 --> 00:06:15,439
framework here, you know, you kind

232
00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:17,660
of want to kind of go through this

233
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:18,759
in like pre-interview kind of

234
00:06:18,829 --> 00:06:19,519
requirements.

235
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,420
You ideally are looking for

236
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:22,360
someone with some sort of

237
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,709
experience, minimum of kind of two

238
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:24,199
years.

239
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:25,480
One year is going to be generally

240
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:25,879
fine.

241
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,189
Again, the business human can

242
00:06:27,189 --> 00:06:28,819
match up to that, but that's fine.

243
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:30,240
But any experience whatsoever is

244
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,709
going to be solid, especially if

245
00:06:31,709 --> 00:06:33,189
it's something in a similar agency

246
00:06:33,339 --> 00:06:34,420
model that is your own.

247
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,300
Whether that be an info product,

248
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,920
an e-commerce agency, a content

249
00:06:38,069 --> 00:06:39,800
agency, cold email agent agency,

250
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:41,509
whatever, funnels, whatever it

251
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:42,160
might be, right?

252
00:06:42,339 --> 00:06:44,160
But yes, and then you're also

253
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,319
going to want to like demonstrate

254
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,490
it like that they have some sort

255
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:50,160
of metrics of like client

256
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:52,160
retention or expansion.

257
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:53,500
That would be fantastic.

258
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:55,500
And then experience in not just

259
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,269
like SaaS platforms and CRM

260
00:06:57,269 --> 00:06:58,819
systems, but if they have some

261
00:06:58,819 --> 00:06:59,850
sort of tech background in

262
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:00,279
general,

263
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:01,310
that would be also really

264
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:02,439
important because there is a

265
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:03,670
little bit of tech involved when

266
00:07:03,769 --> 00:07:05,029
there is when it comes to customer

267
00:07:05,029 --> 00:07:06,100
success management.

268
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:08,100
And then, you know, communication

269
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,819
skills is really important.

270
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,120
Avoid these red flags, like people

271
00:07:13,269 --> 00:07:16,490
saying I have people skills, like

272
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:18,160
that's great.

273
00:07:18,339 --> 00:07:20,730
But what specifically, like client

274
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:23,209
success management is really about

275
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:25,550
the specifics of what your skills

276
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:27,060
really look like.

277
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:29,220
If they don't have any metrics, if

278
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,379
they don't have any outcomes, but

279
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:31,529
they're claiming they have client

280
00:07:31,569 --> 00:07:33,240
success management skills, they're

281
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:34,509
probably lying.

282
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,850
Customer service experience is not

283
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:38,470
the same as client success

284
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:40,220
management experience.

285
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:41,689
Someone who was a rep in the

286
00:07:41,689 --> 00:07:43,199
company is not the same.

287
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:45,860
So just nil void that.

288
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:49,839
And those sort of things as well.

289
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,949
So successful CSM candidates

290
00:07:51,949 --> 00:07:53,500
demonstrate a strong combination

291
00:07:53,629 --> 00:07:55,319
of technical ability, strategic

292
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:56,899
thinking, and client relationship

293
00:07:56,899 --> 00:07:57,759
management skills.

294
00:07:57,939 --> 00:07:59,199
That's kind of the core of the

295
00:07:59,199 --> 00:07:59,639
role.

296
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,180
And their application should

297
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,620
reflect some sort of specific

298
00:08:02,709 --> 00:08:04,290
accomplishment and metrics to

299
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:05,949
showcase their impact on client

300
00:08:05,949 --> 00:08:07,339
retention and growth.

301
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,959
And be aware of candidates who,

302
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:10,689
again, people, you know, people

303
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,779
pleasers, people, persons, people

304
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:13,459
skills.

305
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,550
It's like you could get yourself

306
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:16,860
kind of caught into a bit of a

307
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,550
weird situation with those kind of

308
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:19,189
folks.

309
00:08:19,269 --> 00:08:21,100
It's like because client success

310
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,050
management, you can't exactly be

311
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:24,920
like, oh, I'm your friend.

312
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,139
And you're trying to make, you

313
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:27,509
know, people pleas in this sort of

314
00:08:27,509 --> 00:08:27,899
role.

315
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:29,439
It doesn't work.

316
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:31,649
So here's like a 60-minute

317
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:32,889
interview kind of structure that I

318
00:08:32,918 --> 00:08:33,320
have.

319
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:34,399
You know, your first one to 15

320
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:35,440
minutes, you just kind of kind of

321
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,298
could do a business knowledge

322
00:08:36,379 --> 00:08:37,038
assessment.

323
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,179
You kind of want to evaluate their

324
00:08:38,179 --> 00:08:39,259
understanding of your business

325
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:40,320
model, your industry, your

326
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,889
challenges, the competitive

327
00:08:41,918 --> 00:08:42,759
landscape.

328
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,129
Strong candidates will have

329
00:08:44,129 --> 00:08:45,919
researched your companies early.

330
00:08:46,049 --> 00:08:47,399
That's how you really identify an

331
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:47,980
A player.

332
00:08:48,049 --> 00:08:49,840
An A player knows your business,

333
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,879
your competitors, your market.

334
00:08:52,029 --> 00:08:53,539
They've done their due diligence.

335
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,679
They've done their research.

336
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:56,220
Because an A player isn't going to

337
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,220
settle for no one.

338
00:08:58,279 --> 00:08:59,389
And if they're going to be an A

339
00:08:59,429 --> 00:09:00,820
player, they're going to come in

340
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:02,279
with all of their ducks in a row.

341
00:09:02,539 --> 00:09:03,909
Come very well prepared.

342
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:05,450
That is the strongest indication

343
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:06,899
that you're actually going to be

344
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:08,340
speaking to someone who is in it

345
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,710
for the long run and is looking

346
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:10,950
for somewhere where they can

347
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:11,679
really grow.

348
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:14,090
So first 15 minutes, you just want

349
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:15,740
to get some experience.

350
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,490
What do they know?

351
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:17,460
What do they not know?

352
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:19,149
What their experience is in the

353
00:09:19,149 --> 00:09:19,629
past?

354
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,259
Then you want to give them some

355
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:23,149
scenario-based problem-solving

356
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:23,799
skills.

357
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:25,409
It's like, you know, present

358
00:09:25,409 --> 00:09:27,139
real-world client situations and

359
00:09:27,289 --> 00:09:28,820
assess their problem-solving

360
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:29,259
approaches.

361
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,190
Because that is like 80% of the

362
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:32,700
job is problem-solving on a

363
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:33,879
constant basis.

364
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,759
And like, how do they communicate

365
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:36,720
that problem?

366
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:37,759
How do they strategize the

367
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:38,269
problem?

368
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:39,580
What's the kind of, how do they

369
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:40,779
balance the, you know, the

370
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,129
client's needs and the business

371
00:09:42,129 --> 00:09:42,639
needs?

372
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:43,559
You know?

373
00:09:44,299 --> 00:09:45,629
And then it's going to be like an

374
00:09:45,629 --> 00:09:46,820
experience deep dive.

375
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:49,120
Probe specific examples from their

376
00:09:49,129 --> 00:09:50,759
past work to demonstrate

377
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:51,820
competence.

378
00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:53,289
You know, you want to see like,

379
00:09:53,289 --> 00:09:54,419
how do they manage client

380
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,980
retention strategies, expansion

381
00:09:56,139 --> 00:09:57,379
techniques, and conflict

382
00:09:57,379 --> 00:09:58,210
resolution?

383
00:09:58,399 --> 00:09:59,519
These are all really important

384
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:00,620
aspects of client success

385
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:01,200
management.

386
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,450
And then finally, like the last

387
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:03,840
couple of minutes, that's when you

388
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,039
can just kind of evaluate.

389
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:06,649
Like, they're going to be a

390
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:07,419
culture fit.

391
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,590
Client success managers have to

392
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:11,289
blend in all areas of your

393
00:10:11,299 --> 00:10:12,259
business.

394
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,450
They're going to be talking to

395
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:14,320
your sales team.

396
00:10:14,379 --> 00:10:15,299
They're going to be talking to the

397
00:10:15,299 --> 00:10:16,000
fulfillment team.

398
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:16,779
They're going to be talking to

399
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:17,039
you.

400
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,080
They're going to be talking to a

401
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:18,860
lot of team members.

402
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:20,289
You have to make sure that they

403
00:10:20,289 --> 00:10:21,769
actually are a good fit for your

404
00:10:21,769 --> 00:10:22,799
business as well.

405
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,539
This isn't just like the web dev

406
00:10:24,539 --> 00:10:26,409
guy in the back who doesn't really

407
00:10:26,429 --> 00:10:26,960
talk.

408
00:10:27,269 --> 00:10:28,620
This is someone who's going to be

409
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,080
bouncing around, talking to a lot

410
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,840
of different people, being a part

411
00:10:31,899 --> 00:10:33,549
of a lot of different meetings.

412
00:10:33,769 --> 00:10:35,730
And oftentimes, like the client

413
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,769
success manager is a guy that has

414
00:10:37,769 --> 00:10:39,820
to play devil's advocate in this

415
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:40,620
situation.

416
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:42,750
Because they're the voice of the

417
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:43,500
client.

418
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:45,279
Like, no one knows the client's

419
00:10:45,299 --> 00:10:47,110
pulse of the business just as much

420
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,610
as the founder is the client

421
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:49,840
success manager.

422
00:10:50,019 --> 00:10:51,799
Like, they know what clients they

423
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:52,340
like.

424
00:10:52,409 --> 00:10:53,279
They know what they don't like.

425
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:54,830
They know what results are there

426
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,259
that clients want to meet.

427
00:10:57,179 --> 00:10:58,519
So, you know, you have to make

428
00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:00,000
sure that this is a person that,

429
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,519
like, fits into that team across

430
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:02,169
the board.

431
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,669
So, this is a structured approach

432
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:07,340
to gather some comparable data.

433
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,509
Here's some CSM questions that I

434
00:11:09,509 --> 00:11:11,610
usually typically use when I'm

435
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:13,250
interviewing a CSM.

436
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,370
And you really kind of want to,

437
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:17,649
like, really press them, if I'm

438
00:11:17,779 --> 00:11:20,279
being completely honest with you.

439
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:21,450
Like, tell me what you know about

440
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:22,139
your business.

441
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,200
This is always a big one.

442
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:24,210
It's a normal one for a lot of

443
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:25,370
different companies and things

444
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:25,980
like that.

445
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:27,879
You're looking for someone who's

446
00:11:27,889 --> 00:11:29,570
done specific research, not just

447
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:31,279
generic industry knowledge.

448
00:11:31,409 --> 00:11:33,409
You know, it's just like, again,

449
00:11:33,419 --> 00:11:34,179
red flag.

450
00:11:34,259 --> 00:11:35,399
Like, oh, I know you help scale

451
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:36,059
businesses.

452
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,659
Or I know you get leads for

453
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:38,519
clients.

454
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:40,330
Or, yeah, I know you help e-com

455
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:42,070
brands, like, you know, get

456
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:44,179
revenue from email marketing.

457
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,639
Or, yeah, I know you build funnels

458
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:47,399
and VSLs.

459
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,889
So, it's just like, Jesus, like,

460
00:11:49,889 --> 00:11:51,690
this is a person that needs to

461
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:53,600
really show, like, a lot of

462
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,929
curiosity and really know what

463
00:11:55,929 --> 00:11:56,830
they have.

464
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,100
If they can mention your service,

465
00:11:58,110 --> 00:11:59,320
your pricing, they've probably

466
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,210
funnel hacked you.

467
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,440
They've looked up your trust

468
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:02,840
pilots.

469
00:12:02,899 --> 00:12:03,970
They've looked up your case study

470
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:04,559
interviews.

471
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:05,889
That's what you're kind of looking

472
00:12:05,889 --> 00:12:06,220
for.

473
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,879
Who do you think our ideal client

474
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:09,580
profile is?

475
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:10,690
That's also a very strong one

476
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:11,940
because it shows that they've done

477
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:12,600
their research.

478
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,210
You know, what would challenge us

479
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:15,500
with this type of client face is

480
00:12:15,509 --> 00:12:16,820
another good follow-up question

481
00:12:16,899 --> 00:12:17,320
there.

482
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,490
Because then you can start having

483
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:19,639
a really engaging conversation

484
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:20,850
then about your business, about

485
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:22,220
the product, about the service.

486
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:23,840
And those questions can lead to

487
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:25,120
even more questions that you can

488
00:12:25,159 --> 00:12:26,409
prop them about a little bit more

489
00:12:26,409 --> 00:12:27,730
and really see, like, what's the

490
00:12:27,769 --> 00:12:29,049
scope of their knowledge for the

491
00:12:29,049 --> 00:12:29,720
company?

492
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:31,629
And then it's like, have you ever

493
00:12:31,629 --> 00:12:33,370
used their products or similar

494
00:12:33,389 --> 00:12:33,820
ones?

495
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,460
Often cases, they might not, but

496
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:36,870
just in case they might have or,

497
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:38,450
like, what experience do they have

498
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:39,610
in that type of service and

499
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:40,370
industry?

500
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:42,610
That's also really helpful as

501
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:43,259
well.

502
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,580
Conflict resolution in difficult

503
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:47,850
situations, like, strong CSMs must

504
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,009
navigate complex client

505
00:12:49,009 --> 00:12:50,570
relationships while maintaining

506
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:51,870
the business interest.

507
00:12:52,659 --> 00:12:54,570
Like, this is the trickiest part

508
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:56,429
as well when it comes to being a

509
00:12:56,429 --> 00:12:56,840
CSM.

510
00:12:57,139 --> 00:13:00,429
Because you are going to, you have

511
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:03,690
to be loyal to the business at the

512
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:05,460
end of the day.

513
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:07,210
But because you are the person

514
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:09,029
that is working with the client

515
00:13:09,029 --> 00:13:11,250
relationship there, you are going

516
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:13,250
to oftentimes be in the gray.

517
00:13:13,429 --> 00:13:14,779
And it'll be you who is the

518
00:13:14,779 --> 00:13:16,960
person, that's the client success

519
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,049
manager, that is going to be

520
00:13:19,129 --> 00:13:21,350
working with the client on the

521
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:22,340
best thing.

522
00:13:22,419 --> 00:13:23,580
It's their behalf and working on

523
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:24,840
the business on the best of their

524
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:26,159
behalf and trying to make the best

525
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:27,409
of both worlds and trying to find

526
00:13:27,419 --> 00:13:28,490
a win-win situation for all

527
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:29,539
parties included.

528
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:32,000
So, pay attention as well to how

529
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,779
candidates describe their thought

530
00:13:34,779 --> 00:13:37,629
process, not just their outcome.

531
00:13:37,799 --> 00:13:38,980
The best CSMs have, like, a

532
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:40,480
systematic approach to conflict

533
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,899
that balances the relationship

534
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:43,370
reservation and the business's

535
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:44,179
objectives.

536
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,519
Again, this is why the role can be

537
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:47,519
really tricky.

538
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:49,690
CSMs often have to kind of walk a

539
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:52,360
tightrope, you know, and find this

540
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,549
kind of win-win for all parties

541
00:13:54,549 --> 00:13:55,610
included.

542
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,860
And that's where the sales skills

543
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,809
really come into play because they

544
00:13:59,809 --> 00:14:01,409
have that negotiation kind of

545
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:02,659
understanding.

546
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,149
And they're being able to spell

547
00:14:04,149 --> 00:14:05,759
out very clearly to the founder of

548
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:07,769
the company, to yourself, this is

549
00:14:07,809 --> 00:14:09,899
the ROI we're going to expect to

550
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:10,440
get.

551
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,110
And the client then goes, well, if

552
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:13,419
you scratch my back, I scratch

553
00:14:13,539 --> 00:14:14,080
yours.

554
00:14:14,259 --> 00:14:15,580
See what I mean?

555
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:17,889
So, these are good questions to

556
00:14:17,889 --> 00:14:19,360
also ask as well in your interview

557
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,100
process.

558
00:14:20,139 --> 00:14:21,029
A client is ignoring your

559
00:14:21,029 --> 00:14:22,269
instructions consistently.

560
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,519
Walk me through your approach.

561
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:24,929
You know, you're looking for

562
00:14:24,929 --> 00:14:26,450
someone who's going to actually

563
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:27,840
break down the patterns here.

564
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:29,389
Someone who's going to diagnose

565
00:14:29,389 --> 00:14:30,210
this situation.

566
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,110
You know, they're going to, like,

567
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:34,000
do root cause analysis, escalation

568
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,419
process, and relationship

569
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:36,500
preservation.

570
00:14:37,259 --> 00:14:38,789
A weak answer is just going to be,

571
00:14:38,809 --> 00:14:40,330
like, you know, oh, well, if

572
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:41,809
they're not listening to me and

573
00:14:41,809 --> 00:14:43,009
they don't want to take the

574
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:45,070
instructions, then what can I do?

575
00:14:45,179 --> 00:14:45,840
Like, you know what I mean?

576
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,250
Like, he's not going to listen to

577
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:48,379
me, so just let him go.

578
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:49,539
It's just, like, no.

579
00:14:49,659 --> 00:14:51,090
That's, like, the opposite of your

580
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:51,399
job.

581
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,669
Your job is to actually, like,

582
00:14:52,669 --> 00:14:53,960
make sure that they are adopting

583
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,039
to the product and using the

584
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,139
service to the best of their

585
00:14:56,139 --> 00:14:56,840
abilities.

586
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,649
Otherwise, you just are going to

587
00:14:58,659 --> 00:15:00,509
have churn in, like, two months,

588
00:15:00,519 --> 00:15:01,259
maybe less.

589
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,549
You know, how do you handle

590
00:15:02,549 --> 00:15:03,679
conflict with a client who

591
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:05,240
believes they're right but they're

592
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,360
objectively wrong?

593
00:15:06,899 --> 00:15:08,200
You know, and this is another

594
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,379
situation, you know?

595
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,929
It's, like, this could be a

596
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,980
situation of a client who's, like,

597
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,690
I'm asking for a refund but they

598
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:16,600
didn't hit all the stipulations

599
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,340
because maybe they didn't give all

600
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:19,950
the assets or maybe they didn't do

601
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:21,899
the onboarding call or, you know,

602
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:23,559
maybe they didn't, like, they were

603
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:25,450
just, like, radio silent for two

604
00:15:25,509 --> 00:15:26,470
weeks and it was, like, we

605
00:15:26,549 --> 00:15:27,419
couldn't get a hold of you.

606
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:28,570
We couldn't start any work.

607
00:15:28,659 --> 00:15:29,720
We couldn't get you to approve any

608
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,059
work.

609
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:31,710
We couldn't get, actually,

610
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:33,539
anything moving here because you

611
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:35,399
weren't part of the process, you

612
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:35,960
know?

613
00:15:36,539 --> 00:15:37,549
So, yeah, you're looking for

614
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:38,629
someone who can have, like, a

615
00:15:38,659 --> 00:15:39,759
diplomatic influence without

616
00:15:39,909 --> 00:15:41,259
damaging relationships and then

617
00:15:41,259 --> 00:15:42,909
being able to use actual data,

618
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:44,950
using the business's contract, the

619
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:47,000
understanding, the stipulations of

620
00:15:47,019 --> 00:15:48,750
the company and things like that

621
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,429
to kind of promote that and do it

622
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:51,679
in a very nice way.

623
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:54,590
It's often called nonviolent

624
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:56,980
communication, basically holding

625
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,129
someone accountable but without

626
00:15:59,139 --> 00:16:00,990
actually, like, causing a

627
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:03,049
confrontation and potentially

628
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:04,519
causing a problem.

629
00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:07,399
So, again, someone asks for a

630
00:16:07,419 --> 00:16:09,370
refund, you know, problem-solving

631
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:11,240
methodology, list and investigate

632
00:16:11,309 --> 00:16:12,580
options, resolution,

633
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:13,720
documentation.

634
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:15,340
Like, again, you're just looking

635
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:16,700
for someone who's looking to save

636
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,460
the situation here, someone who's

637
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:19,980
looking to try and help convince

638
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,740
the client that they need to stay,

639
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:23,559
not someone who just throws in the

640
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:24,559
towel and goes,

641
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:25,039
you want a refund?

642
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:25,580
No, no problem.

643
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:26,059
You want to quit?

644
00:16:26,059 --> 00:16:26,679
That's no problem.

645
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,840
Like, yeah, let's just go, we'll

646
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,399
just end this.

647
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:29,659
Okay, we'll off-board you now.

648
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:33,240
Like, if that, if your CSM ever

649
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:36,759
does that, fire them, like,

650
00:16:36,809 --> 00:16:38,879
immediately.

651
00:16:40,379 --> 00:16:41,950
There's either something gone

652
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:43,840
seriously wrong in your training

653
00:16:43,879 --> 00:16:45,519
and you haven't prepared them

654
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:47,460
enough for the situation or just,

655
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:50,320
like, you know, you need to dive

656
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:51,659
into that problem a lot deeper.

657
00:16:51,779 --> 00:16:53,259
But that is, like, the biggest red

658
00:16:53,259 --> 00:16:54,700
flag you can possibly imagine.

659
00:16:54,879 --> 00:16:56,110
No one should ever just be

660
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:57,730
throwing in the towel because a

661
00:16:57,730 --> 00:16:59,220
client throws a tantrum.

662
00:16:59,419 --> 00:17:01,409
Most oftentimes, clients just need

663
00:17:01,409 --> 00:17:02,059
to vent.

664
00:17:02,059 --> 00:17:03,100
You know what I mean?

665
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:04,650
They just need to get some anger

666
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:06,078
off their chest, you know?

667
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,539
So, great candidates, they'll

668
00:17:08,539 --> 00:17:10,170
show, demonstrate, like, the

669
00:17:10,269 --> 00:17:11,920
balance of empathy and boundary

670
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:12,609
setting.

671
00:17:12,818 --> 00:17:15,059
You know, they can't be walked on

672
00:17:15,059 --> 00:17:15,940
all over.

673
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,660
Like, it's never going to work if

674
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:19,220
you're just going to be getting

675
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,799
thrown through the grinder and

676
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:22,328
just kind of, you know, used as a

677
00:17:22,328 --> 00:17:23,920
human punching bag.

678
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,240
And again, they need to have

679
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,848
proper systematic approaches for

680
00:17:26,848 --> 00:17:28,519
difficult conversations that leads

681
00:17:28,519 --> 00:17:29,640
to resolution and protects the

682
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,680
business relationship.

683
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,200
Like, these people are speaking on

684
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,220
behalf of the brand.

685
00:17:33,299 --> 00:17:34,680
They are representing the company.

686
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,599
Bad CSMs are the reason why people

687
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:39,490
get bad trust pilot reviews.

688
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,539
Good CSMs are the reason why there

689
00:17:41,539 --> 00:17:43,920
are five-star trust pilot reviews.

690
00:17:44,119 --> 00:17:45,910
This is the reasoning why you need

691
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:47,730
to be very, very careful of who

692
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:49,339
you pick as a client success

693
00:17:49,339 --> 00:17:50,140
manager.

694
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:51,980
Like, you're looking for evidence

695
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,410
that they've successfully

696
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:55,250
navigated complex issues before in

697
00:17:55,289 --> 00:17:55,930
the past.

698
00:17:56,779 --> 00:17:57,869
If they don't have that

699
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,440
experience, you are taking a

700
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:00,970
massive, massive risk.

701
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:03,380
So, operational excellence as

702
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:04,640
well, you know, you've

703
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,440
accidentally overcharged a client

704
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,940
or if you've got the charge and

705
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:09,220
what's your response?

706
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,720
Integrity, problem solving, you

707
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,819
know, you're looking for

708
00:18:11,819 --> 00:18:13,279
transparency, correction plan,

709
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:14,920
process, you know, improvement and

710
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:15,869
things like that.

711
00:18:16,039 --> 00:18:17,019
Like, the CSM's not going to be

712
00:18:17,019 --> 00:18:18,099
like, oh, I made a mess up, but

713
00:18:18,099 --> 00:18:18,900
can you fix it for me?

714
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:20,170
It's going to be like, the CSM

715
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:21,200
should be on to the client

716
00:18:21,259 --> 00:18:22,730
straight away and saying, hey, I

717
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:23,950
have to make a mistake.

718
00:18:24,039 --> 00:18:25,319
Be very transparent with you.

719
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:25,940
I apologize.

720
00:18:26,109 --> 00:18:27,690
This is actually, I've overcharged

721
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:28,519
you for this.

722
00:18:28,599 --> 00:18:30,000
Or, hey, I forgot to send you your

723
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,200
billing for this month.

724
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:32,519
Could you please fix this for me

725
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:33,420
as soon as you can?

726
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:34,279
Could you do me a favor?

727
00:18:34,519 --> 00:18:36,559
You know, a client then asks to

728
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:37,690
switch CSMs.

729
00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:38,910
How would you reflect the

730
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:39,599
situation?

731
00:18:39,779 --> 00:18:41,039
Again, like, offer an exit

732
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:42,579
interview, get some feedback

733
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:44,450
analysis, like, do a relationship

734
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:45,160
handover.

735
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,329
Make it as sweet as possible for

736
00:18:46,369 --> 00:18:46,700
them.

737
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:49,000
If a CSM, if a client comes to the

738
00:18:49,009 --> 00:18:51,059
CSM and says, I want to switch

739
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:53,480
over, I want to go to a different

740
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:55,200
person because I don't feel like

741
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,700
you're doing me justice in terms

742
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,240
of actually getting an ROI out of

743
00:18:58,359 --> 00:18:58,990
the product.

744
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:00,390
They shouldn't be throwing a

745
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:01,819
tantrum and getting mad at the

746
00:19:01,819 --> 00:19:02,460
client.

747
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:04,420
They should be then realistically

748
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:06,089
be saying, okay, I'm really sorry

749
00:19:06,089 --> 00:19:07,119
I've let you down.

750
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,269
Is there any way, do you have any

751
00:19:08,269 --> 00:19:09,210
feedback for me of how I can

752
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:10,079
possibly improve?

753
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:11,900
I'm going to get you set up with a

754
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:12,539
new CSM.

755
00:19:12,619 --> 00:19:13,880
If we can't repair this, that's no

756
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:14,400
problem.

757
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:15,759
And then I just want to ensure

758
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:17,109
that there's as diligent of a

759
00:19:17,109 --> 00:19:18,650
handover as possible so that the

760
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:20,190
next CSM that you are working with

761
00:19:20,269 --> 00:19:21,809
is going to be able, is mapped out

762
00:19:21,809 --> 00:19:22,940
for your success.

763
00:19:23,019 --> 00:19:24,029
We don't have to start from

764
00:19:24,049 --> 00:19:24,559
scratch.

765
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:26,339
Like, they can't take it

766
00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:27,460
personally.

767
00:19:27,589 --> 00:19:29,029
They should, to a certain degree,

768
00:19:29,029 --> 00:19:30,619
professionally take it personally

769
00:19:30,619 --> 00:19:32,049
because they've really let down

770
00:19:32,049 --> 00:19:32,779
the client.

771
00:19:32,859 --> 00:19:33,880
And this client is now after

772
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:34,839
asking for a change.

773
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,569
But, I mean, realistically, you're

774
00:19:36,569 --> 00:19:37,819
looking for someone who has a

775
00:19:37,869 --> 00:19:39,579
serious amount of accountability.

776
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:41,640
Your CSM is never going to succeed

777
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,759
unless they can take constructive

778
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:45,680
criticism and hold themselves

779
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,200
highly accountable.

780
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,500
This is the most highly

781
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,150
accountable role that you can

782
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:52,259
possibly have inside of a company.

783
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:54,069
If you let the client down, you've

784
00:19:54,069 --> 00:19:54,940
let them down badly.

785
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:56,930
Like, the key word in client

786
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:59,039
success manager is the success

787
00:19:59,039 --> 00:19:59,680
part.

788
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:01,160
If the client's not getting

789
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,029
success, it's on you, the CSM.

790
00:20:03,259 --> 00:20:06,750
Learning and adaptability.

791
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,309
This is another question that I

792
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:09,740
would really push you to do in

793
00:20:09,789 --> 00:20:11,349
your interview process because

794
00:20:11,349 --> 00:20:12,700
being a client success manager

795
00:20:12,779 --> 00:20:14,069
means that you also have to know

796
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:15,690
the product, the service, the

797
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:17,630
industry, the niche, inside and

798
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:18,009
out.

799
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:20,650
I would honestly tell you that

800
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:22,380
your CSM should know your product

801
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,089
and service better than you, the

802
00:20:24,089 --> 00:20:24,819
founder.

803
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,819
Straight up, they should.

804
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,500
That's what they should strive to

805
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,019
do.

806
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:33,099
You know, like, for example, I'm

807
00:20:33,099 --> 00:20:34,799
the head of client success for

808
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,170
Client Ascension.

809
00:20:36,259 --> 00:20:38,609
I know Kajabi much more in-depth

810
00:20:38,609 --> 00:20:40,859
and what videos are which than

811
00:20:40,859 --> 00:20:43,109
possibly some of the founders

812
00:20:43,109 --> 00:20:45,000
because it is my job and my

813
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,410
responsibility to know it inside

814
00:20:47,549 --> 00:20:48,470
and out.

815
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:49,859
Not really theirs.

816
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:52,559
It is my job to understand it.

817
00:20:52,599 --> 00:20:54,130
I should know what's happening in

818
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:55,460
current market trends.

819
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,940
I should know what outreach

820
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,200
channels are working.

821
00:20:58,259 --> 00:20:59,690
I should know what type of sales

822
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:01,400
strategies and content strategies

823
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,930
and all these sort of strategies

824
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:03,740
are working.

825
00:21:03,779 --> 00:21:05,079
I should know what offers are

826
00:21:05,079 --> 00:21:05,680
working.

827
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,769
I should know what offers are not

828
00:21:06,789 --> 00:21:07,250
working.

829
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,710
Like, you understand, like, for me

830
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:11,599
to do my job, I need to be on the

831
00:21:11,779 --> 00:21:13,000
ball all the time.

832
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:14,740
I need to be self-aware of what is

833
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:16,059
happening constantly.

834
00:21:16,329 --> 00:21:17,960
And I need to also not only do my

835
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:20,150
work and complete my fulfillment,

836
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:21,730
I also need to stay on top of

837
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:23,650
current market trends because

838
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:25,609
there is a market and it's always

839
00:21:25,609 --> 00:21:26,519
moving.

840
00:21:26,599 --> 00:21:27,440
It's always shifting.

841
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:30,420
So, describe the time you had to

842
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:32,700
learn a completely new product or

843
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:35,039
industry and, like, how would you

844
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:36,119
go about it?

845
00:21:36,259 --> 00:21:37,490
That's a good question, like,

846
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:38,839
because that's going to give you

847
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:40,210
an indication then of, like, how

848
00:21:40,279 --> 00:21:41,799
is this person going to study us?

849
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,769
How is this person going to step

850
00:21:42,769 --> 00:21:43,339
in and learn?

851
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:44,849
Like, what is their learning

852
00:21:44,849 --> 00:21:45,380
style?

853
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,599
Does their learning style match my

854
00:21:46,599 --> 00:21:47,339
training style?

855
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:49,940
That's also a really big indicator

856
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:50,640
there.

857
00:21:50,859 --> 00:21:52,140
Some people love just doing a

858
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:53,609
bunch of Google Form tests,

859
00:21:53,609 --> 00:21:55,359
constantly rinse and repeat.

860
00:21:55,539 --> 00:21:56,819
Some people love modules and

861
00:21:56,819 --> 00:21:57,779
watching SOPs.

862
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,329
Some people want to be on a call

863
00:21:59,329 --> 00:22:01,339
and just probe you for questions.

864
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,579
You want to find out what their

865
00:22:02,579 --> 00:22:03,940
training style is because their

866
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,400
training style is the difference

867
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,079
between you,

868
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:07,529
having to invest two hours a week

869
00:22:07,529 --> 00:22:09,430
in the training to, like, 10, 12

870
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:10,740
hours a week in training.

871
00:22:10,819 --> 00:22:12,250
And then you obviously want to

872
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:13,720
find strategic thinking.

873
00:22:13,819 --> 00:22:14,450
Like, this is very

874
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:15,690
self-explanatory, but client

875
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:16,970
success managers need to have the

876
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:18,250
ability of actually being able to

877
00:22:18,259 --> 00:22:19,440
think in a strategic way.

878
00:22:19,609 --> 00:22:20,859
Like, you know, they need to

879
00:22:20,859 --> 00:22:22,279
identify opportunities.

880
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:23,900
They need to identify ideas.

881
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:24,839
They need to put one and one

882
00:22:24,839 --> 00:22:25,359
together.

883
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:26,740
They need to possess logistical

884
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:27,420
intensity.

885
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:29,559
You know, they need to be able to

886
00:22:29,559 --> 00:22:31,130
assess when they're speaking to a

887
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:32,529
client, like, revenue growth

888
00:22:32,569 --> 00:22:33,819
opportunities and give some

889
00:22:33,819 --> 00:22:35,349
analytical thinking and being able

890
00:22:35,349 --> 00:22:35,849
to break down

891
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:36,299
the numbers.

892
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,430
Like, you kind of can't be a

893
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:40,660
fucking idiot when you do this

894
00:22:40,819 --> 00:22:41,480
role.

895
00:22:41,579 --> 00:22:43,519
It doesn't particularly help.

896
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:46,299
You know, so data analysis.

897
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,049
Again, when I say data analysis as

898
00:22:48,059 --> 00:22:49,759
well, to a certain degree, a lot

899
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:51,410
of people get themselves really

900
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:52,180
fucked up about it.

901
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:53,240
You don't have to get yourself

902
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,220
completely, you know.

903
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:56,640
It's just simple math.

904
00:22:56,809 --> 00:22:58,170
Like, you just don't have to mess

905
00:22:58,170 --> 00:22:58,799
around it.

906
00:22:59,049 --> 00:23:00,450
Like, as long as you know metrics

907
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:02,170
in your industry, that is, like,

908
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:03,809
kind of like the standard KPI,

909
00:23:03,809 --> 00:23:05,329
you're going to be sweet.

910
00:23:05,619 --> 00:23:07,329
You don't need to do, like,

911
00:23:07,329 --> 00:23:08,720
algebra and shit.

912
00:23:10,339 --> 00:23:11,730
But they also need to know, like,

913
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:12,579
when's a red flag?

914
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,599
Like, what's a red flag in a

915
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:14,039
client?

916
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:15,789
What's a red flag in their process

917
00:23:15,789 --> 00:23:17,500
and their review pattern and how

918
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,400
they do things?

919
00:23:18,619 --> 00:23:19,710
Like, these are things that are

920
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:21,140
going to be very, very important.

921
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,680
So, you know, walk me through how

922
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,900
you conduct a client health

923
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:25,579
assessment and things like that.

924
00:23:26,059 --> 00:23:27,170
These are good questions to also

925
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:27,819
ask as well.

926
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,210
Like, how do you determine what is

927
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:30,559
a good client in a healthy pattern

928
00:23:30,569 --> 00:23:31,880
than a client that's in a negative

929
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:32,559
pattern?

930
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:34,180
That will also give you a really

931
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:35,539
good insight about if they

932
00:23:35,589 --> 00:23:37,359
actually know anything about your

933
00:23:37,369 --> 00:23:39,339
business as well, in terms of,

934
00:23:39,339 --> 00:23:40,339
like, KPIs.

935
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:42,559
What's good, like, what's a good

936
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:44,240
result, for example?

937
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:46,319
You know, like, again, if you're a

938
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:48,430
content agency, for example, how

939
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:50,049
many views on a YouTube video

940
00:23:50,049 --> 00:23:51,710
would you consider to be a good

941
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:53,359
amount of views if we published it

942
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:53,970
for a client?

943
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:55,619
It then lets you know, like,

944
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:56,940
what's their expectations and

945
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,450
what's the realistic expectation,

946
00:23:58,519 --> 00:23:59,819
if they're aligned or not.

947
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:02,440
So, the curiosity of the test, if

948
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,890
they have no questions, this is

949
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:07,420
like a disqualifying red flag for

950
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:07,930
me.

951
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:10,299
Like, again, I've mentioned this

952
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:10,980
before.

953
00:24:11,259 --> 00:24:12,650
Just if they don't have any

954
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:14,630
questions about at the end of the

955
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:16,019
interview, just.

956
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:20,619
It's not a good look.

957
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,160
They have not done any research.

958
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,259
They should be asking questions

959
00:24:25,259 --> 00:24:25,859
about you.

960
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:27,180
What's your plan?

961
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:29,180
Where do you see me?

962
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,329
Why are you hiring me in this

963
00:24:30,329 --> 00:24:30,720
role?

964
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:31,740
What's the impact?

965
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:32,799
What's needed of me?

966
00:24:32,869 --> 00:24:33,789
If I was to start tomorrow, what

967
00:24:33,789 --> 00:24:34,789
would be the first thing I'd have

968
00:24:34,789 --> 00:24:35,279
to learn?

969
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:36,500
Like, you're looking just for

970
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,779
these sort of questions here.

971
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,970
It just really identifies an A

972
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:39,440
player.

973
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:40,990
But even a B player and a C player

974
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,380
will at least have one or two

975
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:43,140
questions.

976
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:44,690
An A player will have, like, five,

977
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:46,319
six, seven questions off the rip.

978
00:24:46,599 --> 00:24:49,779
So, client types, team structures,

979
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:52,869
success metrics, growth path, and

980
00:24:52,869 --> 00:24:54,079
daily work.

981
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:55,980
You know, these are good questions

982
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,660
that you're looking to have.

983
00:24:57,839 --> 00:24:59,539
Again, how does it work?

984
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:00,619
How am I fitting in here?

985
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:01,400
Success metrics.

986
00:25:01,529 --> 00:25:02,940
What KPIs am I going to be under?

987
00:25:03,109 --> 00:25:03,980
What's the growth?

988
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:05,000
Where am I going to be in the

989
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,079
company in five years' time if I

990
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:06,799
was to join you?

991
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:08,299
What are your types of clients?

992
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:09,579
What's your daily work look like?

993
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:10,750
You know, what are you currently

994
00:25:10,789 --> 00:25:11,880
doing right now that you want me

995
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:12,720
to come in and step and

996
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:13,319
fulfill for you?

997
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:17,019
And then quality questions to

998
00:25:17,019 --> 00:25:17,640
listen for.

999
00:25:17,819 --> 00:25:19,380
What does a typical client journey

1000
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:20,990
look like from sale to renewal?

1001
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,440
What's your biggest challenges

1002
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,799
with your current CSMs face?

1003
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:26,099
How do you measure CSM success?

1004
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:27,250
What type of clients do you most

1005
00:25:27,269 --> 00:25:28,329
success in your solution?

1006
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:30,109
How do CSMs team interact with

1007
00:25:30,119 --> 00:25:31,339
each department?

1008
00:25:31,549 --> 00:25:32,839
What support systems exist?

1009
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,259
What does the first 90 days look

1010
00:25:34,259 --> 00:25:34,619
like?

1011
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:35,690
How do clients' assignments

1012
00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:36,259
determine?

1013
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,359
What tech stack do you run?

1014
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:39,710
How are CSMs involved in product

1015
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:40,960
feedback and development?

1016
00:25:41,059 --> 00:25:41,779
Like, these are just good

1017
00:25:41,859 --> 00:25:42,319
questions.

1018
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,859
If you get any of these questions,

1019
00:25:43,859 --> 00:25:45,279
you're on to a very strong winner

1020
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:45,670
here.

1021
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:47,599
Evaluating candidate questions,

1022
00:25:47,609 --> 00:25:49,329
it's just before it's quality and

1023
00:25:49,329 --> 00:25:50,119
quantity.

1024
00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:52,279
Now we're going to go into CSM

1025
00:25:52,279 --> 00:25:54,180
compensation models.

1026
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,720
There's typically two models that

1027
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,190
you can go for when you're going –

1028
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:58,380
oh, sorry, technically

1029
00:25:58,569 --> 00:25:59,200
three, actually.

1030
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:00,559
There's three kind of models you

1031
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:01,890
can go for compensation models

1032
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:03,240
when it goes to client success

1033
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:03,680
management.

1034
00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:04,940
You can go with the strict

1035
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:06,890
performance-based compensation.

1036
00:26:07,079 --> 00:26:09,119
This is going to be roughly – and

1037
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:11,190
again, depends on the height

1038
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:13,200
ticket and the actual touch

1039
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:14,769
point of the business, and I'll go

1040
00:26:14,769 --> 00:26:16,019
into that in a later video as

1041
00:26:16,019 --> 00:26:16,480
well.

1042
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:18,650
But, you know, depends on the

1043
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:21,140
actual, like, ticket cost of the

1044
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:22,500
client as well.

1045
00:26:22,569 --> 00:26:24,559
So you're looking at roughly $60

1046
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:26,539
to maybe $150 per client.

1047
00:26:26,619 --> 00:26:28,160
You're looking to give them then

1048
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,839
about 8 to maybe even 10% of

1049
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:31,269
back-end revenue that they've

1050
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:31,700
generated.

1051
00:26:31,779 --> 00:26:33,779
You know, $150 bonus for every

1052
00:26:33,779 --> 00:26:35,869
$10K of back-end revenue that they

1053
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:36,720
generate.

1054
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:37,809
And then there's going to be,

1055
00:26:37,809 --> 00:26:38,829
like, bonuses for referrals and

1056
00:26:38,829 --> 00:26:39,799
things like that, and maybe

1057
00:26:39,859 --> 00:26:40,970
run some team competitions and

1058
00:26:41,009 --> 00:26:41,819
things like that.

1059
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,119
The positives of someone working

1060
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:46,190
on a performance basis is that

1061
00:26:46,339 --> 00:26:48,220
they take their clients' outcomes

1062
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,390
extremely seriously.

1063
00:26:49,579 --> 00:26:51,339
Like, every client counts.

1064
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,250
If a client has to go on pause or

1065
00:26:53,259 --> 00:26:55,240
a client churns, that affects

1066
00:26:55,269 --> 00:26:56,180
their pay.

1067
00:26:56,289 --> 00:26:58,250
So, therefore, there's a genuine

1068
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:00,019
incentive for them to actually

1069
00:27:00,019 --> 00:27:01,980
fight for that client to retain

1070
00:27:02,059 --> 00:27:02,640
in the company.

1071
00:27:02,819 --> 00:27:04,799
They have more focus on their

1072
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:07,000
retention and their growth.

1073
00:27:07,319 --> 00:27:09,309
They're more self-motivated.

1074
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:10,960
And they are there to kind of,

1075
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,690
like, they're scaling with your

1076
00:27:12,789 --> 00:27:14,039
business success.

1077
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:15,279
This is a really good way for

1078
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:16,930
businesses, especially if you're

1079
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:18,740
starting off getting your first

1080
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:19,190
handful

1081
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:20,460
of client success managers.

1082
00:27:21,099 --> 00:27:22,809
Because they're going to be

1083
00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:24,890
building and scaling with the

1084
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:26,539
company, you know.

1085
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,519
The problem is, the con with this

1086
00:27:29,619 --> 00:27:32,599
is, if the businesses has, you

1087
00:27:32,599 --> 00:27:35,059
know, volatile issues in

1088
00:27:35,259 --> 00:27:36,579
terms of lead generation and

1089
00:27:36,579 --> 00:27:38,059
you're not bringing in as many

1090
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:39,900
clients as you want, your CSM is

1091
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:40,319
suffering

1092
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:41,319
in terms of pay.

1093
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:43,140
Now, you can make the argument

1094
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:44,890
that they're not doing as many

1095
00:27:44,890 --> 00:27:46,619
hours a week because they don't

1096
00:27:46,789 --> 00:27:48,240
have as many clients to fulfill.

1097
00:27:49,059 --> 00:27:50,710
That's fair enough, but there is

1098
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:52,609
an element there at that beginning

1099
00:27:52,609 --> 00:27:53,859
period where they are

1100
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:54,819
going to be doing a fair amount of

1101
00:27:54,819 --> 00:27:55,250
training.

1102
00:27:55,329 --> 00:27:56,930
So, if they are in the role for a

1103
00:27:56,930 --> 00:27:58,470
certain amount of months and

1104
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,559
they're, you know, they're, say,

1105
00:28:00,599 --> 00:28:02,480
a medium-touched, you know, client

1106
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,309
success manager, which typically

1107
00:28:04,309 --> 00:28:05,750
deals with anywhere between

1108
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:07,460
50 and 60 clients, and they've

1109
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:08,829
been stuck on 20 clients for a

1110
00:28:08,859 --> 00:28:10,140
couple of months, obviously,

1111
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:11,420
their pay is going to reflect

1112
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:11,839
that.

1113
00:28:12,259 --> 00:28:13,559
That may cause them to grow

1114
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:15,559
frustrated with your lead flow.

1115
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:18,259
It can also develop potential

1116
00:28:18,259 --> 00:28:20,220
short-term thinking.

1117
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:23,599
In a way that if you have an

1118
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:26,380
employee that's on a base salary,

1119
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:28,740
you can kind of hand off more

1120
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,069
additional tasks to take off of

1121
00:28:30,069 --> 00:28:30,960
your fulfillment.

1122
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:32,789
But when they're only getting paid

1123
00:28:32,789 --> 00:28:34,509
per client, they are going to give

1124
00:28:34,549 --> 00:28:36,000
you the pushback of like,

1125
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:37,220
that's not in my role.

1126
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:38,309
That's not my responsibility.

1127
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:39,940
I'm only paid for the clients that

1128
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:40,640
I work with.

1129
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:42,420
Any of these tasks that are

1130
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:43,700
outside of my role, not my

1131
00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:44,400
problem.

1132
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,950
So, it does come with it ebbs and

1133
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:47,740
flows.

1134
00:28:47,859 --> 00:28:49,329
And then also requires you with

1135
00:28:49,339 --> 00:28:50,960
strong tracking systems, like

1136
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,519
you're going to have to be very

1137
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:54,230
on the ball because if you miss

1138
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:55,910
payment or you miscalculate or

1139
00:28:56,009 --> 00:28:57,559
they miscalculate or in any

1140
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:59,470
sort of capacity, it's going to

1141
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:00,539
cause friction.

1142
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,980
So, this works really well with

1143
00:29:03,019 --> 00:29:05,400
businesses with consistent lead

1144
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:07,440
flow that have clear expansion

1145
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:09,160
pathways, but it also really

1146
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,190
attracts like the entrepreneurial

1147
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:12,880
type of mindset at client success

1148
00:29:13,059 --> 00:29:14,430
managers who want to like have

1149
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,130
more control about their actual

1150
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:17,220
earning potential.

1151
00:29:17,569 --> 00:29:20,599
So, it's a really good model.

1152
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,789
I would strongly recommend it,

1153
00:29:22,819 --> 00:29:25,190
especially if you're starting out

1154
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:26,980
and you are worried about

1155
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:29,140
like what that compensation

1156
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:31,039
structure looks like.

1157
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:33,539
And if you want to be very mindful

1158
00:29:33,549 --> 00:29:36,170
of your profit margins and your

1159
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:37,440
business actual

1160
00:29:37,619 --> 00:29:39,400
income, the second option is the

1161
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,339
salary-based compensation.

1162
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,690
And you're going to be looking at

1163
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:45,240
anywhere between $3,000 to $5,000.

1164
00:29:45,369 --> 00:29:46,720
They're still going to be getting

1165
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,049
back-end percentages for all

1166
00:29:48,049 --> 00:29:49,579
back-end revenue generated.

1167
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,259
If you don't give your client

1168
00:29:51,259 --> 00:29:52,880
success manager any sort of

1169
00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:54,690
back-end revenue compensation

1170
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,650
whatsoever, you're not going to

1171
00:29:56,650 --> 00:29:58,509
retain any clients because they

1172
00:29:58,509 --> 00:29:59,960
have no incentive to do

1173
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:01,339
so at all.

1174
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,799
Their back-end sales conversation

1175
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:06,420
is going to be, hey, so do you

1176
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:07,519
want to stay on?

1177
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:08,319
Nope.

1178
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,359
All right.

1179
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,380
It's nice knowing you.

1180
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:12,200
And that's just not effective.

1181
00:30:12,259 --> 00:30:13,589
You're just going to churn so many

1182
00:30:13,599 --> 00:30:14,500
clients that way.

1183
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:16,109
The pros of it, they have

1184
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:18,400
predictable and steady income.

1185
00:30:18,579 --> 00:30:20,000
They can focus on more long-term

1186
00:30:20,019 --> 00:30:20,980
relationships.

1187
00:30:21,619 --> 00:30:23,029
It is easier in terms of payroll

1188
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:24,700
because it's just the same pricing

1189
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,140
kind of on a month-to-month

1190
00:30:26,319 --> 00:30:27,619
basis until that back-end revenue

1191
00:30:27,619 --> 00:30:28,440
really kicks in.

1192
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:30,589
And like, you're not going to have

1193
00:30:30,589 --> 00:30:32,319
as much churn and burn when it

1194
00:30:32,319 --> 00:30:33,880
comes to your CSMs because

1195
00:30:34,059 --> 00:30:35,799
again, they just, they know what's

1196
00:30:35,799 --> 00:30:37,180
coming in every month.

1197
00:30:37,259 --> 00:30:38,220
They know what they're earning.

1198
00:30:38,289 --> 00:30:39,890
It creates, you know, a lot of

1199
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:40,779
stableness.

1200
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,259
However, the problems that come is

1201
00:30:43,259 --> 00:30:45,259
complacency because things aren't

1202
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:46,369
going to change and

1203
00:30:46,569 --> 00:30:47,549
their pay is going to be one way

1204
00:30:47,549 --> 00:30:48,200
or the other.

1205
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:49,900
And again, it's like, if you pay

1206
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,680
them five grand, you know, their

1207
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:52,880
back-end is only six

1208
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:53,019
grand.

1209
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:54,410
I mean, is it really that much in

1210
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:55,240
the difference?

1211
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:57,000
I mean, is it really going to

1212
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,099
change my life?

1213
00:30:58,279 --> 00:30:59,920
Who knows?

1214
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:02,150
And again, complacency is really

1215
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:03,759
the death in terms of being a

1216
00:31:03,759 --> 00:31:05,460
client success manager.

1217
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,559
There's no direct connection,

1218
00:31:07,559 --> 00:31:09,730
again, between their effort and

1219
00:31:09,769 --> 00:31:11,029
their rewards.

1220
00:31:11,099 --> 00:31:12,019
They don't really feel like

1221
00:31:12,019 --> 00:31:13,099
they've enjoyed the fruits of

1222
00:31:13,099 --> 00:31:13,759
their labor.

1223
00:31:13,799 --> 00:31:15,250
I mean, if you're paying them just

1224
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:16,740
a flat fee, it's just like, cool,

1225
00:31:16,839 --> 00:31:17,700
I got my flat fee.

1226
00:31:17,869 --> 00:31:19,720
And you may attract people into

1227
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,869
the role that are just looking for

1228
00:31:22,019 --> 00:31:23,900
something easy, remote.

1229
00:31:24,079 --> 00:31:25,470
These type of mindset of people

1230
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:26,880
that just kind of want to work

1231
00:31:26,930 --> 00:31:28,269
from home and get a steady

1232
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:28,759
income.

1233
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:30,960
Again, not really push themselves

1234
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:31,920
above and beyond.

1235
00:31:32,119 --> 00:31:34,660
And it's really hard to justify

1236
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:37,369
the payments and the costs when

1237
00:31:37,369 --> 00:31:39,880
things do go tough and the

1238
00:31:40,059 --> 00:31:41,240
business is in a little bit of a

1239
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:41,599
rut.

1240
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:43,589
It's just, it's going to, it can

1241
00:31:43,589 --> 00:31:45,180
put you under quite a bit of

1242
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:45,960
pressure.

1243
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:49,369
So I would really only look at

1244
00:31:49,369 --> 00:31:52,509
this sort of model if you are

1245
00:31:52,509 --> 00:31:55,619
generating solid monthly

1246
00:31:55,619 --> 00:31:56,150
reoccurring

1247
00:31:56,339 --> 00:31:56,599
revenue.

1248
00:31:56,769 --> 00:31:58,660
You find an A player and the, you

1249
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:00,759
know, the pricing model without

1250
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:02,480
like a set base is like

1251
00:32:02,519 --> 00:32:04,000
a non-negotiable for them, or it's

1252
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,690
someone in a more senior position.

1253
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:11,130
So there's also this model here,

1254
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:14,019
which I actually really do like.

1255
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:15,680
And it's the hybrid model.

1256
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:17,109
The hybrid model is basically a

1257
00:32:17,109 --> 00:32:18,660
structure of a small base between

1258
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:22,039
$1,000 to $2,000, a smaller

1259
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,720
cap than per client per head,

1260
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,680
because you are compensating them

1261
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:26,619
with a base.

1262
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:28,119
So there's like, there's a ground

1263
00:32:28,119 --> 00:32:29,599
level of what they're making.

1264
00:32:30,359 --> 00:32:32,029
And then there's also like, you

1265
00:32:32,029 --> 00:32:33,980
know, the in-between of what their

1266
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:35,460
back-end revenue is going to

1267
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:35,900
look like.

1268
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:36,990
Because one way or the other,

1269
00:32:37,009 --> 00:32:38,309
whether you like it or not, you're

1270
00:32:38,309 --> 00:32:39,500
going to have to reward your

1271
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,990
staff with good back-end revenue

1272
00:32:42,029 --> 00:32:44,680
percentages or half-decent ones,

1273
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:46,440
because if they're not

1274
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,869
doing back-end and not retaining

1275
00:32:47,869 --> 00:32:49,279
customers, then there's no real

1276
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:50,299
point in any of this.

1277
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:53,009
So that always has to be decent.

1278
00:32:53,059 --> 00:32:54,450
I would never do anything less

1279
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:55,700
than 5%, by the way.

1280
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,819
And then over in time, when

1281
00:32:57,819 --> 00:33:00,210
they're with you long enough,

1282
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:03,140
especially, you know, your CSMs,

1283
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:04,890
and they've put in good work, and

1284
00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:06,490
they've brought in an actual ROI

1285
00:33:06,579 --> 00:33:08,569
to the company, you can look

1286
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,880
at then increasing the base,

1287
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,380
increasing their cost per client,

1288
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:12,700
and increasing their back-end

1289
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:15,000
revenue as forms of giving them,

1290
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,240
you know, a salary boost that is

1291
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,150
backed by performance and

1292
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:19,960
work ethic.

1293
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:21,490
So it works quite well.

1294
00:33:21,559 --> 00:33:23,819
So I do like the hybrid approach,

1295
00:33:23,859 --> 00:33:26,160
if that's something you'd like to

1296
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,440
go for as well.

1297
00:33:27,619 --> 00:33:31,319
So, CSM types by business model

1298
00:33:31,319 --> 00:33:35,140
and things like that as well.

1299
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:37,039
So you have three different types

1300
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:39,029
of client success managers, and it

1301
00:33:39,069 --> 00:33:40,250
really does depend

1302
00:33:40,359 --> 00:33:41,700
on the type of business that you

1303
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:42,099
have.

1304
00:33:42,279 --> 00:33:44,920
You have low-touch CSMs.

1305
00:33:45,099 --> 00:33:47,009
These client success managers can

1306
00:33:47,009 --> 00:33:48,980
take on to 100 clients.

1307
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:51,809
It really means it's kind of more

1308
00:33:51,809 --> 00:33:53,700
so for like info products or like

1309
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:54,960
SaaS products where

1310
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:56,799
like clients don't really need

1311
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:58,920
that much interaction with you.

1312
00:33:59,099 --> 00:34:00,980
They don't need weekly meetings.

1313
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:02,299
They don't even need monthly

1314
00:34:02,299 --> 00:34:03,740
meetings, like some check-in

1315
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:05,519
messages, maybe over email or

1316
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:06,039
Slack,

1317
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,779
and maybe the odd call to kind of

1318
00:34:07,779 --> 00:34:09,800
help them with a certain issue.

1319
00:34:10,219 --> 00:34:13,340
But calls are not like a high

1320
00:34:13,489 --> 00:34:15,079
priority.

1321
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:16,860
It's just like messaging, emailing

1322
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:18,559
on a day-to-day basis, and just

1323
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:20,079
kind of like helping clients

1324
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:21,789
through very small, mediocre

1325
00:34:21,789 --> 00:34:22,559
problems.

1326
00:34:24,179 --> 00:34:26,460
That's a low-touch point CSM.

1327
00:34:26,519 --> 00:34:28,409
So if you feel like your business

1328
00:34:28,409 --> 00:34:29,760
model isn't super high

1329
00:34:29,909 --> 00:34:31,880
client-facing, but you still need

1330
00:34:32,059 --> 00:34:33,480
someone to kind of manage things,

1331
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,860
that's what you're going to get

1332
00:34:34,909 --> 00:34:35,360
here.

1333
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:40,460
A mid-touch CSM is going to work

1334
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:43,559
anywhere between 50 to 70 clients,

1335
00:34:43,559 --> 00:34:45,460
and this is going to be someone

1336
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:47,369
who is going to run monthly

1337
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:49,039
reporting calls with each client.

1338
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:50,800
They're going to maybe host like

1339
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,289
some sort of an office hour so

1340
00:34:52,289 --> 00:34:54,090
that all clients can step in and

1341
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:55,360
ask kind of a Q&A question.

1342
00:34:55,969 --> 00:34:57,309
They're an expert in their field

1343
00:34:57,309 --> 00:34:58,949
in coordination and scheduling,

1344
00:34:58,949 --> 00:35:00,460
but they're also an expert in the

1345
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:02,079
product and understanding how to

1346
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:02,739
utilize it.

1347
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:04,039
They're there to kind of really

1348
00:35:04,039 --> 00:35:05,440
make sure that people are getting

1349
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:05,920
an ROI.

1350
00:35:06,099 --> 00:35:07,989
Like the actual SSEs inside of

1351
00:35:07,989 --> 00:35:10,230
Client Ascension are a very good

1352
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,369
example of mid-touch CSMs.

1353
00:35:12,539 --> 00:35:13,739
So there's a few times a week

1354
00:35:13,739 --> 00:35:15,329
they're checking in with you.

1355
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:16,320
They're doing calls.

1356
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,469
They may even do like the odd

1357
00:35:17,469 --> 00:35:19,010
emergency call then if something's

1358
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:20,639
really going wrong, and they're

1359
00:35:20,639 --> 00:35:22,400
also responsible for the renewals

1360
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,769
and expansion conversations in

1361
00:35:23,769 --> 00:35:24,820
terms of the company.

1362
00:35:25,699 --> 00:35:26,929
Coaching companies, consulting

1363
00:35:26,929 --> 00:35:28,360
companies, mid-tier agencies, and

1364
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,619
SaaS companies, and things like

1365
00:35:29,619 --> 00:35:30,019
that.

1366
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:30,960
You know, these sort of

1367
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,440
experience, again, for someone to

1368
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,559
do this sort of role, you are

1369
00:35:33,559 --> 00:35:34,940
looking for someone for like two,

1370
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:36,320
three years' experience.

1371
00:35:36,389 --> 00:35:37,539
For like a low-touch point CSM, I

1372
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:38,769
mean, honestly, like a year's

1373
00:35:38,769 --> 00:35:40,179
experience is going to be fine.

1374
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,929
High-touch CSM.

1375
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:43,690
These guys are absolute experts in

1376
00:35:43,699 --> 00:35:44,539
their fields.

1377
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:46,079
These are genuinely, they're not

1378
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:47,340
even like just client success

1379
00:35:47,349 --> 00:35:47,949
managers.

1380
00:35:48,059 --> 00:35:48,780
They're more like the client

1381
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:49,550
success advisors.

1382
00:35:49,739 --> 00:35:51,019
They're very strategic.

1383
00:35:51,199 --> 00:35:53,480
They know this industry inside and

1384
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,000
out.

1385
00:35:54,659 --> 00:35:56,250
They do a lot of the heavy lifting

1386
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:57,219
with clients.

1387
00:35:57,389 --> 00:35:58,639
They're going to be on multiple

1388
00:35:58,639 --> 00:35:59,440
calls per week.

1389
00:35:59,559 --> 00:36:00,980
You're talking like anywhere

1390
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:03,199
between, you know, 20 to 25 calls

1391
00:36:03,199 --> 00:36:03,719
a week.

1392
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:05,559
They're going to be very hands-on,

1393
00:36:05,559 --> 00:36:07,280
a lot of communication, kind of a

1394
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,000
lot of element of like stepping in

1395
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,710
and helping the client with their

1396
00:36:10,719 --> 00:36:11,809
specific issue.

1397
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,650
You know, very hands-on kind of

1398
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:14,280
approach.

1399
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:15,739
You know, they'll have multiple

1400
00:36:15,739 --> 00:36:17,260
weekly strategy consultations and

1401
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,659
planning in place, you know,

1402
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:19,980
detailed implementation and

1403
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:21,329
guidance, like really custom

1404
00:36:21,329 --> 00:36:22,800
strategy and development for the

1405
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,820
client's goals.

1406
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,570
Like almost like a done-with-you

1407
00:36:25,570 --> 00:36:27,380
project management, like high,

1408
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:28,929
high accountability, daily

1409
00:36:28,969 --> 00:36:31,099
conversations and accountability,

1410
00:36:31,099 --> 00:36:33,130
and like really advanced renewal

1411
00:36:33,219 --> 00:36:35,239
and expansion strategies for that

1412
00:36:35,239 --> 00:36:36,510
specific client.

1413
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:38,570
These guys typically only work,

1414
00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:41,050
again, with 20 to 35 clients at a

1415
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:42,880
time because it is so high touch

1416
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,000
point on such a constant basis.

1417
00:36:45,179 --> 00:36:47,079
They may be having weekly calls

1418
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:49,070
with each and every client, at

1419
00:36:49,159 --> 00:36:50,559
least bi-weekly.

1420
00:36:51,739 --> 00:36:53,119
So these guys are very, very high

1421
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:54,360
touch point, you know.

1422
00:36:54,539 --> 00:36:55,739
Common hiring mistake, many

1423
00:36:55,739 --> 00:36:57,340
companies hire CSMs with the wrong

1424
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:59,099
profile for their business model.

1425
00:36:59,199 --> 00:37:00,960
For example, you know, again, I've

1426
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,389
seen guys that like hire a high

1427
00:37:02,389 --> 00:37:03,809
touch CSM for a low touch point

1428
00:37:03,809 --> 00:37:04,539
product.

1429
00:37:04,619 --> 00:37:06,250
And that creates a serious amount

1430
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:08,090
of frustration because this person

1431
00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:09,800
is like just generally drilled to

1432
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,320
keep people engaged and highly

1433
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,969
accountable and coaching them

1434
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,380
through a situation.

1435
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,840
And that just product and niche

1436
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,360
and market just doesn't understand

1437
00:37:17,519 --> 00:37:17,989
that.

1438
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:19,690
So really take into consideration

1439
00:37:19,690 --> 00:37:21,300
how much time your client's facing

1440
00:37:21,449 --> 00:37:22,980
is actually taking you before you

1441
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:24,239
kind of really kind of push

1442
00:37:24,239 --> 00:37:25,730
forward in that as well.

1443
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:27,420
And then again, for like hiring a

1444
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:28,980
low touch point for a high value

1445
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,239
client that needs a lot of

1446
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:31,920
handholding as well, just kind of

1447
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,239
like undermines the client's

1448
00:37:33,239 --> 00:37:33,829
success.

1449
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:34,840
They're not going to be able to

1450
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:35,800
understand how to scale that

1451
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:36,579
person whatsoever.

1452
00:37:36,639 --> 00:37:38,050
So just take all that into

1453
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:40,159
consideration and just like really

1454
00:37:40,159 --> 00:37:41,840
try and map out into your head

1455
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,809
like what the client interaction

1456
00:37:43,809 --> 00:37:46,039
looks like on a day-to-day basis.

1457
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,750
So, yeah, you know, average client

1458
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:50,039
contract value, complexity of

1459
00:37:50,039 --> 00:37:51,300
implementation, frequency of

1460
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,579
client interaction needed for

1461
00:37:52,579 --> 00:37:53,690
success and level of strategic

1462
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:54,840
guidance required.

1463
00:37:55,079 --> 00:37:58,420
So CSM assessment scorecard.

1464
00:37:58,500 --> 00:37:59,800
So a standardized assessment

1465
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,400
scorecard here is basically so you

1466
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:02,309
get a little bit of an

1467
00:38:02,349 --> 00:38:03,340
understanding.

1468
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,639
And like when you're doing your

1469
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:05,840
interview process, you can

1470
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,329
actually just kind of like monitor

1471
00:38:07,329 --> 00:38:08,769
like what the responses are.

1472
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,349
Because sometimes if you don't

1473
00:38:10,369 --> 00:38:12,050
have something like this in place

1474
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:13,739
when you're doing an interview,

1475
00:38:13,739 --> 00:38:15,230
you can sometimes get yourself

1476
00:38:15,349 --> 00:38:16,710
slightly fooled by a client

1477
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:18,320
success manager, especially when

1478
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:18,900
with sales skills.

1479
00:38:19,699 --> 00:38:21,059
Sometimes they can sound better at

1480
00:38:21,059 --> 00:38:22,500
the role than they actually are in

1481
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:23,519
implementation.

1482
00:38:23,619 --> 00:38:24,889
So you want to kind of create a

1483
00:38:24,889 --> 00:38:26,519
scorecard so that you can actually

1484
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:28,190
kind of monitor responses and kind

1485
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:29,480
of rate them and having your

1486
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:31,139
questions kind of organized.

1487
00:38:31,519 --> 00:38:32,670
helps with just a piece of paper

1488
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:34,030
and pen, to be honest with you,

1489
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:35,389
maybe kind of like, you know, a

1490
00:38:35,389 --> 00:38:36,760
little clipboard to just kind of

1491
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:38,030
help you and just having these

1492
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:39,300
questions laid out with their

1493
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:39,900
name.

1494
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,159
And, you know, that way you can

1495
00:38:41,159 --> 00:38:42,500
actually mark their competency,

1496
00:38:42,559 --> 00:38:43,880
their relationship management

1497
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,329
skills, their strategic thinking

1498
00:38:45,329 --> 00:38:46,679
skills, and if they're a cultural

1499
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,280
fit.

1500
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:50,400
So it goes by this CRM, you know,

1501
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,559
CRM experience, have they used any

1502
00:38:52,559 --> 00:38:53,840
CRMs in the past?

1503
00:38:54,039 --> 00:38:55,239
What CRMs have they used?

1504
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,409
What are they proficient in?

1505
00:38:56,610 --> 00:38:58,559
You know, are they completely new

1506
00:38:58,559 --> 00:38:59,260
to CRMs?

1507
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,159
Because that's going to be a,

1508
00:39:00,159 --> 00:39:01,179
that's going to be a training that

1509
00:39:01,179 --> 00:39:02,159
you're going to have to do.

1510
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,659
Remember, all of these questions

1511
00:39:03,659 --> 00:39:05,059
here is going to be anything that

1512
00:39:05,059 --> 00:39:06,050
needs work is going to be

1513
00:39:06,090 --> 00:39:07,260
additional training.

1514
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,349
And you need to take that in

1515
00:39:08,369 --> 00:39:09,710
consideration of how many hours

1516
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:10,960
it's going to take you to train

1517
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,369
someone to get something like this

1518
00:39:12,409 --> 00:39:12,820
done.

1519
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:13,880
If they're good, then you're

1520
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,119
looking at like, okay, cool.

1521
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:16,409
We might just be a week or two

1522
00:39:16,409 --> 00:39:17,559
here and they're going to be

1523
00:39:17,559 --> 00:39:18,059
a-okay.

1524
00:39:18,139 --> 00:39:19,429
If they're excellent, it's like,

1525
00:39:19,429 --> 00:39:19,940
perfect.

1526
00:39:20,119 --> 00:39:21,579
This is right up their alley.

1527
00:39:21,659 --> 00:39:22,739
They're going to see this.

1528
00:39:22,809 --> 00:39:23,739
They're going to know how we work.

1529
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:25,050
They're going to lock in within

1530
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:25,559
the day.

1531
00:39:25,619 --> 00:39:27,880
So CRM experience, data analysis,

1532
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:30,300
communication, process thinking,

1533
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,539
industry knowledge, technical

1534
00:39:32,539 --> 00:39:32,980
learning.

1535
00:39:33,039 --> 00:39:35,460
So relationship management then,

1536
00:39:35,469 --> 00:39:37,940
conflict resolution questions,

1537
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:39,920
client advocacy questions, trust

1538
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:41,360
building questions, emotional

1539
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,980
intelligence, and influence

1540
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:43,639
skills.

1541
00:39:44,139 --> 00:39:45,519
So you'll be able to track and

1542
00:39:45,519 --> 00:39:47,309
monitor these, again, on a point

1543
00:39:47,309 --> 00:39:49,420
system from five, three, and one.

1544
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:51,260
And then strategic thinking,

1545
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:53,030
problem diagnosis, pattern

1546
00:39:53,039 --> 00:39:55,329
recognition, growth orientation,

1547
00:39:55,329 --> 00:39:57,239
business acumen, and resource

1548
00:39:57,239 --> 00:39:58,320
utilization.

1549
00:39:58,519 --> 00:40:00,739
Cultural fit, learning mindset,

1550
00:40:00,739 --> 00:40:03,179
curiosity, accountability, team

1551
00:40:03,219 --> 00:40:05,650
collaboration, and work ethic.

1552
00:40:06,519 --> 00:40:07,619
These are just things you want to

1553
00:40:07,619 --> 00:40:08,760
get yourself boxed off.

1554
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:10,309
You want to craft your questions

1555
00:40:10,309 --> 00:40:11,920
around all of these sort of topics

1556
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,460
here so that you can at least kind

1557
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:15,139
of start ticking these boxes.

1558
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:19,639
Again, someone scores 90 to 100,

1559
00:40:19,639 --> 00:40:20,860
like hire them immediately.

1560
00:40:21,039 --> 00:40:23,340
Anyone 75 to 89, they're strong

1561
00:40:23,349 --> 00:40:24,210
candidate.

1562
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:25,530
Like the training's not going to

1563
00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:26,760
be super intense with them.

1564
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:27,900
They're most likely a really

1565
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:28,539
strong fit.

1566
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:30,579
60 to 70 poor, they're going to

1567
00:40:30,579 --> 00:40:31,889
require more training.

1568
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:33,449
You're going to have to give them

1569
00:40:33,449 --> 00:40:34,860
like a little bit of extra.

1570
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:35,639
You're going to have to give them

1571
00:40:35,719 --> 00:40:36,519
some serious handholding, to be

1572
00:40:36,519 --> 00:40:37,079
honest with you.

1573
00:40:37,519 --> 00:40:39,000
I would say 90 to 100, you're

1574
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,340
looking at, you know, two weeks,

1575
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:41,280
they're going to be up and

1576
00:40:41,289 --> 00:40:41,860
running.

1577
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:43,610
75 to 89, they're going to be

1578
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:45,070
anywhere between two to three,

1579
00:40:45,079 --> 00:40:46,460
four weeks up and running.

1580
00:40:46,639 --> 00:40:49,050
60 to 74, you could be looking at,

1581
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:51,079
you know, six, eight weeks until

1582
00:40:51,079 --> 00:40:53,239
they're properly up and running.

1583
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,380
Below 60s, like do not hire.

1584
00:40:55,510 --> 00:40:56,519
Like they're a high risk of

1585
00:40:56,519 --> 00:40:57,079
failure.

1586
00:40:57,159 --> 00:40:58,420
Like just continue your search.

1587
00:40:58,599 --> 00:41:00,869
Like no one should settle for less

1588
00:41:00,869 --> 00:41:02,960
than like a six out of ten.

1589
00:41:03,090 --> 00:41:03,739
Like just don't.

1590
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:04,900
It doesn't matter how desperate

1591
00:41:04,909 --> 00:41:05,320
you are.

1592
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:07,760
I really cannot stress that

1593
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:08,360
enough.

1594
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,929
If you hire the wrong CSM, you've

1595
00:41:09,949 --> 00:41:11,340
completely like fucked up your

1596
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:12,139
business.

1597
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:14,599
Because if your clients end up,

1598
00:41:14,599 --> 00:41:16,949
even if they're a bad CSM, build a

1599
00:41:16,949 --> 00:41:18,050
good relationship with that

1600
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:18,400
person.

1601
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:19,969
And that CSM leaves, that client

1602
00:41:19,989 --> 00:41:21,340
is then going to feel like, I

1603
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:22,920
don't want to, I might not want to

1604
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:23,579
be here.

1605
00:41:23,659 --> 00:41:25,219
It can generally cause churn.

1606
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:27,199
It can mess up your backend

1607
00:41:27,199 --> 00:41:28,139
revenue.

1608
00:41:28,219 --> 00:41:29,230
It can mess up your current

1609
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:29,760
revenue.

1610
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:32,079
And then it's like, no one likes

1611
00:41:32,119 --> 00:41:34,050
being in the midst of their

1612
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:35,909
business, trying to run it.

1613
00:41:36,219 --> 00:41:37,050
And all of a sudden they have no

1614
00:41:37,050 --> 00:41:37,940
one there to take onboarding

1615
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:38,309
calls.

1616
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:39,679
And you then have to go back and

1617
00:41:39,679 --> 00:41:41,139
take all these onboarding calls

1618
00:41:41,139 --> 00:41:41,480
on.

1619
00:41:41,559 --> 00:41:42,559
And then that client

1620
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:44,460
communication, then they feel like

1621
00:41:44,579 --> 00:41:46,199
they can always go to you, the

1622
00:41:46,199 --> 00:41:47,679
founder of the company, for all

1623
00:41:47,679 --> 00:41:49,340
this constant communication and

1624
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:50,789
next steps and next tasks and

1625
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:51,849
things like that.

1626
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,309
And you're going to have to end up

1627
00:41:53,309 --> 00:41:54,460
doing that until you find a

1628
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:55,250
replacement.

1629
00:41:55,409 --> 00:41:56,800
Like, it's a serious role that you

1630
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,260
cannot fuck around with and doing

1631
00:41:58,309 --> 00:41:58,840
wrong.

1632
00:42:01,019 --> 00:42:01,300
Okay.

1633
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:05,019
Implementation framework.

1634
00:42:05,099 --> 00:42:06,639
So, this is what you're going to

1635
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:07,699
first want to do.

1636
00:42:07,829 --> 00:42:09,829
Job posting, create a detailed job

1637
00:42:09,829 --> 00:42:11,309
specific scorecard.

1638
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:12,889
There'll be one linked below in

1639
00:42:12,909 --> 00:42:13,719
this video.

1640
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:16,639
Post industry specific job boards.

1641
00:42:16,719 --> 00:42:18,090
So, you know, Indeed, LinkedIn,

1642
00:42:18,090 --> 00:42:19,239
things like that as well.

1643
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,639
Even push some ad spend behind it

1644
00:42:20,639 --> 00:42:20,980
too.

1645
00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:23,059
You can also reach out to a hiring

1646
00:42:23,059 --> 00:42:24,280
agency as well.

1647
00:42:24,449 --> 00:42:25,719
Just make sure that the hiring

1648
00:42:25,719 --> 00:42:27,260
agency is getting talent that have

1649
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:28,639
really good English.

1650
00:42:28,719 --> 00:42:30,309
You can try and reach out to some

1651
00:42:30,309 --> 00:42:32,219
CSM networks and communities.

1652
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:33,460
I would always also recommend

1653
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:34,960
asking, like, if you are inside of

1654
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:36,579
Client Ascension Slack, asking the

1655
00:42:36,739 --> 00:42:38,159
Opportunities channel.

1656
00:42:38,219 --> 00:42:39,320
You can reach out to me.

1657
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:40,489
You can reach out to some of the

1658
00:42:40,489 --> 00:42:41,159
other CSMs.

1659
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:43,289
You can reach out to a variety of

1660
00:42:43,289 --> 00:42:44,380
different people.

1661
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:45,800
Ask your network, really,

1662
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:46,599
essentially.

1663
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:48,360
Screen applications using the

1664
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:49,639
experience matrix.

1665
00:42:49,809 --> 00:42:51,239
Initial interviews, you want to

1666
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:53,280
keep them up to about 30 minutes.

1667
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:55,820
30 to 60 minutes.

1668
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:57,230
I've oftentimes had calls with

1669
00:42:57,230 --> 00:42:58,989
CSMs for about 60 minutes because

1670
00:42:58,989 --> 00:43:00,530
we just end up getting really deep

1671
00:43:00,530 --> 00:43:01,119
into it.

1672
00:43:01,199 --> 00:43:02,460
So, make sure you add that, like,

1673
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:03,719
extra 30-minute buffer time

1674
00:43:03,719 --> 00:43:04,940
because it's just in case.

1675
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:07,159
Complete assessment scorecard.

1676
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:08,869
Check references if they have

1677
00:43:08,869 --> 00:43:09,360
some.

1678
00:43:09,429 --> 00:43:11,079
Evaluate cultural fit.

1679
00:43:11,659 --> 00:43:13,079
Again, people skip this step a lot

1680
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:14,639
of checking the references.

1681
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:16,179
Always check your references.

1682
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:19,739
Top candidates.

1683
00:43:19,869 --> 00:43:21,110
Then I would give them some sort

1684
00:43:21,110 --> 00:43:22,519
of mock call scenario to do.

1685
00:43:22,599 --> 00:43:23,090
Some tasks.

1686
00:43:23,179 --> 00:43:24,119
Some assignment to do.

1687
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:25,210
Something that they can do

1688
00:43:25,230 --> 00:43:26,440
themselves at home to kind of

1689
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:27,829
really show how more proficient

1690
00:43:27,829 --> 00:43:29,300
they are in terms of the role.

1691
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:31,039
And then I would set them up with

1692
00:43:31,039 --> 00:43:32,769
either a current CSM or another

1693
00:43:32,809 --> 00:43:34,480
founder or someone within the

1694
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:36,519
company to vibe check them to see

1695
00:43:36,519 --> 00:43:38,159
if they are good team fit.

1696
00:43:38,579 --> 00:43:39,909
And then a final decision then

1697
00:43:39,909 --> 00:43:41,480
based on scorecard and practical

1698
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:42,360
performance.

1699
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:43,500
You're going to want to go through

1700
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:44,809
that homework, that assessment, or

1701
00:43:44,809 --> 00:43:45,519
that mock call.

1702
00:43:45,579 --> 00:43:46,760
The mock call can also, by the

1703
00:43:46,769 --> 00:43:47,820
way, be a loom video.

1704
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:48,920
Like, you don't actually have to

1705
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:49,760
get on a second call and run a

1706
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:50,099
mock.

1707
00:43:50,639 --> 00:43:51,440
You just want to give them a

1708
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:52,659
scenario and say, like, record me

1709
00:43:52,659 --> 00:43:53,719
a loom of how you would actually

1710
00:43:53,719 --> 00:43:54,730
handle this situation.

1711
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,320
And then finally, a founder

1712
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:57,920
interview, whether that was you

1713
00:43:57,969 --> 00:43:59,760
again or another founder, whatever

1714
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,280
your situation might be.

1715
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:03,110
Have that final interview where

1716
00:44:03,110 --> 00:44:04,920
you can make an offer and maybe,

1717
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:07,190
in some cases, negotiate on price.

1718
00:44:07,329 --> 00:44:08,619
And then onboarding.

1719
00:44:08,679 --> 00:44:10,690
So you're going to start 14-day

1720
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:12,429
intensive training, shadow

1721
00:44:12,429 --> 00:44:14,559
experienced CSMs if you have CSMs,

1722
00:44:14,630 --> 00:44:15,719
complete supervised client

1723
00:44:15,769 --> 00:44:16,909
interaction, and a regular

1724
00:44:16,909 --> 00:44:18,519
check-ins performance feedback.

1725
00:44:19,579 --> 00:44:20,989
New CSMs should achieve 70%

1726
00:44:20,989 --> 00:44:22,460
effectiveness score within the

1727
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:23,820
first 90 days of hire.

1728
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:24,889
They should be comfortable

1729
00:44:24,929 --> 00:44:26,420
onboarding clients, taking client

1730
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:27,530
monthly meetings, having

1731
00:44:27,530 --> 00:44:29,190
check-ins, completing on time, and

1732
00:44:29,190 --> 00:44:30,250
then have a really strong

1733
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:31,679
understanding of the product and

1734
00:44:31,679 --> 00:44:32,429
the service.

1735
00:44:33,489 --> 00:44:35,199
You know, practical exercise

1736
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:37,219
design is going to be, like, mock

1737
00:44:37,219 --> 00:44:39,409
calls, renewal conversations with

1738
00:44:39,409 --> 00:44:41,360
dissatisfied clients, analyze

1739
00:44:41,369 --> 00:44:43,480
client usage, data risk, identify

1740
00:44:43,559 --> 00:44:44,519
risk factors.

1741
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:46,130
So, in other words, like, what are

1742
00:44:46,130 --> 00:44:47,300
clients doing that are going to

1743
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:48,579
eventually cause a stress point

1744
00:44:48,590 --> 00:44:49,809
that's going to make them want to

1745
00:44:49,849 --> 00:44:50,380
churn?

1746
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:52,599
You know, creation of a success

1747
00:44:52,670 --> 00:44:54,420
plan for a new client.

1748
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:56,639
Reference questions, how did they

1749
00:44:56,710 --> 00:44:59,139
handle difficult conversations?

1750
00:44:59,219 --> 00:45:00,199
What is retention rate?

1751
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:01,699
Things like that there, too.

1752
00:45:02,329 --> 00:45:04,099
You know, how are they handling

1753
00:45:04,099 --> 00:45:05,710
competing properties?

1754
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:07,230
How are systems processes that

1755
00:45:07,230 --> 00:45:08,019
they improve?

1756
00:45:08,199 --> 00:45:09,719
Like, you know, again, go to CSM.

1757
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:10,769
They'll be able to actually

1758
00:45:10,769 --> 00:45:12,159
improve your process a lot more.

1759
00:45:12,329 --> 00:45:15,139
So, final recommendation.

1760
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:16,420
Building a successful customer

1761
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:17,690
success team starts with hiring

1762
00:45:17,690 --> 00:45:18,869
the right people and using the

1763
00:45:18,869 --> 00:45:19,460
right process.

1764
00:45:19,739 --> 00:45:20,900
By implementing this strategic

1765
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:22,260
framework, you'll not only reduce

1766
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:23,500
costs, turnover, but you'll

1767
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:24,929
accelerate your team's impact, and

1768
00:45:24,929 --> 00:45:26,110
you'll actually make a massive

1769
00:45:26,119 --> 00:45:26,449
ROI.

1770
00:45:26,739 --> 00:45:27,539
Okay, guys.

1771
00:45:27,719 --> 00:45:28,760
Sorry this video was long.

1772
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:29,900
It's quite in-depth.

1773
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:31,789
But reach out to me.

1774
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:33,119
The next module is going to be how

1775
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:34,380
to onboard your next CSM.

1776
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:34,900
Take care.
