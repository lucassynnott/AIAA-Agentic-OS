1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,660
All right, so the onboarding call.

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:06,099
This is like the last piece of

3
00:00:06,099 --> 00:00:10,130
onboarding a new client and this

4
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:11,929
might not apply to everyone, but

5
00:00:11,929 --> 00:00:13,789
if it makes sense to offer an

6
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:15,800
onboarding call, I highly

7
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,160
recommend that you do this and you

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,379
implement it.

9
00:00:19,449 --> 00:00:21,109
So basically, when you first sign

10
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:23,210
a client, you get to sign service

11
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:25,120
agreement, you collect payment,

12
00:00:25,269 --> 00:00:26,500
you get them into all the

13
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:28,620
different professional workspaces

14
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:30,059
that you have set up.

15
00:00:30,089 --> 00:00:31,940
And then once they're onboarded

16
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:33,969
into the different workspaces and

17
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,009
they have all the materials filled

18
00:00:36,009 --> 00:00:37,969
out, like the onboarding form,

19
00:00:37,969 --> 00:00:38,560
right?

20
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:39,609
We want them to submit the

21
00:00:39,609 --> 00:00:40,509
onboarding form.

22
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:42,679
We want them to do those tasks

23
00:00:42,679 --> 00:00:43,439
first.

24
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:45,090
We just want to make sure that you

25
00:00:45,189 --> 00:00:47,049
as the agency has everything they

26
00:00:47,049 --> 00:00:48,320
need to begin work.

27
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,390
And then the last step is getting

28
00:00:50,869 --> 00:00:52,560
on the onboarding call.

29
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:55,579
The onboarding call is key for so

30
00:00:55,579 --> 00:00:58,189
many different reasons.

31
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:00,390
The first reason the onboarding

32
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:02,570
key is so important to conduct is

33
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:04,650
because it allows you to build

34
00:01:04,659 --> 00:01:07,579
credibility with your client and

35
00:01:07,579 --> 00:01:09,750
to start the relationship off on

36
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,099
the right track.

37
00:01:11,409 --> 00:01:13,150
Like, think about if you're a

38
00:01:13,219 --> 00:01:14,909
client, you want to be able to

39
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:16,750
meet the people and interact in

40
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:18,459
like a live way with the people

41
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:20,349
who are working on this project

42
00:01:20,349 --> 00:01:21,180
for you.

43
00:01:21,209 --> 00:01:22,829
So by getting on the onboarding

44
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:24,530
call and doing it through Zoom

45
00:01:24,629 --> 00:01:26,290
with your camera on, you get to

46
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:28,180
spend some quality time with your

47
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:29,719
new client and they get to see

48
00:01:29,719 --> 00:01:31,519
your face and they get to interact

49
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:34,040
with you, which really helps build

50
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,359
credibility and also give the

51
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:38,900
client, you know, reassurance that

52
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,900
they are in good hands working

53
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:42,090
with you.

54
00:01:42,129 --> 00:01:44,359
So the onboarding call is like

55
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:46,719
really important to establish

56
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:49,159
yourself, uh, or to, sorry,

57
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:51,790
establish the relationship and to

58
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:54,129
build that level of trust right

59
00:01:54,129 --> 00:01:54,920
away.

60
00:01:55,069 --> 00:01:56,219
So that's the first thing.

61
00:01:56,329 --> 00:01:58,239
The other thing the onboarding

62
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:00,349
call is super useful for is, uh,

63
00:02:00,349 --> 00:02:01,930
to clear any confusion or

64
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:03,370
questions, right?

65
00:02:03,409 --> 00:02:05,049
So I'm sure like when you're

66
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:07,459
overloading your clients with an

67
00:02:07,459 --> 00:02:09,780
onboarding form and an onboarding

68
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,020
payment in a Slack workspace and a

69
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:14,060
Trello board, there's going to be

70
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:15,060
some questions.

71
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:15,960
There always is.

72
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:17,629
Um, and rather than going through

73
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:19,710
Slack and doing back and forth

74
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,590
that way, uh, the onboarding call

75
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:23,530
is a great opportunity for your

76
00:02:23,669 --> 00:02:25,409
clients to ask those important

77
00:02:25,409 --> 00:02:27,379
questions that are on their mind.

78
00:02:27,409 --> 00:02:29,069
And the less questions your client

79
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:31,560
has, or, uh, as long as all the,

80
00:02:31,569 --> 00:02:33,550
the questions your client has are

81
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:35,870
answered, you're, you're in a good

82
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:37,550
spot, uh, with that client

83
00:02:37,729 --> 00:02:38,960
relationship.

84
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:41,000
So you, it's, it's a platform for

85
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:43,009
your client to ask questions and

86
00:02:43,009 --> 00:02:44,819
get answers in real time.

87
00:02:44,849 --> 00:02:46,250
And then the other thing, the

88
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,840
benefit for you, uh, you know,

89
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,719
these are all benefits obviously,

90
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:51,520
because it's working in your favor

91
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,520
longterm for building trust, uh,

92
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:54,900
which, you know, will have a

93
00:02:55,169 --> 00:02:57,129
direct effect on retaining these

94
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:57,360
clients.

95
00:02:57,409 --> 00:02:58,879
Longer than if you did not do an

96
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,620
onboarding call and, and, and if

97
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,240
you did not establish that level

98
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,939
of trust in the very beginning.

99
00:03:03,969 --> 00:03:05,590
Um, but some of the other things

100
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:05,889
that.

101
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:07,729
The onboarding call is useful for

102
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:09,400
us collecting information or

103
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,780
getting more clarity.

104
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:12,180
So the reason why it's so

105
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,139
important for clients to fill out

106
00:03:14,229 --> 00:03:15,780
the onboarding form and to go

107
00:03:15,819 --> 00:03:17,930
through all of those tasks, uh,

108
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:19,340
that we talked about, like

109
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:21,050
onboarding onto your professional

110
00:03:21,139 --> 00:03:22,580
workspaces, like with Trello and

111
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:23,000
Slack.

112
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:24,900
Um, and filling out the onboarding

113
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,539
form is because it gives you the

114
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:28,110
opportunity to review all of that

115
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:29,969
information and see what other

116
00:03:29,969 --> 00:03:31,460
information might I need?

117
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:32,610
Or what questions do I have?

118
00:03:32,729 --> 00:03:32,960
Right?

119
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:34,560
So like, for example, they fill

120
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,879
out the onboarding form and

121
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:37,389
they're telling you about their

122
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,409
target market and you're not

123
00:03:39,409 --> 00:03:41,599
really, you know, clear on it.

124
00:03:41,629 --> 00:03:42,780
You get on the onboarding call and

125
00:03:42,969 --> 00:03:44,009
you could talk through that and

126
00:03:44,009 --> 00:03:45,219
you could record the onboarding

127
00:03:45,219 --> 00:03:45,699
call.

128
00:03:45,729 --> 00:03:47,069
So it's all documented and then

129
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:48,509
you could just take notes and add

130
00:03:48,509 --> 00:03:49,830
that to the onboarding form as

131
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:51,210
like an attachment rather than

132
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:52,740
trying to explain yourself, uh,

133
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:54,379
back and forth through Slack.

134
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:55,580
Same thing with their offer.

135
00:03:55,729 --> 00:03:56,849
If you don't fully understand

136
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:58,300
their offer or maybe they filled

137
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,710
out the onboarding form the wrong

138
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:01,110
way or misinterpreted one of your

139
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:02,199
questions, right?

140
00:04:02,229 --> 00:04:03,740
The onboarding call is like a

141
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,550
workshop call in that sense, uh,

142
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:07,159
where you could collect more

143
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:08,960
information or get clarity on the

144
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,900
information that they provided.

145
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:12,689
And even, uh, and, and other use

146
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:14,520
cases, like a lot of the times,

147
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,399
uh, for our service, we require,

148
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,970
uh, LinkedIn logins from our

149
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:18,779
client.

150
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:21,100
And a lot of the times they either

151
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,500
don't provide a login or the login

152
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,860
credentials are not correct.

153
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:27,500
Or I go to log in and I'm hit with

154
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,990
one of those like two factor

155
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:30,759
authentications, right?

156
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:32,420
And it's a pain in the ass to sync

157
00:04:32,509 --> 00:04:34,439
up with the client, uh, at the

158
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:36,699
same time they're available to,

159
00:04:36,699 --> 00:04:39,459
uh, to get into their accounts.

160
00:04:39,569 --> 00:04:41,000
So what we do is like right on the

161
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,689
onboarding calls say, Hey, by the

162
00:04:42,689 --> 00:04:44,259
way, you know, you gave us your

163
00:04:44,259 --> 00:04:46,259
LinkedIn login, but I got hit with

164
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:47,379
this two factor authentication.

165
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:49,029
You know, while we have you on the

166
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:50,420
call, do you mind if I log in

167
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:52,040
right now and you just check your

168
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,300
phone real quick for the code?

169
00:04:53,329 --> 00:04:54,949
And then we, you know, get that

170
00:04:54,949 --> 00:04:56,569
taken care of and put away.

171
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:58,050
And we'll do that a lot of the

172
00:04:58,050 --> 00:04:58,589
times.

173
00:04:58,629 --> 00:05:00,449
Um, so the onboarding call is

174
00:05:00,449 --> 00:05:02,509
super useful, uh, for all these

175
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,509
different reasons, but just to

176
00:05:04,509 --> 00:05:06,910
take a step back, I want to break

177
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:08,360
down the way we conduct our

178
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,139
onboarding calls.

179
00:05:09,569 --> 00:05:11,149
So that you can, uh, create a

180
00:05:11,149 --> 00:05:12,889
structure for yourself as well,

181
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:14,610
because having a structure on

182
00:05:14,899 --> 00:05:17,110
these calls is, is so important.

183
00:05:17,149 --> 00:05:18,810
Uh, again, you want to lead your

184
00:05:19,269 --> 00:05:19,839
clients.

185
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:22,410
You want to direct them on

186
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:24,050
everything.

187
00:05:24,089 --> 00:05:25,689
Like they hired you as the expert.

188
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:27,370
So you want to use opportunities

189
00:05:27,509 --> 00:05:29,060
like the onboarding call to

190
00:05:29,149 --> 00:05:30,970
present yourself as the expert in

191
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:31,779
the room.

192
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:33,250
So the way we like to do

193
00:05:33,269 --> 00:05:35,610
onboarding calls is really in, uh,

194
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:37,490
like three or four different

195
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:38,310
phases.

196
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:40,360
So the part one, and, and they're

197
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:41,670
not long calls too.

198
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:42,860
Like it's not a huge time

199
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:43,439
investment.

200
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:45,750
Some, some of them will go longer,

201
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:47,810
but we really like pencil in 30

202
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:49,870
minutes, uh, for the call and we

203
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:50,660
do it through zoom.

204
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:52,870
Um, so, you know, it is face to

205
00:05:52,949 --> 00:05:54,720
face at least most of the time.

206
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:57,290
Um, but it's like a 30 to 45

207
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,560
minute thing.

208
00:05:58,589 --> 00:05:59,980
Usually sometimes it's a little

209
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:00,720
bit shorter.

210
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,180
Sometimes it's a little bit

211
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:02,759
longer.

212
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:04,490
It just depends on the flow and

213
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,639
how many people are on the call

214
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,490
from the client side and how many

215
00:06:08,649 --> 00:06:10,180
questions they have and, you know,

216
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:11,379
how detailed they want to get.

217
00:06:11,689 --> 00:06:13,019
But you really only need to do a

218
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:14,980
lot, 30 minutes most of the time.

219
00:06:15,009 --> 00:06:16,920
So back to the agenda.

220
00:06:17,069 --> 00:06:18,980
So the agenda of, uh, the

221
00:06:19,189 --> 00:06:21,670
onboarding calls is the first part

222
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:23,220
introductions.

223
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,259
So for the most, most of the time,

224
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:27,079
it's going to be the first time

225
00:06:27,129 --> 00:06:29,139
you're meeting your client.

226
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:30,569
But I guess for some of you,

227
00:06:30,569 --> 00:06:32,339
you're running solo agencies and

228
00:06:32,339 --> 00:06:34,100
you're also taking your own sales

229
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:34,699
calls.

230
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:36,220
So you might've already met your

231
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:37,720
client face to face, like on the

232
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,540
sales calls.

233
00:06:38,569 --> 00:06:40,879
But for our agency, uh, since Dan

234
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:42,970
is doing all the sales calls and

235
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:45,259
Christian and myself, Andre are on

236
00:06:45,259 --> 00:06:46,899
the backend doing fulfillment.

237
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:48,449
It's the first time that Christian

238
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:49,899
and I are meeting the clients and

239
00:06:49,899 --> 00:06:51,240
the same for the clients.

240
00:06:51,269 --> 00:06:52,639
The first time they're seeing

241
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,259
Christian and I, and they they've

242
00:06:54,259 --> 00:06:55,829
seen Dan and they've talked to him

243
00:06:55,829 --> 00:06:57,160
on the sales call, but it's a

244
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,790
completely different, uh, role

245
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:00,740
he's playing now, Dan, Dan, like

246
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,430
what's your role in the client

247
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:03,899
fulfillment process?

248
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:05,579
Like what does the client go to

249
00:07:05,649 --> 00:07:07,250
Dan for at this point in the

250
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:08,519
relationship?

251
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:10,980
So basically, regardless of, of

252
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:12,949
how you got to that point, you

253
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:15,360
want to introduce them or

254
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,220
introduce yourselves in your job

255
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:18,769
roles for this person.

256
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:20,069
Now that they are officially a

257
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:20,939
client, right?

258
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:23,100
So you're out of the sales, uh,

259
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,939
you're out of like the sales

260
00:07:24,939 --> 00:07:26,899
portion of, uh, the work and

261
00:07:26,899 --> 00:07:28,019
you're into the fulfillment

262
00:07:28,069 --> 00:07:28,519
portion.

263
00:07:28,589 --> 00:07:30,220
So you do introductions in the

264
00:07:30,709 --> 00:07:31,139
beginning.

265
00:07:31,269 --> 00:07:32,420
So like the way we'll do it is,

266
00:07:32,629 --> 00:07:33,839
Hey, you know, client, the way

267
00:07:33,949 --> 00:07:35,129
this works is we'll just, you

268
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:36,589
know, in the beginning, we'll do

269
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:37,410
introductions.

270
00:07:37,449 --> 00:07:38,829
So you get to know like who's on

271
00:07:38,829 --> 00:07:39,910
our team and what we're

272
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:41,019
responsible for.

273
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:42,480
So, you know, who to reach out to

274
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,110
specifically, uh, when you, when

275
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:45,240
you have questions.

276
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:46,860
And then once we go through

277
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:49,259
introductions, we're going to, uh,

278
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:50,889
do a screen share of our Trello

279
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:52,829
board, uh, and basically show you

280
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:54,519
where everything is and what we've

281
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:56,019
been working on so far and, and

282
00:07:56,129 --> 00:07:57,350
ask if you have any questions.

283
00:07:57,790 --> 00:07:59,379
And then at the end of the call,

284
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:01,110
we'll open it up for questions and

285
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:02,879
we'll also let you know, you know,

286
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,750
what needs to be done, uh, next to

287
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,459
launch campaigns and what happens

288
00:08:06,709 --> 00:08:08,459
when campaigns are launched.

289
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:08,639
Right.

290
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:10,310
So this is a little bit specific

291
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,490
for our lead gen agency.

292
00:08:12,629 --> 00:08:14,100
It'll be different for really

293
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,899
every agency, but the framework's

294
00:08:15,899 --> 00:08:16,939
really the same.

295
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:17,959
So it's introductions in the

296
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:18,519
beginning.

297
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,449
You want to introduce yourself,

298
00:08:20,509 --> 00:08:21,360
who you are.

299
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:23,810
And when I say introduce yourself,

300
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:25,810
like tell the client what your

301
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:27,560
role is going forward.

302
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:29,680
Like, what are you going to be

303
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:31,740
doing in relation to what they

304
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:32,750
signed on for?

305
00:08:33,029 --> 00:08:35,009
So when they do, they sign our

306
00:08:35,149 --> 00:08:37,190
clients sign on for lead gen.

307
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,418
So when I introduce myself on the

308
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:42,009
calls, uh, I'm telling the client,

309
00:08:42,009 --> 00:08:44,250
Hey, like I, uh, am the one that's

310
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:45,899
kind of crafting the overall lead

311
00:08:45,909 --> 00:08:47,559
gen strategy for our clients.

312
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:50,110
And I also, uh, am the one that's

313
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:52,250
working on the targeting in the

314
00:08:52,379 --> 00:08:54,500
leads list for our campaign.

315
00:08:54,529 --> 00:08:56,500
So if you have any questions or

316
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:58,679
additional information when it

317
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,100
comes to, uh, strategy and target

318
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:02,970
market or just targeting in

319
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:04,789
general, that's what I'm

320
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,200
responsible for.

321
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:07,240
Then Christian will go and

322
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,590
Christian will be like, Hey, I'm

323
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:09,740
the creative director at the

324
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:10,299
agency.

325
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:11,970
So what that means, uh, for you is

326
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:13,480
that I'm writing all of your

327
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,159
scripts.

328
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:16,440
So all the messages we're sending

329
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,960
out are, uh, being written by me.

330
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:19,740
So if you have any

331
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,370
recommendations, feedback, or

332
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:22,700
suggestions when it comes to

333
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,460
scripting and messaging, you could

334
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:25,559
come to me for that.

335
00:09:25,629 --> 00:09:27,220
And then Dan will go on and he'll

336
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,950
say, Hey, you know, I'm really

337
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:30,029
just a sales guy.

338
00:09:30,129 --> 00:09:31,769
So, you know, once you get on

339
00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:33,799
sales calls or once you get leads

340
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:35,789
in your pipeline, if you need any

341
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,679
help or have any questions on how

342
00:09:37,809 --> 00:09:39,370
to make the most of the leads

343
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,409
we're generating for you, you

344
00:09:41,409 --> 00:09:42,759
know, just give me a, give me a

345
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:43,200
shout.

346
00:09:43,309 --> 00:09:44,950
And I'd be happy to consult you

347
00:09:45,049 --> 00:09:46,990
and just give you some overall

348
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:49,139
direction on, on how to handle the

349
00:09:49,149 --> 00:09:51,330
sales process at your business.

350
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:53,090
Uh, so then they have a very clear

351
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:55,269
understanding of who to go to for

352
00:09:55,269 --> 00:09:57,299
what, uh, which, which is great

353
00:09:57,299 --> 00:09:59,330
because there's full clarity on,

354
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:00,620
on who our team is.

355
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:02,320
And they see that we have our shit

356
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,870
together and that we have all the

357
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:04,840
bases covered.

358
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:06,309
And then of course, like if you

359
00:10:06,309 --> 00:10:07,889
have a project manager or a client

360
00:10:07,889 --> 00:10:09,200
success manager or an inbox

361
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,799
manager, you could explain that

362
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:12,120
person in their role.

363
00:10:12,149 --> 00:10:13,269
They don't necessarily have to be

364
00:10:13,289 --> 00:10:14,299
on the onboarding call.

365
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:16,179
I think the onboarding call is

366
00:10:16,179 --> 00:10:17,799
just important for the founders

367
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:19,419
and the partners and the C-level

368
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:20,659
guys to be on the call.

369
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:21,809
But if you want to have other

370
00:10:22,049 --> 00:10:23,600
members from your team that are

371
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,279
pitching into this project on the

372
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:27,009
call, you know, you could do that

373
00:10:27,019 --> 00:10:27,399
too.

374
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:29,049
Something to consider.

375
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:30,799
And then after you introduce

376
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:32,529
yourself and your team, you'll

377
00:10:32,629 --> 00:10:34,080
want to turn it over to your

378
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,690
client and you, because the

379
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:37,559
onboarding call is not going to be

380
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:39,529
scheduled immediately after they

381
00:10:39,539 --> 00:10:40,269
sign on.

382
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:40,980
Usually, right.

383
00:10:41,049 --> 00:10:42,200
It's not going to be like the next

384
00:10:42,409 --> 00:10:43,500
day because they have in it, in

385
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:43,860
it.

386
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:44,899
Sometimes it can be.

387
00:10:44,929 --> 00:10:46,419
Um, but a lot of times what you'll

388
00:10:46,419 --> 00:10:47,490
find is you'll sign.

389
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:48,690
They take a little bit to like

390
00:10:48,929 --> 00:10:49,840
review the contract.

391
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:51,490
They take a little bit to pay the

392
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:52,759
onboarding fee.

393
00:10:52,789 --> 00:10:53,940
They take a little bit to get

394
00:10:54,149 --> 00:10:55,500
onboarded to all your different

395
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,980
professional workspaces.

396
00:10:57,029 --> 00:10:58,110
They take a little bit to go

397
00:10:58,110 --> 00:10:59,480
through the onboarding form and

398
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,889
then they schedule an onboarding

399
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,379
call.

400
00:11:01,409 --> 00:11:02,850
So the onboarding call is like a

401
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:04,279
little bit after that initial

402
00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:05,039
sales call.

403
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:06,690
Uh, so what we like to do is like,

404
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:08,500
Hey, you know, if you could real

405
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,000
quick, I know you filled out a ton

406
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,600
of information.

407
00:11:10,629 --> 00:11:11,659
In the onboarding form.

408
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:12,700
And we learned all about your

409
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:13,840
business on the sales call.

410
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:15,149
But if you could just give us a

411
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:16,629
quick intro to who you are, what

412
00:11:16,629 --> 00:11:18,019
your role is, the company, who

413
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,470
else might be involved in this

414
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:22,070
project specifically, uh, and

415
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:23,370
where you're at as a company.

416
00:11:23,509 --> 00:11:25,129
And then more importantly, what

417
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,809
you're looking to get out of this

418
00:11:26,809 --> 00:11:28,549
question or this portion is what

419
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:30,480
are your goals and working with

420
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:30,899
us?

421
00:11:30,929 --> 00:11:32,549
What are you hoping to accomplish?

422
00:11:33,029 --> 00:11:33,320
Right?

423
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:35,210
So we talked about this a little

424
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:36,889
bit in the onboarding form about

425
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:38,639
how we should be asking, uh, at

426
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:40,460
the end of our onboarding forms,

427
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:42,240
like what are their goals and what

428
00:11:42,389 --> 00:11:43,809
do they hope to accomplish by

429
00:11:43,889 --> 00:11:45,460
working with our agency?

430
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:47,350
So if you want to reiterate that

431
00:11:47,809 --> 00:11:49,950
on the onboarding call, um, so you

432
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:52,029
want, this is going to allow you

433
00:11:52,029 --> 00:11:54,279
to align yourself with their goals

434
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:56,289
and to also set expectations,

435
00:11:56,289 --> 00:11:57,139
right?

436
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,889
So if their goals are way out

437
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:01,440
there, you could set expectations

438
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:03,879
properly on the onboarding call.

439
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:07,509
Because the only way clients leave

440
00:12:07,509 --> 00:12:10,269
you or, uh, or churn for that

441
00:12:10,269 --> 00:12:13,500
matter is when expectations do not

442
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,200
meet reality.

443
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:18,169
That's the only time you'll ever

444
00:12:18,169 --> 00:12:20,700
run into stress or negative

445
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:23,580
feedback from your clients.

446
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:25,269
And it's the only time you'll ever

447
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:27,490
potentially lose a client is when

448
00:12:27,539 --> 00:12:29,460
reality does not, or when, when

449
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:31,629
expectations do not meet reality.

450
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:34,169
And obviously that happens a lot

451
00:12:34,309 --> 00:12:36,129
because not all of this is fully

452
00:12:36,129 --> 00:12:38,299
predictable, um, and not always

453
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:40,210
expectations can be met, but if

454
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:42,409
expectations are not set or fully

455
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:44,659
understood from day one, you never

456
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:46,500
give yourself a chance.

457
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:48,190
So make sure to be on the same

458
00:12:48,259 --> 00:12:50,090
page in the beginning of this

459
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:52,129
onboarding call when it comes to

460
00:12:52,129 --> 00:12:54,320
your client's expectations.

461
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:56,590
So you give yourself the best

462
00:12:56,659 --> 00:12:58,600
chance to make them a reality and

463
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,570
in turn, uh, you know, satisfy

464
00:13:00,789 --> 00:13:02,519
your clients so that they stay on

465
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:04,690
with you, uh, and keep coming back

466
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:06,940
to, to give you guys business.

467
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:09,240
So that's, that's, that's, that's

468
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:10,860
super important when it comes to

469
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,419
introductions, ask your clients

470
00:13:12,679 --> 00:13:14,279
straight up, you know, what are

471
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:15,659
your goals and what are your

472
00:13:15,659 --> 00:13:17,480
expectations, uh, you know, with

473
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:18,559
working with us.

474
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:20,210
And that'll help you to make sure

475
00:13:20,289 --> 00:13:22,049
they're in line with, with what

476
00:13:22,049 --> 00:13:23,690
they can expect and, and what you

477
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:25,710
believe, uh, realistically you

478
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:27,230
could provide for them.

479
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:28,500
And, and, and, and that's that.

480
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:30,830
So once you do introductions, once

481
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:32,620
you get on the same page about

482
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,750
what's to be expected, uh, and,

483
00:13:34,789 --> 00:13:36,960
and, and really, uh, align with

484
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,080
goals for the relationship.

485
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:40,519
The next thing is to go through

486
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:41,289
like the roadmap.

487
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:43,129
So for us, we do lead gen and we

488
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:44,960
do, uh, we, there's a lot of

489
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,929
information when it comes to lead

490
00:13:46,929 --> 00:13:47,460
gen.

491
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:49,129
So really what we do is a screen

492
00:13:49,129 --> 00:13:51,309
share and we'll, we'll share them.

493
00:13:51,429 --> 00:13:52,750
Uh, we'll see, we'll share the

494
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:53,950
Trello board that we already

495
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:54,750
invited them to.

496
00:13:54,809 --> 00:13:56,230
Um, and we'll show them where they

497
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:57,370
could find everything.

498
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:58,929
So like login credentials for the

499
00:13:58,929 --> 00:14:00,019
cold email account and the

500
00:14:00,129 --> 00:14:01,600
LinkedIn account and the Calendly

501
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:02,299
account.

502
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:03,610
We show them where all that

503
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:04,820
information is.

504
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:06,490
And then really most, more

505
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:09,240
importantly, what we do, uh, on

506
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,720
the screen share is all go through

507
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,070
the leads list and I'll show them

508
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:14,340
where they could look at the leads

509
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,580
list and let them know that an

510
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:16,899
action item for them is to review

511
00:14:17,019 --> 00:14:18,610
the leads list and to approve it.

512
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:20,269
And then another action item or

513
00:14:20,269 --> 00:14:21,970
another thing we do is I'll pass

514
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:23,690
it over to Christian at this point

515
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,700
and say, Hey, you know, here's the

516
00:14:25,769 --> 00:14:27,320
scripts that we've written for

517
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:28,659
your campaigns.

518
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:29,840
Christian is going to read through

519
00:14:30,049 --> 00:14:31,539
them and then you guys can kind of

520
00:14:31,539 --> 00:14:33,620
brainstorm and collaborate on any

521
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:35,500
potential changes and feedback.

522
00:14:35,529 --> 00:14:36,679
So then we'll screen share the

523
00:14:36,889 --> 00:14:38,090
scripts that we wrote for this

524
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,639
specific client that are going to

525
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:40,970
be sent out through our Legion

526
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:41,769
campaigns.

527
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:42,950
Christian will read through them

528
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:44,399
and then the client will provide

529
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,120
us feedback.

530
00:14:45,149 --> 00:14:46,299
And most of the times they're

531
00:14:46,509 --> 00:14:47,700
like, oh, these are good.

532
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:48,620
Like we trust you.

533
00:14:48,649 --> 00:14:49,740
That's why we hired you.

534
00:14:49,769 --> 00:14:51,409
So, you know, you know, if these

535
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,409
work, you know best, you're the

536
00:14:53,409 --> 00:14:55,440
expert, you know, run with them.

537
00:14:55,509 --> 00:14:56,610
But some of the times like our

538
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:58,019
client will be like, oh, these are

539
00:14:58,019 --> 00:14:58,480
great.

540
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:00,029
But but we don't want to say that

541
00:15:00,029 --> 00:15:01,509
that's that's inaccurate or be

542
00:15:01,509 --> 00:15:02,419
careful there.

543
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:05,019
So it's good to lean on the client

544
00:15:05,019 --> 00:15:07,289
for feedback and approval on

545
00:15:07,289 --> 00:15:09,870
certain areas or certain things

546
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:12,149
throughout the process.

547
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:13,840
So we'll run them through the

548
00:15:14,309 --> 00:15:14,879
scripts.

549
00:15:14,909 --> 00:15:16,350
We'll run them through the list,

550
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:17,659
make sure they approve both of

551
00:15:17,659 --> 00:15:18,179
those.

552
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:19,580
And all of this is for

553
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:20,759
transparency.

554
00:15:20,909 --> 00:15:22,059
That's another thing that's

555
00:15:22,269 --> 00:15:23,600
working here in the background is

556
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,059
we're showing our clients that we

557
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:25,990
can be transparent.

558
00:15:26,389 --> 00:15:27,860
And when we be transparent with

559
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,700
our clients, we build more trust,

560
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,710
which is, again, like so

561
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:32,860
important.

562
00:15:32,889 --> 00:15:34,350
You have to have trust with your

563
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:34,899
client.

564
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:37,200
Your clients must trust you and

565
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,720
have confidence in your abilities

566
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,679
to get results for them.

567
00:15:41,789 --> 00:15:43,429
And this is all everything we've

568
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:45,330
talked about up to this point is

569
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:46,830
working towards that.

570
00:15:46,929 --> 00:15:48,399
That's what we're working towards.

571
00:15:48,429 --> 00:15:50,320
So after we do a screen share, we

572
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:52,139
show them some of the work we've

573
00:15:52,179 --> 00:15:53,899
done and basically get their

574
00:15:53,899 --> 00:15:55,100
feedback on it.

575
00:15:55,129 --> 00:15:56,620
We ask if they have any questions.

576
00:15:56,649 --> 00:15:56,860
Right.

577
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:58,850
So we like to stop in and see what

578
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:00,950
questions they might have about

579
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:02,799
the process or what questions they

580
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:04,200
might have had coming into the

581
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:05,559
onboarding call that we can

582
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:06,120
answer.

583
00:16:06,429 --> 00:16:07,909
If we need to do logins, we'll do

584
00:16:07,909 --> 00:16:09,120
those on the screen.

585
00:16:09,149 --> 00:16:11,289
A lot of times like we'll need to

586
00:16:11,289 --> 00:16:12,169
get them.

587
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:13,850
We will need their help getting

588
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:15,820
into their LinkedIn account in

589
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,289
their Calendly account.

590
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:18,639
So we'll do that on the screen

591
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:19,110
share.

592
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:21,870
And then after that, also on our

593
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:24,039
Trello board, we set up like a to

594
00:16:24,039 --> 00:16:26,519
do list in a completed task list.

595
00:16:26,549 --> 00:16:27,700
So we'll end on that and we'll

596
00:16:27,909 --> 00:16:29,289
say, OK, here's all the tasks

597
00:16:29,289 --> 00:16:30,940
we've completed for you so far.

598
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:32,519
And really, all that's left for us

599
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:33,480
to do is X, Y, Z.

600
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:35,549
And that's just letting them know

601
00:16:35,549 --> 00:16:37,000
like what else we'll be working on

602
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,509
and what else we need to get done.

603
00:16:38,649 --> 00:16:40,179
And then also what we need from

604
00:16:40,179 --> 00:16:40,669
them.

605
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:40,919
Right.

606
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:42,669
So like we need them to review the

607
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:44,220
leads list and we need them to

608
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,750
review the scripts and we need

609
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:47,720
them to provide the credentials

610
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,379
and make whatever else we need

611
00:16:49,629 --> 00:16:50,200
from them.

612
00:16:50,289 --> 00:16:53,080
We have to outline and make clear

613
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,879
the action items for them and for

614
00:16:55,879 --> 00:16:56,440
us.

615
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:58,379
And then after we do that, we'll

616
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:00,110
talk about what happens when

617
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:01,450
campaigns launch.

618
00:17:01,509 --> 00:17:02,570
So we have like an ongoing

619
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:03,129
service.

620
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:03,500
Right.

621
00:17:03,649 --> 00:17:05,619
So like for Legion, we talk about

622
00:17:05,619 --> 00:17:07,509
what we need to do to launch and

623
00:17:07,509 --> 00:17:09,328
get them fully on board and set

624
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:09,920
up.

625
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:11,068
And then what happens when

626
00:17:11,309 --> 00:17:12,140
campaigns launch?

627
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:13,119
That's like another question.

628
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:14,769
So once campaigns launch, we talk

629
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:16,470
them and walk them through that

630
00:17:16,568 --> 00:17:18,170
entire process on what they can

631
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:18,750
expect,

632
00:17:18,789 --> 00:17:20,279
how long it's going to take to get

633
00:17:20,279 --> 00:17:22,009
results, where they're going to be

634
00:17:22,009 --> 00:17:23,190
able to find the results,

635
00:17:23,328 --> 00:17:24,950
what to do when they get results,

636
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:26,509
how to provide feedback on the

637
00:17:26,509 --> 00:17:27,160
results.

638
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:29,430
And then we're detailing literally

639
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:30,450
everything.

640
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:32,130
So we're not leaving any room for

641
00:17:32,269 --> 00:17:33,809
doubt or for questions.

642
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:36,299
And that's on purpose.

643
00:17:36,329 --> 00:17:37,769
So you want to you want to

644
00:17:37,769 --> 00:17:38,900
rehearse this.

645
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:40,099
We've done so many onboarding

646
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:41,720
calls and have gotten really good

647
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,970
at it to the point where it's a

648
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:43,619
science.

649
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:43,920
Right.

650
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:44,339
We get on.

651
00:17:44,369 --> 00:17:45,490
We introduce ourselves.

652
00:17:45,589 --> 00:17:46,740
We ask them about their goals.

653
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:48,240
We make sure their goals are in

654
00:17:48,289 --> 00:17:49,500
line with what we think we can

655
00:17:49,609 --> 00:17:50,140
provide.

656
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:51,519
We do the screen share.

657
00:17:51,549 --> 00:17:52,700
We walk them through where they

658
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:53,819
can find everything.

659
00:17:53,849 --> 00:17:55,000
We ask for their feedback on the

660
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:56,200
list and the scripts.

661
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:57,349
We get into all the accounts we

662
00:17:57,569 --> 00:17:58,460
need access to if we haven't

663
00:17:58,460 --> 00:17:59,039
already.

664
00:17:59,069 --> 00:18:00,690
And then we tell them what's left

665
00:18:00,809 --> 00:18:02,519
to do to onboard them and to get

666
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:03,839
campaigns set up.

667
00:18:04,269 --> 00:18:05,839
Once we have clarity on all that,

668
00:18:05,839 --> 00:18:07,579
we let them know what to expect.

669
00:18:07,609 --> 00:18:09,259
Once campaigns launched, make sure

670
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:11,109
they don't have any questions on

671
00:18:11,109 --> 00:18:11,940
any of that.

672
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:14,029
So there's full clarity on the A

673
00:18:14,089 --> 00:18:15,119
to Z process.

674
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:17,539
And then literally from there, all

675
00:18:17,539 --> 00:18:19,940
we're doing is saying, OK, great.

676
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:21,119
If you have any other questions,

677
00:18:21,329 --> 00:18:22,369
you know, that's what Slack is

678
00:18:22,369 --> 00:18:22,720
for.

679
00:18:22,829 --> 00:18:24,390
We have Slack set up to handle

680
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:25,579
communications.

681
00:18:25,609 --> 00:18:27,099
But other outside of Slack, the

682
00:18:27,099 --> 00:18:28,559
other way we'll communicate is

683
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,009
through, you know, monthly

684
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,420
checking calls or whatever it

685
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:32,400
might be for you.

686
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:34,059
For us, we just do a 60 day review

687
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:34,680
call.

688
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:36,569
And then from there, after the 60

689
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:38,269
day review call, we could continue

690
00:18:38,369 --> 00:18:40,019
to schedule, like, calls every 60

691
00:18:40,279 --> 00:18:41,579
days or every 30 days.

692
00:18:41,609 --> 00:18:42,730
We even say on the onboarding

693
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:44,339
call, like, hey, if you ever, you

694
00:18:44,339 --> 00:18:45,599
know, need to reach us or if we

695
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:47,210
ever need to connect for a call.

696
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:48,869
A lot of times things of this

697
00:18:49,369 --> 00:18:50,990
nature can be resolved through

698
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:51,650
Slack.

699
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:52,849
So we don't like to set up monthly

700
00:18:53,089 --> 00:18:53,700
checking calls.

701
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:55,349
But if, you know, something comes

702
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:57,049
up where a call is necessary and

703
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:58,680
you guys feel more comfortable

704
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,460
getting on a call with our team,

705
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:01,750
then we could do that.

706
00:19:01,809 --> 00:19:03,210
And we'll set up a call and we'll

707
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:04,599
send you our Calendly link for

708
00:19:04,599 --> 00:19:05,960
that because we have a Calendly

709
00:19:06,039 --> 00:19:07,799
link for client checking calls.

710
00:19:07,829 --> 00:19:09,450
So we go through that and then

711
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,539
we'll just schedule that 60 day

712
00:19:11,569 --> 00:19:13,500
review call and then we'll wrap it

713
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:13,900
up.

714
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:17,000
So I know that's a lot, a lot of

715
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,799
information.

716
00:19:18,829 --> 00:19:19,950
And that's just one way to do it.

717
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:21,099
That's how we like to do it.

718
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:22,750
And the in the middle stuff there

719
00:19:22,869 --> 00:19:24,420
is going to be different for

720
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:26,549
everyone, depending on the service

721
00:19:26,549 --> 00:19:28,160
you set up and what visuals you

722
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:28,670
have.

723
00:19:29,009 --> 00:19:31,019
But really to break it down and to

724
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:32,829
keep and to recap and keep it

725
00:19:32,829 --> 00:19:33,660
simple.

726
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:35,630
The beginning of the call is you

727
00:19:35,809 --> 00:19:37,660
and your team introducing your

728
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:39,829
roles and responsibilities in the

729
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,720
project.

730
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:43,200
Once the client is clear on that,

731
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,579
you turn it over to them to hear

732
00:19:44,579 --> 00:19:45,829
about where they're at in their

733
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:47,599
business and what their goals are

734
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:49,420
and expectations are and what they

735
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:51,630
think success looks like with

736
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:52,809
working with you.

737
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:54,819
And as long as everything is

738
00:19:55,029 --> 00:19:56,059
aligned there and you guys

739
00:19:56,059 --> 00:19:57,460
understand their goals and you

740
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:59,019
think their goals are accurate for

741
00:19:59,019 --> 00:20:00,710
what they might be able to expect,

742
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,640
you can move on and you move on

743
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,900
into basically introducing them

744
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,579
into your workspace.

745
00:20:07,069 --> 00:20:09,200
So for us, we share our Trello

746
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,650
board and we go through where they

747
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:13,750
can find everything and we go

748
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:16,039
through a few materials that we

749
00:20:16,039 --> 00:20:18,259
need their feedback on.

750
00:20:18,289 --> 00:20:19,930
So we like to do the script review

751
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:21,609
and the leads list review right on

752
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:23,220
the call because we have them

753
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,990
there and we can get live feedback

754
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,690
and we could workshop it a little

755
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:27,279
bit.

756
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:28,799
So the middle part is like a

757
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,549
workshop session on some things

758
00:20:30,549 --> 00:20:32,279
that we need from the client.

759
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:34,390
So we'll do that we'll fill in the

760
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:36,309
gaps that that we think are there

761
00:20:36,309 --> 00:20:37,789
again like in regards to the

762
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:39,779
onboarding form like we might need

763
00:20:39,779 --> 00:20:41,309
to collect a little bit more

764
00:20:41,309 --> 00:20:42,420
information.

765
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:44,069
So we'll do that and that's this

766
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:46,039
part of the call might be really

767
00:20:46,039 --> 00:20:47,960
short for you, which is fine.

768
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:49,769
It just depends on what

769
00:20:50,009 --> 00:20:51,579
information you need and what you

770
00:20:51,579 --> 00:20:52,740
need approval on.

771
00:20:52,769 --> 00:20:54,410
And then, like I said, we also get

772
00:20:54,539 --> 00:20:56,099
access to their accounts if we

773
00:20:56,099 --> 00:20:57,740
weren't able to get access before

774
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:59,740
the call for whatever reason, like

775
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:01,369
two-factor authentication or

776
00:21:01,369 --> 00:21:02,230
whatever.

777
00:21:02,289 --> 00:21:04,200
And then once we wrap up that

778
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:06,690
part, we'll let them know what

779
00:21:06,819 --> 00:21:09,259
else we need to do, like what the

780
00:21:09,259 --> 00:21:11,589
action items are, just like we do

781
00:21:11,589 --> 00:21:13,140
on our check-in calls and client

782
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,339
ascension every week.

783
00:21:14,509 --> 00:21:16,480
Like I always say this, like I'm

784
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:18,339
doing my job if you are clear on

785
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:20,180
your action items at the end of

786
00:21:20,329 --> 00:21:21,180
that call.

787
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:22,869
So just like you're my clients,

788
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:24,880
you guys in this coaching program

789
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,619
are my clients and so you want to

790
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:28,740
treat your clients the same way.

791
00:21:28,769 --> 00:21:30,390
You want to make sure that they

792
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:32,480
are clear on what's needing to be

793
00:21:32,519 --> 00:21:34,369
done to accomplish whatever it

794
00:21:34,589 --> 00:21:35,990
might be, like launching the

795
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:38,430
campaigns or finishing the project

796
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:40,329
or starting the services or

797
00:21:40,329 --> 00:21:42,859
getting results for that matter.

798
00:21:43,089 --> 00:21:44,670
So be clear on the action items

799
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:46,279
for you and for the client.

800
00:21:46,309 --> 00:21:47,460
It's important to always talk

801
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:48,779
about what you're working on

802
00:21:48,779 --> 00:21:50,049
because that builds trust and

803
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:51,390
transparency with the client.

804
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:52,799
They know exactly what it is

805
00:21:53,009 --> 00:21:53,900
you're working on.

806
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:55,490
That's why I love Trello and I

807
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:57,220
love like the to-do list and the

808
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:59,000
completed task setup in Trello

809
00:21:59,259 --> 00:22:00,650
because you could literally show

810
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:02,240
them everything you've worked on

811
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,420
and everything you still have left

812
00:22:03,579 --> 00:22:04,029
to work on.

813
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:06,519
And you could tag cards with

814
00:22:06,519 --> 00:22:07,440
labels.

815
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:09,130
So like one's labeled, you know,

816
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:10,769
for your agency and the other

817
00:22:10,769 --> 00:22:12,490
labels for the client so they know

818
00:22:12,529 --> 00:22:14,519
exactly who's assigned to what.

819
00:22:14,589 --> 00:22:16,230
So once you lay out the action

820
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,720
items and they're clear on what's

821
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,960
about to happen next or what needs

822
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,019
to happen next, you just let them

823
00:22:23,019 --> 00:22:24,720
know what happens after all those

824
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:25,799
things are done.

825
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:27,829
So like once campaigns are

826
00:22:28,049 --> 00:22:30,309
launched or once the website is

827
00:22:30,309 --> 00:22:32,529
completed or once the emails

828
00:22:32,529 --> 00:22:34,890
campaigns are set up, whatever it

829
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:36,339
is that you're doing for them, let

830
00:22:36,339 --> 00:22:37,599
them know what happens next,

831
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:37,960
right?

832
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,829
Is there is there going to be some

833
00:22:40,049 --> 00:22:41,880
form of reporting that they can

834
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,119
expect, right?

835
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:44,299
Are they going to get like weekly

836
00:22:44,509 --> 00:22:44,789
reports?

837
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:46,140
Are you guys going to get on

838
00:22:46,349 --> 00:22:47,549
monthly check-in calls?

839
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:49,140
Are they going to get update

840
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:50,720
messages two or three times a

841
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,240
week?

842
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:53,730
What can they expect as like the

843
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:56,200
ongoing services, right?

844
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:57,869
So what is the ongoing management

845
00:22:58,369 --> 00:23:00,549
or the ongoing services look like

846
00:23:00,549 --> 00:23:02,380
for something like this?

847
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:03,980
And then once that's clear, you

848
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:05,289
basically just wrap it up by

849
00:23:05,289 --> 00:23:06,869
saying, all right, let's get to

850
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:07,420
work.

851
00:23:07,569 --> 00:23:08,619
Do you have any questions?

852
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:09,450
And then if they don't have any

853
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,619
questions, you say, no worries.

854
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:11,920
If you have, if you think of

855
00:23:12,009 --> 00:23:13,680
anything after the call, you know,

856
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,049
just let us know in Slack.

857
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:16,809
Like basically we'll say, hey,

858
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:18,769
let's continue the conversation in

859
00:23:18,769 --> 00:23:20,130
Slack after this call.

860
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:21,630
If you think of anything else and

861
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:23,099
then if you need to get on a call,

862
00:23:23,099 --> 00:23:23,819
we'll do it.

863
00:23:23,849 --> 00:23:25,240
But for the most part, we'll get

864
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:25,750
to work.

865
00:23:25,789 --> 00:23:27,430
We'll get these campaigns launched

866
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:29,579
and we'll keep you updated through

867
00:23:29,579 --> 00:23:31,460
Slack with anything important or

868
00:23:31,609 --> 00:23:33,089
relevant if anything comes up and

869
00:23:33,089 --> 00:23:34,460
we just ask you to do the same.

870
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:36,650
So that's the homeboarding call.

871
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:38,589
So I talk really fast.

872
00:23:38,829 --> 00:23:40,910
So if you need to watch this back,

873
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:41,960
please do it.

874
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:43,579
But it's really simple.

875
00:23:43,609 --> 00:23:45,089
The onboarding call is so

876
00:23:45,089 --> 00:23:47,119
important, though, because it

877
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:49,160
accomplishes so many things.

878
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:50,809
It just makes sure it's like

879
00:23:51,309 --> 00:23:52,819
confirmation that you and your

880
00:23:52,819 --> 00:23:54,759
client are on the same page.

881
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:57,460
And that simple accomplishment of

882
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:59,539
being on the same page with your

883
00:23:59,539 --> 00:24:01,869
client, especially early on, is

884
00:24:01,869 --> 00:24:03,640
key to long term success in

885
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,890
retention in the client services

886
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:06,720
space.

887
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:09,009
Because this thing as soon as

888
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:11,289
things get unorganized and lost

889
00:24:11,289 --> 00:24:13,460
and there's doubt, right?

890
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:15,130
There's doubt clouding your

891
00:24:15,609 --> 00:24:17,259
client's judgment about your

892
00:24:17,259 --> 00:24:19,440
capabilities and the actual work

893
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,940
that you're doing.

894
00:24:21,309 --> 00:24:23,150
They're going to start to devalue

895
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:25,140
your services and just, you know,

896
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,319
not have an interest to continue.

897
00:24:27,569 --> 00:24:29,059
So what you're doing is you're

898
00:24:29,059 --> 00:24:30,849
you're literally just making your

899
00:24:30,849 --> 00:24:32,440
case on why they're paying you a

900
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,819
certain amount of money and

901
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,400
showing them that real work is

902
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,240
going into it.

903
00:24:36,829 --> 00:24:37,950
That's why I love the to do list

904
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:39,529
and the completed task list,

905
00:24:39,529 --> 00:24:40,990
because a lot of the times, like

906
00:24:41,009 --> 00:24:42,650
when we're doing lead gen, they're

907
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:43,740
not there's it's a lot of

908
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:44,849
automation and things are

909
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:46,759
happening behind the scenes.

910
00:24:46,789 --> 00:24:48,190
But the more we could show them

911
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:49,750
visually that real work is going

912
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:51,400
into it, the more they are they're

913
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,940
going to put about like the higher

914
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,769
value they're going to put, the

915
00:24:54,769 --> 00:24:56,200
higher the value that they're

916
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,519
going to put on on the work that

917
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:58,519
we're doing.

918
00:24:58,549 --> 00:25:00,390
And they're going to be, you know,

919
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:02,079
happier to pay us the amount that

920
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:03,200
we're charging.

921
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:05,430
So, yeah, onboarding call is super

922
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:06,380
important.

923
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:08,420
It's going to take practice.

924
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:11,319
So I kind of draft up, you know,

925
00:25:11,319 --> 00:25:14,140
an order or like an outline of how

926
00:25:14,289 --> 00:25:16,779
you want to go about doing the

927
00:25:16,779 --> 00:25:19,680
onboarding calls just so you're

928
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:22,680
prepared, like an agenda.

929
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:24,160
I meant like what is the agenda of

930
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,690
the onboarding call and just come

931
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,109
and just start practicing those

932
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,579
like you have accountability

933
00:25:28,579 --> 00:25:29,910
partners as a part of being in

934
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:30,880
this program.

935
00:25:31,069 --> 00:25:32,440
So maybe that's something you

936
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,930
could do with them is like just do

937
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:35,420
a mock onboarding call with them

938
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:37,029
and walk them through your process

939
00:25:37,029 --> 00:25:38,369
or even just record yourself

940
00:25:38,369 --> 00:25:40,269
through loom doing an onboarding

941
00:25:40,269 --> 00:25:42,059
call, whether it be by yourself or

942
00:25:42,059 --> 00:25:43,740
even with a partner at your agency

943
00:25:43,839 --> 00:25:45,240
and just do it like a sales role

944
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:45,680
play.

945
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,180
But it's an onboarding call role

946
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:48,849
play, because these are, again,

947
00:25:48,849 --> 00:25:49,869
super important.

948
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:51,569
And really, the only way to get

949
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:53,809
good at them is just through reps.

950
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:55,509
Like like really, it's it's just

951
00:25:55,529 --> 00:25:56,319
like sales.

952
00:25:56,349 --> 00:25:57,970
And yeah, don't put too much

953
00:25:58,470 --> 00:25:59,819
pressure on yourself in the

954
00:25:59,819 --> 00:26:00,750
beginning.

955
00:26:00,829 --> 00:26:02,279
Just just get comfortable with it.

956
00:26:02,309 --> 00:26:03,660
You'll figure it out as time goes

957
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:03,930
on.

958
00:26:04,009 --> 00:26:05,650
And let me know, you know, how

959
00:26:05,789 --> 00:26:07,750
these onboarding calls go, what

960
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:09,710
the feedback is from your clients

961
00:26:09,829 --> 00:26:11,549
after hopping on these calls.

962
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:13,289

963
