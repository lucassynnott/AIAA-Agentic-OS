1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:03,359
What's going on guys Andre Hakel

2
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:03,839
Jr.

3
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:05,519
here from client Ascension and in

4
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:07,599
this video I'm gonna walk

5
00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:09,519
through how to conduct a case

6
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:11,759
study interview so if you've made

7
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:14,199
it to this point congrats it means

8
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,899
that you've generating meaningful

9
00:00:16,899 --> 00:00:19,239
results for one or some or all of

10
00:00:19,239 --> 00:00:21,480
your clients and that's a huge

11
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:24,760
win that you should be extremely

12
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:28,030
proud of and excited about and so

13
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:30,269
now not only did you just

14
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:31,920
capture a win for that client but

15
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,380
you want to make sure that it's

16
00:00:33,409 --> 00:00:35,130
properly documented and that you

17
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:35,500
can

18
00:00:35,539 --> 00:00:37,759
cash in on the amazing work that

19
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:39,840
you've done so that you can do

20
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,359
amazing work for even more people

21
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,429
and so the three objectives just

22
00:00:44,429 --> 00:00:46,409
to start us off of why you should

23
00:00:46,409 --> 00:00:48,520
conduct a case study interview

24
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,200
a lot of people don't think about

25
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,539
a case study interview as a

26
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,560
mechanism for retention but I see

27
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,799
two out of the three objectives

28
00:00:55,799 --> 00:00:58,210
working towards retention and in

29
00:00:58,210 --> 00:00:59,920
one of them working towards new

30
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,600
sales so the first objective is to

31
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:03,060
draw attention to the actual

32
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:04,659
client and make them feel good

33
00:01:04,659 --> 00:01:04,719
about

34
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,760
their success now what that will

35
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,709
do is help retain that client so

36
00:01:08,709 --> 00:01:10,659
you've already turned them into a

37
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:11,709
case study which means you've

38
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:12,980
gotten them meaningful results

39
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:14,620
which means they should retain

40
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:16,299
anyways but

41
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:17,579
doubling down and getting them on

42
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:18,670
a case study interview where

43
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:19,819
you're hyping them up in front

44
00:01:19,859 --> 00:01:21,709
of your entire audience is going

45
00:01:21,709 --> 00:01:22,849
to double down on that draw

46
00:01:22,859 --> 00:01:24,400
attention to them make them feel

47
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:24,629
good

48
00:01:24,739 --> 00:01:27,540
and retain them even longer the

49
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,450
second objective you should have

50
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:31,959
is to help other clients in your

51
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,760
business learn from this client's

52
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,439
success right because not every

53
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:37,019
single client you work with will

54
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:37,459
get the

55
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,400
same results or as meaningful or

56
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,200
as successful results as this

57
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,079
client you're choosing to do a

58
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:44,060
case study interview with

59
00:01:44,099 --> 00:01:46,060
and so by interviewing your

60
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:48,140
successful clients you can share

61
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:50,939
those interviews with your less

62
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:51,500
successful

63
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,189
clients and show them that yeah

64
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,340
results like this are possible

65
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:57,579
just follow what this guy is doing

66
00:01:57,579 --> 00:01:57,900
and what

67
00:01:57,939 --> 00:02:00,620
this guy said about our services

68
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,340
and either stick it out because

69
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:05,530
it'll eventually work or apply the

70
00:02:05,739 --> 00:02:05,819
same

71
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:07,359
strategies and concepts it's more

72
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:08,530
applicable I would say to a

73
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:09,990
coaching program like with client

74
00:02:10,099 --> 00:02:11,550
attention some students

75
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:13,259
you can get great results but then

76
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,740
I'll send them one of our case

77
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,379
study interviews and they'll learn

78
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:17,020
from another

79
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:18,490
student in here that talks about

80
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:19,780
the keys to their success with

81
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:21,659
getting results in our program and

82
00:02:21,659 --> 00:02:22,060
so it can

83
00:02:22,099 --> 00:02:24,300
work to retain your other clients

84
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,389
because now they're building the

85
00:02:26,389 --> 00:02:27,900
belief that your service can

86
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:28,539
actually work

87
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:30,169
for them even if it hasn't worked

88
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:32,120
up to this point and then the

89
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,270
third is a driver for new sales

90
00:02:34,289 --> 00:02:35,219
which is to encourage

91
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,860
process prospects to become

92
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:38,659
clients and the way you do that is

93
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:40,699
by showing them that your services

94
00:02:40,699 --> 00:02:41,020
produce

95
00:02:41,139 --> 00:02:43,289
meaningful and awesome results for

96
00:02:43,289 --> 00:02:45,180
other people's businesses and

97
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:48,219
other people who are like them and

98
00:02:48,219 --> 00:02:48,300
so

99
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,330
i'm just going to go through the

100
00:02:49,449 --> 00:02:51,169
before the case study interview

101
00:02:51,169 --> 00:02:53,020
the after during the case study

102
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:53,379
interview and

103
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:54,870
the after the case study interview

104
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,270
so i'll break this down into three

105
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:58,620
sections so before your case study

106
00:02:58,620 --> 00:02:59,020
interview

107
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:00,330
obviously you just have to ask

108
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:01,740
this is the part that most people

109
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,340
overthink like it's really really

110
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:03,659
simple

111
00:03:03,699 --> 00:03:06,620
all you do is ideally after a big

112
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:09,389
win you reach out to the guy and

113
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:11,099
say well huge congrats on the

114
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:11,289
recent

115
00:03:11,539 --> 00:03:12,819
success and you should be more

116
00:03:12,819 --> 00:03:14,259
specific and personalized with

117
00:03:14,259 --> 00:03:15,819
this like huge success on signing

118
00:03:15,819 --> 00:03:16,139
a new

119
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:18,270
client or huge success on passing

120
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,569
this big milestone or huge success

121
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,460
or congrats on achieving your

122
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:22,939
wildly

123
00:03:22,979 --> 00:03:24,550
important goal in the program i'd

124
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:26,099
love to feature you on my youtube

125
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:27,740
channel for a client spotlight

126
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,039
interview like i've done for

127
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:30,550
however many other clients let me

128
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,139
know if you'd be interested and we

129
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,319
can schedule a day and time for

130
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:34,639
the interview so something along

131
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:36,060
these lines don't overthink it

132
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:36,139
this

133
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,000
works for me every single time

134
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,639
nobody ever turns down the

135
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:41,650
opportunity to be featured on my

136
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:42,539
youtube channel

137
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:44,150
and if you're thinking well my

138
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:45,620
youtube channel is not like

139
00:03:45,629 --> 00:03:47,349
andre's well my youtube channel is

140
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:47,740

have a thousand subscribers i

143
00:03:50,509 --> 00:03:51,909
don't get a ton of views these

144
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:52,460
videos are

145
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,280
not um gonna make anyone famous

146
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,819
but just the sound of being

147
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:57,659
featured on someone's youtube

148
00:03:57,659 --> 00:03:58,219
channel

149
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:59,800
especially someone that was able

150
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,250
to produce meaningful business

151
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,099
results for them is an enticing

152
00:04:03,099 --> 00:04:04,300
offer uh

153
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:05,919
right away and so that's all you

154
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:07,460
have to do don't try to think of

155
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:11,659
like ways to to persuade people to

156
00:04:11,659 --> 00:04:11,930
to do

157
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,469
this like simply ask there's no

158
00:04:13,469 --> 00:04:15,039
need to overthink this there's no

159
00:04:15,069 --> 00:04:16,699
need to send out starbucks gift

160
00:04:16,699 --> 00:04:17,259
cards

161
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,939
for them spending their time with

162
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,449
you on an interview you are the

163
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:22,300
prize right remember that david

164
00:04:22,339 --> 00:04:23,839
jacob the sales coach and client

165
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:25,240
ascension probably already

166
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,110
ingrained this into your brain at

167
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:27,389
this

168
00:04:27,459 --> 00:04:29,480
point but you are the prize right

169
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,389
you uh hosting someone on your

170
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:33,420
youtube channel is a huge win and

171
00:04:33,459 --> 00:04:34,720
a huge value add for them plus

172
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,370
you've already gotten them amazing

173
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:37,819
results and so they kind of owe

174
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:38,139
you one

175
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:40,029
right and so uh ask right and

176
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:42,009
again ideally after a big win

177
00:04:42,009 --> 00:04:44,379
timing here is super important if

178
00:04:44,379 --> 00:04:44,939
a client is

179
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,579
complaining or it's not going very

180
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:48,220
well their campaigns it's not the

181
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:49,980
right time to ask so be patient as

182
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:50,220
well

183
00:04:50,259 --> 00:04:51,399
you don't need to do a case study

184
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:52,790
interview with every single client

185
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:54,620
right away there's always the

186
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:57,040
right time and place for it the

187
00:04:57,079 --> 00:04:59,279
next thing here is to craft a

188
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:01,579
unique angle so the the the thing

189
00:05:01,579 --> 00:05:01,980
i see

190
00:05:02,019 --> 00:05:03,420
people miss all the time with

191
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:04,860
their case studies is it just

192
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,420
sounds robotic hey what revenue

193
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:07,069
did you start

194
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:09,379
with okay um what revenue are you

195
00:05:09,379 --> 00:05:11,670
now at thanks to my services okay

196
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:13,899
end interview and it's the most

197
00:05:13,899 --> 00:05:14,379
boring

198
00:05:15,379 --> 00:05:17,230
video i've ever seen there's no

199
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:19,189
story to it and like sure like the

200
00:05:19,189 --> 00:05:21,019
revenue and the results are

201
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:23,290
impressive and you're making a

202
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:25,829
decent point there but stories are

203
00:05:25,829 --> 00:05:28,220
what sell people relate to other

204
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:30,180
people's stories right if you look

205
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,000
at all the client ascension case

206
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,660
study interviews the revenue

207
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:33,980
numbers

208
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,750
are pretty much the same across

209
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:37,629
the board it's like they started

210
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:39,660
at 0k or 3k or 5k a month and they

211
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:40,060
got to

212
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,410
30k or 50k a month cool but it's

213
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:44,410
the stories that sell because all

214
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:46,379
your prospects have a unique story

215
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:47,779
that they're telling themselves

216
00:05:47,779 --> 00:05:49,129
about themselves and if they can

217
00:05:49,129 --> 00:05:50,379
relate to someone else in the

218
00:05:50,379 --> 00:05:50,699
program

219
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,470
that had a similar story or a

220
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,490
unique situation like they did

221
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:56,699
then it's just going to help them

222
00:05:56,699 --> 00:05:56,939
to

223
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,269
relate to someone that was in your

224
00:05:58,269 --> 00:05:59,560
program and got results which is

225
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,779
going to help them believe that

226
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:02,459
they too can get results with your

227
00:06:02,459 --> 00:06:03,720
program and so a couple of

228
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,420
examples from right within client

229
00:06:05,459 --> 00:06:07,269
attention is master teffin so the

230
00:06:07,269 --> 00:06:08,930
unique angle we use with max is

231
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:10,779
that he's running his business

232
00:06:10,779 --> 00:06:11,100
while

233
00:06:11,139 --> 00:06:13,629
still being a college student and

234
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:15,899
so this interview is the one we

235
00:06:15,899 --> 00:06:17,980
send to people that come on our

236
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:18,300
calls

237
00:06:18,339 --> 00:06:19,750
and say hey they don't have time

238
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,250
well hey max is a college student

239
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:22,740
and he's managing a full course

240
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:23,110
load

241
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,779
while also scaling his email uh

242
00:06:24,779 --> 00:06:26,639
e-commerce email marketing agency

243
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,220
what's your excuse or even to

244
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:28,699
existing

245
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,230
college students that come through

246
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:31,490
our funnel we can point to this

247
00:06:31,509 --> 00:06:33,100
specific example or canaan

248
00:06:33,139 --> 00:06:34,910
who's from lebanon right that many

249
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:36,829
would consider their rural country

250
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:38,540
or a country that's suffering

251
00:06:38,579 --> 00:06:40,139
during an economic crisis if he

252
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:41,860
could make it from lebanon what if

253
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,180
someone else in lebanon is

254
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:43,500
thinking

255
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:45,089
hey like i'd love to join but i

256
00:06:45,089 --> 00:06:46,839
don't think it would make sense

257
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:48,699
for someone from lebanon well we

258
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:48,939
have

259
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,220
now a case study and a story of

260
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,839
someone who joined from lebanon or

261
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:53,110
someone who's a lot younger like

262
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:55,180
rafael who joined at only 17 years

263
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,740
old and is already a case study

264
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:58,139
for client ascension what

265
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:59,360
if we have a younger prospect

266
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,689
that's feeling a little unsure

267
00:07:00,689 --> 00:07:02,220
that he might be the only younger

268
00:07:02,259 --> 00:07:03,290
person in the community and that

269
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:04,410
younger people in the community

270
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:05,740
don't succeed well that's not true

271
00:07:05,779 --> 00:07:07,120
or adam who started at zero

272
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,930
dollars with his agency right what

273
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,540
if someone wants to join client

274
00:07:10,579 --> 00:07:11,589
ascension but their limiting

275
00:07:11,689 --> 00:07:12,920
belief is that they don't have a

276
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,220
business yet and they haven't

277
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:14,620
gotten it

278
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:15,870
off the ground well we have

279
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:17,579
someone that started at literally

280
00:07:17,579 --> 00:07:19,709
zero or someone that's looking for

281
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:21,939
much more results than just adding

282
00:07:21,939 --> 00:07:24,370
10k profit to their agency well we

283
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:26,350
have an example of matt larson

284
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:28,879
who scaled his agency to 900 000 a

285
00:07:28,889 --> 00:07:30,430
month and had a huge exit so if

286
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:31,910
someone wants to exit their

287
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:32,540
business

288
00:07:32,579 --> 00:07:34,149
we now have a story for those

289
00:07:34,149 --> 00:07:36,129
specific prospects that they can

290
00:07:36,129 --> 00:07:37,620
relate to and get them in or

291
00:07:37,689 --> 00:07:38,269
someone

292
00:07:38,339 --> 00:07:39,850
like erwin who signed whale

293
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:41,740
clients like grant cardone and ed

294
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:43,389
mylett or lucas who joined the

295
00:07:43,449 --> 00:07:44,300
program and

296
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:44,300
then eventually became a coach in

297
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:44,300
the program and so there's so many

298
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:44,300
unique stories or and unique

299
00:07:45,459 --> 00:07:49,579
angles

300
00:07:49,779 --> 00:07:51,430
for every single case study

301
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:53,319
interview that i do and that

302
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:55,500
should all be prepared and thought

303
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:56,220
through

304
00:07:56,259 --> 00:07:57,420
before you actually do the case

305
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,639
study interview that's that way

306
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,220
you can like prepare and craft the

307
00:08:00,259 --> 00:08:01,709
questions and craft the opener and

308
00:08:01,709 --> 00:08:02,920
the intro and all that sort of

309
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,740
stuff and so that's the the before

310
00:08:05,779 --> 00:08:07,589
a lot of work happens before right

311
00:08:07,589 --> 00:08:09,879
you have to prepare but during is

312
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:12,220
is really simple so i use a

313
00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:14,810
tool called riverside uh dot fm to

314
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:17,310
actually record my podcast uh or

315
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:19,850
sorry my case study interviews i i

316
00:08:19,939 --> 00:08:21,209
really just treat them like a

317
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:22,680
podcast honestly um this tool is

318
00:08:22,689 --> 00:08:23,980
super simple to use there's

319
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:24,300
another

320
00:08:24,339 --> 00:08:25,720
video on client ascension that

321
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,060
walks you through how to use it

322
00:08:27,069 --> 00:08:28,620
and set it up but it's dead simple

323
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:30,129
it's really similar to zoom um so

324
00:08:30,129 --> 00:08:31,540
once you create the recording

325
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:32,940
it'll create a link for you to

326
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:33,259
send to

327
00:08:33,298 --> 00:08:35,230
them the reason i like riverside

328
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:37,158
is because it records in 4k so

329
00:08:37,158 --> 00:08:38,990
your videos look super crisp

330
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:40,559
on youtube where if you do this on

331
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,990
like zoom or google meets it's

332
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:45,500
gonna look like and so uh pay for

333
00:08:45,539 --> 00:08:47,519
riverside if you're gonna do um if

334
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,460
you're gonna do these case study

335
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:51,330
interviews it's it's very much

336
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:51,659
worth

337
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,519
it um and then once you actually

338
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,019
do the interview like ask

339
00:08:55,019 --> 00:08:56,889
questions that make it easy for

340
00:08:56,889 --> 00:08:57,500
them to tell

341
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,710
their journey right again or tell

342
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,629
their story is probably um the

343
00:09:01,629 --> 00:09:03,409
better the better uh we're here

344
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,879
but journey is important too

345
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:06,590
because the journey through your

346
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:08,220
program is is the story you want

347
00:09:08,259 --> 00:09:09,519
them to tell you don't want them

348
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:10,870
to tell their life story that has

349
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:11,820
nothing to do with you

350
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,700
or their business or the services

351
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,340
that you perform and so the

352
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:17,419
questions that i usually like to

353
00:09:17,419 --> 00:09:18,220
go to

354
00:09:18,259 --> 00:09:20,120
are in this order right you'll

355
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,159
start to see like the the trend in

356
00:09:22,169 --> 00:09:23,899
the timeline here is like who are

357
00:09:23,899 --> 00:09:24,059
you

358
00:09:24,179 --> 00:09:25,289
and what do you do for work so

359
00:09:25,289 --> 00:09:26,750
that the audience understands who

360
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,700
we're speaking with how did you

361
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,490
hear about my company or services

362
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:32,139
so i frame this as how do you hear

363
00:09:32,139 --> 00:09:33,899
about client ascension and i

364
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,519
always get interesting answers to

365
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:36,899
this some guy told me he heard

366
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:38,070
about it from his college

367
00:09:38,179 --> 00:09:38,700
professor

368
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:40,750
another guy told me about how he

369
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,789
ran into christian in the men's

370
00:09:42,789 --> 00:09:45,100
locker room at his gym and heard

371
00:09:45,139 --> 00:09:46,309
about client ascension that way

372
00:09:46,309 --> 00:09:47,610
and so there's always interesting

373
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,860
stories some people heard about

374
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:50,870
it just through uh one of daniel's

375
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:52,529
youtube rants and so this is

376
00:09:52,529 --> 00:09:55,100
always a fun question to ask um

377
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:55,259
and

378
00:09:55,299 --> 00:09:57,159
then what were you struggling with

379
00:09:57,169 --> 00:09:59,090
before signing up for our services

380
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:00,700
what was your business like

381
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:02,779
and don't overload this question

382
00:10:02,779 --> 00:10:04,870
with really anything else figure

383
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,940
out what they were struggling with

384
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,809
before they signed up and how they

385
00:10:08,809 --> 00:10:10,669
described their business a lot of

386
00:10:10,669 --> 00:10:12,460
times you'll hear pain points

387
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,940
that are similar to the pain

388
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:15,879
points your current prospects have

389
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:17,419
such as i was spending too much

390
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:19,769
time the business was a pain um i

391
00:10:19,769 --> 00:10:22,399
couldn't generate leads there was

392
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,220
no consistency my team

393
00:10:24,259 --> 00:10:26,110
wasn't loyal i was paying people

394
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:27,860
too much i wasn't getting paid

395
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:30,460
enough um i was relying on

396
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:30,860
outdated

397
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:33,100
lead methods i was spending too

398
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,240
much on ads um i had a way too low

399
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,940
of a close rate so they'll tell

400
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:38,759
you all the pain points that your

401
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:40,740
uh target market currently shares

402
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,379
as well so this is a gold mine

403
00:10:42,419 --> 00:10:43,669
of a question and a pro tip for

404
00:10:43,669 --> 00:10:44,909
this one is try to get them to

405
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:46,820
share specific revenue numbers um

406
00:10:46,899 --> 00:10:48,860
any specifics here is is key but

407
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:50,879
again like you're weaving this

408
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:52,700
into a story you're not right out

409
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:52,860
of

410
00:10:52,899 --> 00:10:54,240
the gates being like hey what's

411
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,509
your revenue before you join

412
00:10:55,509 --> 00:10:57,019
what's your revenue after again

413
00:10:57,019 --> 00:10:57,320
you don't

414
00:10:57,379 --> 00:10:59,019
want to make this robotic you want

415
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,519
to make it into more of like a

416
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:02,700
podcast style um so try to get

417
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:03,019
specific

418
00:11:03,059 --> 00:11:04,409
revenue numbers of what they're

419
00:11:04,409 --> 00:11:05,799
struggling with and where their

420
00:11:05,809 --> 00:11:07,580
business was at um maybe they

421
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:07,830
started

422
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:10,139
at zero or they were doing 3k but

423
00:11:10,139 --> 00:11:12,340
the 3k felt like they were doing

424
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,700
the effort of doing 30k while only

425
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,690
making 3k right like try to get

426
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:18,399
that out of them and the more

427
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,700
open-ended you leave the questions

428
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:20,779
the

429
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,700
better uh chance you get towards

430
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,240
that um and you can even say

431
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,220
before the interview just hey when

432
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:26,539
i ask

433
00:11:26,659 --> 00:11:27,620
you the question of like what

434
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:28,820
you're struggling with or what was

435
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,059
business like before i'd really

436
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,620
appreciate you share specific

437
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:33,360
revenue numbers and same thing for

438
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,870
um what they achieved later on

439
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,620
but the next question here is why

440
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,320
did you decide it was time to sign

441
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,899
up for my services this will help

442
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,590
people that are on the fence about

443
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:43,240
whether or not they should use

444
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,710
your services make a buying

445
00:11:44,809 --> 00:11:45,659
decision

446
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,299
because maybe they can relate like

447
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:48,779
they're just sick of whatever

448
00:11:48,779 --> 00:11:50,120
their current circumstances are

449
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:50,299
and

450
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:51,850
they decided it was ready um or

451
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:53,820
who knows what else but ask them

452
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:56,029
why did they decide in that moment

453
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:56,139
in

454
00:11:56,259 --> 00:11:57,909
time to sign up for the services

455
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,870
um especially if they heard about

456
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:01,659
the services even before uh they

457
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,059
signed up right a lot of people

458
00:12:03,059 --> 00:12:04,519
heard about client ascension a

459
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:06,220
year ago and then signed up a year

460
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:07,899
later and so why did they wait all

461
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,409
that time that's going to help

462
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,179
people in your pipeline to make

463
00:12:11,179 --> 00:12:11,899
faster

464
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,350
purchasing decisions which is what

465
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:14,980
you want right um how did my

466
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:17,100
services help you solve what

467
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:17,340
you're

468
00:12:17,379 --> 00:12:18,649
struggling with right so this ties

469
00:12:18,649 --> 00:12:19,909
into this question it's like okay

470
00:12:19,909 --> 00:12:21,179
you're struggling with it you

471
00:12:21,179 --> 00:12:21,509
joined

472
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:22,610
why did you decide to join and

473
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:23,990
then how did my services help you

474
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:26,039
solve that pain point um what

475
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,500
have your business results been

476
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,009
like since joining since joining

477
00:12:29,009 --> 00:12:30,490
what are some wins or milestones

478
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:30,779
you've

479
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:32,360
achieved um so these three

480
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,519
questions are just three different

481
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:36,539
ways to ask like how your services

482
00:12:36,659 --> 00:12:38,779
benefited their uh pre-existing

483
00:12:38,789 --> 00:12:41,049
situation before working with you

484
00:12:41,049 --> 00:12:42,860
and again the pro tip here is to

485
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:43,019
try

486
00:12:43,059 --> 00:12:44,100
to get them to share specific

487
00:12:44,169 --> 00:12:45,320
revenue numbers not everyone's

488
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,379
going to be open to sharing

489
00:12:46,379 --> 00:12:46,860
revenue

490
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:48,549
numbers so at least try to get

491
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,629
them to share significant results

492
00:12:50,629 --> 00:12:52,059
um like number of leads

493
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,529
generated or number of calls

494
00:12:53,529 --> 00:12:54,929
booked and so on whatever is

495
00:12:54,929 --> 00:12:56,779
applicable to the services you're

496
00:12:56,779 --> 00:12:57,100
offering

497
00:12:57,139 --> 00:12:59,129
um then we wrap it with uh what's

498
00:12:59,129 --> 00:13:01,179
one piece of advice you have for

499
00:13:01,179 --> 00:13:02,940
other clients to get the most out

500
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:02,960
of

501
00:13:03,059 --> 00:13:04,700
our services again this is more

502
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:06,730
applicable to let's say a coaching

503
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:08,460
program but this this question i

504
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:08,700
think

505
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:10,830
holds value really for any type of

506
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,990
service offering um because it is

507
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:15,379
to be said like there are dream

508
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:16,970
clients that you're working with

509
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:18,450
and clients that are not so ideal

510
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:19,879
so what does an ideal client look

511
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,440
like and what do they do that

512
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,980
makes them ideal um and also

513
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:24,529
primed for getting the best

514
00:13:24,529 --> 00:13:25,419
results working

515
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:27,100
with you and then what would you

516
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,220
say to someone considering working

517
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,779
with us again leave these

518
00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:31,820
open-ended

519
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,669
um that way you're not like kind

520
00:13:33,669 --> 00:13:35,549
of pushing them towards what to

521
00:13:35,549 --> 00:13:37,100
say but letting them kind of come

522
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:37,259
to

523
00:13:37,299 --> 00:13:40,049
the idea in their own words and so

524
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:42,470
those are really the questions i

525
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:44,620
ask um but also i'm not afraid to

526
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:44,779
go

527
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,629
off script like i want to show

528
00:13:46,629 --> 00:13:48,789
genuine interest in the client's

529
00:13:48,789 --> 00:13:51,340
story um their business what

530
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:51,580
they're

531
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:53,080
actually doing what the journey

532
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,509
looked like how they navigated

533
00:13:54,509 --> 00:13:55,980
certain things and so like these

534
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:56,299
are the

535
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:58,200
core questions i always come back

536
00:13:58,210 --> 00:13:59,940
to but if you watch any of my case

537
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,500
study interviews you'll hear

538
00:14:02,059 --> 00:14:03,480
other questions as well that come

539
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,250
up as the interview is going on

540
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:06,779
and on so don't be afraid

541
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,120
to go off script and again like

542
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,450
don't make this robotic where

543
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:10,950
you're just reading off questions

544
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:11,500
like you

545
00:14:11,539 --> 00:14:13,019
want to make it fun you want to

546
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:14,809
make it entertaining while still

547
00:14:14,809 --> 00:14:16,669
being educational um and again the

548
00:14:16,669 --> 00:14:17,019
best

549
00:14:17,059 --> 00:14:19,309
example or way to think about this

550
00:14:19,309 --> 00:14:21,179
is like making it like a mini

551
00:14:21,179 --> 00:14:22,840
podcast right um that has

552
00:14:23,009 --> 00:14:23,700
structure

553
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:25,009
to it obviously and intent and

554
00:14:25,009 --> 00:14:26,399
objectives right like we talked

555
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:27,659
about here in the beginning

556
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,100
um and then the last thing is is

557
00:14:30,129 --> 00:14:31,870
just in terms of like time uh try

558
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,659
to keep the recording anywhere

559
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,190
from 20 to 30 minutes you should

560
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:36,590
be able to get 20 minutes worth of

561
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:37,980
content from these i've seen case

562
00:14:38,019 --> 00:14:39,529
study interviews that are like two

563
00:14:39,529 --> 00:14:40,789
or three minutes or even five

564
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:42,139
minutes long it's like what are

565
00:14:42,139 --> 00:14:42,299
you

566
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,389
doing like you're you're not

567
00:14:44,389 --> 00:14:46,730
getting any story uh whatsoever

568
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,779
it's just focused on what was

569
00:14:48,779 --> 00:14:49,179
revenue

570
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,860
when you started and what was

571
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,779
revenue after um i did my magic

572
00:14:52,779 --> 00:14:55,659
and it's not as valuable as you

573
00:14:55,659 --> 00:14:55,820
think

574
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:57,500
you you really want to tell the

575
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,309
story um so people can invest

576
00:14:59,309 --> 00:15:01,100
their time into hearing you know

577
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:01,259
how

578
00:15:01,299 --> 00:15:02,490
that story relates to their

579
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:03,879
current story or the story that

580
00:15:03,879 --> 00:15:06,000
they're telling themselves and so

581
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:06,860
that's the during

582
00:15:06,899 --> 00:15:09,259
and then the after is really as

583
00:15:09,259 --> 00:15:11,669
simple as share with the client

584
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:13,820
the link to this again like the

585
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:15,710
strategy here is you want to post

586
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:17,529
this um on youtube right that's

587
00:15:17,529 --> 00:15:19,419
kind of the main selling point as

588
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:19,500
to

589
00:15:19,539 --> 00:15:21,860
like why someone would want to uh

590
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:24,110
get on and do this with you um you

591
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:26,379
want to post it to youtube and it

592
00:15:26,419 --> 00:15:27,990
doesn't have to have a pretty

593
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:29,730
thumbnail it doesn't have to be

594
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:31,470
edited at all after you run it

595
00:15:31,529 --> 00:15:32,700
through riverside

596
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:34,509
just upload it to youtube it could

597
00:15:34,509 --> 00:15:36,059
be very low effort it does not

598
00:15:36,059 --> 00:15:37,500
have to have any editing or

599
00:15:37,539 --> 00:15:39,360
thumbnails to it just upload it to

600
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,019
youtube once it's uploaded to

601
00:15:41,029 --> 00:15:43,100
youtube share it with your client

602
00:15:43,139 --> 00:15:44,720
and have them share it with their

603
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,470
audience or anyone else they think

604
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:48,830
might benefit from hearing their

605
00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:50,539
story and again like they're

606
00:15:50,539 --> 00:15:52,570
incentivized to share that with as

607
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:54,539
many people as possible because to

608
00:15:54,539 --> 00:15:55,100
them

609
00:15:55,139 --> 00:15:56,779
it's an opportunity to show off

610
00:15:56,879 --> 00:15:58,679
their success and the results they

611
00:15:58,679 --> 00:16:01,179
got um thanks to your services and

612
00:16:01,179 --> 00:16:01,419
or

613
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,350
your program and so share with

614
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:05,529
them to get maximum views um this

615
00:16:05,529 --> 00:16:07,740
is also a great opportunity to

616
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:08,100
upsell

617
00:16:08,179 --> 00:16:09,700
your client if it makes sense to

618
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,460
um obviously if the interview went

619
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:13,100
well and they're happy with how

620
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:14,629
it came out and they're sharing it

621
00:16:14,629 --> 00:16:16,179
with people in their audience and

622
00:16:16,179 --> 00:16:17,500
their friends and whatnot

623
00:16:17,539 --> 00:16:19,330
that's a prime opportunity to

624
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:21,299
upsell that client and increase

625
00:16:21,299 --> 00:16:23,210
their ltv so not even just retain

626
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:23,500
them

627
00:16:23,539 --> 00:16:26,559
but increase their ltv um so this

628
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:28,950
is some a missed opportunity i see

629
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:30,179
a lot of the times

630
00:16:30,259 --> 00:16:31,389
right i can't tell you how many

631
00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:32,720
times i've gotten someone on a

632
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,659
client ascension case study

633
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:35,259
interview

634
00:16:35,299 --> 00:16:36,899
and then upsold them into our

635
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:39,629
mastermind offer right um so make

636
00:16:39,629 --> 00:16:42,059
sure to do this and then for your

637
00:16:42,059 --> 00:16:42,460
own

638
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,450
uh social media strategy this is a

639
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:46,289
great post that should go on all

640
00:16:46,289 --> 00:16:47,659
of your social medias

641
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,789
this is also an asset that should

642
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:53,850
exist forever in perpetuity and so

643
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:55,340
that should go to your website or

644
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:57,500
landing page or uh vsl

645
00:16:57,539 --> 00:17:00,200
so if you're remaking your vsl be

646
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,259
sure to include it and then just

647
00:17:02,259 --> 00:17:03,740
in general on your landing page or

648
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:03,820
on

649
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:05,740
your website add it um so that

650
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:07,900
you're just keeping track of all

651
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,980
the case studies you have over

652
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:10,299
time

653
00:17:10,338 --> 00:17:12,369
you should also send it as an

654
00:17:12,369 --> 00:17:14,740
email broadcast again to both

655
00:17:14,848 --> 00:17:17,660
existing clients and to prospects

656
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:17,930
in your

657
00:17:18,019 --> 00:17:19,440
pipeline again with existing

658
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,950
clients just showing them that

659
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:23,059
other people with your services

660
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:23,710
are getting

661
00:17:23,779 --> 00:17:25,950
results and achieving um success

662
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:27,848
is going to encourage them to

663
00:17:27,848 --> 00:17:30,380
continue on um even if results are

664
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:30,859
not as

665
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,339
great now and then obviously for

666
00:17:32,339 --> 00:17:33,819
prospects they'll be able to see

667
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:35,259
that hey like you just helped

668
00:17:35,259 --> 00:17:35,579
another

669
00:17:35,619 --> 00:17:37,680
person out right case studies as

670
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,670
daniel points out in a lot of his

671
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:42,140
modules and trainings are one of

672
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:42,220
the

673
00:17:42,259 --> 00:17:44,869
most powerful tools and assets to

674
00:17:44,869 --> 00:17:47,269
um to uh sales and marketing right

675
00:17:47,289 --> 00:17:49,339
the number of case studies you

676
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:50,579
collect are like in direct

677
00:17:50,579 --> 00:17:51,940
proportion the number of new

678
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:53,509
clients you're probably going to

679
00:17:53,619 --> 00:17:54,700
sign so you

680
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,569
want to make people in your funnel

681
00:17:56,569 --> 00:17:58,430
and in your sales process aware of

682
00:17:58,430 --> 00:17:59,900
these case studies right

683
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,420
because just recording the case

684
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:03,000
study does not accomplish all the

685
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,700
objectives it only accomplishes

686
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:04,980
one

687
00:18:06,259 --> 00:18:08,809
um and then really after that make

688
00:18:08,809 --> 00:18:11,269
a lot more money that's pretty it

689
00:18:11,269 --> 00:18:14,140
this is pretty much it um the

690
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:16,160
objectives of before the during

691
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,009
and the after and if you want to

692
00:18:18,009 --> 00:18:19,740
see this in action you can go to

693
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:20,380
my

694
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:23,299
playlist on youtube it's got uh 54

695
00:18:23,299 --> 00:18:25,869
case study interviews um they're

696
00:18:25,869 --> 00:18:27,740
all using and implementing the

697
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:28,009
exact

698
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:30,039
strategy that i just walked you

699
00:18:30,039 --> 00:18:31,559
guys through and so like i

700
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:35,579
obviously implement this um i i

701
00:18:35,579 --> 00:18:35,769
practice

702
00:18:36,019 --> 00:18:37,569
what i preach i'm not just telling

703
00:18:37,569 --> 00:18:38,980
you guys a theory like if you go

704
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:40,779
on my youtube channel like just in

705
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:43,950
the past um month literally just

706
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:46,869
in the past month i've done one

707
00:18:46,869 --> 00:18:51,390
two three four five six seven

708
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:51,960
eight

709
00:18:52,019 --> 00:18:53,849
nine ten case study interviews on

710
00:18:53,849 --> 00:18:55,720
my youtube channel ten case study

711
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,420
interviews on my youtube channel

712
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:57,660
in the

713
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,559
last month and so i implement this

714
00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:01,240
up i know it works i know it gets

715
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,619
views i know it also gets

716
00:19:02,619 --> 00:19:03,339
conversions

717
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,940
right because those two things are

718
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:06,289
not the same um and daniel does

719
00:19:06,289 --> 00:19:07,509
these as well not as often

720
00:19:07,619 --> 00:19:09,119
um but when daniel does them

721
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:10,640
they're fire and so i highly

722
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,539
encourage you to check these out

723
00:19:12,539 --> 00:19:13,019
as well

724
00:19:13,059 --> 00:19:14,869
you'll see some recent ones in the

725
00:19:14,869 --> 00:19:16,710
past three months there's been um

726
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:18,460
three really really good ones

727
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,529
um daniel's a little more reserved

728
00:19:20,529 --> 00:19:22,470
in terms of like making sure that

729
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:24,279
the person he's interviewing

730
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:25,920
got insane results like how

731
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,519
chandler did three and a half

732
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:29,190
million dollars in one year with

733
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:29,819
cold email

734
00:19:29,859 --> 00:19:32,180
um i like to just find the great

735
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:34,829
stories and and more than just the

736
00:19:34,829 --> 00:19:37,019
results again get the story

737
00:19:37,059 --> 00:19:38,839
out um because that's really what

738
00:19:38,839 --> 00:19:40,660
sells and the sales team is giving

739
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:42,700
me this feedback uh as well

740
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:45,650
um and there's just so much you

741
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:47,890
could do with your case studies

742
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:50,140
you can create so many assets if

743
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:50,539
you go to

744
00:19:50,579 --> 00:19:53,440
my uh twitter account um and just

745
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,109
look at my pin message like i'm

746
00:19:56,109 --> 00:19:59,819
i'm repurposing my uh case study

747
00:19:59,859 --> 00:20:01,269
interviews all the time um like

748
00:20:01,269 --> 00:20:02,549
this one right here like the

749
00:20:02,549 --> 00:20:04,380
biggest misconception about client

750
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,829
ascension is that you need to be

751
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:07,549
at least at 10k to join that's not

752
00:20:07,549 --> 00:20:09,180
true am and join at 2k and scale

753
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:09,339
to

754
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:12,009
93k max join at 0 and scale to 50

755
00:20:12,009 --> 00:20:14,150
max join at 5 and scale to 50k

756
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:16,220
these are all links to the case

757
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:16,539
study

758
00:20:16,579 --> 00:20:18,390
interviews right so i use case

759
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:20,240
study interviews all over the

760
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,880
place we also have a school

761
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:22,619
community

762
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:24,309
which is like our lower ticket

763
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,000

you've

786
00:20:57,619 --> 00:20:59,400
done the work already to create it

787
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,019
in the first place and then the

788
00:21:01,019 --> 00:21:02,670
law of reciprocity this is the

789
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:02,859
thing

790
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,789
i'll end it with if someone asks

791
00:21:04,789 --> 00:21:06,720
you to do a case study interview

792
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,380
for their services and you're

793
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:08,619
happy

794
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:10,990
with their service and the results

795
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:13,160
that they helped you to achieve um

796
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,019
say yes and and like i said here

797
00:21:15,059 --> 00:21:16,640
maybe i'll be reaching out to you

798
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,829
soon uh to do a case study

799
00:21:17,829 --> 00:21:20,460
interview but say yes i see people

800
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:20,750
all the

801
00:21:20,819 --> 00:21:22,640
time that like would never do a

802
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,880
case study interview they've never

803
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,859
done um a testimonial for someone

804
00:21:26,859 --> 00:21:27,180
else

805
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,500
even though other people have

806
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,920
provided them good services and

807
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,900
then they get mad when they do a

808
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:31,990
bunch

809
00:21:32,099 --> 00:21:33,579
of outreach to their clients and

810
00:21:33,579 --> 00:21:35,160
none of their clients are willing

811
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,869
to do it so the law of reciprocity

812
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:38,200
say yes more often to your

813
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,880
existing service providers when

814
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,900
they reach out to Kate uh reach

815
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:42,460
out for case

816
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,049
studies and when you reach out

817
00:21:44,049 --> 00:21:45,559
when the time comes for you to

818
00:21:45,559 --> 00:21:47,259
reach out um even if it's not to

819
00:21:47,259 --> 00:21:47,500
them

820
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:49,180
specifically it's just the law of

821
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,799
reciprocity um more people will

822
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:52,220
say yes to you so if you say yes

823
00:21:52,259 --> 00:21:54,039
to more people more people will

824
00:21:54,039 --> 00:21:55,789
say yes to you this is a truth of

825
00:21:55,789 --> 00:21:57,579
life it applies literally to

826
00:21:57,579 --> 00:21:58,539
everything

827
00:21:58,579 --> 00:22:00,660
and so uh take that part seriously

828
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:02,710
but anyways that's how to conduct

829
00:22:02,819 --> 00:22:04,279

830
00:22:04,339 --> 00:22:06,220
