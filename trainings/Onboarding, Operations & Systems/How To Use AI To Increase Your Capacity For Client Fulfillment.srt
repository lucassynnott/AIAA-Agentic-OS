1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,100
So this presentation is just

2
00:00:01,209 --> 00:00:03,029
called how to implement ai to

3
00:00:03,319 --> 00:00:05,540
increase capacity without hiring

4
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:07,629
more people um and you guys know

5
00:00:07,629 --> 00:00:09,710
me just from previous events and

6
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:11,599
and content and i'm big on

7
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:13,070
talent in hiring people like

8
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,730
that's what i like to teach on and

9
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:16,980
that's what i like to do so this

10
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,109
sounds like off-brand um but it's

11
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:21,109
not what you think it's not like

12
00:00:21,109 --> 00:00:22,949
one of those go replace your

13
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,589
entire workforce with ai agents

14
00:00:24,649 --> 00:00:26,210
because i just don't believe in

15
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,820
that um so it's going to be high

16
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,570
level and i think you guys are

17
00:00:29,589 --> 00:00:31,339
going to get a lot out of this so

18
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:33,350
we'll just dive straight into it

19
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:33,600
so

20
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,479
i call this like the ai capacity

21
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:37,390
revolution so like the biggest

22
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:39,390
problem you guys are going to run

23
00:00:39,469 --> 00:00:39,740
into

24
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:41,420
especially after implementing

25
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:43,210
everything you learned here today

26
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:44,719
from pager and christian on

27
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:45,119
partnerships

28
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:47,640
from daniel on ads and challenges

29
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,890
and from dan on sales is you can

30
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:52,039
sign a bunch of clients a new

31
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:53,929
business now but how are you going

32
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:55,829
to fulfill right what happens for

33
00:00:55,829 --> 00:00:57,719
a lot of you guys is

34
00:00:57,719 --> 00:00:59,159
you hit a capacity wall and i've

35
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:00,479
heard this from so many of you

36
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:01,890
guys it's like oh i'm doing so

37
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:02,280
well

38
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,719
that i had to stop taking on

39
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:05,349
clients and it's like okay well

40
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:07,319
that's not good and they're like

41
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:07,680
bragging

42
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,430
about it well hitting a capacity

43
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:11,079
wall is like actually the most

44
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:13,379
dangerous thing you can do in your

45
00:01:13,379 --> 00:01:13,799
business

46
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:15,510
and so it's my job and in my

47
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:17,829
businesses and also as one of your

48
00:01:17,829 --> 00:01:19,920
guys's coaches to help you get

49
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:20,010
past

50
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,620
this capacity wall and plan ahead

51
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:24,909
for an influx of growth make sense

52
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:29,900
okay so the way i think of ai is

53
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:32,319
not a replacement of talent it's a

54
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:34,469
replacement of or sorry it's a

55
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:37,019
compliment actually to talent it's

56
00:01:37,019 --> 00:01:37,109
a

57
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,909
compliment to a smart hiring

58
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:40,769
process and so we all know like

59
00:01:40,769 --> 00:01:42,849
new hires like that process takes

60
00:01:42,849 --> 00:01:43,319
a long

61
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:44,420
time and it really is not

62
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:45,900
something that you should rush

63
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,400
like obviously if there's a need

64
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,180
and you need to

65
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:49,650
fill a gap like speed third and

66
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:51,480
prioritize that over anything else

67
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,750
but you still have to source

68
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,469
you still have to vet you still

69
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,109
have to onboard and you know dan

70
00:01:56,219 --> 00:01:58,140
just gave a great presentation on

71
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:58,260
how

72
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:00,120
to properly onboard like there's a

73
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,939
lot of work involved in doing that

74
00:02:01,939 --> 00:02:04,040
process properly and so

75
00:02:04,099 --> 00:02:06,390
while we know that's true how can

76
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:08,669
we create capacity real quick if

77
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:10,300
there's a need for it well

78
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:12,930
we can use ai and we can implement

79
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:15,500
ai immediately much lower barrier

80
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,520
than going and hiring new talent

81
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,409
to increase the capacity of your

82
00:02:19,409 --> 00:02:21,050
existing team to handle more

83
00:02:21,129 --> 00:02:23,110
client work and i'll show you some

84
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,979
actual examples on how we do that

85
00:02:24,979 --> 00:02:26,860
at some of our businesses so again

86
00:02:26,969 --> 00:02:28,560
the result of this is not that

87
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,719
you never have to hire talent ever

88
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:32,650
again and replace your entire

89
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:34,770
company with a hundred percent ai

90
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:35,360
agents

91
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,000
because talent acquisition is

92
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,159
always going to be the top

93
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,159
priority like someone was asking

94
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:40,719
me a question

95
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:42,969
last night for like list kit we

96
00:02:42,969 --> 00:02:44,879
just brought in uh someone to

97
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,639
essentially replace myself as like

98
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:48,030
managing the cs team and i think

99
00:02:48,069 --> 00:02:49,409
it was george he's like okay like

100
00:02:49,449 --> 00:02:51,199
how are you going to step into the

101
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:52,879
the ceo role now like what's your

102
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,509
top priority and i told him it's

103
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,080
talent acquisition and i think

104
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,909
that's like so important as like a

105
00:02:57,909 --> 00:02:59,360
leader or an executive of a

106
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,520
company is talent acquisition so

107
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:01,860
that

108
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:03,590
doesn't go away it's just how can

109
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:05,210
we buy back some of our time that

110
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,439
we're spending in other places

111
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:09,189
so that we can actually take our

112
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,090
time with talent acquisition and

113
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:12,960
do it properly and not feel rushed

114
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:16,960
okay so one of the things that

115
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,169
really changed my perspective on

116
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:20,969
ai because i was pretty i was

117
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:22,830
pretty hesitant to implement it

118
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:24,620
for a while um and and especially

119
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:26,289
just being on like linkedin and

120
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:26,719
twitter

121
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:28,969
you'll scroll through the timeline

122
00:03:28,969 --> 00:03:30,449
and just see like so much

123
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,919
engagement bait of like this ai

124
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:33,759
prompt you

125
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:35,669
know completely got rid of my

126
00:03:35,669 --> 00:03:37,659
entire workforce and it's just

127
00:03:37,729 --> 00:03:39,960
it's really distracting and to be

128
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:40,240
quite

129
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,990
honest like i'm even guilty of

130
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:43,949
like feeling fomo reading some of

131
00:03:43,949 --> 00:03:45,680
those things like oh what am i

132
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,150
doing wrong or where am i not

133
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:49,110
implementing ai in the right areas

134
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:50,860
but you you scroll through and a

135
00:03:50,909 --> 00:03:51,120
lot of

136
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,629
it's just noise but one of the

137
00:03:53,629 --> 00:03:56,449
things that was not noise was the

138
00:03:56,449 --> 00:03:59,280
shopify ceo um he put out actually

139
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,870
he didn't mean to put it out it

140
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:02,270
was just supposed to be an

141
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:04,400
internal memo to his existing team

142
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:04,639
but it

143
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:06,340
got leaked um and people tried to

144
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:07,439
leak it and put like a negative

145
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,599
spin to it but he actually just

146
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:09,819
came

147
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,430
out and posted the entire thing

148
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:12,960
and said hey like i saw this got

149
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:14,800
leaked it'll actually be helpful

150
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:14,960
for

151
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,920
anyone that runs a business in

152
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,050
this new ai revolution and like

153
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:21,350
the main line or i think the

154
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,949
title of the memo is that

155
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:24,720
reflexive ai usage is now a

156
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,970
baseline expectation and what he

157
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:27,829
means by that is

158
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:29,699
just like you use ai as a default

159
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:31,370
the same way you log in and use

160
00:04:31,449 --> 00:04:33,360
google to search things right it's

161
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:33,519
just

162
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:34,870
you don't even think about it you

163
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:36,170
just use google because that's

164
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:38,089
what you've always done and so in

165
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:38,319
an

166
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:41,079
organization ai should be used the

167
00:04:41,149 --> 00:04:43,569
same way so i'm not an ai expert

168
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,839
and none of you guys have to be

169
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:47,319
either and that's not something

170
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:48,889
you have to like become to be able

171
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:50,639
to implement what we're going to

172
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,319
talk about today you just do what

173
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:54,019
you always do with the talent you

174
00:04:54,019 --> 00:04:55,600
have it's just you pass it on to

175
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,430
them and you leverage your

176
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,769
existing talent to lead the charge

177
00:04:59,939 --> 00:05:02,319
of implementing ai the same way

178
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:04,139
shopify talks about doing it so

179
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:05,959
the the other key takeaway from

180
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:07,759
this is like understanding like

181
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:08,079
again

182
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:10,220
ai is not going to replace your

183
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:12,250
entire talent base right ai is

184
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:13,990
just going to be a force

185
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:15,120
multiplier for

186
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,720
your best people to get more and

187
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,370
more meaningful work done um and

188
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:23,279
this this was a quote directly out

189
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:23,360
of

190
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,750
the memo as well and you guys

191
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:26,430
should read the memo it's not that

192
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,240
long it's on uh twitter just look

193
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:28,399
up

194
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:30,779
toby luke uh shopify memo for ai

195
00:05:30,779 --> 00:05:33,379
and he says before asking for more

196
00:05:33,379 --> 00:05:36,399
headcount teams must demonstrate

197
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:38,490
why they cannot get done what they

198
00:05:38,509 --> 00:05:40,550
need to get done using ai and it's

199
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:42,370
like why can't we just implement

200
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:44,000
that in all of our organizations

201
00:05:44,009 --> 00:05:45,529
it's actually really simple as

202
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,970
soon as i saw the memo posted i

203
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:47,519
basically

204
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:48,980
digested it rewrote a really

205
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,319
similar version of it for myself

206
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:52,399
and implemented that list kit on

207
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:52,769
that next

208
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,519
team meeting and they loved it it

209
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:56,120
was so cool to see because ai is

210
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,680
exciting like ai is true

211
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,949
innovation and people want to be a

212
00:05:58,949 --> 00:06:00,079
part of that they don't want to

213
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:02,240
miss out um and so how do you

214
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,639
implement this at your company

215
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,759
well one ai has to become the

216
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:09,490
expectation not just a suggestion

217
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,720
um

218
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,069
every team member needs to

219
00:06:12,069 --> 00:06:13,779
contribute ai inspired ideas for

220
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,600
improvement and i'll show you like

221
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:15,899
actually

222
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,970
tactically how to do that um and

223
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:20,019
this applies to everyone and as

224
00:06:20,019 --> 00:06:22,000
you guys have heard me teach on

225
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,709
especially when we talk leadership

226
00:06:23,709 --> 00:06:25,180
like it starts with you right so

227
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:27,180
like even if you're not a very

228
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,060
technical person and even if

229
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,990
you've never used ai before at

230
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:33,120
least try and lead by example and

231
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:33,360
see

232
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,129
how your team follows suit right

233
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:38,870
and so the first thing that i

234
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:41,370
think uh is is important to do

235
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:41,759
it's

236
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,509
like you can get so bogged down

237
00:06:43,509 --> 00:06:45,220
and distracted again by just

238
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:47,069
scrolling through twitter and

239
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:47,839
scrolling

240
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:49,670
through linkedin and seeing all

241
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:51,560
the different ways companies are

242
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,430
are like implementing ai to save

243
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:53,920
themselves

244
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,879
the most time most of that stuff

245
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:58,009
is not relevant for you right it

246
00:06:58,009 --> 00:06:59,680
sounds cool and it's like again

247
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,360
you get that sense of fomo but

248
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,329
it's really just not relevant for

249
00:07:03,329 --> 00:07:05,360
you so how do you implement ai in

250
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,829
a way that is relevant and helpful

251
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:08,480
for you and your business and your

252
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,800
team specifically we go back to

253
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,649
the 72 hour task audit right the

254
00:07:12,649 --> 00:07:14,509
72 hour task audit is something

255
00:07:14,509 --> 00:07:16,050
that you've heard me talk about

256
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:18,009
multiple times before and it's not

257
00:07:18,009 --> 00:07:19,540
just you doing it you should

258
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,600
actually have your team do this as

259
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,350
well okay and it's really simple

260
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:25,089
it's just ask your team and you do

261
00:07:25,089 --> 00:07:26,720
it with them right as a leader you

262
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,540
you go first and so you have them

263
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:30,589
document everything that they're

264
00:07:30,589 --> 00:07:32,920
doing within a 72 hour time period

265
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:34,439
then you have them categorize it

266
00:07:34,529 --> 00:07:36,089
into buckets what are things that

267
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:37,519
give you energy or drain your

268
00:07:37,709 --> 00:07:38,209
energy

269
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,709
what are things that are revenue

270
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:41,009
generating or just administrative

271
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,800
work and what are things that

272
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,209
require your human input

273
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,990
input or things that are just

274
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,509
extremely repeatable like george

275
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,810
was just telling me before i came

276
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:49,199
up to

277
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:50,810
present that he he didn't use ai

278
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:52,360
actually he used a really cool

279
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:54,240
thing in excel that's similar to

280
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:54,639
ai

281
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,449
where identify specific keywords

282
00:07:56,449 --> 00:07:58,339
that need to be highlighted in an

283
00:07:58,339 --> 00:08:00,399
excel sheet with like 15 000

284
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:00,839
records

285
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,509
and before it's just a human going

286
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:04,050
through and trying to find those

287
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,600
and it's like that's definitely

288
00:08:05,769 --> 00:08:05,920
not

289
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,300
giving them energy that's

290
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,689
definitely not revenue generating

291
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,480
and that's definitely not

292
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,279
requiring their

293
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:13,230
human judgment because a bot could

294
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:14,899
do it and so that falls into the

295
00:08:14,899 --> 00:08:17,439
perfect use case of let's use ai

296
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:17,480
to

297
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:19,709
replace this super strenuous task

298
00:08:19,709 --> 00:08:21,689
that someone internally is doing

299
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:23,720
and the benefits of ai are not

300
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:24,720
just to save

301
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,649
you time and to delegate things

302
00:08:26,649 --> 00:08:28,750
that the team member doesn't need

303
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,689
to be doing anymore but it's also

304
00:08:30,769 --> 00:08:31,970
to lock in

305
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,720
consistent quality across the

306
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,679
board because i was telling george

307
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,759
like what is the human error

308
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:38,200
involved with

309
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,940
that task you assigned like that

310
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:41,450
person if they're just doing

311
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:43,029
brainless work for hours like

312
00:08:43,029 --> 00:08:43,600
they're

313
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,820
gonna make mistakes but like an ai

314
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:47,720
is not going to make mistakes

315
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,759
right and that peace of mind helps

316
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:51,200
you as an operator and a leader

317
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,450
not have to get caught up in

318
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:53,779
things that are not revenue

319
00:08:53,779 --> 00:08:54,330
producing

320
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,250
and so every time we do a 72 72

321
00:08:57,799 --> 00:09:00,259
hour task audit we find so many

322
00:09:00,259 --> 00:09:02,500
tasks that could be streamlined

323
00:09:02,549 --> 00:09:03,759
especially now

324
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:05,720
in the lens of using ai and one of

325
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,509
the things that i like to do as

326
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:10,159
well on a daily occurrence because

327
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:10,240
i

328
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,710
mentioned how do you get your team

329
00:09:11,809 --> 00:09:13,049
members to contribute ai inspired

330
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:15,360
ideas i implement what

331
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,740
we call a daily kaizen and we

332
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,250
learned this actually at the the

333
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:19,929
same sdr company that dan talked

334
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:20,320
about

335
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,789
earlier when we were working in

336
00:09:21,889 --> 00:09:23,110
our first row out of out of school

337
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:25,759
which is kaizen is just continuous

338
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:27,139
improvement look it up it's a

339
00:09:27,139 --> 00:09:28,659
business concept i think that the

340
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,309
japanese created big companies

341
00:09:30,309 --> 00:09:31,009
like toyota use

342
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:32,129
it all the time and it's really

343
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:33,360
simple it's just in your end of

344
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:34,559
day type forms with your team

345
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:35,519
members

346
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,570
simply pose the question what's

347
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:39,690
one thing you notice today that if

348
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,200
solved would make your work

349
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:41,720
smoother

350
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,940
and more efficient and if you

351
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:46,409
collect an answer to that question

352
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:50,360
five times a week from let's just

353
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:51,870
say 10 team members you now have

354
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:53,210
50 ideas on how you can implement

355
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,879
ai in a way that's actually

356
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:55,649
meaningful to

357
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:57,639
your team and organization not to

358
00:09:57,649 --> 00:09:59,470
just what twitter and linkedin

359
00:09:59,529 --> 00:10:01,759
find you know really exciting this

360
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:04,789
makes sense just clicking okay and

361
00:10:05,009 --> 00:10:06,200
what you'll notice just to add on

362
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,519
to that is when you ask questions

363
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:08,970
like that people typically say the

364
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:10,279
same shape over and over and over

365
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:11,679
and over again yeah it's like fix

366
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:11,919
this

367
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:13,389
dude it's like yeah you're like

368
00:10:13,549 --> 00:10:15,100
okay i got the message and it's

369
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,039
the same thing when customers ask

370
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:17,100
the

371
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,009
same question on a sales call you

372
00:10:19,009 --> 00:10:20,830
know back to back to back to back

373
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:22,370
you know we spend an entire

374
00:10:22,419 --> 00:10:22,710
training

375
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,190
session just focusing on that

376
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:26,179
question or that objection right

377
00:10:26,179 --> 00:10:27,679
so we got to do the same with

378
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:30,080
our team um and so this identifies

379
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,750
opportunities and bottlenecks that

380
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,720
we can implement ai to help

381
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,470
improve um and the small things

382
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:38,169
like the small things that you

383
00:10:38,169 --> 00:10:39,909
don't think actually matter

384
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:41,850
compound over time when you do

385
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:44,799
this daily um and it's also on you

386
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:46,399
to show them like how it

387
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:47,169
eliminates the

388
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,529
the least fulfilling parts of

389
00:10:48,529 --> 00:10:49,970
their job right because again like

390
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:51,370
ai is supposed to get rid of

391
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,399
the tasks that drain their energy

392
00:10:53,409 --> 00:10:55,230
and if we can get rid of tasks for

393
00:10:55,289 --> 00:10:57,120
team members that drain their

394
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:57,519
energy

395
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:00,419
like how much more fulfilled are

396
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,110
they when they show up to work and

397
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,120
how does that contribute to the

398
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,809
actual tasks that we need them to

399
00:11:06,809 --> 00:11:08,440
be doing right if i'm coming off

400
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,919
the back of what george was

401
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:10,159
telling

402
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:11,500
me he had one of his guys doing

403
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,929
reading through a spreadsheet

404
00:11:12,929 --> 00:11:14,559
trying to find specific words to

405
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,039
highlight

406
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:17,679
like i'm brain dead after an hour

407
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:20,399
so if i'm then pulled into a high

408
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:21,919
level task that actually needs

409
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:22,639
human input

410
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:24,759
it's not going to get done at the

411
00:11:24,769 --> 00:11:26,990
same quality standard as if they

412
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:28,610
were fresh and energized with

413
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:30,000
other work that they were doing

414
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,399
before oh and quick action item

415
00:11:31,429 --> 00:11:33,120
it's super simple you guys can do

416
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:33,210
this

417
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,740
literally today or right now on

418
00:11:34,789 --> 00:11:36,129
your phones or on your computers

419
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:37,970
like create a slack channel in

420
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:39,120
your organization

421
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,149
for your team to literally just

422
00:11:42,149 --> 00:11:43,759
talk about ai that's it like

423
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:45,570
literally just call the channel

424
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,120
like list kit ai or your company's

425
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,549
name dash ai add your entire team

426
00:11:50,549 --> 00:11:52,320
and share with them this

427
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,429
presentation

428
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,269
and just make it again with toby

429
00:11:55,269 --> 00:11:57,159
luke from shopify one of the most

430
00:11:57,159 --> 00:11:58,690
successful and fastest growing

431
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,190
companies in the world the

432
00:12:00,289 --> 00:12:02,720
standard right reflexive ai usage

433
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,950
is the standard it's not you know

434
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:06,549
uh

435
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,740
some something that we just do

436
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:12,210
here and there okay so i'm going

437
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:14,610
to get into team structure for a

438
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:14,879
minute

439
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:16,230
here because i think the

440
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:18,269
foundation of what you're bringing

441
00:12:18,269 --> 00:12:20,059
ai into is more important than

442
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:20,559
just bringing

443
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:22,519
ai in just to say you know can

444
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,730
check the box off so we talk about

445
00:12:24,899 --> 00:12:27,039
this uh as well on olympia and in

446
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:27,120
some

447
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,600
of the previous presentations

448
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:29,809
we've given but how do you

449
00:12:29,809 --> 00:12:31,019
structure your team right

450
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,370
especially as you grow so

451
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,360
like i have like the the customer

452
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:36,470
success team at list kit that's a

453
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:38,190
department but inside of the

454
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,830
department of customer success

455
00:12:39,889 --> 00:12:41,509
there's teams and there's teams

456
00:12:41,559 --> 00:12:43,360
for onboarding there's teams for

457
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,730
ongoing engagement there's teams

458
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:47,899
for tech support and so each team

459
00:12:47,899 --> 00:12:50,240
essentially is three to five

460
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:50,559
people

461
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:52,029
working together okay and it's the

462
00:12:52,129 --> 00:12:53,580
same way dan describes sales and i

463
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:54,730
love coming off the back of

464
00:12:54,879 --> 00:12:56,350
dan's presentation because this

465
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:57,649
stuff is like it it translates

466
00:12:57,769 --> 00:12:59,049
really well it's like you have a

467
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,240
team of sdrs

468
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,710
and you have a team of aes and

469
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:03,389
once those teams get too big you

470
00:13:03,559 --> 00:13:05,120
create pods right because you

471
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:05,360
never

472
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,830
want nine people on one team

473
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,000
because it's too strenuous for one

474
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,559
manager to keep all nine of them

475
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:13,659
on kpi so you break it off you do

476
00:13:13,659 --> 00:13:15,269
the same in in uh customer

477
00:13:15,269 --> 00:13:17,279
successor for you guys i keep

478
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:17,960
saying customer

479
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,220
success that's a sas term for you

480
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,519
guys it's just fulfillment right

481
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:25,230
if you're running client services

482
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:27,090
businesses it's it's just

483
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:29,330
fulfillment um is all that means

484
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:32,399
and so not only do you have to

485
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:33,299
implement

486
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,830
the proper structure for your team

487
00:13:34,929 --> 00:13:36,120
but you also need these teams

488
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,840
working well together because this

489
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,669
is where ai can really come into

490
00:13:39,669 --> 00:13:41,590
your organization have an effect

491
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:43,360
on the culture so how do they work

492
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,679
well together well again dan

493
00:13:44,679 --> 00:13:46,129
outlined this masterfully on the

494
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,730
sales side and it just applies to

495
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:47,970
everything

496
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,470
else daily huddles weekly team

497
00:13:49,629 --> 00:13:51,519
meetings with specific kpi updates

498
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:53,250
i promise i didn't use dan's

499
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,970
presentation as a cheat sheet but

500
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:56,049
like you see how this translates

501
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,320
um and a clearly identified team

502
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,090
leader right are essential before

503
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:04,200
ai can really amplify your team's

504
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,240
capacity and then one of the

505
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,960
things that you guys know me

506
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,899
really well for at this point is

507
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:12,440
performance-based pay right like i

508
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:12,720
don't

509
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,679
believe in just paying someone to

510
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:16,629
fulfill client work and get paid a

511
00:14:16,679 --> 00:14:17,840
base salary it to me it just

512
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,080
doesn't

513
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,879
make sense i think it's not the

514
00:14:19,879 --> 00:14:21,960
smartest way to do it for you and

515
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,000
for the team members especially

516
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,059
if they're an a player in their

517
00:14:26,059 --> 00:14:28,399
past history is performance like

518
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:30,799
they they perform right so they

519
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:32,179
don't want to be capped to some

520
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:33,570
preset salary or retainer that

521
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:35,840
they make every single month so

522
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,659
when pay and this is so great for

523
00:14:37,659 --> 00:14:40,240
ai especially because when pay is

524
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,039
tied to results and performance

525
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,889
it's not ours that becomes the

526
00:14:44,889 --> 00:14:47,269
focus like i don't care if my team

527
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:49,759
works 40 hours or 30 hours a week

528
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:51,850
i care what my team is producing

529
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:53,929
and getting done right and so if

530
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,919
they can use ai to get more done

531
00:14:55,919 --> 00:14:55,960
it

532
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,669
becomes their best friend so let's

533
00:14:57,669 --> 00:14:58,789
look at one of the first real

534
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,610
examples that i prepared for you

535
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:02,019
guys student success coaches at

536
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:03,429
client ascension you guys all have

537
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:04,809
worked with a student success

538
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,379
coach before right and so student

539
00:15:07,379 --> 00:15:09,529
success coaches that's a role

540
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,759
where we have to hire more student

541
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:13,720
success coaches if we want to sign

542
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,470
more students into the client

543
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:17,120
ascension program right because

544
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,210
there's capacity i can't just give

545
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:20,909
all of you guys to one student

546
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:22,879
success coach and expect that the

547
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:24,629
standard is going to be where we

548
00:15:24,629 --> 00:15:26,159
need it to be right so like we

549
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,129
measure capacity over time to say

550
00:15:28,169 --> 00:15:28,799
okay

551
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:30,549
student success coaches can manage

552
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:32,840
maybe 40 students at a time right

553
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,000
so if i want 400 students

554
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:36,610
in client ascension i need 10

555
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:38,330
student success coaches now that's

556
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,610
a really hard role to hire for

557
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:41,740
sourcing candidates like it's a

558
00:15:41,799 --> 00:15:43,889
high barrier role because you're

559
00:15:43,889 --> 00:15:45,970
giving them the relationship right

560
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,610
they need to know the business

561
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:48,870
they need to know the course

562
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:50,399
content they have to be there for

563
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:50,720
a long

564
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,190
time imagine replacing a student

565
00:15:52,289 --> 00:15:54,019
success coach that has 60 client

566
00:15:54,039 --> 00:15:55,289
accounts and relationships

567
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:55,899
attached to

568
00:15:55,919 --> 00:15:57,389
them that's that's hard to do so

569
00:15:57,389 --> 00:15:58,740
you have to really take your time

570
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,720
in the hiring process to get rid

571
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:00,799
of

572
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:03,019
that risk but you can't do that if

573
00:16:03,019 --> 00:16:04,840
daniel cracks the code on a

574
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,009
challenge and finds out how to get

575
00:16:07,559 --> 00:16:07,600
30

576
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,190
people signed up in a three-day

577
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:10,860
span which we literally had last

578
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:12,559
month that was the capacity for

579
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:14,029
one student success coach and we

580
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:15,580
signed that amount of students in

581
00:16:15,879 --> 00:16:18,000
literally three days and so this

582
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,080
is

583
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,740
where ai's become my best friend

584
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:21,399
as you know someone that has to go

585
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:22,559
out and do the hiring

586
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:25,059
uh so let's take an ssc right sscs

587
00:16:25,059 --> 00:16:27,110
get paid per student under

588
00:16:27,309 --> 00:16:29,679
management plus bonuses for

589
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:30,230
generating

590
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,690
things like case studies referrals

591
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:33,009
and orchestrating upsells because

592
00:16:33,009 --> 00:16:34,409
it's not just about taking on as

593
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,070
many students it's about doing it

594
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,559
to the quality standard that we

595
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:40,559
need to ensure so they want to

596
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:41,950
use ai to handle more students

597
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:43,610
obviously right because it's going

598
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:45,600
to make them more money um

599
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,980
and so that's like why

600
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:50,090
performance-based pay it just goes

601
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:51,289
so perfectly with with

602
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:52,919
implementing ai um

603
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,080
the last one here is just never

604
00:16:55,159 --> 00:16:57,289
stop sales velocity right um like

605
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:59,200
the biggest mistake again that i

606
00:16:59,200 --> 00:16:59,320
see

607
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,840
you guys make or just businesses

608
00:17:00,929 --> 00:17:02,129
in general especially the ones

609
00:17:02,129 --> 00:17:03,720
that come through our coaching

610
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,240
programs

611
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,900
is daniel dan and christian's

612
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,420
content is so good that they

613
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:09,359
figure out real quick how to sign

614
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,019
clients

615
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:11,880
and they're just not ready for it

616
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,650
and so they have to quote unquote

617
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:15,119
pause sales right they're always

618
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:17,299
like oh yeah i'm pausing sales to

619
00:17:17,299 --> 00:17:19,650
you know fulfill for these clients

620
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:21,318
and that's always just like

621
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,828
sirens just go off in my brain

622
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:24,818
because instead of um like

623
00:17:24,818 --> 00:17:27,440
continuing the natural stream of

624
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:27,568
business

625
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:29,509
it's this continued stop start

626
00:17:29,509 --> 00:17:31,359
approach that completely kills all

627
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:33,200
momentum and i've seen it so many

628
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:33,519
times

629
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:35,109
where once you make the decision

630
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,400
to pause sales and stop the

631
00:17:36,839 --> 00:17:38,230
momentum that you took so long to

632
00:17:38,279 --> 00:17:38,700
build up

633
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,190
it's really hard to get back and

634
00:17:40,289 --> 00:17:41,789
sometimes you can't get it back

635
00:17:42,039 --> 00:17:43,119
fast enough to the point where

636
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:43,680
your business

637
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,750
actually completely dies off we've

638
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:46,490
seen it so many times

639
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,039
um and so

640
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:50,890
how do you never stop sales

641
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:52,829
velocity well you build a bench of

642
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:54,289
pre-vetted candidates so that you

643
00:17:54,339 --> 00:17:54,720
can tap

644
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,450
them in when you need them without

645
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:58,000
having to restart the hiring cycle

646
00:17:58,039 --> 00:18:00,480
right every single time but at the

647
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,740
at the same time you do what we're

648
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:02,849
talking about today which is

649
00:18:02,849 --> 00:18:03,599
implementing ai

650
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:05,880
to expand capacity with your

651
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,880
current team

652
00:18:08,079 --> 00:18:10,710
so the first thing before we get

653
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:13,220
into uh like actual use cases

654
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:15,309
there's a perception challenge

655
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:17,640
that i started to realize when i

656
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:19,150
talked more about ai

657
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,470
and you guys might relate to this

658
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,579
and your team will definitely

659
00:18:23,579 --> 00:18:25,170
relate to this and whether you

660
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:25,359
know

661
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:27,000
it or not this is important as a

662
00:18:27,009 --> 00:18:28,809
leader to understand before you

663
00:18:28,809 --> 00:18:30,160
bring ai into your culture

664
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,019
and so how do we break down this

665
00:18:32,019 --> 00:18:34,250
barrier right let's actually start

666
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,680
at the bottom like many employees

667
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:35,920
have

668
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,880
concerns about using ai tools

669
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,660
right because when ai first

670
00:18:39,769 --> 00:18:42,000
started a lot of times it was

671
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:42,559
labeled as

672
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,250
cutting corners or you're being

673
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:45,359
lazy because you're just

674
00:18:45,819 --> 00:18:47,519
outsourcing everything to chat gpt

675
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:47,920
so it had

676
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,299
this negative connotation to it

677
00:18:49,349 --> 00:18:50,690
don't use ai because then you're

678
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,880
just going to be seen as robotic

679
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,170
or lazy

680
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,099
right this is super relatable

681
00:18:55,099 --> 00:18:57,170
especially in higher education

682
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:59,410
it's like very transparent that

683
00:18:59,529 --> 00:19:00,430
like ai is

684
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,579
is completely not allowed like if

685
00:19:02,579 --> 00:19:04,380
you use ai like you're getting

686
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,640
expelled from this university you

687
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:06,680
guys

688
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:08,390
have heard this before right this

689
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:10,980
makes sense and so team members

690
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:13,759
are probably and i know that they

691
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:13,839
are

692
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:14,930
because i've had conversations

693
00:19:15,049 --> 00:19:16,099
about this but let's just say

694
00:19:16,099 --> 00:19:17,369
they're probably worrying about

695
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:18,410
their job security

696
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,960
number one because ai is advancing

697
00:19:20,049 --> 00:19:21,539
really fast and they're seeing the

698
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:23,049
same twitter and linkedin threads

699
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,950
that i mentioned earlier that's

700
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:26,720
like ai is going to replace this

701
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,880
you know cs role forever follow

702
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,349
this thread for you know exact

703
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:32,069
instructions on how to do it and

704
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:33,759
it's like it's not you know the

705
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:34,130
truth it's

706
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,589
just a bait um and it's also again

707
00:19:36,589 --> 00:19:38,730
a lot of times they worry that

708
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:40,369
they might be appearing to work

709
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,200
less

710
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,789
so these perceptions create

711
00:19:42,809 --> 00:19:44,299
barriers for effective ai

712
00:19:44,519 --> 00:19:46,119
implementation and so again the

713
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:46,880
way i see it i

714
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,309
don't care if my team works 40

715
00:19:49,309 --> 00:19:51,450
hours or 30 hours a week if

716
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:54,000
they're getting the same amount of

717
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:54,480
work

718
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,299
done right and again if we're

719
00:19:56,299 --> 00:19:58,579
focused on increasing capacity the

720
00:19:58,579 --> 00:20:00,680
goal isn't to get the same amount

721
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:00,880
of

722
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,269
work done it's to get more work

723
00:20:02,309 --> 00:20:03,670
done and the only reason the only

724
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:05,440
way you could get more work done

725
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:05,450
in

726
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:06,650
the same amount of time is by

727
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:07,920
doing what we're talking about

728
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:09,769
right buying back your time using

729
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:10,079
ai

730
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:11,559
so again i care about performance

731
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:12,849
so when you make this mindset

732
00:20:12,849 --> 00:20:14,160
shift first you have to make

733
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,980
this mindset shift and then you

734
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:17,519
help your team to make that

735
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:20,710
mindset shift ai becomes a tool

736
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:20,960
for

737
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,890
helping hit kpis that's it it's

738
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:24,670
not a tool to be lazy it's not a

739
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:26,640
tool to replace you and your role

740
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,809
it's your sidekick essentially

741
00:20:28,809 --> 00:20:30,799
right ai is a sidekick for your

742
00:20:30,809 --> 00:20:32,839
team it enables your team to hit

743
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:33,519
kpis

744
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:34,900
that's all it is and that's how

745
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:36,529
you should communicate it it's not

746
00:20:36,529 --> 00:20:38,769
to replace them um and

747
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:40,759
so we also need to reinforce this

748
00:20:40,849 --> 00:20:42,960
thought by making ai a celebrated

749
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,200
behavior in your organization so

750
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:45,359
one

751
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:47,140
thing we do at list kit that the

752
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:48,880
team loves is one of the guys in

753
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:52,609
client ascension uh tom avesar i

754
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:52,799
think

755
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:54,480
is his last name tom um he runs

756
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,319
like a 3d printing company so i

757
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:58,390
had him do a mock-up of like a 3d

758
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:58,720
printed

759
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,960
trophy for list kit and i told the

760
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,289
team whoever has the best and most

761
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:05,279
high impact ai idea this month

762
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:07,029
i'll ship you one of these ai or

763
00:21:07,029 --> 00:21:08,920
one of these um list kit trophies

764
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,720
and they love that so like they

765
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,470
see that i'm rewarding ai ideas

766
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:14,289
through something like a trophy

767
00:21:14,329 --> 00:21:16,309
right so it's super important and

768
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:16,400
you

769
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,240
can do it with like gift cards

770
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,410
cash bonuses or just

771
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,579
acknowledgement right um and so

772
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:22,369
again it's like

773
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,150
the hours versus results mindset

774
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:25,589
like i don't time track for a

775
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,279
reason because i don't care if you

776
00:21:27,279 --> 00:21:27,579
work

777
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:29,440
40 hours or 30 hours and if you

778
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,130
only work 30 hours and don't get

779
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,960
the results you don't get paid as

780
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,569
much

781
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:35,309
right so i don't pay by hour i pay

782
00:21:35,309 --> 00:21:37,500
by performance and that allows me

783
00:21:37,569 --> 00:21:39,569
to not have to be super in the

784
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:41,259
weeds tracking specific things

785
00:21:41,259 --> 00:21:42,809
that they're doing or not doing

786
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,170
before i get into the actual

787
00:21:44,359 --> 00:21:44,960
examples

788
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,049
like four ones that i've

789
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:47,730
specifically chosen for you guys

790
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:49,130
today that i think might be

791
00:21:49,299 --> 00:21:49,529
relevant

792
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,099
is this is this hitting so far

793
00:21:53,099 --> 00:21:55,849
this is valuable okay all i need

794
00:21:55,849 --> 00:21:58,480
is one it was funny during the

795
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,789
challenge like i do this all the

796
00:21:59,789 --> 00:22:00,740
time i have like an hour

797
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:02,220
presentation and like every 15

798
00:22:02,329 --> 00:22:02,650
minutes i'm

00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,680
like guys please like help myself

800
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,509
self-esteem just like put w's in

801
00:22:06,569 --> 00:22:08,400
the chat if this is if this is

802
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:08,799
anything

803
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:10,609
of value and it's just like www

804
00:22:10,609 --> 00:22:12,190
i'm like oh my god guys stop

805
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:13,880
you're gonna break the zoom

806
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:14,559
servers

807
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:16,519
and like it's just like stupid

808
00:22:16,599 --> 00:22:18,559
like that that works for b2c

809
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:20,759
offers or lower trade offers um

810
00:22:21,319 --> 00:22:22,480
but anyways

811
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,859
all right so let's let's go

812
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:25,690
through this first one so how many

813
00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:27,599
of you guys use slack

814
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:31,319
yeah not just use slack but like

815
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,410
live in slack yeah so the problem

816
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:36,569
right so this is the framework

817
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,309
right what's the problem well

818
00:22:38,349 --> 00:22:40,059
there's a billion messages in a

819
00:22:40,059 --> 00:22:41,900
million different channels and

820
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:42,240
threads

821
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,069
in slack and most of these

822
00:22:44,069 --> 00:22:46,410
actually contain tasks that gear

823
00:22:46,569 --> 00:22:48,400
that i guarantee are not getting

824
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:48,450
tracked

825
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:50,279
properly they're not actually

826
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:51,680
getting completed and they're

827
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:52,970
falling through the cracks

828
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:53,680
relatable

829
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,230
right and so what's the solution

830
00:22:57,230 --> 00:22:59,759
there's a an ai tool called chaser

831
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:02,640
okay in slack that you can add

832
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,559
as an app and it automatically

833
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,789
captures tasks and follows up with

834
00:23:06,789 --> 00:23:08,849
the assigned task owner until this

835
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:10,710
task assigned due date so really

836
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:12,430
cool simple tool that you guys can

837
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,920
go and install on slack like

838
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,509
literally right now it's called

839
00:23:15,559 --> 00:23:17,099
chaser it's super cheap i think

840
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,880
it's like 12 a user per month

841
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,079
and literally like they're like in

842
00:23:21,079 --> 00:23:23,180
our slack organization i think i

843
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:24,059
send like anywhere from

844
00:23:24,079 --> 00:23:25,470
seven to ten thousand slack

845
00:23:25,509 --> 00:23:26,980
messages a month just in list kit

846
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,559
slack and a lot of those things

847
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:29,039
are like

848
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:31,299
directives like do this or follow

849
00:23:31,299 --> 00:23:33,140
up on this or go fix this or go

850
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:36,640
implement this i'm assigning tasks

851
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,000
through slack and without chaser

852
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,210
my job would not be ceo executive

853
00:23:41,369 --> 00:23:42,849
it'd just be project management

854
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:44,369
coordinator that's what i was

855
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:45,789
doing for the longest time until i

856
00:23:45,789 --> 00:23:47,660
found chaser um and so how it

857
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:47,839
works

858
00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:49,309
when someone it identifies when

859
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:51,019
someone commits to a task and just

860
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,410
like any other ai tool it's not

861
00:23:52,589 --> 00:23:52,799
perfect

862
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:54,279
right you have to guide it towards

863
00:23:54,369 --> 00:23:55,569
what's actually a task what's

864
00:23:55,569 --> 00:23:56,970
worth tracking all this sort of

865
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:57,920
stuff

866
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,009
it automatically assigns and

867
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:00,500
tracks deadlines and if it doesn't

868
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,710
come up with a deadline you can

869
00:24:01,769 --> 00:24:02,099
manually

870
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,200
input it and it sends reminders

871
00:24:04,279 --> 00:24:06,410
before due dates right before like

872
00:24:06,579 --> 00:24:08,319
if i assigned a task in slack

873
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:10,480
i literally like write follow up

874
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,480
in a draft and then not send the

875
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,519
message so that i can check in my

876
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:15,359
drafts

877
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:16,839
two days later that i meant to

878
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:18,720
follow up on this task i assigned

879
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,190
right so like this saves me so

880
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:20,720
much time

881
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,920
um and it ensures that nothing

882
00:24:23,009 --> 00:24:24,329
gets lost or falls through the

883
00:24:24,759 --> 00:24:26,400
cracks right so what does this do

884
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:26,619
well

885
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,109
it allows you to manage your team

886
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:29,920
without micromanaging your team

887
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:33,119
make sense okay so

888
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:35,539
don't sign up until i find my

889
00:24:35,539 --> 00:24:37,690
affiliate link actually

890
00:24:37,839 --> 00:24:40,089
uh actually christian you you

891
00:24:40,089 --> 00:24:42,700
shared that one where's christian

892
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,480
you shared chaser with me right

893
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:46,730
you create an affiliate link and

894
00:24:46,759 --> 00:24:48,480
put an olympia and we'll split it

895
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,690
and we'll put it on white horse

896
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:52,480
today for the kentucky derby is

897
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,640
that what i saw that in slaps what

898
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,599
the is that

899
00:24:55,599 --> 00:24:59,509
yeah yeah yeah yeah burn burn them

900
00:24:59,559 --> 00:25:01,569
number nine horse throw throw

901
00:25:01,569 --> 00:25:02,720
whatever we get an affiliate

902
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,200
revenue on

903
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,720
that okay uh this one's super cool

904
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,970
again this this might be super

905
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:10,859
niche to client ascension but like

906
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,349
you guys are smart enough to like

907
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:13,680
see how we're doing things and

908
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,960
make it relevant to your

909
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:15,759
organization

910
00:25:15,759 --> 00:25:17,230
that's why this is like a high-end

911
00:25:17,329 --> 00:25:18,859
mastermind because you guys don't

912
00:25:19,079 --> 00:25:19,549
need to be told

913
00:25:19,599 --> 00:25:21,069
step by step by step by step what

914
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,809
exactly to do and how to run your

915
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,400
business which is what i love

916
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,990
because i could come here share

917
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:27,500
relevant ideas and see how you

918
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,970
guys go out and make them better

919
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:31,440
um but the offer creation boss so

920
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:33,690
this is a problem right creating

921
00:25:33,869 --> 00:25:36,079
offers that have a high likelihood

922
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:38,029
of actually converting is the top

923
00:25:38,029 --> 00:25:39,980
one percent of the top one percent

924
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:42,240
skill set that daniel has learned

925
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,619
over the course of being in

926
00:25:43,619 --> 00:25:45,259
business for over five years so

927
00:25:45,259 --> 00:25:47,279
the knowledge transfer that daniel

928
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:47,829
has

929
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:49,940
to the sscs to be able to create

930
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:52,319
and review offers for students is

931
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:54,960
a huge bottleneck like it just is

932
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,009
right he had hours upon hours with

933
00:25:57,009 --> 00:25:59,039
the student success coaches to to

934
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:00,930
make that knowledge transfer

935
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,039
um leading to long delays for

936
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:05,529
students right because if daniel's

937
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,359
the one that needs to review or

938
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:07,599
create

939
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:09,559
an offer daniel's doing other

940
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:11,759
things um and because of that it

941
00:26:11,769 --> 00:26:13,809
also leads to less desired student

942
00:26:14,359 --> 00:26:14,480
results

943
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,920
if it has to be the ssc who's

944
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,289
coming up with the offer because

945
00:26:17,799 --> 00:26:19,519
the sscs will be the first to tell

946
00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:19,599
you

947
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:20,690
they're not going to come up with

948
00:26:20,809 --> 00:26:21,839
as good of an offer as daniel

949
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:23,279
that's why they're not the offer

950
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:23,390
coach

951
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,400
they're the ssc and so before

952
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:27,410
daniel's with all the offers

953
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:29,599
needed daniel to review it either

954
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:29,990
on his

955
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,670
weekly coaching call or through

956
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:33,390
slack and it just created massive

957
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:35,119
delays and things got missed and

958
00:26:35,119 --> 00:26:36,710
the student experience wasn't

959
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,390
super ideal because remember if

960
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,039
you're part of fulfillment it's

961
00:26:40,039 --> 00:26:40,559
all about

962
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:41,779
time to value right and it's not

963
00:26:41,779 --> 00:26:43,049
very valuable if you have to wait

964
00:26:43,049 --> 00:26:44,349
all this time to get your offer

965
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,490
reviewed so what's the solution we

966
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:48,529
created and trained and ai bought

967
00:26:48,529 --> 00:26:50,079
on all of daniel's offer

968
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:53,529
as well as the most successful

969
00:26:53,529 --> 00:26:55,470
offers we have ever seen after

970
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:57,190
interviewing over a hundred

971
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,690
client success or client ascension

972
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:02,089
students and then the bot analyzes

973
00:27:02,089 --> 00:27:03,400
the info from the client's

974
00:27:03,519 --> 00:27:05,930
onboarding form to create a daniel

975
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:08,089
approved offer in minutes right

976
00:27:08,259 --> 00:27:10,960
and so the result before when an

977
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:11,440
ssc

978
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,859
could manage only 40 students and

979
00:27:13,859 --> 00:27:16,250
i need 10 sscs to manage 400

980
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:18,319
students now the sscs can handle

981
00:27:18,319 --> 00:27:18,880
way more

982
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,259
students at this point some of

983
00:27:20,309 --> 00:27:22,029
those guys are at 60 and they're

984
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,920
telling me give me more students

985
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,650
because again what's the other

986
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:27,430
important component of sscs and

987
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:29,099
how this relates to their job

988
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:32,009
performance-based pay so they're

989
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,640
telling me give me more students

990
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,369
right because they get paid for

991
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:36,559
the

992
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:37,950
more students that they get so

993
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:40,460
again they can handle more

994
00:27:40,519 --> 00:27:43,789
students which also allows them to

995
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:44,220
make more

996
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,460
money which i want my team to make

997
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:46,700
more money because then they're

998
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,140
more bought in and like dan said

999
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:48,240
in

1000
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,859
his presentation they can see the

1001
00:27:50,859 --> 00:27:53,089
growth right um and also like

1002
00:27:53,089 --> 00:27:55,759
again because consuming like their

1003
00:27:55,759 --> 00:27:57,230
onboarding form responses and then

1004
00:27:57,339 --> 00:27:58,650
using that to create an offer it

1005
00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:00,240
was like the most time consuming

1006
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,130
thing and not only do they handle

1007
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:03,980
more students but they do it well

1008
00:28:04,089 --> 00:28:06,029
like higher quality than they were

1009
00:28:06,079 --> 00:28:08,039
before which leads to more case

1010
00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:09,829
studies which then sales and

1011
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:11,670
marketing can do or use or

1012
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,240
leverage to

1013
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,200
get more students right it's this

1014
00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:16,140
flywheel um and then daniel can go

1015
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,029
and focus on other very high

1016
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:19,359
level strategic stuff like

1017
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:20,869
recording more trainings which we

1018
00:28:20,869 --> 00:28:22,410
can feed back into the ai bot to

1019
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:22,690
make it

1020
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,869
better more youtube videos which

1021
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:26,700
we can also use to train the ai

1022
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,920
bot um and managing ads and and so

1023
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:29,680
on

1024
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:32,759
make sense you know what's funny i

1025
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,289
literally made one of these for my

1026
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:35,880
clients off his youtube video

1027
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,329
and alex rossi and myron gold and

1028
00:28:39,329 --> 00:28:41,539
stuff that's fire that's that's a

1029
00:28:41,539 --> 00:28:43,599
great idea um there's a tool

1030
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:45,309
that i really like for creating

1031
00:28:45,309 --> 00:28:47,089
bots like the offer creation bot

1032
00:28:47,089 --> 00:28:50,240
called poppy.ai um the reason

1033
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,450
i like poppy.ai instead of like a

1034
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:54,599
claude project is because you can

1035
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:56,440
literally just copy paste youtube

1036
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:56,880
links

1037
00:28:57,599 --> 00:28:58,829
on claude you literally have to

1038
00:28:58,829 --> 00:29:00,170
transcribe the entire video then

1039
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:01,599
upload it and then it takes up

1040
00:29:01,599 --> 00:29:03,190
like a percentage of the knowledge

1041
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:04,619
base and the knowledge base is

1042
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,170
super limited claude doesn't

1043
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,190
have like a limit it's just you

1044
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:10,410
get charged more credits which i'd

1045
00:29:10,539 --> 00:29:12,400
i'd want to pay for more capacity

1046
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,990
if claude would let us they they

1047
00:29:14,049 --> 00:29:15,750
don't and i think daniel you even

1048
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:17,200
tweeted about that like the

1049
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:17,519
project

1050
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:19,000
knowledge on claude like that's

1051
00:29:19,089 --> 00:29:20,730
the best upsell opportunities buy

1052
00:29:20,839 --> 00:29:22,640
more knowledge uh storage but they

1053
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:27,970
don't have they don't let you okay

1054
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:30,190
uh two more so the onboarding

1055
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:32,480
preparation bot all of you guys at

1056
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,220
some point in your client journey

1057
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:35,890
have to do an onboarding process

1058
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:37,279
right and so this one actually

1059
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:40,039
might be super relevant for you

1060
00:29:40,039 --> 00:29:42,849
guys uh so the problem uh our dfy

1061
00:29:42,849 --> 00:29:45,279
like our done for you cold email

1062
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:47,750
setup offer onboarding specialist

1063
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:49,450
for that offer uh at list kit

1064
00:29:49,619 --> 00:29:51,839
before this bot was created they'd

1065
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:53,430
spend a ton of time preparing for

1066
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:55,259
upcoming onboarding calls because

1067
00:29:55,259 --> 00:29:57,430
information from the sales process

1068
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,869
their onboarding form and pre-call

1069
00:29:59,869 --> 00:30:02,240
sops were dispersed and difficult

1070
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,240
to find plus it took a ton of time

1071
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:04,319
to

1072
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:06,279
consume and translate all of that

1073
00:30:06,359 --> 00:30:08,190
information into a strategy for

1074
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:10,109
the call right and so the problem

1075
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:10,240
is

1076
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,690
not that they weren't prepared

1077
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:13,009
it's just that we needed to hire

1078
00:30:13,009 --> 00:30:14,400
more people to handle the

1079
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,279
increased

1080
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:17,079
sales velocity because they could

1081
00:30:17,079 --> 00:30:18,690
only take so many of these calls

1082
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:20,460
every single day so again this all

1083
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,299
goes back to capacity if daniel

1084
00:30:22,299 --> 00:30:24,119
and dan and christian find a way

1085
00:30:24,119 --> 00:30:25,660
to double the amount of dfy

1086
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:26,160
onboarding

1087
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,869
clients that sign up every month i

1088
00:30:27,869 --> 00:30:29,369
don't want to have to go out and

1089
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,730
hire double the amount of people

1090
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:31,039
on

1091
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:32,789
my team i want to figure out how

1092
00:30:32,809 --> 00:30:34,500
can my team handle double the

1093
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,220
capacity and they want to work

1094
00:30:36,269 --> 00:30:36,720
with me to

1095
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,910
solve that problem because they

1096
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:41,089
get paid more as a result right so

1097
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:42,930
like all components work together

1098
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,789
in this so anyways before the

1099
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:46,680
process included the onboarding

1100
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,559
specialist reviewing the sales

1101
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:49,119
call

1102
00:30:49,119 --> 00:30:51,009
and this is so important i we

1103
00:30:51,009 --> 00:30:53,150
talked about it uh to the side of

1104
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:55,329
dan's presentation of like sales

1105
00:30:55,329 --> 00:30:56,319
and cs

1106
00:30:56,319 --> 00:30:58,089
really have to be on the same page

1107
00:30:58,089 --> 00:30:59,950
because if you're on the customer

1108
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:01,759
success team and you have no

1109
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:02,289
insights

1110
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:04,210
into what was talked about on the

1111
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:06,069
sales call and you show up and you

1112
00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:07,500
ask the same questions and you

1113
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:08,819
make the customer repeat

1114
00:31:08,819 --> 00:31:10,250
themselves customers hate

1115
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:11,930
repeating themselves more than

1116
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:12,960
anything else and so

1117
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,430
if you can avoid having them

1118
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,299
repeat themselves you're already

1119
00:31:16,299 --> 00:31:17,839
ahead and you already have a

1120
00:31:17,839 --> 00:31:18,140
better

1121
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,470
customer experience than most

1122
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:21,210
businesses and so they had to

1123
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,680
review the sales calls the email

1124
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,049
threads the onboarding form

1125
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:26,440
responses which a lot of us use

1126
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,160
really long onboarding forms so

1127
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:28,640
there's a lot

1128
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,599
of information that comes with

1129
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,650
that um and so we had to have like

1130
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:34,430
well thought out ideas after

1131
00:31:34,509 --> 00:31:34,839
reviewing

1132
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,349
all these things on how to best

1133
00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:37,779
approach each client's unique

1134
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,759
situation and goals that takes a

1135
00:31:39,759 --> 00:31:40,059
lot of

1136
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:42,230
time and so the solution was we

1137
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:44,630
created an ai agent that collects

1138
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:46,279
and analyzes all client

1139
00:31:46,839 --> 00:31:47,319
interactions

1140
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,309
from their application to when

1141
00:31:49,309 --> 00:31:51,099
they first signed up for sales

1142
00:31:51,099 --> 00:31:53,119
call all of their sales call

1143
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:54,640
recordings all of the

1144
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,349
email threads with the sales

1145
00:31:56,349 --> 00:31:58,039
people or with the cs team and

1146
00:31:58,039 --> 00:32:00,000
then again the onboarding form

1147
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,559
responses and

1148
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:01,609
then we organize all this

1149
00:32:01,609 --> 00:32:03,009
information into here's what you

1150
00:32:03,009 --> 00:32:04,309
need to know for the onboarding

1151
00:32:04,410 --> 00:32:04,559
call

1152
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:06,809
in like literally 10 seconds right

1153
00:32:06,809 --> 00:32:08,460
all you have to do is give it the

1154
00:32:08,519 --> 00:32:10,079
customer's name and email

1155
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:11,549
and it just puts it into a slack

1156
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:13,599
thread in literally 10 seconds

1157
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:14,690
it's the craziest thing

1158
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,579
and so the impact is before the

1159
00:32:16,579 --> 00:32:18,759
onboarding specialist we're only

1160
00:32:18,759 --> 00:32:20,799
doing maybe four really high

1161
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:20,930
quality

1162
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,099
onboarding calls every single day

1163
00:32:23,099 --> 00:32:24,869
now they're doing anywhere from

1164
00:32:24,869 --> 00:32:26,319
six to eight like we quite

1165
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:26,880
literally

1166
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,839
doubled our capacity to take on

1167
00:32:28,839 --> 00:32:30,779
new customers for the dfy setup

1168
00:32:30,839 --> 00:32:34,000
offer overnight without hiring any

1169
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,140
additional people and we make a

1170
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:38,170
way better first impression by

1171
00:32:38,339 --> 00:32:40,210
avoiding again the number one

1172
00:32:40,759 --> 00:32:40,799
thing

1173
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:43,309
customers hey which is having to

1174
00:32:43,309 --> 00:32:47,000
repeat themselves it's good cool

1175
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:52,160
no so it it's the agent that

1176
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:57,380
collects it from our crm from uh

1177
00:32:57,450 --> 00:32:59,839
fathom which we use for call

1178
00:32:59,839 --> 00:33:00,309
recordings

1179
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,779
from fireflies from email inboxes

1180
00:33:02,779 --> 00:33:04,920
um and then the onboarding form

1181
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,559
we'd use uh type form for

1182
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:10,180
so i won't talk about that today

1183
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:11,890
because that will be a longer

1184
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:13,839
conversation but we'll get it

1185
00:33:13,839 --> 00:33:14,930
i can dive into the details on any

1186
00:33:15,049 --> 00:33:16,960
of these with you guys yeah i

1187
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:20,880
would love to walk you through

1188
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:21,039
some

1189
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:22,359
of this stuff this next one is

1190
00:33:22,359 --> 00:33:23,779
going to be even better and then

1191
00:33:23,779 --> 00:33:25,200
we can walk through it on one

1192
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,289
we can walk through it on

1193
00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:27,970
wednesday if you guys want um okay

1194
00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:29,670
that's cool though that one was

1195
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:30,319
valuable

1196
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:34,009
then yeah same for us okay um so

1197
00:33:34,009 --> 00:33:36,970
this one dan touched on this as

1198
00:33:37,079 --> 00:33:39,759
well um call reviews right

1199
00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:41,710
how many of us do call reviews any

1200
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:43,759
of you guys um do call reviews for

1201
00:33:43,759 --> 00:33:45,539
customer success type stuff

1202
00:33:45,599 --> 00:33:48,369
like onboarding calls client

1203
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:51,569
check-in calls okay smear mark

1204
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:53,759
great george also what time is it

1205
00:33:56,079 --> 00:33:58,359
okay making a decent time um okay

1206
00:33:58,410 --> 00:34:00,569
so the problem right reviewing

1207
00:34:00,569 --> 00:34:02,640
calls whether sales calls or

1208
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,569
onboarding calls or client

1209
00:34:04,579 --> 00:34:06,339
check-in calls was a very

1210
00:34:06,339 --> 00:34:08,840
selective guest work and reactive

1211
00:34:08,869 --> 00:34:09,519
process that

1212
00:34:09,519 --> 00:34:11,440
required executives undivided

1213
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,230
attention for at least an hour

1214
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:15,199
right like if anyone's ever done a

1215
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:15,309
call

1216
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,679
review you can't like just breeze

1217
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:19,969
your way through a call review you

1218
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:21,920
have to like lock in and hang on

1219
00:34:22,119 --> 00:34:22,159
to

1220
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:24,119
every single word pause the video

1221
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:26,039
write something down go back it

1222
00:34:26,039 --> 00:34:28,550
was the longest thing that you'd

1223
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:28,880
have

1224
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,710
to work on like every week

1225
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:33,340
consistently multiple times right

1226
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:35,329
and so before just like dan i

1227
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:36,539
spent multiple

1228
00:34:36,559 --> 00:34:38,989
hours watching calls taking pages

1229
00:34:38,989 --> 00:34:41,400
of manual notes spending time with

1230
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,199
a team member then to make sure

1231
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:43,360
that

1232
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,019
they're implementing my feedback

1233
00:34:45,019 --> 00:34:46,369
and i don't know about you guys

1234
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:48,320
but when i watch these calls i get

1235
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:48,719
so

1236
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,809
pissed off i'm like why did they

1237
00:34:50,829 --> 00:34:52,869
say that what an idiot what are

1238
00:34:52,869 --> 00:34:55,280
you doing like no like like i'm

1239
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,360
trying to like jump into the call

1240
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,369
like and just fix what they said

1241
00:34:59,369 --> 00:35:01,199
and it just pissed me off so much

1242
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:02,789
like i remember just being so

1243
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,730
angry after doing call reviews and

1244
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:06,449
like i'm just a perfectionist

1245
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:06,719
that's

1246
00:35:06,719 --> 00:35:07,809
my personality trait it has

1247
00:35:07,929 --> 00:35:09,099
nothing to do with like calls

1248
00:35:09,099 --> 00:35:10,250
actually need to be perfect

1249
00:35:10,329 --> 00:35:11,599
because they don't

1250
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:13,280
but like man like i just can't

1251
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,280
help it but like hang on to every

1252
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,039
detail when i do a call review

1253
00:35:17,039 --> 00:35:18,349
again because i i nitpick

1254
00:35:18,349 --> 00:35:19,809
everything um and i'm like this

1255
00:35:19,809 --> 00:35:21,650
with myself too so it's not just

1256
00:35:21,769 --> 00:35:21,920
other

1257
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,389
people and i'll come back to this

1258
00:35:23,489 --> 00:35:25,199
presentation after nathan sends it

1259
00:35:25,239 --> 00:35:26,489
to me and i'll be like what

1260
00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:27,900
an idiot why did i say that why

1261
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:29,320
didn't i say this at this bar i do

1262
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,360
this all the time um so the

1263
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:31,739
solution

1264
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:35,489
use fathom to record calls the

1265
00:35:35,489 --> 00:35:38,349
fathom will immediately generate a

1266
00:35:38,519 --> 00:35:39,920
transcript of the call

1267
00:35:40,559 --> 00:35:42,989
right it'll send it to an ai agent

1268
00:35:42,989 --> 00:35:45,420
that'll score it based on a score

1269
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:48,079
of one to five and that's based

1270
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:49,969
on actual examples of all the call

1271
00:35:49,969 --> 00:35:51,980
reviews that i've ever done right

1272
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:53,670
and it's a well thought out

1273
00:35:53,679 --> 00:35:55,380
prompt davi i'll share the prompt

1274
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:56,559
with you guys on one of these

1275
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,559
calls and show you how to make one

1276
00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:00,739
similar um and the prompt is just

1277
00:36:00,739 --> 00:36:02,730
me explaining everything that

1278
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:05,119
should happen on each of the types

1279
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:06,809
of calls that i want to have an ai

1280
00:36:06,809 --> 00:36:08,530
review bot in place for and then

1281
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:10,300
generating also something we

1282
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,139
didn't do before super custom

1283
00:36:12,139 --> 00:36:13,849
follow-up email ideas right

1284
00:36:13,929 --> 00:36:16,000
because you talked about a lot of

1285
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:16,289
stuff on

1286
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,059
that call you're now expecting the

1287
00:36:18,059 --> 00:36:19,559
person that was on that call to

1288
00:36:19,639 --> 00:36:20,889
also have remembered everything

1289
00:36:21,039 --> 00:36:22,940
that was talked about and somehow

1290
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:24,780
include that in a follow-up email

1291
00:36:24,889 --> 00:36:26,219
good chance though that they just

1292
00:36:26,239 --> 00:36:27,989
went to the next call and to the

1293
00:36:27,989 --> 00:36:29,880
next call and to the next call and

1294
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,829
now it's 5 p.m they're on eight

1295
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,190
calls there's no way they're

1296
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:34,610
sending eight follow-up emails

1297
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:36,239
that are super custom and hit on

1298
00:36:36,239 --> 00:36:36,639
each thing

1299
00:36:36,639 --> 00:36:38,110
that was discussed on all those

1300
00:36:38,210 --> 00:36:40,000
calls it's impossible right that's

1301
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,280
why we have ai and so it also

1302
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:43,519
makes

1303
00:36:43,519 --> 00:36:45,929
it something dan talked on is like

1304
00:36:45,929 --> 00:36:48,090
like okay using ai right like you

1305
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,480
should in in doing manual reviews

1306
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,070
right so like if dan's still

1307
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:53,909
really set on doing manual call

1308
00:36:53,909 --> 00:36:55,519
reviews which i even go in and

1309
00:36:55,519 --> 00:36:55,730
still

1310
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,500
do at some point how does he know

1311
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:59,400
which call review to review right

1312
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,940
it's kind of like i said in the

1313
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,039
beginning it's more of like a

1314
00:37:03,039 --> 00:37:05,570
reactive process or it's guesswork

1315
00:37:05,719 --> 00:37:07,840
with this ai bot which calls do

1316
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:07,840
you

1317
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:10,019
think i'm reviewing yeah it's like

1318
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:13,010
i just it's a signal it's like oh

1319
00:37:13,010 --> 00:37:16,159
one out of five what happened i

1320
00:37:16,159 --> 00:37:16,320
need

1321
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,139
to see what happened right and not

1322
00:37:18,139 --> 00:37:19,840
only do i review it but i need to

1323
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:20,400
make sure that the

1324
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,880
the client's okay right like i

1325
00:37:21,969 --> 00:37:23,170
need to make sure that something

1326
00:37:23,719 --> 00:37:25,519
okay the call happened i'll review

1327
00:37:25,519 --> 00:37:27,360
it later and i'll give feedback so

1328
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,199
we improve but let's you know make

1329
00:37:29,199 --> 00:37:30,559
that client churn risk

1330
00:37:30,559 --> 00:37:32,619
and make sure they're on like a

1331
00:37:32,619 --> 00:37:34,719
close watch list so that we can

1332
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:36,000
you know like get back into good

1333
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:47,010
okay so let's see what we're doing

1334
00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:47,070
okay so let's see what we're doing

1335
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:49,679
we're doing okay so no but this

1336
00:37:49,679 --> 00:37:51,150
is like something i've talked to

1337
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:52,449
dan about like again implement

1338
00:37:52,449 --> 00:37:54,639
this on the sales side right i'm

1339
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:55,039
i'm just

1340
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:57,000
doing this for cs but again you

1341
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,199
can easily do this for sales um so

1342
00:37:59,199 --> 00:38:03,360
same thing it's yeah just reverse

1343
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,260
engineer this but for sales calls

1344
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:06,869
give it all of your sales call

1345
00:38:06,869 --> 00:38:08,800
reviews and then again give it

1346
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:09,139
what

1347
00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:10,670
should happen on a sales call

1348
00:38:10,679 --> 00:38:12,210
right and then over time it'll

1349
00:38:12,519 --> 00:38:14,079
improve and then what do you think

1350
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:14,239
i do

1351
00:38:14,239 --> 00:38:15,599
with the five out of five calls

1352
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:19,639
that but don't look actually but

1353
00:38:19,639 --> 00:38:22,070
what do you think i do with the

1354
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:22,260
five

1355
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,559
out of five calls because guess

1356
00:38:23,559 --> 00:38:24,789
what the bot's not perfect when

1357
00:38:24,789 --> 00:38:28,400
you first make it and be like this

1358
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,699
is a five out of five use this

1359
00:38:29,699 --> 00:38:31,170
when reviewing the next calls to

1360
00:38:31,239 --> 00:38:33,550
look for a good call so the bot

1361
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:33,920
gets

1362
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,670
better when it has examples of

1363
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:37,449
what a call should look like and

1364
00:38:37,489 --> 00:38:39,360
also what a call shouldn't look

1365
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:39,599
like

1366
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:41,190
right so this is the cool stuff

1367
00:38:41,199 --> 00:38:42,809
like i love talking about this

1368
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,559
because it's really cool and it's

1369
00:38:44,559 --> 00:38:44,960
not

1370
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,690
again like that super you know

1371
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:48,690
like engagement bait content that

1372
00:38:48,699 --> 00:38:50,550
you see on linkedin and twitter

1373
00:38:50,559 --> 00:38:50,750
that

1374
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,280
pisses me off because i actually

1375
00:38:52,369 --> 00:38:53,690
get the fomo that probably a lot

1376
00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:55,369
of you guys are getting too and we

1377
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,820
really shouldn't but like this

1378
00:38:57,820 --> 00:39:00,280
stuff it's like not sexy but it's

1379
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:03,449
so effective um and so yeah not

1380
00:39:03,519 --> 00:39:04,900
only can you feed it back into the

1381
00:39:04,949 --> 00:39:06,219
bot but like davi said you can

1382
00:39:06,219 --> 00:39:07,699
praise that person for crushing

1383
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,440
a call um and then you can also

1384
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,269
use it to train new team members

1385
00:39:11,269 --> 00:39:13,010
right like my favorite way to

1386
00:39:13,039 --> 00:39:14,789
onboard and train new team members

1387
00:39:14,809 --> 00:39:16,300
is to be like hey go watch these

1388
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:19,199
10 calls because this is what an

1389
00:39:19,199 --> 00:39:20,940
onboarding call should look like

1390
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:22,289
and why give them a bunch of

1391
00:39:22,519 --> 00:39:24,639
random calls that might be good

1392
00:39:24,639 --> 00:39:24,989
might not

1393
00:39:25,039 --> 00:39:27,280
be good when i can give them 10

1394
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,210
five out of five calls right um

1395
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:31,119
and so it improves over time

1396
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:32,590
because you feed you know more

1397
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:34,360
data back into it and so this is

1398
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,289
the craziest stat

1399
00:39:36,239 --> 00:39:38,460
our customer success team at list

1400
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:40,849
kit was on 808 calls in the last

1401
00:39:40,989 --> 00:39:44,949
30 days 808 calls in the last 30

1402
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:48,360
days 808 calls in the last 30 days

1403
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:50,869
and they were all automatically

1404
00:39:50,869 --> 00:39:53,440
reviewed scored and attached with

1405
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:53,670
a

1406
00:39:53,679 --> 00:39:56,039
custom follow-up email immediately

1407
00:39:56,039 --> 00:39:58,929
after the call ended bro i would

1408
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:01,599
have to hire every single one of

1409
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:01,679
you

1410
00:40:01,679 --> 00:40:03,480
guys in this room to do that

1411
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,789
without ai as your full-time jobs

1412
00:40:05,789 --> 00:40:09,280
and you'd be miserable but ai does

1413
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,650
it for us for like 12 a month or

1414
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:14,030
whatever the cost is so this stuff

1415
00:40:14,039 --> 00:40:16,880
is is nuts right i think so it's

1416
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:17,280
wild

1417
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,329
so anyways ai wrote this whole

1418
00:40:19,329 --> 00:40:21,800
presentation remember that so none

1419
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:25,110
of these are my ideas it's just ai

1420
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:28,809
um so a couple more things this

1421
00:40:28,809 --> 00:40:30,650
stuff's not as valuable like that

1422
00:40:30,730 --> 00:40:32,239
slide was a banger because

1423
00:40:32,239 --> 00:40:33,920
it's like real but this stuff is

1424
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,650
important too like how do you use

1425
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:38,000
ai in a practical way every

1426
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,380
single day so this is one of my

1427
00:40:39,429 --> 00:40:40,769
favorite ways to do it like when

1428
00:40:40,769 --> 00:40:42,480
i'm creating content when i'm

1429
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:42,800
creating

1430
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,539
so my presentation that you're

1431
00:40:44,539 --> 00:40:46,079
looking at right now it went

1432
00:40:46,119 --> 00:40:47,889
through this process probably a

1433
00:40:47,889 --> 00:40:48,480
couple more

1434
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,280
times then i'll usually put some

1435
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,130
other thing through if it's like a

1436
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:54,159
tweet or if it's a response to you

1437
00:40:54,159 --> 00:40:55,460
know a cold email but this

1438
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:56,929
presentation went through this

1439
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,039
process like 10 times i was up to

1440
00:40:59,039 --> 00:40:59,949
like 1 30 last

1441
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,090
night just doing this process so i

1442
00:41:02,090 --> 00:41:03,900
had it draft the first piece of

1443
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:06,079
content maybe let's say start with

1444
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:07,969
chat gpt i give that piece of

1445
00:41:07,969 --> 00:41:10,260
content to claude and i say review

1446
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:12,280
this piece of content with like

1447
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:12,719
this in

1448
00:41:12,719 --> 00:41:14,559
mind right like i want to make

1449
00:41:14,559 --> 00:41:16,389
sure i'm delivering a highly

1450
00:41:16,389 --> 00:41:18,239
engaged really to the point

1451
00:41:18,239 --> 00:41:18,920
presentation to

1452
00:41:19,039 --> 00:41:20,880
this mastermind group tomorrow

1453
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,769
okay so claude reviews it and then

1454
00:41:22,769 --> 00:41:24,159
i'll go to a third ai let's

1455
00:41:24,159 --> 00:41:25,750
just say gemini and i'll say

1456
00:41:25,769 --> 00:41:27,860
here's what you know mentor number

1457
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:29,750
one gave me here's what mentor

1458
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:29,949
number

1459
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,260
two gave me take the best of both

1460
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:34,570
and give me a final version right

1461
00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:36,960
so many of you guys just ask chat

1462
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:37,440
gpt

1463
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,909
take what it gives you and run

1464
00:41:39,019 --> 00:41:40,510
it's like use all of them and

1465
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,400
watch how much better the output

1466
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:42,880
is here

1467
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:45,000
compared to just here and it

1468
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:47,760
doesn't really take much more time

1469
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:48,960
and then the final step

1470
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,710
is review it as a human because we

1471
00:41:50,730 --> 00:41:52,489
really shouldn't be putting out

1472
00:41:52,570 --> 00:41:54,079
content and presentations and

1473
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:54,880
training

1474
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,969
without our final check and run

1475
00:41:56,969 --> 00:41:59,769
through make sense so do you

1476
00:41:59,769 --> 00:42:03,519
actually use gemini at all i've

1477
00:42:03,519 --> 00:42:03,829
used it

1478
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,659
yeah for stuff like this have you

1479
00:42:05,659 --> 00:42:07,550
had good outputs like that's been

1480
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:08,800
the worst one for me

1481
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,130
again like i'm not the ai expert

1482
00:42:11,139 --> 00:42:13,369
it's more of like the concept if

1483
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:15,269
you've not had good results with

1484
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,869
gemini just swap it out for

1485
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:18,909
another one but like i've gemini

1486
00:42:18,909 --> 00:42:20,940
is nice because it's like native

1487
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:21,489
to google

1488
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,679
it's got uh the best limits in

1489
00:42:23,679 --> 00:42:25,710
terms of knowledge base outside of

1490
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:27,760
like a more custom like poppy ai

1491
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:27,969
type

1492
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,960
solution but again i'm not the ai

1493
00:42:30,039 --> 00:42:31,900
expert like you'll find better

1494
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:34,159
information on is gemini the best

1495
00:42:34,159 --> 00:42:34,210
is

1496
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,150
josh gpt the best is claude the

1497
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:36,719
best it's

1498
00:42:36,719 --> 00:42:45,400
okay great so again it's about the

1499
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:48,739
process of one two three and watch

1500
00:42:49,139 --> 00:42:51,329
the quality compared to the first

1501
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,250
time and the third time and again

1502
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:55,110
always have that human review at

1503
00:42:55,210 --> 00:42:56,800
the end super important because

1504
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:59,050
this is specifically for like

1505
00:42:59,050 --> 00:43:01,880
content presentations training um

1506
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:03,010
things that

1507
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:05,099
like we're doing right now that

1508
00:43:05,099 --> 00:43:07,019
are higher level and should really

1509
00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:08,800
stem from your own words right

1510
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:09,039
like

1511
00:43:09,039 --> 00:43:10,510
one of my favorite prompts is like

1512
00:43:10,610 --> 00:43:11,809
only use things that i've said

1513
00:43:12,289 --> 00:43:13,199
because i'll give it like youtube

1514
00:43:13,199 --> 00:43:13,590
videos

1515
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:15,690
and docs and call recordings and

1516
00:43:15,690 --> 00:43:17,690
i'm like make this as authentic

1517
00:43:17,690 --> 00:43:19,760
and on brand to what i would say

1518
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:20,320
or have

1519
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:21,960
said as possible because it's

1520
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:23,670
super important i don't want to

1521
00:43:23,670 --> 00:43:25,280
come up here and i want to be able

1522
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:25,360
to

1523
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:26,380
come up here and give a

1524
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:27,880
presentation that like sounds

1525
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:29,260
nothing like what i would talk

1526
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:30,400
about or is talking

1527
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,219
about things that i've not

1528
00:43:32,219 --> 00:43:34,530
actually done right and so this is

1529
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:36,190
just like a really simple

1530
00:43:36,269 --> 00:43:36,610
breakdown

1531
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:38,590
um that could be helpful so like

1532
00:43:38,719 --> 00:43:40,909
what does ai do best well it helps

1533
00:43:40,969 --> 00:43:42,309
with repetitive processes

1534
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:44,280
that drain energy it helps with

1535
00:43:44,369 --> 00:43:46,489
initial drafts and ideas it helps

1536
00:43:46,659 --> 00:43:48,480
with data analysis and pattern

1537
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,230
recognition it helps with

1538
00:43:50,230 --> 00:43:52,269
organizing data from multiple

1539
00:43:52,329 --> 00:43:54,110
sources so davi you asked me

1540
00:43:54,110 --> 00:43:54,880
earlier you

1541
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:55,969
know i have information over here

1542
00:43:56,090 --> 00:43:57,110
about this and over here about

1543
00:43:57,110 --> 00:43:58,320
this and over here about this how

1544
00:43:58,320 --> 00:43:58,630
do i

1545
00:43:58,639 --> 00:44:01,409
organize it in a way using ai well

1546
00:44:01,409 --> 00:44:04,070
we can talk about that and then

1547
00:44:04,070 --> 00:44:06,659
research okay and then what

1548
00:44:06,719 --> 00:44:09,190
do humans do better um strategic

1549
00:44:09,190 --> 00:44:11,679
thinking and planning creative

1550
00:44:11,679 --> 00:44:14,730
problem solving building genuine

1551
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,409
relationships right obviously

1552
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:17,559
you're not gonna have a

1553
00:44:17,559 --> 00:44:19,300
relationship with an ai that would

1554
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:19,840
be weird

1555
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:22,559
probably in the future that'll be

1556
00:44:22,559 --> 00:44:24,869
true but i'm out on that one um

1557
00:44:24,869 --> 00:44:27,070
and then final quality assurance

1558
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:28,500
and judgment that one's so

1559
00:44:28,550 --> 00:44:30,019
important because so many people

1560
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:32,309
again especially like the twitter

1561
00:44:32,349 --> 00:44:32,800
bros and

1562
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:35,579
the the linkedin professionals um

1563
00:44:35,739 --> 00:44:38,260
are so big on like just use ai to

1564
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:40,030
run your entire life and

1565
00:44:40,159 --> 00:44:40,800
completely

1566
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,570
check out and like that's i'm so

1567
00:44:44,119 --> 00:44:46,190
against that it's use ai as a

1568
00:44:46,190 --> 00:44:49,280
sidekick like use ai in a smart

1569
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:50,239
way that's

1570
00:44:50,239 --> 00:44:52,519
it um and always have the final

1571
00:44:52,519 --> 00:44:55,269
quality assurance and judgment and

1572
00:44:55,269 --> 00:44:57,469
that way you can actually also

1573
00:44:57,599 --> 00:44:57,840
spot

1574
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:00,219
where it needs to improve right

1575
00:45:00,219 --> 00:45:02,639
and so yes ai can increase your

1576
00:45:02,639 --> 00:45:05,070
capacity to take on new clients

1577
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:07,880
but like you still need a players

1578
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:09,659
right what did i say to george

1579
00:45:09,769 --> 00:45:11,599
earlier the number one focus for

1580
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:11,710
me

1581
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,510
now going forward is to build my

1582
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:15,289
talent pipeline i wouldn't have

1583
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:17,349
that as my number one focus if it

1584
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:19,340
wasn't the most important thing so

1585
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:21,260
talent acquisition is is number

1586
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:23,559
one and i guess number one is

1587
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:23,760
really

1588
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:24,980
being a great leader so that you

1589
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:26,199
can acquire a players but great

1590
00:45:26,199 --> 00:45:28,320
leadership right that's that's

1591
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:30,590
always going to be required to run

1592
00:45:30,590 --> 00:45:32,699
a business always a players and

1593
00:45:32,699 --> 00:45:34,000
great leadership

1594
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:37,190
and so finally like where do you

1595
00:45:37,190 --> 00:45:38,960
go from here again just to kind of

1596
00:45:39,050 --> 00:45:41,409
bring it home start with your

1597
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:43,800
biggest problems um don't get

1598
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:46,440
distracted by the fanciest tools

1599
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:49,360
the latest innovations the hacks

1600
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:49,679
the

1601
00:45:49,679 --> 00:45:51,159
agent workforce all these

1602
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:52,840
buzzwords that you'll see i

1603
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,679
promise you if you open twitter

1604
00:45:54,679 --> 00:45:55,360
after this

1605
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:57,260
presentation you'll see it i see

1606
00:45:57,260 --> 00:45:59,019
it all the time aka the replace

1607
00:45:59,019 --> 00:46:00,880
your entire workforce with ai

1608
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:01,559
agents

1609
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:03,840
don't get distracted by that focus

1610
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:05,769
on what will actually serve your

1611
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:07,800
team now based on what they're

1612
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:09,690
experiencing on a day-to-day and

1613
00:46:09,690 --> 00:46:11,349
we talked through how do you do

1614
00:46:11,349 --> 00:46:13,920
that um make your team want to use

1615
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:14,050
ai

1616
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:16,300
and not feel like they're going to

1617
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:17,960
be punished if you find out

1618
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:19,909
they're using ai and you can do

1619
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:20,519
that by

1620
00:46:20,559 --> 00:46:22,030
rewarding desired behaviors

1621
00:46:22,030 --> 00:46:23,360
there's actually a really really

1622
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:25,630
good golden nugget here that you

1623
00:46:25,630 --> 00:46:26,530
guys should

1624
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:29,739
should 100 do go and create one of

1625
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:32,150
those virtual credit cards in

1626
00:46:32,150 --> 00:46:34,559
mercury and just call it ai team

1627
00:46:34,559 --> 00:46:36,519
expenses and then just send it to

1628
00:46:36,519 --> 00:46:38,309
your team and say go sign up for

1629
00:46:38,409 --> 00:46:40,239
ai tools that you find interesting

1630
00:46:40,239 --> 00:46:42,050
and want to test out and play

1631
00:46:42,050 --> 00:46:44,230
around with with this card like go

1632
00:46:44,230 --> 00:46:47,039
do that and like that builds

1633
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:47,440
culture

1634
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:48,880
because you're supporting

1635
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,909
development of a really important

1636
00:46:50,909 --> 00:46:52,619
skill set that'll serve them in

1637
00:46:52,670 --> 00:46:53,219
this existing

1638
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,369
role and serve them in their

1639
00:46:55,429 --> 00:46:58,030
future career and it's really easy

1640
00:46:58,039 --> 00:47:00,239
to do you can also set like a

1641
00:47:00,239 --> 00:47:00,880
limit and

1642
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:02,139
you can see all the charges

1643
00:47:02,139 --> 00:47:03,559
obviously if you if you want to

1644
00:47:03,559 --> 00:47:05,280
know who you should fire just look

1645
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:05,449
at what

1646
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:07,070
people are spending money on and

1647
00:47:07,070 --> 00:47:08,409
if someone's got like an uber eats

1648
00:47:08,409 --> 00:47:11,380
on there you can fire them um but

1649
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:12,889
we've never had any issues with

1650
00:47:12,889 --> 00:47:14,210
that and you can set limits so

1651
00:47:14,239 --> 00:47:15,920
it's like 500 a month if they

1652
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:16,320
spend the

1653
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:18,599
whole 500 a month on ai tools i'm

1654
00:47:18,650 --> 00:47:20,059
gonna get an roi from that

1655
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:22,289
guaranteed so i'm okay with it um

1656
00:47:22,369 --> 00:47:22,719
so do

1657
00:47:22,719 --> 00:47:24,610
that like that's an action item

1658
00:47:24,610 --> 00:47:26,599
that in the slack channel of just

1659
00:47:26,599 --> 00:47:28,510
like your company name dash ai

1660
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:29,949
and adding all your team in there

1661
00:47:29,989 --> 00:47:31,300
to just talk about ai those are

1662
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:32,730
two things you should do like

1663
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:34,389
immediately after this

1664
00:47:34,449 --> 00:47:36,530
presentation um make ai part of

1665
00:47:36,530 --> 00:47:38,579
your daily routine right again

1666
00:47:38,670 --> 00:47:39,599
going back to the

1667
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:43,130
shopify ceo's um memo reflexive ai

1668
00:47:43,210 --> 00:47:45,809
usage is the new standard and

1669
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:48,789
expectation reflexive and again

1670
00:47:48,829 --> 00:47:48,960
the

1671
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:50,639
best way to describe what he's

1672
00:47:50,639 --> 00:47:52,460
saying there is like the same way

1673
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:54,400
you go to google to search things

1674
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,570
you should go to ai to do things

1675
00:47:56,570 --> 00:47:58,570
and implement new workflows and

1676
00:47:58,739 --> 00:48:00,320
improvements to processes to

1677
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:00,599
increase

1678
00:48:00,639 --> 00:48:03,409
capacity and then finally um

1679
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:06,210
connect ai to performance

1680
00:48:06,210 --> 00:48:09,519
incentives and hitting kpis right

1681
00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:10,079
and it's really

1682
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:11,690
easy to do this i've done it a

1683
00:48:11,690 --> 00:48:13,730
couple times in this presentation

1684
00:48:13,730 --> 00:48:16,239
if you're paying someone for the

1685
00:48:16,239 --> 00:48:18,480
amount of students that they can

1686
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:20,300
coach and handle and get to

1687
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:22,429
success if ai can help them to do

1688
00:48:22,429 --> 00:48:22,960
more of

1689
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:25,030
that they're going to have the

1690
00:48:25,030 --> 00:48:27,099
incentive to use ai and want to

1691
00:48:27,099 --> 00:48:28,750
use it more right and so

1692
00:48:28,829 --> 00:48:30,190
incentivize usage

1693
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:31,909
by pointing out how you and

1694
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:34,059
specific team members are using it

1695
00:48:34,059 --> 00:48:35,730
to improve performance and

1696
00:48:35,730 --> 00:48:36,079
increase

1697
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:38,150
their earnings and so this isn't

1698
00:48:38,150 --> 00:48:40,219
just a go implement this one time

1699
00:48:40,219 --> 00:48:42,559
and and again like check out it's

1700
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:44,300
continual i log into slack and i

1701
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:46,030
see what my team is doing and i'm

1702
00:48:46,030 --> 00:48:47,519
looking for ways that they're

1703
00:48:47,519 --> 00:48:48,639
using ai

1704
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:49,960
so i can shout them out and

1705
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:51,429
reinforce it for the rest of the

1706
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:54,000
team right like you don't train

1707
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:54,400
someone

1708
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:56,090
just by telling them one time like

1709
00:48:56,090 --> 00:48:57,599
you repeat it over and over and

1710
00:48:57,719 --> 00:48:59,760
over and over and over again and

1711
00:48:59,760 --> 00:48:59,989
that's

1712
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,309
and that's how it sticks and

1713
00:49:01,309 --> 00:49:02,769
that's how it becomes truly part

1714
00:49:02,849 --> 00:49:06,880
of your culture and that's it so

1715
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:07,599
thank

1716
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:11,389
you guys appreciate it thank you
