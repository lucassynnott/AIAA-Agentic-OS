1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:01,649
What's going on guys?

2
00:00:01,820 --> 00:00:03,359
Welcome back to another video.

3
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:07,019
Andre here and I apologize for the

4
00:00:07,019 --> 00:00:07,089
past

5
00:00:07,389 --> 00:00:09,109
few videos or majority of my

6
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:10,849
videos in this program to be

7
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:11,619
honest.

8
00:00:11,619 --> 00:00:13,230
I just found that video

9
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:15,369
having my video on as part of the

10
00:00:15,369 --> 00:00:16,800
video can sometimes be

11
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,100
distracting.

12
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,140
So I've just been

13
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:21,469
doing screenshots for the most

14
00:00:21,469 --> 00:00:23,269
part to keep your focus and

15
00:00:23,269 --> 00:00:25,230
attention to what's actually

16
00:00:25,429 --> 00:00:26,920
on the screen which is the most

17
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,519
important piece of it because a

18
00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:29,519
lot of this a lot of

19
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:31,449
the things I'm teaching is very

20
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:32,130
visual.

21
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:34,240
But anyways, in this video what

22
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:34,719
we're going to be

23
00:00:35,329 --> 00:00:36,729
covering is how to ask the right

24
00:00:36,729 --> 00:00:39,320
questions in your onboarding form.

25
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,619
So in the previous video

26
00:00:40,729 --> 00:00:42,229
we walked through the onboarding

27
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,840
process and what actually happens

28
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:44,899
once you get a contract

29
00:00:44,929 --> 00:00:46,299
signed by your client and

30
00:00:46,299 --> 00:00:48,170
basically the process you should

31
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:49,380
take them through.

32
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:50,320
And part of that

33
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:52,210
process was sending them a link to

34
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:53,829
fill out an onboarding form.

35
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:55,579
So you're basically as soon

36
00:00:55,609 --> 00:00:57,060
as you sign a client for most

37
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:58,740
services you got to assign them

38
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:00,780
homework because to fulfill

39
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:04,140
on a service you got to have a

40
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:08,060
formal manner on your client to be

41
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:09,650
able to do a sufficient

42
00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:09,980
job.

43
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:11,819
So like for our agency we do lead

44
00:01:11,819 --> 00:01:14,299
generation and just like what you

45
00:01:14,299 --> 00:01:16,620
learn in module two or three

46
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:18,780
was in the lead generation module

47
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:19,980
of the program.

48
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:22,140
You have to know your offer and

49
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:22,939
you have to know the

50
00:01:22,969 --> 00:01:24,430
target market otherwise lead

51
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:25,799
generation is going to fail

52
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:26,430
miserably.

53
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,260
So for us to do lead generation

54
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:28,780
for other

55
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:30,530
businesses we basically have to

56
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:32,230
put them through questions that

57
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:34,540
tell us exactly what you guys were

58
00:01:34,569 --> 00:01:36,000
telling us as part of this program

59
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,579
in the lead generation module.

60
00:01:37,579 --> 00:01:39,420
So you'll see throughout our

61
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:41,239
onboarding form us asking those

62
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:42,129
questions.

63
00:01:42,129 --> 00:01:44,120
And the biggest thing before we

64
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:44,859
get into it

65
00:01:45,769 --> 00:01:47,480
is like don't be afraid to ask a

66
00:01:47,489 --> 00:01:49,040
bunch of questions in your

67
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,939
onboarding form like I see a lot

68
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:51,629
of agencies

69
00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:53,189
just like keep their onboarding

70
00:01:53,209 --> 00:01:54,680
forms really short and brief

71
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,540
because they don't want to make it

72
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:56,700
like

73
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:58,409
a hassle for the client to go

74
00:01:58,409 --> 00:01:59,909
through the process.

75
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:01,980
But what I'm telling you is that

76
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,659
this is just another

77
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:05,459
sign like this is just another way

78
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:07,180
to really lock your client into a

79
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:08,620
committed relationship

80
00:02:09,689 --> 00:02:11,590
not a romantic relationship but a

81
00:02:11,659 --> 00:02:13,150
business relationship where

82
00:02:13,419 --> 00:02:15,099
they're just you're basically

83
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:17,030
training them to be an active

84
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:18,550
partner as you're working

85
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:19,819
together.

86
00:02:19,819 --> 00:02:21,550
And that is just such a core

87
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:24,360
component of having success with

88
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:25,409
your clients.

89
00:02:25,659 --> 00:02:26,860
It's like it's just something that

90
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:27,659
you would not really

91
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:28,860
think about because everyone's so

92
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:29,960
focused on how do I get results?

93
00:02:30,099 --> 00:02:31,110
How do I get results?

94
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:32,300
Well, it starts

95
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:34,229
with these very basic things like

96
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,599
filling out an onboarding form or

97
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:38,199
collecting an onboarding form

98
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:40,120
that answers the most important

99
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,750
questions that you need to get

100
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,580
answered in order to actually

101
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:44,060
fulfill

102
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:45,590
and execute on things.

103
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:47,180
So the onboarding form is

104
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:50,430
basically like to be honest one of

105
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:51,819
the only chances

106
00:02:51,849 --> 00:02:53,860
you'll get to basically convince

107
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:55,680
the client to sit down and fill

108
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,719
out this long form.

109
00:02:57,919 --> 00:02:58,819
Trust me like

110
00:02:58,889 --> 00:03:00,969
we've come up with more questions

111
00:03:00,979 --> 00:03:03,129
and variations to our onboarding

112
00:03:03,129 --> 00:03:04,060
form.

113
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,099
And once you get a lot of

114
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:07,560
clients, it becomes extremely

115
00:03:07,569 --> 00:03:10,039
difficult to get them to fill out

116
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:12,469
the new parts of an onboarding

117
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:12,939
form or

118
00:03:12,969 --> 00:03:14,419
just to fill out anything.

119
00:03:14,419 --> 00:03:16,009
It's like slower and you have to

120
00:03:16,009 --> 00:03:17,740
chase down the clients and it's

121
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:18,139
going to take

122
00:03:18,169 --> 00:03:19,340
a lot of time.

123
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:20,699
So really think through this

124
00:03:20,699 --> 00:03:22,199
process and use your onboarding

125
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:22,699
form.

126
00:03:22,699 --> 00:03:23,500
The onboarding form,

127
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:25,800
again, is your chance to collect

128
00:03:25,949 --> 00:03:28,360
all the information you could ever

129
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,780
need on your client and keep it on

130
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:33,879
file to properly and efficiently

131
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:36,680
fulfill on the services that you

132
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,379
sold to them.

133
00:03:38,379 --> 00:03:39,099
So again, for us,

134
00:03:39,129 --> 00:03:40,479
for lead generation, the whole

135
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:41,849
point of this onboarding form is

136
00:03:41,849 --> 00:03:43,259
obviously to collect general

137
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:44,909
information about our new client

138
00:03:44,909 --> 00:03:46,439
so that we could contact them,

139
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:47,909
invoice them, all that great

140
00:03:47,909 --> 00:03:48,300
stuff,

141
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:50,430
and then ask all the important

142
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,780
questions that relate to our

143
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:52,449
campaign.

144
00:03:52,449 --> 00:03:54,780
So we basically break off

145
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:56,520
our onboarding form into three

146
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,259
sections.

147
00:03:57,259 --> 00:03:59,129
The first section is just general

148
00:03:59,129 --> 00:04:00,300
contact information.

149
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:00,539
The

150
00:04:00,569 --> 00:04:02,030
second is like basically asking

151
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:03,449
them a bunch of questions about

152
00:04:03,449 --> 00:04:04,379
their business.

153
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:05,099
And then the third

154
00:04:05,129 --> 00:04:06,379
and the last section is like their

155
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:06,780
goals.

156
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,639
So this is another important one

157
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,990
that you'll see how we frame it

158
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:12,879
and set it up towards the end of

159
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,969
this video, which is asking what

160
00:04:14,969 --> 00:04:16,920
their goals are for working with

161
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:17,180
us.

162
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:18,709
So like what results are you

163
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:20,629
currently seeing and what results

164
00:04:20,629 --> 00:04:22,459
you hope to see as a result of

165
00:04:22,459 --> 00:04:22,699
working

166
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:23,620
with our agency.

167
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:24,800
So that's how we set up our

168
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,769
onboarding form.

169
00:04:25,779 --> 00:04:27,259
Of course, you could take a

170
00:04:27,259 --> 00:04:28,220
different format

171
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,290
or strategy here.

172
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:32,519
But the biggest thing to make note

173
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:35,589
of is that the onboarding form is

174
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,379
one of your most

175
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:38,259
valuable tools because you're just

176
00:04:38,259 --> 00:04:39,500
going to collect a ton of

177
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,100
information on your clients

178
00:04:41,129 --> 00:04:42,319
and be able to share it with your

179
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:43,019
entire team.

180
00:04:43,019 --> 00:04:44,939
You're going to want to study it,

181
00:04:44,939 --> 00:04:45,339
obviously,

182
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:46,350
so that when you get on that

183
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:47,639
onboarding call, you know

184
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:48,819
everything about your client

185
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:49,500
because they just

186
00:04:49,529 --> 00:04:51,240
spilled the beans on everything.

187
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,610
So you just want to become you

188
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:55,339
basically are now part of this.

189
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:56,850
You basically want to treat your

190
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:58,459
client's business as your own.

191
00:04:58,459 --> 00:04:59,899
So learn everything there is to

192
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:00,139
learn

193
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:01,810
about their business by asking the

194
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:02,790
right questions.

195
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:04,860
And again, you've heard me say

196
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:05,579
this already a few

197
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:06,589
times in this module.

198
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:08,040
And I think this is our strongest

199
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:09,350
module because we stand out so

200
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,139
much compared to

201
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:11,389
other agencies.

202
00:05:11,389 --> 00:05:13,379
We just do it the right way on all

203
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:14,699
on all cylinders.

204
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:16,459
We fire out all cylinders.

205
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:18,470
Like they say we get complimented

206
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:20,399
on this a lot like the onboarding

207
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:21,209
form.

208
00:05:21,209 --> 00:05:23,420
Most of the clients that sign

209
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:25,579
on with us enjoy going through it

210
00:05:25,579 --> 00:05:27,740
so much because it forces them to

211
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,740
think deeper or to answer

212
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:29,870
questions

213
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:31,689
that they never even considered

214
00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:33,209
asking themselves about their

215
00:05:33,209 --> 00:05:33,689
business.

216
00:05:33,899 --> 00:05:35,740
So like the onboarding form

217
00:05:35,769 --> 00:05:37,379
is actually a great practice for

218
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:39,189
you even to fill out on your own

219
00:05:39,189 --> 00:05:41,060
like my onboarding form

220
00:05:41,139 --> 00:05:41,629
specifically

221
00:05:41,689 --> 00:05:42,670
for KnowledgeX.

222
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,350
I would encourage you to fill it

223
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:45,899
out or to consider some of the

224
00:05:45,899 --> 00:05:47,259
questions in here

225
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:48,680
because it could really help you

226
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,050
to define your business and get

227
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:52,939
really clear on what it is you do

228
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:54,300
and who it is you're targeting

229
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,560
just to extend on some of the

230
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,000
things you learned in the lead

231
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:57,500
generation

232
00:05:57,529 --> 00:05:58,160
module.

233
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,420
But anyways, the onboarding form,

234
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:02,319
it's there for you to get all the

235
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:03,740
answers to all the questions

236
00:06:03,769 --> 00:06:05,579
you could possibly come up with in

237
00:06:05,579 --> 00:06:07,329
order to fulfill your services,

238
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,459
your clients.

239
00:06:08,459 --> 00:06:10,379
And in terms of logistics,

240
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:11,339
it's really simple.

241
00:06:11,339 --> 00:06:13,180
Like you see on the screen here,

242
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:15,980
we're just inside of Google Docs,

243
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:18,069
and we just create a new Google

244
00:06:18,069 --> 00:06:18,660
form.

245
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,759
I added like our banner logo to

246
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:21,410
the top.

247
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:21,879
And all you do

248
00:06:22,089 --> 00:06:23,790
after setting up the questions,

249
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:24,949
it's really simple.

250
00:06:24,949 --> 00:06:26,699
Like you could add different

251
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:28,220
sections, you could add

252
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:28,990
questions.

253
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:30,519
And then in the question, you

254
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:33,259
could just do like a, you could,

255
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:34,670
you could do all different

256
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:36,189
types of questions and answers.

257
00:06:36,189 --> 00:06:37,579
You can make them required or not

258
00:06:37,579 --> 00:06:38,149
required.

259
00:06:38,149 --> 00:06:39,180
You could delete them.

260
00:06:39,209 --> 00:06:41,980
Tons of different options here.

261
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:42,939
So it's very custom.

262
00:06:42,939 --> 00:06:44,509
And then once it's done, all you

263
00:06:44,579 --> 00:06:45,420
do is you hit send.

264
00:06:46,009 --> 00:06:47,339
And then you copy this link.

265
00:06:47,339 --> 00:06:48,850
So anyone who has this link, they

266
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:50,379
just paste it into their browser.

267
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,910
And it just looks it's very

268
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:53,829
professional, like it's really

269
00:06:53,829 --> 00:06:55,819
easy to use, easy to read.

270
00:06:55,819 --> 00:06:56,699
And then the best,

271
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:58,439
best part is anytime we get a

272
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:00,149
response, we get an email

273
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:02,600
notification about it from Google.

274
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,149
So we don't

275
00:07:03,209 --> 00:07:04,189
have to set up any crazy

276
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,040
automations.

277
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,449
All you do for that is you click

278
00:07:06,449 --> 00:07:08,779
these three dots, or actually, you

279
00:07:08,779 --> 00:07:09,629
go to you go to

280
00:07:09,769 --> 00:07:10,939
settings, I believe.

281
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:14,500
Yeah, I believe you go to

282
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:17,779
settings, or I'm honestly not even

283
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,339
sure anymore.

284
00:07:19,389 --> 00:07:20,319
I'll figure out where to go

285
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:20,750
for that.

286
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:21,810
I think you go to responses, I

287
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:23,180
just don't want to open responses,

288
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:23,879
because there's a lot of

289
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:25,889
sensitive information in there, as

290
00:07:25,889 --> 00:07:26,860
you can imagine.

291
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:28,540
But you just go to responses.

292
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:29,310
And you could you could

293
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:31,220
both create a an Excel sheet out

294
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,790
of this so that all the people

295
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,860
that go through it, you can

296
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,139
basically get

297
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:38,069
their information in an organized

298
00:07:38,069 --> 00:07:38,930
Excel sheet.

299
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:40,860
And then you could go through each

300
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:41,899
response on an

301
00:07:42,509 --> 00:07:44,000
individual level, and either print

302
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,720
it out as a PDF, which is what we

303
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,050
do.

304
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:47,500
And we onboard that to the

305
00:07:47,529 --> 00:07:49,389
Trello board, because it's really

306
00:07:49,389 --> 00:07:50,930
easy to just open up a PDF, and

307
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:52,610
see both the questions and then

308
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:52,779
the

309
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:54,310
answers written below it, just

310
00:07:54,339 --> 00:07:55,699
like a Google Doc would be.

311
00:07:55,709 --> 00:07:57,019
So it's really simple, the

312
00:07:57,019 --> 00:07:57,889
logistics, just

313
00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:00,009
using something like Google Forms.

314
00:08:00,009 --> 00:08:01,350
I know a few people that use

315
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:03,800
Typeform, and they just prefer

316
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,339
that.

317
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:04,370
So

318
00:08:04,569 --> 00:08:06,290
whatever you're comfortable with,

319
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:06,779
use it.

320
00:08:06,779 --> 00:08:08,569
And if you're new to this, I would

321
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,100
just say,

322
00:08:09,129 --> 00:08:10,300
stick to Google Forms.

323
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,540
It's just like Google Docs or

324
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:12,379
anything else.

325
00:08:12,379 --> 00:08:14,209
And you don't have to have

326
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:15,750
anything really on here.

327
00:08:15,779 --> 00:08:17,990
I guess the only thing I would, I

328
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,660
would urge you to do is customize

329
00:08:20,769 --> 00:08:21,019
it a

330
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:21,870
little bit.

331
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:23,870
So it's on brand, like with a logo

332
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,449
and with your coloring and

333
00:08:25,449 --> 00:08:26,860
anything else like that.

334
00:08:26,889 --> 00:08:28,480
So anyways, what I want to do for

335
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,160
the remainder of this video is

336
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,420
walk you through each of the

337
00:08:32,019 --> 00:08:33,350
questions in our onboarding form,

338
00:08:33,418 --> 00:08:34,980
and just explain why we ask it and

339
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:37,570
why we ask it in that order.

340
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:37,658
And

341
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:39,559
just try to basically explain the

342
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:41,529
reasoning behind each part of this

343
00:08:41,529 --> 00:08:44,659
form so that you can take it and

344
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:46,059
learn the strategies and the

345
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:47,720
foundations and the fundamentals

346
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,759
and apply it to your own

347
00:08:48,809 --> 00:08:49,259
onboarding

348
00:08:49,289 --> 00:08:49,500
form.

349
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,309
So whether you're offering

350
00:08:51,309 --> 00:08:53,169
Facebook ads, whether you're

351
00:08:53,169 --> 00:08:54,940
offering email marketing, whether

352
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:55,149
you're

353
00:08:55,789 --> 00:08:57,200
offering web design, or you're

354
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,289
like a staffing agency and you're

355
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:02,470
helping place people with

356
00:09:02,649 --> 00:09:03,100
companies,

357
00:09:03,129 --> 00:09:04,409
like doesn't matter what your

358
00:09:04,409 --> 00:09:06,190
agency business is, you're always

359
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:08,059
going to want an onboarding form

360
00:09:08,059 --> 00:09:08,139
for

361
00:09:08,169 --> 00:09:09,460
new clients to fill out like right

362
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:09,789
away.

363
00:09:09,789 --> 00:09:10,970
It's like the first thing they

364
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:11,570
should do.

365
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:12,539
So anyways,

366
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:13,879
at the very beginning, very

367
00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:15,500
simply, we asked for their email

368
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,779
that just helps us keep track of

369
00:09:16,779 --> 00:09:17,580
everything.

370
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:19,399
We also asked for their name, who

371
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:21,029
asked for their phone number to

372
00:09:21,029 --> 00:09:23,179
reach out for business purposes,

373
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:25,690
just in case like sometimes it's,

374
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:28,500
it's difficult, or we have trouble

375
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,700
contacting clients through Slack

376
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:30,850
and

377
00:09:30,889 --> 00:09:31,580
through email.

378
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:33,090
So if there's ever like an

379
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:35,190
emergency, or we're just not able

380
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:36,539
to get in touch with one of

381
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:38,139
our clients after a long time, we

382
00:09:38,139 --> 00:09:39,700
at least have their phone number

383
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:40,460
as backup.

384
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:41,740
We also asked for their full

385
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:44,039
address of their business office

386
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:45,889
that's just used for like

387
00:09:45,889 --> 00:09:46,940
invoicing.

388
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:48,620
So when we invoice our clients,

389
00:09:48,649 --> 00:09:49,629
we could use your full name.

390
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:52,379
We also have their address and we,

391
00:09:52,379 --> 00:09:53,899
it's just a little bit more

392
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,120
legitimatized and it helps with

393
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,100
like a fraud detection on our

394
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,659
billing software.

395
00:09:59,659 --> 00:10:00,860
We also use that

396
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:03,490
since we're doing cold email

397
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:05,779
outreach, we use their address in

398
00:10:05,779 --> 00:10:07,980
our email signatures sometimes to

399
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:08,029
help

400
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:09,570
with deliverability.

401
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:11,370
So it's just helpful information

402
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:12,330
to have on hand.

403
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:13,820
And it's also helpful to know

404
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:15,100
also the time zones.

405
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,639
So like when you're sending

406
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:18,620
emails, like I live in New York,

407
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:19,580
so my emails are

408
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:22,360
sending off from like 8am to 8pm

409
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,740
Eastern time.

410
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:26,539
And if our client's business

411
00:10:26,539 --> 00:10:28,940
office is in California,

412
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:30,730
we'd want to do the same thing 8am

413
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:32,419
to 8pm, but it'd be Pacific time

414
00:10:32,659 --> 00:10:34,139
or whatever time zone that their

415
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:36,179
business office is located in.

416
00:10:36,179 --> 00:10:38,289
So that, that question asking for

417
00:10:38,289 --> 00:10:40,029
their address has a few different

418
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:40,299
use

419
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:40,769
cases.

420
00:10:40,909 --> 00:10:42,220
Right.

421
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,659
We also asked for their website,

422
00:10:43,659 --> 00:10:45,179
which is pretty straightforward

423
00:10:45,179 --> 00:10:46,059
because their website's

424
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:47,070
going to have a ton of

425
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:47,919
information.

426
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:49,299
We asked for their LinkedIn

427
00:10:49,299 --> 00:10:50,120
profile URL.

428
00:10:50,169 --> 00:10:51,950
And then we asked for

429
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:52,779
credentials.

430
00:10:52,779 --> 00:10:54,279
So like if you, if you need access

431
00:10:54,419 --> 00:10:55,779
to certain accounts, the

432
00:10:55,779 --> 00:10:57,659
onboarding form is a great

433
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:59,220
place to actually go out and get

434
00:10:59,220 --> 00:10:59,590
that.

435
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,110
So we asked what their LinkedIn

436
00:11:01,419 --> 00:11:02,059
profile URL is.

437
00:11:02,059 --> 00:11:02,539
We asked what

438
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:03,720
their account email is.

439
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,840
We asked what their account

440
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:05,639
password is.

441
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:07,179
And then we ask if they have an

442
00:11:07,179 --> 00:11:07,580
active

443
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:09,679
Calendly account, because we need

444
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:11,860
Calendly to perform our services.

445
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:13,470
And if they do, we ask what

446
00:11:13,529 --> 00:11:14,879
their email is and what their

447
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:15,629
password is.

448
00:11:15,629 --> 00:11:17,059
And if they answer no, we just add

449
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:18,700
that to our to-do list of

450
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:20,000
things we have to do for them,

451
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,460
which is to sign up for a Calendly

452
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:21,980
account.

453
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:23,740
So if you need login

454
00:11:24,289 --> 00:11:25,240
information, like if you're doing

455
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,490
SEO and you need access to like

456
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:28,379
their website or to their backend,

457
00:11:28,409 --> 00:11:29,730
this would be the place to ask.

458
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,080
If you're doing lead generation

459
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,299
and you need access to their

460
00:11:32,299 --> 00:11:32,700
LinkedIn

461
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:34,049
profile, you could do a very

462
00:11:34,049 --> 00:11:35,470
similar thing like we did here

463
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:36,620
with both LinkedIn.

464
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:37,419
And even if you need

465
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:39,240
access to Calendly, whatever you

466
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,870
need access to in terms of login

467
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:43,740
credentials, this is a great place

468
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:43,820
to

469
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:44,750
do it, which is just the

470
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:45,659
onboarding form.

471
00:11:45,659 --> 00:11:47,269
We've never really had a client

472
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,139
saying, Hey, I'm not comfortable

473
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:50,620
putting my password here.

474
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:52,299
And if they do, we've, I guess,

475
00:11:52,299 --> 00:11:53,740
actually I'd say we've had it

476
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:54,700
maybe two or

477
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:55,500
three times.

478
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,279
And anytime that happens, as soon

479
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,100
as we get on the onboarding call,

480
00:11:59,100 --> 00:11:59,840
we address it.

481
00:11:59,850 --> 00:11:59,899
And

482
00:11:59,929 --> 00:12:00,909
we're like, Hey, when we were

483
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,110
going through your onboarding

484
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:03,159
form, you didn't give us your

485
00:12:03,159 --> 00:12:03,379
LinkedIn

486
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:04,409
password.

487
00:12:04,409 --> 00:12:06,220
Mind if you spell that for us here

488
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,889
on the call and we could type it

489
00:12:07,889 --> 00:12:08,700
into Trello.

490
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:09,259
So it's,

491
00:12:09,289 --> 00:12:10,059
it's stored there.

492
00:12:10,059 --> 00:12:12,049
So anyways, that is the first

493
00:12:12,049 --> 00:12:13,100
section.

494
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,700
So again, just really basic

495
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:15,149
information

496
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:16,610
about their business.

497
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,539
That's, that's the first section.

498
00:12:18,539 --> 00:12:20,860
The second section is more about

499
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:21,100
their

500
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:23,669
business, but like in an offer in

501
00:12:23,669 --> 00:12:25,230
targeting sense.

502
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:27,549
So like you'll start to see these

503
00:12:28,009 --> 00:12:28,379
questions get a

504
00:12:28,409 --> 00:12:29,389
lot more complex and detail

505
00:12:29,559 --> 00:12:30,080
oriented.

506
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,340
So the first question is really

507
00:12:31,379 --> 00:12:31,830
generic.

508
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:32,860
It's like, who do you

509
00:12:32,889 --> 00:12:33,240
help?

510
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:34,710
What result can you get them?

511
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:36,279
Is there a specific timeframe?

512
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:37,820
How do you get these results?

513
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:39,320
Please answer all these questions

514
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,120
in fine detail.

515
00:12:40,269 --> 00:12:44,259
So basically this first question

516
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:45,820
is starting to get

517
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:48,120
them to think like, who do I help?

518
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,649
What results do I get?

519
00:12:49,649 --> 00:12:51,490
How long does it take me to get

520
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:52,269
results?

521
00:12:52,409 --> 00:12:53,580
How do I get those results?

522
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:54,970
And they're starting to consider

523
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:55,830
these questions.

524
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:56,700
It's like a good way to

525
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:57,960
ease them into our form.

526
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,429
So this is all like, if we could

527
00:12:59,429 --> 00:13:00,940
answer these questions on an

528
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:02,590
individual level,

529
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:03,559
who do you help?

530
00:13:03,559 --> 00:13:05,259
What result can you get them?

531
00:13:05,259 --> 00:13:07,100
Is there a specific timeframe?

532
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:07,500
And also,

533
00:13:07,529 --> 00:13:09,250
how do you get these results?

534
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:10,299
We're going to be golden.

535
00:13:10,299 --> 00:13:11,500
It's going to be really easy for

536
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:11,820
us to

537
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:12,440
do our job.

538
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,919
Like we could write scripts for

539
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:16,600
that, uh, really easily if we have

540
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,340
answers to all these

541
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:17,990
questions.

542
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:19,179
So that's the first one.

543
00:13:19,179 --> 00:13:20,549
It just kind of opens things up

544
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:21,980
and then we get more detail

545
00:13:22,179 --> 00:13:23,799
oriented into the target market or

546
00:13:23,809 --> 00:13:25,429
their ideal client profile.

547
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:27,090
So I say, who exactly is your

548
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:27,419
target

549
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:28,000
market?

550
00:13:28,029 --> 00:13:29,720
In other words, who would you like

551
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:31,340
for us to send personalized

552
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:32,149
messages to?

553
00:13:32,149 --> 00:13:32,379
What are

554
00:13:32,409 --> 00:13:33,389
their job titles?

555
00:13:33,559 --> 00:13:34,950
Tell us everything you know about

556
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:37,659
them, location, revenue, company

557
00:13:37,659 --> 00:13:39,019
size, job title,

558
00:13:39,629 --> 00:13:40,700
industry, etc.

559
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,309
Please provide detailed answers

560
00:13:42,309 --> 00:13:43,740
for all of these subcategory

561
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,340
questions for optimal results.

562
00:13:46,009 --> 00:13:47,870
So also the way we word this, the

563
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:50,700
questions is we're explaining like

564
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,299
the reasoning behind the

565
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:53,019
questions too.

566
00:13:53,019 --> 00:13:54,600
And a lot of the times, and we're

567
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:55,750
also spelling it out.

568
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,259
It's not just like, who is your

569
00:13:57,289 --> 00:13:58,029
target market?

570
00:13:58,029 --> 00:13:59,279
What are their job titles?

571
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:00,460
What is their revenue?

572
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:01,740
Like we're actually adding some

573
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:02,460
commentary

574
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:03,179
to it.

575
00:14:03,179 --> 00:14:04,759
So they're not like confused

576
00:14:04,909 --> 00:14:06,389
because some of the times you

577
00:14:06,389 --> 00:14:07,899
might have a question in mind that

578
00:14:07,899 --> 00:14:07,980
you

579
00:14:08,009 --> 00:14:08,779
want to ask.

580
00:14:08,779 --> 00:14:10,279
And it doesn't, it might not

581
00:14:10,429 --> 00:14:12,200
translate or make total sense to

582
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,500
the client and they might

583
00:14:13,529 --> 00:14:15,019
answer it in a way that you didn't

584
00:14:15,019 --> 00:14:16,659
really intend them to answer it.

585
00:14:16,659 --> 00:14:18,059
So you just want to be really

586
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:19,330
clear with your wording and

587
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:20,549
language throughout your

588
00:14:20,549 --> 00:14:21,480
onboarding form.

589
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,940
So that's the second question.

590
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:24,990
A third question we ask is, are

591
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:27,200
these companies you'd like for us

592
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,940
to target with your campaigns,

593
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:30,820
hiring for any specific roles that

594
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,419
would give us insight into their

595
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:33,899
need for your offer?

596
00:14:34,409 --> 00:14:35,840
So this is just like, if we, if

597
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,419
they wanted to target people by

598
00:14:37,419 --> 00:14:39,580
active job posts, like if they're

599
00:14:40,139 --> 00:14:41,370
targeting companies, hiring for

600
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:42,740
salespeople or targeting

601
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:44,700
companies, hiring for developers,

602
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:46,519
like this is especially true for

603
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:48,259
like the staffing industry or the

604
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:50,139
recruiting industry is targeting,

605
00:14:50,169 --> 00:14:51,889
like having your ideal client

606
00:14:51,909 --> 00:14:54,039
profile, having like vacancies or

607
00:14:54,039 --> 00:14:55,100
job openings.

608
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,039
So that's a question

609
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:58,139
we ask to get more detailed and

610
00:14:58,139 --> 00:15:00,279
more targeted with our campaigns

611
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:01,659
and our strategy.

612
00:15:01,659 --> 00:15:02,669
So we're just using

613
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:04,600
all these questions to formulate a

614
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,139
strategy for this client so that

615
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:07,659
we could get the best results

616
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:08,129
possible.

617
00:15:08,269 --> 00:15:09,820
And I'll tell you the clients that

618
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,429
take the most time to fill out the

619
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,299
onboarding form

620
00:15:12,909 --> 00:15:14,230
responses and get us all the

621
00:15:14,299 --> 00:15:16,629
answers we need in the, in like a

622
00:15:16,629 --> 00:15:19,500
very detailed way, always do the

623
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:19,899
best,

624
00:15:19,929 --> 00:15:21,580
like always do the best because we

625
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:23,179
just have so much to go off of.

626
00:15:23,179 --> 00:15:25,259
The next question we ask is,

627
00:15:25,289 --> 00:15:27,370
do your prospects use any specific

628
00:15:27,379 --> 00:15:29,490
technologies that you know of that

629
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:31,340
we can base our targeting on?

630
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:34,389
So like, this is very, uh, common

631
00:15:34,389 --> 00:15:36,059
for email marketing agencies, like

632
00:15:36,059 --> 00:15:36,860
they're targeting

633
00:15:36,889 --> 00:15:38,990
e-commerce brands that use Shopify

634
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:39,980
and Klaviyo.

635
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:42,299
So that's what that question is

636
00:15:42,299 --> 00:15:43,419
there for specifically.

637
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:45,049
Sometimes we'll have clients

638
00:15:45,049 --> 00:15:46,379
target like people using

639
00:15:46,409 --> 00:15:48,379
Salesforce, whatever it might be.

640
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,860
Um, this is again, another

641
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:53,580
question specific to our service

642
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:55,179
that we like to ask to get more

643
00:15:55,309 --> 00:15:55,659
clarity

644
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:57,899
on how do we find the best quality

645
00:15:57,899 --> 00:16:00,620
leads for the, for our new client?

646
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:01,179
Like what are,

647
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,419
who are they really looking to get

648
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:03,100
in touch with?

649
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:05,179
And then the next thing we do

650
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:07,769
is say, uh, please provide us a

651
00:16:07,769 --> 00:16:10,720
list of many keywords as possible,

652
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,379
uh, that we can use a scan

653
00:16:12,409 --> 00:16:13,730
for when building a list of ideal

654
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:15,179
prospects in your target market to

655
00:16:15,179 --> 00:16:16,940
send personalized messages to.

656
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:19,149
For example, if you're targeting

657
00:16:19,149 --> 00:16:21,360
SEO and keywords such as SEO would

658
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,269
work well.

659
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:24,309
Um, and you could also add

660
00:16:24,409 --> 00:16:25,820
like, this is like a sub

661
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,759
description or a, yeah, just a

662
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:30,279
description here that explains

663
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:30,830
what you're

664
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:32,200
asking in a little more detail.

665
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,450
So we just say, we'll scan their

666
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:35,340
social media pages and SEO website

667
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:37,059
descriptions for these keywords to

668
00:16:37,059 --> 00:16:38,299
help them understand.

669
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:40,440
Like what types of keywords

670
00:16:42,169 --> 00:16:43,639
they should include essentially.

671
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:44,940
So that's another question.

672
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,299
So all these, these last few

673
00:16:46,299 --> 00:16:46,700
questions

674
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:48,570
are just getting really specific

675
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:50,190
to, uh, target market and just

676
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:52,029
targeting and ideal client

677
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:52,590
profiling

678
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:53,570
in general.

679
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:55,659
So you'll probably recognize some

680
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,700
of these questions, uh, or just

681
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,149
understand some of the terms

682
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:01,289
used throughout, uh, based on what

683
00:17:01,289 --> 00:17:02,669
you learned in, in the lead

684
00:17:02,669 --> 00:17:03,899
generation module.

685
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:04,619
And again,

686
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:06,160
I would encourage you to actually

687
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:07,578
like go through our onboarding

688
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:08,940
form because it could really help

689
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:09,098
you

690
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:10,720
with your lead gen, uh, just to

691
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,338
help answer some questions that

692
00:17:12,338 --> 00:17:14,059
you might not have considered yet.

693
00:17:14,088 --> 00:17:15,539
Uh, the next question we ask is

694
00:17:15,539 --> 00:17:17,078
just asking if they have a list of

695
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:18,539
prospects to start with.

696
00:17:18,568 --> 00:17:20,420
Um, so like some clients will come

697
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:21,900
in and they'll have a list of

698
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,740
companies that they want to get

699
00:17:23,769 --> 00:17:25,460
like they want to target.

700
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:27,250
So if they do, we basically just

701
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,180
tell them to email us with the

702
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:30,059
data

703
00:17:30,089 --> 00:17:31,559
and then we tell them the process

704
00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:33,289
we'll take from there so that they

705
00:17:33,289 --> 00:17:35,259
know like it's all in our hands

706
00:17:35,289 --> 00:17:36,789
after they just send us the file,

707
00:17:36,809 --> 00:17:38,440
which is basically saying, we'll

708
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,319
take it all off your

709
00:17:39,369 --> 00:17:39,980
hands.

710
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:41,779
Just send us the file and we'll go

711
00:17:41,789 --> 00:17:42,700
from there.

712
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,779
So again, it's just very detailed.

713
00:17:44,779 --> 00:17:45,019
It's

714
00:17:45,049 --> 00:17:46,029
just walking them through

715
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,160
literally our entire process.

716
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,140
Cause once we onboard a client,

717
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:52,069
we have to onboard them.

718
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:54,200
And then in the backend strategy

719
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:56,039
wise, we're devising a strategy

720
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:56,579
for their

721
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:58,039
target market and who to target

722
00:17:58,039 --> 00:17:59,450
and how to build a search around

723
00:17:59,450 --> 00:17:59,900
that.

724
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,180
And then we're devising a

725
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:03,480
strategy around scripting and how

726
00:18:03,619 --> 00:18:05,869
do we write scripts or write copy

727
00:18:05,869 --> 00:18:07,579
that get the target market's

728
00:18:07,609 --> 00:18:09,160
attention that we're going after.

729
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,700
And literally all these questions

730
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,140
are helping us to do just that.

731
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:13,619
Cause we don't know, like we're

732
00:18:13,619 --> 00:18:16,049
not experts about these businesses

733
00:18:16,059 --> 00:18:17,980
yet because it's, it's not our

734
00:18:18,529 --> 00:18:19,869
business, but it is our business

735
00:18:19,869 --> 00:18:21,269
to know and know as much as

736
00:18:21,269 --> 00:18:23,500
possible about these businesses as

737
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:23,980
possible.

738
00:18:24,009 --> 00:18:26,279
Um, I said, it's possible like

739
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:27,470
three times, I think in that

740
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:28,140
sentence,

741
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:29,819
but anyways, uh, to, to ensure

742
00:18:29,819 --> 00:18:31,569
that we get them the best possible

743
00:18:31,569 --> 00:18:32,059
results.

744
00:18:32,089 --> 00:18:33,069
And I said possible again,

745
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:36,619
anyways, um, before we move on,

746
00:18:36,619 --> 00:18:38,509
we, we have like one of these book

747
00:18:38,569 --> 00:18:39,339
end questions.

748
00:18:39,339 --> 00:18:42,380
So like, what I've seen is, uh,

749
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:44,859
throughout this onboarding form,

750
00:18:44,859 --> 00:18:45,579
like after a

751
00:18:45,609 --> 00:18:47,869
few questions, it could get blurry

752
00:18:47,869 --> 00:18:50,019
and like shorter types of answers

753
00:18:50,019 --> 00:18:51,339
towards the end.

754
00:18:51,369 --> 00:18:52,930
So like, I basically like to

755
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:54,609
separate many sections using

756
00:18:54,609 --> 00:18:55,980
questions like this, like, Hey,

757
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:57,799
just take a second to tell us and

758
00:18:57,799 --> 00:18:59,369
confirm whether or not you

759
00:18:59,369 --> 00:19:01,099
provided as much information as

760
00:19:01,109 --> 00:19:01,420
you could

761
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:02,930
think of to the target market

762
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:03,660
question.

763
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:04,910
So it's just them taking a step

764
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:05,980
back to say, all right,

765
00:19:06,009 --> 00:19:08,400
let me go back and read, read,

766
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:09,990
reread these questions and see if

767
00:19:10,039 --> 00:19:11,420
there's anything else I could

768
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:12,299
think of

769
00:19:12,329 --> 00:19:14,369
that they might, you know, see as

770
00:19:14,369 --> 00:19:15,500
being helpful.

771
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,710
So that question, it could come

772
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:18,539
off as like

773
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:21,259
being a little forward, but I

774
00:19:21,259 --> 00:19:22,849
found it to be super helpful for

775
00:19:22,849 --> 00:19:24,140
them to just go back and say,

776
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:25,440
all right, wait, I'm kind of

777
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,700
zooming through this.

778
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:27,700
Let me see if there's any more

779
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,099
detail I should add to

780
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:31,259
really these first few questions.

781
00:19:31,259 --> 00:19:33,259
After that question, it's like,

782
00:19:33,259 --> 00:19:34,299
again, like a checkpoint.

783
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:36,470
Now we pivot to their offer so

784
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:38,279
that we know how to explain their

785
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:39,660
offer and our messaging.

786
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:40,220
So we say,

787
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:41,750
what exactly do you sell to your

788
00:19:41,769 --> 00:19:42,519
target market?

789
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:44,220
Explain it in very fine detail.

790
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,019
Tell us everything

791
00:19:45,049 --> 00:19:46,710
in your own commentary, as many

792
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:48,059
details as possible.

793
00:19:48,059 --> 00:19:51,460
Then we go into, again, questions

794
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:52,779
very specific to

795
00:19:52,809 --> 00:19:53,549
our agency.

796
00:19:53,549 --> 00:19:54,710
So like scripting.

797
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:56,559
So again, it's a little bit easier

798
00:19:56,569 --> 00:19:58,109
for you to understand since

799
00:19:58,170 --> 00:19:59,859
there is a whole section on lead

800
00:19:59,859 --> 00:20:00,779
generation.

801
00:20:00,779 --> 00:20:02,460
So you understand now what our

802
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:03,259
business does,

803
00:20:03,289 --> 00:20:05,410
like what our service offering is,

804
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:07,319
which is just to do cold email and

805
00:20:07,369 --> 00:20:08,700
LinkedIn outreach on behalf of

806
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:10,279
our clients to get them on the

807
00:20:10,279 --> 00:20:12,049
phone with who they define in the

808
00:20:12,049 --> 00:20:13,740
previous questions to be their

809
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:14,029
target

810
00:20:14,089 --> 00:20:16,220
market or ideal client profile.

811
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:18,119
And in order to do that, we need

812
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:20,299
them to define their ideal client

813
00:20:20,329 --> 00:20:20,970
profile.

814
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:22,599
And we need them to define their

815
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,220
offer so that we could write

816
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:26,460
really specific and high

817
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,470
converting scripts.

818
00:20:27,619 --> 00:20:28,759
So we also say here, like our

819
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:30,029
scripting is question based.

820
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:31,019
With that said,

821
00:20:31,049 --> 00:20:32,349
are there any questions you could

822
00:20:32,349 --> 00:20:33,730
think of that your prospects would

823
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:34,859
be likely to respond to?

824
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:36,680
Think about a scenario where you

825
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,700
were cold calling a prospect, what

826
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:39,819
questions would you ask them?

827
00:20:39,819 --> 00:20:40,140
So

828
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:41,400
again, these questions are super

829
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:41,789
unique.

830
00:20:41,789 --> 00:20:42,619
They're not just like,

831
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:44,640
are like, what questions would you

832
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,130
ask someone on a cold call?

833
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:47,259
Like we're explaining, we're

834
00:20:47,259 --> 00:20:47,579
putting

835
00:20:47,609 --> 00:20:49,190
them in our shoes so that they

836
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:50,869
could understand the use case

837
00:20:50,869 --> 00:20:52,539
behind each of these questions as

838
00:20:52,539 --> 00:20:53,099
well,

839
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:55,029
which incentivizes them more to

840
00:20:55,099 --> 00:20:57,059
actually take the time to fill out

841
00:20:57,059 --> 00:20:58,539
each of these questions with as

842
00:20:58,569 --> 00:20:59,900
much detail as possible.

843
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:02,240
The next question we ask is like a

844
00:21:02,299 --> 00:21:04,220
great question that really helps

845
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:04,430
like

846
00:21:05,069 --> 00:21:06,680
overcome objections or formulate

847
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,779
different parts of our script,

848
00:21:08,779 --> 00:21:11,660
which is to say, what are some

849
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:12,059
problems

850
00:21:12,089 --> 00:21:13,680
your ideal clients have that you

851
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,759
can solve for them?

852
00:21:14,759 --> 00:21:16,539
Or in other words, please share at

853
00:21:16,539 --> 00:21:17,019
least three to

854
00:21:17,049 --> 00:21:18,950
five pain points your clients are,

855
00:21:19,019 --> 00:21:20,549
excuse me, are known to have.

856
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:23,660
So let me just pause this.

857
00:21:24,269 --> 00:21:24,940
Yeah.

858
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:26,500
So that question is super helpful

859
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,940
because they'll just list out a

860
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:29,180
bunch of problems that we

861
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:31,710
could call out in our scripting or

862
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:34,150
in our like some of the questions

863
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:35,579
we ask through email and through

864
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:36,589
LinkedIn.

865
00:21:36,589 --> 00:21:39,029
So just knowing the problems that

866
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:41,470
the ideal client is most likely

867
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,819
dealing with or facing

868
00:21:43,849 --> 00:21:46,119
is a super powerful piece of

869
00:21:46,269 --> 00:21:48,289
information to have, at least for

870
00:21:48,289 --> 00:21:50,220
us to perform our services.

871
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:50,700
So again,

872
00:21:51,309 --> 00:21:53,410
whatever it is you're offering at

873
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:55,470
your agency, just think what

874
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:57,150
information do I absolutely need

875
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:57,819
to have

876
00:21:58,410 --> 00:21:59,910
on each of the clients that I'm

877
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:01,519
working with to make sure that I

878
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:03,019
get them the best possible

879
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:05,319
experience and results by working

880
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:07,980
with me and just think through it.

881
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:10,220
Like every just basically

882
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:11,880
think through, okay, I onboard a

883
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:12,400
client.

884
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,740
What do I actually have to do?

885
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:16,380
I have, I know for my agency,

886
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:18,650
I got to get them a list of leads.

887
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:20,390
So I got to know what kind of

888
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:21,369
leads they want.

889
00:22:21,369 --> 00:22:21,900
And I got to know

890
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,359
everything about those types of

891
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:24,759
leads and the companies and the

892
00:22:24,759 --> 00:22:26,079
size and the revenue and the

893
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:26,779
industry

894
00:22:26,809 --> 00:22:28,059
and the keywords, right?

895
00:22:28,059 --> 00:22:29,369
Like we already asked and went

896
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:30,289
through in our form.

897
00:22:30,539 --> 00:22:31,579
And then once I have a

898
00:22:31,609 --> 00:22:33,250
list, I got to write a series of

899
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:34,799
scripts, like to do the lead

900
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:36,619
generation and the outreach.

901
00:22:36,619 --> 00:22:37,180
So to write

902
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:38,710
scripts, I have to know about

903
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:39,480
their offer.

904
00:22:39,619 --> 00:22:41,140
I also have to know about their

905
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:42,059
guarantees.

906
00:22:42,059 --> 00:22:42,779
I also have to

907
00:22:42,809 --> 00:22:44,309
know about the problems they

908
00:22:44,329 --> 00:22:44,839
solve.

909
00:22:44,839 --> 00:22:46,230
I also have to know about any

910
00:22:46,539 --> 00:22:47,660
results they've gotten or case

911
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:47,980
studies,

912
00:22:48,009 --> 00:22:48,990
which we're just about to get to

913
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:49,420
here.

914
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:51,430
So the next question is asking

915
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:52,779
them to type out results

916
00:22:52,809 --> 00:22:54,400
they've gotten for their clients

917
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,740
and if they've profited from

918
00:22:55,779 --> 00:22:57,579
working with them, what niches

919
00:22:57,609 --> 00:22:58,589
they were in and how did they

920
00:22:58,759 --> 00:22:59,880
become a client in the first

921
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,299
place.

922
00:23:00,299 --> 00:23:01,420
So there's actually a lot of

923
00:23:02,029 --> 00:23:03,670
questions packed in here, which is

924
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:05,740
just basically all geared towards

925
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:08,140
what results are you able to

926
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:08,539
generate?

927
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:10,380
Because if someone that's a common

928
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:11,680
question and it's also one of the

929
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,470
most powerful pieces of

930
00:23:14,109 --> 00:23:15,250
information to use and leverage

931
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:17,299
and sales and in general is just

932
00:23:17,319 --> 00:23:19,400
social proof and results like

933
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:19,819
proof

934
00:23:19,849 --> 00:23:23,220
of results that are in demand or

935
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:25,960
desirable by other people in the

936
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:28,140
same industry that you're already

937
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:29,509
reaching out to based on all the

938
00:23:29,509 --> 00:23:30,950
information you collected in

939
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:33,339
previous questions about their

940
00:23:33,339 --> 00:23:34,059
target market.

941
00:23:34,089 --> 00:23:36,140
So that's a great question.

942
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:37,890
The next question is a little more

943
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:38,619
specific.

944
00:23:38,619 --> 00:23:39,960
We're asking for an actual case

945
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:40,460
study

946
00:23:41,049 --> 00:23:42,940
and what positive results they're

947
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:44,509
able to get with that person's

948
00:23:44,779 --> 00:23:46,220
case study and we're asking them

949
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:46,349
to

950
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:48,019
use a framework that we provided

951
00:23:48,019 --> 00:23:48,930
for them below.

952
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:50,210
So we wrote out this whole

953
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:51,579
framework and gave them,

954
00:23:51,609 --> 00:23:53,490
I think, three examples of how

955
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:55,759
that framework is supposed to be

956
00:23:55,759 --> 00:23:58,140
used and basically said,

957
00:23:58,170 --> 00:23:59,309
okay, now that you see a few

958
00:23:59,319 --> 00:24:00,660
examples of how this framework

959
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:03,019
works, give us a few case studies

960
00:24:03,019 --> 00:24:03,339
using

961
00:24:03,369 --> 00:24:03,980
that framework.

962
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:05,440
And the reason we asked him to do

963
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,789
it in that framework is because

964
00:24:06,789 --> 00:24:08,220
that's part of

965
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:08,779
our script.

966
00:24:08,829 --> 00:24:10,849
So we don't even have to think

967
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:11,579
twice.

968
00:24:11,579 --> 00:24:12,940
Most of the time, we might brush

969
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:13,900
up a few words

970
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:15,750
and cut things out and just make

971
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:17,809
things read a little bit smoother

972
00:24:17,809 --> 00:24:19,740
to fit into the overall email

973
00:24:19,769 --> 00:24:21,349
or the overall script that this is

974
00:24:21,349 --> 00:24:22,700
going to be inserted into.

975
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:25,180
But other than that, there's

976
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:25,500
different

977
00:24:25,529 --> 00:24:26,509
things you can do in your

978
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,059
onboarding form responses like

979
00:24:28,059 --> 00:24:29,819
this, where like the intention is

980
00:24:29,819 --> 00:24:30,299
for them to

981
00:24:30,329 --> 00:24:32,119
write a part of the script that

982
00:24:32,119 --> 00:24:33,789
you're working on, or at least

983
00:24:34,059 --> 00:24:36,059
give you like a starting point for

984
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:36,200
that

985
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:36,700
script.

986
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:39,500
So that question is super helpful.

987
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,109
The next two questions, again,

988
00:24:41,109 --> 00:24:42,119
also very helpful.

989
00:24:42,119 --> 00:24:42,269
Like,

990
00:24:42,329 --> 00:24:44,049
do you have any guarantee to your

991
00:24:44,049 --> 00:24:44,470
clients?

992
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:45,349
And if so, what is it?

993
00:24:45,349 --> 00:24:47,019
Because guarantees are super easy

994
00:24:47,019 --> 00:24:47,180
to

995
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:48,859
leverage when you're in sales.

996
00:24:48,859 --> 00:24:50,630
Like what is the biggest issue

997
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:52,619
people face in sales is they're

998
00:24:52,619 --> 00:24:53,420
trying to build

999
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:55,269
trust and get someone to commit

1000
00:24:55,269 --> 00:24:57,329
because the person doesn't want to

1001
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:58,740
take on risk.

1002
00:24:58,819 --> 00:24:59,869
So if you can mitigate

1003
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:02,490
risk and build trust by offering a

1004
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:04,750
guarantee, and if we're aware of

1005
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:06,670
that guarantee, we can leverage

1006
00:25:07,059 --> 00:25:07,230
that

1007
00:25:07,869 --> 00:25:09,009
really strongly.

1008
00:25:09,009 --> 00:25:10,269
So that's why we asked that

1009
00:25:10,269 --> 00:25:10,779
question.

1010
00:25:11,019 --> 00:25:12,299
And then the last question, again,

1011
00:25:12,329 --> 00:25:13,829
super, super important is what

1012
00:25:13,849 --> 00:25:15,349
makes you unique and different

1013
00:25:15,349 --> 00:25:16,700
from your competitors?

1014
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:17,180
You're always

1015
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:18,549
going to want to know this about

1016
00:25:18,549 --> 00:25:20,089
your clients because you're going

1017
00:25:20,089 --> 00:25:21,019
to want to, you're going to

1018
00:25:21,049 --> 00:25:22,549
want to press on that a lot and

1019
00:25:22,569 --> 00:25:23,650
capitalize on it.

1020
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:25,250
It's like, what is unique and

1021
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:26,299
different about your

1022
00:25:26,329 --> 00:25:27,720
client compared to everyone else

1023
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,069
in their market that's trying to

1024
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:31,019
grow at the same pace or at a

1025
00:25:31,049 --> 00:25:32,920
faster pace, or that's already 10

1026
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,470
times the size of their business

1027
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:36,119
and still looking to aggressively

1028
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:36,809
grow?

1029
00:25:36,809 --> 00:25:39,299
Like how does your client stand

1030
00:25:39,299 --> 00:25:42,029
out and differentiate from clients

1031
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,980
that are businesses that are half

1032
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:45,829
the size or businesses that are 10

1033
00:25:45,829 --> 00:25:46,779
times the size?

1034
00:25:46,779 --> 00:25:48,140
How do they survive?

1035
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:49,089
Why do they deserve

1036
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:49,940
to survive?

1037
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:51,829
What about them is different and

1038
00:25:51,829 --> 00:25:52,460
unique?

1039
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:54,279
And if you can get a clear answer

1040
00:25:54,279 --> 00:25:55,339
to this, again,

1041
00:25:55,369 --> 00:25:56,710
it's just so much leverage.

1042
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:57,799
And especially for lead

1043
00:25:57,799 --> 00:25:59,400
generation, because that's like

1044
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:00,299
the most common

1045
00:26:00,329 --> 00:26:01,990
question you get is like, what's

1046
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:03,619
different about what about your

1047
00:26:03,619 --> 00:26:05,900
lead generation agency compared to

1048
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:06,059
the

1049
00:26:06,089 --> 00:26:07,980
10 other lead generation agencies

1050
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:09,549
emailing me asking if they want,

1051
00:26:09,819 --> 00:26:11,950
if I want to work with them.

1052
00:26:12,009 --> 00:26:13,650
So if you have an easy answer to

1053
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:15,430
that or a clear answer, and also

1054
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:17,579
one that makes sense and shows

1055
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:19,369
value, you'll be in a really good

1056
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:20,140
position.

1057
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:24,029
So that is all for section two.

1058
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,250
So again, section two is

1059
00:26:25,289 --> 00:26:26,559
just collecting all the

1060
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:28,180
information we need about our

1061
00:26:28,259 --> 00:26:29,980
client's business to know them

1062
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:30,779
inside and out,

1063
00:26:30,809 --> 00:26:32,299
just like it's our own business.

1064
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:34,940
And also fit it right into our

1065
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:36,680
strategy of what do we actually

1066
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:36,940
have

1067
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:38,140
to do once a client sign?

1068
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:39,240
We have to get them leads.

1069
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:40,859
And how do we get them leads?

1070
00:26:40,859 --> 00:26:41,740
We have to build a

1071
00:26:41,769 --> 00:26:42,069
list.

1072
00:26:42,069 --> 00:26:43,269
And we have to continue to build

1073
00:26:43,299 --> 00:26:43,609
this.

1074
00:26:43,609 --> 00:26:44,700
So we have to know everything

1075
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:45,740
about how those lists should

1076
00:26:45,769 --> 00:26:46,299
be built.

1077
00:26:46,349 --> 00:26:47,970
And we also have to write scripts.

1078
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:49,130
And we want to have a lot of

1079
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:50,779
different variations of scripts

1080
00:26:50,809 --> 00:26:52,579
to test because you always want to

1081
00:26:52,579 --> 00:26:53,359
be testing.

1082
00:26:53,359 --> 00:26:54,970
And the only way we have that is

1083
00:26:54,970 --> 00:26:56,109
by collecting all this

1084
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,640
different information using

1085
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,059
different point of views and

1086
00:26:59,079 --> 00:27:00,910
perspectives in our questioning,

1087
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:01,180
like you

1088
00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:01,420
saw.

1089
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:03,059
And that's really it.

1090
00:27:03,059 --> 00:27:05,339
Everything else I can fill in.

1091
00:27:05,339 --> 00:27:07,630
So just think about your process

1092
00:27:08,099 --> 00:27:08,220
of,

1093
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,519
okay, I deliver this service.

1094
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:11,650
How do you fulfill on it?

1095
00:27:11,650 --> 00:27:14,059
You want to map that out from A to

1096
00:27:14,059 --> 00:27:14,299
Z,

1097
00:27:14,329 --> 00:27:16,039
from as soon as someone signs to

1098
00:27:16,049 --> 00:27:17,539
when that service has been

1099
00:27:17,539 --> 00:27:19,740
delivered, or to the point where

1100
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:20,740
the service

1101
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:22,440
is delivered for the first time

1102
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,019
and then is in continuation.

1103
00:27:24,019 --> 00:27:25,500
Because like, for the most part,

1104
00:27:25,529 --> 00:27:27,240
your service is never going to be

1105
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:28,460
completed, right?

1106
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,700
Like for us, we're not like done

1107
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:31,400
after we do

1108
00:27:32,109 --> 00:27:32,400
something.

1109
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,650
It's we're continually driving new

1110
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:35,059
leads.

1111
00:27:35,259 --> 00:27:37,119
And what I think about with the

1112
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:38,700
onboarding form is

1113
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:40,920
what do I need from the client or

1114
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:43,059
what parts of the process will I

1115
00:27:43,059 --> 00:27:44,940
need to involve the client in

1116
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:45,569
to get done.

1117
00:27:45,569 --> 00:27:46,980
And that's what I fill in the gaps

1118
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:48,460
with, with the onboarding form.

1119
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:49,740
So think about

1120
00:27:50,349 --> 00:27:51,829
everything that you need to do to

1121
00:27:51,829 --> 00:27:54,180
basically go from having a client

1122
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:56,059
sign to getting their service

1123
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:56,869
fulfilled.

1124
00:27:56,869 --> 00:27:58,680
And then ask yourself, which of

1125
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,630
those steps do you require insight

1126
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:01,740
from the client on?

1127
00:28:01,769 --> 00:28:03,150
And then stick it in the

1128
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:04,460
onboarding form.

1129
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:06,349
Because that's your best chance of

1130
00:28:06,349 --> 00:28:06,849
getting

1131
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:08,529
a lot of clarity and a lot of

1132
00:28:08,529 --> 00:28:09,660
information.

1133
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:10,779
And then you file it away.

1134
00:28:10,779 --> 00:28:11,500
As soon as you get the

1135
00:28:11,529 --> 00:28:13,380
onboarding form responses, like I

1136
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:14,930
said, Google just send you an

1137
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:16,299
email that says,

1138
00:28:16,329 --> 00:28:18,369
hey, new onboarding form or new

1139
00:28:18,369 --> 00:28:19,849
form responses for and then

1140
00:28:20,059 --> 00:28:21,579
whatever the name of the form is.

1141
00:28:21,609 --> 00:28:23,420
And then you go on there, you

1142
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:25,480
could review them, you could print

1143
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,059
them out.

1144
00:28:26,059 --> 00:28:26,910
And then you could store

1145
00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:28,410
them in the Trello board so that,

1146
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:30,000
you know, three months later, you

1147
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,420
get a guy that asks you a question

1148
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:32,839
if you're running a cold email

1149
00:28:32,839 --> 00:28:33,720
agency, or whatever.

1150
00:28:33,859 --> 00:28:34,869
And they're like, hey, what makes

1151
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:35,819
you unique?

1152
00:28:35,849 --> 00:28:36,789
Why should I work with you?

1153
00:28:36,789 --> 00:28:38,119
And you're like, hmm, I can't

1154
00:28:38,119 --> 00:28:39,740
think of it off the top of my

1155
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:40,059
head.

1156
00:28:40,089 --> 00:28:41,210
But I know I got a question in my

1157
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,619
onboarding form where I asked them

1158
00:28:42,619 --> 00:28:43,900
what makes them unique.

1159
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:45,200
Let's go check that out and

1160
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,200
refresh my memory.

1161
00:28:46,339 --> 00:28:48,170
So that's why it's just such a

1162
00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:48,940
great tool.

1163
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:51,710
Just like the contract, it's like

1164
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:53,000
something that you'll always have

1165
00:28:53,049 --> 00:28:54,460
to refer back to

1166
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:55,470
for different parts of your

1167
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,619
fulfillment process.

1168
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:57,819
So I think what we're what you're

1169
00:28:57,819 --> 00:28:59,210
seeing here is just a trend of

1170
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:00,049
like fulfillment

1171
00:29:00,089 --> 00:29:01,980
is not so much.

1172
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:03,599
Obviously, the skill set and

1173
00:29:03,819 --> 00:29:05,170
knowing how to actually fulfill

1174
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:05,900
and get results

1175
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:07,099
is super important.

1176
00:29:07,099 --> 00:29:08,920
But it starts with having a

1177
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,980
legitimatized service agreement.

1178
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:11,660
It starts with

1179
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:13,960
having a rigid onboarding process.

1180
00:29:14,109 --> 00:29:15,869
It starts with having an actual

1181
00:29:15,869 --> 00:29:17,339
onboarding form to collect

1182
00:29:17,339 --> 00:29:18,099
information

1183
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:18,940
from your client.

1184
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:21,000
Like these are all mini steps that

1185
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,619
I feel like are completely skipped

1186
00:29:22,619 --> 00:29:23,329
or looked over

1187
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:26,309
an effort to try to salivate

1188
00:29:26,309 --> 00:29:28,150
results without actually looking

1189
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:29,809
at the real issues, which are

1190
00:29:29,849 --> 00:29:31,690
the underlying issues, which we're

1191
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:33,190
talking about here early on in

1192
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:34,059
this module.

1193
00:29:34,059 --> 00:29:35,740
So that was section two.

1194
00:29:35,769 --> 00:29:37,430
Now, real quick, section three is

1195
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:38,220
really short.

1196
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:39,250
It's just your goals.

1197
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:42,380
So when you're an agency owner,

1198
00:29:42,410 --> 00:29:44,390
the only time I heard this from

1199
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:46,390
one of my mentors, like two or

1200
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,710
three years ago,

1201
00:29:47,769 --> 00:29:49,430
I used to work with a guy locally

1202
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:51,230
who ran a lot of businesses, and

1203
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,339
he was one of my first clients

1204
00:29:53,369 --> 00:29:55,230
at an agency that I used to run

1205
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:56,829
two or three years ago.

1206
00:29:57,099 --> 00:30:00,079
And he said the like we were

1207
00:30:00,269 --> 00:30:00,859
working together

1208
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:02,470
and we were very I was very my

1209
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:04,420
agency was very unorganized and it

1210
00:30:04,619 --> 00:30:06,220
wasn't very professional.

1211
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:07,730
And he has the client was very

1212
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:08,460
confused.

1213
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:11,420
So he said the only reason a

1214
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:13,980
client would ever be upset

1215
00:30:14,009 --> 00:30:15,849
or is ever going to give you a

1216
00:30:15,849 --> 00:30:18,220
problem is if their expectations

1217
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:21,259
do not meet reality, right?

1218
00:30:21,369 --> 00:30:23,829
So what do they expect as a result

1219
00:30:23,829 --> 00:30:25,450
of you working with them?

1220
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:26,619
And then what's actually going to

1221
00:30:26,619 --> 00:30:26,779
be

1222
00:30:26,809 --> 00:30:27,500
the reality?

1223
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,079
So if you set the wrong

1224
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:32,680
expectations from day one saying,

1225
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,069
hey, I'm going to get you 20

1226
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:35,589
leads or I'm going to get you 20

1227
00:30:35,589 --> 00:30:36,650
booked appointments.

1228
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:37,980
And then at the end of month one,

1229
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:38,779
you get them for

1230
00:30:39,609 --> 00:30:40,920
that's the only reason they're

1231
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,220
stressed is because they're

1232
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:44,539
they're expecting 20 appointments.

1233
00:30:44,569 --> 00:30:46,279
And the reality is that they got

1234
00:30:46,279 --> 00:30:47,579
four appointments.

1235
00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:49,099
That's the only reason they're

1236
00:30:49,099 --> 00:30:49,420
stressed.

1237
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:49,819
So if you

1238
00:30:49,849 --> 00:30:51,750
can manage expectations

1239
00:30:51,819 --> 00:30:54,410
effectively and be upfront about

1240
00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:56,279
it, and obviously where I'm

1241
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:56,940
getting to with

1242
00:30:56,970 --> 00:31:00,009
this is to under promise and over

1243
00:31:00,009 --> 00:31:02,269
deliver always, you're going to be

1244
00:31:02,339 --> 00:31:03,579
in a really good position.

1245
00:31:03,609 --> 00:31:05,210
And by asking these questions in

1246
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:06,940
your onboarding form, you kind of

1247
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:08,859
know how to position yourself

1248
00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:10,180
because you know what your client

1249
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:11,450
is there for, you know what they

1250
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:13,420
actually want and value

1251
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:14,430
in this relationship.

1252
00:31:14,599 --> 00:31:16,380
So as part of your goals and a lot

1253
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:17,970
of this can happen in the sales

1254
00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:18,539
call too,

1255
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:21,400
because if you don't under promise

1256
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,579
and if you don't set proper

1257
00:31:23,579 --> 00:31:25,829
expectations for what your service

1258
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:26,140
or

1259
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:27,420
what your offer can actually

1260
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:29,390
deliver for them, you're going to

1261
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:31,740
be like shooting yourself in the

1262
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:32,029
foot

1263
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:33,230
from the very beginning.

1264
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,130
So by the time they get to this

1265
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:36,859
section, they shouldn't be like

1266
00:31:36,859 --> 00:31:37,549
guessing like

1267
00:31:37,609 --> 00:31:39,029
what type of results they're

1268
00:31:39,029 --> 00:31:40,789
looking to get from your service,

1269
00:31:40,789 --> 00:31:42,460
they should already have a good

1270
00:31:43,069 --> 00:31:44,759
understanding of what to expect

1271
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:46,890
based on the information you

1272
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:48,910
discussed with them on the sales

1273
00:31:49,049 --> 00:31:51,319
call in leading up to the signing.

1274
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,789
So anyways, it's just a way for us

1275
00:31:52,789 --> 00:31:54,299
to like document on paper

1276
00:31:54,859 --> 00:31:56,910
two different pieces of

1277
00:31:56,910 --> 00:31:57,579
information.

1278
00:31:57,579 --> 00:31:58,940
The first piece of information

1279
00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:00,829
for us is how many sales calls are

1280
00:32:00,829 --> 00:32:02,450
you currently generating each

1281
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:03,660
month on average.

1282
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:05,349
So this is where are you currently

1283
00:32:05,349 --> 00:32:06,539
at in your business?

1284
00:32:06,539 --> 00:32:08,309
So what is point A?

1285
00:32:08,309 --> 00:32:09,420
Basically yeah,

1286
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:11,130
basically this first question is

1287
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:13,339
define point A, right?

1288
00:32:13,339 --> 00:32:14,740
Where are you currently at?

1289
00:32:14,819 --> 00:32:15,180
And then the

1290
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:16,710
second question for us is how many

1291
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:18,089
sales calls are you looking to

1292
00:32:18,089 --> 00:32:19,579
generate from our service each

1293
00:32:19,579 --> 00:32:19,980
month?

1294
00:32:20,009 --> 00:32:21,500
So that's basically where are you

1295
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:22,259
looking to go?

1296
00:32:22,259 --> 00:32:23,470
What is the destination?

1297
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:24,299
What is Z?

1298
00:32:24,329 --> 00:32:26,500
And then you just have to fill in

1299
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,900
the gap of okay, they're at point

1300
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:30,859
A, they want to get to point Z,

1301
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:32,509
my service is the in-between.

1302
00:32:32,509 --> 00:32:34,230
It's what's going to get them from

1303
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:34,920
A to Z, right?

1304
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:35,500
So if they're

1305
00:32:36,099 --> 00:32:37,250
currently getting on five sales

1306
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:39,029
calls every month and they want to

1307
00:32:39,259 --> 00:32:41,900
get to 10, then all I know is my

1308
00:32:42,509 --> 00:32:44,150
service has to fill in another

1309
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:46,490
five calls a month, which I can

1310
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:48,779
reasonably set the expectation to

1311
00:32:48,829 --> 00:32:49,339
deliver on.

1312
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:51,079
So this is why it's so important

1313
00:32:51,079 --> 00:32:52,440
is you're collecting this

1314
00:32:52,589 --> 00:32:53,980
information at the end

1315
00:32:54,009 --> 00:32:55,509
to see what are your goals?

1316
00:32:55,539 --> 00:32:57,089
Like what are their goals for

1317
00:32:57,089 --> 00:32:58,190
working with you?

1318
00:32:58,190 --> 00:32:59,500
And what is it that you

1319
00:32:59,529 --> 00:33:00,480
have to fulfill on?

1320
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,799
Like what is it that you should

1321
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:03,359
shoot for each and every month?

1322
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:04,299
Because it's going

1323
00:33:04,329 --> 00:33:06,230
to be different with every client.

1324
00:33:06,299 --> 00:33:07,809
Obviously they're all there for

1325
00:33:08,059 --> 00:33:09,630
results, but like why and in what

1326
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:10,140
way?

1327
00:33:10,170 --> 00:33:11,410
Because you'll have clients that

1328
00:33:11,410 --> 00:33:12,809
are just like, I want to get on 20

1329
00:33:12,809 --> 00:33:14,059
calls and you'll have another

1330
00:33:14,089 --> 00:33:15,440
client that says, I want to get on

1331
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,769
four calls, but I want them to be

1332
00:33:16,769 --> 00:33:17,880
very qualified, right?

1333
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:18,059
So

1334
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:20,130
clients will care about different

1335
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:20,920
things.

1336
00:33:21,069 --> 00:33:23,329
And it's just important to get as

1337
00:33:23,329 --> 00:33:24,140
much information

1338
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:26,210
and clarity on those things here

1339
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:27,980
in the onboarding form responses,

1340
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:29,099
which is right at the beginning

1341
00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:29,900
of the relationship.

1342
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:31,890
So you know how to adjust or how

1343
00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:34,299
to tailor your service delivery.

1344
00:33:34,299 --> 00:33:34,940
And the last

1345
00:33:35,509 --> 00:33:36,869
question is one of my favorites is

1346
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:38,930
if you could get one thing out of

1347
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:41,380
working with our agency to make it

1348
00:33:41,579 --> 00:33:41,579
a

1349
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:43,490
smashing success for you, what

1350
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:45,009
would that be exactly?

1351
00:33:45,009 --> 00:33:47,019
And you'll find that the answers

1352
00:33:47,019 --> 00:33:47,180
to

1353
00:33:47,210 --> 00:33:49,269
this question are very simple.

1354
00:33:49,269 --> 00:33:50,769
It's just like, I want to have it

1355
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:52,380
so that I don't have to worry

1356
00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:53,650
about lead generation.

1357
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:55,000
I don't want to have to do lead

1358
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:55,809
generation.

1359
00:33:55,809 --> 00:33:57,259
I just want someone to do it for

1360
00:33:57,289 --> 00:33:58,740
me so that I could focus on other

1361
00:33:58,740 --> 00:33:59,890
areas of my business.

1362
00:33:59,890 --> 00:34:01,579
And they're really simple things.

1363
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:04,519
So what you can point to is later

1364
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:07,119
on in the relationship, if they've

1365
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:07,980
increased their

1366
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:09,719
expectations or they're being a

1367
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,820
little bit unreasonable, you could

1368
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:12,860
refer back to this

1369
00:34:12,889 --> 00:34:14,360
question and say, Hey, Jeff, when

1370
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,219
I asked you if you could get one

1371
00:34:16,219 --> 00:34:17,900
thing out of this relationship

1372
00:34:17,929 --> 00:34:20,199
to making a smashing success, you

1373
00:34:20,349 --> 00:34:22,380
told me it would just be the peace

1374
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:24,139
of mind that lead generation is

1375
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:25,820
being handled by someone else.

1376
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:27,019
So you could focus on the

1377
00:34:27,019 --> 00:34:29,019
fulfillment side of your business.

1378
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:31,320
Do you feel that as you know, our

1379
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,940
time together, as we spent X

1380
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:34,300
amount of time together,

1381
00:34:34,329 --> 00:34:35,730
you've been able to focus more

1382
00:34:35,730 --> 00:34:37,360
time on fulfillment while someone

1383
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,179
else has covered lead gen for you?

1384
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:40,619
Yes, of course, Andre.

1385
00:34:40,619 --> 00:34:42,690
Okay, then why are you not happy?

1386
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:43,099
Right?

1387
00:34:43,099 --> 00:34:44,460
Not actually that this

1388
00:34:44,489 --> 00:34:46,139
probably not how the conversation

1389
00:34:46,139 --> 00:34:47,909
would go, but it just helps you to

1390
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:50,059
refer back to something again,

1391
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:51,320
just like a contract.

1392
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,929
It's like you told me that if you

1393
00:34:52,929 --> 00:34:54,400
could get this one thing by

1394
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,579
working with us,

1395
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:57,329
it would be a smashing success,

1396
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,030
not just a success, a smashing

1397
00:34:59,030 --> 00:34:59,820
success.

1398
00:34:59,849 --> 00:35:02,300
So just document this on paper,

1399
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,550
make them think like, what is it

1400
00:35:03,579 --> 00:35:04,699
that they actually want?

1401
00:35:04,699 --> 00:35:05,500
Because

1402
00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:06,409
for our service?

1403
00:35:06,409 --> 00:35:08,050
Yeah, they want calls, but why do

1404
00:35:08,050 --> 00:35:08,949
they want calls?

1405
00:35:08,949 --> 00:35:11,179
Like, what is the actual end goal?

1406
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:12,530
And a lot of the times it's just

1407
00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:14,059
like they want someone to handle

1408
00:35:14,059 --> 00:35:15,239
lead gen so they don't have to

1409
00:35:15,289 --> 00:35:15,800
touch it.

1410
00:35:15,869 --> 00:35:16,989
Like they hate that shit.

1411
00:35:16,989 --> 00:35:18,030
They don't want anything to do

1412
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:19,090
with lead gen.

1413
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:20,840
And even if they could salvage a

1414
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,619
few calls by not having to touch a

1415
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:23,500
single thing,

1416
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:25,139
they're going to be happy.

1417
00:35:25,139 --> 00:35:26,860
And you'll see that typical

1418
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:28,829
response here to this question.

1419
00:35:28,889 --> 00:35:31,079
And again, it just helps you know

1420
00:35:31,079 --> 00:35:32,139
more about your client.

1421
00:35:32,139 --> 00:35:33,179
Like, what are they expecting?

1422
00:35:33,179 --> 00:35:33,420
What are

1423
00:35:33,449 --> 00:35:35,130
they looking to get out of it?

1424
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:36,650
And how can you then use that

1425
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:38,170
information to tailor your

1426
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:38,780
services,

1427
00:35:38,809 --> 00:35:40,519
your fulfillment, and the way you

1428
00:35:40,519 --> 00:35:42,079
interact with your clients on a

1429
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:43,019
day-to-day basis

1430
00:35:43,769 --> 00:35:44,750
with, you know, knowing that

1431
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:45,579
information?

1432
00:35:45,579 --> 00:35:47,800
So these are the last few

1433
00:35:47,849 --> 00:35:49,260
questions we ask in our

1434
00:35:49,289 --> 00:35:49,900
onboarding form.

1435
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:51,900
And again, it's so, so helpful to

1436
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:54,579
collect that information from all

1437
00:35:54,579 --> 00:35:55,179
of our clients,

1438
00:35:55,210 --> 00:35:56,920
because we can really tailor the

1439
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,630
experience they get from working

1440
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:00,300
with us to what it is they're

1441
00:36:00,329 --> 00:36:01,179
looking to get out of it.

1442
00:36:01,179 --> 00:36:03,110
So again, just to recap what my

1443
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:05,260
mentor told me, uh, who was once a

1444
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:05,579
client

1445
00:36:05,610 --> 00:36:07,320
at one of my first agencies was

1446
00:36:07,329 --> 00:36:09,170
the only time clients will ever be

1447
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:11,019
stressed and give you issues

1448
00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:16,539
is when their expectations do not

1449
00:36:16,539 --> 00:36:18,030
meet reality.

1450
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:21,389
Meaning if you promise 10 calls or

1451
00:36:21,389 --> 00:36:22,699
if you promise

1452
00:36:22,730 --> 00:36:24,320
being ranked on the first page of

1453
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,619
Google, or if you promise $10,000

1454
00:36:26,619 --> 00:36:28,590
in added revenue and the reality

1455
00:36:28,809 --> 00:36:30,710
is after the first month working

1456
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:32,750
with you, they're not seeing what

1457
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:33,889
they expected.

1458
00:36:33,889 --> 00:36:34,619
They're going to be

1459
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:35,280
stressed.

1460
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,719
They're going to dispute and

1461
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:38,559
they're going to be shitty

1462
00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:40,530
clients, not because they're

1463
00:36:40,719 --> 00:36:41,019
shitty

1464
00:36:41,050 --> 00:36:42,460
people, but because their

1465
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:44,039
expectations are not met with

1466
00:36:44,039 --> 00:36:44,530
reality.

1467
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:45,900
That's most of the time.

1468
00:36:46,099 --> 00:36:47,590
Obviously there's other scenarios

1469
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:49,820
you'll run into, but really that's

1470
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:51,179
in the simplest form what it

1471
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:51,980
comes down to.

1472
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:53,230
So the onboarding form can

1473
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:54,630
alleviate a lot of that.

1474
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:56,170
And just like the service

1475
00:36:56,170 --> 00:36:56,619
agreement,

1476
00:36:56,650 --> 00:36:58,550
it could catch things before they

1477
00:36:58,619 --> 00:36:59,500
even happen.

1478
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:02,139
So take the time to study this

1479
00:37:02,139 --> 00:37:03,900
video, study our

1480
00:37:04,010 --> 00:37:05,380
onboarding forms, study other

1481
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:06,909
people's onboarding forms that you

1482
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,219
may have already went through by

1483
00:37:08,219 --> 00:37:08,539
working

1484
00:37:08,570 --> 00:37:10,250
with other agencies and come up

1485
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:11,989
with something, come up with an

1486
00:37:11,989 --> 00:37:13,179
onboarding form,

1487
00:37:13,210 --> 00:37:14,139
go.

1488
00:37:14,139 --> 00:37:15,289
And then I would say, once you

1489
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:16,679
come up with your onboarding form,

1490
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:18,139
send it to your accountability

1491
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,369
partner and ask them for feedback,

1492
00:37:20,369 --> 00:37:22,139
ask them to go through it.

1493
00:37:22,139 --> 00:37:23,579
And then also go through it

1494
00:37:23,579 --> 00:37:24,030
yourself

1495
00:37:24,170 --> 00:37:25,420
and time yourself.

1496
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,960
What I found is the onboarding

1497
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,610
form should at least take 10

1498
00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:31,079
minutes at least.

1499
00:37:31,079 --> 00:37:32,130
They should at least be

1500
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:34,070
sitting down for 10 minutes to

1501
00:37:34,139 --> 00:37:35,590
think about their business and

1502
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:37,340
provide you with the information

1503
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:37,469
you

1504
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:39,429
need to know about their business

1505
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:41,449
to have success with your service

1506
00:37:41,449 --> 00:37:42,300
delivery.

1507
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,559
So send it to your accountability

1508
00:37:44,559 --> 00:37:46,360
partner, send it to the group,

1509
00:37:46,409 --> 00:37:48,199
send it to your friends,

1510
00:37:48,409 --> 00:37:50,840
go through it yourself and just

1511
00:37:50,849 --> 00:37:52,699
refine it over time.

1512
00:37:52,699 --> 00:37:55,340
This is again, a livable, edible

1513
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:56,380
document over

1514
00:37:56,409 --> 00:37:56,619
time.

1515
00:37:56,619 --> 00:37:57,710
So just like our service

1516
00:37:57,710 --> 00:37:59,219
agreement, as you learn and go on

1517
00:37:59,219 --> 00:38:01,179
with your agency, you're going to

1518
00:38:01,179 --> 00:38:01,579
add

1519
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:03,400
and edit and change things up

1520
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:03,880
here.

1521
00:38:04,019 --> 00:38:06,719
So like just for example, we never

1522
00:38:06,730 --> 00:38:09,619
used to ask if clients had a list

1523
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:11,400
of prospects for us to start with,

1524
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,900
but we started to see that a lot

1525
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:14,769
of them did and they would just

1526
00:38:14,809 --> 00:38:16,469
never tell us because we never

1527
00:38:16,469 --> 00:38:16,940
ask.

1528
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:17,989
And this is like the dream

1529
00:38:17,989 --> 00:38:18,619
scenarios.

1530
00:38:18,619 --> 00:38:19,980
If, if, if a client has a

1531
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:21,409
list of prospects for us to get

1532
00:38:21,409 --> 00:38:22,719
leads from, that's a dream

1533
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:24,400
scenario that makes our process so

1534
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,019
much more

1535
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:25,420
simple.

1536
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:27,159
And a lot of our clients end up

1537
00:38:27,159 --> 00:38:27,940
having it.

1538
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:29,820
It's just, we never asked.

1539
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:31,179
So they never thought

1540
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:32,059
to tell us.

1541
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:34,070
So we added that question based

1542
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:36,150
off of that learning keywords,

1543
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:37,079
same thing.

1544
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:37,630
We used to only

1545
00:38:37,849 --> 00:38:40,300
search by like industries, right?

1546
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:41,840
And then we had this keyword

1547
00:38:41,929 --> 00:38:43,500
filter that we started using in

1548
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:43,719
our lead

1549
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:45,519
generation process or list

1550
00:38:45,519 --> 00:38:46,780
building process.

1551
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:49,099
And it was super, super effective.

1552
00:38:49,099 --> 00:38:50,219
So we added that

1553
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:52,110
question to our onboarding form

1554
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:52,949
responses.

1555
00:38:52,949 --> 00:38:54,559
We also added the guarantee

1556
00:38:54,559 --> 00:38:56,059
because what we started to see

1557
00:38:56,090 --> 00:38:57,989
was if you had a guarantee, which

1558
00:38:58,059 --> 00:38:59,980
made basically getting on a phone

1559
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:02,500
call, not even buying the services

1560
00:39:02,570 --> 00:39:03,849
or signing on for your services,

1561
00:39:03,849 --> 00:39:05,150
but just getting on a phone call,

1562
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:06,030
which is what we're actually

1563
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:06,699
selling

1564
00:39:06,730 --> 00:39:09,599
a no brainer, then you're going to

1565
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:11,980
have a high success rate.

1566
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:13,500
So we added this question to say,

1567
00:39:13,530 --> 00:39:15,059
Hey, what kind of guarantees you

1568
00:39:15,059 --> 00:39:16,510
have, if any, and even if they

1569
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:17,739
didn't have a guarantee,

1570
00:39:18,289 --> 00:39:20,219
what you'll see is all of our

1571
00:39:20,219 --> 00:39:21,190
clients that don't have

1572
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:22,460
guarantees, they'll say, we don't

1573
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:22,860
offer a

1574
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:23,630
guarantee.

1575
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:25,489
But now that you've mentioned it,

1576
00:39:25,489 --> 00:39:27,099
we'll think of something or we

1577
00:39:27,099 --> 00:39:28,380
don't offer a guarantee,

1578
00:39:28,409 --> 00:39:30,199
but we've never had a client that

1579
00:39:30,199 --> 00:39:31,920
hasn't gotten success with us,

1580
00:39:32,139 --> 00:39:33,019
which is just like,

1581
00:39:33,050 --> 00:39:34,909
we get useful information out of

1582
00:39:34,909 --> 00:39:36,530
this question regardless.

1583
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:37,980
And it's just so cool to see.

1584
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:38,219
So

1585
00:39:38,809 --> 00:39:41,670
don't worry too much about having

1586
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:44,219
this perfect right off the bat.

1587
00:39:44,219 --> 00:39:45,230
It's just going to be a learning

1588
00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:45,969
process.

1589
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:47,219
Like with anything else in your

1590
00:39:47,219 --> 00:39:48,539
agency, it's like all this stuff

1591
00:39:48,539 --> 00:39:50,380
you're learning, you're

1592
00:39:50,409 --> 00:39:51,869
going to have to implement it to

1593
00:39:51,869 --> 00:39:53,480
continue to get the most value out

1594
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:53,829
of it.

1595
00:39:53,829 --> 00:39:55,489
Because I can't tell you

1596
00:39:55,530 --> 00:39:57,179
how your agency should be run or

1597
00:39:57,179 --> 00:39:58,949
what your agency business is going

1598
00:39:59,079 --> 00:39:59,929
to look like.

1599
00:39:59,929 --> 00:40:00,699
Every agency is

1600
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:02,260
different, but what I can do is

1601
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:04,030
teach you the fundamentals and the

1602
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:05,980
strategies and the frameworks

1603
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:07,380
that will at least get you started

1604
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:08,619
and get you off the ground.

1605
00:40:08,619 --> 00:40:09,659
And then from there,

1606
00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:11,480
it's up to you to be an agency

1607
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,809
owner, to be a leader, to be an

1608
00:40:12,809 --> 00:40:14,460
entrepreneur, to be a builder

1609
00:40:15,050 --> 00:40:16,349
and flesh it out from there.

1610
00:40:16,349 --> 00:40:17,739
So if you have any questions on

1611
00:40:17,739 --> 00:40:20,349
this video and on putting together

1612
00:40:20,409 --> 00:40:22,059
or choosing which questions to ask

1613
00:40:22,059 --> 00:40:23,269
and your onboarding form

1614
00:40:23,269 --> 00:40:25,420
responses, let me know.

1615
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:25,900
But again,

1616
00:40:25,929 --> 00:40:27,519
really your action item and your

1617
00:40:27,519 --> 00:40:29,329
homework after watching this video

1618
00:40:29,329 --> 00:40:30,940
is to put together an onboarding

1619
00:40:30,969 --> 00:40:32,550
form and then send it to your

1620
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:34,530
accountability partner and also go

1621
00:40:34,699 --> 00:40:37,389
through it yourself a few times

1622
00:40:37,449 --> 00:40:38,889
and see, are there any questions

1623
00:40:38,889 --> 00:40:39,719
that I should add?

1624
00:40:39,869 --> 00:40:40,929
Are there any questions I should

1625
00:40:41,179 --> 00:40:41,900
get rid of?

1626
00:40:41,929 --> 00:40:44,199
Did I explain the questions clear

1627
00:40:44,349 --> 00:40:44,679
enough?

1628
00:40:44,679 --> 00:40:45,460
And you'll get a lot of that

1629
00:40:45,659 --> 00:40:47,099
feedback just by sending it to

1630
00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:48,010
other people.

1631
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:49,400
So let me know how it goes.

1632
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:50,920
Super excited for you to go

1633
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,219
through this process.

1634
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:53,719
And yeah, in the next video, we're

1635
00:40:53,719 --> 00:40:55,019
just going to continue walking

1636
00:40:55,019 --> 00:40:57,170
through some of the more important

1637
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:59,269
aspects of the onboarding process

1638
00:40:59,269 --> 00:41:01,130
that we kind of foreshadowed or

1639
00:41:01,130 --> 00:41:02,510
talked a little bit about

1640
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:04,599
in the previous video.

1641
00:41:04,599 --> 00:41:06,349
But I definitely want to go into

1642
00:41:06,349 --> 00:41:08,059
more detail on just like we did

1643
00:41:08,059 --> 00:41:08,380
here with

1644
00:41:08,409 --> 00:41:09,880
the onboarding form responses.

1645
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,159
So yeah, catch you in the next

1646
00:41:11,159 --> 00:41:11,659
video.

1647
00:41:11,659 --> 00:41:12,940
Thanks so much for taking the time

1648
00:41:12,969 --> 00:41:13,739
to watch this.
