00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:49,880
that

23
00:00:49,939 --> 00:00:51,619

24
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:53,490
foundations so even if it were for

25
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:55,159
you to do it or someone that you

26
00:00:55,219 --> 00:00:56,560
wanted to go out and hire you

27
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,299
actually know the strategies and

28
00:00:58,299 --> 00:01:00,259
the foundations to teach them so

29
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:02,649
let me open up the screen share

30
00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:05,200
and we'll dive in and feel free to

31
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:09,219
use like the the chat um to post

32
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,560
questions and stuff like that

33
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,930
because i'm happy to open up the

34
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:13,159
conversation rather than just

35
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:13,780
ripping

36
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,920
right through this like uh like

37
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,230
yeah like a keynote but anyways uh

38
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:20,180
so yeah effectively communicate

39
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:20,780
with

40
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,200
the clients i think this is a huge

41
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,019
topic of discussion because a lot

42
00:01:24,019 --> 00:01:25,879
of us put a lot of focus

43
00:01:25,939 --> 00:01:27,810
and emphasis on the actual service

44
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:29,579
we deliver and making that really

45
00:01:29,629 --> 00:01:31,489
really fucking good uh with

46
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,430
like roi and and actual results

47
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:35,250
which is great um but sometimes

48
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:36,719
that takes away from the

49
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:37,239
communication

50
00:01:37,299 --> 00:01:38,939
aspect which is sometimes even

51
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:40,540
more important uh and valued by

52
00:01:40,659 --> 00:01:42,299
our clients than the results

53
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:43,920
uh and you can leverage this is a

54
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,230
really powerful thing to

55
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,170
understand because you can

56
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:49,109
buy yourself a lot of time with

57
00:01:49,659 --> 00:01:51,069
clients um to get the results that

58
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:53,459
you originally promised so

59
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:54,900
we'll dive right in the first

60
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,579
thing to understand is the golden

61
00:01:56,579 --> 00:01:58,329
rule of retention at least the way

62
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:58,560
i

63
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,209
understand it is it's not so much

64
00:02:00,209 --> 00:02:01,640
about what you do it's more so

65
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:03,120
about how you make them feel

66
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,689
uh and when i heard this for the

67
00:02:04,689 --> 00:02:06,390
first time it really clicked for

68
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,538
me again it takes the focus away

69
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:10,430
from it's not just about getting

70
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,240
results but it's more so how you

71
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,879
about how you make them feel

72
00:02:13,939 --> 00:02:15,490
as a service provider because

73
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:17,189
you're providing a service it's

74
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,500
not a specific deliverable that

75
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,460
they're there for necessarily it's

76
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:23,039
the service and the experience

77
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:24,680
that you deliver through that

78
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:26,240
service which we'll talk a little

79
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,699
bit about the different ways to

80
00:02:27,699 --> 00:02:28,569
cultivate that experience

81
00:02:29,139 --> 00:02:30,639
so that's the golden rule if you

82
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:32,319
remember anything from this call

83
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:32,930
remember that

84
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,740
and just you know write it down

85
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:36,370
and think on it for a little bit

86
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:38,060
just to fully understand what we

87
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:38,159
mean

88
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,419
there um just the basics preferred

89
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,069
tools for us at least at our

90
00:02:42,069 --> 00:02:44,039
agency for communication with

91
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:44,340
clients

92
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,669
is slack uh for written

93
00:02:45,669 --> 00:02:47,629
communication just like what you

94
00:02:47,629 --> 00:02:49,509
do through email or text message

95
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:50,319
and then zoom

96
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:52,479
for video conferencing you can use

97
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,490
whatever you like here um but i do

98
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,120
think it is important to

99
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:58,240
understand the difference between

100
00:02:58,729 --> 00:03:00,240
written communication and video or

101
00:03:00,629 --> 00:03:02,319
live communication similar to like

102
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:02,840
we're on a call

103
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,669
now and having systems to

104
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:06,689
implement both and understanding

105
00:03:07,469 --> 00:03:09,259
the ups and downs of implementing

106
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:11,810
both right so that's pretty clear

107
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:13,659
on the preferred tools so we'll

108
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,599
start with written communication

109
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:16,479
uh and

110
00:03:16,659 --> 00:03:18,080
when and where to use it and just

111
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,750
different ideas and examples um so

112
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,180
the the number one thing with

113
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,150
written communication uh is to

114
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,960
keep it short and sweet i see a

115
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,280
lot of agency owners trying to be

116
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,159
like very very professional with

117
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:31,080
their punctuation and the capital

118
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,479
letters and writing it as if it's

119
00:03:33,539 --> 00:03:35,060
like a college essay um but what

120
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:36,900
clients really appreciate is quick

121
00:03:36,909 --> 00:03:38,389
consumption of the point you're

122
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:40,060
trying to get across um and the

123
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:41,879
other thing to understand is not

124
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:43,979
to be afraid to repeat yourself so

125
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:45,659
uh at knowledge yet you're sorry

126
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:47,469
at client ascension specifically

127
00:03:47,469 --> 00:03:49,879
we recently hired uh closers.io

128
00:03:49,939 --> 00:03:51,560
which a lot of you guys know is

129
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,699
like cole gordon's company is like

130
00:03:53,699 --> 00:03:55,300
a fifteen thousand dollar

131
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:55,780
investment

132
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,409
to work with these guys and so

133
00:03:57,409 --> 00:03:59,099
they're a really good example to

134
00:03:59,219 --> 00:04:01,139
learn like how do they manage a

135
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,819
client that pays them fifteen

136
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:04,689
thousand dollars and so i brought

137
00:04:04,689 --> 00:04:06,219
you guys three examples of

138
00:04:06,419 --> 00:04:06,539
check-in

139
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:08,180
messages that we received from

140
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,819
their team and this is a perfect

141
00:04:09,819 --> 00:04:11,500
example of effective written

142
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,139
communication keeping it short and

143
00:04:14,139 --> 00:04:16,509
sweet so literally you see three

144
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:18,600
instances of check-in messages

145
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,720
from steve who's on their team

146
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:22,720
saying yo guys how is it over here

147
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,980
yo dude happy labor day anything

148
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,980
i can help with yo guys how's biz

149
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:28,829
like that's it and this is super

150
00:04:29,689 --> 00:04:30,589
effective because they're

151
00:04:30,699 --> 00:04:32,970
questions that elicit a response

152
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:34,939
from the client uh and so me as

153
00:04:34,939 --> 00:04:37,379
the client will naturally go in

154
00:04:37,379 --> 00:04:37,420
and

155
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:39,529
fill them in on everything that's

156
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:41,420
going on with the business and if

157
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:42,480
you're a business owner

158
00:04:42,899 --> 00:04:44,810
your business is super important

159
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:46,540
to you so you you're naturally

160
00:04:46,569 --> 00:04:48,490
inclined to share the positives

161
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,319
and the wins so really the the

162
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:51,850
layer underneath here to

163
00:04:51,949 --> 00:04:53,439
understand is like just asking

164
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:54,439
general

165
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,649
questions about how the business

166
00:04:56,649 --> 00:04:58,699
is is almost always going to get

167
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:00,439
you uh an idea or some insights

168
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:00,660
into

169
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,939
the wins that they're experiencing

170
00:05:01,939 --> 00:05:03,959
right or at least where they're at

171
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:05,899
with the business so you can get

172
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:07,399
them closer to experiencing those

173
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:08,689
wins or those results that you

174
00:05:08,689 --> 00:05:11,000
originally promised uh so don't be

175
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:11,399
afraid to

176
00:05:11,459 --> 00:05:12,470
repeat yourself if you look at

177
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:13,689
these messages they're actually

178
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:15,350
kind of out of order um but

179
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:17,639
basically it's it was monday on

180
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:19,519
september 5th tuesday on september

181
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:21,339
13th so like eight days later and

182
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:22,860
then tuesday again on september

183
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:23,250
20th

184
00:05:23,379 --> 00:05:25,230
so every single week i'm getting a

185
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:27,209
really simple dumbed down check-in

186
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,220
message from the guy in this team

187
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:30,810
consistently i know it's coming

188
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:32,569
every single week and throughout

189
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,430
the week i'm thinking of things

190
00:05:34,589 --> 00:05:34,779
now

191
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:35,850
because i know steve is going to

192
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:36,970
check in with me at the beginning

sweet

202
00:05:49,899 --> 00:05:52,220
these are really general

203
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,660
open-ended easy questions to ask

204
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,949
your clients right how's it over

205
00:05:57,279 --> 00:05:57,279
there

206
00:05:57,339 --> 00:05:59,439
anything i can help with this week

207
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:01,509
how's business simple right any

208
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:03,699
questions so far uh before i go

209
00:06:03,939 --> 00:06:03,939
into

210
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,209
some more examples feel free to

211
00:06:06,579 --> 00:06:08,279
throw them in the chat if it's

212
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:09,459
easier that way

213
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:13,350
okay cool all right so a few other

214
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:19,149
examples of written communication

215
00:06:19,149 --> 00:06:22,129
is uh holding them accountable

216
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:24,660
um so a lot of service providers

217
00:06:24,779 --> 00:06:27,379
have you know obviously a scope of

218
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:30,379
work or a division of work

219
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:32,360
between what the service provider

220
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,230
is responsible for doing and then

221
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:36,379
what the the client is responsible

222
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:38,350
for doing and an easy way uh or an

223
00:06:39,019 --> 00:06:40,079
effective way to use written

224
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:42,139
communication is to hold your

225
00:06:42,139 --> 00:06:42,459
clients

226
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:44,889
accountable another example from

227
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,399
our work with the team at

228
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:48,860
closers.io they have our training

229
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:49,569
program

230
00:06:49,779 --> 00:06:50,949
very similar to how client

231
00:06:50,949 --> 00:06:52,519
ascension has a training program

232
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:53,839
and so they'll constantly remind

233
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:54,779
us about

234
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:56,550
specific lessons based on the

235
00:06:57,329 --> 00:06:58,459
information and the insights we

236
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:00,360
share about how our business is

237
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:00,620
doing

238
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,399
at that point um and they'll share

239
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:04,160
specific and relevant trainings

240
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,759
with us to go through because they

241
00:07:05,899 --> 00:07:07,399
know that if we were to watch the

242
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:09,149
trainings we'll probably be closer

243
00:07:09,259 --> 00:07:10,709
to the results that they initially

244
00:07:10,779 --> 00:07:12,360
promised so holding clients

245
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,029
accountable to go through the

246
00:07:14,139 --> 00:07:16,060
action items or at least their

247
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:16,720
side of the

248
00:07:16,779 --> 00:07:18,470
board when it comes to scope of

249
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:20,379
work and responsibilities is is

250
00:07:20,379 --> 00:07:21,720
really key so again a

251
00:07:21,779 --> 00:07:23,160
really simple message like have

252
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,490
you guys gone through this and

253
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:25,660
then he links the kajabi link

254
00:07:25,939 --> 00:07:27,569
and then ends it with it'll change

255
00:07:27,569 --> 00:07:29,139
your life to be honest like that

256
00:07:29,139 --> 00:07:31,100
keeps you like interested oh let

257
00:07:31,209 --> 00:07:31,500
me let

258
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,279
me check this out what does he

259
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:35,069
mean by that um and so hyping it

260
00:07:35,069 --> 00:07:37,339
up as well it's super important so

261
00:07:37,339 --> 00:07:37,439
if

262
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,100
you have clients that need to do

263
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,790
specific things like filling out

264
00:07:40,899 --> 00:07:43,870
an onboarding form um or going

265
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:43,899
through

266
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,420
training like we have in client

267
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:46,720
ascension right that's that's

268
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:48,050
obviously a big part of your guys

269
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,980
responsibilities is to go through

270
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,649
the training um a message is like

271
00:07:51,649 --> 00:07:53,160
this work really effective

272
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,370
the next one to cover is

273
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,639
celebration of wins um and this is

274
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:01,899
one of the the key takeaways that

275
00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:02,529
i'll recap

276
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,980
at the end but celebrating wins is

277
00:08:05,149 --> 00:08:07,509
so freaking important um because a

278
00:08:07,769 --> 00:08:09,649
lot of times what happens is

279
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:10,120
clients

280
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,750
are winning um but you just don't

281
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,389
know about it because you're not

282
00:08:13,389 --> 00:08:15,079
asking the question and because

283
00:08:15,139 --> 00:08:17,509
because the communication is not

284
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,750
there so what we like to do at our

285
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:21,860
agency is to straight up ask our

286
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:23,600
clients on a regular basis if

287
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,310
there are any wins to celebrate

288
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:27,019
and we do this not only through

289
00:08:27,329 --> 00:08:27,620
slack but

290
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,240
also like when we hop on a call

291
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,879
with a client uh every every so

292
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,779
often we'll start to call like hey

293
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:34,418
yeah like how's everything been

294
00:08:34,418 --> 00:08:36,019
going with the business any wins

295
00:08:36,019 --> 00:08:37,720
to share and so always be asking

296
00:08:37,779 --> 00:08:39,408
clients if they have any wins to

297
00:08:39,408 --> 00:08:40,970
share and we do this also with

298
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:42,820
client ascension right in the wins

299
00:08:42,918 --> 00:08:44,470
channel if we didn't have a wins

300
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:46,100
channel in client ascension we

301
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,009
wouldn't be seeing all the success

302
00:08:48,179 --> 00:08:48,220
that

303
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:49,769
our students are having or not as

304
00:08:49,769 --> 00:08:51,190
much as we would because of the

305
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,159
fact we have a wins channel

306
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,330
right we're always always

307
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:56,500
eliciting students and clients to

308
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:58,820
share their wins because it makes

309
00:08:58,820 --> 00:08:59,059
them feel

310
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:01,009
better and it actually allows them

311
00:09:01,009 --> 00:09:02,549
to see the progress that they're

312
00:09:02,549 --> 00:09:03,720
making because a lot of

313
00:09:03,779 --> 00:09:05,220
us just get caught up with the

314
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,840
day-to-day and we don't really

315
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,539
take a step back to zoom out and

316
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:08,779
see

317
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,240
how far we've gone right with the

318
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,720
business and everything else so

319
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,750
here's a great example actually

320
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,070
of that hey any wins and he like

321
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:16,960
basically was typing again as he

322
00:09:17,019 --> 00:09:18,879
was thinking nah i haven't signed

323
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,159
up a

324
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:20,509
client in a few weeks been able to

325
00:09:20,509 --> 00:09:21,759
build out a team now i can focus

326
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:23,009
more actually i wasn't counting

327
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,629
this but it's definitely a win one

328
00:09:24,629 --> 00:09:26,009
company went from four links a

329
00:09:26,009 --> 00:09:27,990
month to 14 links so he basically

330
00:09:28,059 --> 00:09:29,559
upsold the client and he wasn't

331
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:30,870
thinking about it until we

332
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:32,779
actually straight up asked him any

333
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:33,039
wins

334
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,720
to celebrate which is so important

335
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,220
because we wouldn't have heard

336
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,600
about this and we wouldn't

337
00:09:37,659 --> 00:09:39,220
have been able to celebrate these

338
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:40,539
things with the client if we

339
00:09:40,539 --> 00:09:42,909
didn't simply ask another one

340
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:43,600
right

341
00:09:43,659 --> 00:09:46,090
here this is a great example this

342
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,299
is like a pretty more complex

343
00:09:48,919 --> 00:09:50,600
detailed example but i'll just

344
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:50,980
talk you

345
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:52,100
guys through it real quick so

346
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,379
basically what happened here is

347
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:55,620
someone from my team sent a kpi

348
00:09:55,669 --> 00:09:56,320
update at the

349
00:09:56,379 --> 00:09:58,379
end of the week reporting specific

350
00:09:58,379 --> 00:10:00,440
stats um congratulating them on on

351
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,679
hitting a specific

352
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,779
kpi all that great stuff um the

353
00:10:04,289 --> 00:10:05,620
client then said they're happy

354
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,919
with the rate we're seeing

355
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:08,090
meetings

356
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:09,990
getting booked obviously not

357
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:11,460
netting is a hit not everything

358
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:12,450
netting is a hit but the

359
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:13,429
conversion rate

360
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,929
isn't bad so in this scenario

361
00:10:14,929 --> 00:10:16,730
we're basically pointing out a win

362
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:19,039
for the client because we we see

363
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:19,200
it

364
00:10:19,259 --> 00:10:20,889
ourselves um and the the client is

365
00:10:20,889 --> 00:10:22,509
saying they're happy but they're

366
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,480
also kind of downplaying it a

367
00:10:24,529 --> 00:10:24,980
little bit by

368
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:26,710
saying the conversion rate isn't

369
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:28,289
bad and so i come back in here and

370
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,019
say wow huge improvements being

371
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,409
made here five out of seven calls

372
00:10:32,659 --> 00:10:34,750
booked is way ahead of our kpi of

373
00:10:34,899 --> 00:10:36,440
50 percent lots to celebrate

374
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,379
here as a team especially

375
00:10:38,379 --> 00:10:40,200
considering where we were a few

376
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,179
weeks ago right and then i kind of

377
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:42,740
highlight

378
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:44,259
how we had weeks with one out of

379
00:10:44,259 --> 00:10:45,710
six conversion and two out of

380
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,570
eight conversions um and then just

381
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:50,379
basically setting them up for uh

382
00:10:50,379 --> 00:10:51,980
to look forward to next week i

383
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,940
hope everyone has a great weekend

384
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,580
let's continue the success next

385
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:56,840
week um so there's a lot of

386
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,480
different elements that go into

387
00:10:58,620 --> 00:10:59,299
this specific

388
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,620
example um but the biggest piece

389
00:11:01,789 --> 00:11:03,419
of it is is uh celebrating the

390
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:05,690
wins and also showing them where

391
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:07,179
they're at compared to where they

392
00:11:07,179 --> 00:11:08,559
were when they started uh which

393
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:09,820
we'll go into a little bit more

394
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,149
that's a lot easier to do through

395
00:11:12,149 --> 00:11:14,139
uh live communication on like a

396
00:11:14,539 --> 00:11:15,919
zoom call which we'll talk

397
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,370
about in a second here one last

398
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:21,090
example uh is this one here simple

399
00:11:21,269 --> 00:11:23,620
check-in message from daniel on

400
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:23,700
our

401
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:25,330
team saying how's your week been

402
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:26,909
uh just giving them a little bit

403
00:11:26,909 --> 00:11:28,500
of an update on where we're at

404
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:28,610
with

405
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,149
everything um and again the client

406
00:11:30,149 --> 00:11:31,590
saying hey there's been a few more

407
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:32,980
positive responses and i was

408
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:34,230
able to book a call so there has

409
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:35,659
been improvement thanks for your

410
00:11:35,659 --> 00:11:36,830
help right so again celebrating

411
00:11:37,379 --> 00:11:37,379
these

412
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,570
wins eliciting them uh our clients

413
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:41,320
to report these wins to us is so

414
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,379
so important and it's really

415
00:11:43,379 --> 00:11:43,769
simple

416
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,590
you just ask how's your week been

417
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:49,389
any wins to share any positives to

418
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:52,179
know however you want to frame it

419
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,379
right any questions this is all

420
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,299
pretty simple to be honest but

421
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,289
it's really important so any

422
00:11:59,730 --> 00:11:59,779
questions

423
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,809
uh on how this might apply to what

424
00:12:01,809 --> 00:12:02,980
you're working on

425
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:10,820
nothing yet okay dope

426
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:14,669
doing this at scale simple answer

427
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:17,909
is the higher team um client

428
00:12:17,909 --> 00:12:20,169
success managers a lot of it as

429
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:20,590
well uh

430
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,629
is uh it can be automated that's

431
00:12:23,629 --> 00:12:25,440
why i really like slack uh because

432
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,419
i could go through every

433
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,370
single client channel and schedule

434
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:30,049
a message like these ones like i

435
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:31,779
can almost guarantee these are

436
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,620
scheduled send like yo guys how's

437
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,320
it over here copy and paste that

438
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,299
in every single client channel and

439
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,750
schedule to send on monday at 8 30

440
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,669
a.m if that's when you want to

441
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:43,299
send it all right so slack has a

442
00:12:43,299 --> 00:12:43,460
lot

443
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,110
of great features to do things

444
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:46,740
like this at scale um and i also

445
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:49,850
think it's important to uh

446
00:12:50,419 --> 00:12:50,570
automate a lot

447
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,090
of the written communication as

448
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:53,529
much as possible so that you can

449
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:55,460
make more time to do the verbal

450
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:56,830
live zoom communication which

451
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:58,070
we'll get into in a little bit

452
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:00,330
here um but a lot of it is not

453
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:00,559
really

454
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:03,139
um scalable in a sense the way you

455
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:05,679
scale is through people which is

456
00:13:05,909 --> 00:13:07,620
why we have trina now in our

457
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:09,879
community and it's why we have uh

458
00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:12,059
at our agency we have daniel uh

459
00:13:12,289 --> 00:13:14,580
and another client success manager

460
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,049
stephanie uh that are like

461
00:13:16,049 --> 00:13:17,840
full-time hires at our agency to

462
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,620
manage a select group of clients

463
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:19,940
to do

464
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,559
these specific things for does

465
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:28,580
that help or cool and and brooke

466
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:31,610
asked if we use zaps i for the

467
00:13:31,659 --> 00:13:31,820
things

468
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:33,820
you're seeing here so far we don't

469
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,500
in slack it's really easy you

470
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,460
could just type a message and then

471
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,230
schedule it to send at a specific

472
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:41,309
day and time so it's it's all

473
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,240
right within slack at least for

474
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:44,500
like

475
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:46,360
the schedule send messages can you

476
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:49,289
do recurring ones as well um i'm

477
00:13:49,379 --> 00:13:52,389
not 100 sure but i honestly

478
00:13:52,809 --> 00:13:52,980
wouldn't

479
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:55,009
recommend it um because if you

480
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:56,919
continue to frame the same exact

481
00:13:57,659 --> 00:13:59,759
message it could what happens is

482
00:13:59,940 --> 00:13:59,940
the

483
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,480
client gets accustomed to it and

484
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,960
they start to ignore it because

485
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,419
they know it's automated and

486
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:05,039
there's not much

487
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,029
effort so like the the slightest

488
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,000
difference is like happy labor day

489
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,679
like obviously you don't want to

490
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:12,120
send that every single week

491
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,730
because it's not labor day every

492
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,379
week so the smallest things like

493
00:14:15,539 --> 00:14:15,779
that go

494
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,460
a long way they really do um and

495
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:19,080
obviously like these are all

496
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:20,879
asking the same thing but in

497
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:21,379
slightly

498
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,399
different phrases something to

499
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:27,720
think about um and and or you ask

500
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,860
like if we check in every

501
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:30,580
wednesday

502
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:32,049
and do a report every friday so

503
00:14:32,049 --> 00:14:33,710
the framework we use at our agency

504
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:35,220
is every single friday we'll do

505
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,240
a kpi report uh which i'll walk

506
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,110
you through that'll be the last

507
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:40,840
piece here in the ring

508
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:41,610
communication so

509
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:43,649
every single friday we report kpis

510
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:45,320
and then we like to check in uh

511
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:48,009
usually anytime between monday uh

512
00:14:48,259 --> 00:14:48,259
and

513
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,580
wednesday ideally monday tuesday

514
00:14:50,899 --> 00:14:52,340
earliest in the week to do a

515
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:54,340
check-in like the one you're

516
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:54,669
seeing here

517
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,090
how's it over there how's business

518
00:14:57,649 --> 00:14:58,899
anything i can help with that's

519
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:00,340
usually a good way to start

520
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,940
the week you can drop nuggets like

521
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:03,600
this throughout the week like this

522
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,059
was just kind of randomly on a

523
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,289
friday um but the actual kpi

524
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,909
messages we like to do on fridays

525
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:12,169
uh so that leads me to my next

526
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:12,950
point uh

527
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,720
which is reporting kpis so again

528
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,190
it's more so about how you make

529
00:15:18,389 --> 00:15:20,500
them feel not all about the

530
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:20,950
results you

531
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,600
get in in what you actually do but

532
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,919
it's still important to get

533
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:25,379
results right because at the

534
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,899
end of the day we're all business

535
00:15:26,899 --> 00:15:28,350
owners and we want to make smart

536
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:30,259
investments in our business that

537
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,730
give us potentially generate an

538
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:33,080
roi so just because someone's

539
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,220
delivering a really nice service

540
00:15:34,899 --> 00:15:35,620
and there

541
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:37,429
is a cool experience and there's

542
00:15:37,429 --> 00:15:38,919
they're really nice to us if

543
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:40,580
they're not actually reporting

544
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:41,220
kpis and

545
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,269
getting results and doing the work

546
00:15:43,269 --> 00:15:45,110
we're gonna fire them right so you

547
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,299
still need to report kpis or you

548
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,759
should be reporting kpis um and i

549
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:52,139
think the most important thing

550
00:15:52,179 --> 00:15:54,340
that gets missed here is

551
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:54,980
collecting

552
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:57,080
relevant metrics in the onboarding

553
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,840
form and all this is saying is if

554
00:15:58,909 --> 00:16:00,340
you can get a really good

555
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,340
understanding for where they're at

556
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:03,940
currently before they start

557
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:05,700
working with you that gives you

558
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:05,950
all the

559
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,659
leverage to report kpis because

560
00:16:07,659 --> 00:16:09,169
even if you have the slightest

561
00:16:09,169 --> 00:16:10,929
improvements you just compare them

562
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:11,120
to

563
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,730
where they're at now compared to

564
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:14,379
where they started with you right

565
00:16:14,379 --> 00:16:16,899
so like this message here uh was

566
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,519
actually that kpi message you saw

567
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:19,889
on the other example uh where

568
00:16:19,899 --> 00:16:21,539
we're just checking in with the

569
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,070
client hey reporting to you with

570
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:24,669
campaign stats from this week the

571
00:16:24,669 --> 00:16:26,100
way we do it at our agency again

572
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:26,340
for

573
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,529
some background we run an email

574
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:30,450
lead generation agency so the

575
00:16:31,019 --> 00:16:32,500
things that we specifically want

576
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:32,659
to

577
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,340
point out are how many positive

578
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:35,769
replies we got out of those

579
00:16:35,769 --> 00:16:37,529
positive replies how many turn

580
00:16:37,539 --> 00:16:38,019
into calls

581
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,659
booked and then we just do a

582
00:16:39,659 --> 00:16:41,440
percentage of how many of the

583
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:43,379
calls booked or how many of the

584
00:16:43,379 --> 00:16:43,639
positive

585
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,200
replies turn into call booked

586
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,940
which is 71 and then we'll even

587
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,500
put like a kpi right there so they

588
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:48,799
can see

589
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,870
the difference like oh wow we got

590
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:53,019
71 when 50 is the goal like we

591
00:16:53,409 --> 00:16:55,940
overachieved this week added value

592
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:56,179
to the

593
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,559
pipeline we come up with this

594
00:16:57,559 --> 00:16:59,000
number based on the first year

595
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,299
contract value that they provide

596
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:01,539
to us in

597
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,100
their onboarding form and then

598
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,720
expected revenue and and then we

599
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,180
just set the expectation that

600
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,559
these stats are estimated based on

601
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:08,700
what we're seeing and please

602
00:17:08,818 --> 00:17:09,779
correct us if there's any

603
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:10,740
inaccuracies

604
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:11,930
so a lot of shits happening

605
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:13,410
throughout the week especially

606
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:14,598
with a cold email lead generation

607
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:15,380
agency

608
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,318
and so it's important for you to

609
00:17:17,318 --> 00:17:19,328
list out the highlights that they

610
00:17:20,059 --> 00:17:21,619
might not be seeing or fully

611
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,789
understanding a lot of people in

612
00:17:24,259 --> 00:17:25,559
business are very visual and

613
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:27,519
numbers oriented so if you can

614
00:17:27,578 --> 00:17:28,019
show them the

615
00:17:28,078 --> 00:17:29,539
numbers or the results of what

616
00:17:29,539 --> 00:17:30,990
you've produced or worked on

617
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,670
throughout the week in a format

618
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:34,019
similar

619
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:36,180
to this it goes a long way and so

620
00:17:36,529 --> 00:17:38,619
here's an example of like us doing

621
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:41,130
really well getting above 50%

622
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:43,380
conversions and celebrating and

623
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:45,140
pointing out that to the client

624
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,980
like congratulating them right

625
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:47,859
love that

626
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,940
we've been seeing this recently

627
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,799
two weeks ago we were at you know

628
00:17:51,799 --> 00:17:55,049
3600 and now we're at 18 000 great

629
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:55,380
things

630
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,710
being done here so we're over

631
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:58,009
celebrating we're letting the

632
00:17:58,019 --> 00:17:59,230
client know that this is good

633
00:17:59,230 --> 00:17:59,500
because

634
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:00,650
a lot of times clients don't

635
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:02,920
really know is this good could we

636
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,529
be doing better stuff like that

637
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:04,900
right

638
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,950
here's an example on the flip side

639
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:09,410
of reporting kpis that are not so

640
00:18:09,579 --> 00:18:11,140
good right so we're reporting

641
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:11,940
these kpis

642
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,950
three positive replies but zero

643
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:15,789
calls book so zero percent calls

644
00:18:16,259 --> 00:18:17,750
book conversion rate where the

645
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:17,940
goal

646
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,710
is 50 percent right and so the

647
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:21,480
message is a little bit different

648
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,839
here not a lot of activity which

649
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:23,460
gives

650
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:25,109
you the opportunity to follow up

651
00:18:25,109 --> 00:18:26,759
on older prospects um also this is

652
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,569
a great time to get on an inbox

653
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,220
management session to see how we

654
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:31,859
can convert older prospects and

655
00:18:31,859 --> 00:18:33,690
the book calls so we're suggesting

656
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:34,019
next

657
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:36,150
steps because there's not a win to

658
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:37,880
celebrate here we're recommending

659
00:18:38,619 --> 00:18:40,420
or suggesting the best next step

660
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,559
uh which in our agency is to

661
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,430
schedule an inbox management

662
00:18:45,259 --> 00:18:46,970
session so we could go in and help

663
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:48,720
them convert more of these

664
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,839
positive replies in the calls book

665
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:53,059
and so that's the way we report

666
00:18:53,059 --> 00:18:53,759
kpis at our

667
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,089
agency you guys can use a similar

668
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,710
framework but the important

669
00:18:58,539 --> 00:19:01,220
takeaways for anyone here is to

670
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:01,750
understand where

671
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:03,210
your client is at when they're

672
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:04,710
first starting to work with you

673
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:05,720
which is really done simply

674
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:06,420
through

675
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,900
collecting relevant metrics in the

676
00:19:09,059 --> 00:19:11,039
onboarding form and then using

677
00:19:11,099 --> 00:19:13,059
these kpi updates to show them the

678
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:14,269
numbers and how they've

679
00:19:14,269 --> 00:19:16,049
transformed or improved since you

680
00:19:16,049 --> 00:19:17,819
started working together and what

681
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:18,660
the value

682
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,549
of that is to their business with

683
00:19:20,549 --> 00:19:22,359
things like expected revenue or

684
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:23,839
added value to pipeline

685
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:29,069
uh connor great question so connor

686
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:30,859
asks if we tend to avoid the why

687
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:32,359
to underperforming in these

688
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:32,819
messages

689
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,539
i do uh with written messages i

690
00:19:35,539 --> 00:19:38,710
don't like to explain too deeply

691
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:40,660
uh through a written message

692
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:41,140
because i

693
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,420
think it can confuse process or

694
00:19:43,779 --> 00:19:45,970
confuse clients and the tone often

695
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:48,180
gets misunderstood which is why

696
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:48,500
the call

697
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:49,849
to action anytime we're

698
00:19:49,849 --> 00:19:51,809
underperforming or have to explain

699
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:54,329
performance to a client is to get

700
00:19:54,339 --> 00:19:54,900
on a call

701
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,029
because it calls the easiest way

702
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,839
or the better way to explain the

703
00:19:58,849 --> 00:20:00,660
why behind what they're seeing

704
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:01,380
here

705
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,799
otherwise you could send it and

706
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:04,440
they might perceive it differently

707
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:06,180
or they might not fully understand

708
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,960
it even if they say they do which

709
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,730
over time is like a ticking time

710
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:10,029
bomb

711
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,900
and if you over explain it in this

712
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:15,420
weekly recap message we used to do

713
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:16,740
weekly recap messages that

714
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,170
were much longer than this and

715
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:19,789
nobody would ever read them now

716
00:20:19,789 --> 00:20:22,180
it's really easy i look at this

717
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:22,359
these

718
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,599
messages for you know five seconds

719
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:26,309
and i know seven positive replies

720
00:20:27,009 --> 00:20:28,500
five calls book this much value

721
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:30,140
added to my pipeline this much

722
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:31,809
expected revenue based on those

723
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,599
numbers where we're at or we're

724
00:20:33,829 --> 00:20:34,099
not where

725
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:39,559
we're at um and a beer great

726
00:20:39,559 --> 00:20:41,599
question so for people that uh

727
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:43,319
won't use slack we'll we'll

728
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:43,859
definitely do

729
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,400
check-ins via email we'll do

730
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,180
exactly what you're seeing here in

731
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:50,339
slack just through email um it is

732
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,470
very very ideal to get them into a

733
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:54,430
platform like slack but that's not

734
00:20:54,509 --> 00:20:55,539
always the case

735
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,180
and uh okay a lot of questions

736
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:01,720
this is awesome so or a great

737
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,539
question how do you determine

738
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:04,099
pipeline

739
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,670
value so the way we do pipeline

740
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:09,549
value is um shit honestly i forgot

741
00:21:09,549 --> 00:21:11,210
the formula but it's something

742
00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:12,839
along the lines of in the

743
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:14,920
onboarding form we ask them what

744
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:17,539
the ltv is of a client so say it's

745
00:21:17,539 --> 00:21:17,619
ten

746
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:20,130
thousand dollars ltv we'll look at

747
00:21:20,369 --> 00:21:22,319
how many positive replies we've

748
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:25,460
received and i think we we either

749
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:28,299
multiply it by we multiply it by

750
00:21:28,299 --> 00:21:31,230
the number of positive replies

751
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:33,349
yeah i think yeah i'm pretty

752
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:35,529
sure that the equation is as

753
00:21:36,069 --> 00:21:37,960
simple as each positive reply um

754
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,880
is a potential for them to close

755
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:42,400
a client so seven replies times

756
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,200
ten thousand ltv would be seventy

757
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,670
thousand dollars added to their

758
00:21:47,269 --> 00:21:48,019
pipeline

759
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:50,420
right again these numbers like

760
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:53,779
they're not as relevant as the

761
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:55,130
idea the foundation behind it

762
00:21:55,279 --> 00:21:56,980
what number can you show them what

763
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:58,650
unit of measurement makes sense

764
00:21:58,660 --> 00:21:59,859
for the service that you

765
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,500
provide that uh that you can

766
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,289
implement into these types of

767
00:22:03,289 --> 00:22:06,640
messages hopefully that helps and

768
00:22:06,869 --> 00:22:06,900
let

769
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,519
me know if you have follow-ups to

770
00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:11,779
that um yeah nico we we do these

771
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:15,769
manually um there are different

772
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:17,029
things you could do in slack like

773
00:22:17,029 --> 00:22:18,200
you could schedule send these

774
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,460
messages if you want to do them

775
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:19,640
all in

776
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:21,180
like a one hour time block and

777
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:22,650
schedule send them for two or

778
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:25,059
three days later um but the way to

779
00:22:25,059 --> 00:22:25,319
scale

780
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,950
this is truly through hiring uh

781
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:28,650
client success managers which we

782
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:30,180
could talk a little bit about

783
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,650
after the call we've talked about

784
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:33,099
it on previous calls but i'm happy

785
00:22:33,099 --> 00:22:34,039
to go through that again

786
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:35,680
uh and walk you through some of

787
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:38,109
the things we have set up there um

788
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:40,670
or we could even cover that next

789
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:42,319
week but let me just see there's a

790
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:43,700
lot here to catch up on so

791
00:22:43,759 --> 00:22:47,009
okay yeah connor yeah teams is

792
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:49,599
very garbage um i agree

793
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:53,470
uh in positive plans to get that

794
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:56,039
goal okay zach said i have one who

795
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,509
i call every week because he never

796
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,069
reads his emails i'm dealing with

797
00:22:59,069 --> 00:23:00,569
three or four different platforms

798
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:02,420
yeah so zach ideally you'll want

799
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:02,519
to get

800
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,559
all of your clients onto the same

801
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,210
platform um and just let them know

802
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:07,769
for you to perform your service

803
00:23:07,839 --> 00:23:09,430
to the highest level this needs to

804
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:11,089
happen which is either join slack

805
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,380
uh or to get on weekly calls with

806
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,170
you so i think it's a lot about

807
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:17,039
setting the frame and also the

808
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:19,380
incentive is important instead of

809
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:19,460
you

810
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:21,039
saying hey let's use slack because

811
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:22,740
i like that better than teams that

812
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,369
doesn't really give me much

813
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,720
of an incentive it's just oh

814
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,309
because you like it we're going to

815
00:23:27,309 --> 00:23:28,819
use it i don't think that's how it

816
00:23:29,059 --> 00:23:29,059
works

817
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:30,559
but if it's like i have to use

818
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:32,269
this because i can't get you the

819
00:23:32,269 --> 00:23:33,960
results i promised without it

820
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,950
it's like oh shit okay use it

821
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:37,849
whatever i'll learn how to use it

822
00:23:37,849 --> 00:23:39,940
and and that's worked really well

823
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:40,240
for us

824
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:43,109
um yeah beer make non-slack

825
00:23:43,109 --> 00:23:47,230
qualifying criteria 100 um yeah

826
00:23:47,269 --> 00:23:50,839
with the older clients definitely

827
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:51,539
um and i

828
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:53,930
think for those guys it's really

829
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:56,430
focusing on the the live calls the

830
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:58,819
zoom calls um which we'll talk

831
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,559
about in a second here okay lots

832
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:02,299
of great questions um and we'll

833
00:24:02,299 --> 00:24:04,470
i'm just going to continue because

834
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:04,660
i

835
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,380
want to i honestly did not expect

836
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:08,190
this presentation to go this long

837
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:10,019
but it is which is fine because i

838
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:12,170
i think there's value here but

839
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,250
anyways the just to recap the

840
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,420
written communication uh section

841
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:17,130
the

842
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,839
most important thing to understand

843
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,039
is the downside which is the tone

844
00:24:22,069 --> 00:24:24,160
often gets misinterpreted the

845
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:26,410
written communication right and

846
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:28,109
that can cause lots of problems

847
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:30,650
with clients it's just like any

848
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,240
relationship this is basically

849
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,730
this is a presentation on how to

850
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:34,549
effectively communicate

851
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,640
drop the clients part it doesn't

852
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,049
have to be clients it could be

853
00:24:39,059 --> 00:24:41,009
relationships with family it could

854
00:24:41,059 --> 00:24:41,140
be

855
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,559
anything um isn't just

856
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:44,339
communication one-on-one

857
00:24:44,339 --> 00:24:46,420
specifically for you know our

858
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:47,039
what's relevant

859
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:49,009
for us which is right now clients

860
00:24:49,009 --> 00:24:50,890
um so yeah the down the downside

861
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:53,220
is the tone gets misinterpreted

862
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:55,250
which is why it's important to

863
00:24:55,859 --> 00:24:57,079
implement live video communication

864
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,609
through zoom or whatever you use

865
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,299
there doesn't really matter or

866
00:25:01,299 --> 00:25:02,930
even a phone call a phone call is

867
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:05,859
just as good so any form of

868
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:08,640
live communication is is key um

869
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,480
and the number one thing that i uh

870
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:14,019
see people make mistakes with

871
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:15,339
here is they have no structure

872
00:25:15,339 --> 00:25:16,490
like they just get on a call

873
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:17,869
because andre said it's important

874
00:25:18,259 --> 00:25:18,339
to get

875
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,470
on a call with clients and then

876
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:20,519
they they hop on the call the

877
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:21,859
client and they're like how's it

878
00:25:21,859 --> 00:25:22,170
going

879
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,589
and there's no direction there's

880
00:25:24,759 --> 00:25:27,079
no control there's no structure um

881
00:25:27,079 --> 00:25:28,589
and so i think it's important

882
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:31,789
to always have an intention when

883
00:25:31,859 --> 00:25:34,329
you get on the phone with someone

884
00:25:34,549 --> 00:25:35,619
because if you get on

885
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,230
the phone with a client for the

886
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:38,920
first time and it's really just

887
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,490
like a big waste of time both

888
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:42,039
you and the client are going to be

889
00:25:42,039 --> 00:25:43,789
discouraged from getting on future

890
00:25:43,789 --> 00:25:45,380
calls um and again you want

891
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,630
to make this like a weekly or a

892
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:48,049
bi-weekly or a monthly practice

893
00:25:48,049 --> 00:25:49,319
and you're not going to be able

894
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:51,200
to do that if you make a bad first

895
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,970
impression um so really simply

896
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:55,359
like structure is key and a few

897
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,680
different elements that go into it

898
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,759
is before building just like

899
00:25:58,019 --> 00:25:58,900
anytime you get on the phone with

900
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,640
someone maintaining control of the

901
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,180
call just like you do in the sales

902
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:04,900
process having high energy

903
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,619
right now i honestly feel low

904
00:26:06,619 --> 00:26:08,599
energy but the higher energy will

905
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:11,299
just evoke more engagement

906
00:26:11,299 --> 00:26:11,329
throughout

907
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:13,990
the session is really important so

908
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:15,849
when you go and you're looking for

909
00:26:15,849 --> 00:26:17,779
client success managers and you

910
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:19,049
get on that initial call with the

911
00:26:19,049 --> 00:26:20,359
client success manager to do like

912
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,630
a screening interview the number

913
00:26:21,759 --> 00:26:23,279
one thing you're looking for is

914
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:24,880
high energy i knew as soon as the

915
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:25,819
first time i met trina

916
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,910
she's high energy like it's

917
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:29,950
infectious right like she brings

918
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:32,490
the energy no matter what and uh

919
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:32,519
and

920
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,339
and the positive vibes and that's

921
00:26:34,339 --> 00:26:36,049
communication one-on-one like that

922
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,539
makes people want to hang out

923
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:39,380
around you and spend time with you

924
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:41,240
um and so that's super important

925
00:26:41,289 --> 00:26:42,440
right when you do live

926
00:26:42,869 --> 00:26:43,380
communication

927
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:45,589
uh the simple structure that i

928
00:26:45,589 --> 00:26:47,329
think is applicable to really any

929
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,059
agency owner or business owner

930
00:26:49,119 --> 00:26:50,869
uh that i use on the calls is

931
00:26:50,869 --> 00:26:53,000
first off talking about where they

932
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,380
were right press the pain points

933
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,109
you uncovered during the sales

934
00:26:57,109 --> 00:26:58,910
process just recap hey so when we

935
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:00,740
first started to work together

936
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:01,960
um you were letting me know most

937
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,039
of your clients were coming

938
00:27:03,369 --> 00:27:04,420
through referrals you maybe have

939
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:04,680
one or two

940
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,319
calls uh being booked through your

941
00:27:07,539 --> 00:27:09,470
website inbound um and so let's

942
00:27:09,579 --> 00:27:11,309
see you know where we're at now a

943
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:11,700
few

944
00:27:11,759 --> 00:27:13,480
weeks in their campaigns this is

945
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,250
where we're at so tell them where

946
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:16,579
we're at right so i'll just kind

947
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,069
of walk you through a scenario let

948
00:27:18,069 --> 00:27:19,450
me walk through all these first

949
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:20,700
and then i'll walk you through a

950
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:22,400
scenario um tell them where

951
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,329
they're at and then let them know

952
00:27:24,329 --> 00:27:26,259
whether this is ahead or behind

953
00:27:26,259 --> 00:27:26,349
the

954
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,900
schedule it's easy to tell them

955
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,480
we're ahead of schedule and we're

956
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,980
doing well it's not so easy to

957
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:32,920
tell them hey we're behind we're

958
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,799
not doing so well but you need to

959
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:37,059
um and and that's really the the

960
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:38,769
the end of that um and so the then

961
00:27:38,769 --> 00:27:40,369
the next thing to cover is where

962
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,970
they're going so this is where

963
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:43,529
we're at here's where we're going

964
00:27:43,529 --> 00:27:44,930
and how are you going to get them

965
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:46,660
there what is the action plan what

966
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,410
are the steps look like uh other

967
00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:50,359
important things is to constantly

968
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:52,279
reconfirm they're engaged right

969
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:52,559
ask

970
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,319
them simple things like how's this

971
00:27:54,319 --> 00:27:55,640
done how does this feel any

972
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,220
questions right these are all

973
00:27:57,450 --> 00:27:57,450
really

974
00:27:57,519 --> 00:28:00,150
important so an example structure

975
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:02,460
would be like hey um client you

976
00:28:02,779 --> 00:28:04,980
know when we first started working

977
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:06,819
together you were getting maybe

978
00:28:06,819 --> 00:28:08,559
one or two calls booked a week uh

979
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:09,940
either from referrals

980
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,339
uh or inbound your website where

981
00:28:12,519 --> 00:28:14,750
we're at now is we have campaigns

982
00:28:15,269 --> 00:28:17,049
launched uh last week we had seven

983
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:18,759
positive replies which led to two

984
00:28:18,759 --> 00:28:20,150
calls booked which is great

985
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:22,019
because we just doubled the amount

986
00:28:22,019 --> 00:28:22,500
of calls

987
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:23,880
booked uh from when we first

988
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,650
started working together but to be

989
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:27,460
honest it's still a little behind

990
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:29,410
schedule uh with seven positive

991
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:31,279
replies we want to see at least a

992
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:33,359
50 call book rate which would put

993
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:33,539
us

994
00:28:33,599 --> 00:28:35,210
right around three or four calls

995
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:36,740
um so we have a gap that needs to

996
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:38,500
be filled around one or two calls

997
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:41,700
so we're going to get on more

998
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:44,920
frequent calls like this to just

999
00:28:45,509 --> 00:28:48,250
really you know press on uh the

1000
00:28:48,319 --> 00:28:50,140
training and what we talked about

1001
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:51,940
on our onboarding call and we're

1002
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:53,359
going to take a better look at

1003
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,089
campaigns to see you know why

1004
00:28:55,089 --> 00:28:57,029
prospects are not booking calls

1005
00:28:57,029 --> 00:28:58,660
right away or whatever just

1006
00:28:58,710 --> 00:28:59,279
explaining what

1007
00:28:59,359 --> 00:29:01,000
what you're going to do next how

1008
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,900
does that sound any questions boom

1009
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:05,140
right really simple format and

1010
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,759
obviously like that just happened

1011
00:29:06,759 --> 00:29:08,269
in the matter of like minutes but

1012
00:29:08,269 --> 00:29:10,339
you're going to go through each

1013
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,960
of these steps with more detail

1014
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,529
maybe even screen sharing and

1015
00:29:13,529 --> 00:29:15,220
walking them through specific

1016
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:15,940
things

1017
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,759
if your service is more visual i

1018
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:19,470
know a lot of you guys do klavia

1019
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:20,740
like this would work extremely

1020
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:22,039
well for klavia like hey when we

1021
00:29:22,039 --> 00:29:23,539
first started working together you

1022
00:29:23,539 --> 00:29:25,299
had 2 000 people on your list

1023
00:29:25,359 --> 00:29:27,250
you're sending maybe an email a

1024
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:29,119
month um and i think what was it

1025
00:29:29,119 --> 00:29:31,059
four percent of your revenue was

1026
00:29:31,119 --> 00:29:33,019
coming from email now uh you still

1027
00:29:33,019 --> 00:29:35,480
have you have 2500 people on your

1028
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:37,480
list more people are subscribing

1029
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,660
less people are unsubscribing

1030
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:41,250
we're sending an email a week

1031
00:29:41,349 --> 00:29:43,299
consistently which is resulting in

1032
00:29:43,359 --> 00:29:45,950
uh 20 of your revenue to come from

1033
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:48,210
email and so we're right where we

1034
00:29:48,599 --> 00:29:49,720
need to be what we should now

1035
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:51,859
focus on is obviously continuing

1036
00:29:51,859 --> 00:29:53,539
the system but also adding more

1037
00:29:53,539 --> 00:29:55,140
people to your email list so you

1038
00:29:55,299 --> 00:29:55,859
can see

1039
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,619
more of these benefits how can we

1040
00:29:57,619 --> 00:29:59,720
make that happen boom right go

1041
00:30:00,329 --> 00:30:01,759
into it so this is a good format

1042
00:30:01,819 --> 00:30:01,940
for

1043
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,859
weekly calls again uh simple

1044
00:30:03,859 --> 00:30:05,799
things to buffer uh what you're

1045
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:08,019
saying like how does this sound or

1046
00:30:08,019 --> 00:30:08,359
any questions

1047
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:12,130
go a long way um okay how how is

1048
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:15,869
that before we recap or wrap up

1049
00:30:15,869 --> 00:30:18,420
this last piece because the last

1050
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:18,579
piece

1051
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,180
is is just how you like end the

1052
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:31,299
call basically questions in the

1053
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:34,579
chat

1054
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:42,779
all right um cool so hopefully

1055
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,220
this makes sense i think the

1056
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:47,220
structure again is really

1057
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:47,599
important

1058
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,369
where were they where are they

1059
00:30:49,369 --> 00:30:51,319
where are they going super simple

1060
00:30:51,329 --> 00:30:53,460
but it's super effective uh

1061
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:55,440
and gives you something to plan

1062
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,309
around um anyways at the end of

1063
00:30:57,339 --> 00:30:59,460
the call you want to give them

1064
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:01,359
clarity on what needs to happen

1065
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:03,029
next you always want to have

1066
00:31:03,029 --> 00:31:04,980
action items or next steps which

1067
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:05,069
is

1068
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,630
something that we started to

1069
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:08,450
implement recently on our coaching

1070
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:10,049
calls which is after the call i'm

1071
00:31:10,099 --> 00:31:10,180
going

1072
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,920
to ask you what was your main main

1073
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,490
takeaway and what is an action

1074
00:31:13,599 --> 00:31:15,220
item based on what you learned

1075
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:17,170
on this call because you always

1076
00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:19,160
want to have implementation if we

1077
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:20,329
just talk about

1078
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,880
shit and and you think you're

1079
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,160
learning but you're not

1080
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:24,980
implementing none of the stuff

1081
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:25,539
really is going to

1082
00:31:25,599 --> 00:31:27,109
matter um so here's a few

1083
00:31:27,109 --> 00:31:29,240
different things you could use to

1084
00:31:29,299 --> 00:31:30,900
wrap your call right so

1085
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,569
this is a super loaded question um

1086
00:31:33,569 --> 00:31:36,349
which is actually honestly really

1087
00:31:36,349 --> 00:31:38,740
scary to ask uh on a

1088
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:40,119
live call it's easier to ask

1089
00:31:40,119 --> 00:31:41,799
there's black but it's important

1090
00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:43,380
that you ask this on a live call

1091
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,160
so the the question is how is your

1092
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:47,059
perception of our services today

1093
00:31:47,059 --> 00:31:49,210
the reason it's scary is because

1094
00:31:49,269 --> 00:31:50,599
a lot of times you might not feel

1095
00:31:50,599 --> 00:31:51,990
super confident about the what

1096
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:53,460
what the client's going to say

1097
00:31:53,619 --> 00:31:53,619
they

1098
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,440
might say they're not too happy

1099
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,319
with your services and that's not

1100
00:31:57,319 --> 00:31:59,519
information that agency owners are

1101
00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:01,180
wanting to hear all the time um

1102
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:03,089
what do you consider it successful

1103
00:32:03,089 --> 00:32:04,450
what else would you need to see

1104
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:04,579
out

1105
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,819
of this partnership to make it

1106
00:32:05,819 --> 00:32:07,000
successful so this is a super

1107
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:08,180
important question as well

1108
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:08,519
straight up

1109
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,750
asking them based on this

1110
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:11,250
conversation based on where we're

1111
00:32:11,299 --> 00:32:12,509
at based on where it looks like

1112
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:12,779
we're

1113
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,779
going what do you need to see out

1114
00:32:14,779 --> 00:32:16,579
of our work together to make it

1115
00:32:16,579 --> 00:32:18,799
successful like in your words

1116
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,490
what is success and then based on

1117
00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:23,859
what they say if they say oh i'll

1118
00:32:24,079 --> 00:32:25,930
be for this to be successful i'll

1119
00:32:26,079 --> 00:32:27,700
have to close three clients uh

1120
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:29,440
before the end of month which is

1121
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:31,539
uh tomorrow actually don't just be

1122
00:32:31,599 --> 00:32:33,039
like okay we'll do our best we'll

1123
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:34,440
try to make it happen you still

1124
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:36,259
have to set realistic expectations

1125
00:32:36,319 --> 00:32:38,509
like to be honest that's not at

1126
00:32:38,779 --> 00:32:41,119
all uh reasonable and we discussed

1127
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:42,900
this in our sales process and the

1128
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,900
onboarding process what we can

1129
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,599
what we can expect is x y and z

1130
00:32:46,650 --> 00:32:48,740
how does that sound would that be

1131
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:50,490
successful to you to close one

1132
00:32:50,490 --> 00:32:52,309
more client in the next week and

1133
00:32:52,309 --> 00:32:54,099
and have that conversation it's

1134
00:32:54,099 --> 00:32:54,259
not

1135
00:32:54,319 --> 00:32:56,349
an easy conversation to have um

1136
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:58,200
it's just reps the more you can

1137
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,579
force yourself into situations

1138
00:33:00,579 --> 00:33:00,660
like

1139
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:02,069
these the better you'll get at

1140
00:33:02,069 --> 00:33:03,220
them and it's just going to

1141
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:05,220
improve your service uh which is

1142
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:05,609
the most

1143
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,170
exciting part out of all of it a

1144
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:08,789
few other things uh at the end of

1145
00:33:08,789 --> 00:33:10,420
these calls you can do is schedule

1146
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:10,500
a

1147
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:12,009
follow-up call if it's relevant

1148
00:33:12,009 --> 00:33:13,309
just like you do at the end of

1149
00:33:13,309 --> 00:33:14,180
your sales calls

1150
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,579
if you don't get to close right

1151
00:33:15,579 --> 00:33:17,089
away always get time on calendar

1152
00:33:17,089 --> 00:33:19,940
again if it makes sense to send a

1153
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,789
recap in the slack channel uh

1154
00:33:21,789 --> 00:33:23,779
shout out trina she does recaps

1155
00:33:23,779 --> 00:33:25,700
for us now in fine ascension and

1156
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:26,099
they're

1157
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,119
incredible um don't try to live up

1158
00:33:28,119 --> 00:33:29,799
to trina's recaps that'll be

1159
00:33:29,829 --> 00:33:32,490
really hard for you to do um but

1160
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,880
any recap will do at least the

1161
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,279
start and and then you can build

1162
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:38,099
on that um and then maybe trina

1163
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,839
will do a master class in here at

1164
00:33:39,839 --> 00:33:41,579
some point on on how she does her

1165
00:33:41,579 --> 00:33:43,859
uh recaps and everything else

1166
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:46,000
and then the last thing which is

1167
00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:47,799
super important is if you feel

1168
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:49,859
that the call went well and the

1169
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:52,230
client's pretty happy overall ask

1170
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:54,589
for referrals people don't do this

1171
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:56,289
agency owners do not do this

1172
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:59,029
uh practically ever and so if you

1173
00:33:59,029 --> 00:34:00,539
make it a habit to ask for

1174
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:02,740
referrals and there's really easy

1175
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:04,779
lightweight ways to do this such

1176
00:34:04,779 --> 00:34:06,589
as hey uh you know we're looking

1177
00:34:06,869 --> 00:34:09,130
to grow our business going into q4

1178
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,590
we've done a lot of great work

1179
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,260
together do you have any friends

1180
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:13,780
uh or other business owners that

1181
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:14,420
might

1182
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,980
get value from from similar

1183
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:17,659
services if you could put us in

1184
00:34:17,659 --> 00:34:19,780
touch that'd be great and a lot of

1185
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:20,039
times

1186
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,650
you'll get referrals uh that can

1187
00:34:21,650 --> 00:34:23,130
lead to new clients which is you

1188
00:34:23,139 --> 00:34:24,739
know obviously a good thing so

1189
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:26,179
that is um

1190
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:29,199
live video communication and again

1191
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:31,980
this is important to pair with uh

1192
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:33,949
written communication

1193
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:36,769
because written communication a

1194
00:34:36,769 --> 00:34:39,460
lot of times uh the tone gets lost

1195
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:41,130
and so video communication really

1196
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:41,380
makes

1197
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,039
up for that it provides more

1198
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:44,630
structure you have higher

1199
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:46,659
engagement um and you can do a lot

1200
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:47,460
more uh

1201
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:50,239
of explaining the why as connor

1202
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:53,250
put it so questions on that let's

1203
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:55,349
let's use that as a stopping point

1204
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,230
and then i'll go into a recap and

1205
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:58,900
then we could do full end q a

1206
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,710
no questions on the video stuff

1207
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:11,550
okay here we go how often do you

1208
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:14,019
ask for referrals anytime i'm on a

1209
00:35:14,019 --> 00:35:14,099
call

1210
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,800
with a client i ask for a referral

1211
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:19,449
unless i feel like i don't deserve

1212
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:22,579
to ask that if it's if there's

1213
00:35:22,639 --> 00:35:24,920
if you're underperforming and you

1214
00:35:25,159 --> 00:35:26,769
get the vibe the client is is

1215
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:29,360
pretty unsatisfied don't ask for

1216
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:31,480
referrals it's more like a vibe

1217
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,329
check if you feel the call went

1218
00:35:33,329 --> 00:35:35,780
well energy is high positive vibes

1219
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:36,179
ask for

1220
00:35:36,239 --> 00:35:39,179
a referral every time um and and

1221
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:42,440
don't and be confident in that ask

1222
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:45,190
uh we also ask for referrals

1223
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,170
in our onboarding form which is

1224
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:49,159
which people find crazy but you'd

1225
00:35:49,199 --> 00:35:50,900
be surprised at the end of our

1226
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,550
onboarding form the last question

1227
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:54,190
and think about this right because

1228
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:56,340
this is the client hasn't seen

1229
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,349
any of our work they just signed

1230
00:35:58,349 --> 00:36:00,280
on with us so all they've done so

1231
00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:02,420
far is they've paid us and filled

1232
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:02,579
out

1233
00:36:02,639 --> 00:36:03,960
an onboarding form and the last

1234
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,500
question in the onboarding form is

1235
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:06,519
who might also be interested

1236
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,440
in our services it's crazy because

1237
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:11,719
i when i first heard of this idea

1238
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:13,309
i was like no way like anyone

1239
00:36:13,679 --> 00:36:15,719
would refer us to people before

1240
00:36:15,719 --> 00:36:18,250
even working with us right now i'm

1241
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:20,739
pretty sure it's over 50 percent

1242
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,119
of people that have filled out our

1243
00:36:22,119 --> 00:36:23,480
onboarding form which is close to

1244
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,699
100 clients have given

1245
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,150
us a referral and it's not going

1246
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:28,480
to lead to a client every time

1247
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,820
it's usually just like an email

1248
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:32,039
address or a name or a twitter

1249
00:36:32,039 --> 00:36:33,949
handle but we've signed clients

1250
00:36:34,469 --> 00:36:36,260
out of that uh i think three or

1251
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:36,500
four

1252
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,179
in recent memories so add that i

1253
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:41,610
mean why not right and and yeah

1254
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:43,679
we'll we'll always give them a

1255
00:36:43,909 --> 00:36:44,010
referral

1256
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,550
kick uh i'll actually show you

1257
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:46,800
guys the wording because i'm

1258
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:47,960
getting questions on this

1259
00:36:50,659 --> 00:36:55,630
um so this is an updated

1260
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:57,789
onboarding form uh the old one was

1261
00:36:57,929 --> 00:36:59,780
a little bit different but okay

1262
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:00,179
here's

1263
00:37:00,239 --> 00:37:02,130
here's the way we word it give the

1264
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:03,880
gift of growth we want to give you

1265
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,050
a fat discount in month

1266
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:06,570
two refer us to fellow agency

1267
00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:08,369
owner and you'll both get 500

1268
00:37:08,469 --> 00:37:10,059
discounted from your second

1269
00:37:10,389 --> 00:37:10,500
invoice

1270
00:37:10,559 --> 00:37:12,119
so there's obviously some

1271
00:37:12,119 --> 00:37:14,190
incentive it's not just like who

1272
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:16,260
else might want our services

1273
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,579
um but when we word it this way

1274
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:22,659
again over 50 response rate with

1275
00:37:23,269 --> 00:37:24,980
someone's email or their phone

1276
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:25,269
number

1277
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:30,840
whatever else um do you give them

1278
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:33,139
a referral kick isaac asks are you

1279
00:37:33,139 --> 00:37:34,079
doing monthly check-in

1280
00:37:34,159 --> 00:37:36,239
calls along with weekly check and

1281
00:37:36,699 --> 00:37:38,039
update via slack um so these calls

1282
00:37:38,679 --> 00:37:40,340
that we talked about here

1283
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,469
live communication it really

1284
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:44,849
depends on the service um but like

1285
00:37:45,010 --> 00:37:46,739
for our agency if we could get on

1286
00:37:46,739 --> 00:37:47,449
a call

1287
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,880
a month with a client we're happy

1288
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,710
i found it to be really difficult

1289
00:37:51,909 --> 00:37:53,690
to get clients to come on the

1290
00:37:53,699 --> 00:37:54,250
calls

1291
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,539
and to be able to share relevant

1292
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:58,280
updates in these three categories

1293
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:02,230
if if you're doing it weekly

1294
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:02,579
you're

1295
00:38:02,639 --> 00:38:04,449
kind of just saying the same shit

1296
00:38:04,449 --> 00:38:06,030
and they're going to get bored and

1297
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:08,739
it doesn't buy you enough time to

1298
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,639
implement this part where where

1299
00:38:10,639 --> 00:38:12,199
are we going right because if

1300
00:38:12,199 --> 00:38:13,739
you're on a call and you're like

1301
00:38:14,019 --> 00:38:14,019
okay

1302
00:38:14,719 --> 00:38:16,210
we're not getting the best results

1303
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:17,679
we need to implement the training

1304
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:18,599
we need to do x y and z

1305
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:20,170
before you know it you're on a

1306
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:21,409
call again with them seven days

1307
00:38:21,650 --> 00:38:22,659
later and you're like yeah we

1308
00:38:22,659 --> 00:38:22,920
still need

1309
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:24,460
to do these things and to them it

1310
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:25,949
feels like no progress is being

1311
00:38:25,949 --> 00:38:28,079
made so i'm more of a fan of

1312
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:30,159
uh you know doing the weekly

1313
00:38:30,159 --> 00:38:32,300
check-ins through slack like we

1314
00:38:32,469 --> 00:38:34,739
saw here and then supplementing

1315
00:38:34,739 --> 00:38:35,289
that with

1316
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,659
bi-weekly or monthly live calls

1317
00:38:38,019 --> 00:38:40,179
again depending on on your service

1318
00:38:40,239 --> 00:38:46,019
what else questions questions

1319
00:38:46,019 --> 00:38:46,500
questions

1320
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:50,349
are you setting expectations with

1321
00:38:51,179 --> 00:38:53,610
check-ins calls um yeah the

1322
00:38:54,050 --> 00:38:56,980
onboarding process uh we set

1323
00:38:57,039 --> 00:38:58,630
all the kpis and expectations so

1324
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:00,239
this is really important great

1325
00:39:00,239 --> 00:39:00,920
question isaac

1326
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,380
so our onboarding process we have

1327
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:06,199
them fill out an onboarding form

1328
00:39:06,869 --> 00:39:07,780
and then we have them

1329
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,800
schedule an onboarding call and

1330
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,900
then after the onboarding call we

1331
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:13,940
schedule them for an alignment

1332
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,519
call and on the alignment call we

1333
00:39:16,579 --> 00:39:19,969
show them this which is the cold

1334
00:39:19,969 --> 00:39:22,809
email sales funnel and we say

1335
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,889
here is the sales funnel uh the

1336
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:27,300
typical sales funnel through cold

1337
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,780
email you can expect the 50%

1338
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:32,099
open rate 10 reply rate 25

1339
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:34,420
interested reply rate 50 call

1340
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:36,820
booked rate and a 20 close rate

1341
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,559
so we're setting these kpis and

1342
00:39:38,559 --> 00:39:40,500
this is what we're coming back to

1343
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,420
so when we do a call or we do a

1344
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:43,059
kpi or

1345
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:45,440
we do a check and we're like okay

1346
00:39:45,699 --> 00:39:48,659
70 open rates check 15 reply rate

1347
00:39:48,659 --> 00:39:50,820
check out of those 18 are

1348
00:39:51,369 --> 00:39:51,380
interested

1349
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,110
so let's see you know what we can

1350
00:39:53,110 --> 00:39:54,630
do to the copy to get a more of

1351
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:56,500
those interested but because the

1352
00:39:56,699 --> 00:39:56,739
open

1353
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,239
open rate and reply rate are so

1354
00:39:58,239 --> 00:39:59,789
high we're actually still well

1355
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:02,019
above kpi overall um call book

1356
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:02,260
rate

1357
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,420
it's 30 sounds like we need to go

1358
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:06,199
uh through the training a lot more

1359
00:40:06,739 --> 00:40:08,099
here to increase that and then

1360
00:40:08,159 --> 00:40:09,530
your close rate is too early to

1361
00:40:09,530 --> 00:40:10,889
tell and that's how you do the

1362
00:40:10,889 --> 00:40:12,579
updates every single time so the

1363
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:13,059
alignment

1364
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:15,150
call is like a 15 minute call

1365
00:40:15,539 --> 00:40:17,000
right after the onboarding call

1366
00:40:17,559 --> 00:40:18,889
like a few days after the

1367
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:19,480
onboarding call

1368
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,320
the reason is i've found uh

1369
00:40:22,949 --> 00:40:24,280
onboarding calls are are really

1370
00:40:25,019 --> 00:40:26,980
content heavy when you're on an

1371
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:27,380
onboarding

1372
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,380
call it's like the first

1373
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:29,630
interaction you're trying to

1374
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:31,059
explain all this different stuff

1375
00:40:31,059 --> 00:40:31,500
that goes into

1376
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:32,829
your work and it's very

1377
00:40:32,829 --> 00:40:34,309
overwhelming chances are the

1378
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:35,559
client's not going to remember

1379
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:36,500
everything

1380
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:37,789
and if there's one thing you

1381
00:40:37,789 --> 00:40:39,340
really need them to remember it's

1382
00:40:39,349 --> 00:40:41,599
the kpi as you said so instead of

1383
00:40:41,679 --> 00:40:43,719
doing it on the onboarding call

1384
00:40:43,719 --> 00:40:45,579
you can do it on an alignment call

1385
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:47,619
and that's how you know they're

1386
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:49,659
going to receive that information

1387
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:51,559
because it's all you talk about on

1388
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,219
an alignment call and you could

1389
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,159
also do it as nick just mentioned

1390
00:40:55,159 --> 00:40:57,070
through uh videos you could record

1391
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:59,219
a video for them and say hey

1392
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,650
campaigns are launched here's what

1393
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:01,869
you can expect let me know if you

1394
00:41:01,869 --> 00:41:02,739
have any questions

1395
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:09,610
um response times i always tell

1396
00:41:09,699 --> 00:41:12,340
clients monday through friday uh

1397
00:41:12,389 --> 00:41:14,820
give us at least 24 hours

1398
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,309
again this goes into what we'll

1399
00:41:16,309 --> 00:41:17,869
talk about in a second here which

1400
00:41:17,869 --> 00:41:19,780
is under promise over deliver

1401
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,250
most of the time i can get back to

1402
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:22,969
someone within 24 hours i mean i

1403
00:41:22,969 --> 00:41:24,579
have two people on my team to do

1404
00:41:24,639 --> 00:41:25,659
this but if you set the

1405
00:41:25,659 --> 00:41:27,230
expectation i won't get back to

1406
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:28,969
you within 24 hours and you get

1407
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:29,619
back to them

1408
00:41:29,679 --> 00:41:31,800
constantly within a few minutes or

1409
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,289
a few hours like they're

1410
00:41:33,289 --> 00:41:35,780
constantly going to be delighted

1411
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:36,659
because it's it's

1412
00:41:36,719 --> 00:41:38,349
about you're over delivering

1413
00:41:38,349 --> 00:41:39,760
you're you're exceeding

1414
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:40,510
expectations

1415
00:41:40,719 --> 00:41:44,510
love the questions this just makes

1416
00:41:45,329 --> 00:41:47,769
the the presentation so much more

1417
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:49,679
valuable and relevant to

1418
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:52,119
your guys's experiences with this

1419
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:54,889
stuff i'm going to quickly recap

1420
00:41:55,110 --> 00:41:56,559
uh and then we'll dive into we

1421
00:41:56,739 --> 00:41:56,739
have

1422
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,800
like 15 minutes left uh for

1423
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:00,679
questions so the recap here number

1424
00:42:01,329 --> 00:42:02,639
one always always always always

1425
00:42:02,699 --> 00:42:03,139
always be

1426
00:42:03,519 --> 00:42:05,460
looking for wins always always

1427
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:07,400
always always be looking for wins

1428
00:42:07,679 --> 00:42:09,539
i can't stress how important

1429
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:11,849
that is um again because it's how

1430
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:14,159
you make them feel it's not about

1431
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:15,940
what you do so if you make them

1432
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:17,420
feel like they're constantly

1433
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:18,869
winning and if you get them into

1434
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:19,949
the house it's like a gratitude

1435
00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:20,739
journal

1436
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,269
right it's like oh why would you

1437
00:42:22,269 --> 00:42:23,860
write down what you're grateful

1438
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:25,460
for every morning like what's the

1439
00:42:25,519 --> 00:42:26,909
point of that it's because it

1440
00:42:26,909 --> 00:42:28,380
forces your subconscious to

1441
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:30,179
constantly look for things to be

1442
00:42:30,329 --> 00:42:30,820
grateful for

1443
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,710
it reprograms your mind and that's

1444
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:34,670
what you're essentially doing here

1445
00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:36,099
with your clients is you're

1446
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:38,130
forcing them to always be looking

1447
00:42:38,130 --> 00:42:39,730
for wins and seeing wins in

1448
00:42:39,730 --> 00:42:41,619
situations that they might not

1449
00:42:41,619 --> 00:42:41,860
have

1450
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,920
perceived originally as a win so

1451
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,710
it's really cool so that's the

1452
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:47,380
first part the second part is

1453
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:47,619
under

1454
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:49,289
promise so you can over deliver

1455
00:42:49,289 --> 00:42:50,769
right you always want to set

1456
00:42:50,769 --> 00:42:52,719
yourself up to over deliver and

1457
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:52,980
the

1458
00:42:53,039 --> 00:42:54,670
easiest way to do that is to under

1459
00:42:54,670 --> 00:42:56,280
promise um and doing that in a way

1460
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,019
where you're not compromising

1461
00:42:58,079 --> 00:42:59,619
the sale like you're like hey yeah

1462
00:42:59,619 --> 00:43:01,170
this service doesn't work at all

1463
00:43:01,170 --> 00:43:02,920
but you should pay for it anyways

1464
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:05,380
like don't under promise to that

1465
00:43:05,849 --> 00:43:07,769
extent but enough to where um you

1466
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:11,190
are set up to over deliver uh

1467
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:13,320
leverage client success stories to

1468
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:15,110
encourage action um so if you're

1469
00:43:15,769 --> 00:43:16,980
managing a large client base

1470
00:43:17,039 --> 00:43:19,019
leverage other client success

1471
00:43:19,570 --> 00:43:20,909
stories hey this client did x y

1472
00:43:21,179 --> 00:43:23,219
and z and got this result would

1473
00:43:23,219 --> 00:43:23,750
love to see

1474
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:25,710
the same for you um a lot of times

1475
00:43:25,710 --> 00:43:27,570
what happens is you're in this

1476
00:43:27,570 --> 00:43:29,139
bubble with just you and the

1477
00:43:29,139 --> 00:43:29,679
client

1478
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,610
in the private channels and they

1479
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:33,369
don't take you so seriously or

1480
00:43:33,369 --> 00:43:34,900
they don't believe that what

1481
00:43:35,019 --> 00:43:35,139
you're

1482
00:43:35,199 --> 00:43:36,730
asking them to do or what you're

1483
00:43:36,730 --> 00:43:38,219
updating them on is actually

1484
00:43:38,219 --> 00:43:39,860
getting you anywhere so if you

1485
00:43:40,019 --> 00:43:40,420
could pull

1486
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:41,780
in other examples of similar

1487
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:43,150
clients that are getting the

1488
00:43:43,150 --> 00:43:44,539
results and this is why again the

1489
00:43:45,059 --> 00:43:45,860
wins channel

1490
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,360
incline ascension is so great

1491
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:48,920
because everyone is seeing all

1492
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:50,730
these other students winning and

1493
00:43:50,739 --> 00:43:50,960
it's

1494
00:43:51,039 --> 00:43:52,280
validating the fact that it's

1495
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:53,980
possible and that it's real right

1496
00:43:53,989 --> 00:43:56,420
and that encourages action i know

1497
00:43:56,420 --> 00:43:56,820
for me

1498
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,480
even and i'm like a coach and one

1499
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:00,010
of the co-founders about the

1500
00:44:00,010 --> 00:44:02,650
program going through the wins

1501
00:44:02,659 --> 00:44:02,980
channel

1502
00:44:03,039 --> 00:44:04,730
encourages me to take more action

1503
00:44:04,730 --> 00:44:06,289
i'm like well shit like i didn't

1504
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,019
have a win like this today let me

1505
00:44:08,019 --> 00:44:08,179
go

1506
00:44:08,239 --> 00:44:09,840
back on my email and see if i can

1507
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:11,239
make a deal happen or go on

1508
00:44:11,239 --> 00:44:13,219
twitter and put out more content

1509
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:15,369
right so leverage client success

1510
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:17,059
stories encourage action

1511
00:44:17,059 --> 00:44:19,639
consistently communicate via slack

1512
00:44:20,769 --> 00:44:21,059
and zoom

1513
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:23,889
have that dynamic of both written

1514
00:44:23,889 --> 00:44:25,639
and live communication depending

1515
00:44:26,090 --> 00:44:27,400
on the tools you prefer

1516
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:29,070
and and to read to end it just

1517
00:44:29,070 --> 00:44:30,969
over communicate i think that's

1518
00:44:30,969 --> 00:44:33,059
the the biggest thing that people

1519
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:35,079
miss uh with client management

1520
00:44:35,630 --> 00:44:37,030
ongoing client management is they

1521
00:44:37,650 --> 00:44:39,380
just don't communicate nearly

1522
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:40,460
enough so if you could force

1523
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:41,900
yourself to over communicate um

1524
00:44:42,019 --> 00:44:44,500
and i think this this presentation

1525
00:44:44,710 --> 00:44:45,460
is is helpful to do

1526
00:44:45,519 --> 00:44:47,320
that because it gives you real

1527
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:49,349
examples ideas and frameworks to

1528
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:52,500
implement to do exactly that uh i

1529
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:52,570
think

1530
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,670
you'll retain clients a lot longer

1531
00:44:54,670 --> 00:44:56,440
and therefore you know increase

1532
00:44:56,510 --> 00:44:58,900
the value of uh your business

1533
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:01,340
the ltv everything else so uh a

1534
00:45:01,539 --> 00:45:03,960
lot of talking from me today um so

1535
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:06,789
i'll open it up to questions i'm

1536
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:08,739
gonna stop the share for now i'll

1537
00:45:09,389 --> 00:45:10,710

1538
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:12,650
with everyone and the recording

1539
00:45:12,659 --> 00:45:13,380

1541
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:19,619
what do you guys think overall

1542
00:45:19,619 --> 00:45:21,619
reactions was that valuable

1543
00:45:21,699 --> 00:45:22,900
relevant

1544
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:24,980
interesting boring

1545
00:45:25,039 --> 00:45:28,500
super helpful

1546
00:45:31,059 --> 00:45:32,059
yeah straightforward stuff like

1547
00:45:32,059 --> 00:45:34,659
that sounds so simple but it is

1548
00:45:34,659 --> 00:45:35,460
helpful because you don't show

1549
00:45:35,519 --> 00:45:36,500
up to something like what should i

1550
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:37,380
say what's the best way to say

1551
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:38,260
this like it really is

1552
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:42,110
yeah that's straightforward 100

1553
00:45:42,929 --> 00:45:47,139
what does kpi stand for um

1554
00:45:49,199 --> 00:45:50,650
key performance indicator key

1555
00:45:50,650 --> 00:45:52,840
performance indicator i was gonna

1556
00:45:52,889 --> 00:45:54,980
say campaign i was like campaign

1557
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:55,219
wait

1558
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:58,039
campaign starts with a c um it's

1559
00:45:58,050 --> 00:46:02,000
like performance yeah key

1560
00:46:02,230 --> 00:46:04,019
performance it's just like what

1561
00:46:04,030 --> 00:46:04,900
what are the

1562
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:07,389
expected metrics right like if you

1563
00:46:07,539 --> 00:46:08,849
have a big client base of like

1564
00:46:09,570 --> 00:46:11,699
fitness coach clients their kpis

1565
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:13,360
would be weight like circumference

1566
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:15,530
measurement like exactly exactly

1567
00:46:15,630 --> 00:46:18,809
yeah what is what are we trying

1568
00:46:19,039 --> 00:46:21,480
to achieve here yeah like kpi for

1569
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:23,619
a fitness program would be

1570
00:46:23,659 --> 00:46:26,090
dropping 10 pounds in in month one

1571
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:26,820
or in 30

1572
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:28,619
days right oh we dropped seven

1573
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:29,889
pounds in 30 days we're well

1574
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:31,780
here's what we're going to do to

1575
00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:31,920
live

1576
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:34,130
up to the cake guy we talked about

1577
00:46:34,130 --> 00:46:35,880
x y and z we're not going to give

1578
00:46:36,019 --> 00:46:39,619
up right and so this this again

1579
00:46:39,679 --> 00:46:41,760
is relevant to really any business

1580
00:46:42,130 --> 00:46:43,469
model where there's a service

1581
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:45,860
involved one of the biggest

1582
00:46:45,860 --> 00:46:46,730
takeaways to that

1583
00:46:47,199 --> 00:46:48,570
i didn't mention enough uh

1584
00:46:48,570 --> 00:46:50,000
throughout this is it's an

1585
00:46:50,010 --> 00:46:51,860
experience you want to create an

1586
00:46:52,460 --> 00:46:52,739
experience for

1587
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,769
your clients and obviously you can

1588
00:46:54,769 --> 00:46:56,380
do that through what we just

1589
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:58,260
talked about through communicating

1590
00:46:58,260 --> 00:46:58,349
in

1591
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:00,389
slack and through zoom but just

1592
00:47:00,389 --> 00:47:02,269
really think on that like create

1593
00:47:02,590 --> 00:47:04,420
an experience something that

1594
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:08,590
will put a smile on their face

1595
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:11,340
something that they'll remember

1596
00:47:11,590 --> 00:47:14,019
something that uh they'll want to

1597
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:16,389
tell their friends about it's like

1598
00:47:16,659 --> 00:47:18,260
that book uh i think it's the

1599
00:47:18,690 --> 00:47:21,780
purple cow by seth godin and the

1600
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:21,909
whole

1601
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:24,099
concept of the book is like if you

1602
00:47:24,099 --> 00:47:25,869
were to drive by uh like a ranch

1603
00:47:26,170 --> 00:47:28,340
or a farm and you saw a purple cow

1604
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:30,780
like you'd go and tell all your

1605
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:32,530
friends you'd take pictures of it

1606
00:47:32,639 --> 00:47:34,320
and tell everyone about it because

1607
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,409
it's you've never seen anything

1608
00:47:36,409 --> 00:47:38,280
like it before and so that's the

1609
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,340
experience that's the vibe you

1610
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:40,420
want

1611
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:42,849
to create with your service is be

1612
00:47:43,059 --> 00:47:44,360
the purple cow um i completely

1613
00:47:45,099 --> 00:47:47,380
oversimplified it but as connor

1614
00:47:47,429 --> 00:47:47,530
mentioned

1615
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:49,579
or yeah connor uh it's a great

1616
00:47:49,579 --> 00:47:51,130
book and a great lesson

1617
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:56,409

1623
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:06,099
days is when the

1624
00:48:06,159 --> 00:48:09,050
client is like most invested yeah

1625
00:48:09,050 --> 00:48:11,550
so like deliver some quick win

1626
00:48:11,550 --> 00:48:15,139
during those yeah first week 100

1627
00:48:15,239 --> 00:48:15,619
so we've

1628
00:48:15,679 --> 00:48:18,320
done uh some calls on onboarding

1629
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:20,619
so so there's i break it into

1630
00:48:20,949 --> 00:48:22,730
onboarding which is really like

1631
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:23,300
the first

1632
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:25,650
seven days or even the first 24

1633
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:27,409
hours um and then ongoing client

1634
00:48:28,190 --> 00:48:30,070
management so this is after the

1635
00:48:30,159 --> 00:48:31,900
onboarding process now that you

1636
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:33,289
have the client how do you

1637
00:48:33,289 --> 00:48:35,719
ongoingly manage and and wow them

1638
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:36,880
uh for the

1639
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:38,969
for the onboarding stuff uh i

1640
00:48:38,969 --> 00:48:40,829
would recommend the client

1641
00:48:40,829 --> 00:48:43,130
retention master class we talk a

1642
00:48:43,130 --> 00:48:43,699
lot about

1643
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:45,309
onboarding in there and then in

1644
00:48:45,309 --> 00:48:46,920
that same module in the course i

1645
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:48,659
think there's two or three videos

1646
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:50,849
in regards to onboarding

1647
00:48:50,849 --> 00:48:52,809
specifically so go through those

1648
00:48:52,809 --> 00:48:55,460
and then on the next call and you

1649
00:48:55,460 --> 00:48:55,769
can talk

1650
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:57,199
about this in your action items

1651
00:48:57,199 --> 00:48:58,670
when you post them in slack after

1652
00:48:58,670 --> 00:49:00,179
but on the next call we could go

1653
00:49:00,239 --> 00:49:02,119
through what you've come up with

1654
00:49:02,119 --> 00:49:04,119
for the onboarding process but 100

1655
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:06,570
for mosey says seven days i say

1656
00:49:06,639 --> 00:49:08,679
honestly 24 hours uh is when you

1657
00:49:08,679 --> 00:49:10,519
win or lose a client um and we

1658
00:49:10,519 --> 00:49:12,989
talk about it in in the content

1659
00:49:12,989 --> 00:49:13,690
that i

1660
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:17,130
mentioned i think brooke uh you

1661
00:49:17,130 --> 00:49:20,639
have your hand raised so yeah um

1662
00:49:20,869 --> 00:49:23,699
with our clients like we kind

1663
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:25,469
of we don't have a set process we

1664
00:49:25,469 --> 00:49:27,170
offer a few different services we

1665
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:28,739
do like google ads facebook

1666
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,559
ads and cro are the main three um

1667
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:32,309
so what we need from the client

1668
00:49:32,309 --> 00:49:33,840
varies depending on their

1669
00:49:34,070 --> 00:49:34,380
situation

1670
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:35,679
like if they they have like a

1671
00:49:35,679 --> 00:49:37,199
shitty website we'll start with

1672
00:49:37,199 --> 00:49:38,250
cro if they have like

1673
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:40,159
uh terrible google ads but a great

1674
00:49:40,159 --> 00:49:41,449
website we'll start with google

1675
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:42,679
ads um so i'm finding

1676
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:44,989
like with clients i've had so far

1677
00:49:44,989 --> 00:49:46,489
i've only had still like a new

1678
00:49:46,489 --> 00:49:48,219
agency i've had three i'm finding

1679
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:50,420
like i'm constantly bugging them

1680
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:52,500
for access to stuff like can i get

1681
00:49:52,929 --> 00:49:54,579
access to this xyz and then two

1682
00:49:54,639 --> 00:49:56,869
days later oh i need xyz as well

1683
00:49:57,150 --> 00:49:59,269
you know what i mean yeah so like

1684
00:49:59,449 --> 00:50:01,360
my my thinking was like is it

1685
00:50:01,519 --> 00:50:03,420
would it be a bad idea to ask them

1686
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:05,289
to just create me an email like

1687
00:50:05,289 --> 00:50:06,820
for example i've had to ask them

1688
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:06,980
to

1689
00:50:07,039 --> 00:50:08,369
create like four ad accounts where

1690
00:50:08,369 --> 00:50:09,539
if they just made me an email at

1691
00:50:09,619 --> 00:50:10,679
their company i could make

1692
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,610
everything for them yes so i

1693
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:15,840
remember uh tyler who was one of

1694
00:50:16,070 --> 00:50:19,139
like our very first students in

1695
00:50:19,139 --> 00:50:19,300
the

1696
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:21,110
program he asked me like basically

1697
00:50:21,110 --> 00:50:22,860
the same exact question and i said

1698
00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:24,210
don't stress about it in the

1699
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:26,139
beginning because it's not really

1700
00:50:26,139 --> 00:50:27,820
going to happen with your first

1701
00:50:27,820 --> 00:50:29,900
few clients but make sure to point

1702
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:30,159
out

1703
00:50:30,239 --> 00:50:32,110
and keep a list of all the things

1704
00:50:32,110 --> 00:50:34,030
that you eventually end up asking

1705
00:50:34,579 --> 00:50:36,570
your clients for and then ask it

1706
00:50:36,739 --> 00:50:36,739
in the

1707
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:38,179
onboarding form so you never

1708
00:50:38,179 --> 00:50:39,690
forget and you never have to ask

1709
00:50:39,699 --> 00:50:43,139
um so all these things that you've

1710
00:50:43,199 --> 00:50:44,840
come across that you need access

1711
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:46,599
to like their ad accounts or their

1712
00:50:46,599 --> 00:50:48,340
their uh social media whatever

1713
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:51,050
ask that in the onboarding form uh

1714
00:50:51,050 --> 00:50:53,860
and if you've made the observation

1715
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:55,619
that it'd be a lot easier if

1716
00:50:55,679 --> 00:50:57,159
they were to create me an email

1717
00:50:57,159 --> 00:50:58,539
account add that into your

1718
00:50:58,539 --> 00:51:00,340
onboarding process the first thing

1719
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:00,659
they do

1720
00:51:00,719 --> 00:51:02,449
after signing is they add you to

1721
00:51:02,449 --> 00:51:04,159
their g suite as a user and they

1722
00:51:04,159 --> 00:51:06,019
send you the credentials so you

1723
00:51:06,019 --> 00:51:06,659
could

1724
00:51:06,719 --> 00:51:08,340
start right away all right so like

1725
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:09,780
you made the observation you

1726
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:11,380
already did the first part now

1727
00:51:11,539 --> 00:51:11,579
just

1728
00:51:11,679 --> 00:51:13,619
implement it whether it be they

1729
00:51:13,619 --> 00:51:15,469
set up an account for you or you

1730
00:51:15,519 --> 00:51:17,699
just ask for all the credentials

1731
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:19,849
in the onboarding form that makes

1732
00:51:20,239 --> 00:51:21,820
sense another thing you might not

1733
00:51:22,369 --> 00:51:23,860
have a direct experience with this

1734
00:51:23,860 --> 00:51:24,019
but

1735
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:26,280
um if i want them to install like

1736
00:51:26,630 --> 00:51:28,619
shopify apps and i want to pay for

1737
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:30,340
the apps for them like just as

1738
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:30,340
part

1739
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:32,360
of our service is there like an

1740
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:34,039
easy way to do that without

1741
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:36,239
because right now i'm having to

1742
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:36,659
say like

1743
00:51:36,719 --> 00:51:38,230
like if i'm not on the store back

1744
00:51:38,230 --> 00:51:39,610
end like if i'm just like a an

1745
00:51:39,610 --> 00:51:41,699
agency partner they have to go and

1746
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:43,050
install it and pay for it on their

1747
00:51:43,050 --> 00:51:44,150
card and then i absolutely

1748
00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:45,530
essentially reimburse them but

1749
00:51:46,159 --> 00:51:47,519
it just doesn't seem like a great

1750
00:51:47,519 --> 00:51:49,219
experience from their perspective

1751
00:51:49,219 --> 00:51:53,139
yeah that's interesting um again

1752
00:51:53,199 --> 00:51:55,280
if you could get the login and do

1753
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:57,489
that on your own i'd recommend it

1754
00:51:57,809 --> 00:51:59,530
what we did we encounter something

1755
00:51:59,679 --> 00:52:01,789
similar uh because we would set up

1756
00:52:01,789 --> 00:52:03,739
calendly accounts or we would we

1757
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:05,699
would need them to upgrade their

1758
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:06,949
calendly a lot of clients we

1759
00:52:06,949 --> 00:52:08,269
worked with didn't have like

1760
00:52:08,340 --> 00:52:09,760
premium calendly which means we

1761
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:10,500
couldn't set

1762
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:12,179
up like zapier and so we'd say hey

1763
00:52:12,179 --> 00:52:14,010
like can you upgrade your calendly

1764
00:52:14,010 --> 00:52:15,369
and what we would do is just

1765
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:18,090
add our card to the account um and

1766
00:52:18,090 --> 00:52:20,480
the way i did it is i would use a

1767
00:52:20,710 --> 00:52:22,159
virtual card there's like a

1768
00:52:22,239 --> 00:52:24,690
website called privacy.com and you

1769
00:52:24,820 --> 00:52:26,750
can basically create a card for

1770
00:52:26,860 --> 00:52:28,340
every client and so it makes

1771
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:30,150
it really easy to track expenses

1772
00:52:30,150 --> 00:52:31,619
uh for each client account

1773
00:52:31,619 --> 00:52:33,539
essentially and you could set like

1774
00:52:33,670 --> 00:52:33,860
daily

1775
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:35,610
limits and you could limit it to

1776
00:52:35,610 --> 00:52:37,440
only be used on certain websites

1777
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:38,960
so that gets rid of like the

1778
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:40,730
security risk of like i don't want

1779
00:52:40,730 --> 00:52:42,400
to have my card on someone else's

1780
00:52:42,409 --> 00:52:44,590
account but that would probably

1781
00:52:44,719 --> 00:52:46,760
be the easiest way is to get the

1782
00:52:47,179 --> 00:52:48,690
login and have a privacy or a

1783
00:52:48,690 --> 00:52:50,820
virtual card created specifically

1784
00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:50,980
for

1785
00:52:51,039 --> 00:52:52,559
that client account yeah i

1786
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:54,469
actually use jeeves it's a it's a

1787
00:52:54,469 --> 00:52:56,619
credit card platform and it allows

1788
00:52:56,719 --> 00:52:57,650
you to do that like create

1789
00:52:57,650 --> 00:52:59,090
unlimited virtual cards connected

1790
00:52:59,179 --> 00:53:00,360
to the same parent card so that

1791
00:53:00,409 --> 00:53:00,519
that

1792
00:53:00,639 --> 00:53:02,710
should actually work perfect okay

1793
00:53:02,710 --> 00:53:04,519
sick yeah let me know on that uh a

1794
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:06,409
lot of the stuff you have to

1795
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:09,030
test it because it's your process

1796
00:53:09,030 --> 00:53:10,769
it's your business and then get

1797
00:53:10,769 --> 00:53:12,050
back to me on whether or

1798
00:53:12,159 --> 00:53:13,420
not it was successful and we could

1799
00:53:13,420 --> 00:53:14,599
just continue to work through

1800
00:53:14,739 --> 00:53:16,900
potential solutions that's the

1801
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:16,980
thing

1802
00:53:17,039 --> 00:53:18,800
with operations it's not like an

1803
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:20,610
instant like oh yeah do this it's

1804
00:53:20,610 --> 00:53:22,420
like maybe do this try it and and

1805
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:23,900
maybe it'll work and then even if

1806
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:25,260
you think on it for a little bit

1807
00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:26,739
longer more ideas will start to

1808
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:28,639
come to you another one is uh i

1809
00:53:28,639 --> 00:53:30,670
worked for an agency and we had a

1810
00:53:30,860 --> 00:53:32,500
va who just had access to the

1811
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:32,820
company

1812
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:35,070
card and knew like everything that

1813
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:36,940
was in the air quotes starter pack

1814
00:53:37,469 --> 00:53:39,210
and so she would just like

1815
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:40,349
set up the zoom set up the

1816
00:53:40,349 --> 00:53:41,940
calendly set up the gmail and then

1817
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:43,539
hand it all over as a package with

1818
00:53:43,539 --> 00:53:43,619
the

1819
00:53:43,679 --> 00:53:45,289
the right memberships for each

1820
00:53:45,289 --> 00:53:46,929
like thing over to the person so

1821
00:53:47,039 --> 00:53:48,659
they just all have it all in one

1822
00:53:48,719 --> 00:53:50,889
go obviously that took a few like

1823
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:53,110
clients to learn but yeah that's

1824
00:53:53,340 --> 00:53:55,079
that'd be ideal just like one one

1825
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:57,360
here you go and be able to pay for

1826
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:59,239
and stuff yeah yeah yeah and again

1827
00:53:59,550 --> 00:54:01,619
the virtual card aspect is so

1828
00:54:01,679 --> 00:54:03,369
key because i wouldn't want to

1829
00:54:03,369 --> 00:54:05,260
give like my amex to va no offense

1830
00:54:05,260 --> 00:54:07,139
but like that's definitely a

1831
00:54:07,139 --> 00:54:07,699
security

1832
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:09,750
risk uh because there's no like

1833
00:54:09,750 --> 00:54:11,639
limit on that car but if i could

1834
00:54:12,369 --> 00:54:14,659
do like a a privacy card and set

1835
00:54:14,719 --> 00:54:16,550
the limit to like 100 bucks a day

1836
00:54:16,550 --> 00:54:18,550
like if i'm you know on vacation

1837
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:21,380
for three days the worst that

1838
00:54:21,380 --> 00:54:21,440
could

1839
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:23,940
happen is 300 in expenses like

1840
00:54:24,179 --> 00:54:26,119
that gives me peace of mind i've

1841
00:54:26,219 --> 00:54:28,650
never heard of that that's fire

1842
00:54:29,780 --> 00:54:30,320
yeah it's sick

1843
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:35,159
what else questions you know on

1844
00:54:35,699 --> 00:54:37,860
privacy are you just using the uh

1845
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:40,099
free one or do you got pro or

1846
00:54:40,099 --> 00:54:40,170
teams

1847
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:42,500
i just use the free one but to be

1848
00:54:42,989 --> 00:54:44,590
honest i don't use it as much as i

1849
00:54:44,590 --> 00:54:46,820
used to it looks like uh broke

1850
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:49,159
you shared an alternative solution

1851
00:54:49,460 --> 00:54:51,500
which looks interesting right yeah

1852
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:53,139
i'm looking into this right

1853
00:54:53,199 --> 00:54:55,329
now because especially if i'm a

1854
00:54:55,329 --> 00:54:57,940
buy domains with a va yeah to be

1855
00:54:58,469 --> 00:55:01,030
honest i use uh mercury has

1856
00:55:01,449 --> 00:55:01,539
virtual

1857
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:03,179
cards you can create unlimited

1858
00:55:03,179 --> 00:55:04,849
virtual cards in mercury and set

1859
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:06,340
limits do the same exact thing

1860
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:09,289
um in there so that's also another

1861
00:55:09,289 --> 00:55:11,750
solution just set a limit for like

1862
00:55:11,750 --> 00:55:13,449
100 bucks a day or something

1863
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:16,199
yeah exactly and name the card

1864
00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:19,780
like jeez we expenses and then

1865
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:20,659
that's how you know like that

1866
00:55:20,719 --> 00:55:22,550
card is just for google domains or

1867
00:55:23,139 --> 00:55:25,929
whatever yeah makes sense yeah i'm

1868
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:27,079
getting to the exciting

1869
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:30,849
point where i can take myself out

1870
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:33,599
of stuff you know so it's a big

1871
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:36,579
step for me at least it feels

1872
00:55:36,639 --> 00:55:38,659
feels like one yeah it's a big

1873
00:55:38,659 --> 00:55:40,429
step uh it's not gonna happen

1874
00:55:41,260 --> 00:55:42,989
overnight i'm still in that phase

1875
00:55:42,989 --> 00:55:44,659
uh and i

1876
00:55:44,719 --> 00:55:46,380
think i will be for a long time

1877
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:48,320
it's just a continued process um

1878
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:50,280
of backing yourself out of certain

1879
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:50,980
things that

1880
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:53,630
you've already mastered or or have

1881
00:55:54,230 --> 00:55:55,400
processes in place where someone

1882
00:55:55,460 --> 00:55:57,219
can come in and do it effectively

1883
00:55:57,219 --> 00:55:57,530
so

1884
00:55:58,239 --> 00:56:01,860
yeah it's a good good spot to be

1885
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:01,860
in

1886
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:05,139
any last questions or things that

1887
00:56:05,139 --> 00:56:06,769
i can help with based on what you

1888
00:56:07,090 --> 00:56:07,460
heard today

1889
00:56:07,519 --> 00:56:11,320
should be a lot of action items

1890
00:56:11,769 --> 00:56:13,539
i'd imagine

1891
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:17,150
simply go in and send a check-in

1892
00:56:17,150 --> 00:56:18,409
message to your client

1893
00:56:21,059 --> 00:56:24,820
what else

1894
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:29,110
was this valuable are these

1895
00:56:30,110 --> 00:56:33,000
formatted calls where there's more

1896
00:56:33,530 --> 00:56:34,500
structure and not just

1897
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:36,980
open-ended q a for the whole time

1898
00:56:37,139 --> 00:56:39,019
are those valuable it's not going

1899
00:56:39,110 --> 00:56:39,380
to be a

1900
00:56:40,070 --> 00:56:41,320
a permanent thing but if i have

1901
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:43,090
something shared that week all is

1902
00:56:43,099 --> 00:56:44,739
worth doing this way

1903
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:49,269
yeah this is solid yeah i really

1904
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:49,539
like

1905
00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:53,389
like not just a and not straight

1906
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:58,570
lecture like combo yeah yeah yeah

1907
00:56:58,679 --> 00:56:59,500
getting some of like your

1908
00:56:59,679 --> 00:57:00,710
your like going through the

1909
00:57:00,710 --> 00:57:01,989
document and hearing something

1910
00:57:02,179 --> 00:57:03,139
like your thoughts or best

1911
00:57:03,139 --> 00:57:03,739
practices like

1912
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:05,969
inspire so many other questions

1913
00:57:05,969 --> 00:57:07,429
that we wouldn't have thought of

1914
00:57:07,429 --> 00:57:08,179
in an open q a so

1915
00:57:08,239 --> 00:57:11,139
helps that's what i feel too yeah

1916
00:57:11,139 --> 00:57:12,699
and again like i literally just

1917
00:57:12,860 --> 00:57:13,789
typed this document up

1918
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:15,929
this morning and so i did not

1919
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:18,980
realize there's 45 minutes worth

1920
00:57:19,179 --> 00:57:21,619
of me talking um so what i'll

1921
00:57:22,099 --> 00:57:22,099
focus

1922
00:57:22,159 --> 00:57:23,989
on going forward is just shorter

1923
00:57:23,989 --> 00:57:25,800
uh on the content side so we have

1924
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:27,460
more time for questions and

1925
00:57:27,519 --> 00:57:28,929
can stop in the middle and

1926
00:57:28,929 --> 00:57:30,019
whatever else but

1927
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:32,320
feels like it worked out good we

1928
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:33,760
went the full hour got a lot of

1929
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:35,840
questions out of it um i'm sure
