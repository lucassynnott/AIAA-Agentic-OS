1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:00,740
All right.

2
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:02,580
So in this video, we're going to

3
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:04,269
go over how to customize the

4
00:00:04,469 --> 00:00:07,099
workflows for your

5
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:07,629
snapshot.

6
00:00:07,629 --> 00:00:07,839
Okay.

7
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:09,230
So I wanted to keep this as simple

8
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:10,419
as possible and not overwhelm you

9
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:10,919
guys

10
00:00:10,939 --> 00:00:12,179
with a lot of different workflows

11
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:13,160
and automations.

12
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:14,589
So these two are really the ones

13
00:00:14,589 --> 00:00:16,359
you need when it

14
00:00:16,699 --> 00:00:18,190
comes to starting up your agency

15
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:20,079
and starting to book some calls,

16
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:20,980
some demos.

17
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:22,780
So the first one is

18
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,809
going to be whenever a new lead

19
00:00:23,829 --> 00:00:24,679
comes into the business.

20
00:00:24,789 --> 00:00:25,019
Okay.

21
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,260
Whenever they fill out a survey

22
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:28,079
or a form or something like that.

23
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:28,500
Okay.

24
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,219
So pretty much first thing I want

25
00:00:30,219 --> 00:00:31,960
to do is filter out the

26
00:00:32,548 --> 00:00:32,880
triggers.

27
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:33,380
Okay.

28
00:00:33,429 --> 00:00:35,329
So let me first explain how an

29
00:00:35,329 --> 00:00:37,439
automation or a workflow is going

30
00:00:37,549 --> 00:00:38,079
to set up,

31
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,320
and then we'll go into how to edit

32
00:00:39,729 --> 00:00:39,979
everything.

33
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:41,380
So obviously there needs to be a

34
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:43,030
trigger to start off

35
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:44,219
the workflow.

36
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:44,780
Okay.

37
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:47,020
And once a trigger is triggered,

38
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:48,799
then everything will go into

39
00:00:49,229 --> 00:00:49,630
place.

40
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:51,219
So first thing

41
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,479
you got to look at is the trigger

42
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:53,250
you're using.

43
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:54,740
So I added two, the form submitted

44
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:55,490
and the survey

45
00:00:55,829 --> 00:00:56,759
submit it because there'll be

46
00:00:57,149 --> 00:00:58,109
different ways you guys are

47
00:00:58,109 --> 00:00:59,159
bringing in leads.

48
00:00:59,159 --> 00:00:59,770
Okay.

49
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:01,200
But this may need

50
00:01:01,299 --> 00:01:02,539
to be duplicated or changed

51
00:01:02,939 --> 00:01:04,519
depending on what type of assets

52
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:06,000
you guys are giving out.

53
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,780
So here,

54
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:09,010
survey submitted, you want to make

55
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:10,480
sure you select the right survey.

56
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,099
Okay.

57
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:13,260
Or if you know for a fact,

58
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,049
you don't need to filter it, you

59
00:01:15,049 --> 00:01:16,579
could remove this filter.

60
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:18,209
And every single time someone

61
00:01:18,379 --> 00:01:19,239
submits a survey,

62
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:20,659
they'll get added into this

63
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:21,579
workflow.

64
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,090
Okay.

65
00:01:22,099 --> 00:01:24,540
Same thing with forms, right?

66
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:25,930
Let's make sure you choose

67
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,909
the right form and, and you make

68
00:01:27,909 --> 00:01:29,659
sure you get the right leads in

69
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,150
here.

70
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:31,659
If you want to add any new

71
00:01:32,069 --> 00:01:33,680
triggers, there's like, honestly,

72
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,379
a lot of triggers, adding a tag,

73
00:01:35,379 --> 00:01:36,939
note added, you know, it's a

74
00:01:36,939 --> 00:01:37,359
birthday

75
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:38,620
coming up, call status, depending

76
00:01:39,019 --> 00:01:39,849
on the call status.

77
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:40,959
There's so many things.

78
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:42,219
So I highly recommend you guys

79
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:43,489
look at this, but don't get

80
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:45,349
overwhelmed with all the things

81
00:01:45,349 --> 00:01:46,180
you could do.

82
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:46,719
Okay.

83
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:47,510
Just keep it as simple

84
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,250
as possible, at least for now.

85
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:50,849
Now, once someone submits the

86
00:01:50,849 --> 00:01:52,430
form, we get an opportunity.

87
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,239
If you

88
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,709
edit the pipeline or if you edited

89
00:01:55,709 --> 00:01:58,189
the pipeline, make sure to update

90
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:00,599
this as needed, because this,

91
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,760
for example, if you change this,

92
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,840
it'll most likely be removed.

93
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,719
So you need to fill this out

94
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:03,920
again.

95
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:04,750
Okay.

96
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,459
You can also here select the

97
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,710
status, the value of opportunity

98
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:09,780
immediately.

99
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:10,960
So if I put 4,500,

100
00:02:11,259 --> 00:02:12,650
every new opportunity that comes

101
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:14,210
in and every new lead that comes

102
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:15,909
in, their opportunity will have

103
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:16,680
the value.

104
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,099
Okay.

105
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:18,120
That I put in here.

106
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,770
Another thing you could do, how I

107
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:21,240
showed you with custom values

108
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:22,479
before is you can create a custom

109
00:02:22,849 --> 00:02:24,159
value for the opportunity value.

110
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:25,639
So in case it's always changing,

111
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:27,000
instead of having to come in here

112
00:02:27,289 --> 00:02:28,759
and change the workflow itself,

113
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:31,340
you could select a custom value

114
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:33,210
that you've created before.

115
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:35,280
Now this point, it'll be empty,

116
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,580
but pretty much you could select

117
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:37,909
any custom

118
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:39,280
values you have, or depending on

119
00:02:39,349 --> 00:02:40,490
the content, you could fill

120
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:42,039
content specific custom fields.

121
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:43,159
Okay.

122
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:45,060
Now, once they opt in, you're

123
00:02:45,169 --> 00:02:47,110
going to get the training access

124
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:50,259
email or, you know, whatever the

125
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:51,840
thing you're going to provide a

126
00:02:51,939 --> 00:02:53,599
PDF access, you know, whatever it

127
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:53,939
is.

128
00:02:53,939 --> 00:02:55,229
Location name is pretty much

129
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,930
your agency name is with the name

130
00:02:56,979 --> 00:02:58,360
of the sub account itself.

131
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:00,039
Location email is going to be the

132
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:00,210
email

133
00:03:00,259 --> 00:03:02,409
you use to create the sub account

134
00:03:02,409 --> 00:03:04,080
and the subject line.

135
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,780
Self-explanatory is the subject

136
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:06,069
line of the

137
00:03:06,509 --> 00:03:06,729
email.

138
00:03:06,729 --> 00:03:08,669
Now here it says, hi, contact

139
00:03:08,669 --> 00:03:09,169
name.

140
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,909
This is user first name with

141
00:03:10,909 --> 00:03:11,840
location name.

142
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:12,699
So this will

143
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:14,639
translate to, let's say the lead

144
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:16,120
that comes in is named John.

145
00:03:16,259 --> 00:03:18,090
Hey, John, this is, my name is

146
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:18,500
Penry

147
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:20,409
with, you know, client ascension,

148
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:21,900
for example, or go high level,

149
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:23,780
whatever the name of the business

150
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:24,080
is.

151
00:03:25,099 --> 00:03:27,439
So the, the copy here, the email

152
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:29,560
here says good call on getting

153
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,780
access to our topic

154
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:32,099
training or topic PDF.

155
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:33,560
So you want to, you want to change

156
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,180
this out in case you didn't watch

157
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:35,870
it or you

158
00:03:36,289 --> 00:03:39,710
going to receive it or, you know,

159
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:41,580
whatever it is.

160
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,729
Um, so actually let me, looks like

161
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:44,780
this is

162
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,520
duplicated.

163
00:03:45,669 --> 00:03:46,009
My bad.

164
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:47,479
In case you didn't watch it,

165
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:48,860
here's the link, right?

166
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:50,069
So you provide the link.

167
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:52,229
If you have any questions about

168
00:03:52,229 --> 00:03:54,699
how to, you know, get more quality

169
00:03:54,699 --> 00:03:57,039
leads, book more calls, get more

170
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,169
sales, improve your closure, you

171
00:03:58,169 --> 00:03:58,939
know, whatever it is.

172
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:00,020
If you respond to this email, I'll

173
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:00,620
get back to

174
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:01,520
you all the best username.

175
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,460
So this will be your name.

176
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:03,780
All right.

177
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:06,319
Now training access SMS, same,

178
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:06,780
same

179
00:04:07,189 --> 00:04:07,520
idea.

180
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,669
Um, pretty much say, Hey, John,

181
00:04:10,669 --> 00:04:13,819
this is Henry with business name.

182
00:04:13,819 --> 00:04:14,960
Just, just saw you got access

183
00:04:14,979 --> 00:04:16,189
to our topic training.

184
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:17,529
Let me know if there's any

185
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:19,120
questions I can answer on how to

186
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,139
achieve outcomes,

187
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,509
same ideas above on how to get

188
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,160
more leads on how to increase

189
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,430
your, your close rate on how to do

190
00:04:25,949 --> 00:04:27,060
whatever you provide.

191
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:27,649
Okay.

192
00:04:27,649 --> 00:04:29,439
Then here we're waiting for a

193
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:30,050
reply.

194
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:30,490
Okay.

195
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:31,819
What this means is

196
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:33,079
that the system is going to wait

197
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:34,730
one hour, see if they respond to

198
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:35,139
your SMS.

199
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:36,519
If they don't respond to

200
00:04:36,819 --> 00:04:38,689
your SMS, they're going to follow

201
00:04:38,689 --> 00:04:40,800
up, um, a day later, or sorry, an

202
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:41,810
hour later.

203
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:42,939
It's going to say,

204
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:44,620
what do you think of the training?

205
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,120
Think it's worth a quick convo or

206
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,459
is outcome not really a priority

207
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:48,170
right now?

208
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:48,620
Okay.

209
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,370
So here, let's say you offering

210
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:52,170
more leads and let's say the, the

211
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:53,160
outcome they want

212
00:04:53,709 --> 00:04:54,860
release to grow their business or

213
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:56,069
scaling their business.

214
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,839
So think it's worth a quick convo

215
00:04:57,899 --> 00:04:58,120
or

216
00:04:58,139 --> 00:04:59,350
is growing the business, not

217
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:00,689
really a priority right now.

218
00:05:00,689 --> 00:05:01,100
Okay.

219
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,779
Then same thing, wait two days.

220
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,680
We see if they responded to the

221
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:06,269
SMS.

222
00:05:06,269 --> 00:05:06,810
Okay.

223
00:05:06,819 --> 00:05:08,529
And second follow-up.

224
00:05:08,529 --> 00:05:10,279
I don't know, just to check in

225
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:10,459
here,

226
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,189
are you still looking to get more

227
00:05:12,189 --> 00:05:13,730
leads or better leads for the

228
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,410
business, which has helped a

229
00:05:15,579 --> 00:05:16,839
client,

230
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,600
a client in, you know, location

231
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,050
could be Miami, you know,

232
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:21,790
California, whatever it is,

233
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,069
get result in timeframe with

234
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:24,569
something like that'd be a worth a

235
00:05:24,569 --> 00:05:25,160
quick chat.

236
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:25,500
Okay.

237
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:25,980
So you're just trying

238
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,879
to get them back into, you know,

239
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:29,480
your loop to talk to you and

240
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,519
ideally book them in for a demo.

241
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:33,759
Now you could edit any part of

242
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,269
this workflow.

243
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:35,980
Okay.

244
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:38,490
So if you want to change the wait

245
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:39,149
time,

246
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,339
you can just change here to two

247
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:41,709
hours or three hours or five days,

248
00:05:41,709 --> 00:05:42,660
whatever you want.

249
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:44,790
And this thing right here is

250
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:46,259
called an if else step.

251
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:46,759
Okay.

252
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:47,819
Or condition step.

253
00:05:47,819 --> 00:05:49,970
So pretty much you want to ask

254
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,670
if something happened.

255
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:53,579
So here we do contact reply.

256
00:05:53,579 --> 00:05:55,649
That's the action we're looking

257
00:05:55,649 --> 00:05:56,120
to.

258
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:56,569
And it's either

259
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,399
true or false.

260
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:57,769
Okay.

261
00:05:57,769 --> 00:05:58,899
If it's true, it means they

262
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,980
responded to the text.

263
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,379
If it's false or, you know,

264
00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:02,990
nothing happened, it means it

265
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:03,980
didn't respond.

266
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,649
So if it's true, nothing's going

267
00:06:05,819 --> 00:06:06,269
to happen.

268
00:06:06,509 --> 00:06:07,079
You could add more

269
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,160
steps in here if you want.

270
00:06:09,269 --> 00:06:09,860
Okay.

271
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:12,209
So you could automatically say,

272
00:06:12,389 --> 00:06:13,920
cool, here's my booking link.

273
00:06:13,939 --> 00:06:14,540
Talk about it.

274
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,600
I don't recommend you do that

275
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,889
because it's going to be different

276
00:06:16,889 --> 00:06:17,620
responses with

277
00:06:18,029 --> 00:06:19,399
different contexts to each one.

278
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:20,800
So you can maybe leverage AI

279
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,100
because here we have AI booking

280
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:23,319
bot

281
00:06:23,579 --> 00:06:24,209
or chat GPT.

282
00:06:24,209 --> 00:06:25,459
You could connect it in here,

283
00:06:25,569 --> 00:06:27,829
which is pretty cool, but I want

284
00:06:28,009 --> 00:06:30,660
to keep it simple for now.

285
00:06:30,699 --> 00:06:31,600
Same thing here.

286
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,810
You could change this.

287
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:34,300
And this is pretty much the same

288
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,180
step as above.

289
00:06:35,259 --> 00:06:36,199
All right.

290
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:42,579
So let's go back to the workflows.

291
00:06:42,579 --> 00:06:45,250
And then we have the demo booked

292
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,959
or sales call booked workflow.

293
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:49,060
So here we have, I have two

294
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:49,949
triggers.

295
00:06:49,949 --> 00:06:52,250
One, one at the lead themselves,

296
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:53,079
book a demo.

297
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:58,779
And whenever you or someone in

298
00:06:58,779 --> 00:07:01,259
your team books a demo manually.

299
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:02,199
Okay.

300
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:05,069
So the way this works

301
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,829
is, let me just check something

302
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:08,620
here.

303
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,939
We'll just make sure we have the

304
00:07:12,089 --> 00:07:13,430
right one.

305
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:14,319
Yeah.

306
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:15,410
Perfect.

307
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:16,250
So

308
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:18,180
as soon as someone books a demo is

309
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,740
going to be assigned to, to you

310
00:07:19,889 --> 00:07:20,620
ideally.

311
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:21,639
So here is you're

312
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,879
going to have a random number or

313
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:26,589
code just to make up for my, uh,

314
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:27,250
contacts.

315
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:28,139
I'm not going to be in

316
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:28,879
your account.

317
00:07:29,009 --> 00:07:30,490
So it's going to remove that, just

318
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:32,000
X out and select your own name.

319
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:34,079
And here we're going to add a tag

320
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:36,160
called demo call that we can tag

321
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,180
people whenever they book,

322
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:40,009
we can separate them or segment

323
00:07:40,009 --> 00:07:41,759
them for emails and stuff like

324
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:42,319
that.

325
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,180
The opportunity is going to be

326
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:44,750
updated.

327
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,279
As you can see, it's going to move

328
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:47,519
to the demo booked stage.

329
00:07:48,029 --> 00:07:51,209
And then here, I like to filter

330
00:07:51,209 --> 00:07:53,319
out by booking method in case in

331
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:54,720
the future, we need to do

332
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:55,199
different

333
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:56,319
things, depending on how the

334
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:57,579
prospect came in, in case we send

335
00:07:57,579 --> 00:08:00,019
different things, uh, depending on

336
00:08:00,019 --> 00:08:00,089
the

337
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:00,420
source.

338
00:08:00,509 --> 00:08:00,839
Right.

339
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:03,160
But here we wait one minute and

340
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,689
here we send the confirmation

341
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:06,639
text.

342
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:07,680
Hey, I have you booked for this

343
00:08:07,699 --> 00:08:08,100
date of time.

344
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,370
Reply yes to confirm confirmation

345
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:11,259
email.

346
00:08:11,259 --> 00:08:12,300
Okay.

347
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,939
And then we'll wait for business

348
00:08:13,939 --> 00:08:14,269
hours.

349
00:08:14,779 --> 00:08:15,100
Okay.

350
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,620
We want to make sure we continue

351
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,040
to send them texts or emails

352
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,329
during business hours.

353
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:21,769
So the way to do that is we pretty

354
00:08:21,769 --> 00:08:23,839
much put a time delay advanced

355
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:24,589
window.

356
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:25,879
We select the business

357
00:08:25,899 --> 00:08:27,560
hour days, 8 AM to 8 PM.

358
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,389
And that's it.

359
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:30,079
You don't have to, you can remove

360
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:31,060
this if you want.

361
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:31,579
I prefer

362
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:32,879
to keep it at business hours.

363
00:08:33,288 --> 00:08:33,740
Okay.

364
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:34,769
Then you want to wait four hours

365
00:08:34,769 --> 00:08:35,918
and we ask, did they confirm the

366
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:37,230
appointment or no?

367
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:37,668
Okay.

368
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,298
If there was no response to our

369
00:08:39,298 --> 00:08:40,570
confirmation text.

370
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:41,220
Okay.

371
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,360
So as you can see,

372
00:08:42,379 --> 00:08:44,529
the wait is for a contact reply.

373
00:08:44,529 --> 00:08:45,070
Okay.

374
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:47,009
There's many things you could

375
00:08:47,009 --> 00:08:47,649
choose.

376
00:08:47,769 --> 00:08:49,379
I choose, I chose contact

377
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:50,029
reply.

378
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:52,259
And then we have SMS appointment

379
00:08:52,259 --> 00:08:54,559
reserve, which is the, the text

380
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:55,080
name.

381
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:56,500
And we wait four hours.

382
00:08:56,639 --> 00:08:57,080
Okay.

383
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,789
You could keep it at one or two up

384
00:08:58,789 --> 00:08:59,370
to you.

385
00:08:59,379 --> 00:09:02,799
And here we're going to ask, did

386
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:04,799
they reply true or false?

387
00:09:05,539 --> 00:09:05,919
Okay.

388
00:09:05,929 --> 00:09:08,820
If they replied, then awesome.

389
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:11,220
The appointment is confirmed and

390
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,100
we'll go into the,

391
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,860
you know, the fault, the

392
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:15,830
reminders.

393
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:16,389
Okay.

394
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,330
If they don't confirm, we're going

395
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:19,100
to send another text.

396
00:09:19,139 --> 00:09:20,299
Just let them know, Hey, need to

397
00:09:20,299 --> 00:09:21,330
confirm that you can make our

398
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:23,000
appointment on date and time.

399
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:24,269
Please reply yes to confirm.

400
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:24,799
Okay.

401
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:26,220
And then once we do that, we're

402
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:28,440
going to wait again and add them

403
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:28,700
to

404
00:09:29,009 --> 00:09:29,960
the next step.

405
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:32,429
Now, what I like to do here is I

406
00:09:32,429 --> 00:09:34,419
always like to ask on the

407
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,500
booking calendar if they're able

408
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:37,639
or willing to invest.

409
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:38,779
Okay.

410
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:41,529
If they say no, then I don't want

411
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,279
to waste my time with them on a

412
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:42,559
call.

413
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:44,580
So this step automatically filters

414
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:45,799
those people out and just

415
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,169
sends them this text thing.

416
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:49,100
Hey, notice, uh, just notice you

417
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,750
put down on with unwilling to

418
00:09:50,929 --> 00:09:51,320
invest or

419
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:53,070
unable to invest on your

420
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:54,250
application.

421
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:56,610
If that's the case, I'll go ahead

422
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:57,879
and cancel the call.

423
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:00,340
Let me know if it was an accident.

424
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:00,740
Okay.

425
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:02,309
That way you don't waste time with

426
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:03,360
people that are not willing

427
00:10:03,379 --> 00:10:05,039
to pay you money for your work.

428
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:06,679
And, and honestly, they don't

429
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:08,590
waste time, uh, any of their, of

430
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:08,840
their

431
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:09,799
time because they're not going to

432
00:10:09,799 --> 00:10:10,730
get anything out of the call with

433
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:11,000
you.

434
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,580
Right.

435
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,120
And then wait one day

436
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,870
if they respond and maybe, so if

437
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:16,440
the response is just going to be

438
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,940
like, Hey, yeah, it was an

439
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:18,210
accident

440
00:10:18,259 --> 00:10:19,470
or they may respond.

441
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:20,340
Um, okay.

442
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:20,899
Right.

443
00:10:20,899 --> 00:10:22,860
Whatever it is at that point, you

444
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,419
can just go ahead and cancel

445
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,649
the call yourself.

446
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,710
But if they don't respond after

447
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,720
one day, it'll be automatically

448
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:30,740
canceled.

449
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:31,539
Okay.

450
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:31,879
For

451
00:10:31,899 --> 00:10:33,100
you from here.

452
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:33,710
Okay.

453
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:35,700
We're going to wait two days

454
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,580
before the appointment.

455
00:10:38,009 --> 00:10:38,720
And then we're going to

456
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:39,899
send them a reminder.

457
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:41,559
Hey, just a good reminder for the

458
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:42,379
appointment.

459
00:10:42,379 --> 00:10:43,879
Then we're going to wait until

460
00:10:43,899 --> 00:10:45,490
the day of the appointment.

461
00:10:45,539 --> 00:10:46,960
Then remove the tag for demo

462
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,679
upcoming.

463
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,399
So I like to use these tags to

464
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:49,580
kind

465
00:10:49,659 --> 00:10:50,750
of filter the contact list.

466
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:51,879
I'll show you how to create this

467
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:54,919
in a minute, but that way we can

468
00:10:55,049 --> 00:10:55,320
keep

469
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,519
track of where each lead is at and

470
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:59,590
when you have like appointments

471
00:10:59,769 --> 00:11:01,480
today or upcoming demos, stuff

472
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:01,639
like

473
00:11:01,659 --> 00:11:02,070
that.

474
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:03,539
And we add the demo today tag.

475
00:11:03,649 --> 00:11:04,320
All right.

476
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,909
Then we're going to wait three

477
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:06,590
hours before the

478
00:11:07,009 --> 00:11:07,750
appointment.

479
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:08,320
Okay.

480
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,750
Just remember for a call today.

481
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:13,710
And then five minutes before we're

482
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:14,059
going to send

483
00:11:14,139 --> 00:11:14,779
them the link.

484
00:11:14,779 --> 00:11:15,110
Okay.

485
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:16,179
Actually it says I see you in

486
00:11:16,179 --> 00:11:16,600
five.

487
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,850
Okay.

488
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:21,399
And after one hour, we'll remove

489
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:21,710
the tag

490
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:22,960
that says demo today.

491
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:24,740
And that's pretty much how the

492
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:25,830
workflow works.

493
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:27,419
And it looks complicated.

494
00:11:27,659 --> 00:11:28,379
It really isn't.

495
00:11:28,529 --> 00:11:29,990
It's just a bit overwhelming to

496
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:31,909
see all these, you know, things

497
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:33,159
and connections

498
00:11:33,179 --> 00:11:34,389
or whatever, but it's very simple.

499
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,059
Nothing crazy.

500
00:11:35,169 --> 00:11:36,139
Again, you guys had questions

501
00:11:36,139 --> 00:11:37,080
about how to make some

502
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:37,820
changes to this.

503
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,139
Ask me, I'm more than happy to

504
00:11:39,139 --> 00:11:40,759
help you guys out with this stuff.

505
00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:42,779
Okay.

506
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:43,399
And yeah,

507
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,169
that's it for this one.

508
00:11:45,169 --> 00:11:47,460
But before we leave, let me just

509
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:49,639
show you how to use those, you

510
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:49,950
know,

511
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,470
tags to filter out the leads in

512
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:53,250
the contact section, since I just

513
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:54,200
mentioned it.

514
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,279
So if you go out here to

515
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:58,669
contacts, you could create what's

516
00:11:58,669 --> 00:12:00,340
called smart lists.

517
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:03,580
So here, more filters, you search

518
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:04,120
up tag.

519
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,460
So tag

520
00:12:07,169 --> 00:12:11,029
is demo booked.

521
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:14,279
Should be sorry, demo today.

522
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:18,549
And it looks like it's not really

523
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:23,559
added into this, this account.

524
00:12:23,559 --> 00:12:25,080
So let me just add it for you guys

525
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:27,320
right here.

526
00:12:27,409 --> 00:12:27,720
I don't know why it didn't get

527
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:27,830
added.

528
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:32,120
So new tags in a V demo

529
00:12:32,529 --> 00:12:41,399
coming and demo today.

530
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:49,279
By the way, you could also just

531
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:51,080
create the tags directly in the

532
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:51,559
workflows.

533
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:52,120
You don't need to come

534
00:12:52,149 --> 00:12:53,460
into this page to do that.

535
00:12:53,779 --> 00:12:57,659
I just found it to be easier.

536
00:12:57,659 --> 00:13:00,360
But if you go to contacts, okay,

537
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:00,600
now we

538
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:02,399
have those tags created, you go to

539
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,210
more filters, you click on tag.

540
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:06,840
Here, you search is demo upcoming,

541
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,110
for example, or demo today.

542
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:10,799
You click apply, you can save as a

543
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:11,730
smart list.

544
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,120
So you could just name it upcoming

545
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:16,840
demos.

546
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,289
And whenever you go here and click

547
00:13:19,289 --> 00:13:21,750
here, you'll see any lead that has

548
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:22,830
an upcoming demo with

549
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:23,299
you.

550
00:13:23,299 --> 00:13:25,389
And same thing for demo today.

551
00:13:25,389 --> 00:13:27,080
So if we change this to demo

552
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:27,559
today.

553
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:31,830
Remove this.

554
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:33,879
Save as new.

555
00:13:34,289 --> 00:13:38,039
Today's demos.

556
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:42,039
You could have it right here.

557
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:43,480
So you just quickly see, okay,

558
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,590
what am I talking to

559
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:45,159
today?

560
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:46,840
You got a list who's coming up?

561
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:47,879
You got a list right here.

562
00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:49,080
And again, you can make it even

563
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:49,399
better.

564
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,840
You know, appointment date is

565
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,789
right.

566
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:53,350
So demo upcoming and appointment

567
00:13:53,529 --> 00:13:54,679
date is within three days,

568
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:55,909
like stuff like that.

569
00:13:55,909 --> 00:13:57,330
There's a lot of options for

570
00:13:57,330 --> 00:13:58,429
filtering the leads.

571
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:00,840
I won't go into all of that

572
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:02,379
here because it's just a lot of

573
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:02,889
stuff.

574
00:14:02,889 --> 00:14:04,509
But yeah, this is definitely a

575
00:14:04,509 --> 00:14:05,480
possibility.

576
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:05,960
So that's it for

577
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:06,320
this.

578
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:07,230
