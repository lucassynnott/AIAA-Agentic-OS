1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:01,560
- Yo guys, how's it going?

2
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:03,040
Lucas here, landing page coach at

3
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,120
Client Ascension.

4
00:00:04,219 --> 00:00:05,360
Today I'm gonna be going over

5
00:00:05,379 --> 00:00:06,280
just some of the new templates

6
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:06,879
that I've made.

7
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:08,900
One is in Card and one is in

8
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:09,839
WordPress.

9
00:00:09,859 --> 00:00:11,400
I'm gonna show you how to import

10
00:00:11,419 --> 00:00:13,060
that WordPress template in.

11
00:00:13,099 --> 00:00:15,320
So starting off with Card,

12
00:00:15,339 --> 00:00:17,379
this is an update to the previous

13
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:18,480
landing page I made.

14
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,420
This kind of follows a similar

15
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:21,399
sort of layout.

16
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:22,239
Takes a bit of inspiration

17
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:23,800
from Oliver Kenyon's framework

18
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,670
that he showed us recently on a

19
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:26,239
call.

20
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:27,879
As you can see, it starts off.

21
00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:29,940
All the copy here is just to show

22
00:00:30,089 --> 00:00:31,589
you what to type in there.

23
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:33,679
You throw in your own logo here,

24
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:36,719
your VSL details here,

25
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:39,380
going down, pain point section,

26
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:42,320
benefits, transformation,

27
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:45,350
what's included, about us,

28
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:47,320
testimonials, FAQ,

29
00:00:47,909 --> 00:00:50,520
and book a call, right?

30
00:00:50,539 --> 00:00:51,770
That'll be where you count on the

31
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:52,280
embed is.

32
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:55,000
This is the new WordPress

33
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,280
template.

34
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:59,200
Again, it follows very similar

35
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,909
layout, pain points, benefits,

36
00:01:02,549 --> 00:01:05,170
transformation, features, about

37
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:06,959
us, testimonials, FAQ, right?

38
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:11,319
So we're briefly gonna go over how

39
00:01:11,319 --> 00:01:11,840
to,

40
00:01:11,859 --> 00:01:15,549
how to import this into WordPress.

41
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:17,120
So this was made in Elementor.

42
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:18,760
So you will need Elementor.

43
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:21,760
You may need Elementor Pro.

44
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:22,510
To be honest, I've been using

45
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:23,040
Elementor so long,

46
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:24,700
I'm not entirely sure if you need

47
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:25,519
it or not.

48
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:29,560
I have built out the template,

49
00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:32,439
CSCA landing page one here.

50
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:35,209
And there will be a link to

51
00:01:35,209 --> 00:01:36,430
download the template

52
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:38,349
in the Kajabi here.

53
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:41,390
So with that, you'll get a .json

54
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:42,069
file.

55
00:01:42,099 --> 00:01:43,709
So once you have the file, once

56
00:01:43,709 --> 00:01:44,319
you've downloaded it,

57
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:45,370
I wanna imagine you're in

58
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:45,840
WordPress

59
00:01:45,859 --> 00:01:48,390
and you want to install this

60
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,480
template, right?

61
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,000
You would add a new page.

62
00:01:51,019 --> 00:01:51,859
You would call something like

63
00:01:51,859 --> 00:01:52,109
home.

64
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,400
I'm just gonna call it test.

65
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:56,359
Just publish it.

66
00:01:56,379 --> 00:01:58,719
You would then go to edit with

67
00:01:58,719 --> 00:01:59,390
Elementor.

68
00:01:59,989 --> 00:02:02,439
Here is Elementor, right?

69
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,480
It's a, again, Elementor is a page

70
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,390
building plugin.

71
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:07,000
There is a free version.

72
00:02:07,019 --> 00:02:07,719
This might work with the free

73
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:08,038
version.

74
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:08,840
I'm not entirely sure.

75
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:09,879
You'll have to check that out.

76
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:12,039
If not, I think Elementor Pro is

77
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:12,919
like 60 bucks a year

78
00:02:12,939 --> 00:02:13,560
or something like that.

79
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:15,219
It's not hugely expensive.

80
00:02:15,259 --> 00:02:17,000
When you're here at this page,

81
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:18,449
you just add a new page and open

82
00:02:18,449 --> 00:02:19,240
in Elementor.

83
00:02:19,259 --> 00:02:20,169
You're gonna wanna select the

84
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:22,270
little folder icon here, right?

85
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,800
And this is where they have a list

86
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,129
of their own templates

87
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,439
and pages and things.

88
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:28,169
But you're gonna wanna go to my

89
00:02:28,169 --> 00:02:29,159
templates

90
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:30,919
and then click this little import

91
00:02:30,979 --> 00:02:32,009
template button.

92
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,610
When you do that, your template

93
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:34,520
will appear here.

94
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,710
Once you've got it, you're gonna

95
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:37,479
click insert.

96
00:02:38,069 --> 00:02:39,539
Click apply.

97
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:45,569
And it's gonna import the template

98
00:02:45,569 --> 00:02:47,080
here.

99
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:49,560
Okay, let it reload for a sec.

100
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:55,000
So there we go.

101
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,539
Now you can edit all the elements

102
00:02:56,539 --> 00:02:56,919
of this.

103
00:02:56,939 --> 00:02:58,479
I can do a detailed kind of

104
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:00,759
WordPress editing video,

105
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,120
but I'm gonna assume that you kind

106
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:02,520
of know

107
00:03:02,539 --> 00:03:03,800
the basics of WordPress.

108
00:03:03,819 --> 00:03:04,849
For instance here, I think that

109
00:03:04,849 --> 00:03:05,800
this video is too small.

110
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:07,439
That's because it's got margins on

111
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:08,199
both sides.

112
00:03:08,219 --> 00:03:09,819
So I'm gonna bring these margins

113
00:03:09,819 --> 00:03:10,520
down a bit.

114
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:12,270
There we go.

115
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:12,919
Bigger video.

116
00:03:12,939 --> 00:03:14,919
Make the changes you want in this

117
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:15,469
section here.

118
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,080
This is too high up for instance.

119
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:19,319
It's got a minus 10 margin.

120
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:20,439
So bring it down to zero.

121
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,099
Better.

122
00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:23,419
Make all the changes and things

123
00:03:23,419 --> 00:03:25,150
you want in this section.

124
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,639
Click update.

125
00:03:28,229 --> 00:03:31,349
Top left here.

126
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:32,520
Click exit again.

127
00:03:33,819 --> 00:03:35,530
You can check a few things along

128
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:36,199
the side here.

129
00:03:36,789 --> 00:03:39,229
Just like disable title, disable

130
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,300
featured image, or things like

131
00:03:40,409 --> 00:03:40,520
that.

132
00:03:40,539 --> 00:03:42,120
I'm just gonna save the primary

133
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,319
header and the footer.

134
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,319
Because we've got those built into

135
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:44,979
the Elementor one.

136
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:47,560
You can leave the featured image.

137
00:03:47,659 --> 00:03:49,389
You can leave the title.

138
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:51,150
Update.

139
00:03:54,539 --> 00:03:56,280
Now, if I go to, you can see here

140
00:03:56,379 --> 00:03:57,000
is the permalink.

141
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,919
CA test dot site slash tests.

142
00:03:58,939 --> 00:03:59,639
I go here.

143
00:04:00,189 --> 00:04:02,120
Here's the page, right?

144
00:04:02,139 --> 00:04:03,719
So now you've got this page on a,

145
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:05,210
you know, a sub domain or a

146
00:04:05,259 --> 00:04:06,759
forward slash.

147
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,370
You want to make this your primary

148
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:09,080
homepage.

149
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:11,090
You're going to want to go down to

150
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:13,000
settings and reading.

151
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:15,849
And here your homepage displays.

152
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,269
You're going to set it to a static

153
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:18,910
page and choose the site you want.

154
00:04:18,939 --> 00:04:20,980
So if I choose test now and I save

155
00:04:21,129 --> 00:04:21,879
the changes.

156
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:24,199
When I go to CA test dot site.

157
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:27,240
This main page shows up.

158
00:04:27,259 --> 00:04:30,439
So that's the basics of it.

159
00:04:30,459 --> 00:04:31,600
Again, this follows the same sort

160
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,240
of layout as the card page.

161
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:34,970
It's got everything kind of neat

162
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:35,319
there.

163
00:04:35,339 --> 00:04:36,920
You can edit any elements of it.

164
00:04:36,939 --> 00:04:40,100
It should be pretty easy to do if

165
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:40,949
you've got a bit of WordPress

166
00:04:41,129 --> 00:04:41,480
experience.

167
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,579
WordPress is also a lot cheaper to

168
00:04:42,579 --> 00:04:45,550
host than most other kind of other

169
00:04:45,689 --> 00:04:47,240
website builders.

170
00:04:47,259 --> 00:04:49,279
I think I'm using Hostinger for

171
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:49,639
this.

172
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:50,920
And I got something like, you

173
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,439
know, three or four bucks a month

174
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:54,199
or something like that to host it.

175
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,379
So this is a really good

176
00:04:55,379 --> 00:04:56,120
alternative.

177
00:04:56,139 --> 00:04:57,529
If you want to spend a little bit

178
00:04:57,529 --> 00:04:58,720
less, even if you factor in the

179
00:04:58,779 --> 00:04:59,879
cost of Elementor Pro,

180
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:01,589
if you need it, please test it and

181
00:05:01,589 --> 00:05:02,839
see if you need it or not.

182
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,360
Look for the free version first.

183
00:05:04,379 --> 00:05:06,930
Then, yeah, it still works out

184
00:05:06,949 --> 00:05:08,069
super cheap.

185
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,800
So that's the basics.

186
00:05:09,819 --> 00:05:10,730
This is a super quick video.

187
00:05:10,779 --> 00:05:11,759
I just really want to give you

188
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,149
guys a look into this and what it

189
00:05:13,149 --> 00:05:13,800
looks like.

190
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,389
And to kind of show you some of

191
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,839
the kind of basics of importing it

192
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:19,720
and getting it set up.

193
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:20,779
But if you would like me to do a

194
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:22,060
more detailed WordPress editing

195
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,319
video, I can do that.

196
00:05:23,339 --> 00:05:25,069
But I feel like if you're using

197
00:05:25,069 --> 00:05:26,680
WordPress already and you've built

198
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,319
a site WordPress,

199
00:05:27,339 --> 00:05:28,339
you kind of know the basics of

200
00:05:28,339 --> 00:05:29,980
things like Elementor and building

201
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:31,560
sites and everything.

202
00:05:31,579 --> 00:05:34,079
So if you want more info, let me

203
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:34,360
know.

204
00:05:34,379 --> 00:05:35,259
Hit me up on the landing page

205
00:05:35,259 --> 00:05:35,560
talk.

206
00:05:35,579 --> 00:05:36,920
You can book a one on one.

207
00:05:36,939 --> 00:05:38,339
And we will be switching to weekly

208
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:39,480
landing page calls soon.

209
00:05:39,579 --> 00:05:40,490
So there'll be a group call where

210
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:41,160
you guys can join.

211
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,500
Looking forward to doing that and

212
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,069
getting to meet a few more of you.

213
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,800
So, yeah, I hope that helps.

214
00:05:47,819 --> 00:05:49,560
Again, check for the download link

215
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:51,529
in the Kajabi for the template in

216
00:05:52,009 --> 00:05:52,439
Elementor.

217
00:05:52,459 --> 00:05:53,160
New page.

218
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,259
Edo Elementor.

219
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,319
Little folder icon.

220
00:05:55,339 --> 00:05:56,980
My templates.

221
00:05:57,019 --> 00:05:57,800
Import template.

222
00:05:57,819 --> 00:05:58,839
Top right.

223
00:05:58,860 --> 00:05:59,240
Apply.

224
00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:00,759
Publish.

225
00:06:00,779 --> 00:06:01,689
That's the basics of it.

226
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:03,639
Hope that helps.

227
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:04,680
Let me know what you guys think.

228
00:06:04,699 --> 00:06:05,560
Good luck.
