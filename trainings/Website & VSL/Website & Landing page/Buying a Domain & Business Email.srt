1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,600
All right.

2
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,180
So in this section of the course,

3
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:02,879
you're going to be learning about

4
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:03,480
websites and

5
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,110
VSLs, but obviously you need to

6
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:06,549
first purchase a website.

7
00:00:06,549 --> 00:00:08,199
Now, don't do this thing where

8
00:00:08,199 --> 00:00:08,400
you're

9
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,500
going to like brand it to a

10
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:10,990
specific business model or like a

11
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:11,849
specific niche.

12
00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:12,380
Just come up

13
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:14,320
with kind of like a broad type

14
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,329
name that could kind of apply to

15
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:17,500
anything else.

16
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:18,460
You get what I'm

17
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:19,179
saying?

18
00:00:19,179 --> 00:00:21,500
Like, don't make it like, I don't

19
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,039
know, ecomscaler.com and then you

20
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:24,940
end up doing something

21
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:25,460
else.

22
00:00:25,469 --> 00:00:26,839
You get what I'm saying?

23
00:00:26,839 --> 00:00:27,710
Don't do that.

24
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:29,579
I'm just going to pick some random

25
00:00:29,579 --> 00:00:29,739
things.

26
00:00:29,739 --> 00:00:33,240
AI client ascension test.com.

27
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,219
And I'm just going to say that.

28
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:38,020
Just to show you how this

29
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:38,320
works.

30
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:39,329
So I like to use Squarespace.

31
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:43,280
AI client ascension test.com.

32
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:44,840
Check out.

33
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:45,689
Yep.

34
00:00:49,539 --> 00:00:50,759
I'm going to do one year.

35
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:54,770
Um, you're not doing a website.

36
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:58,159
Don't, don't, don't do a website.

37
00:00:58,159 --> 00:00:59,020
Um, okay.

38
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,950
Yeah, it is all fine.

39
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:02,600
Save and continue.

40
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:10,000
Um, confirm payment.

41
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,079
So it's $14 a year.

42
00:01:18,549 --> 00:01:19,609
Okay, cool.

43
00:01:19,609 --> 00:01:21,180
I have a website now.

44
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,239
So I'm going to click done.

45
00:01:23,239 --> 00:01:25,019
I'm going to go to domains.

46
00:01:25,099 --> 00:01:25,840
AI client.

47
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,959
I'm going to click on that domain.

48
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:29,079
And now here's what you need to

49
00:01:29,099 --> 00:01:29,319
do.

50
00:01:29,459 --> 00:01:29,760
Here's how

51
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,599
you get a business email address.

52
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:32,629
You're going to go to

53
00:01:32,629 --> 00:01:34,269
workspace.google.com.

54
00:01:34,269 --> 00:01:35,219
The links to all

55
00:01:35,219 --> 00:01:35,939
this are going to be in the

56
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:36,629
description as well.

57
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:37,599
So workspace.google.com.

58
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:38,129
This is what you're

59
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:39,040
going to see.

60
00:01:39,219 --> 00:01:40,989
Um, and all you need is a starter

61
00:01:40,989 --> 00:01:41,480
plan.

62
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,599
So like what, when you see, like

63
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:44,209
there's

64
00:01:44,219 --> 00:01:45,939
your name at your domain.com.

65
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,560
So like, what did we just buy?

66
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:48,780
We bought AI client ascension

67
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:49,560
test.com.

68
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,819
How do I make a Daniel at AI

69
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:52,430
client ascension test.com?

70
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,969
The answer is through Google

71
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:54,659
workspace.

72
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:55,819
This is how this works.

73
00:01:55,819 --> 00:01:57,310
And then what happens is you have

74
00:01:57,379 --> 00:01:59,239
like Google sheets, uh, Google

75
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:01,060
me, Google docs all through that

76
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:01,879
workspace.

77
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:03,439
So like for, I'm going to, so this

78
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:04,439
is how you do

79
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:05,069
it.

80
00:02:05,069 --> 00:02:08,469
Um, so I'm just going to say, um,

81
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,129
AI client ascension test, just

82
00:02:12,129 --> 00:02:12,889
you.

83
00:02:12,889 --> 00:02:14,199
I'm in the United

84
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:15,060
States.

85
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,629
Next, Daniel Fazio, uh, a current

86
00:02:18,629 --> 00:02:21,740
email address is like a backup.

87
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:23,960
Next, um, set up an existing

88
00:02:24,409 --> 00:02:26,520
domain, continue with this method.

89
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:28,759
And this is my existing domain, AI

90
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:30,620
client ascension.com, uh,

91
00:02:31,069 --> 00:02:32,229
next.

92
00:02:32,229 --> 00:02:33,840
Okay.

93
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,689
So Daniel at a client says

94
00:02:38,689 --> 00:02:45,590
test.com, um, come up with some

95
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:48,090
password.

96
00:02:48,129 --> 00:02:50,620
Um, it's not

97
00:02:51,069 --> 00:02:53,240
doing the suggest thing.

98
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,870
So I'm going to just put some

99
00:02:55,870 --> 00:03:10,620
random, okay.

100
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:14,379
Um, flexible when a 40 month

101
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:16,449
business starter, um, try free for

102
00:03:16,449 --> 00:03:17,300
14 days.

103
00:03:17,349 --> 00:03:19,919
So you get a 14 day free trial.

104
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:22,189
Business starter.

105
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:26,580
Um, can I, can I not do that?

106
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,659
Payment method?

107
00:03:28,659 --> 00:03:30,780
No, I guess I do.

108
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:31,270
I put it.

109
00:03:44,379 --> 00:03:44,719
Okay.

110
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:46,030
I'm going to pause the video and

111
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,599
add a payment method real quick.

112
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:48,770
Okay.

113
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,639
I added that.

114
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:53,979
Green continue.

115
00:03:58,629 --> 00:03:59,330
Okay.

116
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:04,389
Now, Daniel Fazio, Daniel,

117
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,349
dfazio85.gmail.com.

118
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:10,110
Oh, no, just to add, just to add

119
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:11,430
another user.

120
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:14,240
I don't need to add another user.

121
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,199
Nevermind.

122
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:15,860
You don't have to do that.

123
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:16,060
Okay.

124
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,899
So you can verify your own client

125
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:18,860
session, uh,

126
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:19,970
AI client ascension test.com and

127
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:21,069
then use Gmail with your domain.

128
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:21,310
Okay.

129
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:21,790
So get started.

130
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:23,490
Okay.

131
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:24,189
Okay.

132
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,110
So, so there is, there is a, is

133
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:30,139
it, there's an automatic thing

134
00:04:30,139 --> 00:04:31,800
with Squarespace

135
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,100
that, that, that you can do,

136
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:33,490
right?

137
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,889
So I'll, I'm just going to do that

138
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:35,430
for now.

139
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:35,790
I'm going

140
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:38,399
to confirm it, but I need to also

141
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:40,839
explain to you what that's going

142
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:41,470
to do.

143
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:42,680
And I'll show you

144
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,139
in a second.

145
00:04:44,139 --> 00:04:45,740
Okay, cool.

146
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:48,920
So what that just did is it added

147
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,509
DNS records.

148
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,129
What are DNS records?

149
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:53,620
So like,

150
00:04:53,629 --> 00:04:55,920
okay, I'm going to refresh this

151
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,430
now.

152
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:56,939
DNS.

153
00:04:56,939 --> 00:04:57,529
Okay.

154
00:04:57,529 --> 00:05:00,040
So all this shit, it's hold on.

155
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,939
It just added this

156
00:05:01,949 --> 00:05:02,750
right here.

157
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,620
It added this TXT record over here

158
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:05,949
and like a bunch of this shit

159
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:06,970
right here.

160
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:07,750
It just added

161
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,029
all of this, right?

162
00:05:09,029 --> 00:05:10,850
That's how it connects to Google

163
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:12,810
workspace where it's like that.

164
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:13,339
That's

165
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:14,769
what like domain settings are just

166
00:05:14,769 --> 00:05:15,769
DNS settings, right?

167
00:05:15,769 --> 00:05:16,959
So that's what happened right

168
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:17,360
here.

169
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:17,819
So now

170
00:05:17,819 --> 00:05:18,870
start using Gmail with your

171
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:19,269
domain.

172
00:05:19,329 --> 00:05:20,439
We'll help you set up Gmail.

173
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:21,759
So it's probably going to make me

174
00:05:22,209 --> 00:05:23,600
manually add DNS myself now.

175
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,389
So hold on.

176
00:05:24,389 --> 00:05:26,240
Set up Gmail instead of receive

177
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,000
emails.

178
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,339
Okay.

179
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:28,019
Continue.

180
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:29,110
Danny Fazio.

181
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:29,610
Yes.

182
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:31,879
Me proceed with activation.

183
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:32,790
Okay.

184
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:36,240
I'm going to, I want to switch it

185
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:36,800
to manual

186
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:38,449
verification just so I can show

187
00:05:38,449 --> 00:05:38,779
you.

188
00:05:38,829 --> 00:05:39,529
Continue.

189
00:05:39,529 --> 00:05:39,959
Okay.

190
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:41,670
So, so, so I'm going to show you

191
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:42,319
what adding

192
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:43,920
a DNS record does.

193
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,300
So it wants a MX record with this

194
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,040
data.

195
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,740
So I'm going to copy this priority

196
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:50,259
as one.

197
00:05:50,259 --> 00:05:54,069
So I'm going to add a record.

198
00:05:54,069 --> 00:05:55,740
Oh, fuck.

199
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,120
Hold on.

200
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,360
But you could have just did it

201
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,790
automatically.

202
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:03,310
I'm just showing you this just so

203
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:05,019
you know what DNS means

204
00:06:05,029 --> 00:06:06,360
because you're going to like fuck

205
00:06:06,389 --> 00:06:07,629
with DNS a lot in your, in your

206
00:06:07,629 --> 00:06:08,019
life.

207
00:06:08,019 --> 00:06:08,899
You're going to do this like

208
00:06:08,899 --> 00:06:10,410
hella frequently.

209
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:11,379
So you just, you need to know

210
00:06:11,379 --> 00:06:12,240
what's happening here.

211
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:12,740
Right?

212
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:13,519
So

213
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:15,970
MX.

214
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:17,040
MX record.

215
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:19,439
Priority is one.

216
00:06:19,889 --> 00:06:24,060
This is the data.

217
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:27,540
It's actually there.

218
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:27,720
It's actually there.

219
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:29,519
TTL.

220
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:34,220
4 hours, 30 minutes.

221
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:36,779
And then host is set to default

222
00:06:36,779 --> 00:06:37,759
values.

223
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:44,649
I think you just put an ad.

224
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:46,189
Save.

225
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:51,600
Okay.

226
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:51,600
Okay.

227
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:51,819
Cool.

228
00:06:52,269 --> 00:06:52,620
Now.

229
00:06:53,069 --> 00:07:00,819
Confirmed.

230
00:07:01,269 --> 00:07:03,699
Cool.

231
00:07:03,699 --> 00:07:04,300
Bam.

232
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:04,740
It worked.

233
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:05,040
All right.

234
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,879
So now, let me show you what

235
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:09,019
Google Workspace actually looks

236
00:07:09,019 --> 00:07:09,540
like.

237
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:11,079
And the way you get to that is

238
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:14,459
with admin.google.com.

239
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,269
Okay.

240
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:34,540
Okay.

241
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:34,819
Cool.

242
00:07:34,819 --> 00:07:36,269
So admin.google.com.

243
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:37,519
And you log in with the email you

244
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:38,040
just made.

245
00:07:38,139 --> 00:07:39,480
So I just logged in with Daniel at

246
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,009
AIclientessentialtest.com.

247
00:07:41,019 --> 00:07:41,879
I understand.

248
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:45,240
So you'll, you'll get this thing.

249
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,230
Sign into new, uh, sign into a new

250
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:47,939
Chrome profile.

251
00:07:47,939 --> 00:07:48,259
Hold on.

252
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:49,389
Let me move my fucking, you won't

253
00:07:49,389 --> 00:07:49,709
see it.

254
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,050
Um, sign into a new Chrome

255
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:51,689
profile.

256
00:07:51,699 --> 00:07:53,579
You should do that.

257
00:07:53,579 --> 00:07:56,170
That's like, um, that's, you see

258
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:56,879
the top right.

259
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:58,259
You see a person and like you

260
00:07:58,259 --> 00:07:59,379
could open another,

261
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:00,829
you can make like a new Chrome

262
00:08:00,829 --> 00:08:02,379
profile for, um,

263
00:08:02,829 --> 00:08:04,740
this like business.

264
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,189
You should do that.

265
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:07,680
I'm going to say no for now, but

266
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,740
you should do that.

267
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,439
Um, all right, cool.

268
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,029
So now here's, here's where

269
00:08:12,029 --> 00:08:13,079
everything is.

270
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:14,170
So it's like, you have all your

271
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:14,720
shit here.

272
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,649
So like users, like what are my

273
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,319
users?

274
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:18,180
What do my users look like?

275
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:19,319
It's Daniel Fazio, right?

276
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:20,180
You also have apps.

277
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:21,449
So like, what kind of apps do we

278
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:21,730
have?

279
00:08:21,779 --> 00:08:22,579
Google Workspace.

280
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:25,500
Um, all right.

281
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:26,139
I'll just go here.

282
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:28,720
Google Workspace.

283
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,100
Now I want to find Gmail.

284
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:30,959
Okay.

285
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:31,720
Gmail's on.

286
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,460
So what does that mean?

287
00:08:32,538 --> 00:08:33,450
It means that if I go to

288
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:35,668
gmail.com, I can log in with

289
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,399
Daniel at client ascension,

290
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:39,500
AI client ascension test.com and

291
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,200
the password I set, and now I have

292
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:41,918
Gmail, right?

293
00:08:41,918 --> 00:08:42,179
Okay.

294
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:44,289
So, so all of this shit you see

295
00:08:44,289 --> 00:08:44,919
here.

296
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:46,259
So like, for instance, if you're

297
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:47,990
connecting a domain to, um, like

298
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:50,159
go high level or click

299
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:52,269
funnels, what it's going to do is

300
00:08:52,269 --> 00:08:54,090
it's going to ask you to put in

301
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:56,120
DNS records and it'll

302
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,700
be manual at that point.

303
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,429
And, but all you do, all you need

304
00:08:59,429 --> 00:09:00,590
to understand is that you have a

305
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:01,779
domain, you go to DNS settings,

306
00:09:01,779 --> 00:09:03,379
you just add it in.

307
00:09:03,379 --> 00:09:05,100
So like, for instance, um, you

308
00:09:05,139 --> 00:09:06,659
know, you know, we just go to

309
00:09:06,659 --> 00:09:08,360
custom records over here.

310
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,429
So you just, you just do add

311
00:09:09,429 --> 00:09:10,710
record and it's always like some

312
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:11,159
shit.

313
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:12,940
It'll just say, add this TXT

314
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:14,889
record with this text or data,

315
00:09:14,889 --> 00:09:15,539
right?

316
00:09:15,539 --> 00:09:17,320
And normally you could just leave

317
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,120
host blank.

318
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:20,059
But if it's like a C name, for

319
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:22,080
instance, like a C name, what

320
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,879
that'll do is, um, you ever

321
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:26,000
notice how you'll see something

322
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
where it's like

323
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,399
www.clientascension.com?

324
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:31,049
That's, that's like a C name

325
00:09:31,049 --> 00:09:32,980
record where it's like the host is

326
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:33,379
www.

327
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:35,340
Get what I'm saying?

328
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:38,500
Um, but if you do like go now and

329
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,070
go and you point it to a, a

330
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:43,679
specific IP address.

331
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:45,590
So like, for instance, um, like if

332
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:47,320
you were on ClickFunnels, like if

333
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:48,379
you, if you were

334
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:49,610
on go high level or ClickFunnels

335
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:50,929
and you're like, I want to publish

336
00:09:50,929 --> 00:09:53,360
this domain on go.yourdomain.com,

337
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,399
what you would do is tell it, it

338
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:57,659
would give you a record that says,

339
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,389
okay, make a C name record

340
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:01,049
with the host go and send it to

341
00:10:01,049 --> 00:10:02,620
this series of numbers.

342
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:03,769
And you would just like copy and

343
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:04,830
paste the numbers in here and

344
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,539
you'd save it.

345
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:06,720
And that's, that's all you do.

346
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,399
That's, that's all DNS record is.

347
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,580
You just fuck with it like that.

348
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:10,490
That's, that's pretty much all you

349
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:10,980
need to know.

350
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,590
But now this is all set up, uh,

351
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:14,279
you can fuck around in here if you

352
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:14,799
want.

353
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:16,070
Like if you have an employee and

354
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:17,409
they need to email, this is where

355
00:10:17,409 --> 00:10:17,970
you do it.

356
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,720
Just admin.google.com and you just

357
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,960
click add user and then it's $8 a

358
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:23,659
month.

359
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:25,720
That's, that's how that works.

360
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,519
Um, yeah, but you're not, you're

361
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:28,799
not building a website in

362
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:29,700
Squarespace.

363
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:31,299
You're, you're going to, we're,

364
00:10:31,299 --> 00:10:32,850
we're recommending you use go high

365
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:33,950
level because it has like a

366
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:35,600
fuck ton of shit for, for you to

367
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,039
use.

368
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:36,759
You'll see another video.

369
00:10:36,759 --> 00:10:38,539
It's, it's all in this section.

370
00:10:38,539 --> 00:10:39,059
You'll see it.

371
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,320
But yeah, that's it for this

372
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:40,759
video.

373
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:41,159
All right, peace.
