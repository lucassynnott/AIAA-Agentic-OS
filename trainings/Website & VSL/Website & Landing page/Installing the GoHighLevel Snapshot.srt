1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:01,429
All right, so in this video, we're

2
00:00:01,429 --> 00:00:02,720
going to cover how to customize

3
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:04,759
your subaccount and your snapshot,

4
00:00:04,759 --> 00:00:05,419
okay?

5
00:00:05,719 --> 00:00:08,900
So if or when you go into your

6
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:11,509
subaccount, you're going to see

7
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:12,949
this thing right here, the

8
00:00:12,949 --> 00:00:13,720
launchpad.

9
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:14,750
You don't really have to do

10
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:15,859
anything in this page.

11
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:17,280
It's just high-level trying to

12
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,690
kind of guide you on how to start

13
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:20,300
using all of their features, but

14
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:21,539
you don't need to worry about all

15
00:00:21,589 --> 00:00:21,879
that.

16
00:00:21,929 --> 00:00:23,800
To access your subaccount, if you

17
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:25,710
are not in it yet, just click here

18
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:27,379
on this section and select the

19
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,300
subaccount you want to use.

20
00:00:30,019 --> 00:00:32,289
All right, now the first thing you

21
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,240
want to do is go to settings,

22
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,710
okay, and then business profile,

23
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:38,759
and you want to fill all of this

24
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:40,140
out, all right?

25
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:41,450
The reason you want to do it now

26
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:42,869
is because down the line, we're

27
00:00:42,869 --> 00:00:44,229
going to do what's called A2P

28
00:00:44,229 --> 00:00:46,159
registration, which is what will

29
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,750
allow you to send text messages to

30
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,880
other businesses and, you know,

31
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,100
anyone really through our

32
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,630
automations, all right?

33
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,109
And by doing it now, this is going

34
00:00:55,109 --> 00:00:56,439
to save you a bunch of time.

35
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,159
So make sure to fill it out fully.

36
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:01,000
Just all of this is going to take

37
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,899
you at most five minutes.

38
00:01:02,289 --> 00:01:04,709
And then once you do that, you

39
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:07,780
want to go down to integrations,

40
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:08,579
okay?

41
00:01:08,609 --> 00:01:09,900
So in integrations, here you can

42
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,200
connect your Google Calendar,

43
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,530
Facebook, Instagram, Stripe,

44
00:01:12,579 --> 00:01:14,079
Slack, anything you may use.

45
00:01:14,109 --> 00:01:15,549
If you use Notion or ClickUp for

46
00:01:15,549 --> 00:01:17,359
project management, Airtable, you

47
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:18,700
could do that in here as well,

48
00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:19,420
okay?

49
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:20,540
But again, just make sure to

50
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:21,879
connect all of your accounts we're

51
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:22,870
going to be using for your

52
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:23,500
business.

53
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,269
Then what you want to do is

54
00:01:26,269 --> 00:01:28,299
connect a domain, okay?

55
00:01:28,329 --> 00:01:29,849
So I prefer to just buy it from

56
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:31,840
Squarespace or Porkbun or wherever

57
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,379
else.

58
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,680
But if you want, you can just

59
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,260
purchase it directly through High

60
00:01:35,269 --> 00:01:35,760
Level.

61
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:37,730
So to connect it, you're going to

62
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:39,700
click there on Connect Domain and

63
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,239
then choose this option right

64
00:01:41,489 --> 00:01:42,450
here, okay?

65
00:01:43,489 --> 00:01:44,150
So you're going to put your

66
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:44,500
domain.

67
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:47,400
So I'm just going to get my stuff

68
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,620
in here.

69
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,290
Give me one second.

70
00:01:49,329 --> 00:01:49,780
All right.

71
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:50,469
All right.

72
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:52,109
So we're going to use one of our,

73
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:53,930
or one of my, you know, secondary

74
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:54,650
domains.

75
00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:55,579
So I'm just going to put a

76
00:01:55,579 --> 00:01:56,420
subdomain here.

77
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:59,799
So let's call test.begin.

78
00:02:00,189 --> 00:02:03,260
But this could be your main

79
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:04,689
domain.

80
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,890
I'm using a subdomain mainly

81
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:09,439
because I don't have like a fake

82
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:11,280
domain to connect.

83
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,319
But put your domain in there.

84
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:14,860
Click Continue.

85
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,180
And then you're going to select

86
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:17,520
Add Record Manually, usually

87
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,719
because what will happen if you

88
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:20,199
click Continue and set up and try

89
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:21,860
to do it automatically, it's going

90
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:22,469
to think for a bit.

91
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:23,460
And then it's going to ask you to

92
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,360
do it manually anyways.

93
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,560
So just click Add Record Manually

94
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,219
and then just copy the records it

95
00:02:28,219 --> 00:02:28,990
gives you.

96
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:30,139
If you're connecting your main

97
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:31,400
domain, you're going to have two

98
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:31,889
records.

99
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:32,990
It's going to be an A record and a

100
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:33,419
C name.

101
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,849
Because I'm doing a subdomain,

102
00:02:34,849 --> 00:02:36,250
it's going to give me the C name,

103
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:36,729
okay?

104
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,930
But it's the same exact process.

105
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:40,439
We're going to go to your domain

106
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:41,139
registrar.

107
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:42,240
Click on DNS.

108
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:44,259
Add a record here.

109
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:46,080
Okay.

110
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:47,629
It's asking me to verify, so give

111
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:48,439
me a second.

112
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:50,990
There we go.

113
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:52,500
You're going to put the host,

114
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,219
which it gives you right there.

115
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,539
Make sure to select the correct

116
00:02:55,539 --> 00:02:56,039
record.

117
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:00,900
Then the required value.

118
00:03:01,289 --> 00:03:04,860
And then save.

119
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:05,879
Okay.

120
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,960
So once you do that, you're going

121
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,169
to click here, verify records.

122
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:11,319
You're going to let it think for a

123
00:03:11,379 --> 00:03:12,080
couple seconds.

124
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:16,810
I'm going to pause here while we

125
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:17,159
wait.

126
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:18,039
All right.

127
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:19,449
So once you finish connecting your

128
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:20,879
domain, it'll just automatically

129
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,259
send you to this page right here.

130
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,009
And here you can just link any

131
00:03:24,009 --> 00:03:25,780
funnels with your domain.

132
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:26,800
So if you have a website built

133
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,159
out, you could click on Website.

134
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:29,300
Okay.

135
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,860
And then select any websites you

136
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:32,039
have, like this one.

137
00:03:32,069 --> 00:03:33,060
Or if you prefer to connect

138
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,409
directly to a funnel, you can just

139
00:03:34,409 --> 00:03:35,620
select Funnel and then click

140
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:36,949
whichever one you want to use.

141
00:03:37,129 --> 00:03:39,159
So let's say we go with a website.

142
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:40,699
Okay.

143
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:41,840
Then you're going to select which

144
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:42,689
one is the homepage.

145
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:44,330
It's obviously home.

146
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,099
And then additional options.

147
00:03:46,129 --> 00:03:47,569
If you want to have like an error

148
00:03:47,569 --> 00:03:49,000
page created, you could add that

149
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:49,740
in here.

150
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:51,409
Or you could just go ahead and

151
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:53,250
select the homepage as well for

152
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,180
the agency.

153
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:54,340
Right.

154
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,780
And then you click Proceed to

155
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:56,319
Finish.

156
00:03:56,710 --> 00:04:01,039
And again, it's going to think for

157
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:02,719
a little bit.

158
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:05,879
And then we're good to go.

159
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:06,159
Okay.

160
00:04:06,189 --> 00:04:07,039
So we've got this one here.

161
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,770
If you ever want to edit

162
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:11,289
something, you click Manage and

163
00:04:11,289 --> 00:04:13,520
you can connect a new thing,

164
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:13,810
right?

165
00:04:13,849 --> 00:04:15,520
A new website funnel or set

166
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,939
another default page if you want.

167
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:18,800
Right.

168
00:04:18,819 --> 00:04:20,970
So pretty easy to follow.

169
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:21,899
All right.

170
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,490
From there, we have the custom

171
00:04:25,529 --> 00:04:26,399
values.

172
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:26,899
Okay.

173
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:28,459
So custom values, essentially a

174
00:04:28,529 --> 00:04:30,009
value that is the same across the

175
00:04:30,009 --> 00:04:31,029
full subaccount.

176
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:31,399
Okay.

177
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:33,509
And you can use it to customize

178
00:04:33,509 --> 00:04:35,980
like your website landing pages in

179
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,420
a much easier way than having

180
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:39,670
to upload a new image or link or

181
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:41,860
whatever every single time.

182
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:43,410
Let me show you how I use it.

183
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:45,879
So to update a custom value.

184
00:04:45,949 --> 00:04:47,379
So let's use the account logo, for

185
00:04:47,379 --> 00:04:47,959
example.

186
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:48,540
Right.

187
00:04:48,589 --> 00:04:50,110
So to edit it, you're going to

188
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:51,750
click here and then edit custom

189
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:52,980
value and put in the value

190
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,920
that you want to use.

191
00:04:53,939 --> 00:04:54,379
Okay.

192
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:56,779
So for an account logo, right?

193
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:57,990
So let's say you want to use your

194
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:58,329
logo.

195
00:04:58,379 --> 00:04:59,910
What you want to do is go to media

196
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:02,319
storage, upload, and then select

197
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,180
whatever logo you want to use.

198
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:05,439
Now I'm just going to pick any

199
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:06,449
random image here.

200
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,629
Let's say this one, get link.

201
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,240
Go back to settings, custom

202
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,689
values, and then edit the custom

203
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:15,519
value.

204
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:16,899
We're going to paste that link

205
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:17,939
here and update it.

206
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:20,689
So what this does then is if the

207
00:05:20,689 --> 00:05:23,420
custom value is added inside the

208
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:26,199
funnel or website in the logo

209
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:27,899
field or in the image field for

210
00:05:27,899 --> 00:05:28,389
the logo,

211
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,300
then it'll automatically update to

212
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,680
whatever we have in here.

213
00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:34,410
So to add it into a website, you

214
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:35,970
would just click the custom value

215
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:36,310
key.

216
00:05:36,709 --> 00:05:38,959
Then you would go into the sides.

217
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,149
And again, just to show you

218
00:05:40,149 --> 00:05:41,740
quickly how custom values work.

219
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:44,220
And then assuming it's added in

220
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,139
here, if we open up the page,

221
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:48,259
you'll see it right here, right?

222
00:05:49,579 --> 00:05:51,629
So let me go back to our other

223
00:05:51,629 --> 00:05:52,279
page.

224
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,740
And just to quickly show you what

225
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,110
that looks like or where to put

226
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:58,139
that key.

227
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:01,970
So here's the image and here's the

228
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:05,589
image, you know, link would go

229
00:06:05,589 --> 00:06:06,759
here.

230
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:08,050
So we just put a custom value

231
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:09,050
instead, right?

232
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:10,189
So whenever you put the custom

233
00:06:10,189 --> 00:06:11,250
value or wherever you put the

234
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,139
custom value, it will populate

235
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:15,660
whatever value is in there, right?

236
00:06:15,689 --> 00:06:17,410
It's inside the key or the code

237
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:18,379
here, okay?

238
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:20,399
So that's how they work.

239
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,949
And I have created three for you

240
00:06:22,029 --> 00:06:23,120
guys to start with.

241
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:23,990
You can create as many as you

242
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:24,360
want.

243
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,930
But we have a logo, a booking page

244
00:06:26,939 --> 00:06:27,639
link.

245
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:28,860
So whenever you create your

246
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,279
booking page, you just take the

247
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:31,990
link, click the three dots, edit,

248
00:06:32,009 --> 00:06:33,120
and then paste the booking link

249
00:06:33,329 --> 00:06:33,500
here.

250
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:34,920
That way, when you create

251
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,910
automations for yourself, right,

252
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:38,720
for follow-ups or whatever it may

253
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:38,980
be,

254
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:40,769
you just take this value and you

255
00:06:40,769 --> 00:06:42,540
put it in there instead of having

256
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:43,970
to go and find the booking link

257
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,790
for your business, okay?

258
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,339
And same thing with colors is

259
00:06:47,339 --> 00:06:49,160
similar to the account logo idea.

260
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:52,470
For the websites or landing pages,

261
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:55,279
you just pretty much in the color

262
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:57,959
selector thing, instead of a hex

263
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,459
code, just put the custom value

264
00:06:59,459 --> 00:07:00,689
and it'll populate your actual

265
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:02,810
company color, okay?

266
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:04,850
So that's pretty much on how to

267
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:06,500
take the first couple steps in

268
00:07:06,579 --> 00:07:08,560
setting up your snapshot, okay?

269
00:07:08,589 --> 00:07:10,079
If you run into any issues, let me

270
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,660
know and I'll be happy to help.

271
00:07:11,689 --> 00:07:12,199
Bye.
