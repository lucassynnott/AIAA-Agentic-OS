1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,179
All right, in this video, we're

2
00:00:01,209 --> 00:00:02,759
going to go over the conversation

3
00:00:02,759 --> 00:00:05,250
or inbox tab where you'll talk

4
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:07,030
and email and call every single

5
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,320
lead you guys have.

6
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:09,050
Okay.

7
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:11,679
So the way it works, just click

8
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:12,500
here.

9
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:14,820
It'll say conversations or inbox

10
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,109
in your account.

11
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:18,079
And here's pretty much where

12
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:19,300
you'll talk to every

13
00:00:19,329 --> 00:00:19,679
lead.

14
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:21,210
So you can text them through SMS,

15
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:22,350
WhatsApp, you can get it

16
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:23,010
connected.

17
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:24,539
It just involves an

18
00:00:24,859 --> 00:00:26,089
extra cost or you can email them.

19
00:00:26,089 --> 00:00:26,449
Okay.

20
00:00:26,449 --> 00:00:27,699
So for SMS, all you got to do is

21
00:00:27,699 --> 00:00:28,839
just type your message.

22
00:00:30,339 --> 00:00:31,429
And send it.

23
00:00:31,429 --> 00:00:32,259
Okay.

24
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:35,810
Now, obviously, it's not going to

25
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:39,299
go through just because I have not

26
00:00:39,299 --> 00:00:39,450
been

27
00:00:39,799 --> 00:00:40,609
approved for A2P.

28
00:00:40,609 --> 00:00:41,030
Okay.

29
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:42,920
But once you get approved for A2P,

30
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,899
you can send text and everything.

31
00:00:44,899 --> 00:00:45,159
Now,

32
00:00:45,189 --> 00:00:46,560
as you can see, it adds this thing

33
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:47,530
and this thing here.

34
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:49,200
The reason it does that is, again,

35
00:00:49,229 --> 00:00:50,670
it's due to the texting issues.

36
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:51,979
You got to let people know they

37
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,320
can unsubscribe and all that

38
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:53,619
stuff.

39
00:00:53,649 --> 00:00:55,009
You could edit this.

40
00:00:55,009 --> 00:00:55,520
Okay.

41
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,560
So the way to edit this, I'll just

42
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,170
show you right now before I

43
00:00:59,170 --> 00:00:59,759
forget.

44
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,299
You go to settings and you go to

45
00:01:02,299 --> 00:01:05,530
business info, you scroll down and

46
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:07,650
let's see.

47
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:13,099
SMS compliance settings.

48
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:25,260
Okay.

49
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:28,560
So here, SMS compliance.

50
00:01:28,659 --> 00:01:30,560
And here you can customize the

51
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,939
opt-out message.

52
00:01:31,939 --> 00:01:33,959
So what I do is I just put,

53
00:01:34,299 --> 00:01:38,790
if you want me to stop contacting

54
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:39,530
you,

55
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:41,859
just let me know or something

56
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:43,659
along those lines.

57
00:01:43,659 --> 00:01:46,459
So the reason I do that, so it

58
00:01:46,459 --> 00:01:47,790
contains the keyword

59
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:51,260
stop, but it's not so, um, direct

60
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:53,060
as in, Hey, you can just reply,

61
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:54,420
stop to unsubscribe.

62
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:55,120
Okay.

63
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:55,439
So

64
00:01:55,469 --> 00:01:57,159
it includes a keyword, but if

65
00:01:57,239 --> 00:01:59,209
people want to not talk to anyone,

66
00:01:59,299 --> 00:02:00,680
they say, Hey, yeah, I'm not

67
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,099
interested

68
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,260
instead of saying stop, because if

69
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:05,180
they say stop, it's like a hit to

70
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:07,129
your reputation with the phone

71
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:07,920
number company.

72
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:09,229
And if you get too many opt-outs,

73
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:10,569
they'll just remove your ability

74
00:02:10,569 --> 00:02:11,219
to get phone

75
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:11,789
numbers.

76
00:02:11,789 --> 00:02:12,219
Okay.

77
00:02:12,219 --> 00:02:14,789
Um, so yeah, that's pretty much

78
00:02:14,789 --> 00:02:16,159
how that works.

79
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,400
I was going to keep it like this

80
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:18,870
if you

81
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:19,740
want.

82
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:28,740
Okay.

83
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:39,740
And then here center ID could be

84
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,310
your name pretty much.

85
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:46,750
Thanks Henry

86
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:51,860
or just something like that

87
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:54,469
and save.

88
00:02:54,469 --> 00:02:55,620
All right.

89
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,830
That way it doesn't look so weird.

90
00:02:57,830 --> 00:02:59,009
Feel, feels a little bit more

91
00:02:59,009 --> 00:02:59,460
natural.

92
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:01,520
So if we go back to the inbox, let

93
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,439
me just show you what you can do

94
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:04,129
in here.

95
00:03:04,129 --> 00:03:05,539
So here you got the

96
00:03:05,569 --> 00:03:07,389
unread conversations, recents,

97
00:03:07,389 --> 00:03:08,000
starred.

98
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,650
So if there's any like important

99
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:10,770
context or what I used

100
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:12,300
to do is I would just star every

101
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,689
client that I had that way it

102
00:03:13,689 --> 00:03:15,400
would be easier to, to contact

103
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:15,599
them

104
00:03:15,689 --> 00:03:16,569
and talk to them.

105
00:03:16,569 --> 00:03:17,860
Um, now I kind of have just a

106
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:19,599
separate sub account for clients,

107
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,750
but, but yeah, you

108
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:23,150
could star people at the end of

109
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:24,719
the day by just clicking this, it

110
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:25,879
starts a conversation.

111
00:03:26,069 --> 00:03:26,580
It shows up

112
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:27,069
here.

113
00:03:27,069 --> 00:03:27,539
Okay.

114
00:03:27,539 --> 00:03:29,699
Now, if you want to email them,

115
00:03:29,699 --> 00:03:31,060
just click email.

116
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:33,280
You can write your subject line

117
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:33,539
here,

118
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:35,289
your email here.

119
00:03:35,289 --> 00:03:37,680
You can add links, images, docs,

120
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,419
whatever you want.

121
00:03:38,789 --> 00:03:40,060
Okay.

122
00:03:40,389 --> 00:03:43,340
Now something else you could do.

123
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:45,300
So let's say you forgot the name

124
00:03:45,379 --> 00:03:46,919
of the business of this person or

125
00:03:47,259 --> 00:03:48,370
important detail.

126
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:50,370
You could go here and you have a

127
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:52,689
lot of custom fields, meaning

128
00:03:52,689 --> 00:03:53,659
these things will

129
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,580
populate based on the information

130
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:56,990
to a specific client.

131
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:58,150
So appointments.

132
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:59,699
So if you want to say if they,

133
00:03:59,729 --> 00:04:01,009
let's say they have an appointment

134
00:04:01,009 --> 00:04:02,210
on Tuesday, you could say, see

135
00:04:02,219 --> 00:04:02,580
you.

136
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:03,819
And then, oh, I don't know what

137
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,229
date exactly it is.

138
00:04:05,229 --> 00:04:06,979
Just go here appointment.

139
00:04:07,099 --> 00:04:10,340
And then you can click, let's see

140
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:12,099
where it is.

141
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:14,699
Start date.

142
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:16,980
Yes.

143
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:17,800
Start date, I think.

144
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,370
And then it'll just populate the

145
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:22,009
appointment date.

146
00:04:22,339 --> 00:04:23,060
All right.

147
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:25,019
Um, or you could, you know,

148
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,740
business name, stuff like that, or

149
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,129
any custom fields we have.

150
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:28,779
Okay.

151
00:04:28,779 --> 00:04:29,579
We'll show up here

152
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:31,519
and same thing with the email.

153
00:04:31,629 --> 00:04:33,569
Now something else you could do,

154
00:04:33,569 --> 00:04:35,360
you want to make sure you assign

155
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:35,509
it to

156
00:04:35,779 --> 00:04:36,470
yourself, but something else you

157
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:37,319
could do is just, you could call

158
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:37,980
people from here.

159
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,060
So if you just click

160
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:40,240
this button, I'll start a call

161
00:04:40,269 --> 00:04:41,439
with them and you can just call

162
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:42,629
them and see what's up.

163
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,889
Now here you could

164
00:04:44,189 --> 00:04:45,680
also add notes about the contact.

165
00:04:45,699 --> 00:04:47,050
What I used to do is whenever I

166
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:50,629
had a discovery call, um, I would

167
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:50,899
just

168
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,509
pretty much write the notes here

169
00:04:52,509 --> 00:04:54,310
instead of my, now use a notebook,

170
00:04:54,329 --> 00:04:56,019
but it's just do it there because

171
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:56,759
it was easier.

172
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:58,279
You create tasks for yourself.

173
00:04:58,279 --> 00:04:59,269
Opportunity.

174
00:04:59,269 --> 00:05:01,269
You could update the opportunity

175
00:05:01,589 --> 00:05:02,449
right through here.

176
00:05:02,449 --> 00:05:04,160
If you want to appointments, you

177
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,839
could book an appointment right

178
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:06,180
through here.

179
00:05:06,209 --> 00:05:06,769
If you want to.

180
00:05:06,779 --> 00:05:08,610
And then lastly, you got the

181
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:10,220
contact information.

182
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:10,639
Okay.

183
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:11,540
Now, if we click right

184
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:13,850
here on the contact details, you

185
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:16,670
can find all their information.

186
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:19,060
So you got contact info, lead

187
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:20,620
information, additional

188
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,040
information, right?

189
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,649
So that you could just come in

190
00:05:23,649 --> 00:05:25,060
here and do whatever you

191
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:26,139
need to look at.

192
00:05:26,139 --> 00:05:27,889
Then here you can add tags.

193
00:05:27,889 --> 00:05:29,560
You can add them to specific

194
00:05:29,569 --> 00:05:30,860
automations if needed.

195
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:32,069
You can update their

196
00:05:32,069 --> 00:05:32,879
opportunities.

197
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:35,860
Um, and do not disturb.

198
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,720
So you could either, um, not let

199
00:05:37,829 --> 00:05:38,029
them

200
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:39,470
reach out to you or if they ask

201
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,040
you to remove them from a list,

202
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,519
just remove them from the list

203
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:43,970
through here.

204
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:44,709
Okay.

205
00:05:44,709 --> 00:05:48,360
Now here, this section right here.

206
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,350
So this is pretty cool because if

207
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:52,279
you're using

208
00:05:52,389 --> 00:05:54,240
go high level for the websites and

209
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,329
landing pages, it'll actually keep

210
00:05:56,329 --> 00:05:57,930
track of all their activities

211
00:05:58,269 --> 00:05:59,120
within your business.

212
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,649
So you can see exactly when they

213
00:06:00,649 --> 00:06:01,040
visit a

214
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,560
landing page, when they watch a

215
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,079
video, if you're tracking that,

216
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:05,459
when they will call, when they

217
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,720
become a customer, like

218
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,470
everything, whenever they pay,

219
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:09,610
it'll be in here and you can

220
00:06:09,949 --> 00:06:10,240
scroll

221
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:10,860
through it.

222
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,189
If you're running ads, even you

223
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:13,529
can track that and see exactly

224
00:06:13,529 --> 00:06:14,220
which ad they

225
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,089
came from.

226
00:06:15,089 --> 00:06:16,589
So it's pretty cool.

227
00:06:16,589 --> 00:06:18,720
And same idea, tasks, notes,

228
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,980
appointments.

229
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:20,720
Here you can add

230
00:06:21,139 --> 00:06:22,519
documents specific to this person.

231
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,199
So contracts and things like that,

232
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:25,540
transactions and payments.

233
00:06:25,569 --> 00:06:27,029
You can again, create a

234
00:06:27,029 --> 00:06:29,220
subscription, invoice, manage

235
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,319
cards, create estimates, add a

236
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:32,199
card or charge them

237
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:33,300
now for something.

238
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,959
And here's just association.

239
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:36,620
So if you have like a company name

240
00:06:36,689 --> 00:06:37,439
or other people

241
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:38,889
that work in the same company, you

242
00:06:38,889 --> 00:06:39,990
could connect them with one

243
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:41,600
another, but you don't really need

244
00:06:41,629 --> 00:06:42,930
to worry about that.

245
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:44,959
And yeah, that's pretty much what

246
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:47,040
you can do with the conversations

247
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:47,899
and inbox

248
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:48,379
section.

249
00:06:48,379 --> 00:06:49,579
And another thing is internal

250
00:06:49,579 --> 00:06:50,110
comments.

251
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:50,430
Okay.

252
00:06:50,449 --> 00:06:51,949
So I don't use this a lot, but if

253
00:06:51,949 --> 00:06:52,959
you want to add an

254
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,279
internal comment based on delete

255
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:55,529
itself, let's say you had, you

256
00:06:55,529 --> 00:06:57,079
just had a call, you could just

257
00:06:57,079 --> 00:06:57,379
add a

258
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,160
note, um, book a follow-up.

259
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:05,019
They are interested, but low on

260
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:07,170
funds, right?

261
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:10,779
So now you send that and

262
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:12,329
it'll be just for your eyes,

263
00:07:12,329 --> 00:07:12,839
right?

264
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:14,550
So, but you know, the context of

265
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,319
what happened on the call before

266
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:18,149
having to go and listen to the

267
00:07:18,149 --> 00:07:19,430
whole recording.

268
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:20,290
All right.

269
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:22,040
So, so yeah, if you got any

270
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:22,839
questions,

271
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:24,540
about anything else regarding

272
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:26,170
this, this section of go high

273
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:28,759
level, let me know, but yeah, see

274
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:28,839
you in

275
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:29,199
the next one.
