1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,060
All right, in this video we're

2
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:04,209
going to go over how to sign up

3
00:00:04,549 --> 00:00:06,480
for Google High Level.

4
00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:07,389
So obviously the first thing

5
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:08,410
you're going to do is you're going

6
00:00:08,419 --> 00:00:09,720
to click the link below this

7
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:10,279
video.

8
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:11,289
It's going to take you to this

9
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:12,050
page right here.

10
00:00:12,089 --> 00:00:14,380
So all you have to do is click the

11
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:16,210
14-day free trial.

12
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:17,660
You're going to put your name,

13
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:19,260
email, phone number, and then your

14
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:20,530
card information for the trial

15
00:00:20,739 --> 00:00:21,199
details.

16
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:23,059
So if we put our company name.

17
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:38,740
Okay, we go to step two.

18
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:41,560
Oh, let me just put a real email.

19
00:00:41,649 --> 00:00:50,340
We go to step two.

20
00:00:50,369 --> 00:00:52,609
And then you're just going to

21
00:00:52,609 --> 00:00:55,549
select the 97 starter plan or the

22
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:56,789
297.

23
00:00:56,829 --> 00:00:58,210
So the difference between these

24
00:00:58,210 --> 00:00:59,649
two is the 97 starter plans is

25
00:00:59,649 --> 00:01:00,630
going to give you three

26
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:01,479
subaccounts.

27
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,240
Okay, so a subaccount essentially

28
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,959
means that you have one account,

29
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:06,849
which is the main Go High Level

30
00:01:06,849 --> 00:01:07,650
license.

31
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,819
And then under your Go High Level

32
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:12,230
account, you can have subaccounts

33
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:14,010
for yourself or clients or

34
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:15,659
anything like that.

35
00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:17,590
So for starting out, I recommend

36
00:01:17,689 --> 00:01:19,810
the $97 starter plan just because

37
00:01:20,019 --> 00:01:21,680
you don't need really more than

38
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,079
three subaccounts.

39
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:25,019
And if you start using High Level

40
00:01:25,019 --> 00:01:26,400
for your clients and you're

41
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,260
providing them with subaccounts,

42
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,150
then you can go ahead and go into

43
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:32,439
the 297 unlimited plan, which

44
00:01:32,439 --> 00:01:33,939
gives you unlimited subaccounts.

45
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:35,590
Okay, so just put your card

46
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:37,890
information, accept these things,

47
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,920
and then just start the trial.

48
00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:44,530
So in the next video, we're going

49
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:46,540
to go over how to import our

50
00:01:46,579 --> 00:01:48,280
agency snapshots.

51
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:49,989
You can start using Go High Level

52
00:01:49,989 --> 00:01:51,450
with a website landing page

53
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:53,099
automations already set up for

54
00:01:53,099 --> 00:01:53,560
you.
