you're gonna see your logo here

18
00:00:33,109 --> 00:00:35,280
and this button should be in your

00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:36,939
business color now if they're not

20
00:00:36,969 --> 00:00:38,619

change the ideal client section

25
00:00:47,179 --> 00:00:48,929
or just delete it if you prefer to

26
00:00:48,929 --> 00:00:50,869
remove it then the headline should

27
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,130
be something either

28
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,240

outcome without pain point okay

33
00:01:03,009 --> 00:01:04,480
there's a two solid

34
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,719
frameworks for a headline and then

35
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:08,420
the sub headline just read

36
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:10,280

00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,519
what i did is just add my youtube

182
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:19,750

and that's it for the landing page

186
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,610
now the website i made it simple

187
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:30,990
because i don't think it makes

188
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:33,839
sense for you guys to just work a

189
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,339
ton on making a perfect website

190
00:05:35,339 --> 00:05:37,019
because honestly you don't really

191
00:05:37,019 --> 00:05:39,120
need it yet it's good to have a

192
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:40,259
website because it shows that

193
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:41,589
you're real business but you don't

194
00:05:41,589 --> 00:05:43,199
need to have this incredible

195
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:43,600
website

196
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:44,899
off the bat landing page i think

197
00:05:44,899 --> 00:05:46,389
is more important than the website

198
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:47,600
so the website looks like this is

199
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:47,920
super

200
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:49,579
simple okay so what you need to

201
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,379
change is again the sub headline

202
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,959
and the headline you want to add

203
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:53,060
your

204
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,240
explainer video here the metrics

205
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,360
similar as in the landing page and

206
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,040
this is similar thing as the

207
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:00,589
comparison as before the old way

208
00:06:00,589 --> 00:06:02,060
so people what people are doing

209
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,230
wrong now and what you do

210
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:03,949
differently

211
00:06:04,129 --> 00:06:05,740
or benefits of working with you

212
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,139
then here you want to add a

213
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:08,160
headline as well

214
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:10,519
you can keep this as is if it

215
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:12,819
applies to your business and then

216
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:15,560
a three-step breakdown of your

217
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:17,350
process step one we do this step

218
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:19,060
two we do that step three you get

219
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:21,019
outcome okay and here we have a

220
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,319
survey same as the same one that

221
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:25,689
we have the landing page and then

222
00:06:25,689 --> 00:06:27,680
here just faqs which you can edit

223
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:27,790
the

224
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,569
same exact way as before okay now

225
00:06:30,569 --> 00:06:33,230
we have other pages we have an

226
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:34,959
application page

227
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,980
let me just save that we have an

228
00:06:38,069 --> 00:06:40,829
applications page where people

229
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:42,160
again it'll just be the

230
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:42,759
application

231
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:44,379
you can add more photos and videos

232
00:06:44,379 --> 00:06:45,839
if you want but i think keeping it

233
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:46,540
simple works

234
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,180
then how it works again it's just

235
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:51,439
our explainer video with a call to

236
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:52,800
action to go and book a call that

237
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:54,920
will go to the booking page then

238
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:59,720
the booking page is just the page

239
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,160
with your calendar again you can

240
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:03,509
edit the headline here if you'd

241
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:07,319
like the call confirmation a video

242
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,360
same as in the landing page

243
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:12,920
version just the video explaining

244
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,149
what's going to happen here we

245
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:16,079
have some text just about you know

246
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,560
that we're excited for the call

247
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,980
you want to add results in here

248
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,560
and some youtube videos in here

249
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:24,420
and i mean the way to do that just

250
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:26,040
in case you don't know how to add

251
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,439

252
00:07:27,589 --> 00:07:29,230
on it just change the link and

253
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:31,839
you're good to go then results you

254
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:34,149
want to make sure you have a page

255
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,000
with results on your website so

256
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,889
you just want to fill this out and

257
00:07:37,889 --> 00:07:40,639
change the images okay just

258
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:41,279
explain

259
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,160
so outcome so what was the result

260
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,220
sub headline it could be the time

261
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:47,199
frame or what industry the client

262
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,610

265
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:51,029
