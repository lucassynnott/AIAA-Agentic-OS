1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,050
All right, in this module, we're

2
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:02,640
going to cover pipeline setup and

3
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:03,000
management.

4
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:04,639
So I created a pipeline for you

5
00:00:04,809 --> 00:00:06,469
guys already in this snapshot.

6
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:08,460
It includes the newly discovery

7
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,060
book, demo book, no show,

8
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:10,730
canceled,

9
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,939
follow up, deal closed, and deal

10
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:14,750
lost.

11
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,579
Now, you can edit this if you

12
00:00:17,579 --> 00:00:18,460
want.

13
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:19,960
If you want to edit it, you can

14
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,179
click here in pipelines.

15
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:22,600
You can actually create as many

16
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,899
new pipelines as you want it

17
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,370
in case you have multiple products

18
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:26,399
or things like that.

19
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,469
But to edit this pipeline, you're

20
00:00:28,629 --> 00:00:30,179
going to click here on the pencil

21
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:30,500
icon.

22
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,000
And here you can change the name,

23
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
new lead, new prospect,

24
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,829
whatever you want to call it, and

25
00:00:36,829 --> 00:00:38,700
remove any sections

26
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:40,320
that you don't feel like you need

27
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,280
or add new ones.

28
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:42,420
So just click add stage, and you

29
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:43,250
can add a new stage.

30
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:47,149
Then you click save, and all the

31
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:51,640
changes you make will be added.

32
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:53,750
Now, when it comes to managing the

33
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:55,420
leads and moving around,

34
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:57,000
so they'll automatically be moved

35
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,359
based on what happens with a lead.

36
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:00,439
So, for example, if they book a

37
00:01:00,439 --> 00:01:01,200
discovery or a demo,

38
00:01:01,299 --> 00:01:02,429
they'll get moved to that stage.

39
00:01:02,539 --> 00:01:04,400
But afterwards, you need to update

40
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:05,909
it based on what happens.

41
00:01:06,069 --> 00:01:07,230
So if they no show, just move them

42
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:07,599
here.

43
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,030
If they book a follow-up, move

44
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:09,700
them here.

45
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:11,620
If they close, move them here.

46
00:01:11,709 --> 00:01:13,060
If you lose them, move them here.

47
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:14,439
Okay, pretty simple.

48
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:17,189
And if you want to add any notes

49
00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:19,060
to the opportunity,

50
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,409
you can just click here and add

51
00:01:21,459 --> 00:01:23,810
any notes that you want to add.

52
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:25,819
Okay.

53
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,579
Save it, and it'll be right there.

54
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,090
And if you want to add tasks, you

55
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,290
could also add tasks for each

56
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:31,659
lead.

57
00:01:31,769 --> 00:01:37,959
Save it.

58
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,090
That'll be right there.

59
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,069
Okay.

60
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:42,390
You can also book appointments,

61
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:43,260
manage payments.

62
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:44,230
Okay.

63
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:45,549
You can create an estimate or

64
00:01:45,609 --> 00:01:47,060
create an invoice if you want,

65
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:48,599
once you have Stripe connected.

66
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,250
And add any other details like

67
00:01:50,409 --> 00:01:51,959
tags and stuff like that.

68
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:52,569
Okay.

69
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,640
We just click update.

70
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:54,840
And it'll get updated.

71
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:57,290
Now, if you want to edit what

72
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:59,680
shows up in the card itself,

73
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:02,760
let's see where the card went.

74
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:03,730
I'll just refresh.

75
00:02:03,829 --> 00:02:18,139
Okay.

76
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:18,750
Got moved here.

77
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:20,860
I'll just keep it here for now.

78
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,680
But if you want to make any

79
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,750
changes to the card itself,

80
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:25,949
you can open it up.

81
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:28,610
Or sorry, not open it up, but go

82
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,590
here to manage fields.

83
00:02:30,699 --> 00:02:32,250
And here you could change how the

84
00:02:32,409 --> 00:02:33,520
card looks itself.

85
00:02:33,659 --> 00:02:34,789
So you can see we have all of

86
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,449
these fields added,

87
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:39,509
the source, the value, the last

88
00:02:39,509 --> 00:02:40,580
reason, right?

89
00:02:40,699 --> 00:02:42,189
So whenever, as you update those

90
00:02:42,189 --> 00:02:42,699
fields,

91
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,759
it'll show up in the card itself.

92
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,009
But if you feel like you only need

93
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:46,860
the business name,

94
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,860
the source, and the owner, right?

95
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:50,780
Or the name of the opportunity,

96
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,180
you can just remove these things.

97
00:02:52,849 --> 00:02:54,030
As you can see, the card changes

98
00:02:54,099 --> 00:02:55,280
and gets smaller.

99
00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:55,819
Okay.

100
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:56,990
If you want to add more details,

101
00:02:57,099 --> 00:02:59,479
create it on last status change,

102
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,300
stuff like that, or contact

103
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,120
details,

104
00:03:02,219 --> 00:03:03,770
you could add those here.

105
00:03:03,939 --> 00:03:05,939
Just select, you know, what you

106
00:03:05,939 --> 00:03:06,520
want to add.

107
00:03:07,139 --> 00:03:09,860
And it'll update it for you.

108
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,509
You can make a compact card if you

109
00:03:11,669 --> 00:03:12,159
prefer,

110
00:03:12,259 --> 00:03:14,129
unlabeled, where you don't really

111
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:14,919
have any type of,

112
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:17,740
you know, what's the word?

113
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,389
These things right here.

114
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:23,639
And yeah, if you want to edit

115
00:03:23,669 --> 00:03:24,430
these,

116
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:25,259
that's how you do it.

117
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,900
Now, another thing you could do

118
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,879
is add custom opportunity fields.

119
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:30,919
So to do that, you go to settings,

120
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,020
you go to custom fields, okay?

121
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,439
And you can create add field

122
00:03:35,539 --> 00:03:38,909
where let's say, for example,

123
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,379
it's going to be a dropdown.

124
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:43,949
Okay, so here it could be a

125
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,900
product, right?

126
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,199
See what product you're interested

127
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:49,340
in.

128
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:50,870
If you have multiple products you

129
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:51,219
sell,

130
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:52,719
so it could be done for you.

131
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:59,800
It could be a one-time setup,

132
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,979
or it could be consulting.

133
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:07,780
So to do this

134
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:10,169
and turn this into an opportunity

135
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:10,819
field,

136
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:12,050
just click here in object

137
00:04:12,219 --> 00:04:13,520
and change it to opportunity.

138
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,479
Okay, you save it.

139
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,170
Oh, you're going to group it,

140
00:04:17,379 --> 00:04:18,310
so opportunity details.

141
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,620
You save it,

142
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:21,290
and then once you go back to the

143
00:04:21,449 --> 00:04:22,040
pipeline,

144
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:27,959
okay, you'll be able to see that

145
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:28,759
field right here,

146
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:31,199
and you can select, you know,

147
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:34,279
what the product they're

148
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:35,300
interested in

149
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:36,519
or a prospect for.

150
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,839
All right, and then if you go

151
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:39,279
here,

152
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:43,839
you could make sure it shows up.

153
00:04:43,939 --> 00:04:46,620
So let's just find here.

154
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,259
So it's not showing up,

155
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,680
but it should.

156
00:04:59,779 --> 00:05:02,040
Let me just refresh the page

157
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:02,879
again.

158
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:04,500
Sometimes high-level can be a

159
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,300
little bit buggy.

160
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:14,829
It's in here.

161
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:17,959
So if we've managed the fields.

162
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:22,500
Product.

163
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,939
Okay, so we click save.

164
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:27,829
Now we can see the product is done

165
00:05:28,269 --> 00:05:29,660
for you.

166
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:30,970
Okay, so now you can have your

167
00:05:31,029 --> 00:05:31,980
custom product in there.

168
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,069
Okay, if you prefer to see it as a

169
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:34,350
list,

170
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,040
you can click here,

171
00:05:35,139 --> 00:05:36,029
and it'll just show up as a list

172
00:05:36,139 --> 00:05:37,459
if it's easier for you guys.

173
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,319
And yeah,

174
00:05:39,389 --> 00:05:40,050
if you guys want to add an

175
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:40,920
opportunity manually,

176
00:05:41,019 --> 00:05:42,060
just click add opportunity,

177
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:42,860
fill out the details,

178
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:44,779
and it'll be created.

179
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:46,029
Okay, so that's pretty much

180
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,639
how you manage the pipeline

181
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:48,420
and go high-level.

182
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:50,360
Very simple and intuitive,

183
00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:50,939
in my opinion.

184
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,879
But yeah,

185
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:54,110
if you guys have any questions

186
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:54,779
about this,

187
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:55,389
just reach out.

188
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:56,160
Okay.
