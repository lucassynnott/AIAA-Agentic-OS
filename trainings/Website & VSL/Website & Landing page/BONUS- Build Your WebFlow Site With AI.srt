10
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:12,410
process

11
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:13,839

00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:16,480
builders but honestly none of them

14
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,559
have been very good until now so

15
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:20,800
uh webflow just launched their ai

16
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,859
website builder and today i'm

17
00:00:23,149 --> 00:00:25,019
going to build a quick site with

18
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:27,250
you guys to show you what this can

19
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:29,280
look like so i'll put the url

20
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:30,649
to access this in uh the

21
00:00:30,649 --> 00:00:32,770
description but basically just go

22
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:34,479
to the ai site builder here who

23
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:34,979
are you

24
00:00:35,259 --> 00:00:36,000
building for for us obviously

25
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,140
we're building for a business i'm

26
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:38,380
going to use my own business going

27
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:38,460

28
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,960
say innovative i'm going to go

29
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,640
next they want some details right

30
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,100
who's our audience makes the

31
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:43,259
business

32
00:00:43,549 --> 00:00:45,060
unique uh they have an example

33
00:00:45,219 --> 00:00:46,929
there you know about it so i'm

34
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:48,960
just use chat gbt that knows a bit

35
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:49,200
of my

36
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:50,600
business to generate a basic

37
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,149
description so we're going to go

38
00:00:52,149 --> 00:00:53,869
back here and we're going to paste

39
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:54,140
this

40
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,390
in right now it actually has to

41
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:57,039
put in 5 000 words which is a lot

42
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:58,240
so you can prompt this pretty

43
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:58,560
deeply

44
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:00,109
but uh let's go ahead with this

45
00:01:00,109 --> 00:01:01,770
i'm going to let i'm just going to

46
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,640
choose clean a professional for

47
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:05,379
this one to like a light mode sort

48
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:06,859
of one brown tone of voice ai

49
00:01:06,859 --> 00:01:08,609
suggested uh color range i like

50
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,040
blue so let's go with that we're

51
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,650
going to click generate now what's

52
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:13,060
cool is after you generate the

53
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:14,230
initial site you can actually

54
00:01:14,409 --> 00:01:15,750
generate other sections for it

55
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,180
afterwards so even if you don't

56
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:18,219
like something or there's a

57
00:01:18,219 --> 00:01:19,489
section missing or you need to add

58
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,849
more stuff no problem you can just

59
00:01:21,209 --> 00:01:22,269
click generate choose from an

60
00:01:22,269 --> 00:01:23,579
example and uh it'll it'll get

61
00:01:23,579 --> 00:01:25,000
added so i'll show you guys this

62
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:25,370
now now

63
00:01:25,469 --> 00:01:26,129
you'll probably still have to

64
00:01:26,129 --> 00:01:26,909
write the copy yourself that's

65
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:27,799
something you're still gonna have

66
00:01:27,909 --> 00:01:29,329
to do but you know this still gets

67
00:01:29,329 --> 00:01:30,870
you the majority of the site done

68
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:32,989
it's mobile optimized too this is

69
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:34,189
super super handy and it's going

70
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:35,670
to speed up actually making a nice

71
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:38,140
looking website super super quick

72
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:38,260
it's

73
00:01:38,609 --> 00:01:39,750
going to be great so um let's take

74
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,060
a look at this now see what this

75
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:43,299
does all right we're back for

76
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:45,099
reference that took i'd say

77
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:47,599
approximately 30 seconds to a

78
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:49,780
minute maybe max uh but we've got

79
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:51,579
the base of our site here now uh

80
00:01:51,579 --> 00:01:53,379
again like i said this doesn't

81
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:55,340
follow the exact format that we

82
00:01:55,549 --> 00:01:56,469
teach in c8 that's no problem so

83
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:57,489
i'm going to show you guys how

84
00:01:57,489 --> 00:02:00,480
this works so uh there's tons of

85
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:00,510
you

86
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:02,180
can change you can change the

87
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,769
colors you can change on the

88
00:02:03,769 --> 00:02:05,689
overall theme of the site um just

89
00:02:05,689 --> 00:02:05,959
there you

90
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:06,890
click a button and it changes so

91
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:07,760
let's say i like this one actually

92
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,819
we're gonna go with this like

93
00:02:09,099 --> 00:02:10,580
super like kind of gray and white

94
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:12,139
sort of sort of theme um let's

95
00:02:12,139 --> 00:02:13,780
check this one out too and see

96
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:14,870
what this is like i actually kind

97
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:15,840
of like this one too all right

98
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,020
let's go with this one actually

99
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:17,180
this

100
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,520
is a nice little change up right

101
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,800
so we're gonna go with this um i

102
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,219
like these buttons a lot these

103
00:02:21,509 --> 00:02:22,639
buttons are really nice um over

104
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:24,210
here you can change the typography

105
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:26,060
so you can change you know the the

106
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:27,509
fonts that you want you can give

107
00:02:27,509 --> 00:02:29,009
it a different look whatever you

108
00:02:29,009 --> 00:02:31,319
want to do um almost cool to me

109
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:32,909
uh you can change the colors of

110
00:02:32,909 --> 00:02:34,349
the sections this is where you

111
00:02:34,349 --> 00:02:35,800
change like i can see kind of like

112
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:35,900
the

113
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:37,650
layout so you can have like just

114
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:39,389
the top section this one kind of

115
00:02:39,389 --> 00:02:41,080
changes up here uh you can just

116
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:43,270
show what it looks like yeah okay

117
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:45,270
let's go with this like this all

118
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:47,389
right uh you can do accent you can

119
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:49,000
think so i can do it like a color

120
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,360
if i want so i can do that you

121
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,620
know something on those lines um

122
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:54,719
but i kind of like the inverse

123
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,900
ones let's go with uh let's just

124
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,780
go with this i think this is kind

125
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:00,759
of a nice symbol thing you can

126
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:03,169
choose the images uh the different

127
00:03:03,169 --> 00:03:05,449
kind of styles so let's go with a

128
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,259
nice cool dim lighting i think

129
00:03:07,419 --> 00:03:09,360
that's a cool style and uh these

130
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,719
are all ai generated obviously um

131
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,889
i'm gonna check out the modern one

132
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:15,039
too actually i want to see what

133
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:16,719
this is like so let's see what

134
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,520
this does um it's just doing all

135
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,569
the images now there you go it is

136
00:03:20,569 --> 00:03:22,430
very dark and moody let's go with

137
00:03:22,729 --> 00:03:24,240
dramatic or dramatic light so let

138
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,099
that do that change the buttons

139
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:28,060
how you want them to i as i said

140
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,500
like the buttons as they are i

141
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,000
think well that's pretty sexy

142
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
let's check that one actually

143
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,159
let's

144
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,669
go to the other one do like that

145
00:03:34,669 --> 00:03:36,370
all right we're gonna go with that

146
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:37,939
uh the forms the cards you can

147
00:03:38,229 --> 00:03:39,400
change uh just how they kind of

148
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,870
look in general so so you want a

149
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:42,449
real poppy you know kind of like

150
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:44,969
a comic book-y sort of one um kind

151
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:47,400
of super clean uh i kind of just

152
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,479
like the basic one with a bit

153
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,009
of a shadow i think i don't want

154
00:03:51,009 --> 00:03:52,490
to go super crazy with this uh

155
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:54,099
it's like it's kind of clean and

156
00:03:54,389 --> 00:03:55,900
simple so let's just do that and

157
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:58,060
uh they can change the roundness

158
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:00,300
of the corners on on different

159
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:01,669
things you have it square you can

160
00:04:01,669 --> 00:04:02,990
have it fully rounded but i like

161
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:04,460
it how it is so let's go so

162
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,069
now we're going to start building

163
00:04:06,069 --> 00:04:07,539
now we're in the actual webflow

164
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:09,240
editor here's where we can change

165
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:11,039
things right uh you know text and

166
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:12,650
stuff but i want to talk about

167
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,439
adding new sections so you know as

168
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:14,780
we

169
00:04:15,069 --> 00:04:15,889
mentioned like one of the first

170
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:16,990
things you want to do after your

171
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,240
hero section which obviously you

172
00:04:18,379 --> 00:04:19,069
have like a vsl or something

173
00:04:19,069 --> 00:04:20,040
instead of an image you also kind

174
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,910
of edit those sort of things but

175
00:04:22,009 --> 00:04:22,459
uh

176
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,550
yeah let's say we want to replace

177
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:24,649
the hero section right we want to

178
00:04:24,649 --> 00:04:26,129
do we need to deal with a video

179
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,470
we're going to click here we're

180
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:28,810
going to click this purple add a

181
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:29,579
section button

182
00:04:29,709 --> 00:04:30,709
now it'll bring you to the bottom

183
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,040
of the page it's totally fine it's

184
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,120
going to accept the terms

185
00:04:33,259 --> 00:04:34,670
and conditions here and you've got

186
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:36,350
different categories for different

187
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:37,399
layouts let's do hero

188
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,860
it's going to generate a few

189
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:42,899
wireframe options for us right so

190
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:44,160
as we mentioned we obviously want

191
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:44,319
one

192
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,470
like kind of a video option here

193
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:48,449
so that's where we put a video

194
00:04:48,449 --> 00:04:51,120
into uh this looks like it could

195
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:51,420
work

196
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:52,910
what else would be good that

197
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:54,560
obviously could work again we're

198
00:04:54,649 --> 00:04:56,240
going to add these a little bit

199
00:04:56,529 --> 00:04:57,600
afterwards so it doesn't have to

200
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,050
be a hundred percent perfect we're

201
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:00,600
just looking for one that we think

202
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:02,399
is kind of nice and goes overall

203
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,420
uh with kind of what we're what

204
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:08,040
we're looking for um i would say

205
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:09,790
we're going to go with yeah i like

206
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:11,449
this one let's do this one right

207
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:13,160
so we're going to click this

208
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:14,750
and it's going to generate the

209
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,750
section down here there we go so

210
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,779
obviously you replace this with a

211
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:21,209
video box but let's just move this

212
00:05:21,209 --> 00:05:23,110
up to the very top and we'll

213
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:26,420
delete this one so obviously here

214
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:26,500
you

215
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:28,720
can click it and change everything

216
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,389
how you want it to um you can

217
00:05:30,389 --> 00:05:32,600
replace this with a video all that

218
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,040
sort of stuff then the next

219
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,689
section would be like you know a

220
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:37,439
uh a pain point section right so

221
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:38,139
let's say

222
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:39,269
do a pain point section obviously

223
00:05:39,449 --> 00:05:40,600
there's not going to be a section

224
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,579
here titled pain points

225
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,379
but they will have something we

226
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:45,149
can repurpose so let's say

227
00:05:45,149 --> 00:05:47,160
features features are usually

228
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:47,569
lists

229
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,360
or blocks or sect or kind of you

230
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,290
know multiple cards so let's look

231
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:52,810
through here and let's find

232
00:05:53,149 --> 00:05:54,689
one that we can use uh yeah this

233
00:05:54,689 --> 00:05:56,610
will work right so the three three

234
00:05:56,709 --> 00:05:58,740
pain points let's choose this one

235
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,360
now again the copies are going to

236
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,980
be the exact copy you want you'll

237
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:03,420
obviously change that up but

238
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,209
that's really nice i really like

239
00:06:05,209 --> 00:06:06,819
that so let's take that and put

240
00:06:06,829 --> 00:06:08,379
that up underneath our hero

241
00:06:08,379 --> 00:06:08,649
section

242
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:09,970
uh again you can reduce the

243
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:11,230
padding and stuff you can add a

244
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:12,699
headline everything you want to do

245
00:06:12,699 --> 00:06:13,050
there

246
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:17,379
uh then let us go to okay

247
00:06:17,379 --> 00:06:19,029
sometimes it does glitch out a

248
00:06:19,029 --> 00:06:20,620
little bit as you saw there it

249
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:21,259
wasn't removing

250
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:22,540
the thing after i did it that's

251
00:06:22,569 --> 00:06:23,980
totally fine i just clicked out of

252
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,449
it and then i hit escape and i hit

253
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,199
plus and i did back to the same

254
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,129
generator again so uh after that

255
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,060
we usually have a why choose us

256
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,389
so you know uh technically

257
00:06:32,389 --> 00:06:33,910
something like this actually

258
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:35,569
already works let's move this

259
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:36,100
further up

260
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:38,560
um so after the pain points we'll

261
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,959
have the why choose us move us up

262
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:44,139
here uh actually before we do this

263
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:45,600
let's do a testimonial that's one

264
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,959
of the sections i actually have

265
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:50,129
here so add a section of ai let's

266
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:50,259
do

267
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,389
a testimonial

268
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:55,850
and let's go away from like these

269
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:57,370
kind of boxes a little bit we've

270
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:59,399
done a few of them so let's find a

271
00:06:59,649 --> 00:07:01,120
nice layout that we like let's say

272
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,350
one of these big feature

273
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:04,199
testimonials right let's do that

274
00:07:04,449 --> 00:07:06,300
let's use a few extra sections

275
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,569
here we can delete these too so

276
00:07:08,569 --> 00:07:10,899
that's done so let's get rid of

277
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:11,199
that

278
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,199
and that and that and that that's

279
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:16,879
this further up the page to

280
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:20,269
i think it was here so we can

281
00:07:20,269 --> 00:07:22,069
delete these two sections we don't

282
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:22,720
need these

283
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:26,259
all right now let's do a three

284
00:07:26,259 --> 00:07:30,410
part this is another kind of basic

285
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:33,500
test so i don't like that

286
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:34,829
let's do a basic uh three part

287
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:36,389
book a call section right so we're

288
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:38,689
going to go add section uh if

289
00:07:38,709 --> 00:07:38,759
click

290
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,029
show more you'll see there is more

291
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,139
different sections here you can

292
00:07:41,139 --> 00:07:42,459
choose from uh i'm just

293
00:07:42,589 --> 00:07:43,589
repurposing a lot of stuff because

294
00:07:43,769 --> 00:07:44,920
i think it's like the easiest way

295
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,519
to do it but uh let's do

296
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:48,959
again features because again we

297
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:50,610
need kind of cards or boxes um so

298
00:07:50,689 --> 00:07:52,899
again this is going to be the

299
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:53,100
three

300
00:07:53,329 --> 00:07:54,579
part uh book a call section this

301
00:07:54,579 --> 00:07:56,040
one actually has a ct already in

302
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,439
it so i'll show you what we'll do

303
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:57,680
here

304
00:07:57,930 --> 00:07:59,199
let's choose this one

305
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:02,490
generating

306
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:07,439
and then all we have to do really

307
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:08,240
is

308
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:12,680
delete delete delete

309
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:15,540
great there we go done right so

310
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:17,040
this is our three part you know

311
00:08:17,329 --> 00:08:20,709
uh yeah it's like probably the

312
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:21,709
headline actually not by headline

313
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,139
so all right so then we do a three

314
00:08:23,339 --> 00:08:24,939
part book a call um let's take

315
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:28,860
this move further up here put the

316
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:31,500
faq let's move the faq right

317
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:34,240
yeah above the footer

318
00:08:34,529 --> 00:08:38,668
all right so we got these are

319
00:08:38,668 --> 00:08:40,700
three part book a call uh you know

320
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,460
then you do like a watch you get

321
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,279
that'll work for what you get

322
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:44,200
section you know you can explain

323
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,299
there in detail what they're going

324
00:08:45,299 --> 00:08:45,360
to

325
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,490
get uh you could have a pricing

326
00:08:46,669 --> 00:08:48,029
table you don't need to obviously

327
00:08:48,029 --> 00:08:49,779
we don't usually do pricing tables

328
00:08:49,909 --> 00:08:51,580
so you know just boom delete that

329
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:53,190
uh then we don't need to get in

330
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:54,960
touch or anything like that

331
00:08:55,289 --> 00:08:57,740
uh let's do a like team section

332
00:08:58,019 --> 00:08:59,059
section or about you or something

333
00:08:59,059 --> 00:09:02,659
like that right so let's go to

334
00:09:02,659 --> 00:09:03,480
team

335
00:09:03,769 --> 00:09:12,120
let's see if we'll choose

336
00:09:12,409 --> 00:09:15,519
let's look at different wireframes

337
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,480
and what ones we like

338
00:09:16,769 --> 00:09:20,539
let's just go with

339
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:23,870
with this one so that'll do like a

340
00:09:23,909 --> 00:09:25,210
basic team section

341
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:27,019
there you go

342
00:09:27,309 --> 00:09:37,559
there it is again you're just the

343
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:39,240
uh you know the which got potting

344
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,879
is without yourself manually as i

345
00:09:41,169 --> 00:09:44,419
explain in different tutorials and

346
00:09:44,419 --> 00:09:47,340
our team faq and then obviously

347
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:48,620
you would add your colony as we've

348
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:49,450
kind of like talked about in the

349
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:52,009
past so like again uh or actually

350
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:53,059
let's do another one actually

351
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,820
well there's one there i like they

352
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,210
do stats so let's do a stats

353
00:09:56,289 --> 00:09:56,789
section

354
00:09:57,090 --> 00:10:00,320
go show more

355
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:03,360
do this one

356
00:10:03,649 --> 00:10:09,700
perfect so we're gonna move this

357
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,279
up right below the hero section

358
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:12,960
so there it goes that's basically

359
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,519
it we've got the basically edit

360
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:16,080
the site done uh obviously i

361
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:16,159
haven't

362
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:17,490
done any editing on this just very

363
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:18,779
very minor so obviously you want

364
00:10:18,779 --> 00:10:20,240
to go in and fix some things up

365
00:10:20,379 --> 00:10:21,669
and change all the copy and update

366
00:10:21,669 --> 00:10:23,100
everything but let's say you want

367
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,480
to change uh large things right

368
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,279
like you want to change the uh

369
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:29,700
typography you just click into the

370
00:10:30,009 --> 00:10:31,750
typography and you can choose

371
00:10:32,009 --> 00:10:34,000
the different uh styles and size

372
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,059
and change up the whole kind of

373
00:10:36,059 --> 00:10:38,159
look and feel of the site so i

374
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:39,440
actually do like that one so let's

375
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:40,580
go with that right and they got

376
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:41,830
different ones here as well just

377
00:10:42,129 --> 00:10:44,409
different uh headings and fonts

378
00:10:44,409 --> 00:10:49,409
and types um and uh some creative

379
00:10:49,409 --> 00:10:50,159
ones here

380
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:52,039
you know you can do whatever but

381
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,909
uh overall that's uh that's kind

382
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,429
of how this works you can change

383
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:56,649
up all the settings we saw at the

384
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:57,980
beginning over here even change

385
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,120
the colors for this the whole

386
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:00,440
section we can choose from

387
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,889
different palettes so we can

388
00:11:01,889 --> 00:11:03,559
choose slightly kind of lighter

389
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:04,240
blue sort

390
00:11:04,379 --> 00:11:06,509
of one choose a darker blue choose

391
00:11:06,509 --> 00:11:08,679
a whole different uh like orange

392
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,450
and teal and stuff and we'll get

393
00:11:10,769 --> 00:11:12,000
different colors throughout the

394
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,320
page uh so let's say let's change

395
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,470
let's choose this copilot one

396
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,950
and then let's change up the uh

397
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:23,950
section colors so let's do this so

398
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:26,399
there we go we've got a nice

399
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:27,460
different layout now for

400
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:31,350
everything uh and uh super easy to

401
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:34,720
do uh takes two seconds and

402
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,190
obviously this

403
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:37,000
gives you an amazing base now to

404
00:11:37,159 --> 00:11:39,070
edit from again uh probably not

405
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:40,419
going to be a one shot where

406
00:11:40,419 --> 00:11:40,639
you're

407
00:11:40,889 --> 00:11:41,769
going to do this once and it's

408
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:43,279
going to be absolutely perfect but

409
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:44,799
it's going to give you a

410
00:11:45,019 --> 00:11:46,779
way easier starting point and it

411
00:11:46,779 --> 00:11:48,990
should be mobile optimized largely

412
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:50,480
as well you'll have to do a

413
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:52,120
little bit of editing but it's 10

414
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,500
times easier for anyone that's

415
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,159
designed in my flow can tell how

416
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:55,360
much

417
00:11:55,649 --> 00:11:57,370
easier uh this seems than uh

418
00:11:57,370 --> 00:11:59,799
having to do everything yourself

419
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:02,799
from scratch uh so i'm going to

420
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:03,200
work on some

421
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:04,210
prompts for this for you guys too

422
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:05,120
so if you're going to find a bit

423
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:06,220
more and get it closer to like a

424
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:06,399
one

425
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:07,759
shot but um for now i think this

426
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:09,210
is actually an incredible tool

427
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:10,639
again check the description in

428
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,419
the link below uh for a link to

429
00:12:12,419 --> 00:12:14,269
the site where you can try this

430
00:12:14,269 --> 00:12:16,960
out in webflow and uh i think this

431
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:17,039
is

432
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,769
going to be really handy for a lot

433
00:12:18,769 --> 00:12:20,309
of you guys um this a lot of the

434
00:12:20,309 --> 00:12:22,080
questions you get are like how do

435
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:22,159
i

436
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:23,580
make a nice looking site you know

437
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:24,889
i think this is definitely the

438
00:12:24,889 --> 00:12:26,480
first step to that um you know

439
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:26,799
having a

440
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:27,909
side like that is going to be i

441
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:28,919
think also even does like

442
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:30,320
animations and stuff a little bit

443
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,120
uh

444
00:12:31,409 --> 00:12:34,149
got it um yeah look at that see

445
00:12:34,149 --> 00:12:37,029
that how nice that is and i didn't

446
00:12:37,029 --> 00:12:39,519
do any of that no so like you know

447
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:41,750
like hover interactions and stuff

448
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,440
um you know overall this is

449
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,600
there's a little thing there too

450
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,230
you know

451
00:12:46,429 --> 00:12:48,710
uh this is a an extremely i think

452
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:51,269
powerful way to uh get the start

453
00:12:51,269 --> 00:12:53,990
of your site started and to uh get

454
00:12:54,129 --> 00:12:55,019
you know most of the way there

455
00:12:55,019 --> 00:12:56,159
with it 80 of the way or so and

456
00:12:56,159 --> 00:12:57,669
mobile optimized things super easy

457
00:12:57,769 --> 00:12:58,320
so

458
00:12:58,429 --> 00:12:59,750
uh yeah please mess around with

459
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,139
this let me know how it's going

460
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:02,759
for you and try it out a bit and

461
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:03,500
uh

462
00:13:03,789 --> 00:13:04,710
yeah just uh i'll be doing a lot

463
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:06,070
more training on this and you can

464
00:13:06,149 --> 00:13:07,360
