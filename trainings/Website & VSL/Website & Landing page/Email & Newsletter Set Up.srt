1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:00,480
Right.

2
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:01,490
In this one, we're going to go

3
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:02,720
over how to set up emails for your

4
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:04,269
newsletter and you can start

5
00:00:04,309 --> 00:00:05,349
sending emails to your list.

6
00:00:05,389 --> 00:00:07,089
OK, so something I want to go into

7
00:00:07,089 --> 00:00:08,599
mention before we go into the

8
00:00:08,599 --> 00:00:10,369
emails is that you could actually

9
00:00:10,369 --> 00:00:11,099
have go.

10
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:12,380
It will be like a social planner

11
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:13,759
where it automatically just post

12
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:15,000
for you and your accounts.

13
00:00:15,029 --> 00:00:16,839
If you want to use that, you got

14
00:00:16,839 --> 00:00:18,629
to just connect the accounts and

15
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,429
then just create the post and

16
00:00:20,489 --> 00:00:21,679
schedule them.

17
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:22,449
Super simple.

18
00:00:22,449 --> 00:00:23,719
I don't really use it, but I

19
00:00:23,719 --> 00:00:25,000
thought I mentioned it now to

20
00:00:25,309 --> 00:00:26,489
create the emails is going to go

21
00:00:26,489 --> 00:00:28,030
to marketing on the left hand side

22
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:29,370
and then emails up here.

23
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,329
And here you'll see different

24
00:00:32,329 --> 00:00:33,329
campaigns.

25
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,829
So there's just made up data from

26
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:35,429
high level.

27
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:36,929
But if you want to create a new

28
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:38,780
campaign, you can click there.

29
00:00:39,009 --> 00:00:40,899
So what I like to do is separate

30
00:00:40,909 --> 00:00:43,439
them by, you know, year or topic.

31
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:45,140
So, for example, if you're sending

32
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:47,009
newsletters in 2025, you just

33
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:48,079
click newsletter.

34
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,219
2025, create in that way, you can

35
00:00:51,219 --> 00:00:53,600
have all your emails in there.

36
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:54,719
OK, so we click here.

37
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,070
And if you want to create a new

38
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,750
campaign, a new email, just click

39
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:58,859
create campaign.

40
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:02,070
Blank is the ideal option, in my

41
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:04,239
opinion, just because it's just

42
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:05,819
simpler and less stuff.

43
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:07,549
But if you want to make like a

44
00:01:07,549 --> 00:01:09,140
nice email, you can select the

45
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:10,140
design editor.

46
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,140
So I click select here in the

47
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:14,939
blank option or plain text option.

48
00:01:14,969 --> 00:01:16,079
And here you can just write your

49
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:16,430
email.

50
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:17,819
Hi.

51
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:19,060
Again, contact.

52
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,900
Contact first name.

53
00:01:25,489 --> 00:01:26,769
And then you go into your email.

54
00:01:27,129 --> 00:01:27,900
Right.

55
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:31,920
And here you would click save.

56
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:33,739
You can name it whatever you want.

57
00:01:34,069 --> 00:01:35,620
Email one or the topic.

58
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:39,700
And then you could click send or

59
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:40,719
schedule.

60
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:42,319
Let's say we schedule it.

61
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:43,439
You put in your email here.

62
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:55,459
Then send their name, your name,

63
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:58,769
subject line, whatever you want it

64
00:01:59,060 --> 00:01:59,590
to be.

65
00:01:59,829 --> 00:02:01,560
You can add a pre-header text.

66
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:02,799
So something that will show before

67
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:03,959
the actual text in the email.

68
00:02:03,989 --> 00:02:05,569
So there's like a preview in the

69
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,040
email.

70
00:02:06,829 --> 00:02:08,250
And then here you could select

71
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:09,830
individual context or you can

72
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,939
create a smart list just for

73
00:02:11,939 --> 00:02:13,360
people in your email list.

74
00:02:13,389 --> 00:02:13,620
Okay.

75
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:15,330
So the way that would work is

76
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:17,270
similar to the smart list that I

77
00:02:17,419 --> 00:02:18,699
showed you before.

78
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:19,699
Right.

79
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:22,400
Where you would filter people by

80
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,330
attack.

81
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:25,370
So if we click here, we only have

82
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:27,250
these two smart lists, but we

83
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,139
create a new one that says email

84
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:29,840
list.

85
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:30,689
And I'll show you how to create

86
00:02:30,689 --> 00:02:31,439
that one in a second.

87
00:02:32,289 --> 00:02:33,939
And here you could select UTM

88
00:02:33,939 --> 00:02:34,729
tracking.

89
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,189
What that means is that it'll

90
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:37,860
track if they make, if they click

91
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:39,500
on the email to whatever link you

92
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,150
have, it'll track exactly what

93
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:42,599
email they came from and all of

94
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:43,159
that.

95
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:44,139
Okay.

96
00:02:44,189 --> 00:02:46,030
You can add tags based on certain

97
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:47,789
conditions if you want, but I

98
00:02:47,939 --> 00:02:49,340
don't really use that.

99
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:51,590
I just turn on the UTM tracking

100
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:52,669
and that's it.

101
00:02:52,909 --> 00:02:54,490
And then once the email is ready

102
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:55,919
to go, you click review and

103
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:57,729
schedule and it will schedule that

104
00:02:57,729 --> 00:02:59,349
for whatever date you want it to

105
00:02:59,349 --> 00:03:00,479
schedule it for.

106
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:00,900
Okay.

107
00:03:00,969 --> 00:03:03,270
So now let's create the email

108
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:05,080
list, smart list.

109
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:06,879
So what you're going to do is go

110
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:07,889
to contacts.

111
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:10,919
You're going to go more filters.

112
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:14,250
You're going to search up tag is

113
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:16,120
email list.

114
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:22,639
Okay.

115
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:23,599
So the tag is in here.

116
00:03:23,629 --> 00:03:24,979
So let's just create the tag like

117
00:03:24,979 --> 00:03:25,599
last time.

118
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:28,150
We're going to go to settings,

119
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:30,990
tags, and we're going to call it

120
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:32,000
email list.

121
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:43,990
So once that is done, we're going

122
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:46,169
to go back to navigation and same

123
00:03:46,169 --> 00:03:47,979
idea, filters, tag.

124
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,169
We're going to look for email

125
00:03:51,169 --> 00:03:52,139
list.

126
00:03:52,469 --> 00:03:54,949
Apply, save a smart list.

127
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,840
We click save right here.

128
00:04:02,139 --> 00:04:04,099
And now the list is here.

129
00:04:04,129 --> 00:04:05,710
So whenever a lead or a contact

130
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:07,419
has this tag, they'll be in your

131
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:08,280
email list.

132
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:09,159
Okay.

133
00:04:09,189 --> 00:04:10,590
So now let's make sure that every

134
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:11,919
new lead that comes in has that

135
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:12,490
tag in here.

136
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,969
So what we're going to do is go

137
00:04:14,969 --> 00:04:17,439
into the new lead workflow.

138
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:19,399
And right here, what we're going

139
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:21,079
to do is just add an action that

140
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:25,259
says tag, add a contact tag, and

141
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:27,149
we're going to add the email list

142
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:27,720
tag.

143
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:31,350
So I like to just mention what tag

144
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:33,310
we're adding in the action name so

145
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:34,990
that it's easy to know what's

146
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:35,800
going on.

147
00:04:36,129 --> 00:04:39,129
And that is it.

148
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:40,519
So we just click save.

149
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:44,360
And that's it.

150
00:04:44,389 --> 00:04:46,779
So now whenever you're going to

151
00:04:46,779 --> 00:04:49,560
schedule your email, let's go back

152
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,709
into marketing, emails, campaigns,

153
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:57,339
newsletter, and email one.

154
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:59,319
So whenever we're going to

155
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:01,060
schedule it, we would go down

156
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,990
here, send to smart list, email

157
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:03,579
list.

158
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:04,879
Okay.

159
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,579
Make sure you select schedule.

160
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:07,889
And down here, advanced

161
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:08,660
conditions.

162
00:05:09,029 --> 00:05:10,490
Here is just asking, should we

163
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:12,089
send the list to anyone else that

164
00:05:12,389 --> 00:05:14,189
gets added here in the future or

165
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,579
only to the people that are

166
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,250
currently in the email list?

167
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:21,259
So you want to make sure that yes,

168
00:05:21,259 --> 00:05:22,860
include anyone that gets added

169
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,550
into the account between now and

170
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:26,279
by the time the email is sent.

171
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,430
That way you never miss out on

172
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:30,079
sending it to new people.

173
00:05:30,449 --> 00:05:31,569
Okay.

174
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:33,379
So from here, again, you just fill

175
00:05:33,379 --> 00:05:34,060
this out.

176
00:05:34,389 --> 00:05:35,670
Click save.

177
00:05:36,009 --> 00:05:39,800
And you have your email scheduled.

178
00:05:39,829 --> 00:05:40,100
Okay.

179
00:05:40,129 --> 00:05:41,370
Now, another important thing is

180
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:42,540
that to make your life easier,

181
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:43,730
sometimes you may want to create

182
00:05:43,899 --> 00:05:44,370
templates.

183
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:45,040
Okay.

184
00:05:45,069 --> 00:05:46,730
So if you want to have templates

185
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:48,360
already made for you, you just

186
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:49,699
create a template.

187
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:50,670
You could design it.

188
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:52,920
You could, again, plain text and

189
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,920
just, you know, have the main

190
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,500
things that you always send

191
00:05:57,009 --> 00:05:58,180
already in there.

192
00:05:58,209 --> 00:06:00,069
So let's say you always have like

193
00:06:00,069 --> 00:06:01,509
your offer at the end of the

194
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:02,230
email.

195
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,639
So you could just add it how I can

196
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:11,240
help you get an extra 25 to 30

197
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:17,759
qualified lead in 30 days.

198
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,339
Okay.

199
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:21,610
And then you put your link here,

200
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:22,259
for example.

201
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:23,459
So every time you create a new

202
00:06:23,459 --> 00:06:25,060
email, just choose the template.

203
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:27,689
And this tool always kind of will

204
00:06:27,689 --> 00:06:28,899
be sent out.

205
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,829
It's going to name an example

206
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:31,779
template.

207
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,980
So we click save template.

208
00:06:39,189 --> 00:06:40,470
And here, if you ever want to

209
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:42,490
create a new one, you select your

210
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:44,040
templates.

211
00:06:44,259 --> 00:06:45,730
And here you'll see example

212
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:46,529
template.

213
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:47,680
So now you'll be able to create a

214
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,810
new email with the template you

215
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:49,519
just created.

216
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:50,970
All right.

217
00:06:51,259 --> 00:06:53,000
And that's pretty much it for the

218
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,300
emails and the newsletter setup.

219
00:06:55,329 --> 00:06:56,500
If you have any questions about

220
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,649
how to set this up, something

221
00:06:57,649 --> 00:06:58,959
wasn't clear, just reach out to me

222
00:06:59,100 --> 00:06:59,740
and I'll help.
