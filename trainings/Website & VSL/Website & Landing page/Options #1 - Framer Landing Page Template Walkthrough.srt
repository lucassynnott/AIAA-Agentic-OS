1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:02,109
What's up guys, Lucas Siddett, the

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:03,100
landing page coach for Client

3
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:03,759
Ascension here.

4
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,480
Today we're going to be going over

5
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:07,250
the new Framer template that I've

6
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:09,019
developed for everyone in CA.

7
00:00:09,019 --> 00:00:10,279
So some of you guys have brought

8
00:00:10,279 --> 00:00:11,410
up Framer to me in the past or

9
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:12,800
mentioned interest in using it.

10
00:00:12,919 --> 00:00:14,349
So you have asked me kind of

11
00:00:14,349 --> 00:00:16,070
what's the best platform to get

12
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:16,699
started on.

13
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:18,640
I'm going to go to start off by

14
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,579
going over kind of the answering

15
00:00:20,579 --> 00:00:21,699
that question,

16
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:22,640
essentially what I do think you

17
00:00:22,699 --> 00:00:23,679
should start with and what should

18
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:24,719
be kind of the main one you use.

19
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:27,199
For simplicity and getting started

20
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:28,559
quickly, if you have a little web

21
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:30,120
design experience, then Card is

22
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:31,250
still the easiest.

23
00:00:31,429 --> 00:00:32,719
But if you want a slightly nicer

24
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:34,320
looking website that's easier to

25
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,939
create than a Webflow site, then I

26
00:00:35,939 --> 00:00:36,780
would suggest Framer.

27
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,399
Framer is slightly cheaper than

28
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:39,289
Webflow as well.

29
00:00:39,659 --> 00:00:40,740
There's a few other benefits to

30
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:42,170
it, but you can make some really

31
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:43,179
nice sites on Framer.

32
00:00:43,299 --> 00:00:44,899
So today I'm going to go through

33
00:00:44,899 --> 00:00:46,539
the template that I've made for

34
00:00:46,539 --> 00:00:47,079
you guys.

35
00:00:47,259 --> 00:00:49,140
So all this is placeholder text.

36
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:50,320
This is just kind of general ideas

37
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,469
for what you should be putting on

38
00:00:51,469 --> 00:00:52,420
the copy on your page.

39
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:54,130
We have a whole section in the

40
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:55,890
Kajabi module on creating your

41
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:58,039
line of page copy with ChatGPT.

42
00:00:58,039 --> 00:00:59,320
So make sure you go through that.

43
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,240
But I've given you kind of

44
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,530
placeholders here for what should

45
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:02,460
be kind of included.

46
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:04,790
So it starts off with, you know,

47
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,219
your headline, your VSL, then the

48
00:01:07,219 --> 00:01:08,780
companies you worked with.

49
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:09,579
These are all placeholders.

50
00:01:09,579 --> 00:01:10,659
I'll be over these later and how

51
00:01:10,709 --> 00:01:11,290
to replace them.

52
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,909
Your pain points will be here.

53
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,640
Then why they should choose you,

54
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,409
some benefits and things there.

55
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:19,959
Big button there.

56
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:22,469
Then a testimonial here.

57
00:01:22,829 --> 00:01:24,870
The three-step process for working

58
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:25,680
with you.

59
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:28,159
What's included as part of your

60
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:29,840
service package.

61
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,790
More testimonials, what people are

62
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:32,359
saying.

63
00:01:32,609 --> 00:01:33,650
Then this will be your kind of

64
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:34,920
about you section where you'll

65
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:36,180
talk a little bit about yourself

66
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:37,349
and kind of why you started the

67
00:01:37,349 --> 00:01:37,900
company, etc.

68
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,030
And then your Calendly embed and

69
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:42,579
your FAQs down here.

70
00:01:42,579 --> 00:01:43,739
And then at the bottom here, we

71
00:01:43,739 --> 00:01:44,900
just have a footer where you can

72
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,170
either add links to other parts of

73
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:47,099
the page or you can link your

74
00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:48,579
socials and everything here.

75
00:01:48,769 --> 00:01:51,090
So I'm going to go to Framer now.

76
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:52,260
I'm just going to walk you guys

77
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:52,879
through this.

78
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:54,590
So when you log into Framer, this

79
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:56,370
is what it's going to look like.

80
00:01:56,379 --> 00:01:57,299
You're going to have these three

81
00:01:57,299 --> 00:01:57,700
screens.

82
00:01:58,099 --> 00:01:59,799
As you can see, they're labeled

83
00:01:59,799 --> 00:02:01,549
desktop, tablet, and phone.

84
00:02:01,659 --> 00:02:03,379
So essentially, these are the

85
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,150
three kind of what's referred to

86
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:06,760
as a break point, right?

87
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,439
These are where you go to your

88
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:09,060
phone.

89
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:09,780
It's going to look like this.

90
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:10,389
On top of it, it'll look like

91
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:10,620
this.

92
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,080
Does desktop look like this?

93
00:02:12,379 --> 00:02:14,409
Each section of the page is its

94
00:02:14,409 --> 00:02:17,090
own component that has been edited

95
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:19,270
to work across all three.

96
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,199
So changes I make here to, say,

97
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:23,060
the hero section are going to show

98
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,379
up here as well.

99
00:02:24,379 --> 00:02:25,370
I'm going to show you how you make

100
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:25,979
those changes.

101
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:27,919
So when you mouse over this,

102
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:29,409
you'll see a purple outline.

103
00:02:29,629 --> 00:02:31,139
You double-click on this.

104
00:02:31,139 --> 00:02:32,319
It'll bring you into what's called

105
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:32,780
a module.

106
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:34,039
So this module is like all the

107
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:35,479
components that are included in

108
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:36,289
that section.

109
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,650
So if I want to edit the text

110
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:39,539
here, so I double-click here.

111
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:40,620
You have two choices, actually.

112
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:42,150
You can either double-click on the

113
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:43,430
text or you can edit over here

114
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,870
where there's this content in the

115
00:02:44,969 --> 00:02:46,060
bottom right-hand side here.

116
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:50,150
But if I double-click here, if I

117
00:02:50,419 --> 00:02:54,419
just replace this with your money

118
00:02:54,419 --> 00:02:55,120
back,

119
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,580
and I go up here to the top left

120
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:59,629
and go back to home, as you'll

121
00:02:59,629 --> 00:03:01,180
see, that's changed across all

122
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:01,669
three.

123
00:03:01,939 --> 00:03:03,259
And I'm going to do that.

124
00:03:03,259 --> 00:03:04,009
Don't want to...

125
00:03:04,219 --> 00:03:04,479
Actually, don't.

126
00:03:04,689 --> 00:03:04,819
Sorry.

127
00:03:04,819 --> 00:03:05,699
I'll just be back here.

128
00:03:05,939 --> 00:03:07,300
Don't want to...

129
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:07,870
I want to keep that as a

130
00:03:08,169 --> 00:03:08,319
guarantee.

131
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:10,030
There we go.

132
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,030
So editing...

133
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:14,080
You'll edit each section like

134
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:14,389
this.

135
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,129
So again, you want to change the

136
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:15,539
pain points.

137
00:03:15,539 --> 00:03:16,340
You'll double-click in here.

138
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,689
You'll change the text.

139
00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:18,900
You'll replace the images.

140
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,250
Things like that.

141
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:21,129
I'll go into more depth than that

142
00:03:21,189 --> 00:03:21,539
in a second.

143
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:22,659
I'm just going to talk a bit about

144
00:03:22,659 --> 00:03:23,449
the hero section again.

145
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,310
So there's some things you're

146
00:03:24,379 --> 00:03:25,210
immediately going to want to edit

147
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:25,759
here, right?

148
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:26,699
So obviously, you're going to want

149
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:27,400
to put your VSL here.

150
00:03:27,419 --> 00:03:28,969
Framer has a number of ways to

151
00:03:28,969 --> 00:03:29,840
host videos.

152
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,729
I have determined that the easiest

153
00:03:31,729 --> 00:03:33,210
way for you guys to do this is

154
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:34,879
simply to use a Vimeo link.

155
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:36,310
I think Vimeo is the easiest way

156
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:36,810
to host it.

157
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:38,810
Simply upload it to Vimeo, post

158
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:40,840
it, paste the link in here, and it

159
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,289
should show up here and work

160
00:03:42,289 --> 00:03:43,319
perfectly as is.

161
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,180
There are other ways to do this.

162
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,360
Framer has a built-in video

163
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,889
hosting service, but I believe you

164
00:03:47,889 --> 00:03:49,280
need to upgrade to a certain type

165
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,500
of plan in order to get access to

166
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:50,800
that.

167
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,939
And again, one of the benefits of

168
00:03:51,939 --> 00:03:52,949
Framer is that it's generally

169
00:03:52,949 --> 00:03:54,490
cheaper than Webflow, so no reason

170
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:55,639
to add extra costs.

171
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:57,699
Just host it on Vimeo, share the

172
00:03:57,699 --> 00:03:59,419
link, and paste it in here.

173
00:04:00,419 --> 00:04:01,479
As you can see on the left-hand

174
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:02,639
side here, we have layers.

175
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:04,189
This is going to show you what, as

176
00:04:04,189 --> 00:04:05,560
you can see as I mess over, it's

177
00:04:05,669 --> 00:04:07,599
selecting each individual element.

178
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:08,939
It's a list of the elements that

179
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:09,520
are here.

180
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,789
These modules also include, as you

181
00:04:11,789 --> 00:04:13,780
can see, the tablet and mobile

182
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:15,599
versions, so you can make changes

183
00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:16,839
to just one or the other.

184
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,069
But in general, you're going to

185
00:04:18,069 --> 00:04:19,370
want to edit whatever's here, and

186
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:20,500
it should show up in the others

187
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:20,639
too.

188
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:23,069
So, for instance, you want to edit

189
00:04:23,069 --> 00:04:24,680
the video, yeah, you'll click

190
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:25,639
that.

191
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:26,779
And make sure that on the

192
00:04:26,779 --> 00:04:28,149
left-hand side here, make sure

193
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:29,899
frame isn't selected, the video

194
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,709
within that frame is selected, and

195
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:33,939
you will change the URL here.

196
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,100
Editing text, select on either

197
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,339
double-click to edit, or you can

198
00:04:38,339 --> 00:04:40,500
select it and change this here on

199
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,220
the right-hand side.

200
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,930
I'm going to talk a bit about text

201
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,709
styles now to kind of go over this

202
00:04:45,779 --> 00:04:47,600
as something that's important for

203
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:48,779
you guys to know.

204
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:50,730
So, when you select text, you can

205
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:52,160
see how this is like a, you know,

206
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,360
this is much larger than the

207
00:04:53,509 --> 00:04:54,870
subheading text here, right?

208
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,550
If you look here, a text under

209
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:58,350
styles, if you click this, there

210
00:04:58,350 --> 00:04:59,779
will be a number of styles to

211
00:04:59,779 --> 00:05:00,610
choose from.

212
00:05:00,899 --> 00:05:02,819
If I change this, it's going to

213
00:05:02,819 --> 00:05:04,519
change throughout it.

214
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,620
It's going to change the size, the

215
00:05:05,629 --> 00:05:06,639
weight of the text, things like

216
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,019
that.

217
00:05:07,019 --> 00:05:07,769
I can make it smaller, make it

218
00:05:07,889 --> 00:05:08,079
bigger.

219
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,720
These are all preset, making it

220
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,449
easier for you guys to change them

221
00:05:11,449 --> 00:05:11,839
up.

222
00:05:12,089 --> 00:05:13,079
Simple things like the alignment,

223
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:14,259
you can change individually.

224
00:05:14,259 --> 00:05:15,410
So, you can just click middle

225
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:16,470
there, and it'll be center

226
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:17,339
aligned, right?

227
00:05:17,339 --> 00:05:18,350
And it's the same for all the

228
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:18,689
text.

229
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,560
So, you can go through and you can

230
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,300
change styles how you want,

231
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,230
although I think the current

232
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:22,310
layout is pretty much set as it

233
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:22,500
is.

234
00:05:22,579 --> 00:05:23,620
I think you need to make too many

235
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:24,879
edits there if you don't want to.

236
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,519
These buttons are linked to the

237
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:28,329
appropriate parts of the pages.

238
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,870
So, for instance, this get started

239
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:31,230
should send people, if you look in

240
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:32,720
the right here at link, it's going

241
00:05:32,779 --> 00:05:33,889
to send them to a section at the

242
00:05:33,889 --> 00:05:34,889
bottom that I made called

243
00:05:34,889 --> 00:05:35,490
Calendly.

244
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:36,620
It'll always send them there when

245
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:37,660
they click it, even if you add

246
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:38,699
stuff before or after that.

247
00:05:38,899 --> 00:05:40,160
When they click this, this button

248
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,490
is showing them directly to the

249
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:42,480
Calendly section.

250
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:44,889
For the learn more part, it should

251
00:05:44,889 --> 00:05:46,610
bring them to the why choose you

252
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:47,319
section.

253
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:49,019
I've named that as the learn more

254
00:05:49,019 --> 00:05:49,500
part.

255
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,379
So, that's kind of the benefits of

256
00:05:50,379 --> 00:05:51,209
working with your company.

257
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,199
You can edit those.

258
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:54,910
You know, essentially, you will go

259
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:56,319
to the main part of the module,

260
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:57,509
and you would click scroll

261
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,139
section.

262
00:05:58,139 --> 00:05:59,060
You would give it a name.

263
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:01,000
So, you know, pain points.

264
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:04,209
And then when you're editing a

265
00:06:04,209 --> 00:06:05,990
button, like up here, you would

266
00:06:06,089 --> 00:06:07,860
click there, click the link for

267
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:10,040
home, and then click pain points.

268
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:10,500
Let's try up there.

269
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,220
I'm going to click it, then it'll

270
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:11,959
bring them to that section.

271
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:15,579
I'm going to remove that, and yes,

272
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,589
that's the basic idea.

273
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,839
So, let's go section by section.

274
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:21,240
I'm going to go to this part here.

275
00:06:21,459 --> 00:06:22,779
This is the scrolling ticker.

276
00:06:22,779 --> 00:06:24,689
So, if you click this, you'll see

277
00:06:24,689 --> 00:06:26,269
a number of photos here, and

278
00:06:26,339 --> 00:06:28,300
you'll see a scrolling bar here.

279
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:30,259
And if you look on the right-hand

280
00:06:30,259 --> 00:06:32,079
side, we've got what they call

281
00:06:32,649 --> 00:06:33,040
children.

282
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:34,079
These are all linked to this.

283
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:34,980
These are all the different logos,

284
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:35,240
right?

285
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,769
So, the easiest way to add this or

286
00:06:36,769 --> 00:06:38,300
replace this is you can delete all

287
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,620
these whenever you have your

288
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:41,579
company logos, and you can insert

289
00:06:41,579 --> 00:06:42,310
an image.

290
00:06:42,339 --> 00:06:43,199
I'm going to do that now.

291
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,879
So, if I just drag an image in,

292
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:46,540
I'm going to click this box.

293
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,180
I'm going to click fill.

294
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:48,980
I'm going to click image.

295
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,670
I'm going to click choose image,

296
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:52,240
and I'm going to select a random

297
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:52,759
image.

298
00:06:52,819 --> 00:06:53,639
I'm just going to picture this ad

299
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:54,420
that I have here, right?

300
00:06:54,579 --> 00:06:55,459
This isn't going to be the right

301
00:06:55,459 --> 00:06:56,579
size or work properly, but, you

302
00:06:56,579 --> 00:06:57,579
know, this is demonstration

303
00:06:57,579 --> 00:06:58,060
purposes.

304
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,850
So, then when I click here again,

305
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:02,589
I've got children.

306
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,370
I can add a new item, which I've

307
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:05,620
added already, and I can choose

308
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:06,870
the name of this frame, which is

309
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:07,709
that one there.

310
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,959
That, as you can see here, is now

311
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:12,740
linked to this.

312
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:15,000
So, if I preview this, there you

313
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,459
go.

314
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,610
There's the, you know, image

315
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:17,040
cutoff.

316
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,399
It's not the right size, showing

317
00:07:18,459 --> 00:07:18,980
up there.

318
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,439
So, that's how you're going to be

319
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:21,699
linking company logos.

320
00:07:21,699 --> 00:07:23,540
I'm going to delete that for now.

321
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,759
And, yeah, so that gives you a

322
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:28,060
basic idea of how that works.

323
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:29,410
This might be a bit tricky.

324
00:07:29,459 --> 00:07:30,350
If you guys have trouble with

325
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:31,339
this, please feel free to hit me

326
00:07:31,339 --> 00:07:32,250
up on Slack, and I'll help you

327
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:32,579
out.

328
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:34,730
So, going back out of this, back

329
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:37,129
to the homepage, next section, the

330
00:07:37,129 --> 00:07:38,810
pain points section.

331
00:07:38,819 --> 00:07:40,439
So, the main thing you're going to

332
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:42,170
want to change here, obviously, is

333
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:42,920
the titles.

334
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,860
You know, double-click the text,

335
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:44,269
edit that.

336
00:07:44,459 --> 00:07:45,759
You're going to want to change the

337
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,360
logo or image that you have here.

338
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,670
To do that, you're going to click

339
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:49,300
on the box.

340
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,790
You're going to click fill and

341
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,480
click image and choose a new image

342
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,370
to put in there.

343
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:54,189
Again, I'll use this as an

344
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:54,600
example.

345
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,740
That's updated.

346
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,860
So, that's how you're going to do

347
00:07:57,879 --> 00:07:58,720
that throughout the page.

348
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,459
You're going to want to replace an

349
00:07:59,589 --> 00:07:59,720
image.

350
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,250
It'll be the same process for this

351
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:01,899
part here.

352
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:04,220
And the rest of this is mainly

353
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,680
just editing text.

354
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:06,949
You know, it's just replacing

355
00:08:06,949 --> 00:08:07,730
images, editing text.

356
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:10,199
For this section, this is your

357
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:12,740
three-part process section.

358
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,639
These are actually not images.

359
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:16,379
They're icons.

360
00:08:16,379 --> 00:08:17,589
So, if you look at the right here,

361
00:08:17,589 --> 00:08:18,699
you can see there's variant and

362
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:19,100
icon.

363
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:20,720
iTunes can just put a campaign in

364
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,220
there.

365
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,889
There's a list of icons here that

366
00:08:22,889 --> 00:08:24,610
you can take advantage of that you

367
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:25,720
can use to update.

368
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,980
As you click that, it changes.

369
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,319
I change that to call.

370
00:08:28,589 --> 00:08:29,199
There's a phone.

371
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:30,399
You know, so you lose that.

372
00:08:31,589 --> 00:08:33,548
And you can change, like, things

373
00:08:33,548 --> 00:08:35,590
like the background color, the

374
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,418
variant.

375
00:08:36,418 --> 00:08:37,360
You can do a gradient.

376
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:39,340
You can do a flattened stroke,

377
00:08:39,408 --> 00:08:41,139
large flattened stroke.

378
00:08:41,538 --> 00:08:46,019
You can do a very small gradient.

379
00:08:46,299 --> 00:08:47,700
There's a number of things you can

380
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:48,350
do with it.

381
00:08:48,379 --> 00:08:51,500
I think it's just a slot.

382
00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:52,539
There we go.

383
00:08:52,539 --> 00:08:54,600
So, you can edit those right.

384
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,500
The same for all those images

385
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,070
across there.

386
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,289
This is, again, just the what's

387
00:08:58,289 --> 00:08:59,519
included section.

388
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,009
It's going to be just the image

389
00:09:02,009 --> 00:09:03,879
change on the text.

390
00:09:04,129 --> 00:09:05,600
Now, again, this is the

391
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:06,799
testimonials.

392
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:07,779
This is very similar to what we

393
00:09:07,779 --> 00:09:08,759
talked about before, the ticker

394
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:09,179
section.

395
00:09:09,179 --> 00:09:10,419
So, if you click in here, you're

396
00:09:10,419 --> 00:09:11,570
going to see all these sections

397
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:12,100
are linked.

398
00:09:12,179 --> 00:09:13,669
It's very simply just edit the

399
00:09:13,669 --> 00:09:15,100
text on these and the photos is

400
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:16,519
the easiest way to do it.

401
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:17,700
And then you can delete some if

402
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:18,629
you don't want them to be

403
00:09:18,629 --> 00:09:19,279
included.

404
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,610
This is a scrolling ticker again.

405
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:24,539
It's got six linked things.

406
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:26,179
You can delete these as you feel

407
00:09:26,179 --> 00:09:27,740
free or if you don't have enough

408
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:28,940
for it or if you want to add more.

409
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:31,230
And then the rest will be updated

410
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:32,029
as it goes.

411
00:09:32,269 --> 00:09:34,029
But, again, to change the copy

412
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:36,360
here, just double click, edit how

413
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,120
you want, edit the photo by

414
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,179
choosing a new avatar image, and

415
00:09:40,299 --> 00:09:42,139
edit the names and things like

416
00:09:42,139 --> 00:09:42,720
that.

417
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,809
There you go.

418
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,860
This, again, just image and text.

419
00:09:47,139 --> 00:09:49,340
Okay, the Calendly section.

420
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:51,330
Do not mess with this too much.

421
00:09:51,529 --> 00:09:52,590
Here's the only thing you're going

422
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:53,460
to want to edit here.

423
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:54,740
Obviously, aside from the headline

424
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:55,539
and stuff, right?

425
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:57,139
You're going to select the

426
00:09:57,139 --> 00:09:57,980
Calendly.

427
00:09:58,190 --> 00:09:59,190
Again, check on the left side that

428
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:00,090
you've selected Calendly

429
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:01,200
underneath form wrapper.

430
00:10:01,389 --> 00:10:02,879
And here, you're going to put in

431
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,120
your Calendly link.

432
00:10:04,139 --> 00:10:04,950
Now, you're not going to put the

433
00:10:05,019 --> 00:10:05,600
full Calendly link.

434
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,110
You're going to put what comes

435
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:08,580
after Calendly.com slash.

436
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:11,360
So, if I go to Calendly.com.

437
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,460
So, see, I've got Calendly.com

438
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:15,129
slash Copyright Media slash

439
00:10:15,129 --> 00:10:16,320
Discovery Call.

440
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:18,029
You just want this part.

441
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:19,720
The part after the Calendly.com

442
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:20,240
slash.

443
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,519
So, Copyright Media slash

444
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:22,480
Discovery Call.

445
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:24,509
And then you will go back to

446
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:25,220
Framer.

447
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,779
You will paste that in.

448
00:10:27,019 --> 00:10:27,679
Hit Enter.

449
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,539
And it'll update.

450
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:30,759
That's the only part you want to

451
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:31,240
change.

452
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,690
Don't mess with any of your stuff,

453
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:33,139
right?

454
00:10:33,419 --> 00:10:35,950
The Framer embed is a bit awkward.

455
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:37,690
Or the Calendly embed in Framer is

456
00:10:37,779 --> 00:10:38,700
a bit awkward.

457
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:39,950
I have it set up to look pretty

458
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:40,409
decent.

459
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,960
So, just go with that.

460
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,879
And then the FAQs.

461
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,139
To edit the FAQs.

462
00:10:46,419 --> 00:10:47,220
Double-click in.

463
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,519
Select the FAQ.

464
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:51,919
You'll see Variant is open and

465
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:52,799
closed.

466
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:54,620
So, you can set it to whatever.

467
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,600
To edit the question.

468
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:58,110
It says question here.

469
00:10:58,389 --> 00:10:59,830
Just edit this content here.

470
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:01,360
And then to edit the answer.

471
00:11:01,629 --> 00:11:02,360
Click Edit Content.

472
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,580
And you'll see the answer to the

473
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:04,759
same question just here.

474
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:07,480
And you edit that as you see it.

475
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:10,289
And then the footer.

476
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,899
Here's links that you can place in

477
00:11:11,899 --> 00:11:12,340
here.

478
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:13,240
So, you just click Link.

479
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,019
And you either link to another

480
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:14,580
part of the page.

481
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:15,399
Or to another website.

482
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:17,340
And same for these as well.

483
00:11:17,539 --> 00:11:18,870
You can add a link here in the

484
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:20,539
bottom right under a social icon.

485
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,889
And link to your socials.

486
00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:23,860
And then delete these as you are.

487
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:24,320
You want.

488
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:24,659
You know.

489
00:11:24,659 --> 00:11:26,370
So, the other thing I'm going to

490
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:28,240
go over a bit is editing colors.

491
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,129
As you can see, the page is just

492
00:11:29,129 --> 00:11:29,759
black and white.

493
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:30,279
It's actually two things.

494
00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:30,980
I'm going to go over the logo

495
00:11:31,139 --> 00:11:31,279
first.

496
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:31,850
And then the colors.

497
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,750
So, if you click on Pages here in

498
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:34,669
the top left.

499
00:11:34,929 --> 00:11:36,649
You will see I've segmented these

500
00:11:36,649 --> 00:11:37,519
things out.

501
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,200
So, we've got logos and

502
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:40,320
typography.

503
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,830
So, for logos.

504
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,429
Basically, you want to double

505
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:44,940
click.

506
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,019
This is a logo component.

507
00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:46,919
Double click on this.

508
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:49,250
And then you're going to delete

509
00:11:49,299 --> 00:11:49,840
this.

510
00:11:50,129 --> 00:11:51,120
And add a new image.

511
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:52,210
Just do insert.

512
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:55,159
And then media and image.

513
00:11:55,259 --> 00:11:57,200
Upload your image.

514
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:57,870
Image here.

515
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,460
Size it to be approximately the

516
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:00,679
same height as this.

517
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:01,460
Width can be longer.

518
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,600
But height as the current here.

519
00:12:03,879 --> 00:12:06,519
Which is about 46 or 50.

520
00:12:06,539 --> 00:12:07,379
As I will probably fit.

521
00:12:07,659 --> 00:12:09,090
Then go back out.

522
00:12:09,179 --> 00:12:10,120
In the top left logos.

523
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:10,840
You'll see it here.

524
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,559
As you can see, it's within this

525
00:12:12,659 --> 00:12:13,649
little box here.

526
00:12:13,929 --> 00:12:15,799
And whenever you change that.

527
00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:16,549
When you go back to the homepage.

528
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:18,100
All your logos on the page will be

529
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,370
updated to match that.

530
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,399
Now, for colors.

531
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,779
Colors are where you're going to

532
00:12:22,779 --> 00:12:24,179
really customize your site.

533
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:24,440
Right?

534
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:28,220
So, every one of these sections.

535
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,220
If I select this.

536
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:31,070
And if you look at the bottom

537
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:32,240
right here under styles.

538
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:33,600
It's got a fill.

539
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:33,919
Right?

540
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,460
And the fill.

541
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:36,379
It's set to neutral surface main.

542
00:12:36,649 --> 00:12:38,320
You can edit that here.

543
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,230
But I was just editing it on the

544
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:39,899
main color page.

545
00:12:39,899 --> 00:12:40,360
So, basically.

546
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,080
These are all different presets.

547
00:12:42,269 --> 00:12:44,889
If you go back to the colors page.

548
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:45,659
If I go to home.

549
00:12:45,659 --> 00:12:46,330
I go to pages.

550
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:47,279
Go to colors.

551
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:48,899
You can see here.

552
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:49,840
We've got neutral.

553
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:50,929
Primary slash brand.

554
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:51,509
Secondary.

555
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:51,919
Territory.

556
00:12:52,149 --> 00:12:52,259
Success.

557
00:12:52,539 --> 00:12:52,779
Warning.

558
00:12:53,059 --> 00:12:53,299
Danger.

559
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:53,970
Text.

560
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:54,539
Alphas.

561
00:12:54,769 --> 00:12:54,919
Right?

562
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,350
If you want to change the primary

563
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:58,080
color.

564
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,269
You can see it says main default

565
00:12:59,269 --> 00:12:59,789
slash brand.

566
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:01,259
You can change the color of this

567
00:13:01,259 --> 00:13:01,659
here.

568
00:13:01,659 --> 00:13:03,019
If you want to change background

569
00:13:03,019 --> 00:13:03,370
color.

570
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:04,179
Say, for instance.

571
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:05,340
You wanted.

572
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:07,330
I don't know.

573
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:09,019
A green background.

574
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:12,220
Very simply.

575
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,039
You can click here.

576
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:13,899
Neutral.

577
00:13:14,179 --> 00:13:14,919
Surface main.

578
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,120
Change here.

579
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:17,720
Set it to a green.

580
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,240
As you can see.

581
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,320
The background there is changing.

582
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:19,960
Of this entire thing.

583
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,759
As the entire background is.

584
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:21,899
Was set to surface main.

585
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:23,539
So, you can edit that there.

586
00:13:23,539 --> 00:13:24,460
As you would like.

587
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:26,169
And then, any other section that

588
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:26,919
is used.

589
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:27,840
That surface main.

590
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,100
As its main section.

591
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,039
Will be green.

592
00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:31,740
As you can see.

593
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:32,820
Like, these boxes aren't affected.

594
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:34,179
But the main background is.

595
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:36,159
And you can go through.

596
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:36,899
And edit that then.

597
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:37,500
As you.

598
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:40,309
As you want to suit your brand.

599
00:13:40,539 --> 00:13:41,100
Same with these.

600
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,440
You change the main default brand.

601
00:13:43,299 --> 00:13:43,799
Color.

602
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,440
Stop doing that.

603
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,149
Just click this.

604
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,529
Primary slash main default.

605
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:49,320
Click edit.

606
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,679
Set to red.

607
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:52,279
Go back to the page.

608
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:54,789
Then, any sections I had.

609
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:55,600
To see those.

610
00:13:55,879 --> 00:13:56,950
Those icons are now red.

611
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,919
These stars are now red.

612
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,179
Anything that you set.

613
00:14:00,389 --> 00:14:01,039
To use.

614
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,240
That color bar.

615
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,100
If I double click on this.

616
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,039
And if I click on the icon.

617
00:14:04,269 --> 00:14:04,980
You can see.

618
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:05,820
For the icon color.

619
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,809
It used that primary main default.

620
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:08,320
So, when you ever.

621
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,659
Edit that primary main default.

622
00:14:09,659 --> 00:14:10,659
It'll change the color.

623
00:14:10,659 --> 00:14:11,600
On the page.

624
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:13,179
This allows you.

625
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:14,269
Just to keep a very.

626
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:16,580
Kind of constant brand look.

627
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:16,860
Throughout.

628
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:17,950
It's set to gray and black.

629
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,460
Just for you guys.

630
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,070
To start off.

631
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:20,570
Again.

632
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:21,250
Like on the section.

633
00:14:21,259 --> 00:14:22,309
Say you want to just have a white

634
00:14:22,309 --> 00:14:22,610
page.

635
00:14:22,659 --> 00:14:23,299
With a white background.

636
00:14:23,299 --> 00:14:24,360
You will double click here.

637
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:25,679
Click fill.

638
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:26,769
And then.

639
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:27,860
You've got neutral surface main.

640
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:29,460
Neutral inverse surface main.

641
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:30,259
So, it's white.

642
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,559
And for the text.

643
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:32,720
You would click this.

644
00:14:32,929 --> 00:14:33,440
And then.

645
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,149
You can edit the.

646
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,509
You can add the color.

647
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:37,720
So, you can do.

648
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,019
Text inverse main.

649
00:14:39,299 --> 00:14:41,529
And same for the one below.

650
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:42,409
Color.

651
00:14:43,289 --> 00:14:44,129
Text.

652
00:14:44,179 --> 00:14:45,480
Inverse subtle maybe.

653
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:45,860
For instance.

654
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:47,019
And now it's a white version of

655
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:47,559
the page.

656
00:14:47,879 --> 00:14:49,009
So, you just do that throughout

657
00:14:49,009 --> 00:14:49,480
the page.

658
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,779
And edit the colors as you go.

659
00:14:51,059 --> 00:14:54,200
That is kind of the main part of

660
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,240
this.

661
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,429
Most changes you make to these

662
00:14:57,429 --> 00:14:59,019
sections should just update

663
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,850
directly over.

664
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:02,370
You shouldn't have to edit them

665
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:02,950
specifically.

666
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,000
If you look here.

667
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:04,840
If you actually.

668
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,740
If I click on this section.

669
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:05,980
Right.

670
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:06,779
So, the white shoes.

671
00:15:06,779 --> 00:15:07,000
The edge.

672
00:15:07,179 --> 00:15:07,559
Which is there.

673
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:07,980
There.

674
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:08,500
And there.

675
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:10,419
The.

676
00:15:11,129 --> 00:15:12,000
This is set to the variant of

677
00:15:12,009 --> 00:15:12,519
desktop.

678
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:13,220
Right.

679
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:14,840
If I click in the middle one here.

680
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,740
See that's set to tablet.

681
00:15:15,929 --> 00:15:17,580
And then if I click this one here.

682
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:18,379
It's set to phone.

683
00:15:18,379 --> 00:15:19,809
If I was to change these.

684
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:20,600
It would.

685
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,059
So, that's the tablet view.

686
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:22,799
I set it to desktop.

687
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,100
See it looks kind of wonky and

688
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:24,509
weird.

689
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:25,669
So, set it to tablet.

690
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:26,980
And it's fine.

691
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:27,980
Set it.

692
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:28,860
It's set to phone.

693
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:29,580
Set it to desktop.

694
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:31,049
Way too big.

695
00:15:31,059 --> 00:15:31,759
Not going to work.

696
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:32,679
Set it to phone.

697
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:33,559
Perfect size.

698
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,179
When you double click on these

699
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:35,620
components.

700
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:36,799
You can see the.

701
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,679
Tablet and phone versions of each

702
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:39,610
of these here.

703
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:40,750
So, if you want to make changes to

704
00:15:40,809 --> 00:15:41,659
just the phone version.

705
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,019
You can make the edit inside the

706
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:44,049
variant itself here.

707
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,320
And that'll show up in the phone

708
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,240
section.

709
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,730
So, that should give you an idea

710
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,049
generally how this works.

711
00:15:50,139 --> 00:15:52,210
I imagine there's going to be some

712
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:53,820
questions about this.

713
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,139
I'm going to put the template

714
00:15:55,139 --> 00:15:56,980
customization call calendar link.

715
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:58,970
In the description of this video.

716
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,679
So, if you have any problems.

717
00:16:00,679 --> 00:16:01,519
You can book a call with me.

718
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:02,590
And I will go through this with

719
00:16:02,649 --> 00:16:03,230
you one on one.

720
00:16:04,259 --> 00:16:05,340
But, I'll also give you some

721
00:16:05,389 --> 00:16:05,980
resources.

722
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:06,830
I think you should watch in

723
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:07,580
general on Framer.

724
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:08,779
If you want to get really into it.

725
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:10,139
One other thing I included

726
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,700
actually was some background

727
00:16:11,809 --> 00:16:12,460
sections.

728
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,820
These are some number of images

729
00:16:13,879 --> 00:16:14,759
and backgrounds.

730
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:15,899
You can use to spice things up.

731
00:16:15,899 --> 00:16:16,840
And change things around a bit.

732
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,720
So, you can take a look at these.

733
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,649
And kind of copy and paste them

734
00:16:19,649 --> 00:16:19,899
in.

735
00:16:20,129 --> 00:16:21,610
And again, you click on the

736
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,409
layers.

737
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:24,679
So, each of the backgrounds is in

738
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:25,450
a stack.

739
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:27,970
Let's make it smaller.

740
00:16:28,059 --> 00:16:28,840
I have to move my face out of the

741
00:16:28,929 --> 00:16:29,080
way.

742
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,379
They're in a row.

743
00:16:31,539 --> 00:16:33,539
So, they're inside a stack.

744
00:16:33,799 --> 00:16:34,110
Inside a row.

745
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:35,399
So, that's the first one.

746
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:36,399
That's the second one.

747
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:38,840
That's the third one.

748
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,080
Like that thread.

749
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,240
And you can copy and paste those

750
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,019
to the main page.

751
00:16:42,019 --> 00:16:43,620
In order to kind of, you know,

752
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,259
make things look a bit nicer.

753
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46,200
And change things up a bit.

754
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,720
So, play around with those.

755
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,470
See how it goes.

756
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:49,820
Any major problems.

757
00:16:50,019 --> 00:16:50,860
Again, book a call with me.

758
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:52,059
And I will walk you through it.

759
00:16:52,259 --> 00:16:53,059
These are going to be slightly

760
00:16:53,059 --> 00:16:53,740
more technical.

761
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:54,759
So, you can bring these questions

762
00:16:54,759 --> 00:16:55,639
to the landing page call.

763
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:56,809
But you'll probably have more time

764
00:16:56,809 --> 00:16:57,240
with me.

765
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:57,960
To go through it.

766
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:58,600
And make sure everything is

767
00:16:58,799 --> 00:16:59,200
working correctly.

768
00:16:59,409 --> 00:17:01,179
On the actual template

769
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:03,480
customization calls.

770
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,769
So, feel free to book that for

771
00:17:04,769 --> 00:17:05,799
whatever suits you.

772
00:17:06,078 --> 00:17:07,039
And yeah.

773
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:08,190
I think you guys are going to

774
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:09,160
really enjoy this.

775
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,068
It's going to make your sites look

776
00:17:10,068 --> 00:17:10,509
even better.

777
00:17:11,098 --> 00:17:12,098
It'll be a little bit of learning

778
00:17:12,098 --> 00:17:12,809
for some of you guys.

779
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,619
So, keep that in mind.

780
00:17:13,828 --> 00:17:14,950
This isn't going to be as simple

781
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:15,460
as card.

782
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:16,809
It might take you a bit longer to

783
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,170
do.

784
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,539
So, kind of set aside the time to

785
00:17:18,549 --> 00:17:19,660
kind of invest in this.

786
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:20,828
But it should end up you guys

787
00:17:20,828 --> 00:17:22,170
having some really, really sick

788
00:17:22,338 --> 00:17:22,799
sites.

789
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:24,000
That are going to really help with

790
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:24,660
conversions.

791
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:25,750
And, you know, make your business

792
00:17:25,789 --> 00:17:26,369
look even more kind of

793
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,380
professional and stuff.

794
00:17:27,549 --> 00:17:29,480
So, hope this is helpful.

795
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:31,789
The link to copy this project will

796
00:17:31,789 --> 00:17:33,579
be in the description.

797
00:17:33,859 --> 00:17:34,630
Along with a link to the

798
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:36,039
customization call on me.

799
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,380
And some resources on Framer in

800
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:37,960
general.

801
00:17:38,119 --> 00:17:38,960
That you guys can use to kind of

802
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,039
brush up and just learn a bit more

803
00:17:40,039 --> 00:17:40,460
as you go.

804
00:17:41,099 --> 00:17:42,170
So, any problems, feel free to

805
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:42,809
reach out to me.

806
00:17:43,099 --> 00:17:43,960
And yeah.

807
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:44,660
Look good.

808
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:45,309
Thanks.
