1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,540
All right, guys, in this one,

2
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:02,730
we're going to go over how to set

3
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:03,970
up your email service within Go

4
00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:04,580
High Level.

5
00:00:04,599 --> 00:00:06,259
This will allow you to pretty much

6
00:00:06,259 --> 00:00:07,580
send emails to your list,

7
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:09,310
prospects, clients, or anybody

8
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:09,800
else.

9
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:11,230
So you want to go to settings

10
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:12,990
first, then email services.

11
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:15,240
Once you do that, you're going to

12
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,579
have this pop up.

13
00:00:16,609 --> 00:00:18,710
OK, so this pop up is for setting

14
00:00:18,789 --> 00:00:20,500
up your email with the lead

15
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,609
connector system, which is just

16
00:00:22,649 --> 00:00:24,289
essentially Go High Levels email

17
00:00:24,489 --> 00:00:25,120
system.

18
00:00:25,149 --> 00:00:26,699
If you want to do that, just click

19
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:28,120
create dedicated domain.

20
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:30,079
And here you're going to put your

21
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:30,620
domain.

22
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,990
So let's say lc.company.com or

23
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,759
whatever it may be.

24
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:39,899
You're going to click add and

25
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:40,820
verify.

26
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:42,909
It's going to give you a few DNS

27
00:00:42,909 --> 00:00:45,109
records to add into your domain

28
00:00:45,109 --> 00:00:46,100
register.

29
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:48,450
OK, so you could click continue,

30
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:50,929
but that's going to have it think.

31
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:52,030
And then most likely you're going

32
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:53,340
to have to do it manually anyways.

33
00:00:53,369 --> 00:00:55,450
So I would just click add record

34
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:56,399
manually.

35
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:58,880
And then you're going to take all

36
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,659
of these DNS records and put them

37
00:01:00,659 --> 00:01:02,320
inside your domain registrar.

38
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:03,890
OK, so obviously make sure you

39
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:05,510
have you're selecting the right

40
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:06,140
record.

41
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:07,120
Right.

42
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,730
And that everything is copied and

43
00:01:08,739 --> 00:01:09,840
pasted correctly.

44
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:10,810
If not, it won't work.

45
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,909
Once you paste all of these in

46
00:01:12,909 --> 00:01:16,150
your registrar, just click verify

47
00:01:16,209 --> 00:01:19,140
records and let it think for a

48
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:19,379
bit.

49
00:01:19,609 --> 00:01:20,730
OK, and it'll be good to go.

50
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,430
Now, if you want to connect a

51
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:24,549
different email service like Gmail

52
00:01:24,549 --> 00:01:26,760
or Yahoo or, you know, SendGrid,

53
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,480
we go back here.

54
00:01:30,069 --> 00:01:31,510
And in this page, you can click

55
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:32,290
add service.

56
00:01:32,329 --> 00:01:33,909
So here you click add service and

57
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,359
you select the one you want to

58
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:35,799
use.

59
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:37,799
So let's say it's Gmail here.

60
00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:38,700
You want to put your email.

61
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:45,269
And then here below that, you

62
00:01:45,269 --> 00:01:46,829
don't want to put your email's

63
00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:47,640
password.

64
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:49,000
You want to put it what's called

65
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,930
an app password.

66
00:01:49,969 --> 00:01:51,519
And there's a guide right here

67
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:53,109
that shows you how to do it.

68
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:54,500
So it's super simple.

69
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:55,500
All you got to do is you got to go

70
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,420
to your Google account.

71
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:57,489
They might have a link here for

72
00:01:57,549 --> 00:01:58,560
you to just click on it and log

73
00:01:58,650 --> 00:01:58,980
in.

74
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:00,049
So it takes you right there.

75
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:02,709
Then inside security, you're going

76
00:02:02,709 --> 00:02:04,090
to click two-step verification and

77
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:05,439
then you're going to scroll all

78
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:06,090
the way down.

79
00:02:06,129 --> 00:02:08,349
OK, then you're going to see app

80
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,419
passwords.

81
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:10,849
You're going to click there and

82
00:02:10,849 --> 00:02:12,250
then you're going to create a new

83
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:12,759
app.

84
00:02:12,789 --> 00:02:13,830
You're going to name it high level

85
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:15,139
or whatever you want to call it.

86
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:16,340
And you're going to click create.

87
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,229
Once you click create a password,

88
00:02:18,229 --> 00:02:19,930
an app password is going to show

89
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:20,919
on the screen.

90
00:02:20,939 --> 00:02:22,840
You're going to copy that and

91
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,319
paste it right back in this field.

92
00:02:25,349 --> 00:02:27,460
OK, once you do that, click save

93
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:29,219
and it'll be connected.

94
00:02:29,509 --> 00:02:30,400
OK, it's that simple.

95
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:32,789
So that's pretty much how you set

96
00:02:32,789 --> 00:02:33,460
it up.

97
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:35,199
Again, should not take you more

98
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:36,680
than five minutes tops.

99
00:02:36,699 --> 00:02:38,699
And yeah, you'll be good to go.

100
00:02:38,729 --> 00:02:39,639
If you got any questions about

101
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:40,400
this, let me know.
