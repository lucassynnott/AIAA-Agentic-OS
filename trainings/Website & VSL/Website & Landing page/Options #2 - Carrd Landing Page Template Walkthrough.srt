143
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,360
sure this is two paragraphs this

144
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,439
is two paragraphs it'll keep the

145
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:46,580
sizing of everything consistent

146
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:46,780
and

147
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,409
look nicer uh change the logo to

148
00:03:48,409 --> 00:03:50,110

00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:01,539
over uh why you're different

156
00:04:01,539 --> 00:04:03,219
than other agencies uh in your

157
00:04:03,219 --> 00:04:04,930
niche uh how you use your unique

158
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,800
mechanism to achieve a certain

159
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,219
result

160
00:04:07,219 --> 00:04:08,560
uh just list the benefits the

161
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,949
primary benefits of your main

162
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:11,639
service uh you don't you might not

163
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:11,800
have

164
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:13,479
six you might only have three or

165
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:15,180
four you can always delete these

166
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,519
uh or add more copy to that with

167
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,069
you on a call uh transformation

168
00:04:19,069 --> 00:04:20,579
slash our process so you don't

169
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:22,300
want to name this transformation

170
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,649
that's just you know what this is

171
00:04:23,649 --> 00:04:24,800
uh you also don't have to keep

172
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:26,060
these colors in this background

173
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,709
you could literally have a like

174
00:04:27,709 --> 00:04:29,259
like a transparent container

175
00:04:29,259 --> 00:04:31,189
background with a different color

176
00:04:31,269 --> 00:04:31,589

process that you you use to

183
00:04:40,569 --> 00:04:41,949

all

208
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,149
be edited uh this is just kind of

00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,199
you how to uh put that in instead

214
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:27,730
um this is just uh i figure a lot

215
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:29,519
of people tend to have screenshots

216
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:30,959

218
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:33,860
problem book a call what's

219
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,550
included i like to productize the

220
00:05:35,689 --> 00:05:36,449
service here

221
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:38,089
essentially you're just breaking

222
00:05:38,089 --> 00:05:39,709
down the main things your client's

223
00:05:39,709 --> 00:05:40,639
going to get you're showing

224
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,139
them exactly that when they sign

225
00:05:42,139 --> 00:05:43,540
up with you what are the things

226
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:45,730
they're going to receive uh i find

227
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:47,160
that this just makes it your offer

228
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,470
a bit more tangible a bit easier

229
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,879
to understand so it could be

230
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:51,240
you know like i said if you're

231
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,790
doing data analytics it could be

232
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:54,199
uh you know our our top of the

233
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:54,300
line

234
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,649
seo services and you know i'll be

235
00:05:55,649 --> 00:05:56,800
free thinking about your seo

236
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:58,720
service and what you do number two

237
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,860
number two could just be your

238
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,220
ongoing support and optimization

239
00:06:01,269 --> 00:06:02,480
or whatever it is you guys offer

240
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:02,800
but

241
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:04,579
uh you can also just easily uh

242
00:06:04,579 --> 00:06:06,600
duplicate these uh to make another

243
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:08,649
one if i move my little head here

244
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,730
uh uh move down if you got more

245
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:12,439
than than than two uh i would

246
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:15,279
suggest keeping this alternating

247
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:15,449
image

248
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:16,970
style it just breaks the page up a

249
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:18,120
bit so it's a big wall of texts

250
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:19,379
all along one side a bunch of

251
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:21,600
images makes it a bit easier to

252
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,360
read um more testimonials uh

253
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:27,319
change that to whatever you know

254
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:28,769
like like something else about why

255
00:06:28,769 --> 00:06:30,050
your clients are so happy uh i've

256
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:31,540
got another gallery here can be

a case basis i'll go over this

305
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:46,740
with you on the one-on-one

306
00:07:47,379 --> 00:07:49,470
um i have here a custom faq this

307
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,870
is going to take a little bit of

308
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,550
explaining right this is why i do

309
00:07:53,189 --> 00:07:54,839
suggest you you book a call with

310
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:57,060
me uh this is a custom faq made by

311
00:07:57,069 --> 00:07:59,319
uh i believe it's jason leo

312
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:02,050
uh plugins.card.co he's got a ton

313
00:08:02,139 --> 00:08:05,129
here um he made this is a free

314
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,170
plugin uh it is a drop down faq

315
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:08,339
you

316
00:08:08,339 --> 00:08:09,990
can't see because it's an embed

317
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,449
but i'll show you in the page

318
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,220
preview after um you just add an

319
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:13,430
embed

320
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:14,970
this is this is all here i'm going

321
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:16,439
to go through this text a little

322
00:08:16,459 --> 00:08:19,350
bit here so here you can change

323
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,199
the font and the style and change

324
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,000
the size of it here it says font

325
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,120
size 14 pixels um here you can

326
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,269
change the background color i

327
00:08:26,269 --> 00:08:27,500
suggest keeping this the same as

328
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,819
your current background so it's

329
00:08:28,819 --> 00:08:29,060
set to

330
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:31,240
white um here you can do the width

331
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,580
uh 100 you can do the maximum

332
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,840
width so how large it's allowed to

333
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:36,200
go

334
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,269
uh let's see then when you want to

335
00:08:38,269 --> 00:08:40,200
actually edit the text you'll

336
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:41,679
scroll down a good bit

337
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,820
and as you go you're going to get

338
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:48,320
to a section here's the uh yeah

339
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,529
here's a section here so

340
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:52,480
title which countries do you ship

341
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:54,269
to you're going to want to change

342
00:08:54,269 --> 00:08:55,919
that to you know uh whatever it is

343
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:57,269
your faq is about uh how do you

344
00:08:57,269 --> 00:08:58,649
generate results for clients

345
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:03,059
description you'll put in there uh

346
00:09:03,059 --> 00:09:04,440
all the way down i think all this

347
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,820
section here is the description uh

348
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,480
how long does it take so then

349
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,690
these are where you're going to

350
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,940
edit this again this is like all

351
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,240
very awkward so i really would

352
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:13,559
suggest

353
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:15,059

00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,059
but that's how you edit it

356
00:09:18,059 --> 00:09:19,330
