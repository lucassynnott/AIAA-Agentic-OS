1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,379
Has come to my attention that I

2
00:00:01,379 --> 00:00:02,640
have not made a video on Microsoft

3
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:02,980
Clarity.

4
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:04,110
I may have mentioned

5
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:05,150
this in some of the others, but I

6
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:06,120
don't have a dedicated video on

7
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:06,299
it.

8
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:07,230
So today I'm going to walk

9
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:08,269
you guys through it.

10
00:00:08,269 --> 00:00:09,689
So what is Microsoft Clarity?

11
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:11,480
Basically, it records every single

12
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:12,140
user that comes

13
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:12,900
to your website.

14
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:13,980
This allows you to see where

15
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:15,369
they're clicking, where they're

16
00:00:15,369 --> 00:00:16,050
scrolling,

17
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:17,500
generate heat maps, basically

18
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:18,980
figure out what areas of your site

19
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:20,100
you need to improve.

20
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:20,820
If someone's

21
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,829
only scrolling down 30% of the way

22
00:00:22,829 --> 00:00:24,579
of your landing page, now you can

23
00:00:24,579 --> 00:00:25,989
see what's at that 30%.

24
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:26,379
That

25
00:00:26,379 --> 00:00:27,629
means they're not continuing on,

26
00:00:27,629 --> 00:00:28,760
they're not moving forward.

27
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,079
And what can you change there to

28
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:30,219
get

29
00:00:30,219 --> 00:00:32,030
them to keep going further?

30
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:34,130
So Clarity works across basically

31
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:35,159
any platform.

32
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:36,579
The three popular web

33
00:00:36,579 --> 00:00:37,799
builders I suggest for you guys

34
00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:39,219
are Card, Webflow, and WordPress.

35
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:40,640
So I'm going to quickly walk you

36
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,420
through just the installation

37
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:43,829
steps for each of them.

38
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:46,200
So go to clarity.microsoft.com,

39
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,140
sign up for

40
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:47,359
free.

41
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:48,159
You can log in with Google or you

42
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:49,079
can log into Microsoft, whatever

43
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:49,630
you want to do.

44
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,250
You add a

45
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:52,210
new website.

46
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:53,899
All you put in is the URL of your

47
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:56,049
website and the name, then it'll

48
00:00:56,049 --> 00:00:56,880
bring you to here

49
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,990
and you'll see this page.

50
00:00:58,070 --> 00:00:59,020
So if you want to install

51
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:00,429
manually, which is what you want

52
00:01:00,429 --> 00:01:01,210
to do for Webflow

53
00:01:01,259 --> 00:01:02,369
and card, it'll give you a

54
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:03,210
tracking code.

55
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:04,560
So the code looks like this, copy

56
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:05,739
to your clipboard.

57
00:01:05,739 --> 00:01:07,359
Then this is the CA test site.

58
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:08,730
I use this just to test a few

59
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:10,620
things and to show you guys how to

60
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:10,780
do

61
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:11,370
stuff.

62
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:13,269
So what you want to do is you want

63
00:01:13,299 --> 00:01:14,560
to add a new embed.

64
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,219
Put this at the top here, name it,

65
00:01:18,219 --> 00:01:19,780
anything you want, clarity,

66
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:20,459
whatever.

67
00:01:20,459 --> 00:01:20,859
Style.

68
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:22,540
This is the important part.

69
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:23,739
Style, hidden.

70
00:01:23,739 --> 00:01:24,219
You don't want

71
00:01:24,219 --> 00:01:25,680
this actually show up.

72
00:01:25,689 --> 00:01:27,290
Hidden and set it to head.

73
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:28,700
So these are the two main

74
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,129
important settings.

75
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:30,540
Style,

76
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:31,409
hidden and head.

77
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:32,879
And then you just paste your code

78
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:33,609
in there.

79
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:35,969
And I think that's basically it.

80
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:36,140
Yeah,

81
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:37,719
then you're done.

82
00:01:37,719 --> 00:01:40,140
Just click done and publish.

83
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,629
And that will, that will show up

84
00:01:42,629 --> 00:01:44,379
then on clarity,

85
00:01:44,379 --> 00:01:44,730
right?

86
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:45,930
It'll take a few minutes maybe and

87
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:47,260
you'll start seeing data coming in

88
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:48,219
as people visit the site

89
00:01:48,219 --> 00:01:49,170
and view it.

90
00:01:49,189 --> 00:01:51,390
So same thing then in Webflow.

91
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:53,790
If I go to Webflow, I go to one of

92
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:54,700
the templates that we

93
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:55,189
have here.

94
00:01:55,189 --> 00:01:56,129
You want to go to your site

95
00:01:56,129 --> 00:01:57,349
settings to the bottom right hand

96
00:01:57,459 --> 00:01:57,769
corner.

97
00:01:57,819 --> 00:02:03,859
Custom code over here, head code,

98
00:02:03,859 --> 00:02:09,258
paste in there, save, push, right?

99
00:02:09,258 --> 00:02:11,169
So that's how you do that.

100
00:02:11,169 --> 00:02:11,340
Let me

101
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,229
delete this.

102
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:13,990
And then the only one that has a

103
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:15,659
different installation is

104
00:02:15,659 --> 00:02:16,500
WordPress.

105
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:17,419
So WordPress is

106
00:02:17,419 --> 00:02:18,680
even easier.

107
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,180
You simply go to plug-ins, add

108
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:25,819
new, search, clarity.

109
00:02:25,819 --> 00:02:28,460
Correct off clarity.

110
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:29,819
Install now.

111
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:33,659
It's installed.

112
00:02:33,659 --> 00:02:34,400
Activate.

113
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,900
You'll then get clarity down here

114
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,460
on the left hand side.

115
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:44,060
Let load.

116
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:45,330
And from here, you can log in

117
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:45,979
directly.

118
00:02:45,979 --> 00:02:46,939
I've already signed in.

119
00:02:46,939 --> 00:02:48,669
Select your project or create a

120
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:50,550
new one, link it up and you're

121
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:51,419
good to go.

122
00:02:51,419 --> 00:02:52,879
And what the data and clarity

123
00:02:52,889 --> 00:02:54,719
looks like is something like this.

124
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,780
So let me just log in here.

125
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:01,500
Don't need a new project.

126
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,900
Let's take a look at my own

127
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,259
website.

128
00:03:05,259 --> 00:03:07,900
So it'll give you some metrics and

129
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:10,189
details, scroll depth, things like

130
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:10,430
that.

131
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:11,740
It'll give you recordings of

132
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:12,939
everyone that visits the website.

133
00:03:12,939 --> 00:03:13,569
So you can go on.

134
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:15,340
You can see how long they spent

135
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,539
here, how many

136
00:03:16,539 --> 00:03:17,340
clicks there were.

137
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,860
You see here they're on mobile.

138
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:20,060
It'll hide some things.

139
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:22,139
That's just a setting they

140
00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:23,780
have just to avoid things to do

141
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:25,439
with the privacy settings.

142
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:27,300
But basically you can see how

143
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:27,659
someone's

144
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:28,219
interacting with the page.

145
00:03:28,219 --> 00:03:30,289
You can also see heat maps, see

146
00:03:30,289 --> 00:03:32,270
where people are clicking on,

147
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,099
clicking off,

148
00:03:33,099 --> 00:03:34,479
see what areas that they're

149
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:35,990
clicking on the most and using

150
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:37,169
that information.

151
00:03:37,189 --> 00:03:37,580
Then you can

152
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:42,110
You can, uh, you can, you can, you

153
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:43,099
can set the, uh, the, the, the,

154
00:03:43,099 --> 00:03:44,460
this is over the last three days.

155
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:46,400
I said it over the last 30 or give

156
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,340
you some more.

157
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:50,300
There you go.

158
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,289
So it gives you some more data on

159
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,219
where people are clicking, what

160
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:54,620
areas they're

161
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:56,469
clicking on, uh, the information

162
00:03:56,479 --> 00:03:58,289
involved, and then you can just go

163
00:03:58,289 --> 00:04:00,300
back and you can just watch entire

164
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:03,330
recordings of, uh, of people on

165
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:05,020
the website.

166
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,969
And it just gives you an idea of

167
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:08,860
how people are

168
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,719
interacting, what, what areas you

169
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,409
can improve, what you can do to,

170
00:04:12,409 --> 00:04:14,699
uh, kind of generally get people

171
00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:14,939
to

172
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:16,689
go to the final step, which is

173
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:18,240
booking a call with you.

174
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,740
So that's a, just a quick little

175
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:20,060
tip

176
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,660
that I highly suggest you guys do.

177
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:22,939
It is completely free.

178
00:04:22,939 --> 00:04:24,379
It'll take you five minutes to set

179
00:04:24,379 --> 00:04:24,670
up and

180
00:04:24,699 --> 00:04:26,350
it will give you a ton of free

181
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:28,250
data you can use to improve your

182
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,310
landing page.

183
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:30,540
So hopefully some of you

184
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,459
guys will, uh, take this on board.

185
00:04:32,459 --> 00:04:34,199
We'll, uh, we'll, we'll do this

186
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:36,220
and, uh, get a few better results

187
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:38,060
on your landing page in general,

188
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:40,540
and we'll help you to, um, improve

189
00:04:40,649 --> 00:04:42,860
your overall performance.

190
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:44,110
And if you have any questions, any

191
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:45,500
trouble installing this, please

192
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:47,339
hit me up and I will

193
00:04:47,339 --> 00:04:48,029
