1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:00,840
All right, guys.

2
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:02,200
So in this one, we're going to go

3
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:03,640
over how to get a phone number and

4
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:04,950
how to get it approved.

5
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:06,250
You can start sending texts to

6
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:07,820
your leads, prospects, clients,

7
00:00:07,929 --> 00:00:09,150
you know, whoever you want to

8
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:09,910
reach out to.

9
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:11,679
So you're going to go to settings.

10
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:13,259
Then here, go to phone numbers.

11
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:14,859
Right now here.

12
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:16,199
You get a chance to buy a phone

13
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:16,750
number.

14
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,010
What you want to do is click add

15
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:18,789
number up here.

16
00:00:18,829 --> 00:00:20,160
So let me just move that out of

17
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:20,660
the way.

18
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:22,399
Add number, add a phone number.

19
00:00:22,429 --> 00:00:24,980
And here we want to filter.

20
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:27,230
So here you want to put local, not

21
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:28,089
toll free.

22
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:30,789
And here you want to search the

23
00:00:30,789 --> 00:00:32,649
first three digits of wherever you

24
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,600
are located or honestly, wherever

25
00:00:34,619 --> 00:00:35,399
you want.

26
00:00:35,429 --> 00:00:37,770
So I'm just going to put a pick a

27
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:38,979
random one.

28
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,869
Doesn't really matter.

29
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,030
So I'm going to take this one in

30
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:43,899
Nevada.

31
00:00:43,899 --> 00:00:45,420
Proceed to buy.

32
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:47,969
And so what you're going to do

33
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:50,920
now, what you're going to have to

34
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:53,909
do now is get your ID verified.

35
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:56,350
So let me just do that and we'll

36
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:57,579
keep going.

37
00:00:58,390 --> 00:00:58,859
All right.

38
00:00:58,899 --> 00:01:02,000
So I verified my ID or my, uh,

39
00:01:02,109 --> 00:01:03,280
yeah, my ID.

40
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:07,040
So I bought the phone number.

41
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,390
You could edit the name here.

42
00:01:10,609 --> 00:01:12,379
So first is just X out of this.

43
00:01:12,409 --> 00:01:14,769
And what you want to do is click

44
00:01:14,769 --> 00:01:15,500
here.

45
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:17,079
You could keep it as is, you know,

46
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:19,670
Henry's number, know of that, but

47
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:21,390
a couple other things you want to

48
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:22,879
change is first of all, you want

49
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:24,959
to record every call you get.

50
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:27,069
And I would just stop playing the

51
00:01:27,069 --> 00:01:28,849
record message unless you're going

52
00:01:28,939 --> 00:01:30,670
to be used, like sending this out

53
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:31,939
to people or doing stuff like

54
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:32,719
that.

55
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:34,519
I just record the calls for myself

56
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:36,340
in case I need to review something

57
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:37,959
like during the call, like my

58
00:01:37,959 --> 00:01:39,530
process or just getting some

59
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:41,480
details that happened on the call,

60
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,620
stuff like that.

61
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:44,709
So since it's internal, I prefer

62
00:01:44,709 --> 00:01:46,329
just to avoid this message, but

63
00:01:46,329 --> 00:01:47,969
you could also just say, just add

64
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:48,420
it.

65
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:49,670
It takes a second to, to say in

66
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:50,079
there.

67
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:52,170
Then you want to make sure that

68
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:53,459
whenever someone calls this

69
00:01:53,459 --> 00:01:54,989
number, it rings your phone so you

70
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:56,340
don't miss on any leads.

71
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:57,409
And then you can remove this as

72
00:01:57,409 --> 00:01:57,859
you grow.

73
00:01:57,890 --> 00:01:59,040
And maybe have someone that's

74
00:01:59,049 --> 00:02:00,269
specializes in the sales of the

75
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:00,900
business.

76
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:03,099
You can change the name and this

77
00:02:03,099 --> 00:02:04,810
call connect feature, pretty much

78
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:06,280
what it means is that before you

79
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:08,099
connect, you have to press a key.

80
00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:10,050
I prefer to remove it because it

81
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:12,150
just makes the person calling you

82
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:14,500
wait until you click that button.

83
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:16,110
I'd rather just go straight to, to

84
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:16,729
the call.

85
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:18,930
So you can click save and then we

86
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:21,680
can go into the A2P verification.

87
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:24,300
So A2P means automation to person.

88
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,389
Okay.

89
00:02:25,889 --> 00:02:27,560
And because there's like a lot of

90
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,060
scams that you get a text from

91
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:30,770
Amazon or something that you got

92
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:32,639
to update a setting, I don't know,

93
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:33,610
just scams.

94
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:35,479
Now we have to pretty much pay a

95
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:37,090
fee and, and register our

96
00:02:37,189 --> 00:02:39,219
businesses for every time we buy a

97
00:02:39,219 --> 00:02:40,400
phone number.

98
00:02:40,449 --> 00:02:42,479
So what you want to do is go to

99
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:44,840
the trust center and you want to

100
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,400
click start registering now.

101
00:02:47,939 --> 00:02:48,379
Okay.

102
00:02:48,409 --> 00:02:49,789
Now, if you followed my

103
00:02:49,789 --> 00:02:51,689
instructions and you filled out

104
00:02:51,689 --> 00:02:53,590
this information, uh, inside

105
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,060
business info, if you follow my

106
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:59,139
instructions and you fill this out

107
00:02:59,139 --> 00:03:01,530
under business info, then this

108
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:03,449
will be already filled out for

109
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:03,960
you.

110
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:04,500
Okay.

111
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:05,490
So you're just going to go here,

112
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:05,979
continue.

113
00:03:06,009 --> 00:03:07,780
Now I'm honestly, I don't need to

114
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,560
register my business again.

115
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:12,180
So I'm just going to put random

116
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,360
info here just to show you what it

117
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:15,539
looks like.

118
00:03:15,569 --> 00:03:18,159
You're going to put the address.

119
00:03:18,189 --> 00:03:19,840
As you can see, your address

120
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,740
should be already added and then

121
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:26,819
your name, email address.

122
00:03:26,849 --> 00:03:28,900
So for the email address, you want

123
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,870
to use a domain email, not like a

124
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:33,039
Gmail account, just because it'll

125
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:34,729
ask you to verify again.

126
00:03:34,789 --> 00:03:36,020
It's just, it's not ideal.

127
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:38,090
So I'm just going to put a domain

128
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:38,840
email.

129
00:03:40,659 --> 00:03:44,360
phone number, just put your phone

130
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:48,030
number and your position.

131
00:03:48,069 --> 00:03:49,090
Honestly, just put director

132
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:49,800
doesn't matter.

133
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:51,879
Then click continue.

134
00:03:52,389 --> 00:03:58,229
And here you want to put a, Oh,

135
00:03:58,229 --> 00:04:02,729
hold on.

136
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:05,060
Let me go back because yes, you

137
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:07,490
want to make sure you have an LLC,

138
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:08,770
like a tax ID.

139
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:10,159
Okay.

140
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:11,800
And then here you're going to put

141
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,650
business type, LLC, corporation,

142
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:14,680
wherever it is.

143
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:19,980
EIN here, you put a EIN, whatever

144
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:21,620
it is.

145
00:04:21,649 --> 00:04:23,550
I like to put consumer here and

146
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:25,730
then your email, same thing.

147
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:31,139
And your website.

148
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:34,240
And wherever you serve, you

149
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,269
service people.

150
00:04:36,949 --> 00:04:38,379
And then here we continue.

151
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:44,069
And here you want to select low

152
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:46,279
volume.

153
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,480
Most people need low volume.

154
00:04:47,509 --> 00:04:49,019
You don't need to send 600

155
00:04:49,019 --> 00:04:50,040
segments per day.

156
00:04:50,069 --> 00:04:51,129
That's a lot.

157
00:04:51,189 --> 00:04:54,350
You click the, you acknowledge the

158
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:57,720
fee of $24 for the registration.

159
00:04:58,790 --> 00:04:59,860
You click continue.

160
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:01,939
And then here you want to add

161
00:05:01,949 --> 00:05:04,689
essentially examples or explain

162
00:05:04,689 --> 00:05:06,920
how leads will be messaged.

163
00:05:06,949 --> 00:05:07,160
Okay.

164
00:05:07,189 --> 00:05:09,240
So there's a way to do this where

165
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,060
you really just copy and paste

166
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:11,699
stuff.

167
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:14,189
So what I use is called A2P wizard

168
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:16,670
and it's free, which is great.

169
00:05:16,709 --> 00:05:19,480
So you scroll down here, you click

170
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,959
get my free compliance kit.

171
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:24,720
And what you're going to do is you

172
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,560
put your name, so your email.

173
00:05:27,589 --> 00:05:30,870
So whatever it is, the client, the

174
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:32,689
client name is going to be you

175
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:33,370
again.

176
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:36,500
So business name and then client

177
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:41,800
website, business website.com/book

178
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,800
or/contact us, something along

179
00:05:44,019 --> 00:05:44,360
those lines.

180
00:05:44,389 --> 00:05:47,399
And here it says use HTTPS.

181
00:05:47,939 --> 00:05:50,439
Right.

182
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:53,930
And then just upload your, your

183
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:54,920
logo here.

184
00:05:54,949 --> 00:05:56,439
So again, just select your logo.

185
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:59,800
Check this box off and submit.

186
00:05:59,829 --> 00:06:01,389
And what I'll do is it'll just

187
00:06:01,389 --> 00:06:04,040
process your information and give

188
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:05,000
you everything you need

189
00:06:05,029 --> 00:06:06,420
to use just to copy and paste it

190
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:07,980
into those fields, which makes

191
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,740
your lives a thousand times

192
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:10,600
easier.

193
00:06:10,629 --> 00:06:13,399
So wait for it to load.

194
00:06:13,939 --> 00:06:16,040
Click here.

195
00:06:16,069 --> 00:06:18,439
It may take an extra second to

196
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:19,160
load.

197
00:06:19,189 --> 00:06:20,120
So just give it a bit.

198
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:23,149
It's just rendering images and

199
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:24,600
everything you need.

200
00:06:24,629 --> 00:06:27,000
So it's very easy to get approved.

201
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:31,579
OK, so just wait for the images to

202
00:06:31,589 --> 00:06:32,439
render.

203
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:33,480
OK, so as you can see, like it

204
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,579
just takes your logo and adds it

205
00:06:34,589 --> 00:06:35,639
to forms that are already

206
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:36,199
compliant.

207
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:39,019
OK, so that way you really don't

208
00:06:39,019 --> 00:06:41,079
have to do a lot of effort here.

209
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:42,170
So all you got to do is just click

210
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:42,600
copy.

211
00:06:42,629 --> 00:06:43,660
So you can see here is use case

212
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:44,360
description.

213
00:06:44,389 --> 00:06:44,920
You copy this.

214
00:06:44,949 --> 00:06:45,639
You copy this.

215
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:47,639
You go back into root flow or

216
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:48,500
sorry, the go high level.

217
00:06:48,629 --> 00:06:51,019
I just it's that's the the domain

218
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:51,800
I'm using.

219
00:06:51,829 --> 00:06:53,319
But go high level.

220
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:54,750
You paste it in the under use case

221
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:55,399
description.

222
00:06:57,269 --> 00:06:57,959
And then same thing.

223
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:58,920
Sample message one.

224
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:01,920
You go back to A2P wizard sample

225
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,759
message one.

226
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:05,560
Go back here and paste it.

227
00:07:05,589 --> 00:07:06,279
Message two.

228
00:07:06,819 --> 00:07:10,279
Copy the second message.

229
00:07:10,819 --> 00:07:12,279
Paste it.

230
00:07:12,819 --> 00:07:14,279
Continue.

231
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,639
Here you go back again.

232
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:18,120
Same thing.

233
00:07:18,149 --> 00:07:19,160
Go to A2P wizard.

234
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:20,120
You can send copy.

235
00:07:20,629 --> 00:07:22,009
Just copy that.

236
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,720
Paste it in here.

237
00:07:24,259 --> 00:07:26,519
Opt in message.

238
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:27,399
Go right here.

239
00:07:27,939 --> 00:07:32,199
Paste here and then you submit.

240
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:33,399
OK, so I'm not going to submit

241
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:35,000
because I don't really want to

242
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:35,720
submit.

243
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:36,810
Like I don't need to submit it.

244
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:38,019
But you submit and then you got to

245
00:07:38,029 --> 00:07:39,160
wait until it's approved.

246
00:07:39,189 --> 00:07:40,519
So for the brand approval.

247
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:41,810
So there's two applications I go

248
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:42,360
through.

249
00:07:42,389 --> 00:07:43,959
First is the brand, which is to

250
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:45,689
make sure you your business is

251
00:07:45,689 --> 00:07:46,899
real, that you are legit.

252
00:07:47,029 --> 00:07:48,459
You actually have that LLC or EIN

253
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:49,230
or whatever.

254
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:50,759
And then once it's approved, they

255
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:51,879
go into the campaign.

256
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:53,870
So to make sure that the brand is

257
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:55,519
approved, you have to make sure

258
00:07:55,629 --> 00:07:57,000
that the legal business

259
00:07:57,029 --> 00:07:58,269
thing that you put in there is

260
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:00,040
actually your legal business name.

261
00:08:00,069 --> 00:08:04,930
So if your legal name is XYZ Corp

262
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:06,620
LLC, you know, whatever it is, but

263
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:07,879
your actual name

264
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:10,370
that you use online is like Legion

265
00:08:10,379 --> 00:08:12,339
Mastermind, you know, whatever it

266
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:12,600
is.

267
00:08:12,629 --> 00:08:14,870
Don't put Legion Mastermind put in

268
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,839
the XYZ Corp LLC.

269
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:18,120
Like that is the legal name.

270
00:08:18,149 --> 00:08:19,649
And that's the one you have to use

271
00:08:19,649 --> 00:08:21,240
for the application.

272
00:08:21,269 --> 00:08:23,180
If you use the wrong name, even if

273
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:24,910
it's if you forget to put like a

274
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:26,680
capitalized letter in there,

275
00:08:26,709 --> 00:08:27,639
it'll get denied.

276
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:29,019
So it needs to be exactly the

277
00:08:29,019 --> 00:08:29,480
same.

278
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:32,279
So whenever you you filed or you

279
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:34,429
you got your EIN number, there's

280
00:08:34,429 --> 00:08:36,360
going to be a letter or a form

281
00:08:36,389 --> 00:08:38,590
you filled out that pretty much

282
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,120
gives you that EIN.

283
00:08:40,149 --> 00:08:41,480
And next to it is your legal name.

284
00:08:41,509 --> 00:08:42,960
Just check that form out and

285
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,340
you'll see exactly the name you

286
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:46,019
need to use for this application.

287
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:47,399
And then once you do that, you

288
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:48,509
should be good to go.

289
00:08:48,549 --> 00:08:50,149
So I have my applications have

290
00:08:50,149 --> 00:08:51,840
never failed since using A2P

291
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,519
Wizard.

292
00:08:52,549 --> 00:08:54,039
So expect it to go through.

293
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:56,440
And if it fails, if the brand

294
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,440
fails, usually means that the EIN

295
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,639
was wrong or the name of the

296
00:08:59,639 --> 00:08:59,850
business

297
00:08:59,909 --> 00:09:00,600
was wrong.

298
00:09:00,629 --> 00:09:00,919
Okay.

299
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:02,009
Something along those lines.

300
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:03,240
All right.

301
00:09:03,269 --> 00:09:06,830
So now the way it'll work when you

302
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:09,159
send the application is first,

303
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:09,720
you're going to go through

304
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:10,100
the brand.

305
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:11,210
Once the brand is approved, you're

306
00:09:11,289 --> 00:09:12,120
going to get an email.

307
00:09:12,149 --> 00:09:13,210
And then once you get that email,

308
00:09:13,289 --> 00:09:14,519
you got to go back in here and

309
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:15,559
submit the campaign,

310
00:09:17,429 --> 00:09:19,440
the campaign application, it will

311
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,870
already be filled out with

312
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:22,120
everything you added.

313
00:09:22,149 --> 00:09:23,490
You just have to click submit one

314
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:24,679
more time and that's it.

315
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:25,000
Okay.

316
00:09:25,029 --> 00:09:27,799
So that is it for this one.

317
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:29,110
I know it's kind of a lot of stuff

318
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,809
to send that application, but once

319
00:09:30,809 --> 00:09:31,399
you do it,

320
00:09:31,429 --> 00:09:32,679
you can buy more numbers for your

321
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:33,879
business without any issues.

322
00:09:33,909 --> 00:09:35,960
And yeah, it's just a one-time

323
00:09:36,019 --> 00:09:36,440
thing.

324
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:36,919
Okay.

325
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:37,720
See you in the next one.
