1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:05,070
All right, for this video series,

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:06,860
I'm going to talk about RY

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:07,830
calculators.

4
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:09,970
So, over the next few videos, I'm

5
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:12,000
going to show you a comprehensive

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,400
guide on how to build

7
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:15,910
them from scratch with a live

8
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:17,519
Watho example.

9
00:00:17,539 --> 00:00:19,570
So, in this GammaDoc, you're going

10
00:00:19,629 --> 00:00:21,440
to see four main components.

11
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:23,429
The first one is what is an RY

12
00:00:23,539 --> 00:00:25,530
calculator and why you need it on

13
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:26,239
your VSL.

14
00:00:26,899 --> 00:00:29,660
And the second thing is you have

15
00:00:29,969 --> 00:00:32,719
to understand the logic of an RY

16
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:34,469
calculator, first using

17
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:35,679
Google Sheets.

18
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,609
And then, once you understand the

19
00:00:37,789 --> 00:00:39,600
logic, you're going to use Claude

20
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,590
to build certain prompts.

21
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,159
I'm going to show you the basics

22
00:00:43,159 --> 00:00:44,740
of prompt engineering using a

23
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:46,719
method that I use every day.

24
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:49,070
And then, only then, are we going

25
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:52,000
to deploy this as a tool, as a

26
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,759
"marketing tool"

27
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:56,079
that you can use on your VSL.

28
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,840
So, without further ado, or any

29
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,060
other French words, I'll get

30
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:02,479
straight into the first part of

31
00:01:02,509 --> 00:01:02,560
it.

32
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:07,549
All right, section one, what is an

33
00:01:07,569 --> 00:01:09,359
RY calculator?

34
00:01:09,379 --> 00:01:11,040
Why do you need it on your VSL?

35
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:16,480
RY calculators are just tools that

36
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,870
shows the prospect exactly how

37
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:20,560
much money they'll make,

38
00:01:20,579 --> 00:01:23,030
or save by working with you.

39
00:01:23,219 --> 00:01:26,370
It's not just a calculator.

40
00:01:26,579 --> 00:01:28,569
It is actually a sales weapon that

41
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:30,799
does the convincing part for you.

42
00:01:30,819 --> 00:01:33,329
People buy when they see clear

43
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:37,840
financial benefit and not just the

44
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,090
impressive features that your

45
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:40,150
service offers.

46
00:01:41,219 --> 00:01:43,390
And the next logical question is,

47
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:46,189
do traditional sales methods fall

48
00:01:46,219 --> 00:01:47,040
short?

49
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:48,159
The answer is yes or no.

50
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:49,439
Let me explain.

51
00:01:49,459 --> 00:01:51,569
Your prospects simply cannot

52
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:53,040
visualize the value.

53
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:54,319
Okay?

54
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:56,000
And the common mistakes that

55
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:57,909
usually occur are, you end up

56
00:01:58,189 --> 00:02:00,079
being vague on these sales calls.

57
00:02:00,099 --> 00:02:00,640
Talk about,

58
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:02,790
"Oh, we'll increase your

59
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,689
efficiency instead of actually

60
00:02:04,689 --> 00:02:05,959
quantifying it."

61
00:02:06,019 --> 00:02:07,500
And you'll say, "Hey, we'll save

62
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,000
you time."

63
00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:09,819
It's not measurable in your

64
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:10,639
prospect's head.

65
00:02:10,659 --> 00:02:13,810
And leading with testimonials.

66
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:15,360
Sure, this is good.

67
00:02:15,379 --> 00:02:16,900
But then it is not personalized

68
00:02:16,909 --> 00:02:19,030
enough for the prospects to give a

69
00:02:19,229 --> 00:02:20,240
crap about you just yet.

70
00:02:20,259 --> 00:02:21,990
So this is where

71
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:26,009
this is when the prospects usually

72
00:02:26,009 --> 00:02:27,590
tell you, "Hey, honestly, let me

73
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:29,120
think about it or some variation

74
00:02:29,139 --> 00:02:29,349
of it."

75
00:02:29,379 --> 00:02:30,719
And then they'll go shoot, right?

76
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:33,289
Then the next thing is going to be

77
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:36,280
the VSL framework that Daniel's

78
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,569
teaching you right now.

79
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,199
According to that framework, the

80
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,120
third component is the ROI

81
00:02:41,469 --> 00:02:42,000
calculator.

82
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:43,750
This creates that mate desire

83
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:45,580
within your prospect to work with

84
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:47,120
you and also puts a sense of

85
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,020
urgency in them.

86
00:02:48,099 --> 00:02:51,490
So in this series, you're going to

87
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,699
learn how to build these

88
00:02:52,699 --> 00:02:53,990
calculators even if you've never

89
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:55,009
used AI before.

90
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:56,240
Okay, spoiler alert.

91
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:57,439
We're going to use AI to build

92
00:02:57,439 --> 00:02:57,840
this.

93
00:02:59,219 --> 00:03:01,219
And the next thing is we're going

94
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:03,310
to go over three proven calculator

95
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:05,110
templates for different business

96
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:05,520
models.

97
00:03:05,539 --> 00:03:08,050
And then you're going to learn how

98
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:10,150
to embed them anywhere.

99
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:11,520
You know, it could be a website.

100
00:03:11,539 --> 00:03:13,039
It could be a presentation.

101
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,960
It could be emails anywhere.

102
00:03:14,979 --> 00:03:16,490
And then the last thing is I'm

103
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,740
going to teach you advanced

104
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:20,599
prompting techniques using a

105
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:20,979
method

106
00:03:21,379 --> 00:03:23,159
that I will explain in a later

107
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:25,599
video to build exactly what you

108
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:26,400
need.

109
00:03:26,419 --> 00:03:27,930
And by the end of this video

110
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:30,080
series, you'll have your own ROI

111
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:31,590
calculator that does the heavy

112
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:32,310
lifting

113
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:34,240
in your sales process.

114
00:03:34,259 --> 00:03:36,710
There's no more hoping that the

115
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:38,800
prospects just get it magically.

116
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:41,030
They'll actually see the potential

117
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:43,039
ROI in quantifiable numbers.

118
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:45,319
That is very important.

119
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:47,099
Okay.
