1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:00,710
All right.

2
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:01,990
Section two.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,379
So in this section, I'm going to

4
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:05,830
help you understand the logic

5
00:00:05,919 --> 00:00:07,710
of an ROI calculator first with

6
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:08,750
Google Sheets.

7
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:10,859
You know, see, all calculators are

8
00:00:10,949 --> 00:00:11,720
just numbers

9
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:12,679
plugged into a formula.

10
00:00:12,759 --> 00:00:13,949
If you don't even understand the

11
00:00:13,949 --> 00:00:15,349
math, then the tool is useless.

12
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:17,039
I'm not going to share my screen,

13
00:00:17,059 --> 00:00:18,929
but that Google Sheet, so you can

14
00:00:18,929 --> 00:00:21,010
clearly understand the math

15
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:22,730
behind this process.

16
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:25,120
Also, don't ask me to share editor

17
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,449
access with you.

18
00:00:26,449 --> 00:00:28,000
Just make a copy of it

19
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:29,050
and see for yourself.

20
00:00:29,079 --> 00:00:30,460
Do not ask me editor access.

21
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,320
All right.

22
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,520
Now that you can see my Google

23
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:35,859
Sheet,

24
00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:37,759
the first thing that we're going

25
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:39,500
to look at is if you're running

26
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,530
paid ads as a service and

27
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:43,570
specifically the VSL, the book

28
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:44,429
call fund.

29
00:00:44,679 --> 00:00:46,789
Let me explain all the inputs and

30
00:00:46,789 --> 00:00:48,280
all the calculated

31
00:00:48,759 --> 00:00:50,270
outputs that we are showing that

32
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:52,270
we are going to show on this ROI

33
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:53,340
calculator.

34
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:54,299
So the first one

35
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:56,509
is you've input the following.

36
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:58,329
You ask the user to input ad

37
00:00:58,329 --> 00:01:01,399
spend, the CPM and the CTR.

38
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:02,399
Based off of

39
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:03,740
this, you're going to get the

40
00:01:03,869 --> 00:01:05,219
total impressions, which is ad

41
00:01:05,219 --> 00:01:06,700
spend by CPM times thousand.

42
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:07,659
You're going to

43
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,579
get the unique clicks, which is

44
00:01:09,579 --> 00:01:11,349
CTR, this one times the total

45
00:01:11,349 --> 00:01:13,109
impressions and the cost work

46
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,340
click, which is

47
00:01:14,359 --> 00:01:16,340
ad spend by this value.

48
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,790
Once we get all that, we're going

49
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:22,219
to input as the user to input the

50
00:01:22,219 --> 00:01:22,219
unique

51
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:23,909
page visits, the total

52
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:26,450
applications and the total cost.

53
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:28,859
Based off that, we can calculate

54
00:01:28,859 --> 00:01:30,069
these four

55
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:31,109
variables.

56
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:33,420
The application rate, which is the

57
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,180
total number of applications

58
00:01:35,269 --> 00:01:37,219
divided by the unique page

59
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:37,930
visits.

60
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:41,829
The cost per application, which is

61
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:44,400
the total ad spend, this one by

62
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:47,099
the total number of applications.

63
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,090
And the booked call rate is the

64
00:01:49,099 --> 00:01:51,340
number of calls booked divided by

65
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:53,700
the unique page visits.

66
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,700
And then you get your

67
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:57,159
cost per booked call, which is the

68
00:01:57,370 --> 00:01:59,450
total ad spend by the total calls

69
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:00,090
booked.

70
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:03,579
After that, you now get total live

71
00:02:03,579 --> 00:02:03,930
calls.

72
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,150
How many people are actually

73
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:06,219
showing up?

74
00:02:06,219 --> 00:02:06,969
How many

75
00:02:07,569 --> 00:02:08,550
deals did you close?

76
00:02:08,689 --> 00:02:10,508
What is the average sale price?

77
00:02:10,508 --> 00:02:13,780
Based off this, we get show rate.

78
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:17,099
We get the cost per live call.

79
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:20,340
We get the close rate, the total

80
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,699
revenue and the ROAS.

81
00:02:21,699 --> 00:02:25,219
The formula for all of them are

82
00:02:25,219 --> 00:02:26,800
explicitly mentioned here.

83
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:30,189
So only once you do this for your

84
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:32,189
own business model, would you even

85
00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:34,860
get an understanding as to what

86
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:37,099
prompt to even give Claude.

87
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:41,139
Now let's look at cold email lead

88
00:02:41,139 --> 00:02:42,930
generation.

89
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:44,960
So for cold email lead generation,

90
00:02:45,139 --> 00:02:49,370
let's say you are running a $500

91
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,069
per month tech fee plus $300,

92
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:54,340
which is the cost per call.

93
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:57,479
That is the $300 that you're

94
00:02:57,479 --> 00:02:59,000
charging the client when the call

95
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,860
actually happens.

96
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,710
So to select the tech fee package,

97
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:06,659
let's say you have 50,000 emails

98
00:03:06,659 --> 00:03:09,099
per month, which is at $500,000,

99
00:03:09,099 --> 00:03:11,389
100,000 emails a month, which is

100
00:03:11,509 --> 00:03:14,080
at $1,000, and 200,000 emails a

101
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,219
month, which is at $2,000.

102
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,210
So you have to have the cost per

103
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:17,490
month, which is at $500,000.

104
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:17,500
So you have to make that a drop

105
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:17,539
down.

106
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,360
You have to get the logic of this

107
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:19,900
right.

108
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:23,289
And input the number of emails

109
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,449
that you send per contact.

110
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:27,120
And then you're going to ask the

111
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,000
user to input the cost per call.

112
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,379
And then you would be inputting

113
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:33,080
this here because you set the cost

114
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,889
per call before half another sales

115
00:03:34,889 --> 00:03:35,409
call.

116
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:38,860
Then we're creating reply rate

117
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,229
sliders and pasta reply rate

118
00:03:41,229 --> 00:03:42,180
sliders.

119
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:45,370
For the sake of this example, I've

120
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:47,060
used these inputs.

121
00:03:47,539 --> 00:03:51,069
Based off of this, the total

122
00:03:51,069 --> 00:03:53,129
people contacted per month is

123
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:54,909
$25,000.

124
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,199
How do we come up with this?

125
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,289
This is equal to the total emails

126
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:00,060
per month divided by the emails

127
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,340
sent per contact.

128
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:03,039
So $50,000 divided by T, which is

129
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:04,039
$25,000.

130
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,900
The second thing is the total

131
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,610
number of people that have

132
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:08,439
replied.

133
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:11,289
This is 2% times this, which is

134
00:04:11,539 --> 00:04:12,819
500.

135
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,050
And the total number of pasta

136
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:18,319
replies, you would actually get

137
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:21,250
this as 12.5% of 500, which is

138
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,339
$62.5, but you need to round it

139
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:23,980
down.

140
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,660
So you need to use the floor

141
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,930
function here on Google Sheets.

142
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:29,930
And then the next step is the

143
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,220
conversion part of it.

144
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,069
How many calls were booked from

145
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:37,180
the pasta replies?

146
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:39,870
25% of them.

147
00:04:39,899 --> 00:04:44,160
So out of these 62 pasta replies,

148
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,290
you book a fourth of them.

149
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:49,310
So you end up getting 15 booked

150
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:50,149
calls.

151
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:52,149
This is the rounded down number of

152
00:04:52,149 --> 00:04:53,920
the total pasta replies times the

153
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:55,139
call booking rate.

154
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:59,019
And then what is the close rate?

155
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:00,579
The close rate is 25%.

156
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,569
So this is the rounded down number

157
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,459
of the total calls booked times

158
00:05:04,529 --> 00:05:05,660
the close rate.

159
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,889
And what is the average sale

160
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:10,350
price?

161
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:12,000
Based on the average sale price,

162
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,089
you can then generate net new

163
00:05:14,089 --> 00:05:16,699
monthly revenue generated, which

164
00:05:16,699 --> 00:05:17,980
is going to be $30,000,

165
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,779
which is equal to the total number

166
00:05:19,779 --> 00:05:21,259
of clients closed times the

167
00:05:21,259 --> 00:05:22,579
average sale price.

168
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,430
And based off of this, Zoom

169
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,730
calculate, what you pay the

170
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:29,990
agency, what they pay you with

171
00:05:30,089 --> 00:05:30,949
that month,

172
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,370
which is equal to the tech fee

173
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:33,990
cost, plus the number of calls

174
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,740
booked times the cost per call.

175
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:38,120
So that is going to be $500,000

176
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,449
plus 15 times $300,000, which is

177
00:05:40,449 --> 00:05:41,540
$4,500.

178
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:44,300
Add that $500,000, you get $5,000.

179
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:46,290
And then you're going to show them

180
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:48,910
the customer acquisition costs.

181
00:05:48,939 --> 00:05:50,240
So they just paid you $5,000.

182
00:05:50,259 --> 00:05:52,579
You got them three clients.

183
00:05:53,819 --> 00:05:56,209
Their CAC, customer acquisition

184
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:59,170
cost is $1,667, US.

185
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:02,560
And the return on their investment

186
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,220
is they just put in $5,000 and

187
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:08,250
they're getting $30,000 out of it.

188
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:10,160
$6,000 right there.

189
00:06:10,589 --> 00:06:12,939
That is how you explain the math

190
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:13,939
to them.

191
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,959
So let's go to the next one, which

192
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,339
is going to be the LinkedIn

193
00:06:18,339 --> 00:06:19,100
outbound.

194
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,060
Let's say you're running lead gen,

195
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,850
but purely through LinkedIn.

196
00:06:22,899 --> 00:06:24,870
So this is where you would talk

197
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,069
about how many market qualified

198
00:06:27,069 --> 00:06:28,529
leads that are going to be

199
00:06:28,569 --> 00:06:29,480
contacted.

200
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:30,370
800.

201
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:32,480
What is the connection acceptance

202
00:06:33,149 --> 00:06:33,600
rate?

203
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:34,310
60%.

204
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:36,730
So based off this, you're going to

205
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,100
get total connections accepted.

206
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:42,629
And then what is the reply rate?

207
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,149
So once these people accept a

208
00:06:44,149 --> 00:06:46,170
connection, automatically you send

209
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:47,220
them a message.

210
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,540
So 40% of those people reply to

211
00:06:49,779 --> 00:06:50,060
you.

212
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:53,589
So you get 192 total replies.

213
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:56,199
F7 times C&I.

214
00:06:57,579 --> 00:06:59,550
And the positive reply rate,

215
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:02,170
usually for LinkedIn campaigns, is

216
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:04,040
high because you are reaching out

217
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,769
to a personalized set of very few

218
00:07:05,769 --> 00:07:06,230
people.

219
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,449
So I'd like cold email.

220
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:10,310
So your positive reply rate would

221
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,420
end up being 40%.

222
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:14,410
If it ends up being 40%, the

223
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:16,550
number of total positive replies

224
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:18,709
you get is 40% of this number,

225
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,800
which is 76 right there.

226
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:24,720
And out of these positive replies,

227
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:27,009
76 of them, you are now booking

228
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:29,220
40% of them on the calls.

229
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,959
So you've now successfully booked

230
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:33,339
30 calls.

231
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,910
This is total positive reply,

232
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:36,189
stats call booking rate.

233
00:07:36,379 --> 00:07:36,649
Great.

234
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,259
And now based on the close rate,

235
00:07:39,329 --> 00:07:42,490
20%, you've closed this person six

236
00:07:42,569 --> 00:07:43,699
new deals.

237
00:07:44,769 --> 00:07:47,230
And here you can now show this

238
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:49,949
person what is the customer

239
00:07:49,949 --> 00:07:52,199
acquisition cost.

240
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:53,629
And here we're making an

241
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:55,649
assumption that you charge these

242
00:07:55,689 --> 00:07:58,269
people a flat retainer of $2,500 a

243
00:07:58,509 --> 00:07:59,019
month.

244
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,009
So if they pay you $2,500 a month

245
00:08:01,269 --> 00:08:03,069
and you get them six clients, the

246
00:08:03,069 --> 00:08:04,670
customer acquisition cost is

247
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:06,339
$2,500 by six.

248
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,610
The net no monthly revenue that's

249
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,949
added is $30,000.

250
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,860
And what is the ROI?

251
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,819
How would you calculate with the

252
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:15,199
ROI?

253
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,500
That is the $30,000 divided by the

254
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,850
money that they pay you, which is

255
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:22,579
12X right here.

256
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,209
So this is how you understand the

257
00:08:24,209 --> 00:08:26,009
logic, understand the math behind

258
00:08:26,069 --> 00:08:26,980
the whole thing.

259
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:28,339
I'll see you on the next one.
