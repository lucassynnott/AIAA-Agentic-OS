1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,780
All right, fourth and final video

2
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:02,730
of this series.

3
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:04,950
So in this video, I'm going to

4
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,879
show you how I went and built the

5
00:00:07,879 --> 00:00:09,400
exact prompts using Claude.

6
00:00:09,419 --> 00:00:10,759
I'm just going to run you through

7
00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:11,320
the outputs.

8
00:00:11,609 --> 00:00:13,900
And then I'm going to explain why

9
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:16,379
Vercel is the superior model to

10
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:18,100
build these ROI calculators.

11
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,230
And then I'm going to throw in a

12
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:20,269
little bonus at the end.

13
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,739
All right, let's get into it.

14
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:23,589
All right, the way that you build

15
00:00:23,589 --> 00:00:25,510
these prompts is you actually tell

16
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:26,120
Claude,

17
00:00:26,329 --> 00:00:27,679
hey, this is exactly how I

18
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:29,760
inputted it onto the Google Sheet.

19
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,730
And attach a screenshot of the

20
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:33,619
Google Sheet to Claude so it can

21
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:34,979
come up with the logic

22
00:00:35,179 --> 00:00:36,700
and understand it visually as

23
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:38,600
well, apart from just throwing a

24
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,390
bunch of formula at it, right?

25
00:00:40,659 --> 00:00:42,240
So now we're going to take a look

26
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:44,060
at the VSL to book a call funnel.

27
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,520
I'm going to highlight it with my

28
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,759
cursor so that you guys see it

29
00:00:48,759 --> 00:00:50,509
because this is not visible.

30
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,789
I don't know why it's doing this.

31
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:55,100
So first one, let's take a look at

32
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:55,750
this.

33
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,219
Build a comprehensive VSL to book

34
00:00:58,219 --> 00:00:59,159
a call funnel.

35
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:01,479
And it's giving the overall layout

36
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:02,560
requirements.

37
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:04,000
Create a clean professional

38
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,730
interface.

39
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:05,959
Three distinct sections

40
00:01:06,069 --> 00:01:07,519
representing the three steps of

41
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:08,280
the funnel.

42
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:10,239
And then step one.

43
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:12,790
And this should automatically

44
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:14,379
calculate that.

45
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:17,040
Now step two.

46
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:19,689
This step should automatically

47
00:01:19,689 --> 00:01:20,760
calculate this.

48
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:23,230
If you look at this, it's exactly

49
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:25,659
the same thing that we did from

50
00:01:25,659 --> 00:01:27,420
the Google Sheet.

51
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:28,790
I'm just doing the exact same

52
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:29,560
thing here.

53
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:30,769
Step three is the revenue

54
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:31,609
analysis.

55
00:01:31,819 --> 00:01:34,310
We put this information and then

56
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:36,730
we should and it should say, all

57
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:38,299
right, calculate this immediately.

58
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:40,810
And then we provide the technical

59
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:42,590
requirements so that AI does not

60
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:44,260
make its own assumptions.

61
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,209
We don't want the AI to make those

62
00:01:46,209 --> 00:01:47,319
assumptions.

63
00:01:48,849 --> 00:01:50,769
And then step four is the visual

64
00:01:50,859 --> 00:01:52,409
design requirement.

65
00:01:52,819 --> 00:01:54,730
Use a modern card-based design

66
00:01:54,819 --> 00:01:57,349
with subtle shadows, all that.

67
00:01:57,609 --> 00:01:58,959
And then the last one is

68
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:00,760
additional features.

69
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,700
If you take a look at this second

70
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,870
prompt as well, it starts with S,

71
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,599
situation and context.

72
00:02:06,859 --> 00:02:09,150
Comprehensive ROI calculator as a

73
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:11,360
React component using modern

74
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,289
tailwind CSS styling.

75
00:02:14,069 --> 00:02:15,280
This tool helps businesses

76
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,669
evaluate the economics of

77
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:18,360
partnering with a B-generation

78
00:02:18,379 --> 00:02:19,840
agency for B2B cold email

79
00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:21,159
marketing campaigns.

80
00:02:21,379 --> 00:02:21,520
Great.

81
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:24,699
Overall application and structure.

82
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:26,479
And then provide step one.

83
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:28,080
Give the input elements.

84
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,259
And then provide the calculated

85
00:02:30,259 --> 00:02:31,539
display fields.

86
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,340
Do you see that given that we

87
00:02:34,349 --> 00:02:36,969
explicitly said on that Google

88
00:02:37,669 --> 00:02:39,509
Sheet, it has to be the floor

89
00:02:39,509 --> 00:02:40,259
function.

90
00:02:40,789 --> 00:02:43,229
Now it's saying rounded down using

91
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,759
math.floor.

92
00:02:44,939 --> 00:02:45,780
This is very important.

93
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:47,159
And now step two.

94
00:02:47,449 --> 00:02:50,240
These are your inputs.

95
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:52,789
And then this should immediately

96
00:02:52,789 --> 00:02:55,639
calculate the following outputs.

97
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,449
And now we're going to talk about

98
00:02:57,449 --> 00:02:59,500
the advanced interactive features.

99
00:02:59,939 --> 00:03:01,469
Now we're going to go down to the

100
00:03:01,469 --> 00:03:03,050
technical implementation

101
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:04,159
requirements.

102
00:03:04,419 --> 00:03:06,069
And then you see the visual

103
00:03:06,069 --> 00:03:09,020
specifications, UX, enhancements,

104
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,060
et cetera.

105
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,710
And finally, we're going to talk

106
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:13,120
about the formula transparency

107
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,539
because in this case, we want to

108
00:03:14,629 --> 00:03:16,169
make sure that the formula is

109
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:17,870
transparent and the AI does not

110
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:18,620
make assumptions.

111
00:03:18,909 --> 00:03:20,360
Because the AI is literal and it

112
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:21,909
will try to interpret it in a

113
00:03:21,909 --> 00:03:22,900
certain way.

114
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:24,020
You don't want that happening.

115
00:03:24,229 --> 00:03:26,099
You want to be the one in control.

116
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,699
So that's why your input has to be

117
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:29,620
really, really, really good.

118
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:30,740
And what did I say?

119
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:32,340
If your inputs are shit, your

120
00:03:32,409 --> 00:03:33,599
outputs are dog shit.

121
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:35,080
And I'll say that again.

122
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:36,810
Prop three.

123
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:38,689
LinkedIn lead generation ROI

124
00:03:38,689 --> 00:03:39,610
tabulator.

125
00:03:39,909 --> 00:03:41,740
Boom.

126
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:42,930
Situation and context.

127
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:43,469
Right there.

128
00:03:43,659 --> 00:03:45,979
In our application and structure,

129
00:03:45,979 --> 00:03:49,030
it talks about the input section

130
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:51,370
that talks about this.

131
00:03:51,699 --> 00:03:53,370
And then we have the calculated

132
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:55,330
output section, which talks about

133
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:56,120
this.

134
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:57,669
And then we have the advanced

135
00:03:57,669 --> 00:03:59,740
interactive elements and features,

136
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,860
implementation specifications.

137
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:03,990
After that, we have the visual

138
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:06,699
requirements, UX requirements, and

139
00:04:06,699 --> 00:04:08,870
then the mobile responsiveness

140
00:04:08,939 --> 00:04:11,139
just to make sure that it is, you

141
00:04:11,139 --> 00:04:13,169
know, good to be used on a cell

142
00:04:13,189 --> 00:04:14,509
phone as well.

143
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:16,889
And then formula transparency and

144
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:18,879
education, and you are giving it

145
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:21,160
error handling, et cetera, because

146
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,009
you want to explicitly specify

147
00:04:23,009 --> 00:04:24,160
those things.

148
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,329
So just copy the entire prompt for

149
00:04:26,329 --> 00:04:28,730
the calculator you want to build.

150
00:04:29,029 --> 00:04:31,100
Face it directly onto v0.apps

151
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,449
input field, submit, and let the

152
00:04:33,449 --> 00:04:35,750
AI generate your calculator.

153
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,509
It's literally that simple.

154
00:04:37,709 --> 00:04:39,220
And I'm going to show you exactly

155
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,740
that in the second part of this

156
00:04:40,819 --> 00:04:41,319
video.

157
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,160
All right, what is Vercel?

158
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,980
It's a cloud platform that makes

159
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,800
it really easy to deploy and host

160
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,160
web applications.

161
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:53,199
It's Vercel, V-E-R-C-E-L.com.

162
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:54,930
And the tool that we'll be using

163
00:04:54,939 --> 00:04:57,050
to build this is called v0.app.

164
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,370
And there's the link to that right

165
00:04:58,490 --> 00:04:58,879
there.

166
00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:00,870
V0.app is an LLM that helps you

167
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:02,730
build interactive websites,

168
00:05:03,019 --> 00:05:04,759
landing pages, sales assets, et

169
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:05,439
cetera.

170
00:05:05,649 --> 00:05:07,269
And in our case, we're going to

171
00:05:07,269 --> 00:05:09,250
use v0.app to build actual ROI

172
00:05:09,579 --> 00:05:10,439
calculators.

173
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:12,810
There are like a couple of other

174
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:14,230
tools in the market that you can

175
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,819
use to build this ROI calculator.

176
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:16,939
So one's called Lovable.

177
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:18,399
You guys are probably familiar

178
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:18,930
with it.

179
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:20,319
Probably not, but that's fine.

180
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:21,990
And the other one is called Bolt.

181
00:05:22,019 --> 00:05:24,459
Lovable and Bolt are both

182
00:05:24,459 --> 00:05:27,389
AI-assisted coding environments

183
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,389
that help you make this web

184
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:32,259
application.

185
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:34,060
But the process of hosting them

186
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,660
and deploying them is like a

187
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:37,600
little bit more complex than that

188
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,420
of Vercel.

189
00:05:38,589 --> 00:05:40,750
So due to the simplicity, we're

190
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,819
going to use that to build the

191
00:05:42,819 --> 00:05:43,829
calculators.

192
00:05:44,329 --> 00:05:45,740
Now we're going to take a look at

193
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:47,540
the chat window on v0.app to

194
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:49,300
fundamentally understand this

195
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,560
building process.

196
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,519
To build these calculators, you

197
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:54,139
simply have to take the prompt

198
00:05:54,139 --> 00:05:55,670
that Claude built for you and

199
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:56,980
pastes it on Vercel.

200
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:58,189
Let's look at it.

201
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:01,019
All right.

202
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:04,240
Now we are on v0.app.

203
00:06:05,819 --> 00:06:07,730
All I said, now build me this ROI

204
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,899
calculator from the pasted text

205
00:06:09,899 --> 00:06:11,819
and just pasted the text.

206
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:14,420
This is the calculator that I got.

207
00:06:14,709 --> 00:06:15,639
Boom.

208
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:17,579
Email marketing, ROI calculator.

209
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:20,050
Step one, not read setup, response

210
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:20,720
rates.

211
00:06:20,949 --> 00:06:21,740
You see that?

212
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,620
The drop down.

213
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:24,720
You can choose your options.

214
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:28,040
For the sake of this example, let

215
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,100
me choose these many.

216
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:37,040
And let's do 350 for call.

217
00:06:37,329 --> 00:06:40,439
And also, let's do a 2.1% reply

218
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:44,379
rate and a 12.4% or a 12% pasted

219
00:06:44,379 --> 00:06:45,810
reply rate.

220
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:48,939
So these are the total number of

221
00:06:48,939 --> 00:06:51,220
people that replied.

222
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:53,350
And it's explaining how you got

223
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:54,800
that number and the total number

224
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:56,420
of positive replies right here.

225
00:06:56,689 --> 00:06:57,009
Round it down.

226
00:06:57,339 --> 00:06:58,759
And this talks about the sales,

227
00:06:58,829 --> 00:07:00,379
conversion, and the ROI part of

228
00:07:00,449 --> 00:07:00,839
it.

229
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,350
Let's say your call booking rate

230
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:04,519
is 29%.

231
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:08,240
And your close rate is only 21%.

232
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:10,819
So for 36 calls booked, you are

233
00:07:10,819 --> 00:07:12,579
closing seven clients.

234
00:07:12,829 --> 00:07:14,980
That is $70,000 in net new monthly

235
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:16,230
revenue generated.

236
00:07:17,009 --> 00:07:18,699
And what we pay the agency that

237
00:07:18,699 --> 00:07:21,750
month is a $1,000 tech fee plus 36

238
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,550
calls times 350.

239
00:07:23,779 --> 00:07:25,480
And your customer acquisition

240
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,980
costs is right there.

241
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,089
And now we have an ROI summary,

242
00:07:29,089 --> 00:07:31,189
which is monthly investment is

243
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,959
$13,600.

244
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:35,639
Your revenue is $70,000.

245
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:38,110
Your ROI percentage is this much,

246
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:39,779
which is excellent.

247
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,699
So it's about five, right?

248
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:42,180
Which is great.

249
00:07:42,579 --> 00:07:43,959
All I did, now build me this ROI

250
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:45,600
calculator from the pasted text,

251
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,939
and I literally pasted the text.

252
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,110
If I show you the pasted text,

253
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,420
it's the exact same thing.

254
00:07:51,709 --> 00:07:54,279
All 76 lines of it.

255
00:07:54,649 --> 00:07:55,569
Great.

256
00:07:55,949 --> 00:07:58,490
And that's exactly how you use

257
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:01,889
v0.app to complete your own ROI

258
00:08:01,889 --> 00:08:04,040
calculator notes.

259
00:08:06,699 --> 00:08:08,220
Now, I want you to take a look at

260
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:10,100
the VSL, the book a call fund.

261
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,899
Do you see this right here?

262
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:16,160
I just pasted the text right here.

263
00:08:16,449 --> 00:08:18,329
Build a comprehensive, this thing.

264
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:20,899
And it's got 76 lines.

265
00:08:21,189 --> 00:08:22,579
Again, boom.

266
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:26,000
And now what it did, it built it.

267
00:08:26,949 --> 00:08:28,750
And it says, step one, add

268
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:31,040
performance and tracking.

269
00:08:31,329 --> 00:08:33,509
Now, let's just drop the CPM to

270
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:34,740
110.

271
00:08:35,029 --> 00:08:38,899
And let's increase the CTR to 1.6.

272
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:41,500
And now let's up the page visits

273
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,798
to like 1,900.

274
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:46,269
And the total applications to like

275
00:08:46,269 --> 00:08:47,320
550.

276
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:48,919
You know, you mess around with the

277
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:49,600
numbers.

278
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:50,740
All these things are going to

279
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:51,200
change.

280
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,990
But let's say the calls dropped to

281
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:53,759
120.

282
00:08:53,779 --> 00:08:55,490
So now it talks about what are

283
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:57,179
your total repressions?

284
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,240
What are the unique clicks?

285
00:08:58,429 --> 00:08:59,379
What's the cost per click?

286
00:08:59,669 --> 00:09:01,549
What is your application rate?

287
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:04,190
In percentage, what is your cost

288
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:05,779
per application?

289
00:09:06,009 --> 00:09:07,220
What is your book call rate?

290
00:09:07,389 --> 00:09:08,429
And what is your cost per book

291
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:08,980
call?

292
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:11,320
And now you have 100 live calls,

293
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:16,700
25 closed deals, and ASP of 5,000.

294
00:09:17,509 --> 00:09:19,539
Say your show rate is now this.

295
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:21,980
Your cost per live call is now

296
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:22,720
this.

297
00:09:23,009 --> 00:09:24,889
Your close rate is now this.

298
00:09:25,269 --> 00:09:27,259
With this, you've generated total

299
00:09:27,259 --> 00:09:29,840
revenue of $125,000.

300
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,570
And your return on ad spend, which

301
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:34,700
it's showing here, is total

302
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:37,360
revenue by ad spend, which is 125K

303
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:38,580
divided by 20K.

304
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,570
And this is the profit that you

305
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:41,159
make.

306
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:43,259
This is how you visualize the

307
00:09:43,259 --> 00:09:44,019
funnel.

308
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:46,269
So many impressions, so many

309
00:09:46,269 --> 00:09:47,940
clicks, so many applications,

310
00:09:48,019 --> 00:09:49,899
calls booked, live calls, phone

311
00:09:49,899 --> 00:09:50,120
CS.

312
00:09:50,379 --> 00:09:52,000
And these are the key metric

313
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,940
summary that it's added to the

314
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:54,840
bottom.

315
00:09:55,129 --> 00:09:56,519
Total ad spend, total revenue,

316
00:09:56,519 --> 00:09:57,710
ROAS, profit margin.

317
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,240
Well, now we have it.

318
00:09:59,259 --> 00:10:00,590
And the last thing I'm going to

319
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:01,840
show you is the LinkedIn ROI

320
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,639
calculator.

321
00:10:02,929 --> 00:10:06,029
All right, for the LinkedIn lead

322
00:10:06,029 --> 00:10:09,610
generation calculator, all I said

323
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:12,039
was, I have now pasted some text.

324
00:10:12,059 --> 00:10:13,259
And based on this text, you're

325
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:14,740
going to follow the instructions

326
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:15,909
and build an ROI calculator for

327
00:10:16,179 --> 00:10:17,200
LinkedIn regeneration.

328
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:18,360
Thank you.

329
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:22,019
And it went ahead and built this

330
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:23,179
entire thing for me.

331
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:24,529
And now you can see step one,

332
00:10:24,529 --> 00:10:25,559
which is the input.

333
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:27,100
And step two, which is the sales

334
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,179
and conversions.

335
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,789
So, based on the M2Ls contacted

336
00:10:30,789 --> 00:10:32,789
and the agency fee, with the

337
00:10:32,789 --> 00:10:34,710
connection acceptance rate, reply

338
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:36,179
rate, all of that, it's

339
00:10:36,179 --> 00:10:37,980
calculating this.

340
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:41,019
480 connections accepted, 192

341
00:10:41,019 --> 00:10:42,100
people replied.

342
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:44,440
Out of that, 77 were positive

343
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,220
advice.

344
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:50,940
And based on a call booking rate

345
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:53,909
of 40% and a close rate of 20%,

346
00:10:53,909 --> 00:10:56,779
you now have 31 calls booked, six

347
00:10:56,799 --> 00:10:59,850
clients closed, 30K in new monthly

348
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:01,639
revenue generated.

349
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,399
And now your customer acquisition

350
00:11:03,409 --> 00:11:04,500
cost is this much.

351
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,789
Now you have an ROI summary right

352
00:11:06,789 --> 00:11:07,360
here.

353
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:09,169
It says your investment, your

354
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:11,230
revenue, your net profit, and your

355
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:12,340
ROI percentage.

356
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,240
It's literally that simple.

357
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:17,879
Best of luck.

358
00:11:17,899 --> 00:11:18,139
Okay.
