1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:02,600
All right section three prompt

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:06,000
engineering 101 with claude all

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:08,380
right so now that we have the

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,230
logic down the next step is to

5
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:12,560
actually build the roi calculators

6
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,279
but before jumping straight

7
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,250
onto the tool you need to

8
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:17,940
understand how to give high

9
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:20,390
quality inputs your outputs

10
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:21,579
directly correlate

11
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,190
on how good your inputs are if

12
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:24,879
your inputs are shit then your

13
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:26,339
outputs will be dog shit

14
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:28,940
i'll say it again if your inputs

15
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:31,460
are shit your outputs will be dog

16
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,659
shit say that four times

17
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:35,560
this is going to build your

18
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:38,270
foundational understanding of what

19
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:39,929
inputs to give the system

20
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,149
and why are we using claude a

21
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:44,899
because claude is superior to chat

22
00:00:44,899 --> 00:00:47,289
gpt yes i said it and claude is

23
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,899
an ai assistant designed to answer

24
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:52,420
questions generating text write

25
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:54,240
code analyze documents

26
00:00:54,259 --> 00:00:56,329
and help with business tasks it's

27
00:00:56,329 --> 00:00:58,259
a large language model built by

28
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:00,710
anthropic this is the link for it

29
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:03,320
why are we using claude the tool

30
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:05,840
we're going to use to build the

31
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:09,879
roi calculator is inside a large

32
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,459
language model itself so what's

33
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:15,719
the best way to give a prompt to

34
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:19,209
an ai make another ai right right

35
00:01:19,299 --> 00:01:21,859
and to build a killer prompt for a

36
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:24,709
large language model you need five

37
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:26,590
components to it and we're

38
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:27,980
going to use claude to generate

39
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:29,590
those five components properly for

40
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:30,980
us and i'm going to show you all

41
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:31,099
of

42
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,099
them absolutely i call it the

43
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:36,200
escape method okay refer to this

44
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,439
claude artifact for more details

45
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:40,430
so the

46
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,900
escape method is s-c-a-p-e you

47
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:46,280
provide situation and context as

48
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:49,379
your first few lines and the

49
00:01:49,379 --> 00:01:49,920
second few

50
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:51,739
lines you're going to give it the

51
00:01:52,269 --> 00:01:53,659
components and the structure and

52
00:01:53,659 --> 00:01:55,700
then the third one is going to be

53
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:55,849
through

54
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:59,620
actionable requirements and then p

55
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,920
is going to be the prevention and

56
00:02:01,969 --> 00:02:04,959
edge cases edge cases literally

57
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:07,780
mean it's a it's a very

58
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:11,060
very extreme scenario something

59
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,909
that may happen and you want to

60
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,099
make sure that your calculator

61
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,699
is built to handle that and then

62
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:20,599
experience and polish i'm now

63
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:23,259
going to explain using the

64
00:02:23,259 --> 00:02:23,780
artifact

65
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,659
link above on how to build a

66
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:28,659
really good prompt all right this

67
00:02:28,659 --> 00:02:31,759
is the ultimate guide to ki prompt

68
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,259
engineering for the code

69
00:02:33,969 --> 00:02:35,169
generation this is going to build

70
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:37,039
you exactly what you want and i'm

71
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:37,419
going to show

72
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:39,099
you the escape method because the

73
00:02:39,099 --> 00:02:40,659
rest of the stuff you can read it

74
00:02:40,659 --> 00:02:43,180
on your own time all right so

75
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:43,819
first

76
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,150
thing you have to understand is ai

77
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:48,000
is literal it is sequential and is

78
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:49,659
pattern matching you have to

79
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,409
understand these three components

80
00:02:51,419 --> 00:02:53,039
core principles and then instead

81
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:55,020
of just saying build a calculator

82
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:55,449
for my

83
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:57,210
business we are going to explain

84
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:58,680
the why using the five-step

85
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,319
framework called s-ne-a-p escape

86
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:02,780
situation

87
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,379
and context is first set the scene

88
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:07,909
explain the context so this is the

89
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:11,219
context that we are giving for the

90
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:14,090
vsl the book call phone next thing

91
00:03:14,139 --> 00:03:17,120
is components structure what is it

92
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,719
break down the complex request

93
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,909
into logical components why you

94
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:23,689
prevent the ai from making

95
00:03:23,689 --> 00:03:25,629
assumptions on how things should

96
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:26,900
be organized

97
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:28,830
this is very important for the

98
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:30,849
cold email the one where we have

99
00:03:30,849 --> 00:03:33,250
500 tech fee free and a cost per

100
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:33,689
call

101
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:35,169
you're saying create a clean

102
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:37,030
professional two-step calculator

103
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:38,780
with a modern card-based layout

104
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:39,379
include

105
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,930
a prominent header titled this

106
00:03:40,949 --> 00:03:42,620
with the subtitle that design the

107
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,419
interface to work seamlessly on

108
00:03:44,419 --> 00:03:44,509
both

109
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,180
desktop and mobile devices so that

110
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:49,159
it can be seen phone it can be

111
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:52,330
seen anywhere actual requirements

112
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,590
you give specific and measurable

113
00:03:54,669 --> 00:03:56,759
requirements that leave no room

114
00:03:56,759 --> 00:03:58,810
for interpretation because the ai

115
00:03:58,819 --> 00:03:59,199
loves to

116
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,289
interpret if it has missing gaps

117
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:03,270
so what we're going to do here is

118
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:05,159
we're going to say hey use react

119
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:05,689
hooks

120
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:08,099
including blah blah blah and this

121
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:10,340
is something we asked claude to

122
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:13,460
generate for us and now let's look

123
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:15,000
at the prevention and edge cases

124
00:04:15,009 --> 00:04:16,329
like i said before this is the

125
00:04:16,379 --> 00:04:19,009
extreme scenario remember in the

126
00:04:19,069 --> 00:04:19,949
cold email

127
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,439
ry calculator that has a 500 tech

128
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:24,639
fee and a 300 cost per call in

129
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,490
that specific example i told you

130
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,139
to create

131
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,910
drop downs the drop down

132
00:04:29,939 --> 00:04:31,930
specifically states that and i

133
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:33,610
also said for the reply percentage

134
00:04:34,269 --> 00:04:35,680
use 0.05

135
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,100
0.5 to five percent because no one

136
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:41,170
ideally speaking would have more

137
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,819
than a five percent reply rate

138
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:45,589
five percent is massive by the way

139
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:45,860
and

140
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:50,610
that is exactly why you know you

141
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:52,209
can't have percentages over a

142
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:54,500
hundred or unrealistic values make

143
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:54,980
sure that

144
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,730
none of the inputs you know you

145
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,810
prevent putting a negative number

146
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:00,879
in there you can't contact

147
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:04,660
negative 36 000 people in a month

148
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:06,149
right that just just simply

149
00:05:06,149 --> 00:05:08,899
doesn't make sense and now this is

150
00:05:08,899 --> 00:05:09,050
the

151
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:10,769
experience in polish now you're

152
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:12,360
going to provide details that

153
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,180
transform the function of code

154
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:14,740
into a

155
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:16,170
professional application so

156
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:18,500
something like add a smooth hover

157
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,740
and focus states on all

158
00:05:20,889 --> 00:05:21,860
interactive elements

159
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:23,310
and through the summary dashboard

160
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:24,730
at the bottom showing key metrics

161
00:05:24,769 --> 00:05:26,980
total investment total revenue

162
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,230
generated net profit all that

163
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:28,500
stuff

164
00:05:30,819 --> 00:05:32,920
so the few techniques that we use

165
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,350
here the first one was like an

166
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:36,019
assumption elimination method

167
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,769
instead of saying make it look

168
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:40,139
professional we say apply a modern

169
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:41,930
aesthetic using blah blah blah

170
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:45,480
and the second technique is we're

171
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,839
clearly giving the formulas if you

172
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:48,959
take a look at the google sheet

173
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,939
on the right side i put the

174
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:52,560
formula for everything the

175
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:56,259
transparency of the formula leaves

176
00:05:56,279 --> 00:05:57,060
zero room for

177
00:05:57,079 --> 00:05:58,740
the ai to interpret anything else

178
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:01,100
and the third thing is the

179
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:04,100
realistic default strategy so

180
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:05,600
empty calculators

181
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:07,470
simply don't demonstrate any value

182
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:08,569
so so you need to have

183
00:06:08,579 --> 00:06:11,620
pre-populate all the fields with

184
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,410
realistic

185
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:14,350
default values that demonstrate a

186
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,040
successful ad campaign successful

187
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,060
linkedin outbound campaign

188
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:19,939
successful

189
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:21,990
cold email campaign allowing users

190
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,769
to immediately understand the

191
00:06:23,769 --> 00:06:25,379
calculator's functionality

192
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:29,620
and then the next one is just edge

193
00:06:29,939 --> 00:06:31,069
case prevention you have to

194
00:06:31,339 --> 00:06:33,120
understand the technical uh edge

195
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:34,819
cases ux

196
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:36,720
edge cases business logic edge

197
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:38,379
cases this is the only thing i

198
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:40,500
would ask you to focus on what

199
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,540
conversion rates are

200
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,439
actually realistic you know

201
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,410
someone can't have a cpm of two

202
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:47,779
dollars or someone can't have a

203
00:06:47,779 --> 00:06:49,319
reply rate of 99

204
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:52,399
percent right it's not realistic

205
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:54,819
and the next thing the fifth

206
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:57,699
technique is the incremental

207
00:06:57,699 --> 00:06:59,089
specificity pattern

208
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,490
overall application you you know

209
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:03,660
you have to start broad and then

210
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,040
start getting increasingly

211
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:05,860
specific

212
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:07,600
exactly like how a funnel works so

213
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,750
now let's look at the technique we

214
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:13,220
used for each calculator

215
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,459
so for the ad performance we're

216
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:17,829
saying this is the input and then

217
00:07:17,829 --> 00:07:20,339
we're saying all right this step

218
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:20,660
should

219
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,000
immediately calculate and display

220
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,170
the total impressions i've given

221
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:27,300
the actual input elements and the

222
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:27,930
actual

223
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:30,509
outputs that i need for that step

224
00:07:30,509 --> 00:07:32,810
now let's look at for the cold

225
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:35,540
email i'm not saying all right

226
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:36,009
create a

227
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,180
drop down menu select the tech fee

228
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:40,730
package like i said 500 per month

229
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:42,810
is for 50 000 emails

230
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,410
a thousand per month is for 100

231
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:48,339
000 emails to for 200 000 emails

232
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,430
per month you pay 2 000 a month

233
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:54,689
you see what i mean now let's move

234
00:07:54,689 --> 00:07:58,220
to the linkedin calculator over

235
00:07:58,589 --> 00:08:01,860
here i say for the reply rate

236
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:04,069
between 20 to 60 percent and

237
00:08:04,189 --> 00:08:06,540
defaulted at 40 percent and the

238
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:09,930
positive reply rate same 20 to 60

239
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:10,019
percent

240
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,639
defaulted at 40 percent

241
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:13,759
representing genuinely interested

242
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,920
responses versus polite rejections

243
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,420
etc

244
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:19,819
and once all of this is done you

245
00:08:20,139 --> 00:08:22,639
now have a really good prompt and

246
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:23,860
in the next video i'm actually

247
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:23,939
going

248
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:26,129
to show you the exact prompt as a

249
00:08:26,269 --> 00:08:28,579
pasted text that i got from claude

250
00:08:28,579 --> 00:08:30,339
that i inputted to versell

251
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,408
i'll see you guys in the next

252
00:08:32,668 --> 00:08:33,620
video thank you
