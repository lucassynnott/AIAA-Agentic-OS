1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,020
Okay, so this is a simplified way

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:04,620
of doing an ROI calculator,

3
00:00:04,629 --> 00:00:06,209
just using Claude without any kind

4
00:00:06,209 --> 00:00:07,669
of like super complex stuff.

5
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:08,880
This is like a quick and dirty,

6
00:00:09,099 --> 00:00:10,109
like make one real quick

7
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:11,289
and all the prompts and everything

8
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:11,720
in here.

9
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:12,500
I'm just going to throw in the

10
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:13,519
description so you can read it.

11
00:00:13,529 --> 00:00:15,759
But basically just said, I want to

12
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:16,960
make an interactive ROI calculator

13
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:17,579
for my prospects

14
00:00:17,589 --> 00:00:19,379
and be sharing the calculator on

15
00:00:19,379 --> 00:00:20,890
my video sales letter and sales

16
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:21,079
calls

17
00:00:21,089 --> 00:00:22,109
purpose of it to show what results

18
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:23,179
in terms of money are possible to

19
00:00:23,179 --> 00:00:24,339
achieve working with me.

20
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:25,839
This is my service.

21
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:26,989
I do a VSL call funnel for these

22
00:00:26,989 --> 00:00:27,390
people.

23
00:00:27,489 --> 00:00:28,140
Here's the things I want to

24
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:28,500
consider.

25
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:30,890
Normal coaching pricing is

26
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:32,630
between, you can read it in the

27
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:33,729
description.

28
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:36,079
But then it came back and said, it

29
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:37,549
needed some clarifying questions

30
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:38,450
because I said, if there's

31
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:39,659
anything else you're unsure about

32
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:40,659
before you make the ROI calculator

33
00:00:40,659 --> 00:00:41,590
in order to make it correctly,

34
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:42,340
please ask me how.

35
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:43,229
So it asked me a bunch of

36
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,590
questions, yada, yada.

37
00:00:44,609 --> 00:00:46,359
And then what I did is I just

38
00:00:46,359 --> 00:00:48,219
answered the questions.

39
00:00:48,229 --> 00:00:49,630
So just one by one, I answered the

40
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:50,140
questions.

41
00:00:50,149 --> 00:00:51,820
And then it created an ROI

42
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:52,899
calculator.

43
00:00:52,909 --> 00:00:53,579
Okay, cool.

44
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:55,490
So now I started going through

45
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:57,570
this and like this was defaulted

46
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:59,100
to 10,000.

47
00:01:00,009 --> 00:01:02,820
And this was defaulted to 5,000.

48
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:04,750
And what I'm going through here is

49
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:06,799
you've seen a month one, it's net

50
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:08,420
profit negative $500.

51
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:09,560
So I'm like, okay, well, if you

52
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,500
fucking presented that to a

53
00:01:10,519 --> 00:01:11,519
client, like that's not going to

54
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:11,760
fly.

55
00:01:11,769 --> 00:01:12,180
You know what I mean?

56
00:01:12,189 --> 00:01:14,109
And then you go to month three and

57
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:16,239
they fucking have lost money.

58
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:16,980
You get what I'm saying?

59
00:01:16,989 --> 00:01:18,409
So I'm like, okay, well, like, I'm

60
00:01:18,409 --> 00:01:19,769
like, well, fucking that can't be

61
00:01:19,769 --> 00:01:20,359
the case.

62
00:01:20,469 --> 00:01:22,170
So what I'm doing as well is I'll

63
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:23,969
walk you through some of my logic

64
00:01:23,969 --> 00:01:25,510
in the next prompt I'm going to

65
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:26,340
give it.

66
00:01:26,349 --> 00:01:28,650
So under campaign settings, I want

67
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:30,510
you to remove the cost per lead

68
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,540
and lead to call booking rate.

69
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:33,620
And instead, just show cost per

70
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:34,079
book call.

71
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:34,579
Why?

72
00:01:34,609 --> 00:01:35,730
Because even when I'm personally

73
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:37,219
doing media buying, I don't give a

74
00:01:37,219 --> 00:01:38,579
fuck what the cost per lead is.

75
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:39,739
I'm only concerned.

76
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:41,400
What is the cost per call?

77
00:01:41,409 --> 00:01:41,680
Right?

78
00:01:41,689 --> 00:01:42,799
So it doesn't even matter what the

79
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:43,420
cost per lead.

80
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:44,180
It doesn't matter.

81
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:45,280
Like, what's the cost per call?

82
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:45,879
Right?

83
00:01:46,329 --> 00:01:47,409
Then under call show up rates,

84
00:01:47,409 --> 00:01:48,569
make a non-adjustable field that

85
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:49,659
just says call is booked.

86
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:50,060
Right?

87
00:01:50,069 --> 00:01:51,129
So I just want to see how many

88
00:01:51,129 --> 00:01:52,439
calls were booked right here.

89
00:01:52,489 --> 00:01:52,760
Right?

90
00:01:52,769 --> 00:01:54,189
Under sales and pricing, put a

91
00:01:54,189 --> 00:01:55,640
field under package price that

92
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,799
says clients closed.

93
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:57,829
And another one says revenue

94
00:01:57,829 --> 00:01:58,379
generated.

95
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:00,269
And they're calculated based on

96
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,109
the provided input fields.

97
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:02,700
Right?

98
00:02:02,709 --> 00:02:04,950
And then again, going back to

99
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:07,469
this, like these numbers are not

100
00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:08,580
big enough.

101
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:10,830
So now what else I'm going to do

102
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,449
in addition to this, make the

103
00:02:13,449 --> 00:02:15,379
monthly ad spend

104
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:20,979
default to $30,000 and also make

105
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:25,310
the package price default to

106
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,830
$10,000.

107
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:29,830
Okay.

108
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:30,990
So, and all you do to make these

109
00:02:31,219 --> 00:02:32,659
adjustments to the calculator is

110
00:02:32,659 --> 00:02:33,860
you just explain in natural

111
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:34,860
English what you want to change.

112
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:36,020
So I'm going to do that.

113
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:37,090
And now it's just going to redo

114
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:37,819
the whole thing.

115
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:53,819
And like a lot of what you'll do

116
00:02:53,819 --> 00:03:02,699
playing with AI tools is like,

117
00:03:02,699 --> 00:03:04,379
it's like kind of just

118
00:03:04,389 --> 00:03:05,539
like sitting here, like going back

119
00:03:05,699 --> 00:03:06,310
and forth with it.

120
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:07,469
Like, ah, I want, I want to change

121
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:07,830
this.

122
00:03:07,849 --> 00:03:08,659
Ah, I want to change this.

123
00:03:08,669 --> 00:03:09,479
Ah, I want to change this.

124
00:03:09,569 --> 00:03:11,780
Like what you kind of are is like,

125
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:13,710
you're kind of like a fucking

126
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:15,340
developer, but you just

127
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:16,180
use natural language.

128
00:03:16,189 --> 00:03:17,240
Like you don't know code.

129
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:19,080
You're just a developer, but you

130
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,969
use like the English language.

131
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:21,539
You get what I'm saying?

132
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:21,620
Okay.

133
00:03:21,629 --> 00:03:21,699
Okay.

134
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:51,409
Thank you.

135
00:03:52,379 --> 00:04:09,879
Also, when you do this, you always

136
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:10,740
want to make sure you're using the

137
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,319
highest model.

138
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:12,759
So, like, right now, it's Opus

139
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:13,479
4.1.

140
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:19,509
Okay, cool.

141
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:21,069
Yeah, so this looks fucking much

142
00:04:21,069 --> 00:04:21,620
better.

143
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:22,360
All right, so what?

144
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:23,509
Here's how you do this.

145
00:04:23,709 --> 00:04:25,100
Here's how you publish this.

146
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:26,060
All you do, you go to Publish.

147
00:04:26,089 --> 00:04:27,680
Publish and Copy Link.

148
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,370
Copy Link.

149
00:04:30,389 --> 00:04:32,310
Go into a browser.

150
00:04:32,389 --> 00:04:34,839
Here's your ROI calculator.

151
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:36,769
It's just on a published link,

152
00:04:36,889 --> 00:04:37,500
right?

153
00:04:37,509 --> 00:04:38,519
So you can just play with this

154
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:38,660
now.

155
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:39,519
So, like, you're talking to a

156
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:39,839
client.

157
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:41,339
It's like, okay, so what would the

158
00:04:41,379 --> 00:04:42,560
three-month results be?

159
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:44,350
If you were spending $30,000 per

160
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:45,769
month, you had a $300 cost per

161
00:04:45,769 --> 00:04:47,970
call, you'd net profit, after my

162
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:50,800
fees, $222,000.

163
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:54,199
So, and then you can adjust it.

164
00:04:54,209 --> 00:04:55,279
Well, I assume, like, over time,

165
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:56,110
like, it's starting to work

166
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:56,540
better.

167
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:57,540
Like, you want to increase the ad

168
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,149
spend from $1,000 a day to $2,000

169
00:04:59,149 --> 00:04:59,519
a day.

170
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:01,829
So then we go to $60,000, and

171
00:05:01,829 --> 00:05:03,980
you'd be profiting $456,000.

172
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:05,870
You know what I'm saying?

173
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:07,040
And, like, your service fee on

174
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:08,259
that would have been, you would

175
00:05:08,339 --> 00:05:10,050
have clicked $84,000 on that over

176
00:05:10,129 --> 00:05:10,930
fucking three months.

177
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:11,519
You know what I'm saying?

178
00:05:11,529 --> 00:05:13,089
You know, you can sit here and

179
00:05:13,089 --> 00:05:14,319
adjust it with them.

180
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:16,560
Like, well, what if the cost per

181
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,779
call is higher?

182
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:19,220
Like, okay, well, then that.

183
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:20,220
You see what I mean?

184
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:22,350
Well, I actually charge $8,000.

185
00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:23,519
Okay, that.

186
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:26,250
Well, what if you close less?

187
00:05:26,269 --> 00:05:27,379
And you can, like, give, like,

188
00:05:27,379 --> 00:05:28,639
conservative estimates and shit.

189
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:30,470
And it's like, yeah, even if you

190
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:32,579
had a $350 cost per call, and you

191
00:05:32,579 --> 00:05:33,839
were only closing 18%, and you

192
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:35,220
were only charging $8,000, you're

193
00:05:35,339 --> 00:05:36,899
still profiting $196,000.

194
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:38,189
But in reality, it's like, as we

195
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:39,589
optimize the sales process, it'll

196
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,069
just go to $23,000.

197
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:42,660
That could stay at $8,000.

198
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:44,759
Like, we constantly make new ads.

199
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:46,339
So this would be, like, $280,000.

200
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:47,220
You know what I'm saying?

201
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:49,100
You know, we have some cool stuff

202
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,709
that we do to increase show up

203
00:05:50,709 --> 00:05:51,379
rates.

204
00:05:51,389 --> 00:05:52,540
So this would go to $70,000.

205
00:05:52,649 --> 00:05:53,800
So it's $540,000.

206
00:05:54,009 --> 00:05:54,680
You know what I'm saying?

207
00:05:54,689 --> 00:05:57,680
Like, oh, 12 months, $2.1 million.

208
00:05:57,689 --> 00:05:58,720
You get what I'm saying?

209
00:05:58,730 --> 00:05:59,860
Like, you just kind of fuck with

210
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:00,500
it like that.

211
00:06:00,509 --> 00:06:01,970
And if you just want to make

212
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:03,850
changes to this calculator, you

213
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:05,720
just explain to Claude in natural

214
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,579
language.

215
00:06:06,589 --> 00:06:08,509
Like, what do I want to change?

216
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:09,040
You get what I'm saying?

217
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:09,720
So I'm going to put all the

218
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,819
prompts in the description below.

219
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:13,009
I'll put a link to this artifact

220
00:06:13,009 --> 00:06:13,839
as well.

221
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:14,740
But you can just, like, replicate

222
00:06:14,829 --> 00:06:15,620
the whole thing just like that.

223
00:06:15,629 --> 00:06:16,180
It's super easy.
