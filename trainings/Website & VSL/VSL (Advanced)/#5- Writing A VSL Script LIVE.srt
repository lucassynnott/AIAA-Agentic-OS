1
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:02,910
Alrighty ladies and gents.

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:04,839
So as you can see right here, what

3
00:00:04,919 --> 00:00:06,080
we got is another doc.

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:06,110
This

5
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,009
is your framework.

6
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:07,339
Okay.

7
00:00:07,339 --> 00:00:08,419
And this is going to have the

8
00:00:08,419 --> 00:00:09,759
framework that I talked about in

9
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:10,560
the module.

10
00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:11,980
And then as well, I'm going to

11
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:13,619
have the script right here.

12
00:00:14,109 --> 00:00:15,039
Now yours is going to go right

13
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:15,279
beneath

14
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:15,750
that.

15
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,620
So let's actually just make that a

16
00:00:17,629 --> 00:00:19,100
separate page, right?

17
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,239
Isn't the most annoying thing

18
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:20,399
about

19
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:21,589
Google docs is this stupidity

20
00:00:21,589 --> 00:00:22,160
right here.

21
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:22,769
Look at that.

22
00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:23,850
Oh, I want to go up one.

23
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:24,129
No,

24
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:26,140
you got to go right there.

25
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:28,199
So now we can actually go in,

26
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:28,890
right?

27
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:30,719
So here's the best way to do this,

28
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:31,129
guys.

29
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:32,609
You want to get this done super

30
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:33,049
fast.

31
00:00:33,049 --> 00:00:33,479
Okay.

32
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,659
We're going to do file download as

33
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:37,600
a PDF.

34
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:38,090
Okay.

35
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:39,770
I now have the creative brief

36
00:00:39,799 --> 00:00:40,590
finished.

37
00:00:40,609 --> 00:00:43,030
So that's downloaded right there.

38
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:43,280
Okay.

39
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:43,679
Notice how

40
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:44,689
there's a client ascension one as

41
00:00:44,689 --> 00:00:44,939
well.

42
00:00:44,939 --> 00:00:45,939
Oh, I don't think you guys can see

43
00:00:45,939 --> 00:00:46,219
that.

44
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:47,520
Interesting.

45
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:47,679
Yeah,

46
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:48,530
no, you can't see that, but

47
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,630
there's a download right there.

48
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:49,960
Okay.

49
00:00:49,979 --> 00:00:51,920
So now what I'm going to do

50
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,469
is I'm going to go to chat.openai.

51
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:54,979
Okay.

52
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:57,200
And then as well, what I'm going

53
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:57,600
to do,

54
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,590
you guys can't see this, but this

55
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:04,000
is a tool called AI PDF.app.

56
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,799
Okay.

57
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:05,790
I already have an account.

58
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:05,840
I'm

59
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:06,890
going to have to log into it.

60
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:07,780
So let me give a second.

61
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:08,900
I'm going to pause real quick.

62
00:01:09,019 --> 00:01:09,280
Okay.

63
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:09,920
So here I am

64
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:11,000
now inside of the doc.

65
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,250
So what I'm going to do is I'm

66
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:15,430
going to file upload and I'm going

67
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:17,760
to upload mine.

68
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:19,810
And you guys can't see it because

69
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:21,799
it's just the window capture on

70
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:22,250
here.

71
00:01:22,459 --> 00:01:23,120
It's not the screen's

72
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:24,090
capture on there.

73
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:25,450
And you can see now I have this

74
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:26,450
and I can copy this.

75
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:26,959
Okay.

76
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:28,719
And I can save,

77
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:32,349
copy that, go back to chat.openai.

78
00:01:32,349 --> 00:01:35,129
And I can say, here is a creative

79
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:35,920
brief.

80
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:38,439
Oh, let's make sure that you guys

81
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:38,959
can see this.

82
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:45,310
Here's a creative brief for my

83
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:46,799
services.

84
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,239
All right.

85
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,109
I would like for you to produce a,

86
00:01:59,109 --> 00:02:00,599
and here is the big thing right

87
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,040
here.

88
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,549
We've got to say five

89
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:03,409
to 10 minute.

90
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:04,780
You're going to see why we don't

91
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:06,239
use chat GPT here in a second.

92
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:06,719
I'm just going to show

93
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,840
you guys the chat GPT, but you'll

94
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,240
see here.

95
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:08,930
We're in a second.

96
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:10,719
We don't that provide a five to 10

97
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:11,038
minute,

98
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:16,740
um, VSL script that pitches that

99
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:21,490
sells this service and follows

100
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:25,150
this framework.

101
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:26,039
Okay.

102
00:02:26,069 --> 00:02:26,879
And then from there,

103
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:29,159
I will go here, copy and paste

104
00:02:29,169 --> 00:02:29,840
this.

105
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,960
Boom.

106
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:38,379
So I'm going to, I need to like,

107
00:02:38,389 --> 00:02:39,840
make it very clear for it.

108
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,159
So state your offer and your

109
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:42,719
guarantee

110
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:45,310
the IED intro.

111
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:48,460
Why is the problem happening?

112
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:49,650
What is the solution?

113
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,080
How is this solution different?

114
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,719
Undeniable proof, direct offer

115
00:02:54,789 --> 00:02:55,680
plus ask.

116
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,400
Okay.

117
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,759
We're going to hand it to it.

118
00:02:57,759 --> 00:02:58,000
Okay.

119
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,909
And it's now

120
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,120
I'm going to produce it.

121
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,490
So it's searching the files.

122
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:02,020
All right.

123
00:03:02,069 --> 00:03:02,840
Give me a sec.

124
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:03,680
Let me go and do that.

125
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:04,879
Okay.

126
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,060
So I saw what the problem was.

127
00:03:06,069 --> 00:03:07,199
I didn't have plugins on.

128
00:03:07,289 --> 00:03:08,400
So what you want to do is you want

129
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:09,639
to go and you want to hit this

130
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:10,289
right here.

131
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,710
So if you don't have it, I would

132
00:03:11,949 --> 00:03:12,639
highly recommend paying

133
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,330
for the paid chat GPT version and

134
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:15,270
Claude as well.

135
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:16,520
We'll go into Claude.

136
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:18,319
It's like total guys, 40 bucks a

137
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,409
month, like, you know, make more

138
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:20,969
money.

139
00:03:21,069 --> 00:03:22,810
So you can go here to settings and

140
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:24,400
beta, beta features,

141
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:26,009
turn on plugins right here.

142
00:03:26,009 --> 00:03:27,360
So you turn it on and then that

143
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,719
plugin that you want to get from

144
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:29,360
the store,

145
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,120
you can go and go to plugin store,

146
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,419
but AI PDF is the name of the

147
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:33,039
plugin.

148
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:33,599
Okay.

149
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:34,400
And so now I can

150
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:37,460
go back to this previous example.

151
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:41,300
The reason why it wasn't able to

152
00:03:41,539 --> 00:03:43,439
pull it is because it was trying

153
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:44,969
to search my files.

154
00:03:44,969 --> 00:03:47,439
Um, but we want to do it this way.

155
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:49,729
So we go to new chat plugins, no

156
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:50,719
plugins enabled.

157
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:52,550
Let's turn on the plugins.

158
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:54,139
Sometimes it's weird.

159
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:55,439
It doesn't load.

160
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:55,759
Okay.

161
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:56,800
So you can see that the plugins

162
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,620
right there.

163
00:03:57,759 --> 00:03:59,169
So now what I can do is paste

164
00:03:59,259 --> 00:03:59,719
that.

165
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:00,219
Okay.

166
00:04:00,349 --> 00:04:02,229
And now it's going to access that

167
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,080
using this AI PDF plugin.

168
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:04,639
Okay.

169
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:05,580
Now just give it a second.

170
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:06,919
I'll go ahead and pause this real

171
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:08,509
quick before it starts generating.

172
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:10,099
So you can see, this is why we

173
00:04:10,099 --> 00:04:11,620
don't use chat GPT that for some

174
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:13,599
reason it really sucks with this

175
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:14,430
type of stuff.

176
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,759
I don't know why uploading

177
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:16,500
documents.

178
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,000
Like I just have not had a ton of

179
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,720
success.

180
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:19,480
I wanted to show you guys that

181
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,360
because some of you guys are going

182
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,360
to be like, well, why can't I just

183
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:22,560
use chat GPT?

184
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,350
So that's why, so here's what I

185
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:25,620
would recommend.

186
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,199
This is a much better tool.

187
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,540
It's called Claude.

188
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:29,040
Okay.

189
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,600
It makes it so easy for me to

190
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:31,439
upload a doc.

191
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:40,740
Take that and then I can do this

192
00:04:41,069 --> 00:04:45,589
right here.

193
00:04:45,589 --> 00:04:46,399
Yep.

194
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,000
Okay.

195
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,839
That follows the following

196
00:04:50,899 --> 00:04:51,910
framework.

197
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,079
Okay.

198
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:52,899
And then I just need to format it

199
00:04:52,899 --> 00:04:53,300
a little bit.

200
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:53,759
Give me one.

201
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,759
So I have it formatted, but here's

202
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:55,949
another

203
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:59,060
thing guys is that you can ask

204
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02,649
yourself how many words can be

205
00:05:02,649 --> 00:05:06,160
spoken in one minute.

206
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:07,850
Okay.

207
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:09,120
140 words per minute.

208
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,620
So if I want to do 140, let's say

209
00:05:10,689 --> 00:05:11,750
I wanted this thing to be

210
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,670
five minutes long is going to be,

211
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:16,639
I don't know why I didn't just do

212
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:18,319
the math right there.

213
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,519
Okay, cool.

214
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:20,360
Thanks.

215
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,769
Appreciate it.

216
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:22,399
Google

217
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,389
700.

218
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:27,550
So I want this to be 700 words on

219
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:28,810
a 700 word long

220
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:32,629
and don't say script on this stuff

221
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:33,920
either.

222
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,040
Like I just, I'm doing that just

223
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:35,759
so you guys can see it,

224
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,819
but 700 word long piece of copy

225
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:41,040
that sells the service

226
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:46,980
I have included in the attached

227
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,029
creative brief

228
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:53,519
and follows this framework.

229
00:05:53,689 --> 00:05:53,759
Okay.

230
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:54,560
So here's that.

231
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,120
Okay.

232
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:55,279
Go

233
00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:01,839
Bing, bing, bing, bing, bing.

234
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:14,000
Pretty fucking good, right?

235
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,680
So let me ask you a couple of

236
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,060
questions.

237
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:16,480
Are you an info

238
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:17,459
product business owner struggling

239
00:06:17,459 --> 00:06:18,550
to get your email marketing, truly

240
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:19,470
connect with your audience and

241
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,230
really perform?

242
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:21,069
Do you feel like you're

243
00:06:21,069 --> 00:06:22,399
overlooking a goldmine hidden in

244
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:23,750
your email list and have you

245
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,350
tried working with copywriters and

246
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:26,819
foot before, but feel they failed

247
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:27,600
to capture.

248
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,259
So there's a lot of like

249
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:29,399
little verbiage things that we're

250
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:30,050
going to tweak here.

251
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:31,120
That's causing me to like stumble

252
00:06:31,149 --> 00:06:31,660
over my words

253
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,060
here.

254
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:33,259
Um, the reason most email

255
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:34,829
marketing falls flat is because it

256
00:06:34,829 --> 00:06:36,069
lacks personalization.

257
00:06:36,069 --> 00:06:36,170
Sending

258
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:37,629
blanket one size fits all messages

259
00:06:37,629 --> 00:06:39,040
simply doesn't cut it anymore.

260
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,120
Your subscribers are barred with

261
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:41,300
hundreds of emails today.

262
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,329
We'll get to that again.

263
00:06:42,329 --> 00:06:43,220
Most services fail.

264
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,290
They rely on templates.

265
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:44,480
Outsource

266
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:45,949
writers and a focus on sales at

267
00:06:45,949 --> 00:06:46,529
the result.

268
00:06:46,529 --> 00:06:47,879
Emails, in fact, non-wonder,

269
00:06:48,029 --> 00:06:48,819
engage in implements.

270
00:06:48,819 --> 00:06:48,980
This is

271
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:49,860
where our inbox when missing

272
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,579
methods send the part.

273
00:06:50,579 --> 00:06:51,509
We don't just write emails.

274
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:52,920
Uh, we merge ourselves in

275
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,339
your world to understand.

276
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:53,589
Okay, cool.

277
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,519
We'd conduct in-depth interviews.

278
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:55,920
Yep.

279
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,879
How's the solution different?

280
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,160
Unlike other traditional services

281
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,490
are personalized is personalized,

282
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:00,319
not standardized.

283
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:00,720
We don't use

284
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:01,209
templates.

285
00:07:01,209 --> 00:07:02,089
We craft versus emails.

286
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:02,329
Yep.

287
00:07:02,329 --> 00:07:02,569
Yep.

288
00:07:02,569 --> 00:07:02,800
Yep.

289
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,050
Yep.

290
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:03,360
Yep.

291
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:04,079
Um,

292
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:06,360
Okay.

293
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:09,790
Solid.

294
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:12,480
Boom.

295
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,379
I'm going to take this.

296
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:16,480
I'm going to come over to here.

297
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,730
And now

298
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:23,480
I've got a VSL script ready to

299
00:07:23,579 --> 00:07:24,029
rock and roll.

300
00:07:24,149 --> 00:07:25,199
I hate this so much.

301
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:26,319
This is like upsetting me to

302
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:26,990
a math.

303
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:28,250
What is the point of this?

304
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,550
Look, there's, there's no point

305
00:07:29,569 --> 00:07:30,009
for that.

306
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:30,790
There's no point.

307
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:31,430
There we go.

308
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,100
Fucking hell.

309
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:32,399
Wow.

310
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:33,860
I don't even think that.

311
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:35,120
I think it's still there too.

312
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:35,839
What can I just

313
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:37,230
minimize this down to like a

314
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:37,720
eight?

315
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,379
Here we go.

316
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:40,319
And then there we go.

317
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,670
Let's go.

318
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:44,160
So now we have it

319
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:46,579
where our VSL script is like 20,

320
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:49,189
30%, maybe 50% done.

321
00:07:49,189 --> 00:07:51,490
I mean, it depends on how nitpicky

322
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:52,240
you are,

323
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:53,709
but now I can just go in and tweak

324
00:07:53,709 --> 00:07:54,399
this stuff.

325
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:55,850
So let's go in and let's zoom in a

326
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:56,160
bit.

327
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:56,819
I apologize.

328
00:07:56,819 --> 00:07:58,079
Also if on the creepy creative

329
00:07:58,079 --> 00:07:59,529
brief guys, if you were, if it was

330
00:07:59,529 --> 00:08:00,319
hard to read it,

331
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,180
hopefully it wasn't, um, if you

332
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:03,779
have bad vision, you know,

333
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:05,470
whatever, sorry, your lack of

334
00:08:05,589 --> 00:08:06,160
amazing

335
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:08,649
genetics is not my fault or your

336
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:09,220
age.

337
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:09,910
Okay.

338
00:08:09,949 --> 00:08:12,339
So let's go in and let's zoom in

339
00:08:12,339 --> 00:08:12,990
here.

340
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:13,490
So,

341
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:21,689
so I would say I guarantee, I

342
00:08:21,689 --> 00:08:25,009
guarantee I can transform

343
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:27,910
your underperforming email list

344
00:08:28,069 --> 00:08:30,509
into a powerhouse for engagement

345
00:08:30,629 --> 00:08:31,920
conversions and revenue growth

346
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:33,480
with my personalized inbox

347
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,798
intimacy approach.

348
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,620
So all I'm doing now is I'm going

349
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:38,509
in and editing this and making it

350
00:08:38,509 --> 00:08:40,320
better with my personalized inbox

351
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,519
intimacy approach.

352
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,059
I'll craft emails.

353
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:45,600
I will personally

354
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:49,049
craft emails that sound like they

355
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:52,929
came directly from you, um, which

356
00:08:53,019 --> 00:08:53,169
will

357
00:08:58,039 --> 00:08:59,320
allow them to allow them to

358
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:04,320
resonate deeply.

359
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,279
So we'll come back to this.

360
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:08,340
I don't really, this is like too

361
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,399
wordy right here, but I guarantee,

362
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,399
I guarantee I can transform your

363
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:13,759
underperforming email list and a

364
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:14,879
powerhouse for engagement

365
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:15,519
conversions

366
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:16,809
and revenue growth.

367
00:09:16,809 --> 00:09:18,580
Um, with my personalized inbox

368
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:20,940
intimacy approach, I will craft, I

369
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:21,840
will personally,

370
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:23,580
I've personalized personally, I

371
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,389
will craft emails that sound like

372
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:27,279
they came from directly from you,

373
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,080
which will allow

374
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:31,990
resonate deeply with your

375
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:33,440
audience.

376
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,879
so I don't even think this really

377
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:43,159
matters right here, allowing

378
00:09:43,509 --> 00:09:44,159
deeply resonate with your

379
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:44,480
audience.

380
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:45,350
Like, um,

381
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:53,200
so here's the 80/20 of this video

382
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:57,679
video with my personalized inbox

383
00:09:57,909 --> 00:09:58,559
intimacy approach.

384
00:09:58,559 --> 00:09:59,610
I will craft emails that sound

385
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:00,529
like they directly came

386
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,509
from you based on

387
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:08,080
your content and in depth

388
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:11,200
interviews that I'll

389
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:14,799
ducked with you personally.

390
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:18,879
And if you don't see it as a

391
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:20,480
substantial increase in open

392
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,860
rates, click throughs and sales,

393
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:22,480
the 90 days,

394
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:23,870
you pay nothing period, end of

395
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:24,240
story.

396
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:27,840
So here's what I'm going to say.

397
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:34,080
Now here's a couple of questions.

398
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:38,720
I like to ask you,

399
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:43,759
you know, whether or not

400
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:51,679
right.

401
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:52,000
Okay.

402
00:10:52,759 --> 00:10:54,820
So let's just stop right there

403
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,230
before we go into the questions.

404
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,480
Let me go on camera.

405
00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:00,320
I guarantee I can transform your

406
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,840
underperforming email list into a

407
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:03,360
powerhouse for engagement,

408
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:04,809
conversions, and revenue growth

409
00:11:04,809 --> 00:11:06,320
inside your info product business.

410
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:11,679
All right.

411
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:17,360
Sound good.

412
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:19,860
Here's the 80/20 this video with

413
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:21,269
my personalized inbox intimacy

414
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:21,850
approach.

415
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,029
I will craft emails that sound

416
00:11:23,029 --> 00:11:24,559
like they came directly from you

417
00:11:24,629 --> 00:11:26,240
based on your content and in-depth

418
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:27,500
interviews that I'll conduct with

419
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,240
you personally.

420
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:29,480
And if you don't see a substantial

421
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,679
increase in open rates, click

422
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:31,440
throughs and sales,

423
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,120
then 90 days you pay nothing.

424
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:35,360
Now, here's a couple of questions

425
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,389
I'd like to ask you,

426
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,870
which will help you know whether

427
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:39,370
or not this service makes sense

428
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:39,850
for you.

429
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,399
Number one.

430
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:43,360
Number one.

431
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,669
Are you an info product business

432
00:11:49,669 --> 00:11:50,559
owner struggling?

433
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:56,299
Doing about doing at least

434
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:02,799
a hundred K a month consistently.

435
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:10,750
I don't think someone's going to

436
00:12:10,769 --> 00:12:11,830
say to me, oh, I'm really

437
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:12,720
struggling to get my email

438
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:14,399
marketing to connect to truly

439
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:15,279
connect with your audience.

440
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:20,159
And you feel.

441
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:23,519
And you're struggling.

442
00:12:23,559 --> 00:12:28,669
To find a solution for your email

443
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:29,250
marketing.

444
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,720
You know, honestly, I don't think

445
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,059
that we need to get into that on

446
00:12:36,149 --> 00:12:37,840
the identifier question.

447
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:39,279
I think I can just go and straight

448
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:40,759
say, let's go back to my creative

449
00:12:40,789 --> 00:12:41,039
brief.

450
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,799
See how we reason why we did this.

451
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,179
Right?

452
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,340
So we'll go back to the potential

453
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:44,799
questions.

454
00:12:57,399 --> 00:12:58,850
And so I can go back here now and

455
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:00,159
say, are you an info product

456
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:01,200

457
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:01,850

with phone sales

459
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:10,269
Through a VSL

460
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:15,440
book a call funnel or low ticket.

461
00:13:25,629 --> 00:13:26,720
I'm going to put this right here

462
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,480
selling high ticket items ranging

463
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:31,279
from 5,000 to $25,000.

464
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:31,509
Okay.

465
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:32,639
So here's a couple of questions.

466
00:13:32,669 --> 00:13:33,490
I'd like to ask you to help, you

467
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:34,360
know, whether or not this service

468
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,029
makes sense for you.

469
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,320
Number one, are you an info

470
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,419

471
00:13:37,419 --> 00:13:38,320

With phone sales.

475
00:13:43,879 --> 00:13:45,679
With a sales team.

476
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,600
Over the phone.

477
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:55,870
By leveraging a VSL book, a call

478
00:13:55,929 --> 00:13:58,600
funnel or a low ticket Ascension

479
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,440
funnel.

480
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,000
Yes.

481
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:00,379
Awesome.

482
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:00,779
Keep going.

483
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:05,039
Do you feel like you're

484
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:10,470
overlooking a golden, a golden, a

485
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:11,850
gold mine hidden in your email

486
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:12,080
list

487
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,879
that, you know, you could do a

488
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:23,700
better job of, um, what's the word

489
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,039
for it there?

490
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:30,980
Better job of capitalizing on of

491
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:33,039
utilizing.

492
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:37,600
All right.

493
00:14:37,649 --> 00:14:43,960
And last but not least, have you

494
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,000
tried working with copywriters?

495
00:14:46,039 --> 00:14:47,710
Have you tried working with

496
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:49,440
copywriters, but felt they failed

497
00:14:49,539 --> 00:14:50,720
to capture out that big voice?

498
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:51,590
Or have you been stuck?

499
00:14:54,919 --> 00:14:58,750
Um, writing all your emails

500
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,080
yourself.

501
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,720
If you answered yes.

502
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:07,159
To all those questions, to those

503
00:15:07,159 --> 00:15:07,759
questions.

504
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:08,960
That's because not all right.

505
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
There's that one where they may

506
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,039
need to never hire someone.

507
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,029
If you answered yes to those

508
00:15:12,029 --> 00:15:13,200
questions, congratulations.

509
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:13,919
You're in the right place.

510
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,549
You're in the, isn't this the

511
00:15:20,549 --> 00:15:22,190
tickety tickety tickety so

512
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:22,960
satisfying.

513
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:23,679
Maybe you hate it.

514
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,309
Sorry.

515
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:24,799
Deal with it.

516
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,659
Um, uh, if you answered yes to

517
00:15:27,659 --> 00:15:28,879
those questions, congratulations,

518
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:29,950
you're in the right place.

519
00:15:30,039 --> 00:15:36,090
Um, what I'd like to do over the

520
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:41,919
next, um, a few minutes

521
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,620
is explained to you, blah, blah,

522
00:15:48,789 --> 00:15:49,679
blah.

523
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:50,549
I'll come back to that later,

524
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:50,799
right?

525
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,470
Because I don't even know what the

526
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:52,000
hell I'm going to explain.

527
00:15:52,039 --> 00:15:52,950
Just let me have to delete all

528
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:53,279
this.

529
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,149
Okay.

530
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:54,399
So.

531
00:15:55,159 --> 00:16:04,559
So here's, here's a good question.

532
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:09,279
Why do most people's emails?

533
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:14,090
Why do most people's emails get

534
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:15,440
ignored?

535
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:20,159
And result in a extremely, which

536
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:22,240
results in a low click-through

537
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,419
rate, which results

538
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:29,120
in an atrociously low open rate

539
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,269
and

540
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,490
atrociously low attributed

541
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:40,049
revenue.

542
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:44,320
Open rate and click-through rate.

543
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:49,190
So here's a good question.

544
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,480
Why do most people's emails get

545
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:50,720
ignored?

546
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:52,240
Which results, which results in a

547
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,039
atrociously low attributed rate.

548
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,759
Atrociously, which results in.

549
00:16:57,799 --> 00:16:59,200
That's why atrociously low

550
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,120
attribute revenue, open rate and

551
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:01,759
click-through rates.

552
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:04,450
Open rates and click-through

553
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:05,519
rates, right?

554
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:06,960
The reason why is because

555
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,640
It's actually pretty simple.

556
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,799
Most email marketing falls flat

557
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:16,559
because it lacks personalization.

558
00:17:16,598 --> 00:17:18,920
Sending blanket one size fits all

559
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,609
messages simply doesn't cut it

560
00:17:20,609 --> 00:17:21,049
anymore.

561
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,750
Your subscribers are bombarded

562
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,109
with hundreds of emails per day

563
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:25,359
competing for their attention.

564
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,500
To stand out in the noise, your

565
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,598
messages need to feel like they

566
00:17:27,598 --> 00:17:28,720
were written specifically for each

567
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:33,119
need to be extremely valuable

568
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:38,390
and pass something I call the

569
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,759
coffee test.

570
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:41,829
Everyone holds

571
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:46,799
their morning cup of Joe

572
00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:51,839
sacred, right?

573
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:52,160
Would

574
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:59,920
your prospect, um, enjoy reading

575
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:03,759
your emails with their

576
00:18:07,079 --> 00:18:11,029
Monday morning coffee.

577
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,299
Yes.

578
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:17,119
Um, for most

579
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:21,440
the answer is no, because their

580
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:21,839
emails

581
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:26,559
are just a wild pitch fest.

582
00:18:26,599 --> 00:18:29,480
Or just an annoying pitch fest.

583
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:32,309
I think that's kind of where we go

584
00:18:32,329 --> 00:18:33,200
to on that as well.

585
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:44,799
This is why most done for you

586
00:18:44,859 --> 00:18:47,859
email services fail.

587
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:50,619
They rely on, um, um, don't work,

588
00:18:50,619 --> 00:18:53,039
um, don't work all that well.

589
00:18:53,079 --> 00:18:57,119
They rely on templates, outsource

590
00:18:57,119 --> 00:18:58,880
writers and focus on sales over

591
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,279
value.

592
00:18:59,319 --> 00:19:01,039
And the result is that the email

593
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,119
sound and the result

594
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:10,400
is that the emails

595
00:19:10,869 --> 00:19:13,670
sound robotic, inauthentic, and

596
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:16,240
overly, and, and super promo-y and

597
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,519
okay, it's no wonder why

598
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:22,319
engagement plunders.

599
00:19:22,359 --> 00:19:28,000
It's no wonder why engagement

600
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:28,400
plummets.

601
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:32,789
Under why engagement plummets.

602
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:33,279
Okay.

603
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:35,039
So let's see where we're at right

604
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:35,200
here.

605
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:38,259
Let's zoom out a bit.

606
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,839
So we got our intro down and now

607
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:44,000
we're moving into the next part

608
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:44,960
where we're explaining the

609
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:45,680
solution.

610
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:45,910
Okay.

611
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:49,119
So I now want to record and I'm

612
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:51,440
sorry, not record, but time myself

613
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,839
to see how long I'm at right here

614
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,470
for pacing.

615
00:19:54,519 --> 00:19:56,720
Now I like doing this.

616
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:57,670
I know a lot of people that say,

617
00:19:57,690 --> 00:19:58,720
you should just write the entire

618
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:58,960
time.

619
00:19:59,000 --> 00:19:59,829
Don't stop writing.

620
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,119
I don't like doing that.

621
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,799
Um, that's my own personal method.

622
00:20:02,839 --> 00:20:03,779
Again, like I said, everyone's

623
00:20:03,779 --> 00:20:04,960
writing process is unique.

624
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:05,680
Mine is like this.

625
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,039
I like stopping and, you know,

626
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,160
timing it and seeing where I'm at.

627
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,309
So I'd like to be at about a

628
00:20:09,309 --> 00:20:11,220
minute right here because I have

629
00:20:11,269 --> 00:20:12,319
still some more to go.

630
00:20:12,359 --> 00:20:12,549
Right.

631
00:20:12,589 --> 00:20:13,490
I'd like to be for at least like a

632
00:20:13,529 --> 00:20:14,400
minute, minute 30.

633
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:14,720
Okay.

634
00:20:14,759 --> 00:20:15,519
So let's get started.

635
00:20:15,559 --> 00:20:18,319
So I'm going to hit a stopwatch

636
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:19,089
and I'm going to read this out

637
00:20:19,089 --> 00:20:19,359
loud.

638
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:19,920
Ready?

639
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:20,789
I'm going to restart.

640
00:20:20,839 --> 00:20:21,599
Ready?

641
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:21,920
Set.

642
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,839
Go.

643
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,339
I guarantee I can transform your

644
00:20:26,339 --> 00:20:27,940
underperforming email list into a

645
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:29,359
powerhouse for engagement,

646
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,829
conversions, and revenue growth

647
00:20:30,869 --> 00:20:32,630
inside your info product business.

648
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,509
Sound good?

649
00:20:33,559 --> 00:20:35,039
Here's the 80/20 of this video.

650
00:20:35,079 --> 00:20:36,190
With my personalized inbox

651
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:37,680
intimacy approach, I will craft

652
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:38,769
emails that sound like they came

653
00:20:38,839 --> 00:20:40,440
directly from you based on your

654
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,859
content and in-depth interviews

655
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:42,529
that I'll conduct with

656
00:20:42,599 --> 00:20:43,430
you personally.

657
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,750
And if you don't see a substantial

658
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:45,829
increase in open rates,

659
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:46,799
click-throughs, and sales,

660
00:20:46,839 --> 00:20:48,799
then 90 days, you pay nothing.

661
00:20:48,839 --> 00:20:50,130
Now, here's a couple of questions

662
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:51,190
I'd like to ask you, which will

663
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:51,789
help you know whether

664
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,049
or not this service makes sense

665
00:20:53,049 --> 00:20:53,519
for you.

666
00:20:53,559 --> 00:20:54,670
Number one, are you an info

667
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,019
product business owner doing at

668
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:57,279
least a hundred K a month,

669
00:20:57,319 --> 00:20:58,809
selling high ticket items ranging

670
00:20:58,809 --> 00:21:01,430
from $5,000 to $25,000 over the

671
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:02,720
phone by leveraging a VSL,

672
00:21:02,759 --> 00:21:04,039
book a call funnel, or a low

673
00:21:04,039 --> 00:21:05,519
ticket ascension funnel?

674
00:21:05,559 --> 00:21:06,720
Number two, do you feel like

675
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,240
you're overlooking a goldmine

676
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,519
hidden in your email list that you

677
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:10,849
know you could do a better job of

678
00:21:10,849 --> 00:21:11,519
utilizing?

679
00:21:11,559 --> 00:21:12,890
And last but not least, number

680
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:14,400
three, have you tried working with

681
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,519
copywriters before

682
00:21:15,559 --> 00:21:16,680
but felt like they failed to

683
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,160
capture your authentic voice?

684
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,839
Or have you been stuck writing all

685
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:21,119
your emails yourself?

686
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,109
If you answered yes to those

687
00:21:22,109 --> 00:21:23,609
questions, congratulations, you're

688
00:21:23,609 --> 00:21:24,390
in the right place.

689
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,440
What I'd like to do over the next

690
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,400
few minutes is explain to you

691
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,839
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

692
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,599
So here's a good question.

693
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:31,170
Why do most people's emails get

694
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:32,240
ignored, which results in

695
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:32,799
atrociously

696
00:21:32,839 --> 00:21:33,839
low attributed revenue, open

697
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:35,109
rates, and click-through rates?

698
00:21:35,109 --> 00:21:36,250
The reason why is actually pretty

699
00:21:36,359 --> 00:21:36,799
simple.

700
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:38,549
Most email marketing falls flat on

701
00:21:38,549 --> 00:21:39,789
its face because it lacks

702
00:21:39,809 --> 00:21:40,799
personalization.

703
00:21:40,839 --> 00:21:42,670
Sending blanket, one-size-fits-all

704
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:44,160
messages simply doesn't cut it

705
00:21:44,359 --> 00:21:44,880
anymore.

706
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,509
Your subscribers are bombarded

707
00:21:46,509 --> 00:21:48,319
with hundreds of emails per day

708
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,680
competing for their intention.

709
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,980
To stand out in the noise, your

710
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:52,220
messages need to be extremely

711
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:54,140
valuable and pass something I call

712
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:54,640
the coffee

713
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,509
test.

714
00:21:55,609 --> 00:21:56,920
Everyone holds their morning cup

715
00:21:56,930 --> 00:21:57,630
of joe sacred.

716
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:59,599
Would your prospect enjoy reading

717
00:21:59,599 --> 00:21:59,759
your

718
00:21:59,799 --> 00:22:01,359
emails with their morning coffee?

719
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:02,819
For most, the answer is no because

720
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,079
the emails are just an annoying

721
00:22:04,119 --> 00:22:04,880
pitch fest.

722
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:06,539
This is why most done-for-you

723
00:22:06,789 --> 00:22:08,470
email services don't work all that

724
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:09,039
well.

725
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:09,680
They rely on

726
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,700
templates, outsourced writers, and

727
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,240
a focus on sales over value.

728
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,960
And the result is that the emails

729
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:15,200
sound

730
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,829
robotic, inauthentic, and super

731
00:22:16,829 --> 00:22:17,309
spammy.

732
00:22:17,309 --> 00:22:18,849
It's no wonder why the engagement

733
00:22:18,849 --> 00:22:19,519
plummets.

734
00:22:19,559 --> 00:22:20,009
Boom.

735
00:22:20,009 --> 00:22:22,130
So we're at right around 155.

736
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:23,839
We're at like two minutes there.

737
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,039
So a bit wordy here.

738
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:27,049
I want to get through the rest of

739
00:22:27,049 --> 00:22:27,519
the VSL.

740
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:28,609
We haven't even done the blah,

741
00:22:28,609 --> 00:22:28,799
blah,

742
00:22:28,839 --> 00:22:29,319
blah.

743
00:22:29,339 --> 00:22:31,519
But I know now with this section,

744
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:33,029
right, I can go and I can say,

745
00:22:33,029 --> 00:22:34,720
"Hey, this is a bit wordy."

746
00:22:34,759 --> 00:22:36,150
I'm going to yellow highlight it

747
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:37,619
here, and I can probably make it a

748
00:22:37,619 --> 00:22:38,880
little bit better there.

749
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:39,920
So it'll probably be at like two

750
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,160
minutes and 30 seconds because I

751
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,150
didn't even do the blah, blah,

752
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,029
blah right there.

753
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:44,529
So now here's the thing.

754
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:46,240
If I can get through this in about

755
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,680
two minutes and 30 seconds,

756
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:48,329
then solid.

757
00:22:48,329 --> 00:22:49,630
But I'm going to be honest, I

758
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:50,990
don't know if I'll be able to do

759
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:51,420
that.

760
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:52,240
We'll see though.

761
00:22:52,279 --> 00:22:52,759
Okay.

762
00:22:52,779 --> 00:22:55,299
So I can either A, reduce this or

763
00:22:55,319 --> 00:22:56,730
B, speed this up here.

764
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:57,359
Okay.

765
00:22:57,359 --> 00:22:58,480
So I'm just going to go right

766
00:22:58,519 --> 00:22:59,619
into it and we'll see what

767
00:22:59,619 --> 00:23:00,160
happens.

768
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,470
Kind of just figuring out as we

769
00:23:01,519 --> 00:23:01,839
go.

770
00:23:02,029 --> 00:23:04,000
So what's the solution?

771
00:23:04,039 --> 00:23:05,640
Well, that's where our inbox

772
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,680
intimacy method comes into play.

773
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:15,279
So, what's the solution?

774
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:16,400
Well, that's a great way for me to

775
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,039
introduce myself.

776
00:23:17,089 --> 00:23:26,160
My name is Nicholas Verge.

777
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:30,400
I'm a direct response copywriter

778
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:35,660
Who's been in the info product

779
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:36,130
industry

780
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:42,759
for five years now and have been

781
00:23:42,759 --> 00:23:45,039
able to produce

782
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:50,160
one sec.

783
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,359
I can actually just copy and paste

784
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:51,730
it.

785
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:52,940
I just pulled this from the gamma

786
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:53,119
doc.

787
00:23:58,759 --> 00:23:59,589
It's not close to it.

788
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:02,160
It's over 30 million dollars

789
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:05,039
writing for

790
00:24:05,799 --> 00:24:10,190
for celebrity clients like Alex

791
00:24:10,309 --> 00:24:11,839
Jones, Jordan Belfort and many

792
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:12,869
other underground names.

793
00:24:12,869 --> 00:24:13,519
You don't know,

794
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:15,119
but they're quietly cleaning up

795
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:16,170
seven and eight figures, seven to

796
00:24:16,269 --> 00:24:16,799
eight figures a year.

797
00:24:16,859 --> 00:24:21,200
Seven to eight figures a year.

798
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,559
One of my main specialties

799
00:24:27,319 --> 00:24:34,730
Writing it is writing email

800
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:35,920
newsletters, but not just any,

801
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:39,460
but not just any type that just,

802
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,960
uh, your average

803
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,599
run of the mill pitch, pitch,

804
00:24:44,599 --> 00:24:45,359
pitch

805
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:52,559
newsletters.

806
00:24:52,599 --> 00:24:59,119
My newsletters follow a

807
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:02,480
methodology I created called

808
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:07,920
the inbox intimacy method.

809
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:14,880
I don't just write your emails.

810
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,640
I immerse myself

811
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:23,599
In your world to ensure I

812
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:25,470
intimately understand your voice,

813
00:25:25,539 --> 00:25:26,880
expertise and goals.

814
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:27,359
Okay.

815
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,299
I conduct in-depth interviews to

816
00:25:29,299 --> 00:25:30,960
capture your unique perspectives

817
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,079
and all industry knowledge.

818
00:25:32,839 --> 00:25:35,279
Industry knowledge.

819
00:25:35,319 --> 00:25:35,660
And then

820
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:41,769
I probably look so autistic right

821
00:25:41,769 --> 00:25:41,920
now.

822
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:42,319
Just fucking.

823
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:46,319
And then I transform your insights

824
00:25:46,359 --> 00:25:48,880
into compelling emails that

825
00:25:49,029 --> 00:25:50,400
balance emotional educational

826
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,000
content with promotional material.

827
00:25:52,039 --> 00:25:53,599
This tactful balance balance

828
00:25:53,599 --> 00:25:55,440
builds trust while keeping your

829
00:25:55,559 --> 00:25:56,799
audience receptive and actively

830
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:57,279
engaged.

831
00:26:02,359 --> 00:26:03,680
I don't really need to say this

832
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,640
question right here.

833
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:10,000
Unlike traditional services.

834
00:26:10,039 --> 00:26:11,200
Some of the.

835
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,440
Unlike.

836
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,039
Most.

837
00:26:15,799 --> 00:26:18,640
Copywriters who.

838
00:26:22,109 --> 00:26:22,880
I don't know how to say this

839
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:23,279
exactly.

840
00:26:23,319 --> 00:26:24,720
I'm unlike most copywriters who

841
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,279
are stacking.

842
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:34,950
You know, I can just actually say,

843
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:36,160
um, I don't use templates.

844
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:39,220
I don't use templates.

845
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,640
I don't work with a ton of people.

846
00:26:43,079 --> 00:26:45,039
I don't use templates and I don't

847
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:47,359
work with a ton of people.

848
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,720
This is what allows me.

849
00:26:50,519 --> 00:26:54,160
This is.

850
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:55,759
What.

851
00:26:55,799 --> 00:26:58,160
Enables me to craft.

852
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:01,890
Bespoke emails tailored to you and

853
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:02,799
your audience.

854
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:07,519
Right.

855
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:08,740
This is what enables me to craft

856
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:10,579
bespoke emails tailored to you and

857
00:27:11,069 --> 00:27:11,680
your audience.

858
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,250
This ensures that every message

859
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:14,990
strongly represents your brand and

860
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:15,519
identity.

861
00:27:15,559 --> 00:27:17,400
So my newsletters follow

862
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,579
methodology.

863
00:27:18,759 --> 00:27:19,660
I called the inbox intimacy

864
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:20,079
method.

865
00:27:20,119 --> 00:27:21,279
I don't just write your emails.

866
00:27:21,319 --> 00:27:22,759
I immerse myself in your world to

867
00:27:22,759 --> 00:27:24,339
ensure I intimately understand

868
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:25,759
your voice expertise and goals.

869
00:27:25,799 --> 00:27:26,890
I conduct in-depth interviews to

870
00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:27,980
capture unique perspectives and

871
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:28,799
industry knowledge.

872
00:27:28,839 --> 00:27:30,079
And then I transform your insights

873
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:31,109
into compelling emails that

874
00:27:31,109 --> 00:27:32,480
balance educational content

875
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:33,680
with promotional material.

876
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,859
This tactical balance builds

877
00:27:34,859 --> 00:27:35,119
trust.

878
00:27:36,359 --> 00:27:37,190
I don't use templates.

879
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:38,240
I don't work with a ton of people.

880
00:27:38,279 --> 00:27:39,400
This is what enables me to craft

881
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,680
bespoke emails tailored to you and

882
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:41,279
your audience.

883
00:27:42,039 --> 00:27:47,119
Craft high quality.

884
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:50,180
Bespoke emails tailored to you and

885
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:52,799
your audience that provide.

886
00:27:52,839 --> 00:27:54,319
Which provide.

887
00:27:54,359 --> 00:27:56,160
You don't have to always say that.

888
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:00,000
Which provide a ton of value.

889
00:28:00,039 --> 00:28:00,559
Okay.

890
00:28:00,599 --> 00:28:01,839
This ensures that every message

891
00:28:01,839 --> 00:28:02,640
strongly represent.

892
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,000
I don't know.

893
00:28:04,029 --> 00:28:04,799
I think I need to say that.

894
00:28:04,839 --> 00:28:05,839
That's what bespoke means.

895
00:28:06,599 --> 00:28:10,990
This methodology.

896
00:28:11,799 --> 00:28:13,920
Prioritizes.

897
00:28:14,529 --> 00:28:16,240
Prioritizes.

898
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:18,480
Building long-term relationships.

899
00:28:18,519 --> 00:28:20,000
Not just short-term sales.

900
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:21,759
Our focus extends beyond the inbox

901
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:23,059
to forge lasting connections

902
00:28:23,549 --> 00:28:24,490
through value exchange.

903
00:28:24,599 --> 00:28:26,150
This fosters customer loyalty over

904
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:27,200
quick connections.

905
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,400
That's what's going to foster.

906
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,269
This is what's going to foster.

907
00:28:29,319 --> 00:28:31,910
This is what's going to foster

908
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:33,759
customer loyalty.

909
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:36,900
Help you accumulate.

910
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:39,839
Audience loyalty.

911
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:42,900
Audience loyalty and relation.

912
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,559
A better relationship with your

913
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:45,200
audience.

914
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,000
I'm going to say that.

915
00:28:46,039 --> 00:28:46,480
Audience.

916
00:28:46,519 --> 00:28:48,190
That's a way better relationship

917
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:49,200
with your audience.

918
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:56,880
With your audience.

919
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:01,599
Which will.

920
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:04,160
Result in way more sales.

921
00:29:07,799 --> 00:29:08,390
in the long run.

922
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:13,829
My clients have seen.

923
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,650
My clients have seen astonishing

924
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:17,039
results from the service.

925
00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:23,869
From this methodology.

926
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:26,400
And I've even.

927
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:29,460
Included a case study.

928
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:32,069
Down below.

929
00:29:32,119 --> 00:29:32,640
Explaining.

930
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:35,000
Showing how one of.

931
00:29:44,759 --> 00:29:46,319
Do 930,000.

932
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:52,720
By utilizing.

933
00:29:52,759 --> 00:29:53,759
This high value.

934
00:29:54,519 --> 00:29:56,750
Methodology.

935
00:29:57,559 --> 00:30:10,130
Now.

936
00:30:10,599 --> 00:30:11,430
Here's a question for you.

937
00:30:14,759 --> 00:30:17,359
Here's one last question.

938
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:17,740
For you.

939
00:30:17,799 --> 00:30:18,960
Do you want to.

940
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,839
Do you.

941
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:24,789
Second guys.

942
00:30:24,819 --> 00:30:25,420
I'm going to pause this real

943
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:25,670
quick.

944
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:26,240
For one second.

945
00:30:26,279 --> 00:30:27,920
I need to take a sip of water.

946
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:28,400
Okay.

947
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:28,630
So.

948
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,880
Do you want to transform your

949
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:30,799
email marketing.

950
00:30:30,839 --> 00:30:30,950
With.

951
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:31,680
With this.

952
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:32,480
With my exclusive.

953
00:30:32,519 --> 00:30:33,200
Now.

954
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,559
Do you want to transform your own.

955
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:34,789
Your.

956
00:30:34,839 --> 00:30:35,670
Your email marketing.

957
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:38,670
Your email marketing.

958
00:30:38,759 --> 00:30:40,960
With my exclusive.

959
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:52,839
No.

960
00:31:14,759 --> 00:31:15,339
And so here's the thing.

961
00:31:15,339 --> 00:31:16,319
I need to have like a guarantee,

962
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:16,660
right?

963
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:17,569
Do you want to transform your

964
00:31:17,569 --> 00:31:18,809
marketing with my exclusive inbox

965
00:31:18,809 --> 00:31:19,609
intimacy service?

966
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,990
My exclusive inbox intimacy

967
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:21,769
methodology?

968
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:26,079
By having me write your emails

969
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:30,930
with my exclusive inbox intimacy

970
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:33,140
methodology.

971
00:31:34,109 --> 00:31:35,609
Right?

972
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:40,190
And like I said earlier, there's

973
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:43,900
no risk for you.

974
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,720
Okay.

975
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:51,539
Because if you don't...

976
00:31:52,480 --> 00:32:01,720
Now, here's the thing, guys.

977
00:32:11,759 --> 00:32:13,079
For this part where I'm saying

978
00:32:13,079 --> 00:32:14,710
substantial increase, right?

979
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:16,779
I have disgusting case studies and

980
00:32:16,779 --> 00:32:18,549
I have a ton of credibility and

981
00:32:18,549 --> 00:32:20,299
I've worked with a ton of people

982
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:21,720
in this industry.

983
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,339
Jordan Belfort, Alex Jones, Badris

984
00:32:23,339 --> 00:32:24,849
Cullian, even written for Caitlyn

985
00:32:24,849 --> 00:32:25,960
Jenner at one point.

986
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:26,720
Like that was a big mistake.

987
00:32:26,759 --> 00:32:28,369
But anyways, like I've been able

988
00:32:28,369 --> 00:32:29,710
to work with huge names.

989
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:30,579
I've been able to produce a

990
00:32:30,579 --> 00:32:31,720
disgusting amount of revenue.

991
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:32,440
So I don't need to be as

992
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:33,650
aggressive with my guarantees.

993
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:35,190
I could, but it's really hard with

994
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,609
the service because it's like,

995
00:32:36,609 --> 00:32:38,079
dude, there's so many factors that

996
00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:39,509
I can't play into it with this.

997
00:32:39,779 --> 00:32:41,720
You guys should be aggressive with

998
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:41,720
your guarantees.

999
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:43,259
I'm just using my example here so

1000
00:32:43,259 --> 00:32:44,779
we can have something to actually

1001
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:45,720
record on it.

1002
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,869
But for the most part, guys, you

1003
00:32:47,869 --> 00:32:49,869
can go and apply this to your own

1004
00:32:49,869 --> 00:32:51,950
stuff and you should make it so,

1005
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:52,690
right?

1006
00:32:52,759 --> 00:32:53,720
You have a very aggressive

1007
00:32:53,849 --> 00:32:55,059
guarantee on it because if they

1008
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,720
don't match all the stipulations,

1009
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:56,720
right?

1010
00:32:56,759 --> 00:32:58,150
You can go and say something else,

1011
00:32:58,150 --> 00:32:58,720
whatever.

1012
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,099
I personally don't feel the need

1013
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:00,720
to do that.

1014
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,690
I would recommend you do that

1015
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:02,869
though, because you probably are

1016
00:33:02,869 --> 00:33:03,930
in a different situation than I

1017
00:33:03,930 --> 00:33:04,049
am.

1018
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:04,700
Okay.

1019
00:33:04,759 --> 00:33:05,779
Like I said earlier, there's no

1020
00:33:05,779 --> 00:33:06,859
risk for you because if you don't

1021
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:08,019
see a substantial increase in open

1022
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:09,259
rates, click throughs and sales

1023
00:33:09,769 --> 00:33:11,200
within 90 days, you pay nothing,

1024
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:11,720
right?

1025
00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:12,829
So if you're open to exploring

1026
00:33:12,829 --> 00:33:13,859
that possibility, open to

1027
00:33:13,859 --> 00:33:14,970
exploring the possibility of

1028
00:33:15,269 --> 00:33:17,509
working with me, the possibility

1029
00:33:17,509 --> 00:33:22,660
of working with me, there's a

1030
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:30,240
button below where you can check

1031
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,509
out our quick, uh, you can fill

1032
00:33:32,509 --> 00:33:32,720
out.

1033
00:33:32,759 --> 00:33:36,910
Fill out a quick questionnaire to

1034
00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:40,500
discuss how we can boost your

1035
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:44,710
email marketing performance.

1036
00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:55,680
Then, if you fill that out, you'll

1037
00:33:55,859 --> 00:34:00,019
be taken to a page where you can

1038
00:34:00,119 --> 00:34:01,720
book a strategy call.

1039
00:34:01,759 --> 00:34:03,329
So if you fill out a strategy

1040
00:34:03,329 --> 00:34:05,430
call, strategy call with my, uh,

1041
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:07,410
strategy call with me to kickstart

1042
00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:11,980
the path to new growth, discuss

1043
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:18,170
what it, whether or not this

1044
00:34:18,170 --> 00:34:22,420
service makes sense for you and

1045
00:34:22,429 --> 00:34:24,679
your business, right?

1046
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:25,719
So here's the thing.

1047
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:27,710
Now I have to send it.

1048
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:28,719
Now I have to state this as well.

1049
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:33,719
I only work with three clients.

1050
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,570
The majority of my income from

1051
00:34:48,570 --> 00:34:52,619
consulting and one-on-one

1052
00:34:52,869 --> 00:34:54,719
coaching.

1053
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:58,190
So I do not stack dozens and

1054
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:02,719
dozens of done for you projects.

1055
00:35:02,719 --> 00:35:06,320
Um, because I don't have the time

1056
00:35:06,329 --> 00:35:10,719
for it.

1057
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,449
Um, at the time of recording this

1058
00:35:12,449 --> 00:35:14,929
video, adding some scarcity here,

1059
00:35:14,929 --> 00:35:15,719
right?

1060
00:35:15,719 --> 00:35:16,449
Uh, at the time of recording this

1061
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:20,719
video, I only have two spots

1062
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:23,510
remaining for this service

1063
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:25,719
service.

1064
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:31,800
So if you're interested in blowing

1065
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:37,079
up your email marketing in a good

1066
00:35:37,159 --> 00:35:46,679
way,

1067
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:47,719
good way claim your spot.

1068
00:35:47,719 --> 00:35:56,719
Now click the button below below

1069
00:35:56,719 --> 00:36:00,530
to claim your spot, claim your

1070
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:02,500
spot now before availability for

1071
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:03,719
this before availability fills up.

1072
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:05,719
All righty.

1073
00:36:05,719 --> 00:36:09,719
All the best by now.

1074
00:36:09,719 --> 00:36:10,659
Okay.

1075
00:36:11,329 --> 00:36:14,789
So I know that this was about two

1076
00:36:14,789 --> 00:36:15,719
minutes.

1077
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,280
I think I may have been able to

1078
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,710
hit this in under five.

1079
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,719
There's a good chance that I did.

1080
00:36:20,719 --> 00:36:21,710
We're going to see now.

1081
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,869
So what I'm going to do is I'm

1082
00:36:22,869 --> 00:36:24,219
going to go through and I'm going

1083
00:36:24,219 --> 00:36:25,449
to read this out loud and we're

1084
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:26,719
going to see where I'm at.

1085
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,280
It's a pretty fast script and it

1086
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,710
pitches pretty quickly.

1087
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:31,210
Now guys, you may have a little

1088
00:36:31,429 --> 00:36:32,659
bit more complicated of a script.

1089
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,719
You may want to go for 10 minutes.

1090
00:36:34,719 --> 00:36:35,369
You may want to go for eight

1091
00:36:35,449 --> 00:36:35,710
minutes.

1092
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,309
What I'm telling you is that the

1093
00:36:38,309 --> 00:36:39,780
better VSL is going to be five

1094
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:40,719
minutes long.

1095
00:36:40,719 --> 00:36:43,619
Your audience is busy.

1096
00:36:43,769 --> 00:36:44,710
Okay.

1097
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,719
If it's B2B that you're selling,

1098
00:36:46,719 --> 00:36:48,719
your audience is busy.

1099
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:49,989
So don't take up a shit ton of

1100
00:36:49,989 --> 00:36:50,659
their time.

1101
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,530
So let's dive in real quick on

1102
00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:53,710
doing the read.

1103
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:56,659
So I'm 155 for this yellow part.

1104
00:36:56,719 --> 00:36:58,710
So let's see where I'm at.

1105
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,719
Okay.

1106
00:36:59,719 --> 00:37:00,440
Zero seconds on the clock.

1107
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:00,719
Ready?

1108
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:03,719
Set.

1109
00:37:03,719 --> 00:37:05,550
One sec.

1110
00:37:05,769 --> 00:37:06,550
Ready?

1111
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:07,170
Set.

1112
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:07,719
Go.

1113
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,739
I guarantee I can transform your

1114
00:37:09,739 --> 00:37:11,889
underperforming email list into a

1115
00:37:11,889 --> 00:37:13,659
powerhouse for engagement,

1116
00:37:13,719 --> 00:37:15,030
conversion, and revenue growth

1117
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:16,719
inside your info product business.

1118
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,719
Sound good?

1119
00:37:17,719 --> 00:37:19,269
I accidentally scrolled too far

1120
00:37:19,449 --> 00:37:19,710
down.

1121
00:37:19,769 --> 00:37:21,719
One sec.

1122
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,360
I guarantee I can transform your

1123
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:25,099
underperforming email list into a

1124
00:37:25,269 --> 00:37:26,719
powerhouse for engagement,

1125
00:37:26,719 --> 00:37:27,639
conversions, and revenue growth

1126
00:37:27,639 --> 00:37:28,650
inside your info product business.

1127
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,719
Sound good?

1128
00:37:29,719 --> 00:37:31,710
Here's the 80/20 of this video.

1129
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:32,820
With my personalized inbox

1130
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:34,280
intimacy approach, I will craft

1131
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,619
emails that sound like they came

1132
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,929
directly from you based on your

1133
00:37:37,929 --> 00:37:39,440
content and in-depth interviews

1134
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,190
that I'll conduct with you

1135
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:40,710
personally.

1136
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,010
And if you don't see a substantial

1137
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:42,960
increase in open rates,

1138
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,599
click-throughs, and sales, then 90

1139
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:45,719
days, you pay nothing.

1140
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,019
Now, here's a couple of questions

1141
00:37:47,019 --> 00:37:48,179
I'd like to ask you, which will

1142
00:37:48,179 --> 00:37:49,389
help you know whether or not this

1143
00:37:49,389 --> 00:37:50,719
service makes sense for you.

1144
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,489
Number one, are you an info

1145
00:37:52,489 --> 00:37:54,170
product business owner doing at

1146
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,210
least $100K a month selling high

1147
00:37:56,210 --> 00:37:57,619
ticket items ranging from $5,000

1148
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,880
to $25,000 over the phone by

1149
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:02,300
leveraging a VSL, book a call, or

1150
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:03,719
low ticket ascension funnel?

1151
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:04,750
Do you feel like you're

1152
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:06,280
overlooking a gold mine hidden in

1153
00:38:06,449 --> 00:38:07,599
your email list that you know

1154
00:38:07,679 --> 00:38:08,869
could be doing a better job of

1155
00:38:08,989 --> 00:38:09,659
utilizing?

1156
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,989
And last but not least, have you

1157
00:38:10,989 --> 00:38:12,260
tried working with copywriters

1158
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,599
before, but they failed to capture

1159
00:38:13,679 --> 00:38:15,329
your authentic voice, or you've

1160
00:38:15,329 --> 00:38:17,369
just been stuck writing all your

1161
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,719
emails yourself?

1162
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,539
If you answered yes to those

1163
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:20,940
questions, congratulations, you're

1164
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:21,710
in the right place.

1165
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,789
What I'd like to do is over the

1166
00:38:22,789 --> 00:38:23,900
next few months, I'm going to

1167
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:25,260
explain to you blah, blah, blah,

1168
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:25,719
blah.

1169
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,719
So here's a good question.

1170
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,900
Why do most people's emails get

1171
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,300
ignored, which results in

1172
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:31,199
atrociously low attributed

1173
00:38:31,429 --> 00:38:32,099
revenue, open rates, and

1174
00:38:32,099 --> 00:38:32,659
click-through rates?

1175
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,190
The reason why is actually pretty

1176
00:38:34,199 --> 00:38:34,719
simple.

1177
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,820
Most email marketing falls flat on

1178
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:38,340
its face because it lacks

1179
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:39,719
personalization.

1180
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,219
Sending blanket one-size-fits-all

1181
00:38:42,219 --> 00:38:44,409
BS messages simply just doesn't

1182
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,659
cut it anymore.

1183
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,010
Your subscribers are bombarded

1184
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:48,250
with hundreds of emails per day

1185
00:38:48,429 --> 00:38:49,719
competing for their attention.

1186
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,929
To stand out in the noise, your

1187
00:38:50,929 --> 00:38:52,210
messages need to be extremely

1188
00:38:52,429 --> 00:38:53,719
valuable and pass something I call

1189
00:38:53,719 --> 00:38:54,719
the coffee test.

1190
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,030
Everyone holds their morning cup

1191
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:56,719
of Joe sacred.

1192
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,510
Would your prospect enjoy reading

1193
00:38:58,510 --> 00:38:59,789
your emails with their morning

1194
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:00,719
coffee?

1195
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,030
For most, the answer is no,

1196
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:03,519
because their emails are just an

1197
00:39:03,519 --> 00:39:04,719
annoying pitch fest.

1198
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,320
This is why most done-for-you

1199
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,190
email services don't work all that

1200
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:08,719
well.

1201
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,960
They rely on templates, outsourced

1202
00:39:10,969 --> 00:39:13,059
writers, and a focus on sales over

1203
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:13,719
value.

1204
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,190
And the result is that the emails

1205
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:16,780
sound robotic, inauthentic, and

1206
00:39:16,829 --> 00:39:17,719
super spammy.

1207
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,110
It's no wonder why the engagement

1208
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:19,719
plummets.

1209
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,719
So what's the solution?

1210
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,889
Well, that's a great way for me to

1211
00:39:22,889 --> 00:39:23,719
introduce myself.

1212
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,960
My name is Nicholas Verge, and I'm

1213
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:26,980
a direct response copywriter who's

1214
00:39:27,019 --> 00:39:28,199
been in the info product industry

1215
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:28,719
for five years now.

1216
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:30,320
I've been able to produce over $30

1217
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,349
million writing for celebrity

1218
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,179
clients like Alex Jones, Jordan

1219
00:39:33,179 --> 00:39:34,639
Belfort, and many other

1220
00:39:34,639 --> 00:39:36,789
underground names you don't know,

1221
00:39:36,789 --> 00:39:37,809
but they're quietly cleaning up

1222
00:39:37,809 --> 00:39:38,719
seven to eight figures.

1223
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,650
One of my main specialties is

1224
00:39:40,650 --> 00:39:43,039
writing email newsletters, but not

1225
00:39:43,039 --> 00:39:44,659
just your average run-of-the-mill

1226
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:45,650
pitch pitch pitch newsletters.

1227
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:46,829
My newsletters follow a

1228
00:39:46,829 --> 00:39:48,400
methodology I created called the

1229
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:49,719
Inbox Intimacy Method.

1230
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,719
I don't just write your emails.

1231
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,840
I immerse myself in your world to

1232
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,559
ensure I intimately understand

1233
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:57,659
your voice, expertise, and goals.

1234
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,179
I conduct in-depth interviews to

1235
00:39:59,179 --> 00:40:00,639
capture unique perspectives and

1236
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:02,199
industry knowledge, and then I

1237
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:03,659
transform your insights into

1238
00:40:03,769 --> 00:40:05,710
compelling emails that balance

1239
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:06,699
educational content with

1240
00:40:06,699 --> 00:40:07,719
promotional material.

1241
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,769
This tactful balance builds trust

1242
00:40:09,769 --> 00:40:11,469
while keeping your audience

1243
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:13,659
receptive and actively engaged.

1244
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:14,769
I don't use templates, and I don't

1245
00:40:14,769 --> 00:40:15,719
work with a ton of people.

1246
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,650
This is what enables me to craft a

1247
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:19,510
high-quality, bespoke email

1248
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:21,659
tailored to you and your audience,

1249
00:40:21,659 --> 00:40:23,710
which provides a ton of value.

1250
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,280
This methodology prioritizes

1251
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,190
building long-term relationships,

1252
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,719
not just short-term sales.

1253
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,940
Our focus extends beyond the inbox

1254
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:32,860
to forge lasting connections

1255
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:34,659
through value exchange.

1256
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,059
This is what's going to help you

1257
00:40:36,059 --> 00:40:37,079
accumulate a way better

1258
00:40:37,179 --> 00:40:38,719
relationship with your audience,

1259
00:40:38,719 --> 00:40:40,329
which will result in way more

1260
00:40:40,329 --> 00:40:41,650
sales in the long run.

1261
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,260
My clients have seen astonishing

1262
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:44,789
results in this methodology, and

1263
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,199
I've even included a case study

1264
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:47,659
down below showing how one of my

1265
00:40:47,769 --> 00:40:49,059
clients was able to produce

1266
00:40:49,130 --> 00:40:51,230
$930,000 in under a year by

1267
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:52,019
utilizing this high-value

1268
00:40:52,349 --> 00:40:52,679
methodology.

1269
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:55,139
Now here's one last question for

1270
00:40:55,159 --> 00:40:55,710
you.

1271
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,090
Do you want to transform your

1272
00:40:57,090 --> 00:40:58,710
email marketing by having me write

1273
00:40:58,730 --> 00:41:00,719
your emails with my exclusive

1274
00:41:00,719 --> 00:41:01,659
inbox into that methodology?

1275
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,440
And like I said earlier, there's

1276
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,389
no risk for you because if you

1277
00:41:05,389 --> 00:41:06,869
don't see a substantial increase

1278
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:08,130
in open rates, click-throughs, and

1279
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:10,719
sales in 90 days, you pay nothing.

1280
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,190
So if you're open to exploring the

1281
00:41:12,190 --> 00:41:13,710
possibility of working with me,

1282
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:15,130
there's a button below where you

1283
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:16,659
can fill out a quick questionnaire

1284
00:41:16,719 --> 00:41:18,889
to help discuss how we can boost

1285
00:41:18,889 --> 00:41:19,719
your email marketing performance.

1286
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,329
After you fill that out, you'll be

1287
00:41:21,329 --> 00:41:22,780
taken to a page where you can book

1288
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,210
a strategy call with me to discuss

1289
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,940
whether or not this service makes

1290
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:27,710
sense for you and your business.

1291
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:28,719
Now I have to state this as well.

1292
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,460
I only work with three clients at

1293
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:31,780
any given time for this email

1294
00:41:32,269 --> 00:41:32,719
service.

1295
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:33,929
The majority of my income comes

1296
00:41:33,929 --> 00:41:35,179
from consulting and one-on-one

1297
00:41:35,429 --> 00:41:36,889
coaching, so I do not stack dozens

1298
00:41:36,889 --> 00:41:38,300
and dozens of done-for-you

1299
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:40,050
projects because I don't have time

1300
00:41:40,159 --> 00:41:40,710
for it.

1301
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:41,719
At the time of recording this

1302
00:41:41,719 --> 00:41:42,719
video, I only have two spots

1303
00:41:42,719 --> 00:41:43,869
remaining for this service, and

1304
00:41:43,869 --> 00:41:44,719
yes, that's real.

1305
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,590
So if you're interested in blowing

1306
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:48,329
up your email marketing in a good

1307
00:41:48,329 --> 00:41:49,869
way, click the button below to

1308
00:41:49,989 --> 00:41:51,300
claim your spot now before

1309
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,710
availability fills up.

1310
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:55,710
All righty, all the best, bye now.

1311
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,469
We are at four minutes and 33

1312
00:41:57,469 --> 00:41:59,420
seconds with the blah, blah, blah

1313
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:01,079
section and with the, you know,

1314
00:42:01,079 --> 00:42:02,199
couple different fuck-ups that I

1315
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:02,650
made there.

1316
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,159
I think we're going to land at

1317
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:05,710
right around five minutes.

1318
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:06,719
Solid.

1319
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:07,719
This is a pitch.

1320
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,420
It effectively communicates the

1321
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:11,179
problem, the solution, all this

1322
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:11,719
stuff.

1323
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,199
So what I'm going to do now is

1324
00:42:13,199 --> 00:42:14,619
just kind of go through and

1325
00:42:14,619 --> 00:42:17,849
fine-tooth comb, run through this

1326
00:42:17,849 --> 00:42:19,710
real quick.

1327
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:20,719
Let's go ahead.

1328
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:22,070
I don't need the highlight

1329
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:22,719
anymore.

1330
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:24,099
We don't need the highlight

1331
00:42:24,099 --> 00:42:24,719
anymore.

1332
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:25,719
Okay.

00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:53,409
you to be able to identify the

1349
00:42:53,409 --> 00:42:53,719
shit.

1350
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:54,480
That's like, ah, it doesn't sound

1351
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:54,719
right.

1352
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:55,719
Right.

1353
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,719
Or stuff you need to add in.

00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,239

1355
00:42:59,239 --> 00:43:00,780

1360
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:09,260
Here's the 80 20 of this video

1361
00:43:09,429 --> 00:43:11,130
with my personalized inbox

1362
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:12,659
intimacy approach.

1363
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:17,449
This personalized seem no, I don't

1364
00:43:17,449 --> 00:43:19,619
think it should be.

1365
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:22,400
I think it's methodology using my

1366
00:43:22,429 --> 00:43:24,210
inbox into my, I like this better

1367
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:25,119
using my inbox intimacy

1368
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:25,659
methodology.

1369
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,469
I will craft emails that sound

1370
00:43:27,469 --> 00:43:29,369
like they came directly from you

1371
00:43:29,369 --> 00:43:31,090
based on your content and in-depth

1372
00:43:31,090 --> 00:43:32,090
interviews that I'll conduct with

1373
00:43:32,090 --> 00:43:32,650
you personally.

1374
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:33,719
I like that a lot more.

1375
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,570
And if you don't see a substantial

1376
00:43:35,570 --> 00:43:37,280
increase in open rates, click

1377
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:39,530
throughs and sales within 90 days,

1378
00:43:39,530 --> 00:43:40,619
you pay nothing.

1379
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:42,659
Now, here's a couple of questions

1380
00:43:42,659 --> 00:43:44,389
I'd like to ask you, which will

1381
00:43:44,389 --> 00:43:45,869
help you know whether or not this

1382
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:46,659
service makes sense for you.

1383
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:49,000
Number one, are you an info, are

1384
00:43:49,010 --> 00:43:51,719
you an info product business?

1385
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:52,719
It's fucking time.

1386
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:53,719
My brain's fried.

1387
00:43:53,739 --> 00:43:54,489
I've been recording for two hours

1388
00:43:54,489 --> 00:43:54,719
now.

1389
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:55,860
So are you an info product

1390
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:57,269
business owner doing at least a

1391
00:43:57,429 --> 00:43:58,590
hundred K a month selling high

1392
00:43:58,679 --> 00:44:01,260
ticket items ranging from 5,000 to

1393
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:03,809
$25,000 over the phone by

1394
00:44:03,869 --> 00:44:05,030
leveraging a VSL book a call

1395
00:44:05,349 --> 00:44:06,710
funnel or a low ticket ascension

1396
00:44:06,719 --> 00:44:06,719
funnel?

1397
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:08,110
Do you feel like you're

1398
00:44:08,130 --> 00:44:10,170
overlooking a gold mine hidden in

1399
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:11,719
your, hidden in your email list?

1400
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:16,469
A gold mine in your email list

1401
00:44:16,469 --> 00:44:19,250
that, you know, you could do a

1402
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:21,269
better job of utilizing number

1403
00:44:21,269 --> 00:44:25,050
two, question number two, question

1404
00:44:25,730 --> 00:44:28,719
number one.

1405
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:37,900
You know, you could do a better

1406
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:47,239
job of utilizing question number

1407
00:44:48,110 --> 00:44:50,690
three.

1408
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:53,780
And question number three, have

1409
00:44:54,269 --> 00:44:57,489
you tried working with copywriters

1410
00:44:57,489 --> 00:45:00,780
before, but they felt like they,

1411
00:45:00,789 --> 00:45:01,679
have you tried working with

1412
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:02,730
copywriters before, but felt like

1413
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:03,719
they failed to capture?

1414
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:04,719
I like the like word there.

1415
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:06,340
I felt like they failed to capture

1416
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:07,780
your authentic voice or you've

1417
00:45:07,829 --> 00:45:12,679
just been stuck.

1418
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:13,389
Stuck writing all your emails

1419
00:45:13,429 --> 00:45:13,719
yourself.

1420
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,019
If you answered yes to those

1421
00:45:15,019 --> 00:45:16,710
questions, congratulations.

1422
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:17,719
You're in the right place.

1423
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:18,880
What I'd like to do is over the

1424
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:20,429
next few minutes, what I'd like to

1425
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:21,829
do over the next few minutes is

1426
00:45:21,829 --> 00:45:22,719
explain to you why people are

1427
00:45:22,719 --> 00:45:22,719
ignoring your.

1428
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:32,519
I'm wondering if I even need to do

1429
00:45:32,519 --> 00:45:42,320
this year is like, I am trying to

1430
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:49,719
give a summary of what's to come.

1431
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:59,440
I think I could just do like this,

1432
00:45:59,449 --> 00:46:09,070
explain to you why most, and then

1433
00:46:09,110 --> 00:46:10,679
people's is kind of vague, right?

1434
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:14,469
Most businesses email, I guess

1435
00:46:14,510 --> 00:46:18,400
this is why businesses emails get

1436
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:20,269
ignored, which results in

1437
00:46:20,269 --> 00:46:21,699
atrociously low attributed

1438
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:22,949
revenue, open rates and click

1439
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:23,719
through rates.

1440
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:31,429
And then show you a unique

1441
00:46:31,429 --> 00:46:36,719
methodology.

1442
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:37,719
Okay.

1443
00:46:37,739 --> 00:46:38,269
I'm going to show you a, which I

1444
00:46:38,269 --> 00:46:39,719
developed that makes.

1445
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:51,719
Here's an engagement and overall.

1446
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:55,719
Overall attributed revenue.

1447
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:59,420
I'm going to say, then I'd like to

1448
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:05,000
show you a unique methodology,

1449
00:47:05,090 --> 00:47:09,690
which I developed a unique

1450
00:47:09,739 --> 00:47:10,719
methodology.

1451
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:11,719
It makes it.

1452
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:17,210
I'm going to just say, show you

1453
00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:19,039
how to easily see a significant

1454
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:20,719
increase in engagement.

1455
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:23,639
And overall, I'd like to show you

1456
00:47:23,650 --> 00:47:28,699
how to easily increase your email

1457
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:36,690
lists engagement and its overall

1458
00:47:36,730 --> 00:47:40,719
revenue attributed revenue.

1459
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:43,780
And last but not least, if you're

1460
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:49,789
interested, help if you don't want

1461
00:47:49,789 --> 00:47:53,199
to do this yourself.

1462
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:55,719
All right.

1463
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:56,719
That's pretty good.

1464
00:47:56,750 --> 00:47:57,719
I think that'll bring us to about

1465
00:47:57,719 --> 00:47:58,719
five minutes right there.

1466
00:47:58,760 --> 00:47:59,719
So I've pre-frame them.

1467
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:01,030
Like, let's kind of zoom out real

1468
00:48:01,030 --> 00:48:01,719
quick, guys.

1469
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:04,710
What have I done?

1470
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:06,719
I've done the intro.

1471
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:08,719
Okay.

1472
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:10,340
And then I've transitioned into

1473
00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:11,400
like, Hey, you're in the right

1474
00:48:11,469 --> 00:48:11,710
place.

1475
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:13,280
Now I'm breaking down what's to

1476
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:13,719
come.

1477
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:15,320
And now I'm giving them the reason

1478
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:16,710
why this problem exists.

1479
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:17,719
Okay.

1480
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:19,079
And then I'm going, I just provide

1481
00:48:19,079 --> 00:48:19,719
some more value here.

1482
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:21,579
And this may even be something

1483
00:48:21,579 --> 00:48:23,170
that, you know, I could just get

1484
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:23,719
rid of this.

1485
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:24,719
Think about this.

1486
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:25,340
Your subscribers are bombarded

1487
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:25,719
with hundreds.

1488
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:27,110
This is why most done-for-you

1489
00:48:27,130 --> 00:48:28,780
email services don't work all that

1490
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:29,719
well, right?

1491
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:31,190
They rely on templates, outsource

1492
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:33,099
writers, and a focus on sales over

1493
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:33,719
value.

1494
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:34,719
They rely on templates.

1495
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:35,840
And then the result is emails that

1496
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:37,050
sound robotic, inauthentic, and

1497
00:48:37,050 --> 00:48:37,710
super spammy.

1498
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:39,239
So I could get rid of this right

1499
00:48:39,239 --> 00:48:39,719
here.

1500
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:41,340
It doesn't necessarily need to

1501
00:48:41,340 --> 00:48:42,989
have the cup of Joe test, but you

1502
00:48:43,019 --> 00:48:43,719
know, it's there.

1503
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:45,000
Sending blanket one size fits all

1504
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,199
messages simply doesn't cut it

1505
00:48:46,429 --> 00:48:46,710
anymore.

1506
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:48,199
Your subscribers are bombarded

1507
00:48:48,230 --> 00:48:49,710
with hundreds of emails per day

1508
00:48:49,710 --> 00:48:51,849
and competing for the, that are

1509
00:48:51,849 --> 00:48:54,050
competing, that are competing for

1510
00:48:54,139 --> 00:48:54,679
their attention.

1511
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:55,719
Okay.

1512
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:57,719
So let's go back here real quick.

1513
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:00,420
Most email marketing falls flat

1514
00:49:00,429 --> 00:49:03,659
because it lacks personalization.

1515
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:05,000
Sending blanket one size fits all

1516
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,199
messages simply doesn't cut it

1517
00:49:06,429 --> 00:49:06,710
anymore.

1518
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:07,900
Your subscribers are bombarded

1519
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:09,019
with hundreds of emails per day

1520
00:49:09,019 --> 00:49:10,079
that are competing for their

1521
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:10,719
attention.

1522
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:12,320
This is why most done-for-you

1523
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:14,190
email services don't work all that

1524
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:14,719
well.

1525
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:16,489
They rely on templates, outsourced

1526
00:49:16,489 --> 00:49:18,139
writers, and a focus on sales over

1527
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:18,719
value.

1528
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:20,599
And the result is that the emails

1529
00:49:20,599 --> 00:49:22,710
sound robotic, inauthentic, and

1530
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:23,719
super spammy.

1531
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:25,110
It's no wonder why the engagement

1532
00:49:25,130 --> 00:49:25,719
plundits.

1533
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:26,719
So what's the solution?

1534
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:27,889
Well, that's a great way for me to

1535
00:49:27,889 --> 00:49:28,719
introduce myself.

1536
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:29,719
My name is Nicholas Virge.

1537
00:49:29,750 --> 00:49:30,719
I'm a direct response copywriter.

1538
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:32,719
Who's been in the info product and

1539
00:49:32,719 --> 00:49:32,719
fuck.

1540
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:34,610
I didn't see that info product

1541
00:49:34,630 --> 00:49:36,719
industry for five years now.

1542
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:38,719
And I've been able five years now.

1543
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:43,579
I've been able to produce over $30

1544
00:49:43,579 --> 00:49:45,420
million writing for celebrity

1545
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:47,719
clients like Alex Jones, Jordan

1546
00:49:47,719 --> 00:49:48,829
Belfort, and many other

1547
00:49:48,829 --> 00:49:50,280
underground names you don't know,

1548
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:51,440
but they're quietly cleaning up

1549
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:52,690
seven to eight figures per year.

1550
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:54,159
One of my main specialties is

1551
00:49:54,159 --> 00:49:56,179
writing email newsletters, but not

1552
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:58,289
your average run-of-the-middle

1553
00:49:58,289 --> 00:50:00,710
pitch-pitch-pitch newsletters.

1554
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:01,829
My newsletters follow a

1555
00:50:01,829 --> 00:50:03,400
methodology I created called the

1556
00:50:03,469 --> 00:50:04,719
Inbox Intimacy Method.

1557
00:50:04,750 --> 00:50:05,719
I don't just write your emails.

1558
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:07,800
I immerse myself in your world to

1559
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:09,900
ensure I intimately understand

1560
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:11,719
your voice, expertise, and goals.

1561
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:14,000
It doesn't make sense for goals,

1562
00:50:14,010 --> 00:50:14,710
right?

1563
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:16,940
To understand your voice, your

1564
00:50:16,940 --> 00:50:28,610
expertise, and the way you

1565
00:50:28,730 --> 00:50:33,719
specifically explain concepts,

1566
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:40,130
I conduct in-depth interviews to

1567
00:50:40,250 --> 00:50:42,190
capture unique perspectives and

1568
00:50:42,269 --> 00:50:43,719
industry knowledge.

1569
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:45,719
And then I transform.

1570
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:51,659
The way I do this is by conducting

1571
00:50:51,719 --> 00:50:53,670
in-depth interviews to capture

1572
00:50:53,670 --> 00:50:55,780
unique perspectives and industry

1573
00:50:55,789 --> 00:50:56,679
knowledge.

1574
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:58,090
And then I transform your insights

1575
00:50:58,090 --> 00:50:59,219
into compelling emails that

1576
00:50:59,429 --> 00:51:00,599
balance educational content with

1577
00:51:00,679 --> 00:51:01,719
promotional material.

1578
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:03,460
This tactful balance builds trust

1579
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:04,780
while keeping your audience

1580
00:51:05,269 --> 00:51:06,719
receptive and actively engaged.

1581
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:07,769
I don't use templates and I don't

1582
00:51:07,769 --> 00:51:08,719
work with a ton of people.

1583
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:10,289
This is what enables me to craft

1584
00:51:10,289 --> 00:51:11,780
high-quality bespoke emails

1585
00:51:12,269 --> 00:51:13,719
tailored to you and your audience,

1586
00:51:13,719 --> 00:51:15,619
which provide a ton of value.

1587
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:17,280
This methodology prioritizes

1588
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:19,190
building long-term relationships,

1589
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:20,719
not just short-term sales.

1590
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:22,940
Our focus extends beyond the inbox

1591
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:24,860
to forge lasting connections

1592
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:26,659
through value exchange.

1593
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:28,059
This is what's going to help you

1594
00:51:28,059 --> 00:51:29,079
accumulate a way better

1595
00:51:29,179 --> 00:51:30,719
relationship with your audience,

1596
00:51:30,719 --> 00:51:31,440
which will result in way more

1597
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:31,719
sales.

1598
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:33,809
Let me say way more sales in the

1599
00:51:33,809 --> 00:51:34,710
long run.

1600
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:36,260
My clients have seen astonishing

1601
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:37,789
results in this methodology, and

1602
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:38,719
I've even included a case study

1603
00:51:38,719 --> 00:51:40,409
down below showing how one of my

1604
00:51:40,409 --> 00:51:41,969
clients was able to produce

1605
00:51:41,969 --> 00:51:43,900
$930,000 in under a year by

1606
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:45,030
utilizing this high-value

1607
00:51:45,349 --> 00:51:45,679
methodology.

1608
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:48,159
Now, here's one last question for

1609
00:51:48,170 --> 00:51:48,710
you.

1610
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:50,519
Do you want to transform your

1611
00:51:50,519 --> 00:51:52,710
email marketing by having me write

1612
00:51:52,710 --> 00:51:54,590
your emails with my exclusive

1613
00:51:54,590 --> 00:51:56,710
inbox intimacy methodology?

1614
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:58,179
Like I said earlier, there's no

1615
00:51:58,179 --> 00:51:59,550
risk for you because if you don't

1616
00:51:59,550 --> 00:52:01,159
see a substantial increase in open

1617
00:52:01,159 --> 00:52:02,949
rates, click-throughs, and sales

1618
00:52:02,949 --> 00:52:04,690
in 90 days, you pay nothing.

1619
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:07,469
So, if you're open to exploring

1620
00:52:07,469 --> 00:52:10,239
the possibility of working with

1621
00:52:10,239 --> 00:52:11,539
me, there's a button below where

1622
00:52:11,539 --> 00:52:12,050
you can fill out a quick

1623
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:13,760
questionnaire to discuss how we

1624
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:15,699
can boost your email marketing

1625
00:52:15,750 --> 00:52:16,710
performance.

1626
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:20,139
After you fill that out, you'll be

1627
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:21,599
taken to a page where you can book

1628
00:52:21,610 --> 00:52:23,260
a strategy call with me to discuss

1629
00:52:23,260 --> 00:52:24,940
whether or not this service makes

1630
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:26,719
sense for you and your business.

1631
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:27,719
Now, I have to state this as well.

1632
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:29,719
I only work with three clients.

1633
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:31,460
I only work with three clients at

1634
00:52:31,460 --> 00:52:32,780
any given time for this email

1635
00:52:33,269 --> 00:52:33,719
service.

1636
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:34,929
The majority of my income comes

1637
00:52:34,929 --> 00:52:36,179
from consulting and one-on-one

1638
00:52:36,429 --> 00:52:37,880
coaching, so I do not stack dozens

1639
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:39,659
and dozens of done 40 projects

1640
00:52:39,719 --> 00:52:40,650
because I don't have time for it.

1641
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:41,889
The time of recording this video,

1642
00:52:41,889 --> 00:52:42,940
I only have two spots remaining

1643
00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:43,710
for this service.

1644
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:44,449
So, if you're interested in

1645
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:45,340
blowing up your email marketing in

1646
00:52:45,340 --> 00:52:46,780
a good way, click the button below

1647
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,210
to clean up your spot now before

1648
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:49,659
availability fills up.

1649
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:57,949
You certainly could do this on

1650
00:52:57,949 --> 00:53:00,699
your own.

1651
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:01,920
Writing high value.

1652
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:19,349
Time to craft.

1653
00:53:19,559 --> 00:53:21,380
Well, let's be honest.

1654
00:53:21,420 --> 00:53:25,480
Do you really want to do that?

1655
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:33,679
Probably not.

1656
00:53:33,719 --> 00:53:35,239
Again, probably not.

1657
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:36,380
That's why you should book a call

1658
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:36,800
with me.

1659
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:37,760
So do that.

1660
00:53:38,230 --> 00:53:39,460
Probably not.

1661
00:53:40,219 --> 00:53:45,400
Which is why you should fill out

1662
00:53:45,510 --> 00:53:52,780
that questionnaire down below.

1663
00:53:52,820 --> 00:53:53,579
All righty.

1664
00:53:53,619 --> 00:53:54,250
All the best.

1665
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:54,739
Bye now.

1666
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:56,119
All righty.

1667
00:53:56,159 --> 00:53:57,590
So I'm going to get rid of this

1668
00:53:57,590 --> 00:53:59,030
because I added on some stuff at

1669
00:53:59,039 --> 00:53:59,440
the end.

1670
00:54:00,119 --> 00:54:01,500
And I just, it's not necessary.

1671
00:54:01,539 --> 00:54:02,679
Like it's kind of me explaining

1672
00:54:02,679 --> 00:54:03,739
the same thing just with a net

1673
00:54:03,739 --> 00:54:04,320
metaphor.

1674
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:05,340
And there we go.

1675
00:54:05,380 --> 00:54:07,710
So I have it where this is.

1676
00:54:08,539 --> 00:54:14,519
969, which is five times 140 is

1677
00:54:14,519 --> 00:54:15,769
700.

1678
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:16,260
Right.

1679
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:19,079
And so I talk pretty fast though.

1680
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:20,920
So I think I can move through it.

1681
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:23,159
So I'm going to do one last time.

1682
00:54:23,190 --> 00:54:24,030
I'm going to make sure I'm right

1683
00:54:24,130 --> 00:54:24,800
around five minutes.

1684
00:54:24,829 --> 00:54:25,780
I'm not going to make you guys sit

1685
00:54:25,780 --> 00:54:26,190
through.

1686
00:54:26,230 --> 00:54:27,050
I'm going to pause it and I'll

1687
00:54:27,159 --> 00:54:28,010
time it because you've already

1688
00:54:28,010 --> 00:54:28,619
seen it twice.

1689
00:54:28,940 --> 00:54:30,099
And I'm just going to see, Hey,

1690
00:54:30,099 --> 00:54:31,159
how am I landing on this?

1691
00:54:31,199 --> 00:54:32,820
If I'm good, I'm good.

1692
00:54:32,860 --> 00:54:33,960
And then we can move on to turning

1693
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:34,900
this into a gamma doc.

1694
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:36,460
So let's go ahead.

1695
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:38,119
Let's pause you guys.

1696
00:54:38,159 --> 00:54:39,500
And then I'll go and read this.

1697
00:54:40,900 --> 00:54:43,920
Four minutes and 45 seconds.

1698
00:54:44,119 --> 00:54:46,190
Oh, four minutes and 45 seconds.

1699
00:54:46,239 --> 00:54:46,699
Woo.

1700
00:54:46,739 --> 00:54:48,480
Let's go.

1701
00:54:48,519 --> 00:54:51,469
So guys, this is about 54 minutes.

1702
00:54:51,559 --> 00:54:53,880
So I would say about an hour, 10

1703
00:54:53,980 --> 00:54:55,389
minutes, maybe with pauses and

1704
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:56,500
everything in between it.

1705
00:54:56,980 --> 00:54:58,460
So BSL script done.

1706
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:01,139
Doesn't take fucking three weeks.

1707
00:55:01,179 --> 00:55:02,320
It doesn't take four weeks.

1708
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:03,219
It doesn't take, you know, a

1709
00:55:03,289 --> 00:55:03,809
fucking month.

1710
00:55:03,860 --> 00:55:04,639
It's pretty simple.

1711
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:05,519
So simple.

1712
00:55:05,559 --> 00:55:06,550
In fact, someone would say that,

1713
00:55:06,550 --> 00:55:07,300
that maybe isn't a client

1714
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:07,829
assumption.

1715
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:10,389
So guys, how did we do this?

1716
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:11,579
Let's recap real quick.

1717
00:55:12,579 --> 00:55:14,289
We spent time on crafting a good

1718
00:55:14,289 --> 00:55:15,440
creative brief.

1719
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:16,809
The way we get a good creative

1720
00:55:16,809 --> 00:55:18,500
brief is we have a good service.

1721
00:55:18,539 --> 00:55:20,539
Like that actually is good.

1722
00:55:20,579 --> 00:55:21,019
Okay.

1723
00:55:21,059 --> 00:55:23,750
We put all this information in one

1724
00:55:23,750 --> 00:55:26,079
consolidated document.

1725
00:55:26,119 --> 00:55:28,440
And then we provide a tool like

1726
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:31,510
Claude with that creative brief,

1727
00:55:31,519 --> 00:55:32,619
give it the framework.

1728
00:55:32,659 --> 00:55:33,760
It gives us this.

1729
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:35,199
We then go and edit it.

1730
00:55:35,239 --> 00:55:36,820
So we're at least 30% of the way

1731
00:55:36,820 --> 00:55:37,280
done.

1732
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:38,670
And it gives us a good, like solid

1733
00:55:38,670 --> 00:55:39,389
foundation.

1734
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:41,050
We can go and chip and refine it

1735
00:55:41,050 --> 00:55:42,159
as we keep going.

1736
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:43,829
And then boom, we edit it, add

1737
00:55:43,829 --> 00:55:45,420
everything that we need to, remove

1738
00:55:45,579 --> 00:55:46,230
whatever we don't,

1739
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:47,119
make it a little bit better here

1740
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:48,239
and there, bing, bang, boom.

1741
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:49,539
And now we got to finish script.

1742
00:55:49,579 --> 00:55:51,130
Now what we got to do is turn this

1743
00:55:51,130 --> 00:55:52,639
into a gamma doc and now go and

1744
00:55:53,090 --> 00:55:54,409
record an OBS video with it.

1745
00:55:54,460 --> 00:55:55,880
Ta-da, super easy.

1746
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:57,769
So hopefully that was useful for

1747
00:55:57,780 --> 00:55:58,519
you guys.

1748
00:55:58,559 --> 00:55:59,730
You may be watching this and being

1749
00:55:59,730 --> 00:56:00,829
a little bit intimidated.

1750
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:03,170
You'd be like, holy shit, Nick

1751
00:56:03,179 --> 00:56:05,320
just wrote a BSL script in under

1752
00:56:05,539 --> 00:56:06,269
an hour.

1753
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:07,460
I've never seen someone do that

1754
00:56:07,460 --> 00:56:07,920
before.

1755
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:09,039
Or holy crap.

1756
00:56:09,079 --> 00:56:10,570
Like I just, it doesn't seem like

1757
00:56:10,570 --> 00:56:12,309
I can write from that perspective.

1758
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:14,099
I don't really do all that well,

1759
00:56:14,099 --> 00:56:15,429
um, writing like that.

1760
00:56:15,659 --> 00:56:17,590
And guys, the thing is those, I've

1761
00:56:17,590 --> 00:56:19,500
been doing this for five years.

1762
00:56:19,559 --> 00:56:21,159
So of course you maybe won't be at

1763
00:56:21,159 --> 00:56:22,579
the same like level of competency

1764
00:56:23,079 --> 00:56:24,559
and being able to just write

1765
00:56:24,599 --> 00:56:25,320
straight from flow.

1766
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:26,530
Here's some tools I can recommend

1767
00:56:26,530 --> 00:56:27,500
to you that would help.

1768
00:56:27,559 --> 00:56:29,199
Number one.

1769
00:56:31,699 --> 00:56:33,730
Starbucks coffee, get a coffee,

1770
00:56:33,730 --> 00:56:35,940
nitro cold brew, caffeinate up.

1771
00:56:35,980 --> 00:56:36,809
It'll be a lot easier when you're

1772
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:37,320
caffeinated.

1773
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:40,309
Number two, just write.

1774
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:41,829
Like literally just write, just

1775
00:56:41,829 --> 00:56:42,400
sit down.

1776
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:43,480
You need to just set the time that

1777
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:44,449
I'm going to sit there and I'm

1778
00:56:44,449 --> 00:56:45,199
going to write.

1779
00:56:45,230 --> 00:56:46,139
I'm not going to get distracted.

1780
00:56:46,179 --> 00:56:47,780
No text, no Twitter, nothing else

1781
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:48,179
open.

1782
00:56:48,219 --> 00:56:49,639
All I'm doing is focusing on this.

1783
00:56:49,679 --> 00:56:50,880
And it'll be a lot easier when you

1784
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:51,880
have that and not constant

1785
00:56:51,889 --> 00:56:53,079
distractions feeding in.

1786
00:56:53,340 --> 00:56:54,849
So guys, if you just write and

1787
00:56:54,849 --> 00:56:56,460
caffeinate yourself, maybe a

1788
00:56:56,849 --> 00:56:58,190
little bit of nicotine as well.

1789
00:56:58,239 --> 00:56:59,590
Um, it'll be a lot easier for you

1790
00:56:59,610 --> 00:57:00,530
to get this done.

1791
00:57:00,579 --> 00:57:02,070
Don't compare yourself to me and

1792
00:57:02,070 --> 00:57:03,639
you may be as good as I am, right?

1793
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:04,670
Like a lot of you guys are

1794
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:05,659
copywriters as well.

1795
00:57:05,699 --> 00:57:06,860
You may be as good as I am, but

1796
00:57:06,860 --> 00:57:08,300
it's literally just about getting

1797
00:57:08,409 --> 00:57:08,719
it done.

1798
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:10,079
So you may take two hours.

1799
00:57:10,119 --> 00:57:11,159
You may take, you know, an hour

1800
00:57:11,159 --> 00:57:12,099
and a half, whatever.

1801
00:57:12,139 --> 00:57:12,719
It doesn't matter.

1802
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:14,110
The time doesn't matter.

1803
00:57:14,159 --> 00:57:15,409
What matters is we got something

1804
00:57:15,409 --> 00:57:15,980
good done.

1805
00:57:16,019 --> 00:57:18,019
We spent about actually 50% of our

1806
00:57:18,019 --> 00:57:19,849
time now on the creative brief and

1807
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:21,409
about 50% of our time on the

1808
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:21,840
script.

1809
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:22,400
Okay.

1810
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:23,699
So now the production really isn't

1811
00:57:23,699 --> 00:57:24,860
going to take us that long.

1812
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:25,840
It's actually super simple.

1813
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:27,500
So let's keep going.

1814
00:57:27,539 --> 00:57:29,230
So I'm going to go ahead and also

1815
00:57:29,230 --> 00:57:30,900
as well, it would probably be

1816
00:57:31,059 --> 00:57:32,980
longer with the creative brief.

1817
00:57:33,019 --> 00:57:35,050
Had I not known what my offer was

1818
00:57:35,050 --> 00:57:35,880
already.

1819
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:37,269
And had I not already sold this

1820
00:57:37,269 --> 00:57:38,619
multiple times to people and

1821
00:57:38,619 --> 00:57:40,309
already known how to provide it.

1822
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:41,769
So I probably would be closer to

1823
00:57:41,769 --> 00:57:44,300
like 70, 30 or 60, 40 right now,

1824
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:44,639
but.

1825
00:57:45,099 --> 00:57:45,880
That I already know what I'm doing

1826
00:57:46,019 --> 00:57:46,260
here.

1827
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:48,309
So let's take that into account.

1828
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:49,239
All right, you guys, that's

1829
00:57:49,289 --> 00:57:49,780
everything.

1830
00:57:49,820 --> 00:57:50,800
Let's now move on to the next

1831
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,039
section where we're going to turn

1832
00:57:52,039 --> 00:57:54,099
this into a gamma doc and record

1833
00:57:54,099 --> 00:57:54,500
it.

1834
00:57:54,539 --> 00:57:55,559
So bye-bye.
