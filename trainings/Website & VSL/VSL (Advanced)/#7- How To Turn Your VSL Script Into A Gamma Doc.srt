and i have as well you don't see

9
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:16,960
this though i have the gamma

10
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:17,890
open so we're going to start from

11
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:18,750

19
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:36,869
headline in a bit

40
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:18,950
it where some of them oops some of

41
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:20,769
them should be together like this

42
00:01:20,769 --> 00:01:23,680
one hey sound good that's fine why

43
00:01:23,719 --> 00:01:24,750
don't we not just like explain

44
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:25,790
this to you how to do it we don't

45
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:28,239
need to pause it so pause it again

46
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,260
or i'll uh split it again so you

47
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:32,480
can see hey i'm explaining this

48
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:35,840
section section by section

49
00:01:36,549 --> 00:01:40,750
all right and when i present what

50
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:42,959
it's going to look like is this

51
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:47,750
we'll have our headline and it'll

52
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:48,719
be us on the left side and the

53
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:49,989

your underperforming email list

59
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,480
into a powerhouse for engagement

video using my inbox intimacy

64
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,479
methodology i will craft emails

65
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,469
that sound like they came directly

66
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:12,919
from you

67
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:14,639
based on your content and in-depth

68
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:16,110
interviews that i'll conduct with

69
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:16,960
you personally

70
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,460
and if you don't see a substantial

71
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:19,500
increase in open rates

72
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,520
click-throughs and sales within 90

73
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,050
days

74
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,900
you pay nothing okay now see how

75
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,439
much better that looks and

76
00:02:25,539 --> 00:02:27,479
obviously you guys like the camera

77
00:02:27,569 --> 00:02:27,759
i need

78
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,069
to like adjust it so where i'm on

79
00:02:29,069 --> 00:02:30,409
the left side this is on the right

80
00:02:30,419 --> 00:02:32,080
side so on and so forth but like

81
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,729
guys this is so much text on

82
00:02:33,729 --> 00:02:35,699
screen i see people do gamma docs

83
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:37,590
like this where it's just like

84
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:39,050
it's just so much text i

85
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:41,129
personally don't like it i think

86
00:02:41,129 --> 00:02:43,520
that it's it's not good otherwise

87
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:43,840
you know

88
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:45,889
i i would do it myself but i don't

89
00:02:45,889 --> 00:02:47,930
so what i'm going to do now is i'm

90
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:49,819
going to go through and i'm

91
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,539
going to uh separate this out and

92
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:52,939
just do that real quick for each

93
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:54,639
one and then i'll come back and

94
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,389
show you what it looks like okay

95
00:02:56,389 --> 00:02:58,039
all righty so here we go didn't

96
00:02:58,069 --> 00:02:59,840
take much time at all for us to do

97
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,560
this

98
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:02,069
and so now you guys can see why

99
00:03:02,069 --> 00:03:03,569
don't i do this i'm going to show

100
00:03:03,669 --> 00:03:04,879
you guys in real time

101
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:06,750
what this will look like so if i

102
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:10,280
take me right here and i do this

103
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:16,000
and then i do this and then we do

104
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,479
this

105
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:20,000
yeah how do i do where it's like

106
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,879
that and then i want to do option

107
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:29,330
cut cut right there i am right

108
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,069
there hi how's it going nick virge

109
00:03:32,069 --> 00:03:34,719
here right and then i can go here

110
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:38,000
and then i'm going to take this

111
00:03:38,289 --> 00:03:43,590
and i go and i do this a little

112
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:47,180
bit of that a little bit of some

113
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:49,120
schwitz a little bit of some

114
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,759
schlamiel

115
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:55,669
a little bit less

116
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:04,370
so a little bit of that there we

117
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:05,039
go

118
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:08,520
okay and i would probably do it

119
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,949
where i make the background go do

120
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,800
this really quick

121
00:04:13,509 --> 00:04:16,860
color source okay we'll do a white

122
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:20,959
background okay put that behind

123
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:23,720
all this and then we'll change the

124
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:24,160
color

125
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:25,920
source select color we want it to

126
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,829
be i want to select the color uh

127
00:04:28,829 --> 00:04:32,240
you're making this difficult obs

128
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:37,639
okay and then what we'll do is

129
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:39,259
we'll do option get rid of the

130
00:04:39,259 --> 00:04:40,399
little purple thing

131
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:43,420
and then boom so now we have this

132
00:04:43,819 --> 00:04:46,060
right here and watch this so i'm

133
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,360
going to go back to my gamma doc

134
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:47,699
right here

135
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,959
hey i guarantee i can transform

136
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:54,319
your underperforming email list

137
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:56,800
into a powerhouse for engagement

138
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,750
conversions

139
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,560
and revenue growth inside your

140
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,779
info product business does that

141
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:03,589
sound good if so here's the 80 20

142
00:05:03,589 --> 00:05:03,779
of this

143
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:05,569
video using my inbox intimacy

144
00:05:05,569 --> 00:05:07,279
method i will craft emails that

145
00:05:07,339 --> 00:05:09,279
sound like they came directly from

146
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:09,600
you

147
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:11,959
based on your content and in-depth

148
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:14,360
interviews that i'll conduct with

149
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,399
you personally okay now if you

150
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:17,959
don't see a substantial increase

151
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:19,410
in open rates click-throughs and

152
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,279
sales the 90 days you pay nothing

153
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:22,860
now here's a couple questions i'd

154
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:24,269
like to ask you which will help

155
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:25,680
you know whether or not this

156
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,000
service

157
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,500
makes sense for you okay number

158
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,750
one are you an info product

159
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,959
business owner doing at least 100k

160
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:32,319
to 200k a month

161
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,290
selling high ticket items ranging

162
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:37,019
from 5 000 to 25 000 over the

163
00:05:37,019 --> 00:05:39,360
phone by leveraging a vsl book a

164
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:39,519
call

165
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,810
funnel and i'm just realizing now

166
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:41,910
that it's a little bit off the

167
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:43,120
screen so we need to fix that a

168
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:43,139
bit

169
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:45,329
right so we don't want to have

170
00:05:45,329 --> 00:05:47,810
that happening so we're just gonna

171
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:49,040
oh oops ctrl z no

172
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:51,649
make that go right now let's just

173
00:05:51,649 --> 00:05:54,360
run through this real quick let's

174
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,339
see do all of them

175
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,819
all right so we see that it fits

176
00:06:04,819 --> 00:06:07,600
on all them just want to make sure

177
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,439
and i would even recommend

178
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,939
making them all centered so it

179
00:06:10,939 --> 00:06:12,459
like looks congruent and i'll do

180
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,040
that at the end but let's be

181
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:15,399
honest do

182
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,189
you really want to do spend your

183
00:06:17,189 --> 00:06:19,060
time doing that okay so that's all

184
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:21,569
pretty good right and what i want

185
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:22,649
to do now is i maybe want to make

186
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:23,589
this look a little bit more

187
00:06:23,589 --> 00:06:24,660
appealing and i need to do a

188
00:06:25,019 --> 00:06:25,120
headline as

189
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,870
well and we'll talk about that

190
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:28,709
here in a moment so what i want to

191
00:06:28,709 --> 00:06:30,879
do is i want to center this stuff

192
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,350
and then what i'd like to do is

193
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:33,870
i'd like to add some form of like

194
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,120
graphics or something just so

195
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,269
it's not just like a white

196
00:06:36,269 --> 00:06:37,850
background and that's it so we can

197
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:39,759
do a white background that's fine

198
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,199
i'm going to do emojis because i

199
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:42,649
think emojis are great so i

200
00:06:42,649 --> 00:06:44,540
guarantee i can transform your

201
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,060
underperforming email list into a

202
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,250
powerhouse for engagement

203
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,709
conversions and revenue growth

204
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:49,689
so how are we going to do that

205
00:06:49,689 --> 00:06:50,769
well i could literally just do

206
00:06:50,769 --> 00:06:51,040
this

207
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,959
and then i can go and i can go

208
00:06:56,959 --> 00:07:11,600
this email and then

209
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,310
all right it does not look cute

210
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,519
and then if i make this centered

211
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:30,470
it'll probably look better

212
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:32,790
so i guarantee i can do that for

213
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:35,250
you and then we go to the next one

214
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:38,920
exit out of this

215
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:44,040
here's the 80 20 of this video

216
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:59,500
okay make this one

217
00:07:59,889 --> 00:08:02,579
okay

218
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,660
oh

219
00:08:06,379 --> 00:08:11,079
now what i want to do is i want to

220
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:12,560
go shift enter same thing here how

221
00:08:12,569 --> 00:08:13,300
can i do it where

222
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:16,300
it's up

223
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:26,240
up all right and i can do this

224
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:32,610
so now when i go and i present

225
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:33,759
this

226
00:08:33,798 --> 00:08:36,408
here's the 80 20 this video using

227
00:08:36,418 --> 00:08:38,480
my inbox intimacy method right and

228
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,519
if you don't see a substantial

229
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:40,769
increase in open rates

230
00:08:40,769 --> 00:08:42,538
click-throughs and sales in 90

231
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:44,399
days i will refund you in full

232
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,350
okay and then i'll

233
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:46,610
go and i'll do all the formatting

234
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:48,309
for it so you see how nice this

235
00:08:48,309 --> 00:08:49,789
can look right how straightforward

236
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:51,169
it can look and just easy and to

237
00:08:51,179 --> 00:08:53,460
the point um i just think it's the

238
00:08:53,629 --> 00:08:54,789
best way to go about doing

239
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,120
this there's not really much that

240
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,720
you need to do here okay um now i

241
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,840
could do the exact same thing

242
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,919
and do a loom so let's take big me

243
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:06,720
here and let's minimize me

244
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:09,710
into a little thing right here hi

245
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:10,960
everybody i'm really tiny

246
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,279
and then we'll make this

247
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:17,269
the full screen okay so let's just

248
00:09:17,269 --> 00:09:17,710
say

249
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:21,720
options so if we're going to do a

250
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,399
loom

251
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,240
we'll get the whole thing on here

252
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:31,000
right so it would be like that

253
00:09:31,059 --> 00:09:32,879
right and then we just

254
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:34,080
have to do it where we present

255
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,379
this in full screen so you can go

256
00:09:35,379 --> 00:09:36,309
right here and you can go

257
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,309
and hit present view and then you

258
00:09:39,309 --> 00:09:41,360
can make it full screen right so

259
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,960
now there's no tab right there

260
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,309
and we would literally just go up

261
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,580
here and we would hit our loom and

262
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,759
i could do my camera

263
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:51,309
as my face i'm just gonna do for

264
00:09:51,309 --> 00:09:53,120
the facetime camera and then boom

265
00:09:53,179 --> 00:09:55,259
you guys can't see it right

266
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,169
now because i have obs running but

267
00:09:57,169 --> 00:09:58,679
i could do a loom with this as

268
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:00,320
well okay but i think obs looks

269
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,570
better in almost all instances if

270
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:04,480
you're scared and nervous of

271
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,639
putting your face big like how i

272
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:06,960
did it

273
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,580
where it's half the screen do the

274
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,980
loom if not do the obs so that's

275
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:14,720
everything guys um i'm now gonna

276
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:17,309
go and finalize this and the last

277
00:10:17,309 --> 00:10:19,799
thing let me make me big again um

278
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:24,879
stop this make me big make me huge

279
00:10:24,919 --> 00:10:27,230
i'm now gonna go and i'm gonna

280
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,649
turn this into the final document

281
00:10:29,649 --> 00:10:30,710
and the next thing you're gonna

282
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:30,840
see

283
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,169
is me producing it okay this is so

284
00:10:33,169 --> 00:10:35,480
simple guys this isn't hard we got

285
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,470
this done in

286
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,389
a couple hours today nothing crazy

287
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:42,360
very straightforward not hard at

288
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:44,240
all right so

289
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:45,779
i personally think this is the

290
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:47,230
best route for you to be able to

291
00:10:47,309 --> 00:10:48,389
get this stuff done

292
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:50,340
efficiently is assume that it's

293
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,980
easy don't assume that it's

294
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:54,230
difficult so next thing you'll see

295
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:54,529
is now

296
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,529
me completing this i need to run

297
00:10:56,529 --> 00:10:58,580

298
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:01,259

now without this hat on so i need

300
00:11:03,419 --> 00:11:05,470
to run home real quick and uh do

301
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:06,960

wear a client ascension hat in my

303
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:11,190
