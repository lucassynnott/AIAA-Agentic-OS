1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,220
Alrighty guys, welcome back to the

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:03,850
next module where we're going to

3
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:05,459
be talking about how to craft and

4
00:00:05,459 --> 00:00:07,440
create a banger VSL for your B2B

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,560
service offer.

6
00:00:08,599 --> 00:00:10,130
So, let's not waste any time,

7
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:11,300
let's get started.

8
00:00:11,339 --> 00:00:13,109
And today, we're going to be

9
00:00:13,109 --> 00:00:15,000
talking about what you must do

10
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,780
before you write your VSL script

11
00:00:17,079 --> 00:00:18,629
and produce your VSL.

12
00:00:18,699 --> 00:00:19,980
Again guys, pretty much everyone

13
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:21,210
ignores this and that's why they

14
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:21,600
suck.

15
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,339
If you do this, it's going to be a

16
00:00:23,339 --> 00:00:24,989
hell of a lot easier for you to be

17
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:26,510
able to produce this VSL.

18
00:00:26,859 --> 00:00:27,910
It's going to be a hell of a lot

19
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:28,980
easier for you than produce

20
00:00:28,989 --> 00:00:30,320
marketing materials going forward

21
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:31,019
for yourself.

22
00:00:31,059 --> 00:00:32,609
And just in general, you're going

23
00:00:32,609 --> 00:00:33,979
to feel a lot more organized on

24
00:00:33,979 --> 00:00:35,350
what you're doing inside your

25
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:37,130
business, especially when it comes

26
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:38,350
to selling and marketing your

27
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:39,000
service.

28
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,630
So, what are we talking about?

29
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:41,850
Well, I'll tell you guys.

30
00:00:41,899 --> 00:00:43,490
It's a very common mistake.

31
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,520
Don't do this.

32
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,899
A lot of people try and go

33
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:47,649
straight to writing their VSL

34
00:00:47,649 --> 00:00:49,560
script before taking any time to

35
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,659
actually organize everything they

36
00:00:51,659 --> 00:00:53,380
need to craft a banger VSL.

37
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:54,439
Slow down, buckaroo.

38
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,850
Whoa, hey, whoa, we're not in a

39
00:00:55,909 --> 00:00:56,280
rush.

40
00:00:56,859 --> 00:00:57,259
All right.

41
00:00:57,299 --> 00:00:59,280
Here's the question, guys.

42
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:00,659
Are you trying to get this done?

43
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,020
Are you trying to get it done

44
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:02,520
right?

45
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:03,340
Okay.

46
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:04,719
Because just getting it done does

47
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:06,109
not necessarily translate into

48
00:01:06,109 --> 00:01:06,469
sales.

49
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:08,209
Just because you have a VSL on

50
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:10,069
your homepage or on your landing

51
00:01:10,359 --> 00:01:12,310
page does not mean you're going to

52
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:13,260
get sales.

53
00:01:13,299 --> 00:01:15,019
It's not an automatic, boom, there

54
00:01:15,019 --> 00:01:15,540
you go.

55
00:01:15,579 --> 00:01:16,140
You're going to get sales.

56
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:17,379
That's not how that works.

57
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:18,870
If you have a shitty VSL, I

58
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,670
guarantee you will not get sales.

59
00:01:20,819 --> 00:01:22,409
You want a good VSL.

60
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:25,079
And so, a good VSL is the right

61
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:25,609
VSL.

62
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:26,780
And the way you do that is by

63
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:28,099
listening to what I'm telling you

64
00:01:28,099 --> 00:01:28,780
to do today.

65
00:01:28,819 --> 00:01:29,109
Okay.

66
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,750
A lot of you are still not going

67
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:31,579
to listen to me.

68
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:32,890
And then you're going to come back

69
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:34,129
on the call and be like, oh, I

70
00:01:34,129 --> 00:01:35,379
don't know why I'm not booking

71
00:01:35,379 --> 00:01:35,799
calls.

72
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,819
And I'm like, how much time did

73
00:01:36,859 --> 00:01:37,659
you spend on your VSL?

74
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:38,629
How much time did you spend on

75
00:01:38,629 --> 00:01:39,780
your actual creative brief?

76
00:01:39,819 --> 00:01:40,540
Do you have a creative brief?

77
00:01:40,859 --> 00:01:42,200
Oh, I just spoiled it.

78
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:43,579
Well, let's just dive in, guys.

79
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,090
This is why we take the time to

80
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:46,650
create, drum roll please, a

81
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:48,239
creative brief, right?

82
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,079
This is the one thing that you

83
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,120
need to have.

84
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:52,760
If you don't have this, you're

85
00:01:52,849 --> 00:01:54,599
making it 10 times harder for

86
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,349
yourself to craft a good VSL.

87
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,200
Okay.

88
00:01:57,239 --> 00:01:59,010
The creative brief is the

89
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:01,500
organization of specific product

90
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,379
information, which allows us to be

91
00:02:04,379 --> 00:02:06,349
able to organize all the selling

92
00:02:06,349 --> 00:02:07,890
points we have and create a

93
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,580
hierarchy of messaging.

94
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:10,520
Okay.

95
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,539
So that's what I was talking about

96
00:02:11,539 --> 00:02:12,460
just a second ago is that you're

97
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:13,469
going to come and you're going to

98
00:02:13,469 --> 00:02:14,569
say, oh, man, like, oh, it's not

99
00:02:14,569 --> 00:02:15,120
working.

100
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:16,860
Like, no, it's not working.

101
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:17,800
And then I'm going to say, can I

102
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,800
see your creative brief?

103
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,719
I don't have one.

104
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:22,069
And I'm going to be like, that's

105
00:02:22,069 --> 00:02:23,580
why you're not getting any sales.

106
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,120
If you don't have a creative

107
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,139
brief, it's extremely hard for you

108
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:28,550
to be able to actually put

109
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:30,389
together an offer and messaging

110
00:02:30,389 --> 00:02:32,439
for that offer that's effective.

111
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:34,280
Creative briefs are what make it

112
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,780
very, very easy for you to be able

113
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:37,780
to craft effective messaging.

114
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:39,680
Because, again, they're the

115
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,860
organization of the messaging.

116
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,180
And so you're like, well, what is

117
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:44,039
a creative brief?

118
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:44,500
What is that?

119
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:45,259
Oh, great questions.

120
00:02:45,289 --> 00:02:45,860
I'm going to tell you.

121
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:46,870
Okay.

122
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,860
So writing an effective video

123
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,490
script, guys, isn't really all

124
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:52,159
that different from an attorney

125
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:53,400
speaking to the jury.

126
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:53,919
Right.

127
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,990
You're just stating an argument.

128
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:56,319
Think about that for a second.

129
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,889
When an attorney is trying to

130
00:02:58,889 --> 00:03:01,300
prove that his client is innocent,

131
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,319
he is stating an argument to the

132
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,639
jury, explaining to them why his

133
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:07,699
client is innocent or why, you

134
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,979
know, the defendant is guilty,

135
00:03:09,979 --> 00:03:11,340
whatever it is.

136
00:03:11,419 --> 00:03:11,780
Right.

137
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:13,139
He's stating an argument.

138
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:15,379
You selling your product or

139
00:03:15,469 --> 00:03:17,360
service to someone is stating an

140
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,409
argument and your argument has to

141
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,289
be so good that they believe you

142
00:03:21,289 --> 00:03:23,319
and that they decide to buy.

143
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:24,099
Okay.

144
00:03:24,379 --> 00:03:26,169
So if you want a good argument,

145
00:03:26,169 --> 00:03:28,139
you need to have all the facts.

146
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:30,159
Lawyers can't present to a jury

147
00:03:30,219 --> 00:03:32,060
when they don't have all the

148
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:32,740
facts.

149
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:33,830
If they don't have all the facts,

150
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:34,689
they're going to look like a

151
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:35,099
dummy.

152
00:03:35,139 --> 00:03:36,729
And you are the same way.

153
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:37,930
If you don't have all the facts,

154
00:03:37,939 --> 00:03:39,020
it's not going to look good.

155
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,020
It's not going to be a good VSL.

156
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:40,800
Okay.

157
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,370
So if you want a systematic

158
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:44,379
process for creation that you can

159
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:46,219
use, you need to transform the

160
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:48,129
chaos that's going on in your head

161
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:49,259
into order.

162
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:50,080
Okay.

163
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,819
So you having these ideas of like,

164
00:03:51,819 --> 00:03:53,610
well, the client thinks this, and

165
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:54,879
they also think this.

166
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:56,259
And on top of that, they also

167
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:57,250
believe in this.

168
00:03:57,319 --> 00:03:58,439
And this is their main problem.

169
00:03:58,479 --> 00:03:59,460
It's all up here.

170
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:00,120
Right.

171
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:00,900
That's chaos.

172
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,180
It's not like organized in any

173
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,199
way, shape or form.

174
00:04:03,419 --> 00:04:04,740
And I'll ask people specific

175
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:06,300
questions about their offer and

176
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,740
they just elaborate on it.

177
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:08,490
And I'm like, do you have this

178
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:09,259
written down anywhere?

179
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:09,819
No.

180
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:10,400
Okay.

181
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:11,180
That's a problem.

182
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,620
So the creative brief is the first

183
00:04:13,699 --> 00:04:16,170
step before we write a VSL, before

184
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:18,240
we write a script, before we

185
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,769
produce the VSL, before we put it

186
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:20,860
on our landing page, we need to

187
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:21,839
have a creative brief.

188
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:22,360
Okay.

189
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:24,129
And guys, if you've ever struggled

190
00:04:24,129 --> 00:04:25,519
to write, meaning that you're

191
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,180
going to probably in some way,

192
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:28,560
shape or form, some of you are

193
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:29,689
going to tell me, oh, I'm really

194
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:30,660
struggling to come up with the

195
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:31,209
right VSL script.

196
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:32,160
Like I don't know what to write

197
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:32,459
here.

198
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,000
Guys, lazy writing is really just

199
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,060
lazy research.

200
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:36,660
Okay.

201
00:04:36,699 --> 00:04:38,139
If you want to be able to write

202
00:04:38,139 --> 00:04:40,019
effortlessly for this, you need to

203
00:04:40,019 --> 00:04:41,740
do a good amount of research.

204
00:04:41,779 --> 00:04:42,360
Okay.

205
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:43,990
That's how you come up with a good

206
00:04:44,089 --> 00:04:45,180
offer for a market.

207
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:47,009
You're not just going to spin it

208
00:04:47,009 --> 00:04:48,339
up and it just happens.

209
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,209
It comes on the back end of a good

210
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:51,519
amount of research.

211
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:52,240
Okay.

212
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:54,259
So the unfair advantage that

213
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:56,569
everyone is looking for is on the

214
00:04:56,569 --> 00:04:59,120
other side of intense research.

215
00:04:59,589 --> 00:05:00,750
Okay.

216
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,430
So guys, if you want to be able to

217
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:03,709
make it really easy for you to

218
00:05:03,709 --> 00:05:05,310
write a banger VSL script, very

219
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:06,980
simply, just do a good amount of

220
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:08,810
research, understand your market

221
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:10,259
inside and out, and it'll be

222
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:11,800
really easy for you to be able to

223
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:13,480
craft a banger VSL script.

224
00:05:13,949 --> 00:05:14,569
Okay.

225
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:15,959
So let's keep moving on.

226
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,790
So here's some advice for you

227
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:19,870
putting together a VSL script and

228
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,959
specifically the creative brief

229
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:23,480
for your VSL script.

230
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,649
You should put a lot of time into

231
00:05:25,649 --> 00:05:26,899
the creative brief.

232
00:05:26,939 --> 00:05:27,230
Okay.

233
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:29,079
I've been telling you guys that it

234
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:30,439
is probably about a day or two

235
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:32,189
that you can spend on a VSL.

236
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:33,870
60% of the time should be on the

237
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:34,860
creative brief.

238
00:05:34,899 --> 00:05:36,800
It's not hard.

239
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:38,819
It's, it's, it's, it's not hard to

240
00:05:38,819 --> 00:05:39,600
put together a VSL.

241
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,959
It's getting all the information

242
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:41,949
and getting all the facts

243
00:05:41,949 --> 00:05:42,540
straight.

244
00:05:42,579 --> 00:05:43,220
That is hard.

245
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:44,509
And you have to actually put

246
00:05:44,509 --> 00:05:46,129
effort and time into accumulating

247
00:05:46,129 --> 00:05:47,959
those facts and that information.

248
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,579
It may come from client research

249
00:05:49,579 --> 00:05:50,100
calls.

250
00:05:50,139 --> 00:05:51,680
If you have previous clients, you

251
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,149
can call and talk to, it may come

252
00:05:53,149 --> 00:05:54,730
from doing market research and it

253
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:56,189
may come from reverse engineering

254
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,360
other people's offers.

255
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:58,079
Right.

256
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:58,930
And seeing what's wrong with their

257
00:05:58,949 --> 00:05:59,819
stuff and what are they doing?

258
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:00,579
How can I do it differently?

259
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:01,420
And so on and so forth.

260
00:06:01,889 --> 00:06:02,720
Right.

261
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:03,990
So guys, this is going to be where

262
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:05,089
you spend the majority of your

263
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:06,250
time doing the research.

264
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,279
It should not be spent on writing

265
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:08,199
and it should not be spent on

266
00:06:08,209 --> 00:06:08,779
production.

267
00:06:08,819 --> 00:06:09,699
Those are all very simple,

268
00:06:09,699 --> 00:06:10,699
especially with the fact that

269
00:06:10,699 --> 00:06:11,899
we're writing a five to 10 minute

270
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:12,310
script.

271
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,480
Like guys, 40% of your time should

272
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,329
be spent on the actual creation of

273
00:06:16,329 --> 00:06:18,180
the thing on writing and on actual

274
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,129
production.

275
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,509
60% of your time should be spent

276
00:06:20,509 --> 00:06:21,160
on research.

277
00:06:21,629 --> 00:06:22,170
Okay.

278
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,110
So the more time you do put in,

279
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:26,360
the better results you're going to

280
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:26,920
see.

281
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:27,920
Okay.

282
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:29,410
But you don't want to put in so

283
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:31,019
much time into it that you never

284
00:06:31,019 --> 00:06:31,939
take action.

285
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:32,180
Okay.

286
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:33,620
I've seen people spend like a

287
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:35,290
month plus on a creative brief and

288
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:36,839
it's just, that's so dumb.

289
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:37,970
Don't do that.

290
00:06:38,019 --> 00:06:39,000
Get it done.

291
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:40,930
You should block this out for the

292
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:42,040
next day or two.

293
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:43,060
This should be the only things

294
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,120
that you focus on is getting a

295
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,170
creative brief and a VSL script

296
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:45,740
written.

297
00:06:45,779 --> 00:06:47,269
You can even produce after that,

298
00:06:47,269 --> 00:06:48,509
but I would, I would highly

299
00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:49,759
recommend doing that.

300
00:06:49,819 --> 00:06:50,420
Okay.

301
00:06:50,459 --> 00:06:51,579
Set a deadline.

302
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,100
This thing can take forever to

303
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,439
complete if you let it.

304
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,259
And so we don't want to let it

305
00:06:55,259 --> 00:06:55,810
take forever.

306
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:56,670
What is that?

307
00:06:57,009 --> 00:06:57,459
Parkinson's law.

308
00:06:57,639 --> 00:06:58,800
Usually it's like the amount of

309
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:00,019
time that we allow something to

310
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,300
take up is usually how long it'll

311
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:01,600
take.

312
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:03,529
Set a deadline one day, two days,

313
00:07:03,529 --> 00:07:04,759
something like that.

314
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:05,639
Okay.

315
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,290
So how do you build a creative

316
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:09,129
brief?

317
00:07:09,259 --> 00:07:10,139
That's a great question.

318
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,759
There are going to be templates

319
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,129
down below or wherever the

320
00:07:13,129 --> 00:07:14,959
resources section is for this.

321
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,939
I just hand everything off to

322
00:07:15,939 --> 00:07:17,060
Andre and he handles everything

323
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,100
else, but there's going to be some

324
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:19,600
templates where I'll show you

325
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,600
actually how to do the creative

326
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,259
brief.

327
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:22,730
Okay.

328
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,670
And I'm also going to have a demo

329
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:25,980
video where I show you how to

330
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:26,660
write it.

331
00:07:26,689 --> 00:07:27,509
I'm going to go through and I'm

332
00:07:27,509 --> 00:07:28,300
going to do one with you.

333
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,449
Like I said, I'm going to do one

334
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:30,509
with you so you can see this is

335
00:07:30,509 --> 00:07:31,600
plausible for you to do it in one

336
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:32,019
day.

337
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:32,870
Okay.

338
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,709
So that's what I'm going to do

339
00:07:33,709 --> 00:07:34,579
with you in the demo video.

340
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,399
And then also you guys are going

341
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:36,139
to get templates for it.

342
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,079
So that is everything that you

343
00:07:38,149 --> 00:07:39,250
need to know.

344
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:39,860
Okay.

345
00:07:39,899 --> 00:07:41,490
Guys, creative brief is the first

346
00:07:41,589 --> 00:07:41,959
step.

347
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,439
Do not skip this step.

348
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,759
Get this organized.

349
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,060
Get all your facts straight.

350
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,259
It's going to be a lot easier for

351
00:07:47,269 --> 00:07:48,339
you to then move into the next

352
00:07:48,339 --> 00:07:49,259
stage, which is actually writing

353
00:07:49,459 --> 00:07:50,769
the VSL script when you have all

354
00:07:50,769 --> 00:07:51,920
of your facts and all of your

355
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,050
information straight.

356
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,689
So let's go ahead and let's dive

357
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:56,220
into the actual demo and producing

358
00:07:56,839 --> 00:07:58,060
the creative brief.

359
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,129
And then from there, we'll dive

360
00:07:59,139 --> 00:08:00,160
into actually writing the VSL

361
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:00,600
script.

362
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:01,980
So that's everything, guys.

363
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:02,800
All the best.

364
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:03,519
Bye now.
