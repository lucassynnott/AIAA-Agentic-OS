1
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:04,650
Nice hey if you're a business

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:06,309
owner that sells a high ticket

3
00:00:06,309 --> 00:00:07,839
product ranging from three

4
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:08,240
thousand

5
00:00:08,259 --> 00:00:09,890
to ten thousand dollars and you're

6
00:00:10,189 --> 00:00:11,000
already doing about a hundred

7
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:12,330
grand or more a month

8
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:13,769
i'd like to share with you an

9
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:15,480
email strategy that mimics what

10
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,940
people like alex hermosi

11
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,339
sam ovens and even gary v are all

12
00:00:19,339 --> 00:00:21,660
talking about so if you want to

13
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,679
have a super loyal following

14
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:25,839
just like them listen up now this

15
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:27,649
definitely goes against what

16
00:00:27,859 --> 00:00:29,679
pretty much everyone else

17
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:31,190
is recommending when it comes to

18
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:32,880
email marketing and that's because

19
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,600
i prefer to focus on long-term

20
00:00:34,619 --> 00:00:36,149
thinking while everyone else is

21
00:00:36,549 --> 00:00:37,700
focused on short-term thinking

22
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,240
kind of like investing so here's

23
00:00:40,299 --> 00:00:42,229
the main point of this video your

24
00:00:42,229 --> 00:00:43,740
email list should not be a

25
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:46,200
short-term investment for you it

26
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:46,579
should be

27
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,619
a long-term investment you've got

28
00:00:48,619 --> 00:00:50,429
to think long-term with it guys

29
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:52,659
because the people you're emailing

30
00:00:52,659 --> 00:00:52,820
on

31
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,420
your list aren't ready to buy

32
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,060
right now right well what most

33
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:57,539
people recommend doing is

34
00:00:57,549 --> 00:00:58,539
basically pitching

35
00:00:58,579 --> 00:01:00,310
them over and over and over and

36
00:01:00,509 --> 00:01:02,259
over again until they are ready to

37
00:01:02,259 --> 00:01:04,709
buy now does that work sure but

38
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:06,689
here's the question most people

39
00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:08,719
don't ask what's that costing you

40
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:10,579
here's i'd like you to do go to

41
00:01:10,599 --> 00:01:12,680
your email service platform active

42
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,629
campaign hubspot or whatever and

43
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,420
put a filter on it to see how many

44
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:17,840
inactive subscribers you have

45
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,390
meaning people who haven't opened

46
00:01:19,489 --> 00:01:21,599
your emails in the last 30 days or

47
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:21,799
so

48
00:01:21,819 --> 00:01:23,430
right then take that number and

49
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,109
multiply it by your average cost

50
00:01:25,109 --> 00:01:26,879
per lead that you're seeing on

51
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:27,340
platforms

52
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:28,709
like high rose or your facebook

53
00:01:28,709 --> 00:01:29,870
ads or youtube ads okay two

54
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:31,340
dollars five dollars ten dollars

55
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:32,030
whatever it

56
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:33,540
is multiply those two numbers

57
00:01:33,989 --> 00:01:35,219
together and that's how much this

58
00:01:35,219 --> 00:01:36,760
strategy has cost you thus far

59
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:38,500
because realistically you could

60
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:40,140
have probably cut that number of

61
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,909
inactive subscribers down by at

62
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:42,140
least

63
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:43,719
half had you followed the strategy

64
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:45,010
i'm about to lay out for you in

65
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,319
this video no one can have a

66
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:46,760
hundred percent

67
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:48,780
active subscribers right okay so

68
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,430
the best way for me to explain

69
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:52,379
this strategy to use like this

70
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:53,799
you've got a mailbox right a

71
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:55,569
physical mailbox at your house you

72
00:01:55,569 --> 00:01:57,099
go and check your mail at your

73
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:57,379
house

74
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,780
or your apartment or wherever you

75
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,129
live and you take the mail out you

76
00:02:00,129 --> 00:02:01,719
split it into two categories right

77
00:02:01,739 --> 00:02:02,989
you have the mail that you're

78
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:04,359
actually going to open and then

79
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:05,629
you have the mail that you're

80
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:06,060
going to

81
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:07,549
throw away okay so the mail that

82
00:02:07,549 --> 00:02:09,159
you're throwing away that's kind

83
00:02:09,159 --> 00:02:10,780
of like the emails that land in

84
00:02:10,819 --> 00:02:10,919
your

85
00:02:10,939 --> 00:02:12,469
spam or promo tab they never get

86
00:02:12,849 --> 00:02:14,120
opened anyways you got your pile

87
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,599
of mail that you should open

88
00:02:15,659 --> 00:02:17,039
because it looks important right

89
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:19,319
so what happens is that sometimes

90
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:21,199
you open a letter and you go ah

91
00:02:21,219 --> 00:02:22,530
it's just a pitch you thought it

92
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:23,870
was important but it's actually

93
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:25,560
not so you toss in the trash right

94
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:27,319
well the emails you're sending

95
00:02:27,509 --> 00:02:29,169
your customers are no different

96
00:02:29,169 --> 00:02:31,080
than that they open the email

97
00:02:31,099 --> 00:02:32,879
read it see it's a pitch exit and

98
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:34,699
after enough times of repeating

99
00:02:34,699 --> 00:02:36,259
that process they leave right

100
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,580
they unsubscribe or they stop

101
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:38,990
opening it you end up in promos

102
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:40,199
they don't open your emails

103
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:40,500
anymore

104
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,819
well what most people are doing

105
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:43,310
inside of their email marketing is

106
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:44,580
just trying to squeeze as

107
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:46,280
as much profit as possible in as

108
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:48,139
short of a time frame as possible

109
00:02:48,139 --> 00:02:50,189
now look this tactic can work

110
00:02:50,259 --> 00:02:51,569
right it can make money it's a

111
00:02:51,569 --> 00:02:52,909
volume game if you're getting

112
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,080
10,000 new leads every single

113
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:55,580
month inside

114
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:56,900
of your email list from people

115
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,250
that didn't buy or didn't book a

116
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:59,520
call from you from your funnel

117
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:00,219
it's

118
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,699
pretty easy for you to be able to

119
00:03:01,699 --> 00:03:03,379
use automations and campaigns and

120
00:03:03,379 --> 00:03:04,819
be able to squeeze out you know

121
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,419
10 20 sales out of it right that's

122
00:03:07,419 --> 00:03:09,500
great works super well but here's

123
00:03:09,509 --> 00:03:11,259
a question for you do you think

124
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,620
that the people on your list are

125
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:14,129
stupid seriously do you think that

126
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,580
they forgot about the fact that

127
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,319
you're selling them something and

128
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,819
that they don't know how to you

129
00:03:18,819 --> 00:03:20,479
know go to your website or to your

130
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,479
funnel and book a call you don't

131
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:24,569
believe that right well then why

132
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:26,780
do you keep hounding them every

133
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:27,280
single

134
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,030
email book a call book a call book

135
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:30,580
a call book a call look i'm not

136
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,520
saying you shouldn't ever pitch

137
00:03:32,539 --> 00:03:33,960
your email list what i'm

138
00:03:34,469 --> 00:03:35,960
suggesting is to actually try and

139
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,949
form a real relationship with the

140
00:03:37,949 --> 00:03:38,159
people

141
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:39,810
subscribe to your newsletter see i

142
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:41,319
have a different belief on where

143
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:42,870
the industry is going right now

144
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:43,139
we've

145
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:44,909
had this race to profits over the

146
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:46,680
last four or five years inside of

147
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,240
the info product industry

148
00:03:48,259 --> 00:03:50,080
but now where we're going is a

149
00:03:50,189 --> 00:03:52,000
race to the relationship people

150
00:03:52,409 --> 00:03:53,759
are buying from the person

151
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,250
that they trust the most see

152
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:57,080
people have a natural resistance

153
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,979
to a sales process because people

154
00:03:58,979 --> 00:03:59,159
don't

155
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:00,599
want to be sold guys they love

156
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:02,280
buying things but they hate being

157
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,979
sold things because people don't

158
00:04:03,979 --> 00:04:04,289
like

159
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:05,979
the pressure of having to buy

160
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:07,810
something right then and there

161
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:09,860
this is where long-term thinking

162
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:10,379
comes into

163
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,490
play if we focus first on creating

164
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:14,750
an emotional relationship with the

165
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:17,199
person creating an actual bond an

166
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:18,629
intimate bond with that person

167
00:04:18,629 --> 00:04:19,990
over the course of time you're

168
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:21,579
going to get more sales than that

169
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,259
pray and spray pitch pitch pitch

170
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:25,139
methodology because the people who

171
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:26,420
would have bought from

172
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:28,230
that needy methodology will still

173
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:29,829
buy from you using this way more

174
00:04:29,829 --> 00:04:31,550
intimate style of email marketing

175
00:04:31,579 --> 00:04:32,850
and on top of that you're not

176
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:34,410
causing people to get annoyed and

177
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:35,500
drop off your list they're

178
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:36,019
actually

179
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,490
still going to open your emails

180
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:39,089
and chances are over the long term

181
00:04:39,089 --> 00:04:40,519
a lot of those people can turn

182
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:40,680
into

183
00:04:40,699 --> 00:04:42,360
buyers so most people should be

184
00:04:42,629 --> 00:04:44,230
running their email list like this

185
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:46,220
but they're not so why is that

186
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,579
outside of them maybe not even

187
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:49,110
understanding this well there's

188
00:04:49,269 --> 00:04:51,350
two reasons i can think of one is

189
00:04:51,379 --> 00:04:51,600
that

190
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:53,079
most of the copywriters and

191
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:55,019
marketers managing email lists are

192
00:04:55,019 --> 00:04:56,889
not even capable of writing types

193
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:57,060
of

194
00:04:57,079 --> 00:04:59,160
emails that build intimacy most of

195
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,740
them have zero eq whatsoever

196
00:05:00,899 --> 00:05:03,079
they're absolutely awful at being

197
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:03,230
able

198
00:05:03,259 --> 00:05:04,730
to connect with people on an

199
00:05:05,189 --> 00:05:06,209
emotional level they don't

200
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:08,139
understand people they don't know

201
00:05:08,139 --> 00:05:08,660
the triggers

202
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,860
that get people to actually want

203
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:11,100
to create an intimate relationship

204
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,779
with you and most of the time

205
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,350
they're not writing from your

206
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:15,920
personal experience they're

207
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,600
writing solely off of theoretical

208
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,259
concepts

209
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:19,879
they'll take some concept let's

210
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:21,439
say it's like how a house is made

211
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:22,899
and let's say you have a coaching

212
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,019
program where you're teaching

213
00:05:24,019 --> 00:05:25,160
people how to build an amazon fba

214
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,139
business right so what the email

215
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,620
copywriter goes and does is he's

216
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,050

business

219
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,870
and how that is just like building

220
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:36,220
a house super lame guys people

221
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:38,720
don't want to read that they want

222
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:38,839
to

223
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,009
read about how when you started

224
00:05:40,009 --> 00:05:41,160
your business you had a hundred

225
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,839
dollars to your name but you knew

226
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,000
you

227
00:05:43,019 --> 00:05:44,379
could make it work they want to

228
00:05:44,379 --> 00:05:45,920
hear about that cold lonely night

229
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:47,480
when you slept in your car because

230
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,079
you got evicted from your place

231
00:05:49,329 --> 00:05:50,689
they want to hear about the time

232
00:05:50,689 --> 00:05:52,470
you cried having to tell your kids

233
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,370
that you couldn't get them

234
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:54,600
christmas presents because you had

235
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,019
no money they want to hear about

236
00:05:56,019 --> 00:05:56,170
the

237
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,420
first ten thousand dollars you

238
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:58,490
made and where you went to go

239
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:01,040
spend that money people want to

240
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,300
hear

241
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:03,389
about real stuff your experience

242
00:06:03,389 --> 00:06:05,060
your story that's what everyone

243
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,100
wants to hear and i believe

244
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:07,509
everyone

245
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:08,980
has a story that's worth telling

246
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,180
and that's what creates an

247
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:11,319
intimate connection not

248
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:12,649
theoretical concepts

249
00:06:12,699 --> 00:06:14,079
in an email so the other reason

250
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:15,649
people aren't implementing this

251
00:06:15,769 --> 00:06:17,240
style of newsletter is because

252
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:17,740
they feel

253
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:18,810
like they have to go and write

254
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:20,009
these types of emails they can't

255
00:06:20,009 --> 00:06:21,290
have someone else write them for

256
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:21,439
them

257
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,949
right i mean but you're a business

258
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:24,379
owner you don't got time for that

259
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:25,800
you have coaching calls you have

260
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:26,939
all sorts of meetings you have

261
00:06:26,949 --> 00:06:28,029
your life and a million other

262
00:06:28,029 --> 00:06:29,310
things that you have to do right

263
00:06:29,339 --> 00:06:30,670
you don't have time to be writing

264
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:32,079
a newsletter every single morning

265
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:33,410
or every single night or whatever

266
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,350
it is well that's exactly why i

267
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:37,629
started inbox intimacy this is a

sort

289
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,290
of limiting beliefs you have when

290
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:08,399
you were first getting started

291
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:09,600
what you thought was true but

292
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,079
later found

293
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,470
out was false all types of

294
00:07:12,029 --> 00:07:13,379
questions like that we're going to

295
00:07:13,379 --> 00:07:14,959

00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,519
understand you i'm also going to

298
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:17,939
go through the material inside of

299
00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:19,170
your program and understand the

300
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:20,339
different concepts you're

301
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:21,620
explaining and ask you questions

302
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:22,699

00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:30,959
which are then sent to your

309
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:32,470
audience and without a doubt the

310
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,860
emails are going to sound just

311
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,379
like you

312
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,310

314
00:07:38,069 --> 00:07:39,899
jordan belford caitlin jenner

315
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,569
all these different personalities

316
00:07:41,569 --> 00:07:42,819
i've been able to nail all of

317
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:44,779
their voices so i guarantee you

318
00:07:44,779 --> 00:07:45,300
that i can nail

319
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:46,870
what you're going to do so i'm

320
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:48,540
kind of a chameleon like that so

321
00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:49,620
here's the thing what i'm

322
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:49,620
explaining

323
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:50,759
right now is not for the

324
00:07:50,769 --> 00:07:52,490
short-sighted person this is for

325
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:53,959
the person who's focused on a

326
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:54,660
long-term

327
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,949
vision it's for the person that

328
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:57,060
actually wants to build an

329
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,560
intimate relationship with their

330
00:07:58,829 --> 00:07:58,899
email

331
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,519
list and they know that this is

332
00:08:00,779 --> 00:08:01,939
what's going to be the most

333
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:03,939
profitable decision they can make

334
00:08:03,939 --> 00:08:04,019
in

335
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,649
