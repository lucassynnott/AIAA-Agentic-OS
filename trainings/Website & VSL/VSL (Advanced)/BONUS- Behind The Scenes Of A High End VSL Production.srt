1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:02,069
Alrighty guys, welcome back.

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:03,259
So we are in the production side

3
00:00:03,259 --> 00:00:03,669
of things.

4
00:00:03,669 --> 00:00:04,839
So I'm gonna be filming a VSL

5
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:07,000
today and I figured it would

6
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,189
actually just be best to literally

7
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:11,269
just show you guys how I film.

8
00:00:11,269 --> 00:00:12,539
I'm in my office right now and you

9
00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:13,890
can see I'm like, I'm just showing

10
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:15,359
you kind of the setup that I have.

11
00:00:15,429 --> 00:00:17,190
But I want to show you from start

12
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:18,940
to finish how I would just set up

13
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:19,500
a set.

14
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:21,070
Okay, so there's two types of VSLs

15
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:21,820
you can shoot.

16
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:23,449
I mean, actually, there's endless

17
00:00:23,449 --> 00:00:24,870
types of VSLs you can shoot, but

18
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:26,530
I'm only gonna be teaching two.

19
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,219
Not four, that's four.

20
00:00:28,219 --> 00:00:28,699
This is two.

21
00:00:28,699 --> 00:00:29,739
So two of them.

22
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:32,179
So we have a direct camera just

23
00:00:32,179 --> 00:00:34,670
seated or you can be standing, but

24
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,240
I prefer seated.

25
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,609
Just so you can mess up a lot.

26
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:40,710
And so, you know, you want to have

27
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:42,600
plenty of wiggle room and not be

28
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,000
tired on your feet.

29
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:44,929
And then all of a sudden, like,

30
00:00:44,929 --> 00:00:46,000
you know, it's an hour long shoot.

31
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:46,929
You're standing on your feet for

32
00:00:46,929 --> 00:00:47,240
an hour.

33
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,229
Hey, you don't want that.

34
00:00:48,259 --> 00:00:49,500
So I prefer sitting.

35
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,060
So I'll show you guys how to do a

36
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,640
D2C direct camera D2C.

37
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,009
And then I'm gonna show you as

38
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:57,689
well how to do a just more casual

39
00:00:57,710 --> 00:00:58,619
style.

40
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:01,020
I call it Frank Kern VSL.

41
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:02,479
He was the first one that I saw

42
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:03,859
doing this where rather than

43
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:05,180
having this very professional

44
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:06,569
setup, he just kept it super

45
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:07,209
casual.

46
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:08,719
It'd be like him in front of in

47
00:01:08,769 --> 00:01:10,469
his office, just on his iPhone,

48
00:01:10,469 --> 00:01:12,260
holding it like selfie style.

49
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:13,760
And so I'll show you guys how to

50
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,719
do that as well.

51
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:16,760
So let's, let's just get started.

52
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,129
I'm going to kind of break

53
00:01:18,129 --> 00:01:19,950
everything down for you guys.

54
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:22,379
So what we have right here is the

55
00:01:22,379 --> 00:01:24,599
camera, but we're not going to use

56
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:26,079
this camera today.

57
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:29,140
The reason why is because normally

58
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:32,060
what we're doing is we are putting

59
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:34,400
a teleprompter hood on this and

60
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,510
then we're going to have this

61
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:36,969
phone as a teleprompter.

62
00:01:37,569 --> 00:01:38,909
And he, well, there's a few

63
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:39,430
things.

64
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:41,269
One, I can't like film this and

65
00:01:41,269 --> 00:01:43,049
then at the same time having the

66
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:44,579
teleprompter hood.

67
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:46,099
Um, so I was like, that doesn't

68
00:01:46,099 --> 00:01:47,140
make much sense.

69
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:50,349
Um, but also, um, I want to show

70
00:01:50,349 --> 00:01:51,689
you guys how to just do it with

71
00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:53,269
your phone because I'm trying to

72
00:01:53,299 --> 00:01:54,560
give you guys a cost effective way

73
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,000
to do this.

74
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:57,739
Not everyone has the benefit of

75
00:01:57,739 --> 00:02:01,480
having a $1,500, uh, purely video

76
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,409
camera.

77
00:02:02,409 --> 00:02:03,319
That's just really good at

78
00:02:03,489 --> 00:02:04,430
shooting video, right?

79
00:02:04,549 --> 00:02:05,219
Not everyone has that.

80
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:07,879
So I'm going to package this up.

81
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,400
Um, and I'm going to put this away

82
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,280
for now because we did not need to

83
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:13,370
have this in it.

84
00:02:13,389 --> 00:02:14,569
And you know what?

85
00:02:14,569 --> 00:02:16,599
This actually may be, oops, this

86
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:18,349
is going, this may be a really

87
00:02:18,349 --> 00:02:20,509
good, uh, background prop for what

88
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,330
we're doing.

89
00:02:21,509 --> 00:02:23,560
So, you know, we could literally

90
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,479
stick it up on the desk just like

91
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:26,639
this, right?

92
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:30,259
And boom, is that going to look a

93
00:02:30,259 --> 00:02:31,259
little dumb?

94
00:02:31,259 --> 00:02:31,759
Probably.

95
00:02:31,789 --> 00:02:32,740
So I'm not going to put that

96
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:33,120
there.

97
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,139
Actually, I'm going to go ahead

98
00:02:34,139 --> 00:02:35,240
and not use it as a prompt.

99
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,370
It was like the idea, the concept

100
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:39,120
of it sounded good, but the

101
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,879
execution was negative.

102
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:43,189
So I'm going to put this one away.

103
00:02:43,189 --> 00:02:44,759
Okay.

104
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:50,300
And now what we need to do, let's

105
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,560
turn this around and let's like,

106
00:02:52,569 --> 00:02:54,740
let's lower this.

107
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:55,379
There you go.

108
00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:56,550
So what we have right here is my

109
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:57,150
lighting.

110
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:58,780
So there's a reason why I picked

111
00:02:58,780 --> 00:02:59,759
this exact one.

112
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:02,479
So you can go, um, on Amazon and

113
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:04,639
you can buy these types of lights

114
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:05,860
right here, right?

115
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:06,719
Like these are the standard

116
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:07,099
lights.

117
00:03:07,099 --> 00:03:07,780
Everyone buys.

118
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,229
When you look up photography

119
00:03:09,229 --> 00:03:11,379
lighting, um, these are the lights

120
00:03:11,379 --> 00:03:12,129
that come up, right?

121
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,490
These are hard lights.

122
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,699
This is a soft light.

123
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:16,439
You can convert a hard light into

124
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:17,370
a soft light.

125
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:18,599
They have kits for it.

126
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:21,110
Um, I just went ahead and I got

127
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:21,939
the best.

128
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:23,750
I don't like cheaping out on

129
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,639
equipment and I spend quite a bit

130
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:27,139
of time in production.

131
00:03:27,139 --> 00:03:29,020
So it's useful for me to have just

132
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,539
the equipment, right?

133
00:03:30,539 --> 00:03:32,300
Like I don't, I don't, I don't

134
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,889
need to, uh, I don't need to cheap

135
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:35,689
out.

136
00:03:35,719 --> 00:03:37,439
And so I was like, I'll just get

137
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:38,060
the best one.

138
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,129
So, you know, these aren't bad,

139
00:03:40,129 --> 00:03:42,330
um, but they are a very hard

140
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:43,139
light.

141
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,680
And so what you'll notice is that

142
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,400
when you're filming, you're going

143
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,139
to have these shadows underneath

144
00:03:48,139 --> 00:03:51,090
your eyes on your, on your nose,

145
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:52,539
on your lips and your face.

146
00:03:52,539 --> 00:03:53,770
Like they'll just have shadows on

147
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:54,120
it.

148
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,469
And because you know, I'm, if you

149
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:58,560
guys can observe closely, I'm

150
00:03:58,569 --> 00:04:00,699
Slavic as fuck, like super Jewish

151
00:04:01,009 --> 00:04:02,090
and European.

152
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:04,930
I get a big nose shadow and eye

153
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:06,139
shadows.

154
00:04:06,139 --> 00:04:07,139
Cause I got this freaking like,

155
00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:09,050
look how far in the sockets, my

156
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:10,139
eyeballs are.

157
00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:11,909
So, you know, I, uh, I have

158
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,090
interesting facial features.

159
00:04:14,189 --> 00:04:15,199
So I don't like the hard lights

160
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:16,129
for that exact reason.

161
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:18,699
So instead I'm actually going to

162
00:04:18,699 --> 00:04:21,060
use this as kind of like a stand

163
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,139
and no, this is weird.

164
00:04:23,139 --> 00:04:25,050
This isn't the conventional use of

165
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:26,699
this and my backpack out of the

166
00:04:26,769 --> 00:04:27,120
way.

167
00:04:27,129 --> 00:04:28,680
Um, but I'm going to do it this

168
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,139
way.

169
00:04:29,139 --> 00:04:31,920
So what I want to do is I want to

170
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,970
use for my backdrop, these guys

171
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,089
right here.

172
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:38,329
So I like these, these are good

173
00:04:38,329 --> 00:04:39,139
for now.

174
00:04:39,149 --> 00:04:40,790
So I'm definitely going to buy a

175
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:42,240
higher end replacement.

176
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:44,139
Um, but these are good for now.

177
00:04:44,139 --> 00:04:46,329
These are a thing called sunlight

178
00:04:46,329 --> 00:04:46,949
lamps.

179
00:04:46,949 --> 00:04:49,009
Um, and so what you can see, and

180
00:04:49,009 --> 00:04:51,139
I'll show you guys right now is

181
00:04:51,139 --> 00:04:55,139
I'm going to plug in from a USB.

182
00:04:55,139 --> 00:04:56,569
You just turn it on.

183
00:04:56,569 --> 00:04:56,949
Okay.

184
00:04:57,399 --> 00:04:59,509
And so I'm going to turn off the

185
00:04:59,769 --> 00:05:02,449
lights and I'm going to turn you

186
00:05:02,449 --> 00:05:04,139
guys over here.

187
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:05,480
So you can see, Hey, get out of

188
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,240
the way, Mr.

189
00:05:06,259 --> 00:05:07,129
Microphone.

190
00:05:07,149 --> 00:05:08,290
You can see what it looks like.

191
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:09,120
Kind of cool, right?

192
00:05:09,129 --> 00:05:10,350
purple, green, orange.

193
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:11,649
You have this nice little line

194
00:05:11,649 --> 00:05:12,680
right here like that.

195
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:14,120
And then watch this as well.

196
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:20,110
I can change all the colors so I

197
00:05:20,129 --> 00:05:23,120
can go blue.

198
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,480
I can go orange.

199
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:30,259
I like orange, more orange, that

200
00:05:30,259 --> 00:05:36,220
way more orange, purple, purple's

201
00:05:36,449 --> 00:05:38,750
fun for work.

202
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:39,100
I like purple working green, green

203
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:39,100
and blue.

204
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:39,100
It looks like straight green,

205
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:39,100
blue.

206
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:39,550
Yeah.

207
00:05:39,629 --> 00:05:41,100
So we got a lot of options.

208
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,500
So I like orange.

209
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,519
You can see me in the shadow.

210
00:05:43,529 --> 00:05:44,899
I like orange.

211
00:05:44,899 --> 00:05:46,100
So I'm going to go with orange.

212
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:46,959
Okay.

213
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:48,600
So orange is what I'm going to go

214
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:48,939
with.

215
00:05:48,939 --> 00:05:52,220
Now, this light is not super

216
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,839
strong like this.

217
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:56,170
And so what I want to do is I want

218
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:58,189
to set up another one that's

219
00:05:58,189 --> 00:06:00,399
hitting the wall just like that.

220
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:01,620
So I have a couple different

221
00:06:01,629 --> 00:06:03,199
options that I can do right now.

222
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:04,279
I have two of these lights.

223
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:06,089
I could either set it up on that

224
00:06:06,089 --> 00:06:08,329
stand just like that, or I could

225
00:06:08,329 --> 00:06:10,009
just do another one on the other

226
00:06:10,009 --> 00:06:10,519
side.

227
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:12,680
Now, I think just for simplicity

228
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,379
purposes, I'm going to do it just

229
00:06:14,379 --> 00:06:15,199
over there.

230
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:16,569
You could totally have it where

231
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,819
both the lights are coming in like

232
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:18,120
that.

233
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,279
I'm just going to keep it like

234
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:19,920
right here.

235
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,970
So this is not a lighting course.

236
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,540
Um, you know, guys, there's

237
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:25,980
literal like college level

238
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,509
education that you can go through

239
00:06:27,509 --> 00:06:28,279
for lighting.

240
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:29,420
And I'm not going to provide you

241
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:29,779
that.

242
00:06:29,779 --> 00:06:30,170
I'm sorry.

243
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,370
I'm going to give you the bare

244
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:32,839
minimum that you need to get it

245
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:33,259
done.

246
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:34,269
And hopefully you're like, yeah, I

247
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:34,879
appreciate that.

248
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:35,819
All right.

249
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:37,399
All right.

250
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:41,500
So that is looking pretty good.

251
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,439
And we'll just.

252
00:06:43,449 --> 00:06:48,199
All right.

253
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:50,019
And so you can blend the colors,

254
00:06:50,019 --> 00:06:50,560
right?

255
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,569
You can do that.

256
00:06:51,569 --> 00:06:53,589
I prefer not to just like orange.

257
00:06:54,079 --> 00:07:00,259
I like orange.

258
00:07:00,259 --> 00:07:00,699
Okay.

259
00:07:00,699 --> 00:07:02,399
All right.

260
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:04,829
So we got those lights set up.

261
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:05,980
It looks pretty sick.

262
00:07:06,029 --> 00:07:07,470
We got an interesting color.

263
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:09,230
So if I get out of the way, you

264
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:11,310
guys can see, we got this nice

265
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:12,550
color right here.

266
00:07:12,689 --> 00:07:14,170
And what I want to do as well as I

267
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:15,560
want to lower it a bit.

268
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,610
So let's take these guys.

269
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:18,560
Let's see what it looks like.

270
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,879
We lower it just a bit.

271
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:22,019
We don't need as much on there.

272
00:07:22,019 --> 00:07:22,990
We need it more right there.

273
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:23,290
Right.

274
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:24,389
And then we're just going to line

275
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:25,139
up these circles.

276
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:26,439
Boom.

277
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:27,649
That looks so much better, doesn't

278
00:07:27,649 --> 00:07:27,899
it?

279
00:07:27,899 --> 00:07:28,839
Than it being on the ceiling.

280
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:30,180
That looks awesome.

281
00:07:30,569 --> 00:07:35,149
So now next steps would be my desk

282
00:07:35,149 --> 00:07:36,560
light.

283
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,490
So, but I also installed into my

284
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:39,560
office setup.

285
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,980
You know, guys, you're not all

286
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:41,980
going to have the same setup as

287
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:43,100
mine, but I just figured I'd walk

288
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:43,860
you through mine.

289
00:07:44,569 --> 00:07:50,319
I also have a lighting setup on my

290
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,160
desk.

291
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:54,129
And so you can see it flashes like

292
00:07:54,129 --> 00:07:54,670
that.

293
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:55,920
Now with white, it just kind of

294
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,180
like murders everything.

295
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:57,399
Right.

296
00:07:57,449 --> 00:08:00,470
So the only way I can change it is

297
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,649
on my phone.

298
00:08:01,649 --> 00:08:02,660
So I'm going to pause this real

299
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:03,040
quick.

300
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:03,750
And then I'm going to change it to

301
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:04,490
the color I want.

302
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:05,870
Alrighty.

303
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:06,399
There we go.

304
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:08,779
And so we've got a nice, cool

305
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:10,399
orange backdrop.

306
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:11,480
Right.

307
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:13,029
You've got this LED light right

308
00:08:13,069 --> 00:08:13,360
here.

309
00:08:13,569 --> 00:08:14,629
You've got the lights on the wall.

310
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:16,120
It's looking really nice.

311
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:18,819
So what we'll do is we'll set up

312
00:08:18,889 --> 00:08:19,730
right here.

313
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,540
What we want to see when I take a

314
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:23,339
seat is that there's no lights

315
00:08:23,339 --> 00:08:25,069
hitting or there's no shadows

316
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:27,310
hitting that backdrop right there.

317
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,399
So I can talk and we're not going

318
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:30,420
to see any shadow work.

319
00:08:30,459 --> 00:08:31,740
It's not going to be like we're in

320
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:33,360
Plato's cave philosophy joke for

321
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,418
my friends there.

322
00:08:35,129 --> 00:08:37,190
There's just very, very simple.

323
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,830
The main thing that I like to

324
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:40,350
think about is I don't want

325
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:42,158
shadows in the background.

326
00:08:42,158 --> 00:08:43,070
You can see there's not really

327
00:08:43,158 --> 00:08:43,918
that many shadows.

328
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:45,200
There's a little bit right there

329
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,100
from the computer.

330
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:47,549
I'm cool with that because it's

331
00:08:47,549 --> 00:08:49,450
mainly going to be right here is

332
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:50,399
the shot.

333
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:51,399
So I'm okay with a little bit of

334
00:08:51,409 --> 00:08:51,860
shadows.

335
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,250
What I don't want is in the

336
00:08:53,389 --> 00:08:55,220
background shadows like that.

337
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:56,629
And then I'm like sitting there

338
00:08:56,629 --> 00:08:58,220
and it's, you know, I'm the shadow

339
00:08:58,259 --> 00:08:58,840
as well.

340
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,720
That doesn't look good.

341
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,080
Okay.

342
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,149
It shows you don't know what

343
00:09:01,149 --> 00:09:01,840
you're doing.

344
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:04,539
So you definitely want to do that.

345
00:09:04,539 --> 00:09:06,320
Now let's get into the next steps.

346
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,179
I'm going to go ahead.

347
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:09,100
I'm going to turn on the lights in

348
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,720
here so we can be normal for a

349
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,259
sec.

350
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:12,659
But we'll definitely turn those

351
00:09:12,659 --> 00:09:12,950
on.

352
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:15,879
So we will get to this lighting

353
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:17,340
right here.

354
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,840
This lighting last.

355
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,299
So you guys can see what it looks

356
00:09:22,299 --> 00:09:23,019
like.

357
00:09:23,019 --> 00:09:25,710
So next up is this right here.

358
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:26,649
This is going to be our

359
00:09:26,659 --> 00:09:27,419
microphone.

360
00:09:27,419 --> 00:09:28,929
So the microphone, I'm going to

361
00:09:28,929 --> 00:09:30,549
link you guys all my equipment in

362
00:09:30,649 --> 00:09:31,960
like one Google Doc.

363
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:33,399
Amazon links and everything.

364
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:36,120
But this is a Shure SM7B, I

365
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,379
believe.

366
00:09:37,379 --> 00:09:39,830
Let's say it on it.

367
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:42,539
Oh, yeah.

368
00:09:42,539 --> 00:09:43,580
SM7B.

369
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:46,179
Shure SM7B is like the go-to

370
00:09:46,179 --> 00:09:48,019
microphone that all the big

371
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,379
podcasters use.

372
00:09:49,379 --> 00:09:50,559
Everyone uses this one.

373
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:51,659
It's really good.

374
00:09:51,659 --> 00:09:53,149
So what I'm going to do

375
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:57,080
is I'm going to set this up right

376
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,179
here.

377
00:09:58,179 --> 00:09:59,259
Okay.

378
00:10:02,409 --> 00:10:03,750
And then all I'm going to do is

379
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:05,259
just make sure that it's level

380
00:10:05,259 --> 00:10:06,950
with my face.

381
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:09,710
Now, why do I use a mic?

382
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:12,539
Well, the audio quality of a mic

383
00:10:12,539 --> 00:10:15,039
is a lot better than the audio

384
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:18,820
quality of, you know, your iPhone

385
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,529
camera, or even if you have a

386
00:10:20,669 --> 00:10:22,600
camera inside or the microphone

387
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,120
inside your camera.

388
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,620
You have one of those handheld

389
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:26,460
ones like I do.

390
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:28,480
You know, the quality I found on

391
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,340
this mic is just like second to

392
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:30,960
none.

393
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,539
So I really like it sounds really

394
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,610
good in the videos.

395
00:10:33,649 --> 00:10:35,220
And so that's why I use totally

396
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:35,799
not necessary.

397
00:10:35,799 --> 00:10:36,649
This is absolutely an extra

398
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:37,179
detail.

399
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:38,830
But what I like to do is I like to

400
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:40,379
have it angled like this.

401
00:10:40,379 --> 00:10:42,190
So I know that I'm speaking right

402
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:43,919
into it, even if I move around a

403
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:45,019
little bit.

404
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:46,149
Like the thing that's kind of

405
00:10:46,149 --> 00:10:48,070
interesting about this mic is if

406
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:49,850
you move to the left too much, it

407
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,110
won't be able to pick you up.

408
00:10:51,129 --> 00:10:52,549
You have to speak right into it.

409
00:10:52,909 --> 00:10:55,629
So what I do is I just have it

410
00:10:55,629 --> 00:10:57,700
like right here.

411
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,460
So when I'm talking, I'm basically

412
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:01,350
my, because my voice is going down

413
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:02,070
like this.

414
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:04,139
I am talking into it the entire

415
00:11:04,139 --> 00:11:04,740
time.

416
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:05,610
You know, if you've got the camera

417
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:06,460
right here, blah, blah, blah,

418
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:07,299
blah, everything.

419
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:07,659
Okay.

420
00:11:07,659 --> 00:11:09,019
So that's that.

421
00:11:09,019 --> 00:11:11,210
Now, what are we doing to set up

422
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:12,049
the audio?

423
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:14,000
Well, that's where I'm already.

424
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,059
So check this out.

425
00:11:15,059 --> 00:11:17,350
This is my board.

426
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:19,190
So what we have right here, this

427
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:20,350
is called an XLR cable.

428
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:21,539
So it's a little messy right

429
00:11:21,539 --> 00:11:23,110
there, but don't worry about it.

430
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:25,230
Basically, this wire links into

431
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:26,500
the mic, right?

432
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,480
And then this links into here.

433
00:11:28,779 --> 00:11:30,679
Okay, and then we just turn it on.

434
00:11:30,679 --> 00:11:34,179
This is a Rode Apex Class A Servo

435
00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:36,379
Biased Preamp.

436
00:11:36,379 --> 00:11:37,190
So I don't know what the heck that

437
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:38,879
is, but this is just a soundboard

438
00:11:38,889 --> 00:11:39,429
for it.

439
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:41,679
Oh, so I'm not plugged in right

440
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:42,240
now.

441
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,490
So let's go ahead and let's plug

442
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:45,990
this sucker in.

443
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:48,230
I need to get an extension cord in

444
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:48,879
here.

445
00:11:48,889 --> 00:11:51,909
So go ahead and turn it on.

446
00:11:51,909 --> 00:11:55,190
And all this is, is just the audio

447
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:57,889
levels for everything.

448
00:11:57,899 --> 00:11:59,259
So we want to make sure this is

449
00:11:59,500 --> 00:11:59,850
working.

450
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:01,100
So I'm going to snap right next to

451
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:01,710
this thing.

452
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:03,720
You can see those sound levels on

453
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,899
mic channel one.

454
00:12:04,899 --> 00:12:06,960
That sounds good to me, right?

455
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:09,309
And then we have everything set

456
00:12:09,309 --> 00:12:10,309
up, right?

457
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,250
So all I'd have to do is hit

458
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:11,720
record.

459
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,860
We're good to go.

460
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:14,240
Okay.

461
00:12:14,409 --> 00:12:15,399
Does this make noise or still?

462
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:17,080
I think so.

463
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,980
Anyways, I'm going to have it on

464
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:21,100
the mic or on the headphones.

465
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:22,029
So here we are.

466
00:12:22,029 --> 00:12:24,320
It's pretty much everything, guys.

467
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,769
The last step is going to be this

468
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:26,879
light right here.

469
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:27,809
Okay.

470
00:12:27,809 --> 00:12:29,919
So I'm going to go ahead and just

471
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:32,220
show you guys what that looks like

472
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:34,629
from what we were doing earlier.

473
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:35,870
So let's go ahead and get you back

474
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:36,360
in there.

475
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:40,460
It's odd that the, uh, the iPhone

476
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:43,100
camera does not let you turn

477
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:43,789
around yet.

478
00:12:43,809 --> 00:12:44,879
Like you can do that on Snapchat

479
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:45,940
and Instagram or you can do it on

480
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,039
the fucking Apple iPhone.

481
00:12:47,049 --> 00:12:49,820
So let's go ahead on off the

482
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,919
lights, right?

483
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:52,919
Boom.

484
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:53,980
Boom.

485
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:54,559
It's purple.

486
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:55,600
We don't want a purple.

487
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,159
We want an orange.

488
00:12:57,659 --> 00:12:58,029
Cool.

489
00:12:58,149 --> 00:13:00,279
And now what we need to do is we

490
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:02,450
need to turn on the lights.

491
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:03,549
So let's go over here, guys.

492
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:06,179
I'm going to show you this cool

493
00:13:06,179 --> 00:13:07,940
lighting setup.

494
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:10,159
So I really like this because what

495
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:12,419
it does, put it right here.

496
00:13:13,429 --> 00:13:15,769
I can control the percentage.

497
00:13:15,769 --> 00:13:18,029
So look at this right now, the

498
00:13:18,029 --> 00:13:20,730
room, like watch this, the room,

499
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:23,259
you can't see any of the lights.

500
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:24,179
So you can see the desk light

501
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:25,220
because it's really bright.

502
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:25,940
That's about it.

503
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,320
So like, okay, well, that does,

504
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,120
that's not what we want.

505
00:13:28,129 --> 00:13:30,570
So what we're going to do is we're

506
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:32,860
going to go ahead and turn this

507
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:34,139
down quite a bit.

508
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:38,679
And look at the chair right there.

509
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:39,830
So what you can see is that as

510
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:41,289
we're getting darker, we're going

511
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,309
to hover it around.

512
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:44,149
4%.

513
00:13:44,149 --> 00:13:45,899
Look how much better that lighting

514
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:46,389
looks.

515
00:13:46,389 --> 00:13:47,600
We can actually see it.

516
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,649
And even if I go even lower,

517
00:13:48,659 --> 00:13:49,120
right?

518
00:13:49,129 --> 00:13:50,820
I go like just a little like that.

519
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:52,529
I could still keep a lot of that

520
00:13:52,529 --> 00:13:54,350
good light in the background.

521
00:13:54,409 --> 00:13:56,370
And also what I can do is let's

522
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:57,940
say I want to make it like

523
00:13:58,039 --> 00:14:00,320
different lights, colors.

524
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,570
I could go cooler or I could go

525
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:04,570
warmer.

526
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:06,000
Right.

527
00:14:06,129 --> 00:14:07,809
So because I'm using warm colors,

528
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:09,490
I would assume that that makes

529
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:10,539
sense, right?

530
00:14:10,539 --> 00:14:11,360
To keep the light warm.

531
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:12,950
So I'm going to go ahead and do

532
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:13,299
that.

533
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:14,649
So I'm going to go ahead and take

534
00:14:14,649 --> 00:14:15,600
this down to 4%.

535
00:14:16,129 --> 00:14:18,710
4, 3, 2, right?

536
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:20,240
So let's see with 3.

537
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:23,259
You can still see me, but notice

538
00:14:23,259 --> 00:14:25,279
the issue, right?

539
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,259
What's the issue?

540
00:14:27,259 --> 00:14:29,200
This light is shining on my face.

541
00:14:29,429 --> 00:14:30,950
So we need to scoot up a bit,

542
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:31,580
right?

543
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,389
And so we're going to be right

544
00:14:33,389 --> 00:14:33,960
here.

545
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:35,070
Okay.

546
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:36,899
So our camera will be right here.

547
00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:38,240
We'll be reading from that.

548
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,450
And that's pretty much it, guys.

549
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:42,500
So you can see now, the reason why

550
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,639
we use the soft light is so we can

551
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,399
have this nice backdrop and the

552
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:49,049
color doesn't fade out all the

553
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:49,559
way.

554
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:51,490
Like, obviously, I mean, just take

555
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:52,019
a look.

556
00:14:52,019 --> 00:14:54,799
If we go to zero, it's brighter,

557
00:14:55,179 --> 00:14:55,740
right?

558
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:56,950
The colors are brighter, but we

559
00:14:56,950 --> 00:14:58,059
can't get away with that.

560
00:14:58,070 --> 00:14:59,340
So we need to make it a little,

561
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:00,129
little higher.

562
00:15:00,179 --> 00:15:01,139
So like 3%.

563
00:15:01,159 --> 00:15:01,559
Okay.

564
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:04,139
So now the only thing that's left

565
00:15:04,139 --> 00:15:06,350
is to set up our camera and to

566
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:08,580
record and to get going.

567
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:10,279
So I am now going to load my

568
00:15:10,419 --> 00:15:12,750
script into my teleprompter and

569
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,840
I'm just going to go ahead and

570
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,529
record this script.

571
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:18,399
And so the next thing you guys

572
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:19,490
will see is going to be me

573
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:20,659
recording the thing.

574
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:21,659
All righty.

575
00:15:21,659 --> 00:15:23,100
Here we go, guys.

576
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:25,379
So as you can see, I have it

577
00:15:25,389 --> 00:15:28,360
loaded into my teleprompter app.

578
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:31,190
So it's very simple how to do this

579
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:32,360
next time.

580
00:15:32,889 --> 00:15:34,299
Basically, we're going to go here

581
00:15:34,299 --> 00:15:35,309
to our scripts.

582
00:15:35,389 --> 00:15:36,879
I have a lot in here, as you can

583
00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:38,440
see, and you're going to go to a

584
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,039
folder.

585
00:15:39,049 --> 00:15:40,340
You'll make a folder, make a

586
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,659
script, and you just copy and

587
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,139
paste your script in here.

588
00:15:43,659 --> 00:15:44,840
Literally, just download Google

589
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:46,080
Docs onto your phone.

590
00:15:46,929 --> 00:15:48,620
Copy and paste the script from

591
00:15:48,659 --> 00:15:50,639
Google Docs and teleprompter.

592
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:52,220
And boom, you're ready to go.

593
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:53,919
And so when you hit record, so I'm

594
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:55,559
going to turn on the rotate.

595
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:58,169
When you hit record, you can see,

596
00:15:58,169 --> 00:16:00,789
hey, look, it's going to play.

597
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:04,100
And you can adjust the speed.

598
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:04,700
All right.

599
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:08,210
So this is slower, way slower, way

600
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:09,360
faster.

601
00:16:09,879 --> 00:16:10,379
Okay.

602
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,259
Now, you can buy a remote.

603
00:16:12,269 --> 00:16:13,580
I personally have a remote.

604
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:15,250
I think the remote makes this a

605
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:16,139
lot easier.

606
00:16:16,929 --> 00:16:18,960
When you are doing a static shot,

607
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,049
like what I'm doing right now, I'm

608
00:16:21,059 --> 00:16:22,649
sitting down in front of the

609
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:22,980
camera.

610
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:24,399
It's a lot harder to keep pace,

611
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:24,899
right?

612
00:16:24,909 --> 00:16:26,600
But when you have, you know,

613
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:28,580
you're filming like this.

614
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:30,230
Let's say I'm filming a selfie

615
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:31,929
style video and I'm shooting it

616
00:16:31,929 --> 00:16:32,759
like this.

617
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:34,450
You know, it's actually pretty

618
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,029
easy because let's say I hit play,

619
00:16:36,029 --> 00:16:36,509
right?

620
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:38,809
I can slow it down.

621
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:39,779
I can be, hey, are you a high

622
00:16:39,779 --> 00:16:40,879
ticket info product or coaching

623
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:42,389
business owner that's paying to

624
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:43,450
send traffic to a book call via

625
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:44,039
cell funnel?

626
00:16:44,049 --> 00:16:45,509
Do you ever feel like you're

627
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:47,419
paying too much for book calls?

628
00:16:47,429 --> 00:16:49,000
More than likely you are.

629
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:49,990
I guarantee you I can

630
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:51,610
significantly lower it, blah,

631
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:52,460
blah, blah.

632
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:52,919
See what I mean?

633
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:54,269
So you can slow it down.

634
00:16:54,289 --> 00:16:55,159
You have control because your

635
00:16:55,159 --> 00:16:55,700
finger's on it.

636
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:57,679
I actually, the trick I use is I

637
00:16:57,679 --> 00:16:58,669
use my thumb.

638
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,649
I find that it's a lot easier to

639
00:17:00,649 --> 00:17:02,500
use your thumb to film it like

640
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,700
this, right?

641
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:04,950
And it looks a lot more natural

642
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:06,318
because you're just holding your

643
00:17:06,348 --> 00:17:07,119
phone, okay?

644
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:09,779
So you do that.

645
00:17:09,789 --> 00:17:11,480
You can use your finger like this,

646
00:17:11,619 --> 00:17:13,578
speed it up, slow it down, right?

647
00:17:13,588 --> 00:17:14,900
However you need to do it.

648
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:16,509
So that's everything for the

649
00:17:16,509 --> 00:17:18,338
recording and everything looks

650
00:17:18,338 --> 00:17:20,160
like it's recording right now.

651
00:17:20,309 --> 00:17:21,818
So when I hit stop, it's going to

652
00:17:21,818 --> 00:17:23,348
go and it'll show me what it looks

653
00:17:23,348 --> 00:17:23,838
like.

654
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:26,299
I can slow it down.

655
00:17:26,309 --> 00:17:27,150
I can be, hey, are you a high

656
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:27,769
ticket, right?

657
00:17:27,789 --> 00:17:32,779
So that is everything, my friends.

658
00:17:32,789 --> 00:17:33,980
So all you got to do is you just

659
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:34,849
got to shoot now.

660
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:36,170
Okay.

661
00:17:36,349 --> 00:17:37,779
So here we are now, we're about to

662
00:17:37,809 --> 00:17:38,140
film this.

663
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:39,339
And what's the issue that you guys

664
00:17:39,339 --> 00:17:39,839
noticed?

665
00:17:39,849 --> 00:17:40,500
Can you see it?

666
00:17:40,509 --> 00:17:41,359
Can you see it?

667
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:42,579
What is it?

668
00:17:42,589 --> 00:17:44,420
There's a shadow right there on my

669
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,200
forehead.

670
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:46,900
And so it's very clear to me that

671
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,609
I've got to change this a little

672
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:49,099
bit.

673
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:52,339
I'm going to move this in.

674
00:17:52,349 --> 00:17:56,619
I'll move this in.

675
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,490
Now let's see if that same shadow

676
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:01,460
is there.

677
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,180
Almost hardly not.

678
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:04,099
You can see it.

679
00:18:04,109 --> 00:18:05,019
I'll move my head.

680
00:18:05,029 --> 00:18:07,640
Now looks pretty good, right?

681
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:09,539
So that's that.

682
00:18:09,549 --> 00:18:11,930
So now what we need to do is we

683
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:13,319
need to film.

684
00:18:13,789 --> 00:18:15,029
So now we're going to move into

685
00:18:15,029 --> 00:18:15,480
filming.

686
00:18:15,569 --> 00:18:18,440
And so the only thing I don't like

687
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:21,329
is I don't like this corner right

688
00:18:21,329 --> 00:18:22,119
here.

689
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:23,920
I think this looks kind of shitty.

690
00:18:24,049 --> 00:18:26,039
As you can see, like the wire and

691
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:26,930
like this.

692
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:28,589
So what I'm going to do is when I

693
00:18:28,589 --> 00:18:30,039
record this, I'm going to just

694
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:30,849
film it like this.

695
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:32,680
But I can punch in in post.

696
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:34,119
So what that means is when I go in

697
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,809
and move into the video editor, I

698
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:37,460
can push in a little bit.

699
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:38,589
And so these corners aren't going

700
00:18:38,589 --> 00:18:39,119
to be there.

701
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:40,539
And it's going to be more around

702
00:18:40,589 --> 00:18:41,539
like right here.

703
00:18:41,549 --> 00:18:41,859
Okay.

704
00:18:41,869 --> 00:18:42,839
And I can just stretch it out a

705
00:18:42,839 --> 00:18:43,140
bit.

706
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:44,609
So let's just get into right and

707
00:18:44,619 --> 00:18:46,000
get right into filming.

708
00:18:46,009 --> 00:18:47,700
And yeah, pretty much everything

709
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,420
that we need to cover on setup.

710
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:50,380
This is a pretty good setup,

711
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:50,740
right?

712
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:51,640
This looks professional.

713
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:52,759
It looks good.

714
00:18:52,789 --> 00:18:53,579
It looks like I know what I'm

715
00:18:53,579 --> 00:18:53,910
doing.

716
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:55,619
And it just looks clean.

717
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:56,240
That's it.

718
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:58,730
So let's go ahead and let's just

719
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:00,039
film the VSL.

720
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:01,759
And so the next thing you guys

721
00:19:01,769 --> 00:19:03,220
will see is the VSL itself.

722
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:05,089
Are you a high ticket info product

723
00:19:05,089 --> 00:19:06,960
or coaching business owner that's

724
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,430
paying to send traffic to a book a

725
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:09,299
call VSL funnel?

726
00:19:09,329 --> 00:19:10,690
Do you ever feel like you're

727
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,390
paying too much for book calls?

728
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:14,059
More than likely, you are.

729
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:15,759
In fact, I guarantee you, I can

730
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,829
significantly lower your cost per

731
00:19:17,829 --> 00:19:19,769
book call and make your VSL funnel

732
00:19:19,769 --> 00:19:21,720
more profitable without touching a

733
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:22,500
single ad.

734
00:19:22,509 --> 00:19:23,799
And if I can't beat your current

735
00:19:23,799 --> 00:19:25,440
metrics within 90 days, I'll work

736
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,750
with you for free until I do beat

737
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:27,559
those numbers.

738
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:29,720
My name is Nicholas Verge, and the

739
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,200
way I'm able to guarantee this is

740
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,750
by utilizing my VSL optimization

741
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,349
system, which I've developed on

742
00:19:34,349 --> 00:19:35,829
the journey of producing $30

743
00:19:35,829 --> 00:19:37,329
million for my clients' VSLs.

744
00:19:37,349 --> 00:19:38,569
Over the course of five years,

745
00:19:38,569 --> 00:19:39,650
I've been in the trenches,

746
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:41,180
writing, filming, and working with

747
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,309
editors to produce VSLs with

748
00:19:42,309 --> 00:19:43,750
celebrities like Jordan Belfer and

749
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:44,509
Alex Jones,

750
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:46,059
but also with numerous info

751
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:47,180
product business owners you

752
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,500
probably don't even know who are

753
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,890
quietly cleaning up seven to eight

754
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:50,720
figures a year.

755
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:52,309
This system I've created contains

756
00:19:52,309 --> 00:19:53,950
over 65 possible split tests we

757
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:55,369
can implement on your VSL that I

758
00:19:55,369 --> 00:19:56,900
guarantee you will give you a lift

759
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:57,940
in conversions.

760
00:19:57,950 --> 00:19:59,190
Most of the time, all it takes,

761
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:00,339
though, is two to three split

762
00:20:00,339 --> 00:20:01,740
tests out of the possible 65 for

763
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:02,849
us to see a dramatic change in

764
00:20:02,849 --> 00:20:03,349
results.

765
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:04,690
I'll be sure to show you some

766
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:06,059
proof here in a moment, but real

767
00:20:06,059 --> 00:20:07,359
quick, I want to talk about the

768
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:08,789
wonders this optimization system

769
00:20:08,809 --> 00:20:10,119
can work on your VSL funnel.

770
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:11,640
I want to talk about who this is

771
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,109
for and who this is not for.

772
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:14,390
Okay, so this is for you if you

773
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:15,769
already have a VSL funnel that is

774
00:20:15,779 --> 00:20:17,720
selling a product between $2,000

775
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,680
and $20,000 and your business is

776
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:20,960
operating at $100K a month

777
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:21,480
minimum.

778
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:23,039
This is for you if you're already

779
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:24,000
running paid traffic to your

780
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,200
funnel, whether that's going to be

781
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,420
Instagram, Facebook, YouTube,

782
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:27,170
whatever it is.

783
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:28,599
And this is for you if you already

784
00:20:28,619 --> 00:20:30,029
have a sales team in place to take

785
00:20:30,029 --> 00:20:31,119
on more book calls.

786
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:32,480
If all that checks out, awesome,

787
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:33,539
this video is for you.

788
00:20:33,549 --> 00:20:34,980
If, however, you don't have a VSL

789
00:20:35,009 --> 00:20:36,450
in place, if you're not operating

790
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:38,349
at a minimum of $100K a month, if

791
00:20:38,349 --> 00:20:39,869
you don't have a sales team ready

792
00:20:39,869 --> 00:20:41,869
to go, this video is unfortunately

793
00:20:41,869 --> 00:20:42,690
not for you.

794
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:43,990
Okay, the reason I focus on

795
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:45,589
business owners who have all this

796
00:20:45,589 --> 00:20:46,710
in place is because in my

797
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:48,559
experience, these are the people

798
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:49,940
that are most likely to see

799
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:51,710
results from my VSL optimization

800
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:52,380
system.

801
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:53,799
For example, this system has

802
00:20:53,799 --> 00:20:55,269
worked wonders for my previous

803
00:20:55,279 --> 00:20:56,869
clients, like Tim Sanders, who

804
00:20:56,869 --> 00:20:58,450
runs an Amazon FBA biz op coaching

805
00:20:58,450 --> 00:20:58,940
offer.

806
00:20:59,029 --> 00:21:00,460
Tim came to me with a VSL that had

807
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:02,190
a conversion rate of around 3% and

808
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:03,630
was generating book calls for

809
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:05,089
around $300 a pop.

810
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:06,900
After implementing a round of

811
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,420
split tests into his VSL, we got

812
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,369
the conversion rate up to 11.6%

813
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:11,910
and his cost per book call down to

814
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:12,819
$110.

815
00:21:12,829 --> 00:21:14,210
And this is what made it possible

816
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:15,539
for Tim to actually scale from

817
00:21:15,539 --> 00:21:17,839
$500K a month up to $700 to $800K

818
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:19,099
a month consistently.

819
00:21:19,109 --> 00:21:20,359
And then there's also my previous

820
00:21:20,359 --> 00:21:21,690
client, Quasi Joe here, who runs a

821
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:22,900
coaching program that's a mix of

822
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:23,890
personal development and

823
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:25,019
spirituality as well.

824
00:21:25,029 --> 00:21:26,619
Quasi's VSL had a conversion rate

825
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:28,349
that was hovering right around 2%

826
00:21:28,349 --> 00:21:29,839
at a cost per book call at around

827
00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:31,039
$300 a pop.

828
00:21:31,329 --> 00:21:33,289
All it took was one round of split

829
00:21:33,289 --> 00:21:35,180
tests with his VSL to skyrocket

830
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:37,599
his conversion rate up to 16%.

831
00:21:37,609 --> 00:21:39,299
Okay, there's Courtney Fletcher,

832
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,670
who runs an e-com biz op offer

833
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,859
tailored for women.

834
00:21:41,869 --> 00:21:43,559
She was already doing well, but

835
00:21:43,609 --> 00:21:45,359
all it took was one round of split

836
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:45,960
tests.

837
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:47,609
She went from an 11% conversion

838
00:21:47,609 --> 00:21:49,400
rate to a 16% conversion rate.

839
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:50,380
Want to know why all these

840
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:51,619
different business owners were

841
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:52,819
able to see such a significant

842
00:21:52,819 --> 00:21:54,420
boost in their funnel performance?

843
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:54,859
Me.

844
00:21:54,869 --> 00:21:55,839
No, I'm just kidding.

845
00:21:55,849 --> 00:21:57,259
It's because they all suffered

846
00:21:57,279 --> 00:21:59,059
from the same problem, friction.

847
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:00,799
So what I want to talk about in

848
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:02,309
this video is how friction holds

849
00:22:02,309 --> 00:22:03,519
your VSL back from its full

850
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:04,440
performance.

851
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:05,799
But there's a chance you may not

852
00:22:05,809 --> 00:22:07,059
care about that, right?

853
00:22:07,089 --> 00:22:08,500
Maybe you're ADHD like me.

854
00:22:08,509 --> 00:22:09,630
You've heard what I have to say.

855
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:10,839
You like my track record.

856
00:22:10,849 --> 00:22:11,940
You see the value in having

857
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:13,240
someone like me run split tests

858
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,099
against your VSL.

859
00:22:14,109 --> 00:22:15,400
If that's the case, you don't

860
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,819
really care about the problem or

861
00:22:16,819 --> 00:22:18,460
my system or anything like that.

862
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:20,029
You just want the end result,

863
00:22:20,029 --> 00:22:21,650
which is a better converting or

864
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:23,099
profitable VSL that brings in

865
00:22:23,099 --> 00:22:24,460
pools of your ideal customers.

866
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:25,890
If that's all you want, you know

867
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:26,339
the deal.

868
00:22:26,369 --> 00:22:27,400
You can click that button below

869
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,200
this video, fill out an

870
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,470
application, blah, blah, blah.

871
00:22:29,509 --> 00:22:30,299
Book a call with me.

872
00:22:30,309 --> 00:22:31,480
That's where we're going to

873
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,920
discuss what it would look like to

874
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:34,500
beat your current conversion rate.

875
00:22:34,509 --> 00:22:35,769
But if you do want to discover the

876
00:22:35,769 --> 00:22:36,920
overarching problem that's

877
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,279
plaguing your business and the

878
00:22:38,279 --> 00:22:39,690
performance of your VSL, stick

879
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:40,259
around.

880
00:22:40,269 --> 00:22:41,960
I'm about to drop some value

881
00:22:42,019 --> 00:22:42,720
bombs.

882
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:44,279
Okay, so here's what you need to

883
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:44,819
understand.

884
00:22:44,829 --> 00:22:46,210
There are wrong types of friction

885
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:47,369
and there are right types of

886
00:22:47,369 --> 00:22:47,920
friction.

887
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:49,650
The right type of friction keeps

888
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:51,470
the wrong prospects that you don't

889
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:53,089
want from getting in your sales

890
00:22:53,089 --> 00:22:53,779
funnel.

891
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:55,359
But the wrong type of friction

892
00:22:55,359 --> 00:22:57,200
keeps the ideal prospects that you

893
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,960
do want from getting in your sales

894
00:22:58,960 --> 00:22:59,640
funnel.

895
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:00,680
Think about this for a second,

896
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:00,980
guys.

897
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:02,279
The biggest businesses in the

898
00:23:02,279 --> 00:23:03,470
world all focus on removing

899
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:05,240
friction from their sales process.

900
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:06,220
Why aren't you doing the same?

901
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:07,359
For everyday people needing to go

902
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:08,430
buy something from the store,

903
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,460
that's a lot of friction.

904
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:10,730
You have to get up, get in your

905
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:12,269
car, drive over there, go find the

906
00:23:12,269 --> 00:23:13,619
thing you need, and so on.

907
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:14,829
Amazon made it frictionless for

908
00:23:14,829 --> 00:23:16,230
people to buy whatever they want.

909
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:17,660
Another example is you used to

910
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,990
have to go to Blockbuster or

911
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:20,839
Redbox to watch a movie, right?

912
00:23:20,859 --> 00:23:22,099
Netflix made movie night

913
00:23:22,099 --> 00:23:23,000
frictionless.

914
00:23:23,009 --> 00:23:24,099
You don't got to go to the movie

915
00:23:24,099 --> 00:23:25,319
theater, no location, just at

916
00:23:25,319 --> 00:23:25,700
home.

917
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:26,940
And back in the day, if you needed

918
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,059
to go somewhere and you didn't

919
00:23:28,059 --> 00:23:28,619
have a car,

920
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:29,579
you either had to call a cab that

921
00:23:29,579 --> 00:23:30,539
would take forever to get to you

922
00:23:30,539 --> 00:23:31,240
or call a friend.

923
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:32,569
But Uber made it frictionless for

924
00:23:32,569 --> 00:23:33,829
someone to get transportation

925
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:34,400
quickly.

926
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:35,980
Friction is what prevents people

927
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:37,619
from buying and taking action.

928
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,640
And I guarantee you, chances are,

929
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,849
your VSL has some form of

930
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,799
unnecessary friction in it, okay?

931
00:23:42,809 --> 00:23:44,289
This is causing your ideal

932
00:23:44,289 --> 00:23:46,049
prospects to not take action on

933
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:48,029
booking a call with you or buying

934
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:49,000
your product or service.

935
00:23:49,009 --> 00:23:50,420
It could be that certain parts of

936
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,500
your VSL are boring.

937
00:23:51,509 --> 00:23:52,579
Maybe it's that it's not very

938
00:23:52,579 --> 00:23:53,569
visually compelling.

939
00:23:53,589 --> 00:23:54,970
It's just a static camera shot of

940
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:56,529
you talking for 35 minutes.

941
00:23:56,549 --> 00:23:58,170
And as a result, people get bored,

942
00:23:58,170 --> 00:23:59,640
go back to Instagram, TikTok,

943
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:01,180
YouTube, visually stimulating

944
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:01,700
stuff.

945
00:24:01,849 --> 00:24:03,160
It could be that certain parts of

946
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,579
your VSL script are not compelling

947
00:24:04,579 --> 00:24:05,839
enough and the viewer doesn't

948
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:07,119
understand or see the value in

949
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:08,109
continuing to watch your sales

950
00:24:08,109 --> 00:24:08,700
presentation.

951
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:09,490
They're like, how does this apply

952
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:09,759
to me?

953
00:24:09,769 --> 00:24:11,029
It could be that the offer you're

954
00:24:11,029 --> 00:24:12,289
presenting in the VSL is just not

955
00:24:12,289 --> 00:24:13,319
compelling enough.

956
00:24:13,349 --> 00:24:14,730
People are watching the video, but

957
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:15,950
they don't have a desire to book a

958
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:17,319
call or buy anything from you.

959
00:24:17,329 --> 00:24:18,740
These are all different types of

960
00:24:18,789 --> 00:24:19,970
friction, but the list is

961
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:21,079
literally endless.

962
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:22,319
So here's what I want you to

963
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:22,720
imagine.

964
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:24,190
What would it be like if we

965
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,180
removed all the bad friction from

966
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:26,980
your VSL?

967
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:28,319
If we made it so more people

968
00:24:28,339 --> 00:24:30,079
actually wanted to stay and watch

969
00:24:30,119 --> 00:24:30,839
your VSL?

970
00:24:30,849 --> 00:24:32,220
If we prevented unnecessary

971
00:24:32,309 --> 00:24:33,940
drop-offs from your viewers?

972
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:35,660
And if we increased the amount of

973
00:24:35,799 --> 00:24:37,609
people taking action at the end of

974
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:38,359
your VSL?

975
00:24:38,369 --> 00:24:39,299
What would that do for your

976
00:24:39,299 --> 00:24:39,799
business?

977
00:24:39,829 --> 00:24:41,410
You'd be probably checking your

978
00:24:41,410 --> 00:24:42,990
sales Slack channel and see piff

979
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:44,470
after piff after piff coming in at

980
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:46,160
a volume you haven't seen before.

981
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:47,420
Checking your ad account, you'd

982
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:48,740
actually be happy with the metrics

983
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:49,500
you're seeing.

984
00:24:50,069 --> 00:24:51,099
And you'd have way more revenue

985
00:24:51,099 --> 00:24:52,269
coming through the door, but more

986
00:24:52,339 --> 00:24:53,410
importantly, you'd just be more

987
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:54,059
profitable.

988
00:24:54,069 --> 00:24:55,680
That means more money staying in

989
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,299
your bank account, all because

990
00:24:57,299 --> 00:24:58,440
your VSL doesn't have any

991
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,029
unnecessary friction attached to

992
00:25:00,029 --> 00:25:00,359
it.

993
00:25:00,369 --> 00:25:01,710
Okay, so how can you remove a

994
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,400
majority of the friction inside of

995
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,839
your current VSL funnel?

996
00:25:04,849 --> 00:25:06,390
Well, first things first, you've

997
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:07,700
got to diagnose the problem,

998
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:08,200
right?

999
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:09,710
Like I said, guys, I can't say for

1000
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:11,109
certain what type of friction is

1001
00:25:11,109 --> 00:25:12,430
holding your VSL back from its

1002
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:13,380
full potential.

1003
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:15,079
The only way I'd be able to tell

1004
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:17,359
is by actually watching the VSL.

1005
00:25:17,369 --> 00:25:18,650
And that is the first step I walk

1006
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:19,910
every client through before we

1007
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:21,269
even talk about running any split

1008
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:22,160
tests together.

1009
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:23,599
Because there's a possibility that

1010
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:24,549
maybe your VSL isn't the

1011
00:25:24,549 --> 00:25:26,200
bottleneck in your sales process.

1012
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:27,619
I can't say for certain until I

1013
00:25:27,619 --> 00:25:29,150
take a look at your business.

1014
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:30,720
Okay, so what I'd like to do is

1015
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,319
I'd actually like for you to send

1016
00:25:32,359 --> 00:25:33,099
me your VSL.

1017
00:25:33,109 --> 00:25:34,180
I'd like to watch it.

1018
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:35,380
And then what I'd like to do is

1019
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:36,539
create a complimentary VSL

1020
00:25:36,539 --> 00:25:37,700
friction audit for you.

1021
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:38,960
We can discuss that together on a

1022
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:39,339
call.

1023
00:25:39,549 --> 00:25:40,619
If I feel like I can help you, and

1024
00:25:40,619 --> 00:25:41,819
more importantly, if you feel like

1025
00:25:41,829 --> 00:25:43,220
I can help you, what I'd like to

1026
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:44,769
do is take my list of 65 split

1027
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:46,140
tests, pick three to five of them

1028
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:47,160
that we can deploy based on the

1029
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:48,299
friction I've identified.

1030
00:25:48,309 --> 00:25:49,690
And, you know, maybe my initial

1031
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:51,059
split test won't give us the lift

1032
00:25:51,059 --> 00:25:52,079
we're looking for.

1033
00:25:52,089 --> 00:25:52,880
That's okay.

1034
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:53,619
That's the case.

1035
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:54,809
We just pick another three to five

1036
00:25:54,809 --> 00:25:55,819
different split tests.

1037
00:25:55,829 --> 00:25:56,839
Give it another shot.

1038
00:25:57,859 --> 00:25:58,960
Regardless, like I said earlier, I

1039
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,259
guarantee that I'll be able to

1040
00:26:00,269 --> 00:26:01,799
beat your current conversion rate

1041
00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:02,980
in under 90 days.

1042
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:04,279
That's more than enough time to

1043
00:26:04,279 --> 00:26:05,579
run one to three rounds of split

1044
00:26:05,579 --> 00:26:06,049
tests.

1045
00:26:06,089 --> 00:26:07,329
And I have yet to see a VSL that

1046
00:26:07,329 --> 00:26:08,849
doesn't see improved performance

1047
00:26:08,849 --> 00:26:10,480
after those one to three rounds.

1048
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:11,839
It could be that we need better

1049
00:26:11,849 --> 00:26:12,440
visuals.

1050
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:13,829
And if that's the case, I'm going

1051
00:26:13,849 --> 00:26:15,220
to put my team of video editors to

1052
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:16,640
work on editing your existing VSL

1053
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,700
to make it look way better.

1054
00:26:18,029 --> 00:26:19,250
It could be that we need a better

1055
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:19,720
script.

1056
00:26:19,769 --> 00:26:20,700
And if that's the case, I'm

1057
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:21,680
rolling up my sleeves and I'm

1058
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,700
going to revise your script for

1059
00:26:22,759 --> 00:26:23,140
you.

1060
00:26:23,309 --> 00:26:24,690
I mean, it also could be that your

1061
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:26,000
VSL needs more direct to camera

1062
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:26,859
footage like this.

1063
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:28,170
And if that's the case, I'm going

1064
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:28,960
to book a flight.

1065
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:30,099
I'm going to hire my crew and I'm

1066
00:26:30,109 --> 00:26:31,259
going to come to where you're at

1067
00:26:31,259 --> 00:26:32,349
and I'm going to film a VSL with

1068
00:26:32,349 --> 00:26:32,759
you.

1069
00:26:32,769 --> 00:26:34,289
Again, the only way for me to say

1070
00:26:34,289 --> 00:26:35,869
for certain what your VSL needs is

1071
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:37,559
by doing an actual diagnosis.

1072
00:26:37,569 --> 00:26:38,859
This is why I don't charge a flat

1073
00:26:38,859 --> 00:26:40,259
rate because you can see from what

1074
00:26:40,259 --> 00:26:41,710
I've just explained, everyone's

1075
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:42,660
VSL is different.

1076
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:44,079
So here's how you can get your

1077
00:26:44,099 --> 00:26:45,759
very own VSL friction audit.

1078
00:26:45,789 --> 00:26:47,200
Look below this video, hit a

1079
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:49,079
button, click that button, make it

1080
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:50,380
an assessment, fill out the

1081
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:51,690
assessment, see if it makes sense

1082
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:52,619
for us to hop on a call.

1083
00:26:52,930 --> 00:26:53,930
And before you do that, I just

1084
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:54,940
want you to really think about

1085
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:55,720
this for a second.

1086
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:57,190
How much money are you losing or

1087
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,789
leaving on the table every single

1088
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:00,200
day by running ads to a VSL that

1089
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,930
has unnecessary friction attached

1090
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:02,319
to it?

1091
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:03,900
And this may piss you off a little

1092
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:05,299
bit, but also how many of your

1093
00:27:05,299 --> 00:27:06,710
viewers are watching the first

1094
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:08,289
three minutes of your VSL dropping

1095
00:27:08,289 --> 00:27:09,700
off because they were bored.

1096
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:10,880
And then later in the week,

1097
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,319
watching your competitors VSL in

1098
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:13,809
full because it was compelling and

1099
00:27:13,829 --> 00:27:15,210
buying their product instead of

1100
00:27:15,319 --> 00:27:15,750
yours.

1101
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:17,430
All these problems can be

1102
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:19,130
mitigated by removing the friction

1103
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:19,980
in your VSL.

1104
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:21,400
You doing nothing and not filling

1105
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:22,599
out an application for a VSL

1106
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:24,019
friction audit ensures that you

1107
00:27:24,019 --> 00:27:25,319
will continue to suffer from these

1108
00:27:25,599 --> 00:27:26,240
problems.

1109
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:27,839
Now, you go and try and solve the

1110
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:28,940
problem yourself.

1111
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:29,940
Well, let me ask you this.

1112
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:31,069
What business are you in?

1113
00:27:31,819 --> 00:27:33,339
Probably not the VSL business like

1114
00:27:33,339 --> 00:27:34,589
me, but if you are the type of

1115
00:27:34,589 --> 00:27:36,079
person who wants to do everything

1116
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:37,849
themselves, regardless of the fact

1117
00:27:37,849 --> 00:27:39,160
that an expert like me can get it

1118
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,410
done better and faster for you,

1119
00:27:40,519 --> 00:27:41,279
all the best.

1120
00:27:41,289 --> 00:27:42,259
I'm not your guy.

1121
00:27:42,269 --> 00:27:43,480
However, if you do want expert

1122
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,660
help, you want to ensure that

1123
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:45,980
you're able to get better results

1124
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:47,390
from your VSL in under 90 days so

1125
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:48,569
you can have a more profitable

1126
00:27:48,569 --> 00:27:49,299
business.

1127
00:27:49,549 --> 00:27:50,740
Good news, I am literally

1128
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:52,240
guaranteeing those results for

1129
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:52,609
you.

1130
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:53,970
All you got to do is fill out the

1131
00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:55,670
application down below, schedule a

1132
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:57,089
time to chat, and we'll go from

1133
00:27:57,089 --> 00:27:57,640
there.

1134
00:27:57,650 --> 00:27:58,910
Again, if I don't think I can help

1135
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:00,099
you, I'm not going to pitch you

1136
00:28:00,099 --> 00:28:00,710
anything.

1137
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:01,849
If I've identified that your

1138
00:28:01,849 --> 00:28:02,940
problem is elsewhere in your

1139
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,279
funnel, I'll just send you on your

1140
00:28:04,359 --> 00:28:05,380
way with a list of credible

1141
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:06,609
referrals who can help you with

1142
00:28:06,609 --> 00:28:07,869
your specific problem.

1143
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:09,579
I have sales guys, media buyers,

1144
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:11,230
funnel builders, and more in my

1145
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:12,890
referral network, and I'm more

1146
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:14,839
than happy to share them with you.

1147
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:16,470
But if I do feel like I can help,

1148
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:17,880
I'll extend an offer to you, and

1149
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,119
if it makes sense, we can get

1150
00:28:19,119 --> 00:28:20,470
cranking on producing a new VSL

1151
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:21,849
that blows your old one out of the

1152
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:22,509
water.

1153
00:28:22,529 --> 00:28:23,720
Okay, so what do you have to lose?

1154
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:24,910
Click the button below, fill out

1155
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:26,230
that application, book a call, and

1156
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:27,220
I'll speak to you soon.

1157
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:28,519
All righty, all the best.

1158
00:28:28,529 --> 00:28:29,220
Bye now.

1159
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:30,920
And all righty, guys, that is

1160
00:28:31,059 --> 00:28:31,980
everything.

1161
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:33,039
So if you wanted to do it just

1162
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:34,349
like this, if you wanted to shoot

1163
00:28:34,349 --> 00:28:35,430
a video like this instead of

1164
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:36,789
having a professional setup like I

1165
00:28:36,789 --> 00:28:38,059
have with like a backdrop and like

1166
00:28:38,119 --> 00:28:38,990
you direct a camera and

1167
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:40,470
everything, you can totally just

1168
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:41,119
do it like this.

1169
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:42,259
You can do it with you filming,

1170
00:28:42,289 --> 00:28:43,619
walking around the office, you can

1171
00:28:43,619 --> 00:28:44,829
do it with you walking down, you

1172
00:28:44,829 --> 00:28:45,700
know, a street.

1173
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:46,779
I like backgrounds.

1174
00:28:46,789 --> 00:28:47,970
Really good to do it in nature,

1175
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:49,200
and too, if you want to do it like

1176
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,619
that, a nice big backdrop, forests

1177
00:28:50,619 --> 00:28:52,019
or whatever, desert, whatever you

1178
00:28:52,039 --> 00:28:53,279
want to do, mountains, lake,

1179
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:54,460
something like that.

1180
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:55,710
Like pretty backdrop is always the

1181
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:56,160
way to do it.

1182
00:28:56,309 --> 00:28:57,690
So if you're going to do it like

1183
00:28:57,710 --> 00:28:59,380
that, you know, don't just do it,

1184
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,960
hey, if you're a book a call, VSL

1185
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,619
funnel owner, like you don't want

1186
00:29:02,619 --> 00:29:03,920
to do that, right?

1187
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:05,000
You want to have it where there's

1188
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,140
some sort of a backdrop, some sort

1189
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:06,700
of a scene.

1190
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:07,779
So I like the direct camera

1191
00:29:07,779 --> 00:29:09,150
because I can do lights, all type

1192
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:09,640
of stuff.

1193
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:11,140
So that's everything, guys.

1194
00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:11,859
That's everything I got for you

1195
00:29:11,859 --> 00:29:12,140
today.

1196
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:14,700
I hope that was useful for you

1197
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:15,519
guys.

1198
00:29:15,529 --> 00:29:16,630
Again, you want to do it like

1199
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,019
this?

1200
00:29:17,029 --> 00:29:17,460
Cool.

1201
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:18,359
Just swap it out.

1202
00:29:18,369 --> 00:29:20,000
I would always recommend, though,

1203
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,309
if you're going to do the direct

1204
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:22,799
camera stuff and you want to look

1205
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:23,950
like this, invest in good

1206
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:25,500
equipment, buy good cameras, buy

1207
00:29:25,519 --> 00:29:27,109
good mics, buy good lighting, all

1208
00:29:27,109 --> 00:29:28,339
that type of stuff.

1209
00:29:29,109 --> 00:29:30,430
I think is the saying, right,

1210
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:31,589
we're not rich enough to buy

1211
00:29:31,589 --> 00:29:33,069
shitty things because then you got

1212
00:29:33,069 --> 00:29:34,309
to buy it twice, right?

1213
00:29:34,329 --> 00:29:35,319
So might as well just buy the good

1214
00:29:35,319 --> 00:29:35,880
stuff first.

1215
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:37,130
So I'll put together a list for

1216
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:38,500
you guys of all the equipment that

1217
00:29:38,529 --> 00:29:39,279
I use and just some

1218
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:40,839
recommendations and some stuff.

1219
00:29:40,849 --> 00:29:42,539
But, yep, there you go.

1220
00:29:42,549 --> 00:29:44,079
Minimum viable VSL production.

1221
00:29:44,089 --> 00:29:45,519
All right, you guys, all the best.

1222
00:29:45,559 --> 00:29:46,279
Peace.
