1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:01,710
Alrighty ladies and gents, boys

2
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:03,299
and girls, here we are talking

3
00:00:03,299 --> 00:00:04,660
again about how to craft

4
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:06,379
and create a banger VSL for your

5
00:00:06,379 --> 00:00:07,799
B2B service offer.

6
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:09,179
And so what we're going to be

7
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:09,369
talking

8
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,400
about today is the three different

9
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,050
types of VSLs you can produce and

10
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:14,019
how to know which

11
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:15,179
one is best for you and your

12
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:16,019
personality type.

13
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:17,359
Okay, so this is going to be a

14
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:17,940
very quick

15
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:18,350
module.

16
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:19,589
Very straightforward guys.

17
00:00:19,589 --> 00:00:20,890
Okay, we're going to be mainly in

18
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:21,809
the demo section here

19
00:00:21,859 --> 00:00:22,710
because I can only talk about

20
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:23,579
production for so long.

21
00:00:23,579 --> 00:00:26,079
So now it's time for you to shoot

22
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:26,510
a VSL.

23
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:27,870
You only have so many options.

24
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:29,019
So I'm going to walk you guys

25
00:00:29,019 --> 00:00:29,839
through a simple

26
00:00:29,879 --> 00:00:30,219
flowchart.

27
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:31,129
I know you guys love flowcharts,

28
00:00:31,129 --> 00:00:31,789
so I'm going to walk you through

29
00:00:32,039 --> 00:00:32,399
one right

30
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:32,840
now.

31
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:35,119
Here's where we're going to start.

32
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,960
The question, are you good on

33
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:37,630
camera?

34
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:38,359
If the answer

35
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,990
is no, you're going to do a Loom

36
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:42,399
GammaDoc VSL.

37
00:00:42,439 --> 00:00:43,039
Okay.

38
00:00:43,159 --> 00:00:46,240
The reason why is because on Loom,

39
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:46,539
notice

40
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:49,939
how 25 to 33% of this screen is me

41
00:00:49,939 --> 00:00:51,039
right now.

42
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,909
It's because I identify as someone

43
00:00:53,939 --> 00:00:54,840
being good

44
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:56,100
on camera and I'm comfortable with

45
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:56,810
being on camera.

46
00:00:56,829 --> 00:00:58,079
I like being on camera.

47
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,820
So I'm okay

48
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,829
with being 25 to 33% of the

49
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:02,539
screen.

50
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,180
Now, if you're not good on camera

51
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:06,340
and you're just like,

52
00:01:06,379 --> 00:01:07,469
oh, that's just not what I do.

53
00:01:07,469 --> 00:01:08,650
I just, I don't want, I think you

54
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:09,920
should inspect that limiting

55
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:10,319
belief.

56
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:11,379
But if that's the case and you

57
00:01:11,379 --> 00:01:12,489
insist and you don't want to be

58
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:13,319
really on camera,

59
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:15,019
do a Loom GammaDoc because it's

60
00:01:15,019 --> 00:01:16,780
going to be a very small circle in

61
00:01:16,849 --> 00:01:18,150
the corner here, right

62
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:18,469
here.

63
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,469
You're going to be a little bit of

64
00:01:19,469 --> 00:01:20,510
a circle and it'll be primarily be

65
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:20,980
the Google

66
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:21,459
Doc.

67
00:01:21,709 --> 00:01:21,980
Okay.

68
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:22,969
Or the GammaDoc.

69
00:01:23,219 --> 00:01:23,680
Okay.

70
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,590
So that is the Loom GammaDoc.

71
00:01:25,629 --> 00:01:27,329
The reason we use GammaDocs

72
00:01:27,379 --> 00:01:28,980
is because they look better than

73
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:29,769
Google Docs.

74
00:01:29,769 --> 00:01:31,519
Right now, what I'm shooting on is

75
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:32,359
GammaDocs.

76
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:32,959
Okay.

77
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:35,079
This wouldn't look as good as a

78
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:36,129
Google Doc.

79
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:36,620
Okay.

80
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:39,400
I think it looks better like this.

81
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:40,829
So there's a lot more graphics

82
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:41,739
that you can use.

83
00:01:41,739 --> 00:01:43,430
I kept this pretty minimalistic

84
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:44,079
for the

85
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:46,000
client ascension team, but guys,

86
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,900
Loom GammaDoc.

87
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,319
Okay.

88
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:48,659
Very straightforward.

89
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:50,310
Now, are you good on

90
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:50,829
camera?

91
00:01:50,829 --> 00:01:52,170
If the answer is yes, the next

92
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:53,739
question is, do you have a good

93
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:54,549
camera setup?

94
00:01:54,549 --> 00:01:55,239
Do you have,

95
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,590
like me, a DSLR?

96
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:58,870
Do you have a good microphone?

97
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:01,159
If the answer is no, here's what

98
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:02,510
we're going to ask

99
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:02,920
you now.

100
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:03,859
I don't have this stuff.

101
00:02:03,859 --> 00:02:04,790
You don't have that type of

102
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:05,269
equipment.

103
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:05,739
Awesome.

104
00:02:05,739 --> 00:02:06,340
No worries.

105
00:02:06,379 --> 00:02:08,139
Do you at least have a good laptop

106
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:08,758
camera?

107
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:10,430
Are you at least on a modern day

108
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:11,050
MacBook?

109
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:12,080
Okay.

110
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,650
Does the camera on the MacBook

111
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:14,340
look good?

112
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,020
Do you not look like a potato?

113
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:17,659
The answer is yes.

114
00:02:17,659 --> 00:02:20,439
If you have a good laptop camera,

115
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:21,650
then you're going to do an OBS

116
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,300
GammaDoc.

117
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:24,819
What you're watching right now is

118
00:02:24,819 --> 00:02:26,259
an OBS GammaDoc.

119
00:02:26,259 --> 00:02:28,240
It is so simple to set up.

120
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,569
It's not complicated at

121
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:29,960
all.

122
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,280
Very straightforward.

123
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:31,599
Okay.

124
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,319
So if the answer is yes, I do have

125
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:34,699
a good laptop camera, OBS

126
00:02:34,729 --> 00:02:35,479
GammaDoc.

127
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,840
If you don't have a good laptop

128
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,370
camera, you're going to do a Loom

129
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:39,080
GammaDoc.

130
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:39,599
Okay.

131
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:40,159
Now,

132
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,310
if you have a shitty camera,

133
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:42,610
that's what you're going to do.

134
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:44,180
If you don't have any camera

135
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,030
whatsoever, buy one.

136
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,729
It's 50 bucks on Amazon, maybe

137
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,129
less, 40.

138
00:02:50,129 --> 00:02:52,120
So if you don't have a good

139
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:52,419
quality

140
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:53,449
one, let's say you have a MacBook

141
00:02:53,449 --> 00:02:54,370
and you don't want to spend any

142
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:55,180
money on a good one.

143
00:02:55,219 --> 00:02:56,360
And it's

144
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,500
just like an old MacBook and it

145
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,310
doesn't look good.

146
00:02:58,349 --> 00:02:59,310
Just do a Loom GammaDoc.

147
00:02:59,310 --> 00:02:59,919
It's fine.

148
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:00,229
You'll be a

149
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,240
little circle in the bottom.

150
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:01,509
Okay.

151
00:03:01,509 --> 00:03:02,590
So no one's really going to notice

152
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:03,080
the quality.

153
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,419
Now, if you do have a good camera

154
00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:07,919
setup, okay, you have a DSLR and a

155
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,439
mic.

156
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:10,250
The next question is,

157
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,539
do you have a video editor or do

158
00:03:11,539 --> 00:03:13,650
you want to spend $500 to $1,000

159
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:14,659
on a video editor?

160
00:03:14,699 --> 00:03:16,270
If the answer is no, again, you're

161
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:17,650
just going to do an OBS GammaDoc

162
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:19,120
like what I'm doing right here.

163
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:19,419
Okay.

164
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:20,819
That doesn't require any editing.

165
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:21,710
You guys have seen it.

166
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:22,810
Rough cut, everything.

167
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:23,219
It does not

168
00:03:23,259 --> 00:03:25,069
require a lot of editing here.

169
00:03:25,389 --> 00:03:25,599
Okay.

170
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,780
Now, if you are good on camera, if

171
00:03:27,789 --> 00:03:30,050
you do have a good camera

172
00:03:30,099 --> 00:03:32,009
setup, you have, you know, DSLR, a

173
00:03:32,009 --> 00:03:33,599
mic, all that type of stuff.

174
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:34,319
Guess what?

175
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:35,900
You should do a teleprompter

176
00:03:35,939 --> 00:03:37,030
direct-to-camera video.

177
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:37,310
Why?

178
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:38,460
Because it looks better than

179
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:39,280
everything else.

180
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:39,610
Okay.

181
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:40,469
And I'm going to show

182
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:42,259
you guys examples of this, but we

183
00:03:42,259 --> 00:03:43,710
can get a teleprompter on our

184
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:45,460
phone using teleprompter app.

185
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,210
We can then put that next to our

186
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:49,099
camera or close to our camera.

187
00:03:49,099 --> 00:03:50,960
And so we can then even just film

188
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,400
it on

189
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:52,900
our phone and do it that way.

190
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,520
Or we can just get a teleprompter

191
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,949
set up and we can shoot it that

192
00:03:55,949 --> 00:03:56,340
way.

193
00:03:56,379 --> 00:03:57,810
Now, here's the thing, guys.

194
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:59,259
Out of every hundred people that

195
00:03:59,259 --> 00:04:00,560
watch this video, I would

196
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,020
recommend

197
00:04:01,099 --> 00:04:02,810
that to maybe one or two people.

198
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:04,520
The reason why is because reading

199
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:06,340
a teleprompter is difficult.

200
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:07,379
It's not easy.

201
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:08,939
I have had to coach a lot of

202
00:04:08,939 --> 00:04:10,280
people on how to read a

203
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,219
teleprompter on set,

204
00:04:12,259 --> 00:04:14,210
on shoots, and even people who are

205
00:04:14,419 --> 00:04:15,789
like really good on camera

206
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:17,850
struggle with it because it's not

207
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:17,990
the

208
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:18,920
easiest thing in the world,

209
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,800
especially with pacing and

210
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,879
understanding how to not sound

211
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:21,360
like a robot.

212
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:23,600
So very few of you are going to be

213
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,540
a teleprompter person.

214
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:26,779
Some of you will.

215
00:04:26,779 --> 00:04:27,709
And if you believe

216
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,019
that's the case and you're that

217
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:30,660
person, message me individually.

218
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:31,160
Okay.

219
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,740
And I'll give you some advice

220
00:04:32,779 --> 00:04:33,660
on how to do it.

221
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,360
I don't want to create a six hour

222
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,870
long module or two hour long

223
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:38,029
module or an hour long

224
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:39,410
module on teleprompters.

225
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:39,810
Okay.

226
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:41,120
If you feel like you are that

227
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,750
person though, you have experience

228
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:43,399
with it.

229
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:43,810
Awesome.

230
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:44,850
I'll show you how to set that all

231
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:45,120
up.

232
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,120
I'm going to talk about that in

233
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:47,399
one of the demo videos as well,

234
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,300
very briefly, but in the case that

235
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,279
that's not you.

236
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:52,149
And you're like, no, I don't want

237
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:52,829
to do that.

238
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:53,829
That's too much time.

239
00:04:53,829 --> 00:04:54,819
And I don't want to spend that

240
00:04:54,819 --> 00:04:55,899
much money on a video editor.

241
00:04:55,899 --> 00:04:56,600
Usually someone

242
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:57,959
that's, you know, fairly early in

243
00:04:57,959 --> 00:04:58,449
the offer.

244
00:04:58,449 --> 00:05:00,399
They don't have like 30, $40,000

245
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:01,310
already in revenue.

246
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:02,600
They're not really trying to like

247
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,910
separate themselves from everyone

248
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:04,209
else.

249
00:05:04,209 --> 00:05:04,810
OBS gamma doc.

250
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:05,240
Okay.

251
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:07,089
80 to 90% of you guys, I'm just

252
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:08,660
going to tell you to do the OBS

253
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:09,269
gamma doc.

254
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:10,680
Again, very few of you,

255
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:10,680
I'm going to tell you to do the

256
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:10,680
teleprompter.

257
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:10,680
So that's the way that you figure

258
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:16,040
out which VSL you should do.

259
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:17,029
Look at the flow chart.

260
00:05:17,029 --> 00:05:17,870
Oh, is that easy?

261
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:18,759
Super simple.

262
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:19,560
Most of you guys are going to be

263
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:19,720
doing

264
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:20,540
OBS gamma docs.

265
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:21,850
I'm going to show you how to do

266
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,889
that in this module.

267
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:23,399
Okay.

268
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:28,110
Zoom up of the picture, zoom in.

269
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:30,670
So let's now go shoot some VSL

270
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:31,699
together.

271
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:32,199
I'm going to show you how

272
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,350
to set all this stuff up and how

273
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:34,060
to do everything.

274
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:35,420
And we're going to do that in the

275
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:36,230
demo section of

276
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:37,060
this module.

277
00:05:37,089 --> 00:05:38,279
So that's everything.

278
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,160
All the best.

279
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,800
I'll see you in the demo section.

280
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,480
Bye-bye.
