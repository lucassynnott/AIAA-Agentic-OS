1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:01,550
Are you making this major mistake

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:02,660
with your email list?

3
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:04,509
Hey, here's a guarantee for you.

4
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:06,019
I can transform your

5
00:00:06,019 --> 00:00:08,460
underperforming email list into a

6
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:09,839
powerhouse for engagement,

7
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:10,460
conversions,

8
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,539
and revenue growth inside your

9
00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:14,349
info product business.

10
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:15,220
Sound good?

11
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:15,900
Okay.

12
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:16,940
If that's the case, here's the

13
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:18,059
80-20 of this video.

14
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:19,260
Using my inbox intimacy

15
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:20,800
methodology, I will craft emails

16
00:00:20,969 --> 00:00:22,739
that sound like they came directly

17
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,820
from you based on your content and

18
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:26,789
in-depth interviews that I will

19
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:28,260
conduct with you personally.

20
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:28,800
Okay.

21
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,339
And if you don't see a substantial

22
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:31,309
increase in open rates,

23
00:00:31,309 --> 00:00:32,600
click-throughs, and sales within

24
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:34,460
90 days, I'll refund you in full.

25
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:35,259
Simple as that.

26
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:36,600
So here's a couple of questions

27
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,920
I'd like to ask you, which will

28
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,100
help you know whether or

29
00:00:39,109 --> 00:00:40,210
not this service makes sense for

30
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:40,500
you.

31
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:40,920
Okay.

32
00:00:40,979 --> 00:00:42,359
Number one, are you an info

33
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:44,030
product business owner doing at

34
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:45,759
least 100K a month selling

35
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:46,359
products

36
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,100
ranging from $5,000 to $25,000

37
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:51,039
utilizing a VSL book a call funnel

38
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:52,549
or a low ticket funnel?

39
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:54,299
Or number two, do you feel like

40
00:00:54,299 --> 00:00:56,100
you're overlooking a gold mine in

41
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,899
your email list that you know

42
00:00:57,909 --> 00:00:58,710
you could do a better job of

43
00:00:58,710 --> 00:00:59,240
utilizing?

44
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:00,829
And number three, have you tried

45
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:02,640
working with copywriters, but they

46
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,640
failed to capture your

47
00:01:03,659 --> 00:01:04,879
authentic voice or you've just

48
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,079
been stuck writing the emails

49
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:06,700
yourself?

50
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:08,269
Well, if you answered yes to those

51
00:01:08,269 --> 00:01:09,969
questions, congratulations, you

52
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:11,180
are in the right place.

53
00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:12,480
So what I'd like to do over the

54
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:13,920
next few minutes is explain to you

55
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:15,519
why most businesses' emails

56
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,439
get ignored, which results in a

57
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:19,650
atrociously low attribution rate,

58
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:21,159
open rates, and click-through

59
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:21,519
rates.

60
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:22,040
Okay.

61
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:23,329
And then I'd like to show you how

62
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:24,780
to easily increase your email list

63
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:25,930
engagement and its overall

64
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:26,650
attributed revenue.

65
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,099
And then if you're interested,

66
00:01:28,099 --> 00:01:29,349
I'll show you how I can help if

67
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,480
you don't want to do this

68
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:30,819
yourself.

69
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,370
Now, the reason why people's

70
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:33,980
emails get ignored is actually

71
00:01:34,209 --> 00:01:35,000
pretty simple.

72
00:01:35,019 --> 00:01:36,670
Most email marketing falls flat on

73
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:37,739
its face because it lacks

74
00:01:37,969 --> 00:01:38,959
personalization.

75
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:39,519
Okay.

76
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,670
Sending blanket one size fits all

77
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:43,680
messages simply does not cut it

78
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,540
anymore.

79
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,140
Okay.

80
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:46,650
Your subscribers are bombarded

81
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:48,079
with hundreds of emails per day

82
00:01:48,099 --> 00:01:49,480
that are competing for their

83
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:49,959
attention.

84
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:51,810
And this is why most done-for-you

85
00:01:51,819 --> 00:01:53,769
email services don't work all that

86
00:01:53,769 --> 00:01:54,319
well.

87
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:56,670
They rely on templates, outsourced

88
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:58,840
writers, and a focus on sales over

89
00:01:58,900 --> 00:01:59,579
value.

90
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:01,700
Now, the result for that is emails

91
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,959
that sound robotic, inauthentic,

92
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:05,180
and super spammy.

93
00:02:05,349 --> 00:02:07,230
It's no wonder why the engagement

94
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:08,330
rate plummets.

95
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,990
So what's the solution?

96
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,800
Well, that's a great way for me to

97
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,479
introduce myself to you.

98
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:14,750
My name is Nicholas Verge.

99
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:15,960
I'm a direct response copywriter

100
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,020
who's been in the info product

101
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:18,240
industry for five years now.

102
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,129
And I've been able to produce over

103
00:02:20,129 --> 00:02:22,139
$30 million working with clients

104
00:02:22,139 --> 00:02:23,439
like Alex Jones, Jordan

105
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,629
Belfort, and many other

106
00:02:24,629 --> 00:02:26,180
underground names who are quietly

107
00:02:26,409 --> 00:02:28,039
cleaning up seven to eight figures

108
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:28,389
a year.

109
00:02:28,419 --> 00:02:28,699
Okay.

110
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,409
And one of my main specialties is

111
00:02:30,409 --> 00:02:32,169
writing email newsletters, but not

112
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:33,400
your average run-of-the-mill

113
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:34,909
pitch, pitch, pitch newsletters,

114
00:02:34,909 --> 00:02:35,310
right?

115
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:36,599
My newsletters follow a

116
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:38,430
methodology I created called the

117
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:39,939
inbox intimacy method.

118
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,659
I don't just write your emails.

119
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,460
I immerse myself in your world to

120
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,210
ensure I intimately understand

121
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:47,180
your voice, your expertise,

122
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:48,879
and the way you specifically

123
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:51,240
explain concepts in your industry.

124
00:02:51,259 --> 00:02:52,719
The way I do this is by conducting

125
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:54,210
in-depth interviews with you to

126
00:02:54,219 --> 00:02:55,240
capture your unique

127
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:56,590
perspectives and industry

128
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:57,319
knowledge.

129
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:59,430
And then I transform your insights

130
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:01,180
into compelling emails that

131
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,340
balance educational content with

132
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:04,360
promotional material.

133
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:06,330
And this tactical balance builds

134
00:03:06,389 --> 00:03:08,060
trust while keeping your audience

135
00:03:08,139 --> 00:03:09,419
receptive and actively

136
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:10,789
engaged in your work.

137
00:03:10,819 --> 00:03:12,370
I don't use templates and I don't

138
00:03:12,389 --> 00:03:13,800
work with a ton of people.

139
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:15,289
This is what enables me to craft

140
00:03:15,289 --> 00:03:16,780
high quality, bespoke emails

141
00:03:17,189 --> 00:03:18,439
tailored to you and your audience,

142
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:20,030
which provide a ton of value to

143
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:21,099
your audience.

144
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,020
And this methodology prioritizes

145
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:25,099
building long-term relationships,

146
00:03:25,099 --> 00:03:26,639
not just short-term sales.

147
00:03:26,659 --> 00:03:28,569
Our focus extends beyond the inbox

148
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,379
to create lasting connections

149
00:03:30,379 --> 00:03:32,020
through value exchange.

150
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:33,620
And this is what's going to help

151
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:34,879
you accumulate a way better

152
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:36,580
relationship with your audience,

153
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:38,259
which will result in more sales in

154
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:39,080
the long run.

155
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:40,969
My clients have seen astonishing

156
00:03:40,969 --> 00:03:42,900
results from this methodology, and

157
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,139
I've even included a case study

158
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:45,550
down below showing how one of my

159
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:46,800
clients was able to produce

160
00:03:46,849 --> 00:03:50,199
$930,000 in under a year

161
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:51,449
by utilizing this high-value

162
00:03:51,449 --> 00:03:52,129
methodology.

163
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:54,389
Now, here's one last question for

164
00:03:54,389 --> 00:03:54,819
you.

165
00:03:54,889 --> 00:03:56,250
Do you want to transform your

166
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,919
email marketing by having me write

167
00:03:57,919 --> 00:03:59,400
your emails with my exclusive

168
00:03:59,419 --> 00:04:00,759
inbox intimacy methodology?

169
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,479
And like I said earlier, there's

170
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:03,939
no risk for you because if you

171
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,740
don't see a substantial increase

172
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,439
in open rates, click-throughs, and

173
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:08,979
sales within 90 days, you pay

174
00:04:09,129 --> 00:04:09,629
nothing.

175
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:11,159
So if you're open to exploring the

176
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:12,740
possibility of working with me,

177
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:13,870
there's a button down below

178
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,099
where you can fill out a quick

179
00:04:15,099 --> 00:04:16,470
questionnaire to discuss how we

180
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:17,819
can boost your email marketing

181
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:18,379
performance.

182
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:20,120
And after that, you'll be taken to

183
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,009
a page where you can book a

184
00:04:21,009 --> 00:04:21,879
strategy call with me

185
00:04:21,889 --> 00:04:23,240
to discuss whether or not this

186
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,550
service makes sense for you in

187
00:04:24,589 --> 00:04:25,430
your business.

188
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,180
Okay?

189
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:27,420
I have to state this as well.

190
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:28,920
I only work with three clients at

191
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,160
any given time for this email

192
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:30,920
service.

193
00:04:30,939 --> 00:04:31,860
It's not fake scarcity.

194
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:32,680
That is real.

195
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:34,370
A majority of my income comes from

196
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:36,060
one-on-one coaching, so I do not

197
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:37,339
stack dozens and dozens

198
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:38,339
and dozens of done-for-you

199
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:39,660
projects because I don't have time

200
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:40,079
for it.

201
00:04:40,129 --> 00:04:41,670
So at the time of recording this

202
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,129
video, I only have two spots

203
00:04:43,509 --> 00:04:44,779
remaining for this service.

204
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:46,230
So if you're interested in blowing

205
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:47,519
up your email marketing in a good

206
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:47,839
way,

207
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,709
click the button below to claim

208
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,139
your spot now before availability

209
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:52,139
fills up.

210
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,689
You certainly could do this on

211
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:55,160
your own, writing high-value

212
00:04:55,459 --> 00:04:56,740
emails consistently for your email

213
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:57,990
list, which will take a ton of

214
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:58,759
time to craft.

215
00:04:58,779 --> 00:05:00,550
But let's be honest, do you really

216
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:01,500
want to do that?

217
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,060
Answer is probably no, which is

218
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,250
why you should fill out that

219
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:05,709
questionnaire down below.
