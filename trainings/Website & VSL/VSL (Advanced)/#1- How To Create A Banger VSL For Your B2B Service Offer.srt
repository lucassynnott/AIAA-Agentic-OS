1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:02,000
All righty, ladies and gentlemen,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,970
boys and girls, here we are today

3
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:05,219
talking about how

4
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:07,379
to create a banger VSL for your

5
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:09,179
B2B service offer.

6
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:10,279
Why do you need a VSL?

7
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,660
That's a great question because

8
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,800
it's the best way for you to be

9
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,530
able to scale your offer

10
00:00:16,579 --> 00:00:18,579
to 30K a month, 40K a month, 50K a

11
00:00:18,579 --> 00:00:19,039
month.

12
00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:19,859
Why is that, Nick?

13
00:00:19,899 --> 00:00:21,149
Great question.

14
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:21,879
I'll tell you.

15
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,359
First and foremost, it makes your

16
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:24,429
sales calls a hell of a lot

17
00:00:24,429 --> 00:00:24,870
easier.

18
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,190
People are going to come on your

19
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:26,989
call pre-sold.

20
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,570
Second of all, it makes people

21
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:29,829
actually want to get on a sales

22
00:00:29,829 --> 00:00:31,300
call with you because when

23
00:00:31,339 --> 00:00:32,560
they click on the link in your

24
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,929
cold email or when they look you

25
00:00:33,929 --> 00:00:35,399
up and they find your website

26
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:36,700
and your domain and then they

27
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:38,210
watch the video on there, if it's

28
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:39,420
a really good VSL, guess

29
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:39,630
what?

30
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:40,740
They'll book a call with you.

31
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:41,850
They'll be excited to actually

32
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:42,909
talk with you because they're

33
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,299
like, oh my goodness, this person

34
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:45,340
understands my problems.

35
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:46,520
And on top of that, also, they

36
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:47,600
understand what I want.

37
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,729
And on top of that, they provide a

38
00:00:48,729 --> 00:00:49,820
really good service that I would

39
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:50,200
like.

40
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:50,979
Please take my money.

41
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:52,359
That's how people think.

42
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:54,179
Exactly like that.

43
00:00:54,219 --> 00:00:54,899
Don't quote me.

44
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,270
Now, on top of that, also, guys,

45
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:58,340
this is a great way for you to

46
00:00:58,340 --> 00:00:59,359
separate yourself from

47
00:00:59,399 --> 00:00:59,909
your competition.

48
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,460
There's a lot of people out there

49
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:02,909
that are probably providing the

50
00:01:03,049 --> 00:01:04,260
same service as you.

51
00:01:04,299 --> 00:01:04,640
Okay.

52
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,200
Unless you have some blue ocean

53
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,939
offer, which some of you guys do,

54
00:01:07,939 --> 00:01:09,200
but majority of you guys

55
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:10,219
are selling things that other

56
00:01:10,219 --> 00:01:11,040
people are selling.

57
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:11,959
And your VSL is how you can

58
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:12,989
separate yourself from the

59
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:13,719
competition.

60
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,760
Most people don't even want to get

61
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,209
on camera.

62
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:16,200
They're terrified of getting on

63
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:16,560
camera.

64
00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:17,959
Oh God, people are going to judge

65
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:18,239
me.

66
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,609
Super lame.

67
00:01:19,659 --> 00:01:20,310
Don't be like that.

68
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,219
If you are good on camera, it'll

69
00:01:22,219 --> 00:01:23,480
immediately separate you from

70
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,780
everyone else because you

71
00:01:24,859 --> 00:01:26,200
are a charismatic individual.

72
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:27,510
You should obviously program

73
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:29,079
yourself to thinking like that.

74
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,340
You are a charismatic individual.

75
00:01:30,379 --> 00:01:32,510
And people are more attracted to

76
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:34,280
that than the geek that's...

77
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:37,099
They're a little, sorry, I just

78
00:01:37,099 --> 00:01:39,500
need to send an email out.

79
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:40,620
I can't get on camera.

80
00:01:40,659 --> 00:01:41,769
I would prefer if we kept the

81
00:01:41,769 --> 00:01:43,159
communication through text.

82
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,010
Like, trust me, you will be much

83
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:46,829
more appealing to your audience

84
00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:48,239
when they can see you and

85
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:48,579
understand

86
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:50,129
how you act, right?

87
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:51,250
And how you actually hold

88
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:51,859
yourself.

89
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:52,379
Okay.

90
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:54,680
So let's get started, guys.

91
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:55,920
Let's talk about how to craft a

92
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,329
Bangor VSL for your B2B service

93
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:57,819
offer.

94
00:01:57,859 --> 00:01:59,120
In this module, we're not going to

95
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,400
be diving into the specifics.

96
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:01,109
This is more of like a

97
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:02,569
housekeeping introduction module,

98
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:04,219
but very important you watch it so

99
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:04,340
you

100
00:02:04,379 --> 00:02:04,890
know what's to come.

101
00:02:04,939 --> 00:02:05,260
Okay.

102
00:02:05,299 --> 00:02:07,109
So here's what we're going to be

103
00:02:07,109 --> 00:02:08,979
covering inside this short yet

104
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:10,379
powerful program.

105
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:11,099
Okay.

106
00:02:11,139 --> 00:02:13,080
So what you must do before you

107
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,409
write your VSL script and produce

108
00:02:15,409 --> 00:02:16,340
your VSL.

109
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:16,520
Okay.

110
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,139
Pretty much everyone ignores this

111
00:02:18,139 --> 00:02:19,710
one thing and it's why pretty much

112
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:21,060
everyone else out there sucks.

113
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:21,419
Okay.

114
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:22,770
If you do this one thing, your

115
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:24,219
life will be so much easier.

116
00:02:24,259 --> 00:02:25,900
You are going to come to me in the

117
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,479
messages of Slack instead of

118
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:28,740
client ascension.

119
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,810
And you're going to say, Nick, I

120
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:33,039
cannot believe I tried to market

121
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:35,139
my offer or market my business

122
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,719
any other way than the way that

123
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:38,569
you're going to tell me to do it.

124
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:39,680
And the one thing, which you're

125
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,610
going to find out in the next

126
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:42,280
module, that one thing changed

127
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:43,379
my perspective on how to message

128
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:44,340
and how to market and how to do

129
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:45,020
all that stuff.

130
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:45,360
Right.

131
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,819
So it's what you're going to find

132
00:02:46,819 --> 00:02:48,000
out in the next module.

133
00:02:48,219 --> 00:02:49,449
You're also going to learn how to

134
00:02:49,449 --> 00:02:50,719
write a VSL script that speaks to

135
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:51,860
your prospect's desires

136
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,680
and also their pain points.

137
00:02:53,719 --> 00:02:55,360
And it incentivizes your prospect

138
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,639
to book a call with you.

139
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,009
So we're going to talk about that

140
00:02:58,009 --> 00:02:58,520
as well.

141
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,030
And then on top of that, we're

142
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,759
also going to show you the three

143
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:03,159
different types of VSLs

144
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:04,840
you can produce and how to know

145
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,650
which one is best for you and your

146
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:07,979
personality type.

147
00:03:08,539 --> 00:03:09,960
And here's the thing, guys, I'm

148
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,379
just, I really want you to think

149
00:03:11,379 --> 00:03:12,139
about this.

150
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,150
It should not take you more than

151
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:16,229
one to two days for you to produce

152
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:16,990
your VSL.

153
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:18,180
Okay.

154
00:03:18,219 --> 00:03:19,469
One to two days.

155
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,599
I'm going to prove that to you by

156
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,240
doing exactly that today with you.

157
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,280
I'm going to produce a VSL in a

158
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:26,879
day.

159
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:27,699
Okay.

160
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:28,849
And you're going to see, holy

161
00:03:28,849 --> 00:03:30,280
shit, like the four minute mile.

162
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:31,280
This is totally possible.

163
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:32,719
I promise you it is.

164
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:33,360
It's not hard.

165
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:34,759
People that tell you this needs to

166
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:35,800
take like three weeks and you

167
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,039
really need to dive into it.

168
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,180
Like, nope.

169
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:39,819
It's super simple stuff.

170
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,300
If you've done your work

171
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,319
beforehand and have an offer put

172
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:45,439
together, I mean, you've talked

173
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:45,939
with Daniel.

174
00:03:45,979 --> 00:03:47,360
You've actually been on Daniel's

175
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:47,759
call.

176
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,599
You have your offer.

177
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:49,400
You have your guarantee.

178
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:50,689
This is all really simple going

179
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:51,240
forward.

180
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,520
It's a lot of organization.

181
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,110
If you don't have that yet, I

182
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:55,870
would highly recommend you get

183
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:58,039
that first before we move on to

184
00:03:58,039 --> 00:03:58,599
anything else.

185
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:00,009
If you do not have an offer, if

186
00:04:00,009 --> 00:04:01,520
you do not have a guarantee,

187
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:02,979
it's going to be really hard for

188
00:04:02,979 --> 00:04:04,050
you to get any value from this.

189
00:04:04,099 --> 00:04:05,210
If you do have an offer and you do

190
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:06,590
have a guarantee, you're ready to

191
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:07,319
rock and roll.

192
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,620
So let's keep going.

193
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:12,120
So who am I?

194
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:13,240
Why am I teaching this?

195
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:13,449
Okay.

196
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,340
My name is Nicholas Verge.

197
00:04:15,379 --> 00:04:16,819
I've been a direct response

198
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:18,769
copywriter for five years now.

199
00:04:18,819 --> 00:04:19,139
Okay.

200
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,529
Let's get all fingers in the

201
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:21,170
picture.

202
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,100
Five years now.

203
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:23,600
And I've been in Klein Ascension

204
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:24,459
for a year now.

205
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,620
And I write Daniel's newsletter.

206
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:27,279
Okay.

207
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:28,829
During those five years as a

208
00:04:28,829 --> 00:04:30,639
direct response copywriter,

209
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,529
I've produced right around $30

210
00:04:32,529 --> 00:04:33,959
million for my clients.

211
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,269
It could be 35.

212
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:36,449
Honestly, you lose track after a

213
00:04:36,449 --> 00:04:36,819
while.

214
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,439
But I've produced a metric fuck

215
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:40,180
ton of revenue for my clients.

216
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:42,009
And I've written and produced VSLs

217
00:04:42,009 --> 00:04:43,730
for celebrity clients like Alex

218
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:45,000
Jones, Jordan Belfort,

219
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,279
and many other underground names

220
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:47,199
that you don't know.

221
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,470
But they're quietly cleaning up

222
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:49,779
seven to eight figures a year.

223
00:04:49,819 --> 00:04:50,199
Okay.

224
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,279
So I've done a lot of VSLs.

225
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:53,319
I've done a lot of copywriting.

226
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:54,300
I've done a lot of messaging.

227
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:55,879
I know what I'm doing here.

228
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,079
And I'm really excited to share

229
00:04:57,079 --> 00:04:58,389
all the little secrets and little

230
00:04:58,389 --> 00:04:59,180
things that I know

231
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,439
that's going to get you guys to at

232
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:01,829
least that competency level where

233
00:05:01,829 --> 00:05:02,899
you can do it yourself.

234
00:05:02,939 --> 00:05:03,560
Okay.

235
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,939
And here's the thing, guys.

236
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:06,779
I literally sell VSLs for a

237
00:05:06,779 --> 00:05:07,579
living.

238
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,220
This is what I do.

239
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:10,389
I don't take on a lot of them

240
00:05:10,389 --> 00:05:11,620
because I'm pretty pricey.

241
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:13,769
But, you know, I do like three to

242
00:05:13,769 --> 00:05:15,850
four VSLs a year for a fairly high

243
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:17,279
ticket package.

244
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:18,629
And I've, again, produced just a

245
00:05:18,629 --> 00:05:19,980
disgusting amount of revenue from

246
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:20,269
them.

247
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:21,850
They're a high-end luxury service

248
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:22,300
for me.

249
00:05:22,339 --> 00:05:23,209
And I also coach people on a

250
00:05:23,209 --> 00:05:24,180
one-on-one basis how to do it

251
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:24,819
themselves.

252
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:26,129
So this is my living.

253
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:27,160
This is what I do.

254
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:28,240
And I'm going to show you guys how

255
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:28,860
to do it as well.

256
00:05:28,899 --> 00:05:30,790
So here's some housekeeping

257
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:32,990
information before we dive into

258
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:34,860
all those juicy things that are

259
00:05:34,899 --> 00:05:35,930
going to get you your VSL across

260
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:36,579
the goal line.

261
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:37,060
Okay.

262
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:38,730
First and foremost, our weekly

263
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:39,850
calls as of right now are on

264
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:41,149
Wednesdays at 2 p.m.

265
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:42,779
PST right after Daniel's offer and

266
00:05:42,779 --> 00:05:44,120
strategy coaching call.

267
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:44,420
Okay.

268
00:05:44,459 --> 00:05:45,689
That may change.

269
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:46,939
And if it does, you will be

270
00:05:46,939 --> 00:05:48,160
updated in the Slack.

271
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:48,769
Okay.

272
00:05:48,819 --> 00:05:49,939
Super straightforward there.

273
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:51,579
If you need help or you need

274
00:05:51,579 --> 00:05:53,350
support with your VSL or your

275
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:55,310
script or anything like that,

276
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:57,100
message me individually on Slack.

277
00:05:57,139 --> 00:05:58,399
We can totally review it on the

278
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,160
group calls.

279
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:00,399
If outside of the group calls you

280
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:02,110
would like support, just shoot me

281
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:02,970
a message.

282
00:06:03,019 --> 00:06:04,660
Do not ask questions in the

283
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:05,439
channel.

284
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,220
I will not respond to you.

285
00:06:07,699 --> 00:06:08,339
If you ask questions in the

286
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:09,519
channel, I'm just going to

287
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:11,180
redirect you back to this module.

288
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,649
You're going to say, hey, Nick,

289
00:06:12,649 --> 00:06:13,850
I'm really struggling with

290
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:15,220
crafting the right intro.

291
00:06:15,259 --> 00:06:16,050
And I really think that this will

292
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:16,379
be best.

293
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:16,959
What's your thoughts?

294
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,600
And I'm going to be like, oh,

295
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:17,959
awesome.

296
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,199
And hey, go check out module one

297
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:20,560
minute, whatever this is at right

298
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:20,959
here.

299
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,699
Six minutes and 20 seconds in.

300
00:06:23,459 --> 00:06:24,790
This is the best place for you to

301
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:25,269
start.

302
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:28,939
Send me individual messages.

303
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,449
It's a lot easier for me, guys,

304
00:06:30,449 --> 00:06:32,129
when I don't have 16 different

305
00:06:32,129 --> 00:06:33,740
messages on a group chat and I can

306
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,050
instead see individual messages

307
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:35,930
inside of the Slack.

308
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,970
Slack channel, again, is only

309
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:39,860
intended for updates on calls,

310
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,160
notes, et cetera.

311
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:45,110
Now, guys, we have a zero goose

312
00:06:45,129 --> 00:06:46,009
egg.

313
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:46,899
Say it with me, everyone.

314
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:47,980
Goose egg.

315
00:06:48,019 --> 00:06:50,629
Zero plagiarism tolerance.

316
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,810
On calls, we will be reviewing

317
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:54,519
your VSLs, your scripts.

318
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,569
We'll be talking about your

319
00:06:55,569 --> 00:06:56,009
intros.

320
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:57,089
We'll be talking about stuff, all

321
00:06:57,089 --> 00:06:57,740
that good stuff.

322
00:06:57,779 --> 00:06:59,670
If it turns out that you decided

323
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:01,240
to jack your fellow Klein

324
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,399
Ascension member and you decided

325
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:05,300
to blatantly plagiarize their

326
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,339
script or their VSL or their offer

327
00:07:07,339 --> 00:07:09,000
or whatever it is, and you feel

328
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:10,180
like that's the case, reach out to

329
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:10,439
me.

330
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,720
If you found out that someone did

331
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,040
that to you, reach out to me.

332
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:14,160
I'm going to send the information

333
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,339
to Daniel, and he will handle it.

334
00:07:15,379 --> 00:07:16,740
I have discussed with him what the

335
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:17,660
consequences are.

336
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:19,220
He said don't tell them what the

337
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:21,040
consequences are, but he said that

338
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,509
he will handle it, and I put in

339
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:24,180
parentheses there, not good,

340
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,600
because it's not good.

341
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,899
I'm not going to say what's going

342
00:07:26,899 --> 00:07:28,360
to happen, but not good, okay?

343
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:30,470
So, guys, don't plagiarize

344
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:31,370
someone.

345
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:32,579
Don't jack someone's stuff.

346
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:33,129
That's so lame.

347
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,290
There's infinite ways you can

348
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:35,220
explain your offer.

349
00:07:35,259 --> 00:07:36,300
You do not need to steal your

350
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,629
fellow Klein Ascension members'

351
00:07:37,629 --> 00:07:38,899
stuff, and if you guys feel like

352
00:07:38,899 --> 00:07:40,519
that's happened to you, speak up.

353
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,060
Let me know.

354
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,220
We'll make sure we handle it and

355
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,379
make sure, you know, we actually

356
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:44,170
get to the bottom of it.

357
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,060
So, that is everything, if I

358
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,620
remember correctly.

359
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:48,279
Yep, that's everything.

360
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:49,490
So, that's everything for this

361
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:50,199
module, guys.

362
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,670
We are now going to move on to the

363
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:53,160
next module, which is going to

364
00:07:53,329 --> 00:07:54,759
talk about that one thing that you

365
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:56,300
have to do if you actually want to

366
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,459
put together a good VSL.

367
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,939
So, let's get started.

368
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:02,750
My goodness, I can't find the

369
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:04,019
stop.

370
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:04,480
There we go.
