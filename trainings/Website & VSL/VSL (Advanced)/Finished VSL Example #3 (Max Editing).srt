1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:00,920
Hey, are you trying to navigate

2
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:02,259
the world of digital marketing and

3
00:00:02,259 --> 00:00:03,100
direct response?

4
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,379
Maybe you're a marketer who wants

5
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:05,660
to improve their skillset, or

6
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:06,459
maybe you run a business

7
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:07,900
and you handle all the marketing

8
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:08,519
yourself.

9
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:10,320
If that's the case, you're in the

10
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,199
right place.

11
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:11,599
Okay.

12
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:13,130
I don't want this video to be like

13
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:14,929
a 30 minute long nightmare story

14
00:00:14,929 --> 00:00:16,039
VSL or anything like

15
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:16,370
that.

16
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:17,620
So let me just cut to the chase.

17
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:18,870
I'm recording this video for you

18
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:19,879
to help you navigate

19
00:00:19,899 --> 00:00:20,530
my homepage.

20
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:20,870
Okay.

21
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:22,379
But first things first, who am I?

22
00:00:22,379 --> 00:00:23,719
Why should you listen to me?

23
00:00:23,739 --> 00:00:24,710
My name is Nicholas Verge.

24
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:25,829
I've been in the world of digital

25
00:00:25,829 --> 00:00:27,379
marketing for five years now

26
00:00:27,399 --> 00:00:28,929
as a direct response copywriter.

27
00:00:28,929 --> 00:00:30,160
During my career, I've been

28
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,469
directly responsible for

29
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,840
producing right around $30 million

30
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:33,560
in client results.

31
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:34,520
And I've had the privilege of

32
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:34,880
working

33
00:00:34,899 --> 00:00:36,380
with all sorts of clients from

34
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:38,130
celebrity ones like Alex Jones and

35
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:39,539
Jordan Belfort to the ones

36
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:40,840
who behind the scenes are keeping

37
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:41,990
it low key and they're quietly

38
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:43,060
cleaning up seven to eight

39
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:43,880
figures a month.

40
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,359
Now I've worked on everything from

41
00:00:45,369 --> 00:00:46,820
email automations to video sales

42
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:47,280
letters.

43
00:00:47,299 --> 00:00:48,799
And I've worked with a wide range

44
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:50,159
of clients from the physical

45
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:51,420
product world to the info

46
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:52,229
product world.

47
00:00:52,229 --> 00:00:53,539
I've been able to dedicate my

48
00:00:53,539 --> 00:00:55,009
career to figuring out the world

49
00:00:55,009 --> 00:00:55,600
of digital

50
00:00:55,619 --> 00:00:56,950
marketing, specifically direct

51
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:58,000
response, copyright.

52
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,439
And that's what I'd like to help

53
00:00:59,439 --> 00:00:59,689
you with.

54
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:01,259
And there's two ways I can help

55
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:01,700
you.

56
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:01,899
Okay.

57
00:01:01,899 --> 00:01:03,600
So there's a done for you capacity

58
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,099
and there's

59
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,099
a do it yourself format as well.

60
00:01:06,099 --> 00:01:06,989
If you're interested in finding

61
00:01:06,989 --> 00:01:07,969
out more about what it would look

62
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,010
like for me to come into your

63
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:10,170
business and help you optimize

64
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:11,599
your existing marketing systems

65
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:13,099
or help you create new ones.

66
00:01:13,099 --> 00:01:14,609
There's a section right below this

67
00:01:14,609 --> 00:01:15,819
video titled agency.

68
00:01:15,819 --> 00:01:16,219
All you

69
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:17,370
got to do is click that you'll be

70
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:18,569
taken to a separate page with the

71
00:01:18,569 --> 00:01:19,299
video to watch.

72
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:20,379
That's going to show you next

73
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:21,659
steps for having a one on one

74
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:22,700
discovery session with me.

75
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:24,849
Now my done for you services are

76
00:01:24,849 --> 00:01:25,799
not cheap.

77
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:27,640
In fact, they are reassuringly

78
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,700
expensive and my

79
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:31,540
packages start at $20,000 all the

80
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:33,200
way up to $50,000.

81
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,579
And my retainers start at $5,000 a

82
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:35,760
month

83
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:37,129
and move all the way up to $15,000

84
00:01:37,129 --> 00:01:37,500
a month.

85
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,560
So if you're not comfortable

86
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,599
paying those kinds of rates

87
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:40,870
for a consultant to come in and

88
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:42,400
improve your business's ability to

89
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,579
bring in new customers,

90
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:45,439
well, probably it's not for you.

91
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,790
However, the products and courses

92
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:47,799
section could be pretty good

93
00:01:47,819 --> 00:01:48,790
for you.

94
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:50,109
Unlike a lot of online gurus who

95
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,430
make courses that are vague and

96
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:52,480
filled with nothing.

97
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,420
I like to pride myself on making

98
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:54,959
extremely high quality courses

99
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:56,340
that are better than most

100
00:01:56,359 --> 00:01:57,859
people's group coaching programs.

101
00:01:57,859 --> 00:01:58,900
Okay.

102
00:01:58,900 --> 00:01:59,980
It's really high quality stuff.

103
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:00,480
So you may want to

104
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,359
check that out as well.

105
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:03,060
But this video is not a sales

106
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,450
pitch for my programs or for

107
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:04,849
anything

108
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:05,299
like that.

109
00:02:05,299 --> 00:02:06,219
It's to help you navigate my

110
00:02:06,219 --> 00:02:06,640
website.

111
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,829
So if you're a business owner who

112
00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:08,460

Okay.

134
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:32,500
That's a brief introduction to me

135
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,340
and what I got going

136
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,330

137
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:35,689

All the best.

140
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:37,560
Bye now.
