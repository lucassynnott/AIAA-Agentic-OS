1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,000
Alrighty guys, I'm going to show

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,919
you how to set up GammaDoc in OBS

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:05,629
so it looks super, super crispy.

4
00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:07,259
So we're in OBS right now.

5
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:08,039
I'm going to start here.

6
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:09,240
I'll even just go ahead and delete

7
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:09,460
this

8
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:10,449
so we can start absolutely from

9
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:10,880
scratch.

10
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:11,839
I just wanted you to be able to

11
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:12,380
see my face.

12
00:00:12,419 --> 00:00:13,769
It makes sense to have two videos

13
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:14,060
on.

14
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:15,869
So you're in OBS right now.

15
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:16,219
Okay.

16
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:17,339
What you're going to do

17
00:00:17,379 --> 00:00:18,320
is you have a new scene.

18
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,539
You can even, let's just start

19
00:00:19,539 --> 00:00:21,260
from absolute scratch so you guys

20
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:21,760
feel like

21
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,879
you're actually learning, right?

22
00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:25,780
So we're going to have one scene.

23
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:26,250
Okay.

24
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:26,960
New scene.

25
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:27,559
Okay.

26
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,000
And you

27
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:28,820
make this.

28
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:29,339
Okay.

29
00:00:29,339 --> 00:00:31,050
Now what we do is we click this

30
00:00:31,219 --> 00:00:33,340
little plus here, click plus.

31
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:35,679
Then we go to video

32
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:36,899
capture device.

33
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:37,429
Okay.

34
00:00:37,429 --> 00:00:39,469
I'm going to call this camera.

35
00:00:39,469 --> 00:00:39,990
Okay.

36
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,000
You then choose the device.

37
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,420
Mine is called

38
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:44,399
the ZV-E10.

39
00:00:44,549 --> 00:00:46,219
Notice if you use the ultra fine

40
00:00:46,219 --> 00:00:48,109
camera display, it doesn't look

41
00:00:48,109 --> 00:00:49,270
good unless you have a

42
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:50,829
really nice iPad or a Mac book

43
00:00:50,829 --> 00:00:51,859
camera like I do.

44
00:00:51,859 --> 00:00:53,590
This kind of looks half decent,

45
00:00:53,619 --> 00:00:54,780
but at the same time,

46
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:55,770
I don't really feel like this

47
00:00:55,899 --> 00:00:56,689
looks all that good.

48
00:00:56,689 --> 00:00:57,829
Uh, I think that it's starting

49
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:58,270
from over

50
00:00:58,380 --> 00:00:58,969
here too.

51
00:00:58,969 --> 00:01:00,560
So it's my LG ultra fine display

52
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:01,159
camera.

53
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:03,109
You can use the FaceTime camera.

54
00:01:03,109 --> 00:01:04,579
I don't really feel

55
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:06,370
like that is the best thing.

56
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:07,629
It's not bad, right?

57
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:09,620
It's not bad, but look how much

58
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:10,859
crispier this looks.

59
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:12,920
That looks so much crispier.

60
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,790
Impressive.

61
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:16,390
Very nice.

62
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:17,840
So I hit, okay.

63
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,519
Look guys, if you really need to

64
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:19,859
do it,

65
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:20,569
FaceTime's fine.

66
00:01:20,569 --> 00:01:21,400
Like I'll do it even with

67
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,519
FaceTime, just cause all of you

68
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:23,180
guys are going to have

69
00:01:23,219 --> 00:01:24,040
FaceTime for the most part.

70
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:24,930
You can see this doesn't look as

71
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:26,579
good as the other one, but all you

72
00:01:26,579 --> 00:01:26,670
got to

73
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,019
do is hit this hit option.

74
00:01:28,019 --> 00:01:29,659
I'm hitting option right now, and

75
00:01:29,659 --> 00:01:30,900
I'm going to crop it in right

76
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:31,450
here.

77
00:01:31,469 --> 00:01:32,400
Option

78
00:01:32,819 --> 00:01:35,000
crop it in right here.

79
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:35,890
Okay.

80
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:38,659
So you can see now, Hey, look at

81
00:01:38,659 --> 00:01:39,359
that.

82
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:41,799
I'm here and I'm on a FaceTime

83
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,459
camera and I have the lights on

84
00:01:43,459 --> 00:01:45,120
lights are a little bright.

85
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,780
So I'm going to turn them down a

86
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:47,310
sec.

87
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:47,879
One sec.

88
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:48,540
There we go.

89
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:49,989
So you can see it works just fine

90
00:01:49,989 --> 00:01:51,400
with the FaceTime camera.

91
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,659
Um, it doesn't look

92
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,099
as good though, as the other one,

93
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:55,459
which I'm going to show you right

94
00:01:55,459 --> 00:01:55,709
now.

95
00:01:55,859 --> 00:01:57,939
If I do another video capture,

96
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:59,280
where's the video capture?

97
00:01:59,280 --> 00:01:59,900
There we go.

98
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,420
Another video capture device.

99
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:02,640
I'm going to go camera.

100
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:04,900
Good one.

101
00:02:05,049 --> 00:02:05,739
Okay.

102
00:02:05,739 --> 00:02:08,810
And then I go and I hit ZVE 10.

103
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:11,580
You can see in my opinion, this

104
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:12,759
looks, let's just do the

105
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:14,360
same thing.

106
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,789
Option, cut it, cut it side by

107
00:02:17,789 --> 00:02:18,800
side.

108
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,219
In my opinion, this looks way

109
00:02:21,219 --> 00:02:23,219
better than this one.

110
00:02:23,259 --> 00:02:24,210
Now you may say, Hey, no, it

111
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:24,800
doesn't Nick.

112
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,789
I think this one's better.

113
00:02:25,789 --> 00:02:26,069
Okay.

114
00:02:26,069 --> 00:02:27,240
Well that's subjective.

115
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,400
So I like this one.

116
00:02:28,409 --> 00:02:29,539
It looks better to me.

117
00:02:29,539 --> 00:02:30,800
So what I'm going to do is I'm

118
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,939
going to delete this

119
00:02:31,979 --> 00:02:33,360
FaceTime camera one, just showing

120
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:34,539
you guys that you can do it with

121
00:02:34,539 --> 00:02:36,110
FaceTime camera and delete that.

122
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:36,599
Yes.

123
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:37,900
I wish to delete it.

124
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,930
And then we're going to go here.

125
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:40,430
Okay.

126
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:42,419
And as you can see, the camera is

127
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:43,259
right here.

128
00:02:43,259 --> 00:02:45,000
So I'm going to pull in a little

129
00:02:45,009 --> 00:02:45,430
bit.

130
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:47,250
So I'm a little bit more on it.

131
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,240
And now what I need

132
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,699
to do is I need to fill this other

133
00:02:49,729 --> 00:02:50,740
side of the screen.

134
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:51,139
Okay.

135
00:02:51,139 --> 00:02:52,900
And so what I'm going to do is I'm

136
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:53,060
going

137
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:55,289
to go to window capture, hit that

138
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:55,849
hit.

139
00:02:55,849 --> 00:02:56,419
Okay.

140
00:02:56,419 --> 00:02:58,610
And then what's the window that I

141
00:02:58,639 --> 00:02:59,319
want?

142
00:02:59,319 --> 00:02:59,889
Well,

143
00:02:59,939 --> 00:03:01,740
as you guys can see, there's a lot

144
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:03,819
of different windows that we have.

145
00:03:03,819 --> 00:03:05,180
And I don't think that we

146
00:03:05,219 --> 00:03:06,629
need to do that, but we need to do

147
00:03:06,669 --> 00:03:07,919
is not necessarily that.

148
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:09,300
Let me grab it real quick.

149
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:09,620
One sec.

150
00:03:09,659 --> 00:03:10,610
All right, here we go.

151
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:11,849
So we have the display capture

152
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:12,270
open.

153
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:13,520
So I just put this on my other

154
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,039
display.

155
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,020
I have it happen.

156
00:03:15,169 --> 00:03:16,889
Sometimes we're like the windows

157
00:03:16,889 --> 00:03:17,719
won't pop up.

158
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:19,219
Oftentimes you just need to

159
00:03:19,219 --> 00:03:19,530
restart

160
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:20,810
the computer.

161
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:23,150
Like if, if you didn't have OBS

162
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:25,590
open to start and you had the tabs

163
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:26,699
open first and

164
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:27,990
then do OBS, sometimes it doesn't

165
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:28,539
register it.

166
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,580
So I just did it where I put it

167
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:30,189
over on my other

168
00:03:30,259 --> 00:03:30,620
monitor.

169
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:31,819
If you don't have another monitor,

170
00:03:31,819 --> 00:03:32,939
just Google it, figure it out.

171
00:03:32,939 --> 00:03:33,710
You'll figure it out.

172
00:03:33,819 --> 00:03:35,060
I promise you guys, you're smart

173
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:35,800
enough for that.

174
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,969
So what I'm going to do now is I'm

175
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,539
going to take

176
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:38,409
this, right?

177
00:03:38,409 --> 00:03:40,090
And we're going to make this fit

178
00:03:40,099 --> 00:03:44,389
in our footage.

179
00:03:44,389 --> 00:03:44,699
Okay.

180
00:03:44,699 --> 00:03:45,560
So here we go.

181
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,699
So I want to make

182
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,930
this a little bit bigger right

183
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:49,750
there.

184
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:50,879
There we go.

185
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:52,719
And so you can see as I go

186
00:03:52,729 --> 00:03:54,259
through, let's just test

187
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,110
real quick.

188
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,020
Look at that.

189
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:56,479
Okay.

190
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,639
Everything fits, but there's this

191
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:00,900
like unnecessary gap right here.

192
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:01,330
Right.

193
00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:02,379
So let's bring this back over

194
00:04:02,469 --> 00:04:02,710
here.

195
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:03,969
So there's just this unnecessary

196
00:04:03,969 --> 00:04:04,360
back.

197
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:04,680
So what I'm

198
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:06,060
going to do is I'm going to go

199
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:06,580
option.

200
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,979
I'm going to crop this in.

201
00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:08,400
Okay.

202
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,780
I'm going to crop this in a

203
00:04:09,819 --> 00:04:10,080
bit.

204
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:11,229
We can still see if we go back

205
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:12,719
that everything's not getting cut

206
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:13,020
off.

207
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,159
Nothing's getting cut off

208
00:04:14,509 --> 00:04:14,770
here.

209
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:15,379
Okay.

210
00:04:15,379 --> 00:04:17,649
So now what we can do, let's come

211
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:18,670
back here.

212
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:21,170
We can expand this a little bit.

213
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,259
Okay.

214
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:23,379
So where you see these striped

215
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,610
lines right here, this is where

216
00:04:24,709 --> 00:04:25,720
you're getting cut off.

217
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,269
So this is fine

218
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,050
right up until here.

219
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:31,259
I think even cutting this in a

220
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:34,079
little bit more, cutting this in a

221
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:34,860
little bit

222
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,459
more, we can make it a little bit

223
00:04:37,459 --> 00:04:39,000
bigger, right?

224
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,920
So now we go and we can see

225
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,779
nothing's getting cut

226
00:04:42,819 --> 00:04:43,160
off.

227
00:04:43,209 --> 00:04:44,779
Nothing's going to cut off.

228
00:04:44,779 --> 00:04:45,149
Right.

229
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:47,029
So now you can see, okay, Hey,

230
00:04:47,029 --> 00:04:48,959
this looks good, but look at this.

231
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,949
You got this little purple bar

232
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:50,610
right there.

233
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:51,720
It doesn't look that good.

234
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,560
And we got a black

235
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:53,000
background.

236
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,920
That doesn't look that good.

237
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,449
Well, guys, it's super easy to

238
00:04:55,449 --> 00:04:55,839
fix.

239
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:56,160
So here's what we're

240
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:56,569
going to do.

241
00:04:56,589 --> 00:04:57,360
We're going to go to display

242
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:57,699
capture.

243
00:04:57,699 --> 00:04:59,139
We're going to go here.

244
00:04:59,139 --> 00:05:00,879
Okay.

245
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:01,600
So we're going to

246
00:05:02,019 --> 00:05:02,730
properties right here.

247
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:03,120
Okay.

248
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:03,649
Crop.

249
00:05:03,649 --> 00:05:05,959
Well, actually you don't even need

250
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:07,199
to do the crop that way.

251
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:07,279
You

252
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:08,269
can just do it this way.

253
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:09,800
So you can go option and then just

254
00:05:09,819 --> 00:05:11,279
put it up a little bit, right?

255
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:11,589
No more

256
00:05:12,019 --> 00:05:14,300
little purple bar from the, um,

257
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:17,149
uh, from the, the monitor and from

258
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:18,709
the actual tab.

259
00:05:18,709 --> 00:05:19,180
And so now

260
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,279
what I need to do though, is I

261
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:21,420
need to make the background the

262
00:05:21,649 --> 00:05:22,250
same color as this.

263
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:22,639
Okay.

264
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:22,879
So what

265
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,329
we're going to do is we're going

266
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:25,910
to click this and then we're going

267
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:27,600
to go color source and go, okay.

268
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:28,100
Okay.

269
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,730
And what we're going to do is

270
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:30,879
we're going to select the color.

271
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:31,769
We're going to make this white

272
00:05:32,259 --> 00:05:33,339
because I chose white.

273
00:05:33,339 --> 00:05:33,800
Okay.

274
00:05:33,829 --> 00:05:35,860
And then here's the thing though,

275
00:05:35,899 --> 00:05:39,519
guys, is we need to make this

276
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,439
fit right here.

277
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:42,160
And so we're going to go option,

278
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,920
keep it right here.

279
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,839
Boom.

280
00:05:44,899 --> 00:05:46,750
There we go.

281
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,279
And we need

282
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:49,389
to make this fit right here.

283
00:05:49,389 --> 00:05:50,569
So there we go.

284
00:05:50,569 --> 00:05:51,160
Okay.

285
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,600
And now look, you could see, oh,

286
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,399
hey, Nick,

287
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:55,529
that's not the same color.

288
00:05:55,529 --> 00:05:56,629
You're absolutely right.

289
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,680
So we're going to go here.

290
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,399
We're going to go select

291
00:05:58,439 --> 00:05:59,389
color and look at this.

292
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:00,949
We have this little dropper right

293
00:06:00,949 --> 00:06:01,310
here.

294
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:02,399
So we can pick the exact

295
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:04,519
shade of white and then we could

296
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:05,449
say, okay.

297
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:08,040
And so as you can see now, look at

298
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,680
how good that looks,

299
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,360
how to create a banger VSL for

300
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,120
your B2B service offer.

301
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,199
Bing, bong, bing.

302
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:17,990
And I can go through

303
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,939
my slides like that.

304
00:06:18,939 --> 00:06:20,120
Isn't that look amazing.

305
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,480
It doesn't look amazing guys.

306
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,529
It's amazing, right?

307
00:06:22,579 --> 00:06:23,120
Wow.

308
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,339
So super easy to set this stuff up

309
00:06:25,339 --> 00:06:26,000
guys.

310
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,759
I think that this looks way better

311
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:28,319
than a loom.

312
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,699
If you're shy on camera and you

313
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:31,319
don't want to have your face front

314
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:32,639
and center and you're kind

315
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,899
of a baby, right?

316
00:06:33,899 --> 00:06:34,560
Shucks.

317
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,500
But you know, I think that it's

318
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,910
the best way to do it.

319
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:38,959
And look guys,

320
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,829
even if I were to do it with

321
00:06:39,829 --> 00:06:41,040
FaceTime, it's still look good,

322
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:41,329
right?

323
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,720
It's, it's going to look better

324
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:43,689
than a loom because everyone's

325
00:06:43,689 --> 00:06:44,269
doing it on loom.

326
00:06:44,269 --> 00:06:44,889
You don't know BS.

327
00:06:44,889 --> 00:06:45,769
You're going to stand out a

328
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:46,560
little bit more.

329
00:06:46,579 --> 00:06:46,839
Okay.

330
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:47,860
And people like when they can

331
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:48,970
actually see you, they know that

332
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:49,759
you're actually

333
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,740
a human being.

334
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:52,810
You're not just like hiding.

335
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:53,519
Okay.

336
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:55,680
So guys, that is everything for

337
00:06:55,769 --> 00:06:56,319
today.

338
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:57,680
So super simple.

339
00:06:58,439 --> 00:06:59,600
Another thing I would recommend is

340
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,000
if you have your mic, like me,

341
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,800
like if you have a Shure,

342
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,730
if you have anything like that,

343
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:06,589
you also want to go ahead and add

344
00:07:06,589 --> 00:07:08,480
in an audio device.

345
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:08,720
So you're going

346
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:11,509
to go audio input capture, click.

347
00:07:11,509 --> 00:07:12,139
Okay.

348
00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:13,220
Same thing.

349
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:15,750
So mine's the Scarlet solo USB.

350
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:17,120
Okay.

351
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,910
And then the only other thing I

352
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:20,910
would do here guys is this, if you

353
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:23,759
go to properties or not on

354
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:24,079
property,

355
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,360
sorry, right here, this little

356
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,459
gears right here, you can see

357
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:27,569
there's this thing right here

358
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:28,560
where it says

359
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,790
audio input capture, right?

360
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,730
Um, what you want to do is you

361
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:34,279
want to make that mono.

362
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:35,120
I don't know why,

363
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,100
but for some, I'm not an audio

364
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,160
person, but for some reason it

365
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,319
makes it where only audio is

366
00:07:38,339 --> 00:07:38,480
coming

367
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:39,930
out of the left side.

368
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:41,920
So we then also have this right

369
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,269
here though, this mic aux.

370
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:44,959
And so what we

371
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,939
want to do is we want to remove

372
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:46,350
this.

373
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:47,180
This is the mic from your

374
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:47,839
computer.

375
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:49,360
And so what we're going to do

376
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:50,589
is you're going to take this mic

377
00:07:50,589 --> 00:07:53,720
aux, and we're going to lower it

378
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,720
all the way down.

379
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,800
So it will never

380
00:07:56,839 --> 00:07:57,360
pop up.

381
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,029
All we're going to have is just

382
00:07:59,329 --> 00:08:01,329
the audio from our, uh, microphone

383
00:08:01,379 --> 00:08:02,600
popping up here.

384
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:03,759
So super

385
00:08:03,829 --> 00:08:04,449
simple guys.

386
00:08:04,449 --> 00:08:05,680
You can set this up in a couple

387
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,240
minutes.

388
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:07,829
I don't even do this for a living.

389
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:08,829
I'm not a tech person.

390
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:09,720
I'm really not.

391
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,860
As you can see, I was like

392
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,240
figuring out as I go here,

393
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:12,910
it's very easy.

394
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:14,079
I've recorded videos like this

395
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,040
every single time.

396
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:15,730
I'm like, oh, I forgot about

397
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,209
this for ever that super simple.

398
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:17,579
Okay.

399
00:08:17,579 --> 00:08:18,430
But it's not hard.

400
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:19,790
So hopefully you guys found this

401
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:20,399
useful.

402
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,819
This is how you make a OBS camera,

403
00:08:22,939 --> 00:08:25,250
uh, set up with your gamma doc.

404
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:27,120
So let's get started.
