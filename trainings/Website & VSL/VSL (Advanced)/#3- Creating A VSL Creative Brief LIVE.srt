are some reasons i should believe

85
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,030
you it doesn't necessarily need to

86
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:13,189
be

87
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,219
just case studies and testimonials

88
00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:17,099
those are very useful but we could

89
00:02:17,139 --> 00:02:19,360
just use for instance statistics

90
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,270
data stuff like that okay the

91
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:23,240

96
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:30,960
someone buy from you what is the

97
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,199
sales

98
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,430
argument this is going to be like

99
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:33,699
your first piece of copy this will

100
00:02:33,699 --> 00:02:35,199
usually translate directly over to

101
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,580
your vsl and then customer

102
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:38,219

00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,280
potential

109
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:46,710
questions what are some potential

110
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:47,870
questions we could ask our

111
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,439
prospects which would elicit them

112
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:49,759
to think

113
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,590

um i have a very high level of

132
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,659
friction with

133
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:25,289

145
00:03:45,789 --> 00:03:46,560
manually

146
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:48,860

147
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:51,669

148
00:03:51,699 --> 00:03:53,120

150
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,000
is going to make everything way

151
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:58,389
faster okay so what you want to

152
00:03:58,439 --> 00:03:59,759
do is you want to get this tool

153
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:01,199
right here okay this is called

have it just like i do

159
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:09,780
and you can see the first question

160
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:11,030
is describing your client's

161
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:12,789
current situation okay so what i'm

162
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,659
going to do is i'm going to

163
00:04:13,659 --> 00:04:14,610
describe the clearance the

164
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:15,680
client's current situation

165
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:20,800
my ideal client is an info product

166
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,709
business owner who sells courses

167
00:04:23,709 --> 00:04:25,750
and coaching services

168
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,480
and is doing a minimum of 100 to

169
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:32,329
200 grand a month they are running

170
00:04:32,329 --> 00:04:34,699
paid ads to acquire customers

171
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:36,699
and as a result they are

172
00:04:36,699 --> 00:04:38,670
collecting leads which they then

173
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:41,040
follow up with through setters and

174
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:41,189
the

175
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,060
setters set appointments for the

176
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:44,639
closers who close the deals

177
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,660
their service or product ranges

178
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:54,720
from five thousand to twenty five

179
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,660
thousand dollars

180
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,100
and they primarily use a vsl book

181
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:13,389
a call funnel along with ascension

182
00:05:13,529 --> 00:05:16,060
funnels

183
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:25,279
to get people on sales calls

184
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:30,720
since they are accumulating leads

185
00:05:31,069 --> 00:05:34,879
from their advertising efforts

186
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:39,920
they have a large list of emails

187
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,550
these are people who expressed

188
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,600
interest in the product or service

189
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,779
but did not book a call or booked

190
00:05:49,779 --> 00:05:51,420
a call but were not ready to buy

191
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:51,680
yet

192
00:05:52,360 --> 00:06:02,189
so the reason why i'm not talking

193
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:02,920
to you during that is because

194
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,000
it'll pick it up on that

195
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,459
so here's a pretty good summary of

196
00:06:06,459 --> 00:06:09,589
this person's business okay and

197
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,660
i'm explaining their current

198
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,949
situation right who is my ideal

199
00:06:13,949 --> 00:06:15,439
client avatar it's not going to be

200
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:16,220
someone that has

201
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:18,290
email marketing down pat it's

202
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:19,680
going to be that they're not doing

203
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,639
everything they could

204
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,120
with their email list and or

205
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,209
they're having to do everything

206
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,680
themselves they know that there's

207
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,920
a lot of power in their email list

208
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,120
they know there's a lot of money

209
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:28,879
to be made there and

210
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,560
it's a great nurturing mechanism

211
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,439
however they just don't have the

212
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:33,670
time to do it okay

213
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,930
so i'm just going to go back and

214
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:36,449
explain that real quick to them to

215
00:06:36,449 --> 00:06:37,199
chat hippie team

216
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,939
i'm just going to edit some things

217
00:06:42,949 --> 00:06:45,079
here right 200k month they're

218
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:45,920
running paid ads to acquire

219
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,319
customers

220
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,350
as a result they're collecting

221
00:06:47,389 --> 00:06:48,500
leads and which they then follow

222
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,680
up with through setters and the

223
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,529
setter set appointments phone

224
00:06:51,529 --> 00:06:53,069
setters and the setter set

225
00:06:53,069 --> 00:06:55,120
appointments for the closers who

226
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:55,360
close the

227
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:57,569
deals their service or product

228
00:06:57,569 --> 00:06:59,610
ranges products services or

229
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:02,399
products range from five thousand

230
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:02,709
to twenty

231
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:04,980
five thousand dollars right and

232
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:07,199
they primarily use a vsl uh book a

233
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,279
call funnel along with ascension

234
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:10,660
funnels low ticket ebook courses

235
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,079
to get people on sales calls since

236
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:13,519
they're chameleon leads from their

237
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,899
advertising efforts they have a

238
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,209
large list of emails these are

239
00:07:16,209 --> 00:07:17,670
people who express interest in the

240
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:18,000
product

241
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,430
or service but did not book a call

242
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:22,089
or booked a call okay the offer

243
00:07:22,089 --> 00:07:27,680
owner knows that they can extract

244
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,529
more revenue and more book calls

245
00:07:30,529 --> 00:07:33,589
from their email list however they

246
00:07:33,589 --> 00:07:36,620
are either having to write the

247
00:07:36,649 --> 00:07:37,120
emails

248
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,209
themselves which is more on their

249
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,350
plate than they would like to deal

250
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:43,180
with comma or they ignore the

251
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:43,600
emails

252
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:45,689
entirely and as a result miss out

253
00:07:45,689 --> 00:07:47,779
on the potential opportunity to

254
00:07:47,779 --> 00:07:49,600
extract as much revenue as

255
00:07:49,629 --> 00:07:50,079
possible

256
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:55,910
they've hired copywriters in the

257
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:58,480
past but the copywriter was never

258
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,949
able to hit the voice of the

259
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:02,649
business owner

260
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:07,420
and always produced spammy

261
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,810
emails which sounded like a

262
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:14,000
copywriter wrote them

263
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:22,410
the emails were entirely based on

264
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:24,250
pitching the product and the

265
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,870
business owner more than likely

266
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:26,399
saw

267
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:29,350
a drop in results after an initial

268
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:33,830
spike from trying to recover dead

269
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:36,158
leads that were on the list

270
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:41,019
the reason that drop off happened

271
00:08:41,019 --> 00:08:43,429
is because they milked the list

272
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:46,730
dry and as a result nobody

273
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:52,309
very few people

274
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,480
remain on the list who want to buy

275
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,840
comma and a majority of people

276
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,360
stopped reading the emails because

277
00:08:59,360 --> 00:08:59,679
there was

278
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,559
no value in them

279
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:04,620
the business owner the business

280
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,629
owner would like to pour more

281
00:09:05,629 --> 00:09:06,799
value into their email list as

282
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:07,139
they know

283
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,340
that it is a amazing tool for

284
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,159
nurture

285
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,929
however they don't have the time

286
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:16,159
for it and they don't have the

287
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:18,259
trust in hiring someone else

288
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,720
because they feel like it is only

289
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:20,820
going to ruin their brand

290
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:21,440
reputation

291
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,940
okay so notice how specific this

292
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:30,149
is okay this is very very specific

293
00:09:30,149 --> 00:09:31,679
that's because i'm selling this to

294
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,110
a very specific person like i said

295
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:34,809
earlier i don't want to sell this

296
00:09:34,809 --> 00:09:36,220
to everyone this is not for

297
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:37,379
everyone i don't want to sell this

298
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:38,539
to the guy who's perfectly cool

299
00:09:38,539 --> 00:09:39,919
with pitching every single email

300
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,059
that's not my client it's not my

301
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,399
customer it's not the person i'm

302
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,679
going to enjoy working with all

303
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:43,799
that

304
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:45,659
much i want to work with people

305
00:09:45,659 --> 00:09:47,809
who enjoy providing value to their

306
00:09:47,809 --> 00:09:48,879
audience and so

307
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,289
what i'm going to do is i'm going

308
00:09:51,379 --> 00:09:52,750
to send this to chat gpt and then

309
00:09:52,769 --> 00:09:54,159
it's going to say okay and it's

310
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,590
going to go do whatever and so now

311
00:09:55,669 --> 00:09:59,139
i can go and take these questions

312
00:09:59,139 --> 00:10:02,570
and feed it to it yes yes yes

313
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,710
so now i can go describe my

314
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:14,679
client's current situation and

315
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:19,340
then make sure to speak from the

316
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:33,360
first person perspective okay

317
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:39,350
so here we can see it's now

318
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,559
speaking from the first person

319
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:41,190
perspective it's like

320
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,340
the person actually saying hey

321
00:10:42,409 --> 00:10:43,639
here's what my problems are so we

322
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:44,879
can put this in a quote

323
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:45,909
i use a mix of marketing

324
00:10:45,909 --> 00:10:47,570
strategies including the vsl book

325
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:48,720
calls and essential photos from

326
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:48,960
lower

327
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,049
ticket items like ebooks and

328
00:10:50,059 --> 00:10:51,519
courses this approach effectively

329
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,639
gathered is a large email list of

330
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:53,629
potential customers who've shown

331
00:10:53,629 --> 00:10:54,629
interest but haven't committed to

332
00:10:54,629 --> 00:10:55,600
a call or purchase my challenge

333
00:10:55,639 --> 00:10:56,620
lies in maximizing the potential

334
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,250
this email list i'm aware of its

335
00:10:58,250 --> 00:10:59,840
value and generating more revenue

336
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:01,149
and booking calls but managing

337
00:11:01,149 --> 00:11:02,559
effectively has been a struggle

338
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:03,919
writing emails myself adds to my

339
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,029
already full plate and ignoring

340
00:11:05,049 --> 00:11:05,879
the list leads to missed

341
00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:06,960
opportunities my past

342
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:07,960
experience of the copywriters

343
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:08,899
haven't been fruitful their

344
00:11:08,899 --> 00:11:10,320
content often felt inauthentic and

345
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:10,720
overly

346
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:12,149
sales focused not truly capturing

347
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:13,590
my brand's voice this approach

348
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:14,960
initially spiked interest in

349
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,940
recovering dead leads but

350
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:16,919
eventually led to a drop in

351
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:18,240
engagement as the content didn't

352
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:18,960
offer real value

353
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,070
to my audience i understand the

354
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:21,299
importance of nurturing my email

355
00:11:21,299 --> 00:11:22,500
list with valuable content but

356
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,580
time constraints and concerns

357
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:24,830
about maintaining my brand's

358
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:26,009
integrity make me hesitant to

359
00:11:26,009 --> 00:11:26,559
delegate this

360
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,710
crucial task i'm looking for a

361
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:29,029
solution that aligns with my brand

362
00:11:29,029 --> 00:11:30,320
voice engages my audience

363
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,659
meaningfully and effectively

364
00:11:31,659 --> 00:11:33,149
leverages my email list to enhance

365
00:11:33,149 --> 00:11:34,559
my engagement and revenue without

366
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,990
compromising the authenticity and

367
00:11:36,049 --> 00:11:37,769
reputation of my brand boom how

386
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:29,100

387
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,940
thousand dollars for the year and

so i don't even know what the heck

399
00:13:00,259 --> 00:13:01,909
this is it looks like it's

400
00:13:01,909 --> 00:13:03,190
browsing i don't even have

401
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,480
like a browsing plugin this looks

402
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,750
like it's a brand new feature from

403
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:06,740
gpt which is kind of cool

404
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,850
but regardless guys what i'm

405
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:11,120
trying to show you right here is

406
00:13:11,129 --> 00:13:12,799
that if you don't understand

407
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,110
your audience all that well number

408
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:15,000
one you need to go do more

409
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,480
research you can do that with chat

410
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,279
gpt

411
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,710
but this is how you do your

412
00:13:18,789 --> 00:13:20,669
research you either use chat gpt

413
00:13:20,669 --> 00:13:21,759
and look it's like literally

414
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:22,070
searching

415
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,830
the web right now which is crazy

416
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:25,639

417
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:27,600

418
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:28,860
that provide sales it's important

419
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,039
to consider several key aspects

420
00:13:30,039 --> 00:13:31,679
right strategic trial periods

421
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,940
many sas providers offer free

422
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,200
trial periods as part of their

423
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,679
sales process which vary in length

424
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,929
depending on the complexity of the

425
00:13:36,929 --> 00:13:38,100
product and the target consumer

426
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,360
base right cool effective

00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:40,389
communication demos maintain

428
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:41,519
regular communication with

429
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:42,559
prospects during the trial period

430
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:42,639
is

431
00:13:42,679 --> 00:13:44,070
crucial demo should be valuable

understand the target audience so

433
00:13:46,009 --> 00:13:46,789
on and so forth

434
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,690
if you had to explain from the

435
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:52,710
first person perspective what is

436
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:54,460
the primary problem that this

437
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,659
customer is dealing with comma and

438
00:13:57,659 --> 00:14:00,159
use emotional and visceral

439
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,840
language to explain

440
00:14:01,879 --> 00:14:04,460
their situation comma what would

441
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:05,039
you say

442
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,330
pressure of turning free users

443
00:14:12,409 --> 00:14:13,759
into committed paying customers

444
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:15,039
it's a high stakes game teetering

445
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,059
on a razor's edge between success

446
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:17,360
and failure every day i grapple

447
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,320
with the challenge of aligning our

448
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,320
sales and marketing teams

449
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:20,659
constantly battling against a sea

450
00:14:20,669 --> 00:14:22,000
of competition that seems to grow

451
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,159
more

452
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,259
formidable by the hour the

453
00:14:23,269 --> 00:14:24,639
complexity of our product adds a

454
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,240
leather layer of difficulty making

455
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:26,549
it harder

456
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,870
to convey its value distinctly

457
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:29,279
right it's a relentless pursuit

458
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,919
blah blah blah blah blah now i

459
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:32,240

enhancing our demo experiences

484
00:15:32,889 --> 00:15:34,320
instead of overwhelming prospects

485
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:35,720
with information blah blah blah

486
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,139
blah blah

487
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,909
i could go to youtube i could go

488
00:15:37,909 --> 00:15:39,720
to reddit i could go to google i

489
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:40,950
could find all types of things

490
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:41,029
that

491
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,389
people talking about it do your

492
00:15:42,389 --> 00:15:43,629
research so you can be able to

493
00:15:43,649 --> 00:15:45,200
explain it the way i'm explaining

494
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:45,519
it here

495
00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:47,600
in mind so let's keep going now i

496
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:49,840
just want to show you a real quick

497
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,120
example of how you can do that

498
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:52,549
just with if like you don't even

499
00:15:52,549 --> 00:15:54,070
know the prospect you can do a ton

500
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:55,659
of research with chat gpt

501
00:15:58,679 --> 00:16:00,519
i'm gonna crack my neck real quick

502
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:02,320
sorry guys i know it's weird but

503
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,899
we always think that's odd i'm

504
00:16:04,899 --> 00:16:07,700
like you know i could just adjust

505
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:09,360
myself real quick

506
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:12,029
all right so what is the cost of

507
00:16:12,029 --> 00:16:16,789
them staying where they are so now

508
00:16:16,789 --> 00:16:18,879
what is the cost of them

509
00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:20,559
staying where they are financially

510
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:22,039
emotionally time etc stay in their

511
00:16:22,039 --> 00:16:22,960
current situation without

512
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,090
effectively leveraging the email

513
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:25,049
list as several costs for the

514
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:26,320
financial owner or the info

515
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:26,519
product

516
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,990
business owner and financial costs

517
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:28,990
the most direct impact is

518
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:30,440
financial the underutilized email

519
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:30,720
list

520
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:31,860
represents a significant loss

521
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,149
revenue opportunity considering

522
00:16:33,149 --> 00:16:34,399
the business's current revenue

523
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:34,960
scale

524
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:35,990
even a small percentage increase

525
00:16:36,059 --> 00:16:37,210
in conversion rates from this list

526
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:38,399
could translate into substantial

527
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,529
income additionally the money

528
00:16:39,549 --> 00:16:40,850
spent on generating those leads is

529
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:42,240
not fully capitalized upon

530
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:42,639
affecting the

531
00:16:42,679 --> 00:16:44,070
overall return on investment from

532
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:45,440
their marketing efforts right

533
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,330
opportunity cost emotional cost

534
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:48,779
time cost brand reputation

535
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:50,919
customer relationship cost loss of

536
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:53,279
competitive edge so on and so

537
00:16:53,389 --> 00:16:54,019
forth right

538
00:16:56,519 --> 00:17:01,970
boom let's not make this the same

539
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:04,440
as everything else let's make this

540
00:17:04,549 --> 00:17:07,279
bold and not bold okay so now i

541
00:17:07,299 --> 00:17:07,519
have

542
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:10,039
that okay now what is the number

543
00:17:10,049 --> 00:17:12,880

just in terms of revenue but also

587
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:42,789
in reaching impact this includes

588
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:43,920
expanding their customer base

589
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,150

right achieving financial freedom

593
00:18:51,259 --> 00:18:53,359
and stability legacy and influence

594
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:54,470
but you realize i'm saying the

595
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,029
number one

596
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,720
one most important thing so out of

597
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,420
all of these things what is the

598
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:02,079
number one most important thing

599
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:12,799
so i'm going to say

600
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:19,460
just that we don't need everything

601
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:21,220
else okay so you know this is

602
00:19:21,319 --> 00:19:22,559
great but i actually like this

603
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:22,640
it's

604
00:19:22,759 --> 00:19:23,710
saying everything else you know

605
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:24,720
hey here's what it's going to do

606
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,930
so boom come back over here

607
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:35,720
so on and so forth and we can go

608
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,670
and we can turn this into a list

609
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:41,039
you can do that as well with this

610
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:41,200
one

611
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:49,799
boom yeah we'll come back and

612
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:50,960
we'll fix that we'll pause it so

613
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,680
you guys don't have to sit here

614
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:51,759
and

615
00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:54,140
watch me format it okay so what

616
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:55,559
are the three to five necessary

617
00:19:55,559 --> 00:19:57,029
steps you'll walk them through

618
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:57,200
that

619
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,630
we'll get them to their finish

620
00:19:58,630 --> 00:19:59,819
line so this isn't something i'm

621
00:19:59,819 --> 00:20:01,079
going to ask chat gpt right this

622
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:01,200
is

623
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,339
my own thing so i'm going to go

624
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:03,599
and i'm going to explain it to

625
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:06,470
them let me explain to you the way

626
00:20:06,519 --> 00:20:07,910
that i get my clients results

627
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,490
following the inbox intimacy

628
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:12,680
method first and foremost what i

629
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,759
do is i go

630
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:15,819
through the material that they

631
00:20:15,819 --> 00:20:17,950
teach so i can better understand

632
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:19,670
them and i also go through

633
00:20:19,789 --> 00:20:20,240
podcasts

634
00:20:20,279 --> 00:20:22,329
they've been on interviews they've

635
00:20:22,369 --> 00:20:24,089
been on so i can understand the

636
00:20:24,089 --> 00:20:26,069
avatar then what we do is we get

637
00:20:26,089 --> 00:20:26,400
on

638
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:33,440
a guru

639
00:20:34,119 --> 00:20:38,579
the next step is getting on a

640
00:20:38,619 --> 00:20:41,759
personalized interview with the

641
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:44,400
guru where i ask them questions

642
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,119
based on

643
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,880
the curriculum they teach and

644
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,420
other material that i have

645
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:50,240
obtained from their podcasts

646
00:20:52,839 --> 00:20:54,230
when we first start working

647
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:56,369
together we will do one call every

648
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:57,039
two weeks

649
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:01,960
and eventually as we move on it

650
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,910
will turn into one call per month

651
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,359
just to be able to serve as fuel

652
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:05,450
for

653
00:21:05,559 --> 00:21:08,210
the content after i'm able to

654
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:12,559
obtain the person's information

655
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:16,000
from their interviews that i

656
00:21:16,059 --> 00:21:16,720
conduct with them

657
00:21:16,759 --> 00:21:19,099
comma i'm going to transcribe

658
00:21:19,099 --> 00:21:21,309
those interviews and then turn

659
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,680
those interviews into email copy

660
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,660
which will serve as newsletters

661
00:21:26,759 --> 00:21:34,099
we will send out three value based

662
00:21:34,099 --> 00:21:36,140
emails which are derived from

663
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:39,480
the guru's mouth directly and

664
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,599
their words directly so it sounds

665
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:40,950
like them

666
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:47,039
and then once a week we will pitch

667
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:47,039
our services

668
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:51,940
our services or product to the

669
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:55,099
newsletter

670
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:59,509
we will do this for

671
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:07,579
on a weekly basis and at the end

672
00:22:07,579 --> 00:22:09,619
of every single month we will

673
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:11,440
check in on the metrics of the

674
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,390
email list health

675
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,359
and on top of that also overall

676
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:18,720
revenue comma number of book calls

677
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:23,829
comma etc etc

678
00:22:24,519 --> 00:22:27,569
right so here we go and so this

679
00:22:27,569 --> 00:22:28,740
basically breaks down the

680
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:30,480
step-by-step basis and so i can do

681
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,119
that right here

682
00:22:34,599 --> 00:22:35,940

okay regular monitoring adjustment

687
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,880
at the end of each month you

688
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,240
review key metrics such as list

689
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:44,470
health

690
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,470
okay appears highly effective

691
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:48,720

692
00:22:48,759 --> 00:22:52,599
you're damn right chat gpt all

693
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:53,990
right so let's do this

694
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:57,759
all right let's take this back

695
00:22:57,759 --> 00:22:58,000
here

696
00:23:02,359 --> 00:23:07,410

we'll fix that later

699
00:23:15,799 --> 00:23:20,799
in one sentence right

700
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:26,690
describe what i do for my clients

701
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,900
in a way that makes sense

702
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:41,109
boom boom isn't that great look at

703
00:23:41,109 --> 00:23:42,150
how look at how little

704
00:23:42,359 --> 00:23:45,680
i have to work right now oh nick

705
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,930
this is gonna take so long no it's

706
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:49,779
not just leverage chat gpt guys

707
00:23:49,819 --> 00:23:50,420
like

708
00:23:50,519 --> 00:23:52,160
now here's another thing what you

709
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,799
also could do is you could just

710
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:57,130
record yourself going through all

711
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:57,440
this

712
00:23:58,079 --> 00:23:59,369
stuff transcribe it feed that

713
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:01,109
transcription to chat gpt and be

714
00:24:01,109 --> 00:24:02,710
like answer these questions

715
00:24:02,759 --> 00:24:04,069
if you're not getting the inputs

716
00:24:04,069 --> 00:24:06,279
that you like from chat gpt um you

717
00:24:06,329 --> 00:24:07,680
know it could be very specific

718
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,410
offer that's super niche and like

719
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:11,140
chat gpt doesn't have insight on

720
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:12,549
it just record an audio message on

721
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:12,779
that

722
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:18,250
okay so let's go back and let's do

723
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:19,440
this again

724
00:24:20,119 --> 00:24:23,710
what sacred cows do i kill um do i

725
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:25,039
stand against

726
00:24:25,079 --> 00:24:27,119
right and so now it's going to go

727
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,359
into this it's going to explain it

728
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:29,829
again

729
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,789
generic outsource content you

730
00:24:31,799 --> 00:24:33,990
stand against the common practice

731
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:35,759
of using generic outsource content

732
00:24:35,799 --> 00:24:36,779
lacks the authentic voice over

733
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:38,319
reliance on sales pitches unlike

734
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:40,339
standard practices that heavily

735
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,440
focus on sales pitches

736
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,779
you balance one size fits all

737
00:24:42,779 --> 00:24:44,359
that's damn straight short-term

738
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:45,319
tactics over long-term

739
00:24:45,369 --> 00:24:46,079
relationships you're

740
00:24:46,119 --> 00:24:48,079
damn straight that's right uh yeah

741
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:50,950
by the way guys look at how icy

742
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,480
crispy that that merch is right

743
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:54,880
now

744
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:55,859
you should definitely go to the

745
00:24:55,859 --> 00:24:56,940
client ascension events so you can

746
00:24:56,950 --> 00:24:59,119
get more merch okay so

747
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,720
let's go let's go here

748
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:11,759
up there we go

749
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:20,740
right there we go okay what oh

750
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:26,000
what do you believe to be my

751
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,460
single most competitive advantages

752
00:25:28,589 --> 00:25:29,599
right and let's just ask it

753
00:25:32,839 --> 00:25:41,630
oh i realized i just moved the obs

754
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:44,029
screen there we go okay

755
00:25:44,839 --> 00:25:50,640
how great is that

756
00:25:51,319 --> 00:25:54,190
now the only reason why i'm

757
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,200
getting such good outputs is why

758
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:57,599
do you think that is guys

759
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,940
because the inputs are really good

760
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:00,079
look at what the input started

761
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:00,319
with

762
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:04,150
a very in-depth explanation of my

763
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:06,829
avatar and showing them what the

764
00:26:06,829 --> 00:26:08,410
issue is and then as well

765
00:26:08,599 --> 00:26:11,990
when we got to explaining the

766
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:13,039
service

right and now it understands my

769
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:20,700
service the thing is the reason i

770
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:20,869
can

771
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,309
explain it so well is because i've

772
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:24,140
done it and i've been doing it for

773
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:25,670

this literally loaded into chat

849
00:29:04,519 --> 00:29:05,819
gpt i can just now ask

850
00:29:06,519 --> 00:29:11,950
what is a core promise that i can

851
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:13,930
offer to clients which will

852
00:29:16,599 --> 00:29:18,180
generate and spark interest in

853
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:19,279
them working with me

854
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:24,549
okay see you guys can't see the

00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:32,559
like right here there we go

860
00:29:32,599 --> 00:29:33,279

861
00:29:36,279 --> 00:29:38,200
i guess you guys don't really need

862
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,440
to see the the url tab

863
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:45,650
a core promise that would generate

864
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,720
and sparking it could be

865
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,000

mechanism is good like my

888
00:30:15,569 --> 00:30:16,240
mechanism is

889
00:30:16,279 --> 00:30:17,670
unique that's not what a lot of

890
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:19,170
people do everyone else is just

00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,759
so let's keep going so as a

958
00:32:04,759 --> 00:32:06,480
successful business owner and info

959
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:06,960
product

960
00:32:07,309 --> 00:32:09,049
revenue through courses and

961
00:32:09,089 --> 00:32:10,900
coaching services and however the

962
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:13,440
true potential of your email is a

963
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,319
collection of leads and interest

964
00:32:14,319 --> 00:32:15,269
is much more than a potential

965
00:32:15,269 --> 00:32:15,920
database it's a goal

966
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:16,910
mine of potential conversions and

967
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:18,000
long-term customer relationships

968
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:18,549
that's not being like

969
00:32:18,599 --> 00:32:19,589
i know you've got it going on one

970
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,650
hand managing this host to

971
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:22,079
yourself as an overall burden to

972
00:32:22,079 --> 00:32:22,119
your

973
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,180
already full plate on the other

974
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,359
hand your previous attempts the

975
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:25,519
delegate have led to a discipline

976
00:32:25,559 --> 00:32:26,470
resulting of the lacked

977
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:27,839
authenticity felt overly salesy

978
00:32:27,839 --> 00:32:29,200
and failed to resonate with your

979
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:29,400
audience

980
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,470
ultimately causing a decline and

981
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:31,440
engagement and possibly even

982
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,400
harming your brain's attention

983
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,829
fantastic this problem is deeper

984
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,140
than just an effective email

985
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:37,039
marketing it's a strategic gap

986
00:32:37,079 --> 00:32:38,190
that's costing you not just in

987
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,609
immediate revenue but in long-term

988
00:32:39,609 --> 00:32:41,279
growth and customer loyalty the

989
00:32:41,319 --> 00:32:42,440
emails sent out under your brand's

990
00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:43,609
name should be a direct reflection

991
00:32:43,609 --> 00:32:44,849
of your expertise and values

992
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:45,869
but finding someone who can

993
00:32:45,869 --> 00:32:47,160
accurately capture and convey your

994
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,559
unique voice and insights has been

995
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:48,640
a

996
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,890
formidable challenge the content

997
00:32:49,890 --> 00:32:50,980
needs a circuit about the local

998
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:52,000
knowledge right the

999
00:32:52,039 --> 00:32:53,109
underperformances and just lost

1000
00:32:53,109 --> 00:32:54,319
revenue it's missed opportunity

1001
00:32:54,319 --> 00:32:54,960
for building lasting

1002
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:55,859
relationships with your audience

1003
00:32:55,859 --> 00:32:56,609
these relationships are the

1004
00:32:56,609 --> 00:32:56,869
bedrock

1005
00:32:59,319 --> 00:33:00,279
right in essence your challenge is

1006
00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:01,240
not just about sending emails but

1007
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,240
effectively communicating your

1008
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,410
unique value yep all right cool

1009
00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:06,480
good solid notice how i'm not

1010
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,880
again i'm not having to do like

1011
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:10,730
everything myself why because the

1012
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:12,369
inputs are good when the inputs

1013
00:33:12,369 --> 00:33:13,920
are good when the inputs are good

1014
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:16,140
this is a lot easier when the

1015
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:18,710
inputs are bad it's a lot harder

1016
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:20,789
when you give little to no context

1017
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:21,039
or you

1018
00:33:21,079 --> 00:33:22,410
don't have a unique service and

1019
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:24,069
you don't have a good product this

1020
00:33:24,069 --> 00:33:26,140
is a lot harder when you do it's

1021
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:26,799
very easy to

1022
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:28,230
produce something that's very good

1023
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:34,259
now i want you to produce a list

1024
00:33:34,299 --> 00:33:41,339
of 25 problems this avatar is

1025
00:33:41,349 --> 00:33:42,069
experiencing

1026
00:33:42,119 --> 00:33:46,079
i want these to be in depth and

1027
00:33:46,079 --> 00:33:49,440
again establish preeminence

1028
00:33:55,559 --> 00:34:01,920
okay under utilization of email

1029
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:04,230
this is going to take a second so

1030
00:34:04,259 --> 00:34:05,039
i'm just going to hit pause

1031
00:34:05,079 --> 00:34:05,829
so you guys don't just got to

1032
00:34:05,829 --> 00:34:07,390
watch this get generated okay here

1033
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,920
we go so there we go we got

1034
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,389
25 problems all these are pretty

1035
00:34:10,449 --> 00:34:11,630
good i was reading them as they

1036
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:14,789
came out pretty damn good so i'm

1037
00:34:14,809 --> 00:34:14,960
just

1038
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,389

1040
00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:20,559
forgetting about that

1041
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:25,349
all right there we go um i don't

1042
00:34:25,349 --> 00:34:27,230
like when it does the bold though

1043
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:28,869
now i have to go and it's like

1044
00:34:29,559 --> 00:34:31,679
anytime it does this just replace

1045
00:34:31,699 --> 00:34:35,300
all just get rid of that so now we

1046
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,480

1047
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:42,059

you to establish preeminence here

1052
00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:53,840
by explaining it better than they

1053
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:54,940
could explain it themselves

1054
00:34:55,639 --> 00:35:01,159
period go in depth on every detail

1055
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:05,309

1072
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:39,340
of the email

1073
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,329
list they dream of transforming

1074
00:35:40,329 --> 00:35:41,340
their extensive okay let's pause

1075
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:42,320
this because it's kind of slow

1076
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,619
okay so continuing on here we got

1077
00:35:44,619 --> 00:35:47,039
12 different points here i like

1078
00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:48,230
all these the only one that i was

1079
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,619
like i don't really think they

1080
00:35:49,619 --> 00:35:50,820
care about this is like they

1081
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:52,320
utilize the latest in marketing

1082
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:52,860
technology

1083
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,250
and automation with ease making

1084
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:55,679
their email marketing both cutting

1085
00:35:55,679 --> 00:35:57,199
edge and effortlessly efficient i

1086
00:35:57,199 --> 00:35:57,750
don't think

1087
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,170
like i think they just don't want

1088
00:35:59,179 --> 00:36:01,050
to have to handle it at all um and

1089
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:04,800
then like also data decision data

1090
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,550
driven decision making like

1091
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:08,349
they're already doing that so

1092
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,480
there's just no need to have those

1093
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,000
so what i'll do

1094
00:36:11,159 --> 00:36:13,869
is i'll take this oh wait i need

1095
00:36:13,869 --> 00:36:16,389
this whole thing

1096
00:36:17,079 --> 00:36:23,860
all right and i'll go to desired

1097
00:36:23,969 --> 00:36:26,659
situation oh let's not make the

1098
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:28,639
same mistake 15 times in a row

1099
00:36:28,639 --> 00:36:28,969
nick there

1100
00:36:29,159 --> 00:36:31,679
we go no there we go so let's get

1101
00:36:31,679 --> 00:36:34,579
rid of data decision driven and

1102
00:36:34,579 --> 00:36:37,530
then technological mastery because

1103
00:36:37,639 --> 00:36:38,739
sometimes it's not going to give

1104
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:39,989
you everything you ran right so

1105
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:40,880
there we go all right that's

1106
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:41,840
their desired situation

1107
00:36:42,519 --> 00:36:46,880
and now what i can do as well

1108
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:49,920
let's put this right here

1109
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,750
oh nope nope same close right and

1110
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:01,340
so also what i can do here what is

1111
00:37:01,570 --> 00:37:03,280
the gap was how did they bridge it

1112
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:06,809
what i want to do is diary entry

1113
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:13,110
of working with me you can say

00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:20,460
journal entry okay so i can say

1117
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:22,730

00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:30,179
of them experiencing the benefits

1121
00:37:30,179 --> 00:37:32,820
of working with me after six

1122
00:37:32,909 --> 00:37:36,239
months and the transformation it

1123
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:36,400
has

1124
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,510
created for their business

1125
00:37:38,199 --> 00:37:47,360
okay so six months ago i embarked

1126
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:49,010
on a journey with nick and today i

1127
00:37:49,059 --> 00:37:50,230
can completely say it has been

1128
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,269
transformative for both me and my

1129
00:37:51,289 --> 00:37:52,300
business it feels like i'm living

1130
00:37:52,309 --> 00:37:53,280
a dream where my vision and

1131
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,650
aspirations are turning to reality

1132
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:55,869
every morning i wake up to a inbox

1133
00:37:55,889 --> 00:37:57,170
buzzing with positive responses

1134
00:37:57,239 --> 00:37:58,230
to our emails the way nick has

1135
00:37:58,260 --> 00:37:59,539
captured my voice and expertise in

1136
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:00,639
these emails nothing short of

1137
00:38:00,679 --> 00:38:01,780
magical they're not just words on

1138
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:03,099
a screen they resonate deeply with

1139
00:38:03,099 --> 00:38:04,400
my audience creating a bond that

1140
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,730
feels both personal and profound

1141
00:38:05,730 --> 00:38:07,030
the time-saving aspect has been a

1142
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:08,559
game-changer delegating my email

1143
00:38:08,599 --> 00:38:09,679

greedy of crafting and sending out

1147
00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:14,369
emails the extra time has allowed

return on investment the

1158
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:26,960
strategies nick implemented have

1159
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:27,360
not only

1160
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,789
boosted sales but also enhanced

1161
00:38:28,869 --> 00:38:30,449
the overall value of our brand but

1162
00:38:30,449 --> 00:38:31,900
it's not just about the financial

1163
00:38:32,039 --> 00:38:33,329
gains the emotional satisfaction i

1164
00:38:33,329 --> 00:38:34,340
get from knowing that we are

and the feedback we receive is

1170
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:41,619
overwhelmingly positive the

1171
00:38:41,659 --> 00:38:42,940
monthly check-ins with nick are

1172
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:44,320
always enlightening reviewing our

1173
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,630
metrics and strategizing for the

1174
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:46,840
future has become an exercise i

1175
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:47,889
look forward to

1176
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,349
it's incredible to see how our

1177
00:38:49,349 --> 00:38:50,800
efforts are translating into

1178
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,079
tangible results perhaps

1179
00:38:52,119 --> 00:38:53,389
the most profound transformation

1180
00:38:53,389 --> 00:38:54,559
has been how i view my business

1181
00:38:54,559 --> 00:38:56,469
with nick's help we've cultivated

1182
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:56,559
an

1183
00:38:56,599 --> 00:38:57,579
authentic voice that echoes

1184
00:38:57,769 --> 00:38:58,769
through every email the

1185
00:38:58,769 --> 00:38:59,880
authenticity has not only

1186
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:00,949
attracted more clients

1187
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:01,980
but also has invigorated my entire

1188
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:02,829
team we're not just running

1189
00:39:02,829 --> 00:39:04,159
business we're leading a community

1190
00:39:04,199 --> 00:39:05,590
in retrospect than the decision

1191
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:06,230
right boom

1192
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:12,750
love that that's great so like

1193
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:14,340
guys the reason why you watch

1194
00:39:14,539 --> 00:39:16,320
again you guys are probably

1195
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:16,800
laughing at

1196
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:19,059
those um the reason why we're

1197
00:39:19,059 --> 00:39:21,679
doing this is so we can have an

1198
00:39:21,679 --> 00:39:25,199
extreme understanding of our

1199
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:25,739
prospect

1200
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,489
to the point where when we sit

1201
00:39:27,489 --> 00:39:29,429
down to write the vsl script it's

1202
00:39:29,429 --> 00:39:31,119
so easy to write it right because

1203
00:39:31,159 --> 00:39:32,940
it's like it all this stuff right

1204
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:34,929
when you have an overwhelming

1205
00:39:34,929 --> 00:39:36,949
amount of information it's easy

1206
00:39:36,969 --> 00:39:37,760
for you to write that

1207
00:39:39,719 --> 00:39:43,210
so let's go and take this what is

1208
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:45,099
the gap how do they bridge it

1209
00:39:45,099 --> 00:39:46,320
let's keep going

1210
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:48,409
lies in the disconnect between

1211
00:39:48,449 --> 00:39:50,639
their current email marketing and

1212
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:51,679
the potential of what their email

1213
00:39:51,719 --> 00:39:52,800
could achieve despite having a

1214
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:53,800
substantial email list and

1215
00:39:53,809 --> 00:39:54,800
significant resources they

1216
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:55,199
struggle to

1217
00:39:55,239 --> 00:39:56,429
create authentic blah blah how

1218
00:39:56,429 --> 00:39:57,849
they bridge it embracing strategic

1219
00:39:57,849 --> 00:39:58,960
content creation regular

1220
00:39:59,639 --> 00:40:00,719
communication and refinement

1221
00:40:00,719 --> 00:40:02,719
perfect data-driven optimization

1226
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:13,199
gap by

well let's start here reason

1261
00:42:06,289 --> 00:42:07,139
number one

1262
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:12,960
daniel case study so i recorded a

1263
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,019
case study with daniel and that

1264
00:42:15,019 --> 00:42:17,000
case study is basically just me

1265
00:42:17,719 --> 00:42:18,469
interviewing him we've made nine

1266
00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:20,059
hundred and thirty thousand

1267
00:42:20,059 --> 00:42:21,429
dollars from the email list and

1268
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:21,630
starting

1269
00:42:21,719 --> 00:42:25,559
about 11 months ago 11 months 930

1270
00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:27,880
000 that is about a what is that

1271
00:42:28,119 --> 00:42:31,039
divided by 11 close to 90 000 it's

1272
00:42:31,079 --> 00:42:33,690
not exactly that um but 90 grand a

1273
00:42:33,690 --> 00:42:35,579
month from that so let's just say

1274
00:42:35,579 --> 00:42:38,000
it's that's 10 it's pretty close

1275
00:42:38,039 --> 00:42:39,429
that's like 80 whatever seven or

1276
00:42:39,449 --> 00:42:40,760
something like that okay so let's

1277
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:42,690
just say 90 000 a month and

1278
00:42:42,769 --> 00:42:43,199
daniel's

1279
00:42:43,849 --> 00:42:44,949
investment with me like that was

1280
00:42:44,949 --> 00:42:46,690
just a ridiculous roi for him he

1281
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:48,559
made a ton on it so just makes

1282
00:42:48,559 --> 00:42:49,030
sense

1283
00:42:49,719 --> 00:42:51,349
right so number one is gonna be

1284
00:42:51,349 --> 00:42:52,559
daniel's case study but

1285
00:42:52,599 --> 00:42:57,599
i want you to provide statistics

1286
00:42:57,599 --> 00:42:59,119
facts insights

1287
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:03,219
and other metrics

1288
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:07,840
to provide reasons someone should

1289
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:08,960
believe

1290
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,010
my methodology

1291
00:43:11,159 --> 00:43:13,840
and that this solution will fix

1292
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:15,119
their problem

1293
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:19,199
provide me with

1294
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:25,119
20 reasons

1295
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:37,519
okay so notice how i ask these

1296
00:43:37,519 --> 00:43:38,989
questions guys as well like i can

1297
00:43:38,989 --> 00:43:40,469
just ask it anything

1298
00:43:40,519 --> 00:43:41,909
and then it'll do it now this is

1299
00:43:41,909 --> 00:43:43,150
cool i haven't again i haven't

1300
00:43:43,150 --> 00:43:43,840
seen this before

1301
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:44,869
this is my first time seeing this

1302
00:43:44,909 --> 00:43:46,309
where it just now browses for me

1303
00:43:46,309 --> 00:43:47,599
whenever i ask a question so

1304
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:47,840
that's

1305
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:49,269
awesome so let me go ahead and

1306
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:50,949
pause this while this loads all

1307
00:43:50,949 --> 00:43:51,989
right so here's where we need to

1308
00:43:51,989 --> 00:43:52,230
like

1309
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:53,159
pick and choose right because

1310
00:43:53,159 --> 00:43:54,070
there's gonna be some bad ones

1311
00:43:54,070 --> 00:43:55,199
there's gonna be some good ones

1312
00:43:55,239 --> 00:43:58,170
so growing email usage 4 billion

1313
00:43:58,170 --> 00:44:00,599
daily email users number expect to

1314
00:44:00,619 --> 00:44:01,929
rise to 4.6 billion

1315
00:44:02,679 --> 00:44:05,000
eh right like i mean you could say

1316
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,539

people that use email right

00:44:08,409 --> 00:44:08,480
there's

1319
00:44:08,519 --> 00:44:09,849
not 4 billion people on your

1320
00:44:09,849 --> 00:44:11,369
facebook ads whatever but i don't

1321
00:44:11,369 --> 00:44:13,579

1322
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:13,920
businesses

brands are increasing their email

1326
00:44:17,639 --> 00:44:19,039
budget that's not useful um 72 of

1327
00:44:19,110 --> 00:44:20,820
the most effective email marketing

1328
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:21,679
strategies involve

1329
00:44:21,719 --> 00:44:23,489

1336
00:44:34,739 --> 00:44:36,329
increase in email engagement over

marketers are using generative ai

1344
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:54,159
for

1345
00:44:54,199 --> 00:44:55,809
email creation and here's the

1346
00:44:55,809 --> 00:44:57,119
thing is like you know if

1347
00:44:57,119 --> 00:44:58,710
everyone's using ai like people

1348
00:44:58,719 --> 00:44:59,360
can tell when

1349
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,539
things are written by ai and it's

1350
00:45:01,539 --> 00:45:03,659
just garbage so could maybe use

1351
00:45:03,659 --> 00:45:09,039

open rates and click rate

1360
00:45:23,590 --> 00:45:24,889
suggesting that quality and

1361
00:45:24,889 --> 00:45:26,360
personalization trump quality

1362
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:28,579

growth

1366
00:45:34,639 --> 00:45:34,639
i like this one email marketing

1367
00:45:34,679 --> 00:45:36,070
revenue is estimated to reach

1368
00:45:36,239 --> 00:45:38,110
almost 11 billion by the end of

1369
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:38,960
2023

1370
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,340
showcasing it's a growing

1371
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:41,920
importance that's not bad um

1372
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:42,960
continued growth

1373
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,769
yeah people think it's dying it's

1374
00:45:46,769 --> 00:45:48,489
not so let's go through and let's

1375
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:50,159
go back to this let's just start

1376
00:45:50,199 --> 00:46:02,030
adding these in this one right

1377
00:46:02,179 --> 00:46:09,119
here from hubspot not bad

1378
00:46:14,599 --> 00:46:15,690
all right so why do i need these

1379
00:46:15,699 --> 00:46:16,909
well when you're in your vsl and

1380
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:18,320
you're going to state a fact

1381
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:20,730
don't you think it's useful to say

1382
00:46:20,730 --> 00:46:22,610
when by the way a study from

1383
00:46:22,610 --> 00:46:23,590
hubspot showed

1384
00:46:23,639 --> 00:46:25,360
fake because if you don't know

1385
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:27,159
what that is we'll talk about it

1386
00:46:27,210 --> 00:46:29,280
when we get to the writing section

1387
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:30,710
so uh continued growth being

1388
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,590
increasingly adopted did i say

1389
00:46:32,590 --> 00:46:34,960
that already yeah um email

1390
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:35,440
automation

1391
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:36,869
certainly involving automation

1392
00:46:37,039 --> 00:46:38,630
okay cool so there's a couple that

1393
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:40,480
are half decent right but it's not

1394
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:40,530
a

1395
00:46:40,599 --> 00:46:42,579
crazy amount i just want to have a

1396
00:46:42,579 --> 00:46:44,380
couple of them just in my back

1397
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:46,760

okay so we got features and

1404
00:47:06,409 --> 00:47:07,639
benefits we then have a

1405
00:47:07,750 --> 00:47:10,079
description of the product itself

1406
00:47:10,119 --> 00:47:11,510
and then we have a sales argument

1407
00:47:11,630 --> 00:47:12,840

00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:13,960
verticals and then we got

1409
00:47:14,010 --> 00:47:14,400
potential

1410
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:15,829
questions okay and you guys were

1411
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:17,340
thinking wow wait a minute we're

1412
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:18,710
doing so much of this through chat

1413
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:19,440
gpt

1414
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:21,750
nick aren't you a copywriter yes i

1415
00:47:21,750 --> 00:47:23,639
am and here's the thing guys

1416
00:47:23,639 --> 00:47:27,039
anyone who's smart knows they

1417
00:47:27,039 --> 00:47:27,099
should

1418
00:47:27,159 --> 00:47:29,150
do chat gpt it's so much faster

1419
00:47:29,150 --> 00:47:31,260
imagine we had to write all this

1420
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:33,119
out by hand this video would

1421
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:33,320
already

1422
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:35,119
be at an hour 40 probably be an

1423
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:36,750
additional hour or even more and

1424
00:47:36,750 --> 00:47:38,480
we wouldn't even be where we're at

1425
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:38,639
right

1426
00:47:38,679 --> 00:47:40,219
now it would be like up here at

1427
00:47:40,239 --> 00:47:42,050
this part right here we wouldn't

1428
00:47:42,050 --> 00:47:44,000
even be where we're at right now

1429
00:47:44,039 --> 00:47:45,369
and i'm getting way more volume

1430
00:47:45,369 --> 00:47:46,789
and you're going to see how we can

1431
00:47:46,789 --> 00:47:48,079
then plug this in to write a

1432
00:47:48,119 --> 00:47:50,630
really banger vsl script as well

1433
00:47:50,630 --> 00:47:53,099
so let's see what it says feature

1434
00:47:53,099 --> 00:47:54,809
in-depth personal benefit

1435
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:56,179
ensures content and feature

1436
00:47:56,179 --> 00:47:57,570
customized email yep very real

1437
00:47:57,570 --> 00:47:59,199
strategy review yep data driven

1438
00:47:59,199 --> 00:47:59,570
insights

1439
00:47:59,639 --> 00:48:01,739
okay uh balance between value and

1440
00:48:01,750 --> 00:48:03,820
sales pitch yep specialization

1441
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:05,599
high ticket yep ongoing client

1442
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:07,889
engagement uh yep i guess yeah

1443
00:48:07,889 --> 00:48:10,090
that's true reduction in the

1444
00:48:10,090 --> 00:48:12,079
client workload correct

1445
00:48:12,119 --> 00:48:13,329
feature utilization of ai and

1446
00:48:13,329 --> 00:48:15,789
latest technologies eh not really

1447
00:48:15,789 --> 00:48:17,440
i don't really do it all that much

1448
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:17,519
i

1449
00:48:17,559 --> 00:48:19,579
mean i do but like how's that like

1450
00:48:19,590 --> 00:48:21,500
why do they care at all right so

1451
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:23,349
like i'll use it sometimes when

1452
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:24,570
i'm hitting writer's block but i'm

1453
00:48:24,579 --> 00:48:25,639
not going to use it all the time

1454
00:48:25,639 --> 00:48:26,929
with client newsletters sometimes

1455
00:48:26,969 --> 00:48:27,039
i

1456
00:48:27,670 --> 00:48:28,920
literally just again sorry guys

1457
00:48:28,929 --> 00:48:30,929
sometimes i'm literally just like

1458
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:32,079
on my phone in the sauna and

1459
00:48:32,119 --> 00:48:34,320
i just write all my emails for the

1460
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:36,619
week it's super easy because i'm a

1461
00:48:36,619 --> 00:48:38,760
stud it's super easy for me okay

1462
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:44,030
i'm great i think we already did

1463
00:48:44,030 --> 00:48:46,230
this didn't we maybe just repeated

1464
00:48:46,230 --> 00:48:46,469
it

1465
00:48:46,519 --> 00:48:51,019
i guess not so let's describe the

1466
00:48:51,159 --> 00:48:52,679
product now

1467
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:55,519
did we already do this

1468
00:48:56,199 --> 00:49:00,170
huh i guess not okay so the

1469
00:49:00,199 --> 00:49:01,920
product i thought i repeated it

1470
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:05,139
now what i want you to do is

1471
00:49:05,139 --> 00:49:07,360
explain the product to me as if

1472
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:15,519
i'm a prospect for this service

1473
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:27,460
i don't want you to do this in the

1474
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:30,530
format of a listicle make these

1475
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:31,920
paragraphs

1476
00:49:32,599 --> 00:49:35,619
there's some things that i just

1477
00:49:35,619 --> 00:49:37,519
wanted to be a paragraph because

1478
00:49:37,519 --> 00:49:38,559
then i can take that and put

1479
00:49:39,239 --> 00:49:50,780
that directly into my copy

1480
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:59,219
perfect this is solid

1481
00:50:03,239 --> 00:50:04,630
okay boom

1482
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:08,460
product i'm not going to do it

1483
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:08,719
again

1484
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:12,280
i'm going to fix it there we go

1485
00:50:12,309 --> 00:50:21,190
now

1486
00:50:22,119 --> 00:50:27,110
what are the possible objections

1487
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:29,420
that someone would have to

1488
00:50:29,420 --> 00:50:30,880
utilizing this service

1489
00:50:33,239 --> 00:50:35,340
okay okay so i don't have a

1490
00:50:35,349 --> 00:50:36,699
section for this you could totally

1491
00:50:36,710 --> 00:50:37,590
include this in the

1492
00:50:37,639 --> 00:50:38,630
in the doc it's already getting

1493
00:50:38,710 --> 00:50:40,000
pretty long we're already at like

1494
00:50:40,039 --> 00:50:42,719
19 pages we're not even done yet

1495
00:50:42,719 --> 00:50:44,880
um but i'm going to do this

1496
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:47,199
because a sales argument guys like

1497
00:50:47,239 --> 00:50:48,630
think about what an argument is

1498
00:50:48,650 --> 00:50:50,039
remember how i said this in the

1499
00:50:50,039 --> 00:50:50,880
previous module

1500
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:53,309
like you're a lawyer and you have

1501
00:50:53,309 --> 00:50:55,369
all the facts right and you have

1502
00:50:55,369 --> 00:50:57,920
to prove to the jury that the

1503
00:50:57,960 --> 00:50:59,670
client is innocent right that's

1504
00:50:59,670 --> 00:51:01,590
your argument to the court now the

1505
00:51:01,590 --> 00:51:03,019
thing is is the jury already

1506
00:51:03,079 --> 00:51:04,469
has an opinion based on all the

1507
00:51:04,530 --> 00:51:06,400
facts they've accumulated so they

1508
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:07,679
have objections as to why

1509
00:51:07,719 --> 00:51:09,500
that person's not innocent or why

1510
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:10,800
that person's not guilty

1511
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:13,760
or innocent or guilty or whatever

1512
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:15,820
so here we go right so now what

1513
00:51:15,820 --> 00:51:16,400
i'm going to say

1514
00:51:16,750 --> 00:51:19,199
taking all these objections into

1515
00:51:19,199 --> 00:51:21,440
account i want you to craft

1516
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:26,539
a useful and compelling comma and

1517
00:51:26,550 --> 00:51:28,900
persuasive sales argument to sell

1518
00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:31,039
someone on this service

1519
00:51:33,079 --> 00:51:37,469
i want you to imagine that you are

1520
00:51:37,469 --> 00:51:38,869
jordan belfort

1521
00:51:39,559 --> 00:51:48,710
one of the best sales people of

1522
00:51:49,420 --> 00:51:51,400
all time

1523
00:51:55,719 --> 00:51:57,360
and utilize his straight line

1524
00:51:57,360 --> 00:51:57,920
strategy

1525
00:51:58,599 --> 00:52:01,110
selling

1526
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:06,949
to create this sales argument

1527
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:10,380
the reason i said it that way is

1528
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:12,340
sometimes it'll be like jordan

1529
00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:13,119
belford's a criminal

1530
00:52:16,519 --> 00:52:24,440
there you go

1531
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:24,480
you

1532
00:52:25,159 --> 00:52:45,860
Yeah, this is solid as fuck.

1533
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:57,829
And no one's going to care about

1534
00:52:57,829 --> 00:53:00,269
data privacy, right?

1535
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:01,269
So how solid is that?

1536
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:02,619
So now I have a sales argument.

1537
00:53:02,659 --> 00:53:03,610
It's pretty good.

1538
00:53:03,659 --> 00:53:04,820
And if you don't know, what's a

1539
00:53:04,820 --> 00:53:05,960
straight line selling is

1540
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:07,119
essentially like, I'll just do

1541
00:53:07,159 --> 00:53:09,119
this real quick for you.

1542
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:13,960
This is the best way to do this.

1543
00:53:14,019 --> 00:53:16,159
So it's essentially this, okay.

1544
00:53:16,199 --> 00:53:17,150
Here's a straight line.

1545
00:53:17,199 --> 00:53:17,800
Imagine that it's actually

1546
00:53:17,849 --> 00:53:18,150
straight.

1547
00:53:18,199 --> 00:53:22,320
And what we have up here is Pluto.

1548
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:24,199
Right down here is Uranus.

1549
00:53:24,239 --> 00:53:25,199
Okay.

1550
00:53:25,239 --> 00:53:28,199
Oh, you can't see me here.

1551
00:53:28,239 --> 00:53:33,199
I'm over here now.

1552
00:53:33,239 --> 00:53:34,199
Okay.

1553
00:53:34,239 --> 00:53:35,889
So what we have is Pluto and

1554
00:53:35,889 --> 00:53:37,199
Uranus, right?

1555
00:53:37,239 --> 00:53:39,159
The prospect could sometimes go up

1556
00:53:39,159 --> 00:53:40,199
here, right?

1557
00:53:40,239 --> 00:53:41,630
And we want to always stay right

1558
00:53:41,780 --> 00:53:42,199
here.

1559
00:53:42,239 --> 00:53:44,340
This is the open and this is the

1560
00:53:44,340 --> 00:53:45,079
close.

1561
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:46,079
Okay.

1562
00:53:46,119 --> 00:53:47,460
And so what happens is prospects

1563
00:53:47,489 --> 00:53:48,800
will go over here and my dog did

1564
00:53:48,809 --> 00:53:50,079
this and blah, blah, blah.

1565
00:53:50,119 --> 00:53:52,059
And then like, oh, like, you know,

1566
00:53:52,059 --> 00:53:54,079
my, my aunt Sally's from Alabama.

1567
00:53:54,119 --> 00:53:55,940
And then, oh, and what we have to

1568
00:53:55,940 --> 00:53:57,480
do is keep them on a straight

1569
00:53:57,480 --> 00:53:58,079
line.

1570
00:53:58,119 --> 00:53:59,519
And the way we do that is by

1571
00:53:59,659 --> 00:54:01,960
addressing all of their concerns,

1572
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:03,960
understanding all their desires,

1573
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,750
and then all the problems they

1574
00:54:05,750 --> 00:54:07,690
have currently and showing them

1575
00:54:07,690 --> 00:54:10,690
how our product not only solves

1576
00:54:10,739 --> 00:54:12,130
all their problems, meets all

1577
00:54:12,190 --> 00:54:13,789
their desires, but also handles

1578
00:54:13,789 --> 00:54:14,960
all their concerns.

1579
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,389
And on top of that, everything

1580
00:54:16,570 --> 00:54:18,250
they've tried previously, I'm

1581
00:54:18,250 --> 00:54:18,840
going to put tried.

1582
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:20,610
This is better in every single

1583
00:54:20,610 --> 00:54:21,079
way.

1584
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:22,730
And so we're doing that through a

1585
00:54:22,730 --> 00:54:23,710
straight line.

1586
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:24,829
And so that's what a straight line

1587
00:54:24,829 --> 00:54:26,070
methodology is, by the way, guys,

1588
00:54:26,079 --> 00:54:26,880
great stuff that you should

1589
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:27,909
research on YouTube, by the way.

1590
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,389
So let's get back to it.

1591
00:54:29,559 --> 00:54:30,550
I don't want to spend too long on

1592
00:54:30,599 --> 00:54:30,909
that.

1593
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:34,210
So let's go and let's pull me over

1594
00:54:34,210 --> 00:54:35,119
here.

1595
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:43,650
Let's take this, bring this down

1596
00:54:43,650 --> 00:54:46,989
to 12.

1597
00:54:47,079 --> 00:54:47,880
Okay.

1598
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:48,900
Not the bold.

1599
00:54:49,719 --> 00:54:50,929
Okay.

1600
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,849
I don't really need customer

1601
00:54:52,909 --> 00:54:53,920
verticals.

1602
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:55,280
You may need that section.

1603
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:57,070
You may have several different

1604
00:54:57,070 --> 00:54:59,440
verticals that you work with.

1605
00:54:59,719 --> 00:55:01,110
And so as a result, you know, you

1606
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:03,400
may be kind of like, Hey, uh, I

1607
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:04,000
don't want to write this

1608
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:05,469
for, you know, I have it for, it

1609
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:06,840
works for SAS companies.

1610
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:08,219
It works also for lead gen

1611
00:55:08,219 --> 00:55:10,139
agencies or marketing agencies or

1612
00:55:10,139 --> 00:55:10,920
whatever.

1613
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:13,119
Um, I personally don't have that.

1614
00:55:13,159 --> 00:55:14,260
It's info product people.

1615
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:15,690
So it's like, I don't need that

1616
00:55:15,690 --> 00:55:15,880
now.

1617
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:18,900
This next question is really

1618
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:20,079
useful.

1619
00:55:20,119 --> 00:55:20,519
Okay.

1620
00:55:21,199 --> 00:55:28,559
So remember how I said the IED

1621
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:29,639
intro identifier?

1622
00:55:29,659 --> 00:55:30,119
I'm going to add a lot of

1623
00:55:30,329 --> 00:55:33,860
questions, empathy questions, and

1624
00:55:33,860 --> 00:55:36,369
then opportunity

1625
00:55:37,079 --> 00:55:40,000
questions.

1626
00:55:40,039 --> 00:55:43,750
So I can go through and explain

1627
00:55:43,750 --> 00:55:47,079
these three right here.

1628
00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:48,099
And so what I want to do is I want

1629
00:55:48,119 --> 00:55:49,400
to come back here and I'm going to

1630
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:49,679
say,

1631
00:55:51,519 --> 00:55:53,119
I would like for you to provide me

1632
00:55:53,119 --> 00:55:57,679
with 10 questions for three

1633
00:55:57,920 --> 00:55:59,440
separate categories of questions.

1634
00:56:00,119 --> 00:56:04,320
The first is empathy.

1635
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:08,739
Identifier questions, which are

1636
00:56:08,739 --> 00:56:10,329
intended to call out to the

1637
00:56:10,349 --> 00:56:11,980
audience to get them to raise

1638
00:56:12,110 --> 00:56:13,800
their hand and say, yes, I am this

1639
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:14,159
person.

1640
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:18,150
The next type of question is an

1641
00:56:18,190 --> 00:56:20,000
empathy based question.

1642
00:56:20,039 --> 00:56:22,000
This is intended to explain the

1643
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,360
customer's problem.

1644
00:56:24,039 --> 00:56:26,239
Prospects.

1645
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:30,309
and makes them want to learn more

1646
00:56:30,309 --> 00:56:30,719
about what I have to offer.

1647
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:32,090
This is an opportunity based

1648
00:56:32,099 --> 00:56:32,269
question in a way that shows that

1649
00:56:32,289 --> 00:56:32,789
I understand their current

1650
00:56:32,849 --> 00:56:34,719
situation.

1651
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:35,630
And the last type of question is

1652
00:56:35,630 --> 00:56:36,719
an opportunity based question.

1653
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:39,239
This is a question that has a

1654
00:56:39,250 --> 00:56:50,840
direct benefit to the prospect.

1655
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:53,730
And makes them want to learn more

1656
00:56:53,739 --> 00:56:56,360
about what I have to offer.

1657
00:56:56,400 --> 00:57:00,789
I would like for you to provide

1658
00:57:00,789 --> 00:57:03,820
again, 10 questions for each one

1659
00:57:03,869 --> 00:57:04,960
of these sections.

1660
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:11,960
Okay.

1661
00:57:12,639 --> 00:57:28,019
So I like some of these, um, but

1662
00:57:28,019 --> 00:57:30,059
at the same time, I'd like for it

1663
00:57:30,059 --> 00:57:34,039
to be a little bit more robust.

1664
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:35,599
So we'll go into that in a bit.

1665
00:57:42,400 --> 00:58:02,699
I would like for the identifier

1666
00:58:02,699 --> 00:58:03,949
questions to all say, are you an

1667
00:58:03,949 --> 00:58:04,119
info product business owner?

1668
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:07,159
Are you an info product business

1669
00:58:07,159 --> 00:58:10,340
owner and then have the identifier

1670
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:13,099
questions that you created for me

1671
00:58:13,559 --> 00:58:16,000
afterwards attached to them?

1672
00:58:16,679 --> 00:58:18,760
Okay.

1673
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:19,690
So that's just a nuanced thing

1674
00:58:19,690 --> 00:58:20,190
right there.

1675
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:21,260
So that's all pretty good.

1676
00:58:21,559 --> 00:58:22,949
So I'm going to pick the best one

1677
00:58:22,949 --> 00:58:24,750
and those will be in my VSL and

1678
00:58:24,780 --> 00:58:26,019
I'll decide that when I get there.

1679
00:58:26,079 --> 00:58:26,480
Oh, shit.

1680
00:58:26,519 --> 00:58:27,360
What the heck's going on here?

1681
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:29,300
Oh, a lot of new features today

1682
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:29,800
from GPT.

1683
00:58:29,829 --> 00:58:30,559
I've never seen this before

1684
00:58:30,559 --> 00:58:30,800
either.

1685
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:45,199
I'm going to go with this one.

1686
00:58:45,860 --> 00:58:50,500
Let's pause this real quick while

1687
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:51,079
we keep this going.

1688
00:58:52,199 --> 00:58:52,800
Okay.

1689
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:54,039
So now I just wanted to give me

1690
00:58:54,039 --> 00:58:54,710
all of them.

1691
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:55,480
Oh, shit.

1692
00:58:56,159 --> 00:58:57,760
There we go.

1693
00:58:57,800 --> 00:58:58,559
Let's get into that.

1694
00:58:59,239 --> 00:59:00,880
Wow.

1695
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:01,269
Okay.

1696
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:02,769
So we can see now we have, are you

1697
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:03,909
all this, right?

1698
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:06,159
So on and so forth.

1699
00:59:06,199 --> 00:59:06,800
Okay.

1700
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:08,980
So I can now ask those questions

1701
00:59:08,980 --> 00:59:09,599
in my VSL.

1702
00:59:10,260 --> 00:59:13,119
And so here we go.

1703
00:59:13,159 --> 00:59:14,000
Let it keep going.

1704
00:59:14,039 --> 00:59:14,239
Boom.

1705
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:14,630
There we go.

1706
00:59:14,679 --> 00:59:18,190
So we are going to now take all of

1707
00:59:18,250 --> 00:59:20,639
this and put it into our document.

1708
00:59:20,679 --> 00:59:20,960
Okay.

1709
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:21,039
Okay.

1710
00:59:21,079 --> 00:59:21,920
Opportunity based questions.

1711
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:22,239
Thank you.

1712
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:22,480
Thank you.

1713
00:59:22,519 --> 00:59:22,719
Thank you.

1714
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:22,960
Thank you.

1715
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:23,199
Okay.

1716
00:59:23,239 --> 00:59:24,230
So we'll take all that and put it

1717
00:59:24,239 --> 00:59:24,960
in our document.

1718
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:25,829
And then guess what guys we're

1719
00:59:25,829 --> 00:59:26,239
done now.

1720
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:27,260
So we have the creative brief

1721
00:59:27,329 --> 00:59:27,670
done.

1722
00:59:27,719 --> 00:59:29,449
We've got it done in approximately

1723
00:59:29,449 --> 00:59:31,239
one hour, about 59 minutes.

1724
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:32,230
You know, I paused a couple of

1725
00:59:32,230 --> 00:59:32,639
times.

1726
00:59:32,679 --> 00:59:33,989
I never paused for more than like

1727
00:59:33,989 --> 00:59:34,880
a minute at a time.

1728
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:36,920
And you guys saw me coming back

1729
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:37,349
and right.

1730
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:38,570
It's not like I'd be paused.

1731
00:59:38,679 --> 00:59:39,570
And then all of a sudden there's

1732
00:59:39,570 --> 00:59:40,400
like a huge block done.

1733
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:41,539
Like it was like little things.

1734
00:59:41,639 --> 00:59:42,630
Like I just wanted to let chat to

1735
00:59:42,639 --> 00:59:43,030
BT load.

1736
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:45,630
So you could see, you can get this

1737
00:59:45,650 --> 00:59:46,800
thing done in like an hour.

1738
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:49,070
Do not let this thing take three

1739
00:59:49,070 --> 00:59:49,760
days.

1740
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:52,380
And you can see clearly that it's

1741
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:54,449
a lot easier for me to spend time

1742
00:59:54,449 --> 00:59:56,610
on this when I'm already

1743
00:59:56,679 --> 00:59:57,949
really understanding of my

1744
00:59:57,949 --> 00:59:59,670
audience and really understanding

1745
00:59:59,670 --> 01:00:00,400
of my offer.

1746
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:01,730
If you don't know that yet, you

1747
01:00:01,730 --> 01:00:02,989
probably need to do more research

1748
01:00:02,989 --> 01:00:04,159
before you start here.

1749
01:00:04,199 --> 01:00:05,849
Now, remember what I said, guys,

1750
01:00:05,849 --> 01:00:08,039
that like 60% of your time, 50% of

1751
01:00:08,099 --> 01:00:08,699
your time

1752
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:10,000
should be spent on this right

1753
01:00:10,079 --> 01:00:10,320
here.

1754
01:00:10,519 --> 01:00:11,440
Yeah.

1755
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:12,869
Because now think about how easy

1756
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:14,070
it is for us to go and write a

1757
01:00:14,079 --> 01:00:15,519
five to 10 minute video

1758
01:00:15,559 --> 01:00:16,880
with all of this in mind.

1759
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:18,960
This is so easy.

1760
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,000
So now what I can do.

1761
01:00:20,039 --> 01:00:22,159
Is I'm going to go back and take

1762
01:00:22,159 --> 01:00:22,559
this.

1763
01:00:23,239 --> 01:00:27,679
Control C.

1764
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:30,000
Control.

1765
01:00:30,039 --> 01:00:31,030
Oh, shit.

1766
01:00:31,079 --> 01:00:32,059
I'm not going to make that mistake

1767
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:32,469
again.

1768
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:34,000
Boom.

1769
01:00:34,659 --> 01:00:38,880
And then I can go and do that.

1770
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:40,739
Now, guys, I'm going to go and

1771
01:00:40,739 --> 01:00:42,099
format this a little bit just so

1772
01:00:42,099 --> 01:00:42,960
it's pretty for me.

1773
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:43,760
Right.

1774
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:45,070
I'd like for it to be able to be

1775
01:00:45,070 --> 01:00:46,239
easy to scan and read and

1776
01:00:46,239 --> 01:00:47,320
everything like that.

1777
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:48,789
So I'm going to go and do that.

1778
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:50,719
But outside of that, whatever,

1779
01:00:50,719 --> 01:00:52,079
it's going to take me 10 minutes.

1780
01:00:52,110 --> 01:00:52,960
I'll pause it real quick.

1781
01:00:52,989 --> 01:00:53,760
I'll just do that real quick.

1782
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:54,719
Okay.

1783
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:55,849
So we are so back.

1784
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:56,949
So as you can see, I added these a

1785
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:57,760
little like titles.

1786
01:00:57,800 --> 01:00:58,630
So if you want to do that in

1787
01:00:58,630 --> 01:00:59,760
Google docs, all you got to do is

1788
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:01,039
highlight a piece of text

1789
01:01:01,079 --> 01:01:02,469
and then just take it right here.

1790
01:01:02,519 --> 01:01:03,199
Go to title.

1791
01:01:03,239 --> 01:01:03,760
Make it a title.

1792
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:04,400
And then you'll have this.

1793
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:05,829
I can go service brief, promise,

1794
01:01:05,909 --> 01:01:07,360
problem, problem list, so on and

1795
01:01:07,360 --> 01:01:07,840
so forth.

1796
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:08,000
Right.

1797
01:01:08,039 --> 01:01:09,440
And it'll go through everything.

1798
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:10,690
So I could do like bold in and

1799
01:01:10,690 --> 01:01:11,760
make it look pretty.

1800
01:01:11,789 --> 01:01:12,559
I don't really care right now,

1801
01:01:12,559 --> 01:01:12,869
though.

1802
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:14,309
So that took me like a minute.

1803
01:01:14,519 --> 01:01:15,610
Not really that long.

1804
01:01:16,360 --> 01:01:18,199
So we now have our creative brief

1805
01:01:18,210 --> 01:01:18,559
done.

1806
01:01:18,599 --> 01:01:18,880
Cool.

1807
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:20,719
I've done this before.

1808
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:22,349
So I'm kind of like, yeah, I'm

1809
01:01:22,349 --> 01:01:22,719
good.

1810
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:23,849
Like I can move on to it.

1811
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:25,349
Um, you may want to spend more

1812
01:01:25,519 --> 01:01:26,400
time on this.

1813
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:27,829
That's okay, guys.

1814
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:28,969
I don't want to make this video

1815
01:01:28,989 --> 01:01:30,239
three, four hours long.

1816
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:31,670
If you feel like you want to spend

1817
01:01:31,699 --> 01:01:33,159
more time on it and add more to

1818
01:01:33,159 --> 01:01:34,550
it, that's solid.

1819
01:01:34,599 --> 01:01:35,909
Just make sure that you remember

1820
01:01:35,909 --> 01:01:36,559
what I said.

1821
01:01:36,599 --> 01:01:37,989
Do not let this take three days.

1822
01:01:38,039 --> 01:01:39,139
Do not let this take four days.

1823
01:01:39,239 --> 01:01:40,170
Get this done in like a day or

1824
01:01:40,170 --> 01:01:40,480
two.

1825
01:01:40,519 --> 01:01:41,400
If you want to do four or five

1826
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:42,559
hours on it, that's fine.

1827
01:01:42,599 --> 01:01:43,039
That's fine.

1828
01:01:43,079 --> 01:01:43,429
That's great.

1829
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:44,710
You're going to get a lot of good

1830
01:01:44,710 --> 01:01:46,559
stuff out of it, but do not let it

1831
01:01:46,559 --> 01:01:48,079
take three, four days.

1832
01:01:48,119 --> 01:01:48,559
Okay.

1833
01:01:48,599 --> 01:01:49,989
So that's everything for today,

1834
01:01:50,050 --> 01:01:50,469
guys.

1835
01:01:50,519 --> 01:01:51,730
We're going to now move on to

1836
01:01:51,730 --> 01:01:52,320
writing.

1837
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:52,639
Okay.

1838
01:01:52,679 --> 01:01:53,300
So now we're going to move on to

1839
01:01:53,329 --> 01:01:54,079
the next section, which is going

1840
01:01:54,219 --> 01:01:54,559
to be writing.

1841
01:01:54,599 --> 01:01:55,710
And I'm going to show you again,

1842
01:01:55,710 --> 01:01:56,780
really easy to get the writing

1843
01:01:56,780 --> 01:01:57,440
script done.

1844
01:01:57,480 --> 01:02:00,360
So let's go and let's dive right

1845
01:02:00,360 --> 01:02:01,679
into that.
