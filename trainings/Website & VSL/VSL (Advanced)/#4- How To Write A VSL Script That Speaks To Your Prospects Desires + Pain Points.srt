1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,080
Alrighty, here we are.

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:03,970
We're back again, talking about

3
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:05,710
how to create a Bangor VSL for

4
00:00:05,719 --> 00:00:07,000
your B2B service offer.

5
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,859
So what we're going to do is talk

6
00:00:08,859 --> 00:00:10,320
about exactly that.

7
00:00:10,359 --> 00:00:11,980
But in today's module, we are

8
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:13,710
talking about how to write a VSL

9
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:15,179
script that speaks to your

10
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:17,329
prospects, desires and pain points

11
00:00:17,329 --> 00:00:19,010
and incentivizes them to book a

12
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:19,980
call with you.

13
00:00:20,019 --> 00:00:22,079
OK, so in order for us to do that,

14
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:24,000
in order for us to be able to get

15
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,109
them to book a call with you, we

16
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:28,219
need to speak to their desires.

17
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,210
What do they want?

18
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:30,379
And also address their pain

19
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:30,980
points.

20
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:32,570
OK, when we do this, we're doing a

21
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:34,100
little something called direct

22
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:34,780
response.

23
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,899
OK, so here's a quick overview of

24
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:38,240
direct response.

25
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,810
This is a very in-depth field, but

26
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,609
I'm going to give you an 80-20

27
00:00:41,609 --> 00:00:42,939
course on it right now.

28
00:00:42,979 --> 00:00:46,060
OK, so direct response marketing

29
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:48,469
is a style of marketing that

30
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:51,560
elicits a direct response to turn

31
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:55,189
attention into a specific outcome.

32
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,500
OK, it turns attention into a

33
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:58,979
specific outcome.

34
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:00,679
How do we get attention?

35
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,520
We speak to their desires and pain

36
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,159
points.

37
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,719
OK, how do we get a specific

38
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:05,500
outcome?

39
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:08,719
We ask for a direct response.

40
00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:10,810
Super simple.

41
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:12,439
I know copywriters that have been

42
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:14,010
in this game for three years and,

43
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:15,840
like, never were able to piece

44
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,730
together why it's called direct

45
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:18,519
response.

46
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,609
And people that have known about

47
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,969
direct response but never thought

48
00:01:23,129 --> 00:01:25,159
that the name itself implicitly

49
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:28,280
implies what it is.

50
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,450
So people think DR and direct

51
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:33,260
response means, like, spammy sales

52
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:36,150
letters, like those 60-page long

53
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:38,069
ones, like for old people where

54
00:01:38,069 --> 00:01:39,620
they have dementia and it's like

55
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:41,170
selling them on some snake oil,

56
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:42,599
you know, bullshit supplement.

57
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,280
That's not the case, guys.

58
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:45,780
Companies have definitely used

59
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,269
direct response to do that, but

60
00:01:47,269 --> 00:01:48,920
direct response is just a tool.

61
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:49,939
And a tool can be used in a lot of

62
00:01:49,939 --> 00:01:50,680
different ways.

63
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:52,310
I can have a hammer that I can use

64
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:54,000
to hang a portrait on the wall for

65
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,620
my grandma, and I can have a

66
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:57,370
hammer that also can be used to

67
00:01:57,370 --> 00:01:59,060
break someone's kneecap.

68
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:02,069
You can use it in many different

69
00:02:02,069 --> 00:02:02,799
ways, a tool.

70
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,900
So everything you guys do in

71
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:07,500
regards to marketing a product or

72
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:09,550
a service should be direct

73
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:10,680
response.

74
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:12,639
Except for, like, branding and

75
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:14,669
content, pretty much everything

76
00:02:14,669 --> 00:02:16,439
should be direct response.

77
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:18,120
Because it's the only way to truly

78
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,819
see if marketing was effective or

79
00:02:19,819 --> 00:02:20,240
not.

80
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,849
Remember those ads that you would

81
00:02:21,849 --> 00:02:23,629
see on TV for, like, a product?

82
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,870
It was, hey, Billy Mays here with

83
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:25,939
a fantastic new product.

84
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,099
If you guys are not from America,

85
00:02:27,099 --> 00:02:28,259
you're not going to know what that

86
00:02:28,259 --> 00:02:28,569
is.

87
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:30,120
But Americans, my fellow

88
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,360
Americans, you know what I'm

89
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:32,669
talking about, where there's

90
00:02:32,669 --> 00:02:33,400
someone on TV.

91
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:34,020
It's Billy Mays.

92
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:34,900
He's yelling at you, telling him

93
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:35,759
about this, you know, amazing

94
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:36,120
product.

95
00:02:36,219 --> 00:02:37,689
And there's a phone number on the

96
00:02:37,689 --> 00:02:38,240
bottom.

97
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,360
And it's saying, call this right

98
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,349
now, and you're going to get this

99
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,479
free plus shipping exclusive

100
00:02:41,509 --> 00:02:42,020
package.

101
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:42,979
And we're going to send you also

102
00:02:42,979 --> 00:02:44,039
all these bonuses and everything

103
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:45,060
like that, you know, to call the

104
00:02:45,069 --> 00:02:45,740
number to buy.

105
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:46,180
Okay?

106
00:02:46,219 --> 00:02:47,229
We were probably too young, or

107
00:02:47,229 --> 00:02:48,270
maybe you're older and you were

108
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:49,250
calling those numbers.

109
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:50,439
But, you know, you remember seeing

110
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:51,379
those commercials, right?

111
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:52,490
Here's what a lot of people don't

112
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:52,840
know.

113
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,080
On the different commercials, on

114
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,289
different channels, they would

115
00:02:55,289 --> 00:02:56,409
change the phone numbers.

116
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:57,659
So, like, the golf channel would

117
00:02:57,659 --> 00:02:58,740
get its own phone number.

118
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:01,530
The home network would get its own

119
00:03:01,569 --> 00:03:02,819
phone number.

120
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,250
Nickelodeon would get its own

121
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:04,939
phone number.

122
00:03:05,139 --> 00:03:06,280
Why is that?

123
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,949
Because they wanted to track which

124
00:03:08,949 --> 00:03:11,460
channel was getting the highest

125
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:13,169
level of response.

126
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,569
So, you need to do the same thing

127
00:03:15,569 --> 00:03:16,060
as well.

128
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:18,229
Whenever you're testing something,

129
00:03:18,229 --> 00:03:19,590
you need to be able to test

130
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:21,319
whether or not one form of a VSL

131
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:23,159
or another form of VSL or one

132
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:25,289
platform or another platform is

133
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,419
getting you better response.

134
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,020
Otherwise, here's something that

135
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,349
you should keep in mind is you're

136
00:03:30,349 --> 00:03:31,629
going to be wasting your time if

137
00:03:31,629 --> 00:03:32,759
you're not doing that.

138
00:03:32,939 --> 00:03:33,979
So, perfect example of this, guys.

139
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,740
I have a free group and I was

140
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,659
looking at my revenue from my

141
00:03:37,659 --> 00:03:39,759
offers that I sell and I looked at

142
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:42,219
it and 10% of my revenue came from

143
00:03:42,289 --> 00:03:43,430
my free group.

144
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:46,469
But, like, 40% to 50% of my time

145
00:03:46,469 --> 00:03:48,620
was being spent on my free group.

146
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:51,129
And so, I see that and I'm like,

147
00:03:51,129 --> 00:03:53,280
okay, that's not good.

148
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:55,310
That implies that it's not like a

149
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:57,199
small sample size either.

150
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,900
It's been like a few months now.

151
00:03:58,939 --> 00:04:00,639
And so, I'm like, okay, something

152
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:02,020
needs to change here because

153
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:03,400
either A, I need to make more

154
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:04,599
offers to my free group or

155
00:04:04,659 --> 00:04:06,289
something's not right here.

156
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:08,509
So, that made me look at that and

157
00:04:08,509 --> 00:04:10,240
go, hmm, it's not good.

158
00:04:10,349 --> 00:04:11,319
I'm not getting the right amount

159
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:12,400
of response I want from there.

160
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:13,509
I am getting a really good

161
00:04:13,509 --> 00:04:15,039
response, though, from talking

162
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:16,199
with people and getting on

163
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:17,600
networking calls and, like,

164
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,310
coaching people and offering stuff

165
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:20,800
to people's communities and stuff

166
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,420
like that.

167
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:23,120
So, it makes me think then, okay,

168
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,649
hey, I should do more of that and

169
00:04:24,649 --> 00:04:26,100
less of the other thing.

170
00:04:26,139 --> 00:04:26,670
See what I mean?

171
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,170
I should advertise more on

172
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:29,750
Nickelodeon and less on Golf

173
00:04:29,779 --> 00:04:30,480
Channel.

174
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,579
See what I mean?

175
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:32,939
That's how to think about this

176
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:33,680
stuff, guys.

177
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,360
And so, when it comes to your VSL,

178
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,569
when you're just starting out, you

179
00:04:36,569 --> 00:04:37,660
don't really need to think about

180
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:38,540
that all that much.

181
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:40,329
But you do need to be able to see,

182
00:04:40,329 --> 00:04:42,209
hey, have I gotten any book calls

183
00:04:42,209 --> 00:04:43,300
from this VSL?

184
00:04:43,339 --> 00:04:44,870
If you've sent out a shit ton of

185
00:04:44,899 --> 00:04:46,740
emails to it, and I mean, like, a

186
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,399
thousand plus, like, a ton of

187
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:50,310
people have, and I'm talking about

188
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:52,029
responses, not you sent out a

189
00:04:52,029 --> 00:04:53,589
thousand emails, responses of

190
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:55,189
people wanting to see the VSL and

191
00:04:55,189 --> 00:04:56,410
have actually gone to your

192
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:57,060
website.

193
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,990
You've gotten a thousand views and

194
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:00,449
nobody has booked a call,

195
00:05:00,449 --> 00:05:02,589
something's up to your VSL, okay?

196
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:03,899
And so, you need to be able to

197
00:05:03,899 --> 00:05:04,560
notice that.

198
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,540
So, we track these things.

199
00:05:06,579 --> 00:05:07,730
Now, when you're first starting

200
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:08,860
out, just get one VSL up there,

201
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:09,540
and that's it.

202
00:05:09,579 --> 00:05:10,500
If you're a bit more advanced,

203
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,470
maybe you have a little bit more

204
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:12,560
cushion on your revenue, you have

205
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,990
employees, you have time, it may

206
00:05:14,139 --> 00:05:15,939
be worth your time to go and test

207
00:05:15,939 --> 00:05:17,769
two different VSLs and split test

208
00:05:17,769 --> 00:05:19,079
which one people are landing on so

209
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:20,019
you can see which form of

210
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:21,519
messaging appeals more with them.

211
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:22,829
If you're just starting out, don't

212
00:05:22,829 --> 00:05:23,459
worry about that.

213
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,560
But, again, the reason why you

214
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,430
need to get good at direct

215
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:26,430
response and copywriting in

216
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:27,259
general is because you're

217
00:05:27,329 --> 00:05:28,410
constantly going to be testing

218
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:29,019
like this.

219
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,399
You need to be able to think like

220
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:31,660
this so you can see, like I did

221
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:33,050
with my group, hey, this is not

222
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:33,550
right.

223
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:34,480
This is what I should be doing

224
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:34,889
instead.

225
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:36,649
That's why you need to understand

226
00:05:36,649 --> 00:05:37,240
direct response.

227
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:39,220
Otherwise, you're wasting your

228
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:39,750
time.

229
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,519
Direct response principles to

230
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:42,160
follow.

231
00:05:42,189 --> 00:05:42,910
I'm going to give you guys a

232
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:43,920
little master class right now.

233
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:44,220
Okay.

234
00:05:44,459 --> 00:05:45,709
So, ladies and gentlemen, say it

235
00:05:45,709 --> 00:05:46,160
with me.

236
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:48,649
Nobody cares about your shiny

237
00:05:48,649 --> 00:05:49,360
shit.

238
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:49,920
Say it with me.

239
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:50,180
Come on.

240
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:50,740
You didn't say it.

241
00:05:50,779 --> 00:05:52,689
Nobody cares about your shiny

242
00:05:52,689 --> 00:05:53,250
shit.

243
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:54,019
Say it out loud.

244
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,680
Just say it right now by yourself.

245
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,120
Say it.

246
00:05:56,879 --> 00:05:59,910
Nobody cares about your shiny

247
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,129
shit.

248
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:03,189
If you could write one principle

249
00:06:03,189 --> 00:06:05,370
with the golden arches above you,

250
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:07,480
in your office, in your house,

251
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,779
above every door, on your bathroom

252
00:06:09,779 --> 00:06:11,250
mirror, if you have an Expo

253
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:12,670
marker, go write this on your

254
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:13,240
mirror.

255
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:16,089
Nobody cares about your shiny

256
00:06:16,089 --> 00:06:16,699
shit.

257
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:19,449
This one principle will increase

258
00:06:19,449 --> 00:06:22,230
your marketing IQ by 60 points

259
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,379
minimum.

260
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:25,220
Guaranteed or you don't pay.

261
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:25,839
I'm just kidding.

262
00:06:25,899 --> 00:06:27,430
But seriously, guys, nobody cares

263
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:28,560
about your shiny shit.

264
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,740
I see this all the time.

265
00:06:29,779 --> 00:06:31,829
Copywriters, marketers, I offer

266
00:06:32,019 --> 00:06:33,529
this and this and all these

267
00:06:33,529 --> 00:06:35,300
amazing features and all this

268
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:36,079
stuff.

269
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,100
Nobody cares.

270
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:38,420
Nobody cares.

271
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:39,600
Nobody.

272
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:41,500
Nobody cares about your shiny

273
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,060
shit.

274
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,189
They care about the shit they got

275
00:06:43,189 --> 00:06:43,629
going on.

276
00:06:43,699 --> 00:06:45,740
They care about what is going on

277
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,879
in their world and their problems

278
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:49,439
and their desires.

279
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:51,779
They do not care about you at all.

280
00:06:51,819 --> 00:06:54,069
Unless you're Dwayne the Rock

281
00:06:54,069 --> 00:06:56,009
Johnson or Alex Hermosi or

282
00:06:56,389 --> 00:06:58,899
Leonardo DiCaprio or like, I don't

283
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:00,019
know, David Goggins.

284
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,889
People don't care about you unless

285
00:07:01,899 --> 00:07:03,389
you're a celebrity, which I have

286
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:04,660
not met a celebrity in client

287
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:05,620
ascension yet.

288
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:06,899
If David Goggins is watching this

289
00:07:06,899 --> 00:07:08,319
right now, right on, brother.

290
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,420
But most of you guys are not in

291
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:13,100
client ascension as celebrities.

292
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:15,259
You're not doing that.

293
00:07:15,379 --> 00:07:17,259
So if that's the case, I mean, can

294
00:07:17,259 --> 00:07:18,800
you imagine a David Goggins

295
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,459
agency?

296
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:20,279
That'd be sick, right?

297
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,800
He's like, I'm going to show you

298
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,399
how to carry the boats guaranteed

299
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:24,500
or you don't pay.

300
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:25,579
Like, that's probably what's going

301
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:25,980
to happen.

302
00:07:26,019 --> 00:07:27,240
But no, like we're not doing that.

303
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:28,199
Stop being silly for a sec.

304
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,360
Like, guys, you're not a

305
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,459
celebrity.

306
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,720
Think about that.

307
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:34,069
If you're not a celebrity, why the

308
00:07:34,069 --> 00:07:35,120
fuck are you talking about

309
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,410
yourself and your stuff and your

310
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:37,740
features and your product and all

311
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:38,480
that stuff?

312
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:39,689
Now, this may come off as, you

313
00:07:39,689 --> 00:07:40,930
know, something that you guys

314
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:42,069
haven't heard before.

315
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,310
And so you may be thinking, well,

316
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:44,420
how are people going to know how

317
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:45,300
to buy my product?

318
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:46,060
Great crop.

319
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,060
Great, great question.

320
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:47,680
Great question.

321
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:48,839
Amazing question.

322
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:49,459
I almost said that wrong.

323
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:50,199
Great question.

324
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,870
The only way you get them to care

325
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:54,350
about your product is by showing

326
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,569
that you understand their

327
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:57,019
situation better than they can

328
00:07:57,019 --> 00:07:58,350
explain it themselves.

329
00:07:58,439 --> 00:07:59,660
It's called preeminence.

330
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:00,920
If you can achieve that, you are

331
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,110
going to have it where they're

332
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:03,350
interested in finding out more

333
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,370
about your product.

334
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:06,449
You need to focus more on their

335
00:08:06,449 --> 00:08:09,009
situation, on their shit, not your

336
00:08:09,009 --> 00:08:10,779
shit, on their shit.

337
00:08:10,819 --> 00:08:12,240
And that will make it a lot easier

338
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,610
for you to be able to talk about

339
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:15,019
your product and actually get a

340
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,560
response from it because they know

341
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:17,889
you understand their current

342
00:08:18,029 --> 00:08:19,639
situation and their desires.

343
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,500
Make sense?

344
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,259
Make sense.

345
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,339
One more time, everybody.

346
00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:23,100
Say it out loud.

347
00:08:23,139 --> 00:08:25,689
Nobody cares about your shiny

348
00:08:25,689 --> 00:08:26,439
shit.

349
00:08:27,209 --> 00:08:29,560
Solid.

350
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:30,360
Okay.

351
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:30,980
Next.

352
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,090
You want to enter the conversation

353
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,379
going on in the prospect's head.

354
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:36,590
And the only way to find that is

355
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:37,509
with good research.

356
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:38,320
Okay.

357
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,309
So that's what I was talking about

358
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:40,019
with preeminence.

359
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:41,570
You being able to explain what's

360
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:43,190
going on in their business better

361
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,190
than they can explain it, that is

362
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:46,659
preeminence.

363
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,019
And that's what we want.

364
00:08:48,059 --> 00:08:49,269
We want to have preeminence as

365
00:08:49,269 --> 00:08:50,909
consultants and as agency owners.

366
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,090
We want to be able to have the

367
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:53,559
ability to explain our prospect's

368
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:54,990
problem better than they can ever

369
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:56,220
explain it themselves.

370
00:08:56,259 --> 00:08:57,629
And the only way you find that is

371
00:08:57,629 --> 00:08:58,720
with good research.

372
00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:00,389
Good research is either going to

373
00:09:00,389 --> 00:09:01,610
be from diving deep on the

374
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:02,440
internet.

375
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,899
I think ChatCPT is way better for

376
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:04,360
that.

377
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,200
And I'm going to be showing you

378
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:05,950
guys how to do that in the demo

379
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:06,340
videos.

380
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,580
One of the demo videos.

381
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,179
I'm not sure which one.

382
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,750
But then on top of that, also

383
00:09:09,779 --> 00:09:11,570
talking to your prospects.

384
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:12,929
Literally getting on the phone and

385
00:09:12,929 --> 00:09:13,679
talking with them.

386
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:15,460
If you don't have access to a lot

387
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:17,120
of your prospects just yet because

388
00:09:17,149 --> 00:09:18,809
you're starting now, right, you

389
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:20,269
can just go and you can just do it

390
00:09:20,269 --> 00:09:21,750
on ChatCPT and do research that

391
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:22,379
way.

392
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:24,169
However, if you have a previous

393
00:09:24,169 --> 00:09:25,820
client roster, literally just, and

394
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,269
even an existing client roster,

395
00:09:27,389 --> 00:09:28,490
just ask them, can we get on a

396
00:09:28,539 --> 00:09:29,480
call real quick?

397
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:30,519
I just have a couple questions to

398
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:30,899
ask you.

399
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:31,970
And if any of your clients are

400
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:33,190
being difficult to, oh, no, I

401
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:34,289
don't want to get on the call or

402
00:09:34,289 --> 00:09:35,350
whatever, like offer them

403
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:36,059
something.

404
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,769
But for the most part, all of them

405
00:09:37,769 --> 00:09:38,950
are going to be cool.

406
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:40,399
Just say, I had a 50-minute call.

407
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,279
This won't take up a lot of your

408
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:41,600
time.

409
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:43,059
I just have a quick question for

410
00:09:43,059 --> 00:09:43,440
you.

411
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,230
It'll be super useful for my

412
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:44,639
business.

413
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:45,440
Is that okay if we do that?

414
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,779
I cannot imagine any of your

415
00:09:46,779 --> 00:09:48,000
clients are going to be like, no,

416
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,110
fuck you, like, right?

417
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:50,620
So don't worry about that.

418
00:09:50,659 --> 00:09:52,019
Next one.

419
00:09:52,059 --> 00:09:53,769
The best direct response is a

420
00:09:53,769 --> 00:09:55,580
perfect blend of EQ and IQ.

421
00:09:55,639 --> 00:09:57,210
So there's a specific guru whose

422
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:58,580
name shall not be named.

423
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:00,679
And he thought it was a genius

424
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:03,190
idea to go ahead and write a VSL

425
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,899
and a little doc, whatever, loom

426
00:10:05,899 --> 00:10:08,429
doc, that had just disgusting

427
00:10:08,429 --> 00:10:10,990
amount of math equations on it and

428
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:12,960
was all very high-level financial

429
00:10:13,009 --> 00:10:15,000
math and everything like that.

430
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,389
And he thought that was a good

431
00:10:17,389 --> 00:10:18,070
offer.

432
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,179
And a lot of people bought.

433
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:20,759
Why?

434
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,919
Because they're like, wow, look

435
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:22,779
how smart that guy is.

436
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,000
You know what ended up happening

437
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,080
that nobody talks about?

438
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,169
Like 80% of people refunded.

439
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,759
There was a very aggressive

440
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:29,960
guarantee on it.

441
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,159
He could not fulfill on it.

442
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,909
And like 80% of people refunded on

443
00:10:32,909 --> 00:10:33,240
it.

444
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:34,580
And it was like, wow, people

445
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:35,879
bought because it was really

446
00:10:35,889 --> 00:10:36,360
smart.

447
00:10:36,419 --> 00:10:38,120
But here's the thing, guys, is

448
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,909
like, was it because of the offer

449
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:41,649
or was it because he was a notable

450
00:10:41,649 --> 00:10:43,129
guru who'd been around for a

451
00:10:43,129 --> 00:10:44,460
while, who'd already had a lot of

452
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:45,019
case studies?

453
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,370
And then he came up short on that,

454
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:47,679
which wasn't why they bought them

455
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:48,879
by because he came up short.

456
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,019
They bought because of his

457
00:10:50,019 --> 00:10:51,039
previous track record.

458
00:10:51,179 --> 00:10:52,740
And unfortunately, though, it

459
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:53,649
didn't matter.

460
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,500
So here's the thing, guys.

461
00:10:55,539 --> 00:10:57,129
He went so heavy on the IQ scale

462
00:10:57,129 --> 00:10:58,720
that there was a lot of people

463
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,289
like me that maybe would have

464
00:11:00,289 --> 00:11:01,809
bought if he could actually

465
00:11:01,809 --> 00:11:03,440
explain it in a way where I felt

466
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:05,289
that it explained my problems and

467
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:06,379
understood.

468
00:11:06,659 --> 00:11:07,879
He understood my situation.

469
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:08,879
He didn't, though.

470
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:09,990
He just talked above me and said

471
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:10,980
how blah, blah, blah, math

472
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:12,210
equations and this big thing and

473
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:13,580
finance, blah, blah, blah, blah,

474
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,840
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,

475
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,480
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

476
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:18,220
And so as a result, I felt really

477
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,370
dumb watching it.

478
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,120
And I was like, I have no idea

479
00:11:20,169 --> 00:11:20,929
what the hell this guy's talking

480
00:11:20,929 --> 00:11:21,240
about.

481
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:22,279
I just stopped watching it.

482
00:11:23,019 --> 00:11:26,039
So you got to realize that good

483
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:30,029
DR, direct response, is EQ and IQ.

484
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,460
It's not just intelligence.

485
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,379
It's not just trying to make

486
00:11:32,379 --> 00:11:33,259
yourself sound smart.

487
00:11:33,299 --> 00:11:34,740
It's also showing that you

488
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,549
understand what the prospect is

489
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:37,629
going through.

490
00:11:37,879 --> 00:11:39,240
You have empathy and you

491
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,399
understand from their shoes, their

492
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:42,289
perspective.

493
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,080
That's good direct response.

494
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,840
Someone should be able to watch

495
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,570
your VSL and be like, I was just

496
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:49,500
thinking that the other day.

497
00:11:49,539 --> 00:11:51,259
That's good direct response.

498
00:11:51,299 --> 00:11:52,179
Okay.

499
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:53,700
Next point.

500
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:55,309
Good marketing, good direct

501
00:11:55,309 --> 00:11:57,419
response is about getting results.

502
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:59,490
You need to show people that you

503
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:00,779
can get results.

504
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,080
Again, guys, I'm just going to

505
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,620
shout this at the top of my lungs.

506
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:07,580
Nobody cares.

507
00:12:07,879 --> 00:12:09,899
About your shiny shit.

508
00:12:10,649 --> 00:12:12,659
Nobody, nobody cares.

509
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,750
Even with your results, case

510
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,879
studies, all that stuff.

511
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:18,159
Guys, here's the thing.

512
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,730
Someone's going to crucify me for

513
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:20,600
saying this.

514
00:12:20,629 --> 00:12:21,080
I don't care.

515
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:21,879
This is the truth.

516
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:23,980
If you can explain someone's

517
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:26,330
problem better than they can

518
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,370
explain it themselves and you can

519
00:12:29,389 --> 00:12:31,669
show them how you can get them

520
00:12:31,669 --> 00:12:33,730
results, you don't need any case

521
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:34,370
studies.

522
00:12:34,419 --> 00:12:36,379
You don't need them.

523
00:12:37,059 --> 00:12:37,980
Will they help?

524
00:12:38,019 --> 00:12:38,879
Absolutely.

525
00:12:38,919 --> 00:12:39,919
Right?

526
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:41,419
But I've seen so many people

527
00:12:41,419 --> 00:12:42,139
struggle.

528
00:12:42,179 --> 00:12:44,610
They have 30 plus case studies and

529
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:46,830
they still struggle to get clients

530
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:48,909
because the case studies are not

531
00:12:48,909 --> 00:12:50,279
what get clients.

532
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:56,250
They'll buy from you because they

533
00:12:56,250 --> 00:13:01,009
have confidence that you can get

534
00:13:01,009 --> 00:13:03,559
them a result.

535
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,649
The whole purpose of the whole

536
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,950
purpose of your VSL should be to

537
00:13:08,169 --> 00:13:10,320
inspire the viewer to think I can

538
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,080
get that result with this person.

539
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,750
Okay?

540
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:16,299
So good marketing revolves around

541
00:13:16,299 --> 00:13:16,860
results.

542
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:18,279
So good marketing revolves around

543
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:18,799
results.

544
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,860
Okay?

545
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,570
Showing the person that you can

546
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:22,639
get them results.

547
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,059
They don't know.

548
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,539
No one's just throwing away money.

549
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,019
We're not in this fake money age

550
00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:29,730
like post-COVID where everyone was

551
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:31,460
just throwing away this government

552
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:33,000
credits that who cares or just do

553
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
it, whatever.

554
00:13:35,269 --> 00:13:37,840
People buy because they want a

555
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,700
specific ROI from you.

556
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,259
You need to show them I am going

557
00:13:42,259 --> 00:13:43,769
to get you a specific ROI.

558
00:13:44,379 --> 00:13:46,940
It may not always be that it's a

559
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:48,710
financial thing.

560
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:49,889
It may not be you give me a

561
00:13:49,889 --> 00:13:50,440
dollar.

562
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,679
I'm going to give you $5 back with

563
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:52,539
like a lead gen offer.

564
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:53,080
Okay?

565
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,090
It could be that I create systems

566
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:57,110
in your business that then speed

567
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:59,000
up your workflow, which then allow

568
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,230
it to be, oh, shit, my camera's

569
00:14:00,269 --> 00:14:00,679
moving.

570
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,059
One sec.

571
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,610
Then allow it for you to be able

572
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:04,320
to save way more time every single

573
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:05,940
week and make it much easier for

574
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,340
you to be able to focus on the

575
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:09,220
things that actually matter.

576
00:14:09,259 --> 00:14:10,240
It could be saving time.

577
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:11,429
It could be that you're helping

578
00:14:11,429 --> 00:14:12,750
them with their relationship.

579
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:13,679
Okay?

580
00:14:13,899 --> 00:14:15,210
And you're going to help them not

581
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:16,200
have the issues in their

582
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:17,019
relationship.

583
00:14:17,059 --> 00:14:19,909
I don't think those people are in

584
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:21,960
client ascension.

585
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,480
They're not.

586
00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:23,580
Okay?

587
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:25,220
So probably not in that route.

588
00:14:25,259 --> 00:14:26,080
Most of you guys are going to be

589
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:26,679
money for money.

590
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,360
And if not, it's going to be money

591
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,970
for like efficiency, money for

592
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,840
systems, money for productivity,

593
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,090
something like that.

594
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:34,639
Money for hiring, like being able

595
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,220
to find the right person, whatever

596
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:36,710
it is.

597
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:37,240
Okay?

598
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,340
So you need to show them that you

599
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:42,220
can get them that specific result.

600
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:44,139
That's what good marketing does.

601
00:14:44,179 --> 00:14:44,759
Okay?

602
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,879
So understand this.

603
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:48,519
Good marketing is not just ego

604
00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:50,269
stroking yourself and making sure

605
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:51,860
that you look good or you feel

606
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:52,960
smart or you look smart.

607
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,399
See the example I talked about

608
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:55,019
earlier.

609
00:14:55,059 --> 00:14:56,490
He looked really smart.

610
00:14:56,539 --> 00:14:58,379
And then what happened afterwards?

611
00:14:58,419 --> 00:14:59,710
Everyone realized, I feel like I

612
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:01,220
just got hoodwinked and they did.

613
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,240
And he refunded a shit ton of

614
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,360
people and then disappeared off

615
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,279
the face of the earth.

616
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,299
So learn from his mistakes.

617
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:07,779
Okay.

618
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:08,399
Next point.

619
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,259
At all times, the prospect is

620
00:15:10,259 --> 00:15:12,340
looking for a reason to leave.

621
00:15:12,379 --> 00:15:14,159
You need to give them a reason to

622
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:14,659
stay.

623
00:15:15,879 --> 00:15:16,919
So how do you do that?

624
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,049
Well, it's a little principle

625
00:15:18,049 --> 00:15:18,899
called open loops.

626
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:21,220
So what if I did this?

627
00:15:21,259 --> 00:15:22,830
What if I said, hey, dude, and

628
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:24,600
we're starting a conversation and

629
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,250
I told them, told you, I got a

630
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:26,990
gift for you that I wanted to give

631
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:27,240
you.

632
00:15:27,269 --> 00:15:28,080
I want to tell you a story real

633
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,070
quick, but I want to give you this

634
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:29,659
gift as well.

635
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:30,720
Can I tell you the story first?

636
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:31,929
You're like, yes, tell me the

637
00:15:31,929 --> 00:15:32,360
story.

638
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:33,210
And then I'm telling you the

639
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:33,580
story.

640
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:34,779
What are the odds that you're

641
00:15:34,779 --> 00:15:36,090
going to leave the conversation

642
00:15:36,129 --> 00:15:37,669
when it's like, oh, wait, there's

643
00:15:37,669 --> 00:15:39,029
this gift that he's going to give

644
00:15:39,029 --> 00:15:39,279
me.

645
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:41,389
That's a very, very specific

646
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:42,820
example of it.

647
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,909
But an open loop is showing that

648
00:15:44,909 --> 00:15:46,850
the person should stay and it

649
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:49,000
gives them a reason to stay.

650
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:51,009
And so really good VSLs have open

651
00:15:51,009 --> 00:15:52,070
loops in them.

652
00:15:52,139 --> 00:15:53,460
There's a specific benefit they're

653
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:54,100
looking for.

654
00:15:54,139 --> 00:15:56,870
And so you should open a lot of

655
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:59,000
loops in your VSLs.

656
00:15:59,179 --> 00:16:00,460
You should give them reasons to

657
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:00,860
stay.

658
00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:02,610
Another way that you do this,

659
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:04,360
okay, is you don't take up too

660
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,639
much of their time.

661
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:07,139
Giving them a reason to stay, it

662
00:16:07,139 --> 00:16:08,460
could be that it's just like a

663
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:10,009
five-minute video, right?

664
00:16:10,059 --> 00:16:11,909
I've seen it where people do these

665
00:16:11,909 --> 00:16:13,789
B2B videos and it's like 25

666
00:16:13,789 --> 00:16:14,899
minutes long.

667
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,600
Guys, I want you to think about

668
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,289
your prospect for a second.

669
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:19,799
They're busy.

670
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,340
They probably have kids.

671
00:16:21,379 --> 00:16:22,559
They probably have a wife.

672
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,580
They have a business.

673
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:25,120
They have employees, right?

674
00:16:25,159 --> 00:16:26,080
They're running a, if you're

675
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,029
targeting the right types of

676
00:16:27,029 --> 00:16:28,580
companies, they're running a big

677
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:28,980
company.

678
00:16:29,019 --> 00:16:31,029
Do you think they have 25 minutes

679
00:16:31,029 --> 00:16:32,539
in their day to listen to you

680
00:16:32,539 --> 00:16:33,690
ramble on a loom?

681
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:38,440
No, they don't.

682
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,100
Respect their time.

683
00:16:40,139 --> 00:16:41,970
Your video should not be more than

684
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:43,340
10 minutes long.

685
00:16:43,379 --> 00:16:44,379
In fact, it should probably be

686
00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:45,360
around five minutes long.

687
00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:46,500
That's the goal.

688
00:16:46,539 --> 00:16:47,419
Make it around five minutes.

689
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:49,519
And people will be like, oh man,

690
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,059
like how do I do that?

691
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,269
We're going to show you how to do

692
00:16:52,269 --> 00:16:52,669
that.

693
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,039
But also, just keep that in mind

694
00:16:54,039 --> 00:16:55,190
the entire time while you're

695
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:55,759
writing.

696
00:16:55,799 --> 00:16:57,840
I can't make this go super long.

697
00:16:57,879 --> 00:16:59,090
I want to make this inherently

698
00:16:59,090 --> 00:16:59,929
simple and inherently

699
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:00,960
straightforward.

700
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,070
I'm going to show you how to do

701
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:02,700
that today.

702
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:03,320
Okay?

703
00:17:03,419 --> 00:17:05,838
So, give them a reason to stay.

704
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,818
It could be through respecting

705
00:17:06,818 --> 00:17:07,930
their time, making it short enough

706
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:09,000
that they have a reason to stay

707
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:09,640
throughout the whole time.

708
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,759
Open loops.

709
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:11,779
Visually appealing.

710
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:12,818
You can make the video visually

711
00:17:12,818 --> 00:17:13,880
appealing with the right editing,

712
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:14,549
all type of stuff.

713
00:17:14,598 --> 00:17:15,180
Okay?

714
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:17,269
So, last but not least, ladies and

715
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:19,289
gentlemen, direct response is an

716
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:21,380
extensive body of information.

717
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:22,440
This is not something that you

718
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,200
learn overnight.

719
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,619
I'm giving you guys some pretty

720
00:17:24,619 --> 00:17:26,088
high-level principles here that

721
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,430
are pretty good for you to just

722
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:28,900
start with if you don't have any

723
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,069
experience at all.

724
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:33,250
And that's not enough though, your

725
00:17:33,259 --> 00:17:35,720
entire career will be filled with

726
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:38,470
direct response related activities

727
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:40,660
because if you plan on selling

728
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,599
things, like a lot of you guys are

729
00:17:42,609 --> 00:17:44,140
starting with offer A right now,

730
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:46,140
and eventually it'll move on to

731
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,799
offer B and it'll evolve into

732
00:17:47,799 --> 00:17:49,000
offer C and offer D.

733
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:50,769
You can ask Daniel, Daniel's

734
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:53,119
produced damn near 20 to 30, I

735
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:55,500
think even maybe 40 different VSLs

736
00:17:55,519 --> 00:17:57,160
for client Ascension.

737
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,009
Eventually your offer will evolve

738
00:18:00,009 --> 00:18:01,430
and you will need to change the

739
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:02,579
VSL and you may change the

740
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:04,130
different style of offer and you

741
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:05,150
may have to change the

742
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:06,599
deliverables or whatever, and

743
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:08,019
you'll change the VSL.

744
00:18:08,059 --> 00:18:09,589
You will always be doing direct

745
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:11,190
response in some way, shape or

746
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:11,680
form.

747
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,779
So, you are whatever your skillset

748
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,130
is, lead gen, e-commerce, graphic

749
00:18:16,289 --> 00:18:18,250
design, video production, and a

750
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:19,269
direct response

751
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:21,000
copywriter/marketer.

752
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:22,539
You always have to be that way.

753
00:18:22,579 --> 00:18:24,289
So, think like that and invest in

754
00:18:24,289 --> 00:18:26,049
your education with the time that

755
00:18:26,049 --> 00:18:27,799
it takes to learn this stuff.

756
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,609
Okay, so a great example of this

757
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:31,099
is going to be a reading list that

758
00:18:31,099 --> 00:18:32,339
I provided for you guys.

759
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:34,130
This is some of the best work that

760
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:36,009
you can consume on direct response

761
00:18:36,009 --> 00:18:37,059
by the legends.

762
00:18:37,099 --> 00:18:39,650
Okay, I would highly recommend you

763
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:42,160
guys go to Kinko's spend 30 bucks

764
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,980
50 bucks and just print out

765
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:45,519
everything and get them in binders

766
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:47,740
and make this your curriculum.

767
00:18:47,779 --> 00:18:48,880
Take it seriously guys.

768
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:49,869
This is this is like really

769
00:18:49,869 --> 00:18:50,680
important stuff.

770
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,460
You know why?

771
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,720
Because it makes you money.

772
00:18:52,759 --> 00:18:53,720
It makes you money.

773
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:54,720
It makes you money.

774
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:55,430
The better you get at direct

775
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:57,200
response and copywriting and being

776
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,680
able to produce effective

777
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,390
messages, the better you're going

778
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:01,640
to be at making money with your

779
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:02,200
offer.

780
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,299
It's a one-to-one correlation.

781
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,460
Can't make it up.

782
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,009
So, those are some direct response

783
00:19:07,009 --> 00:19:08,460
principles for you to follow.

784
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,460
Enjoy the reading list.

785
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,539
If you guys have any questions at

786
00:19:10,539 --> 00:19:11,759
all, you can always message me.

787
00:19:11,799 --> 00:19:13,450
The reading list is definitely,

788
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:15,319
definitely, definitely going to be

789
00:19:15,319 --> 00:19:16,210
worth your time.

790
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:17,630
You need to be spending time on

791
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:19,109
educating yourself in this realm

792
00:19:19,109 --> 00:19:20,450
so you can get better at it.

793
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,400
Okay, let's move on.

794
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:25,119
So, now, guys, it's time for us to

795
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:25,920
write.

796
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,359
Woo-hoo, super fun.

797
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,380
So, here's your biggest obstacle.

798
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:30,460
Hint, it's you.

799
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,269
Okay, I can already see it right

800
00:19:32,269 --> 00:19:32,559
now.

801
00:19:32,779 --> 00:19:33,720
People are going to be messaging

802
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:33,940
me.

803
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,380
I'm just struggling to write the

804
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,039
VSL script.

805
00:19:36,119 --> 00:19:37,319
Oh, I hate that.

806
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:39,799
I'm going to send them to minute

807
00:19:39,799 --> 00:19:42,380
1938 on this video.

808
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:43,950
Tell them to go watch this.

809
00:19:44,599 --> 00:19:46,119
Guys, the reason you're struggling

810
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:47,680
with the ability to write is

811
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,009
because you're not researching

812
00:19:49,099 --> 00:19:50,500
the right way, okay?

813
00:19:50,539 --> 00:19:52,589
Guys, lazy writing is lazy

814
00:19:52,779 --> 00:19:53,660
research.

815
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,009
If you did the right amount of

816
00:19:55,009 --> 00:19:56,779
research with your creative brief,

817
00:19:56,779 --> 00:19:57,880
it should be very easy

818
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:58,420
for you to write.

819
00:19:58,460 --> 00:19:59,880
It should be extremely easy for

820
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,519
you to write.

821
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,009
You should have writing bursting

822
00:20:02,009 --> 00:20:03,269
out of your ears and coming out of

823
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:03,900
your eyes.

824
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,490
You should be crying with words

825
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,809
that are going to sell your

826
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,880
product, okay?

827
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,279
If you haven't completed your

828
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:10,769
creative brief, this is going to

829
00:20:10,839 --> 00:20:11,680
be really hard.

830
00:20:11,799 --> 00:20:13,180
Go do that.

831
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,799
Otherwise, you're making it 10

832
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:15,970
times harder than it needs to be,

833
00:20:16,009 --> 00:20:16,349
okay?

834
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,920
The whole point of the creative

835
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,470
brief is that you collect a shit

836
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:21,039
ton of research and information

837
00:20:21,079 --> 00:20:23,140
that makes it easy for you to then

838
00:20:23,319 --> 00:20:24,430
go and write.

839
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,970
When you don't have that and it's

840
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:27,559
all scatterbrained chaos in your

841
00:20:27,589 --> 00:20:29,329
head, it's really hard for you

842
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:29,819
to then write.

843
00:20:29,859 --> 00:20:31,269
When you have it organized, by the

844
00:20:31,269 --> 00:20:32,519
time you finish that creative

845
00:20:32,519 --> 00:20:33,579
brief, you should be able

846
00:20:33,619 --> 00:20:34,589
to dive right into writing and be

847
00:20:34,589 --> 00:20:35,579
like, oh, I already know what I

848
00:20:35,579 --> 00:20:36,089
need to do.

849
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,660
And you go do that, right?

850
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:40,079
Another thing, some days, guys,

851
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:41,589
you're going to be in a total flow

852
00:20:41,589 --> 00:20:42,500
state, right?

853
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:43,950
You're going to be writing your

854
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:44,839
best shit ever.

855
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,720
It's going to be so good.

856
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:46,849
Just sauce, just pouring out of

857
00:20:46,849 --> 00:20:47,819
your fingertips, just sauce

858
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:48,519
everywhere.

859
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:50,089
Other days, you're going to be

860
00:20:50,109 --> 00:20:51,589
about as creative as a sack of

861
00:20:51,589 --> 00:20:52,740
potatoes, right?

862
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:55,339
Regardless, you still write on

863
00:20:55,519 --> 00:20:58,180
both days, JFW, just blank, right?

864
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:59,319
Okay.

865
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:00,740
So if you're trying to get this

866
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:02,480
VSL done, just write, don't say, I

867
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,549
need everything to

868
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,019
be perfect.

869
00:21:04,059 --> 00:21:05,259
I need the cosmos to align.

870
00:21:05,299 --> 00:21:06,599
I need to write when Mercury is

871
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:07,990
not in retrograde and only when

872
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:09,240
it's a full moon and when my

873
00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:10,410
numerology calendar, whoa, whoa,

874
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:11,160
whoa, whoa, whoa.

875
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,789
No, no, just write, okay?

876
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:14,839
You have me to critique your

877
00:21:14,839 --> 00:21:15,240
stuff.

878
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:16,809
And on top of that, also, guys, is

879
00:21:16,819 --> 00:21:18,210
you should be trying to get this

880
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:19,980
done in a short timeline.

881
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:21,819
Like I said, one to two days max,

882
00:21:21,819 --> 00:21:23,319
and so you may go, I don't feel

883
00:21:23,319 --> 00:21:24,230
really like just

884
00:21:24,279 --> 00:21:26,339
write, just get done, okay?

885
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:27,480
You have me to support you.

886
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:29,000
And then on top of that, the whole

887
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,640
point is to just get the one done.

888
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,660
It will not be perfect.

889
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:32,859
If this is your first VSL, it

890
00:21:32,859 --> 00:21:33,750
won't be perfect.

891
00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:34,680
Just accept that.

892
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,059
It's okay.

893
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:37,160
Isn't that great?

894
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:37,619
Awesome.

895
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:39,140
So let's keep talking about

896
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:39,720
writing.

897
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,119
Here's some general writing

898
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:42,359
guidelines for you guys.

899
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,460
First and foremost, the

900
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,269
introduction for your VSL is by

901
00:21:47,269 --> 00:21:49,480
far the most important part of the

902
00:21:49,539 --> 00:21:50,859
script you're going to write.

903
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:52,230
Without a doubt, it's the most

904
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:53,160
important part.

905
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,079
If you don't nail the intro, guess

906
00:21:55,079 --> 00:21:55,599
what?

907
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,079
You'll lose them early on, okay?

908
00:21:57,119 --> 00:21:58,630
The introduction is the most

909
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:00,420
important part of the VSL, story

910
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:00,880
time.

911
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,410
So when I was working on a VSL for

912
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:06,329
an Amazon FBA offer, this guy was

913
00:22:06,329 --> 00:22:09,079
converting at about 3%

914
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:11,420
and had about a $300 cost per book

915
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:13,200
call, writing a lot of ads.

916
00:22:13,319 --> 00:22:14,000
So not something you guys are

917
00:22:14,049 --> 00:22:14,740
going to be doing really.

918
00:22:14,769 --> 00:22:15,490
A lot of you guys are going to be

919
00:22:15,509 --> 00:22:17,299
doing cold emails, but $300 for a

920
00:22:17,299 --> 00:22:18,960
cost per book call with paid ads.

921
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,869
And so what I did is I sure I

922
00:22:20,869 --> 00:22:22,779
changed some other stuff in the

923
00:22:22,779 --> 00:22:24,500
VSL, but primarily I focused

924
00:22:24,539 --> 00:22:25,640
on the introduction and I

925
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,599
completely changed the

926
00:22:26,779 --> 00:22:27,619
introduction.

927
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:28,819
Just like gave it a whole

928
00:22:28,819 --> 00:22:29,539
facelift.

929
00:22:29,579 --> 00:22:31,109
We were able to take that

930
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:33,630
conversion rate from 3% to 6% and

931
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:35,950
his cost per book call was cut

932
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:36,559
in half as well.

933
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,460
So it went from $300 cost per book

934
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:40,440
call to $150 cost per book call.

935
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,400
He was operating at $300,000 a

936
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:42,859
month.

937
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,349
And because of those expenses and

938
00:22:44,349 --> 00:22:45,750
for it to be able to be lowered,

939
00:22:45,819 --> 00:22:48,740
he now is operating at $700,000 a

940
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:48,910
month.

941
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:50,400
And this was about three years

942
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:50,799
ago.

943
00:22:50,839 --> 00:22:51,900
I wrote this VSL for him.

944
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:53,420
It is still the industry leader.

945
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:54,880
I don't know anyone who's had this

946
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,599
consistent and long-term of a VSL.

947
00:22:56,819 --> 00:22:57,859
Since three years ago, once he

948
00:22:57,859 --> 00:22:59,119
started, he very quickly scaled up

949
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:01,079
to $700,000, has not stopped at

950
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:02,980
$700,000, has hit it every single

951
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:03,519
month.

952
00:23:03,559 --> 00:23:04,609
He says that once he hits a mil,

953
00:23:04,609 --> 00:23:05,619
he tried like a mil once and he

954
00:23:05,619 --> 00:23:07,259
hit like $850,000 and was just

955
00:23:07,259 --> 00:23:08,119
like, I hate it.

956
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,200
I don't like that amount.

957
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,660
And so he's like, $700,000 is my

958
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:11,299
sweet spot where I feel

959
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,319
comfortable and I can manage my

960
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:13,140
other businesses.

961
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:15,390
So all it took was just fixing the

962
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:15,859
intro.

963
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:17,099
That shows you the power of the

964
00:23:17,099 --> 00:23:17,839
introduction.

965
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:18,990
I really didn't change much else

966
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:20,450
in the VSL, just the introduction.

967
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:23,099
So every video has a LAC, LAC,

968
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:26,230
lead, which is the introduction,

969
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:29,240
argument, which is the body, and

970
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,710
then close, which is the call to

971
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:31,240
action.

972
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:33,579
Lead, argument, close.

973
00:23:33,619 --> 00:23:35,400
Every single VSL is like that.

974
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,009
So the easiest way for you to

975
00:23:37,009 --> 00:23:38,740
write a highly effective VSL

976
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:40,910
script is to follow a framework.

977
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,339
I'm going to give you a framework

978
00:23:42,339 --> 00:23:42,980
right now.

979
00:23:43,099 --> 00:23:43,880
I said cover two.

980
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,019
I should say one.

981
00:23:45,059 --> 00:23:46,490
So disregard that.

982
00:23:46,519 --> 00:23:47,059
I'm going to give you one.

983
00:23:47,089 --> 00:23:47,980
I thought about giving you two and

984
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:48,880
then I realized, you know what,

985
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:49,680
let's make it super simple and

986
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:50,220
give you one.

987
00:23:50,259 --> 00:23:50,720
Okay.

988
00:23:50,759 --> 00:23:51,839
So we're only going to give you

989
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:52,160
one.

990
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,029
And this framework is essentially

991
00:23:54,029 --> 00:23:55,730
an outline for you to follow.

992
00:23:55,779 --> 00:23:56,839
It's like a map of where you

993
00:23:56,839 --> 00:23:58,220
should go with your writing.

994
00:23:58,259 --> 00:23:58,680
Okay.

995
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,660
If you get the intro down, it's a

996
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:02,599
lot easier to move on to the next

997
00:24:02,599 --> 00:24:04,349
step and the next step and the

998
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,769
next step and so on.

999
00:24:05,859 --> 00:24:06,180
Right.

1000
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,250
That's why we should follow a

1001
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:07,819
framework.

1002
00:24:07,859 --> 00:24:09,039
It makes it really easy for us to

1003
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:10,299
get the intro down, for us to get

1004
00:24:10,299 --> 00:24:11,509
the body down, and for us to get

1005
00:24:11,509 --> 00:24:12,680
the call to action down.

1006
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,000
Solid.

1007
00:24:14,039 --> 00:24:14,619
Right.

1008
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,269
So intro, body, call to action.

1009
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:16,640
Okay.

1010
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,019
Close.

1011
00:24:18,079 --> 00:24:20,359
So we should aim to be around five

1012
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:22,750
to ten minutes for a B2B VSL.

1013
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:23,680
Okay.

1014
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,400
Five to ten minutes.

1015
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,490
And when you have a really solid

1016
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,619
creative brief and you pair that

1017
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,900
with a little bit of some chat GPT

1018
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:34,119
action and you have a really good

1019
00:24:34,119 --> 00:24:36,240
framework, you're making things

1020
00:24:36,259 --> 00:24:37,819
ten times easier for you to do it

1021
00:24:37,819 --> 00:24:39,490
on your own, for you to write your

1022
00:24:39,559 --> 00:24:40,420
own script.

1023
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:40,980
Okay.

1024
00:24:41,019 --> 00:24:41,740
You don't need to go hire a

1025
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:42,299
copywriter.

1026
00:24:42,339 --> 00:24:42,900
You don't need to go.

1027
00:24:43,019 --> 00:24:44,059
Like, it's super simple, guys.

1028
00:24:44,089 --> 00:24:44,900
I'm going to give you everything

1029
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:45,589
you need to do to do it on your

1030
00:24:45,589 --> 00:24:45,859
own.

1031
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:46,779
And we're going to use a little

1032
00:24:46,779 --> 00:24:47,799
bit of some AI as well, and you're

1033
00:24:47,799 --> 00:24:48,690
going to see how I think about

1034
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:49,390
these things.

1035
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,140
Okay.

1036
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:51,740
So that is everything for the

1037
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,299
general writing guidelines.

1038
00:24:54,579 --> 00:24:55,869
Here is your bread and butter

1039
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:56,579
framework.

1040
00:24:56,619 --> 00:24:56,910
Okay.

1041
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,480
So here's the framework, guys.

1042
00:24:58,519 --> 00:25:00,220
First and foremost, you are going

1043
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:01,539
to state your offer and the

1044
00:25:01,539 --> 00:25:02,279
guarantee.

1045
00:25:02,339 --> 00:25:03,980
Pretty straightforward.

1046
00:25:04,019 --> 00:25:05,259
You state where your offer is and

1047
00:25:05,259 --> 00:25:06,440
you make the guarantee and you

1048
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,559
give them a brief overview of

1049
00:25:07,569 --> 00:25:08,650
what's to come in this short

1050
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:09,119
video.

1051
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,819
A brief overview of what's to come

1052
00:25:10,819 --> 00:25:12,400
in this short video is your open

1053
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:12,920
loops.

1054
00:25:13,019 --> 00:25:15,019
Open the loops for them.

1055
00:25:15,059 --> 00:25:16,079
And you state the offer and make

1056
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:16,759
the guarantee.

1057
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:17,890
If you don't have an offer, go to

1058
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:18,640
Daniel's call.

1059
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,789
If you don't have a guarantee, go

1060
00:25:19,789 --> 00:25:20,579
to Daniel's call.

1061
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:22,220
You need an offer and a guarantee.

1062
00:25:22,259 --> 00:25:23,900
Oh, I don't have a guarantee.

1063
00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:24,309
Okay.

1064
00:25:24,359 --> 00:25:25,700
Do you have a disgusting amount of

1065
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:26,410
case studies?

1066
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:27,039
No.

1067
00:25:27,099 --> 00:25:28,240
Go to Daniel's call.

1068
00:25:28,279 --> 00:25:28,799
You need a guarantee.

1069
00:25:28,839 --> 00:25:30,259
Do you have a disgusting amount of

1070
00:25:30,259 --> 00:25:30,900
case studies?

1071
00:25:31,079 --> 00:25:31,420
Yes.

1072
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:31,769
Okay.

1073
00:25:31,819 --> 00:25:32,660
You don't need a guarantee.

1074
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:33,259
You don't need to state a

1075
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:33,680
guarantee.

1076
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,400
Okay.

1077
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,660
If you just have like undeniable

1078
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:36,990
levels of social proof, you don't

1079
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:37,880
need a guarantee.

1080
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,559
But if you do not have undeniable

1081
00:25:39,559 --> 00:25:40,950
levels of proof, you need a

1082
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:41,839
guarantee.

1083
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:42,619
Okay.

1084
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:44,170
And if you do have undeniable

1085
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:45,690
levels of proof and you have a

1086
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,400
guarantee, that's good.

1087
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,119
Like, that's awesome.

1088
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,400
So then we're going to do

1089
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,339
something called the IED intro.

1090
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:52,859
Okay.

1091
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:54,460
This is where we ask three types

1092
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:56,420
of questions to open up the video.

1093
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,059
Okay.

1094
00:25:57,119 --> 00:25:58,759
It's an identifier question, an

1095
00:25:58,759 --> 00:26:00,369
empathy-based question, and a

1096
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:01,920
direct benefit statement.

1097
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,759
Okay.

1098
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:05,019
So an example of this, are you a

1099
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:07,089
coach who sells a high ticket

1100
00:26:07,369 --> 00:26:10,240
offer ranging from $5,000 to

1101
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,400
$25,000?

1102
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,009
Identifier question.

1103
00:26:13,059 --> 00:26:14,140
Empathy-based question.

1104
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,509
Do you ever feel like your cost

1105
00:26:16,509 --> 00:26:18,829
per book call is continuously

1106
00:26:18,829 --> 00:26:21,039
going up on ads and it's very

1107
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:22,960
frustrating because you cannot

1108
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,759
effectively scale with a high cost

1109
00:26:24,829 --> 00:26:25,720
per book call?

1110
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:27,289
Kind of a wordy question, but I'm

1111
00:26:27,289 --> 00:26:29,009
just shooting off the cuff here.

1112
00:26:29,059 --> 00:26:30,279
Empathy-based, right?

1113
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:31,420
I understand your situation.

1114
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:32,349
They're like, yes, that's exactly

1115
00:26:32,349 --> 00:26:32,740
what I have.

1116
00:26:32,779 --> 00:26:33,519
Direct benefit.

1117
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,609
What if I could show you how to

1118
00:26:35,609 --> 00:26:37,289
cut your cost per book call in

1119
00:26:37,289 --> 00:26:39,069
half without having to change

1120
00:26:39,069 --> 00:26:40,789
anything with your ads?

1121
00:26:40,839 --> 00:26:44,089
That's a direct benefit statement.

1122
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:45,390
They're like, heck yeah, sign me

1123
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:45,670
up.

1124
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,299
I'd like that.

1125
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:46,799
Okay.

1126
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:48,339
So that's exactly what we're doing

1127
00:26:48,339 --> 00:26:48,630
there.

1128
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,680
That's the IED intro.

1129
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,019
If you know also an IED is like an

1130
00:26:51,019 --> 00:26:52,740
explosive device in the military.

1131
00:26:52,779 --> 00:26:54,059
So that's why we call it that.

1132
00:26:54,099 --> 00:26:56,019
Then what we go into is why is

1133
00:26:56,019 --> 00:26:58,680
this problem happening, right?

1134
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,210
We go into the problem and we talk

1135
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:01,559
about the real reason why the

1136
00:27:01,569 --> 00:27:03,130
problem is happening for them.

1137
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:04,319
All right.

1138
00:27:04,359 --> 00:27:05,079
That's what we explain to them.

1139
00:27:05,119 --> 00:27:06,079
Hey, here's the real reason why

1140
00:27:06,079 --> 00:27:07,119
your problem is happening.

1141
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:07,559
Okay.

1142
00:27:07,599 --> 00:27:08,299
You don't know this.

1143
00:27:08,339 --> 00:27:09,319
You think it's this.

1144
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:10,059
It's actually this.

1145
00:27:10,099 --> 00:27:11,259
Here's the real problem.

1146
00:27:11,299 --> 00:27:12,380
I'm going to explain your problem

1147
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,359
to you better than you can explain

1148
00:27:13,539 --> 00:27:14,059
it yourself.

1149
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:15,130
You get that from really good

1150
00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:15,630
research.

1151
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:16,799
Let's keep going.

1152
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:19,019
What's the solution?

1153
00:27:19,059 --> 00:27:20,130
I'm going to not give you

1154
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:21,420
everything right away.

1155
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:22,240
What is the solution?

1156
00:27:22,279 --> 00:27:23,700
How do you reverse the problem?

1157
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:25,000
How are you specifically reversing

1158
00:27:25,009 --> 00:27:25,799
the problem for them?

1159
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,099
This is where we bring in our

1160
00:27:27,099 --> 00:27:28,539
product or our service and we show

1161
00:27:28,539 --> 00:27:30,000
them how to completely remove the

1162
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:30,660
problem.

1163
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:31,279
Okay.

1164
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:32,319
Next section.

1165
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:34,000
How is this solution different?

1166
00:27:34,039 --> 00:27:35,539
This is where we reveal our unique

1167
00:27:35,539 --> 00:27:36,099
mechanism.

1168
00:27:36,299 --> 00:27:37,740
It shows how we're different.

1169
00:27:37,779 --> 00:27:39,240
This is what we do differently,

1170
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:39,720
right?

1171
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:41,099
And we show how we're different

1172
00:27:41,099 --> 00:27:42,740
than 99% of the things the viewer

1173
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:43,380
has seen.

1174
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:44,619
And this is how we position

1175
00:27:44,619 --> 00:27:46,200
ourselves as a 1% solution.

1176
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,630
Meaning you haven't seen this

1177
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:48,069
before.

1178
00:27:48,119 --> 00:27:50,170
Undeniable proof.

1179
00:27:50,259 --> 00:27:52,079
You want to make it extremely

1180
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:54,019
clear that you have results or

1181
00:27:54,019 --> 00:27:55,769
proof that people love your

1182
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,339
product or service.

1183
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:58,980
Okay.

1184
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:00,000
Undeniable proof.

1185
00:28:00,039 --> 00:28:01,410
If you don't have that, sorry

1186
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:02,990
guys, you're going to miss out on

1187
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:04,500
having as powerful of a VSL as you

1188
00:28:04,609 --> 00:28:05,220
can have.

1189
00:28:05,259 --> 00:28:05,920
But that's okay.

1190
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:06,940
You should come back later when

1191
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:08,019
you do have undeniable proof.

1192
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:09,599
It's not a make or break thing.

1193
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,500
It's just going to make it a lot

1194
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:11,410
easier for you to be able to get

1195
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:12,230
book calls from this.

1196
00:28:12,279 --> 00:28:13,349
You're going to have to try a lot

1197
00:28:13,349 --> 00:28:14,450
harder with follow-up if you do

1198
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:15,680
not have undeniable proof.

1199
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:16,230
Okay.

1200
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:18,319
And then last but not least, one

1201
00:28:18,319 --> 00:28:20,349
more direct offer plus ask.

1202
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:21,309
This is where we make our final

1203
00:28:21,309 --> 00:28:22,319
direct offer to the viewer.

1204
00:28:22,359 --> 00:28:23,750
Tell them to take a specific

1205
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:24,930
action, which is going to be

1206
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:26,119
filling out a questionnaire,

1207
00:28:26,119 --> 00:28:27,619
booking a call, so on and so

1208
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,200
forth.

1209
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,079
Okay.

1210
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,940
So now let's go write a VSL script

1211
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:33,900
together following this framework

1212
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,329
in the demo section of this

1213
00:28:35,329 --> 00:28:35,980
module.

1214
00:28:36,059 --> 00:28:37,119
So that's everything, guys.

1215
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,099
Hope you found this useful.

1216
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:38,700
All the best.

1217
00:28:38,819 --> 00:28:39,559
Bye now.
