1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:02,100
Hey guys, what's going on?

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:03,180
Hope you're doing well.

3
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:06,929
Update for you on your VSL review

4
00:00:06,929 --> 00:00:07,400
process

5
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:08,830
inside of Klein Ascension.

6
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:10,250
So one of the things that we've

7
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:11,859
realized is the most difficult

8
00:00:11,859 --> 00:00:12,039
thing

9
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:13,750
for me is to give feedback to

10
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:15,509
people when they just send me the

11
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:16,039
VSL.

12
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:17,300
When you send it to me

13
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:18,730
over Slack and I have to go back

14
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:20,320
and forth with you over it, it can

15
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,839
end up taking anywhere from

16
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:24,219
like 15 to 20 minutes in terms of

17
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:25,739
the total time elapsed.

18
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:27,719
But really it's like days because

19
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:27,980
I got

20
00:00:27,989 --> 00:00:28,769
to get back to you.

21
00:00:28,809 --> 00:00:29,789
You got to get back to me.

22
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:30,760
I got to get back to you.

23
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,000
You got to get back to me.

24
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:32,600
I'm busy.

25
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:33,369
You're busy.

26
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:34,950
You know what's a lot easier?

27
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:36,619
Just showing up to the call.

28
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:38,289
So we've made it a

29
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:40,289
requirement now that if you want

30
00:00:40,289 --> 00:00:42,210
feedback on a VSL, whether it be

31
00:00:42,259 --> 00:00:44,479
your current one, one that you're

32
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:46,060
writing right now, whether it be

33
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:47,509
an improvement you made to it,

34
00:00:47,509 --> 00:00:49,119
whatever it is, you need to show

35
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:49,299
up to

36
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:51,049
the calls because we found that

37
00:00:51,049 --> 00:00:52,850
that is the easiest way for you to

38
00:00:52,979 --> 00:00:54,460
be able to get feedback on your

39
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,039
VSL.

40
00:00:55,049 --> 00:00:55,600
Okay.

41
00:00:55,609 --> 00:00:57,960
So you type in a submission form.

42
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:58,259
Okay.

43
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,090
You then show up to the call and

44
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:00,880
then I give you

45
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:02,189
feedback on your VSL.

46
00:01:02,189 --> 00:01:03,969
We are not doing it anymore where

47
00:01:03,969 --> 00:01:05,750
there's messages back and forth

48
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:06,379
on, can you

49
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:07,790
check out this VSL or, you know,

50
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:09,140
don't show up to the call and just

51
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:10,459
submit it and then watch the

52
00:01:10,469 --> 00:01:11,579
recording on it.

53
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:13,260
It is very difficult for me to

54
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:14,870
give any level of effective

55
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:16,319
feedback if I can't have

56
00:01:16,329 --> 00:01:17,909
a two-way dialogue with you.

57
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:19,379
And it ends up with me taking a

58
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:20,209
lot more time.

59
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:21,260
And I am very limited

60
00:01:21,269 --> 00:01:23,400
because there's a 500 of you and

61
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,310
one of me.

62
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:24,670
Okay.

63
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:26,859
So if you need feedback, you show

64
00:01:26,859 --> 00:01:27,099
up to

65
00:01:27,109 --> 00:01:27,879
the call.

66
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:29,989
Now, some of you may be saying,

67
00:01:30,019 --> 00:01:32,260
oh, but Nick, it's like 2 AM where

68
00:01:32,409 --> 00:01:33,200
I'm at because

69
00:01:33,209 --> 00:01:34,980
the time zone difference totally

70
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:35,810
understand.

71
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:37,310
You're going to show up to the

72
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:38,099
call and just

73
00:01:38,109 --> 00:01:39,349
let us know ahead of time.

74
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:40,909
Hey man, I'm in Serbia or wherever

75
00:01:40,909 --> 00:01:41,879
the fuck you're at.

76
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:42,219
I'm in

77
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:42,709
Serbia.

78
00:01:42,709 --> 00:01:43,430
It's 2 AM here.

79
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:44,409
Do you mind if I go first and

80
00:01:44,409 --> 00:01:45,680
we'll move you to the front so you

81
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:46,719
can get yours done first.

82
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:47,689
And then we'll move on to the

83
00:01:47,689 --> 00:01:48,920
other people who are maybe on a

84
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:48,980
more

85
00:01:49,129 --> 00:01:50,579
standard time zone with us.

86
00:01:50,689 --> 00:01:52,359
Now, some people, oh, but it's 2

87
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:52,859
AM.

88
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:54,280
Grow up.

89
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,680
Time to grow up a

90
00:01:55,689 --> 00:01:56,489
little bit.

91
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:58,219
You can stay up a couple times to

92
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:59,799
be able to get this reviewed.

93
00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:00,840
We can't have

94
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,400
everyone, you know, we can't get

95
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:03,989
to everyone with every single time

96
00:02:03,989 --> 00:02:04,209
zone.

97
00:02:04,689 --> 00:02:05,459
Otherwise we'd be having

98
00:02:05,469 --> 00:02:06,459
80 calls a week.

99
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:07,810
We already have a lot of calls,

100
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:09,110
but for me personally, I'm on

101
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:10,520
Pacific, so I can't

102
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,099
compensate for everyone out there

103
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:13,500
and all the other time zones.

104
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,939
So all you need to do if you want

105
00:02:14,939 --> 00:02:15,159
to get

106
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:16,620
feedback is submitted through the

107
00:02:16,729 --> 00:02:18,099
VSL form, show up to the calls,

108
00:02:18,099 --> 00:02:19,560
which are normally on Wednesday.

109
00:02:19,569 --> 00:02:20,430
We've been switching them around a

110
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:21,150
little bit because I've been

111
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:21,750
traveling a lot lately,

112
00:02:21,849 --> 00:02:23,500
but normally on Wednesdays and you

113
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,780
can get feedback then.

114
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:25,740
So that's everything.

115
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,849
I'll see you on the next call.

116
00:02:28,139 --> 00:02:28,680
Bye now.
