1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:01,370
All right, let's talk about video

2
00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:02,089
sales letter.

3
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:04,519
So video sales letter, it's just a

4
00:00:04,519 --> 00:00:05,740
video on your page.

5
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:06,950
It's pretty much a requirement.

6
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:09,900
You gotta imagine, like if you're

7
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:11,060
talking to cold traffic,

8
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:12,650
like no one's buying from a

9
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:13,419
faceless,

10
00:00:13,419 --> 00:00:14,980
like just random company.

11
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:16,190
Like you have to show your face

12
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:17,010
here, right?

13
00:00:17,019 --> 00:00:18,059
Because what you have to

14
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:19,000
understand is that

15
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,089
you are default an internet

16
00:00:21,089 --> 00:00:21,539
scammer

17
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,359
until proven otherwise.

18
00:00:23,379 --> 00:00:25,250
And the first step to building any

19
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:25,839
form of trust

20
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:27,809
with anybody is obviously showing

21
00:00:27,809 --> 00:00:28,899
your face to them.

22
00:00:28,899 --> 00:00:30,339
Like you can't be doing this thing

23
00:00:30,339 --> 00:00:31,500
where it's like, I'm never gonna

24
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,100
show my face.

25
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,149
It's just a completely

26
00:00:33,159 --> 00:00:34,500
unreasonable expectation

27
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,100
to believe that anything is gonna

28
00:00:36,189 --> 00:00:36,549
work out

29
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,140
for you hiding your face.

30
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:39,890
Like this whole idea of like a

31
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:41,020
faceless brand,

32
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:42,600
like it's not happening, bro.

33
00:00:42,679 --> 00:00:43,659
It just isn't.

34
00:00:43,659 --> 00:00:45,259
So let's go over this real quick.

35
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,859
So I'm gonna make this wildly

36
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,189
simple for you to do.

37
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,939
So what you're gonna do for your

38
00:00:49,939 --> 00:00:50,539
first VSL

39
00:00:50,539 --> 00:00:52,899
is what's called a GammaDoc VSL.

40
00:00:52,899 --> 00:00:55,350
This is what I do for like 90% of

41
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:56,759
the VSLs I make.

42
00:00:56,759 --> 00:00:59,740
So this is generally a B2B tactic.

43
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:02,079
Sometimes it can work for a B2C,

44
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:03,789
but the software I'm using right

45
00:01:03,789 --> 00:01:04,019
now

46
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:05,090
in this presentation is called

47
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:05,439
Gamma.

48
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:06,599
So like you probably see like most

49
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:07,019
of the videos

50
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,150
I make inside this course are on

51
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:08,519
Gamma.

52
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:10,099
It's just Gamma.app, right?

53
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,140
It's just a Google Doc,

54
00:01:12,709 --> 00:01:14,060
basically Google Doc software,

55
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:14,859
but you can like,

56
00:01:14,859 --> 00:01:16,390
there's all sorts of like

57
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:17,319
formatting and whatnot.

58
00:01:17,379 --> 00:01:18,799
There's some AI tools inside of

59
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:19,250
Gamma.

60
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:20,659
So it's really good.

61
00:01:20,739 --> 00:01:21,790
It's free to start.

62
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:25,420
There's a free version of it,

63
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:26,250
but there's also a paid version of

64
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:26,489
it.

65
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,239
I have the paid version.

66
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:29,689
So then all you're gonna be doing

67
00:01:29,879 --> 00:01:31,480
is putting all of the relevant

68
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:32,299
information

69
00:01:32,299 --> 00:01:33,819
about your offer onto a Gamma Doc

70
00:01:33,819 --> 00:01:35,219
and then screen record yourself

71
00:01:35,219 --> 00:01:37,609
going over the document with Loom

72
00:01:37,609 --> 00:01:38,519
or OBS.

73
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:39,340
So OBS is,

74
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:40,920
like I'm filming with OBS right

75
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:41,310
now.

76
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,370
It allows you to like customize

77
00:01:42,379 --> 00:01:43,620
like how it looks right now.

78
00:01:43,659 --> 00:01:44,640
Like I can,

79
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,689
there's like different scenes and

80
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:46,060
whatnot,

81
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,209
but Loom is just a video screen

82
00:01:48,209 --> 00:01:49,670
sharing platform.

83
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:50,620
It's like super cheap.

84
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:51,670
I think it's like $10 a month

85
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,379
or something like that.

86
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:53,560
You'll probably use it

87
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,540
a substantial amount in your life

88
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:54,879
anyway.

89
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:57,329
So then all you do

90
00:01:57,459 --> 00:01:59,489
is embed this video directly

91
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,920
onto your landing page.

92
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,879
Like literally that's it.

93
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:04,810
The reason why this makes sense to

94
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:05,159
do

95
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:06,680
like a Gamma Doc VSL

96
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,810
is that you don't have to memorize

97
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:08,280
the script.

98
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,659
All you do is effectively

99
00:02:10,659 --> 00:02:12,020
just read off the document

100
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:14,469
and convey the idea and arguments

101
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,539
and whatever the fuck is said

102
00:02:15,539 --> 00:02:16,740
on the document

103
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:17,699
just like directly.

104
00:02:17,699 --> 00:02:18,909
You get what I'm saying?

105
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:20,259
Like you would need

106
00:02:20,259 --> 00:02:21,460
like crazy camera equipment

107
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:21,979
or a mic.

108
00:02:21,979 --> 00:02:24,009
Like I'm using a mic right now,

109
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:24,800
but I don't even have to have the

110
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,020
mic.

111
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,280
I'm using the camera on my Mac

112
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,310
right now, the webcam, right?

113
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:29,719
It's super easy to do this.

114
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:32,199
So if you can do it at one take

115
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,060
without messing up,

116
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:33,849
you won't even have to do any

117
00:02:33,849 --> 00:02:34,219
editing.

118
00:02:34,219 --> 00:02:36,090
And even if you did mess up a

119
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:36,539
little bit,

120
00:02:36,539 --> 00:02:37,539
if you have a Loom subscription

121
00:02:37,539 --> 00:02:39,009
with one of the AI features

122
00:02:39,009 --> 00:02:39,500
enabled,

123
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,550
it can clean up your video

124
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,919
by removing like blank spaces

125
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:43,020
and ums and ahs and shit.

126
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:45,250
So why do I structure my VSLs like

127
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:45,419
this?

128
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:46,680
Because it means

129
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:48,300
that they can also serve

130
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,460
as the sales deck

131
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,330
you use on the calls with clients.

132
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,000
So what do you got to understand?

133
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,539
Like what our base instruction

134
00:02:54,539 --> 00:02:54,819
here

135
00:02:54,819 --> 00:02:55,759
for you to do is

136
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:56,939
in the beginning at least

137
00:02:56,939 --> 00:02:59,389
is that your VSL,

138
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:01,699
this gamma doc you're making

139
00:03:01,699 --> 00:03:02,699
as your VSL

140
00:03:02,699 --> 00:03:04,900
is also your sales deck.

141
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,639
You get what I'm saying?

142
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:09,069
Like, so Dan Crowley

143
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,080
will be teaching a significant

144
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:10,639
amount of sales

145
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:11,580
inside of the sales section

146
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:12,300
of this course.

147
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:13,900
Him and I both agreed that

148
00:03:13,909 --> 00:03:15,419
generally it is very difficult

149
00:03:15,419 --> 00:03:16,629
for a beginner to sell

150
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:17,659
without a sales script

151
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,500
or doc to go over.

152
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:20,599
Like you'll kind of like

153
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:21,599
get onto a call

154
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:22,810
and it's like all sorts of just

155
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:23,039
like,

156
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:25,550
you might fucking spiral

157
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,240
and like not know what to say

158
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:27,479
and whatnot.

159
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:28,879
This is like a structured way

160
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:29,900
to go about it

161
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,379
and to convey a sales argument.

162
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,430
So this is why I've chosen

163
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:34,509
to instruct you as a beginner

164
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,520
to make a VSL in this fashion

165
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,300
so that it can also double

166
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,020
as your sales deck.

167
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:40,039
And what I mean by that

168
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:41,360
is that you will quite literally

169
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,659
screen share the VSL

170
00:03:43,659 --> 00:03:45,060
with clients on sales calls.

171
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,750
So I was actually talking

172
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:47,569
to someone the other day

173
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:48,400
and they were talking about

174
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:50,990
how what they were saying

175
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,000
is they were using ads, right?

176
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,699
Now typically what you'd find

177
00:03:55,699 --> 00:03:57,199
like with cold email for instance

178
00:03:57,199 --> 00:03:59,580
is like it seems that people

179
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,340
you book calls with on cold email

180
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:05,300
and ads tend to show up

181
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,759
more aware of your offer.

182
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:09,210
Like they tend to actually watch

183
00:04:09,379 --> 00:04:10,860
the video on your page

184
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,659
and stalk your social profiles

185
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:13,699
and like they'll go to your

186
00:04:13,699 --> 00:04:14,159
landing page

187
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:15,099
and actually watch it.

188
00:04:15,099 --> 00:04:16,699
Like a substantial amount of

189
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:17,240
people

190
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,040
from cold email

191
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,220
and cold outreach of any kind

192
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:21,250
actually conduct research on you

193
00:04:21,259 --> 00:04:22,540
before they respond.

194
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,199
Like the vast majority of them do

195
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:25,589
this.

196
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,050
So what that means is that

197
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,459
they tend to show up

198
00:04:30,029 --> 00:04:30,509
relatively aware.

199
00:04:31,089 --> 00:04:33,029
Now, if you're using ads

200
00:04:33,829 --> 00:04:36,899
in exchange for being able

201
00:04:36,899 --> 00:04:39,350
to fucking hyperscale ads

202
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:40,519
with like barely doing any

203
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:41,800
just putting budget up.

204
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,740
What happens is people tend

205
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:44,769
to show up

206
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:47,290
not being more aware

207
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,920
of what's going on.

208
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,240
Like they tend to have watched

209
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,689
your VSL less on your page

210
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:54,079
and like conducted

211
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:55,600
any kind of research on you

212
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,740
or stalking of you

213
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:58,920
less than they otherwise

214
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,680
do normally

215
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:02,959
having come from cold email

216
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:03,579
or cold outreach.

217
00:05:03,579 --> 00:05:07,620
So what I was talking about

218
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:08,439
with this dude is

219
00:05:08,459 --> 00:05:10,040
he was saying this to me

220
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:10,639
and I was like,

221
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:11,420
yes, well,

222
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:13,620
that's the purpose of like

223
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,199
closers for instance.

224
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,560
So like he has a sales team

225
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:16,939
and I was like,

226
00:05:16,939 --> 00:05:17,759
well, if the people

227
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,180
were showing up unaware,

228
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,470
what would be the purpose

229
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,420
of your sales team?

230
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,939
Like your sales team

231
00:05:22,939 --> 00:05:25,339
is there to reconvey

232
00:05:25,339 --> 00:05:26,939
the sales argument

233
00:05:27,019 --> 00:05:27,980
and whole message

234
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:28,810
you're trying to convey

235
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,730
in the VSL.

236
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,720
So you gotta understand

237
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,089
like this is why

238
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:35,899
Dan and I are making it

239
00:05:35,899 --> 00:05:37,620
so that you want to start

240
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:38,410
with the VSL

241
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:39,220
is your sales deck

242
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:40,819
because what you say

243
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:41,980
on the sales call,

244
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,699
like the pitch,

245
00:05:43,699 --> 00:05:45,180
the argument

246
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,759
that you're putting forth

247
00:05:47,329 --> 00:05:49,209
just is the argument

248
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,199
that's on the VSL.

249
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,319
Now I want to exemplify

250
00:05:53,889 --> 00:05:55,600
this premise to you

251
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,540
a little bit better.

252
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:59,540
So what I'm going to give you

253
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:00,899
like the outline of the VSL

254
00:06:00,899 --> 00:06:01,720
that you're going to be given

255
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,740
inside this section

256
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:04,480
is using like base element

257
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,060
components,

258
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:05,420
right?

259
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:06,600
However,

260
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,470
at the most advanced end of this,

261
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:12,500
the best way,

262
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,079
the single best way

263
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:15,319
to construct a VSL

264
00:06:15,949 --> 00:06:18,860
would be to go take like 50

265
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:20,439
or you could even do it with 10.

266
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:21,180
You could do it with 5,

267
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:24,300
like 5, 10, 20, 50,

268
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:26,480
100 recordings of sales calls.

269
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,629
Upload them to an AI

270
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,509
that can handle that much data

271
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:31,480
such as Manus

272
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,740
and then tell it,

273
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,939
hey, analyze every single

274
00:06:35,939 --> 00:06:36,560
question,

275
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:38,430
objection, and concern

276
00:06:38,459 --> 00:06:40,000
that every prospect

277
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,120
has conveyed on here

278
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,240
and then list them out

279
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,519
in descending order.

280
00:06:44,259 --> 00:06:45,470
and then you would have

281
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,060
in descending order

282
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:47,800
of the frequency

283
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,740
with which they're asked.

284
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,339
And what you would find

285
00:06:50,379 --> 00:06:51,199
is it would list out

286
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:52,589
maybe like 10, 20 questions

287
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,319
in descending order

288
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:53,879
of the frequency

289
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:54,660
with which they asked

290
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:55,839
and this would,

291
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:57,620
by mathematical nature,

292
00:06:58,189 --> 00:06:58,639
uncover

293
00:06:59,209 --> 00:07:01,180
what people are concerned with

294
00:07:01,459 --> 00:07:02,529
most probably,

295
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:03,060
right?

296
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:04,779
using like big data

297
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,779
from like actual fucking prospects

298
00:07:06,779 --> 00:07:09,230
that you had like spoken to.

299
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:12,879
So, but in the absence of that,

300
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:14,480
because if you're just starting

301
00:07:14,569 --> 00:07:14,839
out,

302
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:16,300
you don't have a fuck ton

303
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,149
of sales call recordings.

304
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,800
That's why I'm just giving you

305
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,519
base elements.

306
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:20,959
But I'm just,

307
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:22,500
I'm just saying this

308
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,870
to exemplify the parody

309
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:24,860
of that.

310
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:26,699
What you say,

311
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:27,139
you got to imagine

312
00:07:27,139 --> 00:07:29,000
what a video sales letter is,

313
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,449
is the sales conversation.

314
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,600
They're just not on the phone.

315
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,180
Like they just can't talk back.

316
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,000
Get what I'm saying?

317
00:07:36,509 --> 00:07:38,509
And the sales call

318
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,019
just is the VSL,

319
00:07:40,019 --> 00:07:41,259
but they can talk back.

320
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:42,120
You get what I'm saying?

321
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,329
Like the parody between the two,

322
00:07:43,339 --> 00:07:44,279
it's the same thing.

323
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:45,100
It's the same exact thing.

324
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,279
You're trying to say

325
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:48,699
and convey the same thing to them

326
00:07:48,699 --> 00:07:50,019
on both the VSL

327
00:07:50,019 --> 00:07:51,379
and the sales call.

328
00:07:51,379 --> 00:07:51,980
You get what I'm saying?

329
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:54,240
So, further down

330
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,579
in this VSL section of this

331
00:07:55,579 --> 00:07:55,819
course,

332
00:07:55,819 --> 00:07:57,579
you'll see another VSL training

333
00:07:57,579 --> 00:07:58,759
from Nick Verge.

334
00:07:58,759 --> 00:07:59,959
Nick Verge is a professional

335
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:00,629
copywriter.

336
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,019
Nick Verge is hyper intelligent,

337
00:08:03,019 --> 00:08:03,339
right?

338
00:08:03,339 --> 00:08:06,759
So, like a very extremely good

339
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:07,420
copywriter.

340
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:09,240
So, Nick Verge teaches VSLs

341
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,069
in a little bit of a different

342
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:10,339
way.

343
00:08:10,339 --> 00:08:12,720
And you'll see it.

344
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,300
I won't go into a deep explanation

345
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:14,720
of it,

346
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,879
but my way is easier

347
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:17,079
to get started with.

348
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:19,420
Nick's way is more advantageous

349
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,439
for you to take the time

350
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:21,399
and learn if you plan

351
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:22,420
on getting good at copy

352
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:23,939
or direct response copywriting

353
00:08:23,939 --> 00:08:24,680
in any capacity.

354
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,879
I'd recommend you do go through

355
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,129
it,

356
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,439
but you could proceed forward

357
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,889
with this course and everything

358
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:34,168
without having gone through that

359
00:08:34,168 --> 00:08:34,929
yet, right?

360
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,490
So, for instance,

361
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,298
if you ever foresee yourself

362
00:08:38,298 --> 00:08:39,440
writing VSLs for clients,

363
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,460
it's a really good idea

364
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:41,658
for you to go watch Nick Verge's

365
00:08:41,658 --> 00:08:41,940
version

366
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:42,679
of writing VSL

367
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:43,500
and seeing what he has to say

368
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:44,580
about creative briefs

369
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,000
in particular, right?

370
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,519
In the future,

371
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:47,659
various amounts of Nick's content

372
00:08:47,659 --> 00:08:49,500
will be posted inside that section

373
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:49,759
as well.

374
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:51,679
So, I would recommend you go watch

375
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:51,909
it.

376
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:52,740
I'm going to label it

377
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:54,720
as Video Sales Lenders Advanced,

378
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,700
right?

379
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,220
But this is like a basic,

380
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:57,960
what I'm going to show you here

381
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,879
is a basic structure of VSL.

382
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:00,500
So, TableCon,

383
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,000
we're going to talk about

384
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,830
how to structure VSL

385
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:02,639
and VSL elements

386
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:04,240
and then examples of VSLs

387
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,129
