1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,879
All right so these are examples of

2
00:00:01,879 --> 00:00:03,540
vsls that worked on cold traffic

3
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:04,900
plus the templates that

4
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:06,059
you can actually sit and use so

5
00:00:06,059 --> 00:00:07,280
we're going to go through each of

6
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,939
these real quick and and and

7
00:00:08,939 --> 00:00:10,039
kind of just give you like a base

8
00:00:10,039 --> 00:00:11,179
structure and just like show you

9
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:12,310
what this could visually look

10
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,400
like um so cold you must set up

11
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,910
offer v3 here's over here so i've

12
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:19,039
got the actual video as well

13
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:20,969
posted at the top so you can watch

14
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:22,899
that as well um so again headline

15
00:00:23,019 --> 00:00:24,620
um i put a table of contents

16
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:26,100
here for them to see um expected

17
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:27,589
roi and results section this is

18
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:29,519
the sales argument system section

19
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,850
this is the section where it shows

20
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:33,750
how it works um this is just i i

21
00:00:33,979 --> 00:00:36,140
decided to put in here in this

22
00:00:36,659 --> 00:00:38,020
particular vsl on some typical

23
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:40,000
kpis because we were getting like

24
00:00:40,109 --> 00:00:42,259
a bunch of questions about that so

25
00:00:42,259 --> 00:00:43,619
this this was like an iteration i

26
00:00:43,619 --> 00:00:44,880
made up at after getting sales

27
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:45,810
calls and like as as as a

28
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:46,380
secondary

29
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:47,969
note like you don't make one vsl

30
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:49,429
and like that's the vsl you do

31
00:00:49,429 --> 00:00:51,060
forever you're gonna do like

32
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:51,359
fucking

33
00:00:51,469 --> 00:00:53,310
100 of these in your life like

34
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:54,929
you're always gonna be making

35
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:56,719
changes to stuff this is just how

36
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:57,240
life is

37
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,640
i understand like it's a pain in

38
00:00:59,649 --> 00:01:02,090
the ass to re-record things but

39
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:04,000
what you have to ask yourself

40
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,090
is like would you rather have the

41
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:07,719
comfort of not needing to

42
00:01:07,719 --> 00:01:11,420
re-record something but having all

43
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:12,920
fucked up sales process that make

44
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:14,310
that means you need to explain

45
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:15,900
shit constantly over and over and

46
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,150
over and over again on the call

47
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:18,400
which ultimately leads to you

48
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,599
having more work or would you

49
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:19,939
rather

50
00:01:19,939 --> 00:01:21,420
just refilm the fucking thing and

51
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:22,859
solve the problem you get what i'm

52
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:24,299
saying like it's it's like one of

53
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:25,700
those things where it's like yeah

54
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:26,890
it's a pain in the ass but it's

55
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,530
like a leveraged decision right

56
00:01:28,659 --> 00:01:30,140
so this is the section in this

57
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:31,959
particular vsl that walks through

58
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:34,359
the actual deliverables um and

59
00:01:34,359 --> 00:01:34,540
then i

60
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:36,640
just walked through like kind of

61
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,670
like onboarding timelines and

62
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:40,849
whatnot and like but this was this

63
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:42,620
was a contextual to this offer

64
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:44,280
right like you don't you don't

65
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,159
have to have this you can have it

66
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:46,400
like

67
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,900
but you don't have to right so now

68
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:49,420
this is a different iteration of

69
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:50,739
this this is this is a version of

70
00:01:50,849 --> 00:01:50,859
the

71
00:01:50,859 --> 00:01:52,000
same offer but it's targeting a

72
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,200
different person so this is like

73
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,719
an enterprise one it's kind of

74
00:01:54,819 --> 00:01:56,090
going at an angle of what you send

75
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:58,549
100 000 250 000 co-deals per month

76
00:01:58,549 --> 00:02:00,700
so um again same thing as the

77
00:02:01,219 --> 00:02:03,430
headline um expected results um

78
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,159
more expected results i walked

79
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,490
through the roi calculator um

80
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,560
again i show how the system works

81
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,629
um and then this is the part where

82
00:02:13,629 --> 00:02:15,180
i explain what they get

83
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:17,159
um i do another uh onboarding

84
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:19,409
timeline and then i have a pricing

85
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:21,900
section um and it's i have a

86
00:02:22,419 --> 00:02:24,189
comparison against the alternative

87
00:02:24,189 --> 00:02:26,509
now i've seen somebody take this

88
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,050
vsl and then they also made a

89
00:02:30,139 --> 00:02:32,319
like a comparison sheet themselves

90
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,330
where it's like doing it yourself

91
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:35,849
right now let's say like

92
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:37,710
but this is like a kind of like a

93
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:39,719
like a software thing where it's

94
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:41,539
kind of like let's just providing

95
00:02:41,539 --> 00:02:43,599
the software uh it's like a setup

96
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,590
of of the software and it's like

97
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:47,379
we just give them all the

98
00:02:47,379 --> 00:02:47,710
necessary

99
00:02:48,259 --> 00:02:50,449
components cheaper right so it

100
00:02:50,449 --> 00:02:53,259
makes sense to do an alternative

101
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,889
right now i had some guy who was

102
00:02:55,939 --> 00:02:57,800
selling um he was selling like a i

103
00:02:57,889 --> 00:02:59,780
think it was e-com email marketing

104
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,550
or some funnel build i don't

105
00:03:01,569 --> 00:03:03,439
fucking know but like he also made

106
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:05,419
a comparison sheet comparing doing

107
00:03:05,539 --> 00:03:06,960
it yourself versus doing

108
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,560
it through him and i'm like bro

109
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,340
that's not the alternative these

110
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,379
people are thinking of they're

111
00:03:12,379 --> 00:03:13,580
not thinking about doing it

112
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:15,000
themselves they don't even know

113
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,479
you get what i'm saying like and

114
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:16,900
for that

115
00:03:17,419 --> 00:03:20,180
specific offer like because what

116
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:22,969
we find on sales calls is that

117
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:25,979
when people ask us like when we

118
00:03:25,979 --> 00:03:26,500
explain

119
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,710
all these deliverables to them

120
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:28,919
they're what they're asking is

121
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:30,280
like well what would it cost if i

122
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:30,500
did it

123
00:03:30,509 --> 00:03:32,740
myself they're saying that they're

124
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:34,610
actually saying that on sales

125
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:36,599
calls now if your market isn't

126
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:36,810
saying

127
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:38,520
that then don't make a fucking

128
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,360
comparison sheet comparing doing

129
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,000
it yourself because that's not

130
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,680
what they're thinking you get what

131
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,150
i'm saying so so what that would

132
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:46,629
render this as is like if you had

133
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:47,610
a comparison sheet of like

134
00:03:47,659 --> 00:03:48,909
explaining doing it themselves

135
00:03:48,909 --> 00:03:50,439
versus doing it through you but

136
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:51,240
that's

137
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,449
not like what they were thinking

138
00:03:52,449 --> 00:03:53,509
in the first place now this is

139
00:03:53,509 --> 00:03:54,979
like a drop-off point in the vsl

140
00:03:54,979 --> 00:03:55,099
and

141
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:56,009
they're like well that's not

142
00:03:56,009 --> 00:03:56,909
relevant to me now you're just

143
00:03:56,909 --> 00:03:58,199
like babbling fucking nonsense you

144
00:03:58,199 --> 00:03:59,939
get what i'm saying like it needs

145
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:01,680
to be contextual and like you you

146
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,259
you'll the the thing is that

147
00:04:03,259 --> 00:04:04,759
you'll you'll learn what your

148
00:04:04,819 --> 00:04:06,400
market is like and what they say

149
00:04:06,469 --> 00:04:08,479
and what they think over time it

150
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:08,759
just

151
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:11,060
takes time this first vsl you make

152
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:12,990
is not gonna be the final vsl you

153
00:04:13,219 --> 00:04:15,069
make like you're gonna learn

154
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:16,920
hundreds and just fucking

155
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,819
thousands of different little

156
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:21,069
micro nuances about everything as

157
00:04:21,069 --> 00:04:21,699
time goes on

158
00:04:21,699 --> 00:04:24,189
it's just completely impossible to

159
00:04:24,189 --> 00:04:26,449
convey everything every single

160
00:04:26,449 --> 00:04:27,970
thing about every single

161
00:04:28,019 --> 00:04:29,149
market for every single offer to

162
00:04:29,149 --> 00:04:30,879
you because there's just fucking

163
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:33,399
millions of different things

164
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:34,839
that could you get what i'm saying

165
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:36,129
like you just have to go you just

166
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,379
have to do it and just have

167
00:04:37,379 --> 00:04:39,680
like a base level vsl right so

168
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,360
this is another example one of our

169
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:44,879
offer olympia um so olympia has

170
00:04:44,899 --> 00:04:45,769
different kinds of versions

171
00:04:45,769 --> 00:04:46,519
there's like done for you

172
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:47,629
components of olympia there's done

173
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:47,959
with you

174
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:49,019
components of olympia but the

175
00:04:49,019 --> 00:04:50,060
general is that it's like it's

176
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:51,339
like our mastermind offer but like

177
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:53,279
you see here i positioned it to be

178
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:55,199
like done for you so this this vsl

179
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,110
was actually like a case study

180
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,250
funnel so like i started this off

181
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,329
as a case study where i'm kind of

182
00:04:59,329 --> 00:05:00,500
just walking through it but then

183
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,180
i'm kind of like presenting it as

184
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:03,620
a direct offer right so again

185
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,819
here's the 30 000 foot overview

186
00:05:05,819 --> 00:05:06,060
and the

187
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,670
sales argument um this is me

188
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:09,279
showing like the graphical

189
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:11,319
representation of what this looks

190
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:12,389

of olympia so like now this has

201
00:05:29,339 --> 00:05:32,240
two different packages generally

202
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,339
you shouldn't have two different

203
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:35,730
packages you should sell you

204
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,180
should sell one package like and

205
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,670
