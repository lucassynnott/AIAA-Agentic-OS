1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,780
All right, so let's talk about how

2
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:02,940
to structure VSL

3
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:04,280
and the elements of everything

4
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:05,230
and like just an actual full

5
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:05,839
walkthrough

6
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:06,519
of everything that's going on.

7
00:00:06,559 --> 00:00:08,419
So as you saw inside of the offer

8
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:09,000
section,

9
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,289
inside the video about how to sell

10
00:00:10,289 --> 00:00:11,160
high ticket offers,

11
00:00:11,619 --> 00:00:13,640
which is an extremely important

12
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,429
video to understand,

13
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:18,769
you have to understand this video,

14
00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:19,699
right?

15
00:00:19,699 --> 00:00:20,769
So we established that in order to

16
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:21,399
get people to buy,

17
00:00:21,399 --> 00:00:23,100
we must present an opportunity to

18
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:23,379
them,

19
00:00:23,379 --> 00:00:24,920
then convince them with evidence

20
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,329
the opportunity is a good idea for

21
00:00:26,329 --> 00:00:26,579
them

22
00:00:26,579 --> 00:00:28,379
and then make them an offer slash

23
00:00:28,379 --> 00:00:29,359
proposition.

24
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:31,079
So we do this via using ROI

25
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:32,200
calculators,

26
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,560
using client case studies,

27
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,130
or case studies about the

28
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:36,439
opportunity itself,

29
00:00:36,439 --> 00:00:37,390
irregardless of your personal

30
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:37,840
results,

31
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,619
and then explaining the logistical

32
00:00:39,619 --> 00:00:40,780
intensity involved

33
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:41,679
in getting the results

34
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:43,280
and that you will do exactly that

35
00:00:43,329 --> 00:00:43,899
for them.

36
00:00:43,899 --> 00:00:45,070
So logically thinking,

37
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:47,140
this is how you generally want to

38
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:48,369
structure VSL.

39
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:49,520
So attention grabbing headlines,

40
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,439
so either a direct claim of the

41
00:00:50,469 --> 00:00:50,820
result,

42
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,000
you can get them or a strong value

43
00:00:52,049 --> 00:00:52,679
proposition

44
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:53,979
or something genuinely intriguing

45
00:00:53,979 --> 00:00:55,409
needs to be immediately clear what

46
00:00:55,409 --> 00:00:56,159
exactly does he do,

47
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:57,299
the expected results your

48
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,979
prospects can possibly achieve.

49
00:00:58,979 --> 00:01:00,079
So either do case studies or ROI

50
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:00,740
calculators.

51
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:01,859
So this is just an example of an

52
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:02,600
ROI calculator.

53
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,189
So like, you'll learn more about

54
00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:06,450
these in a little bit,

55
00:01:06,459 --> 00:01:07,900
but this is just basically like,

56
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,739
so this is one made for Olympia,

57
00:01:10,739 --> 00:01:11,689
our product Olympia.

58
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:13,530
So it's talking about like ad

59
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:14,359
spend, right?

60
00:01:14,359 --> 00:01:15,930
So how much can you make from,

61
00:01:15,939 --> 00:01:18,510
how much money can you make by

62
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:19,780
doing ads?

63
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:20,659
So like, okay, so let's simulate

64
00:01:20,659 --> 00:01:21,019
this out.

65
00:01:21,019 --> 00:01:21,939
You spend $30,000,

66
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:25,280
say it's $300 cost per call.

67
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:26,629
The close rate on the calls is

68
00:01:26,629 --> 00:01:27,200
20%.

69
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,540
The average monthly amount you

70
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:30,180
charge a client is $4,000.

71
00:01:30,629 --> 00:01:33,310
Your gross profit per customer is

72
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:34,480
80%.

73
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,959
Your average customer stays for

74
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:36,659
six months.

75
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:37,959
That would mean your CAC is

76
00:01:37,959 --> 00:01:39,159
$1,500.

77
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:40,579
You close a,

78
00:01:40,579 --> 00:01:42,260
you get a hundred calls booked,

79
00:01:42,739 --> 00:01:44,920
$24,000 lifetime value.

80
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,439
So you get a 12 to one, eight.

81
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:49,560
12 to one LTGP to CAC ratio.

82
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,040
And that's just explaining.

83
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:51,989
So like what happens is you spend

84
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:52,780
$30,000,

85
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:55,189
you would realize $354,000 in

86
00:01:55,189 --> 00:01:57,260
profit over six months, right?

87
00:01:57,299 --> 00:01:58,390
So this is just a calculator

88
00:01:58,390 --> 00:01:59,299
visualizing this.

89
00:01:59,319 --> 00:01:59,980
And it's like,

90
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:01,120
we're just on a call fucking

91
00:02:01,209 --> 00:02:02,049
showing this to people.

92
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:02,599
You get what I'm saying?

93
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:05,180
So next is a depiction or

94
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:06,200
graphical representation

95
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,120
of how your system works.

96
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,819
So the actual system slash process

97
00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:09,460
you're building for them

98
00:02:09,909 --> 00:02:10,599
represented graphically or with a

99
00:02:10,629 --> 00:02:11,060
flow chart.

100
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:12,590
Number four is what deliverables

101
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:13,419
your offer includes.

102
00:02:13,419 --> 00:02:14,759
And sometimes pricing,

103
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:15,710
but not always generally.

104
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,409
It's safe to just say a range of

105
00:02:18,409 --> 00:02:19,180
pricing

106
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,360
so you don't have to make this in

107
00:02:20,409 --> 00:02:21,180
the entire VSL.

108
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:22,770
But as far as you're concerned

109
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:23,430
right now,

110
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:25,199
don't reveal pricing in your VSL.

111
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:26,539
Then a call to action

112
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,430
and then frequently asked

113
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:27,900
questions.

114
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:30,699
So let's dive a bit more deep

115
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:33,300
into like some like each element

116
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,250
and get a little bit more advanced

117
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:34,819
with this.

118
00:02:34,819 --> 00:02:35,550
So like attention grabbing

119
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:35,979
headlines.

120
00:02:35,979 --> 00:02:37,099
So directly stating your offer.

121
00:02:37,099 --> 00:02:38,960
Here's just some examples.

122
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,860
We help coach the consultants

123
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,340
that have $50,000 revenue in 60

124
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:41,539
days.

125
00:02:41,539 --> 00:02:42,780
Using a VSL funnel guaranteed or

126
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:43,199
you don't pay.

127
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:44,379
I'll be able to launch a VSL

128
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:44,759
funnel

129
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:45,580
for your coaching business

130
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:46,719
and guarantee you sign 20 clients

131
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:47,300
in the next three months.

132
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,310
I'll be able to launch a VSL

133
00:02:48,379 --> 00:02:48,639
funnel

134
00:02:48,659 --> 00:02:49,979
for your coaching business.

135
00:02:49,979 --> 00:02:50,599
Run all your ads.

136
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:51,400
Run all your ads

137
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,569
and guarantee you $50,000 in

138
00:02:52,629 --> 00:02:52,939
profit.

139
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:54,500
Now you could also like fuck with

140
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:54,699
this

141
00:02:54,699 --> 00:02:55,620
and be like,

142
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,060
I'll be able to launch a VSL

143
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:57,479
funnel

144
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,379
for your coaching business.

145
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:05,530
Build all the emails,

146
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:09,759
run all the ads and run it all for

147
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:10,569
you.

148
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:13,349
So like this doesn't have a direct

149
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:14,860
claim inside of it.

150
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:15,740
Now you might be asking,

151
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:17,340
well, Daniel, should I do this

152
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,699
or should I do this?

153
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:21,370
And the answer is that most of the

154
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:21,840
time

155
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,560
you as beginner without any kind

156
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,379
of authority

157
00:03:24,379 --> 00:03:26,120
or any case studies whatsoever,

158
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,469
you really can't get away without

159
00:03:28,469 --> 00:03:29,219
doing this.

160
00:03:29,539 --> 00:03:30,689
And then as you start to get

161
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:31,810
results from clients,

162
00:03:31,819 --> 00:03:32,770
then you can shift to doing

163
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:33,680
something like this.

164
00:03:34,229 --> 00:03:36,909
Generally, that's generally how it

165
00:03:36,909 --> 00:03:37,840
works.

166
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,360
What I'm just saying is that

167
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,060
if you're sitting here doing this

168
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:42,370
and you're not using like a

169
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:43,280
fucking revenue claim

170
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:43,759
or a guarantee

171
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:44,939
and you're a complete beginner

172
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:46,300
with no authority

173
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,159
and no case studies,

174
00:03:48,219 --> 00:03:49,360
there's an extremely low

175
00:03:49,449 --> 00:03:50,000
probability

176
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,180
this will work for you

177
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:51,949
and you need to stop being a

178
00:03:51,949 --> 00:03:52,770
fucking pussy about it.

179
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:54,620
Like I'm just saying that to like,

180
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:56,830
so you understand how this works,

181
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:57,479
right?

182
00:03:57,479 --> 00:03:58,819
So like my first agency

183
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,860
I worked for free.

184
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:03,069
Now you could say some shit

185
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,199
where it's like as well,

186
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:04,560
where it's like,

187
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,879
I'll be able to launch a VSF 100

188
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:06,400
for your coaching business,

189
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,080
I'll be able to build all the

190
00:04:07,129 --> 00:04:07,349
emails,

191
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,490
all the ads and run it all for you

192
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:13,349
on a performance only basis,

193
00:04:13,349 --> 00:04:14,620
right?

194
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:16,959
You can do that.

195
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:17,910
And then you get in a call with

196
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:18,300
the person

197
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:19,290
and you could just say,

198
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:21,019
like you can just also pitch them

199
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:21,819
a setup fee.

200
00:04:21,819 --> 00:04:22,600
You get what I'm saying?

201
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,290
They're not going to like

202
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:26,000
throw a fucking giant shit fit

203
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,019
about the fact that like,

204
00:04:27,019 --> 00:04:27,660
you get what I'm saying?

205
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,699
Like you can say there's a setup

206
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:29,920
fee,

207
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,399
but what you have to understand

208
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:33,259
in this VSL is that

209
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,259
you can only,

210
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,879
and as I said also

211
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:38,220
in the selling high ticket

212
00:04:38,269 --> 00:04:39,240
packages video,

213
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:43,500
the price you are able to command

214
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:47,600
is a product of showing,

215
00:04:48,089 --> 00:04:50,720
showing all of the deliverables

216
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,980
that are associated.

217
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:52,839
like if you sit here

218
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:53,519
and like you get to the

219
00:04:53,569 --> 00:04:54,439
deliverables section

220
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:55,360
of what you're selling

221
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,319
and you list out like

222
00:04:56,319 --> 00:04:59,240
a completely fucking profuse

223
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,170
amount of shit

224
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:01,170
that you do for them,

225
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:02,980
like what's that going to do?

226
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:04,699
It's going to show them

227
00:05:04,709 --> 00:05:05,560
that wow,

228
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:07,709
this guy does a lot of fucking

229
00:05:07,709 --> 00:05:08,000
shit

230
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,319
and even though you said

231
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:10,620
performance only basis

232
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:11,920
in the headline,

233
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,579
they're going to understand like,

234
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:13,899
wow,

235
00:05:13,899 --> 00:05:16,279
this is a completely absurd amount

236
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:16,860
of work

237
00:05:17,259 --> 00:05:18,620
that this guy is going to do for

238
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:18,870
me.

239
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:19,699
Yeah,

240
00:05:19,699 --> 00:05:21,750
I think this fucking does warrant

241
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:23,279
a setup fee

242
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:24,600
or a small like

243
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,839
base retainer

244
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:27,029
on top of the performance.

245
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,730
You get what I'm saying?

246
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,310
Like this is what we're trying to

247
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:29,560
do

248
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,250
in the VSL.

249
00:05:30,379 --> 00:05:32,060
This is the purpose of the VSL.

250
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:34,060
The VSL is a direct application

251
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:34,860
of what I talked about

252
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:35,959
in the How to Sell High Ticket

253
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:36,720
Packages video.

254
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,600
If you haven't watched the video,

255
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,550
go watch the shit again

256
00:05:39,069 --> 00:05:40,019
because it's completely

257
00:05:40,019 --> 00:05:41,720
a thousand percent integral

258
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,410
for you to understand selling at

259
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:44,040
all.

260
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,180
You have to know

261
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,230
what the fuck I'm talking about in

262
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:46,459
there.

263
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:48,939
So number two,

264
00:05:48,939 --> 00:05:50,079
second section of the VSL

265
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:51,939
is a quick sales argument.

266
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:53,420
So like a 30,000 foot overview.

267
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,370
So this is where you just give

268
00:05:54,459 --> 00:05:55,259
a quick sales argument

269
00:05:55,259 --> 00:05:56,519
as to why your thing is so good

270
00:05:56,519 --> 00:05:58,579
and why it makes logical sense,

271
00:05:58,639 --> 00:05:59,040
right?

272
00:05:59,040 --> 00:05:59,720
So for instance,

273
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:01,360
you're going to see examples

274
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:02,699
of this as well,

275
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:03,839
but I got this over here.

276
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:04,810
So this is the one from Olympia.

277
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:05,810
Most people are trying to scale

278
00:06:05,819 --> 00:06:06,360
to seven figures

279
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,310
with cold outreach and content.

280
00:06:07,339 --> 00:06:08,519
This is fundamentally impossible,

281
00:06:08,569 --> 00:06:09,199
right?

282
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:11,779
So basically I just walk through

283
00:06:11,779 --> 00:06:12,459
and saying like,

284
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:13,959
hey, you're trying to scale

285
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:14,910
because Olympia is like

286
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,089
helping them scale with ads,

287
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:16,459
right?

288
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:17,800
So what I'm saying here

289
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:18,550
is like most people

290
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,399
are trying to scale

291
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:20,639
by only doing cold outreach and

292
00:06:20,649 --> 00:06:20,959
content.

293
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:21,339
I'm like, hey,

294
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:22,800
that's fundamentally impossible.

295
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,430
So I give it like a 30,000 foot

296
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:25,860
overview

297
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:26,720
of like a sales argument.

298
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,930
Now here's an example

299
00:06:28,939 --> 00:06:30,839
of a list kit one.

300
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:32,290
We're selling the cold email setup

301
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:32,540
offer.

302
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:33,459
So I just have a section

303
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,379
that says why cold email

304
00:06:34,379 --> 00:06:35,579
is so effective, right?

305
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,800
Here's all the reasons, right?

306
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,139
Just a sales argument here.

307
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,060
So let's define

308
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,519
what a sales argument actually is.

309
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:44,439
It's the structured,

310
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:45,579
persuasive reasoning

311
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,740
you put in front of a prospect

312
00:06:46,819 --> 00:06:47,699
in order to lead them

313
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:48,279
to the conclusion

314
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:49,519
that buying is the only logical

315
00:06:49,529 --> 00:06:49,850
move.

316
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:52,680
We're going to walk through

317
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,079
what Dan Kennedy says

318
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:55,029
about sales arguments here.

319
00:06:55,339 --> 00:06:56,759
So this is like a,

320
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:57,709
this is like a,

321
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:00,540
it's just a point-by-point

322
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:00,910
depiction

323
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,019
of how like Dan Kennedy

324
00:07:02,019 --> 00:07:03,680
defines a sales argument, right?

325
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,480
I won't go,

326
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,240
I won't go like super deep into

327
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:06,420
this,

328
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,319
but it's basically like

329
00:07:07,329 --> 00:07:08,399
pick the jury,

330
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:09,879
define who the verdict,

331
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:11,019
who the verdict is

332
00:07:11,019 --> 00:07:11,699
that you must persuade.

333
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:12,279
Name the niche,

334
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:12,959
situation, budget,

335
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:13,689
desired outcome.

336
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,980
If you cannot describe the jury,

337
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:15,660
you cannot win the case.

338
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:16,540
You've got to state the charge.

339
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:17,680
So name the painful problem

340
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:18,319
and the real cost

341
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:19,079
of letting it continue.

342
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:20,420
Put a dollar figure

343
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:21,589
and a time figure on the loss.

344
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,550
Present the big idea

345
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:23,720
of what's the unique mechanism.

346
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:24,420
one clear idea

347
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:25,370
that explains why this works

348
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:26,319
and the specific mechanism

349
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:26,889
that makes your approach

350
00:07:26,889 --> 00:07:27,240
different.

351
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:27,639
Name it.

352
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:29,360
Establish authority fast.

353
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,459
Prove you are qualified

354
00:07:30,459 --> 00:07:31,139
to argue the case.

355
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:32,100
Credentials, results, media,

356
00:07:32,579 --> 00:07:33,560
clients, years, and market.

357
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,220
Use hard numbers.

358
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,399
Raise the stakes.

359
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,199
Spell out the consequences

360
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:36,839
of doing nothing.

361
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:37,740
Future pays the pain.

362
00:07:38,139 --> 00:07:38,689
Stack proof.

363
00:07:38,819 --> 00:07:39,740
So just show more proof.

364
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:40,420
Chain the logic.

365
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:42,279
So create an if-then sequence

366
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,959
that boxes the jury in.

367
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,779
If you want X

368
00:07:44,779 --> 00:07:45,639
and X requires Y,

369
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:46,220
the only method

370
00:07:46,709 --> 00:07:48,459
reliably delivers Y,

371
00:07:48,459 --> 00:07:48,980
then this offers

372
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:49,800
the logical decision.

373
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,199
Use a damaging emission.

374
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:52,149
Confess a real limitation

375
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:52,939
or past mistake.

376
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:54,180
Then show how the mechanism

377
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:54,699
fixes it.

378
00:07:54,699 --> 00:07:55,540
Detailed offer.

379
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:56,680
Solicit the deliverables.

380
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,160
Timeline.

381
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,060
Access and support.

382
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:58,639
Make it tangible.

383
00:07:59,129 --> 00:08:00,939
Value stack and price

384
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:02,939
from anchor against alternatives.

385
00:08:02,939 --> 00:08:03,759
Remove the risk.

386
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:04,620
That's like a guarantee.

387
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:05,480
Add urgency.

388
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,920
Preempt objections.

389
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,439
Call to action.

390
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:08,459
Micro steps in the future.

391
00:08:08,459 --> 00:08:09,339
Future pays ownership.

392
00:08:09,339 --> 00:08:09,620
Right?

393
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:13,699
So just as like a side tangent

394
00:08:13,699 --> 00:08:15,019
on this,

395
00:08:15,019 --> 00:08:17,259
you could take all of this

396
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:19,480
and feed this

397
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:21,339
to ChatGPT

398
00:08:21,339 --> 00:08:22,019
or Manus

399
00:08:22,019 --> 00:08:22,540
or Claude

400
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:23,250
or whatever the fuck

401
00:08:23,259 --> 00:08:24,220
and then also say like,

402
00:08:24,339 --> 00:08:24,899
hey,

403
00:08:24,899 --> 00:08:25,720
I want your help

404
00:08:26,209 --> 00:08:27,439
making a VSL script

405
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:28,199
or an ad

406
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:30,060
and I want you to follow

407
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:30,800
this logic

408
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,660
of a sales argument

409
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:32,279
with Dan Kennedy

410
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:33,418
or you could just say like,

411
00:08:33,418 --> 00:08:34,200
I want you to help me

412
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,480
to develop a sales argument

413
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:36,620
following this framework

414
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:38,019
by Dan Kennedy.

415
00:08:38,019 --> 00:08:38,940
Here's my offer.

416
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:41,279
And you can fuck with this

417
00:08:41,288 --> 00:08:43,330
and like just use AI

418
00:08:43,379 --> 00:08:44,080
to your advantage

419
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,139
to further your understanding.

420
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:47,110
You get what I'm saying?

421
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:47,639
Like,

422
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,850
you need to become

423
00:08:50,289 --> 00:08:51,059
more AI brain,

424
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,799
like more AI like default.

425
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:54,120
Like that's what you do.

426
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:54,600
You get what I'm saying?

427
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,940
So you could take all of this

428
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,200
and copy this

429
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,149
and just like start fucking

430
00:08:58,279 --> 00:08:58,899
with your offer

431
00:08:58,899 --> 00:09:00,899
and like talking with Manus

432
00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:01,250
or Claude

433
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:01,919
or ChatGPT

434
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:02,419
back and forth

435
00:09:02,419 --> 00:09:03,100
to understand this, right?

436
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,019
So like for instance,

437
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:05,519
let's just walk through

438
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:06,230
some examples here.

439
00:09:07,259 --> 00:09:07,740
This is an example

440
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:08,519
of a webinar offer.

441
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:09,470
So you build webinars

442
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:09,960
for clients.

443
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,559
So I'm just putting

444
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,700
a ChatGPT prompt here.

445
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,309
Condense the sales argument

446
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:15,120
down using the logic

447
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:15,659
of Dan Kennedy

448
00:09:15,659 --> 00:09:16,610
to eight sentences for me

449
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:17,820
and then create a sales argument

450
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:18,620
for me for this offer.

451
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:19,379
We help clients build

452
00:09:19,379 --> 00:09:20,279
an advertised webinar funnel

453
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:20,759
for the business

454
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:21,419
so that they can acquire

455
00:09:21,419 --> 00:09:22,320
more high ticket coaching clients.

456
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:22,879
We build the funnel

457
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:23,700
via sell all the copy,

458
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:24,000
all the ads,

459
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:24,679
the webinar itself,

460
00:09:25,139 --> 00:09:25,850
attacking all the back-end

461
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:26,340
selling systems

462
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:27,200
to maximize the return

463
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:27,559
to the webinar.

464
00:09:27,559 --> 00:09:27,909
Okay.

465
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,399
So this is what

466
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:30,940
ChatGPT spit out.

467
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:33,149
Most coaching businesses

468
00:09:33,179 --> 00:09:33,779
are stuck chasing

469
00:09:33,779 --> 00:09:34,460
low quality leads,

470
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,320
wasting money on ads

471
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:35,960
or posting endlessly

472
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,539
on social media

473
00:09:36,539 --> 00:09:37,250
without ever creating

474
00:09:37,259 --> 00:09:37,940
a predictable client flow.

475
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,840
The root problem is simple.

476
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,179
They don't have a proven system

477
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:40,909
that turns strangers

478
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:41,580
into educated,

479
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,529
pre-sold high ticket buyers

480
00:09:42,659 --> 00:09:43,000
at scale.

481
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,659
That's exactly what

482
00:09:43,659 --> 00:09:44,350
a webinar funnel does.

483
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:44,899
It positions you

484
00:09:44,899 --> 00:09:45,360
as an expert,

485
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,159
builds trust and leverage

486
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:46,720
and gets prospects

487
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:47,669
ready to buy

488
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,639
before you ever speak to them.

489
00:09:48,659 --> 00:09:50,259
We don't just give you

490
00:09:50,299 --> 00:09:51,120
advice on how to build one.

491
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:51,879
We build the entire thing

492
00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:52,159
for you.

493
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:52,460
The funnel,

494
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:52,779
the webinar,

495
00:09:52,779 --> 00:09:53,240
the VSL,

496
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:53,480
the ads,

497
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:53,799
the copy,

498
00:09:53,799 --> 00:09:54,059
the tech,

499
00:09:54,059 --> 00:09:54,919
the back-end selling systems

500
00:09:54,919 --> 00:09:55,679
to maximize conversion.

501
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:56,340
It's the same model

502
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:56,980
top coaches use

503
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:57,659
to book dozens of sales

504
00:09:57,659 --> 00:09:58,340
costs in a week

505
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:00,159
without relying on referrals

506
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:00,870
or organic grind.

507
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:02,240
You compare the cost

508
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:03,139
to figure this out yourself

509
00:10:03,139 --> 00:10:03,779
versus plugging it

510
00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:04,559
into a done-for-you system.

511
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:05,059
The numbers make

512
00:10:05,059 --> 00:10:06,799
the decision obvious.

513
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:07,940
Waiting just delays

514
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:08,580
the revenue moving

515
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:08,820
to the table.

516
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:09,299
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

517
00:10:09,299 --> 00:10:10,279
So like personally,

518
00:10:10,769 --> 00:10:12,820
like I changed this up

519
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:13,299
a little bit.

520
00:10:13,789 --> 00:10:15,639
This is what I would

521
00:10:16,129 --> 00:10:16,350
personally say

522
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:18,620
having read this output.

523
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,100
If you run a high ticket

524
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:20,639
coaching business

525
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:21,299
with a low quality,

526
00:10:21,299 --> 00:10:21,659
leads,

527
00:10:21,659 --> 00:10:22,419
not enough sales calls

528
00:10:22,419 --> 00:10:23,320
and no predictable system

529
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,120
of getting high ticket buyers

530
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:24,440
on the phone,

531
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,389
then the only reasonable way

532
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:26,019
to fix your problem

533
00:10:26,019 --> 00:10:26,820
right now is with a webinar.

534
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:27,919
A webinar is the only funnel

535
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:28,539
that positions you

536
00:10:28,539 --> 00:10:28,980
as an expert

537
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:29,929
and gives sufficient time

538
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:30,950
together with you

539
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:31,419
and a prospect

540
00:10:31,419 --> 00:10:32,080
to actually get them

541
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:32,659
into buying mode.

542
00:10:32,659 --> 00:10:33,240
That's why we're able

543
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,519
to see 5 to 6x returns

544
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:35,080
of cold traffic

545
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:35,809
with a webinar funnel

546
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,159
and we do all this for you.

547
00:10:37,179 --> 00:10:37,500
The funnel,

548
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,059
webinar slides,

549
00:10:38,059 --> 00:10:38,519
automations,

550
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:38,940
the ads,

551
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:39,519
the copy,

552
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:39,799
the tech,

553
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:40,100
the SMS,

554
00:10:40,179 --> 00:10:40,500
the email,

555
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,299
the back-end selling system,

556
00:10:41,299 --> 00:10:41,620
everything.

557
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:42,299
All you do is show up

558
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:42,659
to the webinar

559
00:10:42,659 --> 00:10:43,139
and say exactly

560
00:10:43,139 --> 00:10:43,720
what we tell you

561
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,460
and we can have this

562
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:46,039
up and running for you

563
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:46,720
in the next 10 days

564
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,860
and guarantee you

565
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:48,360
see a profit

566
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,120
or you pay us nothing.

567
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:50,440
Right?

568
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,919
So that's just an example.

569
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:52,820
So you can do the same thing

570
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:53,769
with a content offer.

571
00:10:53,879 --> 00:10:54,830
I'm not going to spend

572
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:55,600
too much time on it.

573
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:56,870
The link to this Gamma Doc

574
00:10:56,879 --> 00:10:58,220
is in the description.

575
00:10:58,259 --> 00:10:59,399
You can open it up yourself

576
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:00,200
and read through this.

577
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:02,539
But the premise of saying,

578
00:11:02,539 --> 00:11:03,799
like another side note

579
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:04,980
to say is that

580
00:11:05,509 --> 00:11:07,960
like what I said in here,

581
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:09,360
what I said

582
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,159
is that

583
00:11:10,649 --> 00:11:12,740
this is the only reasonable way

584
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:13,500
to fix your problem.

585
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:13,840
Right?

586
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:15,899
And then also in here,

587
00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:16,519
like I'm going to,

588
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:17,919
also in this content agency thing,

589
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:18,559
I'm also going to say

590
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:19,419
content is the best,

591
00:11:19,419 --> 00:11:20,080
now fuck ads.

592
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:20,399
Right?

593
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,139
And then in this one

594
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:21,440
I'm going to say

595
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:22,470
LinkedIn content is the best.

596
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:23,440
And what I'm going to say

597
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:24,559
in this LinkedIn one

598
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:25,860
is LinkedIn is the best,

599
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:26,639
fuck cold email.

600
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:27,200
You get what I'm saying?

601
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,059
So you got to understand

602
00:11:29,139 --> 00:11:29,940
what's happening here

603
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:30,889
and become immune

604
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:31,539
to propaganda.

605
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:32,200
Right?

606
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:32,639
So

607
00:11:33,129 --> 00:11:36,399
if someone is selling

608
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:39,740
a webinar funnel build out,

609
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,950
a fucking course

610
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:43,120
you should say

611
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,149
that a webinar

612
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,940
is the only way

613
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:47,340
to fix their problem.

614
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:47,620
Like,

615
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,419
you don't fucking sit here

616
00:11:49,419 --> 00:11:49,940
and say like,

617
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,519
like you and I both know

618
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,019
that,

619
00:11:52,509 --> 00:11:52,820
well,

620
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:53,919
a VSL funnel

621
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:55,039
also could work.

622
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:56,179
A low ticket product funnel

623
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,360
also could work.

624
00:11:57,379 --> 00:11:57,600
Right?

625
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,059
Doing cold outbound

626
00:11:59,059 --> 00:12:00,080
also could work.

627
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:00,980
And that's like the reasonable

628
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:01,820
way to go about this.

629
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:02,620
But if you're like,

630
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:03,759
if you're offering

631
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:05,100
all of the available

632
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:06,639
contingencies to somebody,

633
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:07,899
you're basically saying

634
00:12:07,899 --> 00:12:09,940
you don't have to buy my stuff.

635
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:11,539
You can go buy something else,

636
00:12:11,559 --> 00:12:12,379
which is a completely

637
00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:13,330
fucking retarded way

638
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,200
to go about selling.

639
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:14,600
Like,

640
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,379
you gotta,

641
00:12:15,379 --> 00:12:15,779
like,

642
00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:18,120
when I say some shit in here,

643
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:18,559
like,

644
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:20,799
LinkedIn is the single best

645
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:21,059
platform

646
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:21,720
to book sales calls

647
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,019
with buyers

648
00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:22,940
who actually have budget.

649
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:23,379
Now,

650
00:12:23,379 --> 00:12:24,980
if I just said that to you,

651
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:25,950
like,

652
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:26,879
you would think

653
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:30,480
that my actual ingrained belief

654
00:12:30,909 --> 00:12:32,340
is that LinkedIn

655
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:33,940
is the single best.

656
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:35,740
And that's not what I'm saying.

657
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,299
I'm saying that in the context

658
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:40,350
of if I was fucking selling

659
00:12:40,419 --> 00:12:41,370
a LinkedIn offer,

660
00:12:41,419 --> 00:12:43,470
that's what I have to say.

661
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,059
You get what I'm saying?

662
00:12:45,549 --> 00:12:46,200
Like,

663
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:47,460
like,

664
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:48,580
it's propaganda.

665
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:51,870
I'm exuding propaganda.

666
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:53,080
You get what I'm saying?

667
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:53,379
Like,

668
00:12:53,379 --> 00:12:53,720
so,

669
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,419
you need to learn,

670
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:56,039
like,

671
00:12:56,039 --> 00:12:57,139
as a marketer,

672
00:12:57,629 --> 00:12:58,279
like,

673
00:12:58,379 --> 00:13:00,039
not everything you see

674
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:01,179
is fucking true.

675
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:01,620
It's,

676
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:02,480
you get what I'm saying?

677
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:02,879
Like,

678
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:04,059
you need to learn

679
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:05,779
how to maneuver

680
00:13:05,779 --> 00:13:07,200
this fuckery yourself

681
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:07,980
and understand

682
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,129
what the fuck is being said.

683
00:13:09,139 --> 00:13:10,059
You get what I'm saying?

684
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:10,379
This is like,

685
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:11,559
this is like super important

686
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:12,139
for you to understand.

687
00:13:12,139 --> 00:13:12,490
So,

688
00:13:13,009 --> 00:13:14,570
that was just like

689
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:15,279
a side tangent.

690
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:15,860
So,

691
00:13:16,289 --> 00:13:17,320
all right,

692
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:17,879
so let's talk about

693
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:19,019
the expected results

694
00:13:19,019 --> 00:13:19,639
your prospects

695
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:20,740
can possibly achieve,

696
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:20,940
right?

697
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:21,220
So,

698
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:22,389
case studies

699
00:13:22,889 --> 00:13:23,990
slash studies of a case.

700
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:24,139
So,

701
00:13:24,139 --> 00:13:25,000
if you have case studies,

702
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,120
this is where you'd put them.

703
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:26,240
So,

704
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:26,919
case studies being

705
00:13:27,409 --> 00:13:27,840
screenshots of results

706
00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:29,879
or interviews with clients

707
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,259
revealing quantifiable results,

708
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:32,600
ideally revenue generated,

709
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:32,860
right?

710
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:33,059
So,

711
00:13:33,059 --> 00:13:33,879
if you don't have case studies,

712
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:34,220
this is,

713
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:35,080
okay,

714
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:35,360
so,

715
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,309
you understand,

716
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:36,679
like,

717
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:38,220
what a case study

718
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,169
is effectively doing

719
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:39,820
is,

720
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,870
it's showing them

721
00:13:41,899 --> 00:13:42,539
two things.

722
00:13:42,539 --> 00:13:43,250
One is that

723
00:13:43,259 --> 00:13:44,179
the thing you're selling works

724
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:44,929
and two is that

725
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:45,779
you're a person

726
00:13:45,779 --> 00:13:47,340
who can execute

727
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,259
the thing correctly

728
00:13:48,279 --> 00:13:49,139
to actually generate

729
00:13:49,139 --> 00:13:49,440
the result,

730
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:49,720
right?

731
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,259
So,

732
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:51,460
there's two components here.

733
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:52,320
It's that the thing works

734
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,000
and that you work,

735
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:53,259
right?

736
00:13:53,259 --> 00:13:53,500
So,

737
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,480
if you lack a case study

738
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:57,340
which shows that

739
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,159
the thing works

740
00:13:58,159 --> 00:13:58,840
and you work,

741
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,700
you've got to try to do

742
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:01,600
a reasonable effort

743
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,059
of at least getting

744
00:14:03,549 --> 00:14:04,620
some evidence

745
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:05,720
that the thing works

746
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,059
irregardless of you doing it,

747
00:14:07,059 --> 00:14:07,179
right?

748
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:07,320
So,

749
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,240
you have to sell somebody

750
00:14:08,299 --> 00:14:09,480
the concept

751
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:11,299
that the thing works

752
00:14:11,299 --> 00:14:11,879
at all.

753
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:12,399
You get what I'm saying?

754
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:12,620
So,

755
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:13,500
you've got to understand

756
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,659
like why I said this,

757
00:14:14,659 --> 00:14:15,279
studies of a case.

758
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:15,419
So,

759
00:14:15,419 --> 00:14:16,220
like a case study

760
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:17,360
like could be defined

761
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:17,879
as like

762
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:20,080
it's the

763
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:20,799
it's the study

764
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:21,750
of a case

765
00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:22,509
that occurred.

766
00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:23,440
It doesn't necessarily

767
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:24,409
have to be a case

768
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:25,860
that you were in charge of

769
00:14:25,899 --> 00:14:27,440
but it's a study

770
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,340
of a case.

771
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:28,740
Now,

772
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:29,690
that doesn't mean

773
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:30,419
you're going to sit here

774
00:14:30,419 --> 00:14:31,370
and fucking lie

775
00:14:31,389 --> 00:14:32,720
that a case study

776
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:33,019
is yours.

777
00:14:33,019 --> 00:14:34,259
Do not do that.

778
00:14:34,259 --> 00:14:35,600
Don't fucking lie,

779
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:35,899
right?

780
00:14:35,899 --> 00:14:36,820
But I'm just saying

781
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:37,580
is that

782
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:39,039
if you were to present

783
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:40,179
a study of a case

784
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:41,179
that is not yours,

785
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:43,389
you need to explicitly state

786
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,820
it's not your case study.

787
00:14:45,019 --> 00:14:45,139
So,

788
00:14:45,139 --> 00:14:45,659
like for instance,

789
00:14:45,659 --> 00:14:46,340
let me show you

790
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:46,840
what's possible

791
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,679
with a VSL funnel

792
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:49,000
and to do that

793
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:49,500
I'm going to walk you

794
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,019
through an example.

795
00:14:50,019 --> 00:14:51,190
Here we have Daniel Fazio

796
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,039
with his company ListKit.

797
00:14:52,039 --> 00:14:52,679
Here are all his ads

798
00:14:52,679 --> 00:14:53,480
on Facebook Ad Library

799
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,190
and here are the landing pages

800
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,000
he's sending these ads to.

801
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,279
You can see that these ads

802
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:57,179
are leading to an opt-in page.

803
00:14:57,179 --> 00:14:57,860
Once the people opt-in

804
00:14:57,919 --> 00:14:58,220
his ads,

805
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:58,740
they can automate

806
00:14:58,740 --> 00:14:59,399
text messages and emails

807
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:00,049
after they opt-in

808
00:15:00,059 --> 00:15:01,009
they're taking to a VSL page.

809
00:15:01,059 --> 00:15:02,200
This page has an application

810
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,399
that qualifies his prospects

811
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:04,860
to make sure

812
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,860
he's talking to people

813
00:15:06,899 --> 00:15:07,590
that can afford his offer

814
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,309
from their sales calls

815
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:08,620
or booking

816
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:09,279
he's selling packages

817
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:10,009
in the range of $600

818
00:15:10,019 --> 00:15:11,620
to $6,000 a month.

819
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:12,399
ListKit is doing

820
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:13,080
over a million a month

821
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:13,500
with his funnel.

822
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:14,299
Now,

823
00:15:14,299 --> 00:15:14,840
first off,

824
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,940
you can't use me

825
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:16,559
as an example

826
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:18,320
because if you were to do that

827
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,269
every fucking one of you

828
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:19,840
would just use me

829
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,360
as an example

830
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:20,960
and then like

831
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:21,639
don't do that.

832
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:22,200
You need to go find

833
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:22,740
your own example.

834
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:24,399
But if you were doing this

835
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:24,659
for instance

836
00:15:24,659 --> 00:15:25,220
you would just show

837
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:25,740
some screenshots

838
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:26,539
of the shit, right?

839
00:15:26,539 --> 00:15:27,080
So,

840
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,500
what you're effectively doing here

841
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,379
all you're doing here

842
00:15:29,379 --> 00:15:30,990
is just selling

843
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,399
the concept of the thing.

844
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:32,759
So,

845
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:33,679
this is like an example

846
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,139
of just selling a VSL

847
00:15:35,139 --> 00:15:36,240
an opt-in VSL funnel

848
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:36,879
as a concept.

849
00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:38,049
You know what I'm saying?

850
00:15:38,059 --> 00:15:38,399
So,

851
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:39,960
all the while

852
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:40,419
you're not saying

853
00:15:40,419 --> 00:15:41,080
these are your case studies.

854
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:41,700
You're not lying.

855
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:42,500
What you're doing

856
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,100
is simply selling

857
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:43,779
the opportunity itself.

858
00:15:43,779 --> 00:15:44,730
If your thing

859
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,000
is making low ticket

860
00:15:46,039 --> 00:15:46,990
product ascension funnels

861
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,279
then you find examples

862
00:15:48,279 --> 00:15:49,200
of people doing that instead.

863
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:49,779
If your thing

864
00:15:49,779 --> 00:15:50,730
is cloud view email marketing

865
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:51,419
you find brands

866
00:15:51,419 --> 00:15:52,220
doing an amazing job

867
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,559
and use them as a result.

868
00:15:53,559 --> 00:15:54,480
If your thing is content

869
00:15:54,539 --> 00:15:55,100
then you find people

870
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:55,789
doing content right.

871
00:15:55,799 --> 00:15:56,659
The premise is that

872
00:15:56,659 --> 00:15:57,120
you're selling them

873
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,269
on the opportunity itself.

874
00:15:58,279 --> 00:15:59,379
You need to do your best

875
00:15:59,379 --> 00:15:59,820
to find out

876
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:00,340
how much money

877
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:01,039
the examples

878
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:02,360
you're using are making.

879
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,309
It's typically easy

880
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:03,919
to find out

881
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:04,440
if you ask around.

882
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,120
People like to brag

883
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:05,659
about how much money

884
00:16:05,659 --> 00:16:06,159
they make on the internet

885
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:06,600
so it's normally

886
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,039
easy to find.

887
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:07,259
So,

888
00:16:07,259 --> 00:16:08,600
it is in fact

889
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:09,440
possible to get a

890
00:16:09,929 --> 00:16:10,220
okay,

891
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:11,620
just side note.

892
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:12,740
It is in fact

893
00:16:13,179 --> 00:16:13,659
possible to get away

894
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:14,580
without doing this

895
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:15,860
case or study

896
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:16,779
of a case results section

897
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:19,440
but only if you've done

898
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,220
a really good job

899
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:20,919
of conveying

900
00:16:20,919 --> 00:16:21,870
your 30,000 foot

901
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:22,860
overview sales argument

902
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:23,480
and have a great

903
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,120
value proposition.

904
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:24,399
So,

905
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:24,759
for instance,

906
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:25,399
if you have a value

907
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:26,320
proposition in your headline

908
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,019
like I'll launch

909
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:28,730
and scale your paid

910
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:29,320
traffic funnel

911
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:29,940
and generate you

912
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:30,889
leads using my own money

913
00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:31,820
you only pay on results

914
00:16:31,889 --> 00:16:33,779
then that would be good.

915
00:16:34,179 --> 00:16:34,419
Right?

916
00:16:34,909 --> 00:16:36,179
This offer would

917
00:16:36,669 --> 00:16:37,129
technically be structured

918
00:16:37,179 --> 00:16:37,889
in such a fashion

919
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:39,600
that they still have to

920
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,200
pay a set of fee

921
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,120
plus cost per call book

922
00:16:41,139 --> 00:16:41,740
and you are effectively

923
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:42,500
making money based

924
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,080
on the arbitrage

925
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,179
of what you can

926
00:16:44,179 --> 00:16:45,059
get calls book

927
00:16:45,059 --> 00:16:45,600
versus how much

928
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,549
you charge the client

929
00:16:46,659 --> 00:16:47,440
for each call.

930
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:47,620
So,

931
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:48,399
there's always some

932
00:16:48,889 --> 00:16:50,580
wordplay trickery

933
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:51,759
maneuvering going on.

934
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:52,879
You just need to like

935
00:16:52,889 --> 00:16:53,840
learn how to do that

936
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:54,240
yourself.

937
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:54,419
Right?

938
00:16:54,419 --> 00:16:54,600
So,

939
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:55,549
second,

940
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:55,960
next,

941
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:56,820
ROI calculator.

942
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:57,059
So,

943
00:16:57,549 --> 00:16:58,240
immediately after showing

944
00:16:58,259 --> 00:16:58,759
the results that are

945
00:16:58,759 --> 00:16:59,620
possible to be achieved

946
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:00,259
this is where you want

947
00:17:00,259 --> 00:17:00,740
to make the numbers

948
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:01,519
more tangible for them

949
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:02,470
and use an ROI calculator.

950
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,820
The easiest way

951
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:04,920
to make an ROI calculator

952
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,318
is do Claude or Bolt

953
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:07,220
or there's some other ways

954
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:07,680
there's going to be

955
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,240
some more training

956
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,160
on ROI calculators

957
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:09,970
specifically but

958
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,440
Bolt makes it look

959
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:12,078
prettier.

960
00:17:12,568 --> 00:17:13,220
So,

961
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:14,140
this is like an actual

962
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:15,539
thing that

963
00:17:15,539 --> 00:17:16,338
Claude made

964
00:17:16,338 --> 00:17:16,700
right here.

965
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:16,838
So,

966
00:17:16,838 --> 00:17:18,640
I made this

967
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,200
in Claude,

968
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:19,740
right?

969
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:21,480
So,

970
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,430
this is what's called

971
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:23,140
a Claude artifact.

972
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:23,838
There's going to be

973
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:24,588
more training on

974
00:17:24,598 --> 00:17:25,529
our ROI calculator

975
00:17:25,539 --> 00:17:26,380
so I'm not going

976
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,200
to go deep into it.

977
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:28,119
Now,

978
00:17:28,259 --> 00:17:28,819
a question you might

979
00:17:28,819 --> 00:17:29,359
have here is

980
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:30,119
when should you

981
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:30,819
reveal price,

982
00:17:31,309 --> 00:17:32,319
exact price in your VSL?

983
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:33,000
As far as you should

984
00:17:33,059 --> 00:17:33,740
be concerned right now,

985
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:34,240
you should not be

986
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:34,930
revealing your price

987
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:35,339
in your VSL.

988
00:17:35,339 --> 00:17:36,619
It generally becomes

989
00:17:36,619 --> 00:17:37,519
okay to reveal price

990
00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:38,039
once you have tons

991
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:38,500
of case studies

992
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:38,940
and you have tons

993
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:39,339
of inbound

994
00:17:39,339 --> 00:17:39,940
because your authority

995
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:40,420
level is high

996
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:40,960
but for now,

997
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:41,559
don't do that.

998
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:44,400
Next is a depiction

999
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,700
or graphical representation

1000
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:46,799
of how your system works.

1001
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:46,940
So,

1002
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:47,650
this is kind of like

1003
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,339
it's just a visual show

1004
00:17:49,339 --> 00:17:51,000
of what exactly

1005
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:51,920
is the system

1006
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,869
you're selling.

1007
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:53,740
You understand like

1008
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:56,160
if you want to charge

1009
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:56,960
a lot of money

1010
00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:00,130
like you're selling

1011
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:00,779
a system

1012
00:18:00,789 --> 00:18:01,680
like a full

1013
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,099
a full system

1014
00:18:03,099 --> 00:18:04,400
of accomplishing something

1015
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:04,640
right?

1016
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,920
You got to understand

1017
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,339
that like

1018
00:18:06,339 --> 00:18:07,839
you need to sell

1019
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:08,519
a car

1020
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:09,779
not tires

1021
00:18:09,779 --> 00:18:10,339
right?

1022
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:10,779
You're selling

1023
00:18:10,779 --> 00:18:11,920
a full fucking car

1024
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:12,309
right?

1025
00:18:12,339 --> 00:18:12,900
And then

1026
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:13,700
if you get on a phone

1027
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:14,119
with a client

1028
00:18:14,119 --> 00:18:14,599
and they don't want

1029
00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:15,220
the full car

1030
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,039
because they already

1031
00:18:16,039 --> 00:18:16,559
have a car

1032
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:17,079
then you could sell

1033
00:18:17,079 --> 00:18:17,539
them tires

1034
00:18:17,539 --> 00:18:18,279
to their current car.

1035
00:18:18,279 --> 00:18:18,759
You get what I'm saying?

1036
00:18:18,759 --> 00:18:19,680
But you're not going

1037
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,039
to get people

1038
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:20,440
on the phone

1039
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:20,920
unless you're selling

1040
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:21,269
the car

1041
00:18:21,789 --> 00:18:22,700
first.

1042
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:23,779
You see what I mean?

1043
00:18:23,779 --> 00:18:24,140
So,

1044
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:25,660
so this is the point

1045
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:26,369
where you say something like

1046
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:26,839
so now that

1047
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,019
you know what kind

1048
00:18:28,039 --> 00:18:28,740
of results are possible

1049
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:28,960
with this

1050
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:29,380
let me show you

1051
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:29,819
how the system

1052
00:18:29,819 --> 00:18:30,460
is even constructed

1053
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:31,039
in the first place

1054
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:31,799
and how the whole thing works

1055
00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:32,750
and you then lead them

1056
00:18:32,839 --> 00:18:33,759
into some graphical depiction

1057
00:18:33,819 --> 00:18:34,299
of what your things

1058
00:18:34,299 --> 00:18:34,619
looks like.

1059
00:18:34,619 --> 00:18:35,059
So sometimes

1060
00:18:35,059 --> 00:18:35,720
this system

1061
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,380
is fairly simple

1062
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:36,940
you can get away

1063
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:37,380
with just like

1064
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:38,240
some gamma

1065
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,160
native diagrams

1066
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:39,599
so like

1067
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:40,259
for instance

1068
00:18:40,259 --> 00:18:40,859
you go over here

1069
00:18:41,259 --> 00:18:41,640
gamma has like

1070
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,559
these native diagrams

1071
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,599
where you could like

1072
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,200
just visually show

1073
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:45,799
what the fuck

1074
00:18:45,799 --> 00:18:46,640
what the fuck

1075
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:46,960
you're doing

1076
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:47,400
you get what I'm saying?

1077
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,279
Or you could like

1078
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,279
you do this thing

1079
00:18:50,299 --> 00:18:50,700
with gamma

1080
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:51,259
over here

1081
00:18:51,259 --> 00:18:51,579
where it's like

1082
00:18:51,579 --> 00:18:52,039
you do this

1083
00:18:52,039 --> 00:18:52,460
and you can do

1084
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:53,410
visualize this text

1085
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:54,680
or edit

1086
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:55,799
with AI

1087
00:18:56,259 --> 00:18:56,640
expand the text

1088
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,240
or convert

1089
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,000
to a specific

1090
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:58,599
type of thing

1091
00:18:58,599 --> 00:18:59,180
you get what I'm saying?

1092
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:00,940
You can fuck

1093
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:01,339
with it yourself

1094
00:19:01,339 --> 00:19:01,819
or again

1095
00:19:01,819 --> 00:19:02,339
you can use Claude

1096
00:19:02,339 --> 00:19:02,900
to create an artifact

1097
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:03,559
from a description

1098
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:04,000
of your system

1099
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:04,740
so here's an example

1100
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:07,279
so I said this

1101
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:07,779
in Claude

1102
00:19:07,779 --> 00:19:08,359
so can you

1103
00:19:08,359 --> 00:19:09,039
can you create

1104
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:09,819
a graphical depiction

1105
00:19:09,819 --> 00:19:10,500
that visually shows

1106
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,259
and explains the following

1107
00:19:11,259 --> 00:19:12,210
a video sales order funnel

1108
00:19:12,279 --> 00:19:13,200
that uses Facebook ads

1109
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,140
to send to an opt-in page

1110
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:14,759
the opt-in page

1111
00:19:14,759 --> 00:19:15,319
collects name

1112
00:19:15,319 --> 00:19:16,049
email phone number

1113
00:19:16,059 --> 00:19:17,180
immediately after opting in

1114
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:17,740
the user is taken

1115
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:18,700
to a page with a VSL

1116
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:19,480
embedded in a button

1117
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,259
to submit an application

1118
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:21,660
obviously not everybody

1119
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,609
will submit the application

1120
00:19:23,109 --> 00:19:24,779
so we use their phone

1121
00:19:24,779 --> 00:19:25,259
over to text

1122
00:19:25,259 --> 00:19:25,720
and call them

1123
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,309
we also use their email

1124
00:19:27,319 --> 00:19:27,759
to send them

1125
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:28,420
promotional emails

1126
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:28,980
these promotional

1127
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:30,720
email flows

1128
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,640
contain a 10 sequence

1129
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:32,839
series of automated emails

1130
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:33,400
and then

1131
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,319
you get the point

1132
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:34,839
I'm just like

1133
00:19:35,329 --> 00:19:36,599
fully explaining

1134
00:19:36,599 --> 00:19:37,460
the offer

1135
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:38,059
right

1136
00:19:38,059 --> 00:19:39,240
and then this is the output

1137
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:39,990
of what Claude made

1138
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,599
this is what it looks like

1139
00:19:42,049 --> 00:19:42,940
this is called

1140
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:43,720
a Claude artifact

1141
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,640
it like publishes it

1142
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:45,339
on a URL

1143
00:19:45,829 --> 00:19:46,160
right

1144
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,019
and you can share

1145
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:47,680
this URL

1146
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,119
or you can take

1147
00:19:49,609 --> 00:19:49,980
screenshots of the URL

1148
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:50,859
now

1149
00:19:50,859 --> 00:19:52,140
you can either

1150
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:52,579
tell Claude

1151
00:19:52,579 --> 00:19:53,380
or redesign it

1152
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:53,819
if you want

1153
00:19:53,819 --> 00:19:54,740
a different design

1154
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,589
you can expand

1155
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:56,240
on more sections

1156
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,539
or simply use

1157
00:19:57,539 --> 00:19:58,279
what it outputs

1158
00:19:58,279 --> 00:19:58,900
in order to manually

1159
00:19:58,900 --> 00:19:59,660
create your own

1160
00:19:59,660 --> 00:19:59,859
something

1161
00:19:59,859 --> 00:20:00,180
so like

1162
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:01,940
you can take

1163
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:02,519
what is here

1164
00:20:03,009 --> 00:20:04,359
and use something

1165
00:20:04,359 --> 00:20:04,940
like Miro

1166
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:05,779
or Funalytics

1167
00:20:05,779 --> 00:20:06,539
or Lucidchart

1168
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:07,059
just to like

1169
00:20:07,549 --> 00:20:08,920
manually redesign it

1170
00:20:09,019 --> 00:20:09,859
so it's not like

1171
00:20:10,349 --> 00:20:10,519
so

1172
00:20:10,519 --> 00:20:12,119
you get what I'm saying

1173
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:12,849
like you can just

1174
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,400
fuck with it

1175
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:13,579
right

1176
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:14,019
but you need

1177
00:20:14,019 --> 00:20:14,539
some kind of

1178
00:20:14,539 --> 00:20:15,839
graphical representation

1179
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:16,619
that shows people

1180
00:20:16,619 --> 00:20:17,759
like the flow

1181
00:20:17,819 --> 00:20:18,599
of what is occurring

1182
00:20:18,599 --> 00:20:18,940
right

1183
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:19,400
so

1184
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:20,119
next

1185
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:20,470
is

1186
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,200
the next section

1187
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:21,500
that you do

1188
00:20:21,579 --> 00:20:22,039
in the VSL

1189
00:20:22,039 --> 00:20:22,880
is what deliverables

1190
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:23,420
your offer includes

1191
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:24,000
so this is the part

1192
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:24,710
where you basically say

1193
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,670
so what exactly

1194
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:26,450
is including this offer

1195
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:26,920
keep in mind

1196
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:27,240
what you've done

1197
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:27,579
at this point

1198
00:20:27,579 --> 00:20:27,930
is fine

1199
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,200
you've made

1200
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:30,160
first is that

1201
00:20:30,259 --> 00:20:30,500
you've made

1202
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,039
a big fat claim

1203
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:31,640
there's all they can get

1204
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,589
or lay your dick

1205
00:20:32,619 --> 00:20:34,420
on the table

1206
00:20:34,819 --> 00:20:34,819
headline

1207
00:20:34,819 --> 00:20:35,500
or you've made

1208
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,400
a clear direct headline

1209
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:36,759
just stating

1210
00:20:36,759 --> 00:20:37,160
what you can do

1211
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:37,460
for them

1212
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:39,259
two is that

1213
00:20:39,259 --> 00:20:39,740
you explained

1214
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:40,599
how either you have

1215
00:20:40,599 --> 00:20:41,140
or other people

1216
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:41,779
have gotten results

1217
00:20:41,779 --> 00:20:42,380
doing this thing

1218
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:42,700
three

1219
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:43,799
you use raw math

1220
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:44,619
to visually show them

1221
00:20:44,619 --> 00:20:45,220
what kind of metrics

1222
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:45,880
are possible to get

1223
00:20:46,619 --> 00:20:47,240
you graphically

1224
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,099
or visually show them

1225
00:20:48,099 --> 00:20:48,759
everything that's evolved

1226
00:20:48,759 --> 00:20:49,240
in the offer

1227
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,809
and ideally made it

1228
00:20:50,819 --> 00:20:52,259
as complicated sounding

1229
00:20:52,259 --> 00:20:52,759
as possible

1230
00:20:52,759 --> 00:20:53,599
and really really really

1231
00:20:53,609 --> 00:20:54,289
explained how many

1232
00:20:54,299 --> 00:20:55,250
moving pieces there are

1233
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:56,559
and that you're going

1234
00:20:56,579 --> 00:20:56,880
to handle

1235
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,099
so

1236
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:58,799
now for the final act

1237
00:20:58,799 --> 00:20:59,940
you will tell them this

1238
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:00,619
all those pieces

1239
00:21:00,619 --> 00:21:01,319
I just explained

1240
00:21:01,319 --> 00:21:02,160
all of that

1241
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,019
is part of this offer

1242
00:21:03,019 --> 00:21:03,500
you get this

1243
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,210
this this this this

1244
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:04,900
this this this

1245
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:05,849
this all done for you

1246
00:21:05,859 --> 00:21:07,119
all you do is this

1247
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:07,829
I do everything else

1248
00:21:07,859 --> 00:21:09,259
you get what I'm saying

1249
00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:10,430
exactly like I talk about

1250
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,099
in the

1251
00:21:11,099 --> 00:21:11,759
how to sell

1252
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:12,710
high ticket packages video

1253
00:21:12,779 --> 00:21:13,359
so CTA

1254
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:14,240
this is where you ask them

1255
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:14,779
to get on the phone

1256
00:21:14,779 --> 00:21:16,079
it only really needs

1257
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:16,579
to be as simple

1258
00:21:16,579 --> 00:21:17,140
as if you're interested

1259
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:17,680
in getting started

1260
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,599
click the button

1261
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:19,099
below this video

1262
00:21:19,099 --> 00:21:19,740
schedule and call

1263
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:20,299
with me directly

1264
00:21:20,299 --> 00:21:21,059
not a salesperson

1265
00:21:21,549 --> 00:21:22,859
we'll go

1266
00:21:22,859 --> 00:21:24,259
and I'm saying

1267
00:21:24,259 --> 00:21:24,990
not a salesperson

1268
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:25,759
if that's you doing it

1269
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:26,059
but if it is

1270
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:27,000
if they are going

1271
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:27,680
to talk to a salesperson

1272
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,440
don't fucking say that

1273
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:28,640
right

1274
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,779
we'll go through

1275
00:21:29,799 --> 00:21:30,279
what the metrics

1276
00:21:30,279 --> 00:21:30,779
and deliverables

1277
00:21:30,779 --> 00:21:31,200
will look like

1278
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,119
for your specific business

1279
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:33,500
how much I charge you

1280
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:33,920
and what

1281
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:34,660
what results

1282
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:34,940
I think

1283
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:36,079
are reasonable

1284
00:21:36,099 --> 00:21:36,579
for you to get

1285
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:37,259
FAQ

1286
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:38,210
now this is where

1287
00:21:38,279 --> 00:21:38,960
you'd simply answer

1288
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:39,619
the common question

1289
00:21:39,619 --> 00:21:40,480
objections people have

1290
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,720
the proper way

1291
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:42,259
to source these

1292
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:42,740
is by using

1293
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:44,220
recordings of call transcripts

1294
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:44,880
but you probably

1295
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,500
don't have those

1296
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,380
so you can use

1297
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:47,140
Claude, GPT

1298
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,279
or Manus

1299
00:21:48,299 --> 00:21:48,900
and take everything

1300
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:49,849
you've already written

1301
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,200
inside your GammaDoc VSL

1302
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:51,799
then use a prompt

1303
00:21:51,799 --> 00:21:52,240
like this

1304
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,829
I'm making a section

1305
00:21:54,329 --> 00:21:55,599
VSL for the FAQ

1306
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:56,220
I need to figure out

1307
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:56,660
what the common

1308
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:57,259
objections and questions

1309
00:21:57,259 --> 00:21:57,599
are going to be

1310
00:21:57,599 --> 00:21:58,099
the target market

1311
00:21:58,099 --> 00:21:58,279
for this

1312
00:21:58,279 --> 00:21:58,859
are coaching consultants

1313
00:21:58,859 --> 00:21:59,359
selling high ticket

1314
00:21:59,359 --> 00:21:59,880
coaching packages

1315
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,230
so this is where

1316
00:22:00,259 --> 00:22:00,619
you put what

1317
00:22:00,619 --> 00:22:01,259
your niche is

1318
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,400
below and pasting

1319
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:03,900
all the information

1320
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,000
I have written

1321
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:05,710
for the VSL already

1322
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:06,380
please read all

1323
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:07,119
the information

1324
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:08,069
then through logic

1325
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,109
determine what you believe

1326
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:09,920
is the most probable

1327
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,819
to be the most integral

1328
00:22:10,819 --> 00:22:11,940
and highly asked questions

1329
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:12,890
that I will get

1330
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:13,859
on the call's pace

1331
00:22:13,859 --> 00:22:14,319
and then you get

1332
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:14,980
your output from there

1333
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:15,500
and then you have

1334
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,019
a giant list

1335
00:22:16,019 --> 00:22:17,359
of frequently asked questions

1336
00:22:17,859 --> 00:22:17,859
right

1337
00:22:18,349 --> 00:22:19,599
and yeah

1338
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:20,279
that's it

1339
00:22:20,279 --> 00:22:21,420
that's all the elements

1340
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:22,900
so what I'm going to do next

1341
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:23,589
is just show you

1342
00:22:23,599 --> 00:22:24,400
actual examples

1343
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:24,960
of VSL
