1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:01,860
Okay, so we're going to talk about

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:03,339
claims and guarantees.

3
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:05,750
So to close cold traffic, you need

4
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:08,000
a remarkability factor, right?

5
00:00:08,009 --> 00:00:09,019
Because market share works

6
00:00:09,019 --> 00:00:10,080
exponentially, right?

7
00:00:10,089 --> 00:00:11,740
So the people with the best offers

8
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:12,960
take all of the business

9
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:14,230
and leave basically nothing for

10
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:14,890
you, right?

11
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:16,100
So your job is to make an offer so

12
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:17,170
good that you leave nothing for

13
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:17,989
anybody else, right?

14
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:21,210
So these are arbitrary numbers, by

15
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:22,199
the way.

16
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:23,940
But let's say you have somebody

17
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,760
with an offer strength of one.

18
00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:27,230
They get fucking nothing, like

19
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:27,859
just zero.

20
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:29,059
The offer strength of two, it's

21
00:00:29,059 --> 00:00:29,809
like a little bit.

22
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:32,140
It's a double one, but it's still

23
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:32,969
nothing.

24
00:00:33,049 --> 00:00:34,719
And then three is double two, but

25
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:35,899
it's still nothing.

26
00:00:35,909 --> 00:00:36,990
Four is double three, but it's

27
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:37,700
still nothing.

28
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,149
Five is double four, but now

29
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:40,549
you're starting to getting

30
00:00:40,549 --> 00:00:41,340
somewhere.

31
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:43,259
Six is substantially more and

32
00:00:43,259 --> 00:00:45,679
seven is also substantially more.

33
00:00:45,689 --> 00:00:46,359
You know what I'm saying?

34
00:00:46,369 --> 00:00:48,310
But like no one's making any money

35
00:00:48,429 --> 00:00:50,229
or getting fucking rich at all

36
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:51,340
until six and seven.

37
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:53,280
Like it's just so fucking useless

38
00:00:53,409 --> 00:00:55,210
to have an offer that's like one,

39
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:57,079
two, three, four, or five.

40
00:00:57,329 --> 00:00:59,009
You might as well just fucking

41
00:00:59,009 --> 00:01:00,920
quit the business and go get a job

42
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,049
and just stop doing this.

43
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:05,040
There's literally no point at all.

44
00:01:05,049 --> 00:01:06,769
And now you're probably wondering

45
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:08,390
at this point, well, what

46
00:01:08,409 --> 00:01:10,780
determines what is the strength of

47
00:01:10,849 --> 00:01:11,079
an offer?

48
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:12,239
And the answer is the claim and

49
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:13,680
the guarantee that you have on it.

50
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:15,670
Now, I don't want to say that as

51
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:17,340
an absolute because you can have a

52
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:18,879
really good offer with no claim

53
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:19,719
and with no guarantee.

54
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:21,489
But the only situation that that

55
00:01:21,489 --> 00:01:22,959
is ever going to be the case is if

56
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:25,329
you are selling something that is

57
00:01:25,329 --> 00:01:27,540
truly, insanely fucking

58
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,730
remarkable.

59
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:30,680
And it's like, it's just, you

60
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:32,609
probably don't have that.

61
00:01:32,709 --> 00:01:34,060
You just don't, right?

62
00:01:34,129 --> 00:01:35,500
I mean like really like

63
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,599
revolutionary type like tech that

64
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:39,829
you, proprietary shit that you've

65
00:01:39,829 --> 00:01:40,579
developed, right?

66
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:42,109
It's just, you probably just don't

67
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,120
have that, right?

68
00:01:43,129 --> 00:01:45,180
So the answer for you is it's a

69
00:01:45,189 --> 00:01:47,689
claim and a guarantee, right?

70
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:48,659
So if your offer in business is

71
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:49,670
not remarkable enough, you don't

72
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:50,159
get scraps.

73
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:52,359
You need every single one of all

74
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:54,359
the variables for amplified

75
00:01:54,409 --> 00:01:55,319
returns.

76
00:01:55,329 --> 00:01:56,290
If your offer is not absolutely

77
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:57,260
remarkable, pretty much zero

78
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:57,879
people buy it.

79
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:00,010
So how do I know if my offer is

80
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:00,969
working?

81
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:02,400
You will know, right?

82
00:02:02,409 --> 00:02:03,459
You will be getting hello

83
00:02:03,459 --> 00:02:04,099
responses.

84
00:02:04,109 --> 00:02:05,409
So people will be getting on calls

85
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:05,980
with you.

86
00:02:05,989 --> 00:02:07,310
It will be extremely obvious if

87
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:08,400
you have a good offer.

88
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:09,740
If it feels like you need to climb

89
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:11,080
a mountain and run three marathons

90
00:02:11,139 --> 00:02:12,349
just to get a single person on the

91
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,280
phone, your offer is not good,

92
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,080
right?

93
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:16,560
Your offer needs to be better if

94
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,520
that is the case.

95
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:18,780
Just like how you ask the

96
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:21,389
question, does he or she like me?

97
00:02:21,469 --> 00:02:22,370
Are they into me?

98
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:24,550
Brother, you will know if she's

99
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:25,460
into you.

100
00:02:25,469 --> 00:02:26,879
Like if you're confused, she

101
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:27,409
doesn't.

102
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:29,259
Like you will know, right?

103
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:30,639
If you're getting mixed signals

104
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:32,120
from the market, the market isn't

105
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,110
into you, right?

106
00:02:33,129 --> 00:02:34,009
And you need to change.

107
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:35,520
It's really that simple, right?

108
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:36,770
You'll fucking know if the offer

109
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:37,599
is working or not.

110
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:39,599
If you're not sure or if it

111
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,810
doesn't feel like it is, then your

112
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,300
offer isn't good.

113
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:44,210
You need to up the claim.

114
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:45,270
You need to up the guarantee if

115
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:46,210
you don't have a shit ton of case

116
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:47,060
studies, right?

117
00:02:47,069 --> 00:02:48,590
So a formulation of an offer

118
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:50,439
contains three components.

119
00:02:50,449 --> 00:02:51,939
Claim, what result will they get?

120
00:02:51,949 --> 00:02:52,770
Guarantee, what if it doesn't

121
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:53,080
work?

122
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:53,539
What happens?

123
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:54,819
Evidence, who else has it worked

124
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:55,469
for, right?

125
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:56,340
And evidence is case studies.

126
00:02:56,349 --> 00:02:58,159
So this is the logical flow that

127
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:59,689
prospects ask in that exact

128
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:01,039
sequence, right?

129
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:03,139
First they ask, what results will

130
00:03:03,139 --> 00:03:03,639
I get?

131
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:05,189
And then they ask themselves,

132
00:03:05,189 --> 00:03:06,539
well, what if I don't get the

133
00:03:06,539 --> 00:03:07,180
result?

134
00:03:07,189 --> 00:03:07,680
What happens?

135
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,280
And then they ask, well, who else

136
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:10,240
has it worked for?

137
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:12,229
That's literally in the exact

138
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:14,360
sequence of what happens in their

139
00:03:14,409 --> 00:03:15,000
head.

140
00:03:15,009 --> 00:03:16,340
So if you have no evidence, it is

141
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:17,699
required to have both a claim and

142
00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:18,319
guarantee.

143
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:20,060
If you have evidence, and I mean

144
00:03:20,069 --> 00:03:21,900
like extreme evidence, like you

145
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,509
have like a fucking shit ton of

146
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,289
case studies, you can remove the

147
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:26,759
guarantee, right?

148
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:28,250
So here's just an example of a

149
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,849
content agency of what I call the

150
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,740
claim timeline or like the results

151
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:32,080
timeline.

152
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:33,530
So you got to imagine what's

153
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:34,919
happening here is, is let's say

154
00:03:34,979 --> 00:03:36,500
that you produce videos for people

155
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,759
and you have a left side of the

156
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,250
timeline and you have a right side

157
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,759
of the timeline, right?

158
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:42,659
On the left side of the timeline,

159
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:44,310
there's the actual deliverable,

160
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:45,789
like the thing that you give the

161
00:03:45,789 --> 00:03:47,310
clients, which is the videos,

162
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:47,900
right?

163
00:03:47,909 --> 00:03:49,449
That's the thing that technically

164
00:03:49,509 --> 00:03:50,740
the thing they bought is the

165
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:51,659
videos, right?

166
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:54,259
But you got to ask yourself, why

167
00:03:54,389 --> 00:03:55,939
do clients want a video?

168
00:03:55,949 --> 00:03:57,120
What is the purpose of a video?

169
00:03:57,129 --> 00:03:58,020
The purpose of a video is to get

170
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:58,379
views.

171
00:03:58,389 --> 00:03:59,159
Well, what is the purpose of

172
00:03:59,159 --> 00:03:59,479
views?

173
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:00,099
Why do you want views?

174
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:00,919
The purpose of that is to get

175
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:01,389
followers.

176
00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:02,430
Well, why do I want followers?

177
00:04:02,449 --> 00:04:03,349
What is the purpose of followers?

178
00:04:03,389 --> 00:04:04,379
It's to get leads.

179
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:06,699
What is the purpose of leads?

180
00:04:06,729 --> 00:04:07,840
It's to get sales calls.

181
00:04:07,849 --> 00:04:09,139
What's the purpose of sales calls?

182
00:04:09,189 --> 00:04:10,210
It's to get clients, right?

183
00:04:10,229 --> 00:04:11,509
So if you're on the left side of

184
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,180
the timeline, you're a service.

185
00:04:13,189 --> 00:04:15,419
So I will give you videos.

186
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:16,819
You're a service, right?

187
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:17,730
If you're on the right side of the

188
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:18,680
timeline, you are an offer.

189
00:04:18,689 --> 00:04:20,060
I will give you X amount of views.

190
00:04:20,069 --> 00:04:20,800
It's an offer.

191
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:21,970
I'll give you X amount of sales

192
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:22,420
calls.

193
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,040
I'll give you an offer.

194
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:24,509
I'll guarantee you sign X amount

195
00:04:24,509 --> 00:04:25,240
of clients.

196
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:26,500
That's an offer, right?

197
00:04:26,509 --> 00:04:28,240
You only sell your stuff to cold

198
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,000
traffic.

199
00:04:29,009 --> 00:04:30,170
The only way to sell your stuff to

200
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:31,360
cold traffic is if you promise to

201
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,089
end result in any of the

202
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:33,259
dimensions listed above.

203
00:04:33,529 --> 00:04:35,410
So you can take any one of these,

204
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:37,389
slap a specific number behind it,

205
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:38,879
slap a guarantee behind them

206
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:40,720
hitting that specific amount, and

207
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,459
then that's an offer.

208
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:43,370
You get what I'm saying?

209
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:45,079
But what you're going to do is

210
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:47,040
say, well, I'll guarantee them

211
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,569
views then because I can't

212
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,300
guarantee them clients.

213
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:51,629
Okay, well, now your offer's

214
00:04:51,629 --> 00:04:53,050
shitty because more people will

215
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:54,569
guarantee views, and you have more

216
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:56,009
competition now, and it's not as

217
00:04:56,009 --> 00:04:57,269
attractive of an offer.

218
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:58,120
So what does that mean?

219
00:04:58,129 --> 00:04:59,649
It means that if you try to make

220
00:04:59,649 --> 00:05:01,360
an offer and you're guaranteeing

221
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,689
views, it might be in your

222
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:04,550
specific offer that you're selling

223
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,089
to your specific niche that no

224
00:05:06,089 --> 00:05:07,939
one's booking a call with you.

225
00:05:07,949 --> 00:05:09,089
And you're like, well, Daniel, I

226
00:05:09,089 --> 00:05:09,819
did what you said.

227
00:05:09,829 --> 00:05:10,319
It's not working.

228
00:05:10,329 --> 00:05:11,449
It's like, no, because you're

229
00:05:11,449 --> 00:05:12,470
being a fucking pussy and not

230
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,699
laying your dick on the table.

231
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,990
It's like, the views aren't

232
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:18,600
fucking good enough, right?

233
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,290
So maybe you need to guarantee

234
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:20,860
leads.

235
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:22,100
Maybe you need to guarantee sales

236
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:22,500
calls.

237
00:05:22,509 --> 00:05:23,420
Maybe you need to guarantee

238
00:05:23,459 --> 00:05:23,879
clients.

239
00:05:23,889 --> 00:05:26,319
Just guarantee clients, right?

240
00:05:26,329 --> 00:05:27,470
Just guarantee clients and

241
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:28,269
guarantee calls.

242
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:29,389
Like, it's going to fucking work

243
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:29,819
better.

244
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:30,379
You get what I'm saying?

245
00:05:30,389 --> 00:05:31,800
Like, there's this concept called

246
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,370
market sophistication where, like,

247
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:34,870
markets have been sold something.

248
00:05:34,949 --> 00:05:36,360
Like, people have already been

249
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,259
promised views.

250
00:05:37,269 --> 00:05:38,000
Maybe they've already been

251
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,550
promised leads.

252
00:05:38,569 --> 00:05:39,379
They've been promised calls.

253
00:05:39,389 --> 00:05:42,759
Like, if you promise them clients,

254
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:45,120
you book fucking so many more

255
00:05:45,899 --> 00:05:46,339
calls.

256
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:48,420
Like, so fucking many more.

257
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:50,189
Like, a fucking retarded amount

258
00:05:50,189 --> 00:05:51,509
more clients, right?

259
00:05:51,589 --> 00:05:53,420
But now what you're asking is,

260
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:56,279
Daniel, well, what if the client

261
00:05:56,279 --> 00:05:59,040
fucks up the sales calls and can't

262
00:05:59,129 --> 00:06:00,459
close clients themselves?

263
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:01,459
Then I'm stuck giving them a

264
00:06:01,459 --> 00:06:02,639
refund because they can't close

265
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:03,160
clients.

266
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:04,259
Yes, correct.

267
00:06:04,269 --> 00:06:06,339
That's why we use what are called

268
00:06:06,339 --> 00:06:08,129
stipulations inside of your

269
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:09,160
contract.

270
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:09,759
What does that mean?

271
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:12,100
If you're guaranteeing clients,

272
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,939
you stipulate that they are

273
00:06:13,939 --> 00:06:15,670
closing the sales calls.

274
00:06:15,889 --> 00:06:17,240
And if they aren't closing the

275
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,910
sales calls, they're not eligible

276
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:20,060
to request a refund.

277
00:06:20,069 --> 00:06:22,420
You get what I'm saying?

278
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:24,740
Like, that's what you do.

279
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:27,069
You eliminate the possibility of

280
00:06:27,069 --> 00:06:29,019
the client fucking it up.

281
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:31,519
That's what you do, right?

282
00:06:31,529 --> 00:06:33,149
And we'll talk more about that

283
00:06:33,149 --> 00:06:34,610
towards the end of this.

284
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:37,240
But let's continue on.

285
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:38,459
So the only way to sell is to have

286
00:06:38,459 --> 00:06:39,519
a remarkability factor.

287
00:06:39,529 --> 00:06:40,430
Remarkability can be interchanged

288
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,449
with, like, differentiation.

289
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:42,670
So let's take something happening

290
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:43,649
in the market right now at the

291
00:06:43,649 --> 00:06:44,850
time this is filming, right?

292
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:46,120
You can now train an AI on your

293
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,560
voice and face to automatically

294
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,730
create hundreds of pieces of

295
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:50,439
content in an instant, right?

296
00:06:50,529 --> 00:06:51,329
You do not need to memorize

297
00:06:51,329 --> 00:06:52,459
scripts, get on camera, spend time

298
00:06:52,589 --> 00:06:53,610
recording, or manage editors.

299
00:06:53,649 --> 00:06:54,670
You can post two or three clips

300
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:55,959
per day without doing anything.

301
00:06:56,189 --> 00:06:57,069
This is the definition of

302
00:06:57,079 --> 00:06:58,540
remarkable and different, right?

303
00:06:58,550 --> 00:06:59,699
So now if you approach a client

304
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:01,360
and you say some shit, like, hey,

305
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:03,560
I can produce three pieces of

306
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:06,209
short form content for you per day

307
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:07,519
and you never even have to get on

308
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,870
camera or memorize scripts or do

309
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:09,480
anything.

310
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:10,860
I can just train an AI to look

311
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,569
exactly like you and sound exactly

312
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:14,160
like you and mass produce clips

313
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,230
and post them for you.

314
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:18,509
They're like, yo, that's fucking

315
00:07:18,509 --> 00:07:19,240
crazy.

316
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:20,129
That's insane.

317
00:07:20,149 --> 00:07:21,339
Like, I didn't know you could do

318
00:07:21,339 --> 00:07:21,670
that.

319
00:07:21,689 --> 00:07:23,040
That's so wild, right?

320
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:23,949
And they're like, fuck, yeah, let

321
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,629
me hear more about it.

322
00:07:24,649 --> 00:07:25,019
Okay.

323
00:07:25,029 --> 00:07:26,490
But in two years from the time of

324
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:28,110
this filming, that's not going to

325
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,750
be the reaction anymore because

326
00:07:29,829 --> 00:07:31,000
that is going to be a widely

327
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:32,769
fucking executed thing.

328
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:34,300
And shit tons of people will have

329
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,720
fucking sold that to them.

330
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:36,610
That's called market

331
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:37,839
sophistication, right?

332
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:38,839
So now what do you have to do at

333
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:39,430
that point?

334
00:07:39,449 --> 00:07:42,040
That remarkability factor is gone.

335
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:43,569
So now what do you have to do?

336
00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:45,170
You have to fucking promise them

337
00:07:45,189 --> 00:07:45,920
the result.

338
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:47,019
It's the only way.

339
00:07:47,029 --> 00:07:47,579
You get what I'm saying?

340
00:07:47,589 --> 00:07:49,889
Like, it all loops back around to

341
00:07:49,889 --> 00:07:52,310
promising the result, right?

342
00:07:52,329 --> 00:07:54,250
So your mistake will be to assume

343
00:07:54,259 --> 00:07:56,480
that you're solving, like, a super

344
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,319
fucking wildly huge problem.

345
00:07:58,329 --> 00:07:59,480
And you're going to assume that

346
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,839
your deliverable is, like, super

347
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:01,410
remarkable.

348
00:08:01,709 --> 00:08:03,100
Like, what you have is, like,

349
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,540
profoundly revolutionary.

350
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:05,980
I fucking promise you

351
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:10,230
99.99999999999% of you do not

352
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:12,230
fucking have a product that is

353
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:14,300
remarkable enough to not have a

354
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:15,439
guarantee.

355
00:08:15,449 --> 00:08:16,879
I promise you that.

356
00:08:16,889 --> 00:08:18,579
I absolutely promise you that.

357
00:08:18,589 --> 00:08:20,509
So how do I make my offer

358
00:08:20,649 --> 00:08:21,819
different?

359
00:08:21,829 --> 00:08:22,139
Okay.

360
00:08:22,149 --> 00:08:23,689
By having something that is

361
00:08:23,689 --> 00:08:25,439
genuinely different, but you

362
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:27,459
probably aren't different because

363
00:08:27,459 --> 00:08:29,339
not everybody can be different,

364
00:08:29,339 --> 00:08:30,019
right?

365
00:08:30,029 --> 00:08:31,329
So what 99% of you are selling

366
00:08:31,329 --> 00:08:32,259
isn't different.

367
00:08:32,269 --> 00:08:33,168
It's not remarkable.

368
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:34,399
Like, you're selling it like a

369
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:35,720
cold email lead gen agency.

370
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:36,740
Like, congratulations.

371
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,840
You're the fucking 10,000th person

372
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,480
to do that.

373
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:40,840
Or you're making an ad agency.

374
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:41,399
Congratulations.

375
00:08:41,408 --> 00:08:43,179
You're the fucking 50,000th person

376
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:43,720
to do that.

377
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:44,820
Like, it's like, no.

378
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:45,850
Like, you're not fucking

379
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:46,480
different.

380
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:47,620
Like, you're not remarkable.

381
00:08:47,629 --> 00:08:48,139
You know what I'm saying?

382
00:08:48,149 --> 00:08:50,080
You have to have the guarantee.

383
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:51,320
You fucking have to.

384
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:53,159
It's the only way.

385
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:55,220
It's the only way that this is

386
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:56,419
going to work for you.

387
00:08:56,429 --> 00:08:58,240
So you need to do it, right?

388
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:00,110
If you have something genuinely

389
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:02,299
remarkable, absolutely profound,

390
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:04,419
indisputably revolutionary, then

391
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:05,399
you wouldn't need to promise

392
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:05,850
results.

393
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:06,340
But you don't.

394
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:07,480
So you do need to promise results.

395
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:08,389
And the sooner you come to grips

396
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,419
with this, and just listen to what

397
00:09:09,539 --> 00:09:10,570
I'm telling you to do, the faster

398
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:11,350
you're going to succeed in your

399
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:11,970
business, right?

400
00:09:14,149 --> 00:09:15,690
I think I said this in the last

401
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,470
video, but this whole idea of,

402
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:19,429
like, me sitting here and, like,

403
00:09:19,429 --> 00:09:21,120
trying to get you to understand

404
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:23,220
that you have to do this, you,

405
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:25,919
too, are going to have to do this

406
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:27,559
to your clients.

407
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:30,080
Because most of your clients are

408
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,679
going to have dog shit offers that

409
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:34,799
are not going to be able to be

410
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:37,399
sold unless they have a promise of

411
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:38,850
a result on it.

412
00:09:38,909 --> 00:09:39,500
You get what I'm saying?

413
00:09:39,509 --> 00:09:42,570
Like, that's what I'm trying to

414
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:43,299
get.

415
00:09:43,389 --> 00:09:45,649
So, like, I'm being so forceful in

416
00:09:45,649 --> 00:09:47,870
explaining this to you because you

417
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,409
need to understand it so

418
00:09:49,899 --> 00:09:51,710
thoroughly that you, too, will be

419
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:54,139
able to teach it to other people.

420
00:09:54,149 --> 00:09:54,879
You get what I'm saying?

421
00:09:54,889 --> 00:09:55,769
So, like, all right, let's just

422
00:09:55,779 --> 00:09:56,700
walk through some examples.

423
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:58,000
A million views guaranteed.

424
00:09:58,049 --> 00:09:58,929
That's an offer.

425
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:00,320
10,000 new followers guaranteed.

426
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:00,899
That's an offer.

427
00:10:00,909 --> 00:10:01,919
1,000 new leads guaranteed.

428
00:10:01,929 --> 00:10:02,480
That's an offer.

429
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:04,039
100 sales calls book guaranteed.

430
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,860
10 new clients guaranteed.

431
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:06,620
That's an offer, right?

432
00:10:06,629 --> 00:10:07,710
And that's just going from this

433
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:08,820
little timeline over here.

434
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:10,519
So, which of these sounds more

435
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:11,419
attractive?

436
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:13,059
Okay, of these.

437
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:13,970
Which of these sounds more

438
00:10:14,019 --> 00:10:15,129
attractive to you if I offered to

439
00:10:15,129 --> 00:10:15,799
you right now?

440
00:10:15,809 --> 00:10:17,330
Which would you personally have

441
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:19,179
the highest probability of buying?

442
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:20,879
If I gave you, right now, you

443
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:23,269
watching this video, fucking which

444
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:25,440
one of these would you buy?

445
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:29,720
Don't bullshit me.

446
00:10:31,149 --> 00:10:32,850
Because the answer is obviously

447
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:33,539
this one.

448
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:34,990
It's the 10 new clients

449
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:36,320
guaranteed, right?

450
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:40,460
So, what makes you think that the

451
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:43,549
people you're selling to are

452
00:10:43,549 --> 00:10:46,049
different than you?

453
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:47,629
Right?

454
00:10:47,649 --> 00:10:49,590
There's this saying by this famous

455
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:50,639
copywriter.

456
00:10:50,649 --> 00:10:51,659
He goes,

457
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,190
The prospect isn't stupid.

458
00:10:55,289 --> 00:10:56,679
She's your mother.

459
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:59,580
What is he saying there?

460
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:01,909
Like, for you to assume the

461
00:11:01,909 --> 00:11:05,080
prospect is so fucking dumb that

462
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:08,309
they are not in the market right

463
00:11:08,309 --> 00:11:10,740
now actively choosing this offer

464
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,480
over this one or this one or this

465
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,509
one or this one.

466
00:11:14,649 --> 00:11:16,320
That's like the equivalent of you

467
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,730
thinking your mom is a fucking

468
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,389
retard.

469
00:11:18,409 --> 00:11:21,210
Like, the prospect is your mom.

470
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:22,769
Like, they're not fucking stupid.

471
00:11:22,789 --> 00:11:23,879
They're the same as you.

472
00:11:23,889 --> 00:11:25,279
Like, obviously, they would want

473
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:25,779
this one.

474
00:11:26,149 --> 00:11:28,269
And, in fact, they're in the

475
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,809
market right now buying this offer

476
00:11:30,809 --> 00:11:33,240
at 45 times the rate than your

477
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,360
offer, like, over here.

478
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:37,409
You get what I'm saying?

479
00:11:38,129 --> 00:11:40,960
Like, they're already buying this

480
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,279
45 times more than they're buying

481
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,909
yours up here or here or here or

482
00:11:45,909 --> 00:11:46,570
here.

483
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:49,490
Like, the guy selling this is

484
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:51,929
making a fucking shit ton more

485
00:11:51,929 --> 00:11:53,490
money than you.

486
00:11:53,509 --> 00:11:56,360
Like, a fucking lot, lot more

487
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,990
money than you.

488
00:11:58,070 --> 00:11:58,340
Right?

489
00:11:58,350 --> 00:11:59,159
So, okay.

490
00:11:59,169 --> 00:12:00,889
You need to promise a quantifiable

491
00:12:00,899 --> 00:12:01,860
end result or have a

492
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,730
differentiating value proposition

493
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:05,519
genuinely, actually unique.

494
00:12:05,529 --> 00:12:07,279
So, quantifiable end results.

495
00:12:07,289 --> 00:12:08,230
What exactly am I getting when I

496
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:08,799
work with you?

497
00:12:08,809 --> 00:12:09,970
What results are you claiming that

498
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:10,620
I'm able to get?

499
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:11,509
People are only concerned with

500
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:12,039
what they get.

501
00:12:12,049 --> 00:12:13,200
Nobody buys video editing.

502
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:14,860
Nobody even buys videos.

503
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:15,879
They buy the result the videos are

504
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:16,799
intended to produce for them.

505
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:17,580
Nobody buys emails.

506
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:18,789
They buy the result the emails are

507
00:12:18,789 --> 00:12:20,179
intended to get them, etc., etc.

508
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:21,789
The same exact thing for every

509
00:12:21,799 --> 00:12:23,480
service you'll ever sell in your

510
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:23,929
life.

511
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:26,909
It's actually the same exact thing

512
00:12:26,909 --> 00:12:28,379
for anything.

513
00:12:28,389 --> 00:12:31,100
For anything at all in your life.

514
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:32,899
Like, if you buy a fucking banana

515
00:12:32,899 --> 00:12:34,789
at the grocery store, you're not

516
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,059
buying a banana.

517
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:37,570
You're buying a cessation of

518
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:39,399
hunger and the ability to continue

519
00:12:39,409 --> 00:12:40,259
surviving.

520
00:12:40,269 --> 00:12:42,059
That's what you're buying.

521
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:44,720
That's why the most commonly sold

522
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,970
product on the entire planet is

523
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:47,740
water.

524
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,139
You know what I'm saying?

525
00:12:49,149 --> 00:12:50,879
Because if you go two days without

526
00:12:50,889 --> 00:12:52,200
it, you fucking die.

527
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:54,519
Like, and then the next commonly

528
00:12:54,519 --> 00:12:57,080
sold product in the world is food.

529
00:12:57,090 --> 00:12:58,059
Okay, cool.

530
00:12:58,070 --> 00:12:59,519
What's next?

531
00:13:00,169 --> 00:13:00,809
Housing.

532
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:01,730
Right?

533
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:02,879
Can't be homeless.

534
00:13:02,889 --> 00:13:03,740
What's next?

535
00:13:04,389 --> 00:13:04,940
Transportation.

536
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:05,620
Right?

537
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:08,700
It's like, because, like, do I buy

538
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:11,019
a plane ticket because I like

539
00:13:11,019 --> 00:13:12,870
being on the plane?

540
00:13:12,889 --> 00:13:13,789
Fuck no.

541
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:14,820
Fuck planes.

542
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:16,629
I would never step on a plane ever

543
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,480
again in my fucking life if it

544
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,539
wasn't transporting me to a

545
00:13:21,539 --> 00:13:22,950
different spot.

546
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:24,539
Like, that's the whole fucking

547
00:13:24,539 --> 00:13:25,379
point of the day.

548
00:13:25,389 --> 00:13:26,409
Like, you know what I'm saying?

549
00:13:26,429 --> 00:13:28,039
Like, everything has an end

550
00:13:28,039 --> 00:13:28,720
result.

551
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:31,330
Nothing is ever bought beyond

552
00:13:31,379 --> 00:13:33,899
getting to the end result.

553
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:35,379
That's why when an airline

554
00:13:35,379 --> 00:13:37,230
advertises, they advertise the

555
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:38,940
destination, not the fucking

556
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:39,559
plane.

557
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:40,200
You get what I'm saying?

558
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:43,409
Like, when you're trying to sell

559
00:13:43,409 --> 00:13:46,519
emails or fucking, or videos,

560
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:49,639
like, I do video editing, that's

561
00:13:49,669 --> 00:13:51,500
the equivalent of being, like,

562
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,559
United Airlines and being, like,

563
00:13:53,559 --> 00:13:55,259
this is our plane.

564
00:13:55,269 --> 00:13:56,919
Look at the inside of our plane.

565
00:13:56,929 --> 00:13:58,220
This is how fast the plane goes.

566
00:13:58,250 --> 00:13:59,269
This is how high the plane goes.

567
00:13:59,289 --> 00:14:00,309
This is the fuel efficiency of the

568
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:00,679
plane.

569
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:02,809
How, why the fuck does a consumer

570
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:04,450
give a shit about the fuel

571
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:06,299
efficiency of the plane?

572
00:14:06,309 --> 00:14:07,600
No, they give a fuck about the

573
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:08,429
destination.

574
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:09,350
Is it Cancun?

575
00:14:09,409 --> 00:14:11,350
Is it fucking London?

576
00:14:11,409 --> 00:14:12,289
You get what I'm saying?

577
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:14,250
So, all right, cool.

578
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:15,379
Quantifiable end results come in

579
00:14:15,379 --> 00:14:16,019
destinations.

580
00:14:16,029 --> 00:14:17,139
So, for instance, let's say you're

581
00:14:17,139 --> 00:14:17,799
a content agency.

582
00:14:17,809 --> 00:14:18,710
You sell scripted and edited

583
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:19,179
content.

584
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:19,889
You need to ask yourself the

585
00:14:19,899 --> 00:14:20,820
question, why would somebody buy

586
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:21,379
videos from me?

587
00:14:21,389 --> 00:14:23,320
They would do so for any of these

588
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:24,179
reasons.

589
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:25,730
Views, followers, leads, sales

590
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:27,000
calls, books, and sales and

591
00:14:27,009 --> 00:14:27,980
revenue, right?

592
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:29,350
So, to create a quantifiable end

593
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:30,769
result for your service, you pick

594
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:31,850
any of these dimensions.

595
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:32,779
You put a number on it.

596
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:35,240
Million views, 90 days guaranteed.

597
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,659
But, Daniel, I can't promise

598
00:14:36,659 --> 00:14:38,049
somebody a million views.

599
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,690
Yes, you can if you do what is

600
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:41,519
required to get one million views.

601
00:14:41,529 --> 00:14:42,720
And you contractually require the

602
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,840
client to do what is necessary to

603
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,960
get one million views in the first

604
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:45,200
place.

605
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:47,000
You use stipulations.

606
00:14:47,009 --> 00:14:48,549
I will explain what these are

607
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:49,519
momentarily.

608
00:14:49,529 --> 00:14:51,049
But, basically, you design

609
00:14:51,049 --> 00:14:52,610
contracts in such a way that the

610
00:14:52,649 --> 00:14:54,250
only way the result could ever be

611
00:14:54,309 --> 00:14:55,929
fucked up is if it's your fault,

612
00:14:56,049 --> 00:14:56,379
right?

613
00:14:56,429 --> 00:14:57,629
You completely eliminate the

614
00:14:57,629 --> 00:14:59,000
possibility that the client gets a

615
00:14:59,009 --> 00:15:00,240
refund if it's their fault they

616
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,720
didn't get the result, right?

617
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:03,279
So, I'm going to go over this real

618
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:04,669
quick and then we're going to

619
00:15:04,669 --> 00:15:06,700
start talking about stipulations.

620
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:08,279
So, the necessity of a guarantee

621
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:09,809
is inversely proportional with how

622
00:15:09,809 --> 00:15:11,059
many case studies and how much

623
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,389
quantifiable social proof you

624
00:15:12,389 --> 00:15:12,610
have.

625
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:14,620
So, I've got a little graph right

626
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:15,070
here.

627
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:16,080
You can zoom into it more if you

628
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:16,860
open the Gamma Doc.

629
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:18,580
The link is under this video.

630
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:20,100
But, the first question you ask

631
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,669
yourself is you're going to start

632
00:15:21,669 --> 00:15:23,039
with a specific problem.

633
00:15:23,049 --> 00:15:25,850
Are you solving a real problem for

634
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:26,789
a niche?

635
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:28,659
And, if the answer is no, then

636
00:15:28,659 --> 00:15:30,139
nothing you do will ever work,

637
00:15:30,139 --> 00:15:30,690
right?

638
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:31,850
Now, if the answer is yes, you

639
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:33,059
move on to the next question,

640
00:15:33,059 --> 00:15:33,929
which is, are you using a

641
00:15:33,929 --> 00:15:35,269
completely new and unheard of way

642
00:15:35,299 --> 00:15:35,879
to solve it?

643
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:37,559
If the answer is yes, you don't

644
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:39,029
really need a guarantee, but

645
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:40,669
you're definitely going to do a

646
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,659
fuck ton better with it, right?

647
00:15:42,669 --> 00:15:43,850
Okay, now let's say the answer is

648
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:44,100
no.

649
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:44,940
That means you go to the next

650
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:45,370
question.

651
00:15:45,389 --> 00:15:47,330
Are you charging an abnormally low

652
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:49,059
amount of money, right?

653
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:50,519
If the answer is yes, you don't

654
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:52,090
really need one, but a guarantee

655
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:53,549
will help a fuck ton, right?

656
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:54,710
But, you shouldn't charge an

657
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:55,870
abnormally low amount of money

658
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:56,950
because then you don't fucking

659
00:15:57,029 --> 00:15:58,090
make any money, right?

660
00:15:58,110 --> 00:15:59,740
So, the answer to this question is

661
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:00,480
no, right?

662
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:02,389
Do you have quantifiable client

663
00:16:02,389 --> 00:16:03,080
results?

664
00:16:03,149 --> 00:16:04,559
Like a fuck ton of client results?

665
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:06,919
Like more than $500,000 of like

666
00:16:06,919 --> 00:16:08,620
pure profit made for clients?

667
00:16:08,649 --> 00:16:10,509
If yes, you can get away without a

668
00:16:10,509 --> 00:16:12,330
guarantee, but you're going to

669
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:14,139
grow a fuck load faster with it,

670
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:14,860
right?

671
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:16,580
Now, if the answer is less than

672
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:19,360
$100,000 that you made for clients

673
00:16:19,419 --> 00:16:21,039
or no, then you need a guarantee.

674
00:16:21,049 --> 00:16:22,759
Like 100% of the time.

675
00:16:23,309 --> 00:16:23,759
Does that make sense?

676
00:16:23,769 --> 00:16:26,370
So, types of guarantees from least

677
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:28,080
risky to most risky.

678
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:29,909
So, you have a performance basis,

679
00:16:29,909 --> 00:16:31,549
which means that like the client

680
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:33,090
pays as the result occurs.

681
00:16:33,129 --> 00:16:34,029
So, there's zero risk of the

682
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:34,419
client.

683
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:36,590
So, that would mean like, hey, I'm

684
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:39,129
going to do 100% performance-based

685
00:16:39,129 --> 00:16:40,570
lead generation for you

686
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:41,870
and you're going to only pay for

687
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:42,940
the calls that show up.

688
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:43,960
Like that would be a performance

689
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,889
basis type thing, right?

690
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:46,139
Then there's money back

691
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:46,889
guarantees.

692
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:48,169
So, that would mean the client

693
00:16:48,169 --> 00:16:49,379
gets refunded if they don't get

694
00:16:49,379 --> 00:16:50,019
the result.

695
00:16:50,029 --> 00:16:51,129
So, this is like a risk to the

696
00:16:51,129 --> 00:16:52,509
client that you might not refund,

697
00:16:52,509 --> 00:16:53,000
right?

698
00:16:53,009 --> 00:16:54,029
So, like you collect the money up

699
00:16:54,039 --> 00:16:54,929
front and the result doesn't

700
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:56,220
occur, then the client requests

701
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:56,870
the refund and you have to give

702
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:57,399
the refund, right?

703
00:16:57,409 --> 00:16:57,740
Okay.

704
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:58,990
So, now, however, let me walk

705
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:00,409
through just some examples because

706
00:17:00,409 --> 00:17:01,500
it's not like cut and dry

707
00:17:01,529 --> 00:17:01,860
like that.

708
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:03,799
You can mix and form different

709
00:17:03,929 --> 00:17:06,019
things in different ways and you

710
00:17:06,019 --> 00:17:08,059
can just fuck with anything and

711
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:10,000
any which way.

712
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:10,720
There's no rules.

713
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:11,630
You can do any fucking deal you

714
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,670
want with the client, right?

715
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:15,170
But, again, like going back to the

716
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,720
concept I've said before, like the

717
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,838
purpose of your headline

718
00:17:17,869 --> 00:17:19,109
and your offer is to get them on

719
00:17:19,109 --> 00:17:19,720
the phone.

720
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:21,338
That isn't actually what you end

721
00:17:21,338 --> 00:17:22,440
up selling people.

722
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:24,338
Like what you end up selling

723
00:17:24,338 --> 00:17:26,720
people ends up being super fucking

724
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,230
like custom to each individual

725
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:29,180
person.

726
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:30,559
That's what running an agency is.

727
00:17:30,569 --> 00:17:31,940
You don't have like defined

728
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:33,619
products where I only charge this

729
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:34,599
amount of money.

730
00:17:34,609 --> 00:17:35,630
That's what everyone pays.

731
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:36,980
That's literally never going to

732
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:38,400
fucking happen in your agency.

733
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:39,670
Don't do that, right?

734
00:17:39,789 --> 00:17:41,720
So, every fucking deal is going to

735
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:42,559
be custom.

736
00:17:42,569 --> 00:17:43,609
Like the contract terms are going

737
00:17:43,609 --> 00:17:44,109
to be custom.

738
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:46,319
Like people will negotiate shit.

739
00:17:46,329 --> 00:17:47,740
Sometimes they won't negotiate

740
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:48,160
shit.

741
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:49,430
You're going to quote different

742
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:50,759
prices to different people based

743
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:52,180
off what they're selling and what

744
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:53,160
kind of results you think are

745
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,000
possible as you get more

746
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:54,619
experience.

747
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:56,450
Like everything is all sorts of

748
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:58,490
different fuck all which different

749
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,109
ways.

750
00:17:59,150 --> 00:17:59,660
You get what I'm saying?

751
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:01,470
So, we're going to walk through

752
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:03,299
just four examples of like a cold

753
00:18:03,299 --> 00:18:04,390
email agency.

754
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:05,099
Okay.

755
00:18:05,109 --> 00:18:06,259
So, it's all cold email agent.

756
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:08,319
Every person charges a monthly

757
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:10,130
tech fee of $500 a month.

758
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:11,240
Now, okay.

759
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:12,440
So, let's talk about agency owner

760
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:12,740
one.

761
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:15,509
They charge a $2,000 setup fee

762
00:18:15,509 --> 00:18:18,029
plus $300 per call on top of the

763
00:18:18,029 --> 00:18:20,299
$500 a month tech fee.

764
00:18:20,309 --> 00:18:21,460
And they have zero guarantee.

765
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:23,390
Okay, cool.

766
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:24,660
Let's compare this to agency owner

767
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:25,240
number two.

768
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:26,789
They also have a $500 a month tech

769
00:18:26,789 --> 00:18:27,140
fee.

770
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:29,809
There's a $2,000 setup plus $300

771
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:30,779
cost per call.

772
00:18:30,789 --> 00:18:31,079
Right?

773
00:18:31,089 --> 00:18:31,740
So, same as this.

774
00:18:31,869 --> 00:18:33,799
But, if you don't sign $15,000 in

775
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:35,609
new business in the next 45 days,

776
00:18:35,609 --> 00:18:36,950
you get the setup fee refunded and

777
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:38,420
can refund half the calls you took

778
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:39,319
and choose to keep working

779
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:40,140
together or not.

780
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:44,410
If you had to choose between

781
00:18:44,529 --> 00:18:46,079
agency owner one.

782
00:18:46,089 --> 00:18:47,099
You're on a sales call, by the

783
00:18:47,099 --> 00:18:47,380
way.

784
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:48,819
So, imagine that all of these

785
00:18:48,819 --> 00:18:50,299
people had the same headline on

786
00:18:50,299 --> 00:18:51,240
their website.

787
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:52,500
It was like performance-based lead

788
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,099
generation.

789
00:18:53,109 --> 00:18:53,519
Right?

790
00:18:53,529 --> 00:18:55,420
Because even this guy can fucking

791
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:57,390
say he does performance-based lead

792
00:18:57,539 --> 00:18:59,740
generation where you pay per call.

793
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:00,019
Right?

794
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:02,039
He could say that as his headline.

795
00:19:02,049 --> 00:19:03,930
You know, yes, there's a $2,000

796
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:05,859
setup and a $500 a month tech fee.

797
00:19:05,869 --> 00:19:06,720
It doesn't fucking matter.

798
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:08,279
He could still say, you could,

799
00:19:08,299 --> 00:19:09,809
because this is what I'm getting

800
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,259
at.

801
00:19:10,269 --> 00:19:11,680
Like, there's wordplay.

802
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:13,490
Like, you fuck with the words to

803
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:15,029
get people on the phone.

804
00:19:15,089 --> 00:19:16,230
You have to get the people on the

805
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:16,630
phone.

806
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:17,039
Right?

807
00:19:17,049 --> 00:19:18,630
So, you got to say what is

808
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:20,480
required to get people on the

809
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,160
phone.

810
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:23,240
And then what you sell them does

811
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,319
not have to be the exact literal

812
00:19:25,319 --> 00:19:27,730
interpretation of what the fucking

813
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:29,759
words are on the headline.

814
00:19:29,849 --> 00:19:30,339
You get what I'm saying?

815
00:19:30,349 --> 00:19:31,839
Like, it's not the same.

816
00:19:31,849 --> 00:19:33,039
You got to say what is required to

817
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:33,970
get them on the phone.

818
00:19:34,009 --> 00:19:35,450
So, now, okay, you, you as a

819
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:37,089
business owner were proposed these

820
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,690
two different things on a sales

821
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:39,170
call.

822
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:40,640
Which one do you take?

823
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:42,460
Whose fucking deal do you take?

824
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:43,579
Assume they have the same amount

825
00:19:43,579 --> 00:19:44,839
of experience in case studies.

826
00:19:44,849 --> 00:19:47,440
The answer, fucking obviously, is

827
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,529
number two.

828
00:19:48,549 --> 00:19:49,700
Like, it just fucking is.

829
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:49,880
Right?

830
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:50,880
Okay, now let's compare this to

831
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,339
this one.

832
00:19:51,349 --> 00:19:53,279
A $500 a month tech fee on this

833
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:53,819
guy.

834
00:19:53,829 --> 00:19:56,880
Then there's a $300 per call.

835
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:00,009
And you pay, like, when the call

836
00:20:00,009 --> 00:20:01,000
is booked.

837
00:20:01,009 --> 00:20:02,460
Which is the same, same for all,

838
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:03,079
all these.

839
00:20:03,089 --> 00:20:03,279
Right?

840
00:20:03,289 --> 00:20:05,890
Which, which do you pick?

841
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:08,809
Most people pick this one to

842
00:20:08,809 --> 00:20:10,880
eliminate this.

843
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:12,410
That's, that's, that's literally,

844
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,839
that's literally what they fucking

845
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:14,140
do.

846
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:14,640
Right?

847
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:16,619
Because this says, this, you, but,

848
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,369
because what we're saying here is

849
00:20:18,369 --> 00:20:20,420
that, yeah, we'll refund the setup

850
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:21,059
fee.

851
00:20:21,069 --> 00:20:22,779
But this one, because there just

852
00:20:22,779 --> 00:20:24,299
isn't a setup fee at all, they

853
00:20:24,299 --> 00:20:26,029
still want that one because there

854
00:20:26,029 --> 00:20:27,319
just is no setup fee.

855
00:20:27,329 --> 00:20:27,839
You get what I'm saying?

856
00:20:27,849 --> 00:20:29,299
Like, it's like fuckery like this.

857
00:20:29,309 --> 00:20:30,940
Okay, so now, now this one is $500

858
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:31,430
a month.

859
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:34,450
And then there's $500 a month tech

860
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:34,940
fee.

861
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:36,240
And then it's just $3,000 a month.

862
00:20:36,289 --> 00:20:37,660
And if you don't get 10, uh, 10

863
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:38,559
calls per month, you get a

864
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:39,559
proportional refund.

865
00:20:39,569 --> 00:20:41,410
So, like, say it's, because it's

866
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:44,049
10 calls guaranteed for $3,000 per

867
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:44,720
month.

868
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:47,079
So, each call is there for $300.

869
00:20:47,089 --> 00:20:48,609
You get what I'm saying?

870
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:50,170
But if we only book seven calls

871
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:52,309
for you, we'll, we'll, we'll

872
00:20:52,359 --> 00:20:55,420
refund the remaining $900 on, on,

873
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:55,960
on this.

874
00:20:56,329 --> 00:20:58,500
Right, okay, which one, which,

875
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,380
which one wins on, on the sales

876
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:01,019
call?

877
00:21:01,029 --> 00:21:04,460
This one wins on the sales call.

878
00:21:04,509 --> 00:21:05,640
Why?

879
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:07,519
Because, because it's performance.

880
00:21:07,529 --> 00:21:09,059
It's, it's, it's, it's mostly

881
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:09,920
performance.

882
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:11,039
You get what I'm saying?

883
00:21:11,049 --> 00:21:12,950
Because performance is less risky

884
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:14,660
than money back guarantee.

885
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:15,519
You get, you get what I'm saying?

886
00:21:15,529 --> 00:21:18,859
But all of them can still fucking

887
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,029
say performance-based lead

888
00:21:22,049 --> 00:21:23,420
generation.

889
00:21:25,289 --> 00:21:27,559
Where you only pay for calls

890
00:21:27,559 --> 00:21:28,369
booked.

891
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:30,980
All of them can say that.

892
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:33,240
You get what I'm saying?

893
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:37,109
And now, like, this guy, if he

894
00:21:37,259 --> 00:21:40,849
doesn't say that, he isn't getting

895
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,680
a single fucking person to book a

896
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,460
call with him.

897
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:47,160
You get what I'm saying?

898
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:49,039
Like, like, when you're making

899
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:50,849
these offers to call traffic,

900
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:52,460
don't make the mistake of listing

901
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:54,299
out every single fucking

902
00:21:54,299 --> 00:21:55,099
contingency.

903
00:21:55,109 --> 00:21:56,759
Of, of, of, of the offer, right?

904
00:21:56,769 --> 00:21:58,140
I've seen people do stupid shit.

905
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,220
Like, like, they'll make this

906
00:21:59,220 --> 00:21:59,900
their headline.

907
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:01,160
They'll say, performance-based

908
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,690
lead generation where we'll book

909
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:04,140
you sales calls and only charge a

910
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:05,650
$500 tech fee and refund you all

911
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:06,789
the calls we couldn't get booked

912
00:22:06,789 --> 00:22:07,200
for you.

913
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:08,880
It's like, bro, what, what the

914
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,119
fuck are you saying?

915
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:11,359
Like, why, why would you, why

916
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:12,240
would you say that?

917
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:13,150
That is not marketing.

918
00:22:13,269 --> 00:22:14,890
There's a time and a place to get

919
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:16,710
into the details of your offer.

920
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:17,829
And it's not the very first

921
00:22:17,829 --> 00:22:19,579
sentence the prospect sees, right?

922
00:22:19,589 --> 00:22:21,029
All of the deal, all of the

923
00:22:21,029 --> 00:22:22,539
details about an offer, an

924
00:22:22,539 --> 00:22:24,150
arrangement you make with the

925
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:26,109
client occurs after they're on the

926
00:22:26,109 --> 00:22:26,740
phone.

927
00:22:26,869 --> 00:22:28,369
You need to say whatever it takes

928
00:22:28,369 --> 00:22:29,940
to get the client on the phone.

929
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:31,490
That's the entire purpose of using

930
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:32,890
a guarantee is to get them on the

931
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:33,779
phone, right?

932
00:22:33,789 --> 00:22:36,539
Your guarantee is, is a mechanism

933
00:22:36,539 --> 00:22:38,960
to get people to book a call.

934
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:41,369
It's not a mechanism to close the

935
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:41,980
sale.

936
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:43,779
You know what I'm saying?

937
00:22:43,789 --> 00:22:45,500
So like, hilariously, 99% of the

938
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,859
time, the prospect won't even

939
00:22:46,859 --> 00:22:48,450
mention the guarantee once they're

940
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,000
on the phone with you, right?

941
00:22:50,009 --> 00:22:51,930
They'll forget you even mentioned

942
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:53,660
it when they're finally on.

943
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:55,539
In every deal you ever do, in

944
00:22:55,539 --> 00:22:57,410
every deal you ever do with your

945
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:59,910
first 30 to 50 clients is going to

946
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:01,220
be custom anyway.

947
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:02,519
What you're advertising on the

948
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:03,789
front end as your headline or

949
00:23:03,789 --> 00:23:05,380
original cold outreach script is

950
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:06,950
not the exact offer that you're

951
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:07,009
selling

952
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:08,349
because every deal you make with

953
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,089
the client is going to be

954
00:23:09,089 --> 00:23:09,569
different.

955
00:23:09,609 --> 00:23:10,509
Get what I'm saying?

956
00:23:10,549 --> 00:23:11,720
Everything's different.

957
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:12,559
It's all custom.

958
00:23:12,569 --> 00:23:13,539
It's all dynamic.

959
00:23:13,549 --> 00:23:14,619
That's what you're doing.

960
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:15,940
Like, everything is different in

961
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:16,569
the beginning.

962
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:18,329
Like, don't fucking box yourself

963
00:23:18,329 --> 00:23:20,109
into this like arbitrarily made,

964
00:23:20,119 --> 00:23:22,180
like, I have to charge this exact

965
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:22,809
much.

966
00:23:22,829 --> 00:23:24,299
I only charge this much money.

967
00:23:24,309 --> 00:23:25,990
Like, what you can guarantee for

968
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:27,390
one person is not what you can

969
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,869
guarantee for another.

970
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:30,180
And if you get caught thinking

971
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:31,779
about all these contingencies and

972
00:23:31,779 --> 00:23:32,839
pulling your punches,

973
00:23:33,369 --> 00:23:35,460
pull your punches from saying a

974
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:37,190
really, really good offer with the

975
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:38,380
biggest fuck numbers on the front

976
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:38,539
end,

977
00:23:38,549 --> 00:23:40,859
nobody is going to get on the

978
00:23:40,859 --> 00:23:42,410
phone with you.

979
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:44,259
90% of the time, if you're not

980
00:23:44,259 --> 00:23:45,539
getting enough sales calls booked,

981
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:46,809
it's because you're pulling your

982
00:23:46,809 --> 00:23:48,140
punches and using a genuinely very

983
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:49,660
good claim with really big numbers

984
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:50,640
that actually get people

985
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,539
interested at all.

986
00:23:51,549 --> 00:23:52,670
You're pulling your punches on

987
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:53,980
this because you're thinking about

988
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:54,970
all of the contingencies

989
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:55,980
and getting too into your head

990
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:57,390
about the fact that you're, that

991
00:23:57,390 --> 00:23:59,640
you, that, that you can't get that

992
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,000
result

993
00:24:00,049 --> 00:24:01,559
for every single, every singular

994
00:24:01,559 --> 00:24:01,990
person.

995
00:24:02,089 --> 00:24:03,180
Stop doing that.

996
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:05,029
Because the people who can get

997
00:24:05,029 --> 00:24:07,690
really good results, who are great

998
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:08,680
clients,

999
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:10,809
will not get on the phone with you

1000
00:24:10,859 --> 00:24:13,180
if you're not quoting high enough

1001
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:14,680
and attractive enough results in

1002
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,859
your headliner offer.

1003
00:24:15,869 --> 00:24:18,430
So, for instance, if you're one of

1004
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:20,740
those lead gen offers up above

1005
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,210
and you charge $500 a month tech

1006
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:23,619
fee and a $3,000 a month retainer

1007
00:24:23,619 --> 00:24:24,559
worth of proportional refund,

1008
00:24:24,569 --> 00:24:26,809
then don't fucking say that,

1009
00:24:26,809 --> 00:24:27,559
right?

1010
00:24:27,569 --> 00:24:29,279
Just say it's performance-based

1011
00:24:29,289 --> 00:24:30,650
lead gen where you only pay for

1012
00:24:30,759 --> 00:24:32,130
qualified sales calls that show

1013
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:32,339
up.

1014
00:24:32,349 --> 00:24:37,150
And then, the, the, the, the, the

1015
00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:39,700
mechanical workings of how that is

1016
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,099
fucking laid out,

1017
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:42,859
you talk about that on the fucking

1018
00:24:42,859 --> 00:24:44,019
sales call, right?

1019
00:24:44,029 --> 00:24:45,240
You don't talk about that in the

1020
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,619
headline of your offer, right?

1021
00:24:47,049 --> 00:24:48,319
So, all the nuance about the

1022
00:24:48,329 --> 00:24:49,640
logistics of the offer and the

1023
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:50,839
terms is a conversation

1024
00:24:50,849 --> 00:24:52,349
that happens one-on-one, not on

1025
00:24:52,349 --> 00:24:53,920
the headline of your website

1026
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:55,410
or inside of your cold email

1027
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:56,049
scripts.

1028
00:24:56,089 --> 00:24:56,700
You know what I'm saying?

1029
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:57,460
All right, cool.

1030
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:58,779
So, if you use a guarantee, don't

1031
00:24:58,779 --> 00:24:59,940
sign clients who can't get the

1032
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:00,740
result, right?

1033
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:01,710
But when using a guarantee, you

1034
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:02,690
need to heavily qualify clients

1035
00:25:02,769 --> 00:25:03,569
to make sure it's possible to get

1036
00:25:03,569 --> 00:25:04,339
the result in the first place.

1037
00:25:04,349 --> 00:25:05,609
Because it is inherently the most

1038
00:25:05,609 --> 00:25:06,819
attractive offer possible,

1039
00:25:06,829 --> 00:25:07,589
the conversion rate will go up

1040
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:08,349
substantially, right?

1041
00:25:08,369 --> 00:25:09,339
So, with a higher conversion rate,

1042
00:25:09,339 --> 00:25:11,099
you must increase your filtering

1043
00:25:11,109 --> 00:25:12,630
and accept only the most qualified

1044
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,859
people who have a high likelihood

1045
00:25:13,859 --> 00:25:14,740
of achievement in the first place.

1046
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:15,859
So, let's say you get on the phone

1047
00:25:15,859 --> 00:25:17,019
with a prospect who, for whatever

1048
00:25:17,019 --> 00:25:17,349
reason,

1049
00:25:17,369 --> 00:25:19,009
there's no way they're able to get

1050
00:25:19,009 --> 00:25:20,369
the result promised on your

1051
00:25:20,369 --> 00:25:21,049
landing page

1052
00:25:21,089 --> 00:25:21,990
or you said in a cold email to

1053
00:25:22,039 --> 00:25:23,029
them, whatever the fuck.

1054
00:25:23,089 --> 00:25:24,720
Then simply don't fucking give

1055
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,059
them that guarantee.

1056
00:25:26,069 --> 00:25:27,640
Like, just fucking, like, you're

1057
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:29,150
not contractually fucking legally

1058
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:29,700
required

1059
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:30,869
to fucking do the deal with the

1060
00:25:30,869 --> 00:25:31,640
person, right?

1061
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:32,220
So, okay.

1062
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:33,960
So, normally, just like what you

1063
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:34,640
would say,

1064
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:36,589
normally when we sign clients in

1065
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:37,450
this offer,

1066
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:38,339
it's because I'm absolutely

1067
00:25:38,339 --> 00:25:39,380
certain we can get that result for

1068
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:39,619
them.

1069
00:25:39,869 --> 00:25:41,440
Based off what you have, and

1070
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:42,880
because X, Y, and Z factor,

1071
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:44,509
based off what you have, Mr.

1072
00:25:44,509 --> 00:25:45,079
Client,

1073
00:25:45,089 --> 00:25:46,500
because you don't have any client

1074
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,559
case studies yourself,

1075
00:25:47,569 --> 00:25:48,880
and, like, you've never actually

1076
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,259
sold this to cold traffic before,

1077
00:25:50,269 --> 00:25:51,259
like, I'm not confident in my

1078
00:25:51,259 --> 00:25:52,180
ability to sell this to cold

1079
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:52,579
traffic,

1080
00:25:52,589 --> 00:25:53,880
and therefore, I wouldn't be able

1081
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,150
to guarantee you this amount of

1082
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:55,670
clients.

1083
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:56,400
You know what I'm saying?

1084
00:25:56,410 --> 00:25:57,660
I do not believe we'd be able to

1085
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:58,680
get you that result.

1086
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:00,789
What I do think is possible for

1087
00:26:00,859 --> 00:26:03,519
you is X, right?

1088
00:26:03,529 --> 00:26:04,680
And if that's something you'd

1089
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,890
still be interested in talking

1090
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:06,279
about,

1091
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:07,210
I'd be happy to continue the

1092
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:08,319
conversation, but if not, no

1093
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:09,220
worries, right?

1094
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:10,619
Okay, everything is a negotiation.

1095
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:12,029
Do not ever lock yourself into one

1096
00:26:12,029 --> 00:26:13,079
singular deliverable

1097
00:26:13,089 --> 00:26:14,380
for only one singular price and

1098
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:15,680
only one singular result.

1099
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:16,680
You've got to be dynamic,

1100
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:18,170
sell everybody exactly what they

1101
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:19,019
are willing to buy

1102
00:26:19,029 --> 00:26:20,319
until you're at $100K a month.

1103
00:26:20,349 --> 00:26:21,559
I always hear this a lot.

1104
00:26:21,569 --> 00:26:22,589
People are like,

1105
00:26:22,609 --> 00:26:25,690
Daniel, how much should I charge?

1106
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,039
Or should I do a performance

1107
00:26:27,049 --> 00:26:27,579
basis?

1108
00:26:27,589 --> 00:26:29,069
Or can I start taking rev shares

1109
00:26:29,069 --> 00:26:30,039
plus retainers?

1110
00:26:30,049 --> 00:26:31,680
Like, should I do that?

1111
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:33,380
Or, like, what should I do?

1112
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:37,210
And the answer is that you sell

1113
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,460
what you can.

1114
00:26:38,529 --> 00:26:40,799
You sell the most advantageous

1115
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:42,180
deal for yourself

1116
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:44,130
that you're possibly able to pull

1117
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:45,059
off, right?

1118
00:26:45,069 --> 00:26:46,940
And if a client pushes back on it

1119
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:47,539
and they don't want it,

1120
00:26:47,549 --> 00:26:49,490
then negotiate the fucking shit

1121
00:26:49,609 --> 00:26:49,859
down

1122
00:26:49,869 --> 00:26:51,579
until a point where you both reach

1123
00:26:51,579 --> 00:26:52,279
an agreement

1124
00:26:52,289 --> 00:26:53,500
where you're down to do it for

1125
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:54,460
that specific price

1126
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:56,130
with these specific logistics and

1127
00:26:56,130 --> 00:26:56,900
contract terms

1128
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:58,029
and this specific guarantee or

1129
00:26:58,029 --> 00:26:58,839
whatever the fuck.

1130
00:26:58,869 --> 00:26:59,440
You get what I'm saying?

1131
00:26:59,789 --> 00:27:01,630
The answer to how much money you

1132
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:02,539
should charge

1133
00:27:02,549 --> 00:27:04,920
is the maximum fucking amount

1134
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:07,049
that you could possibly get on the

1135
00:27:07,099 --> 00:27:07,839
call

1136
00:27:07,849 --> 00:27:09,000
that you could possibly get the

1137
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,500
client to talk about, right?

1138
00:27:11,509 --> 00:27:13,119
And don't do this stupid bullshit

1139
00:27:13,119 --> 00:27:13,740
where it's like,

1140
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:16,470
well, you know, like, I really

1141
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:16,920
want to,

1142
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:19,180
I really want to make sure I'm not

1143
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,240
taking too much money.

1144
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:20,839
Like, no.

1145
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:23,240
Fucking charge as much as you

1146
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,660
possibly can.

1147
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:25,500
You get what I'm saying?

1148
00:27:25,509 --> 00:27:26,720
So, all right, cool.

1149
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:27,890
If you're scared of getting

1150
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:28,470
results for clients

1151
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:29,460
and getting screwed by refunds,

1152
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:30,539
I constantly get this question

1153
00:27:30,539 --> 00:27:31,339
from people inside Client

1154
00:27:31,339 --> 00:27:31,589
Ascension

1155
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:32,869
who are too scared to use a

1156
00:27:32,869 --> 00:27:33,559
guarantee.

1157
00:27:33,609 --> 00:27:35,250
They say, I want to position my

1158
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:37,140
offer around getting results,

1159
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:38,690
but I don't want to guarantee

1160
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:39,259
results

1161
00:27:39,269 --> 00:27:40,930
because not all my clients get

1162
00:27:40,930 --> 00:27:41,420
results.

1163
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:42,779
And I don't want to get stuck

1164
00:27:42,779 --> 00:27:43,759
giving refunds.

1165
00:27:43,769 --> 00:27:44,670
What do I do?

1166
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:46,160
Okay, a couple of things you have

1167
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,200
to understand here.

1168
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:48,920
The reason a lot of your clients

1169
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:49,960
don't get results

1170
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:51,490
is because out of scarcity,

1171
00:27:51,509 --> 00:27:53,029
you're allowing yourself to sign

1172
00:27:53,029 --> 00:27:53,980
low quality clients

1173
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:55,009
who are impossible to get results

1174
00:27:55,009 --> 00:27:55,819
for in the first place.

1175
00:27:56,269 --> 00:27:57,789
But of all the people who say

1176
00:27:57,799 --> 00:27:58,210
this,

1177
00:27:58,269 --> 00:28:00,019
it's because they signed a client

1178
00:28:00,019 --> 00:28:00,740
and they're,

1179
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:03,279
okay, when I say the word client,

1180
00:28:03,289 --> 00:28:05,369
what you're thinking of is like

1181
00:28:05,369 --> 00:28:07,789
this like vague idea

1182
00:28:07,829 --> 00:28:09,759
of a business owner who has it all

1183
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:10,579
figured out

1184
00:28:10,589 --> 00:28:12,299
and like who has a lot of money.

1185
00:28:12,309 --> 00:28:13,400
That's what you were thinking.

1186
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:15,759
What you're failing to understand

1187
00:28:15,769 --> 00:28:17,839
is that all of the people who say

1188
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:20,039
this signed a client,

1189
00:28:20,269 --> 00:28:21,960
but it's not that person.

1190
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:25,200
It's a client who like doesn't

1191
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,700
actually run a business

1192
00:28:27,809 --> 00:28:29,329
that makes any fucking money at

1193
00:28:29,329 --> 00:28:29,539
all.

1194
00:28:29,549 --> 00:28:31,019
And they have like no client case

1195
00:28:31,019 --> 00:28:31,619
studies.

1196
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:34,190
They have, their offer is dog

1197
00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:34,710
shit.

1198
00:28:34,829 --> 00:28:36,599
It's, they've never sold it to

1199
00:28:36,599 --> 00:28:38,099
cold traffic before ever

1200
00:28:38,109 --> 00:28:39,160
in their fucking life.

1201
00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:39,980
Not even once.

1202
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:41,930
Like that's who says stuff like

1203
00:28:42,049 --> 00:28:42,549
this.

1204
00:28:42,569 --> 00:28:44,019
Which I, none of my client,

1205
00:28:44,029 --> 00:28:45,319
my, all of my clients don't get

1206
00:28:45,319 --> 00:28:45,900
results.

1207
00:28:46,109 --> 00:28:47,799
The clients who don't get results

1208
00:28:47,799 --> 00:28:49,420
are this,

1209
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:51,319
is this person who isn't even

1210
00:28:51,319 --> 00:28:51,900
running

1211
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:53,400
a real fucking business, right?

1212
00:28:53,410 --> 00:28:55,250
And now how did, how did the

1213
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:56,420
person who's saying this,

1214
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:57,559
how did they arise into a

1215
00:28:57,559 --> 00:28:58,119
situation

1216
00:28:58,769 --> 00:29:02,390
where they, they decided to sign a

1217
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:03,289
person

1218
00:29:03,349 --> 00:29:05,180
who makes no fucking money at all?

1219
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:06,640
And I want to explain why, right?

1220
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:09,349
So, so because they weren't

1221
00:29:09,349 --> 00:29:11,180
promising results,

1222
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:12,880
they were not positioning

1223
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:13,720
themselves

1224
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:15,650
to be attractive enough to attract

1225
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:17,559
good quality clients.

1226
00:29:17,569 --> 00:29:19,089
This means you sign less and less

1227
00:29:19,099 --> 00:29:20,160
good quality clients

1228
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:21,710
who are easy to get results for.

1229
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:25,319
Okay, so their, their claim of

1230
00:29:25,319 --> 00:29:27,259
like results

1231
00:29:27,269 --> 00:29:28,759
that a client can get, or like

1232
00:29:28,759 --> 00:29:30,039
their guarantee

1233
00:29:30,049 --> 00:29:32,789
was so of a low number, like so

1234
00:29:32,789 --> 00:29:33,700
shitty,

1235
00:29:34,829 --> 00:29:37,430
only shitty clients were willing

1236
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,200
to get on the phone

1237
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:39,160
for it at all, where it's like,

1238
00:29:39,170 --> 00:29:41,769
your next client guaranteed, or

1239
00:29:41,819 --> 00:29:42,160
some,

1240
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:43,710
or like I'll guarantee you book

1241
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,700
five sales calls,

1242
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:46,640
some stupid fucking bullshit like

1243
00:29:46,769 --> 00:29:47,180
that.

1244
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:49,119
Like, what, what does that do?

1245
00:29:49,789 --> 00:29:52,710
What it does is it gets the

1246
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:54,119
people,

1247
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:56,029
like you say five fucking sales

1248
00:29:56,029 --> 00:29:57,210
calls guaranteed,

1249
00:29:57,329 --> 00:29:59,250
it attracts the person who thinks

1250
00:29:59,269 --> 00:30:00,920
five sales calls is a lot, right?

1251
00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:02,759
And they're fucking poor people.

1252
00:30:02,769 --> 00:30:03,650
You get what I'm saying, right?

1253
00:30:03,769 --> 00:30:06,440
So a reason you don't get clients

1254
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:07,569
is because your offer is not good

1255
00:30:07,569 --> 00:30:07,859
enough

1256
00:30:07,869 --> 00:30:09,420
to attract the, uh, attract the

1257
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:09,940
quality clients

1258
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:10,559
in the first place.

1259
00:30:10,569 --> 00:30:12,279
So you only, so the only people

1260
00:30:12,279 --> 00:30:12,900
you ever talk to

1261
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:13,609
are low quality clients.

1262
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:15,059
This means you rarely get them any

1263
00:30:15,059 --> 00:30:15,569
results,

1264
00:30:15,589 --> 00:30:16,490
which means you're scared to

1265
00:30:16,539 --> 00:30:17,240
promise results.

1266
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:18,380
Okay, so this is, this is, this is

1267
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:19,019
what this looks like.

1268
00:30:19,029 --> 00:30:21,410
You promise an underwhelming

1269
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:22,890
result, right?

1270
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:25,700
Which leads to you only attracting

1271
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:26,660
low quality clients

1272
00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:28,059
who think that result is a lot.

1273
00:30:28,069 --> 00:30:30,539
Which means it's impossible to get

1274
00:30:30,539 --> 00:30:30,960
results

1275
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:32,019
for those clients because they're

1276
00:30:32,019 --> 00:30:32,660
low quality clients

1277
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:33,789
and they run shitty businesses,

1278
00:30:33,789 --> 00:30:34,140
right?

1279
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:35,900
Which means you can't generate

1280
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:36,720
case studies

1281
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:38,309
because they're impossible to get

1282
00:30:38,329 --> 00:30:39,519
results for, right?

1283
00:30:39,529 --> 00:30:40,890
And because you can't generate

1284
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:41,500
case studies,

1285
00:30:41,509 --> 00:30:42,609
it means you can't charge more

1286
00:30:42,609 --> 00:30:42,880
money

1287
00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:43,779
and consistently increase your

1288
00:30:43,789 --> 00:30:44,150
revenue.

1289
00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:45,299
And when you can't do that,

1290
00:30:45,309 --> 00:30:46,849
it means you become insecure and

1291
00:30:46,849 --> 00:30:47,680
unsure of yourself,

1292
00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:49,440
which leads to you continuing

1293
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:50,920
to promise underwhelming results.

1294
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:53,500
That's what the fuck is happening

1295
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:53,819
here.

1296
00:30:53,829 --> 00:30:54,400
You get what I'm saying?

1297
00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:55,950
So like, however, if you made your

1298
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:56,900
offer substantially better

1299
00:30:56,910 --> 00:30:57,809
by actually promising clear and

1300
00:30:57,859 --> 00:30:58,630
quantifiable results,

1301
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:00,019
you would book two to four times

1302
00:31:00,019 --> 00:31:00,559
more calls

1303
00:31:00,569 --> 00:31:02,380
fucking immediately, right?

1304
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:03,930
Which would mean you have more

1305
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:04,880
exposure to people

1306
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:06,500
who actually have great businesses

1307
00:31:06,509 --> 00:31:08,049
and who are easier to get results

1308
00:31:08,109 --> 00:31:08,440
for.

1309
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:09,839
So what would that look like?

1310
00:31:09,849 --> 00:31:11,779
It means you start, this is where

1311
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:12,380
you start,

1312
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:14,079
by the way, this is step one,

1313
00:31:14,079 --> 00:31:14,880
right?

1314
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:16,960
You make a high result claim in

1315
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:17,970
large guarantees

1316
00:31:18,089 --> 00:31:19,380
in your front end copy.

1317
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:22,009
Which means that you attract high

1318
00:31:22,009 --> 00:31:23,269
quality clients

1319
00:31:23,369 --> 00:31:25,849
who are only swayed by those high

1320
00:31:25,849 --> 00:31:27,480
numbers, right?

1321
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:29,559
Which means high quality clients

1322
00:31:29,569 --> 00:31:30,539
are easy to get results for,

1323
00:31:30,549 --> 00:31:32,309
which means you generate tons of

1324
00:31:32,309 --> 00:31:33,599
case studies easily,

1325
00:31:33,609 --> 00:31:35,289
which means that you book more

1326
00:31:35,289 --> 00:31:35,819
calls,

1327
00:31:35,829 --> 00:31:36,829
booking more calls becomes

1328
00:31:36,829 --> 00:31:37,700
progressively easier

1329
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:38,529
and you build authority more

1330
00:31:38,529 --> 00:31:38,880
quickly,

1331
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:40,119
which means you can increase your

1332
00:31:40,119 --> 00:31:40,410
prices

1333
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:41,420
and keep making more money.

1334
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:43,299
You know what I'm saying?

1335
00:31:44,369 --> 00:31:45,380
That's how this shit works.

1336
00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:47,460
So it's like super fucking

1337
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:48,759
integral that you understand.

1338
00:31:48,769 --> 00:31:50,599
So this is a quick graph of,

1339
00:31:50,609 --> 00:31:52,099
it's just sales calls booked,

1340
00:31:52,109 --> 00:31:53,950
assuming with versus without a

1341
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:54,839
guarantee.

1342
00:31:54,849 --> 00:31:58,710
Okay, so quick visualization here.

1343
00:31:58,809 --> 00:32:03,589
So you'll probably book something

1344
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:04,299
like

1345
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:07,640
fucking five and a half, six times

1346
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:08,660
more calls

1347
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:10,599
using a guarantee versus without

1348
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:11,460
when you're just getting started.

1349
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:12,099
You don't have a bunch of case

1350
00:32:12,109 --> 00:32:12,619
studies, right?

1351
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:13,359
Okay, so.

1352
00:32:13,849 --> 00:32:15,109
What this means is that

1353
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:17,619
over a six month period,

1354
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:19,680
you have booked 33 calls without a

1355
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:20,299
guarantee.

1356
00:32:20,309 --> 00:32:22,109
You have booked 198 calls with a

1357
00:32:22,109 --> 00:32:22,839
guarantee.

1358
00:32:22,849 --> 00:32:24,099
So six calls a month versus 33

1359
00:32:24,099 --> 00:32:25,119
calls a month, right?

1360
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:26,809
So like almost fucking six times

1361
00:32:26,809 --> 00:32:27,250
more.

1362
00:32:27,289 --> 00:32:29,220
So the main problem you'll have

1363
00:32:29,269 --> 00:32:30,089
in objecting to what I'm telling

1364
00:32:30,089 --> 00:32:30,500
you to do here

1365
00:32:30,509 --> 00:32:31,700
is that you're not appreciating

1366
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:32,119
the degree

1367
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:33,430
to which this actually impacts

1368
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:34,069
your trajectory

1369
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:35,160
when you're just starting, right?

1370
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:36,940
You got to understand that you

1371
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:37,519
cannot afford

1372
00:32:37,529 --> 00:32:38,829
to only get six sales calls

1373
00:32:38,829 --> 00:32:39,940
average per month for six months.

1374
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:41,049
So without a guarantee over the

1375
00:32:41,049 --> 00:32:41,700
course of six months,

1376
00:32:42,089 --> 00:32:43,200
it's only 33 calls you booked.

1377
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:44,619
That's a 15% close rate.

1378
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:45,599
That means five clients signed

1379
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:46,500
over six months, right?

1380
00:32:46,509 --> 00:32:47,299
Account for client.

1381
00:32:47,309 --> 00:32:47,480
Sure.

1382
00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:48,480
And you're living in complete

1383
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,079
absolute fucking desolate poverty.

1384
00:32:50,089 --> 00:32:50,890
You need to have another job,

1385
00:32:50,890 --> 00:32:51,180
right?

1386
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:52,059
You are not running a serious

1387
00:32:52,059 --> 00:32:52,480
business.

1388
00:32:52,509 --> 00:32:53,859
You're not being a serious person

1389
00:32:53,859 --> 00:32:54,779
at all.

1390
00:32:55,009 --> 00:32:57,549
With the guarantee, it's 198 total

1391
00:32:57,549 --> 00:32:58,259
calls booked

1392
00:32:58,269 --> 00:32:59,789
over the course of six months.

1393
00:32:59,809 --> 00:33:01,289
15% close rate means you close 30

1394
00:33:01,289 --> 00:33:01,740
clients.

1395
00:33:01,769 --> 00:33:03,000
Average of five per month.

1396
00:33:03,009 --> 00:33:04,440
That's a fucking shit ton of

1397
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,240
revenue to work with, right?

1398
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:08,420
It affords you the opportunity to

1399
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:10,299
actually produce case studies.

1400
00:33:10,309 --> 00:33:11,680
And when you get case studies

1401
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,079
made,

1402
00:33:12,089 --> 00:33:13,779
you book even more sales calls

1403
00:33:13,789 --> 00:33:14,809
and you're able to make more

1404
00:33:14,819 --> 00:33:15,180
content

1405
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:16,180
and get more referrals

1406
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:18,539
and generally make like way more

1407
00:33:18,539 --> 00:33:18,990
noise

1408
00:33:19,009 --> 00:33:20,940
that tremendously impacts your

1409
00:33:21,069 --> 00:33:22,279
inbound lead flow, right?

1410
00:33:22,609 --> 00:33:24,019
So we're going to revisit this

1411
00:33:24,019 --> 00:33:24,460
concept

1412
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:25,920
so you fully understand it.

1413
00:33:26,569 --> 00:33:27,210
Okay.

1414
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:28,609
So your offer is about getting

1415
00:33:28,609 --> 00:33:30,119
people on the phone, right?

1416
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:30,880
If your offer is not strong

1417
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,180
enough,

1418
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:31,920
nobody will get on the phone with

1419
00:33:31,930 --> 00:33:32,089
you.

1420
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:33,259
If an unqualified prospect happens

1421
00:33:33,259 --> 00:33:33,779
to get on the phone,

1422
00:33:33,789 --> 00:33:34,579
you don't need to go through

1423
00:33:34,589 --> 00:33:35,549
with the exact offer that was on

1424
00:33:35,549 --> 00:33:36,359
your landing page for them.

1425
00:33:36,369 --> 00:33:37,569
It's just called just not offering

1426
00:33:37,569 --> 00:33:38,079
somebody.

1427
00:33:38,089 --> 00:33:39,539
Your offer is for qualified

1428
00:33:39,539 --> 00:33:40,599
prospects only.

1429
00:33:40,609 --> 00:33:41,480
But when you have a bad offer,

1430
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:42,119
that's not attractive.

1431
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:43,359
You never get qualified prospects

1432
00:33:43,359 --> 00:33:44,200
on the phone in the first place

1433
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:44,880
because people only,

1434
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:46,039
because good prospects only buy

1435
00:33:46,039 --> 00:33:46,829
good offers, right?

1436
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:48,240
So you go into the death loop of

1437
00:33:48,269 --> 00:33:49,069
my offer is bad

1438
00:33:49,089 --> 00:33:50,230
because I don't get any qualified

1439
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:50,480
leads,

1440
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:51,369
which means I make no money,

1441
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:52,849
which means I can't afford to make

1442
00:33:52,849 --> 00:33:53,519
my offer better,

1443
00:33:53,529 --> 00:33:54,640
which means I continue to not get

1444
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,470
any qualified leads.

1445
00:33:55,529 --> 00:33:56,819
So you need to switch this to my

1446
00:33:56,819 --> 00:33:57,660
offer is great,

1447
00:33:57,670 --> 00:33:58,789
which leads to me getting so many

1448
00:33:58,789 --> 00:33:59,460
calls booked.

1449
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:00,470
I actually get to talk to some

1450
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:01,759
qualified business owners now.

1451
00:34:01,769 --> 00:34:02,740
I signed some of those business

1452
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:03,119
owners.

1453
00:34:03,130 --> 00:34:04,339
It's easy to get them results.

1454
00:34:04,349 --> 00:34:05,599
I get case studies and they're

1455
00:34:05,599 --> 00:34:05,900
happy.

1456
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:06,809
And they're also really easy to

1457
00:34:06,819 --> 00:34:07,220
work with.

1458
00:34:07,269 --> 00:34:08,500
So they send me referrals, right?

1459
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:10,619
So you understand,

1460
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:12,860
like let's just simulate out some

1461
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:14,179
refund math here.

1462
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:15,260
If you did have a guarantee,

1463
00:34:15,269 --> 00:34:16,519
let's say you're selling a $3,000

1464
00:34:16,519 --> 00:34:17,079
a month service

1465
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:18,059
and the average client stays for

1466
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:18,460
four months.

1467
00:34:18,469 --> 00:34:19,219
It means you have an LTV of

1468
00:34:19,219 --> 00:34:20,079
$12,000.

1469
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:21,789
Those five clients you signed in

1470
00:34:21,789 --> 00:34:23,119
the offer without a guarantee,

1471
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:24,139
zero refunds, right?

1472
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:25,519
Now, let's say your gross margin

1473
00:34:25,519 --> 00:34:27,199
to fulfill the clients is 70%.

1474
00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:30,230
So you make $60,000 times 0.7, so

1475
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:31,039
$42,000.

1476
00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:32,809
So non-guarantee offer because of

1477
00:34:32,809 --> 00:34:33,599
return rate,

1478
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:34,610
this is how much MRR is going to

1479
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:36,619
be modeled out to, right?

1480
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:38,179
So you'd probably hit like $12,000

1481
00:34:38,179 --> 00:34:40,420
a month in like month four.

1482
00:34:40,429 --> 00:34:41,500
It's actually not.

1483
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:42,690
It's like, I see a lot of people

1484
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:43,340
who fuck this up.

1485
00:34:43,349 --> 00:34:44,639
It's actually like a lot of them

1486
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:45,900
just stay at fucking zero and

1487
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:46,719
don't sign any, right?

1488
00:34:46,769 --> 00:34:48,710
But what I'm trying to do is just

1489
00:34:48,829 --> 00:34:50,400
compare this to like,

1490
00:34:50,409 --> 00:34:51,559
if you're doing the guarantee

1491
00:34:51,559 --> 00:34:51,900
offer,

1492
00:34:51,909 --> 00:34:53,590
even if you were assuming a

1493
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:55,440
fucking 6% refund rate,

1494
00:34:55,449 --> 00:34:58,280
which is like super fucking high,

1495
00:34:58,369 --> 00:35:00,710
like you're never going to have a

1496
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:02,849
fucking 6% refund rate.

1497
00:35:02,909 --> 00:35:04,730
Like you'll have like 2% or 1%,

1498
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:05,280
right?

1499
00:35:05,289 --> 00:35:10,260
It's $357,000 compared to $71,000.

1500
00:35:10,269 --> 00:35:13,599
It's so much more fucking money

1501
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:15,449
you make with the guarantee.

1502
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:16,920
And this is after, this is after

1503
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:19,039
the refund, after refunds.

1504
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:20,519
You know what I'm saying?

1505
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:22,980
Like it's like, it's so much more.

1506
00:35:22,989 --> 00:35:23,869
Like you really just don't

1507
00:35:23,869 --> 00:35:24,440
comprehend.

1508
00:35:24,449 --> 00:35:27,380
The degree to which having the

1509
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:29,340
guarantee outperforms a

1510
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:30,179
non-guarantee

1511
00:35:30,289 --> 00:35:32,219
is fucking completely absurd.

1512
00:35:32,269 --> 00:35:33,460
Like it's so much more.

1513
00:35:33,469 --> 00:35:35,219
So, okay.

1514
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:36,380
Problems with the assumptions

1515
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:37,630
you'll make around implementing

1516
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:37,820
this

1517
00:35:37,869 --> 00:35:39,019
is that you'll say something like,

1518
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:40,139
this extremely low impact

1519
00:35:40,139 --> 00:35:41,500
guarantee will work to drive the

1520
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:42,079
sales up.

1521
00:35:42,309 --> 00:35:44,699
is if I guarantee they get leads,

1522
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:46,650
it's going to also work as well as

1523
00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:48,150
guaranteeing clients or sales

1524
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:48,539
calls.

1525
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:49,400
So I'm going to guarantee the

1526
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:49,719
leads.

1527
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:50,739
No, right?

1528
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:52,329
So I had this conversation with a

1529
00:35:52,349 --> 00:35:53,199
client of mine,

1530
00:35:53,210 --> 00:35:54,340
Josh Steinberg.

1531
00:35:54,349 --> 00:35:55,820
So I was asking him, how's his

1532
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:56,179
business been?

1533
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:56,840
Yo, Dan, it's been good.

1534
00:35:56,849 --> 00:35:57,840
Hovering around $8,000 to $10,000

1535
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:58,239
a month right now.

1536
00:35:58,250 --> 00:35:59,219
Clients are super sticky for the

1537
00:35:59,219 --> 00:35:59,619
most part,

1538
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:00,460
which has been great for cash

1539
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:00,739
flow.

1540
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:02,000
Just been a little slow on booking

1541
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:02,690
calls recently.

1542
00:36:02,809 --> 00:36:04,519
I think at my current revenue case

1543
00:36:04,519 --> 00:36:05,000
level,

1544
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:06,130
probably need to focus on ramming

1545
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:07,130
a ton of Dream 100.

1546
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:08,409
I have 50 email inboxes, so I'll

1547
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:09,070
book it in $8,000 to $10,000 a

1548
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:09,260
month.

1549
00:36:09,269 --> 00:36:10,789
I was booking $8,000 to $10,000 a

1550
00:36:10,789 --> 00:36:11,840
month from cold email on YouTube

1551
00:36:11,849 --> 00:36:12,119
before.

1552
00:36:12,309 --> 00:36:13,210
And it's just been bone dry

1553
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:13,739
recently.

1554
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:17,429
So I started asking, like, what

1555
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,960
other companies are there, right?

1556
00:36:19,969 --> 00:36:21,590
So, well, I know one company doing

1557
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:23,119
$270,000 a month,

1558
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:24,420
and another doing $100,000 a month

1559
00:36:24,429 --> 00:36:25,039
in the med spa space,

1560
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:26,179
which is the space he's into.

1561
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:28,389
And then I said, can you figure

1562
00:36:28,389 --> 00:36:29,570
out their offer and their lead

1563
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:29,940
gen?

1564
00:36:29,969 --> 00:36:30,519
He goes, absolutely.

1565
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:32,360
The $270,000 a month company's

1566
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,969
offer is close 5 to 10 new body

1567
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:34,719
contour clients

1568
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:36,190
every seven days, or you don't

1569
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:36,980
pay, right?

1570
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:39,409
So his competitor is guaranteeing

1571
00:36:39,409 --> 00:36:40,760
clients, right?

1572
00:36:40,769 --> 00:36:42,440
So I told him, I was like, okay,

1573
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,079
so you got to copy that offer.

1574
00:36:44,090 --> 00:36:45,980
Like, you're at $10,000 a month.

1575
00:36:45,989 --> 00:36:47,820
They're at $270,000 a month.

1576
00:36:47,829 --> 00:36:49,079
You have to fucking copy that

1577
00:36:49,079 --> 00:36:49,900
offer, right?

1578
00:36:49,909 --> 00:36:51,070
That's clearly the one that's

1579
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:52,179
working wildly better.

1580
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:53,590
And then I followed up with him a

1581
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:55,619
while back, a while later.

1582
00:36:55,650 --> 00:36:57,090
He said, sign three clients since

1583
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:58,550
implementing your advice, by the

1584
00:36:58,550 --> 00:36:59,280
way, right?

1585
00:37:01,929 --> 00:37:06,599
Like, fucking, that's it.

1586
00:37:06,610 --> 00:37:08,260
Like, that's all it takes, right?

1587
00:37:08,269 --> 00:37:09,469
So market demand resulted in the

1588
00:37:09,469 --> 00:37:10,639
old guarantee no longer having

1589
00:37:10,639 --> 00:37:11,099
impact.

1590
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:12,400
Josh is guaranteeing appointments.

1591
00:37:12,449 --> 00:37:13,250
His competitor is guaranteeing

1592
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:13,559
clients.

1593
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:14,739
Josh makes $10,000 a month.

1594
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:16,190
The competitor makes $270,000 a

1595
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:17,730
month, which is fucking 27 times

1596
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:18,489
more than Josh.

1597
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:19,760
So from guaranteeing appointments

1598
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,099
to clients results in 27 times

1599
00:37:21,159 --> 00:37:22,019
more sales volume.

1600
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:25,360
Like, dude, that's how important

1601
00:37:25,449 --> 00:37:26,940
this shit is.

1602
00:37:26,949 --> 00:37:28,329
So I have another client who runs

1603
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:29,739
a cold email lead gen agency.

1604
00:37:30,170 --> 00:37:32,050
Standard offer and, like, pricing

1605
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:34,000
structure over there is a monthly

1606
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,159
tech fee plus cost per

1607
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:35,940
lead or cost per call.

1608
00:37:35,949 --> 00:37:37,030
This guy's revenue was stagnating

1609
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:38,449
around, like, $15,000 a month

1610
00:37:38,449 --> 00:37:39,030
doing that.

1611
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:41,239
I said, fuck it, bro.

1612
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:42,219
Just switch to guaranteeing

1613
00:37:42,219 --> 00:37:42,679
clients.

1614
00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:44,630
He rocketed it up to $45,000 per

1615
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:45,980
month in a couple months.

1616
00:37:45,989 --> 00:37:47,639
So he was able to do this because

1617
00:37:47,639 --> 00:37:48,969
he put a call closing rate

1618
00:37:48,969 --> 00:37:50,710
stipulation in his contract.

1619
00:37:50,789 --> 00:37:52,070
So his clients have to close at

1620
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:53,480
least 15% of the calls.

1621
00:37:53,489 --> 00:37:54,389
And if they don't, they're not

1622
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,300
eligible for a refund.

1623
00:37:55,309 --> 00:37:56,210
Like, that's how that works,

1624
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:56,559
right?

1625
00:37:57,269 --> 00:37:58,730
You screw this up by not having a

1626
00:37:58,730 --> 00:38:00,219
fundamental understanding of

1627
00:38:00,219 --> 00:38:01,320
exponential math.

1628
00:38:01,329 --> 00:38:05,000
Like, 27 times is fucking

1629
00:38:05,059 --> 00:38:06,960
astounding.

1630
00:38:06,969 --> 00:38:08,820
Like, you have to do this, right?

1631
00:38:08,829 --> 00:38:09,820
So, like, ListKit has a money-back

1632
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:10,320
guarantee.

1633
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:11,079
ClientSuch has a money-back

1634
00:38:11,079 --> 00:38:11,519
guarantee.

1635
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:13,019
We hit $1.2 million a month.

1636
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:14,969
Why do you think we can get away

1637
00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:16,019
with this?

1638
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:17,570
Why do you think you can get away

1639
00:38:17,579 --> 00:38:19,320
with doing this and, like, even I

1640
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,300
can't, right?

1641
00:38:20,849 --> 00:38:22,260
So, contract stipulation.

1642
00:38:22,269 --> 00:38:23,320
When using guarantees, you have to

1643
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,099
protect yourself against

1644
00:38:24,099 --> 00:38:25,159
unjustified refund requests.

1645
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:26,070
So stipulations are things that

1646
00:38:26,119 --> 00:38:26,969
the client is required to do in

1647
00:38:26,969 --> 00:38:27,769
order to be eligible for the

1648
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:28,019
guarantee.

1649
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:28,670
There are two types of

1650
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:29,239
stipulations.

1651
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:30,699
There's a state stipulation.

1652
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:32,000
It means that the client must

1653
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:33,630
already have something in order to

1654
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:35,099
qualify for the guarantee.

1655
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:35,820
And then there's an action

1656
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:36,920
stipulation, which means the

1657
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:37,940
client must do specific or

1658
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,269
multiple action items in order to

1659
00:38:39,269 --> 00:38:40,659
qualify for the guarantee.

1660
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:42,909
So, the stipulation should be

1661
00:38:42,909 --> 00:38:45,070
generated based off of what is

1662
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:47,840
required to get the result anyway.

1663
00:38:47,849 --> 00:38:48,960
You get what I'm saying?

1664
00:38:48,969 --> 00:38:50,250
So, like, as an example, let's say

1665
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:51,429
there's a content agency and the

1666
00:38:51,429 --> 00:38:52,639
offer is 10 clients signed per

1667
00:38:52,699 --> 00:38:53,900
month or your money-back.

1668
00:38:53,909 --> 00:38:54,610
Okay, so what are the

1669
00:38:54,619 --> 00:38:55,280
stipulations?

1670
00:38:55,289 --> 00:38:56,670
The client must stay subscribed to

1671
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:58,000
the service for a minimum of three

1672
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,119
months before he paid.

1673
00:38:59,130 --> 00:38:59,980
Non-payment that results in

1674
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:01,059
cancellation of the service before

1675
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:01,880
three months have elaps

1676
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:02,949
automatically makes the money-back

1677
00:39:02,949 --> 00:39:03,820
guarantee null and void.

1678
00:39:03,829 --> 00:39:05,599
Client must film 90 video scripts

1679
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:07,150
provided by the company and allow

1680
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:08,309
us to post all of them in TikTok,

1681
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:09,880
Instagram, LinkedIn, YouTube, and

1682
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:10,139
X.

1683
00:39:11,659 --> 00:39:11,659
If the client's accounts are

1684
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:13,099
banned or suspended, the client is

1685
00:39:13,099 --> 00:39:14,260
no longer eligible for the

1686
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,039
guarantee.

1687
00:39:15,090 --> 00:39:16,239
Client must respond to at least

1688
00:39:16,239 --> 00:39:17,530
50% of the comments made in the

1689
00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:18,000
videos.

1690
00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:19,079
Clients must have a guarantee on

1691
00:39:19,079 --> 00:39:19,940
their own offer that they're

1692
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:21,090
promoting in order to be eligible

1693
00:39:21,199 --> 00:39:22,400
for the money-back guarantee.

1694
00:39:22,409 --> 00:39:23,380
You don't have to put this.

1695
00:39:23,389 --> 00:39:24,079
You can remove this.

1696
00:39:24,090 --> 00:39:25,460
Client must maintain a minimum

1697
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:27,159
sales call closing rate of 15% and

1698
00:39:27,159 --> 00:39:28,650
give company access to their call

1699
00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:30,090
scheduling software in order to

1700
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:31,889
audit the amount of calls booked.

1701
00:39:31,909 --> 00:39:32,719
If a client fails to close at

1702
00:39:32,719 --> 00:39:33,690
least 15% of the total calls

1703
00:39:33,690 --> 00:39:34,889
booked within the 90-day period,

1704
00:39:34,889 --> 00:39:35,769
the money-back guarantee is null

1705
00:39:35,909 --> 00:39:36,389
and void.

1706
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:37,730
This is to deter against the

1707
00:39:37,730 --> 00:39:39,030
situation where the project is

1708
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:40,329
considered a failure when, in

1709
00:39:40,329 --> 00:39:41,730
fact, it is a sales problem which

1710
00:39:41,730 --> 00:39:43,260
the company has no control over.

1711
00:39:43,269 --> 00:39:44,289
If a client wishes to request a

1712
00:39:44,289 --> 00:39:45,449
refund, then it must provide all

1713
00:39:45,449 --> 00:39:46,489
recordings of all sales calls

1714
00:39:46,489 --> 00:39:47,530
booked inside the scheduling

1715
00:39:47,570 --> 00:39:48,849
platform in order for the company

1716
00:39:48,849 --> 00:39:50,070
to audit whether the clients were

1717
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:50,719
closed or not.

1718
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:51,159
Right?

1719
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:52,980
This is what's required to get the

1720
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:54,400
client a result fucking anyway.

1721
00:39:54,409 --> 00:39:54,719
Right?

1722
00:39:54,730 --> 00:39:56,250
So it's not unreasonable.

1723
00:39:56,269 --> 00:39:58,610
It's quite literally just what has

1724
00:39:58,610 --> 00:40:00,380
to be done for the result to

1725
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:02,010
happen fucking anyway.

1726
00:40:02,289 --> 00:40:04,210
Like, how else are 10 clients

1727
00:40:04,349 --> 00:40:05,889
signed per month with content

1728
00:40:05,889 --> 00:40:07,829
beyond fucking getting the videos

1729
00:40:07,829 --> 00:40:09,639
filmed and actually posting the

1730
00:40:09,639 --> 00:40:10,340
videos?

1731
00:40:10,349 --> 00:40:12,019
Like, and closing the calls?

1732
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:13,949
Like, how else does that happen?

1733
00:40:15,789 --> 00:40:16,829
In the end, it's that it fucking

1734
00:40:16,829 --> 00:40:17,260
doesn't.

1735
00:40:17,269 --> 00:40:17,469
Right?

1736
00:40:17,489 --> 00:40:18,880
So you can set, you can do other

1737
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:19,300
shit.

1738
00:40:19,309 --> 00:40:20,500
Like, you can set the contract up

1739
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:21,730
in a fashion where, like, if they

1740
00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:22,960
do request a refund, it's given on

1741
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:23,789
a tiered system.

1742
00:40:23,869 --> 00:40:25,780
So, like, if they only close 25

1743
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:27,400
clients total, then they get a

1744
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,599
16.7% refund or some bullshit.

1745
00:40:29,809 --> 00:40:30,079
Right?

1746
00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:30,599
Like that.

1747
00:40:30,610 --> 00:40:30,860
Right?

1748
00:40:30,869 --> 00:40:32,409
So, like, adding stipulations

1749
00:40:32,469 --> 00:40:33,869
typically does not decrease

1750
00:40:33,869 --> 00:40:35,199
conversion rates if all the

1751
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:36,840
stipulations are reasonable.

1752
00:40:36,969 --> 00:40:38,489
So that is why, so, because the

1753
00:40:38,489 --> 00:40:39,980
stipulations need to be what's

1754
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:41,670
required in the first place.

1755
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:41,820
Right?

1756
00:40:41,829 --> 00:40:43,380
You should expect to not exceed,

1757
00:40:43,429 --> 00:40:45,119
like, a 2% to 3% refund rate.

1758
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:46,489
If your client communication is on

1759
00:40:46,489 --> 00:40:47,909
point and you give status updates,

1760
00:40:47,909 --> 00:40:49,280
like, three more times a week,

1761
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,289
your refund rate would typically

1762
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:50,920
be less than 1%.

1763
00:40:51,090 --> 00:40:52,400
So this is just my own experience,

1764
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,690
given that every single offer I've

1765
00:40:53,739 --> 00:40:55,250
ever got past 100K a month has had

1766
00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:56,460
a money-back guarantee.

1767
00:40:56,469 --> 00:40:57,900
I've actually never gotten an

1768
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:59,789
offer past 100K a month without a

1769
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,170
money-back guarantee.

1770
00:41:02,329 --> 00:41:04,730
So watching over, like, 1,000

1771
00:41:04,730 --> 00:41:06,670
agency owners come through Client

1772
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:08,110
Ascension, it typically works out

1773
00:41:08,110 --> 00:41:09,289
that the people with a guarantee

1774
00:41:09,369 --> 00:41:10,380
grow somewhere in the range of,

1775
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:11,719
like, three to four times faster.

1776
00:41:11,730 --> 00:41:12,000
Right?

1777
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:13,159
So to visualize this, this is the

1778
00:41:13,159 --> 00:41:14,550
difference between, like, starting

1779
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:15,789
at 5K a month or reaching 50K a

1780
00:41:15,789 --> 00:41:17,000
month at two years versus reaching

1781
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,320
50K a month at six months.

1782
00:41:18,329 --> 00:41:19,099
Right?

1783
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:20,659
So let's talk about some quick

1784
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:22,000
value propositions and

1785
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,239
differentiation.

1786
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:24,250
So, like, a value proposition

1787
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:25,190
means it's, like, you're quite

1788
00:41:25,309 --> 00:41:26,340
literally proposing something of

1789
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,440
high value and a differentiation

1790
00:41:27,489 --> 00:41:28,409
is you quite literally actually

1791
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:28,989
are different.

1792
00:41:29,289 --> 00:41:29,840
Right?

1793
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:31,090
So if you're ever confused, if

1794
00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:32,340
you're actually differentiated,

1795
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:33,550
literally just ask, am I actually

1796
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:34,590
different than all the people

1797
00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:35,719
selling what I'm selling?

1798
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:36,480
So here's some examples of

1799
00:41:36,489 --> 00:41:37,139
differentiation.

1800
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:38,219
One is using AI.

1801
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:39,679
So, like, making hundreds of ad

1802
00:41:39,679 --> 00:41:40,900
creators extremely fast or

1803
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:42,090
creating content without the

1804
00:41:42,239 --> 00:41:43,550
client needing to sit down and

1805
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:44,619
film themselves.

1806
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:44,880
Right?

1807
00:41:44,889 --> 00:41:46,829
One-time payment, like, setup

1808
00:41:46,949 --> 00:41:48,559
offers are literally saying

1809
00:41:48,559 --> 00:41:50,590
one-time payment increases cause

1810
00:41:50,599 --> 00:41:51,840
book 2 to 3x.

1811
00:41:51,869 --> 00:41:53,420
However, this requires you having

1812
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:54,630
sales skills and back-end

1813
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:56,230
infrastructure to properly work an

1814
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:57,590
upsell process to get them onto

1815
00:41:57,590 --> 00:41:58,820
recurring services.

1816
00:41:59,309 --> 00:42:00,519
Three is results-based pricing.

1817
00:42:00,530 --> 00:42:01,670
Again, going back to guarantees,

1818
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:02,650
you only pay when it works.

1819
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:03,480
Performance-based is money-back

1820
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:03,900
guarantee.

1821
00:42:03,909 --> 00:42:04,880
You get results or you don't pay.

1822
00:42:04,889 --> 00:42:05,860
Like, just fucking do this.

1823
00:42:05,869 --> 00:42:07,809
Just, this is your differentiator.

1824
00:42:07,909 --> 00:42:09,170
Daniel, how can I be different?

1825
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:09,780
The answer is this.

1826
00:42:09,789 --> 00:42:10,280
Have a guarantee.

1827
00:42:10,289 --> 00:42:11,280
Like, that's it.

1828
00:42:11,289 --> 00:42:14,500
So, what else makes you different?

1829
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:15,800
It's that the client has to do

1830
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:16,960
less work than they would

1831
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,860
ordinarily with their competitors.

1832
00:42:18,969 --> 00:42:20,510
So, that means you, the logistical

1833
00:42:20,519 --> 00:42:22,050
intensity thing, like, you capture

1834
00:42:22,159 --> 00:42:23,530
more logistical intensity.

1835
00:42:23,570 --> 00:42:24,960
Client will get results faster at

1836
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,260
working with you and the client

1837
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:27,829
incurs less risk working with you.

1838
00:42:27,849 --> 00:42:28,750
So, that's a guarantee, right?

1839
00:42:28,809 --> 00:42:30,519
Quick prompt here, if you want to

1840
00:42:30,519 --> 00:42:31,889
throw this into AI to help you

1841
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,219
differentiate it.

1842
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:34,510
You could take all of the text in

1843
00:42:34,519 --> 00:42:35,980
this document, throw it into AI,

1844
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:37,949
or you can just talk to Daniel AI

1845
00:42:38,050 --> 00:42:39,440
to talk about this.

1846
00:42:39,449 --> 00:42:39,800
You get what I'm saying?

1847
00:42:39,809 --> 00:42:40,920
All right, that's it for the next

1848
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:41,260
video.

1849
00:42:41,269 --> 00:42:42,139
Let's move on to the next one.

1850
00:42:42,210 --> 00:42:42,360
Peace.
