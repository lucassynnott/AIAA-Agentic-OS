1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:01,409
All right, so let's talk about

2
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:02,730
demand capture versus demand

3
00:00:02,839 --> 00:00:03,439
generation.

4
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:05,080
So you've got a spectrum here.

5
00:00:05,089 --> 00:00:06,169
So every offer sits on a sliding

6
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:07,480
scale of demand capture versus

7
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:08,439
demand generation.

8
00:00:08,449 --> 00:00:10,519
A demand capture offer is an offer

9
00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:12,339
that somebody will only buy if

10
00:00:12,349 --> 00:00:13,439
they're already looking for it.

11
00:00:13,449 --> 00:00:14,859
And a demand generation offer is

12
00:00:14,859 --> 00:00:16,120
an offer where you can create

13
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:16,820
demand for.

14
00:00:16,829 --> 00:00:17,780
So like, let me give you some

15
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:19,100
examples of demand capture offers.

16
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:22,120
Website, you need to rent a bounce

17
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,899
house for a party.

18
00:00:23,949 --> 00:00:25,609
In what situation are you, is

19
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:27,429
someone going to convince you to

20
00:00:27,429 --> 00:00:29,859
rent a bounce house when you don't

21
00:00:29,879 --> 00:00:30,969
have an immediate need for a

22
00:00:30,969 --> 00:00:32,079
bounce house already?

23
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:34,039
Like, you can't like convince me

24
00:00:34,039 --> 00:00:35,929
to fucking get a bounce house if I

25
00:00:35,929 --> 00:00:38,030
wasn't already having a children's

26
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:39,039
house party.

27
00:00:39,049 --> 00:00:39,579
You get what I'm saying?

28
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:41,200
Like, so IT services, you're a

29
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,880
real estate agent and want people

30
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,500
to get their home, to list their

31
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,420
homes with you.

32
00:00:45,429 --> 00:00:46,840
Like, you're not going to convince

33
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,210
people to sell their fucking house

34
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:49,509
if they weren't already going to

35
00:00:49,509 --> 00:00:50,530
sell their house.

36
00:00:50,549 --> 00:00:51,380
You get what I'm saying?

37
00:00:51,469 --> 00:00:53,119
Like, insurance, like you don't

38
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:54,939
buy car insurance unless you have,

39
00:00:54,939 --> 00:00:56,320
unless you just purchased a car

40
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,520
and you're in immediate need for a

41
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:57,929
new car.

42
00:00:57,950 --> 00:00:59,590
Recruiting, automations, build

43
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:01,140
outs, bookkeeping, inventory

44
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:02,789
management, code base, security

45
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:04,439
auditing, task management, data

46
00:01:04,459 --> 00:01:06,060
entry, data extraction, credit

47
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:06,959
card process.

48
00:01:06,969 --> 00:01:07,640
You get what I'm saying?

49
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,189
I'm just spewing random shit here

50
00:01:09,189 --> 00:01:10,650
so you get the premise of like,

51
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:12,230
you can't just fucking create the

52
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:13,519
demand for it, right?

53
00:01:13,549 --> 00:01:15,400
So examples of demand generation

54
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,109
offers where you can just spawn

55
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,870
demand for it is getting people

56
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,420
more leads to Facebook ads,

57
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:21,760
building funnels, converting more

58
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,680
free trial users with email

59
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,799
marketing, helping people get

60
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:25,000
leads and clients from Twitter,

61
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:26,480
LinkedIn automated outreach to

62
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,019
generate leads to clients, UGC ad

63
00:01:28,019 --> 00:01:29,370
creatives, influencer marketing,

64
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,420
content production offers,

65
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:31,670
cold calling lead gen, cold email

66
00:01:31,769 --> 00:01:33,209
lead gen, Facebook, Google, TikTok

67
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:34,000
ads, webinars.

68
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:34,760
You get what I'm saying?

69
00:01:35,329 --> 00:01:37,950
So you can like convince people to

70
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:39,500
do this, right?

71
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:40,780
People only buy this if they have

72
00:01:40,849 --> 00:01:42,349
already personally decided that's

73
00:01:42,349 --> 00:01:43,859
what they're going to purchase.

74
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:45,920
So your offer falls on a scale.

75
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:47,420
It can exist at any point.

76
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:48,780
It can be like, it can be in the

77
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:49,700
center, right?

78
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:51,120
So like, I've seen some random

79
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,299
shit like this before.

80
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:53,340
Discord community creation.

81
00:01:53,349 --> 00:01:54,439
I hope you grow your business by

82
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,739
creating a Discord community for

83
00:01:55,739 --> 00:01:56,060
you.

84
00:01:56,069 --> 00:01:56,719
That would be like somewhere in

85
00:01:56,739 --> 00:01:57,060
the center.

86
00:01:57,069 --> 00:01:58,120
Conversion rate optimization is

87
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,019
somewhere in the center.

88
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:01,049
Organic YouTube management would

89
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:02,420
be somewhere in the center.

90
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:04,379
But if you like, if you took this

91
00:02:04,379 --> 00:02:05,799
and turn it into like a content

92
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:07,200
production offer with like a

93
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,000
quantifiable claim,

94
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:09,280
you're shifting it towards the

95
00:02:09,349 --> 00:02:10,860
left to, I'm sorry, you're

96
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:11,780
shifting it towards the right in

97
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:12,479
demand generation.

98
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:15,199
SEO, public relations, ad writing,

99
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:16,810
and designing video production

100
00:02:16,909 --> 00:02:18,530
without it being among a content

101
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:19,620
production system

102
00:02:19,629 --> 00:02:20,680
intended to produce new clients.

103
00:02:20,689 --> 00:02:22,610
So like when you start slapping

104
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:24,539
like quantifiable results and

105
00:02:24,539 --> 00:02:26,180
guarantees, you're shifting it

106
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,020
towards demand gen.

107
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:28,490
So now let's talk about this real

108
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:29,639
quick is mechanisms.

109
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,300
So a demand capture mechanism is

110
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,879
something like Google ads.

111
00:02:32,889 --> 00:02:34,520
So if you know, like Google search

112
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,289
ads, right?

113
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:36,150
So you get in front of people

114
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:37,259
actively searching for it.

115
00:02:37,289 --> 00:02:39,020
It means you're quite literally

116
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:40,240
capturing demand.

117
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:42,199
Where it's like, if I have an AC

118
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:44,159
unit and my AC unit goes out and I

119
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,699
search up like HVAC repair Tampa,

120
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:48,389
what does that mean?

121
00:02:48,409 --> 00:02:49,659
It means that like the people

122
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,259
buying Google ads on that search

123
00:02:51,259 --> 00:02:52,719
term are capturing demand as it

124
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:53,680
flows, right?

125
00:02:53,689 --> 00:02:55,400
Demand generation mechanism is

126
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,919
something like cold email or

127
00:02:56,919 --> 00:02:58,919
Facebook ads or cold email or DMs.

128
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:00,800
You're interrupting somebody.

129
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:02,060
So you're quite literally trying

130
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:03,210
to generate the demand, not

131
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:03,800
capture it.

132
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:05,330
So if I get a cold email or a cold

133
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:06,849
DM from somebody, I've been

134
00:03:06,849 --> 00:03:07,699
interrupted.

135
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:09,719
If I get a Facebook ad, I've been

136
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:10,539
interrupted.

137
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:12,120
Now, Facebook ads are a little

138
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,719
different nowadays because of

139
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:15,250
what's called advantage plus

140
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:16,500
targeting or just like AI

141
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,840
targeting where you can have a

142
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,180
demand capture offer and use

143
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,500
Facebook ads.

144
00:03:22,509 --> 00:03:24,590
And it just like reads the ad and

145
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:26,949
finds people who are interested in

146
00:03:26,949 --> 00:03:28,229
that right now.

147
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:29,870
It just does that automatically

148
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:30,219
now.

149
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,050
So it's kind of a demand

150
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:34,189
generation mechanism, kind of a

151
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:36,229
demand capture mechanism.

152
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:37,870
Facebook ads could be used as

153
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:39,469
demand gen or demand capture

154
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:41,439
because of their AI targeting.

155
00:03:41,449 --> 00:03:43,240
No, don't get confused when I put

156
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,009
something like Google ads in here

157
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:46,810
as a mechanism when I already put

158
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:47,840
it as an offer.

159
00:03:47,849 --> 00:03:49,460
So like when that was listed as an

160
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:50,900
offer, I mean Google ads as a

161
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:51,509
service.

162
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:52,780
In this mechanism section, it's

163
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:53,930
categorized as meaning like a

164
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:55,229
means of acquiring traffic.

165
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,030
So now sometimes you're selling a

166
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,629
demand capture offer with the

167
00:03:58,629 --> 00:04:00,340
demand generation mechanism,

168
00:04:00,379 --> 00:04:00,949
right?

169
00:04:00,969 --> 00:04:02,569
So if you want to sell a demand

170
00:04:02,569 --> 00:04:04,530
capture offer like web design with

171
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,460
the demand generation mechanism

172
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:08,479
like cold email, you can only do

173
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:09,500
three things.

174
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:10,650
And these three things only,

175
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:11,949
there's no other way to do this,

176
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:12,500
right?

177
00:04:13,349 --> 00:04:15,159
So extremely high volume and in an

178
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:16,910
attempt to just by happenstance

179
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,680
find somebody who already needs

180
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,620
one, right?

181
00:04:19,629 --> 00:04:21,529
So if you're trying to sell web

182
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:23,699
design with cold email, but web

183
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:26,089
design is a demand capture offer.

184
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:27,720
So you would just need to send a

185
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,339
fuck ton of cold email, like a

186
00:04:29,339 --> 00:04:30,970
fucking insane amount of it,

187
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:31,620
right?

188
00:04:31,629 --> 00:04:32,870
So second is positioning your

189
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:34,220
offer to be unique and therefore

190
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:35,470
more on the demand generation

191
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:35,860
side.

192
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:36,959
So it's just morphing it to demand

193
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:37,519
gen side.

194
00:04:38,889 --> 00:04:40,459
Outreaching to prospects based off

195
00:04:40,459 --> 00:04:41,899
demand capture indicators.

196
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:43,860
So like an example would be you're

197
00:04:43,899 --> 00:04:45,709
trying to sell IT services and

198
00:04:45,709 --> 00:04:47,170
you're somehow able to scrape data

199
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:48,589
that somebody just had a security

200
00:04:48,589 --> 00:04:49,120
breach.

201
00:04:49,129 --> 00:04:52,500
That would be like an indicator.

202
00:04:52,509 --> 00:04:53,060
You get what I'm saying?

203
00:04:53,069 --> 00:04:54,170
So if you're trying to sell a

204
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:55,410
demand capture offer using a

205
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:56,819
demand generation mechanism,

206
00:04:56,829 --> 00:04:58,300
what you need to be doing in your

207
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,810
marketing is selling first the

208
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:01,250
concept of why they would want

209
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:03,040
your offer in the first place.

210
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:04,129
So like for instance, every

211
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:05,449
business owner on the planet wants

212
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,180
more clients.

213
00:05:06,269 --> 00:05:07,629
If you're selling lead generation

214
00:05:07,629 --> 00:05:08,939
services, you don't need to make

215
00:05:08,939 --> 00:05:10,110
an ad that's trying to convince

216
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:11,209
somebody why they need to get more

217
00:05:11,209 --> 00:05:12,220
clients for their business.

218
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:13,139
Like it's fucking

219
00:05:13,149 --> 00:05:14,360
self-explanatory.

220
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:15,319
They already want that, right?

221
00:05:15,329 --> 00:05:16,430
So if you're selling life

222
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:18,000
insurance and you're trying to do

223
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,490
it with a mechanism like content

224
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:20,910
marketing or Facebook ads,

225
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:22,170
which are demand generation

226
00:05:22,269 --> 00:05:22,879
mechanisms,

227
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:25,089
you have to start by convincing

228
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:26,959
people why they need life

229
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:29,079
insurance in the first place

230
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,300
before selling them your life

231
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,329
insurance.

232
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:32,759
You get what I'm saying?

233
00:05:32,769 --> 00:05:33,870
So this is often why you hear

234
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:35,379
about the difference between like

235
00:05:35,379 --> 00:05:36,899
first mover's advantage and second

236
00:05:36,899 --> 00:05:38,000
mover's advantage.

237
00:05:38,009 --> 00:05:39,959
The first mover must convince the

238
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:41,810
market why they should buy into

239
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:43,980
the idea and why they should use

240
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:45,790
their solution for it.

241
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:46,860
The second mover only has to

242
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,209
convince the market their solution

243
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:49,620
is better than the first mover.

244
00:05:49,629 --> 00:05:50,730
You get what I'm saying?

245
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:53,019
So earlier, like one of these

246
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,850
things that said extremely high

247
00:05:54,939 --> 00:05:56,230
volume, what does that mean,

248
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:56,560
right?

249
00:05:56,569 --> 00:05:57,569
So if you're selling a demand

250
00:05:57,569 --> 00:05:58,420
generation offer with a

251
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,750
quantifiable promise and guarantee

252
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:00,420
in social work,

253
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:01,699
you can typically get around one

254
00:06:01,769 --> 00:06:03,569
client for your 1,000 prospects

255
00:06:03,569 --> 00:06:04,839
contacted via cold email.

256
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:07,470
Well, maybe like depending on some

257
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:11,589
other things like 1,000 to 3,000,

258
00:06:11,589 --> 00:06:12,420
right?

259
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:17,389
Maybe like in probably every 50 or

260
00:06:17,389 --> 00:06:22,339
so Dream 100 outreaches if your

261
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:25,079
scripts are good.

262
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:33,449
So if you're doing Dream 100 and

263
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:36,990
you do like 50 of them, it's like

264
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,029
there's a considerable bottom of a

265
00:06:38,149 --> 00:06:38,490
follow-up.

266
00:06:38,529 --> 00:06:39,560
It's not like, oh, I hit number

267
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:39,959
50.

268
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:40,939
Number 50 converts.

269
00:06:40,949 --> 00:06:42,629
Like it's like some random person

270
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,160
within the 50 who you have

271
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,100
executed sufficient follow-up over

272
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,680
sufficient quantities of time will

273
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,720
probably convert, right?

274
00:06:49,829 --> 00:06:51,079
So now if you're selling demand

275
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:52,449
capture, the numbers will hang

276
00:06:52,449 --> 00:06:53,899
somewhere between like one client

277
00:06:53,899 --> 00:06:55,910
for every 5,000 to 20,000

278
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:56,579
prospects.

279
00:06:56,589 --> 00:06:58,649
So like here's just an example of

280
00:06:58,649 --> 00:06:59,240
this.

281
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:00,519
So like Cameron Tarbell, yeah, it

282
00:07:00,589 --> 00:07:02,079
looks like every 20K prospects was

283
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:03,180
a new client more or less.

284
00:07:03,209 --> 00:07:04,009
I haven't ran cold in like four

285
00:07:04,009 --> 00:07:04,310
months.

286
00:07:04,389 --> 00:07:05,480
So I have deals closing from the

287
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,730
campaigns I ran from November to

288
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:07,139
March.

289
00:07:07,149 --> 00:07:09,689
So like Cameron sells web design,

290
00:07:09,689 --> 00:07:10,459
right?

291
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:13,560
So for every 20,000 people that

292
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,000
Cameron contacts is able to sell,

293
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,620
just a standard website, right?

294
00:07:19,829 --> 00:07:21,019
Aaron Price or demand capture, and

295
00:07:21,029 --> 00:07:22,170
I've been incorrectly stressing

296
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:23,240
we're not hitting one client per

297
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,300
1,000 emails.

298
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:26,470
We're around one client per 5,000

299
00:07:26,569 --> 00:07:28,839
contacts, 20,000 emails, which

300
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:29,699
makes sense.

301
00:07:29,709 --> 00:07:30,720
Just need to send more emails,

302
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,060
right?

303
00:07:31,069 --> 00:07:32,949
So how do you position your demand

304
00:07:32,949 --> 00:07:34,620
capture offer to be unique?

305
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:35,829
So this is point number two.

306
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:36,879
How do you position your demand

307
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:37,819
capture offer to be unique and

308
00:07:37,819 --> 00:07:39,240
morphed towards demand generation?

309
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,079
Let's go to two examples.

310
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:41,000
So like web design as a for

311
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,439
instance.

312
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:43,279
One is like, I'll make you a

313
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:44,100
website.

314
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:44,899
All right, cool.

315
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:46,519
Well, something better would be,

316
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:47,310
I'll make you a website with

317
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:48,459
internal fraud monitoring software

318
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:49,259
to stop chargebacks.

319
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:49,779
That's one.

320
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:50,860
Even better would be, I guarantee

321
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:51,810
you'll increase your website

322
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:52,699
conversion rates or you get a

323
00:07:52,699 --> 00:07:53,160
refund.

324
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:53,819
That's even better.

325
00:07:53,829 --> 00:07:55,470
Best would be like, I'll build you

326
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:56,860
a VSL opt-in funnel, run cold

327
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,329
traffic to it, and guarantee you

328
00:07:58,329 --> 00:07:59,899
may get your next $30,000 in sales

329
00:07:59,899 --> 00:08:00,610
or you don't pay.

330
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:01,860
Right?

331
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:03,259
So this is like, this turns into a

332
00:08:03,259 --> 00:08:04,699
completely different offer.

333
00:08:04,709 --> 00:08:05,699
You're not a web design business

334
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:06,120
anymore.

335
00:08:06,129 --> 00:08:07,319
You're a funnels business, right?

336
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:09,250
So recruiting is, I can recruit

337
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:10,910
software engineers for your

338
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,800
business.

339
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:12,800
Better would be, I can recruit a

340
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,680
software engineer for your

341
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,579
business who can create an AI

342
00:08:14,579 --> 00:08:15,839
model based on your data, meaning

343
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:16,879
you can create internal tech that

344
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:17,959
can automate customer service.

345
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:20,129
Best would be, I'll create an AI

346
00:08:20,129 --> 00:08:21,310
model based on all your customer

347
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:22,600
data that automates your entire

348
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,920
customer service division.

349
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:25,629
So it turns into, it's an entirely

350
00:08:25,629 --> 00:08:26,800
different product.

351
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:27,899
It's not even recruiting anymore.

352
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:29,399
You get what I'm saying?

353
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:31,680
This would just work better on

354
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:32,538
cold traffic.

355
00:08:32,548 --> 00:08:33,480
This would work better on cold

356
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:33,899
traffic.

357
00:08:33,908 --> 00:08:35,720
You know what I'm saying?

358
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:39,288
Like, you have the ability to just

359
00:08:39,389 --> 00:08:42,679
turn your offer into something

360
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:46,779
that is designed for cold traffic.

361
00:08:46,789 --> 00:08:48,590
You don't have a business unless

362
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:50,059
you're able to sell to cold

363
00:08:50,059 --> 00:08:51,309
traffic, right?

364
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:53,860
It's almost like being a guy and

365
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:56,250
like having the ability to just

366
00:08:56,309 --> 00:08:58,830
become six foot four, right?

367
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:00,789
It's completely fucking retarded

368
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:02,759
for you to just, and like, I'm not

369
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:04,360
six foot four, right?

370
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:06,220
Like, I'm fucking five foot eight,

371
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:06,720
right?

372
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:09,059
There's, there's, it's completely

373
00:09:09,059 --> 00:09:11,759
fucking retarded to like have this

374
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:15,330
ability to just morph your offer

375
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:16,830
into something that is better for

376
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:17,539
cold traffic.

377
00:09:17,549 --> 00:09:19,269
And then actively choosing to not

378
00:09:19,269 --> 00:09:19,710
do it.

379
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:22,100
It's just, it's just an advantage.

380
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:24,399
Like, yeah, you can get by without

381
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,549
doing it, but you're not getting

382
00:09:26,549 --> 00:09:28,519
profoundly fucking rich.

383
00:09:28,529 --> 00:09:31,190
It's just like completely fucking

384
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:33,059
stupid to not do that.

385
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:34,809
You get like, like, why are you

386
00:09:34,809 --> 00:09:36,649
actively choosing to make things

387
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,519
more difficult for yourself?

388
00:09:38,529 --> 00:09:40,370
It's kind of like, it's kind of

389
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:42,370
like where it's like, you always

390
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:44,659
want to use what you have, right?

391
00:09:44,669 --> 00:09:46,129
So I'll give you, for instance,

392
00:09:46,129 --> 00:09:47,379
like, um, there's this one

393
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:48,950
interview with Donald Trump where

394
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:50,149
it's like, oh yeah, my dad gave me

395
00:09:50,149 --> 00:09:51,700
a small loan of a million dollars.

396
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:53,370
And like people started clowning

397
00:09:53,389 --> 00:09:55,070
on him for like, oh, a small loan

398
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:56,440
for a million dollars.

399
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:57,059
You know what I mean?

400
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:58,730
Like, yeah, like I get it where

401
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,600
it's like, yeah, Donald, you had

402
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,259
this fucking privilege and you

403
00:10:02,259 --> 00:10:03,539
could just do that.

404
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:04,639
Like people can't just do that.

405
00:10:04,649 --> 00:10:06,960
Like, yes, which is true, but he

406
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,240
would be a complete fucking retard

407
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,169
to not take the small loan of a

408
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,620
million dollars.

409
00:10:12,629 --> 00:10:14,580
Like, why would he not do that?

410
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:17,190
Like, use all of the advantages

411
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:19,970
that you could possibly muster for

412
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:22,950
yourself, regardless of how unfair

413
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:25,639
that is to the general public.

414
00:10:25,789 --> 00:10:27,919
Who gives a fuck about the general

415
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:28,659
public?

416
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:29,659
They didn't go fuck themselves.

417
00:10:29,669 --> 00:10:31,830
Like, you're the main character of

418
00:10:31,929 --> 00:10:33,039
your business.

419
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:35,830
Like, use every advantage you can

420
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:38,419
possibly muster for yourself to

421
00:10:38,419 --> 00:10:41,179
make your life as easy as possible

422
00:10:41,179 --> 00:10:42,809
and increase your probability of

423
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:44,259
success to the highest degree

424
00:10:44,259 --> 00:10:45,179
conceivable.

425
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:45,779
You get what I'm saying?

426
00:10:46,049 --> 00:10:46,879
So, all right, cool.

427
00:10:46,929 --> 00:10:48,429
So, next, that third point is how

428
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,879
do you outreach prospects based

429
00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:51,620
off of demand capture indicators?

430
00:10:51,629 --> 00:10:53,100
One would be like they're hiring

431
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,690
for a specific role, in which case

432
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:56,129
it might look something like an

433
00:10:56,129 --> 00:10:57,240
outreach message.

434
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:58,080
It might say something like, I saw

435
00:10:58,169 --> 00:10:58,860
you were hiring for customer

436
00:10:58,860 --> 00:10:59,399
service roles.

437
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:00,500
Given that, I can create an AI

438
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,809
model based on every conversation

439
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:02,860
your CS team has ever had and

440
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,000
automate your entire customer

441
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,019
service division.

442
00:11:05,029 --> 00:11:06,639
One, for instance, might be they

443
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:07,870
just installed a specific

444
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:08,590
technology.

445
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:09,860
So, you could say something like,

446
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:10,830
saw you guys were using Webflow

447
00:11:10,929 --> 00:11:11,559
for your site.

448
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:13,019
Have you considered building out

449
00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:14,480
VSL webinar funnels instead?

450
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:15,879
And then you could interject that

451
00:11:15,879 --> 00:11:17,379
same claim right here, that same,

452
00:11:17,379 --> 00:11:18,049
that thing.

453
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:19,450
Now, you might have another one

454
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:20,679
where it's like, if they're

455
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:21,980
following or interacting with

456
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,279
another company or person or

457
00:11:23,289 --> 00:11:24,159
social media.

458
00:11:24,169 --> 00:11:25,720
So, you might have something like,

459
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,940
saw you were interacting with

460
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:28,230
Hermosi's post, went to your

461
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:29,529
profile and figured this would

462
00:11:29,529 --> 00:11:30,279
make sense.

463
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:31,340
I can build you a full VSL opt-in

464
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,450
funnel and guarantee you make your

465
00:11:32,549 --> 00:11:34,080
next $30,000 in sales or you pay

466
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:34,639
nothing.

467
00:11:34,669 --> 00:11:36,299
So, let's talk about traffic

468
00:11:36,299 --> 00:11:37,820
generation versus traffic

469
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,139
conversion offers.

470
00:11:39,149 --> 00:11:40,970
This kind of applies to marketing

471
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:41,860
offers only.

472
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:43,789
So, traffic generation is like

473
00:11:43,789 --> 00:11:45,779
getting them traffic and traffic

474
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:47,570
conversion is converting the

475
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:48,370
traffic.

476
00:11:48,389 --> 00:11:49,220
So, it's traffic generation.

477
00:11:49,309 --> 00:11:50,039
It's everything to do with getting

478
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:50,840
you traffic in the first place.

479
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:52,070
So, that's like Facebook ads,

480
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:53,409
Google ads, YouTube ads, TikTok

481
00:11:53,409 --> 00:11:54,409
ads, cold email, content

482
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,570
marketing, direct message

483
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:56,200
outreach.

484
00:11:56,210 --> 00:12:00,039
So, just ads, content, outreach.

485
00:12:00,049 --> 00:12:00,820
Those are the only ways to

486
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:01,539
generate traffic.

487
00:12:01,549 --> 00:12:01,879
That's it.

488
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:03,870
There's no other way to do this,

489
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:05,659
like in existence at all.

490
00:12:05,669 --> 00:12:08,679
It's ads, outreach, and content.

491
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:09,159
That's it.

492
00:12:09,169 --> 00:12:09,799
Nothing else exists.

493
00:12:09,809 --> 00:12:11,490
Traffic conversion is everything

494
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,120
to do with converting the traffic

495
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,820
you or your client already has.

496
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:15,919
So, that's like email marketing.

497
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:18,039
Like, okay, you got someone to opt

498
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:19,789
in to a VSL, book a call funnel

499
00:12:19,789 --> 00:12:21,360
with your Facebook ads.

500
00:12:21,429 --> 00:12:22,159
So, now you need to use email

501
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:22,960
marketing to convert a higher

502
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,830
percentage of them, right?

503
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:24,340
It's sales.

504
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:25,179
It's the actual sales call.

505
00:12:25,269 --> 00:12:27,330
It's follow-up, conversion rate

506
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:28,830
optimization on pages,

507
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:30,779
copywriting, sales pages.

508
00:12:30,789 --> 00:12:33,460
So, like I'm color coding this.

509
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:34,720
So, like traffic generation is

510
00:12:34,809 --> 00:12:35,200
orange.

511
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:36,620
So, in order for your YouTube ads

512
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:37,759
to work, it's orange.

513
00:12:37,769 --> 00:12:38,600
It's traffic generation.

514
00:12:39,149 --> 00:12:39,919
In order for your traffic

515
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:40,929
generation slash YouTube ads to

516
00:12:40,929 --> 00:12:42,019
work, you need your email

517
00:12:42,019 --> 00:12:43,480
marketing, sales, follow-up, CRO,

518
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,309
and copywriting also to be, right?

519
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:46,950
So, your YouTube ads traffic won't

520
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:48,590
convert unless you have sufficient

521
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:50,429
email marketing, sales, follow-up,

522
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:51,720
CRO, and copywriting.

523
00:12:52,029 --> 00:12:52,970
Okay.

524
00:12:53,009 --> 00:12:54,039
But in order for your email

525
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:55,169
marketing to work, which is

526
00:12:55,269 --> 00:12:56,879
traffic conversion, in order for

527
00:12:56,879 --> 00:12:58,440
this to work, to be able to do

528
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,120
anything,

529
00:12:59,129 --> 00:13:00,350
you need to be getting traffic

530
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:01,669
from your Facebook ads, Google

531
00:13:01,669 --> 00:13:03,220
ads, YouTube ads, TikTok ads, cold

532
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,820
emails, and content marketing.

533
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:07,009
Like, your email marketing can't

534
00:13:07,009 --> 00:13:08,549
do anything if there isn't traffic

535
00:13:08,549 --> 00:13:09,559
being generated.

536
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:11,399
You get what I'm saying?

537
00:13:11,409 --> 00:13:12,759
So, in order to take somebody from

538
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:14,269
zero to paying money, they must be

539
00:13:14,269 --> 00:13:15,850
generated via traffic generation

540
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:17,029
and converted via traffic

541
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:17,820
conversion.

542
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:19,620
So, it's typically easier to sell

543
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:21,379
a traffic generation offer than a

544
00:13:21,379 --> 00:13:23,330
traffic conversion offer because

545
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:25,200
most people don't have traffic.

546
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:26,700
You know what I'm saying?

547
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:28,500
Like, I've kind of said this and

548
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,220
you'll hear me say it a lot, but

549
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:32,230
most people running businesses are

550
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:33,519
fucking retarded.

551
00:13:33,529 --> 00:13:34,799
Like, they don't have traffic,

552
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:35,279
right?

553
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:37,529
So, however, traffic conversion

554
00:13:37,629 --> 00:13:39,720
offers typically see clients that

555
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:42,059
stay longer and have a higher LTV.

556
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:42,559
Why?

557
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:44,519
Because the only people who buy it

558
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:46,269
are people who have their shit

559
00:13:46,269 --> 00:13:47,059
together.

560
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:48,299
Right?

561
00:13:48,309 --> 00:13:50,200
And there exist less people on the

562
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,690
planet who have their shit

563
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:53,539
together versus who don't.

564
00:13:53,549 --> 00:13:55,710
So, like, in exchange for it being

565
00:13:55,809 --> 00:13:57,730
more, in exchange for it, for

566
00:13:57,730 --> 00:13:59,820
this, in exchange for the client

567
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,549
LTV being higher on traffic

568
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:03,649
conversion offers, they're more

569
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,409
likely, they're more difficult to

570
00:14:05,409 --> 00:14:06,860
come across because less of them

571
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:08,470
exist and they require a higher

572
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:10,009
level of authority to sell as the

573
00:14:10,009 --> 00:14:11,559
nature of what you need access to

574
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:12,649
is more intimate.

575
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:12,940
Right?

576
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:16,740
So, like, it's not new money.

577
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:17,419
You get what I'm saying?

578
00:14:17,429 --> 00:14:18,980
Like, I've talked about this

579
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:20,600
before, but, like, selling

580
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,409
somebody email list management is

581
00:14:22,409 --> 00:14:23,399
not new money.

582
00:14:23,409 --> 00:14:24,759
It's more difficult to sell the

583
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:25,539
cold traffic.

584
00:14:25,549 --> 00:14:26,970
Selling someone's CRO is not new

585
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:27,460
money.

586
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:29,210
Selling them just copywriting

587
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:31,139
without, like, the creation of a

588
00:14:31,149 --> 00:14:33,019
funnel, it's not new money.

589
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:34,379
Right?

590
00:14:34,389 --> 00:14:37,740
You really, really, really want to

591
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,440
sell new money.

592
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:42,639
Like, it's fucking severely

593
00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:46,139
advantageous for you to sell new

594
00:14:46,139 --> 00:14:47,230
money.

595
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:49,629
And then traffic conversion

596
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:52,659
offers, where it's all this shit,

597
00:14:52,659 --> 00:14:55,370
is better, it's substantially

598
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:57,769
better to sell as an upsell to

599
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,480
people who have already paid you

600
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,259
something else.

601
00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:02,879
You get what I'm saying?

602
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:05,360
So, for offers within the

603
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,389
marketing arena, this is just kind

604
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,450
of, like, visualizing this.

605
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:10,659
So, like, a demand capture offer

606
00:15:10,669 --> 00:15:11,860
that's traffic conversion would

607
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,159
be, like, websites, or I'll write

608
00:15:13,159 --> 00:15:13,820
your emails.

609
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:15,100
A demand generation offer that's

610
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,389
traffic generation would be ads as

611
00:15:16,389 --> 00:15:17,440
a service, cold email as a

612
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:18,750
service, cold DMs as a service,

613
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,019
cold calling as a service.

614
00:15:20,029 --> 00:15:21,100
Demand generation offer that's

615
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,379
traffic conversion would be, like,

616
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:23,440
converting pretrial users with

617
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:24,220
email marketing.

618
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:26,179
When a market becomes sufficiently

619
00:15:26,179 --> 00:15:28,279
sophisticated, so, like, means,

620
00:15:28,279 --> 00:15:30,220
like, you get hella competitors or

621
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,039
saturated,

622
00:15:31,669 --> 00:15:33,279
all demand generation offers

623
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,139
become demand capture offers.

624
00:15:35,149 --> 00:15:36,240
So, like, for instance, I'll make

625
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:37,259
you a website.

626
00:15:37,389 --> 00:15:38,629
In 2001, it was a demand

627
00:15:38,629 --> 00:15:39,480
generation offer.

628
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:41,620
Now, it's a demand capture offer.

629
00:15:41,629 --> 00:15:43,000
So, it's called offer decay.

630
00:15:43,009 --> 00:15:44,110
It's what I call it.

631
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:46,009
It's, like, just as you get more

632
00:15:46,009 --> 00:15:48,009
competitors and time elapses, all

633
00:15:48,009 --> 00:15:49,269
demand generation offers become

634
00:15:49,269 --> 00:15:50,620
demand capture offers, right?

635
00:15:51,149 --> 00:15:52,230
So, this is effectively a battle

636
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,309
that will exist throughout your

637
00:15:53,409 --> 00:15:53,919
entire life.

638
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:55,059
At any point in time, your offer

639
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:56,289
is always decaying towards demand

640
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:56,940
generation.

641
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:58,779
This is exactly what will happen

642
00:15:58,779 --> 00:16:00,889
to AI automation, for instance.

643
00:16:00,929 --> 00:16:03,629
So, like, right now, AI automation

644
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:06,169
is technically a demand generation

645
00:16:06,169 --> 00:16:06,899
offer.

646
00:16:06,909 --> 00:16:09,259
But as time goes on, it will be a

647
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:11,019
demand capture offer that is

648
00:16:11,019 --> 00:16:13,059
profoundly fucking difficult to

649
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:13,690
sell.

650
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:15,870
So, this is why, this is literally

651
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:18,059
why I instruct everybody running

652
00:16:18,059 --> 00:16:19,950
that business to instead sell

653
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:21,909
specific builds, not AI

654
00:16:21,909 --> 00:16:24,580
automation, right?

655
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:26,179
Because specific builds can be

656
00:16:26,179 --> 00:16:27,909
pitched with specific results,

657
00:16:27,909 --> 00:16:29,379
therefore morphing it into a

658
00:16:29,429 --> 00:16:31,419
demand generation offer, right?

659
00:16:31,429 --> 00:16:33,379
So, like, expansion of service.

660
00:16:33,429 --> 00:16:34,269
Say you're selling a traffic

661
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:35,000
generation offer.

662
00:16:35,009 --> 00:16:36,250
So, it's, most people are only

663
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:37,860
selling one half of this equation.

664
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:39,080
I, like, and again, I'm

665
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:40,659
reiterating this is, like, kind of

666
00:16:40,659 --> 00:16:42,059
for marketing offers only.

667
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:44,830
Demand, they're selling demand

668
00:16:44,899 --> 00:16:47,809
generation, or they're selling,

669
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:49,779
I'm sorry, they're selling traffic

670
00:16:49,779 --> 00:16:50,710
generation, or they're selling

671
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:51,620
traffic conversion, right?

672
00:16:51,629 --> 00:16:52,710
So, most of the time, it's because

673
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:53,580
it's easier to get started,

674
00:16:53,629 --> 00:16:54,610
simpler to sell, it's easier to

675
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:55,789
get results quickly, requires less

676
00:16:55,789 --> 00:16:56,820
expertise in your own.

677
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:57,779
However, when selling one of the

678
00:16:57,779 --> 00:16:58,850
equation, you're creating your own

679
00:16:58,850 --> 00:16:59,789
customers to sell the other half

680
00:16:59,789 --> 00:17:00,389
of the equation.

681
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:02,419
So, in this slinging deals video,

682
00:17:02,419 --> 00:17:04,240
what I talked about was an example

683
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,930
of selling a webinar build-out

684
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:06,380
offer,

685
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:07,799
and how a component of that offer

686
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:09,500
could be email marketing, right?

687
00:17:09,509 --> 00:17:11,630
Now, so, like, you sold the client

688
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:13,700
a webinar funnel build with ads.

689
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:15,259
So, that would be, like, a demand

690
00:17:15,259 --> 00:17:16,430
generation slash traffic

691
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:17,480
generation offer.

692
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:19,109
And then, a recurring upsell to

693
00:17:19,109 --> 00:17:20,259
that offer is email list

694
00:17:20,318 --> 00:17:21,150
management.

695
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:22,210
So, email list management is a

696
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:23,299
traffic conversion offer.

697
00:17:23,309 --> 00:17:24,140
It's not new money, so it's

698
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:25,420
difficult to sell to cold traffic,

699
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:26,180
but it's difficult to,

700
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:27,269
but it's not difficult to sell to

701
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,589
warm traffic, because people have

702
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:29,420
already paid you.

703
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:31,259
So, like, again, I kind of walked

704
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:33,480
you through, like, if you sold

705
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,579
them a webinar funnel,

706
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:37,829
but now there's, like, a shit ton

707
00:17:37,829 --> 00:17:39,140
of people who registered to the

708
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:39,720
webinar.

709
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:40,829
You got, like, fucking 500 people

710
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,299
who registered the webinar, and

711
00:17:42,299 --> 00:17:45,259
now, like, you got those emails,

712
00:17:45,269 --> 00:17:46,519
and you could sell email list

713
00:17:46,609 --> 00:17:48,109
management where you send sales

714
00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:49,619
emails three to five times per

715
00:17:49,619 --> 00:17:49,980
week for them.

716
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:50,819
And now, let's say the client

717
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:52,099
wants to run another webinar back,

718
00:17:52,099 --> 00:17:53,180
and now it goes from the next

719
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:53,650
webinar,

720
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:54,750
it gets a fucking another 500

721
00:17:54,859 --> 00:17:55,200
people.

722
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:56,210
Now, there's 1,000 people on the

723
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:57,160
list, and the list keeps growing.

724
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:57,539
You know what I'm saying?

725
00:17:57,809 --> 00:17:59,359
And then, maybe, you upsell the

726
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:00,750
client of ESL opt-in funnel as

727
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:01,230
well.

728
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:02,500
So, like, now that opt-in funnel

729
00:18:02,589 --> 00:18:03,599
is also building emails.

730
00:18:03,609 --> 00:18:05,049
So, now the email list is, like,

731
00:18:05,049 --> 00:18:06,259
progressively fucking more

732
00:18:06,259 --> 00:18:06,779
massive,

733
00:18:06,789 --> 00:18:09,109
and, like, it makes progressively

734
00:18:09,109 --> 00:18:11,059
more sense for them to purchase

735
00:18:11,059 --> 00:18:12,660
email marketing as a recurring

736
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,519
service from you.

737
00:18:13,529 --> 00:18:14,140
You get what I'm saying?

738
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:15,690
Like, it's, like, you're

739
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:16,519
expanding.

740
00:18:16,529 --> 00:18:18,140
It's expansion of service.

741
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:19,880
It's just, it's called expansion

742
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:20,500
revenue.

743
00:18:20,509 --> 00:18:21,339
You get what I'm saying?

744
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:22,269
All right, cool.

745
00:18:22,289 --> 00:18:23,079
That's it for this video.

746
00:18:23,089 --> 00:18:23,519
Peace.
