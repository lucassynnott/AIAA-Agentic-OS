1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,610
All right, so welcome to the

2
00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:03,160
offers section of this training.

3
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:04,049
So we're going to talk about how

4
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:05,650
to transform your service into

5
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:06,889
marketable products.

6
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:10,220
This is insanely wildly important,

7
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:11,109
right?

8
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:12,820
Because this is actually, so many

9
00:00:12,869 --> 00:00:14,310
people don't even know what an

10
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,019
offer is.

11
00:00:15,019 --> 00:00:17,089
Like I want to visualize this for

12
00:00:17,089 --> 00:00:17,579
you.

13
00:00:17,579 --> 00:00:19,050
You're going to meet a lot of

14
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,000
clients in your life, right?

15
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,140
And they're going to have no

16
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:25,589
fucking clue what an offer even

17
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:26,179
is.

18
00:00:26,179 --> 00:00:28,190
They'll have somehow stumbled

19
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:30,269
their way into like whatever the

20
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:31,780
fuck business that they're running

21
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:31,980
in.

22
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:33,619
They'll have never even heard of

23
00:00:33,619 --> 00:00:35,079
any of the concepts inside of

24
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:35,600
here.

25
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,579
So what I'm about to teach you is

26
00:00:38,609 --> 00:00:40,020
what works.

27
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:41,719
This is how you sell to cold

28
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:42,640
traffic.

29
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,880
Now, you're going to talk to a lot

30
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,049
of clients in your life who have

31
00:00:45,049 --> 00:00:46,130
never sold to cold traffic in

32
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:46,820
their life.

33
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:48,520
And they sell whatever the fuck

34
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:50,439
bullshit, random, warm traffic

35
00:00:50,439 --> 00:00:52,420
shit that would never work to cold

36
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:54,159
traffic at all ever, right?

37
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,799
Your job in this section is to

38
00:00:56,799 --> 00:00:58,210
one, not only fully and

39
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:00,530
fundamentally understand what I'm

40
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:01,380
telling you

41
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:03,000
and really ingrain what the fuck

42
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,400
I'm saying into your mind,

43
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,480
but also to ingrain it so deeply

44
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:09,180
within you that you are able to

45
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,739
articulate the lessons to your

46
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:12,819
clients

47
00:01:12,819 --> 00:01:16,000
so that they get results, right?

48
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,079
It's a requirement to everything

49
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:20,189
I'm telling you here to do with

50
00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:22,420
your offer is a requirement also

51
00:01:22,609 --> 00:01:24,739
for your clients to get results

52
00:01:24,739 --> 00:01:26,250
with their offer and for them to

53
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,340
make money, right?

54
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:29,230
So all of the arguments that I'm

55
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:31,390
going to walk through here, that

56
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:32,730
all the shit that I'm going to

57
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:33,590
explain to you,

58
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:35,480
you have to be able to do this to

59
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,129
them as well, right?

60
00:01:37,299 --> 00:01:38,590
So this is one of the most

61
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:40,450
important sections of this entire

62
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:41,200
training.

63
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,670
So this entire office training is

64
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,019
teaching the fundamentals of

65
00:01:44,019 --> 00:01:45,659
packaging and creating offers.

66
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:46,680
Here are some components of this

67
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,540
you need to understand.

68
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:49,010
Your headline of what your offer

69
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:50,780
is, the deliverables of your

70
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:52,049
product, the pricing of your

71
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:52,400
product,

72
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,290
and the terms and contract terms

73
00:01:53,349 --> 00:01:54,500
of the agreement with your client.

74
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,230
This whole training here is

75
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:58,159
focusing exclusively on this.

76
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,439
Yes, this entire offers training.

77
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:02,260
I'm saying all this shit just to

78
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,219
get you to understand everything

79
00:02:04,219 --> 00:02:05,760
around this one point.

80
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,120
That's how fucking important it

81
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:07,400
is.

82
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,680
All of the other components will

83
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,008
be established for each specific

84
00:02:10,008 --> 00:02:11,270
business model in their respective

85
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:12,080
section of this course.

86
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,960
So the word offer can sometimes be

87
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,840
confusing.

88
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,280
So if somebody asks you, for

89
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,020
instance, what's your offer?

90
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:19,060
What they're actually asking you

91
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:19,870
is what is the thing you're

92
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:20,300
selling?

93
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,080
What's your service?

94
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:23,330
But what I mean by offer in this

95
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,500
training is what is the

96
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,180
proposition you're proposing to

97
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:26,800
cold traffic

98
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,270
and how are you expressing it in a

99
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:29,900
headline or single sentence?

100
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,449
That's what I mean by offer.

101
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:32,919
So the literal entire training

102
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:34,490
here is specifically to teach you

103
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:35,699
how to express an offer in a

104
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:36,479
single sentence

105
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:38,069
because this single sentence is

106
00:02:38,069 --> 00:02:39,840
what determines whether you'll get

107
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,349
any leads to get on the phone with

108
00:02:41,349 --> 00:02:41,539
you

109
00:02:41,539 --> 00:02:43,340
and show any interest at all.

110
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:45,039
Okay, I'm going to say this

111
00:02:45,069 --> 00:02:47,340
throughout this training a lot.

112
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,099
You're going to see it a lot.

113
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,710
The entire purpose of an offer is

114
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:52,719
to get somebody on the phone.

115
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:54,740
It's not what you're selling them.

116
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:56,560
It's just what are you saying to

117
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,520
get people to show any interest at

118
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:58,800
all

119
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,060
and actually be willing to get on

120
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:00,639
the phone.

121
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:02,520
What your offer is is not what you

122
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,500
actually end up selling them.

123
00:03:04,789 --> 00:03:05,520
Right?

124
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,580
Okay, so how to structure cold

125
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:07,639
traffic offers to actually get

126
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:08,020
sold.

127
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:09,020
What you're about to learn in this

128
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,060
section is integrity of selling to

129
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:10,520
cold traffic.

130
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,569
If your business is not growing as

131
00:03:11,569 --> 00:03:12,659
fast as you want it to right now,

132
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,759
it's because of your offer.

133
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:15,229
You are not selling something that

134
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,150
people want to buy, specifically

135
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:18,240
cold traffic.

136
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,340
Making a good offer is like

137
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:20,340
becoming the hot girl on

138
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,000
Instagram.

139
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,120
Have you ever wondered what it

140
00:03:22,189 --> 00:03:23,240
would be like to be the hottest

141
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,080
girl in the world?

142
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,379
Everybody wants to buy everything

143
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:26,680
for you, fly you out here, do this

144
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,500
for you, give you special

145
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:27,939
treatment.

146
00:03:27,939 --> 00:03:28,419
Right?

147
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:30,229
Because that's what it's like for

148
00:03:30,229 --> 00:03:30,669
them.

149
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,669
If you're a 10 out of 10 straight

150
00:03:32,669 --> 00:03:33,870
model, this entire section is

151
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,039
about turning your offer into the

152
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:35,520
hot girl.

153
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,020
Right?

154
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,379
We want to make the market

155
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:39,270
ravagingly obsessed with you.

156
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,569
So what is a cold traffic

157
00:03:40,569 --> 00:03:41,699
front-end offer?

158
00:03:41,699 --> 00:03:43,379
It's an offer or packaging of your

159
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:44,689
service or product that is

160
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:46,379
specifically designed to work on

161
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:47,270
cold traffic.

162
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,699
What is cold traffic?

163
00:03:48,699 --> 00:03:50,129
Cold traffic are people who don't

164
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:50,699
know you.

165
00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:51,819
They've never heard of you.

166
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:53,240
They've never seen you before.

167
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,539
They've no semblance of your

168
00:03:54,539 --> 00:03:55,860
existence whatsoever in any

169
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:56,449
capacity.

170
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,360
They don't know you.

171
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,800
Warm traffic are people who do

172
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,819
know you.

173
00:04:01,819 --> 00:04:02,710
They're aware of you.

174
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,580
The only way you're going to get

175
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:06,439
rich is if you could sell to cold

176
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:07,240
traffic.

177
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:07,759
Why?

178
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:08,819
Because you're probably not

179
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:09,580
fucking famous.

180
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:10,060
Right?

181
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:12,080
You don't have 50,000 followers on

182
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,060
Instagram or 10,000 YouTube.

183
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:15,180
So you don't have that.

184
00:04:15,219 --> 00:04:17,240
You have to sell to strangers.

185
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,120
And if you're going to sell to

186
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:19,699
strangers, you need to have your

187
00:04:19,699 --> 00:04:21,079
offer be constructed as a

188
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,649
front-end cold traffic offer.

189
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:23,790
Dope.

190
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,160
All right.

191
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:24,300
Cool.

192
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:24,800
So let's keep going.

193
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,470
So imagine two complete strangers

194
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:27,310
approach you.

195
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:27,629
Right?

196
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:29,899
They're not people you know.

197
00:04:29,899 --> 00:04:31,209
You've never heard of either of

198
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:31,600
them.

199
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:32,199
Right?

200
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:34,790
They give each of you a different

201
00:04:34,819 --> 00:04:36,160
proposition.

202
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,990
I'll set up an automated content

203
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:39,620
system for your business and

204
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,569
guarantee you sign your next three

205
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,000
clients in six weeks.

206
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:43,569
Okay.

207
00:04:43,779 --> 00:04:45,000
The other guy says, I'll help you

208
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,329
set up a content system for your

209
00:04:46,329 --> 00:04:46,959
business.

210
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:48,430
Which of these people are you

211
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:49,660
going to entertain?

212
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:50,850
You personally.

213
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:51,980
Right?

214
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:54,540
Fucking clearly, it's number one.

215
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:54,819
Right?

216
00:04:54,819 --> 00:04:55,600
It's number one.

217
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,240
It just fucking is.

218
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:57,480
All right.

219
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,920
So I have to actually add this

220
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,579
manually.

221
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,129
But story of the guy trying to

222
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:07,779
sell data analysis.

223
00:05:08,019 --> 00:05:10,120
Okay, I had this guy one time and

224
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,310
he was on one of my coaching calls

225
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:13,779
and he was coming to me.

226
00:05:13,779 --> 00:05:14,860
It was like some fucking, he

227
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:16,069
wanted to make some fucking, it

228
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:17,399
was like some data analysis offer

229
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:18,649
where it's like, I'll help you

230
00:05:18,649 --> 00:05:20,410
make good decisions with your

231
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:20,959
data.

232
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:23,339
I'm like, bro, what the fuck does

233
00:05:23,339 --> 00:05:24,319
that mean?

234
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:25,740
What does it mean I'll make good

235
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,019
decisions with my data?

236
00:05:27,019 --> 00:05:28,490
That's not a cold traffic offer.

237
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,870
What is the result I will get from

238
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:31,860
the offer?

239
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:32,100
Okay.

240
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,240
So what's the differentiation

241
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:34,100
between these two?

242
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,970
This one has a result.

243
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,339
Sign your next clients in three

244
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:37,819
weeks.

245
00:05:37,819 --> 00:05:38,920
I'm going to guarantee it.

246
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,389
With a guarantee, you sign your

247
00:05:40,459 --> 00:05:41,910
next clients, your next three

248
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:43,139
clients in six weeks.

249
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:43,920
What is that?

250
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,949
That is a, there's a quantifiable

251
00:05:45,949 --> 00:05:47,680
promise with a guarantee.

252
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,459
What does this not have?

253
00:05:49,459 --> 00:05:50,839
A quantifiable promise with a

254
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:51,540
guarantee.

255
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:51,939
Okay.

256
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,519
So what can we deduce?

257
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,120
That a cold traffic front end

258
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,370
offer is an offer with a

259
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:57,970
quantifiable promise with a

260
00:05:57,970 --> 00:05:59,579
guarantee or some kind of risk

261
00:05:59,600 --> 00:05:59,970
reversal.

262
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,279
That's what a front end cold

263
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:02,180
traffic offer is.

264
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,500
So I was talking to this guy and

265
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,740
he's trying to fucking come up

266
00:06:04,779 --> 00:06:05,860
with this like random data

267
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:06,779
analysis offer.

268
00:06:06,779 --> 00:06:08,370
I'm like, bro, this doesn't make

269
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:09,019
any sense.

270
00:06:09,019 --> 00:06:10,720
You can't, this is not a front end

271
00:06:10,769 --> 00:06:12,060
cold traffic offer.

272
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,529
And he goes, but this is because

273
00:06:13,529 --> 00:06:14,939
he was working a job at an agency

274
00:06:14,939 --> 00:06:16,399
and he's like, but I do this at my

275
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:17,379
current agency.

276
00:06:17,379 --> 00:06:18,240
People buy this.

277
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,319
And I'm like, no, they fucking

278
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:21,060
don't.

279
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,529
I was like, stop lying to me.

280
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:24,000
Stop bullshitting me right now.

281
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,860
I was like, stop.

282
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:25,720
I was like, I was like, I was

283
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,660
like, cut the bullshit.

284
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,199
I was like, what's your agency?

285
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:29,670
Who do you work for?

286
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:31,399
And we look, we on this fucking

287
00:06:31,449 --> 00:06:33,220
call, we look it up and what they

288
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:35,220
were selling clients were webinar

289
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,680
funnel buildouts.

290
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,769
That was their front end cold

291
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:40,199
traffic offer.

292
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:42,240
It was to build a webinar funnel

293
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,720
for a client and they had a

294
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,420
quantifiable promise with a

295
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:46,639
guarantee on it.

296
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,000
That's how they were selling to

297
00:06:48,009 --> 00:06:48,779
cold traffic.

298
00:06:48,819 --> 00:06:49,920
Hey, we'll build you a webinar

299
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,110
funnel and guarantee it makes you

300
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,870
$30,000 in profit in the next 30

301
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:53,259
days.

302
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,790
Some bullshit like that, right?

303
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,540
He was just on the data team where

304
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:00,170
he did data analysis to help the

305
00:07:00,189 --> 00:07:03,220
webinars convert better over time

306
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04,199
so they can make optimizations

307
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:04,970
around the webinar.

308
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:07,399
I was like, bro, like fucking,

309
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:09,569
like stop bullshitting me.

310
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:10,939
This is not a front end cold

311
00:07:10,939 --> 00:07:11,790
traffic offer.

312
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:12,980
You know, it's not a front end

313
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:13,959
cold traffic offer.

314
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,680
Like, you know, your company is

315
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,480
selling fucking webinar buildouts

316
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,220
with a quantifiable promise with a

317
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:20,209
guarantee on it.

318
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:21,899
Stop fucking with me, right?

319
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:22,480
Okay.

320
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,360
Why did I give you this aside?

321
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:26,279
Because you need to understand

322
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,220
when you're fucking trying to

323
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,560
delude yourself.

324
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,560
Like, it's, this is just the

325
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,399
reality.

326
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:33,199
This is the fact.

327
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:34,990
Like, I wish it didn't have to be

328
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:36,240
like this either.

329
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,339
But if you are not famous and you

330
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:39,930
don't have a shit ton of

331
00:07:39,949 --> 00:07:41,579
authority, you don't have a shit

332
00:07:41,579 --> 00:07:42,680
ton of referrals, whatever, you

333
00:07:42,779 --> 00:07:44,620
have to sell a quantifiable

334
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:47,220
promise with a guarantee, right?

335
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:49,120
Now, the rest of this training is

336
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:51,100
going to be me teaching you how to

337
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:51,810
do this.

338
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:53,519
Without getting fucked.

339
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:54,649
That's what, that's literally what

340
00:07:54,709 --> 00:07:55,600
this entire training is.

341
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,490
All of it, right?

342
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,779
So does this sound familiar?

343
00:07:57,779 --> 00:07:59,189
Right now, you're watching people

344
00:07:59,189 --> 00:08:00,410
who run the same business as you

345
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:01,660
or a similar business and they

346
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:02,779
make a hundred, ten times to a

347
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,220
hundred times more money than you.

348
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:05,449
But they're doing the exact same

349
00:08:05,449 --> 00:08:05,910
thing as you.

350
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:06,740
They're doing outreach.

351
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:07,379
They're making content.

352
00:08:07,379 --> 00:08:08,240
They're running ads, whatever.

353
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,790
You're also doing that.

354
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,920
But somehow, they're making shit

355
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:11,939
tons more money than you.

356
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:13,079
And you spent however many

357
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:14,529
hundreds of hours trying to figure

358
00:08:14,529 --> 00:08:15,300
out how this is.

359
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,910
And if you're like me, this either

360
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:18,759
made you angry, upset, confused.

361
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:20,339
And when you keep thinking about

362
00:08:20,339 --> 00:08:21,819
it, it makes you demotivated and

363
00:08:21,819 --> 00:08:23,019
want to quit, right?

364
00:08:23,019 --> 00:08:24,230
How is it functionally possible

365
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:25,120
that these people selling

366
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,470
literally the exact same thing as

367
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:27,610
you or making so much more money

368
00:08:27,689 --> 00:08:28,730
than you while doing the exact

369
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:30,000
same things you're doing?

370
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,120
Why is it that it works for them

371
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,009
and it doesn't work for you,

372
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:32,500
right?

373
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,620
This is the problem we're going to

374
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:34,860
solve in this little class today.

375
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,450
So I want to make it so that you

376
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:38,379
never feel that feeling again.

377
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,908
I want you to know why this is

378
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,870
happening and how to solve it once

379
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:43,379
and forever, right?

380
00:08:43,379 --> 00:08:44,639
That's what this is.

381
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:46,519
So understanding why people buy

382
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:47,629
anything ever.

383
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:48,750
There are only three reasons

384
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:49,919
anybody buys anything.

385
00:08:50,309 --> 00:08:51,820
Health, right?

386
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:53,259
Buying this will make me feel

387
00:08:53,269 --> 00:08:55,110
better, look better, live longer,

388
00:08:55,179 --> 00:08:56,960
and avoid physical pain, right?

389
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,659
Love, buying this will result in

390
00:08:58,710 --> 00:08:59,950
me getting more dates,

391
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,909
getting married and procreating

392
00:09:01,909 --> 00:09:03,440
and having sex, right?

393
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,759
Well, buying this will deliver a

394
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:07,950
return on investment that results

395
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:09,259
in me being richer than I was

396
00:09:09,259 --> 00:09:09,840
before.

397
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,200
All right, cool.

398
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,309
But because we're all B2B and all

399
00:09:12,389 --> 00:09:13,580
of our clients are prospects,

400
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:14,610
we're going to fall under the

401
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:15,399
wealth category.

402
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:17,279
What can we deduce from that?

403
00:09:17,299 --> 00:09:20,120
That the only reason a client will

404
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,009
buy from you is if they believe

405
00:09:22,009 --> 00:09:23,500
that your service will make them

406
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,039
richer.

407
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:25,679
So in order to make a good offer,

408
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:27,159
we must do the following.

409
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:29,159
Promise a specific result.

410
00:09:29,419 --> 00:09:30,669
Then make the prospect confident

411
00:09:30,669 --> 00:09:31,690
we can actually get them the

412
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:32,139
result.

413
00:09:32,139 --> 00:09:34,019
That's fucking it.

414
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,700
You're selling more money.

415
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:39,370
There is all of you.

416
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:41,190
Every single, there's not a single

417
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:42,730
exception of anyone, anybody

418
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:44,559
watching this video right now.

419
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:49,169
Your prospect has to make more

420
00:09:49,169 --> 00:09:52,929
money via buying your shit.

421
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,590
That's it.

422
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:57,929
By buying your thing, they have to

423
00:09:57,929 --> 00:09:59,659
make more money.

424
00:09:59,659 --> 00:10:00,460
So what does that mean?

425
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:01,289
What if you're sitting here

426
00:10:01,289 --> 00:10:02,330
thinking, you're like, wow, my

427
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:03,250
thing like kind of doesn't make

428
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:03,960
them more money.

429
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,259
Like there's got to be a way that

430
00:10:05,259 --> 00:10:06,409
I can like kind of scoot this

431
00:10:06,409 --> 00:10:06,950
around.

432
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,509
No, stop fucking selling that and

433
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:11,799
sell something that makes them

434
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:12,960
more money.

435
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,539
It has to make them more money,

436
00:10:15,539 --> 00:10:16,000
right?

437
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,509
And if we went a layer deeper than

438
00:10:18,509 --> 00:10:20,759
this, you could split that in

439
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:21,440
half.

440
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,139
Where there's like things that

441
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,340
like help people make more money.

442
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:26,639
You can like help them make more

443
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:27,960
money from a system they already

444
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,240
have versus like building them

445
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,039
something new.

446
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:33,279
Building a new system for them

447
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:36,700
does even fucking better, right?

448
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:39,600
Okay, you have to understand this.

449
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:43,659
Nobody ever is buying your shit if

450
00:10:43,659 --> 00:10:47,009
it is not extremely abundantly

451
00:10:47,549 --> 00:10:50,879
clear that it is going to make

452
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:53,240
them more money.

453
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:56,769
Nothing, nothing for no other

454
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:59,820
reason fucking at all ever.

455
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,120
Are they purchasing from you?

456
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,940
This needs to be so, you need to

457
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,639
fucking, I don't care what it

458
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,840
takes for you to understand this.

459
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,940
We got to write it down 30 times.

460
00:11:09,019 --> 00:11:10,139
Make them more money.

461
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:10,919
Make them more money.

462
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:11,659
Make them more money.

463
00:11:11,659 --> 00:11:12,399
Make them more money.

464
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,480
Make them, they don't buy unless

465
00:11:14,539 --> 00:11:16,700
it is to make more fucking money.

466
00:11:16,779 --> 00:11:18,659
Why did you buy this from me?

467
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:20,490
You fucking paid whatever amount

468
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:22,039
of money to have this product

469
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:22,779
right now.

470
00:11:22,779 --> 00:11:23,070
Why?

471
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,629
Because you want to make money.

472
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:26,340
No fucking shit, right?

473
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:28,210
You got to stop beating around the

474
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:28,960
bush because,

475
00:11:29,059 --> 00:11:30,700
Because everybody beats around the

476
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:31,120
bush.

477
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:31,799
You know what I'm saying?

478
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:32,860
Like all the people,

479
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,159
All the other people running

480
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:35,960
businesses and they might say

481
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,340
like,

482
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:37,460
Oh, our company is this big.

483
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:38,490
But they're all, they're actually

484
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:39,460
fucking poor, right?

485
00:11:39,539 --> 00:11:42,190
All of the people actually making

486
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:44,909
real fucking big boy bucks, like

487
00:11:44,909 --> 00:11:47,279
real fucking shit tons of money

488
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,259
are not scooting around the fact

489
00:11:49,259 --> 00:11:51,299
that what we're fucking selling is

490
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,220
getting the clients rich.

491
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,519
That's fucking it.

492
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:55,639
We're getting them rich.

493
00:11:55,659 --> 00:11:56,879
And if you scoot around this fact,

494
00:11:56,879 --> 00:11:58,019
they're not going to fucking buy

495
00:11:58,019 --> 00:11:58,519
from you.

496
00:11:58,519 --> 00:11:59,629
They're going to buy from somebody

497
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:00,759
who is telling them that they can

498
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:01,190
get rich.

499
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,330
You understand, right?

500
00:12:02,419 --> 00:12:03,730
You have to, you have to get this

501
00:12:03,769 --> 00:12:04,919
because if you don't, you're

502
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,480
fucked.

503
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,950
You're so fucked, right?

504
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:07,700
All right, cool.

505
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,100
Value propositions, clear outcomes

506
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:09,840
to clear niches.

507
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:11,480
So the most successful business

508
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,340
owners we work with 100% of the

509
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:14,899
time have a clear type of person

510
00:12:14,899 --> 00:12:16,059
that they work with.

511
00:12:16,059 --> 00:12:17,529
They promise a clear outcome and

512
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,929
they achieve that outcome in a

513
00:12:18,929 --> 00:12:19,970
clear way, right?

514
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:22,710
So the offer is what the prospect

515
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:23,370
gets.

516
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:26,610
The service is what you do, right?

517
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:27,830
You got to, you got to understand

518
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,149
the differentiation between these

519
00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:29,460
two.

520
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:31,600
What the prospect gets is the

521
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:33,240
result, right?

522
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,259
The result, the offer is a result.

523
00:12:35,259 --> 00:12:37,139
The service is how you get the

524
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:38,470
result, right?

525
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:39,990
The officer, the offer focuses on

526
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:41,360
the result the client gets as a

527
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,750
result of the deliverable.

528
00:12:42,759 --> 00:12:44,309
The service is the deliverable

529
00:12:44,309 --> 00:12:45,269
itself, right?

530
00:12:45,299 --> 00:12:47,340
1 million views guaranteed is an

531
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:47,940
offer.

532
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,960
Video editing is a service.

533
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,429
We help you sign 5 to 10 clients

534
00:12:51,429 --> 00:12:52,610
per month with cold email as an

535
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:53,120
offer.

536
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,539
Done for you, cold email as a

537
00:12:54,539 --> 00:12:55,159
service.

538
00:12:55,159 --> 00:12:56,029
Done for you, ads and funnels,

539
00:12:56,039 --> 00:12:57,049
sign 10 to 20 clients per month

540
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,100
where you don't pay as an offer.

541
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,309
Done for you, ads and funnels as a

542
00:12:59,309 --> 00:12:59,820
service.

543
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,629
You do not get cold traffic to buy

544
00:13:01,629 --> 00:13:02,460
services.

545
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:04,029
They will never give you money.

546
00:13:04,039 --> 00:13:06,120
Cold traffic doesn't buy services.

547
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,759
They buy offers.

548
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:09,000
Does that make sense?

549
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,129
So this is how you can deduce the

550
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:11,279
differentiation between when

551
00:13:11,299 --> 00:13:12,590
someone is selling to cold traffic

552
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:13,580
versus warm traffic.

553
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:14,700
If you're only selling to warm

554
00:13:14,769 --> 00:13:16,190
traffic, you're never really going

555
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:16,789
to get rich.

556
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,720
You have to be able to sell to

557
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:18,500
cold traffic.

558
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:20,929
You know it's cold traffic offer

559
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,600
when it's promising a result.

560
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,820
When someone says something like,

561
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:27,590
oh yeah, we do Google ads or like

562
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:29,409
we're professional Google ads or

563
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:30,679
whatever the fuck.

564
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:32,120
What does that mean?

565
00:13:33,559 --> 00:13:36,129
What it means is that they're

566
00:13:36,129 --> 00:13:39,129
selling a warm traffic offer.

567
00:13:39,139 --> 00:13:39,830
They're not selling to cold

568
00:13:39,879 --> 00:13:40,139
traffic.

569
00:13:40,139 --> 00:13:41,259
Cold traffic is not buying for

570
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:41,610
them.

571
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:43,539
You can, I bet a million fucking

572
00:13:43,539 --> 00:13:45,539
dollars cold traffic is not buying

573
00:13:45,539 --> 00:13:47,460
for them if there's not a result,

574
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,110
right?

575
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,730
So you must be absolutely clear

576
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:51,269
about the result the prospect

577
00:13:51,269 --> 00:13:51,779
gets.

578
00:13:51,779 --> 00:13:52,669
So the next section out of the

579
00:13:52,669 --> 00:13:53,759
first one, you'll understand how

580
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:54,919
to actually design an offer.

581
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:56,250
So everything in this section is

582
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:57,149
about fundamentals.

583
00:13:57,159 --> 00:13:57,980
So what not to do.

584
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:58,740
Okay.

585
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,210
We do email marketing and Google

586
00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:01,860
ads and Facebook ads and LinkedIn

587
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,279
ads and website building.

588
00:14:03,299 --> 00:14:03,539
Okay.

589
00:14:03,539 --> 00:14:05,009
Successful business owners,

590
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,659
today's market are not glorified

591
00:14:06,659 --> 00:14:07,539
e-commerce.

592
00:14:07,539 --> 00:14:08,639
They're not a glorified e-commerce

593
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,529
store where you put a bunch of

594
00:14:09,529 --> 00:14:10,480
services in a fucking shopping

595
00:14:10,509 --> 00:14:11,419
cart and you take a pic.

596
00:14:11,899 --> 00:14:12,860
That's not how this shit works,

597
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:13,200
right?

598
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,320
This only works if it's warm

599
00:14:14,389 --> 00:14:16,080
traffic or it's referrals, right?

600
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,440
If you're doing this right now,

601
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:18,870
you are probably thinking if I add

602
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:20,029
a bunch of services into the

603
00:14:20,029 --> 00:14:21,470
packages, it will make it more

604
00:14:21,539 --> 00:14:22,070
valuable.

605
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:22,970
I'm value stacking.

606
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:24,149
This will get people, more people

607
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:24,600
to buy.

608
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,710
No, wrong.

609
00:14:25,779 --> 00:14:26,659
Doesn't work like that.

610
00:14:26,659 --> 00:14:28,299
The primary result, there's a

611
00:14:28,299 --> 00:14:30,289
primary result of misunderstanding

612
00:14:30,289 --> 00:14:31,950
that it is more difficult to get

613
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:33,629
somebody on the phone than it is

614
00:14:33,629 --> 00:14:35,049
to get them to give you thousands

615
00:14:35,049 --> 00:14:36,519
of dollars once they're already on

616
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:37,259
the phone.

617
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:39,440
Okay, the entire reason of why

618
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:41,299
we're building an offer that

619
00:14:41,309 --> 00:14:43,269
promises a result is because we

620
00:14:43,269 --> 00:14:45,500
need to get people on the phone.

621
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:48,120
You can sell whatever you want on

622
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,220
the phone.

623
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,639
It doesn't matter.

624
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,110
You can sell them whatever the

625
00:14:52,179 --> 00:14:52,519
fuck.

626
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,590
It can be completely different

627
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:54,500
than what you've got them on the

628
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:55,120
phone with.

629
00:14:55,139 --> 00:14:56,830
It's just that when you're

630
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:59,059
positioning yourself as a service

631
00:14:59,059 --> 00:15:01,200
instead of an offer, nobody gets

632
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:02,879
on the phone with you.

633
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:05,360
It's very important you understand

634
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,580
this, right?

635
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:07,470
I don't want this to be one of

636
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:08,340
those points where you kind of

637
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:09,440
just blow it off to the side.

638
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,019
You have to understand it is more

639
00:15:12,019 --> 00:15:14,620
difficult to get somebody on the

640
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:16,779
phone than it is to get them to

641
00:15:16,779 --> 00:15:18,259
buy, right?

642
00:15:18,259 --> 00:15:19,559
In everything we're doing around

643
00:15:19,559 --> 00:15:20,399
positioning your offer

644
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:21,679
specifically to get them on the

645
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:23,820
phone, it's 80% of the battle.

646
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,289
It's literally fucking all of the

647
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,240
battle, right?

648
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,710
Adding a bunch of services to your

649
00:15:27,779 --> 00:15:29,120
packages will not get you more

650
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:29,970
calls booked.

651
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:31,840
Promising results will get you

652
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,169
more calls booked.

653
00:15:33,179 --> 00:15:34,649
You have to promise results in the

654
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,539
offer, right?

655
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,830
So let's talk about unique selling

656
00:15:36,909 --> 00:15:37,539
propositions.

657
00:15:37,539 --> 00:15:38,850
A unique selling proposition is

658
00:15:38,889 --> 00:15:40,190
the one clear specific reason why

659
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:41,399
customers should buy from you

660
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:42,679
instead of competitors.

661
00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:44,149
So it answers the question, why

662
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,259
should I choose you?

663
00:15:45,259 --> 00:15:46,669
It's not flaw for generic claims

664
00:15:46,669 --> 00:15:48,110
like, we care or we're the best,

665
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:48,620
right?

666
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:49,509
It's bullshit.

667
00:15:49,559 --> 00:15:50,450
That shit doesn't work.

668
00:15:50,539 --> 00:15:52,409
A real USP, unique selling

669
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:54,769
proposition, highlights what makes

670
00:15:54,769 --> 00:15:56,649
your offer different and better in

671
00:15:56,649 --> 00:15:57,799
a way that your market actually

672
00:15:57,799 --> 00:15:58,259
values.

673
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,019
Okay, so strong USPs do one or the

674
00:16:00,019 --> 00:16:00,659
following.

675
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:02,429
They promise a specific result,

676
00:16:02,429 --> 00:16:02,980
right?

677
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:05,070
Lose 30 pounds in 10 days, lose 10

678
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,820
pounds in 30 days worth free.

679
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:08,389
Guaranteed reduced risk, no

680
00:16:08,389 --> 00:16:10,179
results, no pay, or highlight a

681
00:16:10,179 --> 00:16:11,759
feature nobody else has.

682
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:13,120
The only CRM that writes your

683
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,539
emails for you or whatever the

684
00:16:14,539 --> 00:16:14,970
fuck.

685
00:16:15,019 --> 00:16:16,320
I just made that up.

686
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,399
Bad USPs.

687
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:19,259
We care about our customers.

688
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:21,720
We're professionals, great

689
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,970
customer service, high quality

690
00:16:24,029 --> 00:16:25,240
work, right?

691
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,679
It's all fucking bullshit, right?

692
00:16:26,679 --> 00:16:27,990
It's, it's, it's, it's, but it

693
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:29,200
just, this doesn't work.

694
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:30,919
This is like, this is like random

695
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:32,740
marketing lingo that like a, like

696
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:34,759
a, like a, like a, like a woman

697
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:37,149
college professor taught, but

698
00:16:37,169 --> 00:16:38,629
she's like never actually sold

699
00:16:38,629 --> 00:16:39,820
anything in her life.

700
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:40,909
It's just, it's just fucking

701
00:16:40,909 --> 00:16:41,370
nonsense.

702
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:42,000
It's fake.

703
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,460
It's just fake bullshit, right?

704
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,460
It just is, right?

705
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:46,269
If, if your competitor can say the

706
00:16:46,269 --> 00:16:48,360
same thing, it's not a USP, right?

707
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,610
This, this is the kind of shit

708
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:51,009
that people say who've never made

709
00:16:51,009 --> 00:16:52,580
any money in their life, right?

710
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:53,710
It's just fucking nonsense.

711
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,019
So, so examples.

712
00:16:55,019 --> 00:16:57,529
You tell me if each of these is an

713
00:16:57,559 --> 00:16:59,850
offer or if it's a service and

714
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:02,330
whether it has a unique selling

715
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:03,940
proposition.

716
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:06,338
So we help real estate agents with

717
00:17:06,338 --> 00:17:09,098
Google ads, not an offer, right?

718
00:17:09,098 --> 00:17:10,210
We help, we help real estate

719
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:11,529
agents get more leads with Google

720
00:17:11,529 --> 00:17:12,460
ads, not an offer.

721
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:13,818
We help real estate agents get 30

722
00:17:13,818 --> 00:17:15,160
leads per month with Google ads.

723
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:15,559
Okay.

724
00:17:15,559 --> 00:17:16,140
Now we're getting there.

725
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,779
It's an offer, but it's not really

726
00:17:17,779 --> 00:17:18,598
a good offer.

727
00:17:18,598 --> 00:17:19,680
Oh, 30 leads.

728
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,869
Now, now, okay.

729
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,809
So this is a, this is like a, like

730
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:26,750
a bypass point where it's easy for

731
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:29,019
you to kind of just like gloss

732
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:30,569
over this and like take what I

733
00:17:30,569 --> 00:17:32,119
just said as definitive.

734
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:34,160
It's like 30 leads per month.

735
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,279
Oh, that, that's a thing that

736
00:17:35,339 --> 00:17:36,529
someone said before, or like,

737
00:17:36,529 --> 00:17:37,849
that's a thing that people sell.

738
00:17:38,299 --> 00:17:39,039
Well, okay.

739
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:41,839
You, you, you, you, you gotta

740
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:44,240
fucking like think like many

741
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,279
orders of magnitude.

742
00:17:46,279 --> 00:17:47,690
You gotta, you gotta think like

743
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:49,119
down multiple surface levels of

744
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:50,380
what the fuck is occurring in

745
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:51,839
front of your eyes, right?

746
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:52,059
Right.

747
00:17:52,059 --> 00:17:53,160
So like, so, okay.

748
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,039
If there's a real estate agent,

749
00:17:56,039 --> 00:17:58,069
what, what, what is a real estate

750
00:17:58,089 --> 00:18:00,319
agent considering a lead, right?

751
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:01,970
Because here's what you

752
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:03,759
understand, like you understand

753
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:05,329
your market, because if you say

754
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:06,890
the word lead to a real estate

755
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:09,119
agent, what does that mean to

756
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:09,799
them?

757
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,559
They're thinking of like shared

758
00:18:11,559 --> 00:18:13,359
lead platforms of like, oh, like a

759
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:14,980
Zillow lead where you gotta like

760
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:16,779
pay $50 for a lead, but they sold

761
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:18,210
the lead to like seven other

762
00:18:18,309 --> 00:18:18,900
people.

763
00:18:19,059 --> 00:18:20,650
And it's like, not actually like

764
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:22,079
someone who was individually

765
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:23,509
contacted, who was actually

766
00:18:23,509 --> 00:18:24,450
interested in how.

767
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,279
So like, what, what does that

768
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:25,500
mean?

769
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,180
It means that if you fucking just

770
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:29,309
started saying this, like 30 leads

771
00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:30,859
per month, and then it didn't

772
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:32,200
work, you'd be like, oh, Daniel

773
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,150
promising leads doesn't work.

774
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:34,670
It's like, no, because they

775
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:36,170
fucking think leads are that, and

776
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:37,680
you aren't, you aren't delineating

777
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:39,180
what exactly the thing is.

778
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:40,579
Like I was just in a conversation

779
00:18:40,579 --> 00:18:41,980
with someone yesterday, he was

780
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:43,319
talking about how he's going to

781
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:44,509
sell a lead gen to financial

782
00:18:44,509 --> 00:18:45,180
advisors.

783
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:47,259
And he was saying like, uh, he was

784
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:49,180
saying, I'm going to guarantee

785
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:51,170
them 10 qualified meetings a

786
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:51,859
month.

787
00:18:51,859 --> 00:18:53,680
I was like, have you ever spoken

788
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,380
to a financial advisor in your

789
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:55,980
life?

790
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,089
And he's like, oh yeah, like my

791
00:18:57,089 --> 00:18:57,859
parents do all that.

792
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:59,240
Like that's what kind of why, kind

793
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,019
of why I chose it.

794
00:19:00,019 --> 00:19:00,890
So I'm kind of like familiar with

795
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:01,480
that industry.

796
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,539
I was like, okay, do financial

797
00:19:03,539 --> 00:19:05,329
advisors use this specific

798
00:19:05,329 --> 00:19:07,579
phrasing qualified meetings?

799
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:09,220
And he goes, no, he says, it's

800
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:10,950
more, it's more so like meetings

801
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,490
with high net, high net worth

802
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:13,480
individuals.

803
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,559
I'm like, okay, so then make it 10

804
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:17,170
meetings with high net worth

805
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:19,170
individuals guaranteed per month,

806
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:20,279
or you don't pay.

807
00:19:20,279 --> 00:19:21,170
He's like, oh, okay.

808
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,329
You get what I'm saying?

809
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:24,079
But there's the problem, the

810
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:25,880
problem with me trying to like

811
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,920
teach a program like this is that

812
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,339
there are fucking thousands of

813
00:19:30,339 --> 00:19:31,220
little nuance,

814
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:33,029
little bullshits like that, that

815
00:19:33,029 --> 00:19:34,859
it's completely impossible for me

816
00:19:34,859 --> 00:19:36,759
to accurately explain every single

817
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:37,640
one of them.

818
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,099
You get what I'm saying?

819
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:41,160
Like there's no fucking way that I

820
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:44,170
could give you every single little

821
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:46,869
intricate tiny step of exactly

822
00:19:46,869 --> 00:19:50,140
what the fuck you personally are.

823
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:51,190
It's completely fucking

824
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:51,839
impossible.

825
00:19:51,859 --> 00:19:53,730
There's so much different shit

826
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:55,000
that could occur.

827
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,630
So this is what I'm saying like in

828
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:58,319
the intro video when I was talking

829
00:19:58,319 --> 00:19:59,880
about like use your brain.

830
00:20:00,059 --> 00:20:01,880
Like you have to use your fucking

831
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,579
brain and like take nuance with

832
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,450
everything that, everything that

833
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:06,180
you're told.

834
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,309
Like you, you, you got to have

835
00:20:07,369 --> 00:20:08,559

837
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:10,299

00:22:45,259 --> 00:22:46,059
differentiation.

949
00:22:46,059 --> 00:22:46,819
No one does that.

950
00:22:46,819 --> 00:22:48,920
We manually send, right?

951
00:22:49,079 --> 00:22:49,539
You get what I'm saying?

952
00:22:49,539 --> 00:22:51,000
We do performance-based lead gen

953
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,559
for agency owners where, where you

954
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:53,180
only pay if we get

955
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:53,490
results.

956
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,069
Good risk reversal there.

957
00:22:55,079 --> 00:22:55,970
We do call you our agency owners

958
00:22:56,059 --> 00:22:56,779
and guarantee you save five

959
00:22:56,779 --> 00:22:57,559
clients every month.

960
00:22:57,559 --> 00:22:59,259
See what I mean?

961
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:01,640
You got to fuck with it, right?

962
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,160
All right, cool.

963
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,349
Transfer of logistical intensity.

964
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:04,819
So let's imagine two situations.

965
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:07,589
Situation one, you are a roofing

966
00:23:07,589 --> 00:23:10,210
marketing company, right?

967
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:11,410
We're just saying that you run ads

968
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:12,660
for roofers or whatever the fuck,

969
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:13,099
right?

970
00:23:13,099 --> 00:23:15,180
But you do not qualify the leads

971
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:17,200
for your clients, right?

972
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,210
So you got to imagine, so like

973
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:19,000
what's happening?

974
00:23:19,079 --> 00:23:19,950
Here's like, they're probably

975
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:20,700
running like meta ads.

976
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,400
If you're a homeowner and you need

977
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:24,430
new roof, yada, yada, yada, where

978
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:25,180
the fuck?

979
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:27,630
Now, they're probably using lead

980
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:30,079
forms and like people submit their

981
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:31,720
information and then you

982
00:23:31,759 --> 00:23:33,029
have to call them to actually like

983
00:23:33,029 --> 00:23:33,849
schedule a quote.

984
00:23:33,859 --> 00:23:35,099
Like, hey, are you actually like a

985
00:23:35,099 --> 00:23:36,180
serious person about getting a

986
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:36,529
roof?

987
00:23:36,759 --> 00:23:38,349
Because like, again, most people

988
00:23:38,349 --> 00:23:40,099
are completely fucking retarded.

989
00:23:40,099 --> 00:23:41,400
So like what happens is like you

990
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,750
get a bunch of people submitting

991
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:43,859
leads and they're like,

992
00:23:43,859 --> 00:23:46,210
I didn't, I didn't submit your, my

993
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:46,799
info.

994
00:23:46,819 --> 00:23:47,940
And like, they're, they're

995
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:49,430
literally so fucking retarded that

996
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:50,880
they don't remember submitting

997
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,180
their info like eight minutes ago.

998
00:23:52,259 --> 00:23:53,509
That, that, that's the vast

999
00:23:53,509 --> 00:23:55,250
majority of the population, right?

1000
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:57,460
So, so it's, it's sifting through

1001
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:58,029
that.

1002
00:23:58,039 --> 00:23:59,119
That's what I mean by that.

1003
00:23:59,119 --> 00:24:00,369
Is that qualifying the leads, like

1004
00:24:00,369 --> 00:24:01,609
sifting through the retards, like

1005
00:24:01,609 --> 00:24:03,700
a little, like a, like a little

1006
00:24:03,789 --> 00:24:04,509
sand sifter.

1007
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:06,029
You're like, you're doing that.

1008
00:24:06,839 --> 00:24:08,299
Now, situation two, you're a

1009
00:24:08,299 --> 00:24:09,930
roofing marketing company and you

1010
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:11,279
do qualify the leads for the

1011
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:11,720
client, right?

1012
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,119
Okay.

1013
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,000
Why is this important?

1014
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,319
Because nobody else does that.

1015
00:24:17,319 --> 00:24:19,019
Nobody else wants to do that,

1016
00:24:19,069 --> 00:24:19,640
right?

1017
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,339
So because you do that, now you

1018
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:22,720
are differentiated.

1019
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,609
Does that make sense?

1020
00:24:24,059 --> 00:24:26,160
Because it's, it's a piece of

1021
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:29,039
logistical intensity that must be

1022
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:32,680
executed in, in, in the service,

1023
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,849
in, in, on the pathway to the

1024
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:35,660
client getting results.

1025
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,400
So there's like, you, you, you

1026
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,900
make the ads, you set up the ad

1027
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,619
account, you, you, you run the

1028
00:24:40,619 --> 00:24:41,859
ads, ads start running, right?

1029
00:24:41,859 --> 00:24:43,170
And now you got to do the retard

1030
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:44,190
sifting, right?

1031
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,440
The, the, the lead qualifying,

1032
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:45,859
right?

1033
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:48,759
Nobody wants to do that.

1034
00:24:48,759 --> 00:24:50,359
Most roofing marketing companies

1035
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:51,640
are not going to do that.

1036
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,750
They're going to make the fucking

1037
00:24:52,829 --> 00:24:53,299
roofer do it.

1038
00:24:53,299 --> 00:24:53,920
So what does that mean?

1039
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,180
Now the roofer needs to either do

1040
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:56,440
it himself or he needs to fucking

1041
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:57,440
hire someone to do it.

1042
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,920
And that's logistically intense to

1043
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,680
do that.

1044
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,380
It's, it's, it's logistical

1045
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:03,720
intensity, right?

1046
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:06,819
So now you're like, no, I do that.

1047
00:25:06,819 --> 00:25:09,059
Now he's like, oh fuck.

1048
00:25:09,059 --> 00:25:09,299
Wow.

1049
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:10,849
This is way better of a product

1050
00:25:10,849 --> 00:25:12,660
because all the other fuckers make

1051
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:14,500
me do that, but you do it for him.

1052
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:14,809
Right?

1053
00:25:14,819 --> 00:25:15,769
So now, okay.

1054
00:25:15,779 --> 00:25:17,480
So when people, you got, what do

1055
00:25:17,529 --> 00:25:18,960
you have to understand?

1056
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,509
When people buy services, what

1057
00:25:20,509 --> 00:25:22,130
they are purchasing is a transfer

1058
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:23,549
of logistical intensity.

1059
00:25:23,619 --> 00:25:25,250
The more logistical intensity you

1060
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:26,930
can allocate to yourself, the more

1061
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:28,019
somebody will pay.

1062
00:25:28,299 --> 00:25:28,700
Right?

1063
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,289
And I touch, I touch again in this

1064
00:25:30,289 --> 00:25:31,819
on the, in the video about how to

1065
00:25:31,819 --> 00:25:33,240
sell high ticket offers,

1066
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,519
but you might, you might become

1067
00:25:34,519 --> 00:25:35,849
confused about what you can add to

1068
00:25:35,849 --> 00:25:37,019
your offer that will make

1069
00:25:37,019 --> 00:25:37,680
it more valuable.

1070
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,779
And the answer is always just the

1071
00:25:38,779 --> 00:25:39,819
thing that nobody else wants to

1072
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:40,140
do.

1073
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:41,220
It's the thing that's a fucking

1074
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:42,200
pain in the ass, right?

1075
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,509
Both you and your competitors and

1076
00:25:43,549 --> 00:25:45,019
your clients don't want to do it.

1077
00:25:45,019 --> 00:25:45,440
Okay.

1078
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,329
What does that mean though?

1079
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:48,980
If nobody wants to do it, it means

1080
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,910
that by definition, the supply is

1081
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:51,369
low.

1082
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:52,630
And when the supply is low, you

1083
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:53,920
could charge higher prices.

1084
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,359
You could charge a fuck ton of

1085
00:25:55,359 --> 00:25:56,190
money to do it.

1086
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:57,670
And ideally, like maybe you could

1087
00:25:57,670 --> 00:25:59,190
automate a shit ton of it with AI.

1088
00:25:59,200 --> 00:25:59,900
You know what I'm saying?

1089
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,529
So having a competitive advantage

1090
00:26:01,529 --> 00:26:03,039
simply means being able to do the

1091
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:04,799
things that require logistical

1092
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:05,339
intensity.

1093
00:26:05,339 --> 00:26:06,230
Does that make sense?

1094
00:26:06,259 --> 00:26:07,730
So like, for instance, Amazon

1095
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:09,059
Prime guarantees you one day

1096
00:26:09,059 --> 00:26:10,400
shipping because they own the

1097
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:10,859
planes,

1098
00:26:10,859 --> 00:26:11,609
the trucks, and the shipping

1099
00:26:11,609 --> 00:26:11,940
network.

1100
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,180
That offer is impossible to have

1101
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:15,569
unless they own the entire

1102
00:26:15,569 --> 00:26:17,450
shipping infrastructure with

1103
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:18,710
distribution centers across every

1104
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:19,059
state.

1105
00:26:19,059 --> 00:26:20,480
They overtook the single most

1106
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,190
logistically intense process that

1107
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:23,359
exists on the planet and

1108
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:24,599
therefore were able to become a

1109
00:26:24,599 --> 00:26:26,049
multiple trillion dollar company,

1110
00:26:26,059 --> 00:26:26,500
right?

1111
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:26,859
Okay.

1112
00:26:26,859 --> 00:26:27,970
So what you got to do is just

1113
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:29,319
define the intensity points,

1114
00:26:29,319 --> 00:26:29,799
right?

1115
00:26:29,819 --> 00:26:31,900
So take a random fucking random

1116
00:26:32,049 --> 00:26:33,579
service, right?

1117
00:26:33,579 --> 00:26:34,880
Like your client wants to land

1118
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,279
three to four podcast episodes a

1119
00:26:36,279 --> 00:26:37,619
week to promote their new book.

1120
00:26:37,619 --> 00:26:38,619
Obstacles.

1121
00:26:38,619 --> 00:26:40,029
How to find the right podcast, how

1122
00:26:40,029 --> 00:26:41,339
to reach out to those podcasts,

1123
00:26:41,339 --> 00:26:42,420
what to say in the podcast,

1124
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,589
so you just create your offer

1125
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:44,859
based off of how much logistical

1126
00:26:44,859 --> 00:26:45,980
intensity you capture.

1127
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:46,269
Okay.

1128
00:26:46,279 --> 00:26:47,750
So what are all the intensity

1129
00:26:47,819 --> 00:26:49,440
points involved with getting a

1130
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,720
client on a podcast?

1131
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,819
So you've got to create the list

1132
00:26:51,819 --> 00:26:52,859
of the relevant podcasts in the

1133
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:53,539
first place.

1134
00:26:53,539 --> 00:26:54,279
You've got to write the email

1135
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:54,920
scripts to get them on the

1136
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:55,319
podcast.

1137
00:26:55,319 --> 00:26:56,170
You've got to find the email

1138
00:26:56,170 --> 00:26:57,359
addresses of the podcast host, and

1139
00:26:57,359 --> 00:26:57,960
then you've got to send

1140
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:58,720
the emails, and you've got to

1141
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,549
schedule the podcast, and then

1142
00:26:59,549 --> 00:27:00,460
you've got to make the talking

1143
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:01,160
points of the podcast.

1144
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,769
So the more of these intensity

1145
00:27:02,769 --> 00:27:04,509
points you capture on your end,

1146
00:27:04,509 --> 00:27:06,150
the more you're able to charge.

1147
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:06,920
Does that make sense?

1148
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:07,359
Right?

1149
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:08,799
So like building value is not

1150
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:10,579
about stacking different services

1151
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,839
on top of one another.

1152
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
It's about capturing more

1153
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,369
logistical intensity of a singular

1154
00:27:14,369 --> 00:27:15,210
service, right?

1155
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:16,109
It's better to offer lead

1156
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:17,269
generation all the way down to

1157
00:27:17,269 --> 00:27:18,720
getting the meeting scheduled on

1158
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,930
their calendar versus offering

1159
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:21,230
five different ways of generating

1160
00:27:21,259 --> 00:27:21,930
leads, right?

1161
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:22,849
But the client has to do all the

1162
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:23,980
response handling, the booking,

1163
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:24,900
the lead qualification.

1164
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:25,700
You know what I'm saying?

1165
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:27,789
That's what differentiation is.

1166
00:27:27,799 --> 00:27:30,619
That's what it is, right?

1167
00:27:30,619 --> 00:27:31,930
That's what you got to understand.

1168
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:32,559
All right.

1169
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:33,960
Let's move on to the next video,

1170
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,500
and I hope you enjoyed this one.

1171
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:35,720
Peace.
