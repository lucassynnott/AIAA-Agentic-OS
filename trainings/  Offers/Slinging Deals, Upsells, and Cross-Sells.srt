1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,040
All right, so this is probably one

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,810
of the most important concepts

3
00:00:03,879 --> 00:00:05,000
that I've seen.

4
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:06,820
Like, you could ask anybody in

5
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:08,000
Client Central.

6
00:00:08,009 --> 00:00:10,029
This is like single-handedly one

7
00:00:10,029 --> 00:00:11,890
of the most important things that

8
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:13,660
you need to execute at all.

9
00:00:13,669 --> 00:00:14,730
It's literally like a

10
00:00:14,779 --> 00:00:16,500
life-changing concept that you

11
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:17,519
need to follow.

12
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:19,820
This in particular is like what

13
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,030
drives you up to like your first

14
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:23,620
30, 50,

15
00:00:23,629 --> 00:00:24,649
even fucking sometimes like

16
00:00:24,649 --> 00:00:25,980
$100,000 a month.

17
00:00:25,989 --> 00:00:27,780
It's by shifting your framing to

18
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:28,769
this, right?

19
00:00:28,789 --> 00:00:30,289
So it's basically, it's called

20
00:00:30,289 --> 00:00:31,649
slinging deals, and it's how to

21
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:33,240
close 100% of sales calls.

22
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:34,780
So everything about trying to like

23
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:36,130
jujitsu your sales calls into

24
00:00:36,229 --> 00:00:37,579
manipulating somebody to purchase

25
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:38,600
is completely fucking stupid,

26
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:38,920
right?

27
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:40,009
So like your sole and only

28
00:00:40,329 --> 00:00:41,799
function on call is to determine

29
00:00:41,899 --> 00:00:43,240
what their problems are

30
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:44,240
and offer a solution that will

31
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,399
maximize them achieving their end

32
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:45,619
goal

33
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:46,649
because that's the only thing that

34
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:47,840
a prospect is concerned with is

35
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,270
achieving their own selfish wants,

36
00:00:50,329 --> 00:00:50,979
right?

37
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:52,020
So that means that you have to

38
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,420
stop being selfish and everybody

39
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:54,600
you're talking to has goals,

40
00:00:54,609 --> 00:00:55,929
and they're only going to buy if

41
00:00:55,929 --> 00:00:57,310
they believe that what you have

42
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:58,479
will help them hit their goal

43
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:00,030
at a higher rate than whatever

44
00:01:00,289 --> 00:01:01,740
alternative that they have access

45
00:01:01,789 --> 00:01:02,820
to at that moment.

46
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:05,310
So might elapse, say some shit

47
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:06,379
like this.

48
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:07,109
Thanks for coming to the call

49
00:01:07,189 --> 00:01:07,409
today.

50
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:08,319
Name, I'm going to operate under

51
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:08,730
deception.

52
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:09,469
Do you want to grow your company?

53
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:10,140
Yeah, yes.

54
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:10,540
Okay, cool.

55
00:01:10,549 --> 00:01:11,260
So what's your problem right now?

56
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:12,049
Why am I going to be able to do

57
00:01:12,049 --> 00:01:12,280
that?

58
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:13,010
And that would lead you into

59
00:01:13,069 --> 00:01:13,780
discovery, right?

60
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:15,650
So you're going to proceed to be

61
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:17,319
relayed all the things that

62
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:19,290
they've tried and didn't work.

63
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:20,159
You're going to learn what their

64
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:20,819
frustrations are,

65
00:01:20,829 --> 00:01:21,849
what the exact reason that they

66
00:01:21,969 --> 00:01:23,170
haven't been able to grow their

67
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:23,920
company so far.

68
00:01:24,489 --> 00:01:26,030
Now, you start talking about your

69
00:01:26,209 --> 00:01:26,980
product, right?

70
00:01:26,989 --> 00:01:29,739
So let's say that then go, well, I

71
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,760
don't know about that.

72
00:01:30,769 --> 00:01:32,370
Simply ask, well, what do you

73
00:01:32,489 --> 00:01:32,859
want?

74
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:34,599
So like, say you just pitched your

75
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:35,459
shit, right?

76
00:01:35,469 --> 00:01:38,560
And you just say, well, I don't

77
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,540
know if I want that.

78
00:01:40,569 --> 00:01:42,700
You can just say, well, what do

79
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:43,430
you want?

80
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:45,099
What makes the most sense to you,

81
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:45,599
right?

82
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:47,569
Now, they quite literally tell you

83
00:01:47,659 --> 00:01:49,060
exactly what they want.

84
00:01:49,069 --> 00:01:50,090
So say you're selling a

85
00:01:50,129 --> 00:01:51,319
done-for-you offer.

86
00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:53,140
Now, this video is important.

87
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:53,989
So make sure you watch the whole

88
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:54,200
thing.

89
00:01:54,209 --> 00:01:55,060
So I'm going to like visualize

90
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:55,920
this more towards the end.

91
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:57,359
So say you're selling a

92
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:59,459
done-for-you offer, right?

93
00:01:59,469 --> 00:02:00,379
And they tell you that they want

94
00:02:00,379 --> 00:02:01,519
to learn how to do it themselves.

95
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:02,540
But because you've labored

96
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:03,769
yourself as an agency and only

97
00:02:03,769 --> 00:02:04,760
sell done-for-you,

98
00:02:04,769 --> 00:02:06,269
you just tell them, well, I don't

99
00:02:06,269 --> 00:02:06,840
do that.

100
00:02:07,189 --> 00:02:08,740
Which is dumb.

101
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:09,460
It doesn't make any sense.

102
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:10,719
Because you would sell them a

103
00:02:10,909 --> 00:02:12,030
consulting offer for the right

104
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:12,500
price.

105
00:02:12,509 --> 00:02:14,419
So just tell them, just sell them

106
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,139
consulting calls and swipe files

107
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:16,949
of stuff you've made.

108
00:02:17,009 --> 00:02:18,599
So what I'm trying to get at here

109
00:02:18,729 --> 00:02:20,120
before we get into the better

110
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,800
visualization of this is that

111
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:24,240
you will always hit your all-time

112
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,250
high revenue months when you are

113
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:28,099
slinging deals all month, right?

114
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:29,259
You got to understand that like

115
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,909
what's happening is every week

116
00:02:30,909 --> 00:02:31,949
starts at zero.

117
00:02:31,969 --> 00:02:32,990
Every day starts at zero.

118
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:34,169
You reset every single day.

119
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:35,370
You need to get deals over the

120
00:02:35,509 --> 00:02:36,860
line all week and every day.

121
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:38,610
Each deal might be custom for a

122
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:40,289
custom deliverable and for a

123
00:02:40,289 --> 00:02:41,319
custom price.

124
00:02:41,449 --> 00:02:42,919
You are not locked into a singular

125
00:02:43,169 --> 00:02:44,310
deliverable and a singular price

126
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,199
and that's it.

127
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:46,699
You need to be dynamic.

128
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:47,729
The problem with people below

129
00:02:47,729 --> 00:02:49,409
$100K a month is they always say

130
00:02:49,409 --> 00:02:50,590
shit like that won't scale.

131
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,870
If you're below $100K a month,

132
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:54,520
don't worry about scale.

133
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:56,759
Get to $100K a month first, right?

134
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:57,939
And you get to $100K a month by

135
00:02:57,939 --> 00:02:59,030
slinging deals and getting the

136
00:02:59,030 --> 00:02:59,969
maximum amount of customers

137
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:00,639
possible, right?

138
00:03:00,689 --> 00:03:01,280
So, okay.

139
00:03:01,289 --> 00:03:02,810
So let's revisit logistical

140
00:03:03,009 --> 00:03:03,900
intensity here.

141
00:03:03,909 --> 00:03:04,979
Inside of the how to sell high

142
00:03:05,169 --> 00:03:06,259
ticket offers video,

143
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:07,289
I talked about stacking

144
00:03:07,449 --> 00:03:08,789
deliverables and showing all the

145
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:09,860
deliverables involved in working

146
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:10,169
together.

147
00:03:10,389 --> 00:03:11,419
So I'm going to take an example

148
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:12,930
offer from the ads and funnels

149
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:14,030
agency and help you understand

150
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:14,699
this better, right?

151
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:16,509
So we're going to take an example

152
00:03:16,509 --> 00:03:17,870
offer of it's a webinar funnel

153
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:19,189
build out for high ticket coaching

154
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,099
clients, right?

155
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:21,860
So the client is conducting the

156
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:23,689
webinar that will pitch an offer

157
00:03:23,689 --> 00:03:24,319
at the end

158
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:25,590
and drive those registrants to a

159
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:26,960
sales call to purchase that upsell

160
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,400
offer.

161
00:03:27,409 --> 00:03:28,430
The upsell offer is $10,000.

162
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:29,610
That's why the webinar drives to a

163
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:30,400
sales call instead of the

164
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,840
self-checkout on the webinar page.

165
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:34,210
Okay, so now, these are going back

166
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:35,810
to what I said earlier in the

167
00:03:36,219 --> 00:03:37,199
offer section.

168
00:03:37,539 --> 00:03:40,060
These are the logistical intensity

169
00:03:40,169 --> 00:03:42,780
points involved in conducting a

170
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:45,060
webinar funnel, a successful

171
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,159
webinar funnel.

172
00:03:46,169 --> 00:03:47,039
You know what I'm saying?

173
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:48,590
So the logistical intensity points

174
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:49,719
that are required to have a

175
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:51,000
successful webinar are the

176
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:54,240
deliverables of your offer, right?

177
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:56,360
So, like, okay, so now we could

178
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,289
break this up into a very simple,

179
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,599
like, comparison chart between

180
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:02,259
what I do and what you do.

181
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:03,289
So this would be, like, what the

182
00:04:03,379 --> 00:04:04,419
client does and this is what you

183
00:04:04,419 --> 00:04:04,639
do.

184
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:05,689
So, like, you would literally

185
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,490
have, like, a fucking chart like

186
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:07,939
this.

187
00:04:07,949 --> 00:04:09,250
Like, you'll see this more in the

188
00:04:09,259 --> 00:04:10,620
VSL section where it's, like, the

189
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:11,819
actual presentation of it.

190
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:12,780
It's just, like, deliverable

191
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:13,139
stacking.

192
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:14,939
So, you would literally tell the

193
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:16,370
client, like, okay, well, I'll do

194
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:17,560
the funnel build-out, the landing

195
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:18,620
page, design, landing page, copy,

196
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:19,939
VSL scripting, VSL editing, ad

197
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,240
scripting, ad video editing, post

198
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:22,620
registration, emails, the webinar

199
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:23,850
script, the slides creation, the

200
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:25,209
thank you page, VSL scripting, the

201
00:04:25,209 --> 00:04:26,670
editing, the post-webinar emails,

202
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:27,569
all the automations, connect

203
00:04:27,569 --> 00:04:28,569
everything together, ad pixel

204
00:04:28,569 --> 00:04:29,769
setup, ads management, media

205
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:31,139
buying, and the post-webinar email

206
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:32,100
flows of 30 days.

207
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:33,139
What you do is actually conduct

208
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:34,689
the webinar and then take the

209
00:04:34,689 --> 00:04:35,990
sales calls that are booked from

210
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:37,610
it and close those deals, right?

211
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:38,670
Okay, so now let's say you just

212
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:39,149
pitched it.

213
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:40,740
Let's say you just pitched this.

214
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:42,319
So, if you pitch this offer at

215
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:44,540
$8,000 build-out plus 10% gross

216
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:47,410
revenue, and they say some shit,

217
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:50,160
like, oh, that's too much.

218
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:51,199
Okay, backtrack the conversation

219
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:52,589
with them and see if they're

220
00:04:52,589 --> 00:04:53,779
actually sold on the concept of

221
00:04:53,779 --> 00:04:55,069
the webinar in the first place and

222
00:04:55,069 --> 00:04:56,300
whether they really, really,

223
00:04:56,439 --> 00:04:57,540
really want to do a webinar right

224
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:58,000
now.

225
00:04:58,009 --> 00:05:00,600
Okay, say you do that and they're,

226
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,829
like, sold.

227
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:04,079
Like, yes, I want to do a webinar.

228
00:05:04,089 --> 00:05:05,149
I think, like, we need to do a

229
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:05,680
webinar.

230
00:05:05,689 --> 00:05:06,670
I'm sold on the concept of a

231
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:07,180
webinar.

232
00:05:07,189 --> 00:05:08,089
Like, this is the thing that we

233
00:05:08,089 --> 00:05:08,509
have to do.

234
00:05:08,819 --> 00:05:09,920
Okay, now.

235
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:11,939
Here's what you can do to proceed

236
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:12,660
forward.

237
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:14,589
Offer to remove specific elements

238
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,920
of it for less money.

239
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:16,949
Like, if their objection is really

240
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,319
money and they literally fucking

241
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:19,730
can't afford that, just offer to

242
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:21,389
remove specific elements of it for

243
00:05:21,389 --> 00:05:22,579
less money, right?

244
00:05:22,629 --> 00:05:23,709
So, allocate some of the

245
00:05:23,889 --> 00:05:25,720
logistical intensity towards them

246
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,209
in order to get the deal over the

247
00:05:27,329 --> 00:05:28,920
line for less money and less work

248
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,819
in your end.

249
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:30,870
That's one available option.

250
00:05:31,029 --> 00:05:32,699
Like, you could just take some of

251
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,079
this shit and move it over to

252
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:34,529
them.

253
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:35,250
Where it's like, well, I can't

254
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:35,569
afford this.

255
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:36,990
Well, you could tell them, like,

256
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:38,129
okay, listen, I could do it for

257
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:39,290
less money, but that means less

258
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:40,040
work on my end.

259
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:41,839
So, like, which of these do you

260
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:43,310
want me to move over to your

261
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:44,519
responsibility?

262
00:05:44,589 --> 00:05:46,040
Like, what do you want me to do

263
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:46,680
exactly?

264
00:05:46,689 --> 00:05:48,610
You get what I'm saying?

265
00:05:49,269 --> 00:05:50,290
And, like, you could be screen

266
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:51,540
sharing with them, literally

267
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:52,660
fucking showing them this so,

268
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:53,709
like, they understand what's

269
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:54,769
happening, right?

270
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:56,329
Now, say they're not sold on the

271
00:05:56,529 --> 00:05:57,509
concept of webinars.

272
00:05:57,569 --> 00:05:58,889
So, you could offer to create a

273
00:05:58,949 --> 00:06:00,430
different kind of funnel for them,

274
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:01,459
like a low-ticket product

275
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,069
essential funnel or a BSL funnel

276
00:06:03,069 --> 00:06:04,629
that is requiring them to actually

277
00:06:04,629 --> 00:06:06,379
conduct a live webinar, right?

278
00:06:06,649 --> 00:06:07,639
So, the premise I'm trying to

279
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:08,680
convey is that there's always a

280
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,800
reason why somebody isn't moving

281
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,189
forward to somebody, which always

282
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:12,850
presents us an opportunity to

283
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:14,480
either upsell or downsell.

284
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:15,970
So, for instance, let's say they

285
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:17,829
said some shit, like, I just don't

286
00:06:17,829 --> 00:06:19,560
want to actually do a webinar.

287
00:06:19,589 --> 00:06:20,139
I'm nervous.

288
00:06:20,149 --> 00:06:20,870
It's too much work.

289
00:06:20,889 --> 00:06:21,810
I don't like presenting live,

290
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:22,800
yada, yada, yada, whatever the

291
00:06:22,899 --> 00:06:23,459
fuck, right?

292
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:24,529
Here's what you could do with

293
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:25,139
that.

294
00:06:25,149 --> 00:06:26,980
You could offer an upsell and say,

295
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,509
I'll personally conduct the

296
00:06:28,509 --> 00:06:29,600
webinar for you.

297
00:06:29,629 --> 00:06:31,110
And that might be, like, $5,000

298
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:32,550
extra plus an additional 10%

299
00:06:32,589 --> 00:06:33,740
collected that you charge them,

300
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,069
right?

301
00:06:34,329 --> 00:06:35,540
That's one available option.

302
00:06:36,649 --> 00:06:37,740
Or, you could cross-sell them

303
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:39,319
where it's like, I'll build you a

304
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:40,779
different kind of funnel where you

305
00:06:40,939 --> 00:06:42,149
don't have to conduct a webinar,

306
00:06:42,149 --> 00:06:43,389
like a BSL funnel or a low-ticket

307
00:06:43,389 --> 00:06:44,420
product funnel, right?

308
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:45,819
Now, they also might say something

309
00:06:45,819 --> 00:06:46,889
like, I just want to do this

310
00:06:46,889 --> 00:06:48,009
myself and don't want to give

311
00:06:48,009 --> 00:06:49,490
control to somebody else, right?

312
00:06:49,589 --> 00:06:51,129
Well, you could cross-sell them

313
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,670
into a done-with-you offer where

314
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:54,029
we get on a call once per week and

315
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,899
build out everything together.

316
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:56,930
And then you might charge, like,

317
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:58,730
$6,000 to $12,000 for that or some

318
00:06:58,730 --> 00:06:59,079
shit.

319
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:00,699
It doesn't matter, right?

320
00:07:00,709 --> 00:07:02,519
The idea that your packages and

321
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:03,910
prices will be clean and

322
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:05,279
established is wrong.

323
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:06,730
This is the wrong way to go about

324
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:07,980
building a business.

325
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:08,709
You need to sell.

326
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:11,420
I always find this interesting.

327
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:13,319
Someone will ask me, you know, how

328
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:15,680
much should I charge for this?

329
00:07:15,689 --> 00:07:17,600
And the answer is the maximum

330
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,569
amount that you can pull off.

331
00:07:21,029 --> 00:07:22,839
That's what the proper amount to

332
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,189
charge somebody is.

333
00:07:24,209 --> 00:07:25,269
Now, obviously, you want to see

334
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:26,560
some examples of what have other

335
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,360
people charged.

336
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:29,279
Then you start with some, like,

337
00:07:29,379 --> 00:07:31,220
arbitrary fucking number that

338
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:32,990
results in you making a lot of

339
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:33,420
profit.

340
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:34,579
And then maybe there's, like, a

341
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:35,519
back and forth with it.

342
00:07:35,529 --> 00:07:36,379
And then over time, as you get

343
00:07:36,379 --> 00:07:37,209
more clients and you're more

344
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:38,350
confident in your ability, maybe

345
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:39,170
you have more case studies,

346
00:07:39,189 --> 00:07:40,189
you just gradually increase the

347
00:07:40,189 --> 00:07:41,240
price based on the level of demand

348
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,279
that you're able to facilitate,

349
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:42,689
right?

350
00:07:42,769 --> 00:07:44,689
So your goal is to collect cash.

351
00:07:44,709 --> 00:07:46,209
As much of it as you can by any

352
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:48,060
means and no matter how unclear of

353
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:49,639
a sequence it results in.

354
00:07:49,649 --> 00:07:51,569
This is a result of consultative

355
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:52,259
sales.

356
00:07:52,269 --> 00:07:53,240
You're not actually selling

357
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:53,740
somebody.

358
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:54,769
You're just making recommendations

359
00:07:55,009 --> 00:07:56,160
based on what they say because you

360
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,089
have shit tons of different

361
00:07:57,089 --> 00:07:58,189
products and iterations to sell

362
00:07:58,199 --> 00:07:58,620
them.

363
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,069
Okay, so, like, let me give you an

364
00:08:00,129 --> 00:08:00,620
example.

365
00:08:00,629 --> 00:08:03,319
If you have ADHD and, like, your

366
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:06,220
doctor recommends you Vyvanse, but

367
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:08,329
then you try Vyvanse and it lasts

368
00:08:08,329 --> 00:08:10,629
too long to where you can't sleep.

369
00:08:10,649 --> 00:08:11,500
And then you go to the doctor,

370
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,490
you're like, hey, like, I don't

371
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:13,480
really like this too much.

372
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:15,040
Like, it lasts too long.

373
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:16,500
Like, it fucks with my sleep.

374
00:08:16,509 --> 00:08:17,829
So what he does then is he

375
00:08:17,829 --> 00:08:19,670
prescribes you extended release

376
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:20,399
Adderall.

377
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:21,680
And then you take that, you're

378
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:23,029
like, hey, I actually kind of

379
00:08:23,029 --> 00:08:24,160
don't like this at all.

380
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,379
Like, this also kind of lasts too

381
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:26,569
long and I kind of want it to come

382
00:08:26,569 --> 00:08:27,920
down around, like, 7 p.m.

383
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,879
or whatever the fuck.

384
00:08:28,889 --> 00:08:29,500
I don't know.

385
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,000
So he gives you instant release

386
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,699
Adderall.

387
00:08:31,709 --> 00:08:32,929
But then you tell him, hey, like,

388
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,090
I'm taking, like, this instant

389
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:35,309
release Adderall and it's, like,

390
00:08:35,309 --> 00:08:36,440
kind of intense when I first take

391
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:36,769
it.

392
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:37,759
Like, I kind of really don't like

393
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:38,220
it too much.

394
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:39,129
Okay, so then what does he tell

395
00:08:39,129 --> 00:08:39,500
you to do?

396
00:08:39,529 --> 00:08:40,940
He tells you to take the pill and

397
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:42,360
cut it in a quarter and only take

398
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,610
one quarter of it at a time,

399
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:43,970
right?

400
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:45,419
Okay, so what happened here?

401
00:08:45,509 --> 00:08:47,259
He cross-sold you into a new

402
00:08:47,259 --> 00:08:49,740
product from Vyvanse to Adderall.

403
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:50,809
Then down-sold you into less

404
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,419
volume of that new product based

405
00:08:52,419 --> 00:08:54,000
on your particular situation.

406
00:08:54,009 --> 00:08:56,710
This is how this works, right?

407
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:59,350
You are always a consultant simply

408
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:01,809
recommending what makes logical

409
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:04,210
sense for every individual you

410
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,120
speak to.

411
00:09:05,129 --> 00:09:07,200
There is nothing clear-cut.

412
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:09,340
Do this exactly.

413
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:10,559
It has to be exactly like this.

414
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:12,600
There is nothing clear-cut about

415
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,330
this business, right?

416
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:16,279
This is, like, this is kind of,

417
00:09:16,379 --> 00:09:18,000
like, a veil you might have in

418
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,100
that, like, there's a saying where

419
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,899
it's, like, you can just do

420
00:09:21,929 --> 00:09:23,059
things, right?

421
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:23,740
Like, I'll give you a for

422
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:24,090
instance.

423
00:09:25,389 --> 00:09:27,529
If there's, like, a long line to,

424
00:09:27,529 --> 00:09:29,620
like, an event venue or, like, a

425
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:31,840
bar or some bullshit like that, I

426
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,919
will go up to the person at the

427
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:36,179
front of the line and I will very

428
00:09:36,179 --> 00:09:39,039
discreetly take a $20 or $50 or

429
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:41,820
$100 bill and bribe them to skip

430
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:42,950
the line.

431
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:45,169
And it works, like, 99% of the

432
00:09:45,169 --> 00:09:46,250
fucking time.

433
00:09:46,269 --> 00:09:47,960
Like, it just does, right?

434
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:50,370
The premise is that you can just

435
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:51,419
do things.

436
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:52,600
Like, there's no rules.

437
00:09:52,769 --> 00:09:54,909
Like, there's, like, just because

438
00:09:54,909 --> 00:09:56,649
you're a done-for-you agency and

439
00:09:57,059 --> 00:09:58,690
this is your offer doesn't mean,

440
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,519
like, that's what you actually

441
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:01,769
fucking sell.

442
00:10:02,009 --> 00:10:03,309
Like, you just sell other shit,

443
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:03,779
right?

444
00:10:03,789 --> 00:10:05,230
It's kind of, like, going back to

445
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,629
this concept I've spoken about in

446
00:10:06,629 --> 00:10:07,980
this offer section where it's,

447
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,419
like, just get them on the phone,

448
00:10:09,419 --> 00:10:09,879
right?

449
00:10:09,889 --> 00:10:11,330
Like, so you could have some offer

450
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:12,730
with some, like, quantifiable

451
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:14,139
claim and, like, a guarantee or

452
00:10:14,179 --> 00:10:15,379
whatever the fuck and all it's

453
00:10:15,379 --> 00:10:16,659
doing is getting people on the

454
00:10:16,659 --> 00:10:17,230
phone.

455
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,159
But it could literally be the case

456
00:10:19,259 --> 00:10:20,889
that you have never sold that

457
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:22,860
offer that you have as, like, your

458
00:10:23,509 --> 00:10:24,940
headline on your landing page or

459
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:26,779
the thing that you're saying in

460
00:10:26,779 --> 00:10:28,159
the cold emails.

461
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:29,759
It could literally be, like,

462
00:10:29,889 --> 00:10:31,539
you've signed 10 clients and

463
00:10:31,539 --> 00:10:33,169
you've never fucking even sold

464
00:10:33,169 --> 00:10:34,259
that offer once.

465
00:10:34,269 --> 00:10:36,389
Like, literally fucking not even

466
00:10:36,389 --> 00:10:37,129
one time.

467
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:40,789
It's, you just do, you sling

468
00:10:40,789 --> 00:10:42,000
deals.

469
00:10:42,009 --> 00:10:45,179
You just sell what you can.

470
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:46,370
Get what I'm saying?

471
00:10:46,549 --> 00:10:48,460
Like, that's how this business,

472
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:50,000
that's how you do this.

473
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:51,960
All of the people who grow the

474
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,929
fastest just fucking do this and

475
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:56,269
you sell all sorts of iterations

476
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:58,409
and sets of fuckery and, like,

477
00:10:58,409 --> 00:11:00,460
that's how this shit works.

478
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:00,919
You get what I'm saying?

479
00:11:00,929 --> 00:11:02,340
This is why it's important for you

480
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:03,769
to understand, like, it really

481
00:11:03,769 --> 00:11:05,139
ingrained in this concept of the

482
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,590
offer, like, the headline, what

483
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:08,019
you're saying in your cold email

484
00:11:08,019 --> 00:11:09,460
script and shit or your cold DM

485
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,769
script is, like, just make the

486
00:11:11,769 --> 00:11:15,139
offer so fucking ballsy that they

487
00:11:15,139 --> 00:11:16,419
just get on the phone.

488
00:11:16,549 --> 00:11:18,070
Because it, like, isn't even what

489
00:11:18,269 --> 00:11:19,700
you end up fucking selling them at

490
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:20,100
all.

491
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:21,039
You get what I'm saying?

492
00:11:21,049 --> 00:11:23,200
Like, in 90% of the cases, I don't

493
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,159
know, it might range, it might be,

494
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:27,419
like, 40 to 90%, who fucking

495
00:11:27,419 --> 00:11:28,120
knows?

496
00:11:28,129 --> 00:11:29,129
But it's, it's, everyone's

497
00:11:29,129 --> 00:11:29,659
different.

498
00:11:29,669 --> 00:11:32,940
But just, you can just do things.

499
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:33,980
You just, just sling fucking

500
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:34,860
deals, bro.

501
00:11:35,029 --> 00:11:36,120
Like, that's, that's it.

502
00:11:36,309 --> 00:11:38,350
Like, you, you, you, you, bro,

503
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:40,190
even if, even if it's, like, you

504
00:11:40,539 --> 00:11:42,500
just collect $500 for making one

505
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,340
fucking landing page design for

506
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,039
them.

507
00:11:45,049 --> 00:11:47,399
Like, just, just get something.

508
00:11:47,409 --> 00:11:49,490
Just get on the phone and fucking

509
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:51,259
close them on something.

510
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:52,299
You know what I'm saying?

511
00:11:52,309 --> 00:11:54,509
Like, because what you're trying

512
00:11:54,509 --> 00:11:56,539
to do is, like, you just want as

513
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,440
many humans who have given you

514
00:11:58,590 --> 00:11:59,960
money as possible.

515
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:01,330
And I'm, I'm, I'm going to

516
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:02,830
actually write this down.

517
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:03,870
Main goal.

518
00:12:04,419 --> 00:12:09,389
Get as many humans to give you any

519
00:12:09,389 --> 00:12:15,220
amount of money as possible.

520
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:19,080
Maximize the amount of humans who

521
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:22,519
have paid you any amount of,

522
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:24,250
maximize the amount of humans on

523
00:12:24,259 --> 00:12:26,740
the planet who have paid you any

524
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:27,990
amount of money ever.

525
00:12:28,029 --> 00:12:28,700
Right?

526
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:30,899
Why?

527
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:34,779
Because this increases your

528
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,679
customer base.

529
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:40,769
The moment somebody, the moment

530
00:12:40,769 --> 00:12:43,629
somebody pays you any amount of

531
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:46,389
money, it increases the

532
00:12:46,389 --> 00:12:50,210
probability they continue to pay

533
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:55,159
you more money by about 1000x.

534
00:12:55,169 --> 00:12:55,440
Right?

535
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:55,700
Okay.

536
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:00,139
I'll, I'll, I, I, I, I, I, I, I,

537
00:13:00,139 --> 00:13:02,110
I, I'll try to keep this as PC as

538
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:03,149
possible.

539
00:13:03,169 --> 00:13:06,759
But, um, like, if you're a guy and

540
00:13:06,759 --> 00:13:08,440
you want to take a girl out on a

541
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,259
date, the girl, or you want to

542
00:13:10,259 --> 00:13:12,289
take a girl out or, like, do other

543
00:13:12,289 --> 00:13:13,779
things with the girl.

544
00:13:13,789 --> 00:13:16,230
The pro, if, if, if, if, if you

545
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:18,590
ask a girl who's already done that

546
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:21,450
with you, the probability that it

547
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:24,559
works is fucking 1000 times

548
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:25,519
higher.

549
00:13:26,049 --> 00:13:26,620
You get what I'm saying?

550
00:13:26,629 --> 00:13:28,549
Like, it's the same thing with

551
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:29,490
customers.

552
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:32,110
Like, if you pick somebody to pay

553
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:34,450
you money for an offer and you do

554
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:36,990
it to somebody who's already paid

555
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:39,600
you even fucking $5, like, it's

556
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,429
gonna work better with them than

557
00:13:41,429 --> 00:13:43,340
somebody who hasn't paid you.

558
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:44,669
That's why you're trying to do

559
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:45,120
this.

560
00:13:45,129 --> 00:13:46,059
That's why you need to sling

561
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:46,389
deals.

562
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:48,389
You need to fucking sell somebody

563
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,320
something.

564
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:50,360
Get any, any amount of money

565
00:13:50,549 --> 00:13:51,799
because you need to maximize the

566
00:13:51,799 --> 00:13:53,090
amount of humans who have paid you

567
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:54,279
any amount of money at all.

568
00:13:54,509 --> 00:13:55,230
Alright, that's it for this video.

569
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:55,539
Peace.
