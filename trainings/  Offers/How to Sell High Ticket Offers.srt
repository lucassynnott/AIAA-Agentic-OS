1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:01,649
Okay, so this is how to sell

2
00:00:01,649 --> 00:00:03,200
high-ticket offers.

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:04,519
So this is a comprehensive guide

4
00:00:04,519 --> 00:00:06,450
to collecting substantially more

5
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:07,730
money per client project

6
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:09,259
that you engage yourselves in.

7
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:11,349
And I see too profuse of a problem

8
00:00:11,349 --> 00:00:13,439
with many of you guys with either

9
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:15,240
of these two problems.

10
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:16,539
So you're either failing to close

11
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:17,879
any deals and absolutely fucking

12
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:18,699
your sales calls up

13
00:00:18,969 --> 00:00:20,420
because you lack the skills or

14
00:00:20,489 --> 00:00:22,269
confidence to properly convey

15
00:00:22,269 --> 00:00:23,929
value and explain in clear

16
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:26,100
English exactly what you do in a

17
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,140
logical argument as to why the

18
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:29,679
person should buy it.

19
00:00:30,899 --> 00:00:31,019
Right?

20
00:00:31,329 --> 00:00:32,670
Second, you're stuck in the

21
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:34,640
constant cycle of never being able

22
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:35,579
to raise your prices

23
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:37,579
because every time you do so, you

24
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:39,479
face progressively more resistance

25
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,219
and you don't know exactly what to

26
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:42,899
do to begin stepping up the ladder

27
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:44,060
of how much you charge.

28
00:00:44,509 --> 00:00:45,020
Right?

29
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:46,759
So the objective of this video is

30
00:00:46,759 --> 00:00:47,759
the following.

31
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:49,590
We're going to explain why people

32
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:50,679
pay more money.

33
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,329
We're going to explain exactly how

34
00:00:52,329 --> 00:00:53,700
you're failing to raise your

35
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:54,280
prices.

36
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:55,630
I'm going to call you out on the

37
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:57,240
bullshit objections you'll give me

38
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,109
across the screen

39
00:00:58,409 --> 00:01:00,369
before they even come up and then

40
00:01:00,369 --> 00:01:02,320
the assets and exact things you

41
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:03,600
need to do right now

42
00:01:03,659 --> 00:01:05,439
and begin implementing immediately

43
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:07,180
because it's extremely important

44
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:08,129
that you don't get stuck

45
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:09,769
in the cycle of charging no money

46
00:01:09,769 --> 00:01:10,129
at all.

47
00:01:10,299 --> 00:01:12,069
You have to be able to sign higher

48
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,069
ticket deals.

49
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:14,680
You have to do this because when

50
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,290
you properly convey the value of

51
00:01:16,299 --> 00:01:17,459
what you're selling,

52
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:18,890
you're able to both increase the

53
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,390
close rates and charge more money

54
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:21,269
at the same time.

55
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,329
And if you fail to do this, then

56
00:01:23,329 --> 00:01:24,840
you get the opposite of what I

57
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,579
just said.

58
00:01:25,659 --> 00:01:26,599
Your close rate goes down and you

59
00:01:26,859 --> 00:01:27,340
charge less money.

60
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:27,879
You know what I'm saying?

61
00:01:28,019 --> 00:01:29,230
That's not what you want because

62
00:01:29,269 --> 00:01:30,439
then you get stuck in this death

63
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:31,049
spiral cascade

64
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:32,400
and never being able to get rich.

65
00:01:32,439 --> 00:01:33,840
So literally the purpose of what

66
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,390
you're building this business for

67
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:36,209
is to get rich.

68
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:36,989
You know what I'm saying?

69
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,299
So to get rich, you have to charge

70
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:38,829
more money.

71
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,760
You have to get people to pay you

72
00:01:39,939 --> 00:01:40,079
more.

73
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,140
In order to get people to pay you

74
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,060
more, they got to understand the

75
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:42,780
value of what you're selling.

76
00:01:42,859 --> 00:01:43,620
So that's what this video is

77
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:43,980
about.

78
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:46,900
So why do people pay more?

79
00:01:46,939 --> 00:01:48,980
So the problem people have with

80
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:50,819
selling offers is that when

81
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:52,879
they're talking to potential

82
00:01:52,969 --> 00:01:53,319
clients,

83
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:55,150
they're not making the clients

84
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,129
understand the actual impact of

85
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,010
how much of a financial impact

86
00:01:59,109 --> 00:02:00,209
your service will make.

87
00:02:00,489 --> 00:02:00,700
Right?

88
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,730
If a client fails to understand

89
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:04,890
how much of a financial impact you

90
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:05,250
make,

91
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:07,640
they're not going to be interested

92
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,520
in buying.

93
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,258
It's really that simple.

94
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:11,330
The only thing they're concerned

95
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:13,150
with is how much money will this

96
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:13,870
make them.

97
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:14,479
Right?

98
00:02:14,789 --> 00:02:16,000
Everything else is bullshit.

99
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:19,219
95% of people will not explicitly

100
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,389
state this because they're too

101
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:23,240
much of a pussy to talk about it

102
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,379
or they're too scared to talk

103
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:25,050
about money.

104
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:27,300
99% of your competitors will not

105
00:02:27,629 --> 00:02:29,419
talk about this because they're

106
00:02:29,419 --> 00:02:31,039
too much of a pussy to talk about

107
00:02:31,129 --> 00:02:31,659
money.

108
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:34,449
But every single person running

109
00:02:34,449 --> 00:02:37,189
any agency or B2B offer that is

110
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,599
successful in any capacity

111
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,360
whatsoever is not afraid to talk

112
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,629
about money.

113
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,379
This is not something that you

114
00:02:45,449 --> 00:02:47,439
need to stop concealing this.

115
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,919
The reason why people buy is

116
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:50,789
because that they believe that the

117
00:02:50,789 --> 00:02:52,270
thing that they're going to

118
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,860
purchase from you is going to make

119
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:54,409
them more money.

120
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:55,360
That's it.

121
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,389
That's the only reason.

122
00:02:56,789 --> 00:02:57,849
There's zero other reason why

123
00:02:57,849 --> 00:02:58,750
anyone buys ever.

124
00:02:59,069 --> 00:02:59,599
Right?

125
00:03:00,099 --> 00:03:01,870
You can't not talk about this.

126
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,659
So here's the problem.

127
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:04,199
There's two ways to make a client

128
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:05,639
understand how impactful the

129
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:06,840
financial result is.

130
00:03:06,939 --> 00:03:08,979
So by using ROI calculators and by

131
00:03:08,979 --> 00:03:10,900
using client case studies.

132
00:03:11,129 --> 00:03:11,280
Right?

133
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:15,090
There's also explaining the

134
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:18,750
logistical intensity.

135
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:23,939
Three ways.

136
00:03:23,979 --> 00:03:25,150
So another important note is that

137
00:03:25,229 --> 00:03:26,169
you as a beginner will say some

138
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:26,879
stupid shit.

139
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:28,680
Like I can't promise clients

140
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,300
results because I'm scared and I

141
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,740
don't think I can get them the

142
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:32,289
result.

143
00:03:32,569 --> 00:03:32,780
Okay.

144
00:03:33,099 --> 00:03:34,900
Well, here's my argument to you.

145
00:03:35,129 --> 00:03:37,060
You better learn to stop that line

146
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:39,080
of thinking right now because if

147
00:03:39,139 --> 00:03:41,300
you're going to pull your punches

148
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,620
talking about results and not lead

149
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,879
people to logical conclusions that

150
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:47,889
they're going to make money with

151
00:03:47,889 --> 00:03:50,430
you, then you aren't going to sign

152
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,979
fucking anybody.

153
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:53,750
You know what I'm saying?

154
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,129
And you'll come to me and you'll

155
00:03:55,129 --> 00:03:56,550
say, Daniel, I can't close any

156
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:57,080
deals.

157
00:03:57,139 --> 00:03:58,729
And I'll say it's because none of

158
00:03:58,729 --> 00:04:00,360
the people you're talking to are

159
00:04:00,389 --> 00:04:02,120
confident in your ability to make

160
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,830
the money because you're too much

161
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:05,379
of a pussy to talk about actual

162
00:04:05,379 --> 00:04:07,120
numbers and project results.

163
00:04:08,379 --> 00:04:09,879
You have to stop doing this.

164
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:10,939
You have to talk about results.

165
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,219
You have to talk about the money.

166
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:12,680
Right?

167
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:13,490
So I cannot tell you how many

168
00:04:13,659 --> 00:04:14,689
times I see this shit over and

169
00:04:14,689 --> 00:04:15,280
over again.

170
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:17,360
I have coached thousands of

171
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,790
people, literally thousands of

172
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:20,509
you.

173
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,329
Do you want to know what stops

174
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:24,199
them from signing any deals or

175
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:26,189
making any substantially more

176
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:27,759
quantities of money?

177
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,910
It's they're not talking about

178
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,149
results and breaking down the math

179
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:34,300
with clients.

180
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,970
They're being vague about what

181
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:37,709
could potentially happen in the

182
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,600
engagement.

183
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:40,029
They say shit like, I can't

184
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,689
promise results because I'm not

185
00:04:41,769 --> 00:04:43,139
confident I can get those crazy

186
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:44,120
results.

187
00:04:44,449 --> 00:04:44,870
Okay.

188
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,500
Be poor then.

189
00:04:46,769 --> 00:04:47,300
Right?

190
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:49,019
So this is like saying, I can't go

191
00:04:49,019 --> 00:04:50,620
up and talk to that pretty girl.

192
00:04:50,889 --> 00:04:52,220
How do you know?

193
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:53,639
You've never tried it.

194
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,319
I can't lose 30 pounds and build

195
00:04:55,319 --> 00:04:55,819
muscle.

196
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:56,629
How do you know?

197
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:57,819
You've never tried it.

198
00:04:57,959 --> 00:04:59,199
I can't start that business and be

199
00:04:59,230 --> 00:04:59,750
successful.

200
00:05:00,069 --> 00:05:00,959
How do you know?

201
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:01,800
You've never tried it.

202
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:03,149
I can't get these crazy results

203
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:03,750
for clients.

204
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:04,629
How do you know?

205
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:05,819
You've never tried it.

206
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:07,279
You don't know.

207
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:08,639
You just made this shit up.

208
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,230
You literally, you literally sat

209
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:11,730
here and you said, I can't get the

210
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:12,829
client's results.

211
00:05:12,899 --> 00:05:14,279
You fucking made it up.

212
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:15,560
You literally made the shit up,

213
00:05:15,589 --> 00:05:16,000
right?

214
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:18,259
You, you, with like zero evidence.

215
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:20,600
In fact, you, you just, you just

216
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,529
determined, you sat here and

217
00:05:22,529 --> 00:05:23,610
determined.

218
00:05:24,069 --> 00:05:25,430
That you're going to steer your

219
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:26,750
life towards the maximum

220
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,329
probability of pessimism.

221
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,860
Not even give yourself a chance to

222
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:30,459
get rich.

223
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,639
That's literally what you did.

224
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:32,439
Right?

225
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:33,829
So I want to make this abundantly

226
00:05:33,889 --> 00:05:34,259
clear.

227
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,680
If you ever come to me with some

228
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:37,350
bullshit talking about how you're

229
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:38,319
not going to talk

230
00:05:38,589 --> 00:05:39,550
about numbers or use ROI

231
00:05:39,629 --> 00:05:41,350
calculators to project results or

232
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:43,100
use your client case studies when

233
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:44,220
you have them, or that you're not

234
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:45,329
comfortable talking about results

235
00:05:45,449 --> 00:05:46,319
or promised results.

236
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:47,100
I'm going to tell you this

237
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,060
straight to your face in front of

238
00:05:48,129 --> 00:05:49,379
everybody that your probability

239
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:51,079
of being a failure is extremely

240
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:51,560
high.

241
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,240
I get this a lot.

242
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:54,730
A lot of people say, they come to

243
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:56,319
me and they say, Daniel, you, you

244
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:57,240
like what they'll

245
00:05:57,279 --> 00:05:58,459
join client ascension or Olympia.

246
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,100
They'll join anything.

247
00:05:59,139 --> 00:06:00,379
They'll say, Daniel, what, what,

248
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:01,350
what, what are the traits of the

249
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:02,379
people who actually get

250
00:06:02,439 --> 00:06:02,860
results in here?

251
00:06:02,899 --> 00:06:03,629
Cause I want, I want to be one of

252
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:04,259
the best students.

253
00:06:04,529 --> 00:06:06,339
Like what, like, what do I have to

254
00:06:06,339 --> 00:06:08,069
do to be one of those guys?

255
00:06:08,339 --> 00:06:09,709
The answer is a rational

256
00:06:09,709 --> 00:06:11,699
confidence and confidence in

257
00:06:11,769 --> 00:06:14,339
yourself and just thinking, yes, I

258
00:06:14,339 --> 00:06:14,709
can do

259
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:14,819
it.

260
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,120
I can get the client's results.

261
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:16,920
I can do it.

262
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:19,620
That's, that's the separator.

263
00:06:20,329 --> 00:06:21,500
People who don't do that.

264
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:22,870
Those are the people who don't get

265
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:23,329
results.

266
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:24,189
You know what I'm saying?

267
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,009
It's so important that you follow

268
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:25,540
this.

269
00:06:25,579 --> 00:06:26,759
So of course, not all of your

270
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:28,370
clients are going to get results.

271
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:29,740
Are you going to do your very best

272
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:30,939
job to get them results?

273
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,439
Of course you are.

274
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:32,720
Right.

275
00:06:32,779 --> 00:06:34,439
But unless you talk about results

276
00:06:34,509 --> 00:06:36,000
and lead them to believe that

277
00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:37,839
they'll get results, there

278
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:39,389
is zero situation where you close

279
00:06:39,389 --> 00:06:39,980
anybody.

280
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,560
You, you will, you'll never even

281
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,439
get the opportunity.

282
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,360
So let me give you two examples of

283
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:45,730
clients I'm coaching.

284
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,589
So client number one, one of

285
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:49,689
these, one of these guys runs,

286
00:06:49,689 --> 00:06:51,439
runs a lead gen agency for

287
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,230
PR firms, right?

288
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:53,670
So previously he wasn't able to

289
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,129
close many deals and the deals he

290
00:06:55,129 --> 00:06:56,220
did close were very low

291
00:06:56,259 --> 00:06:56,480
ticket.

292
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:57,829
So not getting paid much money at

293
00:06:57,829 --> 00:06:58,139
all.

294
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:59,430
So now after coaching him for

295
00:06:59,449 --> 00:07:01,089
three months, cause he's listening

296
00:07:01,089 --> 00:07:02,649
to what I'm saying, he's

297
00:07:02,949 --> 00:07:04,110
closing four to eight K and one

298
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,680
deals for Cody, my lead gen.

299
00:07:06,649 --> 00:07:09,399
What changed how, how, how exactly

300
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:10,720
did this app?

301
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:12,779
So we made sales assets for him to

302
00:07:12,779 --> 00:07:14,529
share on calls that show two

303
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,230
things.

304
00:07:15,339 --> 00:07:17,019
So first is that there's an ROI

305
00:07:17,089 --> 00:07:19,060
calculator that breaks down the

306
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:21,100
math of the possible results.

307
00:07:21,139 --> 00:07:22,750
So it takes into account the email

308
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,269
sent reply rate, call booking

309
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:25,610
rates, and therefore how

310
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:27,139
many calls we booked based on

311
00:07:27,139 --> 00:07:28,870
volume call closing rate that the

312
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:30,600
client says that they can achieve

313
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,079
how much the client charges, the

314
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:33,629
profit margin the client operates

315
00:07:33,629 --> 00:07:34,740
at, and then takes into

316
00:07:35,009 --> 00:07:35,980
account how much he charges and

317
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:37,319
calculates a projected amount of

318
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:38,410
profit over the next year

319
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:38,899
for the client.

320
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:39,730
If those numbers hold true.

321
00:07:39,899 --> 00:07:42,509
So the numbers here regularly

322
00:07:42,509 --> 00:07:46,110
point to an ROI of 10 to 50 X, not

323
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:48,560
three X high, absolutely

324
00:07:48,829 --> 00:07:50,149
extreme returns because we're

325
00:07:50,149 --> 00:07:51,649
taking into account LTV of the

326
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:52,279
client.

327
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,110
We're, we're, we're doing this

328
00:07:54,139 --> 00:07:55,110
with optimism.

329
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:56,220
The client says that they can

330
00:07:56,449 --> 00:07:56,990
close this amount.

331
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:57,699
Okay, Mr.

332
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:58,870
Client, you said that you can

333
00:07:59,009 --> 00:07:59,939
close this amount and you charge

334
00:08:00,269 --> 00:08:00,779
this much.

335
00:08:00,819 --> 00:08:01,480
And this is your problem.

336
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,709
This is how much you would make.

337
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:05,759
We did the math and this is how

338
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,350
much I would charge to, to do that

339
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:08,209
on a monthly basis.

340
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:09,740
So let's calculate this, this ROI

341
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:10,980
that you're going to get.

342
00:08:11,019 --> 00:08:13,209
It's basic, simple math, right?

343
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:14,040
So what does this do?

344
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:16,370
If the return only calculates for

345
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,209
the client and it shows them

346
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:20,079
making like a three to five

347
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,319
X return, it's muscle.

348
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,149
It's much less exciting, right?

349
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,759
So he's talking to proper large

350
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:25,879
companies, right?

351
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,189
So like 10 calls booked or three

352
00:08:28,529 --> 00:08:30,319
client sign is not an impressive

353
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,038
or eye turning result.

354
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,720
Why would anybody give a fuck

355
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,538
about signing three clients or

356
00:08:35,538 --> 00:08:37,080
booking 10 calls?

357
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,149
I signed 10 to 15 clients per day,

358
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:44,899
book 40 to 50 calls per day.

359
00:08:45,139 --> 00:08:46,679
Why the fuck would I even bother

360
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:48,470
having a conversation with you for

361
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:51,259
three clients signed or 10 calls

362
00:08:51,259 --> 00:08:51,620
booked?

363
00:08:51,889 --> 00:08:53,860
When you say these numbers, it

364
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:56,129
only gets low level clients who

365
00:08:56,539 --> 00:08:58,509
think that's a lot excited.

366
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,330
You need to quote higher numbers,

367
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:02,899
even if you've never done it

368
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:03,659
before.

369
00:09:03,929 --> 00:09:04,440
Why?

370
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:06,429
Because you need to shoot so much

371
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,259
higher.

372
00:09:07,299 --> 00:09:08,799
You need to not be a fucking pussy

373
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:09,860
about it, right?

374
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:11,379
So nobody who is capable of

375
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:13,460
spending any significant amount of

376
00:09:13,529 --> 00:09:15,549
money is going to be willing to do

377
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:17,289
so unless you are saying numbers

378
00:09:17,289 --> 00:09:19,009
that are within paying attention

379
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:20,149
distance to them.

380
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,169
You're selling to people who are

381
00:09:22,169 --> 00:09:24,350
millionaires saying pussy little

382
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,279
results gets you ignored.

383
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,539
If you tell me, Daniel, I'll

384
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:28,519
guarantee you signed three

385
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:29,279
clients.

386
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,700
It doesn't matter.

387
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:32,940
That's it's not even worth the

388
00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:35,659
time it takes to talk to you.

389
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,960
And I'm the kind of person you

390
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:38,210
want to, I can afford to pay

391
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:39,840
$10,000 per month.

392
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:41,360
I can do that.

393
00:09:41,629 --> 00:09:43,190
Get what I'm saying?

394
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:46,009
So second, his client case

395
00:09:46,009 --> 00:09:48,179
studies, which breaks down how

396
00:09:48,179 --> 00:09:50,899
much money was made, money, right?

397
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,200
So of course you don't start out

398
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:53,120
with this, right?

399
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:53,929
But two things are important here.

400
00:09:54,059 --> 00:09:55,350
You need to be completely fucking

401
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:56,639
obsessed with collecting these

402
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:57,480
things, right?

403
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,190
So specifically showing how much

404
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:00,139
money was made.

405
00:10:00,179 --> 00:10:01,860
It has to show the money.

406
00:10:02,149 --> 00:10:04,149
You need to know contract signed,

407
00:10:04,149 --> 00:10:06,220
cash collected, et cetera.

408
00:10:06,259 --> 00:10:07,779
If you can't get that, get the

409
00:10:07,779 --> 00:10:09,700
next best quantifiable result.

410
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,360
If you can't get any quantifiable

411
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,759
results, it's useless.

412
00:10:13,059 --> 00:10:14,139
I don't care if you have to pay

413
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:14,850
for it, right?

414
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,580
So I had, I had another guy tell

415
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:18,320
me he's been gradually upping his

416
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:18,980
prices.

417
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:20,809
So once he reached 4k a month, he

418
00:10:20,889 --> 00:10:22,899
started facing some resistance and

419
00:10:22,899 --> 00:10:23,960
I asked him to show

420
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:25,830
me a sales deck and the results he

421
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,710
had on the sales deck showed one

422
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:28,960
person who got actual

423
00:10:29,289 --> 00:10:30,080
dollar results.

424
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:32,590
So the rest of them were pipeline

425
00:10:32,649 --> 00:10:33,440
generated.

426
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,240
You got to stop with this

427
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:35,269
bullshit, right?

428
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,120
So nobody gives a fuck about

429
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:37,149
pipeline generated.

430
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:39,250
Everybody knows this means you

431
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:40,419
made no money.

432
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,440
That's what it means.

433
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,830
If you have one case study that

434
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,340
shows dollars and then all, and

435
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:45,620
you got like fucking six of

436
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,240
them that say pipeline generated,

437
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,649
pipeline generated, pipeline

438
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:49,279
generated.

439
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:50,799
That's code word for I didn't make

440
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:52,019
them any fucking money.

441
00:10:52,289 --> 00:10:53,399
Everyone knows this.

442
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,190
It's not just this.

443
00:10:54,259 --> 00:10:55,210
You're like, you're not tricking

444
00:10:55,419 --> 00:10:55,600
people.

445
00:10:55,639 --> 00:10:56,659
They're not retarded, right?

446
00:10:56,759 --> 00:10:58,309
So they, they know that's what it

447
00:10:58,309 --> 00:10:59,200
fucking means.

448
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,559
It's better to not even put the

449
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:01,279
shit there.

450
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,360
If you're going to say pipeline

451
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,460
generated, how much money cash

452
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,460
collected was fucking made.

453
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,019
Well, did you make money or did

454
00:11:09,019 --> 00:11:10,159
you not make money?

455
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,490
You need to be abundantly fucking

456
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:12,379
clear about this.

457
00:11:12,419 --> 00:11:13,840
And if you can't get that, it's

458
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,639
completely useless case study.

459
00:11:15,929 --> 00:11:17,909
And if you can't, you need to at

460
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:20,620
least get qualified sales calls

461
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:21,539
booked.

462
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,360
And even that is not magnificent

463
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,480
enough, right?

464
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:25,820
You see, nobody gives a shit about

465
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:26,710
pipeline, right?

466
00:11:26,779 --> 00:11:28,950
So stop making excuses and do

467
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:31,649
whatever you need to do to get it,

468
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:32,409
right?

469
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,269
Because you really do not seem to

470
00:11:34,269 --> 00:11:36,230
understand how exactly important

471
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:37,580
getting the quantifiable

472
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:39,440
dollar value case studies are,

473
00:11:39,539 --> 00:11:40,159
right?

474
00:11:40,429 --> 00:11:41,990
Completely leave the pipeline

475
00:11:42,059 --> 00:11:43,600
bullshit out and just say

476
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,590
qualified sales calls booked if

477
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:45,659
you

478
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:46,100
can't get that.

479
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:47,929
So not opportunities or whatever

480
00:11:48,059 --> 00:11:49,639
other dumb shit or leads.

481
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:50,450
It's calls booked or cash

482
00:11:50,929 --> 00:11:51,279
collected.

483
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:51,759
That's it.

484
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:52,889
Anything else literally is

485
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:53,379
useless.

486
00:11:53,419 --> 00:11:55,480
It actually counter sells.

487
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,639
If you, if you scoot around it,

488
00:11:57,639 --> 00:11:59,799
like, Oh, I did this person got

489
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:01,840
this many opportunities.

490
00:12:01,879 --> 00:12:03,519
It's like, it's a, it's a dumb as

491
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,029
fuck way to try to explain that

492
00:12:05,029 --> 00:12:06,360
you're getting, everybody

493
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:07,970
knows it means that you didn't

494
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:08,700
make money.

495
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,740
So I used to give away consulting

496
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,879
calls, lead lists and PayPal's to

497
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,559
get some of my first students

498
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,710
to post quantifiable results on

499
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:16,789
Twitter so that I could retweet

500
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:17,919
the tweets that they posted.

501
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:19,919
It had to show how many clients I

502
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:21,519
signed and how much money they

503
00:12:21,549 --> 00:12:22,049
made.

504
00:12:22,139 --> 00:12:23,090
If it didn't include that, it was

505
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:23,759
fucking worth it.

506
00:12:23,799 --> 00:12:24,559
It was literally completely worth

507
00:12:24,669 --> 00:12:24,860
it.

508
00:12:24,899 --> 00:12:26,519
So here's our quantifiable case

509
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:28,179
studies and results posted.

510
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:30,070
So, uh, let's get, for instance,

511
00:12:30,139 --> 00:12:31,710
this is a playlist of let's get

512
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:32,960
here's people make it.

513
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:33,769
It's money.

514
00:12:34,039 --> 00:12:35,120
It's showing how much money was

515
00:12:35,289 --> 00:12:35,480
made.

516
00:12:35,539 --> 00:12:37,200
You know what I'm saying?

517
00:12:39,539 --> 00:12:40,419
Client ascension, this is my

518
00:12:40,419 --> 00:12:40,879
YouTube.

519
00:12:41,149 --> 00:12:42,940
What's here?

520
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:43,740
It's fucking money.

521
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:45,509
30K a month, 50K a month, 100K a

522
00:12:45,509 --> 00:12:47,250
month, 500K a month, 200K a month,

523
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,600
132K a month, 150K a

524
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:50,600
month, 70K a month, 32K a month,

525
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,649
45K a month, 23K a month, 80K a

526
00:12:52,649 --> 00:12:54,500
month, 40K a month, 44K a

527
00:12:54,539 --> 00:12:54,620
month.

528
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:56,019
Some of these could be refreshed

529
00:12:56,029 --> 00:12:57,330
because these people have made

530
00:12:57,409 --> 00:12:58,730
like a substantially shit ton

531
00:12:58,779 --> 00:12:59,200
more money.

532
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,759
Um, the same Andre has the same

533
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:01,299
thing.

534
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:01,779
It's money.

535
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:02,259
It's money.

536
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:03,110
It's the only thing that matters.

537
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:04,000
It's fucking money.

538
00:13:04,269 --> 00:13:05,240
Everything else is bullshit.

539
00:13:05,299 --> 00:13:07,870
So, so, so what did I have this

540
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:08,740
guy do?

541
00:13:08,779 --> 00:13:09,830
So we had to take all of his case

542
00:13:10,049 --> 00:13:10,980
studies, throw them in a document

543
00:13:11,309 --> 00:13:12,139
with, with screenshots,

544
00:13:12,409 --> 00:13:13,860
proving the results, and then

545
00:13:13,929 --> 00:13:15,809
share the document on sales calls

546
00:13:15,809 --> 00:13:17,649
and, and a VSL and in pre-call

547
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:17,960
assets.

548
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,539
Oh, you got a call booked, but

549
00:13:19,539 --> 00:13:21,220
send this fucking document with

550
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,500
all the case studies on it.

551
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:23,590
Like, here's some results that we

552
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:24,200
got from clients.

553
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,259
So of course you can close people

554
00:13:26,259 --> 00:13:28,269
without this, but not if you're

555
00:13:28,309 --> 00:13:29,889
quoting tiny little pussy

556
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:30,710
results, right?

557
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:31,649
So here's all the objections.

558
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,870
This, this client gave me over a

559
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:33,799
time working together.

560
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,360
He goes, all my clients have a

561
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,009
hard time closing the deal.

562
00:13:37,059 --> 00:13:37,809
So I feel like a fraud when

563
00:13:38,019 --> 00:13:39,200
they're not getting deals closed.

564
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:39,679
Okay.

565
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:40,820
So here's what I explained to him.

566
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:43,909
The vast majority of clients, 90%

567
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,629
plus in any industry or niche, no

568
00:13:46,629 --> 00:13:48,769
matter what they or

569
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,379
you are selling are going to have

570
00:13:50,379 --> 00:13:51,840
a hard time closing deals.

571
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:53,360
Every client you ever sell for the

572
00:13:53,379 --> 00:13:54,919
rest of your life will be terrible

573
00:13:54,919 --> 00:13:55,559
at sales.

574
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:57,269
All of them, the rest of your

575
00:13:57,269 --> 00:13:59,159
life, no matter what you sell to

576
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:00,960
every single one of your clients,

577
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
it can be dog shit at sales.

578
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:02,740
Why?

579
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:04,570
Because every human on the planet

580
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,519
running any business has both a

581
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:07,580
dog shit offer and

582
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:08,379
is dog shit at sales.

583
00:14:08,769 --> 00:14:10,110
10% of clients make 90% of

584
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:10,720
results.

585
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,549
This is not a unique issue to you.

586
00:14:12,889 --> 00:14:14,639
This is everybody in existence.

587
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:16,230
All of your clients will be shitty

588
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:16,840
at sales.

589
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:18,419
You have to coach them through it,

590
00:14:18,419 --> 00:14:18,879
right?

591
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:20,139
You got to explain to them.

592
00:14:20,179 --> 00:14:22,379
So because only your clients that

593
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:24,649
understand that the reason they

594
00:14:25,059 --> 00:14:26,779
make any sales is because

595
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,250
they are showing their prospects

596
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:29,710
quotes of potential results that

597
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:31,039
are within paying attention

598
00:14:31,309 --> 00:14:31,419
distance.

599
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:33,129
So this is always going to be the

600
00:14:33,129 --> 00:14:33,639
case.

601
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:34,779
Not every client is going to get

602
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:35,259
results.

603
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,820
That's why it's your job to help

604
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,519
them get better if they're having

605
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:39,330
this issue.

606
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:41,590
The same lessons I'm giving you

607
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:43,899
now, you have to give to them.

608
00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:45,940
You have to be their coach, even

609
00:14:46,009 --> 00:14:47,769
if you're not selling a coaching

610
00:14:47,769 --> 00:14:48,500
program.

611
00:14:48,539 --> 00:14:49,789
So what happens when you coach

612
00:14:49,809 --> 00:14:51,139
them through this concept that

613
00:14:51,139 --> 00:14:52,440
they need to be talking about

614
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:52,919
results?

615
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,039
And the only way they'll ever make

616
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:55,029
any sales is if the prospects

617
00:14:55,029 --> 00:14:56,129
believe they'll get a return

618
00:14:56,179 --> 00:14:57,330
on an investment, you're going to

619
00:14:57,429 --> 00:14:58,379
get pushback from the clients in

620
00:14:58,710 --> 00:14:59,399
exactly the same fashion

621
00:14:59,669 --> 00:15:01,129
that you're going to fucking say

622
00:15:01,129 --> 00:15:02,940
this bullshit pushback to me, but

623
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,389
your clients aren't going

624
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,639
to get results without doing this.

625
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:06,389
And you're not going to get

626
00:15:06,389 --> 00:15:07,360
results without doing this.

627
00:15:07,649 --> 00:15:08,750
Fucking nobody's getting results

628
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:09,610
without doing this.

629
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:10,590
You know what I'm saying?

630
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:13,360
So you have a responsibility to

631
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,259
implement this yourself and quote

632
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:18,559
big paying attention distance

633
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:19,840
numbers, and then also get your

634
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:21,019
clients to do the same thing so

635
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:22,080
they can get results,

636
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:22,860
right?

637
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:24,320
You know, what if they still

638
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,379
refuse to do this?

639
00:15:25,769 --> 00:15:27,639
Then it's their fault.

640
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:28,840
They're not getting results.

641
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:30,669
And you tell them this to their

642
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:32,850
face if they're going to complain

643
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:34,220
about it, right?

644
00:15:34,259 --> 00:15:35,340
You made it abundantly clear to

645
00:15:35,509 --> 00:15:36,250
them when you started the

646
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:36,899
engagement.

647
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:37,700
Like, yeah, if you want to sign

648
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:38,730
these bigger ticket deals, you're

649
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:39,480
going to need these case

650
00:15:39,539 --> 00:15:39,759
studies.

651
00:15:39,799 --> 00:15:40,570
You're going to need this ROI

652
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:41,220
calculator.

653
00:15:41,259 --> 00:15:42,720
You're going to start quoting like

654
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,190
substantially bigger results,

655
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:44,679
right?

656
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:46,809
Just as exactly as I'm doing to

657
00:15:46,809 --> 00:15:48,039
you right now.

658
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,129
If you made the same mistake, if

659
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,169
you come to me and talk about how

660
00:15:50,169 --> 00:15:50,870
you can't close any

661
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,710
deals and I investigate the

662
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:52,759
situation to see that you're

663
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,159
talking about little tiny baby

664
00:15:54,409 --> 00:15:55,409
pussy results, and you start

665
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:56,759
giving me these same objections

666
00:15:56,759 --> 00:15:57,840
I've talked about in this

667
00:15:58,129 --> 00:15:59,299
video, guess what I'm going to

668
00:15:59,299 --> 00:15:59,649
say?

669
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,269
I want to say that you're not

670
00:16:01,269 --> 00:16:03,159
listening to me and your failure

671
00:16:03,159 --> 00:16:04,690
is your own fault because

672
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,100
you're not doing what I'm telling

673
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:06,529
you to do.

674
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:08,860
No, Daniel, I'm not getting

675
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:09,559
results.

676
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,360
It's a gap because you're not

677
00:16:10,429 --> 00:16:11,350
fucking listening to me.

678
00:16:11,419 --> 00:16:12,740
That's the same frame you need to

679
00:16:12,769 --> 00:16:14,049
have with your clients if they

680
00:16:14,049 --> 00:16:15,159
complain about getting

681
00:16:15,429 --> 00:16:15,600
results.

682
00:16:15,659 --> 00:16:16,759
Get what I'm saying?

683
00:16:17,029 --> 00:16:17,549
This works.

684
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:19,429
If you don't do it, then you will

685
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:20,580
not succeed.

686
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:22,230
I'm telling you this and I'm so

687
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:23,799
adamant about this and I'm so

688
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,419
fucking flared up about this

689
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:26,620
because it's the truth.

690
00:16:26,889 --> 00:16:28,860
This is how this shit is, right?

691
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,429
So the same applies to your

692
00:16:30,429 --> 00:16:31,100
clients.

693
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:32,659
You must take this same exact

694
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:34,320
frame I have with you and say the

695
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:35,610
same thing to them if it

696
00:16:35,909 --> 00:16:37,340
happens, right?

697
00:16:37,379 --> 00:16:38,330
So here's another objection he's

698
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:38,759
giving me.

699
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:40,059
My clients are saying the leads

700
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:40,960
are unqualified.

701
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:42,509
Okay, the client is saying this

702
00:16:42,509 --> 00:16:44,049
because the leads didn't close,

703
00:16:44,129 --> 00:16:44,720
right?

704
00:16:44,779 --> 00:16:46,549
And they go, the leads are saying

705
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:48,460
to them, I have to think about it,

706
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:49,059
right?

707
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,639
All my leads are coming to me and

708
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,240
they're saying that the leads I

709
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,570
give them or all my clients

710
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:54,360
are coming to me and they're

711
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,299
saying that the leads I give them

712
00:16:55,299 --> 00:16:56,059
are saying I have to think

713
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:56,379
about it.

714
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,190
So they're saying that the leads

715
00:16:57,379 --> 00:16:57,879
aren't qualified.

716
00:16:58,149 --> 00:16:59,889
Okay, why do their leads have to

717
00:16:59,889 --> 00:17:01,049
think about it?

718
00:17:02,129 --> 00:17:03,120
Because the offer isn't enticing

719
00:17:03,169 --> 00:17:03,580
enough.

720
00:17:03,639 --> 00:17:05,410
The quoted results are not there.

721
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,130
They have to think about what they

722
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:08,730
have to think about is because the

723
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:09,818
value proposition

724
00:17:09,859 --> 00:17:10,809
or quoted results is so

725
00:17:11,109 --> 00:17:12,359
insignificantly small that they

726
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:14,000
don't give a fuck about it at all.

727
00:17:14,269 --> 00:17:15,680
Right?

728
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,359
If this client is on the phone

729
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:20,789
trying to charge $5,000 or $10,000

730
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:22,279
and there's no talk about

731
00:17:22,549 --> 00:17:24,000
financial return or payback

732
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,880
periods, of course they need to

733
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:26,818
think about it.

734
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:28,779
Because what they're thinking

735
00:17:28,779 --> 00:17:29,650
about is what the possible

736
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:31,230
financial return and payback

737
00:17:31,299 --> 00:17:31,480
period

738
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:32,660
is because fucking you didn't talk

739
00:17:32,789 --> 00:17:33,119
about it.

740
00:17:33,349 --> 00:17:34,559
That's what they're thinking

741
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:34,950
about.

742
00:17:35,099 --> 00:17:36,359
So now the client is going to go

743
00:17:36,369 --> 00:17:37,720
make some shit up by themselves

744
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,859
because you didn't talk

745
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:39,920
about it and they're going to be

746
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:41,089
pessimistic and then they're going

747
00:17:41,259 --> 00:17:42,180
to come to the conclusion

748
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:42,980
that this is a waste of time and

749
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,000
money because the return isn't

750
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:44,359
there.

751
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,609
And why did they conclude that the

752
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:46,539
return isn't there?

753
00:17:46,809 --> 00:17:48,529
Because you didn't guide their

754
00:17:48,529 --> 00:17:50,460
thinking to what the possible

755
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:52,230
return could fucking be.

756
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:53,829
So they're automatically going to

757
00:17:53,829 --> 00:17:55,130
default to the most pessimistic

758
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:56,230
option because everybody

759
00:17:56,279 --> 00:17:57,559
in the world is a big fat fucking

760
00:17:57,559 --> 00:17:57,960
pussy.

761
00:17:58,289 --> 00:17:59,319
That's why.

762
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:02,240
So you need to guide these people.

763
00:18:02,509 --> 00:18:04,319
You need to move them to the

764
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:05,839
understanding.

765
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:07,220
Working with you is going to

766
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,910
generate this return because this

767
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:10,240
is how the numbers work out.

768
00:18:10,279 --> 00:18:11,039
They work like this, this, this,

769
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:11,960
this, this, this, this, this.

770
00:18:12,059 --> 00:18:13,259
If you let the client do that shit

771
00:18:13,309 --> 00:18:14,599
by themselves, it's always going

772
00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:15,829
to be pessimistic and they're

773
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:16,910
going to go think about it, but

774
00:18:17,099 --> 00:18:18,059
they're going to think about some

775
00:18:18,059 --> 00:18:19,380
fucking bullshit that

776
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:20,039
isn't true.

777
00:18:20,309 --> 00:18:23,380
You need to guide their thinking.

778
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:24,809
You can't let them just do this by

779
00:18:24,819 --> 00:18:25,960
themselves, right?

780
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,829
So you know what would have saved

781
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:27,319
this?

782
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:29,329
If you used an ROI calculator and

783
00:18:29,329 --> 00:18:31,339
quoted the results yourself and

784
00:18:31,339 --> 00:18:32,960
you quoted big results,

785
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:33,579
right?

786
00:18:33,619 --> 00:18:35,299
So I had to give the same exact

787
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:36,769
talk to my students.

788
00:18:36,819 --> 00:18:38,059
I just give the same exact talk to

789
00:18:38,089 --> 00:18:39,339
my students that he needs to give

790
00:18:39,349 --> 00:18:40,359
these same lessons to

791
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,680
his clients and that this is going

792
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,589
to persist forever.

793
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,970
You're never going to escape this

794
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:44,680
with clients.

795
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:45,829
This is always how it's going to

796
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:46,910
be for the rest of your life.

797
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:48,480
Everybody's going to be like this.

798
00:18:48,539 --> 00:18:49,579
This is not something that's

799
00:18:49,769 --> 00:18:50,200
unique to you.

800
00:18:50,299 --> 00:18:52,500
It's always going to be like this.

801
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:53,980
So unless you take the lessons I'm

802
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:55,299
teaching you right now, not only

803
00:18:55,299 --> 00:18:56,259
are you going to suffer

804
00:18:56,359 --> 00:18:57,329
from these problems in your own

805
00:18:57,609 --> 00:18:58,440
business, you're also going to

806
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,509
suffer in the form that any

807
00:18:59,509 --> 00:18:59,880
clients

808
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,150
who do manage to sign are going to

809
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:02,480
bitch and complain about it.

810
00:19:02,519 --> 00:19:04,200
So about if you can't make them

811
00:19:04,269 --> 00:19:06,450
understand how reality works, this

812
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:07,980
is how reality works.

813
00:19:08,019 --> 00:19:08,680
You know what I'm saying?

814
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:10,359
Okay, cool.

815
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,750
So client number two, this guy in

816
00:19:11,769 --> 00:19:13,190
my initial conversations with him

817
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,160
was also running a lead

818
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:14,539
gen agency.

819
00:19:14,579 --> 00:19:15,519
So the business was going fine.

820
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,470
His problem upon me investigating

821
00:19:17,539 --> 00:19:19,299
was actually a mindset issue.

822
00:19:19,339 --> 00:19:20,109
So he was scared of getting client

823
00:19:20,589 --> 00:19:20,759
results.

824
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:22,319
So he regularly signs clients,

825
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:23,950
sends like a thousand cold emails

826
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:25,420
per day, gets deals closed,

827
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:26,539
but was operating under the same

828
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:27,660
mental blocker that wouldn't allow

829
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:28,779
him to scale past that.

830
00:19:28,819 --> 00:19:30,609
So what was that mental blocker?

831
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,289
It's he was scared of signing more

832
00:19:32,289 --> 00:19:33,990
clients because that means having

833
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:35,150
to deliver for more clients

834
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,609
and having to deliver for more

835
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:37,970
clients means more possibility

836
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:39,170
that some clients don't get

837
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:39,420
results

838
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:41,250
and get mad at him, right?

839
00:19:41,569 --> 00:19:41,779
Okay.

840
00:19:42,029 --> 00:19:43,200
Well, yes, he might have a

841
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,000
justification for why he's scared

842
00:19:45,019 --> 00:19:45,589
of this.

843
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,960
It might be happening to him right

844
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,279
now.

845
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:48,599
A majority of his clients might

846
00:19:48,599 --> 00:19:50,759
not be getting results, but do you

847
00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:53,559
want to know why his clients

848
00:19:53,619 --> 00:19:54,450
might not be getting results?

849
00:19:54,869 --> 00:19:56,829
Because he was quoting low as fuck

850
00:19:56,829 --> 00:19:59,460
results, complete pussy numbers.

851
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,720
It wasn't doing enough volume for

852
00:20:00,769 --> 00:20:01,930
his clients to get results in the

853
00:20:02,029 --> 00:20:02,549
first place.

854
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,450
I'm talking 5,000 emails per month

855
00:20:04,579 --> 00:20:04,859
total.

856
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,170
Why, what, why was he only doing

857
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:08,049
this much?

858
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,819
Why was he only sending 5,000

859
00:20:09,819 --> 00:20:11,369
emails per month for his clients?

860
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:11,839
Right?

861
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,079
So, because, because, like, what

862
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,299
do you think would happen to this

863
00:20:16,299 --> 00:20:18,700
client if he sends 50,000

864
00:20:19,109 --> 00:20:20,339
emails per month per client?

865
00:20:20,599 --> 00:20:22,170
Well, yeah, the results of, say

866
00:20:22,299 --> 00:20:23,940
he's got 10 clients and he's

867
00:20:24,009 --> 00:20:26,140
sending 5,000 emails per month

868
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:26,619
for each client.

869
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:28,200
And now instead of 5,000 a month,

870
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,619
he starts sending 50,000 per

871
00:20:29,619 --> 00:20:30,019
month.

872
00:20:30,059 --> 00:20:31,000
What do you think would happen?

873
00:20:31,099 --> 00:20:32,480
The results would be 10 times

874
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:32,890
better.

875
00:20:33,019 --> 00:20:33,910
Do you think his clients would be

876
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:34,809
happier with 10 times more

877
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:35,220
results?

878
00:20:35,339 --> 00:20:36,519
Of course they would.

879
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:37,769
But then he says, but then he says

880
00:20:37,829 --> 00:20:39,690
to me, but that would cost more

881
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:40,710
money to do.

882
00:20:40,759 --> 00:20:42,869
It would cost more money to send

883
00:20:42,869 --> 00:20:47,019
50,000 emails instead of 5,000.

884
00:20:47,289 --> 00:20:49,640
No fucking shit.

885
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:52,259
Charge the client more money to

886
00:20:52,259 --> 00:20:55,170
compensate for the extra amount of

887
00:20:55,259 --> 00:20:56,529
money it takes to fucking

888
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,380
send 10 times more results.

889
00:20:58,460 --> 00:20:58,700
Right?

890
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,440
So, this solves two things at the

891
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,069
same time.

892
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,839
It allows you to quote higher

893
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:04,799
results in your ROI calculator

894
00:21:04,819 --> 00:21:06,960
because the input is 10 times

895
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:08,450
larger and it increases the

896
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:10,180
probability of clients getting

897
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,190
results because also your input is

898
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:13,009
10 times higher.

899
00:21:13,309 --> 00:21:13,740
Right?

900
00:21:13,779 --> 00:21:15,980
So, now you get to make more money

901
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:18,039
and at the same time get better

902
00:21:18,039 --> 00:21:19,430
results because you

903
00:21:19,769 --> 00:21:21,559
started quoting higher results.

904
00:21:21,829 --> 00:21:23,019
Right?

905
00:21:23,059 --> 00:21:24,019
So, this is the problem when

906
00:21:24,019 --> 00:21:25,059
you're okay with little pussy

907
00:21:25,059 --> 00:21:26,240
numbers because you don't want

908
00:21:26,299 --> 00:21:27,539
to say a big number to the client.

909
00:21:27,809 --> 00:21:30,519
Because you charge so little, you

910
00:21:30,519 --> 00:21:33,170
can't do what is required to get

911
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:35,720
them really good results.

912
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,200
And if you can't do what is

913
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:38,769
required to get them really good

914
00:21:38,819 --> 00:21:40,279
results, you don't get good

915
00:21:40,529 --> 00:21:40,900
results for them.

916
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:42,400
And that is when your clients get

917
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,730
mad or get frustrated or like

918
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:45,089
fucking ask for their money

919
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:45,920
back because you didn't fucking

920
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:47,160
produce shit for them because you

921
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,059
didn't charge them enough

922
00:21:48,329 --> 00:21:49,890
money to warrant getting them

923
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,799
results in the first place.

924
00:21:51,859 --> 00:21:52,930
That's what happens when you

925
00:21:53,109 --> 00:21:54,019
charge so little money.

926
00:21:54,059 --> 00:21:55,200
You fucking can't get them

927
00:21:55,329 --> 00:21:55,740
results.

928
00:21:55,819 --> 00:21:56,579
It's completely impossible.

929
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:57,450
You know what I'm saying?

930
00:21:57,539 --> 00:22:00,569
So, your projected results you're

931
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:02,710
giving are too small.

932
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:04,440
Right?

933
00:22:04,539 --> 00:22:05,849
The amount of money, this is the

934
00:22:05,849 --> 00:22:07,099
problem when you're okay with

935
00:22:07,099 --> 00:22:07,940
pussy numbers.

936
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:08,579
Everything gets worse.

937
00:22:08,619 --> 00:22:08,799
Right?

938
00:22:08,839 --> 00:22:09,609
So, this is all fear-based.

939
00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:10,519
You need to stop being fearful.

940
00:22:10,619 --> 00:22:11,549
So, like, here's an ROI

941
00:22:11,869 --> 00:22:12,220
calculator.

942
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:13,009
Right?

943
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:14,920
So, this is an example of an ROI

944
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,680
calculator at Liskit for cold

945
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,289
email.

946
00:22:17,359 --> 00:22:18,799
And you can make this shit

947
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:19,529
yourself.

948
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:19,950
Right?

949
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:20,759
You can do it in Bolt.

950
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:22,339
Maybe we'll make a tutorial on how

951
00:22:22,369 --> 00:22:22,900
to do it.

952
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:23,660
But you can do it in Google

953
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:24,079
Sheets.

954
00:22:24,119 --> 00:22:25,900
It's just breaking down the simple

955
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:26,779
math of this.

956
00:22:26,819 --> 00:22:28,079
And I'll be honest with you.

957
00:22:28,119 --> 00:22:29,089
I don't want to be like a dickhead

958
00:22:29,369 --> 00:22:29,759
saying this.

959
00:22:29,819 --> 00:22:31,140
But if you can't logically

960
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:32,970
conclude the components that are

961
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,480
involved in getting results,

962
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:36,170
for somebody, like, you're kind of

963
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:37,190
fucking retarded.

964
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,819
Like, this is not some, like,

965
00:22:38,819 --> 00:22:40,539
wildly complex thing to create in

966
00:22:40,539 --> 00:22:41,559
Google Sheets.

967
00:22:41,599 --> 00:22:42,960
It's literally just like, you know

968
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:43,660
how to do math.

969
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:43,920
Right?

970
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:45,220
Like, you took eighth grade

971
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:45,750
algebra.

972
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:46,480
It's not hard.

973
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:46,859
Right?

974
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:48,579
So, let's say we're on the gold

975
00:22:48,579 --> 00:22:49,599
plan over here.

976
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,240
We get the average reply rate,

977
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,579
which is 1.5%.

978
00:22:52,619 --> 00:22:53,380
And then we have these things

979
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:54,400
called offer variables.

980
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:55,119
Right?

981
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,539
So, there's case studies, social

982
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:57,890
presence, specific measurable

983
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,140
claim, and a guarantee.

984
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:00,549
The more of these offer variables

985
00:23:00,549 --> 00:23:01,980
you have, the better the response

986
00:23:02,019 --> 00:23:02,480
rates.

987
00:23:02,519 --> 00:23:03,220
I'm sorry.

988
00:23:03,259 --> 00:23:04,220
The better the conversion rates.

989
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:04,660
Right?

990
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:05,799
So, if you have three offer

991
00:23:06,029 --> 00:23:06,940
variables, it goes up.

992
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,230
If you have four offer variables,

993
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:08,759
it goes up.

994
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:09,559
Let's say somebody has three.

995
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:09,900
Right?

996
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:11,619
So, they have case studies, social

997
00:23:11,619 --> 00:23:12,849
presence, and a specific

998
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:13,970
measurable return.

999
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:14,339
Right?

1000
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,109
So, they got three offer

1001
00:23:15,109 --> 00:23:15,529
variables.

1002
00:23:15,809 --> 00:23:17,140
They're on the gold plan.

1003
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:19,369
Say their call booking percent is

1004
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:20,230
20%.

1005
00:23:20,509 --> 00:23:21,910
20% of their positive responses

1006
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:22,480
book a call.

1007
00:23:22,869 --> 00:23:24,160
Their close rate on the calls is

1008
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:24,799
20%.

1009
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:25,900
Their average client LTV is

1010
00:23:26,089 --> 00:23:26,940
15,000.

1011
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:27,740
What does this mean?

1012
00:23:27,859 --> 00:23:28,990
He said they're going to have five

1013
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:29,650
meetings a month.

1014
00:23:29,779 --> 00:23:30,630
They're going to close one deal a

1015
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:30,940
month.

1016
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,160
Their customer acquisition cost is

1017
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:33,180
going to be $1,800.

1018
00:23:33,549 --> 00:23:35,930
And they're going to get a 13.9x

1019
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:36,720
return.

1020
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:38,240
Okay.

1021
00:23:38,279 --> 00:23:40,950
So, what if we sent 210,000 emails

1022
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:41,680
instead?

1023
00:23:43,019 --> 00:23:44,680
Like, oh, magically, you're making

1024
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:46,480
fucking $90,000 instead.

1025
00:23:46,519 --> 00:23:47,779
And your customer acquisition cost

1026
00:23:47,789 --> 00:23:49,190
is $1,000 to 15x ROI.

1027
00:23:49,299 --> 00:23:50,960
You're getting 32 meetings and

1028
00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:52,950
closing six deals instead of

1029
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:54,440
fucking one.

1030
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:57,529
Hey, do you want to close one deal

1031
00:23:57,609 --> 00:24:00,130
per month with my cold email

1032
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:01,299
system?

1033
00:24:01,569 --> 00:24:02,380
What the fuck?

1034
00:24:02,619 --> 00:24:03,759
What do you fucking mean?

1035
00:24:03,799 --> 00:24:04,240
One deal.

1036
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:05,960
Who gives a shit about one deal?

1037
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,049
Do you want to fucking close six

1038
00:24:08,049 --> 00:24:11,359
deals and make $90,000 every month

1039
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:12,240
with my cold email system?

1040
00:24:12,759 --> 00:24:13,329
Fuck yeah, I do.

1041
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:14,779
Do you want 158 leads?

1042
00:24:14,839 --> 00:24:15,160
Yeah.

1043
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:18,240
Do you want 30 sales calls?

1044
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:19,039
Fuck yeah, I do.

1045
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,880
Do you get what I'm saying?

1046
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:22,579
Like, oh, let's double it again.

1047
00:24:22,829 --> 00:24:25,289
Like, fucking, let's send 500,000

1048
00:24:25,369 --> 00:24:26,559
cold emails a month.

1049
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:28,799
Do you want to make 195 grand at

1050
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:29,980
32x ROI?

1051
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:32,359
This is the shit I'm talking

1052
00:24:32,539 --> 00:24:32,940
about.

1053
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,519
Like, you need to project these,

1054
00:24:34,519 --> 00:24:36,029
you need to show these people, you

1055
00:24:36,109 --> 00:24:37,990
need to guide them, right?

1056
00:24:38,039 --> 00:24:39,170
And then you ask them, like,

1057
00:24:39,289 --> 00:24:40,230
what's your close rate?

1058
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,960
How much are you making per

1059
00:24:42,029 --> 00:24:42,480
client?

1060
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:43,789
You might have a client and their

1061
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:45,150
LTV is like $25,000.

1062
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,660
Now, now, now this gets completely

1063
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:47,029
absurd.

1064
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:48,029
They're going to get 25x.

1065
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,440
Now, you might have a client who

1066
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:50,730
always says, oh, the LTV is only

1067
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:51,700
$4,000.

1068
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:52,019
What's it?

1069
00:24:52,059 --> 00:24:52,819
Yeah, you're not going to make

1070
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:54,180
much money with a $4,000 LTV.

1071
00:24:54,599 --> 00:24:55,720
That's when you would disqualify a

1072
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:56,079
client.

1073
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,539
You know what I'm saying?

1074
00:24:57,579 --> 00:24:58,329
Well, you need to sell more

1075
00:24:58,329 --> 00:24:59,019
expensive stuff.

1076
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:02,339
And now the client's disqualified.

1077
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:03,319
But you get somebody who has a

1078
00:25:03,319 --> 00:25:04,400
$15,000 LTV.

1079
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:06,220
Yeah, they can make it 15x ROI.

1080
00:25:06,259 --> 00:25:07,539
Now, it's in paying attention

1081
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:08,049
distance.

1082
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:09,299
Now, people give a fuck.

1083
00:25:09,569 --> 00:25:11,539
Because you visually showed this

1084
00:25:11,869 --> 00:25:12,619
to them.

1085
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:14,619
They don't know what the reply

1086
00:25:14,619 --> 00:25:15,329
rate is.

1087
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,599
They don't know what these offer

1088
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:17,210
variables are.

1089
00:25:17,579 --> 00:25:19,180
They don't know what a conversion,

1090
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:21,089
what a good conversion rate is for

1091
00:25:21,089 --> 00:25:21,829
this offer.

1092
00:25:22,019 --> 00:25:23,069
They don't know what a good call

1093
00:25:23,269 --> 00:25:23,809
booking percent.

1094
00:25:24,339 --> 00:25:25,539
But if you don't tell them,

1095
00:25:25,609 --> 00:25:28,009
they're just going to lead to the

1096
00:25:28,009 --> 00:25:29,990
conclusion themselves

1097
00:25:30,039 --> 00:25:31,829
of the most pessimistic possible

1098
00:25:31,839 --> 00:25:32,680
situation.

1099
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,400
You need to lead them to the

1100
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:34,920
light.

1101
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:36,880
You get what I'm saying?

1102
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,130
So, you talk about transferring

1103
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:41,410
logistical intensity.

1104
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,589
Okay, so let's say you're on a

1105
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:43,420
call with a client

1106
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:45,029
and you've walked them through an

1107
00:25:45,029 --> 00:25:46,819
ROI projection of what's possible.

1108
00:25:46,859 --> 00:25:48,039
And now we want to talk about the

1109
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:49,640
deliverables of what's included in

1110
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,339
your offer.

1111
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:51,019
So, why is this important?

1112
00:25:51,289 --> 00:25:51,839
Because if you fail to explain

1113
00:25:52,329 --> 00:25:53,259
everything that's included in

1114
00:25:53,579 --> 00:25:54,279
getting results,

1115
00:25:54,529 --> 00:25:55,779
then people don't believe that

1116
00:25:55,779 --> 00:25:57,000
it's possible, right?

1117
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,059
They got to understand how

1118
00:25:58,369 --> 00:25:58,910
extensive this is.

1119
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,339
So, you want to make what you do

1120
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:02,009
seem as complicated as possible.

1121
00:26:02,099 --> 00:26:04,130
So, if you only show you're going

1122
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:06,119
to do a small amount of things,

1123
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:06,930
people cannot make the

1124
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:08,349
justification that what you're

1125
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,490
doing is actually capable

1126
00:26:09,539 --> 00:26:10,299
of getting the high-quoted results

1127
00:26:10,299 --> 00:26:11,329
you're giving them, right?

1128
00:26:11,609 --> 00:26:12,720
Again, people aren't fucking

1129
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:13,579
retarded, right?

1130
00:26:13,799 --> 00:26:15,009
They're retarded and not retarded

1131
00:26:15,049 --> 00:26:15,799
at the same time.

1132
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,400
So, however, if you show you're

1133
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:18,579
going to do a ton of shit,

1134
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,630
the justification of high-quoted

1135
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:22,829
results begins to make more sense.

1136
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,839
So, let's walk through an actual

1137
00:26:24,839 --> 00:26:25,759
sales deck.

1138
00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:27,440
So, like a sales deck is also just

1139
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,000
a VSL deck.

1140
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:30,309
When I film VSLs, I do it just as

1141
00:26:30,309 --> 00:26:32,059
a screen share over these decks.

1142
00:26:32,099 --> 00:26:33,319
So, I literally just film over it,

1143
00:26:33,369 --> 00:26:33,740
right?

1144
00:26:33,799 --> 00:26:35,559
And when I'm on calls, I use the

1145
00:26:35,559 --> 00:26:36,700
same exact deck.

1146
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:37,460
It's the same thing.

1147
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,059
You see what I mean?

1148
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,049
So, this is one we made for a list

1149
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:41,779
kit.

1150
00:26:42,049 --> 00:26:44,009
The VSL is over the stock.

1151
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:45,630
And if I'm on a call selling this

1152
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:46,119
offer,

1153
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,819
I'm literally just screen sharing

1154
00:26:47,819 --> 00:26:49,150
this fucking thing that was

1155
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:50,019
already on the VSL.

1156
00:26:50,059 --> 00:26:50,319
Why?

1157
00:26:50,589 --> 00:26:51,809
Because all the relevant

1158
00:26:51,809 --> 00:26:53,369
information is on the deck

1159
00:26:53,369 --> 00:26:54,130
already.

1160
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:54,930
You know what I'm saying?

1161
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,180
It's profoundly simple shit.

1162
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,819
So, what am I doing here?

1163
00:26:58,859 --> 00:27:00,859
I'm saying, what you said,

1164
00:27:00,859 --> 00:27:02,299
$100,000 to $250,000 code units

1165
00:27:02,299 --> 00:27:02,630
per month.

1166
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,160
So, it's like an offer and get

1167
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,549
every single one in the main

1168
00:27:05,549 --> 00:27:06,119
inbox.

1169
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,109
It's like a value proposition.

1170
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,559
It's a good headline here.

1171
00:27:08,829 --> 00:27:10,789
And I'll just say, if you're...

1172
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:12,519
So, what I'm immediately doing

1173
00:27:12,599 --> 00:27:14,400
here is saying it includes this.

1174
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,269
It includes a dedicated separate

1175
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:16,599
domain for your organization,

1176
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:17,390
email inboxes, private

1177
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:18,829
infrastructure, the automation

1178
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:19,920
setting platform,

1179
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,980
a CRM, and triple verified data.

1180
00:27:22,039 --> 00:27:24,680
So, I'm saying it includes all of

1181
00:27:24,759 --> 00:27:26,490
this stuff, right?

1182
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:28,869
It's not just like the sending

1183
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:30,819
where you need to get the inboxes

1184
00:27:30,839 --> 00:27:31,420
yourself,

1185
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:32,220
or it's not just the lead.

1186
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:33,119
It includes everything.

1187
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:34,180
You get what I'm saying?

1188
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:35,359
It's not what I go into.

1189
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:36,900
Because I'm going to tell them the

1190
00:27:37,009 --> 00:27:38,180
expected results, and I give them

1191
00:27:38,269 --> 00:27:38,779
case studies.

1192
00:27:38,839 --> 00:27:40,240
Then I'm going to explain how the

1193
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,380
coding system works.

1194
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:42,450
Then I'm going to explain what is

1195
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:43,359
included in the offer.

1196
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,630
And then this specific offer, I

1197
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:45,339
give pricing.

1198
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:45,819
But you don't...

1199
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:46,299
You have to...

1200
00:27:46,339 --> 00:27:47,599
You give price ranges, right?

1201
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:50,700
So, what I'm doing here is I'm

1202
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:53,539
trying to get them to understand

1203
00:27:53,539 --> 00:27:56,359
the gravity of how well this

1204
00:27:56,359 --> 00:27:56,900
works.

1205
00:27:57,190 --> 00:27:58,430
Because what I'm saying is, like,

1206
00:27:58,470 --> 00:27:59,799
if I'm going to be charging them

1207
00:27:59,809 --> 00:28:01,859
$3,000 to $10,000,

1208
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:04,089
then they need to say...

1209
00:28:04,589 --> 00:28:06,059
They need to see that other people

1210
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:07,849
make fucking substantially more

1211
00:28:07,849 --> 00:28:10,599
than $3,000 to $10,000.

1212
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,789
So, this lady, fucking 20 mil,

1213
00:28:12,789 --> 00:28:15,250
$65,000 in one month, 16 deals in

1214
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:16,819
a single month, 10 clients in

1215
00:28:16,819 --> 00:28:18,670
three weeks, 100 clients signed,

1216
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,680
$40,000 in two weeks, 40 sales

1217
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:23,369
calls, $97,500 made, 170 sales

1218
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:26,180
calls, $20,000 in the first 30

1219
00:28:26,259 --> 00:28:26,650
days.

1220
00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:28,420
Okay, so here's...

1221
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,890
And then I show examples of

1222
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:31,099
campaigns we ran.

1223
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:33,940
So, I'm like, 494,000 emails, 685

1224
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:36,329
calls booked, 108,000 MRR.

1225
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:37,559
Now, they're like, holy shit.

1226
00:28:37,829 --> 00:28:38,970
These are fucking substantial

1227
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:39,539
results.

1228
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:40,349
Then I start showing individual

1229
00:28:40,849 --> 00:28:41,339
campaigns.

1230
00:28:41,609 --> 00:28:44,279
This one campaign, 88 leads, 58,

1231
00:28:44,279 --> 00:28:45,849
63, 333.

1232
00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:46,700
Then I start...

1233
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:47,900
Then I have this little section

1234
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:48,480
that goes,

1235
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:49,900
So, the average client under a

1236
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,470
custom enterprise plan receives

1237
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:53,450
this meeting book rate, books 33

1238
00:28:53,509 --> 00:28:56,059
calls, closes 22.8% as the LTV,

1239
00:28:56,059 --> 00:28:58,859
15,431, closes eight new deals a

1240
00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:00,880
month, and receives a 20.6X ROI

1241
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,069
based on what they pay us.

1242
00:29:02,259 --> 00:29:03,670
And I say, that's the average

1243
00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:05,200
custom enterprise client.

1244
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:07,440
And I show them the results.

1245
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:09,470
And now, all these fucking numbers

1246
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,089
have just been firehose spewed

1247
00:29:11,089 --> 00:29:12,619
into their fucking head.

1248
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,319
And they're like, holy shit.

1249
00:29:14,589 --> 00:29:15,710
These people make a fuck ton of

1250
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:16,150
money.

1251
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,380
So, what did I just do here?

1252
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:18,779
What's going through their head as

1253
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:19,700
they're thinking this?

1254
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:21,940
They're like, yo, I think I just

1255
00:29:22,269 --> 00:29:24,779
found something fucking crazy.

1256
00:29:24,819 --> 00:29:26,359
Now, they're like, holy shit.

1257
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,150
It's appealing to their greed.

1258
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:29,680
They're greedy now.

1259
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,920
They're like, fuck, I need that.

1260
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:31,730
I need to do that right now.

1261
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,200
I need this before other people

1262
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,109
find out about this.

1263
00:29:34,259 --> 00:29:34,980
That's what they're saying.

1264
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:38,319
That's what extreme results do.

1265
00:29:38,589 --> 00:29:40,039
They get greedy as fuck.

1266
00:29:40,299 --> 00:29:41,680
They're like, I need that.

1267
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:42,160
Right?

1268
00:29:42,279 --> 00:29:44,049
So, now, I just explain

1269
00:29:44,099 --> 00:29:46,630
graphically, visually how this

1270
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:47,900
system works.

1271
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,630
And then, I go through an argument

1272
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:51,160
of why it needs to be set up like

1273
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:51,680
this.

1274
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,799
And I'm basically saying, if you

1275
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:53,880
don't set up like this, the shit

1276
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:54,380
gets burned.

1277
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,440
You waste a ton of money.

1278
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,420
None of your shit gets to the

1279
00:29:56,690 --> 00:29:56,859
inbox.

1280
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:57,920
So, you end up losing thousands of

1281
00:29:58,150 --> 00:29:58,339
dollars.

1282
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,299
And what's going to happen?

1283
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:00,099
If you do it with someone else,

1284
00:30:00,259 --> 00:30:01,019
they're going to fuck it up.

1285
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:01,940
Because they don't know this is

1286
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:02,930
actually how you're supposed to do

1287
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:03,240
that.

1288
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:04,720
And I know this is the case

1289
00:30:04,769 --> 00:30:06,519
because here's our bounce rate.

1290
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:07,890
And the average bounce rate is

1291
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:08,539
like 4%.

1292
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:10,369
And I'm just making an argument

1293
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,109
here is why it needs to be like

1294
00:30:12,109 --> 00:30:12,700
this.

1295
00:30:12,759 --> 00:30:14,049
And why, if they don't do it

1296
00:30:14,049 --> 00:30:15,400
through us, it's going to be

1297
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,180
fucked up.

1298
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:16,500
Right?

1299
00:30:16,539 --> 00:30:17,900
So, now, here's what I'm doing.

1300
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:18,710
What you get with this and how the

1301
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:19,319
handoff works.

1302
00:30:19,589 --> 00:30:21,039
This is where I'm stacking the

1303
00:30:21,109 --> 00:30:22,690
logistical intensity.

1304
00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:24,880
Where I'm showing really just how

1305
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,740
much shit is involved in this

1306
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:27,220
offer.

1307
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:28,289
It's like super fucking

1308
00:30:28,789 --> 00:30:29,660
complicated.

1309
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:29,990
Right?

1310
00:30:30,039 --> 00:30:31,440
So, we set the domains up.

1311
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,740
We create the sending inboxes.

1312
00:30:32,779 --> 00:30:34,789
We integrate those onto dedicated

1313
00:30:34,789 --> 00:30:35,240
IPs.

1314
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:36,609
We set up SPF, DKM, and DMARC on

1315
00:30:36,609 --> 00:30:37,490
each of the domains.

1316
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:38,359
We're going to connect those

1317
00:30:38,359 --> 00:30:39,180
sending accounts to the automated

1318
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:39,700
sending tool.

1319
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:40,490
We're going to warm it up for you.

1320
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:41,309
We're going to give you the leads

1321
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:41,980
for your campaign.

1322
00:30:42,019 --> 00:30:42,779
We're going to write your cold

1323
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:43,440
email scripts.

1324
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,619
We're going to load everything up.

1325
00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:46,480
Once you be ready, all you need to

1326
00:30:46,579 --> 00:30:48,220
do is hit the start button.

1327
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:49,069
We're going to sign you a personal

1328
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:49,799
cold email expert into your

1329
00:30:49,819 --> 00:30:50,109
account.

1330
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,299
And you're going to have a central

1331
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:52,369
inbox where all the replies and

1332
00:30:52,369 --> 00:30:52,960
leads land.

1333
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:55,200
That's a ton of fucking shit that

1334
00:30:55,519 --> 00:30:56,740
we do over here.

1335
00:30:57,009 --> 00:30:57,220
Right?

1336
00:30:57,319 --> 00:30:58,819
And then, I just show them the

1337
00:30:58,819 --> 00:31:00,450
timeline of how this is going to

1338
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:01,019
work.

1339
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:02,440
Then, I go to the pricing.

1340
00:31:02,549 --> 00:31:03,289
I just give them a range.

1341
00:31:03,339 --> 00:31:04,700
It's going to be between $2,400

1342
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:05,960
and $10,000 a month.

1343
00:31:06,019 --> 00:31:07,559
And then, over here, what I'm

1344
00:31:07,559 --> 00:31:08,980
doing is this is like a price

1345
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:10,470
comparison comparing if they

1346
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,400
did it themselves versus if they

1347
00:31:11,579 --> 00:31:12,079
did it through us.

1348
00:31:12,119 --> 00:31:12,880
And I show them that it's cheaper

1349
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:13,799
doing it through us.

1350
00:31:13,859 --> 00:31:14,880
Now, this isn't always going to be

1351
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:15,890
the case where it's like, you

1352
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:17,079
know, if you're like

1353
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:18,250
an agency service, it might not be

1354
00:31:18,289 --> 00:31:19,309
a price comparison because like

1355
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:20,079
the alternative,

1356
00:31:20,119 --> 00:31:20,880
it might not be doing it

1357
00:31:21,369 --> 00:31:21,559
themselves.

1358
00:31:21,599 --> 00:31:22,369
You're going to say, so I'm going

1359
00:31:22,369 --> 00:31:23,539
to show you another example.

1360
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:26,349
I go through, if they're on this

1361
00:31:26,349 --> 00:31:27,839
plan, this is the price comparison

1362
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,109
if they did it themselves.

1363
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,750
And then, common objection we get

1364
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:32,339
is that they said, well, another

1365
00:31:32,359 --> 00:31:33,519
company said they can do

1366
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:33,900
it cheaper.

1367
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:34,519
How do you compare?

1368
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:35,500
Then I say, okay, well, have you

1369
00:31:35,509 --> 00:31:36,579
made sure it includes all this?

1370
00:31:36,619 --> 00:31:37,240
It doesn't.

1371
00:31:37,339 --> 00:31:38,269
Then I break down the exact time

1372
00:31:38,589 --> 00:31:39,390
investment, how long it would take

1373
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:40,380
if they did it themselves,

1374
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:41,000
right?

1375
00:31:41,269 --> 00:31:42,720
Because that is their alternative

1376
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,160
here.

1377
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:44,720
And I answer some questions.

1378
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:50,700
Okay, so this one's for Olympia.

1379
00:31:50,759 --> 00:31:51,500
And this is following the same

1380
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:51,900
presence.

1381
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:53,880
It's still a deck.

1382
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:54,640
So it's like, okay, got a

1383
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,099
headline.

1384
00:31:55,369 --> 00:31:56,920
What I'm doing here is, so this

1385
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:57,940
wasn't a case.

1386
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:58,839
This wasn't operating off of

1387
00:31:58,849 --> 00:31:59,769
client case studies here.

1388
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,119
This was operating off of personal

1389
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:01,619
results.

1390
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:02,630
So I'm just showing proof of the

1391
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:03,700
personal results over here.

1392
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:05,299
I'm building some credibility for

1393
00:32:05,299 --> 00:32:05,839
myself.

1394
00:32:07,569 --> 00:32:09,359
This works for these people,

1395
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:10,799
outline, right?

1396
00:32:10,839 --> 00:32:11,589
Show some more results.

1397
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,759
I'm basically explaining, going

1398
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:15,769
through my argument of this is how

1399
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:17,900
it works and this is why it works.

1400
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:18,619
You know what I'm saying?

1401
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:20,140
So then I walk through like the

1402
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,640
offer economics and how to do

1403
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,160
that.

1404
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:22,950
I just made this like little

1405
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:23,720
Google sheet for them to go

1406
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:23,990
through.

1407
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:25,569
Then I just explained how the

1408
00:32:25,569 --> 00:32:27,210
process works and the components

1409
00:32:27,289 --> 00:32:28,630
of each process, right?

1410
00:32:28,779 --> 00:32:29,750
And both of these decks are going

1411
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:30,750
to be in the description, by the

1412
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:30,980
way.

1413
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:31,859
So you'll be able to see it.

1414
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:34,630
So I'm walking through each stuff

1415
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,359
here.

1416
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:36,579
And then what I'm doing is I'm

1417
00:32:36,789 --> 00:32:37,579
walking them through the

1418
00:32:37,579 --> 00:32:39,079
deliverables of what's included in

1419
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:39,549
Olympia.

1420
00:32:39,619 --> 00:32:41,299
So it's offer creation, funnel

1421
00:32:41,369 --> 00:32:43,509
setup, ad scripts, VSL, GammaDoc,

1422
00:32:43,509 --> 00:32:45,269
video editing, initial ad campaign

1423
00:32:45,369 --> 00:32:45,740
launch,

1424
00:32:45,779 --> 00:32:47,240
emo sequences and tech sequences,

1425
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,410
automations to build out, SDR, and

1426
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:50,140
set of recruitment,

1427
00:32:50,369 --> 00:32:51,369
closed recruitment, fulfillment,

1428
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:52,329
team recruitment, campaign

1429
00:32:52,329 --> 00:32:53,539
scaling, daily ads management,

1430
00:32:53,579 --> 00:32:54,460
and then I give them the price,

1431
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:54,799
right?

1432
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:56,299
And I say, what else is included?

1433
00:32:56,359 --> 00:32:58,109
One-on-one calls, I write your ad

1434
00:32:58,109 --> 00:32:59,500
scripts, weekly coaching calls,

1435
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:00,759
four in-person events per year,

1436
00:33:01,119 --> 00:33:02,269
done for you, Fahoma team

1437
00:33:02,269 --> 00:33:04,369
recruiting, course videos, weekly

1438
00:33:04,369 --> 00:33:05,900
walkthrough of my ad accounts,

1439
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:07,059
one-on-one review of all your

1440
00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:08,559
materials, unlimited texting with

1441
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:10,200
me and all my co-founders, right?

1442
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,190
So what I just do, I'm stacking

1443
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:14,460
the logistical intensity.

1444
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:15,440
I'm saying, I'm going to do this

1445
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,609
for you, this, this, this, this,

1446
00:33:16,609 --> 00:33:17,000
this, this.

1447
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:19,619
I'm explaining what is involved to

1448
00:33:19,619 --> 00:33:22,200
get a specific result, right?

1449
00:33:22,279 --> 00:33:24,069
So I'm showing what is involved,

1450
00:33:24,109 --> 00:33:25,839
getting a specific result, and

1451
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:26,990
then I'm saying, I'm going to do

1452
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,599
fucking all of it for you.

1453
00:33:28,869 --> 00:33:30,430
Done for you, done with you,

1454
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:31,420
whatever.

1455
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:34,680
So it's just showing, it's just

1456
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:37,859
stacking all of the shit that is

1457
00:33:37,859 --> 00:33:40,670
required, and that's how you build

1458
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:41,250
value.

1459
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:43,329
Because you show, because now they

1460
00:33:43,329 --> 00:33:44,910
understand what actually is

1461
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:46,589
involved in getting results,

1462
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:47,240
right?

1463
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:48,490
So if you just, if you didn't know

1464
00:33:48,549 --> 00:33:49,480
what the fuck you were talking

1465
00:33:49,809 --> 00:33:50,759
about, you wouldn't be able to

1466
00:33:50,789 --> 00:33:52,470
articulate and explain what

1467
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:53,900
exactly is involved with all the

1468
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:54,480
results.

1469
00:33:54,519 --> 00:33:56,000
But when you do, and then you also

1470
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,460
say, and I do all this for you,

1471
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:59,940
now, your logical mind, after

1472
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:01,380
you've quoted fucking insane

1473
00:34:01,759 --> 00:34:02,579
results like this,

1474
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,410
and like extremely high numbers,

1475
00:34:04,539 --> 00:34:06,329
you're like, okay, I understand

1476
00:34:06,329 --> 00:34:08,039
now how the quoted results could

1477
00:34:08,059 --> 00:34:08,820
be this high,

1478
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:10,289
because there's so much shit that

1479
00:34:10,289 --> 00:34:11,909
goes into this, and you're going

1480
00:34:11,989 --> 00:34:13,199
to do all of it for me,

1481
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:14,719
so I don't have to do any of it,

1482
00:34:14,739 --> 00:34:16,539
fucking yeah, now I understand,

1483
00:34:16,539 --> 00:34:17,139
right?

1484
00:34:17,179 --> 00:34:18,130
So what if you don't have case

1485
00:34:18,429 --> 00:34:19,300
studies to put inside a deck?

1486
00:34:19,539 --> 00:34:20,980
Okay, so first off, don't steal

1487
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:22,519
case studies, but find results

1488
00:34:22,539 --> 00:34:23,809
from other companies that do the

1489
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:24,920
exact same thing you do,

1490
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,019
and explain that you're going to

1491
00:34:26,179 --> 00:34:27,159
copy the strategy for the client.

1492
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:29,030
So obviously don't use misleading

1493
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:30,750
language that would lead somebody

1494
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:32,289
to believe you generated those

1495
00:34:32,349 --> 00:34:32,960
results.

1496
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,380
The best policy is always honesty,

1497
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:34,789
right?

1498
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,320
So the premise you need to

1499
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,199
understand is that you at least

1500
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:40,199
need evidence that the concept of

1501
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:42,139
what you're selling works.

1502
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,590
If you're selling content, then

1503
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:44,630
you need to find somebody whose

1504
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,079
content strategy you're copying,

1505
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:47,349
show the client the results this

1506
00:34:47,409 --> 00:34:48,579
strategy generated, and then

1507
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:49,780
explain that you're going to do,

1508
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,269
you're going to be doing exactly

1509
00:34:51,269 --> 00:34:53,079
the same strategy for them, right?

1510
00:34:53,139 --> 00:34:54,619
If you're selling a specific type

1511
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:56,190
of funnel build out, then you need

1512
00:34:56,269 --> 00:34:57,579
to go find examples of funnels

1513
00:34:57,579 --> 00:34:58,699
that scale to a certain level,

1514
00:34:58,969 --> 00:35:00,219
explain that you funnel hacked the

1515
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:01,530
entire thing, and that you're

1516
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:02,769
going to replicate it for them,

1517
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,000
and show numbers, right?

1518
00:35:04,059 --> 00:35:05,559
You need to sell the concept of

1519
00:35:05,559 --> 00:35:07,090
what you're doing to them.

1520
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,579
You need to show big, dense, fat

1521
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:11,460
numbers, even if they're not

1522
00:35:11,530 --> 00:35:12,820
generated by you.

1523
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:14,650
You need to get people excited

1524
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:17,079
about the opportunity, right?

1525
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:18,760
So there's two sales that are

1526
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:19,659
occurring.

1527
00:35:19,699 --> 00:35:21,900
It's the sale of the opportunity.

1528
00:35:22,099 --> 00:35:23,599
So like if you're selling cold

1529
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:24,760
email, you have to sell the

1530
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:25,860
concept of cold email, for

1531
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:27,099
instance, right?

1532
00:35:27,159 --> 00:35:28,780
And then there's the sale of you

1533
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:30,880
being the person to facilitate it.

1534
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,030
So you have to sell the

1535
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:33,460
opportunity, and you have to sell

1536
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:33,880
you.

1537
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:35,699
But if your argument on the first

1538
00:35:35,699 --> 00:35:37,920
point is sufficiently good enough,

1539
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,760
it makes people forget about point

1540
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,159
two.

1541
00:35:40,199 --> 00:35:41,530
But only if your argument and

1542
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:43,000
evidence on point one is strong

1543
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,670
enough to appeal to their greed.

1544
00:35:44,949 --> 00:35:46,949
You need to appeal to their greed.

1545
00:35:47,059 --> 00:35:48,809
If you're showing them people who

1546
00:35:48,809 --> 00:35:50,760
are making fucking astronomically

1547
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,880
high, disgusting amounts of money,

1548
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:55,719
it's appealing to their greed.

1549
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:57,000
And now they're excited, and

1550
00:35:57,050 --> 00:35:58,570
they're like, fucking, yeah, just

1551
00:35:58,619 --> 00:35:59,179
do it for me.

1552
00:35:59,829 --> 00:36:01,659
Nobody is excited to hear that you

1553
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:03,599
can book them 10 calls.

1554
00:36:03,869 --> 00:36:05,409
They're excited to see that this

1555
00:36:05,409 --> 00:36:07,670
guy over here made $1.7 million in

1556
00:36:07,719 --> 00:36:08,570
three months,

1557
00:36:08,659 --> 00:36:10,010
$1.7 million profit in three

1558
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:11,280
months of this type of funnel,

1559
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,340
and that you're going to copy the

1560
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:13,460
entire thing for the client and

1561
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:14,840
run up the same exact strategy

1562
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:16,019
because you got a back-end look

1563
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:17,340
into the operations or some shit,

1564
00:36:17,409 --> 00:36:17,800
right?

1565
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:19,519
Which really means that you just

1566
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:21,400
funnel hacked them, or you bought

1567
00:36:21,469 --> 00:36:22,639
consulting from them,

1568
00:36:22,679 --> 00:36:23,449
or did whatever the fuck.

1569
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:24,739
You know what I'm saying?

1570
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:26,570
So if I were to make an agency

1571
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:27,440
right now,

1572
00:36:27,559 --> 00:36:28,969
it would be an advertising agency

1573
00:36:28,969 --> 00:36:29,750
where I charge,

1574
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:30,559
if I were to make a new agency

1575
00:36:30,559 --> 00:36:31,139
right now,

1576
00:36:31,179 --> 00:36:31,949
it would be an advertising agency

1577
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:33,380
where I charge $10,000 per month

1578
00:36:33,679 --> 00:36:34,559
plus 10% net rev share.

1579
00:36:34,829 --> 00:36:35,199
Why?

1580
00:36:35,469 --> 00:36:36,750
Because I've made a fucking shit

1581
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:38,289
ton of money in advertising and

1582
00:36:38,369 --> 00:36:39,389
can actively show I booked

1583
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:39,679
thousands

1584
00:36:39,719 --> 00:36:41,719
of calls, had over 930 clients

1585
00:36:41,719 --> 00:36:43,400
sign up through a funnel I made

1586
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,210
with ads I wrote in emails I

1587
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:45,820
created,

1588
00:36:46,090 --> 00:36:46,590
right?

1589
00:36:46,679 --> 00:36:47,829
And if I didn't have that, I'd

1590
00:36:47,949 --> 00:36:49,730
find somebody else who did and

1591
00:36:49,730 --> 00:36:52,159
explain what they did in extremely

1592
00:36:52,239 --> 00:36:53,510
explanative detail

1593
00:36:53,809 --> 00:36:55,730
going through every single aspect

1594
00:36:55,730 --> 00:36:58,050
of exactly what they did and then

1595
00:36:58,460 --> 00:36:59,739
explain that we're going to

1596
00:36:59,739 --> 00:37:01,940
exactly copy this funnel, right?

1597
00:37:02,059 --> 00:37:03,610
I'm not going to use this person

1598
00:37:03,610 --> 00:37:04,860
as a case study of me.

1599
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:06,690
I'm going to use them as a case

1600
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:08,769
study of the concept of the thing

1601
00:37:08,769 --> 00:37:09,840
I'm selling.

1602
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,599
Do you know what I'm saying?

1603
00:37:11,889 --> 00:37:15,059
So I'm going to do, and I just

1604
00:37:15,059 --> 00:37:16,460
explained it, that I'm going to do

1605
00:37:16,539 --> 00:37:17,300
every single component of this

1606
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:17,539
offer

1607
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:19,050
and replicate it one by one,

1608
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:20,900
exactly what this person did.

1609
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:22,329
And I'd write out every single

1610
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:23,989
deliverable that would be involved

1611
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:25,719
with this exactly like it's listed

1612
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,039
in the cold email setup talk or

1613
00:37:27,039 --> 00:37:28,340
the Olympia doc, right?

1614
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:29,329
So something like this, let's take

1615
00:37:29,389 --> 00:37:30,059
this for instance.

1616
00:37:30,309 --> 00:37:31,699
Okay, deliverables, complete

1617
00:37:31,699 --> 00:37:33,289
technical build out of the funnel

1618
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,909
in all pages, opt-in page, VSL

1619
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:35,280

capture the emails, phone numbers,

1622
00:37:37,309 --> 00:37:38,440
applications, and calls booked,

1623
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,610

post-booking flow, ad scripts, 40

1627
00:37:43,869 --> 00:37:45,679
hooks, five bodies, 200 total ads,

1628
00:37:45,739 --> 00:37:46,360
VSL script,

1629
00:37:46,699 --> 00:37:47,760
ad and VSL video editing,

1630
00:37:47,949 --> 00:37:49,309
follow-up sales assets, ad account

1631
00:37:49,309 --> 00:37:50,099
and pixel setup,

1632
00:37:50,159 --> 00:37:51,690
full product launch strategy, all

1633
00:37:51,690 --> 00:37:53,380
social posts, Instagram stories,

1634
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:54,239
three YouTube videos,

1635
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:55,860
15 tweets, all broadcast emails.

1636
00:37:56,130 --> 00:37:58,099
Okay, so now that I've just listed

1637
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:01,349
all this shit out, how much do you

1638
00:38:01,349 --> 00:38:04,090
think that is worth?

1639
00:38:04,369 --> 00:38:07,360
Just take a second and just think

1640
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:10,539
of a number of how much do you

1641
00:38:10,539 --> 00:38:13,349
think all of this fucking shit is

1642
00:38:13,699 --> 00:38:13,820
worth?

1643
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:18,579
What do you think the going rate

1644
00:38:18,579 --> 00:38:21,590
for a build-out of this is, of all

1645
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:23,139
of this shit?

1646
00:38:23,409 --> 00:38:26,949
Okay, now let's look at another,

1647
00:38:26,949 --> 00:38:27,670
right?

1648
00:38:28,099 --> 00:38:29,889
I'll fully build your funnel for

1649
00:38:30,019 --> 00:38:32,000
you to launch a high-ticket offer

1650
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:32,780
and guarantee you make at least

1651
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:33,449
$50,000.

1652
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:35,179
I'll build the entire funnel and

1653
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:36,659
help you launch it A to Z.

1654
00:38:38,159 --> 00:38:39,650
Like, okay, so, so, so, and then

1655
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:40,900
someone goes to this guy, they're

1656
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:41,699
like, okay, well, what are the

1657
00:38:41,769 --> 00:38:42,610
deliverables involved?

1658
00:38:42,699 --> 00:38:43,460
It was, oh, well, I'll just build

1659
00:38:43,579 --> 00:38:44,000
the funnel.

1660
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:45,679
Like, I'll make the pages and,

1661
00:38:45,679 --> 00:38:47,530
like, uh, and I'll do, I'll write

1662
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:49,099
some emails and some ads.

1663
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:51,670
And now they're like, and now

1664
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:53,130
what, what is the client thinking

1665
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:54,800
when you're not extremely fucking

1666
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,639
explicit with what is involved?

1667
00:38:56,699 --> 00:38:58,119
They're thinking, well, well, what

1668
00:38:58,119 --> 00:38:59,480
if there's, like, the automation

1669
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,960
stuff and, like, uh, well, I mean,

1670
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,230
there's going to be filming and,

1671
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:03,489
like, who's going to do the video

1672
00:39:03,489 --> 00:39:04,090
editing?

1673
00:39:04,139 --> 00:39:05,309
And, like, okay, well, I don't

1674
00:39:05,409 --> 00:39:06,340
know how to run ads myself or,

1675
00:39:06,539 --> 00:39:07,500
like, set up a pixel or, like,

1676
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:08,920
like, well, what, what, like, what

1677
00:39:08,929 --> 00:39:10,340
if the calls aren't closing?

1678
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:11,059
What's going to happen then?

1679
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:12,489
Like, if they're, like, like, are

1680
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:13,690
there things needed to close the

1681
00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:14,119
calls?

1682
00:39:14,179 --> 00:39:15,929
All this shit, they're thinking

1683
00:39:15,929 --> 00:39:17,679
it's all missing because you're

1684
00:39:17,679 --> 00:39:19,420
not being explanative in detail

1685
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:21,440
about what the fuck is included.

1686
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:23,440
So, how much do you, which of

1687
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,599
these offers do you think is more

1688
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:26,539
valuable?

1689
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:27,980
This one with all this shit or

1690
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:29,710
this one where you just say, where

1691
00:39:29,719 --> 00:39:31,050
you just say, I'll build the

1692
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:32,519
entire funnel for you.

1693
00:39:34,050 --> 00:39:37,059
This is, like, a, this, this is,

1694
00:39:37,090 --> 00:39:41,869
like, a fucking $25,000 build-out.

1695
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:43,369
Like, look at this, this is, you

1696
00:39:43,369 --> 00:39:44,869
could, you could sell this shit,

1697
00:39:44,869 --> 00:39:46,389
like, I could personally sell this

1698
00:39:46,579 --> 00:39:47,820
for probably 50 grand.

1699
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:49,630
Maybe you with, like, way less

1700
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:51,710
client results or just, like, just

1701
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:53,510
straight off fucking cold with no

1702
00:39:53,610 --> 00:39:54,659
credibility.

1703
00:39:54,699 --> 00:39:55,650
You'd probably be able to sell it

1704
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:56,480
for, like, 10.

1705
00:39:56,750 --> 00:40:00,989
But this, no the fuck you're not.

1706
00:40:01,179 --> 00:40:02,559
Like, you get what I'm saying?

1707
00:40:02,949 --> 00:40:04,789
You need to, you need to show and

1708
00:40:04,789 --> 00:40:06,710
explain all of the logistical

1709
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:08,699
intensity that is involved.

1710
00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:10,809
That is what, that's the

1711
00:40:10,809 --> 00:40:13,289
justification of your price.

1712
00:40:13,559 --> 00:40:15,119
It's a justification of the highly

1713
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:16,710
quoted results that you're giving

1714
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:17,980
these people, right?

1715
00:40:18,039 --> 00:40:20,769
So, what's the difference between

1716
00:40:20,769 --> 00:40:21,789
these two?

1717
00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:22,670
Nothing.

1718
00:40:23,019 --> 00:40:24,119
They're the exact same thing.

1719
00:40:24,159 --> 00:40:24,929
But the first one fully explains

1720
00:40:25,329 --> 00:40:26,150
the transfer of logistical

1721
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:26,719
intensity.

1722
00:40:27,059 --> 00:40:28,010
It was clear what exactly they

1723
00:40:28,269 --> 00:40:28,739
were getting.

1724
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,380
It conveys how extensive this is

1725
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:31,420
to be successful.

1726
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:32,840
They hear numbers like $50,000,

1727
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:34,880
$100,000, or $250,000 as a quoted

1728
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:35,340
result.

1729
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,380
And this now makes sense to them.

1730
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:38,389
Because now they know, like,

1731
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,570
you're not just bullshitting about

1732
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:41,409
a $50,000, or $100,000, or

1733
00:40:41,409 --> 00:40:42,739
$250,000 number.

1734
00:40:42,989 --> 00:40:44,719
You're showing them how much

1735
00:40:44,719 --> 00:40:47,019
fucking shit is involved in doing

1736
00:40:47,019 --> 00:40:47,579
this.

1737
00:40:47,699 --> 00:40:49,239
It's like a lot of fucking shit to

1738
00:40:49,239 --> 00:40:49,489
do.

1739
00:40:49,639 --> 00:40:51,079
Now they're like, oh, now I

1740
00:40:51,079 --> 00:40:52,909
understand why it would, like, a

1741
00:40:52,909 --> 00:40:57,230
$50,000, or $100,000, or $250,000

1742
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:58,840
result would be conceivably

1743
00:40:59,179 --> 00:40:59,630
possible.

1744
00:40:59,949 --> 00:41:01,489
Because there's hell of fucking

1745
00:41:01,489 --> 00:41:03,699
shit that's involved in it, right?

1746
00:41:03,739 --> 00:41:05,929
So, previously, they had no idea

1747
00:41:05,929 --> 00:41:07,440
what was involved.

1748
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:09,469
They didn't know what the fuck was

1749
00:41:09,469 --> 00:41:11,250
involved in this, right?

1750
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,469
They thought you were just a

1751
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:13,960
bullshitter and just, like, just

1752
00:41:14,039 --> 00:41:15,329
spewing random numbers on the

1753
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:16,949
table like a dickhead, right?

1754
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:18,920
So, now when they go and they get

1755
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,550
off the call, they have to think

1756
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:21,280
about it.

1757
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:22,579
That's what they're thinking

1758
00:41:22,590 --> 00:41:23,000
about.

1759
00:41:23,079 --> 00:41:24,269
They're thinking about, is this

1760
00:41:24,329 --> 00:41:25,269
guy a fucking bullshitter?

1761
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:27,269
Like, well, what exactly is

1762
00:41:27,309 --> 00:41:28,150
included?

1763
00:41:28,469 --> 00:41:30,309
Like, I'm not sure what's involved

1764
00:41:30,309 --> 00:41:31,800
in this because you didn't

1765
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:33,860
explicitly fucking explain this

1766
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:34,909
shit to them.

1767
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:35,719
You know what I'm saying?

1768
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:37,449
So, nobody who's a bullshitter

1769
00:41:37,449 --> 00:41:39,260
would understand that there's this

1770
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:40,360
much that goes into it.

1771
00:41:40,679 --> 00:41:41,570
So, prospects aren't stupid,

1772
00:41:41,570 --> 00:41:41,940
right?

1773
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:43,059
If you don't know what you're

1774
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:44,329
talking about, they're going to

1775
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:45,019
sense it.

1776
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,659
And even if you do know what

1777
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:48,530
you're talking about, but you fail

1778
00:41:48,610 --> 00:41:50,760
to fully explain every single

1779
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:51,860
thing to them

1780
00:41:52,130 --> 00:41:54,380
and complete and minute, fine,

1781
00:41:54,429 --> 00:41:57,019
expletive fucking detail, then

1782
00:41:57,019 --> 00:42:00,059
you've made the same mistake.

1783
00:42:00,099 --> 00:42:01,780
If you don't do that, they're

1784
00:42:01,849 --> 00:42:03,150
going to think you're a

1785
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:04,239
bullshitter.

1786
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:06,300
So, you're effectively the same as

1787
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:08,099
the person who knows nothing and

1788
00:42:08,099 --> 00:42:09,820
actually is bullshitting.

1789
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:12,579
So, take whatever you're selling

1790
00:42:12,579 --> 00:42:14,500
and fully explain every single

1791
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:16,320
thing that is involved in fine

1792
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,760
detail inside of a sales deck.

1793
00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:20,590
Show what is involved in it,

1794
00:42:20,639 --> 00:42:21,570
right?

1795
00:42:21,909 --> 00:42:23,469
Make them understand how wildly

1796
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:25,440
extensive the shit you do is.

1797
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:26,869
That is what gets people to pay

1798
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:29,619
$10,000 instead of $2,000.

1799
00:42:29,679 --> 00:42:30,829
This is the difference between a

1800
00:42:30,869 --> 00:42:32,309
$2,000 per month service and a

1801
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:33,920
$7,000 per month service.

1802
00:42:34,099 --> 00:42:35,699
It has more shit.

1803
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,780
It's that you're failing to

1804
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:39,860
explain all of the shit that

1805
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:41,860
actually is required.

1806
00:42:42,110 --> 00:42:43,570
That's why they're not willing to

1807
00:42:43,570 --> 00:42:45,300
pay more money because they think

1808
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:47,360
you're not fucking doing anything.

1809
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:48,130
You know what I'm saying?

1810
00:42:48,179 --> 00:42:49,630
A $2,000 a month offer doesn't

1811
00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:50,320
include much.

1812
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,460
A $7,000 a month offer is deep.

1813
00:42:52,690 --> 00:42:53,860
It's dense.

1814
00:42:54,159 --> 00:42:55,460
It's well thought out and fully

1815
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:56,650
explains how intricate of a

1816
00:42:56,690 --> 00:42:58,119
process getting results for them

1817
00:42:58,119 --> 00:42:58,639
is, right?

1818
00:42:59,090 --> 00:43:00,380
Only when you pitch an offer like

1819
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,030
this does a prospect fully respect

1820
00:43:02,039 --> 00:43:03,309
what it is you're doing and

1821
00:43:03,309 --> 00:43:04,550
understand the true value of it.

1822
00:43:04,679 --> 00:43:06,139
If you do not communicate this

1823
00:43:06,139 --> 00:43:08,099
properly, they simply never know.

1824
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:09,440
That's when you get shit like,

1825
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:10,510
I'll think about it, or this is

1826
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:11,190
too expensive.

1827
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:12,900
How could it be too expensive?

1828
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,730
Why would somebody say, this is

1829
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:15,900
too expensive?

1830
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:17,269
It's because they don't fucking

1831
00:43:17,269 --> 00:43:18,480
believe that the shit you're

1832
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:19,900
selling them is going to make them

1833
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:21,280
astronomically more amounts of

1834
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:21,840
money.

1835
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:22,590
And how do we get people to

1836
00:43:22,590 --> 00:43:23,519
believe that it's going to make

1837
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:24,550
them astronomically more amounts

1838
00:43:24,630 --> 00:43:25,010
of money?

1839
00:43:25,059 --> 00:43:26,440
You quote higher results.

1840
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:28,159
You use an ROI calculator.

1841
00:43:28,239 --> 00:43:29,739
You show case studies if you have

1842
00:43:29,739 --> 00:43:31,289
them with fucking quantifiable

1843
00:43:31,289 --> 00:43:31,920
results.

1844
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:32,900
And if you can't get that

1845
00:43:33,230 --> 00:43:34,630
yourself, then you go find a case

1846
00:43:34,710 --> 00:43:36,170
study to sell the opportunity of

1847
00:43:36,170 --> 00:43:37,769
the thing and show average results

1848
00:43:37,769 --> 00:43:38,760
in the opportunity.

1849
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:39,960
And then you show all the

1850
00:43:40,070 --> 00:43:41,460
logistical intensity that's

1851
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:43,260
involved with getting results.

1852
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:45,960
So much logistical intensity to be

1853
00:43:46,039 --> 00:43:48,460
enough to justify a high quoted

1854
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:49,360
result.

1855
00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:50,719
Because if you're not showing that

1856
00:43:50,719 --> 00:43:52,059
you're doing enough shit, they're

1857
00:43:52,139 --> 00:43:53,420
going to think this isn't enough

1858
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:54,590
to get a result like this.

1859
00:43:54,699 --> 00:43:56,329
But when that shit is extensive

1860
00:43:56,329 --> 00:43:58,190
and dense and long as fuck, you're

1861
00:43:58,190 --> 00:43:59,039
like, wow.

1862
00:43:59,099 --> 00:44:01,119
And they really sit there and they

1863
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:02,980
think that is a lot of shit that

1864
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:04,730
you are about to do for me.

1865
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:06,809
Magically, it's not expensive

1866
00:44:06,809 --> 00:44:08,969
anymore because they believe that

1867
00:44:08,969 --> 00:44:10,599
if you do that much shit,

1868
00:44:10,639 --> 00:44:12,280
it really fucking might actually

1869
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:13,599
be believable that I make a

1870
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:15,170
quarter million dollars doing this

1871
00:44:15,429 --> 00:44:16,719
shit with you, right?

1872
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:18,409
So when they see everything they

1873
00:44:18,409 --> 00:44:20,269
get, it's magically not expensive

1874
00:44:20,269 --> 00:44:20,900
anymore.

1875
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,969
It's not expensive anymore because

1876
00:44:22,969 --> 00:44:24,769
the logic of why it's expensive is

1877
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:25,500
justified.

1878
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:27,869
It makes a clear and logical sense

1879
00:44:27,869 --> 00:44:29,820
why it needs to be this much.

1880
00:44:30,170 --> 00:44:31,730
When you attempt to lower prices,

1881
00:44:31,730 --> 00:44:33,420
when you lower your prices, you

1882
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:35,150
have to remove components of your

1883
00:44:35,210 --> 00:44:35,780
offer.

1884
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:36,590
And when you have to remove

1885
00:44:37,090 --> 00:44:38,369
components of your offer, it's no

1886
00:44:38,369 --> 00:44:40,820
longer enough logistical intensity

1887
00:44:40,869 --> 00:44:43,630
to be enough to justify a high

1888
00:44:43,630 --> 00:44:45,440
quoted result.

1889
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:46,449
You're fucking everyone when

1890
00:44:46,659 --> 00:44:47,679
you're charging these little baby

1891
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:48,380
ass prices.

1892
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:49,659
So when you attempt to lower your

1893
00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:50,960
prices and remove components of

1894
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,659
your offer, all this does is

1895
00:44:52,659 --> 00:44:54,690
decrease the probability the

1896
00:44:54,690 --> 00:44:56,320
client gets a result,

1897
00:44:56,590 --> 00:44:57,920
decreases how much money you make,

1898
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:59,150
and decreases how many case

1899
00:44:59,150 --> 00:45:00,739
studies you produce over time.

1900
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,570
You need to sell higher packages

1901
00:45:02,699 --> 00:45:04,309
with more stuff to get better

1902
00:45:04,309 --> 00:45:05,059
results.

1903
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:06,889
You need to charge more money, not

1904
00:45:07,019 --> 00:45:08,610
just for you, but also for the

1905
00:45:08,610 --> 00:45:09,250
client.

1906
00:45:09,530 --> 00:45:10,269
Because if you don't charge them

1907
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:11,309
enough, they're not going to get

1908
00:45:11,309 --> 00:45:11,780
results.

1909
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:12,869
They literally have to spend more

1910
00:45:12,889 --> 00:45:13,500
to get results.

1911
00:45:13,539 --> 00:45:14,929
If you don't charge the client

1912
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:16,530
enough money, it won't be enough

1913
00:45:16,530 --> 00:45:18,000
for you to do all the shit that's

1914
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,820
required to get them results.

1915
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:21,650
So by charging them less money,

1916
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:23,739
they get shittier results because

1917
00:45:23,739 --> 00:45:25,510
you're not willing to do all the

1918
00:45:25,610 --> 00:45:27,480
deep, extensive required shit it

1919
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:29,340
fucking takes to get them results.

1920
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:31,380
You have to charge them more money

1921
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:33,110
in order to do the shit that is

1922
00:45:33,110 --> 00:45:34,559
required, right?

1923
00:45:34,599 --> 00:45:35,789
And if you keep getting stuck in

1924
00:45:35,869 --> 00:45:37,119
the cycle of selling little pussy

1925
00:45:37,130 --> 00:45:38,039
number packages,

1926
00:45:38,099 --> 00:45:39,710
then it's completely economically

1927
00:45:39,710 --> 00:45:41,300
impossible for you to get rich.

1928
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:43,039
If you want to get rich, you need

1929
00:45:43,110 --> 00:45:44,519
to sell expensive shit.

1930
00:45:44,789 --> 00:45:45,860
Imagine how much easier it is to

1931
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:48,119
make $100,000 per month the profit

1932
00:45:48,119 --> 00:45:49,480
if all your clients pay at least

1933
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:50,920
$7,000 per month.

1934
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:52,710
Why haven't you been able to do

1935
00:45:52,710 --> 00:45:53,500
this yet?

1936
00:45:53,539 --> 00:45:54,969
You don't have an ROI calculator

1937
00:45:54,969 --> 00:45:56,159
and you don't walk through

1938
00:45:56,159 --> 00:45:57,920
clients' actual numbers, right?

1939
00:45:57,960 --> 00:45:58,730
You're scared to ask for more

1940
00:45:58,730 --> 00:46:00,110
money because you're not confident

1941
00:46:00,110 --> 00:46:01,340
in your ability to get results.

1942
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:02,139
You're not confident in your

1943
00:46:02,219 --> 00:46:03,329
ability to get results because you

1944
00:46:03,329 --> 00:46:04,510
don't charge clients enough money

1945
00:46:04,510 --> 00:46:05,849
in order to warrant you doing more

1946
00:46:06,170 --> 00:46:07,199
stuff for them, right?

1947
00:46:08,829 --> 00:46:09,360
Because you don't get enough

1948
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:10,579
results for clients, you don't get

1949
00:46:10,579 --> 00:46:11,380
good case studies.

1950
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:12,559
Due to your lack of case studies,

1951
00:46:12,670 --> 00:46:13,579
you continue to not sell high

1952
00:46:13,579 --> 00:46:14,980
value clients and you continue

1953
00:46:15,050 --> 00:46:16,670
begging and scraping away for low

1954
00:46:16,670 --> 00:46:17,960
ticket baby clients.

1955
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:19,480
Here's what you need to do

1956
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:20,059
immediately.

1957
00:46:20,099 --> 00:46:21,039
You need to make an ROI

1958
00:46:21,369 --> 00:46:21,780
calculator.

1959
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:22,860
You can make a simple one in

1960
00:46:23,090 --> 00:46:24,110
Google Sheets and have ChatGPT

1961
00:46:24,349 --> 00:46:25,300
guide you on how to do it.

1962
00:46:25,550 --> 00:46:27,440
You can also make one in Lovable

1963
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:28,219
or Bolt.

1964
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:30,300
We'll likely post a tutorial on

1965
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:32,289
how to do this at some point.

1966
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:33,719
When I do, it'll be linked below.

1967
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,150
But make a sales deck in exactly

1968
00:46:35,159 --> 00:46:36,550
the same fashion as a cold email

1969
00:46:36,599 --> 00:46:37,280
setup one.

1970
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:38,280
It'll be linked down below.

1971
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:39,469
And then map out all the points of

1972
00:46:39,570 --> 00:46:40,519
logistical intensity that are

1973
00:46:40,849 --> 00:46:41,650
involved in your offer.

1974
00:46:41,699 --> 00:46:43,010
Map them out in a fashion where

1975
00:46:43,010 --> 00:46:44,469
you're assuming you're getting

1976
00:46:44,469 --> 00:46:46,170
paid $10,000 to do it.

1977
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:47,579
Do not leave anything out.

1978
00:46:47,829 --> 00:46:48,829
Write down every single thing

1979
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:50,130
you'd be doing if somebody gave

1980
00:46:50,150 --> 00:46:52,090
you $10,000 to absolutely maximize

1981
00:46:52,329 --> 00:46:53,530
the probability that they would

1982
00:46:53,530 --> 00:46:54,880
get extremely good results.

1983
00:46:54,940 --> 00:46:57,119
Assume you just got paid $10,000

1984
00:46:57,389 --> 00:46:58,690
to do the thing that you do for

1985
00:46:58,760 --> 00:46:59,389
clients.

1986
00:46:59,519 --> 00:47:00,289
What's everything that you would

1987
00:47:00,289 --> 00:47:01,719
do for $10,000 in comparison to

1988
00:47:01,769 --> 00:47:02,440
$2,000?

1989
00:47:03,619 --> 00:47:05,000
That's your fucking offer now.

1990
00:47:05,269 --> 00:47:06,719
That's the offer.

1991
00:47:06,989 --> 00:47:09,530
And if you get on a call with a

1992
00:47:09,530 --> 00:47:12,860
client and you map out this whole

1993
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:15,170
giant shit, this whole giant

1994
00:47:15,219 --> 00:47:16,880
package of what's included,

1995
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:17,679
and you quote them a high price

1996
00:47:17,769 --> 00:47:19,699
like $5,000, $6,000, $7,000 a

1997
00:47:19,699 --> 00:47:20,070
month,

1998
00:47:20,119 --> 00:47:21,059
and for whatever the fuck reason

1999
00:47:21,389 --> 00:47:22,320
they can't afford that and they

2000
00:47:22,619 --> 00:47:23,400
want to pay less money,

2001
00:47:23,630 --> 00:47:25,079
just remove some of the components

2002
00:47:25,079 --> 00:47:25,900
on the offer.

2003
00:47:26,239 --> 00:47:27,659
What I'm saying is that they're

2004
00:47:27,659 --> 00:47:29,480
only going to get excited when you

2005
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:31,099
show them the offer with all of

2006
00:47:31,099 --> 00:47:32,059
the components,

2007
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:33,409
and they're only going to get the

2008
00:47:33,409 --> 00:47:34,710
best results when you show them

2009
00:47:34,710 --> 00:47:35,659
the offer with all of the

2010
00:47:35,730 --> 00:47:36,440
components.

2011
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:38,039
The more expensive thing.

2012
00:47:38,309 --> 00:47:39,760
You have to do this.

2013
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:40,610
It's completely fucking required

2014
00:47:41,019 --> 00:47:41,789
for you to do this in order for

2015
00:47:41,789 --> 00:47:42,480
you to get rich.

2016
00:47:42,539 --> 00:47:44,159
Don't be a pussy about it.

2017
00:47:44,199 --> 00:47:44,969
You have to do this.

2018
00:47:45,179 --> 00:47:46,010
I want you to get rich.

2019
00:47:46,469 --> 00:47:47,010
Fucking listen to me.

2020
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:47,840
All right.

2021
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:48,340
I love you.

2022
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:48,639
Peace.
