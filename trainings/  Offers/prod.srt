1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,020
All right.

2
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:02,660
Let's talk about product market

3
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:03,100
fit.

4
00:00:03,169 --> 00:00:04,860
So there is zero situation where

5
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:05,559
you should ever

6
00:00:05,559 --> 00:00:06,839
just make something up, right?

7
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:08,000
This is extremely important to

8
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,800
understand because every single

9
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,490
business you ever run should

10
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:13,619
exclusively be derived because you

11
00:00:13,619 --> 00:00:14,740
saw or figured out

12
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:16,820
that somebody else was making

13
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:18,070
money doing it.

14
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:18,649
Okay.

15
00:00:18,649 --> 00:00:20,379
This isn't like a massive

16
00:00:20,379 --> 00:00:21,559
misconception

17
00:00:21,559 --> 00:00:23,210
with how to get profoundly fucking

18
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:23,609
rich.

19
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:25,199
Everybody thinks you need to make

20
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:25,480
like

21
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,620
the next Facebook or some, the

22
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:29,750
next Uber or some bullshit like

23
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:30,420
that.

24
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,049
This is, this is so wildly

25
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,600
wrong because you have to think

26
00:00:34,619 --> 00:00:36,259
there there's of the millions and

27
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,280
tens of millions of people who try

28
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,909
to make these little startup

29
00:00:39,909 --> 00:00:42,020
companies that make something new,

30
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:43,780
fucking one of them works.

31
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:44,409
So it's

32
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:48,640
just, it's like a 0.00000001%

33
00:00:48,659 --> 00:00:50,320
chance of working.

34
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,829
It's so like, yeah, you're more

35
00:00:52,899 --> 00:00:55,140
probable to win

36
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:56,310
the Powerball lottery.

37
00:00:56,409 --> 00:00:58,049
And like, you're more probable to

38
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:00,299
be struck by lightning like 14

39
00:01:00,299 --> 00:01:01,219
fucking times in

40
00:01:01,219 --> 00:01:01,929
your life.

41
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,920
You get, you know what I'm saying?

42
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,510
Like it's what you need to do is

43
00:01:05,569 --> 00:01:07,040
if you just copied the

44
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:09,260
shit that already works, that

45
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:11,340
already actively sells in the

46
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,079
market, your probability of making

47
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:14,480
money,

48
00:01:14,489 --> 00:01:16,709
like substantial fucking life

49
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:18,680
changing amounts of money

50
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:20,609
massively increases.

51
00:01:20,629 --> 00:01:21,319
Like what do you have

52
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:23,640
to understand is, is like, if I

53
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:27,079
say something like $100,000 per

54
00:01:27,099 --> 00:01:31,920
month, um, or, or like a million a

55
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,670
year profit, like you think like,

56
00:01:33,769 --> 00:01:35,480
wow, that's a fuck ton of money,

57
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:39,140
but there's fucking trillions of

58
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,609
dollars that exist.

59
00:01:40,609 --> 00:01:42,859
It's like, it's, it's so, it's so

60
00:01:42,859 --> 00:01:44,709
wildly small of an amount.

61
00:01:44,709 --> 00:01:46,019
The United States

62
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,640
government considers a company

63
00:01:48,709 --> 00:01:51,769
that makes less than $50 million

64
00:01:51,769 --> 00:01:54,319
per year, a small business,

65
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:57,340
1 million per year is fucking one

66
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:00,980
50th that it's one 50th of a small

67
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,040
company.

68
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,620
You really don't

69
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,480
understand how fucking many

70
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:07,500
dollars there are to be made.

71
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,120
Right?

72
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,080
So what I'm trying to say is,

73
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,539
is you need to copy things.

74
00:02:12,539 --> 00:02:15,629
Like the concept of saturation is,

75
00:02:15,629 --> 00:02:18,659
it's, it's, it's, it's, it's a

76
00:02:18,669 --> 00:02:20,710
signal that people are buying the

77
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:21,770
fucking thing.

78
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,900
Like you, you want something to be

79
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:24,860
saturated.

80
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:25,240
You

81
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,889
want other people to be selling it

82
00:02:26,889 --> 00:02:28,460
because if they're not, you're

83
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:28,979
fucked.

84
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:30,259
You're like so completely

85
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:30,800
fucked.

86
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:31,280
Right?

87
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,900
So like, let's, let's get into

88
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:33,860
this real quick.

89
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,560
So offer, because we, we need to

90
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:36,770
distinguish like what I mean when

91
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,830
I'm saying these two different

92
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:38,300
things.

93
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,719
So offer is the positioning of how

94
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:41,219
you convey your offer to cold

95
00:02:41,219 --> 00:02:42,819
traffic and a single headliner

96
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:45,009
sentence and product is the actual

97
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:46,750
problem you're solving via a set

98
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:47,800
of deliverables.

99
00:02:47,949 --> 00:02:49,620
So like, um, for instance, my

100
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:50,580
product was like,

101
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:52,439
you bought this, uh, AI assisted

102
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:53,139
agency.

103
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:55,099
The product is like, is a coaching

104
00:02:55,099 --> 00:02:56,560
program that teaches you

105
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,310
how to launch and scale an AI

106
00:02:58,409 --> 00:02:59,629
assisted agency.

107
00:02:59,729 --> 00:03:00,919
That's what it is.

108
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,599
Um, a list kit, the cold email

109
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:04,460
setup offer is it's, it's, it's,

110
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,060
it's a done for you setup of a

111
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,860
cold email system, right?

112
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:08,340
That that's

113
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,199
what the product is right now.

114
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,189
Sometimes you can have an offer

115
00:03:12,189 --> 00:03:14,039
that follows all the guidelines,

116
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:15,460
like big number claim, big

117
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:16,210
guarantee.

118
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:18,009
They'll hit those numbers, but it

119
00:03:18,009 --> 00:03:18,979
still won't sell.

120
00:03:18,979 --> 00:03:19,400
Why?

121
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:21,210
Because it lacks product market

122
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:21,759
fit.

123
00:03:21,909 --> 00:03:23,699
It's just not something that the

124
00:03:23,699 --> 00:03:24,789
market wants.

125
00:03:24,819 --> 00:03:25,539
It just

126
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:26,699
fucking isn't right.

127
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:28,139
So, um, I give you a, for

128
00:03:28,139 --> 00:03:29,740
instance, if we were trying to

129
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:31,180
sell the cold email

130
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:33,979
setup offer to like, I don't know,

131
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:37,669
fucking private schools to, I, I,

132
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:39,479
I don't even know.

133
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:40,699
Cause the cold

134
00:03:40,699 --> 00:03:41,729
email should actually work very

135
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:42,909
well, but it might be like, okay,

136
00:03:42,909 --> 00:03:43,919
so say we start trying to sell

137
00:03:43,939 --> 00:03:44,259
cold

138
00:03:44,259 --> 00:03:45,620
email to like D to C brands.

139
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,039
We're like, Hey, you can make

140
00:03:47,189 --> 00:03:48,550
sales with, with automating a

141
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:49,360
bunch of cold

142
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,740
email or, or, or whatnot.

143
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:52,389
They'll probably think like, no,

144
00:03:52,389 --> 00:03:53,639
that's like random spam.

145
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:54,960
I'm not, I'm not trying

146
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,460
to do that, but then you can make

147
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:57,949
another angle of it's B2B cold

148
00:03:57,949 --> 00:03:58,400
email.

149
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,580
We can get you in retail

150
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:00,000
stores.

151
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,750
Then it would work.

152
00:04:00,849 --> 00:04:01,800
You get what I'm saying?

153
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:03,289
Like, well, sometimes, sometimes

154
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:03,680
you're

155
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,849
just trying to sell something that

156
00:04:04,949 --> 00:04:05,840
doesn't fucking work.

157
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,900
That's not the best example to

158
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:07,409
give you,

159
00:04:07,419 --> 00:04:09,520
but sometimes you're trying to

160
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,379
sell a product to a specific

161
00:04:11,379 --> 00:04:13,879
market and they just don't want to

162
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:14,300
buy it.

163
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,439
It's just not something they're

164
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:17,740
ever going to buy.

165
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:18,370
Right?

166
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:20,209
So how, so this is important

167
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:20,819
because

168
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:23,029
you, if you start selling

169
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:25,459
something that has no product

170
00:04:25,459 --> 00:04:28,060
market fit and you just made the

171
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:28,379
shit up

172
00:04:28,379 --> 00:04:29,949
and it doesn't work, you just

173
00:04:29,949 --> 00:04:31,600
wasted so much fucking time and

174
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:32,160
effort.

175
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:33,920
Cause think about all the shit

176
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,290
you have to do here, right?

177
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:36,699
You got, you got to fucking, you

178
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:37,899
got to make a website.

179
00:04:37,899 --> 00:04:38,699
You got to make

180
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:39,230
a VSL.

181
00:04:39,459 --> 00:04:40,930
You got to get a list of a bunch

182
00:04:41,129 --> 00:04:43,240
of people to outreach to, and you

183
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:43,850
got it.

184
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:45,019
You got to write

185
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,639
your fucking, write your fucking

186
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:47,569
emails to do that.

187
00:04:47,569 --> 00:04:48,800
You got to set up all the tech

188
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:49,620
behind that.

189
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:50,060
And then

190
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:51,470
you got to start sending the

191
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,149
emails and like, it's a, it's a

192
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,019
whole fucking set of shit to do.

193
00:04:55,019 --> 00:04:55,329
And if,

194
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,060
if this is your first time doing

195
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,060
it too, it's like, it's like 10

196
00:04:59,069 --> 00:05:00,879
times more effort than it would

197
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:01,149
take

198
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,470
me because like you have to deeply

199
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:03,709
think about everything you're

200
00:05:03,709 --> 00:05:04,089
doing.

201
00:05:04,089 --> 00:05:05,439
It's a, it's like a colossal

202
00:05:05,449 --> 00:05:06,610
fucking pain in the ass.

203
00:05:06,709 --> 00:05:07,160
Right.

204
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,519
And now imagine you did all of

205
00:05:08,529 --> 00:05:10,240
this and then you're selling the

206
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,699
shit and you spend like, I don't

207
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:13,319
know, six weeks fucking with it.

208
00:05:13,329 --> 00:05:14,839
And nobody's getting on the call

209
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:15,279
with you.

210
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:16,329
Nobody gives a fuck about the

211
00:05:16,329 --> 00:05:17,639
thing that you're selling at all.

212
00:05:17,769 --> 00:05:17,939
Right.

213
00:05:18,009 --> 00:05:18,519
And then,

214
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:19,889
and then you just figure out like,

215
00:05:19,889 --> 00:05:21,120
Oh, this has no product market

216
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:21,300
fit.

217
00:05:21,449 --> 00:05:22,269
And you just waste a

218
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:23,990
fuck ton of time.

219
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,930
It's like, that's so, that's so

220
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:27,920
shitty.

221
00:05:27,939 --> 00:05:30,600
Like that you don't fucking do

222
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,579
that.

223
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:33,560
Don't fucking make something up.

224
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,769
That's, that's what I'm trying to

225
00:05:34,769 --> 00:05:35,389
get out here.

226
00:05:35,459 --> 00:05:35,660
Because

227
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,540
if you fuck that up and you just

228
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:39,529
make an offer up cause you feel

229
00:05:39,529 --> 00:05:41,399
like selling it and you didn't

230
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:43,430
actually find if there was product

231
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:45,459
market fit for it, you're going to

232
00:05:45,459 --> 00:05:46,660
get pissed off in like

233
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:47,740
six weeks from now or whatever,

234
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:48,819
eight weeks from now, you'll be

235
00:05:48,819 --> 00:05:50,220
like, Whoa, Daniel, this isn't

236
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:50,629
working.

237
00:05:50,629 --> 00:05:51,629
And like what you teach in here

238
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:52,209
doesn't work.

239
00:05:52,209 --> 00:05:53,519
It's like, no, you didn't follow

240
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:53,699
the

241
00:05:53,709 --> 00:05:54,860
fucking direction to sell

242
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:56,290
something that actually has

243
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:57,370
product market fit.

244
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:58,939
Don't, don't do this

245
00:05:58,939 --> 00:06:01,170
fucking retard shit, but only sell

246
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:03,420
something that actively already

247
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:04,079
sells.

248
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:05,050
Right.

249
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:06,660
This is the whole

250
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,839
reason why that I designed this,

251
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:10,160
this whole offer.

252
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,410
It's called AI assisted agency.

253
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:13,629
It's not the dumb

254
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:15,810
ass business model, AI arbitrage,

255
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:17,410
not the stupid bullshit.

256
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,029
It's AI assisted agency.

257
00:06:19,029 --> 00:06:19,920
And the entire

258
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,670
purpose of that is so that you

259
00:06:21,769 --> 00:06:23,680
sell products and offers with

260
00:06:23,689 --> 00:06:25,769
already existing active market

261
00:06:25,769 --> 00:06:26,579
demand.

262
00:06:26,939 --> 00:06:27,399
Why?

263
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,360
Because I know if I tell you, so

264
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:31,490
tell you, teach you some fucking

265
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:32,899
retard business model

266
00:06:32,899 --> 00:06:34,209
that just made up in my fucking

267
00:06:34,209 --> 00:06:35,620
head, it's not going to work.

268
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:37,160
You're not going to get results,

269
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:37,779
right?

270
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:39,790
That's, this is literally the

271
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:41,879
whole reason why I made the whole

272
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:43,180
program like this

273
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:45,410
is specifically for this concept

274
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:47,160
of product market fit.

275
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,120
Only sell shit that already

276
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:49,560
fucking

277
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,019
works.

278
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,420
This is, this is wild, this is

279
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:52,990
wildly more important than you

280
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:53,800
think it is.

281
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,279
Right.

282
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:54,860
So,

283
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:57,100
um, two methods to do this, uh,

284
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:59,160
like finding things that have

285
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,800
product market fit.

286
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,540
Right.

287
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:02,120
Okay.

288
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:02,360
So

289
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,769
first is noticing, right?

290
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:05,019
So there's a concept of, of

291
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:06,060
noticing, right?

292
00:07:06,069 --> 00:07:07,399
So see the ads are getting

293
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:09,879
served, actually watch them go

294
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:11,879
through their funnels.

295
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:14,620
I, I listen like a specifically on

296
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:14,970
Instagram,

297
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:16,300
Facebook or YouTube.

298
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,449
I watch and read every ad.

299
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,680
I click the ads to go to the

300
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,500
landing page.

301
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,180
I watch people's VSLs.

302
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,360
I do this all of the fucking time.

303
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,399
I'm, I'm always doing this.

304
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:25,579
I'm

305
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:26,889
always noticing, right?

306
00:07:26,889 --> 00:07:28,360
I'm an, I'm a noticer, right?

307
00:07:28,449 --> 00:07:29,730
I'll get, I'll get this into a

308
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:30,300
second where

309
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,529
it's like, you need to stop being

310
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,779
a consumer and being a subject of

311
00:07:34,779 --> 00:07:36,920
propaganda and start being a

312
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,850
purveyor and noticer of

313
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:38,480
propaganda.

314
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,509
You get what I'm saying?

315
00:07:39,509 --> 00:07:40,980
I'll get this in a second, but

316
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,009
you got to get on Twitter and

317
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:43,209
watch what people are posting

318
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:43,589
about.

319
00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:44,800
People like to brag about how

320
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,829
much money they make, uh,

321
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:47,000
particularly on Twitter.

00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,060

results.

351
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,699
Find out what they're selling.

352
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:29,870
Be, but, but part of being a

353
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:32,139
noticer is understanding when

354
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:32,320
you're

355
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,490
being subjected to propaganda.

356
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:34,548
So I'm going to, I'm going to give

357
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:35,668
you one example here.

358
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:36,279
There, there's,

359
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:38,629
there's one marketer I'm friends

360
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:40,320
with and a while ago he started

361
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,230
posting about how the info market

362
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,059
is cooked.

363
00:08:43,059 --> 00:08:45,320
Everybody's selling courses going

364
00:08:45,419 --> 00:08:46,399
broke, right?

365
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:46,980
Okay.

366
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,879
Then one guy in client ascension

367
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:50,600
was selling a course, right?

368
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:52,220
And that was kind of like his,

369
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:53,750
his, his business model.

370
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,980
And he started

371
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:56,370
sending messages to me, like

372
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,000
freaking out, asking if he should

373
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,830
pivot his business model because

374
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,159
course

375
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:00,909
sellers going broke.

376
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:01,889
He's like, I've been seeing a lot

377
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:02,940
of people posting about like how

378
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:03,269
course

379
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:04,309
sellers are going broke.

380
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:05,470
It isn't working anymore.

381
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:06,720
Like I'm really trying to like,

382
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:07,899
like, should I pivot my business

383
00:09:07,899 --> 00:09:08,919
model and start doing something

384
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:09,090
else?

385
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:10,200
I'm like, bro,

386
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,210
fucking like, you're not a

387
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:12,980
noticer.

388
00:09:13,129 --> 00:09:15,240
And so, so I was like, this is

389
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,080
obviously not true.

390
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:17,419
It's

391
00:09:17,429 --> 00:09:18,559
fucking propaganda.

392
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:20,019
And I noticed this because I'm a

393
00:09:20,019 --> 00:09:21,470
noticer, but, but he wasn't a

394
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:22,139
noticer.

395
00:09:22,139 --> 00:09:22,500
So I was

396
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,360
like, I told him, of course, the

397
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:26,190
fucking course sellers are not

398
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,080
going broke.

399
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,440
I'm like, this guy

400
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,159
who's posting that is just about

401
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:32,009
to launch an offer to info product

402
00:09:32,009 --> 00:09:33,659
owners who he just scared the

403
00:09:33,669 --> 00:09:34,789
shit out of.

404
00:09:34,789 --> 00:09:35,340
IEU.

405
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:36,919
Stop being dumb.

406
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:37,720
Fucking notice.

407
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,870
You know what I'm saying?

408
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:41,340
Like you need to, to

409
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,409
understand what, you need to

410
00:09:43,409 --> 00:09:45,580
understand like these fucking

411
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:48,159
psyops that are being executed in,

412
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:48,419
in

413
00:09:48,419 --> 00:09:50,899
pervade or in, in, in, in forced

414
00:09:50,899 --> 00:09:51,769
upon you.

415
00:09:51,769 --> 00:09:54,279
Like you have to see, you're going

416
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:55,759
to see what the fuck is

417
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:56,730
happening here.

418
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:57,980
You get what I'm saying?

419
00:09:58,059 --> 00:09:59,570
Like you, you have to fucking

420
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:01,299
notice, like this isn't, this

421
00:10:01,299 --> 00:10:02,330
isn't real.

422
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:04,820
Like what it's not fucking real.

423
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,529
It's a psyop, right?

424
00:10:06,529 --> 00:10:09,379
You have to be a noticer of

425
00:10:09,379 --> 00:10:11,009
marketing, of propaganda.

426
00:10:11,009 --> 00:10:12,450
You can't just like blindly

427
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:13,960
fucking accept the shit that

428
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,899
everyone's saying

429
00:10:14,899 --> 00:10:15,279
this.

430
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:16,490
So therefore it's true.

431
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:17,679
It's, it's fucking not.

432
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:19,350
That's like literally like, it's

433
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:19,919
literally

434
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:21,330
propaganda 101.

435
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:23,090
Like just repeat something over

436
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:24,759
and over and over and over again

437
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:25,340
and everybody

438
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:27,370
will believe it.

439
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:31,259
So like as a term, as, as, as, as,

440
00:10:31,259 --> 00:10:34,679
as a marketer, like what do I do

441
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:37,240
when, when I want

442
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,919
to fucking like really sell some

443
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:40,279
shit or sell against it?

444
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:41,809
I, I fucking repeat it all the

445
00:10:41,809 --> 00:10:42,360
time.

446
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:43,059
This is wrong.

447
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:43,590
This is wrong.

448
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:44,139
This is wrong.

449
00:10:44,139 --> 00:10:44,679
This is wrong.

450
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:45,299
This is wrong.

451
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:46,440
You get what I'm saying?

452
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,029
Like that, that's what you do.

453
00:10:48,029 --> 00:10:49,700
That's what was happening here.

454
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,620
That's what happened to this guy.

455
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,480
Like be a noticer, my guy.

456
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:54,179
Right?

457
00:10:54,179 --> 00:10:55,379
So, all right.

458
00:10:55,379 --> 00:10:57,750
Notice the lack of things as well.

459
00:10:57,799 --> 00:10:58,759
So we have one

460
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:00,350
competitor who competes against

461
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:00,620
us.

462
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,220
Um, but he exclusively uses case

463
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:03,500
studies from a different

464
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,190
business model that he used to

465
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:05,720
teach.

466
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,250
Right?

467
00:11:06,269 --> 00:11:07,779
So this is because all of his

468
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,820
current students do not

469
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,929
to get results.

470
00:11:10,929 --> 00:11:11,529
Right?

471
00:11:11,529 --> 00:11:13,350
Yet he still touts the old case

472
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:15,000
studies as if it's the new

473
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,879
business model he's

474
00:11:15,879 --> 00:11:16,519
teaching.

475
00:11:16,659 --> 00:11:17,889
And he talks about how the new

476
00:11:17,889 --> 00:11:19,309
model is so much better, but I

477
00:11:19,309 --> 00:11:20,740
know because I'm a noticer,

478
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:21,899
I'm like all of these.

479
00:11:22,009 --> 00:11:23,519
And if you just fucking actually

480
00:11:23,669 --> 00:11:25,340
read the case study and listen to

481
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:25,600
the

482
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,789
case study, he's saying it's for

483
00:11:26,889 --> 00:11:28,190
this business model, but they're

484
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:29,559
talking about, it's a different

485
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:30,720
business model.

486
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:32,669
So it's like, well, I'm, I'm

487
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:35,000
fucking sitting here like, well, I

488
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,879
noticed this.

489
00:11:35,879 --> 00:11:37,879
You need to notice this shit, bro.

490
00:11:37,879 --> 00:11:39,750
Like you have, you have, you have

491
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:40,879
to fucking, you have

492
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:42,360
to see what is occurring.

493
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:44,250
Not only things happening to you,

494
00:11:44,299 --> 00:11:46,100
but the lack of things happening

495
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:46,519
from

496
00:11:46,549 --> 00:11:47,129
somebody.

497
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:48,289
You know what I'm saying?

498
00:11:48,389 --> 00:11:49,639
So this is obviously him just,

499
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:50,940
just trend happening.

500
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:51,870
For instance.

501
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:53,570
So why do you think I launched an

502
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:55,490
AI program that's specifically AI

503
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:56,100
assisted

504
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:57,580
agency and not fucking AI

505
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:59,210
arbitrage or AI automation

506
00:11:59,289 --> 00:12:00,250
exclusively?

507
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:01,769
Why do you think I did that?

508
00:12:01,789 --> 00:12:02,419
Right.

509
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:04,500
Because it is my genuine belief

510
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,580
and actually objectively true

511
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:08,440
reality that those models are

512
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,610
retarded compared to just selling

513
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:12,940
standard agency services fulfilled

514
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,110
via AI, right?

515
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,929
Even, even my

516
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,629
execution and like, like the way

517
00:12:18,649 --> 00:12:20,840
I'm instructing you to do AI

518
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:23,909
automation, it's selling specific

519
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:24,539
builds.

520
00:12:24,539 --> 00:12:25,700
That's what it is.

521
00:12:25,809 --> 00:12:27,480
It's specific builds because

522
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,799
that's what fucking works, right?

523
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:30,779
When other people tell

524
00:12:30,779 --> 00:12:32,490
you AI automation agency, they're

525
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:34,250
like, they're like, well, yeah,

526
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:35,629
you get on the phone with the

527
00:12:35,649 --> 00:12:36,529
business owner.

528
00:12:36,529 --> 00:12:38,110
And, uh, what you do is you figure

529
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:39,799
out their problems and like, okay,

530
00:12:39,809 --> 00:12:40,299
okay.

531
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:40,940
Stop right

532
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,409
here because you don't just

533
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:44,049
fucking get people on the phone

534
00:12:44,049 --> 00:12:44,669
with you.

535
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:46,440
Like the people don't just get on

536
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,409
the fucking phone.

537
00:12:47,409 --> 00:12:48,669
Like you need an offer to get them

538
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:49,519
on the phone.

539
00:12:49,529 --> 00:12:50,789
You get what I'm saying?

540
00:12:50,789 --> 00:12:52,340
So you

541
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:54,559
as a consumer actually will get

542
00:12:54,769 --> 00:12:56,600
shitty results and have a

543
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,590
profoundly low probability of

544
00:12:58,590 --> 00:12:59,259
making money.

545
00:12:59,259 --> 00:13:00,950
If the only thing you learned was

546
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:02,720
an AI automation agency, even if

547
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,200
that's the model that you're

548
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:05,950
learning in here, technically, you

549
00:13:06,049 --> 00:13:07,419
should still watch all the other

550
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,279
ones, right?

551
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:09,360
This is proven by the

552
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,529
fact that in the next section here

553
00:13:10,629 --> 00:13:11,899
that I'm about to go to right now,

554
00:13:11,899 --> 00:13:13,639
that there's a massive overlap

555
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,340
between AI automation services and

556
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:18,340
the actual standard agency

557
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:20,539
services in terms of what has

558
00:13:20,539 --> 00:13:22,600
product market fit and is actively

559
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,870
selling right now.

560
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,759
There's no, this is what you got

561
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:26,340
to understand,

562
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:30,259
like AI arbitrage or AI automation

563
00:13:30,259 --> 00:13:33,220
has no straight demand.

564
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:37,129
There's no demand because it's not

565
00:13:37,129 --> 00:13:37,840
an offer,

566
00:13:38,309 --> 00:13:39,019
right?

567
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,409
Specific builds have demand.

568
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,059
Like if somebody wants to automate

569
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,840
their content production

570
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,070
to get results, that's an offer,

571
00:13:48,269 --> 00:13:48,889
right?

572
00:13:48,889 --> 00:13:50,690
That's an offer that can be

573
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:51,870
constructed.

574
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:53,409
Or if somebody wants

575
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,629
like a customer service AI bot

576
00:13:55,629 --> 00:13:58,100
that handles shit tons of requests

577
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:00,559
from people, that's a specific

578
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:01,320
offer.

579
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,899
There's a specific product that

580
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:05,710
can be sold, right?

581
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:08,200
AI automation is not a product.

582
00:14:08,299 --> 00:14:09,029
To be sold.

583
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,029
It's a vehicle.

584
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:11,519
You get what I'm saying?

585
00:14:11,539 --> 00:14:13,570
It's like, it's like selling.

586
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,580
It's like,

587
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,049
it's like fucking literally going

588
00:14:16,049 --> 00:14:17,830
up to someone and it was like 1998

589
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:20,019
and you're like, hey, I can help

590
00:14:20,019 --> 00:14:21,399
you with the internet with your

591
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:21,990
business.

592
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:23,500
It's like, what the fuck does that

593
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:23,870
mean?

594
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:24,960
What, what does that

595
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,399
mean?

596
00:14:25,649 --> 00:14:27,139
Like, like I can sell you, I sell

597
00:14:27,139 --> 00:14:28,149
internet, bro.

598
00:14:28,149 --> 00:14:29,789
What the fuck are you saying?

599
00:14:29,789 --> 00:14:30,700
That's what,

600
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,559
that's what saying I sell AI

601
00:14:32,659 --> 00:14:34,070
automation means.

602
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,360
I sell internet.

603
00:14:35,389 --> 00:14:37,580
It doesn't make any fucking sense.

604
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:39,659
Like, what are you selling?

605
00:14:39,659 --> 00:14:40,860
Is it a website?

606
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,779
Is it like a fucking, is it an

607
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:44,379
email system for your,

608
00:14:44,379 --> 00:14:45,279
for your shit?

609
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:46,610
Is it a video conferencing

610
00:14:46,809 --> 00:14:47,409
software?

611
00:14:47,409 --> 00:14:49,159
What the fuck internet shit are

612
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:49,559
you selling?

613
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:50,730
You know what I'm saying?

614
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:51,789
That's what it means.

615
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:53,480
So that's, that's the best way to

616
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,279
have me help you

617
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,360
visualize it.

618
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,139
So, okay.

619
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,120
The second way to find what has

620
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,190
product market fit is by using AI

621
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:00,600
deep

622
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:01,279
research.

623
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:02,840
So I just made this prompt out of

624
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,399
nowhere.

625
00:15:03,549 --> 00:15:05,139
Like literally like, literally

626
00:15:05,139 --> 00:15:06,000
like an hour ago.

627
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,320
So I'm running an AI automation

628
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:07,750
agency.

629
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:09,309
Please conduct research about what

630
00:15:09,309 --> 00:15:10,149
specific builds

631
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:11,860
or automation specific companies

632
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:12,940
are actively buying.

633
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,450
I'm specifically looking for

634
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,019
products

635
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,690
that have active market, that have

636
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:17,700
product market fit.

637
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:19,090
Don't make random services or

638
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:19,639
builds up.

639
00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:19,960
I only

640
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,039
want to know things that are

641
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:22,190
actively being sold, that have

642
00:15:22,389 --> 00:15:23,620
active market demand, work as a

643
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:24,120
front end

644
00:15:24,139 --> 00:15:25,299
call traffic offer, and have true

645
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:26,000
product market fit.

646
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,179
The purpose of me asking you this

647
00:15:27,179 --> 00:15:27,620
question is in

648
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:28,549
order to find products or services

649
00:15:28,549 --> 00:15:29,299
I can promote that I know for a

650
00:15:29,299 --> 00:15:30,259
fact that product market fits,

651
00:15:30,259 --> 00:15:31,070
so I don't waste a bunch of time

652
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:32,009
and money trying to sell something

653
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:33,039
that isn't even going to end up

654
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:33,679
working.

655
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:34,129
Okay.

656
00:15:34,129 --> 00:15:36,139
So I put this prompt, the GPT-5,

657
00:15:36,139 --> 00:15:38,200
CLAWD 4.1 deep research, and

658
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:38,799
Manus, right?

659
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:39,240
So I'm going

660
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:42,019
to open this up, right?

661
00:15:42,169 --> 00:15:43,509
So, okay.

662
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:46,120
What did GPT-5 say?

663
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,100
E-commerce and DTC, UGC to ads,

664
00:15:49,159 --> 00:15:49,659
auto editor.

665
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:50,000
I'm not

666
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,179
going to go through all of these.

667
00:15:51,269 --> 00:15:52,220
It'll take a long time, but the

668
00:15:52,429 --> 00:15:53,379
links to them, like you could

669
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:53,690
pause

670
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,179
this video right now.

671
00:15:55,179 --> 00:15:56,889
The link to this Gamma Doc is

672
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:59,240
here, and then just open these up,

673
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,259
and then go

674
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:00,820
there, right?

675
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:03,610
Local services, lead to book job,

676
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:06,210
SMS agent, SDR email, LinkedIn

677
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:06,919
agent.

678
00:16:07,009 --> 00:16:08,179
So like, okay.

679
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:08,580
So

680
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:10,440
like, you get what I'm saying

681
00:16:10,539 --> 00:16:11,039
here?

682
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:13,340
What's like, SDR email to LinkedIn

683
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:13,960
agent.

684
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,470
It's like, well, that would

685
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,139
fall under being a lead gen

686
00:16:17,139 --> 00:16:17,700
agency.

687
00:16:17,909 --> 00:16:20,230
Like, lead to book job, SMS agent.

688
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:22,139
That would also kind of fall under

689
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:23,330
being a lead gen agency.

690
00:16:23,429 --> 00:16:24,690
UGC to ads, auto editor.

691
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:26,409
Like this, this would, this would

692
00:16:26,409 --> 00:16:27,340
fall under being

693
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:28,950
like a, like an advertising

694
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:30,000
agency, right?

695
00:16:30,029 --> 00:16:31,889
You got to say, like, there's,

696
00:16:31,889 --> 00:16:34,000
there's a considerable amount

697
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,190
of overlap that occurs with AI

698
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:38,840
automation versus just like actual

699
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,320
fucking normal agency business

700
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:41,720
models.

701
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,750
You get what I'm saying?

702
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:45,100
So let me open the, let me open

703
00:16:45,139 --> 00:16:46,759
what Claude said.

704
00:16:46,759 --> 00:16:48,870
Customer service chatbots,

705
00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:50,539
sales automation tools, content

706
00:16:50,539 --> 00:16:51,149
generation.

707
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:51,639
Okay.

708
00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:52,909
So this is a fucking content

709
00:16:52,909 --> 00:16:53,460
agency.

710
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,269
This is a lead gen agency.

711
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:56,799
This is just customer service.

712
00:16:56,799 --> 00:16:58,480
That's kind of a lead gen agency.

713
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:58,679
Not

714
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:00,909
really, but workflow automation,

715
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:01,970
consulting.

716
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:04,210
Well, consulting would only occur

717
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:04,980
if you have

718
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:07,109
inbound traffic, but let me go to

719
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:07,720
Manus.

720
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,619
Manus gave me like a lot of like

721
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:11,180
enterprise level type

722
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:11,818
stuff.

723
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:12,859
Uh, hold on.

724
00:17:12,859 --> 00:17:15,328
Workflow automation, you know, AI

725
00:17:15,328 --> 00:17:18,660
powered development tools, uh, uh,

726
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:19,279
customer service

727
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:20,779
automation, sales and marketing

728
00:17:20,818 --> 00:17:22,269
automation, uh, operations to

729
00:17:22,269 --> 00:17:22,789
process.

730
00:17:22,789 --> 00:17:23,930
You get, you get what I'm

731
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:24,549
saying?

732
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:25,460
So, um, okay.

733
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:27,279
So then I gave it another prompt.

734
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:28,710
I was like, what, okay.

735
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:29,789
What about simple

736
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:31,119
agency services that a beginner

737
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:31,549
can sell?

738
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:32,990
And that's what this second tab is

739
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:33,589
over here.

740
00:17:33,589 --> 00:17:35,160
So like in Manus,

741
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:37,440
they gave me some stuff over here,

742
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,950
SEO automation, uh, workflow

743
00:17:39,019 --> 00:17:41,000
automation, marketing automation,

744
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,500
uh, Claude gave me AI chatbots for

745
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,579
small business, cold email

746
00:17:45,579 --> 00:17:48,339
automation, AI content automation,

747
00:17:48,339 --> 00:17:50,900
database reactivation campaigns.

748
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:53,059
This, this is actually fucking

749
00:17:53,059 --> 00:17:55,910
like not really a good, so I kind

750
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:56,019
of

751
00:17:56,019 --> 00:17:57,130
touched on this.

752
00:17:57,130 --> 00:17:59,000
Um, and I've told this to people

753
00:17:59,000 --> 00:17:59,619
before.

754
00:17:59,619 --> 00:18:01,410
I, I had a guy one time, uh, he

755
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:01,980
was in one

756
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:04,170
of our get clients challenges a

757
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:06,539
while back and, um, he told me he

758
00:18:06,539 --> 00:18:08,869
paid a hundred thousand dollars

759
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,650
in order to learn how to sell AI

760
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,279
and make an AI business.

761
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:14,539
And the guy had him, this was the,

762
00:18:14,539 --> 00:18:15,970
this was the offer that the guy

763
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:17,160
made for him, a database

764
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,619
reactivation campaign.

765
00:18:18,619 --> 00:18:19,720
What does that

766
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,299
mean?

767
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,769
Like, imagine, imagine there's a

768
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:26,009
company who has like 20,000 leads

769
00:18:26,009 --> 00:18:28,480
or like 40,000 leads

770
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,619
order that they have a shit ton of

771
00:18:29,619 --> 00:18:30,579
people in their CRM or their

772
00:18:30,579 --> 00:18:31,849
salespeople aren't really hitting

773
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:32,079
up.

774
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:34,309
So what, what, what a database

775
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:36,849
reactivation campaign would do is

776
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:38,880
send emails and send outreach or

777
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,109
whatever the fuck to all these

778
00:18:41,309 --> 00:18:44,009
people, maybe like call and text

779
00:18:44,009 --> 00:18:46,720
them, um, as a, as, as a way to

780
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:46,960
get

781
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,119
them like back into a sales

782
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:48,980
conversation.

783
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:50,619
Now that theoretically sounds like

784
00:18:50,619 --> 00:18:51,500
a good idea to you,

785
00:18:51,509 --> 00:18:52,109
right?

786
00:18:52,279 --> 00:18:54,279
Because it's, and it could be, but

787
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:56,750
because you, well, you could, you

788
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,259
could put like a fat

789
00:18:58,269 --> 00:18:59,609
fucking number claim on this and

790
00:18:59,609 --> 00:19:00,660
like a guarantee on it.

791
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:01,910
But if you remember in the last

792
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:02,299
video,

793
00:19:03,079 --> 00:19:04,930
something I said was that you need

794
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:07,109
to sell new money, like new

795
00:19:07,109 --> 00:19:08,019
system.

796
00:19:08,019 --> 00:19:09,869
What does this mean?

797
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,109
Database reactivation.

798
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:12,720
It means, it means it's a database

799
00:19:12,869 --> 00:19:13,740
they already have.

800
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:14,900
It's their CRM that they

801
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:15,930
already have.

802
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:17,509
So what does that mean?

803
00:19:17,509 --> 00:19:19,450
It means that the entire idea of

804
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:21,839
the offer is scalping,

805
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:23,319
is scalping revenue off of

806
00:19:23,319 --> 00:19:25,160
something they already have.

807
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,049
And that's their conception of it

808
00:19:27,049 --> 00:19:27,640
where it's

809
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,799
like, no, thanks.

810
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:30,539
I don't need you to go into my CRM

811
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:31,009
for me.

812
00:19:31,059 --> 00:19:32,789
So this guy, I was talking to him

813
00:19:32,789 --> 00:19:33,160
and

814
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,019
like, he's like, I've sent tens of

815
00:19:35,119 --> 00:19:36,660
thousands of cold emails.

816
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:38,680
I haven't gotten anyone interested

817
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:38,880
in

818
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,400
this at all.

819
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,049
It's been months.

820
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:41,099
I haven't made any money.

821
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,380
I've wasted a hundred thousand

822
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:42,859
dollars on

823
00:19:42,859 --> 00:19:43,140
this.

824
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,259
And what's so fucking funny, the

825
00:19:44,259 --> 00:19:45,079
guy spent a hundred thousand

826
00:19:45,289 --> 00:19:45,859
dollars on it.

827
00:19:45,859 --> 00:19:47,970
This, like this, you don't even

828
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:49,779
need fucking AI to do this.

829
00:19:49,779 --> 00:19:52,140
Like it's complete, like where's

830
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:52,519
the AI

831
00:19:52,579 --> 00:19:53,000
here?

832
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,259
Like you don't need AI.

833
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:55,279
Like you can send SMS

834
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:57,099
reactivation, email list, you

835
00:19:57,099 --> 00:19:57,420
know,

836
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:59,450
multi-channel reactivation with

837
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:01,410
fucking zero AI in any capacity at

838
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:01,829
all.

839
00:20:01,829 --> 00:20:04,259
Like, like where's the AI?

840
00:20:04,259 --> 00:20:05,920
And the answer is that there's

841
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,859
fucking none.

842
00:20:06,859 --> 00:20:08,509
So this guy got scammed out of a

843
00:20:08,509 --> 00:20:09,059
hundred

844
00:20:09,369 --> 00:20:11,500
fucking grand with the shitty

845
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:14,130
offer that is not a front end cold

846
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:15,700
traffic offer.

847
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:16,349
Right?

848
00:20:16,349 --> 00:20:17,380
So again,

849
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:19,450
the second component, another

850
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:21,559
component of a cold traffic front

851
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:23,599
end offer is, is, is it's new

852
00:20:23,609 --> 00:20:24,190
money.

853
00:20:24,329 --> 00:20:25,789
It's new money, right?

854
00:20:25,789 --> 00:20:26,299
Okay.

855
00:20:26,299 --> 00:20:28,039
What do I mean by new money?

856
00:20:28,039 --> 00:20:28,980
Like, okay.

857
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,740
AI content automation.

858
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:32,349
What this would mean is like you

859
00:20:32,349 --> 00:20:33,769
build a content system for a

860
00:20:33,769 --> 00:20:36,359
business that doesn't fucking do

861
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:36,859
content

862
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:37,240
yet.

863
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,240
What does that mean?

864
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,670
It means that you made something

865
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,369
new for them.

866
00:20:40,369 --> 00:20:41,769
It's new money, right?

867
00:20:41,779 --> 00:20:42,140
So

868
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:42,779
what is this?

869
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,000
Like if you build a cold email

870
00:20:44,099 --> 00:20:45,509
automation system for a business,

871
00:20:45,559 --> 00:20:45,960
right?

872
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:46,380
What does

873
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:47,140
that mean?

874
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,039
If they don't do cold email, it's

875
00:20:49,069 --> 00:20:49,829
new money.

876
00:20:49,829 --> 00:20:51,339
You created something.

877
00:20:51,339 --> 00:20:53,039
You, you, you spawned

878
00:20:53,099 --> 00:20:54,960
it from the fucking ether, right?

879
00:20:55,059 --> 00:20:56,829
So AI chatbot for small business,

880
00:20:56,829 --> 00:20:57,259
right?

881
00:20:57,319 --> 00:20:57,829
Right.

882
00:20:57,829 --> 00:20:59,230
It's, it's this,

883
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:00,990
this is kind of like, it's not

884
00:21:01,109 --> 00:21:02,480
really revenue per se.

885
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,319
It's more so like maybe it is,

886
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:04,799
there can be some

887
00:21:04,809 --> 00:21:06,809
sales component to it, but it's

888
00:21:06,809 --> 00:21:08,829
actually just helping them like

889
00:21:08,829 --> 00:21:10,740
save money as a, like, like

890
00:21:11,049 --> 00:21:12,099
efficiency and shit.

891
00:21:12,099 --> 00:21:14,039
But this, this is not new money.

892
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:15,710
It's not new money, right?

893
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:16,759
So it's, it's

894
00:21:17,539 --> 00:21:18,980
difficult to sell as a front end

895
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:20,799
cold traffic offer.

896
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:23,380
I'm not saying it couldn't work.

897
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:24,049
There are

898
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:26,089
situations where it could work.

899
00:21:26,089 --> 00:21:27,980
But what I'm saying is that if you

900
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:29,940
were fucking selling a database

901
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:31,670
reactivation offer, like that's

902
00:21:31,789 --> 00:21:33,480
not a fucking business, bro, this

903
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,200
is like a random offer.

904
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:35,460
It's

905
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,589
a random fucking product that

906
00:21:37,589 --> 00:21:40,119
should ideally exclusively be sold

907
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:41,509
to warm traffic.

908
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:41,900
You know

909
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:42,740
what I'm saying?

910
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:44,210
Like, like if you were doing this,

911
00:21:44,329 --> 00:21:45,410
I would tell you, this is

912
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:46,180
something that

913
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,819
you sell to clients you already

914
00:21:47,819 --> 00:21:49,269
have, that you already sold

915
00:21:49,269 --> 00:21:50,250
something else.

916
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:51,819
For instance, you run

917
00:21:51,819 --> 00:21:53,500
an ads agency, right?

918
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,740
And you help people build funnels

919
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:58,019
and make a fuck ton of money from,

920
00:21:58,019 --> 00:21:58,279
from,

921
00:21:58,359 --> 00:22:00,589
from funnels you make them, right?

922
00:22:00,789 --> 00:22:02,980
Fucking, and this is like a random

923
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:04,490
thing you do for them,

924
00:22:04,549 --> 00:22:05,240
right?

925
00:22:05,319 --> 00:22:07,150
This is not a front end cold

926
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:09,069
traffic offer, right?

927
00:22:09,069 --> 00:22:11,700
So again, this comes back to being

928
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:12,109
like a

929
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:13,859
noticer, like a, like you got to

930
00:22:13,859 --> 00:22:14,640
be a noticer.

931
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,329
So like, for instance, this guy

932
00:22:16,329 --> 00:22:17,220
got so fucking

933
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:18,670
psyoped into like, yeah, I'm going

934
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,000
to help you build an AI business.

935
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:21,119
And he learned how to build

936
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:24,509
a database reactivation business

937
00:22:24,539 --> 00:22:27,920
and fucking, now what would I have

938
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:31,059
asked is, is find me anybody

939
00:22:31,069 --> 00:22:34,519
who's fucking any human at all who

940
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:37,859
sells database reactivation as

941
00:22:37,859 --> 00:22:41,680
their front end cold traffic

942
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:42,390
offer.

943
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:44,789
I want to find one fucking person

944
00:22:44,859 --> 00:22:47,250
who consistently converts cold

945
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:48,430
traffic on this

946
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:49,519
offer, right?

947
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:51,549
And the guy would have been like,

948
00:22:51,609 --> 00:22:53,660
we stumbled over the fucking words

949
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:54,559
like a retard

950
00:22:54,589 --> 00:22:56,079
because it doesn't exist.

951
00:22:56,109 --> 00:22:57,859
It's not fucking real, right?

952
00:22:57,859 --> 00:22:59,160
You need, you need to be a

953
00:22:59,160 --> 00:22:59,849
noticer,

954
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:00,549
right?

955
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:01,960
All right, cool.

956
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,299
So you can, you can click these on

957
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:05,130
your own.

958
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:06,900
Um, but let me go over this

959
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:07,180
now.

960
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:08,460
So what you might be asking, what

961
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:09,710
if there's an offer automation or

962
00:23:09,829 --> 00:23:10,339
deliverable

963
00:23:10,339 --> 00:23:11,819
that has active market demand that

964
00:23:11,819 --> 00:23:13,089
isn't taught inside of here,

965
00:23:13,089 --> 00:23:13,619
Daniel?

966
00:23:13,619 --> 00:23:13,930
Okay.

967
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:14,220
Well,

968
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:15,250
our goal with this product is to

969
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:16,259
have an astoundingly massive

970
00:23:16,259 --> 00:23:17,440
library of automations and guides

971
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:17,660
and how

972
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:18,940
to build pretty much everything

973
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:20,369
that, that everybody comes up with

974
00:23:20,369 --> 00:23:21,349
ever at all, right?

975
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:22,039
So if you come

976
00:23:22,039 --> 00:23:23,210
across something that you don't

977
00:23:23,309 --> 00:23:24,349
know how to build or you want to

978
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:25,470
help, then just tell us.

979
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:25,829
So like

980
00:23:25,849 --> 00:23:27,009
ideally submit it to Lucas and

981
00:23:27,109 --> 00:23:28,480
we'll, we'll probably make some

982
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:29,839
kind of like way for you to like

983
00:23:29,849 --> 00:23:31,319
submit it or, or some bullshit

984
00:23:31,329 --> 00:23:32,950
like that, but just, just, just

985
00:23:33,009 --> 00:23:33,490
tell us.

986
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:34,400
So, uh, and then we'll

987
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:35,579
probably just build it inside of

988
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:36,849
client sense and AI, but as far as

989
00:23:36,849 --> 00:23:38,160
conscientiousness and figure it

990
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,880
the fuck out ability goes is you

991
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,509
have full range to just go onto

992
00:23:41,509 --> 00:23:43,339
YouTube and figure out how to do

993
00:23:43,339 --> 00:23:45,069
shit yourself before we get to it,

994
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:45,559
right?

995
00:23:45,559 --> 00:23:47,299
Because that's ultimately what we

996
00:23:47,299 --> 00:23:49,359
would do anyway, right?

997
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:50,640
If you came to me and you're like,

998
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,589
Daniel, how do I do this?

999
00:23:51,789 --> 00:23:52,980
And I didn't know how to do it.

1000
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:53,119
The

1001
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:54,390
first thing I'm doing is going on

1002
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:55,710
YouTube and be like, who has done

1003
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:56,180
this?

1004
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:58,940
Or just, I would type the

1005
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,119
thing in and then I'd just fucking

1006
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:01,029
watch videos, right?

1007
00:24:01,029 --> 00:24:02,069
So that's the first step of the

1008
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:02,539
research

1009
00:24:02,549 --> 00:24:03,039
process.

1010
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:03,390
Okay.

1011
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:04,690
Let's see who else has done this

1012
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:06,140
and what info I can find about it.

1013
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:06,500
And we will

1014
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,529
start from there, right?

1015
00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:08,680
So once you have that info, we

1016
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,940
combine it with what we already

1017
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:10,180
know,

1018
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:11,660
then just try to build it out by

1019
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,289
playing around in like N8N or

1020
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:13,990
whatever.

1021
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:14,420
Okay.

1022
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:15,380
You probably heard

1023
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:16,410
this before.

1024
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:18,579
You can just do things, which is

1025
00:24:18,619 --> 00:24:19,140
true.

1026
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:21,380
You can just do things, right?

1027
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:24,190
So, so you get used

1028
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,359
to just doing things without

1029
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:26,980
permission or express instruction

1030
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:27,710
for people.

1031
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:28,849
So that, that's like a

1032
00:24:28,859 --> 00:24:29,549
degree of kind.

1033
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,920
So it's called, it's called, it's

1034
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,839
called having high agency, right?

1035
00:24:32,839 --> 00:24:33,940
Having, having,

1036
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:37,920
what's called high agency is, is

1037
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:41,500
you can just figure things out

1038
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:44,799
yourself and just do things

1039
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:50,619
without needing to be specifically

1040
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:55,039
instructed on how to do so or

1041
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:59,099
given permission to do so.

1042
00:24:59,109 --> 00:25:01,329
This is, this, this is a very

1043
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,690
important quality to have.

1044
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:05,980
You have to have high agency.

1045
00:25:06,109 --> 00:25:07,140
You need to be a

1046
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:09,250
high agency person, right?

1047
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:11,680
There, there, you can do anything

1048
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,410
you want.

1049
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:14,430
You can do any, you gotta,

1050
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,220
you gotta understand like what I

1051
00:25:16,289 --> 00:25:17,880
am to you and what everyone in

1052
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,980
this program is to you is a

1053
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:20,599
consultant.

1054
00:25:20,599 --> 00:25:22,349
And we are like, in terms of your

1055
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:23,980
life, cause you're the main

1056
00:25:24,019 --> 00:25:25,640
character of your life.

1057
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:29,680
You are, we are a tool in your

1058
00:25:29,809 --> 00:25:33,240
tool belt right now as you are in

1059
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,319
this program, right?

1060
00:25:35,619 --> 00:25:37,220
And you might use this as a tool

1061
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:38,400
for a very long time.

1062
00:25:38,549 --> 00:25:39,309
Cause you're like, wow, this is

1063
00:25:39,319 --> 00:25:40,819
super fucking useful tool, right?

1064
00:25:40,819 --> 00:25:44,380
Now, now, if, if you don't use the

1065
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:47,609
tool and you don't get results

1066
00:25:48,009 --> 00:25:49,910
from the tool, that's your fucking

1067
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:51,420
fault for not using the tool.

1068
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:53,019
Like, like a hammer, a hammer

1069
00:25:53,019 --> 00:25:54,380
fucking hammer screws, a

1070
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:56,539
screwdriver screws screws, right?

1071
00:25:56,539 --> 00:25:58,259
But a hammer, hammers nails, a

1072
00:25:58,259 --> 00:26:00,720
screwdriver screws fucking, you

1073
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,900
get what I'm saying?

1074
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,549
Like the tool, the tool does what

1075
00:26:03,799 --> 00:26:05,099
the fucking tool does.

1076
00:26:05,099 --> 00:26:06,079
If you don't use the tool, if you

1077
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:07,109
don't have like, like, you know

1078
00:26:07,109 --> 00:26:07,900
what I'm saying?

1079
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,740
Use the tool, right?

1080
00:26:09,809 --> 00:26:11,599
Have high agency.

1081
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:12,799
Like you, you, you, you, you can

1082
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:13,779
just do things, right?

1083
00:26:13,779 --> 00:26:15,539
And be a noticer, like notice

1084
00:26:15,539 --> 00:26:16,150
things.

1085
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:16,740
You get what I'm saying?

1086
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:18,339
Like, this is like, like, don't be

1087
00:26:18,339 --> 00:26:21,180
a subject of propaganda, right?

1088
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:23,170
It's like, it's like, it's like,

1089
00:26:23,269 --> 00:26:24,720
it's like, you gotta imagine

1090
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,400
there's like a, I remember being

1091
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,480
like way younger.

1092
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,769
I was maybe like 19 or 20 or

1093
00:26:28,769 --> 00:26:29,339
something.

1094
00:26:29,339 --> 00:26:30,230
And I'm like, I'm like just

1095
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:31,269
starting to get into this.

1096
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:33,099
And, and like, I was, I, I, I, I

1097
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:34,910
bought hella shit and programs and

1098
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:36,109
courses and shit.

1099
00:26:36,109 --> 00:26:37,039
Like, just like you have,

1100
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:37,539
obviously.

1101
00:26:37,539 --> 00:26:40,859
And, um, what I remember thinking,

1102
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:43,809
like, I remember there's always

1103
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:46,289
like this veil as, as, as I

1104
00:26:46,289 --> 00:26:49,130
learned more information and like

1105
00:26:49,619 --> 00:26:51,400
people told me specific things.

1106
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:52,079
things.

1107
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,039
It felt like the, there was like

1108
00:26:54,039 --> 00:26:56,009
this veil that would like slowly

1109
00:26:56,009 --> 00:26:58,049
was like lifted and I could see, I

1110
00:26:58,049 --> 00:26:59,539
could finally see.

1111
00:26:59,539 --> 00:27:01,720
And I just, I finally understood,

1112
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,180
right?

1113
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:03,599
That that's what this is over

1114
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:03,740
here.

1115
00:27:03,809 --> 00:27:05,920
Like being a noticer, right?

1116
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,880
You, you, you just, you notice

1117
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:08,420
things.

1118
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:10,579
You see, you, you observe what is

1119
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:12,079
occurring to you that is

1120
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:13,059
happening.

1121
00:27:13,059 --> 00:27:14,980
Like what people are trying to do

1122
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:15,609
to you.

1123
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:16,559
You get what I'm saying?

1124
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:17,480
Like, like,

1125
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:20,720
there's just this like second,

1126
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,799
third order level of lifting that

1127
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:25,380
like, it just, it just like peers.

1128
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,109
You, you, you, you have, you have

1129
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:27,980
to facilitate this.

1130
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:28,839
You have to notice this.

1131
00:27:28,869 --> 00:27:29,779
You have to be a noticer.

1132
00:27:29,779 --> 00:27:30,720
All right, cool.

1133
00:27:30,819 --> 00:27:31,420
Let's go to the next video.
