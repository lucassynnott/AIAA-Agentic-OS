1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,219
What's up guys, Lucas here.

2
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:02,229
So the first thing I'm going to

3
00:00:02,319 --> 00:00:03,660
show you in the AI dashboard is

4
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:05,650
going to be the AI clones

5
00:00:05,799 --> 00:00:07,320
of Daniel Fazio and Andre Heichel

6
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:07,599
Jr.

7
00:00:08,019 --> 00:00:09,789
Daniel is the go-to guy when it

8
00:00:09,789 --> 00:00:12,419
comes to cold email, offers,

9
00:00:12,419 --> 00:00:14,080
anything related to packaging

10
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:15,390
what you're selling.

11
00:00:15,779 --> 00:00:18,000
Andre is the ops king.

12
00:00:18,109 --> 00:00:19,309
Dude knows everything about

13
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:21,059
operations, fulfillment, team

14
00:00:21,059 --> 00:00:23,059
management, everything like that.

15
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,449
So if you go to chat with Daniel,

16
00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:25,929
we log in here, you're going to

17
00:00:25,929 --> 00:00:26,850
see that it's going

18
00:00:26,899 --> 00:00:28,179
to load a chat with Dan.

19
00:00:28,339 --> 00:00:29,399
One thing you can actually do is

20
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:30,379
you can actually call Dan by

21
00:00:30,379 --> 00:00:31,579
clicking the little call button

22
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:32,890
here and have a voice conversation

23
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:33,590
with him.

24
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:34,869
Even sounds just like him and you

25
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,219
can have a full conversation with

26
00:00:36,219 --> 00:00:36,619
him.

27
00:00:36,659 --> 00:00:37,539
But let's just start with like a

28
00:00:37,539 --> 00:00:38,340
common sort of issue.

29
00:00:38,439 --> 00:00:41,420
So I'm going to say like, hey Dan,

30
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:44,090
I'm running a lead generation

31
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:46,899
agency and I'm having trouble

32
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,979
signing clients.

33
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:53,299
What should I focus on?

34
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,100
We send this and we're going to

35
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:56,630
get a response from Dan.

36
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:58,270
These are trained actually on

37
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:00,039
everything Dan's ever said across

38
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:01,939
YouTube, across Slack, across

39
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:03,759
his Twitter, every source you

40
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:05,709
could possibly find for anything

41
00:01:05,719 --> 00:01:06,890
Dan's ever said.

42
00:01:06,939 --> 00:01:08,219
I believe it's over 2 million

43
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:09,989
words in total that it's actually

44
00:01:09,989 --> 00:01:10,680
trained on.

45
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:12,579
But if you look here now, you can

46
00:01:12,579 --> 00:01:13,859
see he says, all right, so you're

47
00:01:13,859 --> 00:01:14,319
running a lead generation

48
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:15,120
agency and struggling to sign

49
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:15,500
clients.

50
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:16,640
You've got to focus on three core

51
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,010
things.

52
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,209
Your offer, your outreach, and

53
00:01:18,209 --> 00:01:18,780
your volume.

54
00:01:18,819 --> 00:01:19,579
Let's break it down.

55
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,319
Your offer needs to be

56
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:20,909
bulletproof.

57
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:21,950
Your outreach needs to be dialed

58
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:22,250
in.

59
00:01:22,359 --> 00:01:23,219
Volume is the name of the game.

60
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:24,170
Define your sales process,

61
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:25,040
leverage case studies, and

62
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:25,459
results.

63
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:26,450
So it ends with what's your

64
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:27,730
current offer and outreach process

65
00:01:27,829 --> 00:01:28,459
looking like?

66
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,379
Let's dig into that.

67
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:33,099
So say my current offer is sign 10

68
00:01:33,099 --> 00:01:36,939
to 15 new clients in 30 days or

69
00:01:36,939 --> 00:01:38,659
you don't pay.

70
00:01:39,629 --> 00:01:41,489
And my outreach process is

71
00:01:41,489 --> 00:01:44,280
primarily cold email, but I don't

72
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:48,159
have a particular niche or

73
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:49,340
industry

74
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:50,680
that I focus on.

75
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:56,340
All right, so your offer's solid

76
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:56,689
in theory.

77
00:01:56,819 --> 00:01:58,120
It's bold and clear, and it's got

78
00:01:58,209 --> 00:01:59,260
a reversal baked in.

79
00:01:59,299 --> 00:01:59,790
But here's the issue.

80
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,680
That niche you're shooting in the

81
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:00,939
dark.

82
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:01,709
You're trying to be everything to

83
00:02:01,709 --> 00:02:02,079
everyone.

84
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:02,849
It's a recipe for media of

85
00:02:02,849 --> 00:02:03,280
results.

86
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:03,980
Let's fix that.

87
00:02:04,019 --> 00:02:05,290
Niche down like yesterday.

88
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:06,329
You just pick a specific industry

89
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:07,519
or type of business to focus on.

90
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,180
So it gives you full solutions on

91
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:10,659
how you refine your cultural

92
00:02:10,659 --> 00:02:11,300
process.

93
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,750
It even gives you kind of like

94
00:02:13,069 --> 00:02:15,090
suggested personalization and kind

95
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:16,439
of like structure.

96
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:17,750
It talks about volume, case

97
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,319
studies, and social proof.

98
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,479
And then the answer is, here's

99
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:21,159
your game plan.

100
00:02:21,219 --> 00:02:22,060
Pick a niche and territory or

101
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:22,520
offer to them.

102
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:23,610
Process your cold emails, scale

103
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:24,539
your outreach, build cases, back

104
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:25,490
up your claims, optimize

105
00:02:25,539 --> 00:02:26,370
your online presence to build

106
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:26,680
trust.

107
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:27,689
What niche are you leading toward?

108
00:02:27,819 --> 00:02:29,180
Let's figure that out and get you

109
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:29,900
moving.

110
00:02:29,939 --> 00:02:31,240
So as you can see, this is like

111
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:32,340
very detailed.

112
00:02:32,379 --> 00:02:33,650
You can talk to this all day and

113
00:02:33,689 --> 00:02:35,289
get like a full AI consultant from

114
00:02:35,289 --> 00:02:37,080
Dan right here, ready

115
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:37,500
to go.

116
00:02:37,539 --> 00:02:38,819
But let's have a look at the Andre

117
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:39,280
one.

118
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:40,080
So same sort of deal.

119
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,680
We've got a chat with Andre,

120
00:02:41,789 --> 00:02:43,360
trained also on all of Andre's

121
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,000
stuff.

122
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:47,780
So let's say, Andre, I'm having

123
00:02:47,889 --> 00:02:51,629
trouble with motivating one of my

124
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:53,639
team members.

125
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:56,969
What can I do to get the best

126
00:02:57,099 --> 00:02:59,860
results from them?

127
00:03:00,259 --> 00:03:06,439
Andre Colon is going to think.

128
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:07,710
Happens to all of us.

129
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:08,599
Motivation use your breaks for one

130
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:09,090
of three reasons.

131
00:03:09,219 --> 00:03:10,150
No clarity, no path, and no

132
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:10,490
stakes.

133
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,780
Here's the fast fix I use.

134
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:13,409
One, reset clarity.

135
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:14,750
Set every time this line on role,

136
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,159
top three responsibilities, and

137
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:17,080
two to three KPIs.

138
00:03:17,139 --> 00:03:18,370
Find what great looks like weekly.

139
00:03:18,419 --> 00:03:19,490
Ask directly, what are your career

140
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:20,659
goals for the next 12 months?

141
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:21,930
What do you want more of?

142
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,930
Money, responsibility, skills,

143
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:23,800
recognition, flexibility.

144
00:03:24,129 --> 00:03:25,210
Build an essential plan.

145
00:03:25,729 --> 00:03:27,360
Create near-term stakes.

146
00:03:27,469 --> 00:03:28,370
Coach and hold the line.

147
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:29,659
Recognize wins publicly.

148
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:31,370
Tell me their role, current KPIs,

149
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:32,919
what's slipping, and what they

150
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:34,240
actually care about.

151
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:35,349
I'll draft the essential plan, the

152
00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:36,430
scorecard language you use in your

153
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:37,169
next one-on-one.

154
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:38,400
So let's take a fake employee.

155
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:41,389
We're going to say they are an

156
00:03:41,389 --> 00:03:43,689
email copywriter.

157
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,129
Currently, they have to write,

158
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:53,009
let's say, 10 scripts per week

159
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:57,000
that get a 3% reply rate.

160
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:00,710
But they're not finishing their

161
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:02,319
scripts on time.

162
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:05,490
And they have said that they care

163
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:07,490
about making more money.

164
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,159
Got it.

165
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:14,639
They don't have more money,

166
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:15,169
they're missing deadlines.

167
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:16,410
Type A to output timelines and

168
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:16,920
results.

169
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:17,910
These are structured used for an

170
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:18,620
email copywriter.

171
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:19,149
Com plan.

172
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,079
Base per script.

173
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:21,089
Paper deliverables on hours.

174
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:21,959
On-time bonus.

175
00:04:22,069 --> 00:04:22,639
Late penalty.

176
00:04:23,019 --> 00:04:23,649
Performance bonus.

177
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:24,540
Attention escalator examples.

178
00:04:24,579 --> 00:04:25,060
You can paste.

179
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,370
10 scripts per week at X per

180
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:26,879
script.

181
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:28,110
First draft within five business

182
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:28,610
days of brief.

183
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,319
On-time bonus.

184
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,439
Plus $10 per script delivered on

185
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:30,639
time.

186
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:31,439
Late penalty.

187
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,810
Minus 50% of the script's pay per

188
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:33,980
late day down to zero.

189
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:34,899
Manage rhythm.

190
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,910
Weekly 15 minute 101.

191
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:37,230
One review scoreboard.

192
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,160
Remove blockers.

193
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:38,959
Confirm briefs are clear.

194
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:39,680
Public scoreboard.

195
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,689
Show scripts due to submit on time

196
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:41,459
after reply rate.

197
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:41,990
Two weeks reset.

198
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:42,990
The min's agreement is at a short

199
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:43,860
pit with daily check-ins.

200
00:04:44,149 --> 00:04:44,699
Quick question.

201
00:04:44,779 --> 00:04:45,269
So you can tell our numbers.

202
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,189
What's your current prescribed

203
00:04:46,189 --> 00:04:46,439
rate?

204
00:04:46,509 --> 00:04:47,709
Your SLI expectations in days.

205
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:48,639
And average will be volume per

206
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:49,009
client.

207
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,410
I'll plug exact figures that do a

208
00:04:50,689 --> 00:04:51,879
clean one-pager to roll out.

209
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,189
So as you can see, any potential

210
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:54,300
issues you would have with your

211
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:54,639
business,

212
00:04:54,779 --> 00:04:55,990
it can pretty much be answered by

213
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,839
Don or Andre here.

214
00:04:57,209 --> 00:04:59,529
Super, super useful tool to have.

215
00:04:59,569 --> 00:05:00,329
I guess, you know, these are

216
00:05:00,379 --> 00:05:01,139
available 24-7.

217
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:01,939
If you're part of client

218
00:05:01,939 --> 00:05:02,410
Ascension,

219
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:03,579
then obviously you can go to Don

220
00:05:03,579 --> 00:05:04,399
and Andre's calls,

221
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:05,740
but they're only once per week for

222
00:05:05,819 --> 00:05:06,360
an hour.

223
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:08,199
You can DM them as well, but, you

224
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:08,879
know, if they're human,

225
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,730
they need to sleep and they have

226
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:10,620
other responsibilities.

227
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:12,019
Whereas these are available on

228
00:05:12,329 --> 00:05:13,240
demand 24-7.

229
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:14,360
You actually call them and chat to

230
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,279
them while you're out and about,

231
00:05:15,339 --> 00:05:16,310
you know, on your AirPods, while

232
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:17,060
you're having a jog,

233
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:17,589
whatever you're doing.

234
00:05:17,709 --> 00:05:19,439
So super useful tool.

235
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,759
And something that we spend a lot

236
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:21,709
of time building out

237
00:05:21,899 --> 00:05:23,110
and developing to be as

238
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:24,939
comprehensive as possible.

239
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:26,329
So I think any of you that are

240
00:05:26,649 --> 00:05:27,680
using the dashboard

241
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:29,180
should really rely on these two.

242
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,269
I think you get a lot of great

243
00:05:30,329 --> 00:05:31,500
information out of them.

244
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,680
So see you in the next one.

245
00:05:33,019 --> 00:05:33,209
Peace.
