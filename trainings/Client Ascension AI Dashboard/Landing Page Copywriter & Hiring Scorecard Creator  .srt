these are some things here that uh

61
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:51,599
maybe i would change but that's

62
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:52,719
because i gave it very basic

63
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,840
information to start with if i

64
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,739

65
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:55,900
information about a real offer

66
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:56,299

67
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:57,549
actually running we get even

68
00:01:57,549 --> 00:01:58,989
better results and of course i was

69
00:01:58,989 --> 00:02:00,560
editing slightly as you go as well

70
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:01,819
but that is our landing page

71
00:02:01,819 --> 00:02:02,930

72
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:04,790
