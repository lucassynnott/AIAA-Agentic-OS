1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:01,600
- What's up guys, so in this one,

2
00:00:01,639 --> 00:00:03,430
I'm gonna show you our cold email

3
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:04,160
creator

4
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,139
inside the Client Ascension AI

5
00:00:06,139 --> 00:00:06,879
dashboard.

6
00:00:06,919 --> 00:00:08,259
Also going over the cold email

7
00:00:08,259 --> 00:00:09,080
script reviewer,

8
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:10,080
but obviously first let's start

9
00:00:10,119 --> 00:00:11,550
with actually writing our cold

10
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:12,400
email script.

11
00:00:12,439 --> 00:00:13,599
Now, this one is super easy.

12
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:14,720
Like all the others, it's asked

13
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:15,070
for things

14
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:16,210
like your specific offer and

15
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:16,679
service,

16
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:18,039
your target audience, background

17
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:18,960
credibility markers,

18
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,379
and campaign preferences and

19
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:20,820
goals.

20
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,260
So for this, I'm gonna give it the

21
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:22,739
same information

22
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:25,629
that I gave the sales, or I think

23
00:00:25,809 --> 00:00:27,800
I gave the VSL creator,

24
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:30,940
and we're just going to enter this

25
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:31,480
in here,

26
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:33,590
and it is going to create our cold

27
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:35,399
email sequence for us.

28
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:37,039
So as you can see, it's thinking,

29
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:38,179
and in a moment now, we're gonna

30
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:40,450
get our full email sequence.

31
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:41,759
So as you see, this is done,

32
00:00:41,799 --> 00:00:43,130
and it actually gave us an eight

33
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:44,250
step email sequence.

34
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,399
So this is based on the training

35
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:45,920
that we provide

36
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,299
inside Client Ascension from

37
00:00:47,299 --> 00:00:49,560
Christian Bonnier of ListKit,

38
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,759
and all of our cold email training

39
00:00:51,799 --> 00:00:53,299
that we've got hundreds of hours

40
00:00:53,299 --> 00:00:53,619
worth of

41
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:54,799
in there at this stage.

42
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,159
So see, obviously the more kind

43
00:00:57,159 --> 00:00:57,689
of, you know,

44
00:00:57,759 --> 00:00:58,679
the information you give this,

45
00:00:58,719 --> 00:00:59,820
the better the scripts will be.

46
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,280
So for instance, this first email

47
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:01,399
is,

48
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:02,539
hey, first name, or the one in the

49
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:02,880
table,

50
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,019
their existing email subscribers

51
00:01:04,109 --> 00:01:05,280
at company name.

52
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:06,510
We guarantee a 30% revenue

53
00:01:06,519 --> 00:01:06,750
increase

54
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:07,280
from your marketing.

55
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:08,680
That means you don't pay a cent.

56
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:09,719
Just help with a $50 million

57
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:10,280
skincare brand

58
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:11,719
at 180K monthly for the existing

59
00:01:11,769 --> 00:01:12,599
50K subscribers

60
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,579
through proper segmentation and

61
00:01:13,579 --> 00:01:13,959
automation.

62
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,849
One of a set of a free audit

63
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,019
of your current email setup.

64
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,239
So obviously we didn't actually

65
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:17,260
help

66
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:18,959
with a $50 million skincare brand.

67
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
That's the information that,

68
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,219
when it asks us for kind of

69
00:01:22,219 --> 00:01:23,409
credibility

70
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,480
and any kind of background

71
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:24,750
information

72
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:25,560
we want to provide for it.

73
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:26,439
So case studies and things are

74
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:26,700
important

75
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,439
to get in there too.

76
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,840
But still a very, very good start.

77
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:32,700
We go through eight emails in

78
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,120
total.

79
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:34,260
Finally finishing up with moving

80
00:01:34,349 --> 00:01:35,480
on from company name.

81
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:36,280
Also reaching out with the email

82
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:36,890
marketing opportunity

83
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:37,959
for company name.

84
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,909
If you ever want to see how much

85
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:39,040
revenue

86
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:39,840
you might be missing from your

87
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,519
existing subscribers,

88
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,519
just apply to this email.

89
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,599
We'll be here when you're ready to

90
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:42,840
explore

91
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:44,670
a 3% increase guarantee.

92
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:46,439
So we get a full ASAP sequence

93
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:47,359
fully written for us

94
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,079
in seconds, just based off the

95
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:49,760
basic information

96
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:51,359
that we gave it.

97
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,560
So now if we go to the email

98
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,560
review bot,

99
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:56,280
we're going to paste the sequence

100
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:56,879
in here.

101
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,459
We're going to get a review of

102
00:01:58,459 --> 00:01:59,719
this sequence

103
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:01,090
that hopefully will improve it

104
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:01,799
even further.

105
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,209
So need some context to give you

106
00:02:05,409 --> 00:02:06,200
the most valuable feedback,

107
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:07,939
which target audience of the

108
00:02:07,939 --> 00:02:08,560
sequence,

109
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:09,900
blah, blah, blah, all this stuff

110
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:10,240
here.

111
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,889
So already it says that the eight

112
00:02:13,889 --> 00:02:14,120
emails

113
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:15,979
are actually too long.

114
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:18,080
Five emails maximum is good.

115
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,520
We're being too repetitive.

116
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,490
Subject lines are weak and

117
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:20,840
generic.

118
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:21,680
Don't proper personalizations.

119
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:22,560
Cut down these five emails with

120
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:23,159
four-day, three-day,

121
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:24,840
five-day, 21-day delays.

122
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,199
Fair your messaging and CTAs.

123
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,159
Make your subject lines puncture

124
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:28,479
and more specific.

125
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,919
Add real personalization.

126
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,270
Focus each email on one specific

127
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:31,560
angle

128
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:32,400
instead of repeating the same

129
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:32,840
guarantee.

130
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:33,800
It's strong, weird to beat people

131
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,599
over the head with it.

132
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:35,629
Use the strategy to give you three

133
00:02:35,629 --> 00:02:36,560
emails, not all of them.

134
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:37,389
Once you give more context for

135
00:02:37,389 --> 00:02:38,120
your audience and goals,

136
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:39,000
provide a specific right to the

137
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:39,680
proper five emails

138
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:40,819
so you can structurally perform

139
00:02:40,909 --> 00:02:41,439
much better.

140
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:43,159
So what's your target market?

141
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:44,590
Let's say target market.

142
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:49,289
Ecom brands doing five to 20

143
00:02:49,289 --> 00:02:51,229
million per year.

144
00:02:51,979 --> 00:02:58,610
Current results, say like 4% open

145
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:03,139
rate, 1% reply rate.

146
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,400
So we're getting some actual

147
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:12,069
specific things, but not just the

148
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,080
cold emails themselves, but

149
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,949
deliverability.

150
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:16,370
Messaging problems, audience

151
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:16,960
mismatch.

152
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,960
Here's a new strategy.

153
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,389
Go to five emails, maximum proper

154
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:19,960
delays.

155
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,960
Show a bigger case.

156
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,849
Let me rewrite this as a proper

157
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:22,520
email sequence.

158
00:03:23,139 --> 00:03:30,270
So we got a full sequence being

159
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:36,240
written for us here now.

160
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,240
Even tells us when to wait.

161
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:45,889
Let's focus on the iOS attribution

162
00:03:45,889 --> 00:03:49,889
side of things.

163
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,960
So there we go.

164
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,270
So now we've got the key changes

165
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:53,680
made.

166
00:03:53,719 --> 00:03:55,120
We've got spam, trigger words, and

167
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:55,680
guarantees from subject lines.

168
00:03:55,719 --> 00:03:57,680
Use industry specific pain points.

169
00:03:57,719 --> 00:03:58,319
Included bigger, more relevant

170
00:03:58,379 --> 00:03:58,680
case studies.

171
00:03:58,719 --> 00:03:59,680
Vary the CTAs.

172
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:01,539
Add a proper virtualization hooks

173
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:01,800
for their product launches.

174
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,819
Focus on problems specific to

175
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:03,659
their revenue range.

176
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:04,819
Cut from eight emails to five or

177
00:04:04,909 --> 00:04:05,680
proper delays.

178
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:06,430
But each email serve a different

179
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:07,310
purpose instead of repeating the

180
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:07,680
same offer.

181
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:09,020
This has got much better

182
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:10,800
durability and response rates

183
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,759
because it sounds like industry

184
00:04:11,889 --> 00:04:12,319
expertise

185
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,569
rather than generic marketing

186
00:04:13,569 --> 00:04:14,080
pitches.

187
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,159
Now, most of those could have been

188
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:15,860
solved if I gave it more

189
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:16,920
information in the beginning

190
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,699
cold email sequence writing

191
00:04:18,699 --> 00:04:19,420
section.

192
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,569
But again, I just kind of gave it

193
00:04:20,569 --> 00:04:21,670
just a basic one I've been using

194
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:22,519
for a few of these.

195
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,459
So the more information you give

196
00:04:23,459 --> 00:04:24,589
about your actual real offer, the

197
00:04:24,589 --> 00:04:25,350
better results you're

198
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:26,360
going to get.

199
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:27,970
But as you can see, this is a

200
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:29,740
great job of fixing this up and

201
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,800
rewriting it even better.

202
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:33,199
And this is something that we can

203
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:37,029
customize even further and, you

204
00:04:37,029 --> 00:04:37,519
know, kind of really

205
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,279
hone down and especially combined

206
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,670
with our mass personalizer

207
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:42,560
workflow that we have inside

208
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,610
later on in the course under the

209
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:46,490
lead gen agency section will

210
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:47,839
really create some great campaigns

211
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:49,920
that should do really well.

212
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:51,009
And of course, your client

213
00:04:51,009 --> 00:04:52,250
extension, you will get three

214
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,680
different, I believe three, maybe

215
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,329
even four different cold email

216
00:04:55,329 --> 00:04:57,089
calls every single week where with

217
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:58,529

218
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,970
go in detail on what's working

219
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:01,699

00:05:01,699 --> 00:05:03,360

222
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,699

223
00:05:06,699 --> 00:05:08,399
maximum deliverability.

224
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:10,430

225
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:12,670
