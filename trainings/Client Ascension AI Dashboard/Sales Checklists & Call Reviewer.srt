to these questions here based on

20
00:00:31,429 --> 00:00:32,719
the offer we talked about earlier

21
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:34,240

mindset

29
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,590
and frame preparation the research

30
00:00:46,979 --> 00:00:48,850
requirements the opening and

31
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:50,859
disqualification uh gives us kind

32
00:00:50,899 --> 00:00:52,109
of the step-by-step of what we

33
00:00:52,409 --> 00:00:53,399
should do on the call in order to

34
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:54,859

a bit so we're going to have this

38
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,170
run and then i'll go back through

39
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:00,840
it when it's finished

40
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,600
okay so as you can see this is

preparation position is the email

45
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:10,439
expert is not a service provider

46
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,489
maintain outcome independence

47
00:01:11,489 --> 00:01:12,680
you're evaluating them too most of

48
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:13,700
your first privacy three

49
00:01:13,739 --> 00:01:14,810

results as you qualify for your

52
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,640

results actually take the time

54
00:01:20,349 --> 00:01:21,859
today and are running x million

55
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,049
first bank is too busy acknowledge

56
00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:23,640
their growth and recent

57
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,750
achievements and discovering

58
00:01:25,329 --> 00:01:25,359
research

59
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,459
before we dive in we go forward to

60
00:01:26,459 --> 00:01:27,549
a new work with browns to at least

61
00:01:27,549 --> 00:01:28,879
two million our process requires

62
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,079
full access to email platform

63
00:01:30,469 --> 00:01:31,480
customer data we guarantee 32

64
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,840
revenue in nine days so that means

65
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:34,010
following our own our proven

66
00:01:34,359 --> 00:01:34,620
process exactly

67
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:38,069
then you look at buying propensity

68
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:39,750
indicators we'll strive for you to

69
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:40,400
look at email marketing

70
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:41,480
improvements right now how much

71
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,599
current revenue comes from email

72
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:43,959
marketing authority identification

73
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,969
who else would be involved in a

74
00:01:44,969 --> 00:01:45,980
decision like this when you made

75
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:46,719
marketing investments

76
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,189
100k plus annually before what's

77
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:49,439
the difficult decision process

78
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,000
then the pain point discovery

79
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,560
this is going to take by 15 to 20

80
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:53,519
minutes but for problem

81
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:55,000
identification revenue leakage

82
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,390
look at

83
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:56,409
your emails with ex-subscribers

84
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:57,180
what do you think each subscriber

85
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:58,280
should be worth monthly

86
00:01:58,319 --> 00:01:59,750
uh implication questions revenue

87
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,170
impacts if you're leaving an extra

88
00:02:01,219 --> 00:02:02,420
month at the table with email

89
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:03,370
what do you have different email

90
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:04,319
charges for customers to spend 50

91
00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:05,840
just 500 these are all

92
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:07,370
detailed questions you're going to

93
00:02:07,459 --> 00:02:08,580
ask in order to uh get the most

94
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:09,599
out of the sales call

95
00:02:09,659 --> 00:02:10,550
finally we've got the three

96
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:11,520
pillars pitch which is about two

97
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,460
to three minutes long

98
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,930
uh pillar one is the revenue audit

99
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,349
and foundation the first thing we

100
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,150
do is conduct a

101
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,120
comprehensive revenue audio

102
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,469
recording email performance uh the

103
00:02:18,469 --> 00:02:19,780
tie down is does having

104
00:02:19,819 --> 00:02:20,810
that clear picture of your revenue

105
00:02:21,289 --> 00:02:21,680
opportunities make sense as a

106
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,400
starting point

107
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:23,610
then they'll say yes you say

108
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,210
performance campaign execution

109
00:02:25,219 --> 00:02:26,719
then we have our proven campaign

110
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:27,120
system

111
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,310
uh can you see how having those

112
00:02:28,659 --> 00:02:29,039
systems running automatically

113
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:30,620
would free routine to time

114
00:02:30,659 --> 00:02:32,250
while driving more revenue they'll

115
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,620
say yes finally we continuously

116
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:34,620
optimize performance using

117
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:34,939
advanced

118
00:02:34,979 --> 00:02:36,300
analytics and testing scaling what

119
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:37,580
works and limiting what doesn't

120
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:38,599
tie down makes sense that

121
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:39,530
ongoing optimization would be

122
00:02:39,539 --> 00:02:40,439
crucial for the same results right

123
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:41,490
they'll say yes

124
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,050
then we do some objection

125
00:02:43,139 --> 00:02:44,949
prevention then we close with a

126
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:45,780
pre-priced

127
00:02:45,819 --> 00:02:47,560
tie down price delivery approach

128
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,360
next step process the frame

129
00:02:49,699 --> 00:02:50,169
management is how you're going to

130
00:02:50,229 --> 00:02:50,479
conduct

131
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,919
yourself on the call the power

132
00:02:52,099 --> 00:02:53,530
response they say we need to think

133
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:54,659
about it i understand

134
00:02:54,699 --> 00:02:56,039
what specifically need to think

135
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,560
through the investment the process

136
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:58,159
the results

137
00:02:58,199 --> 00:02:59,069
most successful brands make

138
00:02:59,069 --> 00:03:00,090
decisions quickly when they see it

139
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:01,210
clear about the guarantee results

140
00:03:01,259 --> 00:03:02,530
was holding you back uh if they

141
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:04,050
say it's not the right time i'm

142
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:05,319
curious but it would be the right

143
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,610
time to add excellent revenue to

144
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:07,770
your business quality frame

145
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:08,960
response they say we can find

146
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,069
cheaper options you're absolutely

147
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:10,789

00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:15,479
traditional sales call like i said

192
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:16,279

discovery

194
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,120
