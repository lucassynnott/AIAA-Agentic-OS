What's up guys so in this one

2
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:02,080
we're going to be going over the

3
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,830
vsl script creator and reviewer

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,459
uh to do this we're going to be

5
00:00:06,459 --> 00:00:08,320
taking our previous offer that we

6
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:09,710
created using the offer

7
00:00:09,859 --> 00:00:11,359
creation and offer review module

8
00:00:11,369 --> 00:00:12,789
and we're going to add a little

9
00:00:12,789 --> 00:00:14,300
bit more information in order to

10
00:00:14,419 --> 00:00:16,530
get a decent vsl script so we're

11
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:18,670
going to do a new chat and we are

12
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:20,460
going to paste in the previous

13
00:00:20,579 --> 00:00:22,250
offer that we got from our offer

14
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:24,129
creator but let's add a bit more

15
00:00:24,129 --> 00:00:25,960
information so the promises

16
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:28,589
in there the problems in there uh

17
00:00:28,589 --> 00:00:30,789
the desired situation uh say

18
00:00:31,269 --> 00:00:33,960
desired situation is uh increased

19
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:39,409
revenue uh from uh let's see let's

20
00:00:39,409 --> 00:00:42,320
just say from email plus

21
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,119
conversion rates uh what is the

22
00:00:46,119 --> 00:00:47,020
usp and usp

23
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:51,820
details usp is uh our retention

24
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:57,560
revenue system usp details uh 90

25
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:02,100
day uh fast track to generating

26
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,519
more revenue from email lists

27
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:12,200
reasons to believe so strong case

28
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:15,739
studies last brand generated we'll

29
00:01:15,859 --> 00:01:20,109
just say 150k extra revenue from

30
00:01:20,109 --> 00:01:24,540
existing email list within 30 days

31
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:33,810
30 days and sales argument is just

32
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:39,700
uh we generate uh more money from

33
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:44,790
existing uh contacts without

34
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:47,890
any added effort on brand owners

35
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:50,810
part so i was going to hit send on

36
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,219
this and this is now going to

37
00:01:52,219 --> 00:01:52,459
start

38
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:54,700
writing our vsl so it's going to

39
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,849
go to the whole vsl i will uh let

40
00:01:56,849 --> 00:01:58,700
it run for a little bit and then

41
00:01:58,700 --> 00:01:58,780
we're

42
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,739
going to go back and i will uh

43
00:02:00,739 --> 00:02:03,049
just quickly run through what we

44
00:02:03,049 --> 00:02:04,739
got out of it and then we'll

45
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,659
send it to our reviewer so scroll

46
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:09,610
up here it's actually a pretty

47
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:11,800
long vsl but if we take a look

48
00:02:11,939 --> 00:02:13,110
and say uh if you're an e-commerce

49
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:14,280
brand owner sitting on an email

50
00:02:14,349 --> 00:02:16,139
list of 10 000 subscribers or

51
00:02:16,259 --> 00:02:17,169
more and you're not generating at

52
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,259
least 30 percent of your total

53
00:02:18,259 --> 00:02:19,169
revenue from email you're

54
00:02:19,189 --> 00:02:19,580
literally

55
00:02:19,699 --> 00:02:20,729
leaving hundreds of thousand

56
00:02:20,729 --> 00:02:21,960
dollars at the table every single

57
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,020
month listen i know you didn't

58
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:23,180
build

59
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,050
your business to watch money slip

60
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:24,949
through your fingers you're going

61
00:02:24,949 --> 00:02:25,900
to create freedom security

62
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,280
the life you actually want there's

63
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,280
a brutal truth most email

64
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,900
marketing agencies won't tell you

65
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:30,939
your current email setup is

66
00:02:30,949 --> 00:02:32,180
probably costing you more money

67
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,419
than it's making you i'm talking

68
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:33,580
to the

69
00:02:33,699 --> 00:02:34,699
ambitious e-commerce owners who

70
00:02:34,699 --> 00:02:35,780
are tired of being slaves of paid

71
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:36,939
traffic the ones who know there's

72
00:02:36,939 --> 00:02:36,939
a

73
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:37,729
goal on seeing their emails

74
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,699
because i've figured out how to

75
00:02:38,699 --> 00:02:39,659
extract it if you've got all these

76
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:39,780
10

77
00:02:39,939 --> 00:02:40,699
subscribers you're ready to stop

78
00:02:40,699 --> 00:02:41,530
throwing money at facebook and

79
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:42,620
google just to break even then

80
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:42,849
what

81
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:43,819
i'm about to share could be the

82
00:02:43,819 --> 00:02:44,909
most profitable evidence you'll

83
00:02:44,909 --> 00:02:45,319
ever spend

84
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:47,590
so that's beginning let's take

85
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:49,219
this now and we're just going to

86
00:02:49,289 --> 00:02:51,500
copy and paste this to our

87
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,060
reviewer

88
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:53,939
so let's go over to vsl script

89
00:02:53,939 --> 00:02:56,889
review chat we're going to paste

90
00:02:57,370 --> 00:02:59,659
this in we're going to hit enter

91
00:02:59,659 --> 00:02:59,740
and

92
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:01,620
we're going to see what uh we get

93
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,669
overall assessment the script is

94
00:03:03,669 --> 00:03:05,340
strong bones with excellent pain

95
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:06,840
point identification a compelling

96
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,139
case study but it cuts off worth

97
00:03:08,139 --> 00:03:09,340
crucial call to action and lacks

98
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:09,569
clear

99
00:03:09,699 --> 00:03:10,870
pricing details script search for

100
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:12,039
review book analysis the opening

101
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,259

senior email list uh so it gives a

104
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:17,830
full analysis of each section of

105
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:18,060
it

106
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:20,520
and improvements to what we can do

107
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:22,599
give us an implementation

108
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:24,439
checklist conversion optimization

109
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,610
recommendations um and uh then

110
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:28,610
what we can do to make it better

111
00:03:28,669 --> 00:03:30,139
next so it says conversion

112
00:03:30,259 --> 00:03:31,150
optimization recommendation add

113
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:32,050
scarcity and urgency elements

114
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:32,990

studies insert pricing investment

132
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:53,560
uh information before the

133
00:03:53,669 --> 00:03:54,939

134
00:03:54,939 --> 00:03:55,180

00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,060
mechanism name and explanation add

136
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,810
urgency almost throughout and as

137
00:03:58,810 --> 00:03:59,819
finally as with the financial

138
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:00,729
script is solid with excellent

139
00:04:00,729 --> 00:04:01,800
problem identification emotional

140
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,620
hooks focusing completing the

141
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:02,939
closed

142
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,340
adding this conversion almost to

143
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:05,879
trends to a high converting vsl so

144
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,330
you can see we've got the basis

145
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:09,069
or vsl written within seconds you

146
00:04:09,069 --> 00:04:10,750
know that took us like literally

147
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,240
just pacing in our offer and we

148
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:12,439
got

149
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:13,960
out something really really solid

150
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,169
and uh now we can use this to go

151
00:04:15,169 --> 00:04:16,540
forward and kind of actually

152
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:16,850
develop

153
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,360
this and add our own kind of you

154
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,620
know twists and our own uh

155
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,250
personalization to it based on

156
00:04:21,259 --> 00:04:21,759
also the

157
00:04:21,939 --> 00:04:24,199
the suggestions we're getting uh

158
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,139
here in the uh uh vsl script

159
00:04:26,139 --> 00:04:28,939
reviewer so again this takes what

160
00:04:28,939 --> 00:04:29,100
