1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:00,840
What's up, guys?

2
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:01,260
Lucas here.

3
00:00:01,429 --> 00:00:02,200
In this video, I'm going to be

4
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:03,459
showing you guys the Client

5
00:00:03,459 --> 00:00:04,940
Ascension AI dashboard.

6
00:00:05,059 --> 00:00:06,500
Now, I should note that some of

7
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:08,099
you will have access to this and

8
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:08,939
some of you may not.

9
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:10,349
If you just purchased the course

10
00:00:10,609 --> 00:00:12,320
version of this whole program,

11
00:00:12,439 --> 00:00:13,949
then you unfortunately will not

12
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:14,939
have access to this

13
00:00:15,099 --> 00:00:16,329
because this costs time and money

14
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:17,500
to maintain and develop.

15
00:00:17,629 --> 00:00:19,539
So unfortunately, you won't have

16
00:00:19,539 --> 00:00:20,199
access.

17
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,609
Now, if you are on the standard

18
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:23,210
tier, you will have access.

19
00:00:23,449 --> 00:00:24,710
If you'd like to upgrade to the

20
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:25,530
standard tier,

21
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:27,530
you can reach out to the SSC that

22
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:29,579
gave you your onboarding call

23
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:31,350
or you can email me directly at

24
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:33,399
Lucas at ClientAscension.com

25
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:34,399
to talk about upgrading and

26
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:35,490
getting access to the Client

27
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:36,409
Ascension AI dashboard.

28
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:37,960
So I'm going to explain what the

29
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:39,780
Client Ascension AI dashboard is,

30
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:41,509
what it does, and how you can use

31
00:00:41,509 --> 00:00:41,899
it.

32
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:43,289
And then in a few other modules,

33
00:00:43,289 --> 00:00:44,670
we're going through using it in

34
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:44,909
depth

35
00:00:45,109 --> 00:00:46,380
and showing you exactly how to get

36
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:47,270
the most out of it.

37
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,100
So if you take a look here, as you

38
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:49,649
can see,

39
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:51,109
at the first section here, we have

40
00:00:51,369 --> 00:00:51,759
quick actions

41
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:52,859
and then we have AI business

42
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:53,170
tools.

43
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:54,729
Quick actions are some of the most

44
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:56,210
popular features that we have

45
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:57,359
that people want access to

46
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:58,079
immediately.

47
00:00:59,289 --> 00:01:00,460
And AI business tools is all the

48
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:01,369
features that we have

49
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:02,479
so that you can see everything

50
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:03,140
that's there.

51
00:01:03,259 --> 00:01:05,390
But I'm going to start off by

52
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:05,719
going through

53
00:01:05,849 --> 00:01:06,819
what I think is the most important

54
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:07,700
part of all of this,

55
00:01:08,129 --> 00:01:10,579
which is the JSON context profile.

56
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:11,680
This will be used across all of

57
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:12,980
the other tools that you use.

58
00:01:13,099 --> 00:01:14,079
And I'll be going into depth in

59
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:15,170
depth on that in a moment.

60
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:16,599
But for now, let's take a look at

61
00:01:16,849 --> 00:01:17,980
the slide right here.

62
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:19,400
We've got dashboard, my content,

63
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:21,159
progress, CEO dashboard,

64
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:22,980
growth calculator, CRM, and

65
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:23,959
resources.

66
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:24,780
Now, I've been dashboard is

67
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:25,540
obviously just for me.

68
00:01:25,629 --> 00:01:26,760
We won't be looking at that.

69
00:01:27,099 --> 00:01:28,810
But essentially, the way that this

70
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:29,170
works

71
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,530
is that when you create content

72
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:31,489
using the dashboard,

73
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,969
you can save it to your my content

74
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:33,659
section

75
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:34,939
where you can review it later,

76
00:01:34,939 --> 00:01:35,969
copy it, edit it,

77
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:37,120
and overall keep track of what

78
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:38,159
you've been working on.

79
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,760
The progress dashboard is actually

80
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:42,170
the entire client ascension course

81
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:43,000
broken down.

82
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,920
And you can use it to track your

83
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,340
progress through the course

84
00:01:46,469 --> 00:01:48,159
as you complete modules and take

85
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:49,560
them off going down.

86
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,969
So if you go here, and if I click

87
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:51,560
that,

88
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,739
you can see we're in progress, two

89
00:01:52,849 --> 00:01:53,760
of eight tasks, et cetera,

90
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:55,319
and I can mark the whole thing as

91
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:56,019
complete.

92
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:58,579
The CEO dashboard is something we

93
00:01:58,579 --> 00:01:59,780
teach inside client ascension.

94
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,420
And it's a way to track all of

95
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:03,079
your metrics across your business

96
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:04,359
in order just for you to get a

97
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:05,359
good idea of where you're

98
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:05,840
currently at

99
00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:06,939
and how close to your KPIs and

100
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,300
goals you currently are.

101
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:09,719
So you can choose the metrics you

102
00:02:09,969 --> 00:02:10,580
want to track,

103
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:11,680
and that will actually build out

104
00:02:11,789 --> 00:02:12,400
your dashboard.

105
00:02:12,689 --> 00:02:13,580
So for now I'm just going to

106
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:14,419
select all of them.

107
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:16,500
And I fill these out.

108
00:02:16,539 --> 00:02:17,599
I'm going to add a bunch of random

109
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:18,560
numbers now in a moment.

110
00:02:18,689 --> 00:02:20,650
In the next step, we're going to

111
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:22,099
add a monthly target.

112
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:25,180
Just for a few of these, we'll do

113
00:02:25,259 --> 00:02:25,919
all of them.

114
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,080
I'm just hitting random numbers

115
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:28,680
here.

116
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,280
All right.

117
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:32,240
So create dashboard.

118
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,060
You can see here now we've got all

119
00:02:34,139 --> 00:02:35,870
of these different details here.

120
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:37,310
So when we want to track that

121
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,280
we've updated,

122
00:02:38,409 --> 00:02:40,419
so let me say weekly, week one,

123
00:02:40,419 --> 00:02:41,289
we've done 500,

124
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,379
save updates, week two,

125
00:02:44,509 --> 00:02:47,389
for cash collected, that much.

126
00:02:47,659 --> 00:02:49,699
And this helps us to track our

127
00:02:49,699 --> 00:02:50,979
progress weekly.

128
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:52,750
We add new weekly entries each

129
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,289
time to see where we're currently

130
00:02:54,289 --> 00:02:54,580
at.

131
00:02:54,699 --> 00:02:57,810
So that's a really useful tool as

132
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:58,860
you're kind of building your

133
00:02:58,860 --> 00:02:59,280
business,

134
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,060
keeping track of everything,

135
00:03:00,189 --> 00:03:01,460
and you can generate reports from

136
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,580
this as well and save it for

137
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:03,069
later.

138
00:03:03,189 --> 00:03:04,330
So let's take a look at our growth

139
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:05,180
calculator here.

140
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,280
This here is the client ascension

141
00:03:06,389 --> 00:03:07,199
growth calculator.

142
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:08,280
This is where you define your

143
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,340
wildly important goal.

144
00:03:09,849 --> 00:03:11,389
You'll see your core metrics, your

145
00:03:11,389 --> 00:03:12,319
lead generation,

146
00:03:12,449 --> 00:03:13,099
your sales conversions,

147
00:03:13,219 --> 00:03:13,780
your scenarios,

148
00:03:13,909 --> 00:03:15,189
and all of this will give you a

149
00:03:15,449 --> 00:03:17,409
kind of outline of where you're

150
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:17,979
currently at

151
00:03:18,099 --> 00:03:19,610
and what you need to do in the

152
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:22,949
next kind of a timeframe in order

153
00:03:22,949 --> 00:03:23,979
to reach the goals that you've set

154
00:03:23,979 --> 00:03:24,219
out.

155
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,319
So you can see that your target

156
00:03:25,419 --> 00:03:25,599
MRR,

157
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:26,379
your current one,

158
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:27,080
your deadline.

159
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:27,849
It'll kind of tell you what you

160
00:03:27,849 --> 00:03:28,199
need to do.

161
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:29,199
What is your realistic,

162
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:29,759
your aggressive,

163
00:03:29,889 --> 00:03:30,599
your conservative kind of

164
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:31,120
estimates.

165
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,180
And afterwards,

166
00:03:32,289 --> 00:03:33,180
you can save that to your content

167
00:03:33,189 --> 00:03:33,580
as well.

168
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:35,400
We do have a CRM built in here

169
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:36,750
where you can actually track your

170
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,520
different deals throughout the

171
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:38,879
pipeline.

172
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,319
You can move these across and see

173
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:42,259
where you're currently at.

174
00:03:42,379 --> 00:03:45,080
You can edit the different users.

175
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,080
You can actually call the leads or

176
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,370
send emails directly from the

177
00:03:47,469 --> 00:03:48,090
dashboard here,

178
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:48,699
add notes,

179
00:03:48,819 --> 00:03:49,460
things like that.

180
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:51,319
But let's start off with that

181
00:03:51,389 --> 00:03:52,180
section I talked about,

182
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:53,439
the JSON context profile.

183
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:53,639
Now,

184
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:55,030
JSON context profile basically

185
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:56,520
provides information about your

186
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,719
business to every other module

187
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,439
that you're going to use

188
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,259
throughout the dashboard.

189
00:04:01,389 --> 00:04:02,669
So if I click this here,

190
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:03,840
you'll see there's going to be a

191
00:04:03,949 --> 00:04:04,560
form we fill out.

192
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:05,870
And this is going to be a 20

193
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:06,680
question form.

194
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,650
Where you're going to input what

195
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:08,659
is the name of your business.

196
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:09,159
For now,

197
00:04:09,189 --> 00:04:10,150
I'm going to write tests and I'll

198
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,300
show you a real one afterwards.

199
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:13,460
Do you have a slogan or a tagline?

200
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:14,520
When was it founded?

201
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:15,879
These are all just interview

202
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:17,529
questions about your business.

203
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:18,579
These are clients internationally.

204
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,180
What does your business do?

205
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,470
What is your mission or big

206
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:22,300
picture goal?

207
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:23,139
All these sort of things

208
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,019
throughout here.

209
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:24,720
Now,

210
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:25,819
after you fill all this out,

211
00:04:25,949 --> 00:04:27,060
you're going to end up with a

212
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,709
context profile similar to this.

213
00:04:28,899 --> 00:04:30,829
And you essentially can copy this

214
00:04:30,829 --> 00:04:32,600
and paste it into any one of the

215
00:04:32,709 --> 00:04:34,519
other chats in order to give it

216
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:35,860
information and context about who

217
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,019
you are and what you do.

218
00:04:37,149 --> 00:04:38,639
So each time that you're,

219
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:38,819
say,

220
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,120
you know,

221
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,129
creating a VSL script or you're

222
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:44,639
writing cold emails,

223
00:04:44,769 --> 00:04:46,029
you don't have to remind the AI

224
00:04:46,029 --> 00:04:47,519
every single time in detail what

225
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:48,050
you do.

226
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:48,699
You just go,

227
00:04:48,829 --> 00:04:49,639
here's my business context

228
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:50,040
profile,

229
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:50,800
paste it in,

230
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,550
and then it knows exactly what you

231
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:52,899
do.

232
00:04:53,339 --> 00:04:55,050
So that's the kind of initial

233
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:56,439
overview of the dashboard.

234
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,399
In the next video,

235
00:04:57,449 --> 00:04:58,810
I'm going to be going through each

236
00:04:58,949 --> 00:04:59,689
of the business tools

237
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:00,579
individually,

238
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:01,420
explaining what they are,

239
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:01,980
how they work,

240
00:05:02,129 --> 00:05:03,250
and how you can get the most out

241
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:03,740
of them.

242
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:04,680
See you in the next one.

243
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:05,240
Peace.
