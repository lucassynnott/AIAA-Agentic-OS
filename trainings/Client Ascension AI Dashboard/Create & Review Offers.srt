5
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,089
in the previous video that we had

6
00:00:07,179 --> 00:00:08,720

everything involved so uh it

14
00:00:18,859 --> 00:00:20,449
requires a bit of less going back

15
00:00:20,449 --> 00:00:22,410

right so i'm going to put that in

26
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:42,159

00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:55,200
might be

35
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,880
a little harsh at times um so it's

36
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,520
going to then end up writing the

37
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,240
whole thing for me so we're going

38
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,450
to run all the way through and

39
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:02,700

00:01:04,359 --> 00:01:07,799
a moment okay so this is done so

43
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:12,560

52
00:01:25,989 --> 00:01:27,250
uplift that's not an offer that's

53
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:28,000
wishful thinking

54
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:28,920
call traffic needs specific

56
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:31,040
your outreach you're targeting the

57
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:32,280
wrong segment shopify brands doing

58
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,549
50 plus per month is way too broad

59
00:01:33,549 --> 00:01:34,310
you need to get specific

60
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:35,439
about who within that range and

61
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:36,480
what's the problem you solve

62
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,200
here's what you do

63
00:01:37,379 --> 00:01:38,269

period position is a hybrid offer

85
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:09,030
don't make this pure retainer make

86
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,419
it a 90-day intensive option to

87
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:12,000
continue monthly this removes the

88
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:13,180
subscription resistance i talk

89
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:14,439
about in my training pricing eight

90
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:15,680
thousand dollars for nine days and

91
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,030
two thousand dollars a month they

92
00:02:17,229 --> 00:02:18,419
want to continue step four get

93
00:02:18,419 --> 00:02:19,759
case studies immediately your

94
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:20,080
average

95
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:21,419
strategy is the dream 100 approach

96
00:02:21,419 --> 00:02:22,430
find a hundred shopify brands in

97
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:23,780
your chosen niche doing 50 200k

98
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:24,759

showing exactly what's wrong with

100
00:02:25,789 --> 00:02:26,879
their current email setup and how

101
00:02:26,889 --> 00:02:27,039
you'd

102
00:02:27,229 --> 00:02:28,389
fix it even gives me a script

103
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:29,969
content strategy and uh your

104
00:02:29,979 --> 00:02:31,840
current offers will get you maybe

105
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,060
five

106
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:33,060
ticket per month if you're lucky

107
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,199
this position gets you to 100k

108
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:35,199
plus because you have a bigger

109
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:35,349
problem

110
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:37,569
with a clear guarantee so very

111
00:02:37,669 --> 00:02:40,069
detailed response right really

112
00:02:40,069 --> 00:02:42,400
really good so let's take that

113
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:42,719
offer

114
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,009
section that uh it came up with

115
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:47,590
there so uh offer what you get and

116
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:50,400
simulations so actually we'll

117
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:50,800
include this

118
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:53,330
position as a hybrid offer and

119
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:55,930
let's go back to the offer review

120
00:02:56,289 --> 00:02:58,610
module we're going to go here and

121
00:02:58,750 --> 00:02:58,960
do a

122
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:01,080
new chat and we're going to paste

123
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,039
this in here we're going to see

124
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:05,039
what the offer review which is

125
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:05,199
also

126
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:06,550
trained on daniel's information

127
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:07,789
has to say about that this is

128
00:03:07,789 --> 00:03:09,280
solid our foundation needs some

129
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:09,729
refinement

130
00:03:09,949 --> 00:03:11,259
what's working your guarantee is

131
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:12,699
strong uh the hyperstructure is

132
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:13,840
exactly right what needs

133
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,240
improvement

134
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:16,289
your value proposition lacks a uh

135
00:03:16,289 --> 00:03:18,340
so that component you're telling

136
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:20,080
them what to do but not why they

137
00:03:20,349 --> 00:03:21,270
desperately need it your position

138
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:22,289
is better we guarantee increase

139
00:03:22,389 --> 00:03:23,349
your own revenue by at least

140
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,530
24 in 90 days let's finish writing

out uh through a retention revenue

142
00:03:30,969 --> 00:03:32,000
system so that you can reduce

143
00:03:32,189 --> 00:03:33,349
your customer acquisition uh costs

144
00:03:33,539 --> 00:03:34,770
and stop leading money on paid ads

145
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:36,479
and get more expensive every month

146
00:03:36,669 --> 00:03:37,539
ideal client profile target

147
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,419
e-commerce brands 100k to 500k per

148
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:41,439
month uh talk after brands 150k a

149
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:41,610
month

150
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:43,599
gives you some lead magnet ideas a

151
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,280
launch strategy and positioning

152
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,210
improvement turn of offer

153
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:48,530
consideration this doesn't convert

154
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:49,490
well instead of having to email

155
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:50,639
revenue recovery specifically

156
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:51,469
targeting brands who had good

157
00:03:51,539 --> 00:03:52,360
email revenue that dropped off

158
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,280
this creates more urgency and

159
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:53,840
demand

160
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:54,669
your offer strong bones the

161
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:55,629
guarantee price and structure

162
00:03:55,629 --> 00:03:56,639
intervals are solid focus on

163
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:56,780
improving

164
00:03:56,919 --> 00:03:57,610
the positioning of vibe

165
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:58,590
proposition then launch a dream

166
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:00,000
100 outreach using free audits to

167
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,240
do service

168
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:01,590
based the magnet so that's

169
00:04:01,819 --> 00:04:03,650
essentially how this works you can

170
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:05,199
easily create both your offer and

171
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:05,379
then

172
00:04:05,659 --> 00:04:06,639
review it using our offer review

173
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:07,800
uh of course you already have an

174
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,120
existing offer just go directly to

175
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:10,229
offer review but if you're just

176
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,490
starting out obviously go to offer

177
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:12,719
creation uh you don't

178
00:04:12,909 --> 00:04:14,069
have to give it the json business

179
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,430
context profile although i do

180
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:16,879
recommend it you can just you know

181
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:17,990
talk to it back and forth and tell

182
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,069
it kind of what you want to do and

183
00:04:19,069 --> 00:04:20,149
what you've been doing in the

184
00:04:20,379 --> 00:04:21,910
past maybe or how you think you

185
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:23,649
could uh kind of get started on

186
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,759
something but overall uh you know

187
00:04:25,949 --> 00:04:26,740
this is going to give you a

188
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,079
structured output for how you can

189
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:29,759
set up your offer and we'll help

190
00:04:29,949 --> 00:04:31,439
you then with the rest of your uh

191
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:33,240
content creation such as your vsl

192
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:34,879
your sales checklist all that sort

193
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:34,899
of

194
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:36,129
stuff so this is just one of the

195
00:04:36,129 --> 00:04:37,170
modules that we or two of the

196
00:04:37,269 --> 00:04:38,399
modules say that we have in here

197
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:38,639

00:04:38,889 --> 00:04:40,509
review and offer creation and uh

199
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,490
both are service kind of the basis

200
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,000

201
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,350
to do throughout the course so uh

202
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,910
if you're using client extension

203
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,319

204
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,569
the business context profile

205
00:04:49,569 --> 00:04:50,870
followed by the offer creation

206
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:52,160
