1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,860
So guys, Lucas here.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,850
So today we'll be showing you how

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,259
to import N8M workflows into your

4
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:08,019
own N8M workspace.

5
00:00:08,019 --> 00:00:09,199
This is very important for you

6
00:00:09,199 --> 00:00:10,320
guys as part of this course,

7
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,439
because we've developed a

8
00:00:11,859 --> 00:00:12,980
number of automations and

9
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:14,730
workflows to handle with your

10
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:16,649
operations and your fulfillment

11
00:00:16,769 --> 00:00:17,260
for

12
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:18,660
your clients.

13
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:19,719
So this is going to be the key

14
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,160
thing you're going to be doing.

15
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,179
Now, there's a few ways to import

16
00:00:22,179 --> 00:00:23,210
workflows, but I'm going to show

17
00:00:23,219 --> 00:00:23,960
you just the easiest

18
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:24,960
one.

19
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:25,879
So this is one of the YouTube

20
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:26,809
creator workflows that we've

21
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:27,320
created.

22
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,910
This is a YouTube script writer

23
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:30,500
and first I'm going to download

24
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,500
this workflow.

25
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,090
To do that, I'm going to click

26
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:34,759
these three buttons up here and

27
00:00:34,759 --> 00:00:36,119
just click download.

28
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:37,969
When I do that, you'll see here

29
00:00:38,119 --> 00:00:39,979
I've downloaded a JSON file, a

30
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:40,899
JSON file.

31
00:00:40,899 --> 00:00:42,740
Now when I want to import this

32
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:44,670
into a new N8M instance, I'll

33
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:47,780
click the plus button, workflow,

34
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:49,210
create in personal, or if I go

35
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:50,700
back to my personal one here and

36
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:52,420
click create workflow, it opens

37
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:53,960
a new workflow.

38
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,329
Now these ways to do it is just to

39
00:00:56,329 --> 00:00:58,140
do import from file.

40
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,950
So we'll open the file selector,

41
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:01,859
double click your JSON file, and

42
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:02,759
there we go.

43
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:03,759
Now it's imported.

44
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:06,560
Now you will see a bunch of red

45
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,540
nodes.

46
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:08,540
nodes.

47
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:09,719
And the reason for that is that

48
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:11,060
you have not created the accounts

49
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:11,719
for these.

50
00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:13,319
So you'll have to double click and

51
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:15,079
you have to modify it, you have to

52
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:16,219
add your account or

53
00:01:16,219 --> 00:01:17,989
maybe whoever you send the message

54
00:01:17,989 --> 00:01:18,340
to.

55
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:20,930
And you'll also probably see it on

56
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:23,719
your, the AI agent chat models.

57
00:01:23,719 --> 00:01:25,579
You'll have to modify these with

58
00:01:26,019 --> 00:01:28,359
your correct accounts, et cetera,

59
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,900
and get it all set up.

60
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:31,200
Now we walk through, I had to do

61
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,400
that a little bit in one of the

62
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,680
previous modules, but just

63
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,969
to go over it again, just like I

64
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:35,519
did there.

65
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:37,379
Say for instance, it is the slack

66
00:01:37,819 --> 00:01:40,159
notification, you'll double click

67
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,019
the node and you probably

68
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:43,739
won't have a credential here.

69
00:01:43,739 --> 00:01:45,209
And so you'll do create new

70
00:01:45,209 --> 00:01:46,159
credential.

71
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:46,879
And then you'll connect with

72
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:47,150
slack.

73
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:48,159
You just use a lot.

74
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:50,019
So you connect my account and then

75
00:01:50,349 --> 00:01:52,170
it will bring you to log into your

76
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:53,519
slack workspace.

77
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:54,560
You'll do that.

78
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,870
And then it will have your account

79
00:01:55,879 --> 00:01:56,340
in here.

80
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,189
I already have my account here.

81
00:01:58,219 --> 00:01:59,260
So I'm good.

82
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:00,969
She was that one there and you'll

83
00:02:00,969 --> 00:02:02,469
have to select you to send the

84
00:02:02,469 --> 00:02:03,859
message to see it select from

85
00:02:03,859 --> 00:02:04,859
the list again.

86
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:06,609
I can select, say you want to have

87
00:02:06,609 --> 00:02:08,340
it in a particular, there's just

88
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,500
for now as a user, but we can do

89
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,689
it from a channel where you can

90
00:02:10,689 --> 00:02:12,009
have like all the YouTube scripts

91
00:02:12,009 --> 00:02:12,599
approved.

92
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:15,770
And I type in my name here, give

93
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:17,240
it a moment.

94
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:18,780
We've got a lot of slack users.

95
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:19,780
There's Lucas.

96
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:20,780
I select that.

97
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,629
And then now that's all set up and

98
00:02:22,949 --> 00:02:23,370
good to go.

99
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:24,539
And you do this for any of the

100
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:25,719
ones that are showing up as red

101
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:26,819
again, like I said, as well,

102
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:28,669
your, your open router nodes will

103
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,590
probably not be connected properly

104
00:02:30,729 --> 00:02:31,060
too.

105
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:32,560
So you'll double click this.

106
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,409
You will add a new open writer

107
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:35,150
account.

108
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,129
And do that by getting your API

109
00:02:37,139 --> 00:02:39,460
key from the open writer website.

110
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:40,990
to do that, you just go to open

111
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,360
router, I'm going to sign in.

112
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:49,780
And now when I go to, uh, keys up

113
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:52,099
here, there we go.

114
00:02:52,099 --> 00:02:53,889
There's my editing key, but you

115
00:02:53,889 --> 00:02:55,810
create API key, it'll give you the

116
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:56,280
API key.

117
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,819
And then you just paste it in

118
00:02:57,819 --> 00:02:59,300
there and you are done.

119
00:02:59,979 --> 00:03:01,830
So I can leave this as well and

120
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,659
that's all you got to do.

121
00:03:03,659 --> 00:03:04,479
So you have to just connect up any

122
00:03:04,539 --> 00:03:05,180
of the accounts that are not

123
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:05,509
connected.

124
00:03:05,659 --> 00:03:06,379
You have to connect up.

125
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,550
And after that, you're ready to go

126
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:10,360
and your workflow will be live.

127
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:11,719
You just make sure you always

128
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:12,460
click save.

129
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,289
The NNN does not automatically

130
00:03:14,289 --> 00:03:16,460
save these when you make changes.

131
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:17,469
So after you make the changes,

132
00:03:17,469 --> 00:03:17,979
click save.

133
00:03:17,979 --> 00:03:18,939
This is very important.

134
00:03:18,939 --> 00:03:20,780
I've lost a few workflows because

135
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:22,050
I've built them out, forgotten to

136
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:22,719
click save and left.

137
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,639
So make sure you do that.

138
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:27,819
If it's a workflow that's going to

139
00:03:27,819 --> 00:03:28,949
be getting information from

140
00:03:28,949 --> 00:03:29,979
somewhere else, for instance,

141
00:03:29,979 --> 00:03:31,770
from a webhook or from, you know,

142
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:33,370
uh, triggered on a schedule or

143
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:34,780
anything like that, make sure

144
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,379
you have set it to active as well.

145
00:03:36,379 --> 00:03:37,979
Uh, that way, uh, I'd say for on

146
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,419
form submission, anytime, when

147
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:40,300
you're finished with it, set it to

148
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,530
active so that when you submit a

149
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:42,819
form or you get information from

150
00:03:42,819 --> 00:03:44,560
wherever, uh, it all comes

151
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:45,629
through correctly and it

152
00:03:45,629 --> 00:03:47,099
automatically flows and works.

153
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:48,699
Uh, we will be going over this

154
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:50,539
specific automation later on in

155
00:03:50,539 --> 00:03:51,020
the course, right?

156
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:52,139
Break down exactly what it does

157
00:03:52,139 --> 00:03:53,419
and how it works, but this is to

158
00:03:53,419 --> 00:03:54,620
show you how to import workflows.

159
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:56,479
Uh, another method you can do just

160
00:03:56,919 --> 00:03:57,979
delete this for now.

161
00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:00,710
When you will often find any

162
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:02,449
templates online, you can import

163
00:04:02,449 --> 00:04:03,659
them the exact same way,

164
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:05,520
but you can also just open this

165
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,300
with, uh, your text editor, open

166
00:04:08,419 --> 00:04:09,500
the JSON file that you've

167
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:11,360
downloaded and you can copy the

168
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,699
whole thing.

169
00:04:12,699 --> 00:04:14,259
Just control a or command a

170
00:04:14,259 --> 00:04:17,540
command C and command V and paste

171
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:17,740
it in.

172
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:18,939
And you get the exact same thing.

173
00:04:18,939 --> 00:04:21,430
Uh, if you are using, for

174
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:22,519
instance, a tool like Claude to

175
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:23,579
help you build your workflows,

176
00:04:23,579 --> 00:04:24,620
which we'll talk about a bit, a

177
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:26,589
bit as well, uh, this will do the,

178
00:04:26,589 --> 00:04:28,139
uh, you'll get them, uh,

179
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:29,660
output as text within Claude.

180
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:30,980
You can just copy it, paste it and

181
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:32,220
you're good to go.

182
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,779
Let's briefly look at what if we

183
00:04:33,779 --> 00:04:35,069
want to modify this a bit more

184
00:04:35,069 --> 00:04:36,220
than it currently is.

185
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:38,079
So we're only ones we should be

186
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:40,139
modifying are probably the script

187
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:40,939
writer agents,

188
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:42,250
depending on how you want your

189
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:43,180
scripts written.

190
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:45,029
You can see here how this is, uh,

191
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,759
this is set up that it says your

192
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:47,540
professional script writer

193
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,060
specializing in this category, uh,

194
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:51,829
the content strategy, the target

195
00:04:51,829 --> 00:04:52,459
audience.

196
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:53,470
We give it all the information

197
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:55,009
from the other AI agents so that

198
00:04:55,009 --> 00:04:56,720
it knows what to do.

199
00:04:56,779 --> 00:04:58,629
But, uh, say we just want to

200
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:00,220
change a, you can obviously modify

201
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:01,040
all the system messages and

202
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:01,980
things in here.

203
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:03,829
Uh, this one tells it, you know,

204
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:05,980
how it, uh, acts as a YouTube

205
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:06,939
script writer,

206
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:08,230
but we can make these more

207
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:10,139
detailed depending on, uh, you

208
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:10,860
know, the particular

209
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,060
format you want your super script,

210
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,100
YouTube script to written in.

211
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,399
Well, let's say we want to send

212
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:15,689
this, uh, information somewhere

213
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:16,050
else.

214
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,569
So we don't want this for

215
00:05:17,569 --> 00:05:19,350
instance, to say, be sent to

216
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:20,420
client in an email.

217
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:23,100
We can delete this directly, uh,

218
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,310
or we can choose a different email

219
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:24,930
service.

220
00:05:24,939 --> 00:05:26,470
Let's say we want to use Gmail

221
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:27,180
instead.

222
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:29,339
We'll just go to Gmail.

223
00:05:29,339 --> 00:05:31,899
Uh, we would do send a message.

224
00:05:31,899 --> 00:05:34,269
And here you can then set up your

225
00:05:34,269 --> 00:05:35,339
credentials.

226
00:05:35,339 --> 00:05:36,790
As we talked about, you do create

227
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:37,579
new credential,

228
00:05:37,579 --> 00:05:38,879
sign in with Google and connect up

229
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:39,439
your account.

230
00:05:39,579 --> 00:05:41,430
Uh, we're not going to do that

231
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,579
right now, but, uh, you'll put

232
00:05:43,579 --> 00:05:45,100
clients email in here.

233
00:05:45,579 --> 00:05:47,279
And then you would, uh, set the

234
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:48,379
subjects, you know, new, you

235
00:05:48,379 --> 00:05:49,579
described it delivered.

236
00:05:49,579 --> 00:05:51,310
And from the message, we would

237
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:54,220
send exactly what we have in here.

238
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,850
It'd be the subjects would be

239
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:56,889
copied from here.

240
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:58,500
Email format will be taken from

241
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:58,790
here.

242
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,529
Uh, then you can delete this

243
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:02,060
again.

244
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,920
So that message is being sent via

245
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:05,980
Gmail, uh, to the client.

246
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:08,319
So now let's say that, uh, you're

247
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:09,259
not using Slack for your

248
00:06:09,259 --> 00:06:09,899
organization.

249
00:06:09,899 --> 00:06:11,759
You are using, uh, they're doing

250
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:14,160
everything via telegram, right?

251
00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:16,560
So you could do telegram and then

252
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,660
you could do, uh, send a chat.

253
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:22,300
Let me go find it.

254
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:22,939
Just move my camera.

255
00:06:22,939 --> 00:06:26,459
Uh, send a text message.

256
00:06:26,459 --> 00:06:28,699
And here you set up your telegram

257
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:29,259
bot.

258
00:06:29,259 --> 00:06:30,139
Like we showed in one of the

259
00:06:30,259 --> 00:06:32,060
earlier, uh, uh, videos.

260
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:33,930
And the, the child ID would also

261
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,860
come from that bot chat and the

262
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:37,180
text.

263
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,740
Then you would just take what we

264
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:39,660
have in Slack.

265
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:43,639
So we take this and we go back to

266
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:45,899
send a text message.

267
00:06:45,899 --> 00:06:47,899
It says expression.

268
00:06:47,899 --> 00:06:49,750
And there we go.

269
00:06:49,819 --> 00:06:50,980
So now we will have a message

270
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:51,680
saying, you know, script

271
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:53,579
delivered, uh, the client name,

272
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:54,720
the category, the email, the dry

273
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,339
folder, script doc, uh, the

274
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:58,699
follow-up scheduled and delivery

275
00:06:58,699 --> 00:06:59,100
ID.

276
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,509
And then, uh, now when we can

277
00:07:01,509 --> 00:07:03,740
delete the Slack, then when we're

278
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:04,620
done with that now,

279
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,379
the, uh, once the whole thing is

280
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:08,779
created, we will send the message

281
00:07:08,779 --> 00:07:09,660
via Gmail to the client.

282
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:10,709
And then we'll send it to a

283
00:07:10,709 --> 00:07:12,779
telegram message to ourselves to,

284
00:07:12,779 --> 00:07:13,420
uh, say, you know,

285
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:14,480
that it's a, it's good to go and

286
00:07:14,529 --> 00:07:15,899
that it's ready, ready and done.

287
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,100
So those are just a few ways to

288
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,149
modify some of the existing

289
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,879
workflows that we, that we have.

290
00:07:19,899 --> 00:07:20,680
Uh, again, it's really about

291
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:21,500
importing the ones that we have.

292
00:07:21,579 --> 00:07:22,600
You're gonna have to do some

293
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,439
modification around mainly

294
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:24,170
accounts.

295
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,410
Most of them should be pretty much

296
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:26,459
set up exact as they are.

297
00:07:26,459 --> 00:07:27,670
You should generally follow the

298
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:29,009
structure that we suggest for the,

299
00:07:29,009 --> 00:07:29,980
uh, business setup.

300
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:29,980
So like Slack for, uh, client

301
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:29,980
communication and management, um,

302
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:35,560
is a pretty key one.

303
00:07:35,579 --> 00:07:35,579
So, uh, hopefully this was helpful

304
00:07:35,579 --> 00:07:35,579
and, uh, we will be just going

305
00:07:35,579 --> 00:07:41,230
through some places

306
00:07:41,259 --> 00:07:43,009
to find some resources for

307
00:07:43,009 --> 00:07:45,040
workflows in the next video.

308
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,699
And then you guys are going to

309
00:07:46,709 --> 00:07:48,379
move on to learning a bit about

310
00:07:48,379 --> 00:07:50,750
poppy AI and then choosing

311
00:07:50,779 --> 00:07:52,079
your agency that you're going to

312
00:07:52,149 --> 00:07:52,860
be creating.

313
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:53,800
And then we'll get into the

314
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:54,939
workflows for all of those.

315
00:07:54,939 --> 00:07:56,449
So hopefully, uh, you guys are

316
00:07:56,449 --> 00:07:57,980
getting through the course.

317
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:58,220
Okay.

318
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:59,819
So far, any problems as well, feel

319
00:07:59,899 --> 00:08:01,509
free to message me or post in

320
00:08:01,509 --> 00:08:02,139
Slack.

321
00:08:02,139 --> 00:08:03,259
See you guys the next one.

322
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,220
Peace.
