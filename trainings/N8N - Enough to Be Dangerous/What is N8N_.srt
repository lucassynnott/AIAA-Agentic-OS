1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,060
What's up guys, Lucas here, I'm

2
00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:03,680
the head of AI at Client Ascension

3
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:04,080
and I'm going to be

4
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,419
one of the main people you're

5
00:00:05,419 --> 00:00:06,980
going to be seeing throughout this

6
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:07,599
course.

7
00:00:07,599 --> 00:00:09,009
This video we're just going to go

8
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:10,179
over the basics of the main

9
00:00:10,179 --> 00:00:11,359
automation tool you'll

10
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:13,359
be using to help roll in your AI

11
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:14,779
assisted agency.

12
00:00:14,779 --> 00:00:17,329
And that automation tool is called

13
00:00:17,329 --> 00:00:17,820
N8N.

14
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,179
So what is N8N?

15
00:00:19,179 --> 00:00:20,410
It's an open source workflow

16
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:21,780
automation tool designed with

17
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:23,239
flexibility and extensibility

18
00:00:23,239 --> 00:00:24,239
at its core.

19
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:25,370
Some of the features has

20
00:00:25,379 --> 00:00:27,100
connections to 200+ apps and

21
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,699
services with custom logic, a

22
00:00:28,699 --> 00:00:29,059
choice

23
00:00:29,059 --> 00:00:30,190
between self-hosting or cloud

24
00:00:30,289 --> 00:00:30,899
deployment.

25
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:32,679
There's a video later on where I

26
00:00:32,679 --> 00:00:34,549
show you how to self-host this for

27
00:00:34,549 --> 00:00:35,829
cheap and gives you complete

28
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,189
control over data and environment

29
00:00:37,189 --> 00:00:38,479
as well as allowing you to execute

30
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:39,850
JavaScript code inside

31
00:00:39,859 --> 00:00:42,000
of workflows.

32
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,840
That's one of the reasons that we

33
00:00:43,969 --> 00:00:45,359
chose this for your main

34
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:46,640
automation tool.

35
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,659
It's extremely flexible and as

36
00:00:48,659 --> 00:00:50,649
you'll see as well, it has a ton

37
00:00:50,649 --> 00:00:52,280
of template ability allowing

38
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:54,189
us to give you templates you can

39
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,700
use to run your agency.

40
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:56,890
So the core capabilities are a

41
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,119
visual workflow builder.

42
00:00:58,119 --> 00:00:59,530
I'm going to show you what that

43
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,920
looks like in one moment.

44
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,149
Essentially, it's a visual

45
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:03,609
interface that allows you to kind

46
00:01:03,609 --> 00:01:04,890
of, you know, see exactly

47
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,379
how the automation works and make

48
00:01:06,379 --> 00:01:07,799
edits very quickly and easily.

49
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:08,799
JavaScript integration, as

50
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:09,890
previously mentioned, you can run

51
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:11,540
JavaScript directly inside of

52
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:12,540
N8N.

53
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:13,640
Flexible triggers, multiple

54
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,739
different types of triggers to

55
00:01:14,739 --> 00:01:16,209
actually kick off your workflow,

56
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,379
whether that's based on a

57
00:01:17,469 --> 00:01:18,920
schedule, based on an action in

58
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,799
another app, a message response,

59
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:21,920
something like that.

60
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,049
And extensive integrations

61
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:24,719
connects to over 200 plus.

62
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:26,959
As 200 plus people know, it

63
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:29,120
connects to pretty much any API or

64
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,689
app you can think of.

65
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:31,829
So I'm just going to show you

66
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:33,200
briefly what N8N looks like.

67
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,769
And this is using one of the N8N

68
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,609
workflow templates that's actually

69
00:01:36,609 --> 00:01:37,849
provided inside of the app.

70
00:01:37,859 --> 00:01:38,640
I didn't create this.

71
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,129
This is created by N8N as an

72
00:01:41,129 --> 00:01:43,319
example of an AI agent.

73
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:46,120
This is a voice assistant agent.

74
00:01:46,709 --> 00:01:49,239
Essentially, it allows you to send

75
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:52,090
a voice message to Telegram, to a

76
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,680
Telegram bot.

77
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,760
And then it will, based on your

78
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,180
message, do things such as respond

79
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:59,989
to you, like if you're talking

80
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,840
to ChatGPT or it can even schedule

81
00:02:01,849 --> 00:02:03,250
your or get events for your

82
00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:05,040
calendar and tell you what a

83
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:05,180
couple

84
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:05,959
of events are.

85
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:07,670
So I'll just break down briefly

86
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:09,520
how this is and what this does.

87
00:02:09,659 --> 00:02:10,990
As I mentioned before, a trigger

88
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:11,939
is the first thing.

89
00:02:11,939 --> 00:02:14,159
The trigger in this workflow is a

90
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:16,379
message to the Telegram bot.

91
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:17,520
That's what starts the workflow

92
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:18,039
working.

93
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:20,169
The next thing we have here is an

94
00:02:20,169 --> 00:02:20,939
if node.

95
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,689
So this checks if the message is

96
00:02:23,689 --> 00:02:25,099
audio or not.

97
00:02:25,099 --> 00:02:26,909
If it is audio, it then gets the

98
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:28,620
audio file from Telegram.

99
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,610
Then it transcribes it using

100
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:32,830
ChatGPT and then sends it to your

101
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:34,259
assistant agent.

102
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,500
If it's not audio, it seems it

103
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,180
just sets the field.

104
00:02:38,379 --> 00:02:40,219
So it takes the text and just adds

105
00:02:40,349 --> 00:02:42,219
it here as this little text node

106
00:02:42,219 --> 00:02:43,360
and then sends it

107
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,490
to the assistant agent.

108
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,629
The assistant agent, you've

109
00:02:45,729 --> 00:02:47,000
probably heard the word AI agents

110
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,930
thrown around a lot.

111
00:02:47,979 --> 00:02:50,099
An AI agent essentially is just an

112
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:51,759
AI that has been given very

113
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:53,539
specific rules and access

114
00:02:53,539 --> 00:02:54,180
to tools.

115
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:56,030
So tools are what really kind of

116
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:57,610
separate AI agents.

117
00:02:57,659 --> 00:02:59,240
When they have access to things

118
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,870
like your Google Calendar, then

119
00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:02,500
they can, AI agent can perform

120
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,159
tasks with your Google Calendar.

121
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,490
This one, if we double click into

122
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:08,229
this, you can see that it was, the

123
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:10,240
user message is coming

124
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,020
from Telegram.

125
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:12,430
And then the system message tells

126
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:13,439
it how it should act.

127
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:14,449
So it gives it a bunch of rules on

128
00:03:14,449 --> 00:03:15,159
how it should act.

129
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:16,189
You're a helpful personal AI

130
00:03:16,189 --> 00:03:16,729
assistant.

131
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:17,780
In the case, you use it through

132
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:18,240
Telegram.

133
00:03:18,259 --> 00:03:19,250
You handle all text and voice

134
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:19,759
messages.

135
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:20,699
And you have access to user's

136
00:03:20,699 --> 00:03:21,610
email and calendar to provide

137
00:03:21,729 --> 00:03:22,659
comprehensive assistance.

138
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:24,060
And then it just gives it kind of

139
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,469
a bunch of different kind of rules

140
00:03:25,469 --> 00:03:26,189
it should follow

141
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:26,699
in general.

142
00:03:26,699 --> 00:03:27,830
So tool usage guidelines, how the

143
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:28,990
email tool should work, how the

144
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:29,819
calendar tool should

145
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:30,080
work.

146
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,539
Gives it context to awareness.

147
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:33,379
Remember the current date and time

148
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:34,639
today is now and now.

149
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:36,430
User information provide relevant

150
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:37,439
time responses.

151
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:38,509
Reference today, tomorrow, this

152
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:39,240
week appropriately.

153
00:03:39,259 --> 00:03:42,090
So an example of a kind of a

154
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:43,219
query.

155
00:03:43,219 --> 00:03:44,719
User, any important emails today?

156
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:46,120
Let me check your recent emails.

157
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:47,689
Users get emails tool.

158
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:48,800
Same for the calendar.

159
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,370
So this is just kind of an example

160
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:52,039
of having it.

161
00:03:52,039 --> 00:03:53,169
And then at the end, it then

162
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:54,550
replies back in Telegram with the

163
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:55,819
response from the AI agent.

164
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:57,669
So this is just showing you kind

165
00:03:57,789 --> 00:03:59,490
of what the NN kind of workflow

166
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,009
builder looks like.

167
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:03,039
Adding more nodes is simply the

168
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:04,439
plus button here.

169
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:05,939
And then you can either choose

170
00:04:05,939 --> 00:04:07,340
from different AI tools.

171
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:09,370
Or if you look at actions in the

172
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:11,500
app, we can see the different

173
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,090
softwares that NN has pre-built

174
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,020
nodes for.

175
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,730
We'll be going into a lot more

176
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:18,819
detail on how to use NN later on.

177
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:19,569
But for now, we're just going to

178
00:04:19,569 --> 00:04:19,990
go over what is NN.

179
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:21,180
This is NN.

180
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:23,689
So again, we look here at the

181
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:26,810
advantage of using NN versus other

182
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:27,910
platforms.

183
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:29,990
No vendor lock-in.

184
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,319
So NN is an open source tool,

185
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:32,740
meaning that, you know, it's

186
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:33,670
harder for them to remove access

187
00:04:33,699 --> 00:04:34,360
to certain things.

188
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,610
You've always got kind of control

189
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:36,720
over what version of NN you're

190
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,180
using.

191
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:38,959
Cost and privacy control.

192
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:41,290
Self-hosting significantly reduces

193
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:42,930
the cost for a, you know,

194
00:04:42,939 --> 00:04:43,629
someone's going to be using

195
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:45,860
a lot of executions or workflows.

196
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,680
There's a very active community

197
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,220
behind NN and there's a ton of

198
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:51,569
existing workflows and

199
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,959
templates out there pre-built.

200
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,319
Now, you're going to get access to

201
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:55,459
the ones you need inside this

202
00:04:55,459 --> 00:04:56,519
course, but there are

203
00:04:56,519 --> 00:04:58,009
a ton of websites that, you know,

204
00:04:58,009 --> 00:04:59,360
will give you examples of other

205
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,740
workflows you can import.

206
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:01,870
And I have a video later on going

207
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:02,529
over that.

208
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:06,569
And yeah, very open about its

209
00:05:06,579 --> 00:05:08,410
billing and the costs and real

210
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:09,430
hidden fees.

211
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:10,699
You're not going to, you know,

212
00:05:10,699 --> 00:05:12,089
really run a workflow and suddenly

213
00:05:12,089 --> 00:05:13,100
get a massive bill out

214
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,100
knowing that, you know, you got a

215
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:14,800
ton of executions.

216
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,589
It's pretty straightforward.

217
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,040
So you have probably used some

218
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,800
other automation tools before.

219
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,459
Most likely you've used Zapier.

220
00:05:21,459 --> 00:05:22,720
I think that pretty much everyone

221
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,970
that runs some sort of agencies at

222
00:05:24,009 --> 00:05:25,060
some point set up a Zap.

223
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:27,639
Zapier has a massive ecosystem.

224
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,529
Definitely, I think of all of

225
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:30,819
these, it has the most app

226
00:05:30,949 --> 00:05:31,980
integrations.

227
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:34,139
I've come across softwares that

228
00:05:34,149 --> 00:05:36,240
have no API access, but they do

229
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,360
have Zapier integrations.

230
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:40,839
It's very user-friendly setup.

231
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:41,939
You don't really need much

232
00:05:41,939 --> 00:05:42,990
technical knowledge.

233
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,850
It's a proprietary platform with

234
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:46,889
cloud-only deployment, and it has

235
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:48,240
limited advanced logic

236
00:05:48,699 --> 00:05:48,819
capabilities.

237
00:05:48,819 --> 00:05:50,120
So as you can see here, the main

238
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,569
challenges that agencies face are

239
00:05:51,569 --> 00:05:52,620
pricing scales rapidly

240
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:53,399
with task volume.

241
00:05:53,459 --> 00:05:55,300
It could cost thousands monthly

242
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:57,310
for busy agencies, but it's very

243
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:58,850
simple and easy to use.

244
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:00,470
Definitely very good for kind of

245
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:01,990
one to three-step kind of, you

246
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:03,240
know, simple, straightforward

247
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:05,279
things, you know, like, I don't

248
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:07,389
know, when a calendar event, when

249
00:06:07,389 --> 00:06:08,819
a calendar event is booked,

250
00:06:08,939 --> 00:06:10,279
send a message in Slack, you know,

251
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:11,699
things like that are very simple.

252
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:12,829
You can do that just as easily in

253
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:14,300
N8N, but for a lot of people, they

254
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,040
find Zapier kind

255
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:15,680
of easier to follow.

256
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,069
Then the other one you've probably

257
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,079
seen is Make.com.

258
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:19,930
Now, Make.com is definitely more

259
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:21,509
advanced than Zapier and can do a

260
00:06:21,569 --> 00:06:22,589
lot of the things that

261
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,449
you can do in N8N, but I find N8N

262
00:06:24,569 --> 00:06:26,029
to be an easier kind of tool to

263
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:27,269
get started with.

264
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,279
But Make.com, as you can see here,

265
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:30,730
positions itself as a middle

266
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,300
ground between simplicity

267
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:32,720
and power.

268
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,629
It does have a lot of app

269
00:06:33,629 --> 00:06:35,300
integrations, 2,500 plus app

270
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,149
integrations.

271
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:38,009
It is definitely more advanced

272
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:39,680
routing capabilities than Zapier.

273
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,250
It does have an kind of AI

274
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:43,850
integration, but I find that N8N's

275
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:45,319
AI agents tend to be a bit

276
00:06:45,689 --> 00:06:46,709
easier to set up and easier to

277
00:06:46,709 --> 00:06:48,240
understand and also Make is still

278
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:49,959
cloud-based with no self-hosting

279
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:50,339
option.

280
00:06:50,339 --> 00:06:52,019
They do have a free plan, but that

281
00:06:52,019 --> 00:06:53,550
has execution limitations.

282
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:54,949
So if you do want to kind of learn

283
00:06:54,949 --> 00:06:56,519
a bit about Make.com, definitely

284
00:06:56,649 --> 00:06:57,660
very easy to get started.

285
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:00,459
But N8N's kind of customization

286
00:07:00,459 --> 00:07:03,170
capabilities and the ease of use I

287
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:05,360
find about N8N still beats

288
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,139
out Make.com.

289
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,480
You can see here a little graph

290
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,060
head-to-head, N8N versus Zapier

291
00:07:09,189 --> 00:07:10,040
and Make.com.

292
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,120
High openness, low integrations,

293
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,129
open and customizable is N8N.

294
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,600
This is where it really excels.

295
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,180
But Zapier has got high

296
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:19,800
integrations and high openness.

297
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,300
Wide integrations and easy, Zapier

298
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:21,920
for sure.

299
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:23,389
Balance features, Make.com is

300
00:07:23,389 --> 00:07:24,519
middle ground between low

301
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:26,100
integrations and low openness.

302
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,600
And then cost-effective and data

303
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:29,279
control, high integrations, low

304
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,610
openness is N8N again.

305
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:33,329
N8N is really just the easiest one

306
00:07:33,329 --> 00:07:35,930
to get started with, I think, and

307
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,819
is the most powerful when

308
00:07:37,819 --> 00:07:38,600
you're using it in the long run.

309
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,810
You will find as you are going

310
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:41,449
through these workflows and you're

311
00:07:41,449 --> 00:07:42,519
using the templates we

312
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:44,509
build and you're probably starting

313
00:07:44,509 --> 00:07:46,189
to maybe create some of your own

314
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:47,620
that you start to think

315
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:48,680
in N8N nodes.

316
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,160
It becomes very easy to see kind

317
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,579
of how you will connect the next

318
00:07:51,709 --> 00:07:53,160
thing or, you know, maybe

319
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:56,040
you use something like ClickUp or

320
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,720
instead of say Slack and you can

321
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,879
figure, it's very easy

322
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,009
to see how you would, you know,

323
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:03,240
instead switch out a Slack node

324
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,550
for a ClickUp node and what

325
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:05,970
that looks like, and it's like

326
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:07,230
kind of has branching kind of

327
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:08,500
capabilities, I find.

328
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,240
So again, why you should choose

329
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,930
N8N, basically the workflow

330
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:13,120
templates, I think, are the

331
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:13,279
biggest

332
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:14,420
one because every workflow

333
00:08:14,509 --> 00:08:15,790
template that you're going to use

334
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:17,790
in this course is an N8N template.

335
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:19,470
It's very easy to customize

336
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:21,410
workflows to match exact client

337
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:22,899
requirements rather than forcing

338
00:08:22,899 --> 00:08:23,680
clients out of platform

339
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,259
limitations.

340
00:08:24,259 --> 00:08:25,829
Cost control at scale, you can

341
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,350
avoid escalating costs with

342
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:29,379
limited self-hosting executions.

343
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:32,139
You can connect the legacy or

344
00:08:32,139 --> 00:08:33,899
niche tools via their API using

345
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:34,980
custom nodes.

346
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:35,759
Very simple to do.

347
00:08:35,798 --> 00:08:36,918
I go over that again in a later

348
00:08:36,918 --> 00:08:37,298
video.

349
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,200
You maintain full ownership and

350
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:41,600
security of sensitive client data.

351
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,580
And it is, N8N is constantly

352
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:45,600
evolving and being updated and

353
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,740
there's new nodes, community

354
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:48,039
nodes,

355
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:49,809
even nodes created by people

356
00:08:49,809 --> 00:08:51,879
outside of the N8N development

357
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:53,659
team that are making a kind of,

358
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,570
a real powerhouse when it comes to

359
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:57,389
automation nowadays, and I think

360
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:58,159
it's going to be one

361
00:08:58,159 --> 00:08:59,789
of the leading automation tools

362
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:00,740
going forward.

363
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,539
So that's just a quick rundown of

364
00:09:02,549 --> 00:09:03,600
what N8N is.

365
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,610
I hope this made it a bit simple

366
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:05,440
for you to understand.

367
00:09:05,929 --> 00:09:07,570
Again, I think the best way to

368
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:09,779
describe it is by just looking at

369
00:09:09,779 --> 00:09:11,620
the builder like this.

370
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:13,080
You can see you're just connecting

371
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,519
and stringing together different

372
00:09:14,649 --> 00:09:15,840
actions and different rules.

373
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,740
It's very simple.

374
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:19,639
Everything comes down to triggers,

375
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:22,710
if-thens, and AI agents, really.

376
00:09:22,779 --> 00:09:24,840
So hopefully this has made it a

377
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,450
bit clearer for you.

378
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:28,210
And if you keep going through this

379
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:29,539
course, you will see me going into

380
00:09:29,539 --> 00:09:30,320
far more detail on what

381
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,159
N8N can do, how it works, how to

382
00:09:32,289 --> 00:09:33,960
set it up, and how to customize

383
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,179
your workflows.

384
00:09:35,179 --> 00:09:36,299
So check out the rest of the

385
00:09:36,299 --> 00:09:37,570
videos and I will see you in the

386
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:38,080
next one.

387
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:38,799
Peace.
