1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:01,530
What's up guys, Lucas here.

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:03,160
So for this final section of the

3
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:04,400
course, we're going to look over

4
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:05,660
is where to find other N8N

5
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:06,339
templates.

6
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:07,710
Now you do not need these, we've

7
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:08,400
given you every

8
00:00:08,789 --> 00:00:09,630
template you are going to need as

9
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:10,619
part of this course.

10
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:11,519
But maybe

11
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:13,019
you just really like N8N, you want

12
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:14,019
to start making some of your

13
00:00:14,119 --> 00:00:15,589
own workflows, or you want to see

14
00:00:15,589 --> 00:00:16,800
what other ones are out there

15
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,600
that people are making.

16
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,600
Now, the I'm going to show you the

17
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,039
number one site that I use for

18
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:22,679
this three, there's a few sites

19
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:23,320
that have them.

20
00:00:23,379 --> 00:00:24,500
But by far, I think this is the

21
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:25,120
best collection

22
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:25,679
so far.

23
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:26,620
I'll be linking this in the

24
00:00:26,899 --> 00:00:27,339
description.

25
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,199
This is N8N

26
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:29,410
workflows.xyz.

27
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:31,109
And if you come on here, this is

28
00:00:31,149 --> 00:00:31,609
what you'll

29
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,130
see, there's a light mode and dark

30
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:34,280
mode, I'm in dark mode right

31
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:34,560
now.

32
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:35,789
But as you can see, there's nearly

33
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:37,520
4000 workflows available.

34
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:39,890
And they range across a number of

35
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:41,039
categories.

36
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:42,270
So marketing is a

37
00:00:42,579 --> 00:00:43,679
pretty common one that you know,

38
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:44,640
most of us in here will

39
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:46,619
probably like to try out.

40
00:00:46,619 --> 00:00:48,630
And you'll notice here a few

41
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:48,759
things

42
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:49,759
about the cards.

43
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,340
So first of all, on the bottom

44
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:52,359
right here tells

45
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:53,770
you the level of difficulty for

46
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:55,159
customizing or using this.

47
00:00:55,219 --> 00:00:55,640
And

48
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:57,299
then up here tells you was paid or

49
00:00:57,409 --> 00:00:57,729
free.

50
00:00:57,729 --> 00:00:59,049
The vast, vast majority as

51
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:01,590
you can see here are free 3,321 of

52
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:03,719
all the templates are free only

53
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:04,439
617

54
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:04,879
are paid.

55
00:01:04,969 --> 00:01:07,060
But let's take a look at one of

56
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:08,430
them here and show you how

57
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:09,939
you're going to import this into

58
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:10,359
N8N.

59
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:13,079
So we'll just pick a random one.

60
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:17,810
3d product video generator from 2d

61
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:20,120
image for ecommerce stores.

62
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,239
So you can see it's an advanced

63
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:21,879
one.

64
00:01:21,939 --> 00:01:23,629
We click this, we'll get an

65
00:01:23,629 --> 00:01:25,799
explanation of the we're going to

66
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:27,269
preview here of the workflow

67
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:28,459
itself and an explanation of how

68
00:01:28,459 --> 00:01:29,400
it works and what it does.

69
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,359
So this moment that's a load,

70
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:33,079
we'll take a look.

71
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:34,519
Okay, can connect.

72
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:35,700
So let's go down.

73
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,000
So you can see three, what it does

74
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:37,239
work for

75
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:38,150
or read the work for all this, all

76
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:39,239
this generation of three part of

77
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:40,599
the 2d product image sort of by a

78
00:01:40,989 --> 00:01:43,489
form, a whole breakdown of exactly

79
00:01:43,489 --> 00:01:45,799
what every single thing does.

80
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:48,090
So let's scroll up and see how we

81
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:48,200
get

82
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,060
this into N8N.

83
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:50,040
It's very simple.

84
00:01:50,109 --> 00:01:51,260
Over here on the right, you're

85
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:52,760
going to see download workflow.

86
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,200
If we click this, it's going to

87
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:54,980
download.

88
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:57,400
So now it should be saved.

89
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,810
There it is saved in my downloads.

90
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,849
And now if we go back to our N8N

91
00:02:01,849 --> 00:02:04,390
and we do a new workflow, write it

92
00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:07,799
in personal, give it a second

93
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:08,629
to load.

94
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:11,319
Then we click the three dots here,

95
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:13,439
import from file, go to our

96
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:14,680
downloads.

97
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,840
It's the first one

98
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:17,379
here.

99
00:02:17,379 --> 00:02:17,919
Open.

100
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:18,840
There we go.

101
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,139
So that's it here.

102
00:02:20,139 --> 00:02:22,289
And as you can see, as I mentioned

103
00:02:22,289 --> 00:02:23,560
before, and if you watch

104
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,199
the other modules, we've got a

105
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:26,830
number of red nodes that we will

106
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:28,430
have to update or change.

107
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:29,319
There's a number of

108
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:30,439
things that I'm sure enough to

109
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:31,800
connect up, just connect my Google

110
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,400
Drive account, my Google Sheets

111
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:35,229
account, all those sorts of

112
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:35,909
things.

113
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,919
And then I now have the workflow

114
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:38,919
ready to go.

115
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:40,520
So if you look through

116
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:42,000
this site, there's a ton of

117
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,939
different workflows for different

118
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:44,639
use cases.

119
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:46,199
I'm sure there's pretty much

120
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:47,430
one that for you know, whatever

121
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:48,699
you can think of before you got in

122
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,319
here, a lot of useful new ones pop

123
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,860
up, you can sort of the complexity

124
00:02:51,979 --> 00:02:53,349
as well, you see the most popular

125
00:02:53,349 --> 00:02:55,409
ones are for the most popular.

126
00:02:55,449 --> 00:02:56,280
An AI agent

127
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:56,610
chat.

128
00:02:56,699 --> 00:02:57,780
It's pretty basic one building

129
00:02:58,039 --> 00:02:59,389
your first WhatsApp chatbot,

130
00:02:59,389 --> 00:03:02,120
multi-profit social media content

131
00:03:02,419 --> 00:03:02,530
creation.

132
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:03,460
We have our own version of this

133
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:04,599
for you guys here on the course.

134
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:06,590
But there's a number in

135
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:07,830
here that you can try out and you

136
00:03:07,909 --> 00:03:09,370
guys use it to see how N8M works.

137
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:10,590
Maybe you can find some useful

138
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:11,800
ones you can use in your day to

139
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,620
day operations.

140
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:14,009
But overall, I think the best use

141
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:15,000
case for this is just,

142
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,319
you know, finding new automations,

143
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:17,620
messing around with them, learning

144
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:19,560
how to use N8M, learning how to

145
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:21,240
customize existing templates,

146
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:22,969
which you know, we have taught you

147
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:24,520
as we do here in this course.

148
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,439
So hopefully, it'll be relatively

149
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,360
easy for you to get through.

150
00:03:26,419 --> 00:03:29,960
But we still do suggest you use

151
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,039
the

152
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:31,240
templates that we provide here in

153
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:31,759
the course.

154
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:32,520
But if you do want some

155
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,120
information on any you find here,

156
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:35,629
feel free to contact me and I'll

157
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,030
talk you through it.

158
00:03:37,069 --> 00:03:38,759
But yeah, that's the basics.

159
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:39,370
The website again

160
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,860
is N8M workflows to XYZ.

161
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,740
The official N8M website does also

162
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,360
have a number of workflows on

163
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,560
N8M.io.

164
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:50,030
And if we go to product and to

165
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,800
templates,

166
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,919
you will find a ton in here as

167
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,240
well.

168
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,840
There's almost the exact same as

169
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,759
in N8M workflows XYZ.

170
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:01,990
I'm pretty sure that these are

171
00:04:02,069 --> 00:04:03,240
mirroring each other.

172
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,479
But you can see here, these are

173
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:06,599
also sorted by

174
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:08,379
different categories.

175
00:04:08,379 --> 00:04:10,639
And there's different templates

176
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:12,280
for different areas.

177
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,719
So you can see

178
00:04:14,069 --> 00:04:16,160
like content creation, YouTube

179
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,970
summaries, market research, social

180
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,839
media, and it works the exact

181
00:04:21,189 --> 00:04:21,560
same way.

182
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:23,529
You'll click in, and you'll click

183
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:24,399
use for free.

184
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:25,949
And you can either import it

185
00:04:25,949 --> 00:04:26,759
directly into

186
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:28,079
your workspace if you're hosting

187
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:29,410
on N8M cloud, or you can copy the

188
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:30,689
template to your clipboard.

189
00:04:30,689 --> 00:04:30,839
If it's

190
00:04:31,149 --> 00:04:32,339
copied to your clipboard, you just

191
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,879
click it, it's copied, then you go

192
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:34,920
back to your workflow,

193
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:35,959
just delete these.

194
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:36,990
And then command V.

195
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:37,829
And there we go.

196
00:04:37,829 --> 00:04:38,730
It's in there.

197
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:41,439
So that's the basic idea behind

198
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:41,829
it.

199
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:43,899
Useful tool, useful place to find

200
00:04:43,899 --> 00:04:46,120
new workflows to mess around with.

201
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,120
And hopefully you will be able

202
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,399
to learn a bit more about using

203
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:50,339
N8M through that.

204
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:51,930
And any questions, you can always

205
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:52,680
contact me.

206
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,560
Thanks,

207
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,800
Thanks, guys, and I will see you

208
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,069
in the next one.

209
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:55,699
Peace.
