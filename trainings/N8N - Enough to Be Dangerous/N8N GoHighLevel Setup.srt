1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,320
What's up guys, Lucas here.

2
00:00:01,419 --> 00:00:02,290
In this video I'm going to be

3
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:03,819
showing you guys how to connect Go

4
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:04,879
High Level to N8n.

5
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:06,400
The reason I'm showing you this is

6
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,009
that unlike some of the other apps

7
00:00:08,009 --> 00:00:08,140
that

8
00:00:08,259 --> 00:00:09,429
we have in N8n that are pretty

9
00:00:09,429 --> 00:00:10,810
easily integrated, Go High Level

10
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:12,339
requires a little bit more setup.

11
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:13,689
Now it's not super complicated,

12
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:15,039
it's very similar to the Google

13
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:16,239
OAuth video that we've done,

14
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:17,589
but this is to show you kind of

15
00:00:17,589 --> 00:00:19,079
what it looks like and how to get

16
00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:19,739
it set up.

17
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,010
So I've added just a Go High Level

18
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:24,359
node here and I've already got my

19
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:25,710
High Level account added, but

20
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:27,219
let's create a new credential.

21
00:00:27,219 --> 00:00:28,320
The first thing we're going to do

22
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:28,399
is

23
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:30,350
open the docs because I believe

24
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:32,659
that N8n documentation is very

25
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:34,750
good and that for any

26
00:00:34,979 --> 00:00:35,710
account you should usually check

27
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:36,560
out the docs, make sure you're

28
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:37,340
doing it the right way.

29
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:39,179
So for this we're going to be

30
00:00:39,179 --> 00:00:41,539
using the OAuth 2 API because I

31
00:00:41,549 --> 00:00:43,509
believe the V1 API is actually

32
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:44,619
being depreciated.

33
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,119
So like we had with our Google

34
00:00:46,119 --> 00:00:47,679
Docs one, we have to do a client

35
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:48,670
ID and client secret

36
00:00:48,759 --> 00:00:50,229
and so for that we will need a Go

37
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:51,990
High Level developer account.

38
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:53,469
To do that just go to

39
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,359
developers.gohighlevel.com and

40
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:56,119
click sign up.

41
00:00:56,119 --> 00:00:57,380
This is different to your

42
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,740
regular Go High Level account.

43
00:00:58,979 --> 00:01:00,920
So I'm already signed in, click

44
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:01,990
sign in.

45
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:03,200
And again, the document

46
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,140
tells us, go to my apps, create

47
00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:05,590
app.

48
00:01:05,719 --> 00:01:07,810
So we're going to click create app

49
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:09,140
here on the my apps page,

50
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:09,760
rename it.

51
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,219
As you can see, we've done a lot

52
00:01:11,219 --> 00:01:12,620
of test accounts on this.

53
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:15,489
We're going to make sure the app

54
00:01:15,549 --> 00:01:16,579
is set as private.

55
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,359
The target user of the app is sub

56
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:19,030
account.

57
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:20,859
Anyone can install the app and the

58
00:01:20,859 --> 00:01:21,060
listing

59
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,109
type is white label.

60
00:01:22,109 --> 00:01:23,450
So we're going to click create

61
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:23,810
app.

62
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:25,189
Now there's some basic things

63
00:01:25,189 --> 00:01:26,099
we'll put in here.

64
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:27,180
You will have to put in an app

65
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,049
logo as we forge with 400 pixels,

66
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:30,180
uh, minimum.

67
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,079
And then we'll choose a

68
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:32,379
category, a tagline, and a

69
00:01:32,379 --> 00:01:33,980
company, everything else you can

70
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:34,659
leave blank.

71
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:36,439
So I've just got a basic image

72
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:36,930
page.

73
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,609
I'm going to use here for this

74
00:01:38,609 --> 00:01:39,379
category.

75
00:01:39,379 --> 00:01:40,700
Does it not matter?

76
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:44,260
Tagline test company client

77
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:44,840
ascension.

78
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,489
And let's save that.

79
00:01:47,489 --> 00:01:48,780
And you'll see their basic info

80
00:01:48,829 --> 00:01:49,420
that ticked off.

81
00:01:49,469 --> 00:01:51,170
So next we need profile details.

82
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:52,260
This one, right?

83
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:53,420
Just test, test, test.

84
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,739
We offer to upload, I believe a

85
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,260
minimum of three images.

86
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:58,079
I'm just going to use the same

87
00:01:58,170 --> 00:01:58,430
one.

88
00:01:58,909 --> 00:02:04,129
one, two and three, maybe it's

89
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:04,430
four.

90
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:05,409
I think it's three images.

91
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:06,780
Save.

92
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:10,219
There we go.

93
00:02:10,219 --> 00:02:12,280
And then the next thing you see us

94
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,000
took off that too, uh, support

95
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,419
details,

96
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:17,900
support email, your email address.

97
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:26,780
And phone number number.

98
00:02:26,849 --> 00:02:27,849
Save.

99
00:02:27,849 --> 00:02:28,849
Okay.

100
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:29,659
All those are done.

101
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:30,409
Pricing details.

102
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:31,080
You can actually leave blank

103
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,120
because this is a free app.

104
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,400
So it actually automatically sets

105
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:33,400
it as free.

106
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:33,400
So that's fine.

107
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,340
But now we need to go to advanced

108
00:02:35,409 --> 00:02:36,639
settings and off.

109
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:38,550
The first thing you see here is

110
00:02:38,699 --> 00:02:39,400
scopes.

111
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,479
And if we look back again, the

112
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:42,699
credentials, we need to add these

113
00:02:42,699 --> 00:02:43,259
scopes.

114
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:45,400
So you can just copy and paste

115
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:45,629
these.

116
00:02:45,629 --> 00:02:47,759
We copy this and just paste it in

117
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:48,400
here.

118
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,879
There's locations that read only.

119
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,400
We'll do contacts.read only.

120
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:59,009
We will do contacts.write.

121
00:02:59,009 --> 00:03:06,520
We'll do opportunities.read only.

122
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:14,509
Opportunities.write.

123
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,569
I believe it might actually also

124
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:16,819
need opportunities.update.

125
00:03:16,819 --> 00:03:19,289
No, we're going to use it right.

126
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,169
This covers it.

127
00:03:20,169 --> 00:03:21,400
Uh, and users.write.

128
00:03:21,689 --> 00:03:24,639
And users.read only.

129
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:26,530
So we paste the dot in there.

130
00:03:26,699 --> 00:03:28,520
Now we get to redirect URL.

131
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,860
We're going to get this from N8N.

132
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:32,770
If we go back to N8N, here's our

133
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:34,069
OAuth redirect URL.

134
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:36,400
Copy that to the clipboard.

135
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,300
Let's paste this in here.

136
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:38,879
Add.

137
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,139
Then we need to get our client ID

138
00:03:41,219 --> 00:03:41,699
and secret.

139
00:03:41,699 --> 00:03:44,400
So we just click client keys, N8N,

140
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,509
add.

141
00:03:46,699 --> 00:03:49,159
And there's our client ID.

142
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:52,400
paste.

143
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,349
And our client secret.

144
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:59,400
Now next we need to scope.

145
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,680
So it's the same scopes we just

146
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,740
added are the ones we're going to

147
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:02,120
put in here.

148
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:05,639
And luckily N8N has, uh, done a

149
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:06,639
very good job of actually making a

150
00:04:06,819 --> 00:04:07,650
copy and paste here.

151
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:08,400
We just copy this.

152
00:04:08,699 --> 00:04:11,919
And we can paste it in as the

153
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:13,400
scopes.

154
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,090
And then we click connect my

155
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:14,400
account.

156
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,399
Oh, actually one thing I forgot.

157
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:21,350
So we're going to please log in

158
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:21,389
the serum.

159
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:22,660
The reason for the, we're going to

160
00:04:22,699 --> 00:04:22,939
get that.

161
00:04:22,949 --> 00:04:23,639
Please log in the serum is this.

162
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,310
The authorization URL says white

163
00:04:25,459 --> 00:04:26,100
label.

164
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,399
Set this as standard.

165
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:28,889
Once you set it as standard,

166
00:04:28,889 --> 00:04:29,750
you're good to go.

167
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,029
So now when you click, connect my

168
00:04:31,389 --> 00:04:31,399
account.

169
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:36,399
Give it a second to load.

170
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:37,000
There we go.

171
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,839
There's our app.

172
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:38,399
We're going to click next.

173
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:39,850
We're going to choose the sub

174
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:40,519
account.

175
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:42,600
Okay.

176
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,389
Uh, there's not much client value.

177
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:45,839
Okay.

178
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:47,629
Let's see why that is.

179
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:49,000
So did we not copy this correctly?

180
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,660
Maybe it's copy that again.

181
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:53,579
Let's go back here.

182
00:04:55,029 --> 00:04:56,180
Oh, I think we saved.

183
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,680
So, uh, we've added this.

184
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,939
Yeah, that's right.

185
00:04:58,939 --> 00:05:00,019
So let's click save.

186
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:02,300
There we go.

187
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,139
Now we should be good.

188
00:05:03,139 --> 00:05:05,019
So now if we try again,

189
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:08,889
there we go.

190
00:05:08,939 --> 00:05:09,810
We are connected.

191
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,160
So again, make sure you do that.

192
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,519
Make sure you save down here at

193
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:13,220
the bottom, right?

194
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:14,579
After you add your redirect URL

195
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:15,970
and create your client key, I

196
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:17,560
added the redirect URL, but then I

197
00:05:17,569 --> 00:05:18,300
created the client key and I

198
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,319
forgot to click save.

199
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:21,319
So just make sure you click save

200
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:23,379
and now the account is connected.

201
00:05:23,379 --> 00:05:25,459
So, uh, I don't need this.

202
00:05:25,459 --> 00:05:26,699
So I'm going to delete this, but,

203
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:29,139
uh, that is how you connect, go

204
00:05:29,139 --> 00:05:29,660
high level.

205
00:05:29,709 --> 00:05:31,019
And that'll be important for a lot

206
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:32,420
of other automations we do later

207
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:32,730
on.

208
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:34,339
So make sure you got that set up

209
00:05:34,339 --> 00:05:36,300
and, uh, any questions, feel free

210
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,360
to hit me up and I will see you in

211
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:37,939
the next one.

212
00:05:37,939 --> 00:05:38,750
Peace.
