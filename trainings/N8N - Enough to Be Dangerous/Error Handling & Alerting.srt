1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,960
So guys, Lucas here.

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:03,560
So in the last module, we went

3
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:05,519
over a little bit about triggers,

4
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:06,219
AI agents,

5
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:08,660
HTTP request nodes, and, you know,

6
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:10,599
sending files to platforms and

7
00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:11,960
things like that.

8
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:13,599
So now we're going to go over

9
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:15,330
briefly, how do we deal with

10
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:17,019
errors in our workflow?

11
00:00:17,019 --> 00:00:17,800
Because no

12
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,250
matter how good you make it, there

13
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:20,649
often will be times you still will

14
00:00:20,649 --> 00:00:21,839
get the odd error here or

15
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:22,350
there.

16
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:23,829
So I'm going to show you how we

17
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:24,660
set this up.

18
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,460
First of all, we're going to look

19
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:27,079
at one of the

20
00:00:27,079 --> 00:00:28,489
most likely nodes to error.

21
00:00:28,489 --> 00:00:30,019
For instance, it's relatively

22
00:00:30,019 --> 00:00:31,550
unlikely that a set node you've

23
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:31,839
tested

24
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,640
repeatedly is going to error out.

25
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,340
But it is definitely possible that

26
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:39,159
a AI agent might have an

27
00:00:39,159 --> 00:00:40,079
error, right?

28
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:41,549
So how do we deal with that?

29
00:00:41,549 --> 00:00:43,320
For instance, an example of why an

30
00:00:43,329 --> 00:00:44,320
AI agent may have

31
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,259
an error, say you're using Claude

32
00:00:46,259 --> 00:00:47,750
to generate your script or

33
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:49,920
something, and Claude's down, you

34
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,229
know,

35
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,310
the API is not available, then

36
00:00:51,479 --> 00:00:52,500
also we're going to get an error.

37
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,780
So we're going to have to simulate

38
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:53,960
an

39
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:54,960
error here because everything's

40
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:55,630
currently working.

41
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:56,320
But I'm going to show you

42
00:00:56,329 --> 00:00:56,960
basically how this

43
00:00:56,979 --> 00:00:57,310
works.

44
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:58,369
So first of all, we're going to

45
00:00:58,369 --> 00:00:59,539
double click on our AI agent here,

46
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:00,520
and then we're going to go to

47
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,159
settings.

48
00:01:01,329 --> 00:01:02,509
And you'll see on error currently

49
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,090
set to stop the workflow.

50
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:05,370
So if there's an error, the

51
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,799
workflow just won't run.

52
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:08,040
Now, this is not ideal.

53
00:01:08,069 --> 00:01:10,239
If you know, you are have a a

54
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:11,750
workflow like this, where

55
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,980
you know, we want to send messages

56
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:13,980
to a telegram in order to get a

57
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:15,700
response out, use me sending

58
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,689
messages and getting no response.

59
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:19,239
So what we do is we set this to

60
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:21,040
continue using error output.

61
00:01:21,099 --> 00:01:23,060
So this

62
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:24,469
means that we will get a separate

63
00:01:24,469 --> 00:01:25,780
error output that we can route

64
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:26,730
information to.

65
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,900
So now we've got a

66
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:30,069
success branch and an error

67
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:30,560
branch.

68
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,310
And we go down here, I'm going to

69
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:33,500
recreate an error.

70
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,180
You can see

71
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:36,170
just here, if we zoom in, we now

72
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,489
have success and error, right?

73
00:01:38,489 --> 00:01:40,680
So let's disconnect this chat

74
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,780
model,

75
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:43,319
because that way, when we run this

76
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:44,930
again, we're going to get an error

77
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:46,219
no matter what, right?

78
00:01:46,219 --> 00:01:47,780
So if I just

79
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:49,650
click run, you'll see, yep, we got

80
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:51,030
now here, this is green.

81
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:52,819
So the success one is green error

82
00:01:52,819 --> 00:01:53,060
out.

83
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:53,780
So

84
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:54,659
what do we do next?

85
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,099
Next, we're going to want to

86
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:57,540
format our error message.

87
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:58,629
So to do that, we're just

88
00:01:58,659 --> 00:02:00,650
going to choose a set node.

89
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:02,159
And we're just going to add a

90
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,879
name, or we're just going to call

91
00:02:03,879 --> 00:02:05,299
it error.

92
00:02:05,299 --> 00:02:07,290
Now we are, as you can see, this

93
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:09,620
is connected to the success one,

94
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:10,419
we don't want that connected

95
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:10,659
there,

96
00:02:10,659 --> 00:02:11,699
we're going to connect it to the

97
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:12,180
error node.

98
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,219
So we connect error there.

99
00:02:13,259 --> 00:02:15,509
We've named it error,

100
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:17,099
and we can see the error message

101
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:18,620
here, a chat model sub node must

102
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:20,020
be connected and enabled.

103
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,009
So let's add that as the value

104
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:22,900
here.

105
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:26,389
Now, we want to send this

106
00:02:26,509 --> 00:02:28,330
somewhere, we want to get alerted

107
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:29,000
about this.

108
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,330
So let's just assume that we want

109
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:32,000
to get this alert in Slack, we

110
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,189
want a Slack message to

111
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:35,590
DM us and say, Hey, you know, this

112
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:36,849
is self working.

113
00:02:36,849 --> 00:02:38,810
So we choose Slack, and we're

114
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:40,419
going to click send a

115
00:02:40,419 --> 00:02:41,090
message.

116
00:02:41,289 --> 00:02:43,090
Now, just for the purpose of this,

117
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:45,000
we're going to send a message to a

118
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,939
user, and we're just

119
00:02:45,939 --> 00:02:47,009
going to pick me.

120
00:02:47,139 --> 00:02:49,509
So we're going to type in Lucas,

121
00:02:49,509 --> 00:02:54,219
and get a job.

122
00:02:54,219 --> 00:02:58,500
There you go, there's me, Lucas,

123
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:58,819
right?

124
00:02:58,819 --> 00:03:02,460
So we are going to run this to get

125
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:06,330
the error again.

126
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:10,340
Error branch there.

127
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:12,979
Going to here to set the field.

128
00:03:12,979 --> 00:03:14,719
There is our output at chat model

129
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,479
sub node must be connected and

130
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:17,219
enabled.

131
00:03:17,219 --> 00:03:19,199
Now over here, we're going

132
00:03:19,219 --> 00:03:20,840
to write our message as an

133
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,849
expression.

134
00:03:21,849 --> 00:03:23,539
So we're going to say error

135
00:03:23,539 --> 00:03:24,500
detected.

136
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,080
And we need to know what

137
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:27,310
workflow this is in because this

138
00:03:27,349 --> 00:03:28,330
could be in any workflow.

139
00:03:28,409 --> 00:03:29,300
So we name it workflow.

140
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,659
And we're going

141
00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:32,280
to do two curly brackets.

142
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,110
And if you actually scroll down

143
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:36,099
through here, you can see some of

144
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:36,340
the things

145
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:37,599
you can input in here.

146
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,229
So we're looking at metadata,

147
00:03:39,229 --> 00:03:39,740
right?

148
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:41,460
And if we go down to workflow,

149
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:41,620
it's

150
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:44,219
information about the workflow.

151
00:03:44,219 --> 00:03:46,669
And if we just put dot name, I've

152
00:03:46,669 --> 00:03:49,349
named the workflow example.

153
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:49,699
So it's

154
00:03:49,699 --> 00:03:50,620
going to name the workflow

155
00:03:50,909 --> 00:03:51,030
example.

156
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,090
So all we did there again, I'll

157
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:52,900
just redo that again.

158
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,889
Curly brackets, two of them.

159
00:03:57,219 --> 00:03:58,750
Scroll down until you get to

160
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:02,009
metadata, you'll find workflow.

161
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:02,650
Then we're

162
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:04,400
going to press a full stop and

163
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:04,919
name.

164
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:06,800
And that's how we get the name of

165
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,939
the workflow.

166
00:04:07,939 --> 00:04:08,500
So now when we get

167
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,960
this error message, we'll know

168
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,650
it's in this particular workflow.

169
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:12,969
And then we'll just say error.

170
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,020
And we're

171
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,759
just going to drag from our edit

172
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:17,730
fields one over here, error.

173
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:19,129
And so now if we open this

174
00:04:19,129 --> 00:04:20,100
expression,

175
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,470
you'll see what it looks like

176
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:23,079
error detected workflow example

177
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:24,899
error, a chart model sub node must

178
00:04:24,899 --> 00:04:24,949
be

179
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,319
connected and enabled.

180
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:27,910
So now we know what the error is.

181
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:29,410
Now with the other ones, you do

182
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:29,860
the same thing,

183
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,600
you can essentially go in here.

184
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:34,029
And you can do on error continue

185
00:04:34,069 --> 00:04:36,230
using error output.

186
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:36,720
And then you can

187
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:39,949
connect the error output to a set

188
00:04:39,949 --> 00:04:40,800
node.

189
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:44,120
And we can do the same thing

190
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,319
again.

191
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:48,019
So we'll get wherever the error

192
00:04:48,019 --> 00:04:49,310
comes from, we'll get it in here,

193
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:49,689
right?

194
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:52,379
So long.

195
00:04:52,379 --> 00:04:54,879
And we'll get sent a message.

196
00:04:54,889 --> 00:04:55,769
Now this is vital,

197
00:04:55,779 --> 00:04:56,920
because you will be dealing with a

198
00:04:57,029 --> 00:04:58,160
lot of complicated workflows we've

199
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:58,660
set up for you,

200
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:00,160
and we'll have the error nodes

201
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:00,649
built in.

202
00:05:00,939 --> 00:05:02,319
But this is just an idea of how if

203
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:03,129
you're making your own

204
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,629
workflow, how you would set this

205
00:05:04,629 --> 00:05:05,980
up to ensure that you are getting

206
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:08,500
alerted properly of any potential

207
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,129
issues with the workflow.

208
00:05:10,129 --> 00:05:12,029
Do you should always run multiple

209
00:05:12,029 --> 00:05:13,839
tests of every single workflow

210
00:05:13,949 --> 00:05:14,410
that you

211
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:15,759
create or that you use, even the

212
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:17,120
ones that we give you, I want you

213
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,220
to make sure that you know you

214
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:20,480
modify them appropriately, and

215
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,680
then you test the hell out of them

216
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,060
to make sure that this working the

217
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:23,129
way

218
00:05:23,139 --> 00:05:24,790
that works for your particular

219
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:26,129
operations and setup.

220
00:05:26,129 --> 00:05:27,889
For instance, some of you may not

221
00:05:27,889 --> 00:05:28,819
be using Slack,

222
00:05:28,819 --> 00:05:30,230
you may be using, I don't know,

223
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:31,519
maybe you run everything off

224
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:33,290
Telegram or WhatsApp or something,

225
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,290
maybe use ClickUp, something like

226
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:36,019
that.

227
00:05:36,019 --> 00:05:37,699
So there will be some mild

228
00:05:37,699 --> 00:05:39,139
modification of the workflows

229
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:41,060
I'll be showing you guys later on

230
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:43,050
in the workflow setup modules.

231
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:44,480
And for that, I just want to make

232
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,470
sure that you know how to set up

233
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,490
any errors that may turn up if you

234
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:47,500
know you're using a separate

235
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:49,470
sort of setup that we make for you

236
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:50,019
guys.

237
00:05:50,019 --> 00:05:51,120
But again, these will all be set

238
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,009
up already inside the

239
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,720
workflows we give you, there will

240
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,459
be error notifications created.

241
00:05:55,459 --> 00:05:57,379
So you shouldn't have

242
00:05:57,379 --> 00:05:58,980
to worry too much.

243
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:01,339
But yeah, hopefully that was

244
00:06:01,339 --> 00:06:02,230
helpful.

245
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:04,240
And let's move on to the next

246
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:04,660
module.

247
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:05,699
See you guys the next one.

248
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:07,220
Peace.
