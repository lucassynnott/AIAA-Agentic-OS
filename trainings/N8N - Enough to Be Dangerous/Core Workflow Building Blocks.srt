1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:01,659
What's up guys?

2
00:00:01,659 --> 00:00:03,100
Lucas here, the head of AI at

3
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:04,259
Client Ascension.

4
00:00:04,429 --> 00:00:05,240
In this video, I'm going to give

5
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:06,849
you guys a quick rundown of the

6
00:00:06,849 --> 00:00:08,980
basics of N8N and kind of the core

7
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:10,169
workflow building blocks you guys

8
00:00:10,169 --> 00:00:10,919
are going to use.

9
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:12,429
Now, just to be noted, this is not

10
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:13,269
an N8N course.

11
00:00:13,269 --> 00:00:14,800
This is not, you know, something

12
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,160
super in-depth you're going to

13
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:17,600
have to get really, really good

14
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,070
at.

15
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:19,469
But you will have to learn how to

16
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,019
basically edit the N8N workflows

17
00:00:21,019 --> 00:00:22,500
we're going to give you guys.

18
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,620
And the best way to do that is to

19
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,879
give you an understanding of how

20
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:25,820
the software works.

21
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:28,000
So I put together here some of the

22
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:29,899
kind of core blocks you're going

23
00:00:29,899 --> 00:00:31,440
to be using as part of these

24
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,298
workflows.

25
00:00:32,298 --> 00:00:33,950
I'm going to show you briefly how

26
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:35,399
they work and kind of how to edit

27
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:36,060
them.

28
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:37,530
So the first section we'll look at

29
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:38,500
here is triggers.

30
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:39,840
As you can see, I've got a few

31
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:40,619
added here.

32
00:00:40,619 --> 00:00:43,060
We've got a total of seven added.

33
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,250
The first one is when clicking

34
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:46,880
execute workflow.

35
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,299
So basically what that means is

36
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:49,600
that when you click this big

37
00:00:49,609 --> 00:00:51,189
execute workflow button, the

38
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,899
workflow is going to begin.

39
00:00:53,179 --> 00:00:54,039
That's a pretty simple one.

40
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:54,909
This is what you want to use

41
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,109
mainly for testing your workflows

42
00:00:56,109 --> 00:00:57,280
and making sure that everything is

43
00:00:57,450 --> 00:00:58,219
working correctly.

44
00:00:58,409 --> 00:00:59,310
Then we've got the schedule

45
00:00:59,549 --> 00:00:59,789
trigger.

46
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:01,130
This means that the workflow will

47
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:02,039
run on a schedule.

48
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,500
You set the schedule how you want

49
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,920
it to and it will run at that time

50
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,340
every single day as long as your

51
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:08,019
N8N instance is open running.

52
00:01:08,019 --> 00:01:09,629
On form submission, N8N is a

53
00:01:09,629 --> 00:01:11,390
pretty powerful form builder and

54
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:13,069
you can build forms in N8N that

55
00:01:13,069 --> 00:01:14,750
when they're submitted, it'll

56
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,079
begin the workflow.

57
00:01:16,549 --> 00:01:17,870
This is very simple for client

58
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:19,629
onboardings and things like that

59
00:01:19,629 --> 00:01:21,060
or if you want to fill out the

60
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:22,810
details of something just to kick

61
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:24,680
off an existing workflow, that's

62
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,810
the perfect way to use that.

63
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:28,049
A webhook basically means that

64
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:29,760
when the N8N instance gets

65
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:32,379
information from another app or

66
00:01:32,439 --> 00:01:33,299
system.

67
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:34,870
So for instance, with something

68
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:36,400
like Zapier or if you're building

69
00:01:36,489 --> 00:01:37,989
a front end to an app, that's when

70
00:01:37,989 --> 00:01:39,159
you'd use a webhook.

71
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,799
When executed by another workflow.

72
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:44,049
This means that your N8N workflow

73
00:01:44,049 --> 00:01:45,709
can start another N8N workflow

74
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:48,000
that's separate from it.

75
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,269
So say you had a large workflow

76
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:50,390
you wanted to break up into

77
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:51,340
multiple pieces.

78
00:01:52,019 --> 00:01:53,760
You could have a trigger set that

79
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,040
when the other workflow finishes,

80
00:01:56,189 --> 00:01:58,189
it executes the next workflow.

81
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,459
When chat message receives.

82
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,000
That means when you send a message

83
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,569
down here in the N8N chat here, it

84
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:05,019
will begin the workflow.

85
00:02:05,269 --> 00:02:07,140
And then there's multiple app

86
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,719
related triggers.

87
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:09,800
So this one is a Google Sheets

88
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:11,580
trigger, but there is a ton.

89
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,539
If we hit the little plus button

90
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,080
over here and we look for

91
00:02:15,099 --> 00:02:17,379
triggers, another trigger on app

92
00:02:17,409 --> 00:02:19,349
events, you can see there's tons

93
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:19,819
here.

94
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:21,750
This one, essentially, I've set up

95
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:22,900
that when there's a new row

96
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,250
created in Google Sheets, the

97
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,259
workflow begins.

98
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:26,849
Now, when they begin, we want to

99
00:02:26,849 --> 00:02:28,639
connect them to something else.

100
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,719
So say we wanted to get all of the

101
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:33,099
bases in our Airtable instance.

102
00:02:33,099 --> 00:02:34,849
We would connect when clicking

103
00:02:34,849 --> 00:02:36,460
execute workflow to get many

104
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:37,009
bases.

105
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:39,430
And then when we click this button

106
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:41,780
here, it will get all the bases in

107
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:42,759
Airtable.

108
00:02:43,009 --> 00:02:44,409
Then say on a schedule, we want to

109
00:02:44,509 --> 00:02:46,150
send a Slack message to remind us

110
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,120
of something.

111
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,080
Schedule trigger goes to Slack

112
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:49,879
message.

113
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:51,460
It will send a Slack message.

114
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:53,069
On form submission, we want to

115
00:02:53,069 --> 00:02:54,939
store the data in Google Sheets.

116
00:02:54,939 --> 00:02:56,900
On form submission, append or

117
00:02:56,979 --> 00:02:58,379
update row in Sheet.

118
00:02:58,379 --> 00:02:59,500
Now, there's tons of actions here.

119
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,479
I only put three in here.

120
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,139
But if we click this here and we

121
00:03:02,229 --> 00:03:03,870
go to actions in an app, you can

122
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:05,400
see there is a huge amount to

123
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,419
choose from.

124
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:07,620
This is very similar to if you use

125
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,879
Zapier or anything like that.

126
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,419
It's just choosing what app you

127
00:03:10,419 --> 00:03:11,960
want your workflow to interact

128
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,379
with.

129
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:13,789
So next, we have the

130
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:14,900
transformation section.

131
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,319
The transformation section refers

132
00:03:16,349 --> 00:03:17,479
to how we transform data that

133
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:18,259
comes through.

134
00:03:18,629 --> 00:03:19,919
The first one we have is called a

135
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:21,240
set node or a field node.

136
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:23,199
And essentially, this allows us to

137
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,150
set certain data and variables.

138
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,120
The best way, I think, to use this

139
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,909
is, for instance, if you have a

140
00:03:28,909 --> 00:03:30,319
number of APIs as part of a

141
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:30,710
workflow.

142
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:31,800
You're connecting to a number of

143
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:32,259
services.

144
00:03:32,789 --> 00:03:33,889
You will have a number of API

145
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,280
keys.

146
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:35,849
You might have, say, your Blotato

147
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:37,280
API key for connecting to Blotato

148
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,900
to schedule your social media.

149
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:42,810
You might have a Facebook API key.

150
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,659
There's a ton there.

151
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:46,310
But basically, in here, if you

152
00:03:46,409 --> 00:03:48,280
double-click on this, you can add

153
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:48,960
a field.

154
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:52,020
And so I can name it, say, Apify

155
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:52,750
API.

156
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,919
And then here, I'll put my Apify

157
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:55,719
API key.

158
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,680
Now, then when we get later on

159
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,629
down to the HTTP node we need to

160
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:01,759
use to execute this, we don't

161
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:03,759
actually have to go and copy and

162
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:05,599
paste in the full API key.

163
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:06,759
We can just find it.

164
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:07,460
It'll be over here.

165
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:09,289
We can find the API key here and

166
00:04:09,289 --> 00:04:10,960
just drag and drop it in.

167
00:04:10,979 --> 00:04:12,370
It just makes it easy to manage

168
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:13,530
and organize things.

169
00:04:13,819 --> 00:04:15,939
Then the merge node.

170
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,829
The merge node refers to taking

171
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,439
two different inputs.

172
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:21,550
So, say, you have one kind of

173
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:23,759
section of a flow that creates a

174
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:25,699
Google Doc and then one that

175
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:27,600
generates AI content.

176
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:29,870
You can merge them at the end to

177
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:32,519
combine the AI-generated content

178
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:34,370
into the Google Doc.

179
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,069
Aggregate basically takes multiple

180
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:39,410
inputs or items and puts them all

181
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:40,699
into one item.

182
00:04:40,699 --> 00:04:42,240
So, if you were creating a list,

183
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,800
you had, say, an AI agent that was

184
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:45,740
creating, you know, or multiple AI

185
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:47,220
agents creating a big list of

186
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,160
information.

187
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,259
You can aggregate all that

188
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,610
information into one item at the

189
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:52,060
end that then, say, you might add

190
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,160
to, like, a Google Doc or

191
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:53,860
something.

192
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,680
And spit out does the opposite of

193
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,579
aggregate.

194
00:04:56,579 --> 00:04:58,230
It basically takes multiple or

195
00:04:58,329 --> 00:05:00,079
takes one item and then splits it

196
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:01,360
out into multiple.

197
00:05:01,529 --> 00:05:03,720
So, if you, say, had a form that

198
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,829
had first name and last name as

199
00:05:05,829 --> 00:05:07,750
one input, then you could split

200
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:09,680
those into two separate outputs.

201
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,939
You'd have two outputs that would

202
00:05:11,009 --> 00:05:12,139
be the first name and the next one

203
00:05:12,139 --> 00:05:13,180
would be the last name.

204
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,139
Logic is pretty simple.

205
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:18,300
If this is essentially just, you

206
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,449
know, if this is true, then this

207
00:05:20,569 --> 00:05:22,040
happens, you know?

208
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:22,720
So, I click here.

209
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:24,370
If this value is equal to

210
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:26,600
whatever, then it's true.

211
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:29,259
And then you can change these.

212
00:05:29,259 --> 00:05:30,629
So, these are very simply, like,

213
00:05:30,629 --> 00:05:32,000
if it exists, if it doesn't exist,

214
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,459
if it's empty, not empty, it's

215
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,649
just a number of, you know, date

216
00:05:35,709 --> 00:05:37,060
and time number.

217
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,949
This is basically just saying when

218
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:40,329
it should continue, when it should

219
00:05:40,329 --> 00:05:41,100
not, you know?

220
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,230
So, say, for instance, we use this

221
00:05:42,339 --> 00:05:42,920
for an error node.

222
00:05:43,089 --> 00:05:45,259
If we, you know, do a scrape of a

223
00:05:45,259 --> 00:05:46,829
website, if it returns

224
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:49,800
information, so if, you know, data

225
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,490
field is, you know, equal to true,

226
00:05:52,529 --> 00:05:53,870
then continues.

227
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,689
If it's not, then it'll go to an

228
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,149
error node when it alerts in Slack

229
00:05:57,149 --> 00:05:58,509
or something that it's not, not

230
00:05:58,839 --> 00:05:59,160
working.

231
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,500
A switch is just rules.

232
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,649
So, essentially, if this value is

233
00:06:03,649 --> 00:06:05,410
equal to this value, then this

234
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,360
happens.

235
00:06:06,529 --> 00:06:08,529
It just is how you route this is

236
00:06:08,529 --> 00:06:10,300
just determined by that.

237
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,490
So, you just basically can add

238
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,259
multiple routing rules.

239
00:06:14,259 --> 00:06:15,720
If I add a few more here, you see,

240
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,279
there you go, 0, 1, 2.

241
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:19,120
So, I can say, you know, if the

242
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,629
name is equal to Brian, then it

243
00:06:20,629 --> 00:06:21,980
goes to the Brian flow.

244
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,100
If the name is equal to Steven, it

245
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:23,930
goes to the Steven flow.

246
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,420
Things like that.

247
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:27,069
The wait node is exactly what it

248
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:27,959
sounds like.

249
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:29,389
It just pauses the workflow for a

250
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:30,379
set amount of time.

251
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:32,540
So, you will just set the time by

252
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:34,860
choosing the wait amount of time,

253
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,540
five seconds, and it will just

254
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:37,519
wait for five seconds.

255
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:38,370
This will be handy if you're

256
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:39,170
sending information to be

257
00:06:39,269 --> 00:06:40,319
processed by something or waiting

258
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:41,420
for something to generate.

259
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:42,930
So, if you send the information to

260
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:44,379
an AI generator, you want to wait

261
00:06:44,389 --> 00:06:45,610
until it's generated for a few

262
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:46,279
seconds,

263
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,540
and then it will, you know, say,

264
00:06:47,649 --> 00:06:48,540
get that information and move it

265
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:49,339
on through the flow.

266
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:51,269
And filter just removes things we

267
00:06:51,269 --> 00:06:52,139
don't want.

268
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:53,680
You know, if this value is equal

269
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,230
to this, then it removes it.

270
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:57,129
And finally, we have the AI

271
00:06:57,139 --> 00:06:58,019
section.

272
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:59,870
So, we have an AI agent.

273
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:01,410
Now, the AI agent is very, very

274
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:02,889
powerful because what we can do

275
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:04,470
with this, if I choose to find

276
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:04,939
below,

277
00:07:04,939 --> 00:07:06,300
is we can set not just a prompt,

278
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,740
the user message, which you are

279
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:08,699
probably used to,

280
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,620
going to ChatGPT and typing in,

281
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:12,360
you know, how do I do XYZ?

282
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,430
But we can also add a system

283
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:15,439
message.

284
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:18,009
And this basically tells the AI

285
00:07:18,009 --> 00:07:19,360
what its role is.

286
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,319
This message will be sent to the

287
00:07:20,509 --> 00:07:21,290
agent before the conversation

288
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:23,269
starts, so it will know how it

289
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:23,959
should act.

290
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,209
And this can be super useful for

291
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:26,720
giving an extra added information

292
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,019
for telling it the role that it's

293
00:07:28,189 --> 00:07:28,660
going to be playing,

294
00:07:28,939 --> 00:07:30,079
giving it rules around how it

295
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:32,019
should operate, things like that.

296
00:07:32,259 --> 00:07:33,649
And then you can put your variable

297
00:07:33,649 --> 00:07:34,660
information in here.

298
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:35,920
So, for instance, here you can

299
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,240
say, you know, you're an expert

300
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,449
YouTube script writer.

301
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:39,500
And you get a bunch of information

302
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,560
on writing YouTube scripts, the

303
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,569
format thing and all that sort of

304
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:41,959
stuff.

305
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,529
And then here you can say, I want

306
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:45,060
you to write a YouTube script for

307
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:45,899
this client.

308
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:46,980
And the variable will be the

309
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:47,720
client's name.

310
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,680
And then here's their research.

311
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,470
The variable will be all the

312
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,480
research document, all that sort

313
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:51,920
of stuff.

314
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,069
And then it will write basically a

315
00:07:53,259 --> 00:07:54,079
perfect YouTube script.

316
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:56,029
A question and answer chain is

317
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,180
very similar.

318
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,610
Essentially, what this just does

319
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:02,529
is it allows you to tell it how

320
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:04,120
you want it to act and just ask

321
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,040
questions and answers.

322
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,040
It's more so for kind of, you

323
00:08:06,209 --> 00:08:07,290
know, getting information from a

324
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:08,490
knowledge base or something like

325
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:08,829
that,

326
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:10,800
or giving a kind of, you know,

327
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:12,459
basic sort of retrieval of

328
00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:13,600
information.

329
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:16,439
Down here, each of these needs a

330
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:18,740
chat model connected.

331
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:21,279
So you can connect, for instance,

332
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,670
a OpenAI chat model and Anthropic

333
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,300
chat model, which is Claude,

334
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,420
Google Gemini chat model.

335
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,189
My suggestion is that you use

336
00:08:28,189 --> 00:08:28,959
OpenRouter.

337
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,620
OpenRouter is a service that

338
00:08:30,709 --> 00:08:32,288
allows you to get access to

339
00:08:32,288 --> 00:08:34,350
basically every single model out

340
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:35,038
there.

341
00:08:35,038 --> 00:08:36,220
So from every company.

342
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,350
So whether that's a Claude,

343
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:40,820
whether it's Grok, whether it's

344
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:43,870
ChatGPT, Perplexity, any of them.

345
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:44,950
And there's a few free ones in

346
00:08:45,129 --> 00:08:46,080
here as well that are actually

347
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,360
very good, such as DeepSeq.

348
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,230
So I think that using OpenAI gives

349
00:08:49,259 --> 00:08:50,980
you access to everything.

350
00:08:51,259 --> 00:08:52,919
That means you also only have to

351
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:54,759
set up one account as well.

352
00:08:54,759 --> 00:08:55,419
You only have to set up your

353
00:08:55,419 --> 00:08:56,100
OpenRouter account.

354
00:08:56,179 --> 00:08:57,019
Get your details in here.

355
00:08:57,019 --> 00:08:58,080
And then you're good to go.

356
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,029
So that's the basics of these

357
00:09:00,029 --> 00:09:00,720
nodes.

358
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,779
They are not super complicated.

359
00:09:02,779 --> 00:09:04,179
You probably really don't need to

360
00:09:04,179 --> 00:09:05,309
know a lot of this stuff.

361
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,240
I just want to give you guys a

362
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,389
quick run through of the basics of

363
00:09:07,389 --> 00:09:08,720
what these are and what they do.

364
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,139
So that if you are editing the

365
00:09:10,169 --> 00:09:11,720
workflows later on and you come

366
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,000
across them, you're not completely

367
00:09:13,149 --> 00:09:13,360
lost.

368
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,000
And you kind of know how they act.

369
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,200
Of course, we'll be going into

370
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:18,370
much more detail on each of the

371
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:19,720
workflows specifically and how to

372
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,980
edit them in the workflow videos

373
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:22,000
you'll find later on in the

374
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,549
course.

375
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,440
But this is a quick intro to N8N.

376
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:25,980
And hopefully this gives you an

377
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,539
idea of kind of how this works.

378
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,919
It's not that complicated.

379
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:29,970
It looks complicated when you

380
00:09:30,179 --> 00:09:30,669
first start off.

381
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,259
But especially if you've used even

382
00:09:32,259 --> 00:09:33,720
just Zapier, you can kind of see

383
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,029
the basics of how this sort of

384
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:35,740
operates.

385
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,169
We'll be over some more stuff

386
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:38,850
later on in this section, which is

387
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,490
just the enough to be dangerous

388
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:42,000
section to do with N8N.

389
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:43,919
Showing you kind of how these sort

390
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:45,279
of work and how to connect them

391
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:46,529
all together and when to use

392
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:47,919
certain nodes and, you know,

393
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,759
what's appropriate when it's not.

394
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:51,409
So keep moving on through the

395
00:09:51,509 --> 00:09:52,179
course.

396
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:54,269
Watch the rest of this one and

397
00:09:54,269 --> 00:09:55,269
keep at it.

398
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:56,470
If you have any questions, feel

399
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:57,440
free to reach out to me.

400
00:09:57,690 --> 00:09:59,289
Hit me up and we will get you

401
00:09:59,289 --> 00:10:00,460
sorted ASAP.

402
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:01,320
Thank you.

403
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:01,860
Peace.
