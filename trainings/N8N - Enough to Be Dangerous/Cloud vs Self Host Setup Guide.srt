1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,970
What's up guys, today, we're going

2
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:03,560
to be talking about where you

3
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:06,400
should host N8n, should you

4
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,720
do self hosted on your own server?

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,289
Or should you go through the N8n

6
00:00:10,289 --> 00:00:10,800
cloud?

7
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:11,519
So we're going to start

8
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:12,859
off by going through just the

9
00:00:12,859 --> 00:00:14,250
basic pros and cons of both.

10
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:15,759
And then I'm going to show you if

11
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:15,919
you

12
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:17,600
choose to do self hosted, how to

13
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,320
set that up.

14
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:19,910
It's very simple, but let's run

15
00:00:20,059 --> 00:00:20,820
through it.

16
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:21,280
So

17
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:22,739
let's look at self hosted, which

18
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:24,410
is the called the N8n community

19
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:25,039
edition.

20
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:26,160
There's zero software

21
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,000
costs aside from hosting it on the

22
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:28,559
server.

23
00:00:28,609 --> 00:00:30,149
This offer is open source and

24
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:31,280
free, you can run an

25
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,039
unlimited number of workflows and

26
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:33,820
executions.

27
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:35,270
This is the key part here, the

28
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:36,649
only constraints you have

29
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,179
are your server hardware.

30
00:00:38,179 --> 00:00:39,380
You've got full data and

31
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:41,350
infrastructure control yourself,

32
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:41,920
as long as you can

33
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,659
manage the server effectively.

34
00:00:43,659 --> 00:00:45,340
As highly customizable, you can

35
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:46,799
add custom code nodes and API

36
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:47,359
integrations,

37
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:48,799
custom nodes are very, very

38
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:49,329
helpful.

39
00:00:49,429 --> 00:00:51,039
People make their own N8n nodes

40
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:52,880
that you can install very easily

41
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,000
to give you access to other

42
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,530
platforms and features, having to

43
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:56,640
use direct API calls.

44
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,590
And it is much

45
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:00,420
lower in terms of cost.

46
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,109
You get a VPS from anywhere

47
00:01:02,109 --> 00:01:04,349
between five to $20 or euro per

48
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:05,120
month.

49
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,159
And overall,

50
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:07,290
it tends to work out a lot

51
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:07,859
cheaper.

52
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:09,560
The cons, however, is that it does

53
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,719
require time to set up,

54
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:11,920
and it is a bit more technical

55
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,319
effort, although not much, as I

56
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:14,560
will show you how to do it very

57
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:14,879
simply.

58
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,090
The hidden costs are mainly to the

59
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:20,400
hours installed, setting it up,

60
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,629
potential troubleshooting and

61
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,239
downtime.

62
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:23,890
It is missing enterprise features

63
00:01:23,969 --> 00:01:25,269
or collaboration tools.

64
00:01:25,269 --> 00:01:26,480
If you want to have multiple

65
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,420
people as part of a team using the

66
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:30,879
instance, much, much harder to do.

67
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:33,120
And some like audit logs, things

68
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:33,840
like that.

69
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,489
And there's no official support,

70
00:01:35,489 --> 00:01:37,099
aside from the community forum,

71
00:01:37,099 --> 00:01:38,560
compared to N8n Pro,

72
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,909
the cloud version where you do

73
00:01:39,909 --> 00:01:41,310
have an official forum, where

74
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,799
people that are working on N8n

75
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:42,879
will

76
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:43,840
get back to you with information.

77
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,560
So the cloud version, it's fully

78
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:48,239
managed, it's essentially an

79
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:50,180
instance setup, you sign up, you

80
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:51,769
pay, and it is ready to go.

81
00:01:51,769 --> 00:01:53,609
It is predictable pricing, it's

82
00:01:53,709 --> 00:01:53,959
got different

83
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:55,310
plans you choose from, you know

84
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:56,500
how much you're going to pay every

85
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,030
single month.

86
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,480
For instance, if you

87
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,799
are self hosting, and one

88
00:01:59,799 --> 00:02:01,310
automation has a ton of runs on

89
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:02,870
it, that can end up costing you

90
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:03,680
more money.

91
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,340
Whereas with the N8n plans, you'll

92
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:06,810
know exactly how many executions

93
00:02:06,829 --> 00:02:07,760
and how many workflows you're

94
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,659
allowed to use and how much it's

95
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:09,199
going to cost.

96
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,199
It does have an enterprise plan

97
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:12,159
that allows team

98
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:13,219
collaboration and things like

99
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,479
that, although not something we're

100
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:15,919
going to be going into here.

101
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:16,150
And

102
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:17,310
it does have very reliable

103
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:18,659
support, you can contact them

104
00:02:18,659 --> 00:02:19,229
directly.

105
00:02:19,229 --> 00:02:20,789
And there is a paid forum where,

106
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,120
as I said, N8n developers will get

107
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:22,719
back to you.

108
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:25,039
It is much more expensive though.

109
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:26,169
So the starter plan

110
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,129
is 24 year a month for 2.5k

111
00:02:28,129 --> 00:02:30,159
executions, it's about $26.

112
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:33,520
The pro is $50 to $60 for

113
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,180
10k executions and a more

114
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,449
workflows.

115
00:02:37,469 --> 00:02:40,250
The enterprise is like way, way

116
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:41,360
more is available by a quote.

117
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,060
Starter gives you five workflows,

118
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:46,259
the pro gives you 15, the

119
00:02:46,259 --> 00:02:47,759
enterprise is unlimited,

120
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:49,080
you do have less control in

121
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,219
general over your data

122
00:02:50,219 --> 00:02:52,000
infrastructure setup and custom

123
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,389
features.

124
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,870
So we look at the pricing

125
00:02:53,969 --> 00:02:54,930
comparison.

126
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:56,389
Again, we're looking at cost

127
00:02:56,539 --> 00:02:57,770
estimate of a cell phones to one

128
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,530
anywhere from $5 to $20 a month

129
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:01,009
for your VPS, which is a virtual

130
00:03:01,009 --> 00:03:02,000
private server.

131
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,210
The N8n starter cloud

132
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,330
is looking at 24 euro by $26 per

133
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:07,280
month, five workflows, 2.5k

134
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,069
executions and execution is the

135
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:10,889
number of times that our workflow

136
00:03:10,889 --> 00:03:11,289
is run.

137
00:03:11,289 --> 00:03:12,879
So you've got a total of 2500

138
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:13,360
runs.

139
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,319
This sounds like a lot,

140
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,539
but when you're testing out

141
00:03:15,539 --> 00:03:17,199
something, or something, you know,

142
00:03:17,349 --> 00:03:18,860
errors out and excuse a bunch of

143
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:19,199
times,

144
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,430
it can eat up pretty quickly.

145
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:21,810
And you've only got five workflows

146
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:22,879
and we are giving you guys a lot

147
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:23,039
more

148
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:24,319
than five workflows to use.

149
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,580
The pro cloud, if anywhere between

150
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:29,360
$50 to $65 is 15 workflows,

151
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,439
10,000 executions, and then

152
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:33,199
enterprise cloud is unlimited.

153
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:34,650
So we look at the feature

154
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:35,439
comparison.

155
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:37,750
Executions, self hosted, unlimited

156
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,430
clouds, cap by plan, active

157
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:41,840
workflows, self hosted, unlimited

158
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,479
cloud,

159
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:44,409
plans between 515 and unlimited on

160
00:03:44,409 --> 00:03:45,349
the enterprise.

161
00:03:45,509 --> 00:03:47,599
The number concurrent executions,

162
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:48,189
the self hosted is

163
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,870
server dependent, the cloud is 520

164
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:51,889
or 200.

165
00:03:51,889 --> 00:03:53,949
Then enterprise tools, single sign

166
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,439
on environments,

167
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:56,770
get log streaming, they're only

168
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:57,780
available in self hosted

169
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,840
enterprise or cloud enterprise and

170
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,240
support

171
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,210
community only versus email such

172
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:03,509
SLA backed in paid.

173
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:05,599
So basically in the self hosted,

174
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:05,840
you've got the

175
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,050
community support, but in the paid

176
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:10,330
cloud, you've got email supporting

177
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:12,400
email and developers or their own

178
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,280
forum.

179
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:15,000
So when to choose which self

180
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,160
hosted is best.

181
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,290
If you want full control of

182
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:18,089
customization,

183
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,550
you can manage infrastructure

184
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,029
reliably, and you need unlimited

185
00:04:21,189 --> 00:04:22,639
scale and lower ongoing costs.

186
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:22,879
I think

187
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:23,930
that is the biggest one and likely

188
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,040
something that you will need.

189
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,680
And then cloud is ideal.

190
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,250
If you prefer

191
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:29,779
convenience, and speed of setup

192
00:04:29,889 --> 00:04:31,439
and no maintenance, you need team

193
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:32,819
collaboration, support and

194
00:04:32,819 --> 00:04:33,519
reliability,

195
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:34,439
and you don't mind paying a bit

196
00:04:34,589 --> 00:04:35,439
more for managed services.

197
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:37,120
I think the only real drawback is

198
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:37,439
the team

199
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:39,290
collaboration, you do have that on

200
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:40,870
the NN cloud, but not so much in

201
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:42,050
the self hosted.

202
00:04:42,089 --> 00:04:43,120
A hybrid approach

203
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,540
you can take is you can prototype

204
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:45,899
your workflows in the cloud and

205
00:04:45,899 --> 00:04:47,519
then transition the critical ones

206
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:47,600
to

207
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,569
self hosted to help with cost

208
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:50,470
savings.

209
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:51,860
So overall, that's what we're

210
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:52,720
looking at here.

211
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,800
My personal

212
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,199
opinion is you guys should do self

213
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:56,649
hosted.

214
00:04:56,649 --> 00:04:58,050
It sounds complicated, but it's

215
00:04:58,050 --> 00:04:58,720
really not.

216
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,339
And in the next

217
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,459
part of the video, I'm going to

218
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,660
walk you guys through exactly how

219
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:02,879
to set this up easily in the

220
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:03,350
cheapest way

221
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,170
possible.

222
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:06,129
So now we're going to go through a

223
00:05:06,129 --> 00:05:07,949
few ways to set up N8N.

224
00:05:07,949 --> 00:05:10,129
If we go to the official N8N

225
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:10,420
website,

226
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,939
which will be a link to every site

227
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,350
I'm going to in the description

228
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:13,839
below.

229
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:15,449
So it's N8N.io go to the

230
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:16,879
pricing page, you'll see here the

231
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:18,060
different options as we talked

232
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:19,509
about the difference between each

233
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:19,920
of these

234
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,660
already.

235
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:22,779
But when I click start free trial,

236
00:05:22,779 --> 00:05:24,240
you simply fill out your

237
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,319
information here, and your free

238
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:27,360
trial will begin.

239
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:28,990
And then you'll be asked to put in

240
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:30,449
your card details in order to

241
00:05:30,459 --> 00:05:32,319
continue paying for the

242
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:32,949
plan.

243
00:05:32,949 --> 00:05:35,110
So then if we take a look at the

244
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:37,689
next option on my preferred one,

245
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,120
we're going to look at railway.

246
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,730
This is railway.com.

247
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:42,459
And it is very simple to set up

248
00:05:42,459 --> 00:05:44,829
N8N here, you essentially pay $5

249
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,959
for your account,

250
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:49,660
and then you will only pay for the

251
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:52,029
usage you actually use in total

252
00:05:52,029 --> 00:05:53,850
while running N8N on the server.

253
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:54,160
It is

254
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,699
usually using tons of resources,

255
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:59,670
no more than about $19 to $20 per

256
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:00,480
month.

257
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,839
But to get N8N set up,

258
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:03,199
it's very simple, you're going to

259
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:04,279
mouse over product and go to

260
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:04,959
templates.

261
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:07,439
When you scroll down,

262
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:08,889
one of the first thing you'll see

263
00:06:08,889 --> 00:06:10,519
is here is N8N with workers, this

264
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:11,430
is what we want.

265
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:12,399
We click this,

266
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:13,680
we're going to click deploy now.

267
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,319
We just click deploy, as you can

268
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,120
see everything's ready to be

269
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,089
deployed, it's all good to go.

270
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:18,579
Click deploy.

271
00:06:18,689 --> 00:06:21,500
And we'll watch as it actually

272
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,519
sets up the server here for us.

273
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:26,339
It's going to apply 101 changes.

274
00:06:26,449 --> 00:06:27,490
This might take a little bit so I

275
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:28,560
might cut out some time in this

276
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,279
video.

277
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:31,089
But basically set it up to go and

278
00:06:31,089 --> 00:06:32,750
it is now going to create a new

279
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:35,120
server with our N8N on it.

280
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:46,889
So you can see it's initializing

281
00:06:46,889 --> 00:06:48,079
now.

282
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:52,069
Okay, so let's talk about two

283
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:56,920
minutes to fully set up, very,

284
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,680
very short amount of time.

285
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:06,420
And now when I click primary here,

286
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:12,920
which is when you're always going

287
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,420
to want to click,

288
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:17,079
you'll see we've got a link here.

289
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:19,850
And when I click this, it will

290
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:23,040
take me to my N8N instance,

291
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,269
where it allows me to go through

292
00:07:24,269 --> 00:07:25,439
the onboarding process.

293
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:26,899
Just put in your details and

294
00:07:26,899 --> 00:07:27,519
you're done.

295
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:29,490
That's N8N set up, good to go.

296
00:07:29,589 --> 00:07:31,839
You will see your workflow screen.

297
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,230
The other option you have is

298
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,329
Hostinger, which offers a very

299
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:37,209
good VPS for N8N and is quite

300
00:07:37,209 --> 00:07:38,720
cheap to run as well.

301
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,680
You're probably

302
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,379
going to want to go for the $6.99

303
00:07:41,379 --> 00:07:42,029
a month plan.

304
00:07:42,029 --> 00:07:43,360
When you set this up, it's very

305
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:44,079
simple process as

306
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:45,449
well, very similar to Railway.

307
00:07:45,449 --> 00:07:46,879
You just simply click choose plan.

308
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,259
Now this is the way they do their

309
00:07:50,259 --> 00:07:51,600
pricing.

310
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,279
You can either pay upfront for two

311
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:53,600
years,

312
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,879
one year or one month.

313
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:57,920
I see one month's about $10.

314
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,800
I would recommend doing daily auto

315
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,639
backup because

316
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,430
again, I will be giving you a

317
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:05,029
script that will copy your

318
00:08:05,029 --> 00:08:07,029
workflows to GitHub or to Google

319
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:07,519
Drive,

320
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:08,680
but it's a good idea to have all

321
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,060
of your data backed up as well.

322
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:11,759
The auto backup is only $6 a

323
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:12,399
month,

324
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:13,519
probably worth it.

325
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:15,209
You'll select the location closest

326
00:08:15,209 --> 00:08:16,879
to you and then you'll choose N8N.

327
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:17,839
Then you'll do continue.

328
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,160
You'll sign into your account.

329
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,420
Let's do it here with one of my

330
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:21,920
accounts.

331
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,850
You'll fill out your details.

332
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,690
You will pay for the server and

333
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:36,960
it'll be automatically set up for

334
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:37,519
you.

335
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:38,658
So it's a pretty similar process

336
00:08:38,658 --> 00:08:39,360
for all of them.

337
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,759
That's why I think self-hosting is

338
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:42,149
the best way to

339
00:08:42,158 --> 00:08:42,440
go.

340
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,038
And I think Railway is definitely

341
00:08:44,038 --> 00:08:45,289
the best option to do it.

342
00:08:45,309 --> 00:08:46,399
It's very secure.

343
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,080
It's very, very good uptime,

344
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,049
very easy to update.

345
00:08:50,149 --> 00:08:51,259
If you ever want to update N8N,

346
00:08:51,259 --> 00:08:52,409
which there are regular updates

347
00:08:52,409 --> 00:08:52,960
rolled out,

348
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,129
you would literally just select

349
00:08:54,129 --> 00:08:56,059
your primary again, select here

350
00:08:56,059 --> 00:08:58,559
and click redeploy.

351
00:08:58,559 --> 00:08:59,200
And it will pull

352
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,600
the latest version of N8N and

353
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,169
deploy it.

354
00:09:01,269 --> 00:09:02,659
It takes maybe a minute or two for

355
00:09:02,659 --> 00:09:03,440
it to update and you're

356
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,399
good to go again.

357
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:06,289
So I would definitely highly

358
00:09:06,289 --> 00:09:08,340
suggest using Railway out of all

359
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,120
of them.

360
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:09,440
It is the

361
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,190
cheapest.

362
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,250
It is easy to run.

363
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,929
If I look at my usage and I have a

364
00:09:12,929 --> 00:09:15,279
lot of usage on my N8N account,

365
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,340
as you can see, we're looking at a

366
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:19,480
total bill of $26 and that's me

367
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,840
running thousands of executions

368
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,490
across hundreds of workflows.

369
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:25,269
So definitely would highly suggest

370
00:09:25,269 --> 00:09:26,639
you guys using Railway.

371
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:28,480
And if not,

372
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,080
if you want to just simple one

373
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,960
click N8N cloud on N8N.io is

374
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,759
probably the easiest way to get it

375
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:34,080
set up.

376
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:36,000
But this would be my, my

377
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,769
suggestion.

378
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:38,159
So hopefully this gives it up for

379
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:38,990
you guys.

380
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:40,460
And any problems

381
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,100
with this, feel free to reach out
