1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,060
What's up guys, Lucas here.

2
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:03,480
So I'm going to be showing you

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,459
what I think is maybe one of the

4
00:00:05,459 --> 00:00:06,360
most annoying parts of

5
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:08,080
self-hosting, which is that you

6
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,429
will have to, when you're

7
00:00:09,429 --> 00:00:11,699
connecting your Google nodes

8
00:00:11,699 --> 00:00:13,210
and your Google account, there

9
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:14,599
will be a little bit more setup

10
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:15,839
compared to if you're doing

11
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:17,179
it through the N8N cloud.

12
00:00:17,179 --> 00:00:18,589
So let me show you what that looks

13
00:00:18,589 --> 00:00:18,989
like.

14
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,190
So first of all, I already have a

15
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,480
Google account on here, but let's

16
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,399
just create a new one.

17
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:23,699
Now, when you click create new

18
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:25,109
credential, you're going to see

19
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:26,199
this, which looks very,

20
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:28,010
you know, threatening and kind of

21
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:28,679
ominous.

22
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:30,519
So first of all, the actual N8N

23
00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:32,130
documents in this are really

24
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:32,960
detailed.

25
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,909
So let's open these first and see

26
00:00:34,909 --> 00:00:36,200
what we need to do.

27
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,310
So the first thing we're going to

28
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:38,250
do is we're going to create a

29
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:39,479
Google cloud console project.

30
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:41,560
So you go to console.google.com.

31
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,299
Now I've got this open over here

32
00:00:43,299 --> 00:00:45,020
and I've made a new project to do

33
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:45,560
that.

34
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,009
You just click the project picker

35
00:00:47,009 --> 00:00:48,119
and click new project.

36
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:49,560
Once you're in here, let's go back

37
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,840
again and let's see what we're

38
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:51,460
going to do.

39
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:53,460
After it's created, we need to

40
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,460
enable the APIs for what we need

41
00:00:55,509 --> 00:00:56,409
to access.

42
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:59,200
So if you need to access, for

43
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,899
instance, your Google Sheets, your

44
00:01:02,899 --> 00:01:05,200
Google Docs, you have to enable

45
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:05,819
these in here.

46
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,359
And to do that, this was going to

47
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:08,950
click navigation menu, APIs and

48
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:10,299
services, enabled APIs and

49
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:11,019
services.

50
00:01:11,019 --> 00:01:12,870
And we'll click enable APIs and

51
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:14,500
services again up here.

52
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:17,099
So we'll start off with Google

53
00:01:17,099 --> 00:01:19,590
Drive API and we'll click enable.

54
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:23,719
That'll take a second to do.

55
00:01:23,719 --> 00:01:24,870
And when that's done, we're going

56
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:25,829
to enable some other ones.

57
00:01:25,879 --> 00:01:27,310
For now, you'll want to go through

58
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:28,819
and enable, you know, Google Docs

59
00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:30,239
and maybe Google Calendar for any

60
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:31,439
of your workflows using Google

61
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:31,980
Calendar.

62
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:33,599
But for now, I'm just going to go

63
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:35,359
and enable Google Sheets as well

64
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:37,180
because that's the node that we're

65
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,140
connecting.

66
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:40,329
So you can see Google Sheets API

67
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:42,019
here and we're going to click

68
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:42,680
enable.

69
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:50,269
Okay, so that's enabled now.

70
00:01:50,299 --> 00:01:50,939
We're all good.

71
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:52,980
So let's go back to the docs.

72
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:54,700
So when that's done, now to

73
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,500
configure our OAuth consent

74
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,260
screen.

75
00:01:57,359 --> 00:01:58,730
Now, this is probably the most

76
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:00,260
complicated part, but once you do

77
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:01,609
it once, it's done pretty much

78
00:02:01,609 --> 00:02:03,150
forever unless you're adding a new

79
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,180
Google account.

80
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:06,280
So we're going to go over to APIs

81
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:08,590
and services and we're going to go

82
00:02:08,689 --> 00:02:10,639
to OAuth consent screen.

83
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,039
Now, we're going to click get

84
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:14,060
started.

85
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:16,120
We're going to give it a name.

86
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,969
So just name it, you know, N8N,

87
00:02:17,969 --> 00:02:18,560
right?

88
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,039
Use a support email.

89
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:21,080
Just use your own email.

90
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,500
This is my test account.

91
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:25,069
For audience, let's select

92
00:02:25,099 --> 00:02:26,800
external so we're able to contact

93
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,500
our server with a host N8N.

94
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,490
Again, I'm just going to put my

95
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:32,340
test account for the contact

96
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,120
information and agree.

97
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:34,719
Continue.

98
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:35,840
Click create.

99
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:43,430
Okay.

100
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:45,319
So, again, follow the docs.

101
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:46,310
Let's see what it says next.

102
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,090
So we have the op name, the

103
00:02:48,099 --> 00:02:50,939
audience, email address, all done.

104
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,259
So the next thing we're going to

105
00:02:52,349 --> 00:02:53,310
do is we're going to go select

106
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:53,860
branding.

107
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:56,189
And for authorized domains, we're

108
00:02:56,189 --> 00:02:58,199
going to add our domain from our

109
00:02:58,199 --> 00:02:59,099
account.

110
00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:00,120
So, okay.

111
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,259
So on the left, we're going to

112
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,409
click branding and then we're

113
00:03:02,409 --> 00:03:03,599
going to scroll down to where we

114
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:04,800
have authorized domains.

115
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,419
And here we're just going to put

116
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:08,050
in railway.app as this is the

117
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:09,689
domain that is hosting our N8N

118
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:10,580
instance.

119
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,949
If you're using hostager, it'll

120
00:03:12,949 --> 00:03:15,310
obviously be the, you'll get the

121
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:17,430
domain name from the domain of

122
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,370
your actual thing here.

123
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:20,669
So that's what we're going to be

124
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:21,229
going for.

125
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,000
So railway.app is what we're going

126
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,919
to put in there.

127
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:26,300
After that, we click save and

128
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,580
that's done.

129
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:29,280
So next part.

130
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,439
So let's go to credentials.

131
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:34,349
We're going to create credentials

132
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:36,240
and create an OAuth client ID.

133
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:40,430
So if I go back to the console

134
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:43,169
here and we go to APIs and

135
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:47,090
services and credentials, we've

136
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:49,599
got no OAuth2 client IDs.

137
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,219
So we're going to set that up with

138
00:03:51,229 --> 00:03:52,780
the OAuth consent screen.

139
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:54,400
Create OAuth client.

140
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,800
Application type.

141
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:57,729
We're going to choose web

142
00:03:58,139 --> 00:03:58,300
application.

143
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:59,819
Name it.

144
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:00,919
N8N.

145
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:04,400
And then authorized redirect URLs.

146
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,000
This is what we got here.

147
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,770
This is our OAuth redirect URL.

148
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,139
So we're going to take that.

149
00:04:09,139 --> 00:04:10,210
We're going to put it in here.

150
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,960
And click create.

151
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,469
So now we've created our OAuth

152
00:04:13,469 --> 00:04:14,199
client ID.

153
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:15,789
We're going to copy the client ID

154
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:16,240
here.

155
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,110
We're going to go here and paste

156
00:04:18,129 --> 00:04:19,060
that there.

157
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:22,060
Then we're going to copy our

158
00:04:22,129 --> 00:04:23,279
client secret.

159
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:26,060
We're going to paste that there.

160
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:27,050
Now sign with Google is there, but

161
00:04:27,069 --> 00:04:28,149
we're not going to click that yet.

162
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,040
Instead, we are going to go to

163
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,339
audience.

164
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:34,379
We're going to publish the app.

165
00:04:34,379 --> 00:04:36,120
The reason we're doing this is so

166
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,790
that our server can contact the

167
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:38,220
app.

168
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,779
So now this should be good.

169
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:42,959
Now we go back here.

170
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:44,079
We're going to click sign in with

171
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:44,519
Google.

172
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:45,920
We're going to choose the account

173
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,040
of our Google account that's

174
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:47,980
registered here.

175
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:49,120
You'll get this screen.

176
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,079
It has verified the app.

177
00:04:50,139 --> 00:04:50,620
That's fine.

178
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:52,420
Click advanced and click go to

179
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:53,620
railway.app.

180
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:55,509
Give it the access.

181
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,439
Continue.

182
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:58,420
Done.

183
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:59,100
Right.

184
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,000
So we're all set up.

185
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,540
So that's how you do it.

186
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:02,180
Again, very simply

187
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:02,899
straightforward.

188
00:05:02,899 --> 00:05:04,959
It seems complicated, but all

189
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:07,029
you're going to do is you're going

190
00:05:07,029 --> 00:05:09,600
to go to create a new project

191
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,009
because you're going to create a

192
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:11,819
new project.

193
00:05:11,819 --> 00:05:13,389
Then you're going to enable the

194
00:05:13,389 --> 00:05:14,300
APIs you want.

195
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,720
Then you're going to configure the

196
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:16,819
OAuth consent screen.

197
00:05:16,819 --> 00:05:18,439
Put it in railway.app or

198
00:05:18,509 --> 00:05:20,040
hostendure.com.

199
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,540
Or whatever the URL is for your

200
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:22,399
accepted URL.

201
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:24,509
Then you are going to add the

202
00:05:24,589 --> 00:05:26,910
credentials by creating a new

203
00:05:27,009 --> 00:05:28,540
OAuth client ID.

204
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:29,529
You've got the client ID, the

205
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:30,149
client secret.

206
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,459
You paste those back in.

207
00:05:31,459 --> 00:05:33,100
You make sure the app is published

208
00:05:33,149 --> 00:05:34,860
so it's available for it to use.

209
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,350
And then you sign in with Google

210
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:37,600
and you're good to go.

211
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:39,680
So hopefully that helps you kind

212
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,899
of walk through this.

213
00:05:40,899 --> 00:05:41,750
Now, again, if you're using a

214
00:05:41,889 --> 00:05:42,769
different Google account, you have

215
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:43,579
to do the same thing again

216
00:05:43,579 --> 00:05:44,680
on the different Google account.

217
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,490
But that is the basics of how it

218
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:48,379
works and how you connect it all

219
00:05:48,379 --> 00:05:48,819
up.

220
00:05:50,339 --> 00:05:51,459
This should be something that you

221
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:52,529
only have to do for self-hosting

222
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:52,860
N8N.

223
00:05:52,899 --> 00:05:54,040
If you're on the N8N cloud, then

224
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:55,170
you'll automatically be able to

225
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:56,079
sign in with Google.

226
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:57,149
You won't have to put in this

227
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,350
client ID and client secret and

228
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:58,819
stuff.

229
00:05:58,819 --> 00:06:01,339
But that's one of the downsides of

230
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:03,230
using self-hosting.

231
00:06:03,259 --> 00:06:04,129
But obviously there's a lot of

232
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:04,889
upsides too as we discussed

233
00:06:04,949 --> 00:06:05,339
before.

234
00:06:05,339 --> 00:06:07,720
So hopefully this is useful.

235
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,139
And any problems with this, feel

236
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,379
free to reach out to me and I will

237
00:06:10,379 --> 00:06:11,100
walk you through it again.

238
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:11,959
Thanks, guys.

239
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:12,500
Peace.
