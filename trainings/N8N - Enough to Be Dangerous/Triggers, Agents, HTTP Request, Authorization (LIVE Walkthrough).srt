1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,600
What's up, guys?

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:03,000
Lucas here.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,639
So today I'm going to be showing

4
00:00:04,639 --> 00:00:05,860
you an existing workflow

5
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:06,849
we have.

6
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:08,410
I'm a great believer in general of

7
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:10,029
showing things practically and,

8
00:00:10,029 --> 00:00:10,599
you know,

9
00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:11,689
breaking down the exact use case

10
00:00:11,779 --> 00:00:12,779
for them rather than just learning

11
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:13,550
the theory behind

12
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:13,960
things.

13
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:16,050
So for this, I'm going to be

14
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:18,620
showing you a workflow that takes

15
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:20,300
a message from Telegram

16
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:22,010
and writes a LinkedIn post based

17
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:23,579
around the idea you've sent to

18
00:00:23,579 --> 00:00:25,219
Telegram and then sends

19
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,010
it to LinkedIn and lets you know

20
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:27,670
about it.

21
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:29,250
So we're going to start off by

22
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:30,120
breaking down

23
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:30,980
the workflow and then showing you

24
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:31,589
how to get it working.

25
00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:32,298
As you can see, there's a few

26
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:33,439
notes here that are red, and I'm

27
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,490
going to explain why that is what

28
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:35,159
we do to fix them.

29
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:36,810
So let's start off by just an

30
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:39,000
overview of what the workflow does

31
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:39,840
in total.

32
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:40,859
So the trigger

33
00:00:40,859 --> 00:00:42,460
referred is a Telegram message.

34
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:44,000
So sending a message to a Telegram

35
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,060
bot starts the whole

36
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:45,500
flow.

37
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,240
Then this LinkedIn post agent will

38
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:48,280
write the post.

39
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,979
This agent will write the title

40
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:50,179
for

41
00:00:50,179 --> 00:00:50,909
the post.

42
00:00:50,909 --> 00:00:52,869
Then this tool will create a nice

43
00:00:52,869 --> 00:00:53,530
Google doc.

44
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,320
It will move it to the correct

45
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:55,820
folder.

46
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:56,929
And then it will send you a

47
00:00:57,009 --> 00:00:58,429
message to Telegram asking you if

48
00:00:58,429 --> 00:01:00,000
you want to approve the post for

49
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,600
posting.

50
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,179
If you say yes, it will prepare it

51
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:04,019
for the LinkedIn content queue.

52
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:05,019
If not, it just marks

53
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:06,349
the automation as done.

54
00:01:06,349 --> 00:01:07,760
Then it'll create the post and

55
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:09,180
then it will send you a text

56
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:09,939
message telling

57
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,890
you that it's been posted.

58
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:12,640
So let's start off by looking at

59
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,060
the Telegram trigger.

60
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:14,819
Zoom in here.

61
00:01:14,819 --> 00:01:15,719
Double click.

62
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:17,189
You can see here we've got no

63
00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:18,900
credentials for Telegram.

64
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:20,120
So we're going to create a new

65
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:20,659
credential.

66
00:01:20,659 --> 00:01:22,719
And as always, you see we've got

67
00:01:22,939 --> 00:01:23,250
access token

68
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:24,230
in base URL, but we're going to do

69
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:25,250
what I always suggest, which is

70
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:26,819
reading the docs that will

71
00:01:26,859 --> 00:01:27,829
give you the step-by-step

72
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:29,219
walkthrough of how to set this up.

73
00:01:29,219 --> 00:01:31,060
So to generate our access token,

74
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:32,079
we start a chat with the bot

75
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:33,459
father and then enter new bot.

76
00:01:33,459 --> 00:01:35,420
So let's click bot father.

77
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:35,560
It's

78
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,099
going to open my Telegram here.

79
00:01:37,099 --> 00:01:38,540
We're going to click start.

80
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:41,439
From here, we're going to do new

81
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:41,780
bot.

82
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:43,170
What are we going to call it?

83
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,180
Please choose a name.

84
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,849
So let's just say CA N8N, right?

85
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:50,340
Username was NN bot.

86
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:55,769
So CA N8N bot done.

87
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:58,299
So now we've got our access token.

88
00:01:58,299 --> 00:02:00,579
So that was super simple,

89
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:01,370
super easy.

90
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:02,420
Let's copy this.

91
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:03,930
Let's go back here and paste this

92
00:02:04,099 --> 00:02:05,739
in as the access token and save

93
00:02:05,739 --> 00:02:05,939
it.

94
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,340
Done, right?

95
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,840
So now when we send a message to

96
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:14,000
that bot, which is now in our, or

97
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,979
should be in our Telegram,

98
00:02:14,979 --> 00:02:17,159
we click this and click start,

99
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:19,509
this is now our bot where we will

100
00:02:19,509 --> 00:02:21,379
send our messages, right?

101
00:02:21,379 --> 00:02:24,979
So next thing,

102
00:02:24,979 --> 00:02:26,199
I'm going to break down just what

103
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:27,719
this LinkedIn post agent does.

104
00:02:27,949 --> 00:02:30,099
So if we go here, you can see it's

105
00:02:30,099 --> 00:02:31,210
set as a tools

106
00:02:31,219 --> 00:02:33,080
agent, and we have a prompt and a

107
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:35,199
system message, a user message, a

108
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:36,419
system message.

109
00:02:36,419 --> 00:02:37,219
If you set it to expression,

110
00:02:37,219 --> 00:02:38,379
set it to expression, then click

111
00:02:38,409 --> 00:02:39,400
this little button here, we're

112
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:41,300
going to be able to see what the

113
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:41,460
whole

114
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:42,020
thing looks like.

115
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,199
So let's change that to message.

116
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,659
Let's read what this says goal.

117
00:02:46,659 --> 00:02:47,860
Take the idea

118
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:48,620
provided and turn it into a

119
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:49,120
LinkedIn post.

120
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:50,039
Remember that I am Lucas Sennett

121
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:50,819
and I'm writing the first

122
00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:51,120
person.

123
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:51,979
Use the general idea, topic,

124
00:02:52,009 --> 00:02:52,969
combine your system of knowledge,

125
00:02:52,969 --> 00:02:54,020
create a high performing LinkedIn

126
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:54,400
post.

127
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:55,879
Format the output according to the

128
00:02:55,969 --> 00:02:57,539
LinkedIn frameworks provided,

129
00:02:57,849 --> 00:02:58,259
including a stronghold,

130
00:02:58,259 --> 00:02:59,289
clear structure, and engaging

131
00:02:59,449 --> 00:02:59,789
conclusion.

132
00:02:59,789 --> 00:03:00,610
It's supposed to be purely

133
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:01,219
text-based.

134
00:03:01,219 --> 00:03:02,150
Write the copy in the voice and

135
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,090
character that myself, Lucas

136
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:03,960
Sennett would have when writing

137
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:04,560
content.

138
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:05,710
It sounds real, naturalized

139
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:06,889
without using a real to human,

140
00:03:06,889 --> 00:03:07,699
human conversation,

141
00:03:07,699 --> 00:03:08,830
as the owner of a marketing

142
00:03:08,889 --> 00:03:09,289
agency.

143
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:10,409
In response to include any

144
00:03:10,409 --> 00:03:11,780
formatting or odd characters,

145
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:13,219
be sure to only reply to the post

146
00:03:13,219 --> 00:03:14,520
copy, don't include any other

147
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:15,699
texts or explanations.

148
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:15,939
Like here

149
00:03:15,939 --> 00:03:16,740
we have message.

150
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:18,090
And the reason for that is that we

151
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:19,439
are going to send a message to the

152
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:20,500
Telegram bot.

153
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,860
And then we're going to, from over

154
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:23,080
here, you'll see the Telegram

155
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:23,620
trigger.

156
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,740
We're going to get the

157
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:25,710
message here and paste it in

158
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:26,169
there.

159
00:03:26,169 --> 00:03:27,449
So it'll send the message to our

160
00:03:27,449 --> 00:03:27,860
agent.

161
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,210
Let's look at the system

162
00:03:29,219 --> 00:03:30,240
message first.

163
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,960
Tells it that you are a persuasive

164
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,409
LinkedIn content strategist.

165
00:03:34,409 --> 00:03:35,129
Use the following

166
00:03:35,139 --> 00:03:36,710
internal reference documents.

167
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:38,419
Then we have information about me.

168
00:03:38,419 --> 00:03:39,860
This is just my background

169
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,229
and some information.

170
00:03:41,259 --> 00:03:43,090
Then we have a reference document

171
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:44,599
on writing high converting

172
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:45,699
LinkedIn posts

173
00:03:45,699 --> 00:03:46,789
and how to do that.

174
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,419
It's just information on what

175
00:03:48,419 --> 00:03:49,620
makes a good post.

176
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:51,300
It's got some examples,

177
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,770
some frameworks overall, things

178
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:54,629
like that.

179
00:03:54,949 --> 00:03:55,770
Also, we're going to add in

180
00:03:58,099 --> 00:04:01,669
reference document one, you can

181
00:04:01,669 --> 00:04:03,289
send it.

182
00:04:03,289 --> 00:04:04,020
There we go.

183
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:07,349
And this is connected to the open

184
00:04:07,949 --> 00:04:09,099
writer chat module, which is

185
00:04:09,099 --> 00:04:10,740
connected to cloud 3.7 sonnet.

186
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:13,960
Then this one just writes the

187
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,060
title.

188
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:16,420
So turn the LinkedIn post below

189
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:17,560
into a 3-7 word title.

190
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:17,699
We can

191
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:18,480
insert as the title of the

192
00:04:18,629 --> 00:04:19,509
document that has this LinkedIn

193
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:20,259
post inside of it.

194
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:21,029
Don't respond to anything

195
00:04:21,139 --> 00:04:22,740
other than the completed 3-7 word

196
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:23,149
title.

197
00:04:23,149 --> 00:04:24,930
That 3-7 word title should be the

198
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:25,939
only thing in your response.

199
00:04:25,939 --> 00:04:27,180
The LinkedIn post, and then we're

200
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:28,370
going to have the LinkedIn post in

201
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:28,660
there.

202
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,839
And that is connected to the

203
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:33,540
DeepSeq R1 free model.

204
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:34,500
Again, because this is a very

205
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:34,980
lightweight,

206
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,329
small task, isn't super important.

207
00:04:36,329 --> 00:04:37,459
So we're going to use DeepSeq,

208
00:04:37,459 --> 00:04:38,660
which is a good free AI.

209
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:41,089
And then over here, we've got the

210
00:04:41,089 --> 00:04:41,860
HTTP request.

211
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,110
And what this is doing is actually

212
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,259
sending our,

213
00:04:44,259 --> 00:04:47,000
the text we output is what we call

214
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,980
markdown, which is, you probably

215
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:50,819
have seen it's like hashtags and

216
00:04:50,819 --> 00:04:51,779
stuff and weird formatting.

217
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,459
So we're going to send that to

218
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:57,160
this service called md2doc.n8n.

219
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:58,240
And what this

220
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:00,459
does is it creates a very nice

221
00:05:00,459 --> 00:05:02,480
Google Doc in our Google Doc

222
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,459
account.

223
00:05:03,459 --> 00:05:05,060
So you can see there,

224
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:05,990
my Google Docs account is

225
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,240
connected, and it'll make the nice

226
00:05:07,389 --> 00:05:08,389
post blah, blah, blah.

227
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,259
Then it's going to

228
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:12,089
move the file to the correct

229
00:05:12,089 --> 00:05:14,279
folder called LinkedIn posts.

230
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:16,430
Then it will send us a message and

231
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:17,060
wait for

232
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:17,720
the response.

233
00:05:17,779 --> 00:05:18,790
If you want to approve of the

234
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:20,199
posting, if that's true, you can

235
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:20,899
see here, it says,

236
00:05:20,899 --> 00:05:22,490
here's the poster that's posted,

237
00:05:22,569 --> 00:05:24,089
I'll have a link there, the child

238
00:05:24,089 --> 00:05:25,139
ID we're going to get from our

239
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:26,180
trigger.

240
00:05:26,329 --> 00:05:29,250
And it's also approval options.

241
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:32,240
So approve, and then approval,

242
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,310
approve and disprove.

243
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:35,379
So approve or

244
00:05:35,379 --> 00:05:36,180
decline, right?

245
00:05:36,189 --> 00:05:36,819
Very simple.

246
00:05:36,819 --> 00:05:39,910
And then depending on that, this

247
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:42,810
will say, if the approved is true

248
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:43,740
or false,

249
00:05:43,779 --> 00:05:45,529
will determine if it gets sent for

250
00:05:45,529 --> 00:05:46,420
preparation.

251
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:48,149
Here, all this is going to do is

252
00:05:48,149 --> 00:05:48,819
just give us some

253
00:05:48,819 --> 00:05:50,420
of the it's going to just format

254
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:52,149
like the content type, text, the

255
00:05:52,449 --> 00:05:54,420
doc URL, the credit day, just

256
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:54,660
giving

257
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,430
us some overall information that

258
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:56,839
we need.

259
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,680
And then it's going to create the

260
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,019
post and we have to connect

261
00:06:00,019 --> 00:06:01,720
our LinkedIn as well.

262
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,839
So finally, it'll send a text

263
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:05,970
message back to us with saying

264
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:07,139
that it's been posted

265
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:08,740
and it's good to go.

266
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:09,759
All right.

267
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,939
So let us start with sending a

268
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:14,420
message to the Telegram bot.

269
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:14,560
So

270
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:19,480
a LinkedIn post about the power of

271
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,579
AI for agency owners, reducing

272
00:06:22,579 --> 00:06:27,050
overhead and staff hiring costs

273
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:27,459
while

274
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,459
increasing efficiency.

275
00:06:29,459 --> 00:06:31,829
So we're going to send that.

276
00:06:31,829 --> 00:06:34,579
Now, when this is active and on,

277
00:06:34,579 --> 00:06:35,139
this here currently

278
00:06:35,139 --> 00:06:36,399
is inactive, that will run

279
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:37,290
automatically.

280
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:38,480
But for now, we can do is we can

281
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:39,779
just use this as a test

282
00:06:39,779 --> 00:06:40,220
event.

283
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:41,629
So you can see here, it's got my

284
00:06:41,629 --> 00:06:43,110
most recent message, right?

285
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:44,250
And we're doing this.

286
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:44,500
The reason

287
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,470
we have it's activated is we don't

288
00:06:45,629 --> 00:06:46,490
want the whole thing to run yet.

289
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:47,779
We want to test this step by step.

290
00:06:48,339 --> 00:06:50,069
And if you update a few things.

291
00:06:50,069 --> 00:06:51,829
So as mentioned here, we need to

292
00:06:52,019 --> 00:06:53,699
get the message in the user

293
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:54,180
prompt.

294
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,920
So we're going to drag text here,

295
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,509
as you can see there, that's what

296
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:59,139
the message is going to be.

297
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:00,259
Right.

298
00:07:00,329 --> 00:07:03,610
So that we can now run this.

299
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:06,500
So like a second to do or so.

300
00:07:12,019 --> 00:07:12,740
Good, we're done.

301
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:16,100
So now here, we've got a post.

302
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:19,139
And we have to tell this to, yeah,

303
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:21,170
it's going to write the title now

304
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:22,420
using Deep Seek.

305
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,699
There we go.

306
00:07:25,699 --> 00:07:26,980
So we've got a nice title.

307
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,980
And finally, we have our Google

308
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,569
Docs creator here.

309
00:07:30,579 --> 00:07:32,079
So what this is doing is it's

310
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:33,920
going to take the output from the

311
00:07:34,509 --> 00:07:35,990
LinkedIn post agent, the text

312
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:36,300
output

313
00:07:36,339 --> 00:07:37,939
from the LinkedIn post agent, and

314
00:07:38,009 --> 00:07:39,410
that is going to be the contents

315
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:40,079
of the doc.

316
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:41,220
Then for the name,

317
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,699
we're going to get the output of

318
00:07:42,699 --> 00:07:44,259
the LinkedIn post title doc.

319
00:07:44,259 --> 00:07:46,579
So when we execute that now,

320
00:07:46,579 --> 00:07:52,709
it's going to create our Google

321
00:07:52,709 --> 00:07:53,230
doc.

322
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:55,579
I can actually open this and show

323
00:07:55,579 --> 00:07:56,259
you guys.

324
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,899
There you go.

325
00:07:58,899 --> 00:07:59,000
Right.

326
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,819
So that's our posts.

327
00:08:00,819 --> 00:08:02,339
Okay.

328
00:08:02,339 --> 00:08:03,939
So we're all good with that.

329
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:06,610
Let's go back to the

330
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:07,540
C A N N N.

331
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:10,519
So now we have it correctly set

332
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,129
up.

333
00:08:11,139 --> 00:08:12,019
Then we're going to move it to the

334
00:08:12,019 --> 00:08:13,060
correct folder.

335
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,279
So we're going to do is this is

336
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:15,620
the going to move the file.

337
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,660
So we're doing Google drive

338
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:17,050
account

339
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:19,139
resource file operation, move by

340
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:19,459
ID.

341
00:08:19,459 --> 00:08:21,279
And we're getting the ID from our

342
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:23,220
HTTP request here from the

343
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,250
list, my drive.

344
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:26,370
Now for here, I need to refresh

345
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:28,490
this because this is from an old

346
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:29,779
automation,

347
00:08:29,779 --> 00:08:34,820
we're going to move this to a new

348
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:34,950
folder here.

349
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:35,379
So we're going to move to the

350
00:08:35,379 --> 00:08:36,000
client extension AI

351
00:08:36,019 --> 00:08:36,658
folder for now.

352
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:38,580
Execute step.

353
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,100
So now it's moved appropriately.

354
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:40,490
Right.

355
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,298
So now we need to send a

356
00:08:43,298 --> 00:08:45,360
message and get the response.

357
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,330
So let's look and see where our

358
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:48,690
chat ID is.

359
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,299
So chat ID is over here.

360
00:08:51,299 --> 00:08:52,450
This is coming from our telegram

361
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:52,879
trigger.

362
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:53,980
So what this means is it's going

363
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,139
to send this message back

364
00:08:55,139 --> 00:08:56,740
to our telegram.

365
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:59,769
So chat ID goes in there and it's

366
00:08:59,769 --> 00:09:02,340
going to send, we want to say,

367
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:02,740
here's a link to

368
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:04,600
post you'd like to post it.

369
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:06,070
So how do we show the LinkedIn

370
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:07,139
post?

371
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:08,899
We want to send a link to the

372
00:09:08,899 --> 00:09:09,460
Google

373
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:09,779
doc.

374
00:09:09,779 --> 00:09:11,029
So we go to the HTTP request,

375
00:09:11,029 --> 00:09:12,519
which is where it was creating our

376
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:13,299
Google doc.

377
00:09:13,389 --> 00:09:14,100
You get the URL.

378
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:18,220
So now we go, here's the post.

379
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,220
You'd like to approve it.

380
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:20,259
And the link to the Google doc.

381
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:21,860
And then we get the approve and

382
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:22,700
disapprove.

383
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,179
So we execute this step now.

384
00:09:24,179 --> 00:09:28,340
I've got it here, right?

385
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:28,909
So I've got a link.

386
00:09:28,909 --> 00:09:29,899
Here's the post like to post it,

387
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,980
got a link to it.

388
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:32,179
And let's say let's approve it.

389
00:09:32,179 --> 00:09:32,580
Right.

390
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:35,169
So when I do that, it's going to

391
00:09:35,169 --> 00:09:35,899
open a webhook.

392
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:36,340
Got it.

393
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:36,659
Thanks.

394
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,259
Let's go back here.

395
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:39,990
Proved equals true.

396
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:42,820
So is the LinkedIn post approved?

397
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:43,690
Yes.

398
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:45,460
Data approved,

399
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:45,889
right.

400
00:09:45,889 --> 00:09:47,269
So without scanning from is the

401
00:09:47,269 --> 00:09:48,789
last step, the semester, we should

402
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:50,179
wait for response.

403
00:09:50,179 --> 00:09:52,149
The data is approved is true.

404
00:09:52,149 --> 00:09:54,269
So based on data approved is equal

405
00:09:54,269 --> 00:09:54,980
to true.

406
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,019
Then it moves forward

407
00:09:56,019 --> 00:09:56,889
with the automation.

408
00:09:56,919 --> 00:09:58,110
If that was set to false, it would

409
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:59,299
stop the automation there.

410
00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:00,659
If we go here,

411
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:03,399
execute the step here is we've got

412
00:10:03,629 --> 00:10:06,500
the content texts, the text of our

413
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:06,980
thing.

414
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,580
We got the document URL,

415
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,759
schedule time for it, status, and

416
00:10:10,909 --> 00:10:12,259
the created date.

417
00:10:12,259 --> 00:10:13,460
So our content is prepared.

418
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,259
So what we're going to do now

419
00:10:14,259 --> 00:10:15,190
is we're going to create the post.

420
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:16,129
As you can see, it's read it out.

421
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:17,000
So we have to get our credentials

422
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:17,789
connected.

423
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:18,889
So to do that, we're going to

424
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:20,340
create a new LinkedIn credential

425
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:24,500
and turn off the organization

426
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,029
support.

427
00:10:25,129 --> 00:10:26,360
We're going to click connect my

428
00:10:26,419 --> 00:10:26,929
account.

429
00:10:26,929 --> 00:10:30,100
We're going to click allow, right?

430
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:30,500
As you can see,

431
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,649
connection successful.

432
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:32,950
It'll close in five seconds.

433
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:34,259
We'll close that ourselves.

434
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,620
Accounts connected.

435
00:10:43,379 --> 00:10:43,710
Great.

436
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:44,740
So we had a little bit of a hiccup

437
00:10:44,779 --> 00:10:45,980
there to refresh the list, but you

438
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:46,340
can see here,

439
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:47,740
we've got LinkedIn account

440
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:49,529
resource post operation, create

441
00:10:49,529 --> 00:10:50,429
post as person.

442
00:10:50,429 --> 00:10:51,539
And then person is obviously

443
00:10:51,539 --> 00:10:53,970
me and the text of the posts we're

444
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:56,710
going to get from here.

445
00:10:56,710 --> 00:11:01,059
You can see, that's what it's

446
00:11:01,059 --> 00:11:01,460
going to look

447
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:04,200
like in a category, none.

448
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,509
So we're going to execute the

449
00:11:06,509 --> 00:11:07,120
step.

450
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,990
It's going to make the posts.

451
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:10,580
I go to

452
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,759
LinkedIn and go to my account.

453
00:11:12,909 --> 00:11:13,929
Here it is.

454
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,580
Now let's take a quick look at the

455
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:17,299
URL for this.

456
00:11:17,299 --> 00:11:17,700
As you can see,

457
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,460
here's the URL we're looking at.

458
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:21,779
LinkedIn.com/feed/urlactivity.

459
00:11:21,779 --> 00:11:22,580
Now we're going to want to copy

460
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:22,820
this,

461
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:23,460
right?

462
00:11:23,539 --> 00:11:24,620
For the next part of our

463
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:25,460
automation.

464
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:27,940
So that's done successfully.

465
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:29,379
If I want to send a text message,

466
00:11:29,379 --> 00:11:30,820
we're going to get the chat ID

467
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,340
from our telegram trigger.

468
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,539
Again, we're just going to drag

469
00:11:33,539 --> 00:11:33,940
over

470
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:34,889
ID from the chat.

471
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,679
Post created successfully, find it

472
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,129
here.

473
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:38,820
And we're going to paste in this,

474
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:40,899
followed by this.

475
00:11:40,899 --> 00:11:43,139
We're just going to go right after

476
00:11:43,139 --> 00:11:43,620
it.

477
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,850
So this will now give us the

478
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:47,179
proper

479
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,590
URL that we need.

480
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:50,929
So if I execute the step now, we

481
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,940
go back to telegram.

482
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:54,019
Here it is.

483
00:11:54,899 --> 00:11:55,620
Here's the link.

484
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,080
There's the post.

485
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:58,240
So there we go.

486
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,580
Just delete this because I don't

487
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:00,980
really want to post

488
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:01,460
this right now.

489
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,559
That's how that automation works.

490
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:05,379
And hopefully that'll explain a

491
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:06,340
bit about you to

492
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:07,929
you about how to set up these,

493
00:12:08,009 --> 00:12:11,409
these, you know, authentication on

494
00:12:11,409 --> 00:12:13,769
these, how these different agents

495
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:14,580
work.

496
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,840
How, what this node is doing here

497
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:19,019
is creating our nice Google docs

498
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,220
and how to make approval

499
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:21,779
workflows.

500
00:12:21,779 --> 00:12:22,919
That will, you know, you can

501
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:23,960
approve things we post or not

502
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:25,340
depending on the message sent to

503
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:25,769
you

504
00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:26,899
by whatever platform you like.

505
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:28,480
You can also do this in Slack.

506
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,539
I do this in Slack primarily,

507
00:12:29,539 --> 00:12:30,320
because that's where most of my

508
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:30,740
work goes on.

509
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,100
So instead of using telegram as

510
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,379
the main, you know,

511
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:34,980
conversation point or approval

512
00:12:35,049 --> 00:12:36,120
point, I use Slack.

513
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:38,980
But that's basically ideas behind

514
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:39,539
some of the kind of

515
00:12:39,539 --> 00:12:40,269
key things you're going to be

516
00:12:40,269 --> 00:12:41,059
doing as part of this, mainly a

517
00:12:41,059 --> 00:12:41,860
lot of what you're going to be

518
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:42,100
doing,

519
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,250
because we're giving you these

520
00:12:43,289 --> 00:12:44,250
workflows is going to be

521
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:45,429
customizing them and

522
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,570
authenticating your own

523
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:47,129
accounts.

524
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:48,129
So that's one of the most

525
00:12:48,129 --> 00:12:49,320
important things that you can

526
00:12:49,539 --> 00:12:50,570
learn is just how to quickly

527
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:51,539
authenticate things.

528
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,110
And again, I really think the best

529
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:54,570
way to do that is always going to

530
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,139
be just

531
00:12:55,139 --> 00:12:56,940
create a new credential and read

532
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,799
the docs, the NADN documents for

533
00:12:59,059 --> 00:13:00,019
every document for every single

534
00:13:00,019 --> 00:13:00,649
account.

535
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:02,190
And they're step by step walking

536
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:03,220
through them.

537
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,820
Very, very easy to set up.

538
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,899
And again,

539
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:07,769
we're gonna be talking a bit more

540
00:13:07,769 --> 00:13:08,340
about AI agents.

541
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:10,039
But as you can see here, it's

542
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:10,889
really just a user

543
00:13:10,899 --> 00:13:12,080
message and a system message.

544
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:13,350
The system message tells the agent

545
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:14,460
all the information it needs to

546
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,659
know before it receives your user

547
00:13:16,659 --> 00:13:17,409
message.

548
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:19,399
So it needs to know that it is a,

549
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:20,500
you know, LinkedIn

550
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,929
content strategist, it needs some

551
00:13:21,929 --> 00:13:23,240
information on headwrite LinkedIn

552
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:25,299
posts, some information about me

553
00:13:25,299 --> 00:13:26,649
or you specifically to personalize

554
00:13:26,649 --> 00:13:27,139
it to you.

555
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:29,330
And it's overall provided the

556
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:30,710
structure it needs to create

557
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:31,710
the best output possible.

558
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,690
And then your user message is

559
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:33,940
going to give it the instructions

560
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:34,259
on what you

561
00:13:34,259 --> 00:13:35,299
want it to do with the information

562
00:13:35,409 --> 00:13:35,850
you're giving it.

563
00:13:35,929 --> 00:13:36,850
So we're telling it to create a

564
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:37,779
LinkedIn post,

565
00:13:37,779 --> 00:13:38,730
we're going to do some information

566
00:13:38,899 --> 00:13:39,529
about the formatting, some

567
00:13:39,529 --> 00:13:41,299
warnings, and then giving it

568
00:13:41,299 --> 00:13:43,480
the actual text of our, you know,

569
00:13:43,629 --> 00:13:45,309
and what we want the post to be

570
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,629
about.

571
00:13:46,629 --> 00:13:48,980
I'll provide a link in the

572
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,570
description to the information on

573
00:13:50,649 --> 00:13:52,309
this particular tool, because this

574
00:13:52,549 --> 00:13:53,899
is a custom tool someone made

575
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:54,539
that I love.

576
00:13:54,659 --> 00:13:55,960
Because just sending you can, of

577
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,269
course, to send something to be

578
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,779
create a Google Drive

579
00:13:59,779 --> 00:14:01,029
document directly.

580
00:14:01,029 --> 00:14:02,519
But often you get that annoying

581
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:04,700
markdown formatting, this creates

582
00:14:04,779 --> 00:14:05,299
really nicely

583
00:14:05,299 --> 00:14:06,269
forming a Google Docs for you.

584
00:14:06,269 --> 00:14:07,159
So you don't have to do that.

585
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:09,860
So I think that's a very useful

586
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:10,179
tool to

587
00:14:10,179 --> 00:14:10,610
have.

588
00:14:10,789 --> 00:14:12,330
And yeah, you know, I think that

589
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:14,000
hopefully kind of cleared up and

590
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,379
maybe some questions you had

591
00:14:15,379 --> 00:14:16,330
about kind of editing these

592
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:16,830
workflows.

593
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:17,889
In the next video, I'm going to

594
00:14:17,889 --> 00:14:18,720
take one of the existing workflows

595
00:14:19,059 --> 00:14:20,259
you guys are going to get access

596
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:21,450
to you, or you guys are going to

597
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:22,820
get access to break it down,

598
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:23,789
and show you how to edit it for

599
00:14:24,009 --> 00:14:24,419
yourself.

600
00:14:24,419 --> 00:14:26,149
And make sure that it's all set up

601
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,139
for you to use.

602
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,120
So I hope this was helpful and I

603
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,139
will see you in the next one.

604
00:14:30,139 --> 00:14:30,659
Peace.
