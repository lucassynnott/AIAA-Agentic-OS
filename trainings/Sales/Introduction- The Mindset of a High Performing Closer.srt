1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,040
What's going on, guys?

2
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:01,950
My name is Dan Crowley.

3
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:02,859
You're going to be seeing a lot

4
00:00:02,859 --> 00:00:03,200
more of me

5
00:00:03,279 --> 00:00:04,230
in the sales section here.

6
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:05,240
I'm one of the co-founders at

7
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:06,419
Client Ascension and ListKit,

8
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:07,459
lead the sales team at both

9
00:00:07,459 --> 00:00:08,039
companies.

10
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:09,269
And this first video is going to

11
00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:09,880
be all about

12
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,369
the foundation of how we're going

13
00:00:11,369 --> 00:00:12,609
to get good at sales and have a

14
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:13,800
killer sales process,

15
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:14,800
which is the mindset of a

16
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,019
high-performing closer.

17
00:00:16,019 --> 00:00:17,820
If you're like me, you probably

18
00:00:17,829 --> 00:00:18,420
want to get into

19
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:19,760
the tactical stuff, which trust

20
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:20,359
me, we will.

21
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:21,660
But like I said, if things aren't

22
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:22,359
built on this

23
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:23,589
foundation, it's all going to

24
00:00:23,589 --> 00:00:24,059
crumble.

25
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:25,329
And you may be thinking, I'm not

26
00:00:25,329 --> 00:00:26,160
good at sales.

27
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:26,350
Well,

28
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,449
first off, you're not good at

29
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:27,940
sales yet.

30
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:29,280
That's what we're going to change

31
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:29,820
throughout

32
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:30,800
these next few videos.

33
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:31,960
If you're thinking I'm not the

34
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,219
type of person that could be good

35
00:00:33,219 --> 00:00:33,740
at sales,

36
00:00:33,859 --> 00:00:35,759
it's usually just a mindset issue,

37
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:37,299
or it almost always is just a

38
00:00:37,299 --> 00:00:38,420
mindset issue.

39
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:38,859
I can tell you

40
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:40,049
my first sales gig, it was in an

41
00:00:40,049 --> 00:00:41,119
office and you would see all

42
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:42,700
different types of personalities,

43
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:44,679
the outgoing jock type who seemed

44
00:00:44,679 --> 00:00:46,509
like he was a stud athlete, the

45
00:00:46,509 --> 00:00:48,670
guy who's super reserved in the

46
00:00:49,009 --> 00:00:50,270
corner, the girl who's also super

47
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:51,759
reserved, the girl who's super

48
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:53,030
outgoing, wants to talk to

49
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:53,420
everybody

50
00:00:53,509 --> 00:00:54,079
in the office.

51
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:55,200
And I can tell you that none of

52
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,399
those personality types were

53
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:57,619
actually indicative of

54
00:00:58,009 --> 00:00:59,539
performance, right?

55
00:00:59,539 --> 00:01:01,679
At the same time, if you're

56
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:03,200
thinking, I don't want to get good

57
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:03,649
at sales,

58
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:05,069
I don't like sales, I hate sales

59
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,700
and salespeople, that's usually

60
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,010
just another mindset issue.

61
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:09,849
Because what you're thinking of

62
00:01:09,849 --> 00:01:11,659
when you're thinking of sales is a

63
00:01:11,659 --> 00:01:13,269
greasy used car salesman who's

64
00:01:13,269 --> 00:01:13,420
trying

65
00:01:13,489 --> 00:01:14,319
to sell somebody a lemon that's

66
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:15,209
going to break down on the first

67
00:01:15,209 --> 00:01:15,409
day.

68
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:16,239
We're like, of course,

69
00:01:16,349 --> 00:01:17,299
you don't want to be that person.

70
00:01:17,299 --> 00:01:18,239
That guy's kind of a crook.

71
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:20,319
But if you are selling somebody

72
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,019
something that's actually going to

73
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,549
help them, you can see sales for

74
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:24,859
what it is, which is a noble

75
00:01:25,209 --> 00:01:26,269
profession when it's done right.

76
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:27,480
So we talked about the mindset

77
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,799
issues that could lead you not

78
00:01:28,939 --> 00:01:30,060
being good at sales or want to be

79
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:30,799
good at sales.

80
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:31,950
Now let's talk about the mindset

81
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:32,579
that's actually

82
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:34,159
going to make you good at sales.

83
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:35,459
What I call it is the service

84
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:36,780
driven closer mindset.

85
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,239
It's not as

86
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:39,349
sexy as me telling you that you

87
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:40,379
need to be in the Wolf of Wall

88
00:01:40,379 --> 00:01:41,760
Street mindset and me being like,

89
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:43,590
or you being like, I'm going to go

90
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:45,230
into every single call and I'm

91
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,219
going to close every single call

92
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:48,700
because that's just not realistic.

93
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:49,900
And after you take enough sales

94
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:50,739
call, you're going to be like,

95
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,939
thank God I didn't try to close

96
00:01:51,939 --> 00:01:52,939
everybody or didn't close

97
00:01:52,939 --> 00:01:54,519
everybody because some people are

98
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:56,129
going to be absolutely miserable

99
00:01:56,129 --> 00:01:57,549
clients if you do sign them.

100
00:01:57,549 --> 00:01:58,870
But this is both what works

101
00:01:59,019 --> 00:01:59,939
and is sustainable.

102
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:01,079
And it's also very easy to

103
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,480
understand with three simple

104
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,000
rules.

105
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,250
So let's

106
00:02:03,379 --> 00:02:04,109
just jump into it.

107
00:02:04,109 --> 00:02:05,420
Number one, your only job is to

108
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:06,439
help the prospect.

109
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:08,900
The way that you help them

110
00:02:09,008 --> 00:02:10,449
is by making them, because they

111
00:02:10,449 --> 00:02:12,080
usually need a little convincing

112
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,240
and we'll get into why,

113
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:14,620
making them make the best decision

114
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:16,159
for themselves, their business,

115
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:17,229
whether that's to work with you or

116
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:17,479
not.

117
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:19,330
Your job is not to collect as much

118
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:20,300
cash as possible.

119
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,780
So don't treat sales as purely

120
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:22,439
transactional.

121
00:02:22,539 --> 00:02:23,939
It's not if you're doing it right.

122
00:02:23,939 --> 00:02:25,240
And a lot of people get burnt out

123
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,120
because of this.

124
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:26,699
They get

125
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:27,949
drained from sales calls or burnt

126
00:02:27,949 --> 00:02:29,120
out entirely because they come

127
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,180
into each call thinking,

128
00:02:30,219 --> 00:02:31,250
I need to take this person's

129
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:31,590
money.

130
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:32,879
Like I need to take this person's

131
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:33,900
money from their pocket

132
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:36,460
and put it in the mine, which it's

133
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:39,379
more sustainable, ethical, and

134
00:02:39,379 --> 00:02:41,860
actually way more lucrative

135
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:42,439
long-term

136
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:43,860
going to each call thinking, I'm

137
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,129
going to help this person fix

138
00:02:45,129 --> 00:02:45,819
their shit.

139
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:49,419
99% of the time, if they signed up

140
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:51,080
for a sales call, they have shit

141
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,340
that needs fixing.

142
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:54,009
If they didn't, they wouldn't be

143
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:54,759
on the call.

144
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:56,389
Right?

145
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:58,319
And if your service can help them,

146
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,110
great.

147
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,889
It's actually immoral not to sell

148
00:03:01,889 --> 00:03:02,620
them.

149
00:03:02,789 --> 00:03:03,930
Also, I put this here.

150
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:05,560
Don't believe people when they

151
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,219
tell you everything is fine,

152
00:03:07,219 --> 00:03:07,599
because for

153
00:03:07,949 --> 00:03:09,400
whatever reason, people have this

154
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,080
weird proclivity to just tell you

155
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,740
things aren't as bad as they are.

156
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:13,960
They know they need to help, so

157
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,099
they sign up for the sales call.

158
00:03:15,099 --> 00:03:15,879
But then when they get to the

159
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:16,080
sales

160
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:17,300
call, they're like, ah, it's

161
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,680
actually things aren't that bad.

162
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,990
And the only reason is they think

163
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:21,389
that

164
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,159
admitting that they're in distress

165
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:24,639
is a poor reflection on them.

166
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:25,960
It makes them look like a

167
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,370
more incompetent business owner if

168
00:03:27,379 --> 00:03:28,419
they're really in need.

169
00:03:28,419 --> 00:03:29,449
We know they're in need.

170
00:03:29,449 --> 00:03:30,159
They want to sign

171
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,139
up for the sales call if they

172
00:03:31,139 --> 00:03:31,550
weren't.

173
00:03:31,569 --> 00:03:32,449
We just have to do a little

174
00:03:32,449 --> 00:03:33,580
digging and also get them to

175
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:33,979
realize

176
00:03:34,099 --> 00:03:36,159
and verbally come to an agreement

177
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,550
that they also need help with X,

178
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:39,819
Y, Z, which is where you're

179
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:39,979
selling.

180
00:03:40,169 --> 00:03:41,889
Now, we're just there to help

181
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:42,430
them.

182
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,560
At the same time, what's best for

183
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:46,250
the prospect is usually

184
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:47,800
outside of their comfort zone.

185
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,229
If they were already the person

186
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,740
that was capable for getting the

187
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:50,939
help

188
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,349
they need or doing the thing that

189
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,830
they need to do on their own, odds

190
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:55,289
are they would have already done

191
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:56,340
it, right?

192
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,069
Just think about that.

193
00:03:58,069 --> 00:04:00,639
It's pretty much a universal law.

194
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:02,479
Even though they may know

195
00:04:02,669 --> 00:04:04,090
they want to go from A to B, the

196
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:06,110
transformation from fat to skinny,

197
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:07,759
poor to rich, sad to happy,

198
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:09,280
they need to be sold on the thing

199
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,840
that gets them from A to B, which

200
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,900
is your service.

201
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,939
Because doing

202
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:15,409
a thing that gets them from A to B

203
00:04:15,409 --> 00:04:16,829
is going to be outside of their

204
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:17,629
comfort zone.

205
00:04:17,629 --> 00:04:18,680
Once again, if it was

206
00:04:18,819 --> 00:04:19,740
inside of their comfort zone, they

207
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:20,670
would have already done it, but

208
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:21,600
it's outside of their comfort

209
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:21,800
zone,

210
00:04:22,149 --> 00:04:23,620
which is why we need a sales call

211
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:24,879
in the first place.

212
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:27,350
Now, the third thing, these guys

213
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:27,660
are going

214
00:04:27,769 --> 00:04:29,149
to fight to stay inside of their

215
00:04:29,149 --> 00:04:29,959
comfort zone.

216
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:31,379
And most of the time, they'll

217
00:04:31,379 --> 00:04:32,620
fight pretty hard.

218
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:33,480
This is why you shouldn't get

219
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,509
intimidated when somebody tells

220
00:04:34,509 --> 00:04:35,300
you no on the sales call.

221
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:35,540
A lot

222
00:04:35,649 --> 00:04:36,930
of times, that's just when the

223
00:04:36,949 --> 00:04:38,560
sales call is beginning, right?

224
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,889
Why are they going to fight?

225
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:41,910
Like if somebody knows they want

226
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:43,610
to go from point A to point B,

227
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:44,019
why?

228
00:04:44,029 --> 00:04:45,560
As I mentioned, they want to go

229
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,269
through some transformation, but

230
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:48,800
they're not yet the person on the

231
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,220
other side of that transformation.

232
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:52,129
In other words, because they have

233
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:54,079
not achieved the result, making

234
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:56,290
the decision needed to get the

235
00:04:56,589 --> 00:04:57,540
result is going to feel foreign

236
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:58,459
and uncomfortable.

237
00:04:58,459 --> 00:04:59,579
And I'll give you guys a super

238
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:00,379
common example,

239
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,569
because I've seen it time and time

240
00:05:01,569 --> 00:05:01,920
again.

241
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,019
A lot of our clients want to grow

242
00:05:03,019 --> 00:05:03,819
their business.

243
00:05:03,819 --> 00:05:04,240
So they

244
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,439
join client Ascension.

245
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:06,750
Now, once they're in client

246
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,220
Ascension and they do grow their

247
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:08,839
business,

248
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:10,160
in hindsight, they'll see it as a

249
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:10,720
no brainer.

250
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,000
Like you'll see on testimonials

251
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,100
and case studies like,

252
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:14,750
dude, like it's one of the best

253
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,060
decisions I've ever made.

254
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:16,600
Right.

255
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:21,879
But, but the reason why they're

256
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:23,300
saying that, oh yeah, it was a no

257
00:05:23,339 --> 00:05:24,759
brainer is because they're being

258
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:25,959
taught by coaches who have

259
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,019
already achieved what they're

260
00:05:27,019 --> 00:05:27,800
looking to achieve.

261
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,029
We've got great testimonials about

262
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:29,680
how the program

263
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,459
is run, tons of case studies, and

264
00:05:31,459 --> 00:05:33,060
one of the best communities out

265
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:33,550
there.

266
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:35,209
However, on the actual sales

267
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:37,240
call when they were the person at

268
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,230
point A, not the person at point

269
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,139
B, they likely had multiple

270
00:05:41,529 --> 00:05:42,180
objections.

271
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,350
They were super nervous and they

272
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:45,879
needed to be closed.

273
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:46,509
Right.

274
00:05:46,509 --> 00:05:48,180
And some people may call it

275
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:49,810
like hard closing techniques,

276
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:51,189
which we're not, we're not

277
00:05:51,189 --> 00:05:52,920
treating or, you know, teaching

278
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:53,550
these high

279
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:55,350
pressure sales tactics, but like

280
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:56,949
there are times where people do

281
00:05:56,949 --> 00:05:57,910
need to be closed.

282
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:58,910
And a lot of our best

283
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,420
case studies going back to one of

284
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:02,100
our guys who's absolutely crushing

285
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,639
it right now, running a multiple

286
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,930
six figure a month agency on that

287
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:08,019
first sales call, he just jumped

288
00:06:08,019 --> 00:06:09,560
off when he got the agreement.

289
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:11,110
He just was literally right there

290
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:12,490
looking at, looking down the

291
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:14,600
barrel at a $10,000 investment

292
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,129
and just, just hopped off, closed

293
00:06:16,129 --> 00:06:17,620
the zoom, ran away, came back in a

294
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:18,439
couple of months,

295
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:20,540
joined and then became a massive

296
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:21,480
case study.

297
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,470
And what's funny is he, like so

298
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:24,689
many of our other

299
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,829
clients have gone on to join other

300
00:06:25,829 --> 00:06:27,040
programs because they already went

301
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,240
through the initial transformation

302
00:06:28,329 --> 00:06:29,579
of someone who thinks in his mind,

303
00:06:29,579 --> 00:06:31,029
like, ah, dude, I don't know yet.

304
00:06:31,029 --> 00:06:32,120
Cause I haven't done it.

305
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:33,689
Maybe coaching doesn't work.

306
00:06:33,699 --> 00:06:34,620
How do I know they know how to

307
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:35,829
help my business specifically?

308
00:06:35,829 --> 00:06:36,220
Blah,

309
00:06:36,569 --> 00:06:38,259
blah, blah to, okay.

310
00:06:38,259 --> 00:06:39,709
Based off my experience with

311
00:06:39,709 --> 00:06:41,689
client Ascension, like, yeah, next

312
00:06:41,689 --> 00:06:42,139
time,

313
00:06:42,259 --> 00:06:43,920
if the program seems legit, has

314
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,750
good results and helps with what I

315
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:46,819
need help with.

316
00:06:46,819 --> 00:06:47,240
Yeah.

317
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:47,600
I'm,

318
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:48,810
I'm capable of seeing an ROI.

319
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:50,120
I've already done it before.

320
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:50,810
Right.

321
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:52,529
So 90% of the time,

322
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:54,589
the former, this mindset right

323
00:06:54,589 --> 00:06:57,879
here is where your prospects are

324
00:06:57,899 --> 00:06:58,959
today.

325
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:01,199
So it's our moral obligation

326
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:02,269
to get them to the ladder.

327
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:03,399
And the reason why I'm saying

328
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:04,639
moral obligation is because

329
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:06,379
think of this person and we'll go

330
00:07:06,379 --> 00:07:07,149
over frame.

331
00:07:07,149 --> 00:07:08,899
Like you don't want to make them

332
00:07:08,899 --> 00:07:10,610
your friend.

333
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:11,019
I mean,

334
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,209
if you do in the process, great,

335
00:07:12,209 --> 00:07:13,319
but like that shouldn't be your

336
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:14,300
sole goal going into it,

337
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:16,910
but think of them as a friend.

338
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:19,439
If you were hearing a friend say

339
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,819
things that are just completely

340
00:07:21,889 --> 00:07:22,920
unaligned with their goals, like,

341
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,959
would you push them a little bit?

342
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:24,939
Would you hold them accountable?

343
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:25,980
I hope you would, because that's

344
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:26,910
what a good friend would do.

345
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:28,000
That's what a good salesperson

346
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:28,600
would do.

347
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,069
Right.

348
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:30,639
So it's our moral obligation to

349
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,610
help them get to the ladder, which

350
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:33,970
is the person on

351
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:34,930
the other side of the

352
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:36,490
transformation that they told us

353
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:38,139
that they wanted to go through.

354
00:07:38,139 --> 00:07:39,339
Right now,

355
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:40,170
three rules.

356
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:41,740
Like I said, super simple.

357
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:43,110
Your only job is to help the

358
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:44,560
prospect at the same time.

359
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,519
What's best for them is going to

360
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:46,569
be outside of the comfort zone.

361
00:07:46,569 --> 00:07:47,680
And also they're going to fight

362
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,610
like hell to stay inside of the

363
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:49,379
comfort zone, right?

364
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:50,339
Which is where all these sales

365
00:07:50,339 --> 00:07:50,860
techniques

366
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:51,920
are going to come in.

367
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,360
Now, even if you have a service

368
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,870
driven mindset, you still need

369
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:55,680
these three

370
00:07:56,029 --> 00:07:56,379
things.

371
00:07:56,379 --> 00:07:58,730
Number one, conviction, super,

372
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:00,870
super simple, but often a lot of

373
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:02,470
people are struggling

374
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,000
with sales.

375
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,980
They just simply don't have

376
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:04,850
conviction, right?

377
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:06,819
This is perhaps, and Daniel may

378
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:07,139
disagree.

379
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:08,339
He may say the offer.

380
00:08:08,339 --> 00:08:09,980
He may say something else, but

381
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:10,790
I've seen it.

382
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,579
When a sales rep has conviction

383
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,879
in what they're selling, they

384
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:15,180
really believe in what they're

385
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:15,680
selling.

386
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,930
They can get away with a lot of

387
00:08:17,189 --> 00:08:17,420
stuff.

388
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:18,699
When they don't, they can be a

389
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,180
great sales guy in all their areas

390
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,279
and super competent,

391
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:23,110
but their performance is just

392
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:25,089
going to fall off a cliff because

393
00:08:25,089 --> 00:08:27,399
people can viscerally feel when

394
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:27,480
you

395
00:08:27,819 --> 00:08:28,800
believe in what you're selling.

396
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,050
And if sales is a transfer, it's a

397
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:31,259
belief and you have none to

398
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:32,679
transfer, you're not going to do

399
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,620
very well in sales.

400
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:34,389
Pretty simple.

401
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:35,610
So believe in what you sell.

402
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:35,820
And

403
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,809
when you pitch, really pitch.

404
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:39,490
If you guys are here, you're

405
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:41,460
probably a fan of Alex Ramosi or

406
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:41,559
have

407
00:08:41,929 --> 00:08:43,658
consumed some of this content.

408
00:08:43,658 --> 00:08:45,320
He has talked in a couple of

409
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:48,500
videos about his worst ever live

410
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:48,809
pitch

411
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:50,450
performance when he was on stage.

412
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:51,789
And the reason why the pitch

413
00:08:51,789 --> 00:08:53,419
didn't work out for him is because

414
00:08:53,419 --> 00:08:53,539
he

415
00:08:53,629 --> 00:08:54,340
was like, eh, you know, I got

416
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:54,909
really good stuff.

417
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:55,820
It's going to help these people.

418
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:56,960
I don't really need a

419
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:57,259
pitch.

420
00:08:57,289 --> 00:08:58,240
I'm just going to kind of explain

421
00:08:58,250 --> 00:08:59,259
what I do and say, yo, if you want

422
00:08:59,259 --> 00:09:00,190
help, just meet me in the

423
00:09:00,389 --> 00:09:00,669
back.

424
00:09:00,669 --> 00:09:01,519
Nobody did.

425
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:02,259
Right.

426
00:09:02,259 --> 00:09:04,549
And his takeaway, which is the

427
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:07,429
right takeaway is when you pitch,

428
00:09:07,429 --> 00:09:08,340
you have to

429
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:09,529
really pitch.

430
00:09:09,529 --> 00:09:12,159
Contrary to popular belief, people

431
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:13,429
want to be sold.

432
00:09:13,429 --> 00:09:15,840
They only roll their eyes and zone

433
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,230
out when they don't see how it's

434
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,299
going to help them.

435
00:09:18,299 --> 00:09:20,769
And we're going to go over how to

436
00:09:20,779 --> 00:09:21,460
avoid that,

437
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:22,950
but just burn that into your

438
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:23,460
brain.

439
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:25,269
Like you actually have to believe

440
00:09:25,269 --> 00:09:26,389
that you can get them

441
00:09:26,769 --> 00:09:27,070
results.

442
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:28,559
And if you're sitting there

443
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:30,179
thinking like, well, then I

444
00:09:30,179 --> 00:09:32,090
haven't actually gotten results

445
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:32,259
for

446
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:32,710
people.

447
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:33,860
So how do I know I can get them

448
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:34,350
results?

449
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:35,210
That's why you have a

450
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:36,519
performance-based offer.

451
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:37,649
That's why you have a guarantee in

452
00:09:37,649 --> 00:09:38,159
your offer.

453
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:40,259
So you may not know for a fact,

454
00:09:40,259 --> 00:09:40,870
you're going to get them

455
00:09:41,269 --> 00:09:42,330
results, but you should believe

456
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:43,590
damn well in your offer being a

457
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:44,929
good offer for that person.

458
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,570
Maybe they don't hit the guarantee

459
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:48,179
and they do get their money back,

460
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,269
but with that guarantee in place

461
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:51,480
in lack of, or in lieu of a bunch

462
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,750
of case studies that you guys are

463
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,120
going to build up eventually,

464
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,279
you should still be at a point

465
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:56,649
where it's like, dude, I know I'm

466
00:09:56,649 --> 00:09:58,259
going to put my best foot forward.

467
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,799
I know I'm going to do good work

468
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:00,340
for you.

469
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:02,139
I know that I fully believe, which

470
00:10:02,139 --> 00:10:02,940
once again,

471
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,500
they can viscerally feel that I

472
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,059
can help you get to that goal.

473
00:10:06,059 --> 00:10:07,039
And if you don't,

474
00:10:07,159 --> 00:10:09,039
you would get your money back.

475
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:11,269
So it's a no brainer here, right?

476
00:10:11,269 --> 00:10:13,009
So you can have conviction

477
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,409
in what you're selling, in what

478
00:10:14,409 --> 00:10:15,889
you're doing, even when you don't

479
00:10:15,889 --> 00:10:16,940
have case studies.

480
00:10:17,059 --> 00:10:18,539
The issue is a lot of people are

481
00:10:18,539 --> 00:10:20,029
just scared to sell because

482
00:10:20,029 --> 00:10:21,990
they're not confident in what they

483
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:22,220
do,

484
00:10:22,409 --> 00:10:23,740
which is like a meme on Twitter.

485
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,330
But like, yeah, that's, that's

486
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:26,919
quite literally a skill issue.

487
00:10:27,009 --> 00:10:28,250
Go back through the other content,

488
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,399
talk to the other coaches, get

489
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:30,480
good enough to the point where

490
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,679
you're like, fuck yeah, I'm going

491
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:32,440
to help this person.

492
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,029
Because once again, they can feel

493
00:10:34,029 --> 00:10:34,360
that

494
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,379
and they want to be pitched,

495
00:10:35,379 --> 00:10:35,730
right?

496
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:36,529
They want to be sold.

497
00:10:36,529 --> 00:10:37,179
Think about it.

498
00:10:37,179 --> 00:10:38,240
If you guys were buying a

499
00:10:38,379 --> 00:10:40,100
car, like if you were interested,

500
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,759
I don't know what type of cars you

501
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:43,259
guys like, but let's say you're

502
00:10:43,629 --> 00:10:45,279
interested in a cyber truck, for

503
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:47,539
example, and you're pretty excited

504
00:10:47,539 --> 00:10:48,259
about it.

505
00:10:48,259 --> 00:10:49,559
If the sales guy's like,

506
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,600
yeah, cyber truck's pretty cool.

507
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,240
You know, can tow a lot, got a

508
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,259
good battery.

509
00:10:54,259 --> 00:10:56,070
Looks, looks kind of cool.

510
00:10:56,259 --> 00:10:57,549
You're like, what the fuck?

511
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,100
You're like actively talking me

512
00:10:59,100 --> 00:10:59,659
out of it.

513
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,000
Or let's say you're looking at a

514
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:01,750
new apartment.

515
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,149
If the person's like, yo, these

516
00:11:03,149 --> 00:11:04,100
amenities are sick.

517
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,679
This place has 12 foot ceilings.

518
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:06,539
You're going to love it.

519
00:11:06,539 --> 00:11:07,769
The community's dope, this, that,

520
00:11:07,769 --> 00:11:08,320
and the third.

521
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:08,820
Like, yeah.

522
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:09,200
Okay.

523
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:09,539
That's what

524
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:10,809
I want when I'm excited about

525
00:11:10,809 --> 00:11:11,460
something.

526
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:12,929
Once again, they only don't want

527
00:11:12,929 --> 00:11:13,500
to be sold.

528
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,330
They only don't

529
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:15,730
want to be pitched when they don't

530
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,080
see how it's going to help them,

531
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:18,330
which goes into a sales structure

532
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:20,200
issue, which once again, I'm going

533
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,759
to be on the next videos here.

534
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:23,220
Two, because a lot of you guys are

535
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:24,629
beginners, you're going to have

536
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:26,019
less experience than people.

537
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:27,139
And even as you grow your

538
00:11:27,139 --> 00:11:27,379
business,

539
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:29,399
like hopefully you're working with

540
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:30,879
people that have money.

541
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:32,690
So you're going to continue to

542
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:33,019
encounter

543
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:34,340
a bunch of people that have way

544
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:35,820
more experience, way more money

545
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:36,730
than you, right?

546
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:37,600
You cannot treat

547
00:11:37,879 --> 00:11:39,190
these people as your superior.

548
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:40,659
First off, their problems are

549
00:11:40,659 --> 00:11:41,950
largely the same as everyone

550
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:42,460
else's.

551
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:44,100
And you're still just there to

552
00:11:44,129 --> 00:11:45,950
help them with their problems.

553
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:47,559
Like don't overthink it.

554
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:48,649
These people

555
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:50,139
value their time even more than

556
00:11:50,139 --> 00:11:50,929
other people.

557
00:11:50,929 --> 00:11:52,399
So of course they wouldn't have

558
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:53,320
booked in a call if

559
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,309
they didn't need help.

560
00:11:54,309 --> 00:11:55,710
They don't, you know, no business

561
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:56,740
owner gets to where he's at

562
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:57,309
because he

563
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:59,059
loves hopping on hundreds of sales

564
00:11:59,059 --> 00:12:00,600
calls that are going to lead them

565
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:01,679
nowhere, right?

566
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:02,490
If anything,

567
00:12:02,809 --> 00:12:04,110
these people are probably more

568
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:05,590
problem aware than the broke

569
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:06,379
prospects.

570
00:12:06,379 --> 00:12:08,769
Now, even though this person

571
00:12:08,899 --> 00:12:10,250
may be making a hundred times the

572
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:11,769
amount of money you are, I mean,

573
00:12:11,769 --> 00:12:13,360
we've talked to businesses that

574
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:13,480
are

575
00:12:13,779 --> 00:12:16,210
five, 10, 15 X bigger than us.

576
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:18,029
They still share a lot of the same

577
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:19,950
problems that a startup will.

578
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,000
So in other words, like there's

579
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,370
very few problems.

580
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:25,330
There's just varying levels of

581
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:25,899
them,

582
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:26,279
right?

583
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:27,289
I can't get leads from cold

584
00:12:27,309 --> 00:12:27,789
traffic.

585
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:29,009
I can't find good sales reps.

586
00:12:29,009 --> 00:12:29,860
I don't know how to

587
00:12:30,029 --> 00:12:31,009
create content that converts.

588
00:12:31,009 --> 00:12:32,039
A lot of it's just the same exact

589
00:12:32,039 --> 00:12:33,259
problem at different scales.

590
00:12:33,259 --> 00:12:33,600
So don't

591
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,909
treat it as a different problem.

592
00:12:34,909 --> 00:12:35,659
It's the same one.

593
00:12:35,659 --> 00:12:36,879
You just need to be talking about

594
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:37,460
a different

595
00:12:37,769 --> 00:12:39,159
point A and a different point B.

596
00:12:39,169 --> 00:12:40,879
Obviously the worst thing you can

597
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:42,500
do is treat them like their

598
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:43,909
problems are less consequential

599
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,370
than the next prospects because

600
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:46,740
they're making more money.

601
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:48,019
Oh, you know, you know, like you

602
00:12:48,029 --> 00:12:49,289
guys, uh, hopefully we can help

603
00:12:49,289 --> 00:12:50,419
you grow, but it sounds

604
00:12:50,539 --> 00:12:51,210
like you guys are doing pretty

605
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:51,460
good.

606
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:51,940
No.

607
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:52,399
Right.

608
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:53,970
If you treat them like that, of

609
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:54,659
course, they're going

610
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:55,769
to be like, well, I don't want to

611
00:12:55,769 --> 00:12:56,629
work with this person.

612
00:12:56,629 --> 00:12:57,779
Cause it seems like they're just

613
00:12:57,779 --> 00:12:58,100
way out of

614
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:59,210
their league and they don't know

615
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:00,379
how to help somebody at my size.

616
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:01,539
And I'm actually like a little bit

617
00:13:01,659 --> 00:13:02,929
off-put because he doesn't have

618
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:04,360
the same urgency that I have when

619
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,779
it comes to fixing this issue.

620
00:13:06,139 --> 00:13:07,980
People want to work with people

621
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,710
that understand their problems

622
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:11,539
better than they do and are of

623
00:13:11,889 --> 00:13:13,269
similar or higher status in your

624
00:13:13,269 --> 00:13:13,840
domain.

625
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,559
This is, this is capitalism.

626
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:16,730
This is business.

627
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:17,220
People don't

628
00:13:17,539 --> 00:13:19,389
want to work with the young kid to

629
00:13:19,389 --> 00:13:21,789
give them a shot or, uh, you know,

630
00:13:21,789 --> 00:13:23,779
give you some money to, as,

631
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:25,309
as charity, to help your business

632
00:13:25,309 --> 00:13:25,879
also grow.

633
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:26,889
Like cool.

634
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:29,529
Like if that shit was how things

635
00:13:29,529 --> 00:13:30,179
worked,

636
00:13:30,299 --> 00:13:31,570
like, I guess that could be nice

637
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:32,529
in some instances.

638
00:13:32,529 --> 00:13:33,460
It's not though.

639
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:35,519
Right now you may be thinking this

640
00:13:35,889 --> 00:13:37,220
person makes way more money than

641
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:37,519
me.

642
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,129
How can I be of similar or higher

643
00:13:39,129 --> 00:13:39,779
status?

644
00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:40,740
You don't have to be

645
00:13:40,929 --> 00:13:42,490
with the scoreboard of just how

646
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:44,019
many dollars do I have my bank

647
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:46,730
account or how big is my business.

648
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,559
It's, it's just in your domain

649
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:49,620
specifically.

650
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:53,360
For example, this person may be a

651
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:54,019
billionaire,

652
00:13:54,139 --> 00:13:55,389
but he doesn't know how to create

653
00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:56,340
YouTube content.

654
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:58,029
So if he can see me as somebody

655
00:13:58,029 --> 00:13:59,059
who understands

656
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:01,840
the problems of why most people

657
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,860
don't see success with YouTube and

658
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:06,980
I can be seen as similar or higher

659
00:14:07,309 --> 00:14:08,389
status in him, when it comes to

660
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,870
YouTube growth, that's all you

661
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:10,240
need.

662
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,539
Same thing with cold email,

663
00:14:11,659 --> 00:14:13,159
same thing with any other service

664
00:14:13,159 --> 00:14:14,740
that you guys may be selling.

665
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:16,820
And lastly, the person who needs

666
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:17,379
the sale

667
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:21,370
the most usually doesn't get it.

668
00:14:21,379 --> 00:14:22,720
In other words, the person who

669
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:24,259
needs the least typically gets

670
00:14:24,259 --> 00:14:24,340
what

671
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:24,860
they want.

672
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:26,019
And this is one of those things

673
00:14:26,029 --> 00:14:27,289
that you just have to constantly

674
00:14:27,289 --> 00:14:28,019
remind yourself.

675
00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:28,850
Because of course, like if

676
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:30,110
somebody is making way more money

677
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:31,700
than you, or you're just trying to

678
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:31,860
get

679
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:33,169
this off the ground, or maybe

680
00:14:33,169 --> 00:14:34,379
you're having a bad month or

681
00:14:34,379 --> 00:14:35,779
you're in a slump for whatever

682
00:14:35,779 --> 00:14:36,340
reason,

683
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:37,870
you need to remind yourself of

684
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:38,340
this.

685
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:40,529
If you need the sale more than the

686
00:14:40,529 --> 00:14:41,379
prospect,

687
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,659
they have all the leverage, which

688
00:14:43,659 --> 00:14:44,820
means they're going to dictate the

689
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:45,129
terms.

690
00:14:45,129 --> 00:14:45,730
You're going to get walked

691
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:46,330
all over.

692
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:47,559
And usually you're going to get

693
00:14:47,559 --> 00:14:48,750
walked all over and they still

694
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:50,100
won't pay you, which really

695
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:50,850
fucking sucks.

696
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:52,250
If you've been through it a couple

697
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:53,379
of times, if they need your

698
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:55,059
solution more than you

699
00:14:55,179 --> 00:14:56,690
need their business, even if it's

700
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:58,070
not true, if we can carry the

701
00:14:58,070 --> 00:14:59,779
energy and get them to believe or

702
00:14:59,779 --> 00:14:59,940
get

703
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:01,350
them on the other side of the

704
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:03,169
phone or zoom call thing and like,

705
00:15:03,169 --> 00:15:04,100
yeah, okay.

706
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,909
I think we definitely

707
00:15:06,059 --> 00:15:06,419
need this.

708
00:15:06,419 --> 00:15:06,659
Right.

709
00:15:06,659 --> 00:15:07,669
And we're going to talk about

710
00:15:07,669 --> 00:15:08,870
establishing opportunity costs

711
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:09,620
and, you know,

712
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:11,129
building up the cost of an action

713
00:15:11,129 --> 00:15:12,340
in their mind to make this a

714
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:12,899
reality.

715
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:15,299
But if they need your solution,

716
00:15:16,659 --> 00:15:17,629
more than you need their business,

717
00:15:17,629 --> 00:15:19,720
it's only natural that they will

718
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,299
become your client.

719
00:15:21,419 --> 00:15:22,620
And you're not going to get walked

720
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:23,879
all over in terms of, you know,

721
00:15:23,879 --> 00:15:25,220
what the terms of the contract

722
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:25,799
look like.

723
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:27,259
And I'm not, I'm not sitting here

724
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:28,799
telling you that you're never just

725
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:29,940
going to have to sling a

726
00:15:30,059 --> 00:15:31,159
deal to make it happen.

727
00:15:31,159 --> 00:15:32,899
And, you know, maybe give a little

728
00:15:32,899 --> 00:15:34,440
bit of a discount here or get rid

729
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:34,730
of a

730
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:36,559
contract clause there.

731
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:38,460
But I could tell you over the

732
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:40,850
course of thousands of sales calls

733
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:41,860
I've taken,

734
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:42,659
thousands of sales calls.

735
00:15:42,659 --> 00:15:46,549
I've watched with the 10, 15 sales

736
00:15:46,549 --> 00:15:48,899
reps that I have right now between

737
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:49,909
centers and closers.

738
00:15:49,909 --> 00:15:50,909
No one likes the smell of

739
00:15:50,909 --> 00:15:51,940
commission breath.

740
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:54,210
So like, yeah, at certain

741
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:56,360
points, there's going to be times

742
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,610
where it's like, okay, shit.

743
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,250
Like, you know, we, we kind of

744
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:00,580
push and

745
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,429
we drag the deal across the finish

746
00:16:02,429 --> 00:16:04,269
line, but over the course of your

747
00:16:04,269 --> 00:16:05,220
sales career,

748
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,019
you will see that when this person

749
00:16:08,019 --> 00:16:10,909
needs your solution more than you

750
00:16:10,909 --> 00:16:12,500
seemingly, because once

751
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:13,750
again, I mean, it's kind of all a

752
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:14,970
game of optics here, need their

753
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:15,539
business.

754
00:16:15,539 --> 00:16:16,580
They're

755
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:19,620
going to become your client.

756
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:20,690
The money is going to flow to the

757
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:22,340
person that needs the least,

758
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:22,659
right?

759
00:16:22,779 --> 00:16:23,620
That's just how it works.

760
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:24,740
And like I said, it's not a

761
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:25,620
charity game.

762
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:26,340
Nobody likes to smell,

763
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:27,000
commission breath.

764
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:27,730
They're not there to quote

765
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:28,580
unquote, help you out.

766
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:29,190
So that's it.

767
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:29,460
I said,

768
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:30,620
again, things in the next video,

769
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:31,460
it's going to be a lot more

770
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:32,179
process oriented,

771
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:33,090
but hopefully you got some value

772
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:33,409
out of it.

773
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:34,019
Let me know if you have.
