1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01,120
What's going on guys in this video

2
00:00:01,149 --> 00:00:02,209
i'm going to be talking about how

3
00:00:02,209 --> 00:00:03,279
to win on follow-ups which is

4
00:00:03,279 --> 00:00:04,730
a topic that i personally nerd out

5
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:06,139
about just because in my opinion

6
00:00:06,139 --> 00:00:07,339
is the separation between

7
00:00:07,429 --> 00:00:09,119
a good salesperson and a great

8
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:11,169
salesperson and i've managed a lot

9
00:00:11,169 --> 00:00:12,630
of sales reps i've coached a

10
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:14,000
lot of people on the sales side

11
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,339
and i can tell you a lot of times

12
00:00:15,339 --> 00:00:16,699
i'm looking at the calls i'm

13
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:17,920
trying to figure out what's wrong

14
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,089
the discovery seems pretty good

15
00:00:19,089 --> 00:00:20,160
the pitch seems pretty good

16
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:21,379
then all of a sudden they show me

17
00:00:21,379 --> 00:00:22,640
their crm and i'm like that's

18
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:23,920
exactly why they're not collecting

19
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:25,039
as much cash as they should so

20
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:26,329
super super important video you

21
00:00:26,329 --> 00:00:27,570
guys are going to see me go

22
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:29,260
in depth here and then at the end

23
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,679
i'm going to be going into a

24
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:32,380
pipeline automation example

25
00:00:32,539 --> 00:00:33,710
inside of go high level if you

26
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:35,299
guys haven't watched those videos

27
00:00:35,299 --> 00:00:36,789
yet completely fine i would just

28
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:37,119
circle

29
00:00:37,259 --> 00:00:38,159
back to that after you have

30
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:39,310
watched those videos just so

31
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:40,689
everything makes a little bit more

32
00:00:40,689 --> 00:00:41,179
sense but

33
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:42,710
obviously with the context on

34
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:44,399
following up and the crm which i'm

35
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:45,920
going to get into both in this

36
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:46,320
video

37
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:47,939
here that automation example is

38
00:00:47,939 --> 00:00:49,250
going to make perfect sense

39
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:51,100
anyways the reason why i'm titling

40
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:51,759
this video

41
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:53,590
how to win on follow-ups because

42
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:55,299
closing a deal or beating out a

43
00:00:55,299 --> 00:00:57,119
competitor primarily because of

44
00:00:57,119 --> 00:00:57,280
your

45
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:58,840
follow-up not the sales call is

46
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,710
100 a possibility i've done it

47
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:03,359
many times before our job here and

48
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,989
what you have to keep in mind is

49
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:06,810
that we're here to seek decisions

50
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:09,829
not validation meaning the last

51
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,000
thing

52
00:01:10,129 --> 00:01:11,569
we want is a bunch of people on

53
00:01:11,569 --> 00:01:13,280
the fence or us being in the dark

54
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,780
with a bunch of people just

55
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:15,040
because

56
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:17,769
it becomes unmanageable right and

57
00:01:17,769 --> 00:01:20,689
it's more importantly a symptom of

58
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,430
the problem which is you

59
00:01:23,579 --> 00:01:25,060
have a flaw in your sales process

60
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:26,739
or your follow-up process or a lot

61
00:01:26,739 --> 00:01:28,219
of times both that doesn't result

62
00:01:28,349 --> 00:01:29,700
in us getting a decision from the

63
00:01:29,709 --> 00:01:31,170
prospect that's a massive issue

64
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:33,120
and i even put here a no i'm

65
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:33,359
telling

66
00:01:33,489 --> 00:01:34,939
us no i do not want to do this or

67
00:01:34,939 --> 00:01:36,769
never contact me again is better

68
00:01:36,769 --> 00:01:38,629
at scale than a bunch of people

69
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:39,969
leaving us in the dark just

70
00:01:39,969 --> 00:01:41,540
because like i said if our job is

71
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:43,420
to seek decisions not validations

72
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:43,680
and we

73
00:01:43,819 --> 00:01:45,569
can't do that at scale it shows

74
00:01:45,569 --> 00:01:47,450
that there's a real flaw in our

75
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:49,359
process so started us off by just

76
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,409
saying the money's in the

77
00:01:50,409 --> 00:01:51,799
follow-up you guys have probably

78
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:53,420
heard that before 100 times but

79
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:54,400
it's one

80
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:55,909
of those cliches that is actually

81
00:01:55,909 --> 00:01:57,329
true the money is sitting inside

82
00:01:57,359 --> 00:01:58,790
of your pipeline if you assign

83
00:01:58,799 --> 00:01:59,120
deal

84
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:00,480
values to the opportunity cards

85
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,629
which i can show you how to do

86
00:02:01,629 --> 00:02:02,769
inside of go high level and i

87
00:02:02,819 --> 00:02:03,439
actually do

88
00:02:03,579 --> 00:02:04,489
show you how to do that in a

89
00:02:04,489 --> 00:02:05,939
different video you're going to be

90
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:06,959
able to see and look at your

91
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:07,439
pipeline

92
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:08,629
at any given moment and there will

93
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:09,599
be hundreds of thousands of

94
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:11,680
dollars sitting there now that

95
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:11,830
should

96
00:02:11,949 --> 00:02:13,250
do two things it should get you

97
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:14,759
excited because you're like if i

98
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:16,560
can convert some of this that's

99
00:02:16,699 --> 00:02:17,659
tens of thousands of dollars

100
00:02:17,659 --> 00:02:18,849
entering my bank account and it

101
00:02:18,849 --> 00:02:20,000
should also get you a little

102
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,620
pissed off you

103
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:21,900
should be a little sick in the

104
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,400
stomach looking at how much money

105
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,199
is just sitting in there so if you

106
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:26,900
want a way to actually convert

107
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,840
that pipeline value which doesn't

108
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:31,199
mean much if you're not doing with

109
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:32,960
anything with it and convert that

110
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,800
in actual cash in the bank account

111
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,159
this section is going to help you

112
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,210
with that process exactly now even

113
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:40,199
the best salesperson in the world

114
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:41,430
like i talked about

115
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:43,030
it's usually separation between

116
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,550
good and great here can take their

117
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:45,909
close rate to the next level

118
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:47,189
by having a killer follow-up

119
00:02:47,189 --> 00:02:48,520
process and oftentimes it's a

120
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:50,199
differentiator between you and

121
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:50,800
your competitor

122
00:02:50,939 --> 00:02:52,949
who's the last man standing i love

123
00:02:52,949 --> 00:02:55,430
that concept because a lot of

124
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:57,840
times they're interviewing

125
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,719
multiple

126
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,789
paid ads agencies they're in a

127
00:03:00,789 --> 00:03:02,949
situation here where they just

128
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:05,120
dedicated a week to taking sales

129
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:05,599
calls

130
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,400
but they weren't yet ready to make

131
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,189
a decision until a month later and

132
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,870
this prospect may seem

133
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,229
super analytical they may seem

134
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:13,740
like they have all these different

135
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:15,039
buying criterias that's super

136
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,469
important but a lot of times that

137
00:03:16,469 --> 00:03:17,849
last man standing the one who's

138
00:03:17,849 --> 00:03:18,800
still following up

139
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:22,090
gets the deal it's not a great

140
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:24,860
example to use um but it's kind of

141
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:26,469
just like the last person at the

142
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:26,800
bar

143
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:28,710
you're like all right i guess i'm

144
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:30,550
going home with you and it works

145
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:32,240
like that in real life it works

146
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:33,530
like that in sales and also who

147
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:34,990
seems to have a more professional

148
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:36,300
sales process because what you

149
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:37,599
guys have to realize is that your

150
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:38,879
sales process even if you're not

151
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,080
selling sales coaching or

152
00:03:40,229 --> 00:03:42,629
anything related to sales it's a

153
00:03:42,629 --> 00:03:45,099
reflection of how you operate as a

154
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:46,870
company the person who has a

155
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:47,520
better

156
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:49,050
more professional sales process a

157
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:50,400
lot of times it's going to be like

158
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,680
okay this just seems like a more

159
00:03:51,819 --> 00:03:53,219
competent company right so these

160
00:03:53,219 --> 00:03:54,419
things here who's last man

161
00:03:54,419 --> 00:03:55,740
standing who seems to have a

162
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:56,240
better more

163
00:03:56,389 --> 00:03:58,090
professional sales process that a

164
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:59,659
lot of times can sway things in

165
00:03:59,659 --> 00:04:01,360
your favor and be the deciding

166
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:01,919
factor

167
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,270
from when that person or for when

168
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:04,629
that person is ready to actually

169
00:04:04,629 --> 00:04:05,360
make a decision

170
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,539
save yourself time book the

171
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:09,419
follow-up call i'm a huge

172
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:11,300
proponent of booking follow-up

173
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:11,680
calls and that

174
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:12,969
may seem counterintuitive because

175
00:04:12,969 --> 00:04:14,030
a lot of people are like why am i

176
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,280
going to book a follow-up call

177
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:15,520
this

178
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:17,459
guy said he's ready to go or this

179
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:19,170
person uh told me like yeah i

180
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:20,660
think this is uh you know

181
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:20,959
something

182
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:22,139
we want to do i'll let you know by

183
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:23,199
the end of the week why would

184
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,019
putting an extra 30 minutes or 15

185
00:04:25,189 --> 00:04:26,990
minutes or 10 minutes on my

186
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,870
calendar save me time dan it's

187
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:30,879
simply because we're setting a

188
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:31,509
clear deadline

189
00:04:31,649 --> 00:04:33,259
for us to for them to get back to

190
00:04:33,259 --> 00:04:35,019
us so in the micro it seems like

191
00:04:35,019 --> 00:04:36,879
you're dedicating another 10

192
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:37,199
minutes

193
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:38,600
or 20 minutes or 30 minutes on a

194
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,670
call when you feel like you're

195
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:40,800
going to hear back from this

196
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,120
person

197
00:04:41,259 --> 00:04:43,009
anyways but in the macro with the

198
00:04:43,009 --> 00:04:44,970
amount of time that people aren't

199
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:47,120
going to stick to those deadlines

200
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,269
and we're going to be endlessly

201
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:49,660
chasing them and sending them 10

202
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,180
emails and cold calling them 15

203
00:04:51,339 --> 00:04:52,810
times and sending them texts it's

204
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:54,250
actually going to cost us more

205
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,720
time if we don't set that clear

206
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,350
deadline which a follow-up call is

207
00:04:58,350 --> 00:04:59,930
going to be the most effective way

208
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:01,500
to keep that conversation going

209
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,069
and save you time because it is a

210
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:04,720
clear timeline that makes it less

211
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,079
likely that this falls through the

212
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:08,000
cracks for you or the prospect so

213
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,139
first things first you're going to

214
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:11,040
want to lock in that

215
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:12,519
follow-up call on the first call

216
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:13,930
before you guys hop off so if you

217
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:15,509
are booking in a follow-up call

218
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:16,970
the last thing that should happen

219
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:18,420
on that call obviously you know we

220
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:20,300
agree to a time we send over

221
00:05:20,459 --> 00:05:21,579
that calendar invite they accept

222
00:05:21,579 --> 00:05:22,649
the calendar invite that all

223
00:05:22,649 --> 00:05:23,649
happens before we leave the

224
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:24,079
meeting

225
00:05:24,209 --> 00:05:26,040
you're going to see me mention bam

226
00:05:26,069 --> 00:05:28,240
fam a lot in the next section

227
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,519
which just stands for booking a

228
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,180
meeting from another meeting very

229
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,720
common sales concept and that's

230
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,990
because for warm and cold

231
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,560
prospects

232
00:05:34,699 --> 00:05:36,670
if you didn't close the deal i'd

233
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,199
recommend setting a follow-up call

234
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,750
90 of the time even if it's a

235
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:40,959
couple

236
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,089
months out reason why because like

237
00:05:43,089 --> 00:05:44,949
i said it's it's just a surefire

238
00:05:44,949 --> 00:05:46,879
way to not let sing things slip

239
00:05:47,019 --> 00:05:48,399
through the cracks and even if

240
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:49,980
it's two months out it's always

241
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:51,759
easier to move around an existing

242
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:52,019
meeting

243
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:55,680
rather than creating a new one

244
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,310
which means if i want to talk to

245
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:58,800
somebody it's august right now

246
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:58,959
when

247
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:00,529
i'm recording this in october and

248
00:06:00,529 --> 00:06:01,699
i have a follow-up call on

249
00:06:01,699 --> 00:06:03,360
calendar is it likely that both of

250
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:03,680
us are going

251
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:05,389
to still be free at that time in

252
00:06:05,389 --> 00:06:07,259
october no but the very fact that

253
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:08,819
that is living on their calendar

254
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:09,920
and they see it

255
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,129
makes me more likely for them to

256
00:06:11,129 --> 00:06:12,050
say hey actually i'm not

257
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:13,399
interested in this or hey dan can

258
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:13,680
we just

259
00:06:13,819 --> 00:06:15,300
kick this one more week or hey can

260
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,600
we actually move it from two

261
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:18,459
o'clock to four o'clock as opposed

262
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:18,800
to if

263
00:06:18,939 --> 00:06:20,259
nothing was on their calendar i'm

264
00:06:20,259 --> 00:06:21,730
just another one of the thousands

265
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,120
of emails in their inbox that they

266
00:06:23,259 --> 00:06:24,769
haven't gotten back to right now

267
00:06:24,769 --> 00:06:26,410
it's also important to frame the

268
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:28,160
follow-up call correctly you want

269
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:28,389
this

270
00:06:28,529 --> 00:06:29,980
to seem like a valuable low

271
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:31,709
pressure call where there's

272
00:06:31,709 --> 00:06:33,550
perceived work going into it on

273
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,240
your end and

274
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:35,459
the reason why i put this in bold

275
00:06:35,459 --> 00:06:36,689
is because i can break down each

276
00:06:36,689 --> 00:06:38,240
section for you reason why you

277
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:38,399
might want to

278
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:40,529
make it seem valuable is so

279
00:06:40,529 --> 00:06:43,370
they're excited for that next call

280
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:45,839
because in general a lot of follow

281
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,610
calls there's not much to discuss

282
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:49,240
of them making a decision but we

283
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,199
don't want to frame it that way we

284
00:06:51,329 --> 00:06:52,449
want it to be something where

285
00:06:52,449 --> 00:06:53,709
whether they make a decision

286
00:06:53,709 --> 00:06:54,959
whether they go with us or not

287
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:55,439
they're

288
00:06:55,579 --> 00:06:56,980
going to get value out of that

289
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:58,720
call when i say low pressure once

290
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,319
again we know that there's not

291
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:00,560
much

292
00:07:00,699 --> 00:07:02,870
else to do other than discuss one

293
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:05,189
or two points and make a decision

294
00:07:05,189 --> 00:07:06,879
but we always want to make it

295
00:07:07,019 --> 00:07:08,069
seem like something where it's

296
00:07:08,069 --> 00:07:09,310
super low pressure if they don't

297
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:10,720
make a decision that's completely

298
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,350
fine

299
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,980
because in the back of our head we

300
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:14,540
know if there's not much else to

301
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:15,680
discuss we're going to get to

302
00:07:15,819 --> 00:07:16,800
decision making time on that

303
00:07:16,829 --> 00:07:18,089
follow-up call the tough thing is

304
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,439
actually getting them to show up

305
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:19,600
to

306
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,310
that follow-up call and if it's a

307
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:23,110
high pressure thing like hey okay

308
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,740
cool we'll regroup on tuesday

309
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:26,220
at two o'clock and we'll make a

310
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,889
decision there and they don't have

311
00:07:27,889 --> 00:07:29,759
a decision entering that meeting

312
00:07:29,899 --> 00:07:30,639
guess what they're going to do

313
00:07:30,649 --> 00:07:31,480
they're going to cancel the

314
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,639
meeting they're going to no show

315
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:32,680
the

316
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,019
meeting they're going to try to

317
00:07:34,019 --> 00:07:35,420
kick it down another week whereas

318
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,560
if it's hey you know we'll talk

319
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:36,639
through

320
00:07:36,779 --> 00:07:38,100
any thoughts questions concerns

321
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,449
that you guys have they're more

322
00:07:39,449 --> 00:07:41,199
likely to show up which once again

323
00:07:41,339 --> 00:07:42,259
the the hard part on those

324
00:07:42,259 --> 00:07:43,750
follow-up calls oftentimes isn't

325
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,839
closing them it's just getting

326
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:47,120
them there in the first place and

327
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,149
now when i say whether it's

328
00:07:48,149 --> 00:07:49,759
perceived work going into it on

329
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,000
your

330
00:07:50,139 --> 00:07:51,240
end this is just going to make

331
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,709
them feel like more of an asshole

332
00:07:52,709 --> 00:07:54,639
if they don't show up so these all

333
00:07:54,779 --> 00:07:55,879
three things are just geared to

334
00:07:55,879 --> 00:07:56,810
get them to show up to the

335
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,079
follow-up call because like i

336
00:07:58,079 --> 00:07:58,879
mentioned

337
00:07:59,009 --> 00:08:00,259
that's a difficult part so i'll

338
00:08:00,259 --> 00:08:01,680
just do a quick framing of a bad

339
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,649
follow-up call frame and i'll do

340
00:08:03,689 --> 00:08:04,899
a quick framing of a good

341
00:08:04,899 --> 00:08:06,290
follow-up call frame so bad

342
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,040
follow-up call frame would be okay

343
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:09,920
cool man um

344
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:12,189
you think this over let's touch

345
00:08:12,189 --> 00:08:14,519
base on friday and uh we'll make a

346
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:15,759
decision there

347
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:19,269
horrible right because it's not

348
00:08:19,269 --> 00:08:22,629
valuable we're just gonna think it

349
00:08:22,629 --> 00:08:23,860
over which is how they left

350
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,600
the call anyways and if they don't

351
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,250
have a decision by friday they're

352
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,040
just gonna kick it right or

353
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:29,089
they're

354
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:30,959
not going to show up now a good

355
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:33,139
framing would be like awesome man

356
00:08:33,139 --> 00:08:34,639
on that next call what i'm going

357
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:35,820
to do i'm going to put together a

358
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:36,970
little plan for you guys so you

359
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:38,288
can see what the first 30 days

360
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:38,480
would

361
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:39,809
look like with all this context in

362
00:08:39,809 --> 00:08:41,070
mind now that i really feel like i

363
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,399
understand your business and

364
00:08:42,538 --> 00:08:44,139
what you guys are looking to

365
00:08:44,139 --> 00:08:46,250
accomplish um i'll present that i

366
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,389
think it'll be super valuable for

367
00:08:48,509 --> 00:08:49,409
you guys whether you decide to do

368
00:08:49,409 --> 00:08:50,360
this or not and either way we'll

369
00:08:50,389 --> 00:08:51,330
just talk through any thoughts

370
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:52,929
questions concerns how's that

371
00:08:52,929 --> 00:08:54,340
sound so what i did was i made it

372
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:56,610
valuable i was putting together a

373
00:08:56,639 --> 00:08:56,879
little

374
00:08:57,009 --> 00:08:58,190
plan as i was just pulling that

375
00:08:58,190 --> 00:08:59,659
out of my ass but that's perceived

376
00:08:59,659 --> 00:09:00,799
work going into on my end

377
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,460
and it's a lower pressure because

378
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,100
once again i didn't preface that

379
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,440
they had to make a decision

380
00:09:05,539 --> 00:09:06,690
on that call so all this stuff

381
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:08,169
super important follow-ups when

382
00:09:08,169 --> 00:09:09,440
you're not speaking to the

383
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:09,759
decision

384
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:11,419
maker especially with larger

385
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,179
companies uh you're not always

386
00:09:13,179 --> 00:09:14,320
going to be just speaking to the

387
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:14,639
decision

388
00:09:14,779 --> 00:09:16,299
maker on call one it would be nice

389
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,929
if you could just be like hey man

390
00:09:17,929 --> 00:09:19,519
i only speak to decision makers

391
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:20,639
and just ask for when that

392
00:09:20,669 --> 00:09:21,960
decision maker is going to be

393
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,440
available that's oftentimes

394
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,159
wishful thinking

395
00:09:24,299 --> 00:09:25,360
there's a lot of people in the

396
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,710
sales space who are just like hey

397
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:29,600
don't pitch people who aren't the

398
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:31,340
decision maker but once again it's

399
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:32,779
like how else am i going to get

400
00:09:32,779 --> 00:09:34,379
the decision maker i need to get

401
00:09:34,539 --> 00:09:36,779
this person on the call one over

402
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:39,250
or else they're not just going to

403
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:41,360
run this up the flagpole for me

404
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:42,590
and get that decision maker on a

405
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:45,299
call with me right so obviously

406
00:09:45,299 --> 00:09:48,000
let's qualify them let's take them

407
00:09:48,139 --> 00:09:49,149
through you know maybe a briefer

408
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:50,230
discovery and maybe a briefer

409
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:51,279
pitch but let's get them to the

410
00:09:51,419 --> 00:09:53,440
point where they're excited about

411
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,460
this and then obviously the best

412
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:57,200
outcome here is going to be

413
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:58,279
to book in a follow-up call with

414
00:09:58,279 --> 00:09:59,539
that decision maker but regardless

415
00:09:59,539 --> 00:10:01,200
of whether you get that or not

416
00:10:01,299 --> 00:10:02,539
if we tie down meaning like if we

417
00:10:02,539 --> 00:10:03,679
get that person genuinely

418
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:05,590
interested that we're talking to

419
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,100
they're going to become a champion

420
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,129
for your offer to sell it

421
00:10:08,129 --> 00:10:09,250
internally so they're going to be

422
00:10:09,299 --> 00:10:09,519
more

423
00:10:09,659 --> 00:10:10,909
likely to actually vouch for you

424
00:10:10,909 --> 00:10:12,129
to try to get that guy on a sales

425
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,440
call they're going to be more

426
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,830
likely to actually give this

427
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:16,549
person and present the information

428
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:18,159
for you guys and i talk about this

429
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,200
a lot in the partner objection

430
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,419
because that's that's really kind

431
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:21,360
of like what this is here is

432
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,639
just the ultimate decision maker

433
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:23,620
is not on the phone so i talk

434
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:25,009
about it in the objection handling

435
00:10:25,059 --> 00:10:25,600
video

436
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,830
but the same the same methodology

437
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:29,500
applies here now in cases where

438
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,750
you're not able to book in with

439
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:32,250
the follow-up decision uh with the

440
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:33,549
decision maker for a follow-up

441
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:34,720
call ask for that decision

442
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,970
maker's email and phone number now

443
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,059
the reason why this is important

444
00:10:39,059 --> 00:10:40,639
is because one when you're sending

445
00:10:40,779 --> 00:10:42,000
over follow-up material and

446
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,570
obviously this video is all about

447
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:44,960
how to have a great follow-up

448
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,360
process

449
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:46,240
so if we if we have a great

450
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,539
follow-up process yeah we're going

451
00:10:47,539 --> 00:10:48,639
to want to go straight to the

452
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:48,960
source

453
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,460
and and this is you know a funny

454
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:54,230
thing that that works quite well

455
00:10:54,269 --> 00:10:56,799
if that boss is tied in

456
00:10:56,899 --> 00:10:58,320
on the email communication or i've

457
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,690
done this before grab the phone

458
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:00,720
number and just put these guys

459
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:02,220
in a group chat afterwards this

460
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:03,649
person who's not the decision

461
00:11:03,649 --> 00:11:05,110
maker who you're talking to

462
00:11:06,059 --> 00:11:08,279
they may not care as much about

463
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:10,649
this decision to work with you

464
00:11:10,649 --> 00:11:12,799
guys on their paid ads funnels or

465
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:12,960
not

466
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,639
just because it's not their money

467
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:16,289
like they're not the ones choking

468
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:17,840
the check at the end of the day

469
00:11:17,929 --> 00:11:18,899
so if they go to you it's like

470
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:20,009
it's not that big of a deal and

471
00:11:20,009 --> 00:11:21,490
like the opportunity cost of them

472
00:11:21,539 --> 00:11:21,679
not

473
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:22,889
hitting their goals once again

474
00:11:22,889 --> 00:11:24,139
it's not their business it's not

475
00:11:24,139 --> 00:11:25,740
that big of a deal but if you're

476
00:11:25,899 --> 00:11:27,580
also while you're following up

477
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:29,470
blowing up their boss in an email

478
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:31,440
thread or blowing up their group

479
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,159
chat this

480
00:11:32,299 --> 00:11:34,120
boss is going to make you know

481
00:11:34,149 --> 00:11:36,289
dave who the fuck is this dan guy

482
00:11:36,289 --> 00:11:38,950
that keeps messaging us right uh

483
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,639
which will just increase the

484
00:11:40,649 --> 00:11:42,529
chances that they get back to you

485
00:11:42,529 --> 00:11:44,320
once again even if it's a no we

486
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:44,480
would

487
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,100
rather have that than a bunch of

488
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,809
people just leaving us in the dark

489
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:50,240
now try to maintain frame when you

490
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:51,779
guys are following up with people

491
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:53,090
like we we still don't want to

492
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:54,629
seem overly needy that's still

493
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:54,879
that

494
00:11:55,019 --> 00:11:56,539
message uh of whoever needs to

495
00:11:56,539 --> 00:11:58,190
deal the least usually gets it

496
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:00,000
still applies here what we want to

497
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,399
be is

498
00:12:00,529 --> 00:12:02,279
obnoxiously persistent without

499
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:04,149
seeming needy we're following up

500
00:12:04,149 --> 00:12:05,919
because we're professionals

501
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:07,490
not because we need the client

502
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:09,190
what i mean by professionals and

503
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:10,559
i'll talk about this a little

504
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,000
bit later on i think i have it

505
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,389
right now people who are in sales

506
00:12:14,389 --> 00:12:16,799
which almost all these guys if

507
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:17,279
they're

508
00:12:17,409 --> 00:12:19,049
you know the owner or one of the

509
00:12:19,049 --> 00:12:20,990
decision makers or like c-level

510
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,549
exec they're involved in sales

511
00:12:22,669 --> 00:12:23,830
in some way at their company

512
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:25,259
they're going to respect a real

513
00:12:25,259 --> 00:12:27,120
persistent salesperson 90 of the

514
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:27,279
time

515
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,700
right so like if we're following

516
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,320
up if we're dogging them it's not

517
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,320
going to be because

518
00:12:32,389 --> 00:12:33,250
be because like we're the most

519
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,169
needy people in the world it's

520
00:12:34,169 --> 00:12:35,360
just going to be like okay that's

521
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,580
that's part of the game they'll

522
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:38,559
understand and respect that but in

523
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:41,120
the spirit of not seeming super

524
00:12:41,259 --> 00:12:42,759
needy just had a minute to follow

525
00:12:42,759 --> 00:12:44,330
up here is a better way to open up

526
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:45,840
an email than hey just wanted to

527
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:46,950
check in are you guys still

528
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:48,409
looking for support to get you get

529
00:12:48,409 --> 00:12:50,159
50k a month or should i close this

530
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:50,480
out is

531
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:52,090
better than i'd love to see if we

532
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:53,980
can help you hit 50k a month this

533
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:55,440
is very small things like that

534
00:12:55,559 --> 00:12:56,519
but just keep it in mind as you're

535
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:57,750
writing these follow-up emails and

536
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:00,159
also try to avoid the corporate

537
00:13:00,299 --> 00:13:02,029
jargon when possible as well it's

538
00:13:02,029 --> 00:13:03,809
um it's one of those things where

539
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:05,519
like a pattern breaker is always

540
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:07,320
going to get through and anything

541
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,850
that's just circling back or

542
00:13:08,899 --> 00:13:10,559
anything along those lines that

543
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:10,690
you just

544
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:12,139
hear in the corporate world like

545
00:13:12,139 --> 00:13:13,330
that that shit is just it's so

546
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:14,879
common it's just in one or not the

547
00:13:15,019 --> 00:13:16,679
other people are just desensitized

548
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:18,059
to it they read you know just

549
00:13:18,059 --> 00:13:19,919
circling back just checking in all

550
00:13:20,059 --> 00:13:20,950
these different things here and

551
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:21,840
there's gonna be okay this is

552
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,960
sales email i'm not gonna read the

553
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,120
rest

554
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:24,730
of it now just to give you guys a

555
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:26,549
basic example of what a follow-up

556
00:13:26,549 --> 00:13:28,000
is going to look like that's

557
00:13:28,139 --> 00:13:29,740
going to help after each call and

558
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,330
once again if these guys don't

559
00:13:31,379 --> 00:13:32,639
close on the call which the

560
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:32,960
majority

561
00:13:33,049 --> 00:13:34,269
of prospects won't that's kind of

562
00:13:34,269 --> 00:13:35,889
just the name of the game this

563
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:39,679
type of email is going to work but

564
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:40,230
it's

565
00:13:40,379 --> 00:13:41,700
super important like before just

566
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,159
getting into the email itself that

567
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,559
every single call that goes in the

568
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,289
follow-up gets an email that same

569
00:13:46,289 --> 00:13:47,750
day you can't be lazy with the

570
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,340
stuff you can't be sending them

571
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:51,490
a follow-up email the next day you

572
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:53,559
can't forget to have to send over

573
00:13:53,559 --> 00:13:55,519
an email to a prospect that's

574
00:13:55,629 --> 00:13:57,039
in follow-up i see my reps do this

575
00:13:57,039 --> 00:13:58,409
and i flip out on them because

576
00:13:58,409 --> 00:13:59,990
it's it's the bare minimum to

577
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,299
seeing

578
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:02,279
success with your follow-up but

579
00:14:02,309 --> 00:14:04,269
basic example is you know the key

580
00:14:04,269 --> 00:14:06,159
information you went over maybe

581
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:06,320
that's

582
00:14:06,389 --> 00:14:08,190
a slide deck maybe that's a link

583
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:09,889
to your vsl doc uh a link to the

584
00:14:09,889 --> 00:14:11,590
call summary if you guys are using

585
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,809
a recorder which you should be you

586
00:14:12,809 --> 00:14:14,080
should be recording every single

587
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:14,210
one of

588
00:14:14,379 --> 00:14:15,679
your calls your confidence in

589
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:17,419
helping them conviction sells once

590
00:14:17,419 --> 00:14:18,960
again social proof and

591
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:19,960
the next steps so the next steps

592
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,879
are going to depend on kind of

593
00:14:20,889 --> 00:14:21,679
where you guys left the

594
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:22,159
conversation

595
00:14:22,299 --> 00:14:23,559
off but for example hey tim thanks

596
00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:24,909
again for the time today here's a

597
00:14:24,909 --> 00:14:26,080
link to the call recording and

598
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,889
the roi calculator we went through

599
00:14:27,889 --> 00:14:29,309
on today's call links right

600
00:14:29,309 --> 00:14:31,120
excited to help you guys finally

601
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:31,250
get the

602
00:14:31,409 --> 00:14:32,559
outbound help you need after the

603
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:33,840
agreement signed today so i just

604
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,120
kind of did an example of somebody

605
00:14:35,259 --> 00:14:36,210
that's ready to sign we'll send

606
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:37,399
over an onboarding form and a link

607
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:38,450
to book an onboarding call so we

608
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:38,639
can

609
00:14:38,779 --> 00:14:40,200
stand track to launch before the

610
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,549
end of the month talk soon dan

611
00:14:41,549 --> 00:14:43,779
perfect example don't overthink it

612
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,500
now another thing we want to do

613
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:47,250
here is make sure we're hitting

614
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:49,830
prospects on all platforms a lot

615
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:49,919
of

616
00:14:50,059 --> 00:14:50,980
people have come to me hey i've

617
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:52,000
sent this guy eight emails he

618
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,200
hasn't responded i'm like okay

619
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:53,570
like is he

620
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:54,769
responding over text calling him

621
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:55,929
and they're like oh well i haven't

622
00:14:55,929 --> 00:14:57,250
i haven't thought to call or text

623
00:14:57,299 --> 00:14:57,360
him

624
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,149
huge miss opportunity some

625
00:14:59,149 --> 00:15:01,409
prospects prefer text some prefer

626
00:15:01,409 --> 00:15:03,350
email some prefer phone calls we

627
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:03,519
just

628
00:15:03,659 --> 00:15:04,769
need to take note of where they

629
00:15:04,769 --> 00:15:06,129
seem to be the most responsive her

630
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,580
mosey's talked about this before

631
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:07,759
but

632
00:15:07,889 --> 00:15:09,580
you said the sales rep reach out

633
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:11,629
to people on every single platform

634
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:13,519
before the call even happened

635
00:15:13,659 --> 00:15:15,169
and know where they responded

636
00:15:15,169 --> 00:15:16,850
which i think is a good idea like

637
00:15:16,899 --> 00:15:18,559
you should always be sending

638
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,139
over an email you should always be

639
00:15:20,139 --> 00:15:21,740
sending over text before the call

640
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,029
at the bare minimum if you want

641
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,129
to add in linkedin as well shoot

642
00:15:24,129 --> 00:15:25,320
them a connection request that's

643
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,960
not going to hurt wherever they

644
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,700
respond they're basically showing

645
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,289
you they're that type of person so

646
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:32,000
if i sent somebody an email text

647
00:15:32,129 --> 00:15:33,350
and a linkedin connection request

648
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:34,710
and they connected on linkedin but

649
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:35,919
they didn't respond to any of the

650
00:15:36,059 --> 00:15:37,440
other stuff and they showed up to

651
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,029
the call they've kind of proven to

652
00:15:39,029 --> 00:15:40,480
me already linkedin is their

653
00:15:40,629 --> 00:15:42,299
platform same with texts if

654
00:15:42,299 --> 00:15:44,509
they're texting me back and forth

655
00:15:44,509 --> 00:15:46,559
but they didn't seem to open or

656
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:46,799
respond

657
00:15:46,889 --> 00:15:48,000
to any of the emails like they've

658
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:48,980
proven to me that they're a

659
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,850
texting person now still i don't

660
00:15:51,019 --> 00:15:52,779
want to focus all my energy on

661
00:15:52,779 --> 00:15:54,919
just one platform even after the

662
00:15:54,919 --> 00:15:56,559
call but i'm probably going to

663
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,200
have the best odds on whatever

664
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,980
platform that they responded to

665
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:01,679
and do not stop following up with

666
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,240
them like as i mentioned when

667
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,009
they're finally ready to pull the

668
00:16:05,059 --> 00:16:06,950
trigger oftentimes they'll go with

669
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:09,039
the provider that still happens to

670
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:10,690
be following up with them be

671
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:12,559
creative um simply being a dog

672
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:13,710
and your follow-ups will get you

673
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,830
very far but eventually a lot of

674
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:16,080
prospects will get comfortable

675
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,600
ghosting you they've dehumanized

676
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,940
you in their minds and they're

677
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:20,470
starting to see your message

678
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:22,190
as any other marketing message

679
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,809
because what happens here is i

680
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:25,259
have a good call with them

681
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:26,700
i send them over an email i send

682
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,190
them over another email they're

683
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,669
like i probably should get back to

684
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:30,970
dan you know this is something

685
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:32,289
that we're looking into but for

686
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,740
whatever reason they get super

687
00:16:33,769 --> 00:16:34,240
busy

688
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:35,750
life happens right they've got a

689
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,480
bunch of different priorities uh

690
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,360
and the reality is and why i

691
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:39,509
always

692
00:16:39,649 --> 00:16:41,230
say time kills deals is when

693
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:43,019
they're on the call that's as

694
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:44,950
close to the top of the priority

695
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:45,360
list

696
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,379
as we're going to get unless we

697
00:16:47,379 --> 00:16:49,580
kind of re-engage them and bring

698
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,679
them back through follow but

699
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:52,399
generally

700
00:16:52,509 --> 00:16:53,850
if we're looking at the average

701
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:54,970
prospect on the call the

702
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:56,460
priorities here then it kind of

703
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:57,039
just dwindles

704
00:16:57,179 --> 00:16:58,720
here so other thing takes up their

705
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,460
time takes up their importance and

706
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:01,759
whether it's after my fourth

707
00:17:01,899 --> 00:17:03,110
message or third message you're

708
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:04,480
like oh shit i just got super busy

709
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,279
i haven't been responding to dan

710
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:08,940
and guess what the world's still

711
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:10,609
the same you know the business is

712
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,160
still fine nothing's blowing

713
00:17:12,289 --> 00:17:13,970
up uh you know the sun still rises

714
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:15,578
and the sun still goes down so

715
00:17:15,578 --> 00:17:17,119
it's like okay they're just

716
00:17:17,259 --> 00:17:18,420
looking at it they're like it's

717
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:19,710
fine to dehumanize this person

718
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:21,039
it's just going to be a marketing

719
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:21,359
message

720
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,420
they have to deal with and just

721
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:23,630
look at for two seconds and ignore

722
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:25,009
there's not any real consequences

723
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:27,000
there so what we need to do is

724
00:17:27,029 --> 00:17:29,200
find a way to stand out from all

725
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,509
the other marketing messages

726
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:33,599
that they're getting the way we do

727
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:35,650
that is with a pattern breaker so

728
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:36,670
send over a loom with

729
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:38,190
a gif on their website right i

730
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:39,640
mean you guys have all heard of

731
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,279
loom obviously that's what i'm

732
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:43,069
recording this on if you just

733
00:17:43,069 --> 00:17:44,759
embed a gif and it starts the

734
00:17:44,759 --> 00:17:46,450
video on their website they're

735
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:46,720
going to

736
00:17:46,849 --> 00:17:48,279
see a video of a guy or a girl

737
00:17:48,279 --> 00:17:50,460
talking with their website showing

738
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:52,559
and they're just naturally going

739
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:52,640
to

740
00:17:52,779 --> 00:17:54,150
think what is this person saying

741
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:55,339
about my website because

742
00:17:55,339 --> 00:17:56,880
everybody's so self-absorbed

743
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,279
they're going to be

744
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:58,569
be more likely to click on that

745
00:17:58,569 --> 00:17:59,819
and you're also going to get a

746
00:17:59,819 --> 00:18:01,519
notification when they do click on

747
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:03,119
it and how much they wash of it

748
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:04,920
text them a meme i remember one of

749
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,789
these clients that i close at our

750
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:08,700
cold email agency who was running

751
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,589
like a very big agency well-known

752
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,240
guy in the space and we had a

753
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:13,980
great call and he's just one of

754
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:16,019

kept texting him and text him text

758
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,440
him and all of a sudden like i did

00:18:23,579 --> 00:18:24,740
enough you know hey just had a

760
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:26,049
second to follow up with you or

00:18:26,119 --> 00:18:27,680
have you had a chance to read the

762
00:18:27,829 --> 00:18:29,039
agreement or you know is this

763
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:30,430
still something you guys are

764
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:31,900
looking to do i was just like you

765
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:32,240
know

766
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:34,460
what i got like a meme of super

767
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:36,869
mario throwing a fireball and i

768
00:18:36,869 --> 00:18:39,119
just literally went on like

769
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:39,680
snapchat

770
00:18:39,819 --> 00:18:41,930
and just put in like what was it

771
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:44,269
like ready to finally get calls

772
00:18:44,269 --> 00:18:46,470
with cold email something like

773
00:18:46,619 --> 00:18:47,470
that it wasn't even a great

774
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:48,730
message it was literally just the

775
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:49,579
fact that he saw that

776
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:51,980
and it broke the pattern and he

777
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:53,099
got back to me and he signed on

778
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:54,000
and became a client

779
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:55,599
that's the whole point right we

780
00:18:55,599 --> 00:18:56,819
got to break the pattern

781
00:18:56,819 --> 00:18:58,640
especially with these super busy

782
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,140
guys who

783
00:18:59,349 --> 00:19:00,680
unfortunately a lot of the best

784
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,099
prospects in terms of like the

785
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:03,519
best businesses are those super

786
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:03,759
busy

787
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,720
guys so it's important stuff send

788
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,549
them a voice note um i love voice

789
00:19:07,549 --> 00:19:10,400
notes uh it's it's one of those

790
00:19:10,539 --> 00:19:12,140
things that it's most prospects or

791
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:13,819
most sales guys rather won't have

792
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:16,390
the balls to do that let's stand

793
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:16,559
out

794
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:19,009
these things will catch them off

795
00:19:19,009 --> 00:19:20,210
guard simply because they aren't

796
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:22,079
used to saying seeing it and

797
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:23,890
that can get them to realize that

798
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:25,690
you are actually a human so we've

799
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:27,119
moved from the dehumanized

800
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:27,519
category

801
00:19:27,619 --> 00:19:28,970
to back to being human and they're

802
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:30,380
like shit yeah i probably should

803
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:31,759
get back to dan who's taking the

804
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,710
effort to leave me a voice note to

805
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,509
send me a loom to make a meme for

806
00:19:35,509 --> 00:19:39,009
me right and it's just a reminder

807
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:40,359
like okay there's a real human

808
00:19:40,359 --> 00:19:41,740
behind these messages it's not

809
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:44,079
just a sequence so if this is dan

810
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:44,309
doing

811
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:45,640
this and he's seemingly never

812
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,009
going to stop let him get back to

813
00:19:47,009 --> 00:19:48,710
me even if he tells me no once

814
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,039
again

815
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:50,400
that's still winning my book and

816
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,599
as long as they get back to you

817
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:53,039
that's all you want as i said the

818
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:54,500
goal is to get a decision whether

819
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,819
that's yes or no what we don't

820
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:57,200
want is a bunch of people who have

821
00:19:57,339 --> 00:19:58,910
ghosted us and we're not sure why

822
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:00,299
now this is kind of counter

823
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:02,160
counterintuitive i just said be

824
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:02,720
creative

825
00:20:02,859 --> 00:20:03,920
but i'm also going to say kiss

826
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,220
keep it simple stupid here are a

827
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,720
couple things that everybody loves

828
00:20:06,809 --> 00:20:07,829
to see so if you're ever running

829
00:20:07,869 --> 00:20:09,059
out of ideas you don't have a good

830
00:20:09,059 --> 00:20:10,240
creative idea for a follow-up

831
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:12,660
go back to this numbers and social

832
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,240
proof you get numbers from your

833
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,430
roi calculator you get

834
00:20:15,579 --> 00:20:17,089
social proof from your clients

835
00:20:17,089 --> 00:20:18,529
fomo is very powerful and by

836
00:20:18,529 --> 00:20:20,160
seeing that you can help them

837
00:20:20,299 --> 00:20:21,819
with an issue they haven't fixed

838
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:23,259
yet or that your clients are

839
00:20:23,259 --> 00:20:25,430
winning and they're not that

840
00:20:25,579 --> 00:20:27,490
shit converts lastly you want to

841
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:29,309
leverage novelty people are

842
00:20:29,319 --> 00:20:31,430
intrigued by things that are new

843
00:20:31,579 --> 00:20:33,940
the way that we can do this is by

844
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:36,579
making them another offer so this

845
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,759
is a strategy i like to talk

846
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:38,930
about called the re-offer and

847
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:40,210
here's what that would look like

848
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:41,599
for the sake of the example let's

849
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,160
say you're testing a new guarantee

850
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,519
um hey dan wanted to reach out to

851
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:45,990
you specifically because we're

852
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:46,240
testing

853
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:47,759
something new this week that could

854
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:48,849
help you out with xyz like

855
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,400
whatever you guys are selling uh

856
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:50,559
with

857
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,259
less money down at no risk to you

858
00:20:52,259 --> 00:20:53,880
mind if i send over more info at

859
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,680
this point like i need to leverage

860
00:20:55,819 --> 00:20:56,880
something new this is probably a

861
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,119
colder prospect so i'm not trying

862
00:20:58,119 --> 00:20:59,599
to get them on a call right away

863
00:20:59,599 --> 00:20:59,740
i'm

864
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:01,059
just trying to get them back in

865
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:02,579
the conversation so that's why the

866
00:21:02,579 --> 00:21:04,230
cta is very low friction similar

867
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:04,319
to

868
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:05,660
like sending out a cold email like

869
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:06,750
the good ones are pretty low

870
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,880
friction so this person sees this

871
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,960
i'm kind of dangling this new

872
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,240
novel thing over their head and

873
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,839
it's a super low friction cta so

874
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:16,000
it's

875
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,619
like yeah send it over right now

876
00:21:17,619 --> 00:21:19,250
we've successfully presented

877
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:20,950
something new to them and made it

878
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:21,359
easy for

879
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,710
them to get back to us with a

880
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:24,269
simple yes send it over and we've

881
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:26,140
got another chance to share that

882
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:26,400
new

883
00:21:26,539 --> 00:21:27,990
guarantee ask for another call to

884
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:29,509
see if the time is better and once

885
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:31,039
they're on another call we can

886
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:31,279
make

887
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:33,279
another ask for their business

888
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:35,279
more asks equals more sales and

889
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:37,039
guys this concept of just a

890
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:37,519
re-offer

891
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:39,359
of presenting something new and

892
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:41,039
saying mind if i send it over it

893
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:42,480
can be used in so many different

894
00:21:42,619 --> 00:21:43,589
ways you don't actually have to

895
00:21:43,589 --> 00:21:44,660
have a new guarantee you don't

896
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:46,480
actually have to have a new offer

897
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:46,950
you can

898
00:21:47,079 --> 00:21:48,589
be willing to come down a couple

899
00:21:48,589 --> 00:21:50,369
hundred dollars on your price and

900
00:21:50,369 --> 00:21:52,000
call it an end-a-month promo

901
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:53,250
hey wanted to reach out to you

902
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:54,869
specifically because we're testing

903
00:21:54,869 --> 00:21:56,000
something new this week

904
00:21:56,119 --> 00:21:57,500
um that could help you out with

905
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,910
xyz with less money down at no

906
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:00,240
risk to you mind if i send it over

907
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:00,559
it's the

908
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:01,819
same thing i'm just not testing a

909
00:22:01,819 --> 00:22:02,900
new guarantee i just have an

910
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:05,920
end-a-month promo right and the

911
00:22:06,069 --> 00:22:08,109
concept of fast action bonuses are

912
00:22:08,109 --> 00:22:10,220
really really helpful because it

913
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:12,000
kind of goes into the the whole

914
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:13,410
follow-up methodology with like

915
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:14,759
one of the most important things

916
00:22:14,759 --> 00:22:16,160
here is just setting a clear

917
00:22:16,309 --> 00:22:18,109
timeline and if we're setting a

918
00:22:18,119 --> 00:22:20,089
clear timeline that's great if

919
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:21,839
these guys aren't abiding

920
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,440
by the timeline it's like okay we

921
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,769
need to kind of reinforce and

922
00:22:24,859 --> 00:22:25,900
almost manufacture

923
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,240
a new timeline so having a random

924
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,460
end of month promo that can come

925
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:31,440
back or saying

926
00:22:31,579 --> 00:22:32,750
that you know we'd be willing to

927
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,009
do this if they move forward by

928
00:22:34,009 --> 00:22:35,200
the end of the week like that

929
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:35,440
stuff

930
00:22:35,579 --> 00:22:37,299
really works i know over at our

931
00:22:37,299 --> 00:22:39,309
other company we use fast action

932
00:22:39,309 --> 00:22:41,200
bonuses all the time uh even on

933
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:41,279
the

934
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:42,869
calls themselves uh just because

935
00:22:42,869 --> 00:22:44,349
we know that once people get off

936
00:22:44,349 --> 00:22:46,000
the call they're much less likely

937
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:46,160
to

938
00:22:46,299 --> 00:22:47,230
close so a lot of times we'll

939
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:48,500
throw in a hey if you move forward

940
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,759
by the end of the week we'll give

941
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:51,279
you 200 off setup we'll give you

942
00:22:51,279 --> 00:22:52,859
300 off the setup just because we

943
00:22:52,859 --> 00:22:55,359
know that at scale

944
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,670
that trade-off of i give you a

945
00:22:57,670 --> 00:23:00,180
couple hundred dollars off or i

946
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:02,240
give you this extra deliverable

947
00:23:02,359 --> 00:23:04,069
in exchange for you moving quicker

00:23:04,069 --> 00:23:06,039
than you would otherwise it's

949
00:23:06,039 --> 00:23:09,829
worth it trust me now bonus don't

00:23:41,069 --> 00:23:43,519
also in sales as well most of

971
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:44,869
the time so they will understand

972
00:23:44,869 --> 00:23:46,220
it 90 of the time like i can't

973
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:47,440
tell you how many times i've

974
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:47,680
gotten

975
00:23:47,819 --> 00:23:50,970
the feedback of hey dan um respect

976
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:54,250
it respect the persistence i i've

977
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:56,880
gotten that probably a hundred

978
00:23:57,019 --> 00:23:59,130
times not even joking with a guy

979
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:01,299
being like dude respect let me

980
00:24:01,299 --> 00:24:03,599
actually get back to you this week

981
00:24:04,299 --> 00:24:05,930
versus i can remember maybe two

982
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:07,750
times in my life somebody told me

983
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:08,880
to fuck off because i was

984
00:24:09,029 --> 00:24:10,450
following up too much both the

985
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:11,990
times i had a shitty grade on my

986
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,500
face so it's like cool like i

987
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,000
found out

988
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:15,730
where the line is so i go right up

989
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:17,470
to that line and try not to cross

990
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:18,960
it but if if the ratio is a

991
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:19,269
hundred

992
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:20,329
to two that should all be

993
00:24:20,329 --> 00:24:21,690
encouraging to you guys like do

994
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:22,730
not worry about being an

995
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:23,920
inconvenience this guy

996
00:24:24,049 --> 00:24:25,650
we're here to help they get it

997
00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:27,700
they'll respect it actually most

998
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:30,640
of the time um so yeah now

999
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,029
obviously

1000
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,359
follow-up stuff is so important

1001
00:24:34,359 --> 00:24:36,619
but almost none of it's possible

1002
00:24:36,619 --> 00:24:38,720
if we don't have a crm so here's

1003
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:38,799
how

1004
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,289
to get the most out of your crm

1005
00:24:40,289 --> 00:24:41,910
first off not having crm in sales

1006
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,579
is just gross negligence i'm not

1007
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:43,759
saying

1008
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:45,059
you need hubspot right off the bat

1009
00:24:45,059 --> 00:24:46,220
which we use for our companies

1010
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,680
it's a little more expensive we'll

1011
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:48,720
be showing you how to use go high

1012
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,759
level obviously if you've seen

1013
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:50,880
some of that content you already

1014
00:24:51,009 --> 00:24:52,240
know that but having a place to

1015
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,740
keep track of where people are at

1016
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:55,269
in your pipeline is an absolute

1017
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:55,759
must

1018
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,339
not doing this will guarantee that

1019
00:24:57,339 --> 00:24:58,880
your business makes thousands of

1020
00:24:58,890 --> 00:24:59,680
dollars less than it would

1021
00:24:59,829 --> 00:25:01,369
otherwise so if you guys want that

1022
00:25:01,369 --> 00:25:03,119
guarantee go ahead don't follow up

1023
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:04,460
with people or don't use

1024
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,779
a crm because it's you're just not

1025
00:25:05,779 --> 00:25:06,779
going to follow people as

1026
00:25:06,779 --> 00:25:08,539
effectively if you do want to make

1027
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:10,380
thousands of dollars more listen

1028
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:11,799
up as you know the goal is to

1029
00:25:11,799 --> 00:25:13,339
follow up with every single

1030
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:13,829
prospect

1031
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,460
until they are either won or lost

1032
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:17,079
it's kind of the same thing that i

1033
00:25:17,079 --> 00:25:18,480
said earlier right it's just

1034
00:25:18,619 --> 00:25:19,779
getting decisions until then we

1035
00:25:19,779 --> 00:25:20,970
should strive to always have a

1036
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:22,400
next step and you'll see inside of

1037
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:23,819
go high level you'll see inside of

1038
00:25:23,819 --> 00:25:25,250
any crm in the world regardless of

1039
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:26,400
what you're using there's

1040
00:25:26,539 --> 00:25:28,559
always a good place to just set a

1041
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:30,720
next step to set a new task right

1042
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,160
and even if it's not like

1043
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,970
a clear task that me and the

1044
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:36,279
prospect both know like let's say

1045
00:25:36,279 --> 00:25:38,710
they said to check in uh in a few

1046
00:25:38,859 --> 00:25:40,220
weeks which is super vague i'm

1047
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:41,630
just going to put that task two

1048
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:43,190
weeks from now to send them an

1049
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:43,599
email

1050
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:45,150
to give them a call right very

1051
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:46,930
very important that we're always

1052
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,559
having a next step for people

1053
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:48,960
until

1054
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:50,440
they're either in the close loss

1055
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,809
or close one column now most of

1056
00:25:51,809 --> 00:25:53,200
the calls you take wind up in the

1057
00:25:53,339 --> 00:25:54,630
follow process before they close

1058
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:55,930
that's just the name of the game

1059
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:57,670
right so if you don't have a crm

1060
00:25:57,819 --> 00:25:59,059
your probability of closing the

1061
00:25:59,059 --> 00:26:00,380
majority of prospects you ever

1062
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:02,000
speak to goes down once again guys

1063
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:02,150
i know

1064
00:26:02,289 --> 00:26:03,279
all this stuff is obvious it's

1065
00:26:03,309 --> 00:26:04,539
cliches but there's a reason why

1066
00:26:04,539 --> 00:26:05,809
i'm saying it four or five times

1067
00:26:05,859 --> 00:26:05,920
it's

1068
00:26:06,059 --> 00:26:07,759
just because it's that important

1069
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:09,670
here's some basic pipeline stages

1070
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:11,190
and you guys can kind of see

1071
00:26:11,339 --> 00:26:13,150
what this looks like here because

1072
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,769
i already set this up in this

1073
00:26:14,769 --> 00:26:18,519
video but schedule call no show

1074
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,109
hot list contract scent follow up

1075
00:26:20,109 --> 00:26:21,670
holding nurturing close one close

1076
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,339
loss just give you guys

1077
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:24,750
context on what everything is

1078
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,279
schedule call really doesn't need

1079
00:26:26,349 --> 00:26:27,920
any explanation they book a call

1080
00:26:28,059 --> 00:26:29,609
you have it connected to your uh

1081
00:26:29,609 --> 00:26:31,430
calendar which is also and go high

1082
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:33,190
level so it automatically appears

1083
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:34,309
in this column then depending on

1084
00:26:34,349 --> 00:26:35,470
what happens you move them into

1085
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:36,640
one of these no show they don't

1086
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:36,849
show

1087
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,000
up these are the ones that we want

1088
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:39,160
to focus on because these are the

1089
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:39,799
ones that are not

1090
00:26:41,339 --> 00:26:42,980
close one or close loss yet and uh

1091
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:44,529
you know they're still worth

1092
00:26:44,579 --> 00:26:46,960
following up with so hot list

1093
00:26:47,099 --> 00:26:48,390
contract sense keys on the end of

1094
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:49,769
the call bam fam we talked about

1095
00:26:49,769 --> 00:26:50,960
this booking a meeting from

1096
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:51,200
another

1097
00:26:51,339 --> 00:26:52,970
meeting isolating the objection

1098
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:54,390
right we want to have like if

1099
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:56,160
they're in the hot list contract

1100
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:56,720
set

1101
00:26:56,859 --> 00:26:57,920
this is like the one yard line

1102
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,250
guys right these are the verbal

1103
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:00,480
commitments these are the people

1104
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:00,640
that

1105
00:27:00,779 --> 00:27:02,099
owe us money so this is the if i'm

1106
00:27:02,099 --> 00:27:03,549
looking at my crm and looking at

1107
00:27:03,579 --> 00:27:05,359
the opportunities in a given day

1108
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,960
and i only have a few minutes i'm

1109
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,559
gonna focus most of my effort on

1110
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:09,750
the hot list right because

1111
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,619
these are the people that are

1112
00:27:11,619 --> 00:27:13,720
closest to closing at the moment

1113
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,750
here so with that in mind those

1114
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:16,000
people

1115
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:17,289
that are very close to closing

1116
00:27:17,289 --> 00:27:18,509
keys to the end of the call i'd

1117
00:27:18,509 --> 00:27:19,839
still want to book follow-up

1118
00:27:19,839 --> 00:27:20,240
meeting

1119
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:21,599
most of the time i want to isolate

1120
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:22,970
that objection so it's not one or

1121
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:24,079
two or three things that they

1122
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:25,539
think about in order to get to the

1123
00:27:25,539 --> 00:27:27,000
sale maybe it's just that one case

1124
00:27:27,069 --> 00:27:28,400
study that they need to see

1125
00:27:28,539 --> 00:27:30,009
maybe it's literally just uh they

1126
00:27:30,009 --> 00:27:31,309
they want to do it um but they

1127
00:27:31,309 --> 00:27:32,460
just need to check in with their

1128
00:27:32,579 --> 00:27:33,990
co-founder to make sure they're on

1129
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:35,400
the same page having a very clear

1130
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,869
timeline guys what i mean by

1131
00:27:37,019 --> 00:27:38,529
clear timeline here if somebody

1132
00:27:38,529 --> 00:27:39,809
says like yeah i'll sign the

1133
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:41,660
contract today i'd ask them like

1134
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:41,920
cool when

1135
00:27:42,049 --> 00:27:43,579
do you think you'll have 15

1136
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:45,349
minutes to do that so i'm getting

1137
00:27:45,349 --> 00:27:47,059
the time of the day they say four

1138
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:47,759
o'clock

1139
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:49,220
okay awesome the reason why you

1140
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:50,769
just want them to verbalize that

1141
00:27:50,779 --> 00:27:52,799
is because i don't want to seem

1142
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:54,539
like i'm i'm too needy once again

1143
00:27:54,549 --> 00:27:56,309
but if it's four o'clock was when

1144
00:27:56,309 --> 00:27:57,759
they told me and now it's five

1145
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:58,829
o'clock i'm gonna check into them

1146
00:27:58,829 --> 00:27:59,890
hey i know you mentioned you'd be

1147
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:00,880
reading this at four do you have

1148
00:28:01,019 --> 00:28:02,619
any questions on the agreement

1149
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:04,630
easy follow-up getting that verbal

1150
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:06,000
commitment on the call

1151
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:07,539
itself um you know whether that's

1152
00:28:07,539 --> 00:28:08,920
to read the agreement whether

1153
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,059
that's to sign up and the keys

1154
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:11,269
for follow-up here is really just

1155
00:28:11,269 --> 00:28:12,450
brute force once again these are

1156
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:13,519
the people that have given

1157
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:14,809
you essentially a verbal

1158
00:28:14,809 --> 00:28:16,450
commitment um there's maybe just

1159
00:28:16,509 --> 00:28:18,299
one outstanding item they need to

1160
00:28:18,319 --> 00:28:18,660
do

1161
00:28:18,829 --> 00:28:20,279
so don't overthink it don't worry

1162
00:28:20,279 --> 00:28:21,829
about being an inconvenience the

1163
00:28:21,839 --> 00:28:23,190
cta here is moving forward

1164
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:26,529
right text call email do whatever

1165
00:28:26,529 --> 00:28:28,970
we do uh obviously like you don't

1166
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:30,319
have to be crazy over

1167
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:31,940
the top if they told you yeah i'm

1168
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:33,559
ready to do this tomorrow until

1169
00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:35,089
that deadline passes but that's

1170
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:36,630
once again why it's so important

1171
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:38,039
to have a very clear timeline but

1172
00:28:38,109 --> 00:28:40,079
once again hot list ctas focus

1173
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:41,930
on moving forward follow-up keys

1174
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:43,410
the end of the call um bam fam

1175
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:44,960
once again want to book in a

1176
00:28:45,099 --> 00:28:46,910
follow-up meeting and the keys for

1177
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:48,599
uh you know follow-up emails is

1178
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:50,230
going to be to recap the first

1179
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:51,690
meeting with that follow-up email

1180
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:53,140
uh social proof in between meeting

1181
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:55,599
one and meeting two so if i have

1182
00:28:55,609 --> 00:28:57,400

00:29:04,579 --> 00:29:06,319
email right after that call and

1188
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:06,480
then

1189
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:08,609
probably friday monday morning i'm

1190
00:29:08,609 --> 00:29:10,269
just going to send them more

1191
00:29:10,269 --> 00:29:12,079
social proof just quick check-in

1192
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:13,960
confirm the appointment make sure

1193
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,569
we're good to go here right and

1194
00:29:15,569 --> 00:29:17,349
also with those check-ins before

1195
00:29:17,369 --> 00:29:19,069
a follow-up call i don't really

1196
00:29:19,069 --> 00:29:20,809
want to ask to make sure they're

1197
00:29:20,809 --> 00:29:22,000
good to go i i want to

1198
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,119
assumptively

1199
00:29:23,259 --> 00:29:24,880
close them on that time meaning i

1200
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,509
don't want to give them an easy

1201
00:29:26,509 --> 00:29:28,079
out by asking if the time still

1202
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:29,900
works for them i just want to say

1203
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,930
looking forward to speaking to you

1204
00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:33,440
at two o'clock so it's more of a

1205
00:29:33,589 --> 00:29:35,900
reminder as opposed to confirming

1206
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:38,180
the appointment i guess right um

1207
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:40,690
reminding them of their struggles

1208
00:29:40,859 --> 00:29:42,119
and their goals that's important

1209
00:29:42,119 --> 00:29:43,329
too uh once again we don't want

1210
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,960
them to lose sight of that because

1211
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:45,039
a

1212
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,119
lot of times it will between the

1213
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:47,339
first and second call look forward

1214
00:29:47,339 --> 00:29:48,559
to helping you fix your outbound

1215
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:50,519
strategies to get 100k a month by

1216
00:29:50,549 --> 00:29:52,160
the end of the year right problem

1217
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,000
outbound strategy goal 100k a

1218
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:55,500
month by the end of the year cta

1219
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,059
here is focused on the next step

1220
00:29:57,059 --> 00:29:59,039
for people in the follow-up column

1221
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:00,559
so this is essentially people that

1222
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:01,950
have a clear follow-up within the

1223
00:30:02,029 --> 00:30:03,509
next 30 days or clear next

1224
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:05,849
step in the 30 days so the cta is

1225
00:30:05,849 --> 00:30:07,779
focused on that next step now

1226
00:30:07,779 --> 00:30:09,839
holding nurturing is basically

1227
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:10,309
anybody

1228
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:11,900
this the coldest of the follow-up

1229
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,549
pipeline dispositions is anybody

1230
00:30:13,549 --> 00:30:14,789
that has a next step that's

1231
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:17,559
past 30 days um or you know we

1232
00:30:17,559 --> 00:30:20,069
failed to get a next step on the

1233
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:22,319
call uh or they gave us like a

1234
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:22,559
real

1235
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,180
soft no like more of a not for now

1236
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:25,890
than anything else or like a real

1237
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:27,730
vague maybe we're we're kind

1238
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:28,759
of going through this we don't

1239
00:30:28,759 --> 00:30:30,009
really have a clear timeline all

1240
00:30:30,009 --> 00:30:32,150
right keys to the end of the call

1241
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:32,400
if

1242
00:30:32,529 --> 00:30:34,039
we can if it makes sense i would

1243
00:30:34,039 --> 00:30:35,910
still book another meeting in and

1244
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:37,670
the keys for follow-ups social

1245
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:38,000
proof

1246
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:39,200
this is one of those things where

1247
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,049
like with these guys they're more

1248
00:30:41,049 --> 00:30:43,440
so cold enough to the point where

1249
00:30:43,579 --> 00:30:45,390
we need to get them back into a

1250
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:47,910
conversation whereas like for this

1251
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,440
it's like we need to get

1252
00:30:49,579 --> 00:30:50,450
them to move forward in the hot

1253
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:51,529
list and the follow-up we need to

1254
00:30:51,529 --> 00:30:53,279
get them focused on the next step

1255
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,400
here it's like we just need to

1256
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:55,740
re-engage them so it's almost like

1257
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:56,930
we're remarketing this person

1258
00:30:57,079 --> 00:30:58,619
to get them back into a situation

1259
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,069
where we can get them on a call

1260
00:31:00,119 --> 00:31:01,740
again where we can make an ask for

1261
00:31:01,839 --> 00:31:03,680
a sale more ask more sales but

1262
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,920
social proof here um like numbers

1263
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:08,079
social proof everybody loves that

1264
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:09,309
sequences is on top of them

1265
00:31:09,309 --> 00:31:10,980
without burning out so sequences

1266
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:12,470
is just automation and that's what

1267
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:12,549
i'm

1268
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:13,680
going to show you guys how to do

1269
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:14,750
uh at the end of this video is

1270
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:16,079
basically just showing you how to

1271
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:17,730
set up a simple automation for

1272
00:31:17,730 --> 00:31:19,319
people who are in the holding

1273
00:31:19,319 --> 00:31:21,119
nurturing here and questions to

1274
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:21,349
see if

1275
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:22,539
they still have a need for this

1276
00:31:22,539 --> 00:31:23,569
right the cta is focused on

1277
00:31:23,569 --> 00:31:25,009
starting the conversation about

1278
00:31:25,059 --> 00:31:25,200
their

1279
00:31:25,329 --> 00:31:27,240
outbound problems again or in this

1280
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,210
situation if you're selling paid

1281
00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:30,799
ads or whatever just get them

1282
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:32,259
focused on their problems again so

1283
00:31:32,259 --> 00:31:33,319
they're ready to have the

1284
00:31:33,319 --> 00:31:34,859
conversation about that and once

1285
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:35,359
they are

1286
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:36,660
great cool get them on a call

1287
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:38,240
we'll kind of restart from there

1288
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,750
if you have time this week and

1289
00:31:39,759 --> 00:31:40,000
still

1290
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,089
i've been able to generate those

1291
00:31:41,089 --> 00:31:42,380
10 qualified calls a week you were

1292
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:43,279
looking for it'd be great

1293
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:44,240
to catch up and share what our

1294
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,289
cold email strategy would look

1295
00:31:45,289 --> 00:31:46,339
like for you do you have 10

1296
00:31:46,339 --> 00:31:46,559
minutes

1297
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:47,980
this week so you can see how we're

1298
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:49,400
kind of almost marketing to them

1299
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,950
again now in terms of automation

1300
00:31:51,099 --> 00:31:52,799
sequences here in frequency in

1301
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:55,130
which you should use it should go

1302
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:58,079
one holding nurturing two follow

1303
00:31:58,230 --> 00:32:00,650
three hot list right so if you

1304
00:32:00,650 --> 00:32:02,000
have a general

1305
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:04,259
case study or like some flow you

1306
00:32:04,259 --> 00:32:06,170
want to put people through

1307
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:08,000
follow-ups in you can absolutely

1308
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:08,160
do

1309
00:32:08,299 --> 00:32:09,599
that right i would just have it

1310
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:10,990
almost look like a little bit

1311
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:12,940
different so you have your primary

1312
00:32:13,099 --> 00:32:14,690
thread which is like you manually

1313
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:16,410
sending out your message which is

1314
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:17,920
a recap of the first meeting

1315
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,170
i would still have that thread be

1316
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:20,289
focused on the next steps for

1317
00:32:20,289 --> 00:32:21,759
questions whatever that may be but

1318
00:32:21,849 --> 00:32:23,029
if you want to also enroll them in

1319
00:32:23,029 --> 00:32:24,369
another sequence that just shares

1320
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,519
basic social proof that's

1321
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:27,279
completely fine it's like a nice

1322
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:28,970
to have not a need to have here in

1323
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:30,640
terms of where you need to have

1324
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:31,829
it is in the holding nurturing

1325
00:32:31,829 --> 00:32:33,049
here because like i said want to

1326
00:32:33,059 --> 00:32:34,240
be able to stay on top of all

1327
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:34,400
these

1328
00:32:34,539 --> 00:32:35,920
prospects without burning out so

1329
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,329
if you don't have a sequence it's

1330
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:40,000
really tough to look at somebody

1331
00:32:40,119 --> 00:32:41,690
on you know your pipeline that you

1332
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:43,220
talked to three months ago and

1333
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:44,880
have the energy or have the the

1334
00:32:45,019 --> 00:32:46,140
bandwidth to type up a super

1335
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,779
manual message for those person so

1336
00:32:47,779 --> 00:32:48,720
it's a need to have for the

1337
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:48,940
holding

1338
00:32:49,109 --> 00:32:50,589
nurturing guys it's nice to have

1339
00:32:50,589 --> 00:32:52,140
for follow up i wouldn't bother

1340
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:55,430
with the hot list uh contract sent

1341
00:32:55,579 --> 00:32:57,829
people because here it's like more

1342
00:32:57,839 --> 00:32:59,819
could be less right we we just

1343
00:32:59,819 --> 00:33:01,599
want to keep them focused on that

1344
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:02,829
one outstanding thing and if

1345
00:33:02,829 --> 00:33:04,210
there's only one thing they're on

1346
00:33:04,279 --> 00:33:05,599
that one yard line that's keeping

1347
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:07,410
them from moving forward sending

1348
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:08,930
them over a bunch of stuff and

1349
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:10,480
having them lose sight of that

1350
00:33:10,619 --> 00:33:11,930
one thing can actually do us a

1351
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:13,420
disservice so here it's like no

1352
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:15,119
this is all manual this is brute

1353
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:15,920
force

1354
00:33:16,059 --> 00:33:17,039
this is something where if you

1355
00:33:17,069 --> 00:33:18,299
have a nice sequence that you want

1356
00:33:18,309 --> 00:33:19,359
everybody to see you can

1357
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:20,740
also do that would still have a

1358
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:22,900
separate thread that kind of still

1359
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:25,119
focuses manually on that next

1360
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:26,619
step with this person and here's

1361
00:33:26,619 --> 00:33:27,900
where it's it's pretty much

1362
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:29,589
necessary especially at scale and

1363
00:33:29,599 --> 00:33:29,680
you

1364
00:33:29,819 --> 00:33:31,480
can get by without setting this up

1365
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,150
right away but as you guys have a

1366
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:35,599
more mature pipeline where there's

1367
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:36,690
prospects in there that are

1368
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:37,930
multiple months old really the

1369
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:39,119
only way to stay on top of these

1370
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:39,599
guys without

1371
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:41,200
burning out is by having a

1372
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,250
sequence so with that being said

1373
00:33:43,299 --> 00:33:45,440
let's go into how to set up a

1374
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:45,920
sequence

1375
00:33:46,059 --> 00:33:47,549
for people in holding nurturing so

1376
00:33:47,549 --> 00:33:48,930
one of the cool things about go

1377
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:50,160
high level setting up an

1378
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:50,640
automation

1379
00:33:50,779 --> 00:33:52,730
is is very very simple um once

1380
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:54,809
again this is a tool that has a

1381
00:33:54,809 --> 00:33:56,720
lot of content out there about it

1382
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:56,880
too

1383
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,319
so you can go to youtube uh you

1384
00:33:58,319 --> 00:33:59,809
can ask chat gpt for questions

1385
00:33:59,809 --> 00:34:01,759
about how to set up a sequence but

1386
00:34:01,759 --> 00:34:02,769
i'm just going to show you real

1387
00:34:02,769 --> 00:34:03,880
quick how to set up a pretty basic

1388
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,960
one so what i would do on this

1389
00:34:05,099 --> 00:34:06,750
left hand side is going to

1390
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:09,139
automation go to create workflow

1391
00:34:09,139 --> 00:34:10,559
start from scratch

1392
00:34:10,699 --> 00:34:13,570
and i'm going to start this with

1393
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:17,199
trigger the trigger would be

1394
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:20,800
let's go to pipeline status

1395
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:24,159
changed add filters here

1396
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:30,480
so in pipeline sales pipeline

1397
00:34:33,579 --> 00:34:33,920
stage

1398
00:34:34,059 --> 00:34:37,019
for this example is holding

1399
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:39,019
nurturing because like i said it's

1400
00:34:39,019 --> 00:34:40,159
most important to have sequences

1401
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,539
and automation for these guys uh

1402
00:34:41,539 --> 00:34:44,719
save trigger so let's say after um

1403
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,400
after our meetings we're always

1404
00:34:46,539 --> 00:34:47,860
sending over a recap email right

1405
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:49,260
but let's say for these holding

1406
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:50,869
nurturing people we want to wait a

1407
00:34:51,019 --> 00:34:52,219
few days until we kind of enroll

1408
00:34:52,219 --> 00:34:53,739
them into this marketing sequence

1409
00:34:53,739 --> 00:34:55,440
here so what i would do then go to

1410
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:55,659
wait

1411
00:34:58,539 --> 00:35:03,039
three days

1412
00:35:03,179 --> 00:35:03,829
save action

1413
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:06,559
email

1414
00:35:06,699 --> 00:35:10,880
uh let's go to from

1415
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:15,519
get this thing out of here user

1416
00:35:15,519 --> 00:35:19,030
email or no

1417
00:35:19,179 --> 00:35:23,780
mess that up this is the first

1418
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:24,969

template

1424
00:35:35,739 --> 00:35:36,960
obviously if you have templates

1425
00:35:36,969 --> 00:35:38,710
you can use that just say hey uh

1426
00:35:38,769 --> 00:35:41,039

so

1436
00:36:22,849 --> 00:36:36,079
now ideally you want to add things

1437
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,190

send email it'd be the same steps

1446
00:37:02,519 --> 00:37:02,989
above

1447
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:15,369
um

1448
00:37:15,579 --> 00:37:17,440
so

1449
00:37:17,579 --> 00:37:23,429
so

1450
00:37:23,579 --> 00:37:25,440

1452
00:37:54,599 --> 00:37:56,639
all right okay cool i'm just gonna

00:37:56,789 --> 00:38:00,090
fill this stuff in real quick let

1454
00:38:00,090 --> 00:38:00,880
me just pause it

1455
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:03,949
okay so you just see that threw in

1456
00:38:03,949 --> 00:38:04,940
some sample copy there

1457
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:09,420
cool cool cool uh it should feel

1458
00:38:09,429 --> 00:38:10,320
before saving them

1459
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:16,699
all right dope uh now let's say we

1460
00:38:16,699 --> 00:38:17,360
want to add in

1461
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:22,480
one more wait period one day

1462
00:38:24,619 --> 00:38:28,400
and then bounce over to another

1463
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:31,360
platform you can use sms here uh

1464
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:33,119
so if you guys have a

1465
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:34,739
twilio account connected here they

1466
00:38:34,739 --> 00:38:35,840
use through this if you guys are

1467
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,179
just sending uh so you can

1468
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,320
go through the integrations there

1469
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,809
and set up the twilio number if

1470
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:40,960
you want but let's say you're

1471
00:38:41,090 --> 00:38:42,349
just uh sending these messages

1472
00:38:42,349 --> 00:38:43,510
manually from your iphone

1473
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:45,429
whichiphones will convert better

1474
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:46,849
at the end of the day this is more

1475
00:38:46,849 --> 00:38:48,280
so going to be a manual action so

1476
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,599
it's going to be a reminder

1477
00:38:49,739 --> 00:38:51,260
for you to send over this but once

1478
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,059
again still works you'll just get

1479
00:38:53,059 --> 00:38:54,159
a reminder like hey

1480
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:57,440

1481
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:08,739
uh contact first name

1482
00:39:09,019 --> 00:39:12,309
all right then maybe a couple days

1483
00:39:12,309 --> 00:39:12,940
later

1484
00:39:13,099 --> 00:39:23,809
this email can maybe be um a

1485
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:27,199
little bit more drawn out contacts

1486
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:29,599
ask them uh if you know they're

1487
00:39:29,739 --> 00:39:31,320
still looking to launch paid ads

1488
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,039
in q4 if they're ready to close

1489
00:39:33,039 --> 00:39:34,480
this out and then a couple days

1490
00:39:34,619 --> 00:39:35,900
later i can do another manual sms

1491
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:37,400
message uh that kind of reiterates

1492
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:38,880
the same thing so i'm hash out the

1493
00:39:39,019 --> 00:39:40,210
offer saying hey it looks like you

1494
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:41,429
haven't been able to get back to

1495
00:39:41,429 --> 00:39:42,320
any of these emails

1496
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:45,539
but one of those things where in

1497
00:39:45,539 --> 00:39:46,960
the sphere of not worrying about

1498
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,639
being an inconvenience make this

1499
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:50,079
literally as long as you guys want

1500
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:53,530
it can be 10 emails it can be 10

1501
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:55,039
emails and three text messages

1502
00:39:55,179 --> 00:39:56,809
right if you're spacing it out

1503
00:39:56,809 --> 00:39:58,500
it's not gonna be that big of a

1504
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,920
deal and once again once they tell

1505
00:40:00,059 --> 00:40:02,159
you a no or yes uh either if it's

1506
00:40:02,159 --> 00:40:04,230
a no we close them out we move

1507
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:06,159
them to close loss once again

1508
00:40:06,159 --> 00:40:06,389
that's

1509
00:40:06,539 --> 00:40:07,699
one of my book if they tell you a

1510
00:40:07,699 --> 00:40:09,000
yes a lot of times it's going to

1511
00:40:09,079 --> 00:40:10,400
be like a yes we're revisiting

1512
00:40:10,539 --> 00:40:11,969
this then but then we can move

1513
00:40:11,969 --> 00:40:14,019
them from holding nurturing into a

1514
00:40:14,019 --> 00:40:16,159
warmer disposition like follow

1515
00:40:16,269 --> 00:40:17,670
up like hot lists or hopefully we

1516
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:19,000
can get them back on a call and

1517
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,119
close them right away anyways um

1518
00:40:21,269 --> 00:40:24,219
before i do this let's just delete

1519
00:40:24,219 --> 00:40:26,639
this right here delete action

1520
00:40:26,639 --> 00:40:29,360
everything else is good uh going

1521
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:31,880
over the settings real quick uh i

1522
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:34,210
wouldn't allow re-entry just

1523
00:40:34,210 --> 00:40:35,519
because it's going to be a little

1524
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:35,679
bit

1525
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:36,880
awkward if somebody moves out of

1526
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,039
there that moves back in if they

1527
00:40:38,039 --> 00:40:39,119
get enrolled into the same

1528
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:39,599
sequence

1529
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:41,079
so we're going to take that off um

1530
00:40:41,079 --> 00:40:42,519
allow multiple opportunities

1531
00:40:42,519 --> 00:40:43,840
allows contact with multiple

1532
00:40:43,989 --> 00:40:45,530
opportunities under the workflow

1533
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:47,260
separate executions that's fine uh

1534
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:49,360
stopping responses i would do this

1535
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,230
just because a response is usually

1536
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:52,539
going to be a yes where we can

1537
00:40:52,539 --> 00:40:53,679
move them into a different

1538
00:40:53,829 --> 00:40:55,340
disposition or no uh sender

1539
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:57,320
details this is what you'd want to

1540
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:59,039
do send your number once again

1541
00:40:59,039 --> 00:40:59,199
this

1542
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:00,900
where you connect could connect it

1543
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:02,389
for sms once you guys have this

1544
00:41:02,389 --> 00:41:03,920
ready um it's quite simple you

1545
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:04,079
just

1546
00:41:04,219 --> 00:41:10,440
save it publish it save then you

1547
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:12,590
go back to workflows you can go

1548
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:14,630
into the opportunities tab

1549
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:16,900
and then whenever i move somebody

1550
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:18,079
from here to here

1551
00:41:20,289 --> 00:41:21,719
they're automatically enrolled in

1552
00:41:21,719 --> 00:41:23,090
that sequence so the first delay

1553
00:41:23,110 --> 00:41:24,400
is three days three days later

1554
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:24,550
this

1555
00:41:24,699 --> 00:41:26,050
person is going to get that email

1556
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:27,469
a couple days later next email a

1557
00:41:27,469 --> 00:41:28,880
couple days later you'll get

1558
00:41:29,019 --> 00:41:30,500
the reminder to send over an sms

1559
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:32,139
but simple stuff like that guys

1560
00:41:32,139 --> 00:41:33,920
goes a long way because at scale

1561
00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:35,460
it really just does become

1562
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:37,440
impossible to know who needs what

1563
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,840
when that's exactly what the crm

1564
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,389
is for

1565
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:41,550
and when it comes to automations

1566
00:41:41,559 --> 00:41:42,719
holding your train is going to be

1567
00:41:42,719 --> 00:41:44,320
the main place you want to focus

1568
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:46,190
then follow-ups and then lastly uh

1569
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:47,969
hot list i would just kind of take

1570
00:41:48,019 --> 00:41:49,360
full control of those leads

1571
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:50,659
just because they're really on the

1572
00:41:50,659 --> 00:41:51,949
one yard line and just brute force

1573
00:41:51,949 --> 00:41:52,880
these people through

1574
00:41:53,019 --> 00:41:54,159
hopefully this was helpful guys

1575
00:41:54,159 --> 00:41:55,690
hit me up with any questions wrap

1576
00:41:55,690 --> 00:41:56,639
it up there
