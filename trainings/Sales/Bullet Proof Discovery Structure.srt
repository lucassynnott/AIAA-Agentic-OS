1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,219
What's going on guys?

2
00:00:01,219 --> 00:00:02,200
Super excited to get into this

3
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:03,209
video because we're getting into

4
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:04,559
the fun stuff, the actual sales

5
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:05,629
call itself, and it all starts

6
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:06,320
with discovery.

7
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:07,990
And before I get into this, I want

8
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,380
to stress the importance of

9
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:11,060
discovery because a lot of people

10
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:12,490
will just undermine it and be

11
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:13,609
like, okay, if I have a good

12
00:00:13,609 --> 00:00:14,769
pitch, everything else is going to

13
00:00:14,769 --> 00:00:15,199
work out.

14
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:17,219
Very, very, very false.

15
00:00:17,219 --> 00:00:18,969
I can tell you personally, we have

16
00:00:18,969 --> 00:00:20,660
eight closers and the majority of

17
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:21,660
our time in terms of ongoing

18
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:23,960
training is spent on the discovery

19
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:24,850
and then holding people

20
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:25,929
accountable at the end of the

21
00:00:25,929 --> 00:00:27,539
call, closing, setting proper next

22
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:29,820
steps, follow up, as opposed to

23
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:30,579
the pitch.

24
00:00:30,579 --> 00:00:31,769
And when it comes to holding

25
00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:33,299
somebody accountable at the end of

26
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:34,759
the call to get the leverage that

27
00:00:34,759 --> 00:00:36,030
we need to close, we're getting

28
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:37,500
that stuff inside of discovery.

29
00:00:37,509 --> 00:00:39,049
So all that goes to say, pitch

30
00:00:39,049 --> 00:00:40,539
itself, a lot of that is just

31
00:00:40,539 --> 00:00:42,079
having a really good offer and

32
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:43,869
then putting time into creating a

33
00:00:43,869 --> 00:00:45,299
good pitch once and then it's

34
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:47,310
pretty easy to replicate that on

35
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:48,509
an ongoing basis.

36
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:49,929
The discovery is usually what

37
00:00:49,969 --> 00:00:51,270
people need to fine tune and

38
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:52,909
obviously having a structure like

39
00:00:52,909 --> 00:00:54,500
this that's worked for us for over

40
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,009
thousands of calls is going to be

41
00:00:56,009 --> 00:00:57,590
a huge, massive shortcut for you

42
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:58,140
guys.

43
00:00:58,490 --> 00:00:59,869
So just if you're not familiar

44
00:00:59,909 --> 00:01:01,320
with the process, the goal of

45
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,969
discovery, really the top half of

46
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:04,159
the call is to qualify the

47
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:05,819
prospect, understand their current

48
00:01:05,819 --> 00:01:07,019
situation, what they're looking to

49
00:01:07,019 --> 00:01:08,319
accomplish, create urgency and

50
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:08,900
gather ammo.

51
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:09,930
That's going to help you close

52
00:01:09,939 --> 00:01:10,260
them.

53
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:11,500
Going back to video one on the

54
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:12,780
service driven mindset.

55
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,870
If we can help them, it's our duty

56
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:15,939
to close them.

57
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:17,269
That's our moral obligation to

58
00:01:17,269 --> 00:01:17,900
close them.

59
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,390
Like I said earlier, having a good

60
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:20,420
pitch is not enough.

61
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:21,819
We need to have a bulletproof

62
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,560
discovery.

63
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:24,159
So let's talk about how to run a

64
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:25,319
successful discovery.

65
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:26,780
If you can, I almost always

66
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:28,480
recommend a one call close.

67
00:01:29,049 --> 00:01:31,439
Now, just to cover that topic real

68
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,430
quick, the reason why is because

69
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:34,920
if we have them sat on a sales

70
00:01:35,319 --> 00:01:37,090
call, I believe that most calls

71
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:39,269
can be closed in 30 minutes to an

72
00:01:39,269 --> 00:01:39,840
hour.

73
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:41,180
And if we want to keep the slots

74
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:42,409
at 30 minutes to make it

75
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:43,799
attractive, even then you can

76
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:45,540
usually ask somebody, hey, do you

77
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,280
have a hard out at 930 if the call

78
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,640
is booked at 9 or do you have a

79
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,150
hard stop at 10 o'clock if the

80
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:51,700
call is booked at 930?

81
00:01:51,829 --> 00:01:53,090
Usually when people say no, okay,

82
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:53,439
cool.

83
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:54,560
We've got 45 minutes.

84
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,909
We've got the whole hour.

85
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,819
And the reason why it's like,

86
00:01:56,819 --> 00:01:57,859
okay, they're already there.

87
00:01:57,890 --> 00:01:59,739
We're pitching to business owners.

88
00:01:59,739 --> 00:02:00,780
Their time is valuable.

89
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,640
Time kills deals.

90
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,489
So just in having an extra sales

91
00:02:04,489 --> 00:02:06,109
call, just in having more time

92
00:02:06,109 --> 00:02:07,670
from when their excitement is

93
00:02:07,689 --> 00:02:09,469
highest, which is typically when

94
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:11,129
they book in a call and when that

95
00:02:11,129 --> 00:02:12,819
first pitch is heard, we want to

96
00:02:12,819 --> 00:02:14,330
try to close them as quickly as

97
00:02:14,379 --> 00:02:15,360
possible.

98
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:16,319
That's when we want to be making

99
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:17,370
the ask for the sale, because once

100
00:02:17,389 --> 00:02:18,400
again, their excitement's the

101
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,319
highest at that point.

102
00:02:19,449 --> 00:02:20,830
If you have a second call, more

103
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:22,439
time elapses, which goes against

104
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:22,750
us.

105
00:02:22,849 --> 00:02:24,400
And also you're going to have the

106
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,889
call show rate for call one.

107
00:02:25,889 --> 00:02:27,460
You're going to have the call show

108
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:28,830
rate for call two, and there's

109
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:30,360
going to be a drop off 100%,

110
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:30,919
right?

111
00:02:30,949 --> 00:02:32,300
And there are some situations in

112
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,789
which you need a two call close.

113
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,889
So if you want to talk about that

114
00:02:34,889 --> 00:02:35,889
more than happy to jam on it,

115
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:37,069
because for some offers, it just

116
00:02:37,069 --> 00:02:37,960
makes plain sense.

117
00:02:37,969 --> 00:02:39,099
But the majority of the time, if

118
00:02:39,099 --> 00:02:40,400
you can do it, do one call close.

119
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,210
So this would be the first half of

120
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:43,419
the call, right?

121
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:44,870
It's generally like the first, I

122
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:46,270
would say, if we're booking out

123
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:47,979
and having a 30 minute sales call,

124
00:02:47,979 --> 00:02:49,530
this is going to take up about 15

125
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:49,909
minutes.

126
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,780
I also want you to realize that

127
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,550
this, what I'm showing you here is

128
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:54,819
simply a structure.

129
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:56,099
I'm going to bounce into an actual

130
00:02:56,099 --> 00:02:57,300
script throughout the video to

131
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,430
give you an idea as to what this

132
00:02:58,430 --> 00:02:59,080
looks like.

133
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:00,439
But I think it's important to

134
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:01,990
teach you guys what each section

135
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:03,800
serves because it is a structure.

136
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:05,360
It's not a script as if you're an

137
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,099
actor, because if you try to stick

138
00:03:07,099 --> 00:03:08,379
to that, you're always going to

139
00:03:08,419 --> 00:03:09,560
fail because people are going to

140
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,629
knock you off your game almost

141
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:11,479
every single call.

142
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:13,069
It's like if I was an actor and I

143
00:03:13,069 --> 00:03:14,449
had a script and the other person

144
00:03:14,449 --> 00:03:16,000
didn't, it's going to be like,

145
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,569
holy shit, this is not making any

146
00:03:17,569 --> 00:03:19,199
sense or just not going the way

147
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,599
that I intended it to.

148
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:21,039
Right.

149
00:03:21,069 --> 00:03:22,039
So it's going to take turns and

150
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:22,599
that's okay.

151
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:24,349
This is simply the guide you can

152
00:03:24,349 --> 00:03:26,030
refer back to up until you make

153
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:27,689
the pitch to make sure we're on

154
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,650
track and getting the information

155
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:30,400
we need.

156
00:03:30,969 --> 00:03:32,300
That's it.

157
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,099
Right.

158
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,520
This is a checklist of sorts.

159
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:35,770
Right.

160
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:36,849
To know, okay, are we having a

161
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:37,960
productive conversation?

162
00:03:38,449 --> 00:03:39,810
And two more things here real

163
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:40,280
quick.

164
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,069
One, we're going for quality of

165
00:03:42,069 --> 00:03:43,669
information, not volume of

166
00:03:43,669 --> 00:03:44,539
questions.

167
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:46,039
Super important concept.

168
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,370
Reason why is because for some

169
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:49,719
prospects, they kind of understand

170
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:51,990
what you're trying to do on this

171
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:52,689
call.

172
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:54,879
And they're going to be pretty

173
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,280
open with their situation.

174
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,759
So I may ask them one question.

175
00:03:57,759 --> 00:03:59,009
I may ask them what motivated them

176
00:03:59,009 --> 00:04:00,330
to book in a call and they may

177
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,199
rattle off the majority of stuff

178
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:04,389
that I need to understand their

179
00:04:04,389 --> 00:04:06,370
situation, qualify them, get the

180
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:07,889
ammo I need to close them.

181
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:09,629
They already have clear urgency.

182
00:04:09,629 --> 00:04:10,979
I don't need to go into each part

183
00:04:10,979 --> 00:04:12,039
of the script then.

184
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:13,490
In fact, if I do, it's going to

185
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:14,740
rub them the wrong way just

186
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,180
because it's going to sound so

187
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,040
redundant.

188
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,459
Right.

189
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:18,990
They just gave me information.

190
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:20,509
And then for the sake of following

191
00:04:20,509 --> 00:04:22,040
a quote unquote script, I'm going

192
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,339
to go into a part of the script

193
00:04:23,389 --> 00:04:24,500
where I ask a question for

194
00:04:24,579 --> 00:04:26,199
information I already gave us.

195
00:04:26,329 --> 00:04:27,639
So we're going for quality of

196
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:28,910
information, which means

197
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:30,519
essentially a prospect could give

198
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:32,000
us all the information we need in

199
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,470
one question for others that are

200
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:34,889
super close to the chest.

201
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:36,050
They don't want to tell us

202
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:36,699
anything.

203
00:04:36,699 --> 00:04:39,040
We may need to ask 15, 20, 30, 40

204
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,779
questions.

205
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:40,420
Right.

206
00:04:41,649 --> 00:04:43,509
On that same note, we'd rather go

207
00:04:43,509 --> 00:04:45,110
a mile deep than a mile wide in

208
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:47,120
discovery every single time.

209
00:04:47,129 --> 00:04:48,759
And what I mean by that is once

210
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:50,620
again, this is a checklist.

211
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:53,000
So if you check all of the boxes,

212
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:53,610
good.

213
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:54,850
That's a bulletproof way to have a

214
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:55,819
successful discovery.

215
00:04:55,819 --> 00:04:58,990
But if I check one quicker than

216
00:04:59,069 --> 00:05:02,259
the other, that's completely fine.

217
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:04,149
Because if I have a prospect that

218
00:05:04,149 --> 00:05:05,819
has a very clear issue that's

219
00:05:05,819 --> 00:05:07,819
going to keep them from closing, I

220
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,120
want to dig into that.

221
00:05:09,209 --> 00:05:10,810
And I'd rather go a mile deep on

222
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,639
that singular thing as opposed to

223
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:13,930
a mile wide to give you an

224
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:14,699
example.

225
00:05:14,709 --> 00:05:16,360
Let's say somebody you're selling

226
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:17,639
cold email as a service and

227
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:19,399
somebody had a horrible experience

228
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:21,019
with another agency that also had

229
00:05:21,019 --> 00:05:23,050
a performance based guarantee with

230
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:24,329
a cold email offer.

231
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:25,970
Like I need to go into what

232
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:28,019
actually happened there so I can

233
00:05:28,019 --> 00:05:30,220
help this guy understand why we're

234
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:32,449
different and why this experience

235
00:05:32,449 --> 00:05:34,019
would be different.

236
00:05:34,069 --> 00:05:35,269
Because if I don't address that

237
00:05:35,269 --> 00:05:36,480
and he's just kind of sitting on

238
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,699
the call, just super jaded the

239
00:05:37,699 --> 00:05:39,230
whole time, like, well, last pitch

240
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:39,930
sound good.

241
00:05:39,949 --> 00:05:41,230
Last agency I thought would work

242
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:42,420
and they screwed me over.

243
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:44,089
If we don't go deep on that

244
00:05:44,089 --> 00:05:46,220
specific thing and dig into that

245
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:48,670
specific thing, none of the rest

246
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:49,939
just matters.

247
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:51,170
Same thing with a guy who's super

248
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:52,589
lackadaisical about his timeline,

249
00:05:52,589 --> 00:05:53,959
who doesn't have any urgency.

250
00:05:54,569 --> 00:05:56,170
It's very important that we go

251
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:57,720
into actually creating that

252
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,370
urgency, figuring out why his

253
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:01,000
timeline is like that, figuring

254
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,209
out if his own timeline is even

255
00:06:02,209 --> 00:06:03,240
aligned with his goals.

256
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:04,639
Because most of the time it's not

257
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:05,959
reminding him of our timeline

258
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:07,459
versus his timeline, right?

259
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:08,959
He seems super lackadaisical on

260
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:10,310
the call, yet he wants to get

261
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:11,730
calls booked in the next three

262
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:12,269
weeks.

263
00:06:12,569 --> 00:06:13,850
Which if you're running a cold

264
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:15,240
email offer, you kind of know if

265
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,589
somebody wants to book calls in

266
00:06:16,589 --> 00:06:17,829
three weeks, they need to be

267
00:06:17,829 --> 00:06:19,399
signed up yesterday, right?

268
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:20,769
And the second best time next to

269
00:06:20,769 --> 00:06:22,259
yesterday would be today because

270
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:23,879
you have your onboarding process,

271
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:25,540
you have your warm-up process.

272
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:27,160
He's just not of the mindset,

273
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:27,709
right?

274
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:29,100
That's actually going to be

275
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,730
productive for his own goals.

276
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,019
Once again, we're trying to help

277
00:06:32,019 --> 00:06:32,680
this person.

278
00:06:32,689 --> 00:06:34,160
So I would need to go deep into

279
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,720
that timeline issue with this

280
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,079
person as opposed to being

281
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:38,810
hyper-obsessed with like making

282
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:40,470
sure I check every single box and

283
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:42,310
not going deep on that one thing.

284
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:44,560
So hopefully that all makes sense,

285
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,980
but let's get into it.

286
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:47,189
It all is going to start with

287
00:06:47,189 --> 00:06:47,779
rapport.

288
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:49,250
It's not going to be something

289
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:50,899
that's super make or break for the

290
00:06:50,899 --> 00:06:52,819
call, but just be a normal person.

291
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:53,779
You're going to be having a long

292
00:06:53,779 --> 00:06:54,879
conversation with the person, so

293
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:55,800
we don't want them to feel like

294
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,720
it's going to be an awkward one

295
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,589
and shutting down before it

296
00:06:57,589 --> 00:06:58,199
starts.

297
00:06:58,209 --> 00:06:59,459
Nor should you be trying to be

298
00:06:59,459 --> 00:07:00,480
their best friend.

299
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:02,240
Be respectful of them, their time,

300
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,290
jump into things.

301
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:04,800
Like I said, if you try to really

302
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,310
suck up and be somebody's friend

303
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,930
like too hard right off the bat,

304
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:09,560
it's going to come off as almost

305
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,100
ingenuine like, oh, here goes the

306
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:11,560
sales guy.

307
00:07:11,569 --> 00:07:12,860
And then also it's going to come

308
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:14,310
off as a little subservient with,

309
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,649
you know, like I said on the last

310
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:17,060
video talking about status games

311
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:17,579
there.

312
00:07:17,589 --> 00:07:18,870
People don't necessarily want to

313
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:20,149
work with people that are beneath

314
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:20,560
them.

315
00:07:20,569 --> 00:07:21,819
They want to work with people that

316
00:07:21,819 --> 00:07:23,100
are of equal or higher status.

317
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,699
So don't overthink it.

318
00:07:24,709 --> 00:07:25,560
Don't be weird.

319
00:07:25,569 --> 00:07:26,819
Keep it brief.

320
00:07:26,829 --> 00:07:27,920
Jump into the call.

321
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:29,360
Now, it all starts with the

322
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:29,959
agenda.

323
00:07:30,949 --> 00:07:33,459
Like it or not, we're leading

324
00:07:33,459 --> 00:07:35,839
these prospects on the sales call.

325
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:37,420
So if we don't set the expectation

326
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:38,540
that this is going to be a

327
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:40,120
productive sales call, it's not

328
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:40,930
going to be.

329
00:07:40,949 --> 00:07:42,310
If we're sleepwalking through the

330
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:43,490
sales call, they're going to

331
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:45,110
sleepwalk through the sales call.

332
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:46,750
If I don't want to be there,

333
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:47,889
they're not going to want to be

334
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:48,319
there.

335
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:48,819
Right.

336
00:07:48,889 --> 00:07:50,949
So super important that we always,

337
00:07:50,949 --> 00:07:52,939
always, always set an agenda.

338
00:07:52,949 --> 00:07:54,420
Have one completely written out.

339
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:55,980
Like this is a part of the call

340
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:57,730
that can be scripted and should be

341
00:07:57,829 --> 00:07:59,680
clean just because mentally it's

342
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,189
just going to get you off to a

343
00:08:01,259 --> 00:08:02,420
nice little win.

344
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:03,139
All right, cool.

345
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:03,839
We checked that box.

346
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:04,680
We're off to a good start.

347
00:08:04,769 --> 00:08:06,209
And trust me, you'd want to get

348
00:08:06,209 --> 00:08:07,360
off to a good start versus

349
00:08:07,379 --> 00:08:08,899
stumbling out of the gates every

350
00:08:08,899 --> 00:08:09,759
single time.

351
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:11,139
But essentially what we're trying

352
00:08:11,139 --> 00:08:12,199
to get off is there should be a

353
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:13,459
casual conversation about their

354
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:14,870
current efforts, what's working,

355
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:16,170
what's not, what they're looking

356
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:17,000
to accomplish.

357
00:08:17,009 --> 00:08:18,139
And if it seems like, you know,

358
00:08:18,139 --> 00:08:19,290
you can help, then you walk them

359
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,490
through what that would look like

360
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:21,560
to work with you or not.

361
00:08:21,569 --> 00:08:22,040
No worries.

362
00:08:22,089 --> 00:08:23,430
And you two are on the same team,

363
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:23,879
right?

364
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:26,209
Like I don't like the sales closer

365
00:08:26,209 --> 00:08:28,430
mindset of like having to be like

366
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:31,019
icy cold and calling them a pussy.

367
00:08:31,029 --> 00:08:32,408
And like, I mean, sometimes

368
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:33,980
there's, there's room for that

369
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,570
maybe at the very, very end of the

370
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:36,110
call.

371
00:08:36,129 --> 00:08:37,200
But before that, like we want to

372
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,200
build up goodwill and we don't

373
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,120
want it to be a super awkward

374
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,330
conversation because that's going

375
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:41,538
to be draining for both of us.

376
00:08:41,548 --> 00:08:42,710
We want it to feel like, yo, my

377
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:44,009
arms around you, we're going to be

378
00:08:44,009 --> 00:08:45,320
talking about what you're looking

379
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,649
to accomplish, what you're trying

380
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:47,929
right now, what's working right

381
00:08:47,929 --> 00:08:48,080
now.

382
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:50,370
If, if it seems like we know,

383
00:08:50,389 --> 00:08:51,039
cool.

384
00:08:51,049 --> 00:08:51,850
I'll walk you through how we can

385
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:52,700
get started on that today.

386
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:55,480
And if not, no worries, right?

387
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:56,649
Just give you an example of what

388
00:08:56,649 --> 00:08:57,789
this would actually look like

389
00:08:57,789 --> 00:08:58,179
here.

390
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:00,139
Just sort of thought, can't even

391
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:00,669
read.

392
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:01,740
Just start us off here.

393
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:02,720
These call the super casual.

394
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:03,809
I'll get some context on what you

395
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:04,950
guys do and specifically how your

396
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:06,029
business development lead gen is

397
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:07,059
currently operating.

398
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:08,159
If it seems like there's an

399
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:09,360
opportunity for us to make an

400
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,590
impact, I'll walk you through what

401
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:11,590
that would look like and see if it

402
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:12,590
makes sense for us to get this set

403
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:13,059
up today.

404
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:14,220
Today, right?

405
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:15,090
I mean, once again, like we're

406
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:15,820
leading these guys.

407
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:17,210
If we don't set the expectation

408
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,490
that this is going to be a one

409
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:19,899
call close, if all works out,

410
00:09:19,899 --> 00:09:21,360
we're not likely to get a one call

411
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:21,980
close.

412
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:22,500
Fair enough.

413
00:09:22,509 --> 00:09:22,840
Cool.

414
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:23,639
Jump into it.

415
00:09:23,649 --> 00:09:24,279
We're on the next part.

416
00:09:24,289 --> 00:09:26,370
Now, before diving into this call,

417
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:28,080
like really diving into it, we

418
00:09:28,149 --> 00:09:29,519
just set the agenda.

419
00:09:29,529 --> 00:09:30,700
I typically just ask them what

420
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:31,919
motivated them to book a call in

421
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:32,779
the first place.

422
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:36,820
Simple, but so, so, so effective.

423
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:38,129
I can't tell you how many times

424
00:09:38,129 --> 00:09:39,610
I've seen somebody set the agenda

425
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:40,909
and then just go straight into

426
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:42,090
business background.

427
00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:43,100
Hey, cool.

428
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:44,179
Tell me about the business.

429
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:45,059
Tell me what you guys do.

430
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:46,080
Tell me who you do it for.

431
00:09:47,049 --> 00:09:48,879
Where you can get into a situation

432
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:50,779
with a talkative prospect where if

433
00:09:50,779 --> 00:09:52,419
you do that first, five, ten

434
00:09:52,419 --> 00:09:54,080
minutes go by, you have no idea

435
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:55,759
why they even signed up for the

436
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:56,379
call.

437
00:09:56,389 --> 00:09:57,269
You have no idea what they're

438
00:09:57,269 --> 00:09:58,039
looking to get out of this

439
00:09:58,039 --> 00:09:58,500
meeting.

440
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:01,220
So, literally, just start off by

441
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:02,940
asking, and this is a great place

442
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,570
to ask a question because a lot of

443
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,299
times those prospects who kind of

444
00:10:06,299 --> 00:10:07,820
been around the block and know

445
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,090
what to do, they'll tell you

446
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,429
exactly what they're looking for.

447
00:10:11,669 --> 00:10:12,889
So, ask them, what problem are

448
00:10:12,889 --> 00:10:13,820
they looking to fix?

449
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:14,919
Oftentimes, after that first

450
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:15,929
question, I'll get half the

451
00:10:15,929 --> 00:10:17,139
information I need to know, like I

452
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:18,309
said here, if I'm going to be able

453
00:10:18,309 --> 00:10:19,399
to help them and what that would

454
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:20,059
look like.

455
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:21,700
Also, get some talking, right?

456
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:22,649
And this is the first step in

457
00:10:22,649 --> 00:10:23,639
making them feel heard.

458
00:10:23,649 --> 00:10:26,049
One thing that's super important

459
00:10:26,049 --> 00:10:28,450
to realize is that it's not enough

460
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:30,669
if we understand that there's a

461
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:31,679
problem.

462
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:33,179
They also have to understand their

463
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:33,759
problem.

464
00:10:33,769 --> 00:10:36,029
So, discovery is about everything

465
00:10:36,029 --> 00:10:38,049
I talked about up here, but it's

466
00:10:38,049 --> 00:10:40,370
also about making them feel heard.

467
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,570
So, when we do make a pitch, it

468
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:44,389
doesn't feel like unsolicited

469
00:10:44,409 --> 00:10:46,519
advice because people like getting

470
00:10:46,529 --> 00:10:48,789
help from an expert, but nobody

471
00:10:48,789 --> 00:10:51,220
likes getting unsolicited help

472
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,500
from anybody.

473
00:10:52,509 --> 00:10:53,879
Whether it's a friend, like you're

474
00:10:53,879 --> 00:10:55,000
kind of trying to vent to them

475
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,299
about your problems, and then all

476
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:57,600
of a sudden, it's like, yeah,

477
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,480
dude, I get it.

478
00:10:58,490 --> 00:10:59,279
This is what you need to do.

479
00:10:59,289 --> 00:11:00,149
It's like, dude, you need to hear

480
00:11:00,149 --> 00:11:00,419
me out.

481
00:11:00,429 --> 00:11:01,779
Or even an expert, like you go to

482
00:11:01,779 --> 00:11:03,049
a doctor, you walk in there,

483
00:11:03,049 --> 00:11:04,470
you've only explained one of your

484
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:05,879
symptoms, like you've got a sore

485
00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:07,039
throat, but you also have a

486
00:11:07,259 --> 00:11:08,470
massive headache that feels like

487
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:09,950
you're about to fucking pass out

488
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:10,559
because of it.

489
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:11,330
And he's like, yeah, bro, you got

490
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:11,580
strep.

491
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:12,159
Take these pills.

492
00:11:12,169 --> 00:11:12,870
You're gonna make, what the fuck?

493
00:11:12,909 --> 00:11:14,059
I didn't even get into things,

494
00:11:14,059 --> 00:11:14,440
right?

495
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:15,889
So, super important that they're

496
00:11:15,889 --> 00:11:17,340
gonna be felt, that they're gonna

497
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,529
feel like they've been heard

498
00:11:18,549 --> 00:11:19,220
throughout.

499
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:20,240
So, that's why we get in the

500
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,779
background questions next, right?

501
00:11:21,789 --> 00:11:23,000
Kind of like I said, people hate

502
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,240
getting advice from people they

503
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,340
feel like lack context.

504
00:11:25,509 --> 00:11:26,769
So, it's important that we

505
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:28,330
understand their business, and

506
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:29,820
even more important that we make

507
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,379
them feel like we understand their

508
00:11:31,429 --> 00:11:32,549
business, right?

509
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:33,789
Because that's one of the things,

510
00:11:33,789 --> 00:11:35,009
it's like, I've been trying to fix

511
00:11:35,009 --> 00:11:36,100
this fucking issue of not being

512
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:37,210
able to create content, of not

513
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:38,049
being able to get my lead

514
00:11:38,049 --> 00:11:38,860
generation up.

515
00:11:39,669 --> 00:11:40,690
So, when we come in and we just

516
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,879
say like, yeah, we can help with

517
00:11:41,879 --> 00:11:43,200
that, it feels disingenuous.

518
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:44,769
But if we actually understand the

519
00:11:44,769 --> 00:11:46,360
ins and outs of what they've done,

520
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,779
what they've tried, then that

521
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,240
pitch is gonna be welcome.

522
00:11:49,269 --> 00:11:50,330
So, how are they framing their

523
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:51,259
offer to cold traffic?

524
00:11:51,269 --> 00:11:52,639
How many clients do they have?

525
00:11:52,649 --> 00:11:53,519
How does their pricing work?

526
00:11:53,529 --> 00:11:54,490
What's their monthly revenue look

527
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:54,750
like?

528
00:11:54,769 --> 00:11:55,639
Who's your ideal client?

529
00:11:55,769 --> 00:11:56,960
There's a number of different

530
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,299
things here that are either going

531
00:11:58,299 --> 00:11:59,919
to, one, qualify them to you, and

532
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:01,419
then two, at the very least,

533
00:12:01,419 --> 00:12:02,980
gather information for us to be

534
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,480
able to close them at the end of

535
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,100
the call.

536
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:06,490
For example, let's say we charge

537
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:07,759
$3,000 a month.

538
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:09,289
I'm asking about their clients,

539
00:12:09,289 --> 00:12:10,610
what's their average client

540
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:12,250
lifetime value, and their average

541
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:14,679
client lifetime value is $10,000.

542
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:16,059
I get that information.

543
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:17,620
It's pretty easy for me to make a

544
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,289
logical sales argument at the end

545
00:12:19,289 --> 00:12:20,799
of the call that they should do

546
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:22,480
this because there's clear ROI if

547
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,100
they can sign even one client per

548
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,129
month, right?

549
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:25,899
So, that's where we're gonna be

550
00:12:25,899 --> 00:12:26,700
gathering this information.

551
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:28,340
Current efforts, what are they

552
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:30,009
currently doing to accomplish X,

553
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:30,600
Y, Z?

554
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:32,750
Even if it's nothing, super

555
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:35,299
important to get that, right?

556
00:12:35,309 --> 00:12:36,399
Because let's say, once again, I'm

557
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:37,309
selling lead generation.

558
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:38,820
Hey, what are you guys currently

559
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,909
doing to get new leads on

560
00:12:39,909 --> 00:12:40,580
calendar?

561
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:42,759
Well, we're not doing anything at

562
00:12:42,789 --> 00:12:43,730
the moment.

563
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:46,600
You guys aren't doing any type of

564
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:49,460
outbound or paid marketing?

565
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:51,539
No, not right now.

566
00:12:51,549 --> 00:12:53,289
Oh, okay.

567
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:55,659
Just the tonality of what I said

568
00:12:55,659 --> 00:12:56,759
that this person would be like,

569
00:12:56,759 --> 00:12:57,320
oh, shit.

570
00:12:57,330 --> 00:12:59,139
I've got an issue, right?

571
00:12:59,149 --> 00:13:00,940
This is not normal, right?

572
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:02,009
Because once again, it's not

573
00:13:02,009 --> 00:13:03,379
enough that we're problem aware.

574
00:13:03,389 --> 00:13:04,409
They also need to be problem

575
00:13:04,419 --> 00:13:04,840
aware.

576
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:06,059
So, what have they tried in the

577
00:13:06,059 --> 00:13:06,440
past?

578
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:07,799
What are they looking into now?

579
00:13:07,809 --> 00:13:09,289
Once again, like that example I

580
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:10,559
used earlier of if they were

581
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:12,230
burned by an agency before, super

582
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:13,429
important that we understand the

583
00:13:13,429 --> 00:13:14,629
ins and outs of what actually went

584
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:15,000
down.

585
00:13:15,009 --> 00:13:16,039
And what are they looking into

586
00:13:16,049 --> 00:13:16,340
now?

587
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:17,350
I want to be able to understand

588
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:18,399
what I'm selling against.

589
00:13:18,409 --> 00:13:19,379
It's all important stuff.

590
00:13:20,029 --> 00:13:20,950
Then we want to go into

591
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:22,399
quantifying current efforts,

592
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:22,919
right?

593
00:13:22,929 --> 00:13:24,179
If we can't get real clarity on

594
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:25,639
where they're at, it's very tough

595
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:26,799
to know if and how much we can

596
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:27,840
help this person.

597
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:29,649
So, like we talked about, these

598
00:13:29,649 --> 00:13:30,850
people are generally trying to go

599
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:31,419
from A to B.

600
00:13:31,429 --> 00:13:32,259
They're looking to make some sort

601
00:13:32,259 --> 00:13:32,860
of transformation.

602
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:34,899
We need to understand what point A

603
00:13:34,899 --> 00:13:36,940
is and exactly what point A is.

604
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:39,970
And the reason I said this, be

605
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:42,000
wary of ranges because even though

606
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
people, these people are looking

607
00:13:44,039 --> 00:13:45,750
for help, they often don't want

608
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,230
things to seem as bad as they are

609
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:48,779
because they think it makes them

610
00:13:48,789 --> 00:13:50,120
seem less competent.

611
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:51,679
I talked a lot about this in the

612
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:53,120
last video too, right?

613
00:13:53,129 --> 00:13:54,320
So, when it comes to how many

614
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,820
calls you're getting on calendar,

615
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:57,659
we can't accept 10 to 15 calls.

616
00:13:59,149 --> 00:14:01,950
That's not a real number, right?

617
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:03,429
Because then when I follow up,

618
00:14:03,429 --> 00:14:05,009
like I should and ask, hey, like

619
00:14:05,009 --> 00:14:06,429
how many calls exactly did you

620
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:08,220
guys get in the last 30 days?

621
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:10,080
It's so funny, but oftentimes when

622
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,529
they go and check, oh, we had

623
00:14:11,629 --> 00:14:13,490
eight, which isn't even in 10 to

624
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:14,259
15.

625
00:14:14,269 --> 00:14:15,919
And it gives me like a real clear

626
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:16,559
point A.

627
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:18,039
And they'll come up with excuses.

628
00:14:18,049 --> 00:14:19,220
Oh, you know, it was a busy month

629
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,350
and I was traveling for a little

630
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:21,340
bit and this and that.

631
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:22,279
It's typically 10 to 15.

632
00:14:22,289 --> 00:14:23,440
But yeah, last month it was eight.

633
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:24,299
Cool.

634
00:14:24,309 --> 00:14:25,409
I have some of the anchor on,

635
00:14:25,409 --> 00:14:25,840
right?

636
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:27,840
And I mean, the lower the bar is

637
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,250
for point A, the easier it is to

638
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:30,669
show them how much we could help

639
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:31,159
them.

640
00:14:31,169 --> 00:14:32,659
And also them actually realizing,

641
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:34,009
oh shit, it was only eight.

642
00:14:34,029 --> 00:14:35,909
That's going to be big once again

643
00:14:35,909 --> 00:14:37,820
in terms of them realizing things

644
00:14:37,889 --> 00:14:39,789
might be worse than I thought they

645
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,399
were.

646
00:14:40,409 --> 00:14:41,529
And once again, just makes them

647
00:14:41,529 --> 00:14:42,360
more problem aware.

648
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:43,519
So, now we got point A.

649
00:14:43,529 --> 00:14:45,080
Let's find point B.

650
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:46,220
Find out exactly what they're

651
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,259
looking to accomplish.

652
00:14:47,289 --> 00:14:49,370
If they don't have a solid answer,

653
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:50,240
lead them.

654
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:51,840
Once again, we're leading them on

655
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,330
this call, whether we like it or

656
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:53,720
not.

657
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:54,799
So, we might as well do a good job

658
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:55,110
of it.

659
00:14:55,669 --> 00:14:56,570
Because, like I said, at this

660
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:57,559
point in the call, we understand

661
00:14:57,559 --> 00:14:58,440
what point A looks like.

662
00:14:58,450 --> 00:14:59,700
Now, we want to define what point

663
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:00,909
B looks like, even if they do not

664
00:15:00,909 --> 00:15:01,289
know.

665
00:15:01,309 --> 00:15:02,610
Because that will allow us to

666
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,159
pitch our service as a straightest

667
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:05,620
line from point A to point B.

668
00:15:05,629 --> 00:15:07,370
And then it just becomes a game of

669
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:09,190
if they also believe that they can

670
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:10,429
get to their goals.

671
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:12,200
That this thing that you pitch as

672
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,980
the straight line from point A to

673
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,620
point B can actually act as you

674
00:15:16,629 --> 00:15:18,019
pitched it.

675
00:15:18,029 --> 00:15:18,490
Right?

676
00:15:18,649 --> 00:15:19,899
And if it's yes, then it makes a

677
00:15:19,899 --> 00:15:21,169
whole lot of sense to sign up for

678
00:15:21,169 --> 00:15:21,940
your service.

679
00:15:22,509 --> 00:15:23,580
Right?

680
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,419
So, pretty straightforward.

681
00:15:25,429 --> 00:15:26,820
But I can't tell you the amount of

682
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:28,429
times where people are like, hey,

683
00:15:28,429 --> 00:15:29,919
you know, so looking forward six

684
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:31,970
months, finishing up 2025 here.

685
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:34,779
Yeah, what are your goals?

686
00:15:34,789 --> 00:15:35,500
Where do you want to be at?

687
00:15:35,529 --> 00:15:36,870
And some of you are like, yeah,

688
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:38,440
well, you know, we want to grow.

689
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:39,539
We want to make more revenue.

690
00:15:41,389 --> 00:15:42,559
You can't define that.

691
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:42,940
Right?

692
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:43,929
Like, we understand where they're

693
00:15:43,929 --> 00:15:44,440
at right now.

694
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:45,320
Hey, okay, cool.

695
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:46,769
But you guys right now are at

696
00:15:46,769 --> 00:15:48,019
eight calls a month.

697
00:15:48,029 --> 00:15:49,570
Tell me, like, do you have a

698
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:51,330
specific goal in terms of a number

699
00:15:51,429 --> 00:15:53,080
of calls you guys are looking to

700
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:53,580
get?

701
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:54,940
Like, a revenue number?

702
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:56,070
As a company, just trying to

703
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:57,490
figure out, like, what exactly is

704
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:58,740
the measurement of success that

705
00:15:58,809 --> 00:16:00,210
would make you look back and say,

706
00:16:00,289 --> 00:16:01,639
yeah, I mean, this was worth doing

707
00:16:01,779 --> 00:16:02,659
six months from now.

708
00:16:02,669 --> 00:16:04,139
And it's okay if they stop there

709
00:16:04,139 --> 00:16:05,389
and think a little bit.

710
00:16:05,409 --> 00:16:06,720
That's exactly what we want.

711
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:07,419
Right?

712
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:09,000
Because then, once again, we

713
00:16:09,029 --> 00:16:10,389
define point B, we know how to

714
00:16:10,389 --> 00:16:11,399
pitch our service.

715
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:12,679
It's a straight line from point A

716
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:13,230
to point B.

717
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:14,740
So, up to this point, we

718
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,820
understand why they're here.

719
00:16:17,289 --> 00:16:18,779
Background questions are all good.

720
00:16:18,789 --> 00:16:19,879
We have context in their business.

721
00:16:19,889 --> 00:16:20,889
We understand what their current

722
00:16:20,889 --> 00:16:21,379
efforts are.

723
00:16:21,409 --> 00:16:22,460
We've quantified what those

724
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:23,889
current efforts are resulting in.

725
00:16:23,909 --> 00:16:25,000
We understand what their goals

726
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:25,289
are.

727
00:16:25,309 --> 00:16:27,460
Now, this is where we dive into a

728
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:29,080
little bit more pain.

729
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:29,799
Okay.

730
00:16:29,809 --> 00:16:31,330
And how long, you know, at this

731
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:32,929
point, they haven't been able to

732
00:16:32,929 --> 00:16:34,370
hit their goals because of the

733
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:35,960
reasons they've shared.

734
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:37,279
How long has that been going on?

735
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:39,419
Six months?

736
00:16:39,429 --> 00:16:39,980
Oh, okay.

737
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:41,350
And if they don't seem like

738
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:43,139
they're having any type of urgency

739
00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:44,980
at that point, I would ask them,

740
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:47,340
okay, so I guess, you know, why

741
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:47,899
not?

742
00:16:47,909 --> 00:16:50,980
It's been going on for six months.

743
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:52,730
I guess what's kind of made you

744
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:54,549
get to the point here where it's

745
00:16:54,549 --> 00:16:56,250
like, yeah, I've kind of had

746
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:57,059
enough.

747
00:16:57,929 --> 00:16:59,139
Once again, this is the part where

748
00:16:59,139 --> 00:16:59,879
we're diving in.

749
00:16:59,889 --> 00:17:00,809
We're twisting the knife a little

750
00:17:00,809 --> 00:17:01,039
bit.

751
00:17:01,049 --> 00:17:02,029
We're creating a little bit more

752
00:17:02,029 --> 00:17:02,429
urgency.

753
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:03,389
We want them to kind of feel it in

754
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:03,919
their belly.

755
00:17:03,929 --> 00:17:05,779
How likely, right?

756
00:17:05,789 --> 00:17:07,318
So, after we just dove into some

757
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:08,680
pain, we want to be real with

758
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,578
them, right?

759
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:11,650
We want to figure out how likely

760
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:12,838
they are to hit the previously

761
00:17:12,838 --> 00:17:14,299
mentioned goal without addressing

762
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:15,960
the previously mentioned issues.

763
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:17,859
Then we want to get their

764
00:17:17,859 --> 00:17:19,289
commitment that they're willing to

765
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:20,390
address this issue and that

766
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:21,460
they're ready to do it now,

767
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:22,759
whether that means working with

768
00:17:22,759 --> 00:17:23,359
you or not.

769
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:25,869
We're establishing the opportunity

770
00:17:25,869 --> 00:17:26,460
costs here.

771
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:28,980
What I mean by that, guys, is our

772
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:31,230
biggest competitor is almost

773
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:32,779
always in action.

774
00:17:32,789 --> 00:17:34,220
It's not the other agency.

775
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:35,869
It's not the larger company that

776
00:17:35,869 --> 00:17:37,079
we may sell against.

777
00:17:37,109 --> 00:17:39,319
It's just them doing nothing,

778
00:17:39,319 --> 00:17:41,799
which is, once again, why we want

779
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:44,599
to ask them, hey, like, why not?

780
00:17:44,609 --> 00:17:46,099
I guess it's been going on for six

781
00:17:46,099 --> 00:17:46,640
months.

782
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:47,619
Why not continue as is?

783
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,559
Because that's the most likely

784
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:51,500
outcome if they don't sign with

785
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:51,920
us.

786
00:17:52,869 --> 00:17:54,460
They just continue carrying on as

787
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:54,759
is.

788
00:17:54,769 --> 00:17:56,099
So, if we establish the

789
00:17:56,099 --> 00:17:57,940
opportunity costs and make them

790
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:59,769
realize that if they continue on

791
00:17:59,769 --> 00:18:01,349
as is, that has a real price tag

792
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,299
associated to it.

793
00:18:02,309 --> 00:18:04,259
And them not signing with you is

794
00:18:04,259 --> 00:18:06,319
not simply them just telling the

795
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:08,589
sales guy that they met today, no,

796
00:18:08,589 --> 00:18:10,450
it's them not being able to hit

797
00:18:10,509 --> 00:18:12,480
their goals because of it.

798
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:14,650
That's where we can create real

799
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:15,539
urgency.

800
00:18:15,549 --> 00:18:16,930
That's where we can create real

801
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,319
leverage that we can use at the

802
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:19,680
end of the call to close them,

803
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,200
right?

804
00:18:20,269 --> 00:18:21,529
The cost of them not doing

805
00:18:21,529 --> 00:18:23,190
something is them continuing to

806
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:24,839
experience these struggles for

807
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,500
even longer and not being able to

808
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,049
accomplish their goals.

809
00:18:28,069 --> 00:18:29,619
We can establish those two things.

810
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:31,359
And I'm telling you, going back to

811
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:32,680
the fact that we have eight

812
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,299
closures, this is the one thing

813
00:18:34,299 --> 00:18:35,859
they struggle with most when it

814
00:18:35,859 --> 00:18:37,039
comes to discovery.

815
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,589
Whereas when they do this, the

816
00:18:38,589 --> 00:18:39,619
urgency is created.

817
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:41,069
It's a whole lot easier to ask for

818
00:18:41,069 --> 00:18:42,430
the sale and actually get that

819
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:43,700
sale on that first call.

820
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:44,579
After that, pretty

821
00:18:44,579 --> 00:18:46,079
straightforward, we're going to

822
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:47,630
recap their situation, ask if your

823
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:49,069
understanding is fair, and then

824
00:18:49,069 --> 00:18:49,869
just double check to make sure

825
00:18:49,869 --> 00:18:50,730
that you didn't miss anything that

826
00:18:50,819 --> 00:18:51,640
you should have covered.

827
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:52,859
Once again, this is super

828
00:18:52,859 --> 00:18:54,420
important for us to make sure that

829
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:55,400
they feel heard.

830
00:18:55,769 --> 00:18:56,470
And then after that, we're on to

831
00:18:56,509 --> 00:18:56,839
the pitch.

832
00:18:56,849 --> 00:18:57,980
So to show you guys just

833
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:59,650
continuation of that, because I

834
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:01,420
showed you guys the agenda itself,

835
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:02,599
motivation, problem

836
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:03,720
identification.

837
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:04,720
So why are they here?

838
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:06,059
First off, I'm curious.

839
00:19:06,069 --> 00:19:07,069
What motivated you booking this

840
00:19:07,069 --> 00:19:07,559
call today?

841
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:09,940
Business background, right?

842
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:11,000
Once again, gathering the

843
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,200
information of the business to

844
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,579
qualify them, gather ammo to close

845
00:19:13,579 --> 00:19:14,240
them later.

846
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:15,079
I mentioned this.

847
00:19:15,089 --> 00:19:16,440
What's your average CLTV question?

848
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:17,460
Current efforts.

849
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:18,759
What's that resulting in?

850
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:20,220
Clarifying their goals.

851
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:21,180
I even call it goals

852
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:23,170
clarification, because once again,

853
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:24,730
it's so common that people give

854
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:26,460
you a BS general range answer.

855
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:28,630
It's on the sales guy to lead them

856
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:30,779
to have specificity there.

857
00:19:30,789 --> 00:19:32,109
And ideally, you get a verbal

858
00:19:32,109 --> 00:19:33,609
commitment that we're on the same

859
00:19:33,609 --> 00:19:34,839
page in terms of goals.

860
00:19:34,849 --> 00:19:35,059
Great.

861
00:19:35,069 --> 00:19:36,460
So you guys want to be at $100K a

862
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:37,730
month by the end of the year, and

863
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:39,230
you're thinking you need about 20

864
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:40,500
calls a month to get there.

865
00:19:40,509 --> 00:19:41,730
Once again, that's specific.

866
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:42,970
That's a real clear point B.

867
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:44,779
Pain duration and impact, which is

868
00:19:44,779 --> 00:19:46,289
basically how long, right?

869
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:47,319
How long have you guys been

870
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:48,339
struggling to find the way to

871
00:19:48,339 --> 00:19:49,140
generate X calls?

872
00:19:50,099 --> 00:19:50,400
Or how long have you guys been

873
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:51,549
struggling to find a way to

874
00:19:51,549 --> 00:19:52,960
actually increase your digital

875
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:53,700
footprint?

876
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:55,759
Have a real personal brand.

877
00:19:55,769 --> 00:19:57,640
How does that impact the business?

878
00:19:58,210 --> 00:19:59,119
Right?

879
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:00,940
Then opportunity cost.

880
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:02,130
How likely do you think you are to

881
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:03,289
hit that goal without changing

882
00:20:03,289 --> 00:20:04,680
your current outbound process?

883
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:07,160
I mean, I don't know.

884
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:08,160
I think we probably need to do

885
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:08,700
something.

886
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:10,279
Yeah, it sounds like it.

887
00:20:10,289 --> 00:20:11,220
And you booked this call today, so

888
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,200
it sounds like a priority then.

889
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:14,250
So I guess my question there, so

890
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:16,250
whether you're looking to work

891
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:18,069
with us or not, working with

892
00:20:18,089 --> 00:20:19,240
somebody else,

893
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:20,519
to ramp up your lead generation,

894
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:22,150
it sounds like this is a problem

895
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:23,920
you're looking to address and fix

896
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:24,210
now.

897
00:20:25,769 --> 00:20:26,460
Yeah, it is.

898
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:27,339
Okay, cool.

899
00:20:27,349 --> 00:20:28,380
Now I've kind of ruled out our

900
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:29,640
biggest competitor, which is an

901
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,220
action, and I could just sell

902
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:33,059
against them doing it themselves

903
00:20:33,079 --> 00:20:35,430
or, you know, an alternative

904
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:36,180
situation.

905
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:37,569
But once again, I like my chances

906
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:38,519
rolling into that.

907
00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:39,519
If they don't seem like they have

908
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:40,640
any urgency, hey, totally fair if

909
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,609
this isn't a top priority right

910
00:20:41,609 --> 00:20:41,980
now.

911
00:20:42,029 --> 00:20:43,019
But I guess I'm curious, what

912
00:20:43,019 --> 00:20:43,980
sparked you exploring other

913
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:44,940
options in the first place if

914
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:46,059
things were generally working as

915
00:20:46,059 --> 00:20:46,299
is?

916
00:20:46,309 --> 00:20:47,279
Talked about that a little

917
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:47,759
earlier.

918
00:20:47,769 --> 00:20:48,720
And then transition.

919
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:50,079
Hey, let me summarize what I'm

920
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:51,220
hearing here to make sure I

921
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:52,680
understand this correctly.

922
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:54,079
Concise recap of their situation,

923
00:20:54,109 --> 00:20:55,619
their challenges, their goals.

924
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:56,259
Is that fair?

925
00:20:56,269 --> 00:20:57,509
Is there anything I haven't

926
00:20:57,509 --> 00:20:58,750
covered that you feel like I

927
00:20:58,759 --> 00:20:59,539
should know?

928
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:02,059
Once again, no.

929
00:21:02,069 --> 00:21:02,539
Cool.

930
00:21:02,569 --> 00:21:03,509
Now I've kind of got the

931
00:21:03,509 --> 00:21:04,569
permission to pitch.

932
00:21:04,829 --> 00:21:06,119
And we'll talk a little bit more

933
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:07,269
about the start of the pitch

934
00:21:07,269 --> 00:21:08,519
itself in the next video.

935
00:21:08,529 --> 00:21:11,799
But we do these things at the top

936
00:21:11,799 --> 00:21:14,000
from this on down.

937
00:21:14,009 --> 00:21:14,839
Like I said, rapport isn't

938
00:21:14,839 --> 00:21:15,740
typically make or break.

939
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:17,700
But from agenda on down, if we can

940
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,900
master this, I promise you, you're

941
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,940
going to be ahead of 99% of your

942
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,099
competition.

943
00:21:23,109 --> 00:21:24,579
I know that sounds like a corny,

944
00:21:24,579 --> 00:21:26,160
cheesy, cliche thing to say.

945
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:28,029
But just book a sales call with

946
00:21:28,029 --> 00:21:28,839
anybody.

947
00:21:28,849 --> 00:21:30,480
Book a sales call with somebody

948
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,150
and tell me if they're doing this

949
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:33,009
correctly.

950
00:21:34,269 --> 00:21:35,900
Because you will feel a huge

951
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:38,019
difference when somebody does and

952
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:39,279
when they don't.

953
00:21:39,289 --> 00:21:40,339
And most people just don't.

954
00:21:40,349 --> 00:21:41,599
Like most corporate sales gigs are

955
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:42,740
kind of just like, they'll ask a

956
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:44,049
few questions, they'll get onto

957
00:21:44,049 --> 00:21:44,480
the pitch.

958
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:45,809
And then all of a sudden when you

959
00:21:45,809 --> 00:21:47,039
give them a BS excuse as to why

960
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,200
you don't want to sign,

961
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:49,230
they don't really have the ammo

962
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,279
that they need to close you.

963
00:21:50,289 --> 00:21:52,160
They're kind of just like, okay,

964
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:52,640
cool.

965
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:53,859
When am I going to hear back from

966
00:21:53,859 --> 00:21:54,220
you?

967
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:55,359
What can I send over via email?

968
00:21:55,769 --> 00:21:56,140
Awesome.

969
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:57,279
Anybody else need to loop in?

970
00:21:57,289 --> 00:21:57,680
Cool.

971
00:21:57,690 --> 00:21:58,660
And then they're off.

972
00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:00,480
They don't really know how to set

973
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,970
themselves up for a one call

974
00:22:02,069 --> 00:22:02,640
close,

975
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:03,890
which starts at the top of half of

976
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:04,559
the call here.

977
00:22:04,569 --> 00:22:05,440
So I'm going to wrap it up there.

978
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:06,670
But hopefully you guys enjoyed

979
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:07,259
this thing.

980
00:22:07,269 --> 00:22:08,220
Super, super important as I

981
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:08,720
mentioned.
