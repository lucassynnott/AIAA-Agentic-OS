1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:01,320
What's going on guys, super

2
00:00:01,330 --> 00:00:02,459
excited for this video

3
00:00:02,459 --> 00:00:03,859
because finally, drum roll,

4
00:00:03,859 --> 00:00:05,719
the video you guys have all been

5
00:00:05,719 --> 00:00:06,620
waiting for,

6
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:08,230
this is the updated, I literally

7
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:08,980
just went through

8
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:09,960
and combed over every single

9
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:10,880
sentence in this thing,

10
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,970
the updated high ticket B2B sales

11
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:14,019
script template.

12
00:00:14,019 --> 00:00:15,259
And this is a super important

13
00:00:15,259 --> 00:00:16,230
video, obviously,

14
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:17,329
but there's a reason why I put

15
00:00:17,339 --> 00:00:17,739
this video

16
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,140
after videos like this for your

17
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:20,980
discovery

18
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:22,370
and this for your pitch and this

19
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:22,920
to dive deeper

20
00:00:22,989 --> 00:00:24,710
specifically into ROI based

21
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:25,789
closing logic.

22
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:27,679
And it's because all of this,

23
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:29,280
watching these videos first,

24
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,000
so if you haven't already,

25
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:31,010
I'd recommend going back and

26
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:31,579
watching these,

27
00:00:31,579 --> 00:00:33,259
is going to give you such a better

28
00:00:33,259 --> 00:00:34,140
understanding

29
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:35,640
as to how to actually make this

30
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:36,579
script your own,

31
00:00:36,579 --> 00:00:38,219
which is super important

32
00:00:38,229 --> 00:00:40,159
because this is templatized

33
00:00:40,219 --> 00:00:42,380
purposefully, obviously,

34
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:43,979
so anybody in here that shows any

35
00:00:43,979 --> 00:00:44,939
of the agency models

36
00:00:44,939 --> 00:00:47,710
can use this, but it's not just a

37
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:48,320
simple,

38
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,689
like let me change a few words

39
00:00:49,689 --> 00:00:50,920
around type of script.

40
00:00:50,979 --> 00:00:52,340
It's going to require real

41
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:52,820
thought.

42
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,299
And if you were expecting anything

43
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:54,920
different,

44
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,130
think about that logically.

45
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,159
Like would having a good pitch

46
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:00,460
that can beat out our competitors

47
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:02,960
be a super easy task to make?

48
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:06,219
Now, with this template

49
00:01:06,219 --> 00:01:07,500
and with watching these videos

50
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:08,120
beforehand,

51
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:08,629
it's going to be very

52
00:01:08,659 --> 00:01:09,920
straightforward for you guys,

53
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,040
but it's not going to be easy.

54
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,500
It's going to require some

55
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:13,200
brainpower

56
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,000
because once again,

57
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,180
if I was to just give you this

58
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:15,859
video up front

59
00:01:15,859 --> 00:01:16,500
and say,

60
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:17,659
hey, just change a couple words

61
00:01:17,659 --> 00:01:18,000
around,

62
00:01:18,019 --> 00:01:18,430
that'd be like,

63
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:19,319
just giving you guys a bunch of

64
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:19,750
junk food.

65
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:21,840
So super important that you're

66
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,299
coming into it

67
00:01:22,299 --> 00:01:23,760
with the context and the baseline

68
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,510
sales understanding

69
00:01:24,519 --> 00:01:25,310
that you've gotten from the

70
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:25,840
previous videos,

71
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,840
because if you do,

72
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,760
this can help you build a pitch

73
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,000
that I promise you,

74
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,060
I'm not trying to use this as a

75
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:31,459
cliche,

76
00:01:31,459 --> 00:01:33,109
will be better than 95% of the

77
00:01:33,109 --> 00:01:34,659
competition out there.

78
00:01:34,659 --> 00:01:35,700
So let's get into it.

79
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:36,819
First thing I started with

80
00:01:36,819 --> 00:01:38,219
is the service-driven mindset.

81
00:01:38,219 --> 00:01:39,680
Now, before we get into discovery,

82
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,739
one thing that's super important

83
00:01:40,739 --> 00:01:41,879
going back to this video

84
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:44,439
is this is a guide

85
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:45,939
that you can refer back to

86
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:47,640
all of the time

87
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,329
to know if you're on track

88
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:50,560
to have a productive conversation

89
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,000
or not

90
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,180
and just make sure like,

91
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:53,500
okay, did I get this information?

92
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,519
Did I get that information?

93
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:55,650
But it's also important to

94
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:56,099
remember

95
00:01:56,099 --> 00:01:57,500
that we're going for quality of

96
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,239
information,

97
00:01:58,239 --> 00:01:59,739
not volume of questions.

98
00:01:59,799 --> 00:02:01,299
And we'd rather go a mile deep

99
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:02,719
than a mile wide in discovery.

100
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:03,760
And I expand on that more

101
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,739
in this video specifically.

102
00:02:04,739 --> 00:02:05,719
But what I mean by that

103
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:07,480
is I can ask one question here.

104
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,180
I'm curious,

105
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:09,439
what specifically motivated you

106
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:10,319
to book in this call today?

107
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:12,039
This guy can give me basically

108
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:13,280
all the business background I need

109
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,780
and all of the current efforts

110
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,150
that they're doing right now.

111
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:17,099
And it's like, okay,

112
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:18,360
even though I didn't have to ask

113
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,039
all these questions,

114
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:20,310
I got this information.

115
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:21,819
I can just continue on

116
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,039
to what those current efforts

117
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:24,039
are actually resulting in.

118
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:24,900
Right?

119
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:25,939
So just one example

120
00:02:25,939 --> 00:02:26,699
of why you want to watch

121
00:02:26,699 --> 00:02:27,860
these previous videos beforehand.

122
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:28,400
Right?

123
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,039
Now, let's just start at the top.

124
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:30,879
Opening a report.

125
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:31,539
It's not going to make

126
00:02:31,539 --> 00:02:32,159
or break the call.

127
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:33,139
Don't be weird.

128
00:02:33,139 --> 00:02:34,409
Don't seem subservient.

129
00:02:34,419 --> 00:02:35,909
Be respectful of their time.

130
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:36,960
Keep it brief.

131
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,139
Jump right into the call.

132
00:02:38,139 --> 00:02:39,139
Setting the agenda.

133
00:02:39,139 --> 00:02:42,219
This is just a real quick sample.

134
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:43,340
This does not need to be

135
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:44,400
what your agenda looks like,

136
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,490
but it should get the point

137
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:45,900
across.

138
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:46,180
Right?

139
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:46,840
Hey, just so you know

140
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,349
what to expect,

141
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:47,960
this call is going to be

142
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,919
a casual conversation

143
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:49,650
to understand what

144
00:02:49,659 --> 00:02:50,969
your current situation looks like,

145
00:02:50,979 --> 00:02:51,860
what's working,

146
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:52,590
what's not,

147
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:53,710
what you're looking to accomplish.

148
00:02:53,719 --> 00:02:55,030
If it seems like we can help,

149
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:55,900
I'll walk you through

150
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:56,479
what working together

151
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:56,979
would look like

152
00:02:56,979 --> 00:02:57,620
so you can decide

153
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:58,919
if you want to get started today.

154
00:02:58,930 --> 00:02:59,759
Right?

155
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:00,159
Once again,

156
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:00,719
if we're trying to go

157
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:01,560
for one call closes,

158
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,500
let's set that expectation

159
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,080
right at the top.

160
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:04,800
If not,

161
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,680
it's completely fine too.

162
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,180
Either way,

163
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:06,610
just look in the point

164
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:07,219
in the right direction.

165
00:03:07,219 --> 00:03:07,819
Sound good?

166
00:03:07,819 --> 00:03:10,120
So once again,

167
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,280
you can make this your own,

168
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,759
but this is the general tone

169
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:14,360
and the point

170
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,300
that we're trying to get across.

171
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:16,699
Also guys,

172
00:03:16,699 --> 00:03:18,039
before diving in any deeper,

173
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:19,500
this is pretty much optimized

174
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,599
for a 30 minute one call close.

175
00:03:22,259 --> 00:03:23,099
That said,

176
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:24,680
if you do actually one call

177
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,479
close these people,

178
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:26,620
a lot of times

179
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:27,759
those are going to stretch out

180
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:29,259
to 40 minutes,

181
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,360
45 minutes.

182
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,669
So having a longer call

183
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,740
going over on time

184
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:33,800
isn't always a bad thing.

185
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:34,479
Actually,

186
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:35,460
a lot of times it's a good thing.

187
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:36,879
It means they're at really asking

188
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:37,900
buyer level questions

189
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,210
or really thinking about going

190
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:39,560
forward.

191
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,580
So they have more questions

192
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:41,740
than somebody who's just info

193
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:42,080
gathering

194
00:03:42,099 --> 00:03:43,080
and getting off the call.

195
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,560
That's completely fine.

196
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,780
I would still keep the slot

197
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,050
at 30 minutes

198
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,699
just because one,

199
00:03:48,699 --> 00:03:49,639
it seems less intimidating

200
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:50,219
to book in,

201
00:03:50,219 --> 00:03:50,840
but two,

202
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,800
if you have a 30 minute

203
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,180
appointment,

204
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:52,780
booked out

205
00:03:52,789 --> 00:03:55,199
and most people nowadays

206
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:56,639
have calendars with buffers,

207
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:57,969
but let's say I booked a call at

208
00:03:57,969 --> 00:03:58,680
1030.

209
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:58,909
I mean,

210
00:03:58,919 --> 00:03:59,520
it's late over here,

211
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,360
but let's say I booked a call

212
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,360
from 1030 to 11.

213
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,860
A quick question

214
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:03,520
that I can throw in

215
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,580
somewhere on the top here,

216
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:05,520
right?

217
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,030
It could be,

218
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:06,240
you know,

219
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:06,740
right around here,

220
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:07,699
even a business background,

221
00:04:07,699 --> 00:04:09,060
but just to kind of be conscious

222
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,750
of the time that you have,

223
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:12,939
you can just straight up ask him.

224
00:04:12,939 --> 00:04:13,819
I can even put this

225
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,740
call

226
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:21,420
shouldn't take two.

227
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:24,279
long by the way,

228
00:04:24,279 --> 00:04:27,339
but just to make sure

229
00:04:27,339 --> 00:04:29,420
we have time

230
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:32,699
to go over everything.

231
00:04:32,709 --> 00:04:37,040
Do you have a hard stop

232
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:39,800
at time?

233
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:43,449
Meeting is scheduled to end.

234
00:04:44,579 --> 00:04:45,040
So once again,

235
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,040
you asked this question,

236
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:46,959
if somebody doesn't have a hard

237
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:47,259
stop

238
00:04:47,259 --> 00:04:49,199
at 11 in this situation,

239
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:50,279
you're good

240
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:52,680
for usually the next 15 to 30

241
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,079
minutes

242
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:53,959
at least.

243
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:56,019
So we can actually just put this

244
00:04:56,019 --> 00:04:58,399
right below the agenda itself

245
00:04:58,399 --> 00:04:59,819
because it makes more sense here.

246
00:04:59,829 --> 00:05:04,529
Cool.

247
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:05,540
So I put it in there

248
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:06,620
right below the agenda itself.

249
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:07,139
Now,

250
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:07,959
the first question

251
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:09,000
after we do set the agenda

252
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,120
and if we want to check on time,

253
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,180
we say something like this

254
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:12,019
is typically,

255
00:05:12,019 --> 00:05:12,430
I'm curious,

256
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:12,629
man,

257
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:13,439
what motivated you

258
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:14,160
to book in this call today?

259
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:15,860
I promise you

260
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:16,240
this is going to be

261
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,420
a much more effective question

262
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:18,279
than asking them,

263
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:18,639
hey,

264
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:19,720
tell me a little bit more

265
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,279
about the business.

266
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:21,040
Tell me how many clients

267
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:21,300
you have

268
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,029
because you're going to get

269
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:22,959
more talkative prospects

270
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:23,800
at that point

271
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,069
who if you ask those questions

272
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:25,980
about what are your business,

273
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:26,560
I mean,

274
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,779
it's not even

275
00:05:27,779 --> 00:05:29,180
trying to be demeaning

276
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:29,759
to the prospects.

277
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:30,439
Like people are just

278
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:31,439
naturally passionate

279
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:32,180
about their business.

280
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:32,720
A lot of times

281
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,300
it's their baby.

282
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,180
They can talk for a long time

283
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:36,379
which means that

284
00:05:36,379 --> 00:05:37,560
you could get into a situation

285
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,319
where you're 10,

286
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:39,540
maybe even 15 minutes

287
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:40,139
into the call

288
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:41,279
and you really haven't

289
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:42,120
made much groundwork

290
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:42,720
in terms of what we're

291
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,579
looking to accomplish here.

292
00:05:43,579 --> 00:05:44,939
So do yourself a favor

293
00:05:44,939 --> 00:05:45,720
and start with this question.

294
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,220
Curious,

295
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,000
what motivated you

296
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,720
to book in this call today?

297
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:48,620
A lot of times

298
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:49,339
we're just going to tell you

299
00:05:49,339 --> 00:05:50,120
a lot of the most valuable

300
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:50,740
information that we're

301
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:51,620
looking for in the first place.

302
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:52,220
Right?

303
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,139
If they don't give you

304
00:05:53,139 --> 00:05:53,740
any information

305
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:54,339
and we want to dig

306
00:05:54,339 --> 00:05:55,040
a little bit more,

307
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,139
we can ask questions like,

308
00:05:56,139 --> 00:05:56,410
okay,

309
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:56,680
cool,

310
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,189
that makes sense.

311
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:57,459
I guess,

312
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:58,660
what's the ideal outcome

313
00:05:58,660 --> 00:05:59,480
that you're looking for

314
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,459
in this meeting?

315
00:06:00,459 --> 00:06:01,519
But usually this question

316
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:02,420
right here just does a trick

317
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:02,949
which is why I didn't

318
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:03,620
add anything else.

319
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:04,319
So now,

320
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:05,100
business background.

321
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:05,660
We talked about

322
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:06,420
why this is important

323
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:08,060
in this discovery video itself

324
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:09,300
so I won't go too deep into it

325
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,459
but here's some sample questions.

326
00:06:10,459 --> 00:06:11,139
Also,

327
00:06:11,139 --> 00:06:12,360
I added in a quick line up here.

328
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:13,519
Cool.

329
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:14,699
So I checked out your website

330
00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:16,470
and noticed you do ABC for XYZ.

331
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,160
Hey,

332
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,199
I noticed you do

333
00:06:18,209 --> 00:06:20,639
roofing

334
00:06:20,649 --> 00:06:22,839
for homeowners

335
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:23,420
and businesses

336
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:24,259
in the Houston area

337
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:24,939
but it's always good

338
00:06:24,939 --> 00:06:25,879
to hear straight from the source.

339
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:27,149
How are you guys currently?

340
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:28,160
positioning your offer

341
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:28,879
to potential clients,

342
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,189
right?

343
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:30,019
You're just starting off

344
00:06:30,019 --> 00:06:30,449
with a question

345
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,500
that is going to basically

346
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,639
help you get the information

347
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:33,069
that you need

348
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:33,579
to number one,

349
00:06:33,579 --> 00:06:34,439
qualify these people

350
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:35,480
and number two,

351
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:37,560
gather info and ammo

352
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,620
as I call it

353
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:39,560
that we can use

354
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,160
at the end of the call

355
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:40,639
to close them.

356
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,699
So that's why you ask

357
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:42,839
what's your typical

358
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:43,819
client lifetime value

359
00:06:43,819 --> 00:06:45,740
because if it's $50

360
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,949
versus $10,000

361
00:06:48,009 --> 00:06:48,879
obviously,

362
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:50,220
these guys are going to need

363
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,240
a lot more clients

364
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:51,779
to close

365
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:53,259
but if it's $10,000

366
00:06:53,259 --> 00:06:54,529
a lot of times

367
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:55,560
selling these services,

368
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,959
one singular client

369
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:57,800
in the first three months

370
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,319
is going to make this

371
00:06:58,319 --> 00:06:59,480
a massively ROI

372
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,319
positive investment,

373
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:00,730
right?

374
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:01,379
So you can think

375
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:01,879
a little bit more

376
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:02,779
about what information

377
00:07:02,779 --> 00:07:03,800
is actually relevant here

378
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,620
and I would actually

379
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:05,519
recommend as you guys

380
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:06,199
go through this,

381
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:07,800
don't overthink it

382
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,480
to start

383
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,170
but start to analyze

384
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:10,620
your calls,

385
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:11,439
start to watch back

386
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:12,100
some of your calls

387
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:12,600
and just be like,

388
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:12,860
hmm,

389
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:14,800
did this help me

390
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,740
qualify the person?

391
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:18,329
Did this help me

392
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:19,459
gather ammo

393
00:07:19,459 --> 00:07:20,819
that I could use

394
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:21,680
to close them?

395
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:23,000
and what I mean

396
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,430
by that

397
00:07:23,449 --> 00:07:25,459
is showcasing

398
00:07:25,459 --> 00:07:26,079
the ROIs

399
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:26,779
so like LTV

400
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:29,199
or information

401
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:29,930
that really helps

402
00:07:29,939 --> 00:07:30,800
you tailor the pitch

403
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,500
and helps it hit

404
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,399
more for this person.

405
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:33,490
So did it help

406
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,120
you gather

407
00:07:34,129 --> 00:07:35,540
useful information

408
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:36,160
for pitching

409
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,160
and closing the prospect

410
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:37,980
or did it help

411
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,519
us qualify them?

412
00:07:39,529 --> 00:07:40,500
Because if it didn't

413
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,060
achieve either

414
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:41,800
of those functions,

415
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:44,480
it's really not

416
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,180
serving a purpose

417
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,199
so we don't need

418
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:46,819
to ask about it

419
00:07:46,819 --> 00:07:47,500
and this is where

420
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,279
we can shave time.

421
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:48,980
I've had a lot

422
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:49,339
of closers

423
00:07:49,339 --> 00:07:50,259
who do a perfect

424
00:07:50,259 --> 00:07:51,180
job of just getting

425
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,379
the need-to-know basis.

426
00:07:52,379 --> 00:07:53,339
I've also had a lot

427
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:54,319
of closers who tend

428
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:55,319
to ask almost too much

429
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:56,339
about the business

430
00:07:56,339 --> 00:07:57,139
which isn't going

431
00:07:57,139 --> 00:07:57,800
to kill you,

432
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:58,620
right?

433
00:07:58,620 --> 00:07:59,959
It's always good

434
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:00,879
to get context

435
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:01,290
and the reason

436
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:01,959
why we start off

437
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:02,560
with this is so

438
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,420
they feel like

439
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:04,439
they're being heard

440
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:05,660
and they feel like

441
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:06,360
whatever recommendations

442
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:06,939
we make

443
00:08:06,939 --> 00:08:08,180
don't lack context

444
00:08:08,189 --> 00:08:10,560
but those people

445
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,319
who spend too much

446
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:12,120
time in this section

447
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,000
or just ask

448
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,639
useful questions

449
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:14,240
that one,

450
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,500
don't qualify them

451
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:15,910
or two,

452
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,600
don't help us

453
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,220
tailor the pitch

454
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:17,839
or close them,

455
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:19,839
they tend to have

456
00:08:19,889 --> 00:08:21,000
discoveries that

457
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,500
aren't as productive

458
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,279
just because they'll

459
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:23,819
get to a point

460
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:24,220
where they're like

461
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:25,199
10-15 minutes in

462
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:25,519
and they're kind

463
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:26,120
of looking at the clock

464
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:26,389
and they're like

465
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:26,600
fuck,

466
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:27,439
I should just go

467
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:27,879
in and pitch,

468
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:28,540
right?

469
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:29,360
And we kind of know

470
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,660
here the pitches

471
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,879
or the discovery phases

472
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:32,220
you know,

473
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:32,559
you want to be

474
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,460
about 15 minutes,

475
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:34,038
a little bit longer,

476
00:08:34,038 --> 00:08:34,679
a little bit shorter,

477
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:35,990
not going to be

478
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,700
a huge issue there.

479
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:37,399
This is definitely

480
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:38,490
like the timing aspect,

481
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,899
this is a guesstimation,

482
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:41,279
it's definitely

483
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:42,179
not an exact science.

484
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:42,779
Also,

485
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:43,759
just in terms of help

486
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:44,759
for navigating the script,

487
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:46,970
like actual sample things

488
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:47,700
that I would say,

489
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:48,879
on a call

490
00:08:48,889 --> 00:08:51,240
are put in quotations

491
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,419
and then anything

492
00:08:52,419 --> 00:08:53,539
that is like

493
00:08:53,539 --> 00:08:55,019
more so an instruction

494
00:08:55,029 --> 00:08:58,259
or just kind of like

495
00:08:58,259 --> 00:08:59,179
my thoughts on it

496
00:08:59,179 --> 00:09:01,340
is either italicized

497
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,980
or I put it in between

498
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:04,470
whatever you call

499
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,659
these little star things here

500
00:09:06,659 --> 00:09:07,460
which you'll see later

501
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:08,299
in the pitch.

502
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:09,860
so we get context

503
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:10,340
in their business,

504
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:10,769
let's get into

505
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:11,480
the current efforts

506
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,570
so essentially

507
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:13,139
what are they doing

508
00:09:13,139 --> 00:09:14,659
for content creation,

509
00:09:14,659 --> 00:09:15,139
what are they doing

510
00:09:15,139 --> 00:09:16,019
for paid ads,

511
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:16,539
what are they doing

512
00:09:16,539 --> 00:09:17,419
for cold email,

513
00:09:17,419 --> 00:09:18,200
whatever your service

514
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:18,720
happens to be,

515
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,799
we're trying to figure out

516
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:20,860
what are they currently

517
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:21,820
doing for that right now

518
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,700
and if they're doing nothing

519
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:24,259
right,

520
00:09:24,259 --> 00:09:24,759
so if we're asking

521
00:09:24,759 --> 00:09:25,600
about their lead generation

522
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:25,960
they're like

523
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,799
well I'm not doing anything

524
00:09:26,809 --> 00:09:29,759
tonality plays a big role there

525
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:30,720
because we want to

526
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,519
essentially just be like

527
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:32,360
oh you guys aren't

528
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:32,889
you guys aren't doing

529
00:09:32,899 --> 00:09:33,519
anything at all

530
00:09:33,529 --> 00:09:34,960
oh okay

531
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:36,980
scribble on your notepad

532
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:39,779
and like that response

533
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:40,860
will start to create

534
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:41,919
that like urgency

535
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:42,500
and they'll start

536
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,009
to bubble up

537
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:43,720
they're like oh shit

538
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,700
like this isn't usual

539
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:45,399
most businesses

540
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:46,100
in my situation

541
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,190
are doing lead generation

542
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,320
and that can be helpful

543
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,159
right to start generating

544
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:49,590
some pain

545
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:50,700
to start generating

546
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:51,220
some urgency

547
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,480
for that prospect

548
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,690
so continuing on

549
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:55,360
you guys can see

550
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:55,960
what other things

551
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,519
so like okay

552
00:09:56,519 --> 00:09:56,929
what are you guys

553
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:57,539
currently doing

554
00:09:57,539 --> 00:09:58,460
what's working

555
00:09:58,460 --> 00:09:59,139
what's not

556
00:09:59,139 --> 00:10:00,039
what have you tried

557
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:00,659
in the past

558
00:10:00,659 --> 00:10:02,059
what other solutions

559
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:02,559
are you considering

560
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:02,990
right now

561
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:03,879
and the reason why

562
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:04,639
like these questions

563
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:05,580
are important right now

564
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:06,159
is because

565
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:07,179
maybe they're not

566
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:08,519
doing paid ads

567
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:09,200
at the moment

568
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,600
but maybe they did

569
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,519
have a really bad

570
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:12,240
experience with paid

571
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,379
ads agency a year ago

572
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:14,539
super important

573
00:10:14,539 --> 00:10:15,259
to know about that

574
00:10:15,269 --> 00:10:16,340
because if I don't

575
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:17,100
ask about that

576
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:17,960
and they just say

577
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,389
I'm not doing

578
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:18,960
any paid ads

579
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:19,500
I'm like okay

580
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,559
cool I'll continue on

581
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:21,940
and then I get to the pitch

582
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:23,059
not knowing this

583
00:10:23,059 --> 00:10:24,440
they can just be like

584
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,399
yeah dude this sounds good

585
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:26,200
but like we worked

586
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,000
with the paid ads agency

587
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,620
a year ago

588
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:28,019
they were saying

589
00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:28,580
a lot of the stuff

590
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:29,159
that you're saying

591
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:29,570
right here

592
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:31,039
cool right

593
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,039
like that's exactly

594
00:10:32,039 --> 00:10:32,539
what we're looking

595
00:10:32,539 --> 00:10:33,039
to avoid

596
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:34,309
so if they did try

597
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,039
something in the past

598
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:36,039
let's ask more

599
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:37,019
questions about that

600
00:10:37,029 --> 00:10:37,879
right

601
00:10:37,889 --> 00:10:39,179
hey how'd that go

602
00:10:39,179 --> 00:10:40,360
didn't work out

603
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:40,960
not at all

604
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,500
didn't get a single

605
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:41,769
client

606
00:10:41,779 --> 00:10:42,320
why not

607
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:42,679
what do you think

608
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:43,320
the issue was there

609
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:44,059
right

610
00:10:44,059 --> 00:10:45,059
like let's get

611
00:10:45,059 --> 00:10:45,840
more context here

612
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,200
once again

613
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:46,700
this is just

614
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:47,860
kind of an estimation

615
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:48,539
of what questions

616
00:10:48,539 --> 00:10:49,200
you would be asking

617
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:49,470
here

618
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,299
there's definitely

619
00:10:50,299 --> 00:10:51,080
going to be a situation

620
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:51,700
where to get the

621
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:52,620
quality of information

622
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:53,259
that we want

623
00:10:53,259 --> 00:10:54,440
and to go a mile

624
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,240
deep as opposed

625
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,159
to a mile wide

626
00:10:56,169 --> 00:10:57,419
once again

627
00:10:57,419 --> 00:10:58,000
all stuff that I've

628
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,529
talked about in this

629
00:10:58,539 --> 00:10:58,730
video

630
00:10:58,740 --> 00:10:59,240
so if you haven't

631
00:10:59,240 --> 00:10:59,539
watched it

632
00:10:59,539 --> 00:11:00,179
make sure that you do

633
00:11:00,179 --> 00:11:01,340
really important

634
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,539
to kind of dig

635
00:11:02,539 --> 00:11:03,440
on those specific

636
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,379
like key factors

637
00:11:04,379 --> 00:11:04,649
here

638
00:11:04,669 --> 00:11:06,159
what other solutions

639
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:06,529
are you guys

640
00:11:06,539 --> 00:11:07,360
considering right now

641
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,240
because once again

642
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:08,740
we don't want to get

643
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:09,460
blindsided at the end

644
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:09,879
of the call

645
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:10,610
when they're like

646
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:11,299
yeah this is all

647
00:11:11,299 --> 00:11:11,820
good and well

648
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:12,549
but like I'm actually

649
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:13,679
looking at this agency

650
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:14,519
and they're a lot

651
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:15,200
less expensive

652
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,470
than you guys

653
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:16,960
so I'm going to

654
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,039
take that call

655
00:11:18,039 --> 00:11:18,539
and then we're going

656
00:11:18,539 --> 00:11:19,320
to see how it goes

657
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:20,600
where

658
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:23,320
if I get blindsided

659
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,139
by that I may not

660
00:11:24,139 --> 00:11:24,940
have a good comeback

661
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:25,620
I may not have a good

662
00:11:25,629 --> 00:11:26,200
response

663
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,200
I may not

664
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:27,460
you know

665
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:28,240
be able to reframe

666
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:28,620
that question

667
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,200
just because I'm

668
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:29,940
caught off guard

669
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,029
but if I understand

670
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:32,100
that going into the

671
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:32,440
pitch

672
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:33,940
okay I'm registering

673
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,840
that right

674
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,759
so when somebody

675
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:36,500
does say something

676
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,019
like that

677
00:11:37,019 --> 00:11:37,960
I know how to

678
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:38,740
position our service

679
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:39,360
against theirs

680
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,340
I can use the

681
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:40,769
framework

682
00:11:40,779 --> 00:11:41,899
that I talked

683
00:11:41,899 --> 00:11:42,440
about in the

684
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:42,870
perfect flow

685
00:11:42,909 --> 00:11:43,820
conversation video

686
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:44,299
which I don't

687
00:11:44,299 --> 00:11:45,029
have the gamma doc

688
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:45,980
pulled up here

689
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:46,799
but I can understand

690
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:48,299
how to acknowledge

691
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,000
that question

692
00:11:49,009 --> 00:11:49,519
associate

693
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:50,580
and ask a better

694
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:51,669
question to reframe

695
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,409
and get them to

696
00:11:52,419 --> 00:11:52,759
change their

697
00:11:52,759 --> 00:11:53,190
perspective

698
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,379
so once again

699
00:11:54,379 --> 00:11:55,360
going into previous

700
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:55,669
videos

701
00:11:55,679 --> 00:11:56,179
this is why

702
00:11:56,179 --> 00:11:56,679
I showed this

703
00:11:56,679 --> 00:11:57,110
thing last

704
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:57,429
so you guys

705
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,019
can make a

706
00:11:58,019 --> 00:11:59,620
real killer

707
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:00,000
script

708
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,259
quantifying current

709
00:12:01,259 --> 00:12:01,559
results

710
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:02,220
okay so this is

711
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:02,720
what they're doing

712
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:04,580
this is exactly

713
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:05,340
what it's resulting

714
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:05,600
in

715
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:06,840
like I said

716
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,269
in the discovery

717
00:12:07,299 --> 00:12:07,730
video

718
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:08,759
be wary of ranges

719
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:09,360
we want to get

720
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:09,940
like a real

721
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:10,639
understanding of

722
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:11,200
what point A

723
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:11,700
is when I say

724
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:12,460
be wary of ranges

725
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:13,340
I mean

726
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:14,580
don't accept them

727
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:14,990
saying

728
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,740
we typically get

729
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:17,580
10 to 15 calls

730
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:17,840
a month

731
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:18,860
okay cool

732
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:19,289
like how many

733
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,220
calls a month

734
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:20,860
exactly did you

735
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:21,269
guys get in the

736
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:21,899
last 30 days

737
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:22,330
I'm curious

738
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:24,039
right

739
00:12:24,039 --> 00:12:24,840
a lot of times

740
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,269
like I said

741
00:12:25,299 --> 00:12:25,700
it ends up

742
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:26,080
being 8

743
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:26,830
which doesn't

744
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:27,289
fall in 10

745
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:27,730
to 15

746
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:28,600
but once again

747
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,259
we want to

748
00:12:29,269 --> 00:12:30,399
have them

749
00:12:30,409 --> 00:12:32,340
speak

750
00:12:32,409 --> 00:12:33,559
and say

751
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:34,340
how bad

752
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:35,399
the situation

753
00:12:35,409 --> 00:12:35,470
is

754
00:12:35,899 --> 00:12:36,879
at this point

755
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:37,600
because once again

756
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,080
that's what's

757
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:38,440
going to create

758
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:38,820
the urgency

759
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,379
that actually

760
00:12:39,379 --> 00:12:39,690
gets them

761
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:40,059
to realize

762
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:40,539
that they need

763
00:12:40,539 --> 00:12:40,740
this

764
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:41,190
we want them

765
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:41,629
to come to

766
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:42,019
realization

767
00:12:42,039 --> 00:12:42,470
that they need

768
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:42,860
this on their

769
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:43,019
own

770
00:12:43,019 --> 00:12:43,379
and create

771
00:12:43,379 --> 00:12:43,700
a little bit

772
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:44,009
of urgency

773
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:45,710
once again

774
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,129
these are just

775
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:47,220
more questions

776
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:47,649
to ask

777
00:12:47,659 --> 00:12:48,600
like how is

778
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:48,960
what they're

779
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,299
doing

780
00:12:49,309 --> 00:12:50,659
resulting in

781
00:12:50,669 --> 00:12:52,340
any

782
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:53,019
meaningful

783
00:12:53,019 --> 00:12:53,450
results

784
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:53,889
if it is

785
00:12:53,899 --> 00:12:54,309
right

786
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:54,940
now goals

787
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:55,009
clarification

788
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:55,850
right

789
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:56,059
so we

790
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:56,350
understand

791
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:56,740
what point

792
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:57,000
A is

793
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,429
pretty well

794
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,059
let's go

795
00:12:58,059 --> 00:12:58,379
on to the

796
00:12:58,379 --> 00:12:58,679
goals

797
00:12:58,690 --> 00:12:59,480
like I talked

798
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,000
about here

799
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,639
we want to

800
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:01,000
lead them

801
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,320
if they don't

802
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:01,879
have a specific

803
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:02,289
answer

804
00:13:02,309 --> 00:13:03,679
and then

805
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:04,419
we're getting

806
00:13:04,419 --> 00:13:05,159
into the

807
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:05,940
pain duration

808
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:06,820
and impact

809
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:07,230
and once again

810
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:07,750
you guys can see

811
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:08,059
what I mean

812
00:13:08,059 --> 00:13:08,360
about the

813
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:08,720
instruction

814
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,059
with this

815
00:13:09,059 --> 00:13:09,419
being in

816
00:13:09,419 --> 00:13:10,000
quotations

817
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,340
and this

818
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:10,940
being just

819
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:11,679
italicized

820
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:12,259
right

821
00:13:12,269 --> 00:13:13,519
good example

822
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:13,720
here

823
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:14,059
like if

824
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:14,250
they're just

825
00:13:14,259 --> 00:13:14,559
like yeah

826
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:14,919
we want

827
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:15,440
more revenue

828
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:15,919
more views

829
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:16,320
like that's

830
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:16,659
not a real

831
00:13:16,659 --> 00:13:16,970
goal

832
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:17,799
the reason

833
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:18,230
we define

834
00:13:18,259 --> 00:13:18,620
the goal

835
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:19,820
is to define

836
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:20,419
what point B

837
00:13:20,419 --> 00:13:20,850
looks like

838
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:21,259
because the

839
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:21,620
whole point

840
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:22,029
of the pitch

841
00:13:22,039 --> 00:13:23,279
is we want

842
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:23,620
to position

843
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:24,000
ourselves

844
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:24,500
as a straight

845
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:24,860
line from

846
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:25,179
point A

847
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:25,679
to point B

848
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:27,440
and an

849
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,059
example of

850
00:13:28,059 --> 00:13:28,419
leading them

851
00:13:28,419 --> 00:13:28,620
would be

852
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:29,019
like got

853
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:29,230
it

854
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,100
more clients

855
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:30,409
is definitely

856
00:13:30,419 --> 00:13:30,799
our goal

857
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:31,059
too

858
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:31,620
right

859
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:31,919
so we

860
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:32,019
don't

861
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:32,159
want to

862
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:32,429
make them

863
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,000
feel like

864
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:33,559
an asshole

865
00:13:33,559 --> 00:13:33,919
for not

866
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:34,440
having like

867
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:34,750
a defined

868
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:35,059
goal

869
00:13:35,059 --> 00:13:35,490
once again

870
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:35,720
it's hard

871
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:35,919
to have

872
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:36,080
to lead

873
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:36,179
them

874
00:13:36,179 --> 00:13:36,720
yeah got

875
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:36,879
it

876
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:37,480
more clients

877
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:37,750
is definitely

878
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:38,059
our goal

879
00:13:38,059 --> 00:13:38,259
too

880
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:38,659
but just

881
00:13:38,659 --> 00:13:38,929
so we can

882
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:39,580
define success

883
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:40,059
here so I

884
00:13:40,059 --> 00:13:40,379
know what to

885
00:13:40,379 --> 00:13:40,759
shoot for

886
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:41,639
what would

887
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:41,909
make you

888
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:42,399
look back

889
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:43,539
in three

890
00:13:43,539 --> 00:13:43,899
months

891
00:13:43,899 --> 00:13:44,480
and make

892
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:44,740
you say

893
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:45,120
yeah this

894
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:45,600
was absolutely

895
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:46,399
worth it

896
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:47,899
right they're

897
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:48,350
gonna they're

898
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:48,940
gonna think a

899
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:49,200
little bit

900
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:49,559
more and

901
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:49,759
they may

902
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:50,320
pause they

903
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,639
may talk

904
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:51,950
to you

905
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,370
back and

906
00:13:52,379 --> 00:13:52,940
forth about

907
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:53,539
what's typically

908
00:13:53,539 --> 00:13:53,840
good and

909
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,220
what's not

910
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:54,720
good we

911
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,320
want that

912
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:55,840
conversation

913
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,220
to happen

914
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:56,799
pain

915
00:13:56,799 --> 00:13:57,230
duration and

916
00:13:57,259 --> 00:13:57,759
impact this

917
00:13:57,759 --> 00:13:58,299
basically goes

918
00:13:58,299 --> 00:13:58,980
back to

919
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:00,840
the how

920
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,220
long and

921
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:01,740
how likely

922
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,340
concept here

923
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:04,120
right how

924
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:04,500
long they've

925
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:04,840
been struggling

926
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,100
with their

927
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,259
goals or

928
00:14:06,259 --> 00:14:06,639

with this

930
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,120
problem if

00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:08,480
they seem

932
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,379
indifferent let's

933
00:14:09,379 --> 00:14:09,879
dig for more

934
00:14:09,879 --> 00:14:10,289
pain

935
00:14:10,299 --> 00:14:11,019
that's one

936
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:11,259
of those

937
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:11,480

that's that's

949
00:14:17,299 --> 00:14:18,139
within itself

950
00:14:18,139 --> 00:14:18,500
kind of a

951
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,179

this time is

956
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,139
another question

957
00:14:22,139 --> 00:14:22,639
we can ask

958
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:22,830
if we're

959
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,159

00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:25,509
working as

965
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:26,100
is I guess

966
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:26,620

right we

972
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:33,460
want to in

973
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:34,159
situations like

974
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:34,590
this where they

975
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:34,940
just seem

976
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:35,480
very indifferent

977
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,159
like you

978
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:36,659

ever heard that

982
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:38,330
concept

983
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:40,159
once again

00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:41,600
like I just

987
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,090
mumbled that

988
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:43,820
for whatever

989
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:44,980
reason but the

990
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:45,389
reason why you

991
00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:45,669
want to do

992
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:46,379
that is because

993
00:14:46,389 --> 00:14:49,190
one we want

994
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,200
to obviously

995
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:50,960
dig up more

996
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,480
pain like we're

997
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,120
talking about but

998
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,120
two we don't

999
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:53,429
want to seem

1000
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,279
overly needy

1001
00:14:54,289 --> 00:14:56,659
right so if we

1002
00:14:56,659 --> 00:14:57,620
lean out as

1003
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:58,049
opposed to being

1004
00:14:58,059 --> 00:14:58,460
like are you

1005
00:14:58,460 --> 00:14:58,820
sure you don't

1006
00:14:58,820 --> 00:14:59,340
want this right

1007
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:00,120
now like I

1008
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:00,700
think we could

1009
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:01,279
really help you

1010
00:15:01,289 --> 00:15:02,539
hey so things

1011
00:15:02,539 --> 00:15:02,840
are generally

1012
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,440
working as is

1013
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,059
what has you

1014
00:15:04,059 --> 00:15:04,490
looking into

1015
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,360
paid ads in

1016
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:05,840
the first place

1017
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:08,340
we'll get some

1018
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:08,919
more information

1019
00:15:08,919 --> 00:15:09,299
out of them

1020
00:15:09,309 --> 00:15:10,299
opportunity cost

1021
00:15:10,299 --> 00:15:10,639
and readiness

1022
00:15:10,649 --> 00:15:12,139
this is the

1023
00:15:12,179 --> 00:15:12,610
how likely

1024
00:15:12,629 --> 00:15:13,500
portion how

1025
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:13,929
likely do you

1026
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:14,279
think you are

1027
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:14,639
to hit those

1028
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:15,019
goals without

1029
00:15:15,019 --> 00:15:15,559
addressing issues

1030
00:15:15,559 --> 00:15:16,100
we discussed

1031
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:18,000
right obviously

1032
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:18,960
like tailor this

1033
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,779
to whatever your

1034
00:15:19,779 --> 00:15:20,700
pitch is okay

1035
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:21,080
it sounds like

1036
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:21,559
this priority

1037
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:22,039
then so I

1038
00:15:22,039 --> 00:15:23,259
guess whether

1039
00:15:23,259 --> 00:15:23,919
you're working

1040
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:24,279
with us or

1041
00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:25,080
not once again

1042
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:25,899
like this is

1043
00:15:25,899 --> 00:15:26,779
another almost

1044
00:15:26,779 --> 00:15:27,440
like a form of

1045
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:27,960
leaning out

1046
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:28,539
because we're

1047
00:15:28,539 --> 00:15:29,049
not trying to

1048
00:15:29,059 --> 00:15:29,559
just seem like

1049
00:15:29,559 --> 00:15:30,259
we're shamelessly

1050
00:15:30,259 --> 00:15:30,779
shilling our

1051
00:15:30,779 --> 00:15:31,419
service because

1052
00:15:31,419 --> 00:15:32,039
we haven't

1053
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:33,299
pitched yet so

1054
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:33,730
I mean they

1055
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:34,779
can't give you

1056
00:15:34,779 --> 00:15:35,399
guys a commitment

1057
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:36,320
here at this

1058
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:36,850
point I wish it

1059
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:37,360
was that easy

1060
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,629
but we can say

1061
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:39,100
so whether you're

1062
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:39,509
working with us

1063
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,539
or not on this

1064
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:41,139
issue is that

1065
00:15:41,139 --> 00:15:41,639
something that

1066
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:42,299
you're wanting

1067
00:15:42,299 --> 00:15:42,919
ready to address

1068
00:15:42,929 --> 00:15:44,610
now which

1069
00:15:44,629 --> 00:15:45,879
obviously you're

1070
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:46,240
going to have a

1071
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:46,940
high take rate on

1072
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:47,500
this question if

1073
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,009
they're like no

1074
00:15:48,019 --> 00:15:48,429
we don't think

1075
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:48,710
we're going to

1076
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,299
hit this goal

1077
00:15:49,299 --> 00:15:49,980
they're going to

1078
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:50,840
be like yeah

1079
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,200
dude we do and

1080
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:52,759
sometimes they

1081
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:53,539
maybe like a

1082
00:15:53,539 --> 00:15:54,440
yeah no shit

1083
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:55,940
type of response

1084
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,879
for them at

1085
00:15:56,879 --> 00:15:57,600
this point but

1086
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,120
that's perfectly

1087
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,059
fine because this

1088
00:15:59,059 --> 00:15:59,879
is ammo that we

1089
00:15:59,879 --> 00:16:00,500
can use in the

1090
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,299
closing process

1091
00:16:01,299 --> 00:16:02,000
because we're

1092
00:16:02,009 --> 00:16:03,019
essentially when

1093
00:16:03,019 --> 00:16:03,679
they try to delay

1094
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:04,039
at the end of

1095
00:16:04,039 --> 00:16:04,919
the call we

1096
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:06,230
have their own

1097
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:07,299
words to flip

1098
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:07,980
back on them

1099
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:09,779
because they

1100
00:16:09,789 --> 00:16:10,720
earlier had told

1101
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,379
us yeah they're

1102
00:16:11,379 --> 00:16:11,960
ready to address

1103
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:12,960
this now once

1104
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,779
again if they

1105
00:16:13,779 --> 00:16:14,179
seem like they

1106
00:16:14,179 --> 00:16:14,679
don't need you

1107
00:16:14,679 --> 00:16:15,720
let's dig hey

1108
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,220
I guess if you're

1109
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:16,649
confident you're

1110
00:16:16,679 --> 00:16:17,000
going to get to

1111
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:17,340
this goal

1112
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:18,820
regardless and

1113
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:19,340
you're currently

1114
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:20,610
only at eight

1115
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:21,100
calls a month

1116
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:21,759
what's what's

1117
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:24,340
the plan oh I

1118
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:24,870
think you know we

1119
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:25,379
may be able to

1120
00:16:25,379 --> 00:16:26,500
just wrap up our

1121
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,159
internal legion

1122
00:16:27,169 --> 00:16:29,720
systems yeah I

1123
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,279
guess why not just

1124
00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:31,139
do that once again

1125
00:16:31,139 --> 00:16:31,639
I'm leaning out

1126
00:16:31,649 --> 00:16:34,399
here yeah I guess

1127
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:34,759
you know we're

1128
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:35,059
kind of just

1129
00:16:35,059 --> 00:16:35,360
looking at

1130
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,120
different situations

1131
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:36,679
here where it's

1132
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:37,480
like we could do

1133
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,679
that but historically

1134
00:16:38,679 --> 00:16:39,299
it hasn't worked

1135
00:16:39,299 --> 00:16:40,779
for us okay so

1136
00:16:40,779 --> 00:16:41,500
I'll get into what

1137
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,080
we're doing here in

1138
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:42,860
a second because

1139
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:43,399
at this point there

1140
00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:43,809
may be a little

1141
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:44,679
bit like fucking

1142
00:16:44,679 --> 00:16:45,299
pitch me already

1143
00:16:45,299 --> 00:16:47,039
which is fine right

1144
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:47,960
if anybody gets

1145
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:48,740
impatient I'll talk

1146
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:49,149
about that in a

1147
00:16:49,159 --> 00:16:50,059
second but we can

1148
00:16:50,059 --> 00:16:50,779
say okay so I'll

1149
00:16:50,779 --> 00:16:51,190
get into what we're

1150
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:51,629
doing here in a

1151
00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:52,419
second but if it

1152
00:16:52,419 --> 00:16:52,919
seems like we're a

1153
00:16:52,919 --> 00:16:53,399
better alternative

1154
00:16:53,409 --> 00:16:54,779
than you guys

1155
00:16:54,779 --> 00:16:55,899
doing what you

1156
00:16:55,899 --> 00:16:56,440
have been doing

1157
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,600
or you know

1158
00:16:57,610 --> 00:16:58,299
potentially just

1159
00:16:58,309 --> 00:17:00,240
revamping things

1160
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:01,620
internally is this

1161
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:02,019
something you'd pull

1162
00:17:02,019 --> 00:17:02,600
the trigger on

1163
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:04,799
because that's all I

1164
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:05,440
can look for right

1165
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,140
I can't get them to

1166
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:06,960
commit to it at

1167
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:07,818
this point but I

1168
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:09,318
at least want some

1169
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,119
verbal commitment

1170
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:11,078
that okay if it

1171
00:17:11,078 --> 00:17:11,900
seems better than

1172
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,279
that alternative that

1173
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:13,940
they just mentioned

1174
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:16,059
which probably isn't

1175
00:17:16,059 --> 00:17:16,619
that good right

1176
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:17,220
because these guys

1177
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:18,720
haven't hit these

1178
00:17:18,779 --> 00:17:19,740
goals yet is this

1179
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:20,150
something you'd pull

1180
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,619
the trigger on right

1181
00:17:21,619 --> 00:17:22,338
we get that

1182
00:17:22,348 --> 00:17:23,318
information we

1183
00:17:23,328 --> 00:17:24,049
transition to the

1184
00:17:24,088 --> 00:17:25,380
pitch now what I

1185
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:25,960
was saying about

1186
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:26,880
when it seems like

1187
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,500
somebody is almost

1188
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,640
like uneasy and

1189
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,369
discovery or almost

1190
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,279
combative or just

1191
00:17:30,279 --> 00:17:31,339
coming through hey

1192
00:17:31,339 --> 00:17:32,180
just pitch me bro

1193
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:33,559
one of those guys

1194
00:17:33,559 --> 00:17:35,160
I'm in sales I get

1195
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,970
it don't play their

1196
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:39,779
game right first

1197
00:17:39,789 --> 00:17:41,680
off hey you know

1198
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:43,420
maybe like one

1199
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:44,339
technique we can

1200
00:17:44,339 --> 00:17:44,940
use here that I

1201
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:47,140
like to employ is

1202
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:48,160
just falling on our

1203
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:50,099
sword which means

1204
00:17:50,109 --> 00:17:52,119
hey maybe I'm not

1205
00:17:52,119 --> 00:17:53,160
asking you know the

1206
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,059
best questions here

1207
00:17:54,069 --> 00:17:55,259
right now they're

1208
00:17:55,259 --> 00:17:55,519
going to be like

1209
00:17:55,519 --> 00:17:56,480
okay dude they

1210
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,000
almost start to feel

1211
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:57,720
bad for you hey

1212
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,960
maybe I'm not asking

1213
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:59,500
the right questions

1214
00:17:59,500 --> 00:17:59,930
here but I guess

1215
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:00,660
the reason why I'm

1216
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:01,319
asking these questions

1217
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:02,039
in the first place

1218
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:03,529
is just to figure out

1219
00:18:03,539 --> 00:18:04,460
if we really can help

1220
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:07,980
you or not and

1221
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,440
based on different

1222
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,220
clients we've talked

1223
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:11,079
to different prospects

1224
00:18:11,079 --> 00:18:12,119
we've talked to you

1225
00:18:12,119 --> 00:18:12,779
know this is one of

1226
00:18:12,779 --> 00:18:13,859
those those key things

1227
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:14,900
that you know we kind

1228
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:15,880
of need to know so I

1229
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:16,440
guess with that in

1230
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:19,200
mind insert question

1231
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:19,900
right we want to

1232
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:20,559
always kind of follow

1233
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:21,220
up with a question

1234
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:22,440
because once again

1235
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,380
the person who's

1236
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:23,920
asking the question

1237
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:24,579
is leading the call

1238
00:18:24,579 --> 00:18:24,980
they're the one in

1239
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:26,220
control but if they

1240
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:26,839
seem to be super

1241
00:18:26,849 --> 00:18:28,279
impatient let's let's

1242
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:29,079
fall on our sword a

1243
00:18:29,079 --> 00:18:30,259
little bit even if

1244
00:18:30,259 --> 00:18:31,240
we're completely in the

1245
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:31,670
right and they're in

1246
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,779
the wrong hey my bad

1247
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,519
man just just to give

1248
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:36,099
you some context

1249
00:18:36,099 --> 00:18:36,640
on why I'm asking

1250
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,200
these questions in

1251
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:37,680
the first place

1252
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:38,980
remind them that we're

1253
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:40,160
helping them and then

1254
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:40,799
follow up with another

1255
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:41,890
question just get back

1256
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,339

want to do that now

1261
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:50,220
transition to pitch

1262
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:50,880
we're done with

1263
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:51,970
discovery getting into

1264
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:52,920
the pitch phase here

1265
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,900
once again this is

1266
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:54,720
heavily modeled after

1267
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,220
everything you've

1268
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:56,400
already seen in this

1269
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,710
part right here but

1270
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,960
the expert perspective

1271
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:01,259
this is one of those

1272
00:19:01,259 --> 00:19:01,859
things you guys are

1273
00:19:01,859 --> 00:19:02,359

00:19:02,359 --> 00:19:02,960
write out that's

1275
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:03,440
going to be very

1276
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:04,710
tailored to what you

1277
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,240
guys are doing but

1278
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:05,940
just a quick sample

1279
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:06,640
is like yeah based

1280
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,000
on where so we

1281
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,059
finished this up hey

1282
00:19:09,059 --> 00:19:09,779
just to recap what

1283
00:19:09,779 --> 00:19:10,960
I'm seeing here you

1284
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:11,390

1285
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:11,799
with your lead

1286
00:19:11,809 --> 00:19:13,220
generation for the

1287
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:13,750
better part of a

1288
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:14,480
year currently

1289
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,079
booking about like

five calls a month

1291
00:19:16,519 --> 00:19:17,200
and the goal is to

1292
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,680
get to at least 10

1293
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,599
calls a month so

1294
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:20,680
you'd be looking for

1295
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,380

is that a fair

1299
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,140
assessment yeah is

1300
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:26,940

1301
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:27,559

to where just explain

1314
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,130
where these thoughts

1315
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:54,759
are coming from I've

1316
00:19:54,759 --> 00:19:55,579

businesses if you

1318
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:56,859
haven't helped any

1319
00:19:56,869 --> 00:19:57,759
businesses yet I've

1320
00:19:57,769 --> 00:19:59,880
studied XYZ business

1321
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,440

00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,160
email marketing for

1323
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,849
econ brands I've

1324
00:20:02,859 --> 00:20:03,519
studied hundreds of

1325
00:20:03,529 --> 00:20:04,579
brands in their

1326
00:20:04,579 --> 00:20:05,140
email marketing

1327
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:06,779
strategy and here's

1328
00:20:06,779 --> 00:20:07,420
why most businesses

1329
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:08,220
struggle to generate

1330
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:10,400
consistent revenue from

1331
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,160

the common pitfalls or

1334
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:14,819
the common limiting

1335
00:20:14,819 --> 00:20:15,900
beliefs that you're

1336
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:16,539
dealing with here

1337
00:20:16,539 --> 00:20:17,619
insert the expert

1338
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:18,880
insight curious here

1339
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,339
your thoughts on

1340
00:20:19,339 --> 00:20:22,339
that so in this

1341
00:20:22,339 --> 00:20:23,299
pitch video right

1342
00:20:23,299 --> 00:20:24,140
here I gave you

1343
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:24,519
guys a couple

1344
00:20:24,549 --> 00:20:25,740
examples of what

1345
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:26,619
that looks like so

1346
00:20:26,619 --> 00:20:27,349
I'd recommend going to

1347
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:27,940
check that out if

1348
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:28,349
you're still a little

1349
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:29,000
bit confusing the

1350
00:20:29,009 --> 00:20:30,089
concept but once

1351
00:20:30,109 --> 00:20:31,299
again this is

1352
00:20:31,299 --> 00:20:31,779
something that

1353
00:20:31,779 --> 00:20:32,740
basically just takes

1354
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:33,460
this person it's

1355
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,480
basically a pre-pitch

1356
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,980
and gets them

1357
00:20:36,009 --> 00:20:37,619
thinking about the

1358
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:39,779
issue or gets them

1359
00:20:39,779 --> 00:20:40,599
over accommodating

1360
00:20:40,609 --> 00:20:42,099
limiting belief that

1361
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:42,980
they may have about

1362
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:44,859
your service so if

1363
00:20:44,859 --> 00:20:46,000
I'm here in terms of

1364
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,259
the mindset and

1365
00:20:47,259 --> 00:20:48,279
they're here I get

1366
00:20:48,279 --> 00:20:49,079
them to move closer

1367
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:50,000
to me so that way if

1368
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:50,720
they're thinking more

1369
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,450
so along the same

1370
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:53,339
lines that I am the

1371
00:20:53,339 --> 00:20:54,279
solution introduction

1372
00:20:54,279 --> 00:20:55,039
the pitch everything

1373
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:55,720
that comes after

1374
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:56,599
this is going to

1375
00:20:56,599 --> 00:20:57,259
hit a lot harder

1376
00:20:57,269 --> 00:20:58,720
where if they have

1377
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,960
some sort of core

1378
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:00,839
limiting belief that's

1379
00:21:00,839 --> 00:21:01,440
going to prevent them

1380
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,099
from thinking that

1381
00:21:02,099 --> 00:21:03,019
your service works

1382
00:21:03,019 --> 00:21:04,279
that's a big issue

1383
00:21:04,289 --> 00:21:06,079
obviously or if they

1384
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:06,740
think for whatever

1385
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:11,740
reason yeah they've

1386
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:12,980
seen common pitfalls

1387
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:13,819
or they haven't

1388
00:21:13,819 --> 00:21:14,440
they've struggled with

1389
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,059
this a lot in the

1390
00:21:15,059 --> 00:21:15,660
past and they think

1391
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:16,039
this is going to be

1392
00:21:16,039 --> 00:21:16,539
more of the same

1393
00:21:16,539 --> 00:21:17,339
like this part is

1394
00:21:17,339 --> 00:21:18,220
really really

1395
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:19,400
important now the

1396
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,140
solution introduction

1397
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:20,859
after that becomes

1398
00:21:20,859 --> 00:21:21,640
pretty important and

1399
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,000
this is going to be

1400
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,259
pretty brief right

1401
00:21:23,269 --> 00:21:25,180
awesome so the way

1402
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:25,960
that we solve for

1403
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:26,960
reason most people

1404
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:28,680
struggle or like you

1405
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,559
know all this stuff

1406
00:21:29,559 --> 00:21:30,759
is by high level

1407
00:21:30,759 --> 00:21:31,420
overview of what you

1408
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:32,339
do right so the

1409
00:21:32,339 --> 00:21:33,140
reason how we solve

1410
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:34,180
for a problem or

1411
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:34,910
the reason we help

1412
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:35,799
people or the way

1413
00:21:35,799 --> 00:21:36,319
that we help our

1414
00:21:36,319 --> 00:21:37,160
clients avoid this

1415
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,119
common pitfall is

1416
00:21:38,119 --> 00:21:40,140
by boom just like

1417
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:41,180
quick elevator pitch of

1418
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:42,259
what you do does not

1419
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:43,140
need to be long like

1420
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,019
we're talking in the

1421
00:21:44,019 --> 00:21:45,319
range of you know

1422
00:21:45,339 --> 00:21:46,539
10 to 30 seconds

1423
00:21:46,539 --> 00:21:47,440
here not a couple

1424
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:50,039
minutes right then

1425
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:50,809
we're going to get

1426
00:21:50,839 --> 00:21:51,380
into our proven

1427
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:52,519
delivery system and

1428
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:53,029
this is what it

1429
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:53,980
looks like and at

1430
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:54,579
this point we're

1431
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:54,920
going to want to

1432
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:55,759
screen share visual

1433
00:21:55,769 --> 00:21:56,880
representation of the

1434
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:58,079
system this is where

1435
00:21:58,079 --> 00:21:58,640
you can go to a

1436
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,759
diagram in your VSL

1437
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:01,119
a slide deck if you

1438
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:01,680
want to create one

1439
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,400
for this specifically

1440
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,619
so just to talk

1441
00:22:03,619 --> 00:22:04,200
about the visuals

1442
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:06,500
Daniel does a good

1443
00:22:06,509 --> 00:22:08,440
job for our sales

1444
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,220
team of giving us

1445
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:09,680
something that we

1446
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,220
can just screen

1447
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:11,359
share on these

1448
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:12,079
calls so we're not

1449
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:12,799
like reading off the

1450
00:22:12,839 --> 00:22:13,599
VSL and screen

1451
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:14,119
sharing through it

1452
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:14,700
but usually there's

1453
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:15,299
like a helpful

1454
00:22:15,309 --> 00:22:17,829
visual that we can

1455
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:19,039
go back to but if

1456
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:19,640
you don't have one

1457
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,369
in your VSL for

1458
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:21,039
whatever reason like

1459
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:21,839
if your VSL was

1460
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:23,759
all copy I would

1461
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:24,519
not recommend going

1462
00:22:24,519 --> 00:22:25,160
to the VSL and

1463
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:25,740
just reading the

1464
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:26,819
copy I'd recommend

1465
00:22:26,829 --> 00:22:28,500
making a visual for

1466
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,359
this and nowadays

1467
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:30,240
with AI I mean it's

1468
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:30,900
it's so stupid

1469
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:32,259
simple it of course

1470
00:22:32,269 --> 00:22:34,200
takes work but it

1471
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,099
is pretty straightforward

1472
00:22:35,099 --> 00:22:35,819
but you'd want to

1473
00:22:35,859 --> 00:22:37,319
have a diagram and

1474
00:22:37,319 --> 00:22:38,339
you know maybe from

1475
00:22:38,339 --> 00:22:39,259
your VSL maybe a

1476
00:22:39,259 --> 00:22:40,559
slide deck or maybe

1477
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:41,220
examples of your

1478
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:41,819
work but you want to

1479
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:42,900
have visual here one

1480
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:43,940
to ensure the

1481
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:44,859
prospect understands

1482
00:22:44,859 --> 00:22:45,420
the nature of your

1483
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:46,480
service the benefits

1484
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,619
because like this is

1485
00:22:47,619 --> 00:22:48,140
the part where it's

1486
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:49,079
like we're showing

1487
00:22:49,079 --> 00:22:50,849
them how we get

1488
00:22:50,859 --> 00:22:51,700
results we're showing

1489
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:52,519
them how the sausage

1490
00:22:52,519 --> 00:22:53,200
is made so if they

1491
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,000
don't understand this

1492
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,769
part here confused

1493
00:22:55,789 --> 00:22:57,359
prospects don't buy as

1494
00:22:57,359 --> 00:22:58,140
I mentioned in a couple

1495
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:59,380
previous videos and

1496
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:00,720
two if they can see

1497
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:03,529
something what you'll

1498
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:04,519
what you'll notice is

1499
00:23:04,519 --> 00:23:05,900
if I if I say the

1500
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:08,700
same thing just words

1501
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:09,559
just me talking to the

1502
00:23:09,559 --> 00:23:10,539
guy on zoom versus

1503
00:23:10,539 --> 00:23:11,559
if I say something

1504
00:23:11,559 --> 00:23:12,559
while screen sharing

1505
00:23:12,569 --> 00:23:15,160
something if I do

1506
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:16,680
the latter saying

1507
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:17,200
something while

1508
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:17,680
screen sharing

1509
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,319
something it usually

1510
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:19,000
generates more

1511
00:23:19,009 --> 00:23:20,269
questions which is a

1512
00:23:20,279 --> 00:23:21,619
good thing right this

1513
00:23:21,619 --> 00:23:22,220
is where we want to

1514
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:23,220
welcome questions I'll

1515
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:23,799
talk about that a

1516
00:23:23,799 --> 00:23:24,359
little bit more in a

1517
00:23:24,359 --> 00:23:25,500
second here but we

1518
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:25,930
want to make sure

1519
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:26,759
that there's absolute

1520
00:23:26,769 --> 00:23:28,099
clarity and you know

1521
00:23:28,099 --> 00:23:30,160
also excitement on how

1522
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:32,960
this unique mechanism

1523
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,119
that has three four

1524
00:23:34,119 --> 00:23:35,160
key components right

1525
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:35,960
so your three pillar

1526
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:36,920
pitch so at client

1527
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,660
ascension forever we've

1528
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:40,119
been using hey cool so

1529
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:40,500
the way that we

1530
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,039
actually get these

1531
00:23:41,049 --> 00:23:42,240
results is with the

1532
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:44,740
three C's and we'll

1533
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:45,400
break down what those

1534
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,740
three C's are coaching

1535
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:50,279
community content right

1536
00:23:50,279 --> 00:23:51,880
but and then we start

1537
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,960
with coaching we have

1538
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,319
a little written out

1539
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:55,319
thing for that we go

1540
00:23:55,319 --> 00:23:56,140
into community we have

1541
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:57,319
a little written out

1542
00:23:57,319 --> 00:23:58,099
thing for that we go

1543
00:23:58,099 --> 00:23:58,920
into content we have a

1544
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,539
little bit of written

1545
00:23:59,539 --> 00:24:00,319
out thing for that but

1546
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:01,019
it's basically like hey

1547
00:24:01,019 --> 00:24:01,819
this is what we do

1548
00:24:01,819 --> 00:24:02,500
which gives you this

1549
00:24:02,509 --> 00:24:04,359
benefit this is what we

1550
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:05,119
do that gives you this

1551
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:06,359
benefit this is what we

1552
00:24:06,359 --> 00:24:07,079
do that gives you this

1553
00:24:07,089 --> 00:24:09,019
benefit and yeah the

1554
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:09,880
system is specifically

1555
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:10,609
designed to get

1556
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:12,299
consistent results in

1557
00:24:12,309 --> 00:24:13,500
industry in time

1558
00:24:13,509 --> 00:24:15,269
frame what are your

1559
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:15,920
thoughts on one to

1560
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:16,940
three once again

1561
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:17,619
because we want to

1562
00:24:17,619 --> 00:24:18,299
welcome and generate

1563
00:24:18,309 --> 00:24:19,500
questions here that's

1564
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,799
why I'm asking what

1565
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:21,779
are your thoughts on

1566
00:24:21,779 --> 00:24:22,640
one to three as

1567
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,279
opposed to hey does

1568
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:23,880
one to three make

1569
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:25,220
sense so I did a

1570
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:25,720
little note here

1571
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,539
steps one two and

1572
00:24:26,539 --> 00:24:27,269
three can be a lot

1573
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:28,440
longer than what I

1574
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,319
just wrote out here

1575
00:24:29,319 --> 00:24:31,359
and if they are a lot

1576
00:24:31,369 --> 00:24:33,440
longer we can just

1577
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:34,400
add this check-in

1578
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,099
question as opposed

1579
00:24:35,099 --> 00:24:35,980
to just doing one

1580
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:36,839
check-in question

1581
00:24:36,839 --> 00:24:37,660
after one two and

1582
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:38,559
three we can just

1583
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:39,099
add in small

1584
00:24:39,099 --> 00:24:39,779
questions between

1585
00:24:39,779 --> 00:24:41,279
these steps but

1586
00:24:41,319 --> 00:24:42,039
because we want to

1587
00:24:42,039 --> 00:24:42,819
generate questions

1588
00:24:42,819 --> 00:24:43,519
ideally we want to

1589
00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:44,299
stay away from those

1590
00:24:44,299 --> 00:24:45,180
yes or no questions

1591
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:48,539
so for example what

1592
00:24:48,539 --> 00:24:49,299
are your questions on

1593
00:24:49,299 --> 00:24:52,039
X is better than any

1594
00:24:52,049 --> 00:24:53,900
questions on X here

1595
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:55,839
very small different

1596
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:58,319
difference but if I

1597
00:24:58,319 --> 00:24:59,000
ask what are your

1598
00:24:59,009 --> 00:25:00,269
questions somebody's

1599
00:25:00,279 --> 00:25:00,839
going to think they're

1600
00:25:00,839 --> 00:25:01,240
going to think of

1601
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,099
something you know

1602
00:25:03,109 --> 00:25:05,799
maybe I don't have

1603
00:25:05,799 --> 00:25:07,859
any that's fine

1604
00:25:07,859 --> 00:25:08,269
because they at

1605
00:25:08,279 --> 00:25:09,400
least tried to think

1606
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,130
of a question first

1607
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:11,039
where if you go into

1608
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:12,799
any questions on this

1609
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:14,059
make sense you're

1610
00:25:14,059 --> 00:25:14,569
going to go through a

1611
00:25:14,579 --> 00:25:15,200
lot of pitches where

1612
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:15,759
it feels like you're

1613
00:25:15,759 --> 00:25:16,400
just pitching to a

1614
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,420
brick wall where

1615
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:17,980
they're just like

1616
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:21,299
yep yep make sense

1617
00:25:21,299 --> 00:25:22,789
make sense and we've

1618
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:23,559
all had those sales

1619
00:25:23,559 --> 00:25:24,339
calls and they suck

1620
00:25:24,339 --> 00:25:25,019
and the reason why

1621
00:25:25,029 --> 00:25:27,140
they suck is because

1622
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:27,980
you're kind of just

1623
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:28,779
left in the dark it's

1624
00:25:28,779 --> 00:25:29,759
very difficult to gauge

1625
00:25:29,759 --> 00:25:30,519
where those prospects

1626
00:25:30,519 --> 00:25:32,319
are a lot of times

1627
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:33,220
there like I always

1628
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:34,079
recommend asking for

1629
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:35,240
the sale but with

1630
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,200
those calls where I'm

1631
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:36,980
doing a bad job and

1632
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:38,480
I'm just saying any

1633
00:25:38,549 --> 00:25:40,019
questions make sense

1634
00:25:40,019 --> 00:25:40,450
and they're just

1635
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:41,759
saying no questions

1636
00:25:41,769 --> 00:25:44,059
make sense I'm I'm

1637
00:25:44,059 --> 00:25:45,200
really just like I

1638
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:45,700
don't know this

1639
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:46,400
person may be

1640
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,440
disinterested or

1641
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,480
like I don't even

1642
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,279
know heading into the

1643
00:25:50,279 --> 00:25:51,480
asks there right so

1644
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,000
really important we

1645
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:52,730
generate questions at

1646
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:54,359
this point now next

1647
00:25:54,359 --> 00:25:55,059
part we're also going

1648
00:25:55,059 --> 00:25:55,700
to want a visual for

1649
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:56,859
this the immediate

1650
00:25:56,869 --> 00:25:58,130
roadmap and quick

1651
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,630
wins so going into

1652
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,440
the pitch outline

1653
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:02,299
basically here's a

1654
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:02,829
where we're at so

1655
00:26:02,839 --> 00:26:03,420
we had the proven

1656
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:04,680
delivery system for

1657
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:06,079
solving the issue

1658
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:07,299
here sell the next

1659
00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:08,180
step not the entire

1660
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:08,880
journey people don't

1661
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,799
buy big transformations

1662
00:26:09,799 --> 00:26:10,420
this can work in

1663
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:10,980
marketing they buy

1664
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:12,039
clear pass forward

1665
00:26:12,039 --> 00:26:13,730
the analogy I like to

1666
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:14,519
use if somebody was

1667
00:26:14,519 --> 00:26:15,700
trying to lose 100

1668
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,420
pounds and we just

1669
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:17,420
said yeah we can get

1670
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:18,440
you from 300 pounds

1671
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,819
to 200 pounds no

1672
00:26:19,829 --> 00:26:21,839
problem like the the

1673
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:22,720
cool case studies may

1674
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,339
get them on the call

1675
00:26:23,339 --> 00:26:24,519
and marketing but in

1676
00:26:24,519 --> 00:26:25,240
sales we want to show

1677
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:25,720
them how they're going

1678
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,299
to lose those first

1679
00:26:26,299 --> 00:26:27,380
10 pounds we're going

1680
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:28,619
to show them how we

1681
00:26:28,619 --> 00:26:29,579
track calories we're

1682
00:26:29,579 --> 00:26:30,160
going to show them

1683
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:30,940
what a beginning

1684
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:31,779
workout plan looks

1685
00:26:31,779 --> 00:26:32,299
like for somebody

1686
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:32,819
that hasn't worked

1687
00:26:32,819 --> 00:26:33,440
out in a while that

1688
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:33,869
doesn't get them

1689
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:34,599
injured right like we

1690
00:26:34,609 --> 00:26:36,539
want the quick wins

1691
00:26:36,569 --> 00:26:38,250
laid out which is

1692
00:26:38,259 --> 00:26:38,960
going to make make

1693
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:39,359
sure that they're

1694
00:26:39,369 --> 00:26:40,420
excited to get

1695
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:42,059
started and it's

1696
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:42,700
also going to reduce

1697
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:43,680
friction on them

1698
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,339
actually making that

1699
00:26:44,349 --> 00:26:45,279
decision to get

1700
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:47,200
started right so

1701
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,160
we're going to want

1702
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:48,980
to have a visual

1703
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:50,019
representation of this

1704
00:26:50,019 --> 00:26:50,940
as well so in

1705
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:51,500
terms of like most

1706
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:52,119
important place to

1707
00:26:52,119 --> 00:26:52,549
have a visual

1708
00:26:52,589 --> 00:26:54,519
representation of

1709
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:55,039
what we're doing

1710
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:56,279
here like if you

1711
00:26:56,279 --> 00:26:57,009
didn't have it in

1712
00:26:57,019 --> 00:26:57,700
your VSL for

1713
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:58,920
whatever reason and

1714
00:26:58,920 --> 00:26:59,519
I was making a

1715
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:00,359
slide deck or just

1716
00:27:00,359 --> 00:27:01,380
making visuals on a

1717
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:02,240
gambadoc to support

1718
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,440
this the proven

1719
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:05,380
delivery system and

1720
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:06,299
the immediate roadmap

1721
00:27:06,299 --> 00:27:07,029
and quick wins is

1722
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:07,700
where I'd focus my

1723
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:08,579
effort the next would

1724
00:27:08,579 --> 00:27:09,400
be like having like a

1725
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,160
pricing sheet that

1726
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:10,700
could you know just

1727
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:11,380
lay out and display

1728
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:12,160
the prices especially

1729
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:12,569
if there's some

1730
00:27:12,579 --> 00:27:13,599
nuances there but

1731
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:14,759
once again we want

1732
00:27:14,759 --> 00:27:15,190
to have a visual

1733
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:16,240
representation think

1734
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:16,819
roadmap with

1735
00:27:16,819 --> 00:27:18,240
checkpoints once

1736
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:18,650
again that are

1737
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:19,660
valuable because we

1738
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:20,140
want to showcase

1739
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:21,299
quick wins so it's

1740
00:27:21,299 --> 00:27:22,200
not just all boring

1741
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,140
shit I'll show you

1742
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:23,819
what this would look

1743
00:27:23,819 --> 00:27:24,400
like in a second

1744
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:25,539
think of a timeline

1745
00:27:25,539 --> 00:27:26,220
think of a flow

1746
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:26,940
chart here that

1747
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:27,500
highlights the

1748
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,259
first 30 60 90

1749
00:27:29,259 --> 00:27:30,569
days whatever it

1750
00:27:30,579 --> 00:27:31,200
doesn't have to be

1751
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,440
30 60 90 days guys

1752
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,559
by the way it's

1753
00:27:33,559 --> 00:27:34,420
it's essentially just

1754
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:35,339
mapping out whatever

1755
00:27:35,339 --> 00:27:36,599
the time to value

1756
00:27:36,599 --> 00:27:39,599
is with for your

1757
00:27:39,609 --> 00:27:40,799
service right

1758
00:27:40,809 --> 00:27:42,299
something like SEO

1759
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:43,619
may have a lot

1760
00:27:43,619 --> 00:27:44,579
longer of a time to

1761
00:27:44,589 --> 00:27:47,599
value than paid

1762
00:27:47,609 --> 00:27:49,660
ads right so I may

1763
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:51,119
do a 60 day roadmap

1764
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:51,920
for a paid ads

1765
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:52,799
offer I may do a

1766
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:53,640
six month roadmap

1767
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,240
for an SEO offer

1768
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,259
but I want to show

1769
00:27:56,259 --> 00:27:56,980
them what the time

1770
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:57,759
the value looks like

1771
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:58,599
what the path looks

1772
00:27:58,599 --> 00:27:59,690
like there and then

1773
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,200
also highlight the

1774
00:28:01,269 --> 00:28:02,500
quick wins so they're

1775
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:03,359
not just expecting

1776
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:05,000
pain and desperation

1777
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,640
in those 60 days or

1778
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,539
in those six months if

1779
00:28:07,539 --> 00:28:08,400
I was pitching SEO

1780
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:09,759
because if we do that

1781
00:28:09,759 --> 00:28:10,579
what's it going to do

1782
00:28:10,579 --> 00:28:11,559
it's going to make the

1783
00:28:11,559 --> 00:28:12,480
first 60 days seem

1784
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,559
like hell nobody

1785
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:14,400
wants to jump in the

1786
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,359
hell they're just not

1787
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:15,980
going to sign up

1788
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:17,720
right so what we do

1789
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:21,109
here is we set these

1790
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:22,359
expectations which is

1791
00:28:22,369 --> 00:28:23,839
helpful for not having

1792
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:25,160
bad expectations

1793
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,059
setting promises that

1794
00:28:26,059 --> 00:28:26,940
we can't deliver on

1795
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:27,759
and just making sure

1796
00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:28,339
we're clear on there

1797
00:28:28,339 --> 00:28:29,240
too because guys

1798
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:31,319
prospects are they're

1799
00:28:31,339 --> 00:28:32,430
pretty ridiculous

1800
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,079
sometimes with their

1801
00:28:33,089 --> 00:28:34,059
expectations so if we

1802
00:28:34,059 --> 00:28:35,099
don't set them they're

1803
00:28:35,099 --> 00:28:35,480
going to make their

1804
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,440
own expectations and

1805
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,420
trust me they're going

1806
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:37,920
to be pretty bad

1807
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:38,759
expectations for you

1808
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:39,119
they're going to be

1809
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:39,839
completely unrealistic

1810
00:28:39,839 --> 00:28:41,339
but we do this while

1811
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:42,240
also getting excited

1812
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:42,839
about what happens

1813
00:28:42,839 --> 00:28:44,420
next this is tailored

1814
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:46,279
to your offer slash

1815
00:28:46,289 --> 00:28:48,319
delivery so what I did

1816
00:28:48,319 --> 00:28:49,099
below as opposed to

1817
00:28:49,099 --> 00:28:49,829
like giving you guys

1818
00:28:49,839 --> 00:28:50,759
like sample

1819
00:28:50,759 --> 00:28:51,490
questions that you

1820
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:52,059
can kind of mess

1821
00:28:52,059 --> 00:28:52,490
with and change

1822
00:28:52,519 --> 00:28:54,380
with quickly I just

1823
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:55,690
wrote out something

1824
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,000
here and you can

1825
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:57,859
picture this with like

1826
00:28:57,859 --> 00:28:58,859
a roadmap that has

1827
00:28:58,859 --> 00:28:59,920
like little you know

1828
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:00,420
so it's like a

1829
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:01,079
roadmap and there's

1830
00:29:01,079 --> 00:29:02,420
like little graphics

1831
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:03,140
here like a tick

1832
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:03,819
going up that

1833
00:29:03,829 --> 00:29:04,720
highlights the win

1834
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,559
right because when I

1835
00:29:05,559 --> 00:29:06,279
highlight those quick

1836
00:29:06,279 --> 00:29:07,339
wins but what this

1837
00:29:07,339 --> 00:29:07,980
could look like so

1838
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:08,490
just picture I'm

1839
00:29:08,509 --> 00:29:10,140
saying this with a

1840
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:10,759
visual in front of

1841
00:29:10,759 --> 00:29:11,480
me hey so the

1842
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,079
starting point would

1843
00:29:12,079 --> 00:29:12,490
be the first

1844
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:13,789
onboarding call and

1845
00:29:13,799 --> 00:29:14,660
this is a for

1846
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:15,440
whatever reason I

1847
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,529
just did a YouTube

1848
00:29:16,539 --> 00:29:17,880
content creation offer

1849
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,569
for business owners hey

1850
00:29:19,579 --> 00:29:20,099
so the starting

1851
00:29:20,099 --> 00:29:20,700
point is on that

1852
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:21,430
first onboarding

1853
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,519
call which would

1854
00:29:22,519 --> 00:29:23,539
be to map out your

1855
00:29:23,539 --> 00:29:24,660
90 day content plan

1856
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:25,700
and schedule and

1857
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:26,319
typically we'll leave

1858
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:27,119
that very first call

1859
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:28,240
with 30 to 50 high

1860
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,400
level ideas for your

1861
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,319
weekly YouTube videos

1862
00:29:30,319 --> 00:29:31,339
and we'll turn around

1863
00:29:31,339 --> 00:29:32,240
and give you 20

1864
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,079
fleshed out creative

1865
00:29:33,079 --> 00:29:33,740
briefs from which

1866
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:36,720
you'll pick 12 in

1867
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:40,799
just 24 hours and

1868
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:41,819
that'll be enough for

1869
00:29:41,819 --> 00:29:42,500
three months doing

1870
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:43,539
one video a week

1871
00:29:43,539 --> 00:29:44,440
then we'll have

1872
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,119
another call and

1873
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:45,720
once again it's

1874
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,519
easier to kind of

1875
00:29:46,529 --> 00:29:47,819
bounce around and

1876
00:29:47,819 --> 00:29:48,500
not sound like you're

1877
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:49,230
over talking or

1878
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,019
doing like a crazy

1879
00:29:50,019 --> 00:29:50,799
run-on sentence when

1880
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:51,480
you have a visual

1881
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,039
because you can kind

1882
00:29:52,039 --> 00:29:52,859
of guide the cursor

1883
00:29:52,859 --> 00:29:53,980
and everything along

1884
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:54,759
with it then we'll

1885
00:29:54,759 --> 00:29:55,579
have another call to

1886
00:29:55,579 --> 00:29:56,079
make sure you're all

1887
00:29:56,079 --> 00:29:56,539
set up from a

1888
00:29:56,539 --> 00:29:57,119
recording standpoint

1889
00:29:57,119 --> 00:29:57,740
and we get the

1890
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:58,319
first session on

1891
00:29:58,329 --> 00:29:59,900
calendar ASAP by

1892
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:01,240
week two clients have

1893
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:01,799
their first video

1894
00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:02,680
film and we've

1895
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,109
edited it and

1896
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:04,119
published it by

1897
00:30:04,119 --> 00:30:05,460
week four after the

1898
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:06,180
first two videos are

1899
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:07,099
out we'll be able to

1900
00:30:07,099 --> 00:30:07,839
see what the initial

1901
00:30:07,849 --> 00:30:09,920
results look like so

1902
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,500
we can see what the

1903
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:11,339
initial audience looks

1904
00:30:11,339 --> 00:30:12,000
like so we'll start

1905
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,079
to build in CTAs to

1906
00:30:13,079 --> 00:30:14,349
each video by week

1907
00:30:14,359 --> 00:30:15,279
eight we should see

1908
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:15,799
over a hundred

1909
00:30:15,799 --> 00:30:16,599
percent subscriber

1910
00:30:16,599 --> 00:30:17,660
growth from week

1911
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:18,599
four and once

1912
00:30:18,599 --> 00:30:19,660
again like these

1913
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:20,819
are wins but I

1914
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:21,480
also don't need to

1915
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,210
over promise because

1916
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:22,720
think about it

1917
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,200
somebody who just

1918
00:30:23,210 --> 00:30:24,970
launched YouTube in

1919
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:25,960
the first you know

1920
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:26,799
two weeks they may

1921
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:27,960
have a hundred

1922
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:29,450
subscribers if I can

1923
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:30,220
get them to 200

1924
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:31,710
subscribers by week

1925
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:32,740
eight that's a hundred

1926
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:33,359
percent subscriber

1927
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:34,579
growth right like I

1928
00:30:34,579 --> 00:30:35,079
had my goal there

1929
00:30:35,079 --> 00:30:36,220
right by week eight

1930
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:36,819
we should see a hundred

1931
00:30:36,819 --> 00:30:37,420
percent subscriber

1932
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:37,980
growth from week

1933
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:38,980
four and most of

1934
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:39,559
our clients start to

1935
00:30:39,559 --> 00:30:40,339
see leads trickle in

1936
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:41,160
in the second month

1937
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,359
and third month so

1938
00:30:42,359 --> 00:30:43,450
by week 12 we

1939
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:43,890
should have closed

1940
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:44,619
our first client from

1941
00:30:44,619 --> 00:30:45,559
YouTube right and I

1942
00:30:45,559 --> 00:30:46,319
could have a nice

1943
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:47,180
graphic being like yeah

1944
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:48,200
cool like cash like

1945
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,359
right like these

1946
00:30:49,359 --> 00:30:50,240
things sound dumb in

1947
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:51,059
elementary but like

1948
00:30:51,059 --> 00:30:51,700
they really are

1949
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:53,279
important right and

1950
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:54,339
you guys can just hear

1951
00:30:54,339 --> 00:30:55,500
me talking about this

1952
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:56,279
and saying this you

1953
00:30:56,279 --> 00:30:57,009
can see how much more

1954
00:30:57,019 --> 00:30:58,740
valuable it would be if

1955
00:30:58,740 --> 00:30:59,579
I had a roadmap in

1956
00:30:59,579 --> 00:31:00,420
front of me which is

1957
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:01,079
basically just proving

1958
00:31:01,079 --> 00:31:02,569
my point right so

1959
00:31:02,589 --> 00:31:04,380
after that we've

1960
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:05,039
basically given them

1961
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:05,799
the whole pitch guys

1962
00:31:05,809 --> 00:31:07,480
right we've talked

1963
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,400
about how we deliver

1964
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:09,660
results we've talked

1965
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:10,920
about what the next

1966
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,660
30 60 90 days is

1967
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:13,539
basically like we've

1968
00:31:13,539 --> 00:31:14,269
laid out what the time

1969
00:31:14,299 --> 00:31:15,519
the value is here and

1970
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:16,079
then the process

1971
00:31:16,089 --> 00:31:17,240
confirmation which

1972
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:17,920
is essentially just

1973
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:18,640
say hey before we go

1974
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,200
any further how you

1975
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:19,630
feeling about the

1976
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,480
process specifically

1977
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:23,009
any questions in the

1978
00:31:23,019 --> 00:31:23,619
process that I can

1979
00:31:23,619 --> 00:31:25,500
help with once again

1980
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,920
going back into this

1981
00:31:26,930 --> 00:31:30,140
part here make sure

1982
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:30,569
they're clear about

1983
00:31:30,599 --> 00:31:31,440
the process confused

1984
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:32,599
prospects do not buy

1985
00:31:32,609 --> 00:31:34,079
allow space for dumb

1986
00:31:34,089 --> 00:31:35,349
questions I expand on

1987
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:37,019
all that in this video

1988
00:31:37,019 --> 00:31:38,359
but super important

1989
00:31:38,359 --> 00:31:39,079
because we want to

1990
00:31:39,079 --> 00:31:40,160
segment this out if we

1991
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,160
if we just said this

1992
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,430
and then went right

1993
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,420
into value stacking

1994
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:45,859
and closing then

1995
00:31:45,859 --> 00:31:46,819
they may have one or

1996
00:31:46,819 --> 00:31:47,599
two dumb questions

1997
00:31:47,599 --> 00:31:48,559
about the process and

1998
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:49,440
once again I just

1999
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,059
keep using the term

2000
00:31:50,059 --> 00:31:50,779
dumb questions they're

2001
00:31:50,779 --> 00:31:51,259
not really dumb

2002
00:31:51,259 --> 00:31:52,039
questions they seem

2003
00:31:52,039 --> 00:31:53,039
dumb to us but they

2004
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:54,180
are you know

2005
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:55,420
obviously gnawing at

2006
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:56,079
the prospect we want

2007
00:31:56,079 --> 00:31:56,700
to get those out of

2008
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:57,230
the way so they have

2009
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:57,839
a clear head they

2010
00:31:57,839 --> 00:31:58,180
have a clear

2011
00:31:58,190 --> 00:31:59,420
understanding going

2012
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:00,880
into what I call

2013
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:01,559
the closing phase

2014
00:32:01,559 --> 00:32:02,480
here so we're done

2015
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,380
with that we go into

2016
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:04,200
the value stacking

2017
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,559
aspect which for most

2018
00:32:05,559 --> 00:32:06,140
you guys if you

2019
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:06,859
don't already have

2020
00:32:06,859 --> 00:32:07,480
something that can

2021
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:09,420
achieve this function

2022
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,420
and I talk about

2023
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:11,240
this in video four

2024
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,400
exactly what this is

2025
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,490
why it works so

2026
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:14,279
darn well how to

2027
00:32:14,279 --> 00:32:15,039
apply it on a call

2028
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:15,720
if you guys don't

2029
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:16,230
have something set

2030
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:16,920
up I would just

2031
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:17,599
recommend building an

2032
00:32:17,599 --> 00:32:18,740
ROI calculator I

2033
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:19,170
think it's the easiest

2034
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,279
way to do it and you

2035
00:32:21,299 --> 00:32:22,279
can also use

2036
00:32:22,279 --> 00:32:23,059
quantifiable case

2037
00:32:23,059 --> 00:32:24,180
studies the best bet

2038
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:24,779
is when you can

2039
00:32:24,779 --> 00:32:25,660
supplement these two

2040
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:27,430
right ROI calculator

2041
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,559
quantifiable case

2042
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:29,420
studies some of the

2043
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:30,089
other stuff that I

2044
00:32:30,119 --> 00:32:32,730
talked about in this

2045
00:32:32,769 --> 00:32:34,029
video here are

2046
00:32:34,049 --> 00:32:37,039
essentially price

2047
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:38,019
anchoring offer

2048
00:32:38,029 --> 00:32:39,000
stacking once again

2049
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:39,680
this would be if you

2050
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,720
don't have and you

2051
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,200
guys probably aren't

2052
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:41,599
going to go through

2053
00:32:41,599 --> 00:32:42,440
this with Daniel's

2054
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,240
content like he's so

2055
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,119
good at making offers

2056
00:32:44,119 --> 00:32:45,240
these these are these

2057
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:45,859
probably work better

2058
00:32:45,859 --> 00:32:46,779
for other offers than

2059
00:32:46,779 --> 00:32:47,160
what you guys are

2060
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:47,680
running so I wouldn't

2061
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,259
worry about it too

2062
00:32:48,259 --> 00:32:50,079
much anyways we

2063
00:32:50,089 --> 00:32:52,880
showcase the ROI as

2064
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:53,799
we talked about here

2065
00:32:53,809 --> 00:32:55,940
you know we have

2066
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:56,779
presented the evidence

2067
00:32:56,779 --> 00:32:57,619
now we ask them if

2068
00:32:57,619 --> 00:32:58,119
they believe that

2069
00:32:58,119 --> 00:32:58,500
they're going to get

2070
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,220
those results which

2071
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:01,119
is in this next

2072
00:33:01,119 --> 00:33:02,039
section here and

2073
00:33:02,039 --> 00:33:02,470
based on everything

2074
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:03,059
you're seeing here

2075
00:33:03,059 --> 00:33:03,759
do you see any

2076
00:33:03,759 --> 00:33:04,240
reason why the

2077
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:04,960
solution wouldn't get

2078
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,680
you to blank goal

2079
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,339
and then obviously we

2080
00:33:08,339 --> 00:33:08,869
may need to go in

2081
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:09,150
the handling

2082
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,640
objections at this

2083
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,099
point but if not if

2084
00:33:12,099 --> 00:33:13,099
it's a certain yes

2085
00:33:13,109 --> 00:33:14,599
like I talked about

2086
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:18,799
in here if it's a

2087
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:20,619
certain yes lay out

2088
00:33:20,619 --> 00:33:21,500
the onboarding steps

2089
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:22,500
and ask for the sale

2090
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,380
a little bit more

2091
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:24,279
hashed out here

2092
00:33:24,289 --> 00:33:26,319
investment presentation

2093
00:33:26,329 --> 00:33:29,279
basically just going

2094
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:29,880
over the investment

2095
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,240
itself and this is you

2096
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:31,650
know if you have

2097
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:32,380
multiple packages

2098
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:33,079
recommend one

2099
00:33:33,089 --> 00:33:34,059
specifically so they're

2100
00:33:34,059 --> 00:33:34,789
not just getting like

2101
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:36,289
you know analysis by

2102
00:33:36,299 --> 00:33:37,099
paralysis so they're

2103
00:33:37,099 --> 00:33:38,140
not like thinking too

2104
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:38,980
much in between the

2105
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:40,420
packages and that

2106
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:41,359
within itself delays

2107
00:33:41,359 --> 00:33:42,089
them from being able

2108
00:33:42,119 --> 00:33:42,900
to close in the call

2109
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:46,480
and if you have if

2110
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,240
you have a nuanced

2111
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,960
pricing structure and

2112
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:49,859
even if you don't I

2113
00:33:49,859 --> 00:33:51,099
think it's helpful to

2114
00:33:51,099 --> 00:33:52,299
have like a visual

2115
00:33:52,299 --> 00:33:53,779
place where you guys

2116
00:33:53,779 --> 00:33:55,039
can present the

2117
00:33:55,049 --> 00:33:55,880
investment so they

2118
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,369
can see it in writing

2119
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:58,140
and they can

2120
00:33:58,140 --> 00:33:59,279
understand that but

2121
00:33:59,289 --> 00:34:00,940
this part like

2122
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:01,920
investment presentation

2123
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,000
and next steps and

2124
00:34:03,009 --> 00:34:04,720
first ask these with

2125
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:05,900
clients often get the

2126
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:08,420
most questions and

2127
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:08,849
they don't really

2128
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:09,369
need to they're

2129
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:09,960
really straightforward

2130
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:10,820
like the whole goal

2131
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:12,090
here for investment

2132
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:13,039
presentation and next

2133
00:34:13,039 --> 00:34:13,840
steps and first ask

2134
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,559
is just have a cool

2135
00:34:15,559 --> 00:34:16,219
calm and collected

2136
00:34:16,219 --> 00:34:17,719
tonality and don't

2137
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:19,019
overthink it I get

2138
00:34:19,019 --> 00:34:19,619
it's nervous when

2139
00:34:19,619 --> 00:34:20,260
you're asking somebody

2140
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:20,880
to give you money

2141
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,820
but you seriously

2142
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:23,760
just gotta you know

2143
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,679
if you haven't been

2144
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:25,340
there before fake

2145
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:25,869
it till you make it

2146
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:26,480
and just act like you

2147
00:34:26,489 --> 00:34:27,920
have right but

2148
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,219
here's here's exactly

2149
00:34:29,219 --> 00:34:29,579
what it would look

2150
00:34:29,579 --> 00:34:30,659
like hey cool so

2151
00:34:30,659 --> 00:34:31,320
based on where you're

2152
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,039
at I'd recommend the

2153
00:34:32,039 --> 00:34:32,699
gold package you get

2154
00:34:32,699 --> 00:34:33,380
10 calls a month

2155
00:34:33,389 --> 00:34:34,519
consistently and

2156
00:34:34,519 --> 00:34:35,050
the investment for

2157
00:34:35,059 --> 00:34:35,579
that would be just

2158
00:34:35,579 --> 00:34:36,340
five thousand dollars

2159
00:34:36,349 --> 00:34:40,300
now I talked about

2160
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:41,340
kind of the the

2161
00:34:41,349 --> 00:34:43,780
silence here say the

2162
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:44,579
number and pause I

2163
00:34:44,579 --> 00:34:45,179
like to pause and

2164
00:34:45,179 --> 00:34:45,800
just add a little bit

2165
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:46,599
of silence once again

2166
00:34:46,599 --> 00:34:47,159
you have to be

2167
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:47,880
comfortable and they

2168
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:48,699
need to see you being

2169
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:49,969
comfortable sitting in

2170
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:50,699
that silence but I

2171
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:51,130
don't think you need

2172
00:34:51,139 --> 00:34:51,980
to stay silent forever

2173
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:54,940
if they are silent

2174
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:55,840
for a little bit too

2175
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:56,480
long I would just

2176
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,280
ask him like once

2177
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:57,710
again like we don't

2178
00:34:57,719 --> 00:34:58,699
want to butt in and

2179
00:34:58,699 --> 00:35:00,000
act too finicky I

2180
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:00,360
would just ask him

2181
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,559
like hey cool

2182
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:04,699
curious man this

2183
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:06,579
this align with what

2184
00:35:06,579 --> 00:35:07,239
you're able to invest

2185
00:35:07,239 --> 00:35:07,960
in order to get to

2186
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:13,039
this goal and if I

2187
00:35:13,039 --> 00:35:13,570
need to sit in a

2188
00:35:13,579 --> 00:35:14,059
little bit more

2189
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:16,219
silence that's

2190
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:17,280
perfectly fine after

2191
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,179
that point like I

2192
00:35:18,179 --> 00:35:18,900
don't recommend a

2193
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:19,579
ton of silence after

2194
00:35:19,579 --> 00:35:20,559
dropping the price but

2195
00:35:20,559 --> 00:35:21,760
if you ask a question

2196
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,619
like that afterwards

2197
00:35:22,619 --> 00:35:24,300
and they're still

2198
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:25,239
silent it's usually

2199
00:35:25,239 --> 00:35:25,670
because they're

2200
00:35:25,679 --> 00:35:26,159
thinking of something

2201
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:26,820
at that point I

2202
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:27,460
would just be silent

2203
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:27,820
and let them

2204
00:35:27,829 --> 00:35:29,440
respond but all

2205
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,260
goes well cool got

2206
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:32,400
it makes sense

2207
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,400
like sometimes

2208
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,480
it's pretty sick

2209
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:34,909
they'll just be like

2210
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:35,400
yeah dude I'm ready

2211
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,460
to get started and

2212
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:37,360
I just lay out the

2213
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,800
next steps and get

2214
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:39,800
them signed up but

2215
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:40,599
other times just like

2216
00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:41,900
cool yeah so don't

2217
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:42,679
expect after you say

2218
00:35:42,679 --> 00:35:43,110
the price that

2219
00:35:43,139 --> 00:35:43,639
somebody's gonna be

2220
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:45,329
like I'm in or

2221
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:46,539
I'm out a lot of

2222
00:35:46,539 --> 00:35:47,300
times just like okay

2223
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:48,219
yeah makes sense like

2224
00:35:48,219 --> 00:35:49,099
it's not a definitive

2225
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:50,739
answer so we need to

2226
00:35:50,739 --> 00:35:51,619
know exactly what to

2227
00:35:51,619 --> 00:35:52,710
do after that which

2228
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:53,449
is plainly lay out

2229
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,840
the next steps after

2230
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:55,500
they process the

2231
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:56,219
investment so there's

2232
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:56,860
less fear of the

2233
00:35:56,869 --> 00:35:58,199
unknown so in terms of

2234
00:35:58,199 --> 00:35:59,139
next steps this is

2235
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:00,639
like up here

2236
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:01,579
this is like

2237
00:36:01,579 --> 00:36:02,519
on board this is

2238
00:36:02,519 --> 00:36:03,519
more so like what

2239
00:36:03,519 --> 00:36:05,019
the actual relationship

2240
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:06,570
looks like 30 69

2241
00:36:06,579 --> 00:36:07,920
days at 90 days in

2242
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,179
what the time the

2243
00:36:09,179 --> 00:36:10,320
value looks like the

2244
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:10,980
next steps here are

2245
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:11,380
more so the

2246
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:12,110
onboarding steps

2247
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:13,099
themselves and you

2248
00:36:13,099 --> 00:36:13,599
still want to make

2249
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:14,440
that seem valuable

2250
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,400
but it's like what

2251
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,059
happens immediately

2252
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:17,659
after so it doesn't

2253
00:36:17,659 --> 00:36:18,739
seem weird that

2254
00:36:18,739 --> 00:36:19,469
you're asking for the

2255
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,570
sale on the call

2256
00:36:20,579 --> 00:36:21,219
because once again

2257
00:36:21,219 --> 00:36:21,980
this is optimized to

2258
00:36:21,989 --> 00:36:23,000
collect cash on the

2259
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,119
call then plainly ask

2260
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:24,840
for the sale ready to

2261
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,639
get started once again

2262
00:36:25,639 --> 00:36:26,239
that's another thing

2263
00:36:26,239 --> 00:36:26,969
people ask me a lot

2264
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:27,460
like hey what do

2265
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:28,719
you say in order

2266
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:29,519
to close them I'm

2267
00:36:29,519 --> 00:36:29,789
like what do you

2268
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:30,599
mean like what like

2269
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:30,980
what do you actually

2270
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,039
say in order to get

2271
00:36:32,039 --> 00:36:32,469
them to give you the

2272
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,280
money and they're

2273
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,079
expecting like some

2274
00:36:34,090 --> 00:36:36,360
fancy like real

2275
00:36:36,369 --> 00:36:38,000
smooth suave smooth

2276
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:39,400
operator line it's not

2277
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,489
that right you do all

2278
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,320
this process correctly

2279
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,219
it's just hey ready to

2280
00:36:42,219 --> 00:36:44,429
get started and your

2281
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,940
tone should reflect that

2282
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:46,719
you're expecting a

2283
00:36:46,739 --> 00:36:48,760
yes all right fake

2284
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:49,539
till you make it but

2285
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:50,460
between us you

2286
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:51,000
shouldn't be surprised

2287
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:51,579
at all if you don't

2288
00:36:51,579 --> 00:36:52,139
and that's why we have

2289
00:36:52,139 --> 00:36:52,519
the objection

2290
00:36:52,519 --> 00:36:53,739
handling content but

2291
00:36:53,739 --> 00:36:54,539
what this could look

2292
00:36:54,539 --> 00:36:55,920
like in reality cool

2293
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,539
so what happens is

2294
00:36:57,539 --> 00:36:58,070
you'll process the

2295
00:36:58,079 --> 00:36:58,639
investment here with

2296
00:36:58,639 --> 00:37:00,079
me so our team can

2297
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:00,639
get to work right

2298
00:37:00,639 --> 00:37:01,519
away once that's

2299
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:02,940
done the onboarding

2300
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:03,760
steps trigger right

2301
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,000
away so you'll

2302
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:06,059
receive a link to

2303
00:37:06,059 --> 00:37:06,760
book an onboarding

2304
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,340
call plus the

2305
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:08,039
onboarding form and

2306
00:37:08,039 --> 00:37:08,559
your agreement the

2307
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:09,239
outlines we've talked

2308
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:11,079
about today got it

2309
00:37:11,079 --> 00:37:11,980
cool makes sense

2310
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:12,820
awesome man ready to

2311
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:14,320
get started yep

2312
00:37:14,349 --> 00:37:15,820
awesome then I would

2313
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:17,019
take a stripe link I

2314
00:37:17,019 --> 00:37:17,719
would drop it in the

2315
00:37:17,719 --> 00:37:18,809
chat a lot of people

2316
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:19,420
ask about that as

2317
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:20,840
well I don't love the

2318
00:37:20,849 --> 00:37:22,099
method of taking

2319
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:25,510
taking credit card

2320
00:37:25,519 --> 00:37:26,300
numbers I feel like

2321
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:26,960
that almost just

2322
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:27,619
creates unnecessary

2323
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:29,300
friction I've done it

2324
00:37:29,309 --> 00:37:31,239
before right I feel

2325
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:31,760
like that was just

2326
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,639
like the old Russell

2327
00:37:32,639 --> 00:37:33,280
Brunson way of doing

2328
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,320
it but somebody says

2329
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,480
yes that that cool

2330
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,320
man let me grab that

2331
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,039
stripe link for you

2332
00:37:37,039 --> 00:37:38,400
I'll send it over and

2333
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,670
like I mentioned as

2334
00:37:39,679 --> 00:37:40,440
soon as that's paid

2335
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,059
it'll trigger the

2336
00:37:41,059 --> 00:37:41,860
onboarding step so

2337
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:42,539
you'll get an email

2338
00:37:42,539 --> 00:37:43,599
that'll have the

2339
00:37:43,610 --> 00:37:45,039
onboarding call link

2340
00:37:45,039 --> 00:37:46,179
onboarding form and

2341
00:37:46,179 --> 00:37:46,610
an agreement that

2342
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:47,280
outlines everything that

2343
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,000
we talked about just

2344
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:49,760
drop that in the chat

2345
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:50,420
are you seeing it

2346
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:52,059
cool yeah and I'll

2347
00:37:52,059 --> 00:37:52,659
stay on with you to

2348
00:37:52,659 --> 00:37:53,070
make sure everything

2349
00:37:53,079 --> 00:37:53,860
goes through correctly

2350
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:56,440
on our end then you

2351
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,679
just wait right and a

2352
00:37:57,679 --> 00:37:58,260
lot of people also

2353
00:37:58,260 --> 00:37:59,059
over complicate this

2354
00:37:59,059 --> 00:37:59,619
hey what do you do

2355
00:37:59,619 --> 00:38:00,119
while they're paying

2356
00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:02,210
like it's kind of

2357
00:38:02,219 --> 00:38:03,199
like rapport be

2358
00:38:03,199 --> 00:38:03,900
natural don't be

2359
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:07,579
weird just just let

2360
00:38:07,579 --> 00:38:08,849

00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:21,679
