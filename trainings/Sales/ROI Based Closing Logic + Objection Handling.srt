1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:00,970
What's going on guys pumped for

2
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:02,100
this video because it's going to

3
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:03,339
be an absolute game changer to

4
00:00:03,339 --> 00:00:03,459
help

5
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:04,690
you guys increase your close rate

6
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:05,849
especially for those people who

7
00:00:05,849 --> 00:00:06,960
feel like the discovery is going

8
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:08,410
well the pitch is going well but

9
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:09,710
we just can't get somebody to

10
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:10,919
commit on the call i can't

11
00:00:10,919 --> 00:00:11,320
overstate

12
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,160
its importance especially in b2b

13
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:14,720
sales which is why even though a

14
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,160
lot of this is baked into the

15
00:00:16,269 --> 00:00:17,699
script with the roi based closing

16
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:19,129
logic part i want to make a whole

17
00:00:19,129 --> 00:00:20,420
video dedicated to it so you

18
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:22,120
guys know exactly how to present

19
00:00:22,129 --> 00:00:23,730
on a call to the point where you

20
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:25,359
basically can't mess it up and

21
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:25,449
then

22
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:26,829
with the objection handling that's

23
00:00:26,829 --> 00:00:27,879
where we clean up any of those

24
00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:29,559
remaining concerns which listen

25
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:30,870
guys it's unavoidable there's

26
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:32,350
going to be objections that's part

27
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:33,259
of the game if there

28
00:00:33,369 --> 00:00:34,979
weren't we would just have a vsl

29
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,789
and a checkout page but there's a

30
00:00:36,789 --> 00:00:38,500
reason why people talk about

31
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:39,789
this so much because it genuinely

32
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:41,070
is important the good thing is i'm

33
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:42,420
going to teach you guys how to

34
00:00:42,539 --> 00:00:44,240
handle objections and understand

35
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,880
it from first principles so you

36
00:00:45,929 --> 00:00:47,439
don't you don't have to write

37
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:49,880
out or memorize 50 60 100

38
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,579
different canned objection

39
00:00:51,579 --> 00:00:53,409
responses that don't work it's

40
00:00:53,409 --> 00:00:54,539
going to teach you

41
00:00:54,649 --> 00:00:56,509
guys the framework to handle any

42
00:00:56,509 --> 00:00:58,539
objection because there's only a

43
00:00:58,539 --> 00:01:00,299
select few of real objections but

44
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:01,240
they're framed a bunch of

45
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,369
different ways if you just use

46
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:03,649
canned comebacks they don't work

47
00:01:03,649 --> 00:01:04,150
that well

48
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,840
if you understand the principles

49
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,400
behind it regardless of how the

50
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,959
prospect phrases it you're not

51
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:09,299
going to be

52
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:10,650
two-faced and it's going to take

53
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:12,010
reps like anything else but keep

54
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:13,349
coming back to this guide and i

55
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:13,719
promise

56
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,189
you you guys will get way way

57
00:01:15,189 --> 00:01:16,930
better at objection handling so

58
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:18,579
let's just get into it i started

59
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:19,239
off with just

60
00:01:19,349 --> 00:01:20,230
quick intro when selling to

61
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:21,519
business owners they're only going

62
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:22,640
to buy because they think the

63
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,609
service will make them more money

64
00:01:24,609 --> 00:01:26,579
so showcasing roi to a prospect on

65
00:01:26,579 --> 00:01:28,159
the call is crucial for getting

66
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,519
the prospect to buy on the call

67
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:31,120
pretty straightforward that said

68
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,579
most of the time there will be

69
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:33,079
objections

70
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,500
but don't panic we're going to

71
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,040
show you how to solve those two so

72
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,599
let's just talk about why using

73
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,239
roi-based closing logic works in

74
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:40,879
general it's because there's two

75
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:42,920
types of persuasion right and it's

76
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:43,849
going to help most with the

77
00:01:43,849 --> 00:01:45,090
logical persuasion specifically

78
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:46,379
the logical persuasion helps the

79
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:46,680
prospect

80
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,109
justify the decision hey this

81
00:01:48,109 --> 00:01:49,670
makes sense it's based on numbers

82
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,599
it's based on what type of return

83
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,560
am i going to see it's based on

84
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,480
comparison hey you guys are

85
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,640
currently spending this much when

86
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:54,920
you could

87
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:56,269
be spending this much or you guys

88
00:01:56,269 --> 00:01:57,469
are only doing this amount of

89
00:01:57,469 --> 00:01:58,840
outreach when you could be doing

90
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,040
this

91
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:00,739
amount of outreach and then facts

92
00:02:00,739 --> 00:02:02,180
all right so that can come in a

93
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:04,000
bunch of different forms but it's

94
00:02:04,109 --> 00:02:05,159
pretty hard to argue with facts

95
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:06,260
right then there's going to be

96
00:02:06,269 --> 00:02:08,159
emotional persuasion and this is

97
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:08,319
going to

98
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:10,240
make your prospect want to act

99
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:11,860
this is based on pain fomo

100
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:14,500
opportunity costs relief trust

101
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,430
pain hey if you

102
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:17,680
guys let the situation continue on

103
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,879
for another six months how's that

104
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:19,979
going to impact the business

105
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,560
fomo hey this is a strategy every

106
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,699
big company in your space is using

107
00:02:24,699 --> 00:02:26,439
how much money do you think

108
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,090
you're leaving on the table if you

109
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:29,400
guys don't try your hand at

110
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,080
content opportunity costs hey

111
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:31,460
right

112
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,090
now your guys churn rate is 30 if

113
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:34,400
you guys don't get that down in

114
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,979
the next three months like if you

115
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:37,300
could get it down to 10 and you

116
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,590
decide not to by using something

117
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:39,919
like this how much money are you

118
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:41,129
leaving on the table relief hey

119
00:02:41,129 --> 00:02:42,259
what would you look like what

120
00:02:42,259 --> 00:02:43,379
would your life look like if we

121
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:43,699
took

122
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:45,259
this much work off your plate so

123
00:02:45,259 --> 00:02:46,629
you guys could just focus on

124
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:48,099
closing calls as opposed to

125
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:48,479
generating

126
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,469
no leads trust that's going to

127
00:02:49,539 --> 00:02:50,509
come in a number of different

128
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,860
forms but obviously there needs to

129
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:52,000
be

130
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:53,439
trust in order for somebody to

131
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:54,750
check out and pay on the call

132
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,539
which is what we're optimizing for

133
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:57,389
whenever we're going through the

134
00:02:57,409 --> 00:02:59,099
sales training in general you're

135
00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:00,620
going to get the close when you

136
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:02,430
combine both so that they can one

137
00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:04,340
justify the decision and two want

138
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:06,219
to do it right now which are two

139
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:08,409
distinct things right like i can

140
00:03:08,409 --> 00:03:10,419
know that i should go to the gym

141
00:03:10,419 --> 00:03:12,479
but a lot of times if i don't want

142
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:12,610
to

143
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:13,969
go to the gym i'm just not going

144
00:03:13,969 --> 00:03:15,610
to do it now 10 of the people will

145
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:17,180
come to the call already wanting

146
00:03:17,219 --> 00:03:18,439
to act those are the lay downs

147
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:19,919
those are the layups whatever you

148
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:21,340
want to call them as long as this

149
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:22,490
logically makes sense to them

150
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:23,780
those types of people will buy but

151
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:25,710
if you're shooting for a 30 40

152
00:03:25,729 --> 00:03:26,340
close

153
00:03:26,449 --> 00:03:27,819
rate wherever you guys need to be

154
00:03:27,819 --> 00:03:29,229
at and cool thing is we're going

155
00:03:29,229 --> 00:03:30,560
to help you guys track and know

156
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:30,659
your

157
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,360
numbers so you're going to be able

158
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,740
to see okay if my show rate is

159
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:35,139
this my close rate is this my

160
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,360
average cash collected is this you

161
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,439
guys are going to be able to make

162
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:38,710
your own solid targets for your

163
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:40,719
close rate the other 20 to 30

164
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:42,460
percent in this instance you're

165
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:44,680
going to need a close and they

166
00:03:44,789 --> 00:03:46,479
will need the emotional persuasion

167
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:48,229
along with the justification once

168
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:49,680
again like it's one thing to

169
00:03:49,789 --> 00:03:50,990
think yeah i should do this it's

170
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:52,409
another thing entirely to think i

171
00:03:52,409 --> 00:03:53,860
should do this and i also want

172
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,300
to do this right now which like i

173
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,689
said we're going to have to use

174
00:03:56,689 --> 00:03:58,360
some of this and once again we're

175
00:03:58,469 --> 00:03:59,629
going to get to that in the latter

176
00:03:59,629 --> 00:04:00,909
half of the video now some people

177
00:04:00,909 --> 00:04:02,330
are more emotional buyers some

178
00:04:02,449 --> 00:04:03,330
people are more logical buyers

179
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:04,349
when we're selling the business

180
00:04:04,349 --> 00:04:06,659
owners though even the business

181
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:06,939
owners

182
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:08,520
that are more emotional buyers

183
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:10,030
want to seem like they're more

184
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:11,800
logical buyers just because for

185
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:13,280
whatever reason they think it's

186
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,539
going to make them seem more

187
00:04:14,539 --> 00:04:16,100
competent but what that means is

188
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:16,600
if i'm

189
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,040
selling to emotional and logical

190
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,310
buyers and the logical buyers

191
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:20,600
really do need to see the roi

192
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:23,230
and the emotional buyers want to

193
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:25,870
act like they are logical buyers

194
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:28,689
in either case showcasing the roi

195
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,199
is going to help them close the

196
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:31,759
deal right it could just be a gut

197
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,529
feeling that they're operating off

198
00:04:33,529 --> 00:04:33,660
of

199
00:04:33,699 --> 00:04:35,110
it could be general trust but

200
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:36,439
you'll start to notice you

201
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:38,240
showcase that and they're like oh

202
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,220
okay cool

203
00:04:39,329 --> 00:04:41,019
like the mr you know analytical

204
00:04:41,019 --> 00:04:42,959
business owner who's really just

205
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:44,819
making decisions emotionally

206
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,420
if he sees that his emotions are

207
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,019
going to sway in our favor right

208
00:04:48,019 --> 00:04:49,660
and for the sake of closing a deal

209
00:04:49,699 --> 00:04:51,240
on the call it's super important

210
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,730
to show the numbers because if

211
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:54,269
you've ever heard we need to run

212
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:54,680
the numbers

213
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:56,579
or do our due diligence in what

214
00:04:56,579 --> 00:04:58,509
scenario would we be better off

215
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:00,740
with them doing it off the call as

216
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,959
opposed to live on the call right

217
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:05,180
there with us almost never right

218
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,149
and even if somebody says like

219
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,149
hey we need to run the numbers we

220
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,259
need to do the diligence after

221
00:05:09,259 --> 00:05:10,600
seeing this you can say hey mr

222
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,629
prospect here's here's my concern

223
00:05:12,629 --> 00:05:14,420
if you don't mind if i share some

224
00:05:14,449 --> 00:05:16,079
thoughts yeah go ahead dan

225
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,740
i've seen this go well and i've

226
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,480
seen this go poorly and usually

227
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,329
when it goes poorly is when i'm

228
00:05:22,329 --> 00:05:22,759
not in

229
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,560
the room when that conversation is

230
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,290
happening because obviously you

231
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:27,939
guys are experts at your service

232
00:05:27,939 --> 00:05:28,279
i'm an

233
00:05:28,389 --> 00:05:29,689
expert at mine i know what type of

234
00:05:29,689 --> 00:05:31,209
numbers we're seeing on average so

235
00:05:31,209 --> 00:05:32,439
i'll be an open book super

236
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,709
transparent while you guys are

237
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,089
running the numbers i can help you

238
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,699
go through that right now we can

239
00:05:36,699 --> 00:05:36,829
just

240
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:38,100
have an open honest conversation

241
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,209
to see if it makes sense to move

242
00:05:39,209 --> 00:05:41,100
forward or not you want to

243
00:05:41,209 --> 00:05:42,759
just do that now if you've got a

244
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:44,519
couple minutes like it's worth

245
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:46,120
pushing in order to run the

246
00:05:46,189 --> 00:05:46,439
numbers

247
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:47,819
with them which we can do in a

248
00:05:47,819 --> 00:05:49,500
number of different ways and just

249
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,939
honestly talk to them a lot of

250
00:05:50,939 --> 00:05:51,319
times

251
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,740
on calls especially when we're

252
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,149
talking about budget i'll just

253
00:05:54,149 --> 00:05:55,709
open up like a google doc with

254
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:55,920
them

255
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:57,480
and talk about okay considering

256
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,889
the roi because i'm in there to

257
00:05:58,889 --> 00:06:00,579
add that piece you guys just tell

258
00:06:00,579 --> 00:06:00,680
me

259
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,970
the numbers we're going to figure

260
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:03,170
out if this works or not but once

261
00:06:03,189 --> 00:06:04,500
again we want to do this on the

262
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:04,689
call

263
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:07,100
so how do we do this on the call

264
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,310
number one first step show them

265
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:10,459
the numbers so you can do

266
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,800
this using roi calculator i talked

267
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,939
about that in a previous video

268
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:14,699
daniel's also talked about that

269
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,000
as well we can do this via price

270
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,449
anchoring i've talked about that

271
00:06:17,449 --> 00:06:18,939
in a previous video once again

272
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:20,300
that's like hey typically if you

273
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,620
have a super deliverable heavy

274
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:24,339
offer it would cost you this much

275
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:28,540
let's say you're a content plus

276
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:30,600
video editing like everything

277
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,670
that's involved a to z you could

278
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:31,899
talk

279
00:06:32,009 --> 00:06:33,389
about hey typically this would be

280
00:06:33,389 --> 00:06:34,670
a ten thousand dollar a month

281
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:36,139
higher we do this for only three

282
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:37,430
thousand dollar a month offer

283
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:38,790
stacking you guys have seen this

284
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:40,379
with presentations like her mosey

285
00:06:40,379 --> 00:06:40,779
hey this

286
00:06:40,889 --> 00:06:42,069
typically costs 35 000 this costs

287
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:43,699
70 000 this costs 100 000 and you

288
00:06:43,699 --> 00:06:46,139
get it for the low price of

289
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:48,519
5 000 social proof that shows real

290
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:50,459
quantifiable results once again if

291
00:06:50,509 --> 00:06:51,769
you don't have this yet

292
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:53,069
just keep it in mind as a goal to

293
00:06:53,069 --> 00:06:54,370
work towards what i mean by real

294
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:55,899
quantifiable results is in the

295
00:06:55,899 --> 00:06:56,139
form

296
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:58,500
of clients revenue usd that's what

297
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,689
people want to see because we've

298
00:07:00,689 --> 00:07:03,009
put out hundreds of case studies

299
00:07:03,139 --> 00:07:04,009
sometimes we don't get those

300
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:05,240
things we've always noticed that

301
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,300
the case studies where people

302
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:06,610
actually

303
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:08,250
talk about how much more money

304
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:09,949
they made works exponentially

305
00:07:09,949 --> 00:07:11,579
better than somebody talking about

306
00:07:11,579 --> 00:07:11,899
hey i got

307
00:07:12,009 --> 00:07:13,379
more views i got more leads i was

308
00:07:13,379 --> 00:07:14,889
super satisfied this person's

309
00:07:14,889 --> 00:07:16,209
great once again those things are

310
00:07:16,329 --> 00:07:18,110
better than nothing but if we have

311
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:20,069
those quantifiable results we can

312
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:21,569
also use them because then it

313
00:07:21,569 --> 00:07:21,819
becomes

314
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:23,540
an argument of hey billy was able

315
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,480
to add 15k a month in his revenue

316
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,939
tom was adding 10k a month

317
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,170
in his revenue jim was adding

318
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:29,680
twenty thousand dollars a month in

319
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,420
his revenue when they came to the

320
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:31,899
call

321
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:33,350
similar to you they've never tried

322
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:35,079
paid ads before so i guess if

323
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:37,420
you're working with the same team

324
00:07:37,459 --> 00:07:38,980
and we're implementing the same

325
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:40,589
strategy do you see any reason you

326
00:07:40,589 --> 00:07:43,019
wouldn't see similar results

327
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,990
and then we can get like next

328
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:47,329
level jujitsu closing if we're if

329
00:07:47,389 --> 00:07:49,579
we're talking about uh

330
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:50,839
you know how we want to attack

331
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:52,259
kind of like the identity crisis

332
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:53,740
if somebody's like really worried

333
00:07:53,779 --> 00:07:54,730
like i don't know if it worked for

334
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,860
my business specifically we can

335
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:56,860
talk about what the variable

336
00:07:56,899 --> 00:07:58,379
is because the variable is not

337
00:07:58,379 --> 00:08:00,009
their business model a lot of the

338
00:08:00,009 --> 00:08:01,579
times because all three of those

339
00:08:01,579 --> 00:08:01,740
guys

340
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:02,860
could add business models and if

341
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:03,810
they hadn't worked with you

342
00:08:03,819 --> 00:08:04,779
beforehand then they wouldn't have

343
00:08:04,899 --> 00:08:06,209
become case studies we can get

344
00:08:06,209 --> 00:08:07,740
this guy to realize like hey he's

345
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:09,420
the variable so if they're ready

346
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:09,500
and

347
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:11,149
willing to put in the work and you

348
00:08:11,149 --> 00:08:12,879
guys are doing the same thing then

349
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:14,139
they need to be comfortable

350
00:08:14,259 --> 00:08:15,300
investing their business in order

351
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,459
to make that decision anyways that

352
00:08:16,459 --> 00:08:17,660
was just like a quick little rant

353
00:08:17,769 --> 00:08:19,550
and aside not the important thing

354
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:21,449
the important thing and the bonus

355
00:08:21,449 --> 00:08:23,819
as i mentioned it here is we need

356
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:25,600
to build up an overwhelming amount

357
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,279
of evidence that this makes sense

358
00:08:27,329 --> 00:08:28,459
for them so even the most

359
00:08:28,459 --> 00:08:28,939
skeptical

360
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:30,120
buyers have a hard time

361
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,800
disagreeing for most of you guys

362
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,500
just starting out uh or even you

363
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,139
know just as

364
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:35,370
a starting point for basically

365
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:36,730
anybody i think the roi calculator

366
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:37,960
is probably the best way to do

367
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:38,220
this

368
00:08:38,259 --> 00:08:39,668
and then start to sprinkle in

369
00:08:39,668 --> 00:08:40,809
social proof with real

370
00:08:40,809 --> 00:08:42,500
quantifiable results as you guys

371
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,340
start to gather

372
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:45,590
that because it's not one strategy

373
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:47,110
the other it's not an roi

374
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:49,159
calculator or case studies or

375
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:49,419
price

376
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:51,120
hankering or offer stacking it's

377
00:08:51,129 --> 00:08:52,799
all of them like if we combine all

378
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:55,340
of them that's the best form of

379
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:55,980
this

380
00:08:56,019 --> 00:08:56,919
right now obviously if you have

381
00:08:56,919 --> 00:08:57,850
too much to the point where it's

382
00:08:57,850 --> 00:08:59,019
taking 10 minutes yeah let's

383
00:08:59,059 --> 00:09:00,100
trim it down a little bit and then

384
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,139
just throw an extra if we need to

385
00:09:01,139 --> 00:09:02,779
as an objection handling mechanism

386
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,539
but the more the better here right

387
00:09:04,539 --> 00:09:06,240
because it's like you are a lawyer

388
00:09:06,289 --> 00:09:07,980
presenting your case the more

389
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,450
evidence the more solid the more

390
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:10,909
you're going to be closing deals

391
00:09:10,909 --> 00:09:13,100
and collecting cash so step two

392
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:13,259
now

393
00:09:13,299 --> 00:09:14,570
that you've presented the evidence

394
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:15,659
let's say you brought up the roi

395
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:16,940
calculator ask them if they

396
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:17,179
believe

397
00:09:17,289 --> 00:09:18,610
that they're going to get those

398
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:20,230
results because showing somebody

399
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:22,139
the roi calculator them saying yep

400
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:24,240
that makes sense and then you just

401
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,429
ask them for the sale is a miss

402
00:09:26,429 --> 00:09:29,659
that now i've talked about this at

403
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:31,720
the end of the pitch video we

404
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:33,980
always want to ask for the sale

405
00:09:34,029 --> 00:09:36,450
but in this case we want to first

406
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:38,269
ask them if they believe they're

407
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:40,240
going to get those results because

408
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:41,659
somebody's saying yep

409
00:09:41,779 --> 00:09:44,230
makes sense cool got it that that

410
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:46,090
doesn't yes they can understand

411
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:47,259
the numbers but if they don't

412
00:09:47,259 --> 00:09:47,580
believe

413
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:49,580
that this is going to help them

414
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:51,820
get to their goals then it doesn't

415
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,740
matter right i can believe it

416
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:53,899
could

417
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,220
work for somebody but not believe

418
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,299
it'll work for myself and i'm

419
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:58,860
still not going to buy so the way

420
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:00,220
that you can ask that question

421
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,519
very simply is hey so based on

422
00:10:01,529 --> 00:10:03,100
these numbers that we're seeing

423
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:03,500
here do you

424
00:10:03,539 --> 00:10:04,750
see any reason we wouldn't be able

425
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:05,899
to work with you on this package

426
00:10:05,929 --> 00:10:07,179
in order to get you to your goal

427
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:09,710
of 20 calls a month right and if

428
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:11,700
they think no i don't see any

429
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,899
reason they kind of mentally

430
00:10:13,899 --> 00:10:14,299
default to

431
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:15,909
a yes right so now let's go into

432
00:10:15,909 --> 00:10:17,610
step three which is all based on

433
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:19,019
the response to step two

434
00:10:19,059 --> 00:10:20,490
if it's a certain yes lay out the

435
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:22,159
onboarding steps we kind of talked

436
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:23,179
about this as well

437
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,789
make them seem valuable with quick

438
00:10:24,789 --> 00:10:26,419
wins that you want to highlight if

439
00:10:26,419 --> 00:10:27,490
you can if you can paint the

440
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:29,460
onboarding as a valuable thing it

441
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:31,549
kills two birds with one stone one

442
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:33,500
it makes them want to do this

443
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:35,039
more because the next step is a

444
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:36,629
value to them but two laying out

445
00:10:36,629 --> 00:10:38,379
the onboarding steps in general

446
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:39,870
gives them the clarity that they

447
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:41,740
need to move forward we don't want

448
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,019
to have our prospect have

449
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:44,580
any fear of the unknown because

450
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:46,200
that within itself can keep them

451
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,299
from closing so if it's a certain

452
00:10:48,299 --> 00:10:48,620
yes

453
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:51,389
full conviction yeah dude i think

454
00:10:51,389 --> 00:10:53,389
it's absolutely going to work lay

455
00:10:53,389 --> 00:10:54,440
out the onboarding steps make

456
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,360
them seem valuable with quick wins

457
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,919
and ask for the sale if it's an

458
00:10:57,970 --> 00:10:59,740
uncertain yes which trust me is

459
00:10:59,740 --> 00:10:59,860
not

460
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:02,019
a yes it's almost always a no but

461
00:11:02,019 --> 00:11:04,059
if it's an uncertain yes yeah i

462
00:11:04,059 --> 00:11:06,220
mean i think this could work or

463
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:07,879
yeah uh yeah i could see this

464
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:10,340
possibly working once again if we

465
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,740
just take ourself out of the

466
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:13,840
sales conversation and we apply

467
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,690
this to any other area of life

468
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:17,370
let's say you're asking your

469
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:17,740
girlfriend

470
00:11:17,779 --> 00:11:19,000
if you want to go get pizza and

471
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,320
she's like yeah i think i could

472
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,299
see myself getting pizza or yeah

473
00:11:22,299 --> 00:11:22,460
you

474
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:23,840
know i think i think pizza could

475
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,049
be good you'd be like hey why

476
00:11:25,049 --> 00:11:26,460
don't you why don't you want to

477
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:26,539
get

478
00:11:26,659 --> 00:11:28,500
pizza right because that does not

479
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,320
mean a yes that's not how normal

480
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,059
people talk but for whatever

481
00:11:32,059 --> 00:11:32,860
reason

482
00:11:32,899 --> 00:11:34,360
and it's it's usually because

483
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,919
people are just hungry to close

484
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:37,340
the deal and they they want to

485
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:39,000
have an optimistic mindset to be

486
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,600
okay yes cool move on to the next

487
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,220
thing do not do that in this case

488
00:11:42,259 --> 00:11:44,480
if it's an uncertain yes let's

489
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:46,970
challenge them back and say okay

490
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:48,700
why why do you think you want to

491
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:48,860
do

492
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:50,240
this they'll start to sell

493
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:52,110
themselves on the logical reasons

494
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:53,659
they'd want to do this hey you

495
00:11:53,659 --> 00:11:54,059
know you guys

496
00:11:54,169 --> 00:11:55,440
have good case studies um yeah

497
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,940
this is like way more volume than

498
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,370
we've ever done seems like you've

499
00:11:58,490 --> 00:11:59,889
helped other similar people in the

500
00:11:59,889 --> 00:12:01,230
space they're going to start to

501
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:02,700
sell themselves on the logical

502
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,850
reasons on the roi on the case

503
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:07,090
studies that you guys have the

504
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:09,090
facts the comparisons as i

505
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:09,500
mentioned

506
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:11,039
earlier now once we've established

507
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:12,309
the logical reasons now let's

508
00:12:12,309 --> 00:12:13,980
gauge where they're at emotionally

509
00:12:14,019 --> 00:12:15,120
okay cool so considering because

510
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,080
once again we're kind of just

511
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,340
repeating the rewards back to them

512
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:17,500
at this

513
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:19,120
point considering the fact that

514
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,679
you think this will that you'll

515
00:12:20,679 --> 00:12:23,980
see you know an increase in calls

516
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,529
because of the fact that we're

517
00:12:25,529 --> 00:12:27,340
doing way more volume right you'll

518
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:28,860
see x result for abc reasons

519
00:12:28,899 --> 00:12:30,019
is there any reason you wouldn't

520
00:12:30,019 --> 00:12:31,259
want to get started on this today

521
00:12:31,259 --> 00:12:34,059
right just once again this is kind

522
00:12:34,059 --> 00:12:34,139
of

523
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:35,559
like a soft ask for the sale but

524
00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:37,129
the reason why we're doing this is

525
00:12:37,149 --> 00:12:38,779
because even though i almost know

526
00:12:38,899 --> 00:12:40,250
whenever it's an uncertain yes

527
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,769
that they're going to say no this

528
00:12:41,779 --> 00:12:43,090
is where we can get the true

529
00:12:43,149 --> 00:12:44,059
objection

530
00:12:44,169 --> 00:12:45,299
which is great we're going to talk

531
00:12:45,299 --> 00:12:46,419
about objection handling in a

532
00:12:46,419 --> 00:12:47,740
minute here but if we get the real

533
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:49,639
objection we basically you know a

534
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:51,460
lot of times uh the biggest issue

535
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:53,379
is just isolating the objection

536
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:54,899
and a lot of times if they appeal

537
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:56,509
to the logical reason they'd want

538
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:58,059
to do this we've tackled that

539
00:12:58,169 --> 00:12:59,940
uncertainty reasons so going on to

540
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:01,809
the objection i'm getting a little

541
00:13:01,809 --> 00:13:03,340
bit ahead of myself it's probably

542
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:06,179
going to be fear timing partner or

543
00:13:06,179 --> 00:13:08,929
money most of the time right once

544
00:13:08,929 --> 00:13:11,019
again uncertainty would probably

545
00:13:11,019 --> 00:13:11,580
be

546
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:12,500
the next thing i'm going to go

547
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,509
over where they just don't think

548
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:14,700
it's going to work but if this

549
00:13:14,809 --> 00:13:15,899
person's uncertain yes and they

550
00:13:15,899 --> 00:13:17,139
can actually articulate why they

551
00:13:17,149 --> 00:13:18,220
would want to do this we

552
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,919
probably have the uncertainty once

553
00:13:19,929 --> 00:13:21,460
solved so it's probably going to

554
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:22,860
be fear which goes hand in hand

555
00:13:22,899 --> 00:13:24,100
with uncertainty but it's a little

556
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,259
bit different timing partner or

557
00:13:25,289 --> 00:13:26,379
money there's not that many

558
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,480
objections in the world once again

559
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,370
this is why i teach people the

560
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:29,659
framework because they can frame

561
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,470
it a bunch of different ways but

562
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,370
it's typically just one of these

563
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:34,940
reasons here now if it's an i'll

564
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:35,059
think

565
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:36,860
about it we need to push past that

566
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:38,480
and isolate it like i'll think

567
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,059
about it as not a real objection

568
00:13:40,169 --> 00:13:41,230
once again i'm going to dive

569
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:42,600
deeper into that in a minute here

570
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,980
if they respond to step two with

571
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,659
anything outside of yes or an

572
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:47,620
uncertain uneasy yes then we need

573
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:49,340
to call it out and that's one of

574
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:49,500
those

575
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,309
things that actually gets pretty

576
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,960
easy the longer you're in sales

577
00:13:53,009 --> 00:13:54,700
but it's just a matter of kind of

578
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:57,159
like breaking the fourth wall and

579
00:13:57,159 --> 00:14:00,100
just calling it up like hey man it

580
00:14:00,149 --> 00:14:03,419
doesn't sound like you're super

581
00:14:03,539 --> 00:14:05,100
certain and you're not gonna hurt

582
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,659
my feelings man i i get it you're

583
00:14:06,659 --> 00:14:08,139
probably in sales as well it

584
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:08,440
sounds

585
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,830
like you're not 100 sure this is

586
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:10,860
going to help you fix your lead

587
00:14:10,889 --> 00:14:12,139
generation issue to get you guys

588
00:14:12,139 --> 00:14:12,279
10

589
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:13,629
more calls i guess my questions is

590
00:14:13,629 --> 00:14:14,950
well you know what's coming up for

591
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:16,379
you that's giving you some doubt

592
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,779
once again we want to we want to

593
00:14:18,809 --> 00:14:21,179
get that real objection out of it

594
00:14:21,179 --> 00:14:21,980
we want to isolate the

595
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,500
objection because that's the first

596
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,909
step in solving any objection now

597
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:26,370
step four if we've done steps

598
00:14:26,419 --> 00:14:28,289
one through three correctly you've

599
00:14:28,299 --> 00:14:30,019
either a already closed the deal

600
00:14:30,019 --> 00:14:33,169
great or b we need to isolate and

601
00:14:33,299 --> 00:14:35,070
handle the objection itself right

602
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:36,740
and and you're you're probably

603
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,580
already made most of progress if

604
00:14:38,659 --> 00:14:39,789
you're in this second category

605
00:14:39,789 --> 00:14:41,009
here and actually isolating the

606
00:14:41,009 --> 00:14:42,700
objection and then c you know this

607
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:42,779
is

608
00:14:42,889 --> 00:14:44,440
where we you know we have to one

609
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,169
isolate it and then two solve it

610
00:14:46,169 --> 00:14:47,740
so let's go into how i solve

611
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,519
objections i solve objections uh

612
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:51,200
and this is something that i came

613
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:53,259
up with called the xyz aside

614
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:54,730
method but if you've watched any

615
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:56,250
sales videos this is very similar

616
00:14:56,269 --> 00:14:57,570
to a lot of the other stuff that

617
00:14:57,690 --> 00:14:59,490
you've probably seen before um and

618
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,269
i'm going to dive deeper into why

619
00:15:01,269 --> 00:15:02,860
that is and you know why these

620
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:05,129
principles are taught widely it's

621
00:15:05,139 --> 00:15:07,179
it's usually because they work

622
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:09,179
quite well right isolate and

623
00:15:09,179 --> 00:15:09,820
handle any

624
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,090
objection confidently without

625
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:12,120
having to remember canned

626
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,580
comebacks that don't actually work

627
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:14,059
that's the goal

628
00:15:14,169 --> 00:15:15,669
with this xyz aside method so

629
00:15:15,669 --> 00:15:17,419
let's just start off high level

630
00:15:17,419 --> 00:15:19,179
the most common pitfalls when

631
00:15:19,179 --> 00:15:19,580
handling

632
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:21,899
objections are one not sniffing

633
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:23,960
out smoke screens and two not

634
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:25,820
isolating the objection

635
00:15:25,929 --> 00:15:27,480
right so not sniffing out smoke

636
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,279
screen an example of that would be

637
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:30,700
somebody says i need to think

638
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:30,940
about

639
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,289
it cool what do you need to think

640
00:15:32,289 --> 00:15:33,590
about uh well if you can send me

641
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:35,100
over the email that'd be great

642
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:36,350
okay cool man send you over the

643
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:37,539
email when can i expect you to

644
00:15:37,549 --> 00:15:38,620
hear back once again like we

645
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:39,179
didn't

646
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:40,309
we didn't sniff out that smoke

647
00:15:40,309 --> 00:15:41,519
screen of the i'll think about it

648
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:43,179
we just accepted it at face value

649
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,169
we asked them what information

650
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,299
they wanted to see we sent it over

651
00:15:45,299 --> 00:15:46,539
and we established some timeline

652
00:15:46,649 --> 00:15:48,200
for a follow-up not a good idea

653
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,740
right so first off we need to

654
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,419
sniff out those smoke screens and

655
00:15:51,419 --> 00:15:51,500
if

656
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,269
somebody says once again like an

657
00:15:53,269 --> 00:15:55,110
uncertain yes yeah i think i think

658
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:56,700
i want to do this if we just take

659
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:57,919
that face value great when do you

660
00:15:57,919 --> 00:15:59,039
think you want to do it oh we'll

661
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:00,289
get in touch with you next week

662
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:01,529
you're never going to hear back

663
00:16:01,529 --> 00:16:03,320
from that person i promise you and

664
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,019
then if we do call out

665
00:16:05,129 --> 00:16:06,539
things and we sniff out that smoke

666
00:16:06,539 --> 00:16:08,070
screen then we need to isolate the

667
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:08,610
objection

668
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:11,549
two there are only four real

669
00:16:11,549 --> 00:16:14,019
objections right and these these

670
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:15,340
are a little bit different but

671
00:16:15,379 --> 00:16:17,059
i kind of grouped them together

672
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,750
here but it's partner finance

673
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:21,580
money as i called it earlier fear

674
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,710
uncertainty and timing right the

675
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:25,360
reason why these kind of go

676
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:27,179
together is uncertainty i'm not

677
00:16:27,179 --> 00:16:27,659
sure if this

678
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:30,059
is going to work um fear is more

679
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:32,590
so just like even if i do think it

680
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:34,450
would work i'm just a little bit

681
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:36,139
scared to do it in timing right i

682
00:16:36,139 --> 00:16:37,679
need to think about it is not a

683
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:39,259
real objection that's a smoke

684
00:16:39,379 --> 00:16:40,750
screen if someone says i need to

685
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,120
think about it do not ask them

686
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,659
what they need to think about

687
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:44,659
they're

688
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,399
politely telling you no so asking

689
00:16:46,409 --> 00:16:47,870
what they need to think about

690
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:49,500
makes no sense and fails to sniff

691
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:49,580
out

692
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:51,259
the smoke stream instead say

693
00:16:51,259 --> 00:16:53,009
totally fair now before you go

694
00:16:53,009 --> 00:16:55,340
away and think about it this is

695
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:55,580
really

696
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:56,789
important now before you go away

697
00:16:56,789 --> 00:16:57,840
and think about it because if

698
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,259
somebody says i'll think about it

699
00:16:59,379 --> 00:17:01,429
their guard's up i don't want to

700
00:17:01,429 --> 00:17:03,700
get closed so i'll think about it

701
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:05,180
on my terms and i'll get back

702
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:06,940
to you that's what they're trying

703
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:08,640
to say really so that little line

704
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:10,059
of now before you go away and

705
00:17:10,098 --> 00:17:11,049
think about it that's going to get

706
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:11,990
them to lower their guard and

707
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,098
lower their sales resistance

708
00:17:13,098 --> 00:17:13,259
because

709
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:14,818
i've already prefaced that they

710
00:17:14,818 --> 00:17:16,480
can go away and think about it so

711
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,460
it's like i'm not going to hold

712
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,920
you hostage on this call it's kind

713
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,230
of like i'm pointing the gun at

714
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:22,460
the guy it's like okay let's

715
00:17:22,568 --> 00:17:24,078
lower the gun for a second here so

716
00:17:24,078 --> 00:17:25,650
it first emphasizes with their

717
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:26,848
stance then lowers the

718
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:28,068
sales resistance by prefacing that

719
00:17:28,068 --> 00:17:29,109
they can go away and think about

720
00:17:29,109 --> 00:17:30,140
it we're not going to hold them

721
00:17:30,259 --> 00:17:31,829
hostage on the call then say

722
00:17:31,829 --> 00:17:33,890
before you go away and think about

723
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:35,960
it do you think this is something

724
00:17:36,009 --> 00:17:36,059
that

725
00:17:36,099 --> 00:17:37,329
can actually get you to their

726
00:17:37,339 --> 00:17:38,880
goals because let's say they might

727
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,369
actually have something to think

728
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,450
about most of the time they don't

729
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:44,380
right it's just a polite way to

730
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:46,200
tell you no but even if they did

731
00:17:46,329 --> 00:17:48,049
have something to think about if

732
00:17:48,049 --> 00:17:49,880
they don't believe your service

733
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,700
this is a double negative so let

734
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:51,740
me

735
00:17:51,859 --> 00:17:53,299
change that is something that's

736
00:17:53,299 --> 00:17:54,900
going to work for them they're not

737
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,539
going to join anyways right even

738
00:17:56,539 --> 00:17:56,619
if

739
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:58,190
they did legitimately have to

740
00:17:58,190 --> 00:17:59,750
think about some logistics in

741
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,420
terms of how this would apply if

742
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:01,900
they don't

743
00:18:02,009 --> 00:18:03,250
first think that this is going to

744
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,500
work there's no point ask them

745
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,819
what they need to think about

746
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:07,039
because if they don't think it's

747
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:08,299
going to work they're not going to

748
00:18:08,299 --> 00:18:11,980
do it right however if they

749
00:18:12,089 --> 00:18:13,450
think this can hit their goals

750
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:15,109
this can help them hit their goals

751
00:18:15,109 --> 00:18:16,779
ask them why they think that once

752
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:18,539
again it's it's just kind of like

753
00:18:18,539 --> 00:18:20,230
a quick return get them to start

754
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:22,140
appealing to like the emotional or

755
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:23,490
the logical reasons usually the

756
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:24,890
logical reasons that they want to

757
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:26,059
do it they'll start to sell

758
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:27,250
themselves and we can ask okay

759
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:28,529
cool so if you're confident that

760
00:18:28,529 --> 00:18:31,019
you can this can help you achieve

761
00:18:31,059 --> 00:18:32,329
this goal what's coming up for you

762
00:18:32,329 --> 00:18:33,599
that makes you feel like you need

763
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,700
to think about it you can see

764
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:35,859
it's pretty similar to what we

765
00:18:35,859 --> 00:18:37,029
already said up top then we can

766
00:18:37,029 --> 00:18:39,660
handle the isolated issue right if

767
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:39,819
they

768
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:41,630
don't think that this can help

769
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,700
them hit their goals or they sound

770
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,420
uncertain let's call it out and

771
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:46,059
isolate

772
00:18:46,099 --> 00:18:47,680
why right so at this point if they

773
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,180
don't think it's going to help

774
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:50,779
them hit their goals it's probably

775
00:18:50,779 --> 00:18:51,079
an

776
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:53,079
uncertainty objection right so we

777
00:18:53,079 --> 00:18:54,670
need to call that out so we're

778
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:56,539
going to get the uncertainty in a

779
00:18:56,549 --> 00:18:56,920
second but

780
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:58,690
we're actually going to start with

781
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:00,400
a partner objection now once again

782
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:01,960
you'll notice the xyz

783
00:19:02,089 --> 00:19:03,759
aside method because i'm almost

784
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:05,440
displacing the reason why they

785
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:07,180
tell me they're not going to buy

786
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:07,380
right

787
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:08,680
now and focus on the important

788
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,029
stuff which is do they think this

789
00:19:10,029 --> 00:19:11,180
is going to work so if it's

790
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:11,500
partner

791
00:19:11,619 --> 00:19:12,950
objection i need to talk to my

792
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:14,700
business first let's not just give

793
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:17,259
up and book follow-up call that's

794
00:19:17,259 --> 00:19:17,660
lazy

795
00:19:19,619 --> 00:19:21,299
let's first empathize with their

796
00:19:21,319 --> 00:19:22,990
stance again but ask them if they

797
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:24,220
think this can help them hit

798
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:25,599
their goals so you could say

799
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:27,339
something like no worries i've got

800
00:19:27,339 --> 00:19:29,019
a business partner myself so i

801
00:19:29,059 --> 00:19:30,390
get it but before you go away and

802
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:31,750
talk with john i've got to ask in

803
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,329
your opinion specifically do you

804
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:35,039
think this is something that can

805
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,480
help you achieve xyz goal if

806
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,299
there's uncertainty once again

807
00:19:38,299 --> 00:19:38,700
let's call

808
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:40,960
it out if they are confident great

809
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:42,970
now let's ask them what john's

810
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:45,019
objection may be awesome to hear

811
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:45,940
i know you're running lead

812
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,150
generation so if you're confident

813
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:48,299
that this is what you guys need

814
00:19:48,299 --> 00:19:48,609
then i'm

815
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:50,509
curious is there any reason you

816
00:19:50,509 --> 00:19:52,529
think john would be against this a

817
00:19:52,529 --> 00:19:55,099
lot of times they'll just voice

818
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:56,640
their own objection that they were

819
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,089
too afraid to say because now it's

820
00:19:58,109 --> 00:19:59,259
like i don't have the heart

821
00:19:59,299 --> 00:20:00,920
to tell this guy but if it's not

822
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,309
me telling the guy it's my

823
00:20:02,309 --> 00:20:04,279
business partner it may or may not

824
00:20:04,349 --> 00:20:04,660
exist

825
00:20:05,299 --> 00:20:06,359
once again we can ask about you

826
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:07,440
know different people in the

827
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,619
decision making party in the

828
00:20:08,619 --> 00:20:09,079
discovery

829
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:10,359
so we don't get hit with these

830
00:20:10,359 --> 00:20:11,839
people that don't exist at the end

831
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:13,259
of the call but once again even

832
00:20:13,299 --> 00:20:14,140
if there is a real business

833
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:15,140
partner a lot of times they'll

834
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:16,140
just say their own objection

835
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:18,140
so they can displace the blame on

836
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:20,259
somebody else other times john the

837
00:20:20,259 --> 00:20:21,019
business partner in this

838
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:23,200
scenario may actually have an

839
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,720
objection either way it's helpful

840
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:28,859
to solve it right so finally let's

841
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,480
say there's no reason john would

842
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,920
be against it mr prospect who

843
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,250
we're talking to is confident

844
00:20:33,369 --> 00:20:35,140
this will work he just needs to

845
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:36,720
get john's sign off on the

846
00:20:36,769 --> 00:20:38,660
investment itself then it becomes

847
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:39,180
a lot

848
00:20:39,299 --> 00:20:40,829
easier if it's just a matter of

849
00:20:40,829 --> 00:20:42,700
permission there's nothing else

850
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:43,980
which is super common

851
00:20:44,089 --> 00:20:45,839
then it becomes a lot easier to

852
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:47,799
compress a follow-up timeline

853
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:49,180
which is super important because

854
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:49,380
time

855
00:20:49,529 --> 00:20:50,599
kills deals like guys i tell my

856
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:51,940
guys this all the time especially

857
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:55,019
when it hits thursday friday those

858
00:20:55,059 --> 00:20:56,529
are scary hours i'm like guys i'm

859
00:20:56,529 --> 00:20:59,150
telling you push harder on these

860
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:01,180
days so that the deal gets wrapped

861
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,619
up this week because something

862
00:21:02,619 --> 00:21:04,170
happens even when prospects that

863
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:05,660
genuinely wants to do it when

864
00:21:05,769 --> 00:21:07,670
the weekend goes by they go out

865
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:09,670
they gamble or they they have a

866
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,819
big night at a dinner or a bar and

867
00:21:11,819 --> 00:21:11,980
all

868
00:21:12,019 --> 00:21:12,940
of a sudden they just kind of

869
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,049
forget like i spent a lot of money

870
00:21:14,059 --> 00:21:15,180
this week i don't know if i'm in

871
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:15,259
the

872
00:21:15,369 --> 00:21:16,980
mood to spend money on on monday

873
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,349
right so push these guys

874
00:21:18,349 --> 00:21:20,380
especially you know when there's

875
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:20,890
that deadline

876
00:21:21,059 --> 00:21:23,630
like a holiday or a weekend coming

877
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:26,230
up but once again if the person is

878
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,809
actually sold and it's just a

879
00:21:27,819 --> 00:21:28,140
matter of

880
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:30,250
permission it becomes a lot easier

881
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:32,119
to get the sign off on the call or

882
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:33,539
as soon as possible which is key

883
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,549
because time feels kills deals

884
00:21:35,549 --> 00:21:37,549
what you'll find is that you know

885
00:21:37,569 --> 00:21:39,500
the reason why i want to displace

886
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:39,740
this

887
00:21:39,859 --> 00:21:41,740
partner place a partner aside and

888
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:43,450
essentially say hey cool and

889
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:45,259
before you go away and talk to

890
00:21:45,259 --> 00:21:45,339
your

891
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:46,799
partner i'm curious do you

892
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:48,630
specifically think this is what

893
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:50,619
you guys need because what you'll

894
00:21:50,619 --> 00:21:51,160
find is a lot

895
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:53,309
of times you still end up going to

896
00:21:53,309 --> 00:21:55,500
follow up but if you actually have

897
00:21:55,549 --> 00:21:57,000
this person i'm talking to on

898
00:21:57,130 --> 00:21:59,259
the call 100 sold your success

899
00:21:59,259 --> 00:22:01,130
rate will be way higher because

900
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:03,019
they'll become a champion within

901
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:04,700
their company for you right and if

902
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,259
there's a follow-up call where

903
00:22:06,259 --> 00:22:07,819
most of the time there should be a

904
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:09,400
follow-up call i may make a video

905
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,940
just called save yourself time

906
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:12,779
book the follow-up call because in

907
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,599
basically every scenario where

908
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:16,630
there's something that still needs

909
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,019
to be discussed and they're not

910
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:21,250
100 of the way there there should

911
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:22,700
be a follow-up call right if

912
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:23,900
nothing else it's just going to

913
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:24,140
place

914
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:26,329
a deadline for them to get back to

915
00:22:26,329 --> 00:22:28,450
you which is super important if

916
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:30,140
you kind of let that go or you

917
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:31,230
just you know generally like hey

918
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:32,230
yeah get back to me by the end of

919
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:33,420
the week they don't do it

920
00:22:33,529 --> 00:22:34,900
right but if this person i had on

921
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,680
the first call is 100 sold this

922
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,140
person is going to become my

923
00:22:38,259 --> 00:22:39,569
teammate on the follow-up call

924
00:22:39,569 --> 00:22:40,880
what i mean by they'll become

925
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,700
champions within the company if i

926
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:42,859
was

927
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,960
to run something by my business

928
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,720
partner daniel or andre or

929
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,940
christian if i come to them and i

930
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:49,650
say hey

931
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,880
i think this uh this you know

932
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:54,680
sales consulting program would be

933
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:57,579
pretty good helping my department

934
00:22:57,619 --> 00:22:58,720
and they're like okay they're

935
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,960
always just going to ask how much

936
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,099
is it uh it's twenty thousand

937
00:23:01,099 --> 00:23:01,400
dollars

938
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:02,650
so it's an expensive one if

939
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:04,150
they're like well you know do you

940
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:05,730
think it's a good move if i'm like

941
00:23:05,779 --> 00:23:07,059
yeah i think it would work they're

942
00:23:07,059 --> 00:23:08,220
like okay like we've got other

943
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:09,900
priorities let's focus on this but

944
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:11,519
if i'm a hundred percent sold and

945
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:13,079
i'm like guys no this is gonna be

946
00:23:13,079 --> 00:23:14,619
game changer it's going to

947
00:23:14,619 --> 00:23:15,019
increase

948
00:23:15,059 --> 00:23:16,549
our close rate from twenty percent

949
00:23:16,549 --> 00:23:17,869
to thirty percent you guys can

950
00:23:17,869 --> 00:23:19,259
look at the numbers and see what

951
00:23:19,369 --> 00:23:20,579
that would do to our company

952
00:23:20,579 --> 00:23:22,069
they're gonna be like okay yeah

953
00:23:22,069 --> 00:23:24,539
dude like we trust you go do it so

954
00:23:24,579 --> 00:23:25,529
that's what i mean by champion

955
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:26,690
within your company which only

956
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:27,980
happens if you actually get that

957
00:23:28,099 --> 00:23:29,680
commitment you actually sell the

958
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,500
person 100 on the call now on a

959
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,579
follow-up call they're your

960
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,480
teammate on that call and the

961
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,500
times when you don't have this

962
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,660
person 100 sold it's very

963
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:40,450
difficult

964
00:23:40,579 --> 00:23:43,420
right because then i'm going into

965
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:46,230
the follow-up call and it's one v

966
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:48,220
two as opposed to two v one

967
00:23:48,339 --> 00:23:50,230
follow-up calls are really easy

968
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:51,599
when it's me and the business

969
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:52,940
partner who are on the same team

970
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:53,099
because

971
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:54,369
that person's already sold

972
00:23:54,369 --> 00:23:55,750
convincing another business

973
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:57,259
partner they're very very hard

974
00:23:57,259 --> 00:23:57,660
when it's

975
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:59,170
me convincing two skeptical

976
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:00,910
parties there's a lot of dynamics

977
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:02,460
that go on there once again that

978
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:02,619
could

979
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:03,589
be a whole other video just

980
00:24:03,589 --> 00:24:04,690
talking about how to make each

981
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,059
person heard and make sure there's

982
00:24:06,059 --> 00:24:06,380
no

983
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,950
skeptical party or make no silent

984
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:09,339
party on the call just because

985
00:24:09,339 --> 00:24:10,769
then it's it always ends up and

986
00:24:10,789 --> 00:24:10,940
hey

987
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:12,029
we're going to discuss this

988
00:24:12,029 --> 00:24:13,250
offline but trust me if it's one

989
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:14,759
of those situations where you talk

990
00:24:14,769 --> 00:24:14,859
to

991
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,019
a business partner first then it's

992
00:24:16,019 --> 00:24:16,980
a follow-up call with all the

993
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:17,900
business partners on there

994
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:20,180
it's a lot easier when it's two v

995
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:21,799
one versus one v two so that's the

996
00:24:21,799 --> 00:24:23,180
partner objection with the

997
00:24:23,289 --> 00:24:24,640
money objection i can't afford

998
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,200
this is what they're essentially

999
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,740
saying uh so we call the finance

1000
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:27,819
up

1001
00:24:27,859 --> 00:24:28,990
here let's just change this to

1002
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:31,349
money but same thing with the

1003
00:24:31,349 --> 00:24:34,299
money objection i can't afford

1004
00:24:34,299 --> 00:24:34,460
this

1005
00:24:34,569 --> 00:24:36,009
what i'm gonna respond is all good

1006
00:24:36,009 --> 00:24:37,859
if you can't don't worry man we

1007
00:24:37,859 --> 00:24:38,940
don't want to put anybody in a

1008
00:24:39,059 --> 00:24:40,460
situation of financial hardship

1009
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:42,079
but i'm curious money aside is

1010
00:24:42,079 --> 00:24:44,859
this something you're 100

1011
00:24:44,859 --> 00:24:45,660
confident

1012
00:24:45,779 --> 00:24:47,960
would get you to xyz goal what i'm

1013
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:50,190
doing here is i'm isolating the

1014
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:52,130
money as the actual objection

1015
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:55,819
because anything's too expensive

1016
00:24:55,819 --> 00:24:58,220
if i don't think it's gonna work

1017
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:00,559
right if i don't if i don't think

1018
00:25:00,819 --> 00:25:01,970
something's gonna help my business

1019
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:03,099
i'm gonna pay five dollars for it

1020
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:04,059
let alone five thousand

1021
00:25:04,099 --> 00:25:04,990
so let's make sure money's

1022
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:06,009
actually the problem if it's

1023
00:25:06,009 --> 00:25:06,619
confident yes

1024
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:08,829
then i'm gonna say awesome so if

1025
00:25:08,829 --> 00:25:11,279
you're confident this can help you

1026
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:12,380
achieve xyz goal

1027
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:13,869
then would you be open to having

1028
00:25:13,869 --> 00:25:15,019
just like a quick honest

1029
00:25:15,019 --> 00:25:16,779
conversation about your finances

1030
00:25:16,819 --> 00:25:17,890
so i can see if we have an option

1031
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:19,559
that works for you because i also

1032
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:21,170
don't want to let you you guys

1033
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,509
get the help you need even further

1034
00:25:22,509 --> 00:25:24,230
if we can help you out right and

1035
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:27,180
they'll usually just be like yeah

1036
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:28,289
okay that makes sense right if

1037
00:25:28,289 --> 00:25:29,490
we've already established that

1038
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:30,539
this is going to get them to

1039
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:32,349
this outcome if they're thinking

1040
00:25:32,359 --> 00:25:34,170
about the return as opposed to the

1041
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:35,630
initial investment they're going

1042
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:35,660
to

1043
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,650
be open to having that real

1044
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:37,900
conversation with you and then we

1045
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,099
can kind of just break down what

1046
00:25:39,099 --> 00:25:39,819
numbers

1047
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:41,319
look like right sometimes they

1048
00:25:41,319 --> 00:25:42,859
were looking at a smaller larger

1049
00:25:42,859 --> 00:25:44,210
package that can actually afford

1050
00:25:44,259 --> 00:25:45,720
a smaller package or sometimes

1051
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,390
it's like they're actually pretty

1052
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:48,940
close on budget and i'm like okay

1053
00:25:49,049 --> 00:25:50,250
dude i mean we talked about the

1054
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:51,680
fact that you are confident that

1055
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,019
this can help you guys out and

1056
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:54,740
based on what i've seen for other

1057
00:25:54,759 --> 00:25:56,309
similar companies i am too is

1058
00:25:56,309 --> 00:25:57,940
there anywhere else on the

1059
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:58,940
marketing or

1060
00:25:58,980 --> 00:25:59,859
sales side where you feel like

1061
00:25:59,859 --> 00:26:00,740
your budget isn't being used

1062
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:01,920
effectively because we're only a

1063
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:02,140
thousand

1064
00:26:02,259 --> 00:26:03,950
dollars off at this point like i

1065
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,960
can get real into the nitty-gritty

1066
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:07,500
i've talked to a lot of guys

1067
00:26:07,609 --> 00:26:08,880
about how much money is in their

1068
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,380
bank account their business bank

1069
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:11,660
account how much money they're

1070
00:26:11,779 --> 00:26:14,099
spending on all other vendors just

1071
00:26:14,099 --> 00:26:16,299
because before i did that i made

1072
00:26:16,299 --> 00:26:18,140
sure that money was actually the

1073
00:26:18,259 --> 00:26:19,490
problem and i just framed it this

1074
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:20,539
way cool man like if we're

1075
00:26:20,539 --> 00:26:21,960
confident that it's going to get

1076
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:22,460
you

1077
00:26:22,579 --> 00:26:24,150
result return then would you be

1078
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:25,839
open to having just like a quick

1079
00:26:25,839 --> 00:26:27,339
honest conversation about your

1080
00:26:27,339 --> 00:26:27,819
finances

1081
00:26:27,859 --> 00:26:28,950
where they're at and they're

1082
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:30,440
usually going to say yes if they

1083
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,980
are actually sold on this and if

1084
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:32,619
they're not

1085
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:33,950
once again that goes to

1086
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:35,920
uncertainty we call it out timing

1087
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,819
objection this all looks great

1088
00:26:37,859 --> 00:26:38,779
but yeah we're not ready to move

1089
00:26:38,779 --> 00:26:40,059
on anything for a couple months no

1090
00:26:40,059 --> 00:26:43,450
worries at all once again lower

1091
00:26:43,609 --> 00:26:45,180
sales resistance you guys see the

1092
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:46,799
common trends coming up in these

1093
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:48,519
no worries at all but i'm curious

1094
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:49,880
timing aside are you actually

1095
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,309
confident that this can help you

1096
00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:54,700
achieve xyz if they are confident

1097
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:55,259
yes then

1098
00:26:55,369 --> 00:26:57,509
once again i'm going to reiterate

1099
00:26:57,509 --> 00:26:59,900
my typical timeline to see results

1100
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:02,059
and i'm being conservative

1101
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:03,680
because if i'm being conservative

1102
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,130
with my timeline to see results

1103
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:06,059
let's say i'm uh

1104
00:27:06,170 --> 00:27:08,089
man i hate i hate that i keep

1105
00:27:08,089 --> 00:27:10,670
using cold email as an example for

1106
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:12,059
you guys but let's say i'm selling

1107
00:27:12,059 --> 00:27:12,299
cold

1108
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:14,960
email if i'm taking two weeks to

1109
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:18,539
set up and launch and it's 10 days

1110
00:27:18,539 --> 00:27:20,289
to get up to full speed and then

1111
00:27:20,339 --> 00:27:21,750
it's initial testing i'm not going

1112
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:22,900
to project that they'll get

1113
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,119
results till the second half

1114
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:25,819
of month two and a lot of times

1115
00:27:25,819 --> 00:27:27,500
people are saying hey i'm not

1116
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,170
ready to start in this right now

1117
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:29,500
but if

1118
00:27:29,539 --> 00:27:30,829
i remind them of our typical

1119
00:27:30,829 --> 00:27:32,400
timeline versus theirs i can ask

1120
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,779
them like hey when you say a

1121
00:27:33,779 --> 00:27:34,299
couple months

1122
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:36,089
are you guys looking to take on

1123
00:27:36,089 --> 00:27:38,089
sales calls in a couple months

1124
00:27:38,089 --> 00:27:40,059
months or just starting a new

1125
00:27:40,059 --> 00:27:40,460
initiative

1126
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,309
in a couple months because we know

1127
00:27:42,309 --> 00:27:43,890
in our back pocket if they say

1128
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:46,059
they're just looking to if they're

1129
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:47,309
looking to get sales calls in a

1130
00:27:47,309 --> 00:27:48,710
couple months then they should be

1131
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:50,059
getting started now right so it's

1132
00:27:50,059 --> 00:27:50,140
a

1133
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:51,079
good chance to set proper

1134
00:27:51,079 --> 00:27:52,450
expectations while also being able

1135
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:53,660
to make a good argument that they

1136
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:53,819
should

1137
00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:55,680
get started sooner rather than

1138
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,599
later if they seem to be delaying

1139
00:27:57,609 --> 00:27:59,420
for no good reason it's not a

1140
00:27:59,420 --> 00:27:59,740
timing

1141
00:27:59,859 --> 00:28:01,809
issue it's a priorities issue

1142
00:28:01,819 --> 00:28:04,059
right if this doesn't seem super

1143
00:28:04,109 --> 00:28:06,299
logical in terms of why they're

1144
00:28:06,329 --> 00:28:06,700
delaying

1145
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:08,490
it's not a timing issue it's a

1146
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:10,519
priority issue which typically

1147
00:28:10,529 --> 00:28:12,329
falls under fear and uncertainty

1148
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:14,259
so we need to isolate and handle

1149
00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:16,140
that instead right and we can do

1150
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:17,980
that in a number of different

1151
00:28:18,019 --> 00:28:19,359
ways hey i understand you're super

1152
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:20,740
busy and it's probably never going

1153
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:21,799
to sound like a good time

1154
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:23,619
but you mentioned that your goal

1155
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:25,089
is to get to fifty thousand

1156
00:28:25,089 --> 00:28:26,619
dollars a month in revenue

1157
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:28,200
by the end of the year and just

1158
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,049
based on our timeline those types

1159
00:28:30,049 --> 00:28:31,640
of results are going to take

1160
00:28:31,769 --> 00:28:33,589
four or five months based on the

1161
00:28:33,599 --> 00:28:35,460
growth you guys are looking to

1162
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:37,660
achieve so it really makes sense

1163
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:37,819
to

1164
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:39,400
start looking into this sooner

1165
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,849
rather than later i guess i'm

1166
00:28:40,849 --> 00:28:42,210
curious what are you guys

1167
00:28:42,339 --> 00:28:45,079
focusing your your bandwidth on

1168
00:28:45,079 --> 00:28:47,619
right now that would prevent you

1169
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:49,009
guys from doing something that

1170
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:49,930
would get you more calls on

1171
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:53,130
calendar right once again now i'm

1172
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:55,339
questioning their priorities as

1173
00:28:55,339 --> 00:28:55,660
opposed

1174
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:56,849
to the timing of it because i've

1175
00:28:56,849 --> 00:28:57,990
already kind of gone the first

1176
00:28:57,990 --> 00:28:59,099
route which is make sure that

1177
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:00,569
they're confident and then remind

1178
00:29:00,569 --> 00:29:03,069
them of our timeline to deliver

1179
00:29:03,069 --> 00:29:05,490
results versus their timeline in

1180
00:29:05,619 --> 00:29:07,759
terms of when they want to see

1181
00:29:07,769 --> 00:29:10,029
results right now finally uh

1182
00:29:10,029 --> 00:29:12,619
uncertainty and let me pause this

1183
00:29:12,619 --> 00:29:12,779
here

1184
00:29:12,819 --> 00:29:14,130
so getting into fear and

1185
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:15,960
uncertainty the most difficult

1186
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,809
part about handling uncertainty

1187
00:29:17,869 --> 00:29:18,180
objections

1188
00:29:18,259 --> 00:29:19,210
we'll start there is getting used

1189
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:20,279
to calling out in the first place

1190
00:29:20,279 --> 00:29:21,420
talked about this a little bit

1191
00:29:21,539 --> 00:29:22,740
earlier but once we build that

1192
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:24,109
muscle not being afraid to have

1193
00:29:24,109 --> 00:29:25,579
uncomfortable conversations

1194
00:29:25,579 --> 00:29:25,730
because

1195
00:29:25,779 --> 00:29:26,730
that's what we get paid to do

1196
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:28,769
right and if you're not a closer

1197
00:29:28,769 --> 00:29:30,940
but you're doing founder-led sales

1198
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:31,140
like

1199
00:29:31,289 --> 00:29:32,670
that is where all the gains come

1200
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:34,089
from we need to welcome that we

1201
00:29:34,089 --> 00:29:35,900
need to get comfortable with it

1202
00:29:36,019 --> 00:29:38,809
trust me it is a huge huge payoff

1203
00:29:38,809 --> 00:29:40,359
if you do then it's pretty

1204
00:29:40,359 --> 00:29:41,819
straightforward once you do that

1205
00:29:41,819 --> 00:29:42,140
we need

1206
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:44,259
to quantify their uncertainty

1207
00:29:44,259 --> 00:29:46,450
though which can be done because

1208
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:50,130
uncertainty is is very qualitative

1209
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:50,220
as

1210
00:29:50,339 --> 00:29:51,369
opposed to quantitative so

1211
00:29:51,369 --> 00:29:52,710
something that we can do here and

1212
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:53,900
once again this is one of those

1213
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:54,140
sales

1214
00:29:54,259 --> 00:29:55,609
tactics that you've probably seen

1215
00:29:55,609 --> 00:29:56,690
before is quantify their

1216
00:29:56,690 --> 00:29:58,059
uncertainty which can be done

1217
00:29:58,059 --> 00:29:58,380
through one

1218
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:59,859
through ten time check and then

1219
00:29:59,859 --> 00:30:01,500
isolate why they're not 100

1220
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,180
confident this will work for them

1221
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:04,380
if we can

1222
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:05,890
get them to a point where they

1223
00:30:05,890 --> 00:30:07,559
want to do it that's where fear is

1224
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:09,099
going to come in but a quick

1225
00:30:09,099 --> 00:30:09,400
example

1226
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:11,220
of a temp check is okay cool man

1227
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:13,039
and i know that uh you know this

1228
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:15,019
is something that you think you

1229
00:30:15,019 --> 00:30:15,049
may

1230
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:16,170
want to do but it doesn't seem

1231
00:30:16,170 --> 00:30:17,630
like you're 100 of the way there i

1232
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:19,259
guess on a scale of one to ten

1233
00:30:19,259 --> 00:30:20,220
zero being

1234
00:30:20,329 --> 00:30:21,849
gave me off this call i never want

1235
00:30:21,849 --> 00:30:23,430
to see dan again to ten being yes

1236
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:24,460
this is absolutely the

1237
00:30:24,579 --> 00:30:25,759
decision that my business needs to

1238
00:30:25,759 --> 00:30:26,990
make where would you say you're at

1239
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:27,980
a lot of times they're going to

1240
00:30:28,089 --> 00:30:30,220
give you a seven everybody likes a

1241
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:32,539
seven okay cool well that's that's

1242
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:34,460
not a zero um i guess why so high

1243
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,940
is the seven uh you know you guys

1244
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:37,359
do some good stuff i i like that

1245
00:30:37,359 --> 00:30:39,099
you're doing more volume than i've

1246
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:40,299
ever done i like the fact that you

1247
00:30:40,299 --> 00:30:41,579
got some case studies with similar

1248
00:30:41,609 --> 00:30:42,779
businesses once again it's the

1249
00:30:42,779 --> 00:30:43,099
same

1250
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:44,400
stuff right they're they're

1251
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,869
appealing to the logical reason

1252
00:30:45,869 --> 00:30:48,220
that they'd want to do it then

1253
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:49,099
let's attack

1254
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:50,769
that gap okay cool i mean that i

1255
00:30:50,769 --> 00:30:52,660
would i would agree with all those

1256
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:54,299
reasons so i guess if we can

1257
00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:55,970
get you extra salt and you

1258
00:30:55,970 --> 00:30:58,079
highlighted abc reasons which i

1259
00:30:58,089 --> 00:31:00,059
agree with i guess what's holding

1260
00:31:00,059 --> 00:31:00,380
you back

1261
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:01,759
from being a ten and that's where

1262
00:31:01,769 --> 00:31:03,269
the real objection comes out right

1263
00:31:03,269 --> 00:31:04,859
so we can solve the objection from

1264
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:06,759
there but if it's not one of these

1265
00:31:06,779 --> 00:31:08,680
objections it's just generally

1266
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:10,619
fear we're still not able to do it

1267
00:31:10,619 --> 00:31:10,779
we

1268
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:13,869
can just ask them like hey mr

1269
00:31:13,869 --> 00:31:17,230
prospect i gotta ask is it is it

1270
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:20,299
the value or the price here

1271
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:23,630
what's holding you back we'll make

1272
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:26,460
this a yes right but if i ask them

1273
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:27,819
what's if it's a value

1274
00:31:27,859 --> 00:31:30,349
or the price a lot of times people

1275
00:31:30,349 --> 00:31:32,680
are just going to say it's it's

1276
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:35,099
the value okay well you know where

1277
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:36,720
aren't you seeing the value here

1278
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,400
we kind of talked about the return

1279
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,460
or it's the price you know the

1280
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:41,900
the price is usually what they

1281
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,450
default to so sometimes they say

1282
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:44,700
value or price but usually

1283
00:31:44,809 --> 00:31:46,279
even if you cover the value and

1284
00:31:46,289 --> 00:31:48,140
start to handle that objection but

1285
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:49,980
then it comes down to the price

1286
00:31:50,019 --> 00:31:51,769
it's just they're fearful of

1287
00:31:51,769 --> 00:31:53,740
parting with the cash that's it

1288
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:57,099
right so now it's fear that

1289
00:31:57,099 --> 00:31:57,660
they're right

1290
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:59,279
at the edge but they don't want to

1291
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:00,900
make that jump we can get into the

1292
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,539
problem symptom dynamic which

1293
00:32:02,579 --> 00:32:03,910
is probably something that you may

1294
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:05,089
have seen before or this is all

1295
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:06,619
new to you guys but essentially

1296
00:32:07,529 --> 00:32:09,119
them being confident they'll see a

1297
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:10,599
return on something and still

1298
00:32:10,599 --> 00:32:11,900
being fearful of it is

1299
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:13,789
is doing it is not the problem

1300
00:32:13,789 --> 00:32:15,849
right the problem is they don't

1301
00:32:15,849 --> 00:32:17,099
have enough money

1302
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:18,470
right so if we've covered the

1303
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:20,089
value part and they're confident

1304
00:32:20,089 --> 00:32:21,420
that they're going to see a return

1305
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:21,579
on

1306
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:23,279
this and they're still fearful

1307
00:32:23,289 --> 00:32:24,880
that's not the problem it's a

1308
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,660
symptom of the problem them not

1309
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:28,299
making enough

1310
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:30,329
money causing them to believe that

1311
00:32:30,329 --> 00:32:32,119
our price is too much that's the

1312
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:33,700
problem them not making money

1313
00:32:33,849 --> 00:32:36,369
right so so that's it i i would

1314
00:32:36,369 --> 00:32:37,930
just typically open up this

1315
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:39,900
conversation by asking them hey

1316
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:40,059
man

1317
00:32:40,099 --> 00:32:42,200
i guess you know you seeing the

1318
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,539
value in this and agreeing that

1319
00:32:44,539 --> 00:32:46,140
this will work for your business

1320
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:46,299
to

1321
00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:48,700
get you guys to xyz gold but still

1322
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:51,069
thinking this is too much or too

1323
00:32:51,069 --> 00:32:53,500
expensive i gotta ask do you think

1324
00:32:53,609 --> 00:32:55,059
that's the problem or the symptom

1325
00:32:55,059 --> 00:32:56,460
and they'll usually be pretty

1326
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:57,980
confused it'll be like i guess

1327
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:58,380
it's a

1328
00:32:58,500 --> 00:32:59,730
problem or symptom what are you

1329
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:01,119
talking about hey do you mind if i

1330
00:33:01,119 --> 00:33:02,619
share some thoughts this is just

1331
00:33:02,619 --> 00:33:02,769
like

1332
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:03,750
permission-based something you

1333
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:04,650
mind if i share some thoughts on

1334
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:07,339
that yeah just based on what i've

1335
00:33:07,339 --> 00:33:07,579
seen

1336
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:08,400
working with a bunch of other

1337
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:10,660
businesses if you think that this

1338
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:12,859
is going to be a good fit for your

1339
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:14,160
business if you think that it's

1340
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,410
going to get you to the goal and

1341
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:16,940
you see the return right because

1342
00:33:17,049 --> 00:33:18,480
this isn't going to be expensive

1343
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,079
in comparison to this return that

1344
00:33:20,079 --> 00:33:21,579
we're both confident that you'd

1345
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:23,480
get and you still not being able

1346
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,670
to make that investment that's not

1347
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,400
the problem the problem is

1348
00:33:27,529 --> 00:33:28,859
that you're not making enough

1349
00:33:28,859 --> 00:33:30,180
money or the problem is that

1350
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:31,900
you've never done anything like

1351
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:32,380
this before

1352
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:33,990
so just fear is blocking it you

1353
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:35,730
thinking that this is too much or

1354
00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:37,099
too expensive that's just a

1355
00:33:37,099 --> 00:33:37,660
symptom

1356
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:38,930
of the problem would you agree

1357
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:40,430
once again more permission-based

1358
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:41,660
selling like i'm getting them to

1359
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:41,970
buy

1360
00:33:42,019 --> 00:33:43,559
and they're starting to come to my

1361
00:33:43,569 --> 00:33:45,109
side of the table so the question

1362
00:33:45,109 --> 00:33:46,460
is how does someone become

1363
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,259
the person that thinks your price

1364
00:33:48,259 --> 00:33:50,009
isn't too much it's by making the

1365
00:33:50,009 --> 00:33:51,740
commitment to do something like

1366
00:33:51,849 --> 00:33:53,380
this right and at this point we

1367
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:55,200
want to acknowledge the fact that

1368
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:57,269
hey this is scary i agree it's

1369
00:33:57,269 --> 00:33:57,809
it's a

1370
00:33:57,930 --> 00:33:59,109
little like i remember the first

1371
00:33:59,109 --> 00:34:00,289
time when i made an investment

1372
00:34:00,289 --> 00:34:01,579
like this it is scary you can even

1373
00:34:01,579 --> 00:34:01,740
talk

1374
00:34:01,859 --> 00:34:03,670
about making an investment in

1375
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,769
client ascension if you want but

1376
00:34:05,769 --> 00:34:08,780
you also because it's our moral

1377
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:09,340
and ethical

1378
00:34:09,449 --> 00:34:10,780
responsibility to get these guys

1379
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:12,030
over the finish line if we both

1380
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:13,260
agree that it can help them

1381
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:15,210
we also want to be real with them

1382
00:34:15,210 --> 00:34:17,059
by letting them know that that

1383
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:19,079
problem won't get solved unless

1384
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:19,260
they

1385
00:34:19,369 --> 00:34:20,869
make a decision based on the

1386
00:34:20,869 --> 00:34:22,900
return that they think they'll see

1387
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:24,860
right it's like in this scenario

1388
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:25,260
the only

1389
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:26,840
way to get from point a to point b

1390
00:34:26,849 --> 00:34:28,519
is to make that jump that they're

1391
00:34:28,519 --> 00:34:30,139
afraid of making right now and

1392
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:31,510
it's never going to feel like the

1393
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:32,780
right time this is where we get

1394
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:34,219
real with them it's it's never

1395
00:34:34,219 --> 00:34:34,300
going to

1396
00:34:34,409 --> 00:34:36,099
feel like the right time to go

1397
00:34:36,099 --> 00:34:37,989
through that transformation

1398
00:34:37,989 --> 00:34:39,820
because the first time you do

1399
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:41,849
anything even if you're a kid

1400
00:34:41,849 --> 00:34:44,059
riding a bike it's going to feel

1401
00:34:44,059 --> 00:34:46,940
foreign right so if we're real

1402
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:47,099
with

1403
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:48,659
them in that scenario we kind of

1404
00:34:48,659 --> 00:34:50,219
break down the problem symptom

1405
00:34:50,219 --> 00:34:51,659
dynamic and then we get into the

1406
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:54,300
point where it's just like if we

1407
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,929
both see the value in this is you

1408
00:34:56,929 --> 00:34:59,579
thinking that this is too much is

1409
00:34:59,579 --> 00:34:59,739
that

1410
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:01,300
the problem or the symptom we

1411
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,059
agree that it's a symptom okay so

1412
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:05,559
i guess in this scenario if we

1413
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:07,150
want to become the person that

1414
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:08,900
sees something that will be a good

1415
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:10,610
investment for the business and

1416
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:10,699
they

1417
00:35:10,809 --> 00:35:12,619
see the return in it what do they

1418
00:35:12,639 --> 00:35:13,900
do in this scenario

1419
00:35:14,019 --> 00:35:16,170
right and i even wrote out a

1420
00:35:16,179 --> 00:35:18,079
question here what's the person

1421
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:18,929
that makes investments that

1422
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:19,849
are good for the business

1423
00:35:19,849 --> 00:35:21,059
regardless of if the number seems

1424
00:35:21,059 --> 00:35:22,219
to hire not doing the scenario

1425
00:35:24,969 --> 00:35:26,650
the person they do it okay what

1426
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:29,099
person you want to be john that's

1427
00:35:29,099 --> 00:35:30,510
a little bit of like

1428
00:35:30,579 --> 00:35:31,860
an identity close and that's a

1429
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:33,289
little bit more on the emotional

1430
00:35:33,289 --> 00:35:34,929
side but once again it works so

1431
00:35:35,059 --> 00:35:37,099
what's the person that makes

1432
00:35:37,099 --> 00:35:39,619
investments that are good for the

1433
00:35:39,619 --> 00:35:41,329
business regardless of

1434
00:35:41,449 --> 00:35:43,980
if the number seems too high in

1435
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:48,780
the scenario do they do it right

1436
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:49,730
i've closed a good amount of

1437
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:50,219
people

1438
00:35:50,329 --> 00:35:51,900
with that one as well so let me

1439
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,739
know if this makes sense uh all a

1440
00:35:53,739 --> 00:35:55,019
through z you guys are going to

1441
00:35:55,019 --> 00:35:55,099
get

1442
00:35:55,210 --> 00:35:56,449
this document of course but down

1443
00:35:56,449 --> 00:35:57,900
to have any questions because once

1444
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:58,860
again i would rather you

1445
00:35:58,969 --> 00:36:00,889
guys understand this as opposed to

1446
00:36:00,889 --> 00:36:02,570
memorize hundreds of canned

1447
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:04,940
objection comebacks because if you

1448
00:36:05,059 --> 00:36:06,610
understand this stuff from first

1449
00:36:06,610 --> 00:36:08,329
principle trust me you're going to

1450
00:36:08,329 --> 00:36:09,329
get really good at just

1451
00:36:09,449 --> 00:36:10,679
diagnosing and just figuring out

1452
00:36:10,679 --> 00:36:11,519
okay it's it's pretty

1453
00:36:11,519 --> 00:36:13,579
straightforward let's displace it

1454
00:36:13,579 --> 00:36:13,980
figure out

1455
00:36:14,019 --> 00:36:15,320
if these guys actually think they

1456
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,500
can get the result okay they do

1457
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:18,059
think they can get the result

1458
00:36:18,059 --> 00:36:18,460
great

1459
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:19,590
now let's isolate that partner

1460
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:20,809
objection now let's isolate that

1461
00:36:20,809 --> 00:36:22,280
timing objection now let's isolate

1462
00:36:22,409 --> 00:36:23,849
that fear objection and let's go

1463
00:36:23,849 --> 00:36:25,480
from there with these strategies

1464
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,940
laid out below i'm gonna wrap

1465
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:27,099
there

1466
00:36:27,139 --> 00:36:28,170
guys hit me up if you have any

1467
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:29,539
questions of course but hopefully

1468
00:36:29,539 --> 00:36:30,710
you guys got some value in this

1469
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:31,340
one peace
