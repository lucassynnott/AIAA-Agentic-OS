1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,639
What's going on guys in this video

2
00:00:01,639 --> 00:00:02,560
we're going to be talking about

3
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,080
something I call the perfect flow

4
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:05,309
Conversation method because if

5
00:00:05,309 --> 00:00:06,679
you've ever had a sales call where

6
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,339
you feel like for whatever reason

7
00:00:08,339 --> 00:00:09,740
you and the prospect are at odds

8
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:11,349
It's not super productive.

9
00:00:11,349 --> 00:00:12,919
They're taking control of the

10
00:00:12,919 --> 00:00:14,539
conversation or it's just not

11
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:16,620
Progressing in a direction that's

12
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:18,129
going to lead to a sale.

13
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,769
This is exactly where this tactic

14
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:20,559
can be deployed

15
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:21,929
a lot of it is simply returning

16
00:00:21,929 --> 00:00:23,570
questions with a question because

17
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,449
as the sales guy we generally want

18
00:00:25,449 --> 00:00:26,850
to be the one leading the question

19
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:27,019
and

20
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:28,739
There's a reason why in a lot of

21
00:00:28,739 --> 00:00:30,039
famous courtroom movies the

22
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,199
lawyers like i'm the one asking

23
00:00:31,329 --> 00:00:32,020
the questions here

24
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:33,000
And that's because the guy who's

25
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,270
asking the question is the one

26
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:36,240
who's in control at the end of the

27
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:36,460
day

28
00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:37,509
And before I get into it

29
00:00:37,549 --> 00:00:38,539
I want to shout out her mosey

30
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:39,640
because he has a great video on

31
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:39,920
this

32
00:00:39,929 --> 00:00:41,130
And you could see a lot of the

33
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:42,520
comments are kind of like people

34
00:00:42,579 --> 00:00:43,200
who are in my boat

35
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:44,689
I've been doing this for years.

36
00:00:44,689 --> 00:00:46,280
My first sales job had another

37
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:47,710
term for this her mosey's

38
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:50,049
Term for this is the triple a

39
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:52,530
framework, which is acknowledge

40
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:54,149
associate and ask and i'm going to

41
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:55,189
break down exactly what that means

42
00:00:55,329 --> 00:00:56,450
But what I highly recommend

43
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:57,770
checking out this video because

44
00:00:57,770 --> 00:00:58,979
i've watched so much her mosey

45
00:00:58,979 --> 00:00:59,420
content

46
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:01,590
This is probably my favorite video

47
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:03,539
When it comes to sales that he's

48
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:03,979
put out

49
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:05,920
Now this conversation method of

50
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,260
reframing questions is for when

51
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:09,019
prospects are being difficult or

52
00:01:09,019 --> 00:01:10,340
asking a question that would move

53
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:11,450
them further away from the sale

54
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:12,900
Essentially, they're giving you

55
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,329
anything other than a yes, which

56
00:01:14,329 --> 00:01:15,780
if you had sales calls happens

57
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:17,040
All the time

58
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:18,719
This will allow you to get back

59
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:20,500
into a productive not combative

60
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:21,859
conversation with the prospect so

61
00:01:21,859 --> 00:01:23,519
that it makes sense to ask for the

62
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:23,670
sale

63
00:01:23,769 --> 00:01:25,010
And the simple equation that I

64
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:26,310
talk about the simple equation

65
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:27,709
that her mosey talks about is more

66
00:01:27,709 --> 00:01:27,909
asks

67
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:29,569
Equals more sales.

68
00:01:29,569 --> 00:01:30,780
So it's getting us to a point

69
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,790
where it's natural to ask for the

70
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,040
sale because once again

71
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:36,010
More asks equals more sales.

72
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:37,560
So the perfect flow conversation

73
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,049
method.

74
00:01:38,049 --> 00:01:38,540
What is it?

75
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:40,790
Oftentimes you got to realize that

76
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:41,819
prospects are just asking

77
00:01:41,819 --> 00:01:43,250
questions because that's what they

78
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:44,489
think they're supposed to do on a

79
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:45,040
sales call

80
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:47,530
If that's the case if they're just

81
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:48,420
asking a question because they

82
00:01:48,459 --> 00:01:49,409
feel like they're supposed to ask

83
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:50,540
a question at this point

84
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:52,359
Answering the question is

85
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:53,829
sometimes a lot of times a

86
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,189
thankless exercise

87
00:01:55,209 --> 00:01:56,780
So don't be afraid to pause

88
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,510
And think for a second about what

89
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:00,370
type of answer they're looking for

90
00:02:00,379 --> 00:02:01,400
in the first place

91
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:02,969
Because if there's no ideal answer

92
00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:04,310
that they'd want to hear just

93
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:05,540
answer their question with a

94
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:06,019
question

95
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:08,870
Hey, i'm i'm curious.

96
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:11,680
Um, do you guys have this sock to

97
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,979
compliance?

98
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:14,250
Um

99
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:17,219
Not quite sure on that.

100
00:02:17,259 --> 00:02:18,400
Do you mind if I ask why you're

101
00:02:18,449 --> 00:02:18,780
asking?

102
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,270
Oh, I just you know, I've heard

103
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:22,539
about it from another company.

104
00:02:22,669 --> 00:02:23,460
Is that something you guys

105
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:23,740
require?

106
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,060
Um, no

107
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:26,400
Okay, cool.

108
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,659
It was a useless question.

109
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:28,599
They just asked it because it

110
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:29,379
popped in their head

111
00:02:29,389 --> 00:02:31,319
I don't need to answer it and go

112
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:32,889
on a long diatribe and try to, you

113
00:02:32,889 --> 00:02:33,139
know

114
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:35,099
Get combative and overcome

115
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:36,310
whatever objection that they may

116
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:37,300
have or I think they have a lot of

117
00:02:37,349 --> 00:02:37,520
times

118
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:38,379
I can just return the question

119
00:02:38,379 --> 00:02:39,379
with a question now

120
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:41,439
Other times prospects are asking

121
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:42,900
questions or making a comment

122
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,430
because they're trying to put you

123
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:45,159
in a tough spot

124
00:02:45,169 --> 00:02:46,879
Or politely tell you no for now

125
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:48,400
now what I mean by put you in a

126
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,639
tough spot is

127
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:51,159
a lot of people just naturally

128
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:52,360
have sales resistance

129
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:53,710
So they're trying to put them in a

130
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:55,490
situation where them at the end of

131
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:57,469
the call saying okay, i'm going to

132
00:02:57,479 --> 00:02:57,909
think about it

133
00:02:57,930 --> 00:02:59,449
I'm take the information just send

134
00:02:59,449 --> 00:03:00,520
me over an email and make a

135
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,439
decision makes more sense, right?

136
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:04,469
Very natural that is okay.

137
00:03:04,469 --> 00:03:05,599
It's just part of sales

138
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:07,439
If prospects didn't need to change

139
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:09,139
their perspective or be sold we

140
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,800
want to have sales calls in this

141
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,699
case though

142
00:03:11,969 --> 00:03:13,490
Whenever this is what they're

143
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:14,599
doing right there

144
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:15,479
They're asking a question or

145
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:16,509
making a comment because they're

146
00:03:16,509 --> 00:03:17,550
trying to put you in a tough spot

147
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:18,620
or politely tell you for now

148
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:20,930
Or no for now we want to implement

149
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:22,379
this perfect flow conversation

150
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:22,930
method.

151
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:23,840
So let's get into it

152
00:03:23,849 --> 00:03:25,469
The first step is acknowledging

153
00:03:25,469 --> 00:03:27,129
their question and lowering that

154
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:28,680
sales resistance, right?

155
00:03:28,949 --> 00:03:30,189
Because that's kind of the impetus

156
00:03:30,189 --> 00:03:31,400
for them having that question in

157
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:31,969
the first place

158
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:33,210
So a lot of people simply don't

159
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:34,530
want to make decisions on the call

160
00:03:34,539 --> 00:03:35,729
because it's outside of their

161
00:03:35,729 --> 00:03:36,409
comfort zone

162
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:37,900
And they don't like being hard

163
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,020
closed at the same time

164
00:03:39,069 --> 00:03:40,689
No, one likes feeling like they're

165
00:03:40,689 --> 00:03:41,659
being unreasonable

166
00:03:41,669 --> 00:03:43,830
If you've ever had a girlfriend a

167
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:46,050
significant other you guys kind of

168
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:47,430
know if you treat their question

169
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:48,719
as they're being unreasonable

170
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,270
Even if it is an unreasonable

171
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:51,879
question, they're going to freak

172
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:52,240
out.

173
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,659
We don't want that prospects are

174
00:03:53,689 --> 00:03:54,210
the same way

175
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,439
For example, if someone says can I

176
00:03:56,439 --> 00:03:58,680
think about this instead of saying

177
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,069
no or

178
00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:00,810
Why would you need to think about

179
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:01,120
this?

180
00:04:01,389 --> 00:04:03,360
Which tonality is really

181
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,639
important, right?

182
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:05,990
Which would make you sound like a

183
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:07,159
dick or like they're not being

184
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:07,689
reasonable

185
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:10,229
You'd want to start by addressing

186
00:04:10,229 --> 00:04:11,370
this or you'd want to start

187
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:12,490
addressing this by saying of

188
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:12,800
course

189
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:14,280
Totally normal to want to think

190
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,370
about it as much as you need to

191
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:16,600
make the best decision for your

192
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:17,079
business

193
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,180
And that's going to once again,

194
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,839
it's going to make them feel heard

195
00:04:20,889 --> 00:04:22,089
Acknowledged and it's going to

196
00:04:22,089 --> 00:04:23,389
lower that sales resistance,

197
00:04:23,389 --> 00:04:23,779
right?

198
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:25,009
So instead of saying well, what do

199
00:04:25,009 --> 00:04:26,199
you need to think about or no, you

200
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:27,069
can't think about it

201
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,040
We we want people to take action.

202
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,019
We want to make a decision on the

203
00:04:31,019 --> 00:04:31,230
call

204
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,800
I can just lay back say yeah, of

205
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,540
course, man

206
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:35,279
It's totally normal to think about

207
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:36,750
it as much as you'd want to make

208
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:37,850
the best decision for your

209
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:38,259
business

210
00:04:38,269 --> 00:04:39,850
And then we'll get into the rest.

211
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:41,120
But once again, it's a very

212
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:41,920
important step

213
00:04:42,189 --> 00:04:44,089
and it also helps us

214
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:46,860
Because it doesn't make us seem

215
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,839
like we need them to close

216
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:51,439
Right the person who needs the

217
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,300
least usually gets what they want

218
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:55,120
So after we say something like

219
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,420
this to start it off to

220
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:58,170
acknowledge what they've said

221
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:00,110
The second step is relating them

222
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:01,660
or as her mozy talks about

223
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,220
associating them with somebody

224
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,569
that has already closed on this

225
00:05:04,569 --> 00:05:05,439
offer previously

226
00:05:05,449 --> 00:05:07,110
So a prospect will often say

227
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:08,970
things that'll make them sound

228
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,540
like they don't need you

229
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:11,730
But if we can relate their

230
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:13,139
situation to someone that has

231
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,800
worked with you and seen success

232
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:16,100
We've just taken a trap or an

233
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,720
objection and given them another

234
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,439
reason to buy

235
00:05:18,459 --> 00:05:21,139
So a good example of this is let's

236
00:05:21,139 --> 00:05:21,449
say

237
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:23,920
Selling

238
00:05:24,189 --> 00:05:27,199
Personal tax strategy

239
00:05:27,329 --> 00:05:29,779
And they have somebody who

240
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:31,529
Is an accountant that they've

241
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,069
worked with for a long time

242
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:34,120
They're like actually yeah, I mean

243
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,689
i've got an accountant and you

244
00:05:35,689 --> 00:05:37,019
know, he kind of helps you with my

245
00:05:37,019 --> 00:05:37,240
taxes

246
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:38,850
And I was to reframe that by

247
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:39,779
saying hey

248
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,250
No worries at all.

249
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:41,889
Sounds like you got a good

250
00:05:41,889 --> 00:05:42,639
relationship with the guy

251
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:43,839
Once again lowering social

252
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:44,279
distance

253
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:45,589
I would say actually a lot of our

254
00:05:45,589 --> 00:05:46,180
best clients

255
00:05:46,449 --> 00:05:47,730
Already have an accountant that

256
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:49,259
they've worked with for a while

257
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:50,839
Just for the filing aspects.

258
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:52,060
It's pretty low cost where we

259
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,410
really come in and specialize

260
00:05:53,709 --> 00:05:54,490
is

261
00:05:54,529 --> 00:05:56,139
Blah blah blah, right?

262
00:05:56,139 --> 00:05:57,800
So i'm already kind of associating

263
00:05:57,910 --> 00:05:59,449
them with somebody else and we'll

264
00:05:59,449 --> 00:06:00,740
get to the third part of that

265
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:01,790
Which is essentially just

266
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:02,829
attacking the frame of the

267
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:03,259
question

268
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:03,720
but

269
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:05,399
Continuing on the same example.

270
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:06,860
I wrote above if we were to add in

271
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:08,160
a lot of our best clients are the

272
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,079
ones who had the most questions

273
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:09,889
before getting started

274
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:10,720
So they were ready to hit the

275
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,160
ground running after they said I

276
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,399
need to think about it

277
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:14,550
Cool.

278
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:15,790
Now once again, i've just

279
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,160
associated them mr.

280
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:18,649
I need to think about it with our

281
00:06:18,649 --> 00:06:19,459
best clients

282
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:21,079
So all of a sudden this trap they

283
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:21,379
laid

284
00:06:21,389 --> 00:06:22,949
I've just taken that and turn it

285
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:24,470
into another reason that they

286
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:25,439
would want to buy

287
00:06:25,709 --> 00:06:27,129
Right, so we've related them to

288
00:06:27,129 --> 00:06:28,490
our best clients which would make

289
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:29,589
them question the fear or doubt

290
00:06:29,629 --> 00:06:30,480
that they're feeling

291
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,230
That made them ask the question in

292
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,079
the first place

293
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:35,550
Right now, like I said a lot of

294
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:37,069
this is just returning a question

295
00:06:37,069 --> 00:06:37,800
with a question

296
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:39,050
So it's not done yet.

297
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:40,399
This is the third and final step

298
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:41,319
which is really important

299
00:06:41,329 --> 00:06:42,879
And that third and final step is

300
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:44,269
to ask them a question that

301
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:46,139
challenges the frame of their

302
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:46,730
question

303
00:06:47,029 --> 00:06:49,149
Right, so her mosey says ask or

304
00:06:49,149 --> 00:06:51,360
attack the frame of their question

305
00:06:51,379 --> 00:06:53,420
Now the reason why we want to do

306
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:53,819
this

307
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:55,870
And finish with a question because

308
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:57,769
one people can't disagree with a

309
00:06:57,769 --> 00:06:58,399
question

310
00:06:58,410 --> 00:06:59,519
So we're not going to lose the

311
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:01,139
sale right then and there and then

312
00:07:01,139 --> 00:07:01,360
two

313
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:02,449
It's a chance to get them to

314
00:07:02,509 --> 00:07:03,569
change their perspective

315
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:04,949
Maybe they'll realize there's a

316
00:07:04,949 --> 00:07:06,680
pointless question and three we

317
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,750
stay in control

318
00:07:07,769 --> 00:07:09,480
By asking the question right so

319
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,319
continuing on that last example

320
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:12,980
If we added on what other

321
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:14,509
questions did you have to

322
00:07:14,509 --> 00:07:15,920
determine if this is a fit?

323
00:07:15,939 --> 00:07:18,500
Now we're back in the sale, right?

324
00:07:18,509 --> 00:07:20,079
So I just took a guy who said

325
00:07:20,089 --> 00:07:21,550
Can I think about this and instead

326
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:22,959
of saying well, what do you need

327
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:25,079
to think about or no?

328
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:27,029
You can't think about it and I

329
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:28,300
said yeah, of course totally

330
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:28,560
normal

331
00:07:28,569 --> 00:07:29,420
I want to think about as much as

332
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,389
you need to make the best decision

333
00:07:30,389 --> 00:07:31,000
for your business

334
00:07:31,009 --> 00:07:32,360
I mean honestly a lot of our best

335
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,449
clients were the ones who had the

336
00:07:33,449 --> 00:07:34,720
most questions before getting

337
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:35,139
started

338
00:07:35,149 --> 00:07:36,379
So they're ready to hit the ground

339
00:07:36,379 --> 00:07:36,720
running

340
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:37,439
I'm curious.

341
00:07:37,449 --> 00:07:39,060
What other questions did you have

342
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,500
to determine if this was a fit?

343
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:43,089
Now we're back in the

344
00:07:43,089 --> 00:07:44,540
conversation, right?

345
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:46,420
Maybe they ask a question that we

346
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:47,779
have a better answer to

347
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:49,720
Or maybe they tell you they want

348
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,540
to think about it off the call

349
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:52,550
Now we can start handling that

350
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:53,560
objection specifically

351
00:07:53,579 --> 00:07:55,439
The best way to keep the prospect

352
00:07:55,449 --> 00:07:57,259
from getting annoyed here is to

353
00:07:57,259 --> 00:07:58,779
pay attention to our tonality

354
00:07:59,050 --> 00:07:59,379
Right?

355
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:00,620
So this will save us in terms of

356
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:01,720
being able to stay into the

357
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,310
conversation

358
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:03,410
Get closer to a point where it

359
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:04,620
makes sense to ask for the close

360
00:08:04,629 --> 00:08:06,050
But when we're doing this like I

361
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:07,800
talked about tonality is important

362
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:09,199
We want it to be upbeat and

363
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:09,740
curious

364
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,089
I think what her mosey says in the

365
00:08:11,089 --> 00:08:12,089
video is you want to have

366
00:08:12,089 --> 00:08:13,019
childlike curiosity

367
00:08:13,129 --> 00:08:15,220
So that's really important because

368
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,819
I can say of course totally normal

369
00:08:16,819 --> 00:08:17,660
want to think about it

370
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:18,709
A lot of our best clients were

371
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,959
they're honestly the ones who had

372
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:21,420
the most questions the sales

373
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:22,019
process man

374
00:08:22,029 --> 00:08:23,360
I'm curious what other questions

375
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,439
do you have to determine if this

376
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:24,740
is a fit

377
00:08:25,009 --> 00:08:26,240
Versus

378
00:08:26,509 --> 00:08:30,579
Yeah, you could think about it

379
00:08:30,589 --> 00:08:32,179
It's it's normal I guess

380
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:34,440
To want to think about it to make

381
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,408
the best decision for your

382
00:08:35,408 --> 00:08:35,750
business

383
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:38,220
You know, I guess we've had other

384
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:40,000
clients that have asked questions

385
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,440
before what other questions do you

386
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:41,820
have man?

387
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,129
Like that's the latter tonality is

388
00:08:44,129 --> 00:08:45,120
horrible, right?

389
00:08:45,139 --> 00:08:46,580
The upbeat and curious that

390
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:48,690
childlike curiosity is going to be

391
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:50,450
super important for keeping

392
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:51,620
prospects to get annoyed

393
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:53,330
Because once again, we want to

394
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:54,759
seek to understand not to win

395
00:08:54,809 --> 00:08:56,940
If we master any if we master all

396
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,559
of this any question or comment

397
00:08:58,690 --> 00:08:59,889
that was designed to either delay

398
00:08:59,889 --> 00:09:00,200
things

399
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:01,970
Or move them further from the sale

400
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:03,730
can be turned back on the prospect

401
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,299
to get us back on track to having

402
00:09:05,299 --> 00:09:06,320
a productive conversation

403
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:07,840
So that we can ask for the sale by

404
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,779
doing this

405
00:09:08,789 --> 00:09:10,129
It makes it less awkward when we

406
00:09:10,129 --> 00:09:11,700
do ask for the sale and allows us

407
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,500
to make more asks and more asks

408
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,620
equals more sales

409
00:09:14,889 --> 00:09:15,980
Simple as that.

410
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:18,100
So just recapping this real quick

411
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,419
first step is to acknowledge your

412
00:09:19,419 --> 00:09:20,840
question and lower sales distance

413
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:22,440
The second step is relating them

414
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,919
with someone that has already

415
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:25,580
closed on this offer previously

416
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:27,659
Or if you guys haven't had any

417
00:09:27,659 --> 00:09:29,240
clients relating them with

418
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:29,940
somebody that

419
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:32,409
Would see good results for this

420
00:09:32,409 --> 00:09:32,899
offer

421
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:34,210
Right

422
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:36,100
So they they may think something

423
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:37,940
is a disqualifier when it's not

424
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:39,649
So that's a good situation where I

425
00:09:39,649 --> 00:09:40,679
want to relate them

426
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:42,419
To somebody that would still be a

427
00:09:42,419 --> 00:09:42,899
good fit

428
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:44,990
Like I said with the uh personal

429
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:47,120
taxes example, like it's okay

430
00:09:47,139 --> 00:09:48,539
If you work

431
00:09:48,809 --> 00:09:50,980
With an accountant, right?

432
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:52,250
And then the third and final step

433
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:53,779
is to ask them a question that

434
00:09:53,779 --> 00:09:54,759
challenges the frame of the

435
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:55,559
question because

436
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:57,340
One people can't disagree with the

437
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:57,830
question.

438
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:58,620
So we're not going to lose sale

439
00:09:58,620 --> 00:09:59,240
right then and there

440
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:00,659
Two it's a chance to get them to

441
00:10:00,659 --> 00:10:01,649
change their perspective.

442
00:10:01,669 --> 00:10:02,519
Maybe they'll realize it's a

443
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:03,620
pointless question and three

444
00:10:03,629 --> 00:10:05,559
We stay in control by asking the

445
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:06,350
questions.

446
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:07,730
So a really easy framework shout

447
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:09,000
out her mosey once again is just

448
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:10,120
that triple a framework

449
00:10:10,529 --> 00:10:11,120
acknowledge

450
00:10:11,389 --> 00:10:12,059
associate

451
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:13,929
Ask that's pretty much what we're

452
00:10:13,929 --> 00:10:14,659
talking about here.

453
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,980
I promise you it's something where

454
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,429
You need to work this muscle a

455
00:10:17,429 --> 00:10:18,779
little bit, but the more and more

456
00:10:18,779 --> 00:10:19,259
that you do it

457
00:10:19,529 --> 00:10:20,700
Anything that just seems like

458
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,200
they're trying to throw at you

459
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:24,340
In order to put you in a difficult

460
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,490
spot so that they can go through

461
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:28,149
their buying process as opposed to

462
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:29,690
going through your sales process

463
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:31,980
This is a perfect method to deploy

464
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,919
so that they can go through our

465
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:36,450
sales process as opposed to their

466
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:38,269
buying process, right?

467
00:10:38,269 --> 00:10:38,320
So

468
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:41,639
Acknowledge associate ask very

469
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:44,019
simple, but very very very useful

470
00:10:44,029 --> 00:10:45,389
So hopefully you guys got some

471
00:10:45,389 --> 00:10:46,779
value out of this once again would

472
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:48,129
recommend watching this video as

473
00:10:48,129 --> 00:10:48,379
well

474
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:51,179
But as a concept, this is a 10 out

475
00:10:51,179 --> 00:10:52,899
of 10 sales method in my opinion
