1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:01,659
Yo, what's going on guys?

2
00:00:01,659 --> 00:00:02,890
Super excited for this one because

3
00:00:02,899 --> 00:00:04,099
we're going to be getting into the

4
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:05,540
million dollar pitch architecture.

5
00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:06,620
And the reason why I call it that

6
00:00:06,679 --> 00:00:08,000
is because I've used the same

7
00:00:08,009 --> 00:00:09,519
pitch architecture to scale three

8
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:10,890
separate companies to over six

9
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:11,800
figures a month.

10
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:12,560
And

11
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:14,080
a pitch is something you're going

12
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,669
to work on continuously and change

13
00:00:15,669 --> 00:00:16,609
unless you have the

14
00:00:16,629 --> 00:00:17,649
perfect pitch and a super high

15
00:00:17,649 --> 00:00:18,829
close rate, but you're going to be

16
00:00:18,829 --> 00:00:20,000
changing it over and over again

17
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:21,920
based on customer feedback and how

18
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,640
these calls are going and where

19
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:24,960
your close rates at.

20
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:25,399
But

21
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:26,820
when you have a structure like

22
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,289
this, that iteration process

23
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:29,699
becomes so much easier because

24
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:29,859
you're

25
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:31,109
not just ripping it up from the

26
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:32,380
roots every single time you're

27
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:33,659
making a change, you're

28
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:35,060
building onto a process.

29
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:36,420
So when you have this pitch

30
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:38,350
architecture, not only is it

31
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:38,859
easier to

32
00:00:38,869 --> 00:00:40,359
make improvements, but it's much

33
00:00:40,359 --> 00:00:41,380
easier to reach a level of

34
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:42,770
consistency where it's like

35
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:44,990
most of these pitches are going

36
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:47,439
generally well, as opposed to one

37
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:49,100
pitch being a one out of 10,

38
00:00:49,109 --> 00:00:50,170
then another pitch being a 10 out

39
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:51,439
of 10, then a seven out of 10.

40
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:53,119
Like if we can get this right,

41
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:54,259
most of these pitches should be

42
00:00:54,289 --> 00:00:55,880
between an eight and 10 out of 10,

43
00:00:55,929 --> 00:00:56,340
right?

44
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,149
So now with the million

45
00:00:58,189 --> 00:00:59,520
dollar pitch architecture, I just

46
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,520
want to start this off with a

47
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:01,119
quick note.

48
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:01,859
And before I get into the

49
00:01:01,869 --> 00:01:03,219
quick note, actually, let's just

50
00:01:03,219 --> 00:01:04,349
go up to here to just start with

51
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:05,340
like the bare basics.

52
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:06,060
The goal of

53
00:01:06,069 --> 00:01:07,459
the pitch is to sell this prospect

54
00:01:07,459 --> 00:01:08,170
on what you do.

55
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:10,150
So of course, we're going to be

56
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:11,459
selling them on our

57
00:01:11,469 --> 00:01:13,180
offer, our specific service, but

58
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:14,780
it's also important that they're

59
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:16,620
sold on the mechanism that you

60
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:17,140
use,

61
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:17,519
right?

62
00:01:17,609 --> 00:01:18,689
If you're selling a cold email

63
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:20,140
offer, it's important that they're

64
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:20,939
sold on cold email

65
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:22,680
as a lead generation strategy.

66
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,209
If you're selling them on paid

67
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:27,620
ads, it's obviously important that

68
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:27,730
if

69
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:28,890
they want to work with a paid ads

70
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:30,129
agency, they're actually sold on

71
00:01:30,129 --> 00:01:31,040
advertising on meta,

72
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:31,840
for example.

73
00:01:31,989 --> 00:01:33,549
Then we want to tell them exactly

74
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:35,349
how we deliver our service to get

75
00:01:35,349 --> 00:01:36,379
them to their goals,

76
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:36,870
right?

77
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:38,290
Talking about this in the last

78
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:38,939
video a lot.

79
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,370
We want to pitch our service as

80
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:40,900
the straightest

81
00:01:40,909 --> 00:01:42,489
line from point A to point B, make

82
00:01:42,489 --> 00:01:43,670
sure there's clarity and

83
00:01:43,709 --> 00:01:45,359
excitement about the process,

84
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:47,129
about the next steps, help them

85
00:01:47,129 --> 00:01:48,989
visualize ROI and build momentum

86
00:01:48,989 --> 00:01:50,700
up until we ask for the sale.

87
00:01:50,709 --> 00:01:53,459
And I'll just add another note.

88
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:58,819
When you pitch, really pitch.

89
00:01:58,819 --> 00:02:03,159
Now, the reason why I'm saying

90
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:03,299
this

91
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:04,629
is because a lot of people will

92
00:02:04,629 --> 00:02:06,010
just almost sleepwalk through the

93
00:02:06,019 --> 00:02:06,400
pitch.

94
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,659
And I've talked about this in

95
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:08,800
previous videos before, like we're

96
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:09,849
leading these guys, whether we

97
00:02:09,849 --> 00:02:10,909
like them or not, if we're not

98
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:12,419
excited about what we're selling,

99
00:02:12,419 --> 00:02:13,870
how are they going to be excited?

100
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,159
If we don't have conviction,

101
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:16,849
if we're not just very like

102
00:02:16,849 --> 00:02:19,159
clearly believing in what we sell,

103
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:21,280
how are we supposed to transfer

104
00:02:21,289 --> 00:02:21,930
that belief?

105
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:23,210
And once again, I've probably

106
00:02:23,229 --> 00:02:24,580
brought up this Ramozi video in a

107
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:25,500
previous story, but he

108
00:02:25,509 --> 00:02:26,740
talks about how his worst pitch

109
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:27,969
was the one where he just really

110
00:02:27,969 --> 00:02:28,860
didn't pitch at all.

111
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:29,550
He just tried

112
00:02:29,569 --> 00:02:31,080
to casually walk through it, hope

113
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,620
people signed up and nobody did.

114
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,219
And if we do everything right in

115
00:02:34,229 --> 00:02:35,419
the discovery and in this first

116
00:02:35,419 --> 00:02:36,590
part here that I'm going to talk

117
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:37,939
about the expert perspective,

118
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:39,830
these guys are going to be wanting

119
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:40,939
to hear the pitch.

120
00:02:40,969 --> 00:02:42,310
The only time you kind of

121
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:43,460
sleepwalk and like

122
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:45,060
pitches in one ear and out the

123
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,870
other is where you're not really

124
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:48,280
sure you need this and you're

125
00:02:48,289 --> 00:02:49,710
not really sure that you want

126
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:50,139
this.

127
00:02:50,139 --> 00:02:51,810
But if we build momentum properly

128
00:02:51,819 --> 00:02:53,310
and follow this structure,

129
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:54,849
by the time we get into pitching,

130
00:02:54,849 --> 00:02:56,430
they're already going to have some

131
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:56,969
urgency.

132
00:02:56,969 --> 00:02:58,009
They're already going

133
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:59,610
to be sold on, you know, the

134
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:01,590
service, the concept of what we're

135
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:02,270
selling.

136
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:03,639
So when we're pitching

137
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:04,639
them that like, yeah, they're

138
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:05,699
going to want to be pitched.

139
00:03:05,699 --> 00:03:07,400
Now with the million dollar pitch

140
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:08,770
architecture, uh, also just one

141
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:10,050
more quick note before I get into

142
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:12,740
it, studies suggest that 65%

143
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:14,379
of people are visual learners.

144
00:03:14,379 --> 00:03:16,210
And I'd suggest that 99.9% of

145
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:18,819
people retain information better

146
00:03:18,819 --> 00:03:19,099
when they

147
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:20,050
have a visual to support what

148
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:20,740
they're hearing.

149
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:21,979
The point one, I don't know, it's,

150
00:03:21,979 --> 00:03:22,629
it's Helen Keller.

151
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:23,990
It's, it's blind people.

152
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:24,719
I don't know.

153
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:26,360
It's, it's everybody, right?

154
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,919
So you'll want to use visuals.

155
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:29,610
Easy ones for all of you to use.

156
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:31,539
If you're like, well, what visuals

157
00:03:31,539 --> 00:03:32,879
am I going to need, Dan?

158
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:33,080
Like,

159
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:34,219
am I going to have to create like

160
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:35,349
these, this, this whole big

161
00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:36,469
project is another thing.

162
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:36,990
No,

163
00:03:37,009 --> 00:03:38,300
a lot of you guys can use parts of

164
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:38,780
your VSL.

165
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:39,770
I do that with a lot of our

166
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:40,659
pitches, actually

167
00:03:40,669 --> 00:03:42,610
an ROI calculator and examples of

168
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:43,389
your work.

169
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:44,860
Super simple, right?

170
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,500
Even if you were to just start

171
00:03:46,509 --> 00:03:47,710
with parts of your VSL screen

172
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:49,129
sharing it, when you're talking

173
00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:50,460
about specific parts, and I'll

174
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:50,639
point

175
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:52,560
out where in an ROI calculator,

176
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,900
you're already, you know, 90% of

177
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,340
the way there, that extra 10% is

178
00:03:57,490 --> 00:03:58,849
obviously where a lot of the gains

179
00:03:58,849 --> 00:04:00,319
happen, but it's not too hard to

180
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,560
create those extra visuals,

181
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:03,030
especially if you have VSL, the

182
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:04,180
way that Daniel teaches.

183
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,879
And I also have the VSL doc up

184
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:06,060
here.

185
00:04:06,069 --> 00:04:07,289
So I'm going to be able to show

186
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:08,740
you where this stuff actually has

187
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:09,680
some parallels.

188
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,719
You can also

189
00:04:10,729 --> 00:04:11,490
make a slide deck.

190
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,120
Obviously people, people use pitch

191
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:13,490
decks.

192
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:14,669
I'm not married to one of the

193
00:04:14,669 --> 00:04:15,240
other way,

194
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,870
but if you are having a slide

195
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:18,920
deck, use it in the same structure

196
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,819
that you're going to see below.

197
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:22,759
Anything can work so long as it is

198
00:04:22,769 --> 00:04:23,639
evidence.

199
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:26,170
It's proof that your sales

200
00:04:26,209 --> 00:04:28,500
argument is going to work for

201
00:04:28,509 --> 00:04:29,639
them, that it's going to be the

202
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:30,860
straightest line from point A to

203
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:31,829
point B to get them to their

204
00:04:31,829 --> 00:04:32,220
goals,

205
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:32,959
right?

206
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:34,649
Now, this first part usually

207
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:36,329
actually doesn't use a visual

208
00:04:36,339 --> 00:04:38,220
because it's not really a pitch.

209
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:38,439
It's

210
00:04:38,449 --> 00:04:40,279
much more of a pre-pitch, right?

211
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:41,810
And the goal here is to get them

212
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:43,420
to sold on the concept of your

213
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:43,740
service,

214
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,589
not necessarily your offer yet,

215
00:04:45,589 --> 00:04:46,120
right?

216
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,889
So a lot of times when we're doing

217
00:04:47,889 --> 00:04:49,060
this part, we're talking

218
00:04:49,069 --> 00:04:49,680
about them.

219
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,839
It's, it's, we're almost

220
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:51,930
displacing them from the

221
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:52,819
conversation.

222
00:04:52,819 --> 00:04:55,100
Um, when I said them,

223
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:56,350
I mean like a third party who's

224
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:57,689
not involved, not the prospect

225
00:04:57,699 --> 00:04:58,639
that we're speaking to

226
00:04:58,639 --> 00:04:59,439
specifically,

227
00:04:59,449 --> 00:05:01,149
if you do this wrong, uh, it kind

228
00:05:01,149 --> 00:05:02,680
of sounds a little preachy.

229
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,040
I guess like the closest

230
00:05:04,189 --> 00:05:06,329
parallel in the VSL, once again, I

231
00:05:06,329 --> 00:05:08,399
wouldn't use this scripted part

232
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:10,759
is, you know, this right here.

233
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:11,870
It's kind of like the intro to

234
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:12,810
your sales argument.

235
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:14,250
You see how we're selling cold

236
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:15,740
email as a service

237
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,329
and we're selling or cold email as

238
00:05:17,329 --> 00:05:17,949
a concept.

239
00:05:17,949 --> 00:05:19,360
And we're selling paid ads as a

240
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,519
concept before selling

241
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:21,839
our offer specifically.

242
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:23,500
That's because once again, we want

243
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,920
them to be sold on paid ads.

244
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:25,959
If they're looking at this, we

245
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:27,029
want them to be sold on cold email

246
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,040
if they're looking at this,

247
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:29,500
but the differences between the

248
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,889
marketing and the sales is once

249
00:05:30,889 --> 00:05:32,420
again, the sales side of things,

250
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:33,660
we want this just to be like an

251
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,170
expert sharing their perspective

252
00:05:35,189 --> 00:05:36,759
where the marketing, because it

253
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:36,980
can be

254
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:38,209
so direct, because there's no

255
00:05:38,209 --> 00:05:39,259
two-way conversation.

256
00:05:39,259 --> 00:05:40,370
If you were to just read off of

257
00:05:40,379 --> 00:05:41,300
this, it'd feel a

258
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:42,069
little preachy.

259
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:43,399
So I'd recommend not having a

260
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:45,089
visual to support this part, but

261
00:05:45,089 --> 00:05:46,329
here's the structure.

262
00:05:46,829 --> 00:05:48,220
If you're selling organic content,

263
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,160
they need to be sold in the

264
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,459
concept of organic content for

265
00:05:50,459 --> 00:05:50,819
their business.

266
00:05:50,829 --> 00:05:52,100
If you're selling cold email, they

267
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,300
need to be sold on cold emails,

268
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,180
legion strategy for their

269
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:54,660
business.

270
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:56,160
We start off by asking, do you

271
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,800
mind if I share some thoughts?

272
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,879
So that literal talk track after

273
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:00,699
we summarize,

274
00:06:00,699 --> 00:06:02,870
then this is very much like the

275
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:05,240
last question of discovery.

276
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,819
We summarize what we're hearing in

277
00:06:06,819 --> 00:06:07,189
discovery,

278
00:06:07,209 --> 00:06:08,769
doing a quick recap, making sure

279
00:06:08,769 --> 00:06:10,259
that we're on the same page.

280
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:11,050
I think that's fair.

281
00:06:11,089 --> 00:06:12,220
Asking them if there's anything

282
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:13,329
that we didn't ask about that we

283
00:06:13,329 --> 00:06:14,470
should have asked about.

284
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:14,930
Cool.

285
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:16,069
Discovery is over.

286
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:17,709
My usual next question is, okay,

287
00:06:17,709 --> 00:06:18,600
awesome, man.

288
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,620
And do you mind if I share some

289
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:19,899
thoughts?

290
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:22,410
Nobody's ever said no.

291
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,240
If you guys get somebody to say no

292
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,839
to that, like, no, I don't want to

293
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:26,389
hear your thoughts.

294
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:26,829
Let me know.

295
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,750
That'd be kind of funny just

296
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:28,889
because it's never happened across

297
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:29,730
thousands of calls.

298
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,509
So right after that, then we

299
00:06:31,509 --> 00:06:32,949
proceed to tell them where these

300
00:06:32,949 --> 00:06:34,399
thoughts are coming from while

301
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:35,800
status signaling, right?

302
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:37,129
And this only gets stronger, the

303
00:06:37,129 --> 00:06:38,529
more credibility and case studies

304
00:06:38,529 --> 00:06:39,759
and experience you have.

305
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:40,899
So for us, we're able to say,

306
00:06:40,899 --> 00:06:42,060
yeah, and just to explain where

307
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,410
these thoughts are coming from,

308
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:45,019
we've scaled up our own cold email

309
00:06:45,019 --> 00:06:46,620
agency to six figures a month and

310
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:47,680
helped over a thousand businesses

311
00:06:47,689 --> 00:06:49,139
to date with their lead generation

312
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:49,740
strategy.

313
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:50,910
And then we'll get into what we

314
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:51,899
say next, right?

315
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:52,709
So they're like, okay, cool.

316
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:54,180
I mean, this person clearly knows

317
00:06:54,209 --> 00:06:55,379
what he's talking about.

318
00:06:55,389 --> 00:06:56,180
Let me listen.

319
00:06:56,329 --> 00:06:59,110
Now, if you have some version of

320
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:00,680
that, great.

321
00:07:00,689 --> 00:07:01,680
Once again, it's one of those

322
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,720
things that's only going to get

323
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,949
stronger the more you keep going.

324
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:05,819
Why this is a great opportunity or

325
00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:08,540
we break down common limiting

326
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:10,730
beliefs or help them understand

327
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:12,290
why most people struggle to

328
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:14,160
achieve what you're saying you can

329
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,579
do or what you can help them

330
00:07:15,579 --> 00:07:16,329
achieve.

331
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:17,629
Now, I know that sounds a little

332
00:07:17,629 --> 00:07:18,750
convoluted and the way that I

333
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:19,860
wrote it out kind of is,

334
00:07:20,509 --> 00:07:22,930
but basically what's the number

335
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:25,379
one limiting belief or what's the

336
00:07:25,379 --> 00:07:27,410
number one thing your prospects

337
00:07:27,449 --> 00:07:27,850
need

338
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:30,850
to believe in order for your pitch

339
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:33,180
to make sense, right?

340
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,089
If we can get them on the same

341
00:07:34,149 --> 00:07:34,480
page,

342
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:36,879
if we can get them thinking the

343
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:39,670
same way about our service, about

344
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:41,579
our approach as we do,

345
00:07:41,589 --> 00:07:42,790
then obviously our pitch is going

346
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:43,620
to make more sense.

347
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,699
So to give you a couple examples,

348
00:07:45,709 --> 00:07:47,050
and I actually wrote out an

349
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:49,350
example below, but one that we've

350
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:52,199
used time and time again for our

351
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:52,459
cold

352
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:53,740
email setup offer is, Hey, do you

353
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:54,939
mind if I share some thoughts?

354
00:07:54,939 --> 00:07:55,230
Yeah.

355
00:07:55,269 --> 00:07:56,370
And just explain where these

356
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:57,709
thoughts are coming from.

357
00:07:57,709 --> 00:07:59,230
We've scaled up our own cold email

358
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:00,819
agency to six figures a month.

359
00:08:00,819 --> 00:08:01,019
We've

360
00:08:01,029 --> 00:08:02,089
helped over a thousand B2B

361
00:08:02,089 --> 00:08:03,360
businesses with their cold email

362
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,720
strategy, and we get five to 10

363
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,339
calls booked

364
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:07,009
per day with our own cold email

365
00:08:07,009 --> 00:08:07,810
currently.

366
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:09,680
And what we've seen after working

367
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,779
with all these different

368
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:12,730
companies is this is the main

369
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:15,089
three reasons why people don't see

370
00:08:15,089 --> 00:08:17,069
results with cold email.

371
00:08:17,089 --> 00:08:18,870
And the reason why we attack that

372
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:20,720
is because there's so many people

373
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,240
that are jaded by cold email,

374
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,430
cold email doesn't work.

375
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:24,759
I never opened up cold emails.

376
00:08:24,819 --> 00:08:26,149
I worked with an agency and I got

377
00:08:26,149 --> 00:08:26,759
burned.

378
00:08:26,769 --> 00:08:28,040
So like for that specific offer,

379
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,269
it makes sense to attack that.

380
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:30,519
And then we would go on to say,

381
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:32,158
number one, they're not doing

382
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:33,110
enough volume.

383
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:34,840
A lot of people come to the calls

384
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,519
telling us they reach

385
00:08:36,529 --> 00:08:37,559
out to a thousand people a month

386
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:38,158
for six months.

387
00:08:38,158 --> 00:08:39,240
And they're surprised that they

388
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,418
only got one or two calls.

389
00:08:40,788 --> 00:08:42,429
For us, we work with a minimum of

390
00:08:42,429 --> 00:08:44,080
where we reach out to a minimum of

391
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,299
5,000 prospects per month.

392
00:08:46,309 --> 00:08:47,370
And even then that's the bare

393
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:48,389
minimum that you'd want.

394
00:08:48,389 --> 00:08:49,639
If you want to see meaningful lead

395
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:50,019
flow.

396
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,549
Now, the second reason it doesn't

397
00:08:51,549 --> 00:08:52,779
take a genius to tell you that

398
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:54,000
sales and numbers, again,

399
00:08:54,009 --> 00:08:55,350
we need to be reaching out to more

400
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:56,590
people that people want to see

401
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:57,960
results is it, is it takes a

402
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:59,090
lot of technical expertise to

403
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:00,389
build the right infrastructure to

404
00:09:00,389 --> 00:09:02,139
reach out to 5,000 plus people a

405
00:09:02,139 --> 00:09:04,090
month and not burn your domains,

406
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,919
end up in spam and have the whole

407
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:07,460
system crash and burn.

408
00:09:07,789 --> 00:09:08,169
Right?

409
00:09:08,289 --> 00:09:09,529
So now, even if you are doing

410
00:09:09,539 --> 00:09:11,070
enough volume and you do have the

411
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:11,779
right infrastructure,

412
00:09:11,789 --> 00:09:13,190
the reason why most companies

413
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:14,539
still fail with cold email is a

414
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:15,259
strategy.

415
00:09:15,259 --> 00:09:16,100
They're trying to write long

416
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:16,870
form copy.

417
00:09:16,899 --> 00:09:18,600
They're putting in links and

418
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,610
attachments into their email and

419
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:22,519
they're wondering why it's not

420
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:23,200
going through.

421
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,460
When with cold email, you have to

422
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:25,700
realize that these people don't

423
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:26,480
know who you are.

424
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:27,850
And even though we may get 50 to

425
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:29,110
70% of the list to open up the

426
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,570
email, we're probably going to get

427
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:31,580
them to read that for three to

428
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:32,220
five seconds.

429
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:33,779
So we need to be short to the

430
00:09:33,779 --> 00:09:35,200
point conversational.

431
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:35,690
Cool.

432
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,710
I guess I'm curious, what are your

433
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:39,179
thoughts on all that?

434
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:40,980
And usually there's just some like

435
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:42,639
weak because we've, we've

436
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:44,980
established ourselves as experts.

437
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:47,580
There's some like weak, you know,

438
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:48,720
Hey, I'll defer to you because

439
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:49,519
you're the expert.

440
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:50,169
Yeah, I agree.

441
00:09:50,179 --> 00:09:51,059
That makes sense.

442
00:09:51,059 --> 00:09:51,820
That sounds right.

443
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:53,419
Like, yeah, I can resonate with

444
00:09:53,419 --> 00:09:53,809
that.

445
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,639
You know, previously we just, you

446
00:09:55,639 --> 00:09:56,419
know, didn't do enough

447
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:57,080
following him.

448
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,210
And once again, that was super

449
00:09:58,250 --> 00:09:58,529
messy.

450
00:09:58,590 --> 00:09:59,730
I'm just pulling off an example

451
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:00,269
for you guys,

452
00:10:00,309 --> 00:10:02,350
but going back to where I was at,

453
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:04,409
the important thing is that they

454
00:10:04,419 --> 00:10:06,159
come out of this on the same

455
00:10:06,169 --> 00:10:06,769
page as you.

456
00:10:06,769 --> 00:10:08,149
Now, remember, we're not even

457
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:09,769
talking about them specifically.

458
00:10:09,769 --> 00:10:11,000
We're just sharing how we

459
00:10:11,009 --> 00:10:12,480
see things as an expert and seeing

460
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,220
if they agree.

461
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,590
And most of the time when people

462
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:15,539
aren't 100%

463
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:16,899
committed to think one way or the

464
00:10:16,899 --> 00:10:18,200
other, they'll agree with the

465
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:18,700
experts.

466
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:19,980
And usually they will agree

467
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:21,389
just because if they were so jaded

468
00:10:21,389 --> 00:10:22,610
about your service that they

469
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:24,029
really truly believed in their

470
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:24,580
bones that it

471
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:25,669
couldn't work, even if they do

472
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:26,840
have a high level of skepticism,

473
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,899
they wouldn't have booked in a

474
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:28,340
call.

475
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:28,799
Right.

476
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:29,940
So here's an example.

477
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,240
That's going to be a lot more

478
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,600
clean for you guys.

479
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,500
I wrote it out.

480
00:10:33,509 --> 00:10:34,639
Do you mind if I share some

481
00:10:34,669 --> 00:10:35,250
thoughts?

482
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:35,840
Yeah, cool.

483
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,990
And just to explain where these

484
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:37,659
thoughts are coming

485
00:10:37,669 --> 00:10:39,039
from, I've helped over 30 local

486
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:40,389
businesses increase their revenue

487
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:41,700
from restaurants to roofers.

488
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:42,240
And the

489
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:43,830
reason most local business owners

490
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:45,230
never see success with organic

491
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:46,460
content is because of the

492
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:47,100
perceived time

493
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:48,110
investment, right?

494
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:49,529
They're running real businesses

495
00:10:49,529 --> 00:10:50,820
and don't have time to become

496
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,129
influencers, but they don't

497
00:10:52,289 --> 00:10:53,879
realize they don't need to be.

498
00:10:53,889 --> 00:10:55,649
So they do nothing at all, which

499
00:10:55,649 --> 00:10:58,279
typically doesn't do much, or they

500
00:10:58,279 --> 00:10:58,370
go

501
00:10:58,409 --> 00:10:59,610
for quicker marketing strategies

502
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:00,740
and they wonder why they can never

503
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:01,580
find consistency.

504
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:02,580
They're constantly

505
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:04,309
looking for a strategy to get them

506
00:11:04,309 --> 00:11:05,870
consistent traffic that they

507
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:07,639
actually keep long-term without

508
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:08,179
needing to

509
00:11:08,179 --> 00:11:09,889
invest all their time, without

510
00:11:09,889 --> 00:11:11,750
realizing that organic content is

511
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:12,779
that strategy.

512
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:14,080
If it's done right.

513
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,440
Curious to hear your thoughts on

514
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:15,860
that.

515
00:11:19,009 --> 00:11:19,330
Cool.

516
00:11:19,539 --> 00:11:20,919
Like once again, if I'm selling

517
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:22,409
organic content and I'm dealing

518
00:11:22,409 --> 00:11:23,299
with a lot of skeptical

519
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:24,840
prospects, I would start off by

520
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,519
saying something like this before

521
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:27,970
getting into the real pitch,

522
00:11:28,049 --> 00:11:29,470
just because if I break down that

523
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:30,909
limiting belief, that organic

524
00:11:30,909 --> 00:11:33,659
content can't work for local

525
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:33,980
business

526
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:34,529
owners.

527
00:11:34,529 --> 00:11:35,889
That's very important.

528
00:11:35,889 --> 00:11:37,340
If I don't do that, a lot of my

529
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:38,860
pitch is going to be in one ear

530
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:39,039
and out

531
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:39,610
the other.

532
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:41,049
To give you guys another example,

533
00:11:41,059 --> 00:11:42,309
I was talking to a client quite

534
00:11:42,309 --> 00:11:43,700
literally earlier today

535
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,909
that was, or that is selling

536
00:11:45,909 --> 00:11:47,840
static ad creatives.

537
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,279
And a lot of the people will go

538
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:49,759
through the pitch.

539
00:11:49,769 --> 00:11:50,500
They like what he says.

540
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,279
And they give him like some

541
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:52,529
veiled, yeah, I'll think about it.

542
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:52,740
Or,

543
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:53,480
you know, thanks.

544
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,799
Send over some more information.

545
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:56,269
And the key issue is a lot of

546
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:57,259
people just don't

547
00:11:57,259 --> 00:11:58,509
believe static ad creatives

548
00:11:58,509 --> 00:11:59,759
convert as well as video.

549
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:01,419
Right?

550
00:12:01,419 --> 00:12:03,139
So I told him about this concept

551
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:03,320
of

552
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:04,529
having just a quick expert

553
00:12:04,529 --> 00:12:05,980
perspective to, as opposed to

554
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:07,409
hoping that we can solve that at

555
00:12:07,409 --> 00:12:08,009
the end of the

556
00:12:08,029 --> 00:12:09,320
call or hoping that we could solve

557
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,539
that over email and follow-up,

558
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,799
since that's where a lot of these

559
00:12:11,809 --> 00:12:12,940
calls are going, let's just solve

560
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:14,139
it right at the top of the pitch.

561
00:12:14,149 --> 00:12:14,960
Hey man, cool.

562
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:15,649
Do you mind if I

563
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:16,450
share some thoughts?

564
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,570
Yeah, man, just explain where

565
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:18,740
these thoughts are coming from.

566
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:19,399
I've helped over

567
00:12:19,549 --> 00:12:22,480
50 e-com brands scale with static

568
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,059
ads.

569
00:12:23,059 --> 00:12:25,370
And the reason why most e-com

570
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:27,120
brand owners aren't

571
00:12:27,269 --> 00:12:29,610
super excited or super sure that

572
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:31,879
static ads is going to work for

573
00:12:31,879 --> 00:12:34,389
them is because they're trying to

574
00:12:34,549 --> 00:12:36,509
compare static ads to video ads on

575
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:37,970
a one-to-one basis.

576
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:39,750
And if you film a static ad and

577
00:12:39,789 --> 00:12:40,440
you film

578
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:42,950
one video ad, odds are that video

579
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,639
ad is going to perform better, but

580
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:47,659
that's not the use case for

581
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:48,620
static ads.

582
00:12:48,629 --> 00:12:50,720
The use case for static ads is to

583
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,970
test with way more volume than you

584
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:54,379
ever could with video

585
00:12:54,389 --> 00:12:54,860
ads.

586
00:12:54,919 --> 00:12:56,860
So take you, for example, if

587
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:59,409
you're a e-com brand owner with 15

588
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,019
different products,

589
00:13:01,029 --> 00:13:03,529
if you have the wherewithal and

590
00:13:03,539 --> 00:13:06,049
the manpower and the marketing

591
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,580
team to be able to do a ton of

592
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:08,820
video

593
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,299
creative for all 15, by all means

594
00:13:10,299 --> 00:13:10,610
do it.

595
00:13:10,649 --> 00:13:11,720
Most people don't have those

596
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,279
resources.

597
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:13,299
What static ads is going

598
00:13:13,309 --> 00:13:15,230
to allow you to do is test at such

599
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:15,990
a volume.

600
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:18,830
So you can test 10, 15, 20 plus

601
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:20,399
static ad creatives for

602
00:13:20,409 --> 00:13:22,190
each one of your products, test

603
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:24,360
quicker, get market feedback, find

604
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,279
the winners, and then be able to

605
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:26,559
use

606
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:28,240
that winning message for each of

607
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,899
those products and double down

608
00:13:29,899 --> 00:13:31,620
your resources on video ads for

609
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:31,960
those

610
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:33,639
products specifically with the

611
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:35,610
messaging already being, you know,

612
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:37,360
already knowing that it works and

613
00:13:37,529 --> 00:13:38,529
delivered to you on a silver

614
00:13:38,549 --> 00:13:40,019
platter because of the experience

615
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:40,919
with the static ad.

616
00:13:40,929 --> 00:13:41,840
So it's really much

617
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:43,129
more of a testing mechanism than

618
00:13:43,129 --> 00:13:43,850
anything else.

619
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:45,179
I'm curious to hear your thoughts

620
00:13:45,179 --> 00:13:46,740
on that, right?

621
00:13:46,769 --> 00:13:48,120
Once again, I'm kind of just

622
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,759
pulling this out left and right.

623
00:13:49,789 --> 00:13:51,120
But once again, it's one of those

624
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:51,279
things

625
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:52,809
where we just need to attack that

626
00:13:52,809 --> 00:13:54,409
main limiting belief or help them

627
00:13:54,409 --> 00:13:56,240
understand if they're super

628
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:57,639
jaded, why most people are in the

629
00:13:57,639 --> 00:13:59,009
same boat as them and haven't been

630
00:13:59,049 --> 00:14:00,000
able to see results.

631
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,350
So they don't

632
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:00,909
feel alone.

633
00:14:00,909 --> 00:14:02,149
And then just curious to hear your

634
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:03,269
thoughts on that, right?

635
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:06,299
Like we're not yet selling, but if

636
00:14:06,309 --> 00:14:07,740
we've done this correctly,

637
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,450
everything else is so much easier

638
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:11,320
because then we can establish that

639
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:11,759
you solve

640
00:14:11,769 --> 00:14:13,019
this need in the market and who

641
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:14,279
you specifically help best.

642
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:15,879
So going back to this example that

643
00:14:15,889 --> 00:14:16,120
I wrote

644
00:14:16,129 --> 00:14:17,649
out about local content.

645
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:18,320
Awesome.

646
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,769
And it goes out saying that

647
00:14:19,769 --> 00:14:21,740
content like anything else takes a

648
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,159
proven strategy, volume and

649
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:23,960
consistency.

650
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,559
So the way we solve local business

651
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:27,080
owners content problems is by

652
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,690
coming up with a distribution

653
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:30,570
strategy that guarantees they post

654
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:32,360
twice a day on different platforms

655
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:32,580
with

656
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:34,330
a proven strategy without spending

657
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,659
more than one hour per month

658
00:14:35,659 --> 00:14:36,879
recording content.

659
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:38,580
And typically we work

660
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:39,759
with busy entrepreneurs like

661
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:40,940
yourself who know they can use

662
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:42,299
content to grow their business,

663
00:14:42,299 --> 00:14:42,799
have

664
00:14:42,809 --> 00:14:44,019
expertise they want to share.

665
00:14:44,019 --> 00:14:45,320
I mean, they're, they're tired of

666
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,649
seeing these unqualified gurus

667
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:48,470
getting all the views, but they

668
00:14:48,509 --> 00:14:49,809
need to do it in a way that

669
00:14:49,809 --> 00:14:51,500
doesn't take away from their day

670
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:51,710
to day

671
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:52,379
responsibilities.

672
00:14:52,379 --> 00:14:53,990
It's like, cool.

673
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:56,159
Like this guy's going to be a

674
00:14:56,159 --> 00:14:58,399
hundred percent on the same page

675
00:14:58,409 --> 00:14:59,490
as me when I go into what the

676
00:14:59,509 --> 00:15:00,990
actual service looks like, which

677
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:02,120
is what happens next.

678
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:02,720
And this is where

679
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:04,190
you're going to want to support it

680
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:05,600
with a diagram, with a visual,

681
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,899
with some sort of slide.

682
00:15:06,899 --> 00:15:07,750
So once

683
00:15:07,769 --> 00:15:09,419
again, I could give you guys a

684
00:15:09,419 --> 00:15:11,509
number of different examples here,

685
00:15:11,509 --> 00:15:14,059
but like even scrolling down

686
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,100
yeah, right here, like a

687
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,929
depiction, graphical

688
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,570
representation of what this looks

689
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:21,519
like, how this

690
00:15:21,529 --> 00:15:22,029
works.

691
00:15:22,059 --> 00:15:23,799
Daniel probably gives you a ton of

692
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:25,309
examples in a VSL of how this

693
00:15:25,309 --> 00:15:26,179
looks here.

694
00:15:26,179 --> 00:15:26,759
Let me see.

695
00:15:29,889 --> 00:15:31,230
So this is the same diagram in our

696
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:32,399
VSL, but once again, if I'm

697
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,600
talking about the process

698
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:35,309
of somebody needing a cold email

699
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:37,639
system that can reach out to 5,000

700
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:39,519
plus people and explaining the

701
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,769
process that we go through of

702
00:15:40,769 --> 00:15:42,220
setting up 15 domains and two

703
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:43,600
email accounts per domain and

704
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:43,860
doing the

705
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:45,240
DMARC, the DKIM, the SPF records,

706
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,370
it can all get pretty technical

707
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,200
pretty quickly.

708
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,220
But if they have

709
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:49,549
this visual to support, they're

710
00:15:49,549 --> 00:15:50,889
going to retain that information

711
00:15:50,889 --> 00:15:52,309
and understand it a lot better.

712
00:15:52,809 --> 00:15:54,590
So going back into this, yeah, a

713
00:15:54,629 --> 00:15:56,580
pretty clear and obvious point as

714
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,330
to where you're going to want them

715
00:15:58,370 --> 00:15:59,620
to be able to see some sort of

716
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:00,639
visual to back it up.

717
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:02,059
And you're also going to want to

718
00:16:02,059 --> 00:16:02,759
break it down

719
00:16:02,769 --> 00:16:05,350
into a three or four point pitch

720
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,960
that talks about how we deliver

721
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,669
results, right?

722
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:10,259
And the reason why you

723
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:11,779
want to have a clear three or four

724
00:16:11,779 --> 00:16:13,190
point pitch is because that's

725
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:14,639
going to naturally help them

726
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:14,940
retain

727
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:16,659
that information a lot better too.

728
00:16:16,659 --> 00:16:18,980
So if you've ever pitched somebody

729
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:20,259
and you feel like they're

730
00:16:20,269 --> 00:16:21,700
just not understanding, they're

731
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:23,110
not grasping it, they're kind of

732
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:24,539
like, yeah, this makes sense,

733
00:16:24,549 --> 00:16:25,350
but can you send it over?

734
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:26,429
Like I didn't really get it.

735
00:16:26,429 --> 00:16:27,809
And they seem genuinely confused.

736
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:30,049
Try it again with having a clear

737
00:16:30,049 --> 00:16:32,190
three to four point pitch and a

738
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:34,519
diagram and some sort of visual

739
00:16:34,529 --> 00:16:35,769
to back it up and support it.

740
00:16:35,769 --> 00:16:37,110
I guarantee you, these guys are

741
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,559
actually going to understand your

742
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:39,970
service a lot better, which is

743
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:41,600
going to drastically increase your

744
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:43,019
chances of getting them to close

745
00:16:43,029 --> 00:16:44,590
on the call because confused

746
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:45,929
prospects do not buy.

747
00:16:45,929 --> 00:16:46,799
Right?

748
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:49,220
So now another thing, we're also

749
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:49,399
going to

750
00:16:49,409 --> 00:16:50,649
want a visual to support this

751
00:16:50,649 --> 00:16:52,139
part, sell the next step, not the

752
00:16:52,139 --> 00:16:52,970
entire journey.

753
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,059
People don't buy big

754
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:55,200
transformations.

755
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:57,179
This, this can work in marketing.

756
00:16:57,179 --> 00:16:58,750
They buy clear pass forward,

757
00:16:58,759 --> 00:16:59,269
right?

758
00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:00,159
Now I'm not saying

759
00:17:00,169 --> 00:17:01,570
that we can't sell them on a big

760
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:02,570
transformation.

761
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:04,140
I'm saying that if we don't, if we

762
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:05,220
don't sell them on

763
00:17:05,289 --> 00:17:06,318
the next steps that lead to that

764
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:07,539
big transformation, they're just

765
00:17:07,539 --> 00:17:08,519
not going to believe it.

766
00:17:08,519 --> 00:17:09,259
For instance,

767
00:17:09,269 --> 00:17:10,838
if I was a weight loss coach and

768
00:17:10,838 --> 00:17:12,549
I'm selling somebody on a weight

769
00:17:12,549 --> 00:17:13,940
loss program that can get

770
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:16,190
them from 300 pounds to 200

771
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:18,078
pounds, that's a massive jump.

772
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:19,880
If I don't explain exactly what

773
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,380
the steps are

774
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:21,519
going to look like to get them the

775
00:17:21,549 --> 00:17:22,710
first few wins, they're just not

776
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:23,619
going to believe it.

777
00:17:23,619 --> 00:17:24,019
Right?

778
00:17:24,019 --> 00:17:24,230
Once

779
00:17:24,269 --> 00:17:25,789
again, that, that stuff can more

780
00:17:25,789 --> 00:17:27,250
so work in marketing as opposed to

781
00:17:27,289 --> 00:17:27,789
in sales.

782
00:17:27,799 --> 00:17:29,140
When the next step is small

783
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:31,359
and logical, not a giant leap of

784
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:33,650
faith, it's a lot easier for them

785
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:34,640
to say yes.

786
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,880
So you want to lay out

787
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:37,369
the quick wins, which reduces

788
00:17:37,369 --> 00:17:39,029
friction and basically check in to

789
00:17:39,029 --> 00:17:41,289
make sure the next nine, 30 to 90

790
00:17:41,299 --> 00:17:41,559
days,

791
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:42,960
whatever roadmap you have for

792
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,460
delivery seems like the logical

793
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:45,930
next step for their business,

794
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:46,250
where they'll

795
00:17:46,269 --> 00:17:47,000
see value.

796
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,539
So super important that you

797
00:17:48,539 --> 00:17:50,160
understand and can, and can

798
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,019
cleanly lay out what those next

799
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:53,809
steps, what those first 30 to 60

800
00:17:53,849 --> 00:17:54,869
days would look like.

801
00:17:54,869 --> 00:17:56,450
So, Hey, you know, first couple of

802
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:56,950
weeks are

803
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:57,519
onboarding.

804
00:17:57,519 --> 00:17:58,670
We're gonna get the whole system

805
00:17:58,670 --> 00:17:59,720
set up two weeks from now.

806
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,400
You're going to have a cold

807
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:01,730
email system that can reach out to

808
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:03,400
5,000 plus people per month.

809
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,680
The next month is going to be

810
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:05,630
a lot of testing.

811
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,329
So we set you up with professional

812
00:18:07,329 --> 00:18:08,920
copy that's written by our own

813
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,180
in-house copywriters

814
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:11,480
with an A, B, C, and D test.

815
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,910
In that first month, we're going

816
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:14,130
to be able to gather a bunch of

817
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:14,480
data.

818
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:16,170
And then going into the second

819
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:18,029
half of month two, we're going to

820
00:18:18,039 --> 00:18:19,779
be able to see which clear winners

821
00:18:19,789 --> 00:18:21,660
we have so we can double down and

822
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,759
then start to dedicate more volume

823
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:25,309
to the winning angle that we have

824
00:18:25,339 --> 00:18:25,619
at that

825
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:26,000
point.

826
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,359
Once again, just kind of coming up

827
00:18:27,369 --> 00:18:28,529
with these on the fly, but you

828
00:18:28,539 --> 00:18:29,339
guys get the point.

829
00:18:29,349 --> 00:18:30,640
It needs to seem like a logical

830
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,049
next step for their business.

831
00:18:32,049 --> 00:18:34,029
And you can even ask them if you

832
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:34,200
want

833
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:35,809
to check in, like, Hey, you know,

834
00:18:35,809 --> 00:18:37,869
curious, man, does that 30, 60 day

835
00:18:37,869 --> 00:18:39,400
roadmap make sense to you guys?

836
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:40,630
That seemed like a logical next

837
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:41,849
step based on where you guys are

838
00:18:41,849 --> 00:18:42,160
at.

839
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,380
Cool.

840
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:45,099
Once, once again,

841
00:18:45,109 --> 00:18:46,680
this is very important when you're

842
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,079
selling to a prospect that has a

843
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:49,500
number of different problems

844
00:18:49,509 --> 00:18:50,589
because all the problems aren't

845
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:51,579
going to be solved at once.

846
00:18:51,579 --> 00:18:52,720
And if you tell them they are,

847
00:18:52,789 --> 00:18:53,549
they're just going to be like,

848
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:54,369
okay, this guy's selling snake

849
00:18:54,369 --> 00:18:54,569
oil.

850
00:18:54,589 --> 00:18:55,640
I just don't believe

851
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:55,920
it.

852
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,380
Where if we can sell them on that

853
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:58,859
first next step, if we can show

854
00:18:58,859 --> 00:19:00,329
them those first quick wins,

855
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:01,450
that's when we can get them to

856
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:02,650
actually start thinking about

857
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:03,539
buying on the call.

858
00:19:03,549 --> 00:19:05,119
Now, next, we're going to want to

859
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:06,430
make sure that they are clear

860
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:07,500
about the process.

861
00:19:07,509 --> 00:19:09,490
Confused prospects don't buy.

862
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,579
I mentioned that earlier, right?

863
00:19:10,579 --> 00:19:11,349
I tell my sales guys this

864
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:12,180
all the time.

865
00:19:12,329 --> 00:19:13,849
So after pitching and before

866
00:19:13,849 --> 00:19:15,549
closing, ask them if they have any

867
00:19:15,549 --> 00:19:16,400
questions about the

868
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:17,460
process specifically.

869
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,849
And how they feel about the

870
00:19:18,849 --> 00:19:20,250
process specifically.

871
00:19:20,279 --> 00:19:22,400
Because they could believe that it

872
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:22,880
would work.

873
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:23,960
But if they don't believe that it

874
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,130
would work for them, it literally

875
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:25,880
doesn't matter.

876
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:27,430
And it's also important to allow

877
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:28,819
space for dumb questions.

878
00:19:28,819 --> 00:19:30,569
Because once again, they're trying

879
00:19:30,589 --> 00:19:31,880
to think of how it would work for

880
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,230
them.

881
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:33,539
They may have a dumb question or

882
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:33,829
two.

883
00:19:33,829 --> 00:19:34,819
And I'm only calling

884
00:19:34,829 --> 00:19:35,849
them dumb questions because

885
00:19:35,849 --> 00:19:36,930
they're going to seem dumb to the

886
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:38,140
person that runs the offer.

887
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:38,890
That is a

888
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:39,890
cold email expert.

889
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:41,410
That is a Facebook ads expert.

890
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:44,390
But a lot of times it's just stuff

891
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:45,099
like,

892
00:19:45,109 --> 00:19:46,299
hey, you know, why do we need to

893
00:19:46,299 --> 00:19:47,430
set up extra domains again?

894
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:48,740
What are the domain names going to

895
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:48,920
look

896
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,710
like or for paid ads?

897
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:53,240
Like, okay, so wait, how do we

898
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,420
actually film the videos?

899
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,779
Do I need like a setup?

900
00:19:56,789 --> 00:19:58,079
Do I need certain software?

901
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:58,490
Right?

902
00:19:58,490 --> 00:19:59,849
It could seem insignificant or

903
00:19:59,849 --> 00:20:01,200
like low stakes question.

904
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:01,690
But if

905
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:02,920
they can't get that out of the

906
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,299
back of their head, they're not

907
00:20:04,309 --> 00:20:06,059
going to be able to visualize how

908
00:20:06,059 --> 00:20:06,279
this

909
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:07,369
is actually going to work for

910
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:07,700
them.

911
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:08,789
And it's also just going to be

912
00:20:08,789 --> 00:20:10,000
gnawing at them in the back of

913
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:10,079
their

914
00:20:10,089 --> 00:20:11,440
head to the point where it will

915
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,069
actually prevent them from closing

916
00:20:13,069 --> 00:20:14,480
if they don't get all of those

917
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:15,279
questions out.

918
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:15,940
Right?

919
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:17,180
So we check in on that.

920
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:17,619
Cool.

921
00:20:17,619 --> 00:20:19,170
The next thing we want to do,

922
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:20,200
because at this point

923
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:22,480
they are sold on the concept, you

924
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,359
know, we kind of introduce

925
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:26,329
ourselves as a solution that

926
00:20:26,329 --> 00:20:26,990
solves the

927
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,559
problem that we tell them exactly

928
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:30,049
how we actually solve the problem

929
00:20:30,089 --> 00:20:31,700
with the three or four point pitch

930
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:33,000
that talks about how we deliver

931
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,400
these results, showing them the

932
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,740
diagram, kind of showing them

933
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,319
what the next steps look like and,

934
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:38,890
you know, lay out those quick wins

935
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:40,380
and reduce friction for the next

936
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:41,809
30 to 90 days, making sure that it

937
00:20:41,829 --> 00:20:42,900
seems like a logical next step for

938
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:43,630
their business.

939
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:44,950
Then we make sure they're clear on

940
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:45,589
the process.

941
00:20:45,589 --> 00:20:48,990
So they should be, let's say 80%

942
00:20:49,029 --> 00:20:50,319
away there at this

943
00:20:50,329 --> 00:20:50,829
point.

944
00:20:50,859 --> 00:20:52,599
Now it's important because we've

945
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:55,009
been talking for 20, 25 minutes at

946
00:20:55,029 --> 00:20:56,549
this point in the sales call

947
00:20:56,569 --> 00:20:58,779
to make sure that they don't lose

948
00:20:58,779 --> 00:21:00,750
sight of the fact that this is

949
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:03,000
going to get them to their goals.

950
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,349
Because a lot of information has

951
00:21:04,349 --> 00:21:04,990
been shared.

952
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,349
You're probably talking a lot at

953
00:21:06,349 --> 00:21:07,000
this point.

954
00:21:07,269 --> 00:21:08,609
They're probably a little tired at

955
00:21:08,609 --> 00:21:09,170
this point.

956
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:10,329
It's important that we kind of

957
00:21:10,329 --> 00:21:11,079
zoom out a little

958
00:21:11,089 --> 00:21:13,019
bit and go back to relating this

959
00:21:13,019 --> 00:21:15,589
from, Hey, this is all to get you

960
00:21:15,589 --> 00:21:17,819
from point A to point B.

961
00:21:17,829 --> 00:21:19,019
And you guys need to have

962
00:21:19,019 --> 00:21:20,900
something that can show them this,

963
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:21,480
right?

964
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,000
So common examples of just like

965
00:21:24,009 --> 00:21:25,559
summarizing and value stacking, as

966
00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:26,900
I call it, you guys can use an ROI

967
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:27,660
calculator.

968
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,059
So these things are

969
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:30,640
so stupid, easy to make now for

970
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:30,910
AI.

971
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:32,390
I was just messing around with

972
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:34,619
this a little bit ago, but this

973
00:21:34,619 --> 00:21:35,220
was the

974
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:35,990
prompt that I gave it.

975
00:21:36,019 --> 00:21:37,210
And this isn't a special prompt.

976
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:38,490
Once again, I just kind of drew

977
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:38,980
this up

978
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:40,109
before we started this video.

979
00:21:40,109 --> 00:21:41,059
My offer is called email.

980
00:21:41,059 --> 00:21:42,140
My packages allow customers to

981
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:43,019
send out 20,000

982
00:21:43,029 --> 00:21:44,710
emails a month, 40,000 emails a

983
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:46,529
month, or 60,000 emails a month.

984
00:21:46,529 --> 00:21:47,920
The cost is this for this, this

985
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:48,049
for

986
00:21:48,069 --> 00:21:49,150
that, this for that.

987
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,119
Let's make the 20,000 emails a

988
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:52,890
month package called starter 40 K

989
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:53,539
email a month

990
00:21:53,539 --> 00:21:55,039
package called pro in the 60 K

991
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:56,430
emails a month called expert in

992
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:57,819
terms of average results.

993
00:21:57,819 --> 00:21:58,440
I kind of laid out

994
00:21:58,450 --> 00:21:59,910
what the average client would see.

995
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:01,130
And once again, like plug in,

996
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:02,349
whatever your numbers are,

997
00:22:02,369 --> 00:22:04,529
those are the leads, uh, those 20

998
00:22:04,529 --> 00:22:06,400
positive replies, uh, of those

999
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,680
leads, the clients typically

1000
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,019
convert

1001
00:22:08,029 --> 00:22:09,410
40% of them in the book calls.

1002
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:10,779
So the client that gets 20 leads

1003
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:12,319
usually gets eight book calls from

1004
00:22:12,329 --> 00:22:13,279
the eight calls booked.

1005
00:22:13,289 --> 00:22:14,450
I want the prospect, the person

1006
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:15,759
using the calculator to enter in

1007
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:16,099
the close

1008
00:22:16,109 --> 00:22:16,779
rate and LTV.

1009
00:22:16,779 --> 00:22:18,269
If the close rate is 25%, for

1010
00:22:18,279 --> 00:22:19,829
example, the client would get two

1011
00:22:19,829 --> 00:22:20,660
new clients.

1012
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:21,440
If their LTV

1013
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:23,089
is 10,000, then return, uh, on

1014
00:22:23,089 --> 00:22:24,869
that investment would be 20,000.

1015
00:22:24,869 --> 00:22:25,920
We need a calculator.

1016
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,220
Uh, you know,

1017
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:28,220
we need to calculate the ROI from

1018
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:28,480
here.

1019
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,670
Could you create this calculator?

1020
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:30,960
Literally took me five

1021
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:31,369
seconds.

1022
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:32,490
Asked, you know, is that good to

1023
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:32,690
go?

1024
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:33,619
I said, yeah, perfect.

1025
00:22:33,619 --> 00:22:34,380
Let's build it.

1026
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:34,859
And you can

1027
00:22:34,859 --> 00:22:36,240
already see this thing is built

1028
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:36,880
right here.

1029
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,359
So I click the starter package.

1030
00:22:38,359 --> 00:22:39,769
Let's say I have a 25%

1031
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:44,130
close rate and a, you know, four

1032
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:47,500
or five Oh LTV right away.

1033
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,859
I'm going to be able to see, okay,

1034
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:52,960
there's a 3.5 X on my investment.

1035
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,460
Let's see if I could do this.

1036
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:55,920
I go to the bigger package.

1037
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:56,339
Guess

1038
00:22:56,349 --> 00:22:56,650
what?

1039
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:57,670
I'm going to see a bigger one

1040
00:22:57,670 --> 00:22:58,849
because the pricing sales with

1041
00:22:58,849 --> 00:22:59,569
volume, right?

1042
00:22:59,569 --> 00:23:00,359
And you can ask

1043
00:23:00,369 --> 00:23:01,650
it and have it make quick

1044
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:02,549
adjustments.

1045
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:04,269
So like just real quick, um, it

1046
00:23:04,289 --> 00:23:05,599
kind of shows the breakdown

1047
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:08,309
here, the conversion, the funnel

1048
00:23:08,309 --> 00:23:09,930
to net new clients.

1049
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:12,380
Um, let's just say, can we also

1050
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:15,779
show the

1051
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:21,559
returns they would see in cash

1052
00:23:21,559 --> 00:23:27,309
value month over month for six

1053
00:23:27,309 --> 00:23:29,400
months.

1054
00:23:30,369 --> 00:23:32,710
And you can see, this is already

1055
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:33,319
done.

1056
00:23:33,319 --> 00:23:35,710
I just re-entered the numbers.

1057
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:36,960
25% close rate,

1058
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:39,299
$4,500 lifetime value here.

1059
00:23:39,299 --> 00:23:41,119
Uh, they can see this look month

1060
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:43,019
one, month two, month three,

1061
00:23:43,029 --> 00:23:44,809
month four, month five, month six.

1062
00:23:44,849 --> 00:23:45,220
Cool.

1063
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:47,319
12,000 invested in the first six

1064
00:23:47,319 --> 00:23:49,019
months, 42,000 collected,

1065
00:23:49,029 --> 00:23:49,670
right?

1066
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:51,210
Super, super easy.

1067
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:52,980
It's, uh, it's crazy.

1068
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:55,500
Anyways, um, going back to this,

1069
00:23:55,509 --> 00:23:57,490
once we do that, once we can paint

1070
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,549
the ROI, obviously we're going to

1071
00:23:59,559 --> 00:24:00,190
have some

1072
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:01,009
sort of interaction.

1073
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:01,730
Hey, cool, man.

1074
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:02,829
All this make it sense to you.

1075
00:24:02,829 --> 00:24:04,089
Yep.

1076
00:24:04,119 --> 00:24:05,279
Any questions on this,

1077
00:24:05,289 --> 00:24:06,480
on the calculator, on this?

1078
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,769
And let's talk about other things

1079
00:24:07,769 --> 00:24:09,019
outside of the calculator.

1080
00:24:09,029 --> 00:24:10,269
You can just, at this point,

1081
00:24:10,269 --> 00:24:11,519
remind them of results-based

1082
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:13,950
guarantee, a risk reversal price

1083
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,009
anchoring.

1084
00:24:15,009 --> 00:24:17,430
A good example of this is like, if

1085
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:19,960
you have a super deliverable heavy

1086
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:20,680
offer,

1087
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:21,910
let's say you're doing like video

1088
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:22,470
production.

1089
00:24:22,509 --> 00:24:23,579
And with all the stuff that you

1090
00:24:23,589 --> 00:24:24,299
do, if they want to

1091
00:24:24,309 --> 00:24:26,329
hire in-house people for that, we

1092
00:24:26,329 --> 00:24:28,349
can essentially use a price anchor

1093
00:24:28,359 --> 00:24:29,460
of like, Hey, this would

1094
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:29,880
typically,

1095
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:31,109
if you wanted to have a

1096
00:24:31,109 --> 00:24:32,630
videographer or somebody to come

1097
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,099
out and do this and that it would

1098
00:24:34,099 --> 00:24:34,380
cost you

1099
00:24:34,529 --> 00:24:36,410
usually anywhere from eight to 10

1100
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:37,480
K a month, right?

1101
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,240
We only charge three K a month,

1102
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,099
right?

1103
00:24:40,109 --> 00:24:41,690
And here's what our clients see on

1104
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:43,039
average in terms of views.

1105
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:44,640
Here's what it translates into

1106
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:44,960
dollars

1107
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:46,369
and cents, blah, blah, blah, blah,

1108
00:24:46,369 --> 00:24:46,950
blah, right?

1109
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:48,059
ROI calculator is going to be the

1110
00:24:48,059 --> 00:24:49,200
most obvious way

1111
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:49,660
to use it.

1112
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:50,900
But once again, you can use it in

1113
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,049
a number of different ways.

1114
00:24:52,049 --> 00:24:53,220
After that, after we show

1115
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:55,130
them the ROI, it's going to be

1116
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:57,369
pretty clear that, you know, the

1117
00:24:57,369 --> 00:24:59,619
numbers point to them doing it,

1118
00:24:59,619 --> 00:25:00,009
but we

1119
00:25:00,069 --> 00:25:01,710
still don't know if they actually

1120
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:03,190
believe that it would play out

1121
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:03,839
that way.

1122
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:06,039
So the next question is

1123
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:07,539
typically just a no good reason

1124
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:09,029
tie down as I call it, which is,

1125
00:25:09,069 --> 00:25:10,680
Hey, do you see any reason this

1126
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:10,920
wouldn't

1127
00:25:10,930 --> 00:25:12,029
work out for you?

1128
00:25:12,029 --> 00:25:12,579
Right?

1129
00:25:12,579 --> 00:25:14,529
So if I'm showing this calculator

1130
00:25:14,529 --> 00:25:16,450
or this calculator right here,

1131
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,710
Hey, do you

1132
00:25:17,769 --> 00:25:19,769
see any reason you want to be able

1133
00:25:19,769 --> 00:25:21,829
to see that 3.5 X that we're

1134
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:22,789
projecting?

1135
00:25:22,819 --> 00:25:23,680
Do you see any reason

1136
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:25,589
you want to be able to get those

1137
00:25:25,589 --> 00:25:28,049
10 new calls that you were looking

1138
00:25:28,049 --> 00:25:29,700
for each month, right?

1139
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:30,039
Whatever

1140
00:25:30,049 --> 00:25:31,240
that goal is, do you see any

1141
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,440
reason you want to be able to

1142
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,539
achieve X, Y, Z goal?

1143
00:25:33,539 --> 00:25:34,500
If they can't think

1144
00:25:34,509 --> 00:25:37,099
of one, they're mentally going to

1145
00:25:37,109 --> 00:25:39,450
default to no, which is a yes,

1146
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:40,170
right?

1147
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:41,819
So let me change that real

1148
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:43,180
quick.

1149
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:48,589
No, which is a yes for us, right?

1150
00:25:48,599 --> 00:25:53,160
This is a powerful way to close

1151
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:56,579
without pressure.

1152
00:25:56,579 --> 00:25:57,170
Obviously

1153
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:58,650
the deal is not closed yet, but at

1154
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:00,029
this point it makes sense to get

1155
00:26:00,029 --> 00:26:01,700
into the investment next steps and

1156
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:03,079
then obviously make that first ask

1157
00:26:03,079 --> 00:26:03,690
for the sale.

1158
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:05,049
So then once again, we're going to

1159
00:26:05,049 --> 00:26:05,700
want to relate

1160
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:07,579
the investment, not the price back

1161
00:26:07,579 --> 00:26:09,029
to the end result and say the

1162
00:26:09,029 --> 00:26:10,390
number and then pause.

1163
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:11,720
I'm not

1164
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:12,859
a big proponent of pausing and

1165
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:14,130
having a ton of awkward silence

1166
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:15,420
that just builds up and make it

1167
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:15,630
makes

1168
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:16,329
it awkward.

1169
00:26:16,329 --> 00:26:17,650
So if there's a bit of awkward

1170
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:19,380
silence, I just ask them, Hey, you

1171
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:20,440
know, all right.

1172
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:20,720
So let's

1173
00:26:20,769 --> 00:26:21,900
just go through this.

1174
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:22,859
Um, okay, cool.

1175
00:26:22,859 --> 00:26:24,569
And for all that investments, just

1176
00:26:24,569 --> 00:26:28,109
$10,000 guys say sound.

1177
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:28,720
Okay,

1178
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:29,470
cool, man.

1179
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:29,910
Yeah.

1180
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:31,650
I'm curious to hear if this aligns

1181
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:34,319
with what you're able to invest to

1182
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:35,380
get to 20 calls

1183
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:35,680
a month.

1184
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:36,779
All right.

1185
00:26:36,779 --> 00:26:39,279
The reason why I like that, as

1186
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:41,680
opposed to how are we feeling

1187
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,519
about the investment?

1188
00:26:43,529 --> 00:26:44,599
Cause people could feel a number

1189
00:26:44,599 --> 00:26:45,309
of different ways.

1190
00:26:45,349 --> 00:26:47,220
Really what matters is, Hey, does

1191
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:48,519
this align with

1192
00:26:48,529 --> 00:26:49,950
what they're able to invest to get

1193
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:50,769
to X, Y, Z goal?

1194
00:26:50,769 --> 00:26:52,369
So once again, we're, we're, we're

1195
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,210
using that term

1196
00:26:53,369 --> 00:26:55,559
investment as opposed to pay or

1197
00:26:55,559 --> 00:26:57,730
swing to get to their goal.

1198
00:26:57,730 --> 00:26:59,880
We want to constantly remind them

1199
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:00,009
that

1200
00:27:00,089 --> 00:27:01,970
the goal of this investment is to

1201
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:03,990
get them to their goal, because if

1202
00:27:04,019 --> 00:27:05,420
they're looking at it through

1203
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:05,609
their

1204
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:07,630
lens, obviously it's going to be a

1205
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:08,869
lot more valuable.

1206
00:27:08,869 --> 00:27:10,759
And it's very important that you

1207
00:27:10,759 --> 00:27:11,779
are cool, calm, and

1208
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:13,089
confident at this point.

1209
00:27:13,089 --> 00:27:14,380
Cause we just asked them for

1210
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:15,230
money, right?

1211
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:16,980
So they're naturally going to be a

1212
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:17,079
little

1213
00:27:17,079 --> 00:27:19,109
weird and finicky and just like,

1214
00:27:19,109 --> 00:27:20,900
we want to be just like, we've

1215
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:22,920
been there a hundred times before.

1216
00:27:23,069 --> 00:27:24,099
Right.

1217
00:27:24,099 --> 00:27:25,519
So when I go through this in

1218
00:27:25,529 --> 00:27:27,289
reality, it's yeah, it's just

1219
00:27:27,289 --> 00:27:28,740
$10,000.

1220
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:33,220
Cool, man.

1221
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:34,319
Yeah.

1222
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:35,329
Curious to hear if this aligns

1223
00:27:35,329 --> 00:27:36,420
with what we're able to invest to

1224
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:36,740
get to

1225
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:38,759
50,000 followers on Instagram.

1226
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:43,420
Once again, I'm not freaking out.

1227
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:44,750
I'm not seeming needy because

1228
00:27:44,809 --> 00:27:45,490
then they're going to smell

1229
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:46,509
commission, commission breath, and

1230
00:27:46,509 --> 00:27:47,480
nobody likes to smell commission

1231
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:47,990
breath.

1232
00:27:48,019 --> 00:27:49,349
I'm just acting very calm and

1233
00:27:49,349 --> 00:27:50,480
casual at this point.

1234
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,869
I'm not acting, even if it is a

1235
00:27:51,869 --> 00:27:52,170
big

1236
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:53,640
number, I'm not acting like it is

1237
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,380
a huge number.

1238
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:55,809
Now, obviously if they also act

1239
00:27:55,809 --> 00:27:56,819
like it's a giant,

1240
00:27:56,829 --> 00:27:58,049
giant number, want to call that

1241
00:27:58,049 --> 00:27:59,099
out and be able to start that

1242
00:27:59,099 --> 00:28:00,519
conversation, that dialogue about

1243
00:28:00,519 --> 00:28:00,930
that.

1244
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:02,549
But if they're all good, if it, if

1245
00:28:02,549 --> 00:28:04,000
it seems like it's making sense

1246
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:04,599
for them,

1247
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:05,490
I'm going to lay out the next

1248
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:06,630
steps and then I'm going to make

1249
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,670
my first S, right?

1250
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:08,460
So cool,

1251
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:08,660
man.

1252
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:09,549
Typically what happens at this

1253
00:28:09,559 --> 00:28:10,339
point, you'll process the

1254
00:28:10,339 --> 00:28:11,069
investment with me.

1255
00:28:11,079 --> 00:28:11,880
I'll get you over

1256
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:12,619
an onboarding form and a

1257
00:28:12,619 --> 00:28:13,740
scheduling link, and we'll be able

1258
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:14,920
to get started in the process.

1259
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:15,259
So we should

1260
00:28:15,269 --> 00:28:16,759
be able to have that system built

1261
00:28:16,759 --> 00:28:18,259
up for you in a couple of weeks.

1262
00:28:18,289 --> 00:28:19,480
Ready to get started.

1263
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,609
And it's

1264
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:21,430
just that easy, right?

1265
00:28:21,569 --> 00:28:22,700
A lot of people ask like, what's

1266
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:23,480
your closing line?

1267
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,259
What do you say?

1268
00:28:24,259 --> 00:28:24,480
Like,

1269
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:25,619
don't overthink it.

1270
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:27,210
Like if we've built up the pitch

1271
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:28,960
up to this point, using the same

1272
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:29,460
architecture,

1273
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:30,930
all you need is ready to get

1274
00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:31,569
started.

1275
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,549
And once again, tonality is super

1276
00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:34,490
important.

1277
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:35,579
right here.

1278
00:28:35,589 --> 00:28:37,140
Like your tone should be

1279
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,549
reflecting that you expect them to

1280
00:28:39,549 --> 00:28:40,380
say yes.

1281
00:28:40,529 --> 00:28:42,599
Right?

1282
00:28:42,599 --> 00:28:45,329
Like your tone should be like,

1283
00:28:45,329 --> 00:28:47,829
Hey, I'm so cool and calm.

1284
00:28:47,829 --> 00:28:50,500
And I'm just asking it in such a

1285
00:28:50,529 --> 00:28:52,710
casual matter of fact way, because

1286
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:54,660
my service is so good that this is

1287
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:56,619
just natural that people do at

1288
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:57,240
this point.

1289
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,559
I'm not being like, what do you

1290
00:28:58,569 --> 00:28:58,980
think?

1291
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:00,470
You're ready to take a chance.

1292
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,079
You're ready to go.

1293
00:29:01,089 --> 00:29:02,869
It's just like, ready to get

1294
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:03,599
started.

1295
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:04,180
Cool.

1296
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:06,230
And then literally take payment

1297
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:07,569
and go from there.

1298
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:08,299
Right?

1299
00:29:08,299 --> 00:29:10,930
But, but, but between us, between

1300
00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:12,950
you and me, you should not be

1301
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:14,299
surprised at all.

1302
00:29:14,299 --> 00:29:15,019
If they don't

1303
00:29:15,029 --> 00:29:15,589
say yes.

1304
00:29:15,589 --> 00:29:16,099
Right?

1305
00:29:16,099 --> 00:29:17,539
If every single person was a

1306
00:29:17,549 --> 00:29:19,359
frictionless, yes, we wouldn't

1307
00:29:19,359 --> 00:29:20,549
have sales calls.

1308
00:29:20,849 --> 00:29:21,869
We would just have a checkout

1309
00:29:21,869 --> 00:29:22,220
page.

1310
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:23,180
Right?

1311
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:25,339
So when they say no, we also don't

1312
00:29:25,339 --> 00:29:25,869
want to be rattled.

1313
00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:26,960
We want to still have that calm,

1314
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:27,849
cool, collected tone.

1315
00:29:27,859 --> 00:29:28,720
We don't want to freak out.

1316
00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:30,319
We want to obviously dive into the

1317
00:29:30,319 --> 00:29:31,950
next steps, which is objection

1318
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:32,630
handling.

1319
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:33,960
And we go from there.

1320
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:35,609
So hopefully this is value guys.

1321
00:29:35,609 --> 00:29:37,119
Uh, like I said, this is really

1322
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:39,019
everything up until the first ask.

1323
00:29:39,069 --> 00:29:40,150
And then we're going to go to what

1324
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:41,299
happens after that, right?

1325
00:29:41,299 --> 00:29:42,660
The, the objection handling,

1326
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:44,579
how to continue to get back in the

1327
00:29:44,579 --> 00:29:46,569
sales conversation so we can make

1328
00:29:46,589 --> 00:29:47,720
more asks because

1329
00:29:47,789 --> 00:29:49,420
more asks equals more sales.

1330
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:50,369
Pretty simple.

1331
00:29:50,369 --> 00:29:52,009
The best sales guys are the ones

1332
00:29:52,009 --> 00:29:52,980
who make the most

1333
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:53,309
asks.

1334
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:55,039
So if somebody doesn't go on the

1335
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:56,829
first ask, let's figure out how to

1336
00:29:56,859 --> 00:29:58,380
get back to a point where

1337
00:29:58,390 --> 00:29:59,380
yeah, it feels natural to

1338
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,490
obviously ask them for the sale

1339
00:30:00,549 --> 00:30:01,980
again, which is obviously going to

1340
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:02,180
come

1341
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:03,779
after some objection handling.

1342
00:30:03,779 --> 00:30:05,150
So hopefully you guys got some

1343
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:06,160
value out of this.

1344
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:06,890
Going to wrap it up here.
