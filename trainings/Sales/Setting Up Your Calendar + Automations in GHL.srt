1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,300
What's going on guys in this video

2
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:02,490
i'm going to be going over three

3
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:03,669
things one how to set up your

4
00:00:04,009 --> 00:00:05,299
calendar inside to go high level

5
00:00:05,299 --> 00:00:06,500
two how to create a basic

6
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:08,400
automation inside to go high level

7
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:08,630
keeping

8
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:10,250
the theme of the calendar for this

9
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:11,730
video i'm just going to show you

10
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:13,759
how to create an opportunity in

11
00:00:14,169 --> 00:00:15,449
your pipeline when somebody books

12
00:00:15,449 --> 00:00:16,699
in a meeting and then three and

13
00:00:16,699 --> 00:00:17,839
most importantly where i want

14
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:19,620
to spend most of my time in this

15
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:21,579
video is talking about how to get

16
00:00:21,579 --> 00:00:23,600
as many people who book in a call

17
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:25,140
to show up to the call as possible

18
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:26,690
with good pre-call messaging in

19
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:27,920
this messaging i'm showing

20
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:29,300
you it's going to be very similar

21
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:30,679
to the messaging that we've used

22
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:35,439
to get consistently mid 60 65 66

23
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:37,850
show rates from ice cold traffic

24
00:00:37,909 --> 00:00:40,479
and get 80 plus show rates from

25
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:42,079
warm traffic so something that

26
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:42,240
we've

27
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:44,310
taught tried tested i've tinkered

28
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:46,020
with things so much to get the

29
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,000
show rate as high as possible and

30
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:50,229
this is essentially what we land

31
00:00:50,229 --> 00:00:52,119
on now before i dive into the

32
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:54,630
calendar stuff and the automation

33
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:55,119
stuff i'm

34
00:00:55,399 --> 00:00:56,609
going to run through that pretty

35
00:00:56,609 --> 00:00:58,149
quickly just because you guys can

36
00:00:58,149 --> 00:00:59,600
be resourceful i mean if

37
00:00:59,729 --> 00:01:00,710
you're starting a business or

38
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:02,000
you're scaling a business you kind

39
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,039
of need to be resourceful

40
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:04,680
it's maybe the most important

41
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,640
skill especially in the beginning

42
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,680
uh so i don't want to over

43
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,150
complicate

44
00:01:08,489 --> 00:01:09,959
something that's rather simple

45
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:11,629
anyways let's just go into the

46
00:01:11,629 --> 00:01:14,799
settings here uh you can see if

47
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:15,040
you go to

48
00:01:15,209 --> 00:01:17,450
my profile scroll down here you

49
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:19,760
should be able to connect your

50
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,319
google calendar um usually i think

51
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:22,640
when you

52
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:24,980
hit add new it's going to take you

53
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:27,319
to the integrations tab which is

54
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:30,239
right over here or where is this

55
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:30,480
thing

56
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:33,319
settings integrations right over

57
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:36,239
here connect your google calendar

58
00:01:36,569 --> 00:01:38,329
pretty straightforward right so

59
00:01:38,329 --> 00:01:41,189
mine's already connected um also

60
00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:42,879
with the email services portion

61
00:01:43,209 --> 00:01:45,010
here going back settings real

62
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:47,150
quick uh i typically would

63
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:49,579
recommend just setting up a

64
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:51,040
two-way sync which

65
00:01:51,209 --> 00:01:52,780
you can see here uh you can turn

66
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,819
off enable reply tracking you just

67
00:01:54,819 --> 00:01:56,560
put reply to the regular address

68
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:59,390
that you're sending from um and on

69
00:01:59,469 --> 00:02:02,079
the my profile side where is it

70
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,640
right here is where the two-way

71
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:04,799
sync

72
00:02:05,129 --> 00:02:06,760
would be now you don't want to use

73
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,669
this for email marketing in the

74
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:10,560
sense of like a newsletter you

75
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:11,949
also don't want to use this for

76
00:02:11,949 --> 00:02:13,569
cold email because that's going to

77
00:02:13,569 --> 00:02:15,360
put your primary domain at risk

78
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:16,759
so absolutely do not do that go

79
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:18,039
through the steps to set up a

80
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:19,840
separate separate domain for that

81
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,000
we're

82
00:02:20,289 --> 00:02:21,539
going to be showing you how to run

83
00:02:21,539 --> 00:02:23,050
super high level cold outreach

84
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:24,800
anyways completely outside of the

85
00:02:25,129 --> 00:02:26,229
system and for email marketing

86
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:27,599
like i said uh we may be showing

87
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,039
you how to use something like

88
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:29,439
convert

89
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:31,310
kit or constant contact but if you

90
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:33,169
are going through go high level do

91
00:02:33,169 --> 00:02:34,389
not use this setting

92
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:36,530
this is really just for one-to-one

93
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:39,150
personalized outreach i.e somebody

94
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:40,560
books in a call we're sending

95
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:42,229
them pre-call messaging or they're

96
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:43,740
in our pipeline so we're sending

97
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:45,199
out a sequence that's going to

98
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:45,439
drip

99
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:47,219
to them uh slowly as opposed to

100
00:02:47,219 --> 00:02:49,060
massive email blast which once

101
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:51,199
again could mess up your domain so

102
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:51,680
do not

103
00:02:51,849 --> 00:02:53,449
use this for that you can set up

104
00:02:53,449 --> 00:02:55,159
both at the same time but know

105
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:57,919
what you're using for which now if

106
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,090
you're just kind of acting as a

107
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:00,330
salesperson trying to add some

108
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:01,759
automation into the one-to-one

109
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:03,889
communication that's where the

110
00:03:03,969 --> 00:03:05,680
setting can be fine for you

111
00:03:05,689 --> 00:03:08,719
anyways going into the calendar

112
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:09,120
portion

113
00:03:09,449 --> 00:03:11,819
once you've got that all set up um

114
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:15,050
you go to calendar settings and i

115
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,199
was just messing around

116
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,349
creating a couple test calendars

117
00:03:18,349 --> 00:03:19,289
anyways you're going to see

118
00:03:19,289 --> 00:03:20,710
something in here uh if you want

119
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:21,199
to edit the

120
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:23,229
calendar meeting details you can

121
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,139
add a logo you make the calendar

122
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:27,360
name so you can have it like uh

123
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:29,689
you know cold email setup call you

124
00:03:29,689 --> 00:03:32,009
know uh paid ads console whatever

125
00:03:32,009 --> 00:03:34,319
you guys want to name it um

126
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:35,990
not super super important but you

127
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:37,620
know you get a little creative uh

128
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,120
you don't you don't want to go

129
00:03:39,409 --> 00:03:40,840
with a virtual coffee chat or

130
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,919
strategy session here assign team

131
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:45,199
members do this right here um also

132
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:45,360
if

133
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:47,250
you guys want to just start from

134
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:49,280
scratch um and you're planning to

135
00:03:49,289 --> 00:03:51,340
add multiple team members to one

136
00:03:53,349 --> 00:03:55,169
i hate how this is uh not showing

137
00:03:55,169 --> 00:03:57,050
me this thing here let me just go

138
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:57,680
back and

139
00:04:00,349 --> 00:04:01,710
we'll just create a new calendar

140
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:03,000
for you guys if you plan to add

141
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:04,639
multiple team members to it you

142
00:04:04,789 --> 00:04:05,979
can just start with a round robin

143
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:07,300
even if it's only you to begin if

144
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,039
you're planning to add a closer

145
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:11,169
pretty soon uh you can just use

146
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:13,680
yourself as this uh calendar name

147
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,560
you know dan sales calendar

148
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:18,389
three because i've been messing

149
00:04:18,389 --> 00:04:20,060
around with it and wanted to be

150
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,540
unique anyways uh yeah we'll just

151
00:04:22,579 --> 00:04:24,079
do dan sales

152
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:26,839
three uh meeting duration 30

153
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:29,189
minutes set your availability

154
00:04:29,589 --> 00:04:31,279
there cool this is already going

155
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:31,360
to

156
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,160
check your conflicts uh check for

157
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,990
conflicts guys so you probably saw

158
00:04:35,029 --> 00:04:36,600
on my profile page you can add

159
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:38,009
multiple calendars to check for

160
00:04:38,009 --> 00:04:39,370
conflicts so if you use more than

161
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:41,439
one calendar for one job and

162
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:42,160
another or

163
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:43,839
multiple companies like i do it

164
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:45,759
will check on your google calendar

165
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,339
automatically uh so let's just go

166
00:04:47,529 --> 00:04:48,509
into this one and look at the

167
00:04:48,509 --> 00:04:50,069
settings now in terms of

168
00:04:50,069 --> 00:04:52,470
availability i would recommend

169
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:53,120
having as much

170
00:04:53,449 --> 00:04:54,370
availability as possible like i

171
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,449
said it's going to check for

172
00:04:55,449 --> 00:04:57,360
conflicts so if you want to add a

173
00:04:57,649 --> 00:04:59,079
block from 12 to 1 for lunch or

174
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:00,639
you're a morning workout person

175
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,480
you want to add a block from 7

176
00:05:02,939 --> 00:05:04,910
to 9 a.m to do that it'll already

177
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:06,819
factor that in so nobody can book

178
00:05:06,819 --> 00:05:08,480
in at those times um

179
00:05:09,389 --> 00:05:10,480
in terms of slot interval i

180
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,110
typically recommend 30 minutes

181
00:05:12,189 --> 00:05:14,000
here meeting duration 30 minutes

182
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,399
um even

183
00:05:14,589 --> 00:05:15,930
if you typically are like more of

184
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:17,790
a 45 45 minute person i would just

185
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:19,660
keep it at 30 minutes um then

186
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,250
i would also just add a buffer

187
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,350
post buffer would be 15 minutes so

188
00:05:23,379 --> 00:05:24,860
this means that if you can only

189
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:25,009
book

190
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:26,769
in every 30 minutes somebody books

191
00:05:26,769 --> 00:05:28,439
in at three o'clock for 30 minutes

192
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:29,920
um since there's a 15 minute

193
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:32,000
post buffer they can't book in at

194
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,240
3 30 but they could book in at

195
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,389
four o'clock um date range the

196
00:05:36,389 --> 00:05:36,800
chances

197
00:05:36,949 --> 00:05:38,670
of somebody showing up if they

198
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:40,750
book out more than three four days

199
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,560
they're just going to drop off

200
00:05:42,889 --> 00:05:44,439
precipitously so if you have good

201
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:46,269
availability if you have a lot of

202
00:05:46,269 --> 00:05:48,160
time and open slots which like i

203
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:49,750
recommend i would recommend

204
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,620
showing people as many options as

205
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:53,439
possible i would just put that to

206
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:53,680
three

207
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
days uh minimum scheduling notice

208
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
um i would put this to one or two

209
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,079
hours just so they can book in on

210
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:01,310
that same day if they're a hot

211
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:02,689
lead let's talk to them but at the

212
00:06:02,689 --> 00:06:04,160
same time i understand you may be

213
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:04,399
out

214
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,050
about want to be able to get back

215
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:07,509
into your computer maximum

216
00:06:07,509 --> 00:06:09,699
bookings per day that is for wimps

217
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:10,160
so

218
00:06:10,329 --> 00:06:11,689
don't do that just kidding if you

219
00:06:11,689 --> 00:06:13,110
get super busy you can set it to

220
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:14,639
like six bookings per day max

221
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:14,959
booking

222
00:06:15,129 --> 00:06:16,730
per slot one that's pretty typical

223
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:17,970
so all this stuff pretty

224
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:19,589
straightforward like i said uh

225
00:06:19,589 --> 00:06:20,139
forms here

226
00:06:20,389 --> 00:06:22,269
it's just going to collect their

227
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:24,360
first name last name email phone

228
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:26,319
and notes if you want to do

229
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:26,639
anything

230
00:06:26,949 --> 00:06:28,709
else you can do that inside of the

231
00:06:28,709 --> 00:06:30,699
steps here sites forms you just

232
00:06:30,699 --> 00:06:33,279
plug that form instead um in

233
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:33,600
general

234
00:06:33,649 --> 00:06:34,949
i want to add more friction you

235
00:06:34,949 --> 00:06:36,269
could add less friction so if

236
00:06:36,269 --> 00:06:37,720
you're not using the notes from

237
00:06:37,769 --> 00:06:38,399
here

238
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:40,389
specifically if you're just

239
00:06:40,389 --> 00:06:42,379
looking at their website for

240
00:06:42,379 --> 00:06:44,870
example you could just add website

241
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:45,519
as a separate

242
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:46,689
question or you could just take

243
00:06:46,689 --> 00:06:47,930
off the notes altogether if you're

244
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,430
not looking at them because like i

245
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:50,079
said

246
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,490
less friction the better consent

247
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:54,550
box turn that off uh thank you

248
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:57,839
page ideally i'd recommend

249
00:06:58,170 --> 00:06:59,250
redirecting to a thank you page if

250
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:00,399
you have one uh to give you an

251
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:01,839
idea as to what our thank you page

252
00:07:02,139 --> 00:07:03,339
looks like this is pretty high

253
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:04,970
level complex not something you

254
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:06,560
need uh if you're just getting

255
00:07:06,889 --> 00:07:08,060
started but you can kind of see

256
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,740
what we're doing here we're we're

257
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,509
making it very stupid simple for

258
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:13,009
somebody to be like oh okay this

259
00:07:13,009 --> 00:07:14,430
is how i add this to my calendar

260
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:16,000
here and then we're giving them

261
00:07:16,329 --> 00:07:17,459
frequently asked questions videos

262
00:07:17,459 --> 00:07:18,610
which once again this is not a

263
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:20,000
requirement but something that

264
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,319
like

265
00:07:20,449 --> 00:07:22,120
it's it's obviously not going to

266
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,730
hurt and you know you guys can

267
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:26,800
view it for context anyways now we

268
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,040
have

269
00:07:27,269 --> 00:07:28,550
this auto confirm new meetings

270
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:29,959
make sure this is on uh we don't

271
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:31,360
want to have to like screen

272
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:31,839
meetings in

273
00:07:32,009 --> 00:07:32,990
that sense if you did want to

274
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:34,459
screen meetings to like qualify or

275
00:07:34,459 --> 00:07:35,959
disqualify somebody do that before

276
00:07:36,329 --> 00:07:38,389
they book in do it through a type

277
00:07:38,389 --> 00:07:40,970
form now notifications um this is

278
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,800
something or this is where you're

279
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:44,040
going to be sending out the email

280
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:45,149
reminders we don't need this

281
00:07:45,149 --> 00:07:46,399
because it's just going to get

282
00:07:46,629 --> 00:07:47,600
auto confirmed so this is

283
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,810
irrelevant uh but once the

284
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:50,500
appointment is confirmed which it

285
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:50,879
will be

286
00:07:51,209 --> 00:07:52,279
automatically you can send out

287
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:53,670
your first email for here so you

288
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:57,120
would just do this uh you can just

289
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:57,600
do

290
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:59,269
this goes to the context i mean

291
00:07:59,269 --> 00:08:00,939
contact you can sign it you can

292
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:02,639
also assign it to yourself if you

293
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:02,779
also

294
00:08:03,019 --> 00:08:04,300
want to see the emails but really

295
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,759
not relevant and you'll put the

296
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,040
copy in here like i said we're

297
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:07,199
going to

298
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,639
talk about the copy in a second i

299
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:09,870
actually like this add the

300
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:11,360
calendar button so i wanted to uh

301
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:13,439
take that out but i could show you

302
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:16,060
what we use for ours so click out

303
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:18,790
of that i don't know what's going

304
00:08:18,939 --> 00:08:20,720
on guys with the not let me scroll

305
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,550
to the top but it's it's bugging

306
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:24,720
me uh and then also the reminders

307
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:28,040
so for this i'd recommend doing a

308
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:31,560
few reminders here so let's just

309
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:35,519
do email additional emails uh so

310
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:35,830
for the

311
00:08:36,168 --> 00:08:37,389
contact i would want to send over

312
00:08:37,389 --> 00:08:38,320
a reminder that is

313
00:08:38,649 --> 00:08:42,399
typically let's say 24 hours

314
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,100
before the appointment starts if

315
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,509
they book it on the same day it's

316
00:08:45,509 --> 00:08:45,750
just

317
00:08:45,929 --> 00:08:47,379
not going to send to them and then

318
00:08:47,379 --> 00:08:48,710
i would recommend doing an

319
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:49,669
additional email

320
00:08:50,009 --> 00:08:52,399
that's going to be

321
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:55,809
one hour before it starts the

322
00:08:55,809 --> 00:08:57,279
reason why i would want to do that

323
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:58,879
inside of here as opposed to just

324
00:08:58,879 --> 00:08:59,200
adding

325
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:03,049
more is because i would want the

326
00:09:03,049 --> 00:09:04,879
email copy to be different you

327
00:09:04,889 --> 00:09:06,000
don't really need to play around

328
00:09:06,169 --> 00:09:07,179
with this at all you just need to

329
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:08,240
add a subject line once again

330
00:09:08,269 --> 00:09:09,500
we're going to talk about copy

331
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:11,649
a little bit more but pretty basic

332
00:09:11,649 --> 00:09:13,779
stuff here uh you can customize it

333
00:09:13,779 --> 00:09:15,360
in terms of what you want this

334
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,980
to look like but not much that you

335
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:18,720
really need to change around here

336
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,039
so pretty straightforward and then

337
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:21,200
at

338
00:09:21,529 --> 00:09:24,690
the end of it go into calendars

339
00:09:25,049 --> 00:09:33,039
let's click here the share

340
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:34,190
calendar buttons up here for

341
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:34,919
whatever reason it's

342
00:09:35,259 --> 00:09:38,559
not allowing me to do that so okay

343
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:40,950
cool now i can share calendar copy

344
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,720
the link and this is what it's

345
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,200
going to look like

346
00:09:46,539 --> 00:09:47,720
pretty straightforward somebody

347
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,389
can select the time boom name

348
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:51,840
email phone and i'll show you how

349
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,480
to

350
00:09:52,789 --> 00:09:53,970
create an automation real quick so

351
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:55,779
that when somebody does book in a

352
00:09:55,779 --> 00:09:58,320
call and opportunity gets

353
00:09:58,649 --> 00:10:00,129
created so what does that look

354
00:10:00,129 --> 00:10:02,440
like let's go into automation i've

355
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:04,879
already built this we're going to

356
00:10:05,049 --> 00:10:07,289
go back automation i'm going to go

357
00:10:07,289 --> 00:10:09,200
into meeting books create

358
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,779
opportunity it's really this

359
00:10:10,779 --> 00:10:11,279
simple guys

360
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:12,980
like this is a really easy builder

361
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,679
tool i'm not a technical person by

362
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:16,460
the way at all if you guys

363
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:17,809
going to tell with me messing

364
00:10:17,809 --> 00:10:19,440
around now in most these tutorials

365
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,960
videos but trigger customer book

366
00:10:21,289 --> 00:10:23,190
deployment create contact assign

367
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:24,950
to user us create our update

368
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:27,120
opportunity add opportunity uh

369
00:10:27,289 --> 00:10:28,789
add owner to the opportunity

370
00:10:28,789 --> 00:10:30,899
pretty straightforward and like on

371
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:32,879
this stage for example you can see

372
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:33,360
uh create

373
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:35,090
update opportunity in this

374
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:36,980
pipeline in this stage meeting

375
00:10:37,029 --> 00:10:38,539
booked opportunity i just named it

376
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:39,440
after the

377
00:10:39,769 --> 00:10:41,549
first name opportunity value you

378
00:10:41,549 --> 00:10:43,559
can give it one if you want status

379
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:45,429
open save all pretty

380
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:46,149
straightforward

381
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:47,730
as i was mentioning and you can

382
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,169
see i booked in a couple test

383
00:10:49,169 --> 00:10:50,240
appointments here

384
00:10:50,549 --> 00:10:53,080
and they're all showing up right

385
00:10:53,149 --> 00:10:55,919
inside of here just as i want

386
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:58,159
right so then i have the meeting

387
00:10:58,159 --> 00:10:58,480
or they

388
00:10:58,649 --> 00:11:00,029
don't show up they can move into

389
00:11:00,029 --> 00:11:01,450
one of these and hopefully we

390
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:03,039
close the deal moving in there

391
00:11:03,149 --> 00:11:04,350
so now that's done all pretty

392
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:05,960
straightforward just over 10

393
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,639
minutes here
