1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,000
What's going on, guys?

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:01,960
In this video, I want to talk

3
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:02,750
about effective pre-call

4
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:03,419
messaging.

5
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:03,700
I was

6
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:05,129
actually supposed to get into this

7
00:00:05,129 --> 00:00:06,500
in the last video, but it crashed

8
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:06,839
on me.

9
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:08,080
So I figured it'd

10
00:00:08,179 --> 00:00:09,330
be higher quality anyways if I

11
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:10,880
spent one video dedicated to this.

12
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,720
As I mentioned, we've done

13
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:13,929
so many different things to mess

14
00:00:13,929 --> 00:00:14,730
with the show rate.

15
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:15,990
Some of them have worked, some of

16
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:16,219
them

17
00:00:16,539 --> 00:00:16,850
haven't.

18
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,500
But the current process that we

19
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,269
have today has been leading to mid

20
00:00:20,269 --> 00:00:21,980
60% on ice cold

21
00:00:22,339 --> 00:00:23,589
traffic in terms of show rate.

22
00:00:23,589 --> 00:00:25,449
That's through paid ads, primarily

23
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:26,600
through cold email.

24
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,019
It's even

25
00:00:27,399 --> 00:00:27,579
higher.

26
00:00:27,579 --> 00:00:29,359
And then through organic traffic,

27
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:30,760
it's been over 80%.

28
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:33,000
So that within itself, we've

29
00:00:33,189 --> 00:00:35,030
seen across multiple offers.

30
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:36,740
If you can get your show rate

31
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:38,789
there, that won't be the issue

32
00:00:38,979 --> 00:00:40,640
for your company scaling.

33
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,000
That won't be the reason your

34
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,200
sales process fails.

35
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:43,530
So if you want

36
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,000
to make sure that your show rate's

37
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,399
not shooting you guys in the foot

38
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:47,460
in terms of being able

39
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,640
to close as many deals as you

40
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,939
want, collect as much cash as

41
00:00:49,939 --> 00:00:51,179
you'd want, this is a very

42
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:52,179
important video.

43
00:00:52,179 --> 00:00:54,340
Now, note, these email sequences

44
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:56,060
should be set up in your CRM so

45
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:56,840
that they come

46
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,159
from the salesman's email that is

47
00:00:58,159 --> 00:00:59,429
not on the calendar invite.

48
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,679
This will get more attention

49
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,170
from the prospect and make more

50
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:03,270
sense with the email copy

51
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:04,060
provided.

52
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:05,980
It also makes managing

53
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:07,620
pre-call conversations easier and

54
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:09,079
has more congruence in the sales

55
00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:10,689
process since the follow-up emails

56
00:01:10,859 --> 00:01:12,000
will be coming up from that same

57
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,379
email.

58
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,400
Now, this is really an important

59
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,500
note for people that

60
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:17,480
are using Calendly because if I'm

61
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,469
using Calendly, I'd want to set up

62
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:21,760
things separately inside of

63
00:01:21,909 --> 00:01:23,569
my CRM and not lean too much on

64
00:01:23,569 --> 00:01:25,599
Calendly for the reminders.

65
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:26,920
Like we use Calendly personally

66
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,540
and we

67
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:28,609
just use it for a 24-hour

68
00:01:28,629 --> 00:01:29,140
reminder.

69
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:30,010
The email that goes out

70
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:31,379
immediately after booking, the

71
00:01:31,379 --> 00:01:31,780
email that

72
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:34,340
goes out one hour before, that's

73
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:37,069
done through HubSpot, which is our

74
00:01:37,069 --> 00:01:37,609
CRM.

75
00:01:37,689 --> 00:01:39,680
And we go through the hassle of

76
00:01:40,019 --> 00:01:41,280
making all these automations and

77
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,650
putting in all that work just

78
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:44,379
because number one, like I said,

79
00:01:45,049 --> 00:01:46,840
it wants to, it should look and

80
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,930
feel like you're sitting there as

81
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:50,359
a sales guy, just sending them a

82
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:51,439
personal message because it's

83
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:52,459
going to get more attention.

84
00:01:52,459 --> 00:01:53,640
And then also if they do respond,

85
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:53,840
it's

86
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:54,849
easier to handle that

87
00:01:54,849 --> 00:01:56,310
conversation, et cetera, et

88
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:56,819
cetera.

89
00:01:56,819 --> 00:01:58,280
But through Go High Level, it's

90
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:58,980
super easy.

91
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,829
You just click the reminder button

92
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:02,260
as I showed you guys additional

93
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:02,840
emails.

94
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,060
Like it's brain dead simple

95
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:06,420
inside of there because Go High

96
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:07,299
Level is your CRM.

97
00:02:07,299 --> 00:02:08,740
So you guys are in luck there.

98
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:10,800
Now, this is a sample

99
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,039
copy, but the action that we want

100
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:15,199
them to take is what's important

101
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:17,370
that I think everybody should add

102
00:02:17,379 --> 00:02:17,520
the

103
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:17,849
same.

104
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:19,060
So, Hey, just need a minute of

105
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:20,349
your time before our, whatever

106
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:21,280
your call name is.

107
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,840
Hi, Dan.

108
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,689
Thanks for booking in with us.

109
00:02:23,689 --> 00:02:24,509
Just a couple of things I wanted

110
00:02:24,509 --> 00:02:25,430
to make sure you received before

111
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:25,639
our

112
00:02:25,969 --> 00:02:26,960
meeting the calendar invites.

113
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,229
Since Google policy changes, when

114
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,599
you book in through a third party

115
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,840
scheduling tool, the calendar

116
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,159
invite will not automatically

117
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:33,699
appear on your calendar unless you

118
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,009
have had previous contact with the

119
00:02:35,009 --> 00:02:35,680
center myself.

120
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,789
So please make sure you add the

121
00:02:36,789 --> 00:02:37,599
appointment to your

122
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,840
calendar using the calendar icon

123
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:39,199
below.

124
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:40,460
There's nothing here, but you can

125
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:41,569
see there's a little add

126
00:02:41,689 --> 00:02:43,310
to calendar icon inside of there.

127
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:44,800
Once you do make sure you accept

128
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,419
it as well.

129
00:02:45,419 --> 00:02:46,840
This way, you'll have

130
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,090
the time blocked off.

131
00:02:48,139 --> 00:02:49,919
So you do not get double booked.

132
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:52,300
Uh, the Google meet zoom link, uh,

133
00:02:52,409 --> 00:02:52,659
located

134
00:02:52,889 --> 00:02:53,879
inside of the calendar invite.

135
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:54,819
If you're having trouble with

136
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:56,050
either, shoot me a message.

137
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:56,300
I'll help

138
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:57,099
out right away.

139
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,650
If you're all set, just respond to

140
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:00,270
this email saying, good to go.

141
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:01,460
The reason why this

142
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:02,830
is the first email that seems, and

143
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:03,909
this is pretty boilerplate

144
00:03:03,909 --> 00:03:05,229
regardless of what company, but

145
00:03:05,229 --> 00:03:05,620
this is

146
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,129
what I'd recommend that seems

147
00:03:07,129 --> 00:03:07,969
pretty basic.

148
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:09,729
Um, is because it is let's, let's

149
00:03:09,729 --> 00:03:11,039
not over-complicate it.

150
00:03:11,229 --> 00:03:12,370
Number one, the calendar invite

151
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:13,599
and whether they accept that or

152
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:14,900
not is going to be the highest

153
00:03:15,259 --> 00:03:17,250
indicator as to whether they show

154
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:19,669
up or not, especially the colder

155
00:03:19,669 --> 00:03:20,680
traffic you get.

156
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:20,979
It's,

157
00:03:21,139 --> 00:03:23,569
it's crazy how you can just look

158
00:03:23,699 --> 00:03:26,719
at a slate of calls in the day.

159
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:28,240
And if four of six have accepted

160
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,860
the calendar invite, your, your

161
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:31,419
show rate is probably going to end

162
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:32,620
up being four out of six

163
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:33,139
for that day.

164
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,139
So let's just get them to take

165
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:34,680
that action.

166
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,819
So they have it on their calendar.

167
00:03:35,979 --> 00:03:37,610
And then second, the call to

168
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:39,479
action of saying good to go is

169
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:42,560
important because, you know,

170
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:44,240
one, it's just getting some buy-in

171
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:44,879
from them.

172
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,060
It's, it's starting the

173
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,699
conversation sooner rather

174
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,129
than later, which is important.

175
00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:50,289
But two, if they don't do it, it

176
00:03:50,419 --> 00:03:52,039
kind of just, you know, sets off

177
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:53,449
that first alarm bell of like,

178
00:03:53,449 --> 00:03:54,840
okay, we should be a little bit

179
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,439
more cautious with this prospect

180
00:03:56,439 --> 00:03:56,680
in

181
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,750
terms of just reaching out to

182
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:58,909
them, make sure they get to the

183
00:03:58,909 --> 00:03:59,219
call.

184
00:03:59,219 --> 00:04:00,599
Email two, 24 hours before,

185
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:01,000
right?

186
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,490
So like for us, when we do the 24

187
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:03,870
hours before email, it's just a

188
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:04,960
general email that comes

189
00:04:05,129 --> 00:04:05,960
from Calendly.

190
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,550
But if you're doing it from go

191
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,509
high level, this is just some more

192
00:04:09,509 --> 00:04:10,340
sample copy.

193
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,259
Look forward to our meeting

194
00:04:11,259 --> 00:04:11,689
tomorrow.

195
00:04:11,699 --> 00:04:12,780
I'd recommend checking out this

196
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:13,629
video before the call.

197
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:13,740
So we

198
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,319
can hit the ground running VSL

199
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:15,759
link.

200
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:17,500
So you just, you know, plug that

201
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,660
link right there,

202
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:20,339
whatever that looks like for you

203
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:20,759
guys.

204
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:22,000
I'll just leave it.

205
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,120
Here's some recent client success

206
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:24,639
stories.

207
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,050
You know, you can plug another

208
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:26,649
link here.

209
00:04:26,649 --> 00:04:28,240
Other than that, please make sure

210
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,199
you accept the calendar

211
00:04:29,509 --> 00:04:29,660
invite.

212
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,089
So my assistant doesn't take that

213
00:04:31,089 --> 00:04:32,250
off my calendar and we'll be

214
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,240
meeting on the blank.

215
00:04:34,459 --> 00:04:35,829
Zoom link in there.

216
00:04:35,829 --> 00:04:38,509
Guys, this is a really strong

217
00:04:38,529 --> 00:04:41,709
frame that's worked well for me.

218
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,480
I don't even have

219
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:43,560
an assistant, but I'll just

220
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,529
consistently say that.

221
00:04:44,529 --> 00:04:45,730
Hey, yeah, accept the calendar

222
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:46,240
invite.

223
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:46,779
So the

224
00:04:47,139 --> 00:04:48,029
assistant doesn't take it off my

225
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:49,339
calendar because I don't want to

226
00:04:49,339 --> 00:04:50,680
be a dick, but I do want them to

227
00:04:51,029 --> 00:04:52,199
accept the calendar invite.

228
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:53,540
So I'm just going to act as if

229
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,490
like, Hey, you have to do it or

230
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:56,680
there could

231
00:04:56,829 --> 00:04:57,990
be some consequences, right?

232
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,300
You're just adding a little stakes

233
00:04:59,300 --> 00:04:59,839
into there.

234
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:00,680
Talk soon, Dan.

235
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,079
So pretty

236
00:05:01,269 --> 00:05:01,529
simple.

237
00:05:01,529 --> 00:05:02,579
You know, here's VSL.

238
00:05:02,579 --> 00:05:03,579
Here's case studies.

239
00:05:03,579 --> 00:05:04,930
If you have them, uh, make sure

240
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:05,439
you accept that

241
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,399
calendar invite.

242
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:07,910
So the system doesn't take it off

243
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:08,639
my calendar.

244
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,149
Um, one hour before this is where

245
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:10,319
it's

246
00:05:10,459 --> 00:05:11,230
like, okay, they should have

247
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:12,160
already accepted the calendar

248
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:12,420
invite.

249
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,540
Even if they didn't, if they're

250
00:05:13,709 --> 00:05:14,709
seeing this, they might not even

251
00:05:14,709 --> 00:05:15,529
go in and accept that.

252
00:05:15,529 --> 00:05:16,600
Like they see it in an hour,

253
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,160
they're either

254
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:18,790
going to show up or they won't.

255
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:20,540
Um, hi, Dan, looking forward to

256
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:21,139
our chat.

257
00:05:21,139 --> 00:05:22,079
An hour from now,

258
00:05:22,209 --> 00:05:23,829
we've personally helped insert

259
00:05:23,829 --> 00:05:24,620
authority.

260
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:26,490
You know, obviously if, if we can

261
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:27,540
have, if we

262
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:29,360
have any type of credibility,

263
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,240
let's, let's put it right there so

264
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:32,670
that they listen to what

265
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:33,790
we say next, which is if you

266
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:35,149
haven't already, be sure to watch

267
00:05:35,149 --> 00:05:36,519
this video explaining how we

268
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:36,730
blank.

269
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:37,680
Don't hesitate to reach out.

270
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,579
If you need anything else in our

271
00:05:38,579 --> 00:05:39,300
room for the meeting,

272
00:05:39,459 --> 00:05:40,040
look forward to it.

273
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,360
So the email side is pretty

274
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:41,889
simple.

275
00:05:42,019 --> 00:05:44,879
Um, the text message side is

276
00:05:45,069 --> 00:05:46,980
also relatively simple, but you

277
00:05:47,089 --> 00:05:49,319
guys may be asking, Hey, shouldn't

278
00:05:49,379 --> 00:05:50,670
I just automate this

279
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,300
through go high level?

280
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,370
Um, no, the short answer is you

281
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:56,339
want to be using an iPhone.

282
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:57,949
So for all of you guys that have

283
00:05:57,949 --> 00:05:59,620
an iPhone, great for all of you

284
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:01,240
that don't have an iPhone.

285
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,100
Um,

286
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,850
I would recommend getting one.

287
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:05,420
I think you will just make more

288
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:07,240
money and come off as more serious

289
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:09,009
pre-call post-call having an

290
00:06:09,009 --> 00:06:09,589
iPhone.

291
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,569
I'm sorry to all the Android guys

292
00:06:11,569 --> 00:06:12,459
out there.

293
00:06:12,459 --> 00:06:13,540
Um, and also

294
00:06:13,699 --> 00:06:14,680
they, they just get really good

295
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,889
connection rates on cold calls and

296
00:06:15,899 --> 00:06:16,699
things like that.

297
00:06:16,699 --> 00:06:17,009
Obviously

298
00:06:17,139 --> 00:06:18,000
you're not going to use it to do

299
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
hundreds of cold calls, but if

300
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,019
you're doing a small line,

301
00:06:20,149 --> 00:06:21,089
it's a good idea.

302
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:22,839
Anyways, like I said, if your

303
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:24,779
callers and I have one, it's worth

304
00:06:24,779 --> 00:06:25,399
using an

305
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:26,779
automated provider like send blue

306
00:06:26,779 --> 00:06:27,199
or link.

307
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:28,529
Uh, and at scale, you're going to

308
00:06:28,529 --> 00:06:29,560
want to automate this

309
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:30,870
right when you're dealing with

310
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:31,779
hundreds of calls.

311
00:06:31,779 --> 00:06:32,920
Uh, so send blue link or two

312
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:33,899
different providers.

313
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:35,040
I'd prefer link.

314
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,829
This is the platform that I use

315
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:38,839
currently to automate things.

316
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:39,720
Uh, the text message

317
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:41,019
sequences that go out on our guys'

318
00:06:41,019 --> 00:06:41,410
behalf.

319
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:42,730
So it looks like, and you know, it

320
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:43,120
feels like

321
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,439
everybody has their own dedicated

322
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:46,620
iPhone for us.

323
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:48,709
Um, so I need to update this now

324
00:06:48,709 --> 00:06:49,720
because this said

325
00:06:49,819 --> 00:06:50,970
we were only using it for two or

326
00:06:51,019 --> 00:06:52,310
seven reps, but you know, we're

327
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:53,689
using it for all seven reps.

328
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:54,420
Uh,

329
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,829
but up until that point, you know,

330
00:06:55,829 --> 00:06:57,009
as you can see here, everybody

331
00:06:57,139 --> 00:06:58,389
else was just doing it manually

332
00:06:58,569 --> 00:06:59,569
from their iPhone.

333
00:06:59,569 --> 00:07:01,459
We saw an immediate boost though,

334
00:07:01,459 --> 00:07:02,819
and successfully saving

335
00:07:02,829 --> 00:07:04,699
reschedules when the text

336
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:05,949
went out that same day, the call

337
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,290
is booked for the appointments.

338
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:08,660
So, so let me put it this way,

339
00:07:09,019 --> 00:07:09,639
guys.

340
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:13,079
Right after they book, if I'm on

341
00:07:13,089 --> 00:07:15,649
my phone, I'm sending them one of

342
00:07:15,649 --> 00:07:17,959
these texts immediately.

343
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,269
And the reason why we want to

344
00:07:19,269 --> 00:07:20,939
start that conversation as soon as

345
00:07:20,939 --> 00:07:22,019
possible is because

346
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,870
if we're, if we're looking at no

347
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:27,360
shows, um, let's say 60% of the

348
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,339
people that book an appointment,

349
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:30,740
so long as you're booking windows,

350
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:31,930
like three days out are going to

351
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:32,360
show up.

352
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:38,189
10% are

353
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,089
just never going to show up,

354
00:07:42,089 --> 00:07:42,459
right?

355
00:07:42,459 --> 00:07:43,689
They're, they're just weren't

356
00:07:43,689 --> 00:07:44,500
serious people.

357
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,019
They're funnel

358
00:07:45,379 --> 00:07:47,120
hacking, whatever.

359
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:50,769
Um, another 10% there, you know,

360
00:07:50,769 --> 00:07:53,959
people that like kind of see, uh,

361
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:54,240
you know,

362
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,339
other alternatives and they, they

363
00:07:56,449 --> 00:07:58,339
want to reschedule and whatnot,

364
00:07:58,339 --> 00:08:00,240
but like 20% genuinely

365
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,550
do want to show up.

366
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:03,269
They're just bad at calendar

367
00:08:03,269 --> 00:08:04,199
management.

368
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:06,339
Um, and they genuinely could have

369
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:08,199
gotten busy with something else.

370
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:08,680
Right.

371
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,350
So whatever you essentially what

372
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:11,839
I'm trying to say is 60% are

373
00:08:12,089 --> 00:08:12,810
going to show up.

374
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:14,769
20% are jokers and 20% are people

375
00:08:14,769 --> 00:08:16,199
that do want to show up that have

376
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:16,879
interest,

377
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,699
but they're bad at calendar

378
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:19,720
management.

379
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,560
They may get busy with something

380
00:08:21,579 --> 00:08:21,920
else.

381
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,240
So probably

382
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:23,259
frame that pretty poorly.

383
00:08:23,259 --> 00:08:24,339
The reason why it's important to

384
00:08:24,449 --> 00:08:26,160
start the conversation as soon as

385
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:27,800
possible is because by doing that,

386
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,019
you're going to catch those

387
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:29,779
reschedules.

388
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:30,860
You're going to catch

389
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:31,740
the person that was like,

390
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:32,970
actually, it's, it's going to make

391
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:34,059
more sense for us next week.

392
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:35,548
Cause I haven't even talked to my

393
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:37,029
boss yet about what the budget is

394
00:08:37,029 --> 00:08:38,500
for this, or actually it's going

395
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:39,360
to make more sense tomorrow.

396
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,200
Cause I forgot I have a doctor's

397
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,019
appointment today, or actually I

398
00:08:42,019 --> 00:08:42,320
have

399
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,559
this as opposed to that.

400
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,049
If you catch the reschedules,

401
00:08:45,049 --> 00:08:46,759
you're going to have such a higher

402
00:08:47,179 --> 00:08:48,779
likelihood of actually getting

403
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:50,789
them back on calendar because for

404
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,279
whatever reason, if people

405
00:08:52,539 --> 00:08:53,990
reschedule or if people miss the

406
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:55,679
appointment, even if it's for an

407
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:57,259
earnest reason, like a doctor's

408
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:58,500
appointment, they have like this

409
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,509
weird social anxiety about

410
00:08:59,509 --> 00:09:00,289
reaching back out.

411
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:00,879
Cause they're

412
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:01,820
like, Oh fuck.

413
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,350
I kind of did this guy dirty.

414
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:05,070
Like I'm nervous to reach back out

415
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:05,659
to him.

416
00:09:05,659 --> 00:09:06,360
So it's not

417
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,549
about these text messages and

418
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:10,899
starting a conversation as soon as

419
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,789
possible, being responsible for

420
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,639
all 80% of the

421
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:16,990
people that could show up.

422
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,799
It's like 60% probably would have

423
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:20,500
anyways, but we can increase that

424
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:20,679
show

425
00:09:20,889 --> 00:09:22,730
rate from 60% to 80% just by

426
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:24,690
starting the conversation sooner

427
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:26,080
rather than later.

428
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:27,009
All right.

429
00:09:27,009 --> 00:09:28,929
So text one and two, pretty

430
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,700
simple.

431
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:31,899
Hey name, Dan from client

432
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:32,519
Ascension here.

433
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:34,320
The reason I put send is like just

434
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,179
text like a human, you know, quick

435
00:09:37,179 --> 00:09:37,250
message, send quick message, send

436
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:39,159
like people double text like that,

437
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:41,080
as opposed to just sending a long

438
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:41,240
text.

439
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,259
You see the zoom link inside of

440
00:09:42,259 --> 00:09:43,700
the counter invite morning of the

441
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,919
call, essentially sharing this.

442
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,049
The reason why you want to say,

443
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:47,809
let me know if you have any

444
00:09:47,809 --> 00:09:48,769
trouble with the link.

445
00:09:48,769 --> 00:09:50,429
And you can also look at this.

446
00:09:50,429 --> 00:09:51,080
Same thing.

447
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,490
Send pretty quick.

448
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:53,480
Do you see the zoom link inside of

449
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:53,950
the counter invite?

450
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:56,059
The reason why I'm not going to

451
00:09:56,059 --> 00:09:56,059
say,

452
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:58,429
I'm just going for a quick

453
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,899
question here as opposed to trying

454
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,159
to get them over assets too

455
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:06,840
quickly is because with the new

456
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,690
iOS updates, if I send somebody

457
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:11,029
something that even if that's

458
00:10:11,029 --> 00:10:12,940
iPhone, iPhone, and they haven't

459
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:14,450
had previous communication with

460
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:16,049
me, that link is not going to show

461
00:10:16,049 --> 00:10:17,669
up as clickable.

462
00:10:17,669 --> 00:10:19,080
The moment they respond.

463
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,309
The link then shows up as

464
00:10:20,309 --> 00:10:21,080
clickable.

465
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,639
So, but before that it's plain

466
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:23,049
text.

467
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,019
So by having like a very clear

468
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:27,039
question, uh, do you see the zoom

469
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:29,080
link inside of the counter invite?

470
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:29,539
Yes.

471
00:10:29,539 --> 00:10:30,070
Cool.

472
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:31,830
After that, I'm going to send them

473
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:33,059
over the VSL so they can respond.

474
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,889
Uh, and then if it's like, okay,

475
00:10:34,889 --> 00:10:36,330
last chance, they haven't

476
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:38,080
responded to anything yet.

477
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:38,919
Morning of the call.

478
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:40,070
I'm still just going to say, let

479
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:41,330
me know if you have any trouble

480
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:42,080
with the link.

481
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,460
So maybe they copy and paste it,

482
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:44,320
or maybe they're like, yeah, this

483
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,080
link doesn't work.

484
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,570
But then as soon as they send that

485
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:47,080
text message, the link works.

486
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,320
Even if it was a previous text

487
00:10:48,379 --> 00:10:48,870
message.

488
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:50,169
So it's a little bit of a cat and

489
00:10:50,169 --> 00:10:51,429
mouse game where you're just

490
00:10:51,429 --> 00:10:52,789
trying to get them to respond so

491
00:10:52,789 --> 00:10:54,059
that you can send over things

492
00:10:54,059 --> 00:10:55,590
because you're looking at this.

493
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:57,210
You're like, well, Dan, what does

494
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:58,679
this do aside from making sure you

495
00:10:58,679 --> 00:11:00,200
see the counter invite?

496
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,950
It usually elicits a response,

497
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:03,610
which then allows us to send over

498
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:05,070
links, which will then be

499
00:11:05,149 --> 00:11:06,000
clickable.

500
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,299
So let me know if you have any

501
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:08,419
questions on this.

502
00:11:08,419 --> 00:11:10,309
Uh, only other thing I would add

503
00:11:10,309 --> 00:11:10,460
is.

504
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,429
It's been night and day when our

505
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,070
sales guys shifted their mindset

506
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:20,179
from, I'm just going to talk to

507
00:11:20,289 --> 00:11:21,840
this person on the call and see

508
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,210
how it goes to, I'm going to try

509
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:24,509
to talk to this person as soon as

510
00:11:24,509 --> 00:11:24,990
they book.

511
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:26,769
And just be proactive about the

512
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:27,539
conversation.

513
00:11:27,539 --> 00:11:29,679
Their calendar efficiency is way

514
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:30,399
better.

515
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:31,480
Meaning like they're catching

516
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,460
reschedules earlier.

517
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:33,899
Their show rate in general is

518
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:34,460
better.

519
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,580
And even their conversations are

520
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:36,529
better because usually these

521
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:37,779
people share a little bit of

522
00:11:37,779 --> 00:11:38,340
context.

523
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:39,809
So make sure you're doing this and

524
00:11:39,809 --> 00:11:41,379
make sure via text, you're really

525
00:11:41,379 --> 00:11:43,330
making an effort to get to these

526
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:45,500
people as quickly as possible.

527
00:11:45,669 --> 00:11:47,960
The last thing that I'll say is if

528
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,159
you have this email that has a

529
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:51,500
call to action.

530
00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:54,179
Um, you have this email, you have

531
00:11:54,179 --> 00:11:57,049
this email, um, yeah, the text,

532
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:59,700
they haven't opened any emails.

533
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:00,850
They haven't responded to any

534
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:01,299
emails.

535
00:12:01,299 --> 00:12:02,340
They haven't responded to any

536
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:02,679
text.

537
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:04,299
I would also recommend just giving

538
00:12:04,299 --> 00:12:05,340
these guys a quick call in the

539
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:05,840
morning.

540
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,269
Uh, it just to remind them of the

541
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:08,259
appointment.

542
00:12:08,259 --> 00:12:09,440
Once again, it's, it's, it's, it's

543
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,500
one of those situations where

544
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,450
either it's like, yep, cool.

545
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:13,250
I'm ready, man.

546
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:13,500
So no harm, no foul.

547
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,450
So no harm, no foul.

548
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:15,809
This person wasn't going to show

549
00:12:15,809 --> 00:12:16,090
up.

550
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:16,629
Okay.

551
00:12:16,629 --> 00:12:17,840
That's also cool.

552
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,850
I'd rather find that out now at

553
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:19,840
the beginning of my day, as

554
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:20,799
opposed to the end.

555
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:22,159
So I can get that off my calendar

556
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:23,379
and get something else more

557
00:12:23,379 --> 00:12:24,720
productive in there, or it's a

558
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,360
reschedule.

559
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:26,500
We catch the reschedule.

560
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,559
So there's a lot of work.

561
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:28,860
There's a lot of stuff, um, that

562
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:30,039
goes on before the call.

563
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:31,179
So I'm happy that this is a

564
00:12:31,179 --> 00:12:32,649
dedicated video of its own, but

565
00:12:32,649 --> 00:12:33,990
let me know if you guys have any

566
00:12:34,059 --> 00:12:35,159
questions on all this.

567
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:36,690
Of course, I'm going to link this

568
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:37,620
document as well.

569
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:38,500
Thanks guys.
