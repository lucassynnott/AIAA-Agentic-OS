1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,199
Okay so now we're going to get

2
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:02,850
into selling automation without

3
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:04,000
sounding like a nerd or

4
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,809
snake oil salesman one of the big

5
00:00:05,809 --> 00:00:07,690
problems with automation is it's

6
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:09,039
very technical people don't

7
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:11,250
really understand it or it's very

8
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:13,169
buzzwordy where people start

9
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:15,839
bringing in the words ai agents

10
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:16,079
this

11
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,320
that the other thing and like

12
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,719
prospects are getting confused

13
00:00:18,789 --> 00:00:20,160
they're gonna get overwhelmed

14
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:22,309
and they won't buy so let's get

15
00:00:22,309 --> 00:00:24,710
into it so the number one beginner

16
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:27,519
mistake is do you want an ai

17
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,879
call agent so you come in there

18
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:30,390
leading with tools and solutions

19
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:32,000
before really understanding their

20
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:33,289
problems and that creates

21
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:35,039
resistance because it just feels

22
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:37,070
like you're you're coming in with

23
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:37,520
like

24
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:39,409
a shopping cart full of ai agents

25
00:00:39,409 --> 00:00:41,229
you're like which one would you

26
00:00:41,229 --> 00:00:42,670
like sir and that's not really

27
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,530
gonna work to be honest they feel

28
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:45,659
like they're being sold to rather

29
00:00:45,659 --> 00:00:46,159
than helped

30
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,469
alternatively you want to approach

31
00:00:48,469 --> 00:00:50,460
it with being curious i would say

32
00:00:50,539 --> 00:00:51,240
is the biggest

33
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,250
skill set to have here so they

34
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:54,829
mention yeah we're really

35
00:00:54,829 --> 00:00:56,590
struggling with no shows

36
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,700
um and then you go okay well how

37
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,859
do you handle those shows today

38
00:01:00,869 --> 00:01:02,909
and you start understanding

39
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:04,890
their situation and they say oh

40
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:06,750
well we have them in our crm but

41
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,469
then we sometimes follow up

42
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:09,200
sometimes

43
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,629
we forget to okay so like when you

44
00:01:11,629 --> 00:01:13,700
do follow up do you ever like

45
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:16,120
convert any of those people like

46
00:01:16,129 --> 00:01:16,480
are

47
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,299
they actually still good prospects

48
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:19,980
oh yeah most definitely like they

49
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:21,670
booked a meeting they filled out a

50
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,000
form

51
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:23,790
they're probably still interested

52
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:25,299
in our product but we just like

53
00:01:25,299 --> 00:01:27,519
forget to do it so would you say

54
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:28,739
if we were to build you an

55
00:01:28,739 --> 00:01:30,379
automation that automatically

56
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:33,200
followed up with them um and ask

57
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:34,239
them to rebook on

58
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:36,189
your calendar and they rebooked

59
00:01:36,189 --> 00:01:38,280
that maybe there's a chance they'd

60
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,640
buy oh yeah probably so it's that

61
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:42,510
line of questioning where you got

62
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:44,439
to dig deeper and understand their

63
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:46,290
current situation and see how

64
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,079
your systems could help um so

65
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,049
that's the better approach as

66
00:01:50,049 --> 00:01:52,030
opposed to just like trying to

67
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:52,480
throw

68
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,260
any automation you can think of at

69
00:01:54,269 --> 00:01:56,219
them so don't sell a tool diagnose

70
00:01:56,219 --> 00:01:56,780
a problem

71
00:01:57,519 --> 00:01:58,519
the most common mistake new

72
00:01:58,519 --> 00:01:59,790
automation consultants make is

73
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:00,939
skipping discovery and just

74
00:02:00,969 --> 00:02:01,920
recommending new

75
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,459
tools without really understanding

76
00:02:04,459 --> 00:02:06,719
what's the issue in the business

77
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,120
to help you with this

78
00:02:09,189 --> 00:02:10,879
to find problems that are actually

79
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:12,710
worth solving and that automation

80
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:13,919
can actually solve you want

81
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,530
to use something i call the rev

82
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:17,229
and lev framework so every

83
00:02:17,229 --> 00:02:19,460
automation solution you propose

84
00:02:19,909 --> 00:02:20,319
must solve

85
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,550
one or of two fundamental business

86
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:24,389
needs increasing revenue or

87
00:02:24,389 --> 00:02:26,479
creating leverage if it doesn't do

88
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:26,879
either

89
00:02:26,949 --> 00:02:28,349
it's likely not worth pursuing

90
00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:29,819
it's really hard to come up with

91
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:31,180
an roi if it doesn't do any of

92
00:02:31,259 --> 00:02:31,949
these so

93
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,939
when it comes to rev this is code

94
00:02:33,939 --> 00:02:36,039
word for revenue um you want to

95
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:38,000
generate more sales you want to

96
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,780
capture misleads like the example

97
00:02:39,789 --> 00:02:41,500
i gave earlier you want to improve

98
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:43,039
conversion rates any of these

99
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:43,090
things

100
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,939
enable upsell opportunities one of

101
00:02:44,939 --> 00:02:46,479
the first automations i built for

102
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:47,919
a client was they wanted to launch

103
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:48,319
a new

104
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,240
offer but instead of paying a

105
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,159
developer a ton of money they

106
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:53,889
hired me as a no code developer

107
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,560
and i quickly

108
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:58,810
made a automation in make.com that

109
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:02,349
enabled them to look at the data

110
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:04,479
of people visiting their website

111
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:05,039
and

112
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,539
their prospects what or their

113
00:03:06,539 --> 00:03:08,280
clients websites um see what links

114
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,000
they were clicking on and then we

115
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,689
use ai to

116
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,569
categorize um what the product

117
00:03:12,569 --> 00:03:14,490
they were likely interested in so

118
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:16,719
that's an example of you know he

119
00:03:16,789 --> 00:03:17,210
was able to

120
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,719
take that simple automation i

121
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:20,020
built and use it as a proof of

122
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:22,240
concept to see if his existing

123
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:22,370
clients

124
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:24,080
would buy this new software we had

125
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,419
built another one is a leverage so

126
00:03:27,419 --> 00:03:30,789
pretty straightforward saving time

127
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:32,340
this is by far the number one

128
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,949
thing uh we talk about when it

129
00:03:33,949 --> 00:03:35,840
comes to ai can save you time make

130
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,240
you more

131
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,870
productive but yeah always trying

132
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:41,789
to classify the pain points as a

133
00:03:42,129 --> 00:03:45,439
one or two of these categories so

134
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:45,840
building

135
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:47,270
farther on the right line of

136
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:48,840
question the right way to sell

137
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,909
this is it's diagnosis not not

138
00:03:51,219 --> 00:03:52,000
persuasion so

139
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,199
start very broad very high level

140
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:54,310
where are you spending most of

141
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:56,300
your time right now what happens

142
00:03:56,389 --> 00:03:57,500
if this process issue continues

143
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,539
for another year like are you

144
00:03:58,539 --> 00:03:59,509
going to be able to grow your

145
00:03:59,509 --> 00:04:00,240
business still

146
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,439
what does your team keep

147
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:02,960
forgetting or missing are you

148
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,479
losing money because of this

149
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,210
where do clients and prospects

150
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:08,460
slip through the cracks all these

151
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:10,400
questions are opportunities to

152
00:04:10,469 --> 00:04:10,719
just

153
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,430
understand real problems so you

154
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:15,129
can actually solve them next after

155
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:18,949
you've understood the problem you

156
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:19,120
need

157
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,800
to ask questions but okay so how

158
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,430
many hours is it taking what is

159
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,920
the hourly rate and this is

160
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,160
something

161
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,709
that daniel talks about having

162
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,279
like an roi calculator this can

163
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:28,639
help you can just have this

164
00:04:28,709 --> 00:04:30,189
on your screen um plugging this in

165
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:31,810
whether it's just a spreadsheet or

166
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:33,360
something you make in a tool

167
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,509
really quickly like lovable bolt

168
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:37,490
whatever the case may be and you

169
00:04:37,509 --> 00:04:39,360
can see here okay i spend five

170
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:39,680
hours

171
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,490
a week on manual follow-ups my

172
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:43,370
hourly rate is fifty dollars an

173
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:44,769
hour so that's going to cost

174
00:04:44,769 --> 00:04:45,329
thirteen

175
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,360
thousand dollars annual

176
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,519
productivity it's like okay well

177
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:49,019
what if we could build you an

178
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:50,160
automation that

179
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,110
automatically follows up with your

180
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:53,790
clients um and that's just your

181
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:57,089
lost productivity of the the time

182
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,870
that it's taking them but what if

183
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:00,290
we could also by doing this

184
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:02,189
because sometimes the person will

185
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:02,250
forget

186
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,430
to do it like we talked about

187
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:06,779
earlier we actually you sold some

188
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:09,120
deals from the follow-up people

189
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:09,399
actually

190
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:10,800
came back like hey we want to buy

191
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,240
your product well that could say

192
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,740
make even more money so you know

193
00:05:13,819 --> 00:05:13,920
just

194
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,629
the thirteen thousand dollars off

195
00:05:15,629 --> 00:05:16,939
the time savings but not to

196
00:05:16,939 --> 00:05:18,470
mention the opportunity cost

197
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,550
how about we charge you twenty

198
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:20,620
five hundred dollars and that

199
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:21,759
feels like a huge bargain it's

200
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:22,069
like wow

201
00:05:22,149 --> 00:05:23,040
you're going to save time i'm

202
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,040
going to make money and you're

203
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:24,949
only charging me twenty five

204
00:05:25,009 --> 00:05:25,670
hundred dollars

205
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,379
for that um you can see how by

206
00:05:27,379 --> 00:05:29,329
framing it this way it becomes a

207
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,759
lot easier to sell these

208
00:05:30,829 --> 00:05:31,329
automations

209
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:34,759
versus if you just say hey i'm a

210
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:38,160
automation integration guy go to

211
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:40,560
fiverr right now while you're

212
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:41,910
watching this just go to fiverr

213
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:43,430
and search like n8 and automation

214
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:44,959
consultant there's guys on there

215
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,060
charging like five dollars an hour

216
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:49,000
to do this same work it's because

217
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,620
their packaging is so poor they

218
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,470
don't know how to do stuff like

219
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:54,360
this right so you need to the only

220
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,230
way you can differentiate yourself

221
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:57,639
from those guys is by doing things

222
00:05:57,639 --> 00:05:59,100
like this and having conversations

223
00:05:59,170 --> 00:05:59,589
like this

224
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,439
another really valuable question i

225
00:06:02,439 --> 00:06:04,680
like to use is once i understand

226
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,889
maybe their biggest problem or

227
00:06:06,889 --> 00:06:08,740
maybe we're having a hard time

228
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:10,639
figuring it out i i pull out this

229
00:06:10,949 --> 00:06:11,360
one i'm like

230
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:12,649
hey if i were like a wizard and

231
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,100
could fix your biggest problem

232
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,839
right now what would it be and why

233
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,209
and then they just like brain dump

234
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:20,259
and you start to understand a

235
00:06:20,259 --> 00:06:22,639
little bit more like okay okay

236
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:22,759
that

237
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:23,990
sounds good and it's like so why

238
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:24,990
like why is that actually a

239
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:27,279
problem though like you've run

240
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:27,350
your

241
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:29,319
business up to this point like oh

242
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:31,120
well you know like if i don't do

243
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,439
this i'm not gonna grow blah blah

244
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:35,050
okay and like have you tried

245
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:37,079
anything else like what happens if

246
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:39,040
it's not fixed all the good best

247
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,550
practice sales questions that the

248
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:41,910
sales modules are going to teach

249
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:43,839
you this is how you tailor this to

250
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,839
the automation business model so

251
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:47,899
what happens if it's not fixed and

252
00:06:47,899 --> 00:06:49,500
then you're like okay what would

253
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:50,930
change if it was like how would

254
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:52,319
you actually use that time better

255
00:06:52,389 --> 00:06:53,180
if i fix this problem

256
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:55,699
you want to paint that picture for

257
00:06:55,699 --> 00:06:55,920
them

258
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:03,199
the other thing here is automation

259
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:04,329
is one of those things this is

260
00:07:04,329 --> 00:07:06,639
typically done online right

261
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,189
you're not physically going in and

262
00:07:08,189 --> 00:07:09,629
like plugging wires in together

263
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:10,079
for them

264
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,100
um so they don't really know what

265
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,120
the hell automation is it's just

266
00:07:14,129 --> 00:07:14,800
like code

267
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,300
um so you have to make it visual

268
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,870
you have to think of yourself as

269
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,759
like a graphic designer almost

270
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:21,699
but instead of showing them a

271
00:07:21,699 --> 00:07:23,519
graphic design you're showing them

272
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:26,240
that canvas of all the

273
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:27,829
different steps that are happening

274
00:07:27,829 --> 00:07:28,879
and that's why the no code

275
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:30,160
builders is so nice because you

276
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:30,319
can

277
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:32,360
actually visually show them what's

278
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,180
happening um and you can also get

279
00:07:34,189 --> 00:07:36,879
them to visualize and like

280
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,800
see themselves in that by being

281
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,319
like okay here's a flow or

282
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:41,959
automation i built for another

283
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,319
client in

284
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:43,870
your industry in your case based

285
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:45,459
on what you told me we'd customize

286
00:07:45,459 --> 00:07:46,800
this part here to handle your

287
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:48,480
specific lead capture process

288
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,220
instead of using calendly we're

289
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,839
going to use cal.com instead of

290
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,379
using type form we're going to use

291
00:07:53,379 --> 00:07:54,709
fill out but the the process is

292
00:07:54,769 --> 00:07:56,920
still the same so you want to come

293
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,589
in with with that expertise to

294
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,360
show okay this guy probably knows

295
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,839
what he's doing he's built

296
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:02,079
something

297
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,610
very similar and even if it's not

298
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:05,160
similar still show them like hey

299
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,040
look at this automation like

300
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,449
this is how we build it um and

301
00:08:08,449 --> 00:08:10,279
maybe even just start dragging and

302
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:12,120
dropping modules on the screen of

303
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:12,160
like

304
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:13,870
hey like in your case we'd pull

305
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:15,629
this put this module connect this

306
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:17,279
one to this one and so on and so

307
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:17,410
forth

308
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,120
obviously there's more planning we

309
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,470
need to do here but just give them

310
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:21,680
that feeling of they have that

311
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,360
certainty of what they're buying

312
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,759
um and yeah remember to anonymize

313
00:08:27,449 --> 00:08:29,509
client specific information so

314
00:08:29,589 --> 00:08:31,790
i try to typically um import json

315
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,179
files of like the automation from

316
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:35,679
the client account and just like

317
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:37,320
don't connect anything so they

318
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,019
don't see like what the specific

319
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:40,759
tweaks we did for the client are

320
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:42,320
because that is kind of their ip

321
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,100
another pro tip if you know you're

322
00:08:45,179 --> 00:08:47,120
struggling with all the other

323
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,139
stuff you still don't really

324
00:08:48,139 --> 00:08:49,330
understand what the hell is going

325
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:50,559
on based on what they're telling

326
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:50,620
you

327
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,559
they're not really good at sharing

328
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:54,009
the problem of like what's

329
00:08:54,009 --> 00:08:55,720
happening on their computer you

330
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:56,080
can ask

331
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:58,000
them a screen share um this is

332
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,330
very powerful automation because

333
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:02,960
what happens is have you ever

334
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:05,370
been in like driving and you leave

335
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:07,610
work and you get home and you're

336
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:09,879
like man i don't even know how i

337
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:10,159
got

338
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,070
here but like i my body did it we

339
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:14,200
were on autopilot we drove this is

340
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:16,399
what happens with most people when

341
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,950
they do repetitive processes at

342
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:19,490
work they're just like i've done

343
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:20,950
this a thousand times i don't

344
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,200
really

345
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:22,789
think about the steps so they

346
00:09:22,789 --> 00:09:24,600
explain it to somebody else most

347
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,840
people suck as teachers to be

348
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:27,759
honest so

349
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,570
then they like omit so many steps

350
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:31,320
because to them they take it for

351
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,850
granted so instead you say okay

352
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,360
can

353
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,509
you like share your screen and

354
00:09:34,509 --> 00:09:35,750
show me how you guys are actually

355
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,120
doing follow-up what are you guys

356
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:37,440
clicking

357
00:09:37,509 --> 00:09:39,019
on how is this actually working

358
00:09:39,019 --> 00:09:40,710
take them step by step because you

359
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:42,309
can see like broken processes

360
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,940
but yeah like then this part's

361
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:45,759
really messed up like it's really

362
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:47,179
hard to do this and you're like

363
00:09:47,179 --> 00:09:47,409
well

364
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:49,259
you could probably just click over

365
00:09:49,259 --> 00:09:50,320
there and if you could fix

366
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:51,830
something in that call in that

367
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:52,230
moment

368
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,820
you're also giving them free value

369
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,179
in that call they're like oh my

370
00:09:55,179 --> 00:09:56,480
god if like this guy could just

371
00:09:56,559 --> 00:09:57,730
like tell me that little tweak

372
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:59,080
what else does he know so there's

373
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,480
all these little psychological

374
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,029
things

375
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,919
that this approach actually helps

376
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:04,389
you with um and by far it just

377
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,080
helps you create a more robust

378
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:07,610
solution that actually works

379
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:09,259
because the worst thing of all is

380
00:10:09,259 --> 00:10:10,799
to get to the end of an automation

381
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:11,149
project

382
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:12,480
and then the customer being like

383
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:13,669
well this isn't exactly what i

384
00:10:13,669 --> 00:10:15,039
wanted because they

385
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,309
struggled to actually explain to

386
00:10:16,309 --> 00:10:17,120
you what they wanted

387
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:22,169
so yeah don't force automations

388
00:10:22,169 --> 00:10:23,799
you're going to sell clarity and

389
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:24,320
outcomes

390
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,360
and don't force one call closes

391
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,450
either i think a lot of people i'd

392
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,480
love to close on a long call but

393
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:32,080
sometimes that's not possible

394
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,559
there just isn't enough time

395
00:10:33,559 --> 00:10:35,679
especially with um what you're

396
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:35,840
trying

397
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:38,200
to uncover in this case sometimes

398
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,490
you can though so that's what i'm

399
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:42,720
saying don't take this as gospel

400
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:44,879
but this is typically the flow it

401
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:47,019
goes by first calls like you want

402
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:50,240
to qualify them and see if they

403
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,490
actually have a problem that it's

404
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:53,240
worth investigating farther second

405
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,360
call is you're like hey we're

406
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:55,840
going to

407
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:57,269
dive deeper into your process on

408
00:10:57,269 --> 00:10:58,429
the next call and just get a

409
00:10:58,429 --> 00:11:00,269
really good understanding i'll

410
00:11:00,269 --> 00:11:00,919
show you some

411
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,919
similar automations i built that

412
00:11:02,919 --> 00:11:04,879
apply here and just document their

413
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:06,169
current state really well

414
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,129
and then you're going to say okay

415
00:11:08,139 --> 00:11:10,029
next call we'll have a proposal

416
00:11:10,029 --> 00:11:11,440
ready for you to present a

417
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:11,519
recommendation

418
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,590
you're going to quantify the roi

419
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:14,789
of like if you do this you know

420
00:11:14,789 --> 00:11:16,159
that thirteen thousand dollar

421
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:16,370
thing i

422
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,409
showed earlier you're going to do

423
00:11:17,409 --> 00:11:18,320
exactly something like that

424
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,080
they're like and yeah so this is

425
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:20,320
going to

426
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,480
cost twenty five hundred dollars

427
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,450
and don't rush the close i think

428
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:26,559
there's this thing where it's not

429
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:28,600
every sales call needs to be a a

430
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,860
one call close and yeah just build

431
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,120
trust be a doctor understand their

432
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,850
business before you get to the end

433
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:38,190
so yeah those are my sales tips

434
00:11:38,269 --> 00:11:41,039
for running a automation agency
