1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,020
All right, so now I'm going to

2
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:04,509
talk about the core tool stack

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:05,459
and what you need to know.

4
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:07,099
So we'll start with automation

5
00:00:07,099 --> 00:00:07,639
tools.

6
00:00:07,719 --> 00:00:09,199
There's three main ones in the

7
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:09,720
space.

8
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:11,519
The first one in the space was

9
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:12,109
Zapier.

10
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,279
I don't recommend this one to

11
00:00:14,279 --> 00:00:14,919
start,

12
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,120
but I just want to let you know

13
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:16,800
that it exists.

14
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:18,829
And if sometimes there's things

15
00:00:18,829 --> 00:00:20,399
that need to use Zapier,

16
00:00:20,539 --> 00:00:22,100
maybe there's an integration with

17
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:22,719
just Zapier

18
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,420
that's not available via an API,

19
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,980
which you'll learn later what that

20
00:00:26,989 --> 00:00:27,260
is,

21
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:30,820
or it's available as like a module

22
00:00:30,899 --> 00:00:32,179
in the different automation

23
00:00:32,179 --> 00:00:32,840
platforms,

24
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,280
you'd have to go use Zapier,

25
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,179
unfortunately.

26
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:36,979
These are the two,

27
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:38,310
and these ones are called

28
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:40,460
step-based platforms, I would say.

29
00:00:40,539 --> 00:00:42,789
And what that means is each step

30
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:44,219
in the automation

31
00:00:44,299 --> 00:00:46,549
is what you get charged for.

32
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,259
There is some nuance there,

33
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:49,549
which I have a table here of like

34
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:50,159
when it's counted,

35
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:50,719
when it's not.

36
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:53,280
But each one of these squares here

37
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,979
is a step in the automation.

38
00:00:55,799 --> 00:00:58,210
And every time it runs, it charges

39
00:00:58,219 --> 00:00:58,679
you.

40
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:00,560
So if we come over to Zapier here,

41
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:04,560
we can see that if we come into

42
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,400
the plans,

43
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,750
it says I need 10,000 tasks per

44
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:08,359
month.

45
00:01:08,459 --> 00:01:09,840
So what is a task?

46
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,019
It's any actionable step.

47
00:01:12,099 --> 00:01:13,760
It does exclude like triggers and

48
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,859
things like that.

49
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:16,750
But yeah, I just wanted to show

50
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:17,319
you how,

51
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,659
when you see what is a task here,

52
00:01:19,859 --> 00:01:21,140
that's what this means.

53
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:22,310
And for Zapier, you're going to

54
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:23,590
need at least the pro plan.

55
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,790
They might give you a free trial

56
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:26,760
here to try,

57
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,590
but they won't really let you

58
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:30,040
connect to very many things

59
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,340
if you just use the free plan.

60
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:33,180
So yeah, that's Zapier in a

61
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,099
nutshell.

62
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:36,040
So if we come over to here,

63
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,180
then we have make.com.

64
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:38,730
So this is my primary platform of

65
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:39,260
choice.

66
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,379
This is where I started.

67
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:42,219
I do use a little bit of N1N as

68
00:01:42,219 --> 00:01:42,719
well.

69
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:44,409
But this is a good one for

70
00:01:44,409 --> 00:01:45,680
beginners, I think,

71
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,680
because it's still visual.

72
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,790
You know, you can see exactly

73
00:01:48,849 --> 00:01:49,680
what's happening.

74
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,599
So again, this trigger right here,

75
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,780
you can see this is a web hook.

76
00:01:52,859 --> 00:01:54,099
Here is a web hook.

77
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,099
So it's like the same thing.

78
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:56,359
This is a step.

79
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:58,120
This is adding a cold email

80
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,569
response to a CRM in ClickUp

81
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:02,099
and then notifying the team.

82
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:04,280
Again, these are just steps.

83
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:05,319
These are called modules.

84
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,439
And yeah, so make is priced very

85
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:10,300
similarly

86
00:02:10,469 --> 00:02:12,699
where it's per step.

87
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,080
So if we come over to the make

88
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:14,939
pricing here,

89
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:16,090
you can see, but it's a lot

90
00:02:16,129 --> 00:02:16,680
cheaper.

91
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:18,460
You saw that on Zapier,

92
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:21,199
it's 10,000 tasks per month is

93
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:22,860
$193 per month.

94
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:24,639
Meanwhile, if you look at make,

95
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:27,180
the pricing is if you use the core

96
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:27,780
plan,

97
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,020
which I recommend starting with,

98
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:30,000
you don't really need money.

99
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,719
These upgrade features to start,

100
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:32,259
to be honest,

101
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,280
it's $9 a month or if we go,

102
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,719
or sorry, a year.

103
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:38,780
Sorry, it's $10 a month

104
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,849
and then $18 a month for the pro

105
00:02:40,849 --> 00:02:41,400
plan.

106
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:42,590
But again, like that is a lot

107
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:42,960
cheaper

108
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:45,300
than the $193 on Zapier.

109
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:46,400
So that's why it's better.

110
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:47,419
If you see here,

111
00:02:47,469 --> 00:02:48,620
I left a note for you guys here

112
00:02:48,699 --> 00:02:49,930
is makes better for higher volume

113
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:50,599
automation.

114
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,949
So if there's a lot of steps in an

115
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:53,960
automation

116
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:55,939
because you get charged per step,

117
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:57,250
then that's when you'd want to use

118
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:57,520
make.

119
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:59,520
Meanwhile, Zapier sometimes has

120
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,800
those integrations

121
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,039
out of the box that make doesn't.

122
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,240
So it's easier to use.

123
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:04,360
And then you can see here,

124
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:06,259
there's a table showing you

125
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:06,650
what I mean.

126
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:07,599
So like a trigger,

127
00:03:07,669 --> 00:03:10,900
one Zapier doesn't count as a

128
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:11,219
task,

129
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,310
but it counts as an operation on

130
00:03:12,389 --> 00:03:12,719
make.

131
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,960
An action counts as a task,

132
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:15,719
counts as an operation,

133
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,620
and so on and so forth.

134
00:03:16,699 --> 00:03:19,300
So those are the two early guys.

135
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:20,080
And then recently,

136
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:21,240
the new kid on the block

137
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:22,500
is this N8N.

138
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:25,460
And N8N is different as well

139
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,740
in the way they charge you.

140
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:28,000
So they've got a similar format.

141
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:28,300
You know,

142
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:29,159
they've got that background

143
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,349
and then you drag and drop these

144
00:03:30,349 --> 00:03:30,719
modules

145
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,460
and connect them together.

146
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,759
But if we come over to N8N's

147
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:35,449
pricing plan,

148
00:03:35,539 --> 00:03:36,860
the way N8N works

149
00:03:36,939 --> 00:03:39,469
is it's per scenario

150
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,439
or per workflow execution

151
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,189
is what they call it.

152
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,259
So scenario and make

153
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,759
is like all the steps

154
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,310
to do one full automation.

155
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,599
It's the same thing in N8N,

156
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,599
but it's called the workflow

157
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:51,280
execution.

158
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,759
So you get limited

159
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,740
by the number of times

160
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:54,340
you get to run

161
00:03:54,419 --> 00:03:56,159
that full set of steps.

162
00:03:56,699 --> 00:03:58,000
You could run five

163
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,240
of those concurrently.

164
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:00,080
So say you built

165
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,650
five different automations.

166
00:04:01,729 --> 00:04:04,009
Five of those could run at once,

167
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,680
but say you built 20 automations.

168
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:06,550
You could still have

169
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:08,219
the 20 automations on N8N,

170
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:10,819
but they are going to get queued.

171
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,099
So what that means is

172
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,800
the first five are going to go

173
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:14,580
and it's going to wait

174
00:04:14,659 --> 00:04:15,300
and then it's going to run

175
00:04:15,379 --> 00:04:15,699
the next five

176
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:16,560
and the next five

177
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:16,959
and the next five

178
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:18,709
if there's things in the backlog.

179
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,500
So if things are like

180
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:21,279
meant to be instant,

181
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,620
that's where that's not ideal.

182
00:04:22,699 --> 00:04:23,879
And maybe you'd want to upgrade

183
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:25,060
to say the pro client.

184
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:26,740
And then also knowing

185
00:04:26,819 --> 00:04:28,360
how many workflow executions

186
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:29,230
you actually need

187
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:30,259
for the year is important

188
00:04:30,339 --> 00:04:32,060
or month, sorry.

189
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:34,060
So that's where

190
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:35,860
if you go with N8N,

191
00:04:35,939 --> 00:04:37,100
you have some options.

192
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:38,189
You can either do the cloud

193
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:38,519
hosted,

194
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,959
which is directly through them,

195
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,139
just like the other platforms.

196
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,220
You just click and pay

197
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,790
and they host it for you.

198
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:44,550
You don't have to worry about

199
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:44,879
anything.

200
00:04:44,949 --> 00:04:46,399
Alternatively, Lucas

201
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,699
is going to have some instructions

202
00:04:47,779 --> 00:04:48,800
on how you can

203
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:49,939
actually self-host this.

204
00:04:50,019 --> 00:04:51,839
And that lets you run

205
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:54,079
unlimited workflows executions.

206
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,300
It's really not that hard to do,

207
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:55,750
to be honest.

208
00:04:55,939 --> 00:04:57,519
So that's the route

209
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:57,910
I'd recommend

210
00:04:58,139 --> 00:04:59,040
if you're going to use

211
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,589
N8N is to self-host it.

212
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,639
Yeah, so we won't get

213
00:05:01,709 --> 00:05:03,970
into too much detail there.

214
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:05,720
So those are

215
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,439
core automation platforms.

216
00:05:07,509 --> 00:05:08,959
Other things

217
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,899
from a comparison perspective,

218
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:11,660
lets you run

219
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:12,500
JavaScript,

220
00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:14,069
which is actual real code.

221
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,620
So that makes it

222
00:05:15,689 --> 00:05:17,240
a little bit more robust

223
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:18,540
if you're into certain scenarios

224
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:19,839
where the modules

225
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,839
in either of these

226
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,899
aren't cutting it.

227
00:05:21,939 --> 00:05:22,480
I think Zapier

228
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,279
lets you run

229
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:24,079
a little bit as well,

230
00:05:24,149 --> 00:05:25,240
but it is a lot

231
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:26,079
more flexible too.

232
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,560
The other thing

233
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:29,040
is their AI agent support.

234
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,240
So they make it really easy

235
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:31,939
to make these AI agents

236
00:05:32,009 --> 00:05:32,350
with memory

237
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,310
and choosing

238
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:34,959
the database

239
00:05:35,029 --> 00:05:36,860
and the model

240
00:05:36,939 --> 00:05:37,579
that you want to use.

241
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:39,139
So that's the one thing.

242
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,040
They were the first people

243
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:40,430
kind of making

244
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:41,439
these agents down.

245
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:42,680
They all have agents.

246
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:43,459
I would say theirs

247
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:44,139
is still the best,

248
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:44,839
but they all have

249
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,459
that functionality.

250
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:45,990
it's not like

251
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:46,889
you're like missing out

252
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:47,290
on anything.

253
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:48,259
You just have to learn

254
00:05:48,339 --> 00:05:48,649
how to use

255
00:05:48,939 --> 00:05:50,160
the specific platforms

256
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,019
AI agents.

257
00:05:51,089 --> 00:05:52,459
And yeah,

258
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:52,850
that's probably

259
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:53,980
the main thing.

260
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:54,639
So how do you

261
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:55,759
learn these, right?

262
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,620
You want to pick

263
00:05:56,699 --> 00:05:57,459
one of these.

264
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:59,379
I would choose

265
00:05:59,449 --> 00:06:00,279
make or any

266
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:00,680
and to start

267
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:02,800
just because

268
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:05,120
they are more visual.

269
00:06:05,189 --> 00:06:06,399
Zapier runs

270
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:06,790
into some weird

271
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:07,500
limitations.

272
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:08,370
I sometimes call it

273
00:06:08,459 --> 00:06:09,519
like the Zapier attacks

274
00:06:09,589 --> 00:06:10,920
where people come in

275
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,220
like, hey,

276
00:06:11,259 --> 00:06:11,819
I'm using Zapier

277
00:06:11,899 --> 00:06:12,160
for this.

278
00:06:12,209 --> 00:06:12,740
I can't do it.

279
00:06:12,819 --> 00:06:13,579
And then in

280
00:06:13,649 --> 00:06:14,519
make or any

281
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:14,910
and it's like

282
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,120
literally two seconds

283
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:16,959
to fix.

284
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,279
You're much better off,

285
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:18,560
I think,

286
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:19,199
starting with either

287
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:19,610
one of these platforms

288
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:23,360
and the content

289
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:24,139
out there for both

290
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:24,879
of these is very

291
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:25,750
good to learn.

292
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:26,579
So YouTube really

293
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:27,759
has everything you need.

294
00:06:27,829 --> 00:06:29,740
And also the official

295
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:30,129
make Academy

296
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,480
is actually pretty solid

297
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:31,889
to learn initially

298
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:32,810
when you're getting

299
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,199
started.

300
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:34,279
So I've linked

301
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:36,620
the official Academy

302
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,519
here as well as

303
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:37,910
the YouTube playlist

304
00:06:38,259 --> 00:06:38,879
to check out.

305
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:39,579
You don't have to

306
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:40,529
watch all the videos

307
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,040
in either of these.

308
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,720
I would say 20,

309
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:44,279
30 hours

310
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:44,899
until you're

311
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:45,259
comfortable.

312
00:06:45,329 --> 00:06:47,319
And then same

313
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:47,939
with N8N,

314
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:48,329
I've linked

315
00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:49,339
a YouTube video

316
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:49,730
here that's

317
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:50,120
an eight-hour

318
00:06:50,189 --> 00:06:50,529
masterclass

319
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:51,500
as well as

320
00:06:51,579 --> 00:06:52,079
Lucas is going

321
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:52,459
to provide

322
00:06:52,529 --> 00:06:53,800
some resources

323
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:55,100
on how to

324
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:55,680
learn N8N

325
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:56,069
as well.

326
00:06:56,329 --> 00:06:57,980
And yeah,

327
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:58,370
don't just

328
00:06:58,639 --> 00:06:58,949
watch,

329
00:06:59,139 --> 00:06:59,720
build alongside.

330
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,560
I would say

331
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:00,949
that's one of

332
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:01,370
the big problems

333
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:01,949
people do

334
00:07:02,139 --> 00:07:02,399
is like they

335
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:02,790
just watch

336
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:03,290
these videos

337
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:03,970
and they

338
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:04,850
don't actually

339
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:05,879
take the time

340
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:06,269
to build

341
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:06,790
the things

342
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:07,370
and then

343
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:07,980
when they get

344
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:08,279
into it,

345
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:08,519
they're like,

346
00:07:08,579 --> 00:07:08,910
I don't even

347
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:09,300
know what I'm

348
00:07:09,379 --> 00:07:09,560
doing.

349
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:10,579
So make sure

350
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:10,899
you actually

351
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:11,560
take some time

352
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:11,949
and build

353
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:12,519
while you're

354
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:12,879
watching.

355
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:13,879
And then just

356
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,269
I wanted to

357
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:14,750
throw in one

358
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:15,170
other key

359
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:15,680
video.

360
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,000
So in

361
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:17,459
make,

362
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:18,139
N8N,

363
00:07:18,209 --> 00:07:19,500
all these

364
00:07:19,569 --> 00:07:20,079
things,

365
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:20,470
they're going to

366
00:07:20,579 --> 00:07:20,899
sometimes have

367
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:22,439
these out-of-the-box

368
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:23,180
integrations.

369
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,360
So these are

370
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:24,899
modules,

371
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:25,139
right?

372
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:25,720
So this is a

373
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,129
click-out module

374
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:26,889
you can see

375
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,339
here and it

376
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:28,730
lets you create

377
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:29,310
a task.

378
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,519
This is out-of-the-box

379
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,259
already built-in

380
00:07:31,329 --> 00:07:32,060
connected to the

381
00:07:32,139 --> 00:07:32,420
API.

382
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,500
But there's going

383
00:07:33,579 --> 00:07:33,889
to be times

384
00:07:34,189 --> 00:07:34,509
we're going to

385
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:34,930
run into issues

386
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:36,240
where you need

387
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:36,629
to do something

388
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,060
on connecting

389
00:07:38,139 --> 00:07:39,019
some softwares

390
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:39,339
together,

391
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:41,540
but you can't

392
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:42,279
actually do it

393
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:43,100
natively in

394
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:43,879
either of any

395
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:44,620
of these platforms.

396
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:45,000
So you're going

397
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:45,240
to have to

398
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:46,019
manually do an

399
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:46,639
API call.

400
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,279
So this is

401
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:47,660
just a video

402
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,040
on how to

403
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:48,430
connect any

404
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:48,970
API call

405
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:49,740
on make.com

406
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:50,860
but the

407
00:07:50,939 --> 00:07:51,259
principle is

408
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:51,930
the exact same

409
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:52,589
using something

410
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,540
like NNN

411
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:54,959
and as always

412
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:55,360
use chat

413
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:56,399
GPT

414
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:57,699
or quad

415
00:07:57,779 --> 00:07:58,089
to ask

416
00:07:58,230 --> 00:07:58,620
questions.

417
00:07:58,699 --> 00:07:59,009
If you're

418
00:07:59,139 --> 00:07:59,439
into any

419
00:07:59,560 --> 00:07:59,819
issues,

420
00:07:59,899 --> 00:08:00,529
they'll tell

421
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:00,930
you what to

422
00:08:01,009 --> 00:08:01,120
do.

423
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:01,509
The next

424
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:02,040
thing you

425
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:02,319
want to

426
00:08:02,389 --> 00:08:03,069
familiarize

427
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:03,459
yourself

428
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:03,850
with is

429
00:08:04,189 --> 00:08:04,509
project

430
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:04,990
management

431
00:08:05,139 --> 00:08:05,420
tools,

432
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:05,810
not only

433
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:06,329
for yourself

434
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:08,079
but for

435
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:08,470
your clients

436
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:08,990
as well.

437
00:08:09,149 --> 00:08:09,540
Again,

438
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:09,920
for me,

439
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:10,439
like I

440
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:10,779
primarily

441
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:11,100
help

442
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:11,459
businesses

443
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:11,860
with project

444
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:12,500
management

445
00:08:12,579 --> 00:08:12,860
tools.

446
00:08:12,939 --> 00:08:13,579
So I'm

447
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:13,759
building

448
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:14,149
automations

449
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:14,629
on top

450
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:14,879
of these

451
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:15,120
so you

452
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:15,240
need to

453
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:15,600
understand

454
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,240
their API,

455
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:17,519
how they're

456
00:08:17,589 --> 00:08:18,040
structured,

457
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:18,879
where the

458
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:19,339
data goes,

459
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:19,730
all those

460
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:20,019
different

461
00:08:20,089 --> 00:08:20,800
things is

462
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:21,019
very

463
00:08:21,089 --> 00:08:21,420
important.

464
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:22,639
So that's

465
00:08:22,709 --> 00:08:24,060
why you

466
00:08:24,139 --> 00:08:24,449
should really

467
00:08:24,589 --> 00:08:25,180
familiarize

468
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:25,649
yourself with

469
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,000
these.

470
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:26,389
Again,

471
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:26,740
it's the

472
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:27,120
same as

473
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:27,300
the

474
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:27,689
automation

475
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:28,360
platforms.

476
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:28,750
You learn

477
00:08:29,019 --> 00:08:29,240
one,

478
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:29,519
you kind

479
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:29,779
of learn

480
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:30,199
them all.

481
00:08:30,269 --> 00:08:31,750
So don't

482
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:32,149
stress.

483
00:08:32,269 --> 00:08:33,070
And I've

484
00:08:33,158 --> 00:08:33,470
linked also

485
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:34,559
a master

486
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:35,139
class I did

487
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:35,529
on doing

488
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:36,320
project

489
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:36,700
management.

490
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:37,080
This is

491
00:08:37,179 --> 00:08:37,490
more so

492
00:08:37,658 --> 00:08:37,980
like doing

493
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:38,720
project

494
00:08:38,798 --> 00:08:39,059
management

495
00:08:39,139 --> 00:08:39,418
in your

496
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:39,658
own

497
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:40,158
business.

498
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:41,080
But you

499
00:08:41,158 --> 00:08:41,379
could take

500
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:41,600
some of

501
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:41,700
these

502
00:08:41,779 --> 00:08:42,080
principles

503
00:08:42,158 --> 00:08:42,470
and apply

504
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:43,070
them when

505
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:43,320
you're

506
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:43,538
helping

507
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:43,929
businesses

508
00:08:44,129 --> 00:08:44,450
implement

509
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:44,929
this or

510
00:08:45,059 --> 00:08:45,320
automate

511
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:45,710
on top

512
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:46,129
of these

513
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:46,600
tools.

514
00:08:46,669 --> 00:08:47,960
Another one

515
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:48,350
that's very

516
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:48,860
common in the

517
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:49,250
business space

518
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:49,779
is CRMs.

519
00:08:50,059 --> 00:08:50,320
These are

520
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:50,720
client relationship

521
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:51,960
management tools.

522
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:52,350
They manage

523
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:54,120
the data

524
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:54,740
related to

525
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:55,129
your clients

526
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:55,590
for you.

527
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:56,330
So you're

528
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:56,700
making sure

529
00:08:56,769 --> 00:08:57,090
you're following

530
00:08:57,179 --> 00:08:57,919
up and keeping

531
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,309

532
00:08:58,539 --> 00:08:58,850
with all your

533
00:08:59,039 --> 00:08:59,350

00:08:59,559 --> 00:08:59,870
the deals

535
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,299
and your

536
00:09:00,379 --> 00:09:00,659
pipeline,

537
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:01,019
all those

538
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:01,279
things.

539
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:03,259
that's where

540
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:03,600
a lot

541
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:03,860
of

542
00:09:03,929 --> 00:09:04,250
opportunity

543
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:04,779
is

544
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:05,139
available

545
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:05,529
for

546
00:09:06,029 --> 00:09:06,350
automation

547
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:06,700
just

548
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:06,840
to

549
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:07,120
increase

550
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:07,460
sales

551
00:09:07,529 --> 00:09:07,960
velocity.

552
00:09:08,029 --> 00:09:09,570
So familiarize

553
00:09:09,659 --> 00:09:09,970
yourself with

554
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:10,679
these tools.

555
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:11,389
Close is

556
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,139
very popular.

557
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:12,940
HubSpot's more

00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:13,789
There's also

560
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:14,250
Salesforce

561
00:09:14,379 --> 00:09:14,690
they demand

562
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,259
here.

563
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:16,480
High level

564
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:16,820
is very

565
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:17,519
popular if

566
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:17,779
you end up

567
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:18,169

They really

like high

571
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:20,289
level because

572
00:09:20,419 --> 00:09:20,620
it's an

00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,009

features.

577
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:23,399
And then

578
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,019
Adio is

579
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:24,409

582
00:09:25,379 --> 00:09:25,600
They're

583
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:25,990
more like

584
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,120
AI first,

585
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:27,509
automation

586
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:28,440
first,

587
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:29,220
which is a

588
00:09:29,299 --> 00:09:29,610
very cool

589
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:30,840
platform.

590
00:09:30,919 --> 00:09:31,230
so check

591
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:31,740
those guys

592
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,100

593
00:09:32,179 --> 00:09:32,379
well.

594
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:33,399
Ultimately,

595
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:33,789
each one

596
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,139
of these

597
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:34,529
is also

598
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:34,879
going to

599
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,200
have

600
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:35,590
their own

601
00:09:35,789 --> 00:09:36,110
workflow

602
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:36,629
builder.

603
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:37,899
I recommend

604
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:38,799
trying to

605
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:39,059
do it

606
00:09:39,129 --> 00:09:39,460
natively

607
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:39,990
in the

608
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:40,659
tool

609
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:41,049
if

610
00:09:41,309 --> 00:09:41,629
possible

611
00:09:41,769 --> 00:09:42,299
just to

612
00:09:42,379 --> 00:09:42,600
minimize

613
00:09:42,669 --> 00:09:43,919
risk and

614
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:44,309
overhead

615
00:09:44,419 --> 00:09:44,740
and costs

616
00:09:45,259 --> 00:09:45,570
for the

617
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:46,019
client.

618
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:46,419
But

619
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:47,549
sometimes

620
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:48,480
they can't

621
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:48,870
do it so

622
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:49,139
then you're

623
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:49,240
going to

624
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:49,600
have to

625
00:09:49,669 --> 00:09:50,460
use the

626
00:09:50,539 --> 00:09:50,779
automation

627
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:51,169
platforms

628
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:51,649
up here

629
00:09:51,809 --> 00:09:52,139
to connect

630
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:52,679
all these

631
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:53,039
things

632
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:53,399
together.

633
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:53,799
Start

634
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:54,809
simple.

635
00:09:54,929 --> 00:09:56,039
It really

636
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:56,429
depends on

637
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:56,740
what the

638
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:57,220
niche is,

639
00:09:57,299 --> 00:09:58,019
which CRM

640
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:58,259
they're going

641
00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:58,820
to be using.

642
00:09:58,889 --> 00:09:59,779
Ultimately,

643
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:00,169
they're all

644
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:00,620
very much

645
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:01,139
and they're

646
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:01,529
just storing

647
00:10:01,779 --> 00:10:02,100
data about

648
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:02,789
the client

649
00:10:03,009 --> 00:10:03,350
and you

650
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:04,080
want to

651
00:10:04,149 --> 00:10:05,039
enable them

652
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:05,429
to make

653
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,029
more sales

654
00:10:06,299 --> 00:10:06,610
or manage

655
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,149
their projects

656
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:07,690
better with

657
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,200
your automations.

658
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:09,590
And the

659
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:10,039
biggest thing

660
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:10,450
I would say

661
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:11,009
is just

662
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:11,679
adopt a

663
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:12,070
just-in-time

664
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:12,580
learning

665
00:10:12,659 --> 00:10:12,960
mindset.

666
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:13,690
what that

667
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:14,169
means is

668
00:10:14,379 --> 00:10:14,690
instead of

669
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:15,110
sitting for

670
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:15,799
hours and

671
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:16,190
hours and

672
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:16,659
hours and

673
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:17,049
watching

674
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:17,529
YouTube

675
00:10:17,629 --> 00:10:17,950
tutorials

676
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:18,539
and

677
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:19,480
building

678
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:19,840
random

679
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:20,559
automations,

680
00:10:20,629 --> 00:10:21,470
just trust

681
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:21,799
that you're

682
00:10:21,879 --> 00:10:22,080
going to be

683
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:22,379
able to

684
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:22,769
figure this

685
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:23,139
out.

686
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:23,529
Especially

687
00:10:24,139 --> 00:10:24,519
with AI,

688
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:24,909
it's like

689
00:10:25,059 --> 00:10:25,370
your junior

690
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:26,629
intern that's

691
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,029
available that

692
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:27,570
knows absolutely

693
00:10:27,789 --> 00:10:28,419
everything all

694
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:28,809
the time.

695
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:29,289
You can

696
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:29,830
literally message

697
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,000
this person,

698
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:32,039
this AI,

699
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:32,429
and be like,

700
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:33,100
hey, how do I

701
00:10:33,179 --> 00:10:33,490
do this?

702
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,039
And it most

703
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:35,460
likely will have

704
00:10:35,539 --> 00:10:35,919
the answer,

705
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,240
and if it

706
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:36,629
doesn't, it'll

707
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:37,220
point you in the

708
00:10:37,299 --> 00:10:37,840
right direction.

709
00:10:38,629 --> 00:10:38,950
I've seen

710
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:39,549
people in

711
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:40,029
other automation

712
00:10:40,789 --> 00:10:41,299
communities,

713
00:10:41,379 --> 00:10:42,559
they're like,

714
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:42,950
oh, I don't

715
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:43,320
know what to

716
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:44,360
do, I don't

717
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:44,659
have any

718
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:45,379
clients, this,

719
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:45,639
that, and

720
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,120
other thing,

721
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:47,539
and you come

722
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:48,399
to learn that

723
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:48,789
they've been

724
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:49,220
learning automation

725
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,029
for eight

726
00:10:50,379 --> 00:10:51,240
months, and

727
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:51,629
they haven't

728
00:10:51,779 --> 00:10:52,090
talked to a

729
00:10:52,269 --> 00:10:53,059
single client,

730
00:10:53,129 --> 00:10:53,600
prospect,

731
00:10:53,669 --> 00:10:55,139
whatever, and

732
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:55,539
that's because

733
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:56,289
they feel like

734
00:10:56,419 --> 00:10:56,659
they're not

735
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:56,960
ready.

736
00:10:57,039 --> 00:10:57,600
They don't

737
00:10:57,679 --> 00:10:58,100
know everything.

738
00:10:58,179 --> 00:10:58,740
Well, I'm

739
00:10:58,820 --> 00:10:59,279
sorry to say,

740
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,440
but this is a

741
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:00,820
space where

742
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:01,179
you're never

743
00:11:01,259 --> 00:11:01,500
going to know

744
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:01,889
everything, and

745
00:11:02,059 --> 00:11:02,259
you're just

746
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:02,620
going to have

747
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:03,029
to learn as

748
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,039
you go, but

749
00:11:04,379 --> 00:11:04,620
you just need

750
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:05,009
to trust that

751
00:11:05,179 --> 00:11:05,480
you'll figure

752
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:05,870
it out as

753
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:06,340
you go.

754
00:11:06,419 --> 00:11:07,340
So, yeah,

755
00:11:07,419 --> 00:11:08,179
that is the

756
00:11:08,259 --> 00:11:09,179
tool section.

757
00:11:09,259 --> 00:11:09,870
On the next

758
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,179
video, I'm

759
00:11:10,259 --> 00:11:10,559
going to talk

760
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:10,950
through some

761
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:12,299
specific sales

762
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:13,240
tips on how

763
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:13,629
to effectively

764
00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:14,190
sell automation

765
00:11:14,779 --> 00:11:15,539
to clients.
