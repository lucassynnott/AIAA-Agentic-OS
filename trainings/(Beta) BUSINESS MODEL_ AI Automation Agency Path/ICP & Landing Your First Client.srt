1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:00,860
So we're going to talk about

2
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:02,540
finding your ideal client profile,

3
00:00:02,549 --> 00:00:04,519
landing your first AI automation

4
00:00:04,639 --> 00:00:05,799
agency client.

5
00:00:05,809 --> 00:00:09,630
So the best way to identify your

6
00:00:09,919 --> 00:00:12,939
ICP is twofold, in my opinion.

7
00:00:12,949 --> 00:00:14,839
So you want to do businesses with

8
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:16,760
high volumes of deliverables and

9
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:17,600
preferably

10
00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:19,449
service businesses, because they

11
00:00:19,449 --> 00:00:20,260
have more money.

12
00:00:20,269 --> 00:00:22,239
So that this is businesses driving

13
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:23,859
in repetitive tasks.

14
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:26,199
That's time consuming agencies,

15
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:27,129
coaches, and B2B service

16
00:00:27,129 --> 00:00:27,559
providers.

17
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:28,679
So that's who I primarily work

18
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:29,039
with.

19
00:00:29,769 --> 00:00:32,939
Myself, businesses generating 10k

20
00:00:32,939 --> 00:00:35,049
per month revenue plus, like they

21
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:35,469
need to have some

22
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:36,460
money to pay you.

23
00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:38,000
Otherwise this just doesn't work.

24
00:00:38,009 --> 00:00:39,890
They have teams that are drowning

25
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:41,359
in disconnected tools.

26
00:00:41,409 --> 00:00:42,640
That's why agencies are good

27
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,200
because they have so many software

28
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:44,960
tools to actually run

29
00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:45,700
their businesses.

30
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:46,950
And then the founders that are

31
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:48,390
about to make their first hires,

32
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:49,939
but they need management

33
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:50,520
systems.

34
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:51,619
So a lot of the work I also do is

35
00:00:51,619 --> 00:00:53,060
help implement project management

36
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:54,920
systems, CRMs and things

37
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:56,140
like that, because they start

38
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:57,149
needing those tracking on

39
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,659
information is more important as

40
00:00:58,659 --> 00:00:59,159
they grow.

41
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:01,070
And then companies just like

42
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:02,810
losing money to inefficiency,

43
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:04,700
which is probably every company,

44
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:05,620
to be honest.

45
00:01:05,629 --> 00:01:06,769
The other thing to consider is

46
00:01:06,769 --> 00:01:08,219
your background and experience.

47
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:11,250
So as I mentioned previously, I

48
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:13,540
used to work in project

49
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:15,959
management, right?

50
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:16,510
So I was familiar with all the

51
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,209
different project management

52
00:01:17,209 --> 00:01:17,939
softwares because I'd used them

53
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:19,459
extensively in the past.

54
00:01:19,469 --> 00:01:22,260
I'd also at the manager IT service

55
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:24,799
provider helped on several CRM

56
00:01:24,849 --> 00:01:26,680
implementations.

57
00:01:26,689 --> 00:01:27,959
So I was familiar with things like

58
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:29,159
Salesforce and HubSpot and all

59
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:29,709
that stuff.

60
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:31,450
So that's how I ended up working

61
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:33,310
primarily with those tools and the

62
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:34,269
automations.

63
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:36,010
Use your past experience.

64
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:37,620
You might not think you have any,

65
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:39,299
I'm sure you have some kind of

66
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:41,019
insider knowledge, but it just

67
00:01:41,019 --> 00:01:43,280
makes positioning yourself better.

68
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:45,269
I also talked to engineers.

69
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:46,890
I haven't signed on engineer yet,

70
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:48,290
but I talked to them regularly

71
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:49,810
under the pain points because I

72
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:51,319
used to work with them and be one

73
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:51,519
myself.

74
00:01:51,629 --> 00:01:53,840
So all that to say, consider your

75
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:56,230
background when picking your ICP

76
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:57,219
and niche.

77
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:59,390
The best clients have clear pain

78
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:01,409
points that AI automation can

79
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:03,180
solve and can easily show a

80
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:04,150
visible ROI.

81
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:06,629
And doing everything for everyone

82
00:02:06,629 --> 00:02:07,700
just isn't scalable.

83
00:02:07,709 --> 00:02:08,889
So you have to pick something to

84
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:09,919
start and you don't have to,

85
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,050
you're not married to it.

86
00:02:11,169 --> 00:02:12,460
So like, it's okay if you change.

87
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:15,490
So what's next after you pick

88
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:17,479
something, okay, I want to maybe

89
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:18,789
pick two or three things to

90
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:19,389
research.

91
00:02:19,509 --> 00:02:20,849
Now you're going to research these

92
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:21,229
things.

93
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:23,009
You're going to go to chat GPT,

94
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:24,669
use AI here and just start asking

95
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:25,569
questions.

96
00:02:25,669 --> 00:02:27,069
Just keep it really high level,

97
00:02:27,069 --> 00:02:28,379
say what you're going to do and

98
00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:29,479
then ask what are the specific

99
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:30,949
operational challenges they run

100
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,319
into?

101
00:02:31,509 --> 00:02:33,189
What can I help them with use your

102
00:02:33,189 --> 00:02:35,080
findings to develop some potential

103
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:35,919
solutions?

104
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:37,259
And then after we get the next

105
00:02:37,259 --> 00:02:38,830
stage where you're going to learn

106
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:40,659
how to use these automation tools.

107
00:02:40,669 --> 00:02:42,539
Once you learn that, try to build

108
00:02:42,539 --> 00:02:44,259
a minimal viable product.

109
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:45,990
So a basic thing maybe does one of

110
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:47,969
the several things that you found

111
00:02:47,969 --> 00:02:49,539
talking to AI, just so you can

112
00:02:49,539 --> 00:02:51,060
have something to show that click,

113
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,020
look at the magic.

114
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:53,460
It might not be exactly specific

115
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:54,969
to that business that you talk to,

116
00:02:54,979 --> 00:02:56,400
but at least they see that like,

117
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,710
Hey, this guy can actually do

118
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:58,580
something.

119
00:02:59,169 --> 00:03:00,580
And then as a beginner, there's

120
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,699
this thing called market

121
00:03:01,699 --> 00:03:02,960
sophistication level.

122
00:03:02,969 --> 00:03:05,189
You want to choose businesses that

123
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,599
have limited technical knowledge,

124
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:08,280
right?

125
00:03:08,289 --> 00:03:10,389
So think like home services, like

126
00:03:10,389 --> 00:03:12,740
these guys don't understand tech.

127
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:13,800
And you want to think of

128
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,139
businesses that have a lot of

129
00:03:15,139 --> 00:03:16,569
operational efficiencies.

130
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:17,469
Like they're still using

131
00:03:17,469 --> 00:03:18,560
spreadsheets for everything.

132
00:03:18,569 --> 00:03:19,879
Processes just like haven't been

133
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:20,479
optimized.

134
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:21,639
A lot of marketing agencies now

135
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:22,699
are getting a little bit more

136
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,500
sophisticated.

137
00:03:23,509 --> 00:03:24,620
So they're moving up that train a

138
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:25,159
little bit.

139
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:27,449
But that isn't to say that there's

140
00:03:27,449 --> 00:03:28,949
still a lot of marketing agencies

141
00:03:29,069 --> 00:03:30,379
and coaches and consultants that

142
00:03:30,379 --> 00:03:31,400
are not sophisticated.

143
00:03:31,409 --> 00:03:32,789
And then you also want people who

144
00:03:32,789 --> 00:03:34,169
are open to technology, but I'm

145
00:03:34,169 --> 00:03:35,219
sure where to start.

146
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,620
So the thing with these limited

147
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,210
technical knowledge, people like

148
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:39,759
home service businesses, you're

149
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:40,889
going to have to educate them on

150
00:03:40,889 --> 00:03:42,500
like why they want this and how

151
00:03:42,509 --> 00:03:43,719
it's going to work.

152
00:03:43,729 --> 00:03:45,030
And like the media is doing a

153
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:46,590
pretty good job of talking about

154
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:48,250
the benefits of AI, but sometimes

155
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,550
you got to sell them on the AI

156
00:03:49,819 --> 00:03:51,039
first and then sell them on your

157
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:53,259
solution as well, as opposed to

158
00:03:53,259 --> 00:03:54,789
with some marketing agencies, like

159
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:55,870
they already know the benefits.

160
00:03:55,889 --> 00:03:57,229
They just don't know how to get it

161
00:03:57,229 --> 00:03:57,610
done.

162
00:03:57,629 --> 00:03:58,889
So it makes it a little bit

163
00:03:58,889 --> 00:03:59,479
easier.

164
00:04:01,069 --> 00:04:02,479
So once you have all that, then

165
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:03,860
you want to develop your first

166
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:04,400
offer.

167
00:04:04,409 --> 00:04:06,129
So identify those common pain

168
00:04:06,229 --> 00:04:08,539
points, create those solutions.

169
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:10,270
Daniel's got really good offers

170
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:12,110
training, follow that all those

171
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:13,349
principles apply.

172
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:14,819
One of the things you want to

173
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:16,540
prepare is some demo assets.

174
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:18,389
So as I mentioned, build a sample

175
00:04:18,389 --> 00:04:20,120
automation, showcasing some

176
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,879
abilities of what your solution

177
00:04:21,939 --> 00:04:22,240
is.

178
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:25,079
And then don't price it too crazy,

179
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,779
get an understanding.

180
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:28,490
Typically, you don't reveal price

181
00:04:28,509 --> 00:04:29,810
before you understand their

182
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:31,750
business, because a $3,000

183
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:32,990
solution for one business can

184
00:04:33,129 --> 00:04:35,000
actually be a $10,000 solution for

185
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,500
other businesses that provides the

186
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:36,980
value.

187
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:38,519
But you don't know that until you

188
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:39,759
talk to them, right?

189
00:04:39,769 --> 00:04:41,180
So you can sell the same thing for

190
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,120
3K and 10K.

191
00:04:42,129 --> 00:04:43,399
It doesn't really matter.

192
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:45,129
All the numbers are made up in the

193
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:45,629
day.

194
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:47,629
And your existing goal isn't to

195
00:04:47,629 --> 00:04:49,019
maximize revenue.

196
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:50,959
It's building credibility through

197
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:52,800
successful implementations.

198
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:54,569
So how do you get that first

199
00:04:54,569 --> 00:04:55,329
client now?

200
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:57,920
So Daniel talks a lot about cold

201
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,709
email, ads, content, all those

202
00:05:00,709 --> 00:05:02,350
different things.

203
00:05:02,569 --> 00:05:04,740
For me personally, these were the

204
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,750
kind of the couple that I used off

205
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:07,680
the start.

206
00:05:07,689 --> 00:05:09,670
So one was a warm network.

207
00:05:09,689 --> 00:05:11,310
You might say, I don't have any

208
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:12,189
experience.

209
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:13,060
I've never run a business.

210
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:14,079
I've never worked in the

211
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:14,860
workforce.

212
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:17,889
To that, I say, you have contacts

213
00:05:17,889 --> 00:05:20,569
in your phone that know people.

214
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:21,720
And guess what?

215
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:23,420
You're not actually going to be

216
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:24,819
pitching your contacts.

217
00:05:24,829 --> 00:05:26,300
You're going to ask them if they

218
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,850
know of anybody who could benefit

219
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:28,660
from what you do.

220
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:29,759
So there's a couple ways to do

221
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:30,139
this.

222
00:05:30,139 --> 00:05:31,000
I have the steps here.

223
00:05:31,029 --> 00:05:32,569
If you click down this and review

224
00:05:32,569 --> 00:05:34,050
it, it'll give you all the steps

225
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:35,680
on how to do warm outreach.

226
00:05:35,689 --> 00:05:37,670
There's also this video here from

227
00:05:37,779 --> 00:05:39,500
Gary V on the fastest way to get

228
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,379
your first clients, which is just

229
00:05:41,769 --> 00:05:43,139
like the video version of this.

230
00:05:43,149 --> 00:05:44,850
And you could, I feel like this

231
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:46,319
would convert better.

232
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:47,639
I actually didn't do this, but I

233
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:48,970
think this would actually convert

234
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:49,449
better.

235
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:51,360
So the second strategy I would say

236
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,180
to get your first client is using

237
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:55,180
a platform called Upwork, which is

238
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:56,720
a freelancing platform.

239
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:58,449
People are posting jobs on there

240
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:00,339
all the time, how they need help

241
00:06:00,339 --> 00:06:01,699
with AI automation.

242
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:03,920
And after you've learned a little

243
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,269
bit, you can just go on there and

244
00:06:05,269 --> 00:06:06,120
apply to those.

245
00:06:06,129 --> 00:06:08,110
This is how I got a client early

246
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,230
on as well was through Upwork,

247
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,329
which led to a referral and so on

248
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:13,519
and so forth.

249
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:14,829
So there are some good people on

250
00:06:14,829 --> 00:06:15,600
there for sure.

251
00:06:15,649 --> 00:06:16,990
You just won't make a ton of money

252
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:18,439
to start, but that's not the focus

253
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:19,000
right now.

254
00:06:19,089 --> 00:06:20,790
So the first thing you want to do

255
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:22,439
is optimize your profile.

256
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:23,990
So just do a quick Google search.

257
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:25,529
Make sure that you're describing

258
00:06:25,529 --> 00:06:27,279
your previous accomplishments, all

259
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:28,560
the things you've done in the

260
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,189
past, how you've driven revenue or

261
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:31,790
save time in businesses, whatever

262
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,120
you've done in the past.

263
00:06:33,129 --> 00:06:34,439
Make sure that's highlighted.

264
00:06:34,449 --> 00:06:36,639
Put up some case studies or demo

265
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,689
projects that you've done.

266
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:40,509
If you haven't done actual work,

267
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:42,290
put some demo projects up, those

268
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:43,939
ones you built earlier, those

269
00:06:43,939 --> 00:06:45,699
sales assets, put those up, talk

270
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,389
about the impact they do in your

271
00:06:47,389 --> 00:06:49,029
portfolio, do the Make Academy

272
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:49,959
course.

273
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:51,339
And then you can put some badges

274
00:06:51,339 --> 00:06:52,819
up there to show that, you know,

275
00:06:52,819 --> 00:06:54,430
you're certified automation, all

276
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:55,660
those different things.

277
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:57,529
It'll just increase the likelihood

278
00:06:57,529 --> 00:06:58,870
that people actually view your

279
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:00,579
profile and hire you for a job.

280
00:07:00,589 --> 00:07:03,180
So these clients on Upwork are

281
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,779
problem aware.

282
00:07:04,779 --> 00:07:05,600
So what does that mean?

283
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:07,170
So there's five stages of

284
00:07:07,209 --> 00:07:08,959
awareness of a prospect.

285
00:07:09,069 --> 00:07:11,060
First of all, they can be unaware,

286
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,879
which is they consciously don't

287
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:14,740
realize they have a problem they

288
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:15,879
need solving.

289
00:07:15,889 --> 00:07:18,680
They can be problem aware.

290
00:07:18,689 --> 00:07:20,410
The prospect feels a pain and is

291
00:07:20,509 --> 00:07:22,029
aware they have some kind of

292
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:22,860
problem.

293
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:24,860
They could be solution aware.

294
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:26,529
So the prospect is aware that

295
00:07:26,569 --> 00:07:28,209
there are solutions to their

296
00:07:28,209 --> 00:07:29,600
problem available.

297
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:31,589
And then there's the prospect is

298
00:07:31,699 --> 00:07:33,439
product aware, which is they're

299
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,810
aware that your product service is

300
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,079
one of the available solutions.

301
00:07:38,089 --> 00:07:39,259
And then the most aware, they

302
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:40,529
think your product or service is

303
00:07:40,529 --> 00:07:41,439
the right solution.

304
00:07:41,529 --> 00:07:43,069
So I would argue, like, maybe

305
00:07:43,069 --> 00:07:44,519
based on this diagram here,

306
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:46,329
they're more like product aware.

307
00:07:46,569 --> 00:07:48,709
Like they know that a make

308
00:07:48,709 --> 00:07:51,720
automation or any automation will

309
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,899
solve their problem.

310
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:56,019
So ultimately, all you have to do

311
00:07:56,019 --> 00:07:58,149
is convince them that, like, you

312
00:07:58,259 --> 00:07:59,579
are the solution.

313
00:07:59,589 --> 00:08:01,420
You are the guy to do that for

314
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:03,399
them, as opposed to if you work

315
00:08:03,699 --> 00:08:05,730
with cold traffic, you're going to

316
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:07,370
have to move them through these

317
00:08:07,379 --> 00:08:09,040
stages through sales calls and

318
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,899
providing information and things

319
00:08:10,899 --> 00:08:11,720
like that.

320
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:13,220
So that's why it's a lot easier to

321
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,550
move someone up one step, as

322
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:15,970
opposed to like all five of these

323
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:17,420
steps when you're first starting

324
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:18,100
out.

325
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:21,129
Another pro tip for using Upwork,

326
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,180
most people are just copy and

327
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:25,339
pasting chat GPT proposals on

328
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:26,300
there.

329
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:28,029
And people hate that they feel

330
00:08:28,129 --> 00:08:30,040
like you don't care about them.

331
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:32,269
The best way to win deals is to

332
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,668
send a loom videos of yourself

333
00:08:34,668 --> 00:08:37,379
talking through the solution.

334
00:08:37,389 --> 00:08:38,840
So just basically pull up a

335
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,710
automation you've built and just

336
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:42,580
say, here's how I built this.

337
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:43,279
Here's what it does.

338
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:44,429
Here's the results it will

339
00:08:44,429 --> 00:08:45,059
generate.

340
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:47,820
Or if they have something, if the

341
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,309
job is for something unrelated,

342
00:08:49,419 --> 00:08:50,399
but you think you can solve it,

343
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:51,269
you just never built it.

344
00:08:51,309 --> 00:08:52,850
You can go on there and just talk

345
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:54,330
to the process of how you do it,

346
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,159
maybe like partially build it.

347
00:08:56,169 --> 00:08:57,539
People really like that, too.

348
00:08:57,549 --> 00:08:59,269
And as you're going through this,

349
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:00,870
focus on feedback, focus on

350
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:02,259
learning, getting early

351
00:09:02,259 --> 00:09:04,139
testimonials, case studies.

352
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:07,389
So, yeah, that's pretty much how

353
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:08,519
Upwork works.

354
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:09,519
I think it's a great place to

355
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:10,730
start when you're first starting

356
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:11,070
out.

357
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:13,940
Another option that I also used is

358
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:16,080
a free value exchange for

359
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,350
strangers.

360
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:20,240
So, I don't recommend like just

361
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,649
giving this to anybody.

362
00:09:22,669 --> 00:09:24,000
You can create an absolute

363
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,659
disaster.

364
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,950
You want to qualify people and

365
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:29,529
preface the free stuff with, hey,

366
00:09:29,529 --> 00:09:30,659
I want to get paid for this one

367
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:31,039
day.

368
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:32,799
Not everybody's going to convert

369
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:33,960
and pay, which is fine, but I

370
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,220
think I just wanted to make sure I

371
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,289
added that note here.

372
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:37,669
Because if you just go and just

373
00:09:37,669 --> 00:09:39,049
give free shit forever, like

374
00:09:39,049 --> 00:09:40,549
people are going to take advantage

375
00:09:40,659 --> 00:09:41,179
of you.

376
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:42,039
Unfortunately, there are those

377
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:42,860
people that exist.

378
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:44,320
So, yeah.

379
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:48,009
Basically, the best way to find

380
00:09:48,009 --> 00:09:51,159
these people is either in your

381
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:54,240
circle or in communities.

382
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:55,789
So, I've used this approach in

383
00:09:55,789 --> 00:09:57,480
communities, including client

384
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,799
ascension, where initially we

385
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:02,700
would start an engagement where we

386
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,519
did a free automation.

387
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:06,580
They were posting about it in one

388
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:07,820
of the channels and I saw the

389
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:08,679
opportunity.

390
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:09,820
I was like, hey, man, like I can

391
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:10,639
help you with that.

392
00:10:10,649 --> 00:10:12,120
They did a free automation and the

393
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,580
next thing you know, you get paid

394
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,090
to do it, which is awesome because

395
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:16,350
they know I can trust you now.

396
00:10:16,629 --> 00:10:19,340
So, that is the best way to do it.

397
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:20,700
Show them the impact and then say,

398
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:21,919
hey, we can work together long

399
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:22,289
term.

400
00:10:22,299 --> 00:10:23,710
I'm sure there's other stuff in

401
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:25,460
your business, so on and so forth.

402
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:27,440
And then same with the cold

403
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,440
outreach.

404
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:30,559
Christian talks about it in client

405
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:31,470
ascension.

406
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:32,909
When you're first starting out

407
00:10:32,909 --> 00:10:34,450
with your cold email agency, you

408
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:35,990
could send an email and just say,

409
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:37,190
hey, you know, I'm just starting

410
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:38,080
out.

411
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:39,360
But I'd love to.

412
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,179
I'll spend all the money.

413
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:41,039
Like, you don't have to do

414
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:41,580
anything.

415
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:43,139
Just let me, like, run outreach

416
00:10:43,139 --> 00:10:43,580
for you.

417
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:45,250
And if you get some stuff, cool.

418
00:10:45,289 --> 00:10:46,690
You can even just pay me per call

419
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:47,879
if we can even do that.

420
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:49,059
I'll still pay for all the tech.

421
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:50,610
So, you could do it with cold

422
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:51,059
email.

423
00:10:51,169 --> 00:10:53,070
So, combining both cold email and

424
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:54,779
the free outreach and then just

425
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,779
convert those into case studies,

426
00:10:56,779 --> 00:10:58,909
testimonials, or upsell them into

427
00:10:58,909 --> 00:11:00,539
a retainer or other projects.

428
00:11:00,549 --> 00:11:02,269
So, those are the three main ones

429
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,899
I used in the beginning to get my

430
00:11:04,029 --> 00:11:05,690
first few clients and get my first

431
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:06,879
few case studies.

432
00:11:06,889 --> 00:11:08,610
In the next one, we're going to

433
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:11,039
talk about the tools, technology.

434
00:11:11,049 --> 00:11:12,610
We're not going to go too deep on

435
00:11:12,649 --> 00:11:14,399
this, but just really the basics

436
00:11:14,529 --> 00:11:15,899
of what you need to know.
