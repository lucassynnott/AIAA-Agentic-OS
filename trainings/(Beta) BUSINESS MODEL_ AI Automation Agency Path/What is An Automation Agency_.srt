1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:00,810
All right, guys, so I'm going to

2
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:02,000
teach you what an automation

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:02,819
agency is.

4
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:04,429
My name is Amir, and I've been

5
00:00:04,429 --> 00:00:06,360
running one for about a year now.

6
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:07,719
Prior to that, I used to run my

7
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:09,400
own project management consulting

8
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:09,900
business

9
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:11,650
and also worked at a managed IT

10
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:12,720
service provider

11
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:14,820
where I sold over $2 million in IT

12
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:15,759
solutions.

13
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:17,280
So I'm very familiar with the

14
00:00:17,289 --> 00:00:18,609
issues and bottlenecks

15
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:19,750
that a bunch of small businesses

16
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:20,059
have.

17
00:00:20,129 --> 00:00:21,750
I've worked with over 25 of them

18
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:22,760
now at this point.

19
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:25,079
Basically, this business model is

20
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:27,250
helping small businesses with AI

21
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:28,399
automation

22
00:00:28,489 --> 00:00:30,489
because really, there's just so

23
00:00:30,489 --> 00:00:32,350
many software tools out there

24
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:32,759
today,

25
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:35,009
and our job is to come in and help

26
00:00:35,009 --> 00:00:37,119
them connect them together

27
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:38,619
and help drive efficiency and

28
00:00:38,619 --> 00:00:40,259
scalability in the business.

29
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:42,350
Everyone's calling it something

30
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:43,280
different.

31
00:00:43,369 --> 00:00:44,799
You've got this AI growth agency,

32
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:46,039
automation consulting,

33
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:48,020
operations partner, automation

34
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:49,229
infrastructure.

35
00:00:49,329 --> 00:00:51,020
It's all the same thing.

36
00:00:51,109 --> 00:00:52,490
It's an AI automation agency, so

37
00:00:52,509 --> 00:00:53,880
don't worry if you're not late to

38
00:00:53,899 --> 00:00:54,359
the party

39
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:55,100
or anything like that.

40
00:00:55,189 --> 00:00:56,320
People are doing the same thing.

41
00:00:56,409 --> 00:00:57,619
They're just repackaging it to

42
00:00:57,619 --> 00:00:58,219
keep it fresh

43
00:00:58,310 --> 00:00:59,689
because this business model has

44
00:00:59,689 --> 00:01:01,350
been around for a couple of years

45
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:01,700
now,

46
00:01:01,789 --> 00:01:03,359
so people are just trying to make

47
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:04,019
it fresh.

48
00:01:04,109 --> 00:01:05,319
But ultimately, it's the same

49
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:05,739
thing.

50
00:01:05,829 --> 00:01:08,129
So what does a good automation

51
00:01:08,129 --> 00:01:10,019
agency actually do?

52
00:01:10,109 --> 00:01:11,560
So the first thing a good

53
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,659
automation agency does is build

54
00:01:13,659 --> 00:01:14,349
trust.

55
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:16,590
So what I mean by build trust is

56
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:17,890
you really want to work with the

57
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:18,599
business owners

58
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:19,959
you're talking to to understand

59
00:01:19,959 --> 00:01:21,319
what their goals and pain points

60
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:23,620
are before pitching solutions.

61
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:25,250
Sometimes you'll know what they

62
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:26,810
are if you've got a productized

63
00:01:26,819 --> 00:01:27,200
offer

64
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:28,010
and you can just go out there and

65
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:29,239
be like, hey, I helped a similar

66
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:29,659
company.

67
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:31,659
But initially, you still need to

68
00:01:31,659 --> 00:01:33,319
get the root cause of what the

69
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:34,599
main problem is in the business.

70
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,620
We'll talk a little bit later

71
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:36,819
about the theory of constraints

72
00:01:36,819 --> 00:01:38,049
and bottlenecks and things like

73
00:01:38,049 --> 00:01:38,340
that.

74
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:40,540
But essentially, you want to make

75
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,510
sure that you understand the

76
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:44,189
business owner themselves and

77
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:45,319
their business.

78
00:01:45,379 --> 00:01:47,180
A bad agency, what they do is they

79
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:47,840
come in.

80
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:48,790
They've got all these NNN

81
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:50,170
templates, which is an automation

82
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:50,730
platform.

83
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:51,819
We'll talk a little bit later.

84
00:01:51,909 --> 00:01:53,230
And they just try to like shove it

85
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:54,379
down business owners.

86
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:55,109
So it's like, you need this

87
00:01:55,109 --> 00:01:55,579
automation.

88
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:56,260
You need AI.

89
00:01:56,349 --> 00:01:56,689
You need this.

90
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:57,120
You need that.

91
00:01:57,849 --> 00:01:59,409
And like, there's no ROI and like

92
00:01:59,409 --> 00:02:01,170
nobody's going to buy anything.

93
00:02:01,269 --> 00:02:02,680
It just doesn't work that way.

94
00:02:02,769 --> 00:02:04,269
Unfortunately, you really need to

95
00:02:04,269 --> 00:02:05,799
understand the business owner in

96
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:06,659
the specific stages

97
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:07,459
they're at and the problems that

98
00:02:07,459 --> 00:02:08,240
they're actually having.

99
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:09,520
So how do you do that?

100
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:10,500
How do you actually understand

101
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:10,819
that?

102
00:02:10,909 --> 00:02:12,110
Well, you need to audit their

103
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:12,659
systems.

104
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,400
So examine their current tools,

105
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,199
workflows, and bottlenecks.

106
00:02:16,289 --> 00:02:17,969
That's done through discovery

107
00:02:17,969 --> 00:02:19,990
calls, asking them questions, pain

108
00:02:20,139 --> 00:02:20,689
points.

109
00:02:20,969 --> 00:02:21,919
What issues are you actually

110
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:22,580
running into?

111
00:02:22,669 --> 00:02:24,000
That's done through working

112
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,800
through their process with them,

113
00:02:25,969 --> 00:02:27,599
having them walk you through

114
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,669
step-by-step what are you doing,

115
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:31,360
having them screen share and show

116
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,599
you how they actually do their

117
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:33,259
day-to-day.

118
00:02:33,349 --> 00:02:34,430
All those different things are

119
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:34,879
important.

120
00:02:34,969 --> 00:02:36,349
So you can design a solution that

121
00:02:36,349 --> 00:02:37,400
solves a real problem

122
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:38,699
because that's what business is,

123
00:02:38,699 --> 00:02:39,500
is solving problems,

124
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:41,129
as opposed to just having some

125
00:02:41,129 --> 00:02:42,300
fancy technology,

126
00:02:42,389 --> 00:02:43,729
which leads to the next point,

127
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:45,520
which is fixing problems, right?

128
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:46,590
Once you understand what the

129
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:47,099
problem is,

130
00:02:47,189 --> 00:02:48,569
you want to see if you can figure

131
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:50,240
out a way to use AI and automation

132
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:51,560
to actually address these

133
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,020
operational challenges.

134
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:55,030
And I'll give you a good framework

135
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:56,259
to think in to understand

136
00:02:56,349 --> 00:02:57,340
which automations are the best

137
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:57,979
ones to put in.

138
00:02:58,069 --> 00:03:00,800
From there, unfortunately, you're

139
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,379
not perfect the first time.

140
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:03,360
At least most people are.

141
00:03:03,469 --> 00:03:04,539
Sometimes you get lucky and it

142
00:03:04,539 --> 00:03:05,020
works out,

143
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:06,419
but you have to optimize these

144
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:07,240
automations.

145
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:08,650
You'll run them in the live

146
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:10,419
environment for a little while,

147
00:03:10,509 --> 00:03:11,610
and maybe they run into some

148
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:12,939
issues or something changes in the

149
00:03:12,939 --> 00:03:13,400
process.

150
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:15,120
So you want to continually monitor

151
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,110
and make sure that what you

152
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:17,069
promise is actually being

153
00:03:17,069 --> 00:03:17,580
delivered.

154
00:03:17,669 --> 00:03:19,490
And the best way to do this is if

155
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:21,370
you retain the person that you

156
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,219
signed on for one project

157
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:25,090
and become their trusted partner

158
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:26,539
as new challenges emerge,

159
00:03:26,629 --> 00:03:27,719
because as the business grows,

160
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:29,169
they run into different next

161
00:03:29,169 --> 00:03:29,560
issues.

162
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:30,370
And then you just kind of

163
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:31,750
continuously do this over and over

164
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:32,939
again and repeat the cycle.

165
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:36,430
So why does this model work?

166
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:37,599
I covered some of it already,

167
00:03:37,689 --> 00:03:39,300
but ultimately businesses have a

168
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,159
problem that you can solve through

169
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:42,400
AI and automation.

170
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:44,159
So that's manual tasks that are

171
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,189
consuming valuable time that just

172
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:47,300
like suck to do.

173
00:03:47,389 --> 00:03:49,330
They've got critical information

174
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:51,340
that falls through the cracks.

175
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:53,879
So think project updates, things

176
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:55,830
in the CRM, not sending out

177
00:03:56,129 --> 00:03:57,560
proposals fast enough,

178
00:03:57,689 --> 00:03:59,229
all these different things that

179
00:03:59,229 --> 00:04:00,240
people get busy.

180
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:01,909
They forget to do going into that

181
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:03,780
as like deadlines getting missed.

182
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:05,610
Nobody's reminding people on their

183
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:06,830
team, Hey, you need to get this

184
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:07,139
done.

185
00:04:07,229 --> 00:04:08,189
And then they forget to do it and

186
00:04:08,189 --> 00:04:08,879
all this stuff.

187
00:04:08,969 --> 00:04:10,580
So you can use automation to help

188
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:12,379
with that communication aspect.

189
00:04:12,469 --> 00:04:14,250
And then, yeah, their client

190
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,089
satisfaction because of this.

191
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:17,009
So you got to look at what is the

192
00:04:17,009 --> 00:04:17,899
next stage after this?

193
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:18,879
So these things happen.

194
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:19,709
What happens then?

195
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:21,540
Well, the clients are unhappy.

196
00:04:21,629 --> 00:04:23,180
Their team starts to burn out.

197
00:04:23,269 --> 00:04:24,649
They started turning clients.

198
00:04:25,009 --> 00:04:26,610
So those are all the problems that

199
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:27,879
you solve or prevent.

200
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:30,720
So the solution is they're freed

201
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,350
up to do other things because

202
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:32,540
you've

203
00:04:32,629 --> 00:04:33,339
automated that task.

204
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:34,420
So they don't have to do it.

205
00:04:34,509 --> 00:04:35,399
The computer is doing it.

206
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:37,240
You have complete visibility

207
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,660
across your system.

208
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:39,730
So you can think of this from like

209
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:40,699
a reporting perspective.

210
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:42,629
If you aggregate their data for

211
00:04:42,629 --> 00:04:44,720
them, they can just see through

212
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:44,939
one

213
00:04:45,029 --> 00:04:46,480
pane of glass, what's going on.

214
00:04:46,569 --> 00:04:48,800
It increases consistency because

215
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,600
computers don't sleep.

216
00:04:50,689 --> 00:04:52,019
If you automate a client's

217
00:04:52,019 --> 00:04:53,819
onboarding process for their

218
00:04:53,819 --> 00:04:54,889
marketing agency,

219
00:04:55,579 --> 00:04:56,629
it'll happen the same way every

220
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:58,300
single time and the same speed

221
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:58,699
every

222
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:00,060
single time, which means they're

223
00:05:00,069 --> 00:05:01,339
going to have clients that are so

224
00:05:01,339 --> 00:05:01,639
happy

225
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:02,970
because, wow, this person really

226
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:03,360
cares.

227
00:05:03,449 --> 00:05:04,529
They onboard me so fast and all

228
00:05:04,529 --> 00:05:05,680
those different things.

229
00:05:05,769 --> 00:05:07,220
And then they'll be able to

230
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:09,250
sustainably grow because they can

231
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:09,920
rely on the

232
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:10,939
systems you built for them.

233
00:05:11,029 --> 00:05:12,839
And then why does anybody want to

234
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:14,160
hire you to do this?

235
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,050
Like I'm sure you've seen it

236
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:17,949
online where it's, you can just

237
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,319
ask ChatGPG to do

238
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:20,730
something and it'll code up an app

239
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:21,540
or this or that.

240
00:05:21,629 --> 00:05:23,009
People still don't want to do

241
00:05:23,029 --> 00:05:23,509
that.

242
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:25,519
At the end of the day, they watch

243
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:26,459
your video.

244
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:27,490
They don't feel comfortable doing

245
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:27,689
it.

246
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:28,620
They're going to hire you to do

247
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:28,860
it.

248
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:32,319
So that leads me to the next

249
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:34,189
point, which is the real focus is

250
00:05:34,189 --> 00:05:34,660
problems.

251
00:05:34,769 --> 00:05:35,779
It's not technology.

252
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,790
Nobody gives a shit about your AI

253
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:38,420
agent.

254
00:05:38,509 --> 00:05:39,699
What they care about is getting

255
00:05:39,699 --> 00:05:40,819
their problems solved in an

256
00:05:40,819 --> 00:05:41,610
effective way.

257
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:44,120
So what does that mean in

258
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,000
practice?

259
00:05:45,089 --> 00:05:46,740
Types of problems you want to

260
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,790
solve for clients are getting new

261
00:05:48,939 --> 00:05:49,980
revenue, right?

262
00:05:50,069 --> 00:05:51,350
How can your system that you

263
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,139
implement get them new revenue?

264
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:55,180
Example of this would be cold

265
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:57,199
email personalization.

266
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,819
So maybe you build some kind of AI

267
00:05:58,819 --> 00:06:00,939
agent that scrapes the web about

268
00:06:00,939 --> 00:06:01,680
their ideal client

269
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:03,870
and personalizes a first line in

270
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:04,629
an email.

271
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:06,269
That's a way that you could help

272
00:06:06,269 --> 00:06:07,930
them generate new revenue.

273
00:06:08,029 --> 00:06:10,180
Another is time savings, right?

274
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:12,509
Maybe the founder has to do all

275
00:06:12,509 --> 00:06:14,069
this manual work to create

276
00:06:14,069 --> 00:06:15,230
proposals and invoices

277
00:06:15,569 --> 00:06:17,160
and all this stuff that's just

278
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,769
draining time for him and his

279
00:06:18,769 --> 00:06:19,120
team.

280
00:06:19,209 --> 00:06:20,899
And you could eliminate their

281
00:06:20,899 --> 00:06:22,910
repetitive tasks so that they can

282
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:23,540
save time

283
00:06:23,629 --> 00:06:25,420
and ultimately save money.

284
00:06:25,509 --> 00:06:27,100
And they could even redistribute

285
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,519
that time that they save into

286
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:29,519
things that make money,

287
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:31,300
which is new revenue, right?

288
00:06:31,389 --> 00:06:33,060
Another big one that people pay

289
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,149
for is clarity.

290
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:36,110
So most businesses are an absolute

291
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:36,620
mess.

292
00:06:37,589 --> 00:06:39,259
People start them and then they

293
00:06:39,259 --> 00:06:41,009
don't keep up with keeping them

294
00:06:41,009 --> 00:06:42,699
clean and systematized.

295
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:43,860
Most people don't think in

296
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,470
systems, but they are really good

297
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:46,490
sales and marketers.

298
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:48,000
So they've grown their business,

299
00:06:48,009 --> 00:06:49,230
but now they don't know what the

300
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:50,079
hell is going on.

301
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:52,839
And cracks usually start to show

302
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:56,379
at the 10, 15K plus a month mark.

303
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:57,990
If they got a few team members and

304
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,300
things like that, if they don't

305
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,550
have visibility into what's going

306
00:07:00,699 --> 00:07:00,899
on,

307
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:02,310
this is where you can help them by

308
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:03,680
building systems that support

309
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,120
that.

310
00:07:04,209 --> 00:07:05,350
So that's one of the main things I

311
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:07,589
do primarily is help founders

312
00:07:07,589 --> 00:07:09,899
scale these bottom two clarity and

313
00:07:09,899 --> 00:07:10,560
scalability,

314
00:07:10,649 --> 00:07:11,759
where I bring in project

315
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,970
management systems, CRMs, and then

316
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:15,339
automate things between them

317
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:16,379
or build dashboards and things

318
00:07:16,379 --> 00:07:16,839
like that.

319
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:20,449
One of the big challenges in this

320
00:07:20,459 --> 00:07:22,980
business model, unlike other

321
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,009
business models,

322
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,899
is it's constantly evolving,

323
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:27,810
right?

324
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:30,860
So every single day, there's a new

325
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:33,120
thing coming out on AI.

326
00:07:33,209 --> 00:07:34,759
It's really hard to keep up.

327
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:36,769
And that's why some people don't

328
00:07:36,769 --> 00:07:39,120
like this business model, right?

329
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:40,250
Copywriting has been the same for

330
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:41,319
years and years and years.

331
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:43,420
The fundamentals of copywriting

332
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:44,819
have been the same.

333
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:45,870
And now people are even using AI

334
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:46,839
to do their copywriting.

335
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:48,500
If you don't want to spend a lot

336
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,519
of time continuously learning,

337
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:51,750
you're not a genuinely curious

338
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,680
person, this business model might

339
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,480
not be for you.

340
00:07:54,569 --> 00:07:56,800
Because this one, compared to all

341
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,160
the other ones in this program,

342
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:00,329
is going to require the most

343
00:08:00,329 --> 00:08:01,829
amount of continuous improvement

344
00:08:01,829 --> 00:08:03,139
and continuous learning.

345
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:04,220
Not to say that those other ones

346
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,620
don't, but I would say this one

347
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:07,879
requires the most by far.

348
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:09,480
New tools, APIs.

349
00:08:09,569 --> 00:08:11,379
So that's why throughout this

350
00:08:11,379 --> 00:08:12,709
training program,

351
00:08:12,889 --> 00:08:14,149
I'm going to try to get you on the

352
00:08:14,149 --> 00:08:16,209
right mindset, as opposed to just

353
00:08:16,209 --> 00:08:16,629
like,

354
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:17,730
here's the tool, is this, that,

355
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:18,300
the other thing.

356
00:08:18,389 --> 00:08:19,279
You can get that anywhere.

357
00:08:19,389 --> 00:08:21,720
But really, the best way to think

358
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,060
about actually approaching this

359
00:08:23,089 --> 00:08:23,720
business model

360
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:24,980
is what I'm going to cover the

361
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:25,420
most.

362
00:08:25,509 --> 00:08:28,750
A good example, I see a lot in

363
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,839
client ascension, like the VO3.

364
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:32,340
Google came out with this tool

365
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:34,500
called VO3 that makes videos.

366
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:35,918
But someone in client ascension

367
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,000
took it and made ads.

368
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:38,418
And now they're selling that as a

369
00:08:38,418 --> 00:08:40,120
service, like AI ads as a service.

370
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:41,798
Like that didn't exist two months

371
00:08:41,798 --> 00:08:43,500
ago, but now it does, right?

372
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:44,889
So you can view it as like, oh

373
00:08:44,889 --> 00:08:45,860
man, I got to learn all these new

374
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:46,259
things.

375
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:47,440
Or you can view it as like, wow,

376
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,600
this is a good opportunity.

377
00:08:48,649 --> 00:08:50,070
I have all these potential offers

378
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:50,710
I can sell.

379
00:08:55,309 --> 00:08:56,480
So as I mentioned, like the

380
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,279
mindset piece is really important.

381
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:00,730
So this is where something called

382
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:03,139
system thinking is quite key.

383
00:09:04,029 --> 00:09:05,679
So oftentimes when people come

384
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:07,259
into this business model,

385
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:09,950
they think in, we're just going to

386
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:11,519
plug in one automation there

387
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:12,850
and one automation here.

388
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:15,409
But a business is a collection of

389
00:09:15,409 --> 00:09:17,279
processes, right?

390
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:19,919
So you need to look at the lead

391
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:23,250
gen is connected to the sales,

392
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:24,299
which is connected to the

393
00:09:24,299 --> 00:09:24,960
fulfillment,

394
00:09:25,049 --> 00:09:27,480
which is connected to getting

395
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,450
testimonials and case studies and

396
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:29,879
referrals.

397
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:31,419
All of that is connected.

398
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:34,340
So you need to realize that your

399
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,120
automations that you build

400
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:37,519
and the systems that you build for

401
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,909
clients is the exact same way.

402
00:09:40,049 --> 00:09:41,460
What I'm getting at is when you're

403
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:43,039
looking at a client's business,

404
00:09:43,129 --> 00:09:44,580
look at it as a collection of

405
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:45,120
systems

406
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:47,279
so that you can pick out where the

407
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:48,909
bottlenecks are and where the

408
00:09:49,059 --> 00:09:49,340
issues are

409
00:09:49,429 --> 00:09:50,740
so that you're fixing the right

410
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:51,100
things

411
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:52,460
as opposed to just like picking

412
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:53,179
one automation

413
00:09:53,269 --> 00:09:54,399
that might not generate a ton of

414
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:54,820
value.

415
00:09:54,909 --> 00:09:56,190
And I'll give you some more

416
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,730
resources on this as we move

417
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:58,610
forward here.

418
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:04,759
So how does this typically go when

419
00:10:04,759 --> 00:10:06,519
you engage somebody?

420
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:08,679
The first entry point is typically

421
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:11,000
you're not going to get to use

422
00:10:11,309 --> 00:10:11,919
that systems thinking.

423
00:10:12,009 --> 00:10:13,429
You're going to have to start with

424
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,200
a single pain point, which is

425
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:15,940
fine.

426
00:10:16,029 --> 00:10:17,409
Maybe it is the bottleneck that

427
00:10:17,429 --> 00:10:18,970
you're able to identify just based

428
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:20,000
on talking to somebody.

429
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:21,100
Sometimes you can do that.

430
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:22,399
So you're going to do a single

431
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:23,759
automation for somebody.

432
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:24,879
They're going to see the value.

433
00:10:25,029 --> 00:10:25,679
They're going to get some ROI.

434
00:10:25,769 --> 00:10:27,360
And that's where you then propose

435
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,909
something like a system audit

436
00:10:29,009 --> 00:10:29,990
where you review their

437
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:32,399
comprehensive business processes

438
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:33,399
and operations and workflows

439
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:34,720
and see if there's any other

440
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,580
things you can do.

441
00:10:35,669 --> 00:10:37,929
And then you continue implementing

442
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:39,370
the ones that drive ROI

443
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:41,320
because you want to do things that

444
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,620
solve actual problems,

445
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:44,370
not just shiny, you know, N8N

446
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:45,200
templates.

447
00:10:45,289 --> 00:10:46,669
And I'll keep bringing that up as

448
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:46,960
we go

449
00:10:47,049 --> 00:10:48,379
because that's a completely

450
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,299
commoditized thing at this point.

451
00:10:50,389 --> 00:10:51,509
And then you want to become a

452
00:10:51,509 --> 00:10:52,440
scaling partner.

453
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:53,240
So this is how you want to

454
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:54,120
position yourself.

455
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:55,220
You want to be someone that

456
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:56,720
unlocks scaling for these business

457
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,029
owners

458
00:10:57,129 --> 00:10:58,539
by helping them use the latest

459
00:10:58,539 --> 00:10:59,580
technology to scale

460
00:10:59,669 --> 00:11:01,889
as opposed to human capital, which

461
00:11:01,889 --> 00:11:03,340
is like, you know, employees and

462
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:04,059
things like that.

463
00:11:04,149 --> 00:11:06,259
The most successful automation

464
00:11:06,259 --> 00:11:08,529
agencies grow with their clients

465
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:10,100
and become partners as opposed to

466
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:11,340
like one-time vendors.

467
00:11:11,429 --> 00:11:12,710
This is very hard to do in the

468
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,450
beginning,

469
00:11:13,549 --> 00:11:14,769
but as you get more reps, more

470
00:11:14,769 --> 00:11:15,539
case studies,

471
00:11:15,629 --> 00:11:16,840
eventually people will begin to

472
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,279
trust you

473
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:18,269
and you'll work with them for a

474
00:11:18,289 --> 00:11:18,750
long time.

475
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:26,080
So ultimately, the opportunity is

476
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,139
you get to solve problems

477
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:28,120
with the new and latest

478
00:11:28,149 --> 00:11:29,679
technology, which is super cool.

479
00:11:29,769 --> 00:11:31,450
But only if you focus on actual

480
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:32,639
business outcomes

481
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:34,200
as opposed to just like, I like

482
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,389
N8N or I like to do this stuff.

483
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:37,629
That's not going to help you grow

484
00:11:37,629 --> 00:11:38,370
your business.

485
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:39,460
That's going to be good for maybe

486
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:40,840
like your employees in the future.

487
00:11:40,929 --> 00:11:42,580
But you as the business owner need

488
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:43,879
to focus on actually driving real

489
00:11:43,879 --> 00:11:44,980
results for your clients.

490
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,500
This stuff isn't super valuable

491
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,779
for, or not,

492
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:51,250
I would say it is still valuable

493
00:11:51,269 --> 00:11:53,120
for people that are not doing 10K

494
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:53,860
plus a month,

495
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:55,399
but they don't have enough money

496
00:11:55,399 --> 00:11:57,000
to pay you to help them with it.

497
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:58,860
So focus on businesses that are

498
00:11:58,860 --> 00:11:59,620
growing.

499
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:01,370
They have a few employees that

500
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:03,309
have the potential to waste time

501
00:12:03,409 --> 00:12:04,539
because as you add more people,

502
00:12:04,539 --> 00:12:06,139
things get more complex

503
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:07,649
and that's where inefficiencies

504
00:12:07,659 --> 00:12:08,419
start to crop up

505
00:12:08,509 --> 00:12:09,230
and that's where you can really

506
00:12:09,309 --> 00:12:09,740
help them.

507
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:11,490
You want to position yourself as a

508
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:12,899
growth partner, not just a tech

509
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:13,759
implementer.

510
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:15,320
You want to develop systems

511
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,259
thinking as your core competency

512
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:19,779
as opposed to just like, I'm an

513
00:12:19,779 --> 00:12:21,740
expert in N8N or make.com

514
00:12:21,929 --> 00:12:23,259
or whatever the case may be.

515
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:25,779
And in this field, you're going to

516
00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:26,899
have to commit to continuous

517
00:12:26,899 --> 00:12:27,320
learning

518
00:12:27,409 --> 00:12:28,960
while also delivering client

519
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,580
results,

520
00:12:29,669 --> 00:12:31,159
which may not be as much of the

521
00:12:31,159 --> 00:12:33,059
case in other business models.

522
00:12:33,149 --> 00:12:35,419
All right, we'll jump in the next

523
00:12:35,419 --> 00:12:38,259
one, which is about the ICP

524
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:41,009
and how to get your first

525
00:12:41,009 --> 00:12:42,100
automation client.
