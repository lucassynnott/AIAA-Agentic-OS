1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:01,810
All right now we're going to talk

2
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:04,639
about automations clients want and

3
00:00:04,639 --> 00:00:06,000
more importantly

4
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:07,940
how to spot automations that maybe

5
00:00:08,169 --> 00:00:09,810
they don't know they want but you

6
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:10,970
can see that they need

7
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:13,220
so what does that look like focus

8
00:00:13,449 --> 00:00:15,250
on ball next next slide talk a

9
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:16,879
little bit about the

10
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:18,809
theory of constraints i've already

11
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:20,649
mentioned this a couple times in

12
00:00:20,649 --> 00:00:21,839
the previous ones but

13
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,859
think about automations that drive

14
00:00:24,089 --> 00:00:25,730
revenue or leverage so time

15
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:27,760
savings making money

16
00:00:29,019 --> 00:00:30,629
is it high value low value that

17
00:00:30,629 --> 00:00:32,659
really depends on frequency right

18
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:34,789
so this happens task once every

19
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:37,060
three months probably not worth

20
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:39,280
automating even if it's in one of

21
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,520
these categories so think about

22
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:43,880
those cases as well theory

23
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46,869
constraints is you want to look at

24
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,520
a business as a collection of

25
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,079
steps and

26
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:53,039
systems and processes and every

27
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:56,039
business has a constraint so one

28
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:58,719
business might be lead generation

29
00:00:58,909 --> 00:01:00,030
maybe they don't have enough

30
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:01,439
traffic another might be their

31
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:03,039
closing rate they're not selling

32
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:05,900
well enough another might be that

33
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:08,540
their fulfillment is bad so

34
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:11,359
sometimes it doesn't make sense to

35
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:12,400
automate

36
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:14,760
the aspects of the fulfillment if

37
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,700
they don't have a good offer

38
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,640
already and traffic's bad and all

39
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:18,719
those

40
00:01:18,909 --> 00:01:20,099
different things so you need to

41
00:01:20,099 --> 00:01:21,540
think about what is the singular

42
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,640
bottleneck that limits how fast or

43
00:01:24,829 --> 00:01:26,370
efficiently the whole system can

44
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:28,069
operate so instead of optimizing

45
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,439
everything you want to focus

46
00:01:29,629 --> 00:01:30,909
your energy on fixing the

47
00:01:30,909 --> 00:01:32,810
bottleneck that's why you don't

48
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:34,400
ask what do you want to automate

49
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:35,120
when you talk to

50
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:36,209
your clients you say what's

51
00:01:36,209 --> 00:01:37,510
currently slowing down the most

52
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:38,799
and then see if there's any way

53
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:39,680
you can help there

54
00:01:39,819 --> 00:01:41,620
so specific automations i've seen

55
00:01:41,849 --> 00:01:43,409
work very well especially if

56
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:45,200
you're going to be looking after

57
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:47,629
agencies uh client onboarding this

58
00:01:47,629 --> 00:01:49,400
is a big one creates a lot of

59
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,000
leverage there are so many steps

60
00:01:52,189 --> 00:01:53,810
depending on the type of agency to

61
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:55,609
actually onboard a new client you

62
00:01:55,609 --> 00:01:57,599
need to send them welcome emails

63
00:01:57,790 --> 00:01:58,959
links forms you need to create

64
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:00,480
tasks in your project management

65
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,079
system you need to create folders

66
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:02,560
in your cloud

67
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,450
storage like google drive you need

68
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:06,200
to maybe save the proposal or the

69
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,710
contract you need to fill in some

70
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:09,520
checklists with

71
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:11,379
all their information you need to

72
00:02:11,379 --> 00:02:13,110
create the different resource

73
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:14,490
documents for your team to

74
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:14,879
understand

75
00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:16,650
what's going on you just sign the

76
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:18,379
roles and timelines and notify

77
00:02:18,379 --> 00:02:20,400
everybody maybe in slack that you

78
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:20,639
signed

79
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:22,580
a new client there's so many steps

80
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,439
there and i think this is one of

81
00:02:24,469 --> 00:02:26,080
the best ones if you're going out

82
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:28,009
for that that agency but think

83
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,449
about this from the perspective of

84
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,319
like in any business what is

85
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:32,620
something

86
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:34,580
that has a lot of manual steps and

87
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:36,800
is really painful to do so that's

88
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,400
an example of leverage

89
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:41,099
another example here is of

90
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:43,169
generating revenue so automating

91
00:02:43,699 --> 00:02:45,439
the creation of proposals what you

92
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:46,590
can do is take their winning

93
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:48,090
proposals that they manually wrote

94
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:49,250
for years and years and years

95
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:53,969
feed that into a reg bot and train

96
00:02:53,969 --> 00:02:57,349
it up on the best practices and

97
00:02:57,349 --> 00:02:59,840
then from there habit generate

98
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,310
what the problem statement is what

99
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:03,020
the solution statement is maybe

100
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:04,479
even timelines

101
00:03:04,669 --> 00:03:06,250
that have it to auto send for

102
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,289
signature other things you can do

103
00:03:08,729 --> 00:03:10,960
also here is like take it from

104
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:12,680
their meeting transcripts to all

105
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,340
their sales calls if they click a

106
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:15,830
button maybe in slack or in their

107
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:18,120
project management system or crm

108
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,289
it'll go and generate this if the

109
00:03:20,289 --> 00:03:22,080
person is a fit based on the

110
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:23,490
discussion using the transcript of

111
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:24,650
the meeting all these are good

112
00:03:24,669 --> 00:03:26,000
opportunities because if you can

113
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:26,319
increase

114
00:03:26,509 --> 00:03:28,009
sales velocity they can get their

115
00:03:28,009 --> 00:03:29,629
cash faster than they can pay you

116
00:03:29,629 --> 00:03:31,289
more money to do more things right

117
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:33,280
another one is crms and project

118
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,169
management systems i've already

119
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,120
talked about those systems are

120
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:37,889
very

121
00:03:38,189 --> 00:03:39,930
common in all service businesses

122
00:03:40,169 --> 00:03:42,169
and really they're just a place to

123
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:44,479
store data and collaborate with

124
00:03:44,659 --> 00:03:46,039
but you can really supercharge

125
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:47,750
those so for example um it's

126
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:50,240
creating automation so from

127
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,020
calendly for

128
00:03:51,229 --> 00:03:52,909
example automatically captures the

129
00:03:52,909 --> 00:03:54,469
information and puts in the crm

130
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:56,719
and notifies the sales team that

131
00:03:56,909 --> 00:03:59,060
there's a new uh lead so they can

132
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:01,580
actually earn away same with like

133
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:03,680
cold email if you get a positive

134
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:05,490
cold email response you could

135
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:07,490
automate the notification of that

136
00:04:07,889 --> 00:04:09,360
auto scheduling follow-up

137
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,479
reminders or emails

138
00:04:10,669 --> 00:04:12,150
for you maybe even drafting the

139
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:13,830
next response using ai based on

140
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:15,430
how you've um written it i

141
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:16,069
wouldn't

142
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:17,649
recommend sending it yet it's not

143
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:19,040
quite there yet and i'd rather

144
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:20,639
have a human load because this is

145
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:21,040
like

146
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:22,819
as close to money as you can get

147
00:04:22,819 --> 00:04:24,569
so you want to make sure that that

148
00:04:24,569 --> 00:04:27,740
stuff is airtight or another good

149
00:04:28,029 --> 00:04:29,610
use is like when someone books in

150
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:31,269
so building on top of these ones

151
00:04:31,329 --> 00:04:32,810
is actually researching their

152
00:04:33,209 --> 00:04:33,839
website

153
00:04:34,029 --> 00:04:36,259
and them through apis and then

154
00:04:36,259 --> 00:04:38,680
storing that research for the

155
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,959
sales rep to see and then even

156
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:41,439
working in

157
00:04:41,629 --> 00:04:42,850
some case studies that you have

158
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:44,279
and saying okay this case study

159
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:45,680
fits this type of client and stuff

160
00:04:45,689 --> 00:04:45,759
like

161
00:04:45,949 --> 00:04:47,089
that so there's tons of

162
00:04:47,089 --> 00:04:48,990
opportunity there and then from

163
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:50,879
project management after you do

164
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:51,670
the onboarding

165
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:53,389
and the sale like you built some

166
00:04:53,389 --> 00:04:55,240
automations to auto create tasks

167
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,000
so maybe every week you have to do

168
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,410
a new marketing campaign so you

169
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:00,839
could automate the creation of

170
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:02,399
that task and the assignment and

171
00:05:02,589 --> 00:05:04,339
you know pull on the stats from

172
00:05:04,569 --> 00:05:06,209
the last week and have ai analyze

173
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:07,839
that these are just things i'm

174
00:05:08,029 --> 00:05:09,579
coming up with the top of my head

175
00:05:09,579 --> 00:05:11,389
i haven't built all of these four

176
00:05:11,389 --> 00:05:12,810
coins you just gotta get creative

177
00:05:13,389 --> 00:05:14,370
right if someone asks for this

178
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:15,540
this is where you can help them

179
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,879
out if this is a problem they have

180
00:05:17,069 --> 00:05:18,769
send slack alerts for key

181
00:05:18,769 --> 00:05:20,709
milestone changes um you know

182
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:23,370
notifications and assign team

183
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:24,079
members

184
00:05:24,209 --> 00:05:25,500
so yeah think of crms and pm

185
00:05:25,509 --> 00:05:27,339
systems as your stock engine that

186
00:05:27,339 --> 00:05:29,680
you can upgrade automation mods to

187
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:29,920
make

188
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:31,689
the system better the big problem

189
00:05:31,689 --> 00:05:32,800
is as businesses grow

190
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:35,920
communication becomes an issue um

191
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,040
and as soon as one

192
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,560
person drops the ball again going

193
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,000
back to that theory of constraints

194
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,680
if that person is the bottleneck

195
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:41,759
and

196
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:42,769
they forget to tell somebody

197
00:05:42,779 --> 00:05:44,029
something and maybe something gets

198
00:05:44,029 --> 00:05:45,560
delayed for a day or two and then

199
00:05:45,769 --> 00:05:47,089
the client gets mad happens all

200
00:05:47,089 --> 00:05:48,560
the time in service businesses

201
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:50,560
this is where you could help with

202
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:50,569
if

203
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,050
you know something moves to a

204
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:53,279
certain stage it alerts the team

205
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,560
tells them it's ready for your

206
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:54,769
turn

207
00:05:55,139 --> 00:05:57,509
to do this um it really eliminates

208
00:05:57,509 --> 00:05:59,579
the uh hey did you do this yet

209
00:05:59,579 --> 00:06:02,399
messages that happen all the time

210
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:03,550
uh a lot of the tools now

211
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:05,279
especially click up which is what

212
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:07,040
i use for project management

213
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:08,339
have these awesome ai stand ups

214
00:06:08,339 --> 00:06:09,839
that'll generate daily updates and

215
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:11,439
you can just click on each person

216
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:13,300
and they'll automatically generate

217
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,870
like what they did for the week or

218
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:16,240
even for client updates you

219
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:17,930
automatically generate those so

220
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:19,550
just by virtue of setting them up

221
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:20,959
there's some ai features they

222
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:21,110
could

223
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:22,860
benefit there from using a project

224
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:25,329
management system yeah building i

225
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,000
guess i kind of just spoiled this

226
00:06:28,189 --> 00:06:29,319
next one but yeah that that's kind

227
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:30,470
of what i was getting at is like

228
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:31,680
the weekly kpi summaries or

229
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:33,610
client updates big one too like

230
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:35,779
cold email agencies they have all

231
00:06:36,009 --> 00:06:38,160
the stats positive reply rates

232
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,360
email sent

233
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:41,110
emails replied to emails and

234
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:42,790
campaign to yet to be sent all

235
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:44,319
those different things

236
00:06:44,589 --> 00:06:46,529
those stats could be just like a

237
00:06:46,569 --> 00:06:48,819
templated message that the owner

238
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:50,560
gets every day for each one

239
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,740
or even you send it to the clients

240
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,629
like we sent 500 emails today and

241
00:06:54,689 --> 00:06:55,920
we've got this many responses

242
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:57,459
just like if you want to like

243
00:06:57,459 --> 00:06:59,129
really keep them in the loop um

244
00:06:59,129 --> 00:07:00,529
another one is real-time

245
00:07:00,529 --> 00:07:00,889
dashboards

246
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,100
so again kind of that same stuff

247
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,990
but just building the dashboard

248
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:06,149
itself and then hooking up the

249
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:07,829
automations to collect the data so

250
00:07:07,829 --> 00:07:09,470
that two-in-one thing you get paid

251
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:10,879
to build the dashboard and you

252
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:11,129
also

253
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:12,470
obviously you do the front end but

254
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:13,569
then you're like okay now we got

255
00:07:13,569 --> 00:07:14,560
to get the data in here so you

256
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,970
don't have to manually put it in

257
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:17,439
and then click buttons to make it

258
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:18,790
happen you can just have it

259
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,120
automated

260
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:20,649
you can use something like looker

261
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:22,079
studio or now the ai coding tools

262
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:22,930
are getting so good

263
00:07:23,189 --> 00:07:24,430
you could probably just use that

264
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:25,720
and then connect some apis and

265
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,000
call it a day i just like maybe if

266
00:07:28,269 --> 00:07:30,350
projects are delayed so you could

267
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:32,449
look at if project doesn't move

268
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:34,629
for three days notify the owner of

269
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:36,449
the project manager like hey can

270
00:07:36,449 --> 00:07:38,259
you check in on this so sometimes

271
00:07:38,259 --> 00:07:40,160
people miss things as as you grow

272
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:43,120
and then yeah just like creating

273
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:46,350
this frictionless sync right so

274
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:48,240
like those were all the individual

275
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:49,709
systems but now if you think about

276
00:07:49,709 --> 00:07:50,970
the whole business as one big

277
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,560
system you could have the

278
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:53,949
lead generation you pull the leads

279
00:07:53,949 --> 00:07:55,040
from the outreach tool it's

280
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,370
directly in the crm with tagging

281
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:58,660
you qualify them maybe you put

282
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:00,490
them through some kind of

283
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,199
screening process with ai to say

284
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:03,519
who's the

285
00:08:03,709 --> 00:08:05,129
best sales rep for this product or

286
00:08:05,129 --> 00:08:07,139
this service type um maybe you

287
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:09,360
send them different free call

288
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:10,709
sequences depending on what type

289
00:08:10,709 --> 00:08:13,170
of business they are and then once

290
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,439
they close you automatically

291
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:16,160
onboard them and

292
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:17,639
put the right task type and

293
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:19,120
project tasks with the right

294
00:08:19,329 --> 00:08:20,720
templates in the project

295
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,519
management system so

296
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:22,720
like there's just so much

297
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,149
opportunity there another big one

298
00:08:25,149 --> 00:08:27,759
is just like enabling founders

299
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,120
with ai

300
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:31,009
automation so just asking them to

301
00:08:31,009 --> 00:08:32,899
share their day to day oftentimes

302
00:08:32,899 --> 00:08:34,559
it's like they just want to really

303
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,230
know what who they're meeting with

304
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:37,389
like background all the

305
00:08:37,389 --> 00:08:38,730
participants maybe some pm

306
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,519
information

307
00:08:39,658 --> 00:08:41,200
um or then just like getting a

308
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,090
daily digest email of like maybe

309
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:44,960
what tasks were completed in the

310
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,279
project

311
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:46,620
management system who did what

312
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,009
kind of thing just so they can get

313
00:08:48,009 --> 00:08:49,110
a pulse check while these don't

314
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:49,440
like

315
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:51,139
scale across the whole team it's

316
00:08:51,139 --> 00:08:52,799
super beneficial for the owner

317
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:56,639
themselves um and then just some

318
00:08:56,639 --> 00:08:56,879
other

319
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:58,080
ways again i want to teach you

320
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,419
guys to fish as opposed to me just

321
00:08:59,419 --> 00:09:00,629
telling you like build these

322
00:09:00,629 --> 00:09:01,200
automations

323
00:09:01,389 --> 00:09:03,620
interview the team members of the

324
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:06,039
um the clients so ask to interview

325
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:08,240
your shadow employees doing work

326
00:09:08,429 --> 00:09:10,480
look for better tasks watch their

327
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,049
screens find the rev lab

328
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:14,769
opportunities in the skies and

329
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:15,440
then if once

330
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:16,759
you've got some trust get audit

331
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:18,149
their whole business interview

332
00:09:18,149 --> 00:09:21,279
their team members and then find

333
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:21,519
using

334
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:23,059
this framework some more things

335
00:09:23,059 --> 00:09:24,419
and then if you get a if you've

336
00:09:24,419 --> 00:09:26,080
got trust you probably charge for

337
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:26,490
the audit but

338
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,559
as you're starting out just offer

339
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:30,120
it for free if you feel like this

340
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,679
business could really benefit from

341
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,080
this i'll give it to them for free

342
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,309
and then just charge for the

343
00:09:34,309 --> 00:09:38,159
implementation so yeah yeah to be

344
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:38,220
honest

345
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:39,399
some of the best automation has

346
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:40,259
come from just chatting with

347
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:42,879
people's employees and then here's

348
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:43,120
kind

349
00:09:43,269 --> 00:09:45,049
of uh impact to implementation

350
00:09:45,289 --> 00:09:47,320
effort just knowing which ones are

351
00:09:47,549 --> 00:09:49,659
the best um these ones are good to

352
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:49,919
get

353
00:09:50,669 --> 00:09:52,419
the ball rolling take care of

354
00:09:52,649 --> 00:09:55,440
these ones first and then um if

355
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,919
you've got time if you haven't had

356
00:09:57,919 --> 00:09:58,240
a chance

357
00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:59,559
to do a lot of discovery i'm sure

358
00:09:59,559 --> 00:10:00,879
you could find some more impact

359
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:02,799
quick wins do those and then

360
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:03,190
obviously

361
00:10:03,389 --> 00:10:04,580
these are the best ones that get

362
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:05,960
you paid the most money and this

363
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,840
should be the long-term focus

364
00:10:08,029 --> 00:10:10,590
so that is in a nutshell what

365
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:14,029
automations you can help build for

366
00:10:14,029 --> 00:10:15,279
businesses
