1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,919
Okay so now you need to something

2
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:05,589
to sell so i'm going to talk about

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:06,879
how to package this

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,710
the different ways you can price

5
00:00:08,779 --> 00:00:10,279
it and then ultimately how to

6
00:00:10,589 --> 00:00:12,019
deliver whatever you sell so

7
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,199
different ways of packaging

8
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:16,629
there's three different ways i'm

9
00:00:16,629 --> 00:00:17,920
going to blur this just

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,739
so we can talk about one at a time

11
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,699
custom builds this is where you go

12
00:00:21,699 --> 00:00:23,760
in you understand their

13
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:25,129
business and you build them

14
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:26,600
something completely custom

15
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,320
tailored to their unique process

16
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:28,629
usually

17
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:30,079
this is a higher price point since

18
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:31,420
it's tailored to them and it

19
00:00:31,429 --> 00:00:33,509
typically takes longer since you

20
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:33,759
don't

21
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,770
have any templates or things to

22
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:38,090
start 80 of the way there this is

23
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:40,159
where you typically start to be

24
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,500
honest you can start with a

25
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:43,140
template and then just tailor it

26
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:44,960
as well that's another way that's

27
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:45,079
more

28
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,920
of an offer based but if you're

29
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:48,560
going to like say upwork or your

30
00:00:48,829 --> 00:00:50,159
warm network or wherever you're

31
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,369
getting at your first client

32
00:00:51,369 --> 00:00:52,840
oftentimes it's like something at

33
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,140
a left field that you've never

34
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:54,320
seen

35
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,359
before which is okay it's good to

36
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:58,479
get that practice but you want to

37
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:02,640
move away from this as soon as you

38
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,599
can unless you like this i kind of

39
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:06,689
like this i sometimes still dabble

40
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,230
in this because i feel like

41
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:10,010
i'm learning new things throughout

42
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:11,439
but it's not the most scalable if

43
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:12,560
a guy's being honest

44
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,269
the other one is the product high

45
00:01:15,269 --> 00:01:17,370
system so this is where you've

46
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:19,200
already done this for different

47
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,159
clients

48
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:22,200
say you choose a niche of like

49
00:01:22,569 --> 00:01:24,840
home service ai calling agent and

50
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,280
like that's your product you

51
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:28,799
come in but you say hey you know

52
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,340
what we're going to tweak this

53
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,760
exactly to your business

54
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,799
um so if you know you're a cleaner

55
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:35,680
we're going to change all the

56
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,480
copies so it talks just like it

57
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,340
owns the business can know

58
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,810
everything about your business

59
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:42,480
that's like that 20 tweaking so

60
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:42,719
that's

61
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,750
where it's faster implementation

62
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:46,459
it's reliable tested you've

63
00:01:46,459 --> 00:01:48,310
already done it and you have more

64
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,730
predictable outcomes of what

65
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:50,989
you're going to do but this is

66
00:01:50,989 --> 00:01:52,640
typically going to be a little bit

67
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:52,959
cheaper

68
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,159
you'll be able to sell it to

69
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:55,680
unless you're like you're really

70
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,120
good at making a good business

71
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:57,439
case

72
00:01:57,519 --> 00:01:58,640
but it's hard to make a good

73
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,140
business case with like limited

74
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,420
information so that's the

75
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:02,079
trade-off between

76
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,430
these two is like this one you're

77
00:02:04,489 --> 00:02:06,599
going to be able to sell easier

78
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:08,639
this is a lot harder to sell but

79
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:08,960
it can

80
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:10,699
also lead to more money so let's

81
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,349
pick what you want easy to sell

82
00:02:12,379 --> 00:02:15,199
hard to sell easier to fulfill

83
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,500
hard to fulfill i think alex ramos

84
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,110
he talks about this is 100 million

85
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:19,919
dollar offers there's like a

86
00:02:20,009 --> 00:02:21,960
continuum of easy to fulfill and

87
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:24,280
hard and easy to sell and hard to

88
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,159
fulfill and hard to sell same

89
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:26,400
thing

90
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,219
here so um and then a retainer so

91
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,849
this is typically after you've

92
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:31,539
done some work for somebody they

93
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,159
trust you

94
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,770
already you can move into a

95
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,599
retainer where you say we'll give

96
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:37,750
you x number of automations a

97
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:38,560
month or x

98
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:40,599
systems a month or it's unlimited

99
00:02:40,969 --> 00:02:42,900
for this price the only downfall

100
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,719
of this is like you might be

101
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,419
underselling yourself because

102
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:48,169
you'll discover opportunities you

103
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:49,840
might save them thousands of

104
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,800
dollars you might help them grow

105
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,120
from 25k to 200k but you're

106
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,039
charging them a small retainer so

107
00:02:57,039 --> 00:02:57,120
that's

108
00:02:57,199 --> 00:02:58,610
for like things like rev share and

109
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:00,090
all that stuff comes in but that's

110
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:01,120
a lot harder to sell with

111
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:02,539
automation because the impact

112
00:03:02,539 --> 00:03:04,159
isn't directly related like to the

113
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:06,039
actual getting of money so it's a

114
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:06,240
lot

115
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,280
harder to actually quantify that

116
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:10,689
you trade stability here for the

117
00:03:10,689 --> 00:03:12,639
biggest amount of revenue as

118
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:12,960
opposed

119
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:14,310
to like with these custom builds

120
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:15,710
and these product high systems if

121
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:17,110
they're just one time setup fees

122
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:19,159
then your revenue will be a little

123
00:03:19,389 --> 00:03:21,000
bit more lumpy as you go you'll

124
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,479
likely use all three of these

125
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,110
structures as your agency matures

126
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:25,569
each has its place depending on

127
00:03:25,569 --> 00:03:27,280
your current skill level and your

128
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,539
client's specific needs and

129
00:03:28,539 --> 00:03:30,719
timelines so now that you've

130
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:33,759
chosen a way to package this now

131
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:33,919
you need

132
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,090
to a way to price it so there's a

133
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:35,960
few different ways to price

134
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:39,509
automation this is typically where

135
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:39,759
you

136
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,030
start this is what those guys on

137
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:44,280
fiverr and upwork are doing and

138
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,180
it's hourly because you don't

139
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:46,319
really

140
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,689
know how long things are going to

141
00:03:47,689 --> 00:03:48,900
take the advantage of this is

142
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,120
there's a little risk of the scope

143
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:51,439
grows

144
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,280
and you say okay you asked for

145
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,039
five hours of work customer but

146
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:56,719
now you're asking for all these

147
00:03:56,719 --> 00:03:56,960
things

148
00:03:57,039 --> 00:03:58,419
you can charge more per hour um

149
00:03:58,419 --> 00:04:00,889
but there's going to be an income

150
00:04:00,889 --> 00:04:03,439
ceiling pretty quick because you

151
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:03,439
can

152
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,069
only charge so much for hour and

153
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:06,879
clients may micromanage hours this

154
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:08,479
is good starting out if you have a

155
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:08,580
hard

156
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,610
time quantifying the value of the

157
00:04:11,129 --> 00:04:12,509
automation ideally this is where

158
00:04:12,509 --> 00:04:14,159
you want to move into which is

159
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:14,310
like

160
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:16,699
fixed price um so value based

161
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:19,420
pricing is probably the best here

162
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:22,240
and of course also accounting for

163
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:22,399
your

164
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,290
time because even if you price on

165
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,180
value you still want to make sure

166
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:28,000
that like you're making a good

167
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:28,560
hourly

168
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,209
rate as you're doing it i think

169
00:04:30,459 --> 00:04:32,000
there's this thing where you could

170
00:04:32,269 --> 00:04:34,079
maybe say okay i can get this much

171
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:34,550
money

172
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,959
but like the value is really high

173
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:39,100
but the hours i'm gonna have to

174
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,560
put in to actually generate this

175
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,060
value is very expensive so you

176
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,620
need to consider that so that's

177
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,360
the risk of under pricing a really

178
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,829
complex work but it's higher

179
00:04:47,259 --> 00:04:48,250
received value and rewards

180
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:49,730
efficiency that's the other

181
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:50,399
problem with

182
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,290
hourly's this is good if you suck

183
00:04:52,779 --> 00:04:54,180
because you take a long time to do

184
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,240
the work so you get paid more

185
00:04:56,319 --> 00:04:57,670
but if you're actually good at the

186
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:59,199
work then you're being basically

187
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,829
handicapped by an hourly rate

188
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,439
and then next is of course the

189
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,519
retainer so this is like taking

190
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:09,509
these two pricing models but then

191
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,769
like bundling them so like you

192
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:12,120
could have an hourly retainer so

193
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,670
it's like you get 20 hours per

194
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:14,160
month for

195
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:16,050
x price or it's like a fixed price

196
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:17,939
retainer it's like this much per

197
00:05:17,939 --> 00:05:19,750
month every month and we do as

198
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:22,100
much work as we can or x number of

199
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:24,449
improvements per month or it's

200
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:26,730
value based so maybe you audit

201
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:26,959
their

202
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:28,959
business and you're like okay

203
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:31,040
we've got this many things and i

204
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,949
can do this for ten thousand

205
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:33,439
dollars a

206
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:34,629
month or you can pay me per

207
00:05:34,629 --> 00:05:36,000
project it's going to be like

208
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,870
fifteen thousand dollars per

209
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,199
project and like

210
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:40,449
we can do it over a longer time

211
00:05:40,449 --> 00:05:41,819
horizon or something like that

212
00:05:41,819 --> 00:05:42,930
right so then they're like oh

213
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:43,360
there's more

214
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:45,250
value in doing it all at once so

215
00:05:45,259 --> 00:05:47,290
um the biggest issue here is just

216
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:49,199
like strong boundaries with

217
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:49,519
clients

218
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,839
to prevent over delivery so you

219
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:52,300
need to monitor even though you're

220
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:53,759
not charging hourly you need to

221
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:54,240
monitor the

222
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:55,449
hours you're putting in to make

223
00:05:55,449 --> 00:05:56,759
sure like you're not losing money

224
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:59,160
by working with somebody and yeah

225
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:00,170
keep it simple at the beginning

226
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:02,259
start with hourly or fixed price

227
00:06:02,259 --> 00:06:03,680
if you can like the the biggest

228
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:04,910
problem with fixed price is like

229
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:06,019
if you don't know how long it's

230
00:06:06,089 --> 00:06:07,129
going to take you you can like

231
00:06:07,389 --> 00:06:07,600
just

232
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,949
lose money which kind of sucks um

233
00:06:08,949 --> 00:06:10,350
so that's why i always pretty good

234
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:11,750
in the beginning because then

235
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:12,819
you start to get a feel of how

236
00:06:13,009 --> 00:06:14,079
long things are actually taking

237
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:15,160
you and then retainers are going

238
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:15,209
to

239
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:17,399
come after people know i can trust

240
00:06:17,629 --> 00:06:18,800
you and understand uh your

241
00:06:19,069 --> 00:06:19,920
workplace so

242
00:06:20,009 --> 00:06:23,040
based off that you're going to

243
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:26,300
sell something and once you sell

244
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,639
something you're going to need to

245
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:28,800
do

246
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:30,829
something called an onboarding

247
00:06:31,129 --> 00:06:32,699
call so what this is to get them

248
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:34,959
into your business into your world

249
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,149
so the first thing you need to do

250
00:06:36,149 --> 00:06:38,079
on that onboarding call um is set

251
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,550
expectations so clarify the

252
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,680
timeline the

253
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,490
deliverables talk about what

254
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,439
success looks like you want to be

255
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:47,269
very clear of what the expectation

256
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:47,519
is

257
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,759
obviously you've done a proposal

258
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:49,819
already you've said what the

259
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:51,279
deliverables are but you need to

260
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:51,439
make

261
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:52,750
sure you're still on the same page

262
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:53,480
before you get started

263
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,310
next you want to remind them what

264
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:59,199
they bought so you'd be shocked

265
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,040
even if it's been a couple days

266
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,720
you're like what did the client's

267
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:04,279
gonna forget what exactly is it

268
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:05,910
called did we actually include

269
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,689
you know connecting this to notion

270
00:07:07,819 --> 00:07:09,310
and air table you're like no like

271
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:10,639
you told me you didn't want

272
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,389
that so like that's not included

273
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:14,029
do you want that now i can't tell

274
00:07:14,029 --> 00:07:15,680
you the number of times i've had

275
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,189
that experience so remind them

276
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:18,800
review the contract really quick

277
00:07:18,819 --> 00:07:20,480
make sure everybody thinks good

278
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:20,720
tell

279
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,170
them the next steps the process

280
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:23,839
and immediate action items explain

281
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,120
how often you're going to

282
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,079
communicate say we're going to be

283
00:07:27,529 --> 00:07:29,110
communicating on click up or slack

284
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:30,879
or email or whatever just pick a

285
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:32,769
channel work with them whatever

286
00:07:32,779 --> 00:07:34,589
works best for them and then get

287
00:07:34,589 --> 00:07:36,470
all the access sorted out so

288
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:37,360
collect

289
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:39,399
the tools logins and two-factor

290
00:07:39,769 --> 00:07:42,250
authentication before the end of

291
00:07:42,269 --> 00:07:44,800
the call this is absolutely

292
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,790
massive so i'm just gonna sorry do

293
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:49,519
this so you can see everything um

294
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:52,040
two-factor authentication is super

295
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,279
important in automation it can

296
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:54,120
really make or break things

297
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:55,759
because the last thing you want to

298
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:56,639
do is text the

299
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,459
person at midnight hey i need to

300
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:00,629
get into your make.com account and

301
00:08:00,629 --> 00:08:02,230
the t2fa is not working and

302
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:03,629
it just like looks super

303
00:08:03,629 --> 00:08:05,439
unprofessional and just it's bad

304
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:07,439
experience um something i also

305
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:07,839
recommend

306
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,319
is if you're like using the same

307
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:10,870
tools over and over again you can

308
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:12,399
send an sop or video guide before

309
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,930
the calls the client can either if

310
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:15,410
they're tech savvy and like they

311
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:17,040
know what they're doing they can

312
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,930
prepare the logins and stuff but

313
00:08:18,939 --> 00:08:20,430
most of the time they probably

314
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,480
won't do it ahead of time but

315
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:22,959
worst case

316
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,000
you have this ready to go so then

317
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:24,990
when you get on the call you're

318
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
just like hey i'm going to send

319
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,410
you a link to

320
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,079
this thing or just check your

321
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:29,519
email it has a link to like the

322
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:31,279
document to show you what you need

323
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:31,560
to do

324
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,639
um that works very well as well

325
00:08:33,889 --> 00:08:35,850
but yeah let me just show you real

326
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:37,440
quick this email make

327
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,158
notifications

328
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,980
so what this means is basically

329
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:41,519
every time like you run the

330
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,298
automation if there's like an

331
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:43,759
error

332
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,639
or there's a warning like there's

333
00:08:46,169 --> 00:08:47,159
something not working properly

334
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:49,350
it'll send an email by default

335
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,480
and if it's the client's account

336
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:53,600
they're gonna get all of that

337
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,720
garbage in there so when you're

338
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,200
testing the

339
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:56,360
automation and things aren't

340
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:57,559
working properly they're just

341
00:08:57,610 --> 00:08:58,960
gonna get blasted with emails so

342
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:58,960
you

343
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,269
want to make sure you turn that

344
00:09:00,269 --> 00:09:01,629
off but then turn it back on once

345
00:09:01,629 --> 00:09:02,960
the automation's done so they

346
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,200
actually

347
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:04,169
do get notified if something

348
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,320
breaks because things do end up

349
00:09:06,419 --> 00:09:08,279
breaking from time to time one

350
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:09,190
thing i didn't

351
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:10,580
write on this slide was you want

352
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:11,789
to set them up with their own

353
00:09:11,789 --> 00:09:13,110
accounts so you don't want to

354
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:13,360
build the

355
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,909
automations on like your account

356
00:09:15,259 --> 00:09:16,169
because that just sets a bad

357
00:09:16,169 --> 00:09:17,840
precedent for relationships like

358
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,480
you're

359
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:20,549
essentially holding them hostage

360
00:09:20,549 --> 00:09:22,080
so like if they decide to leave

361
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:23,440
you you just turn off their

362
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,080
automations and

363
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:25,240
that's not really what you want to

364
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,120
be doing you want to be working

365
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:29,519
with people on merit as opposed to

366
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:31,120
i'm just like holding them hostage

367
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,639
so make sure you're setting up all

368
00:09:32,649 --> 00:09:34,080
this stuff on their accounts

369
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:36,639
themselves okay so let me show you

370
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:39,200
really quick what that make thing

371
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:41,200
looks like so if we come to

372
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,240
the so if you come over to your

373
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:45,720
name over here or the client's

374
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,679
name and then come to email

375
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:48,320
preferences

376
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,549
thing you want to turn off is

377
00:09:50,779 --> 00:09:52,230
these two here so errors and

378
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:54,019
scenario runs and warnings and

379
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:54,480
scenario

380
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:56,269
runs turn these off while you're

381
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:58,000
building and then when you're done

382
00:09:58,269 --> 00:09:59,700
you want to turn these back on

383
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:01,039
so you actually get notified so

384
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:02,399
just wanted to show you that there

385
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,759
okay so moving on you've done the

386
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,639
onboarding call you're like yeah

387
00:10:07,659 --> 00:10:09,490
we get to go build automations and

388
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:11,360
no you don't have not quite yet

389
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,529
you don't want to build blind so

390
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:15,309
what that means is before touching

391
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,720
make any to end or any automation

392
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:18,370
tool map the process in detail

393
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:19,840
this is a critical step that

394
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,860
prevents costly rework for you and

395
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,320
scope

396
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,440
creep because again you've you've

397
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:26,490
just throughout this whole thing

398
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:28,389
you reviewed the proposal again

399
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:28,559
you

400
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:30,139
asked if there's anything missing

401
00:10:30,409 --> 00:10:31,440
maybe they said there was you

402
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,960
updated the price you went back

403
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,600
you agreed on

404
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:34,820
it but then you build the

405
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:36,490
automation at the end they still

406
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:38,080
say hey this isn't right this

407
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:38,470
isn't what i

408
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:39,470
wanted like even if you do all

409
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:40,840
this stuff i'm telling you they

410
00:10:40,889 --> 00:10:42,320
still might do that so don't worry

411
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:42,389
but

412
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,149
this isn't gonna i'm trying to

413
00:10:44,299 --> 00:10:45,840
keep you safe throughout this

414
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:47,840
whole process so map the process

415
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,240
and then

416
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,179
document every step trigger action

417
00:10:50,179 --> 00:10:52,049
in the workflow capture edge cases

418
00:10:52,049 --> 00:10:54,399
and exceptions um if you don't

419
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,830
know what they are ask the client

420
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:57,279
is there any edge cases we need to

421
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:58,720
be considering this thing like

422
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:00,490
because do you ever enter i don't

423
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:02,110
know a french name with symbols

424
00:11:02,429 --> 00:11:04,159
maybe like that breaks something

425
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:06,190
i don't know just consider all the

426
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:08,210
different edge cases uh as you're

427
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:10,149
going uh validate the technical

428
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,629
feasibility um confirm all the

429
00:11:12,629 --> 00:11:15,279
needed apis and integrations are

430
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,279
available so check the websites

431
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:17,399
for

432
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:18,899
all the different tools that are

433
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,320
involved and make sure this all

434
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,840
works together accordingly and

435
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,240
then just

436
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,190
confirm expected outcomes this is

437
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:25,679
what you do after you build this

438
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:28,159
with the client so most beginners

439
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:28,490
skip

440
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:30,440
mapping and they just suffer from

441
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:32,000
angloscope creep don't be that

442
00:11:32,269 --> 00:11:35,529
person it sucks because you you're

443
00:11:35,659 --> 00:11:35,759
so

444
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,700
excited you're like oh i'm gonna

445
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,129
do this automation like two hours

446
00:11:38,169 --> 00:11:39,200
when it makes so much money

447
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,710
and then it takes you like 10

448
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:43,899
hours because the client keeps

449
00:11:43,899 --> 00:11:45,519
asking for stuff and you're like

450
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,559
oh i didn't set expectations here

451
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,509
um so like you re-deliver it you

452
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:51,360
make videos and looms like i'll

453
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:51,679
tell you

454
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:53,129
later to do do all this stuff and

455
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:54,529
i'm speaking from experience

456
00:11:54,529 --> 00:11:56,080
basically just don't make that

457
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:56,480
mistake

458
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,159
so what does that look like here's

459
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:01,340
a basic system for very basic

460
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:03,600
project management crm for a

461
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:05,539
photography company for example um

462
00:12:05,539 --> 00:12:06,990
and these are all the different

463
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:09,120
steps you could also add like the

464
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,629
different types of modules you

465
00:12:10,919 --> 00:12:12,240
would add based on the automation

466
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,700
so maybe this one says let's say

467
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:15,110
create

468
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:16,570
lead so you could write here like

469
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:17,909
create contact or create tasks

470
00:12:17,909 --> 00:12:19,279
because this was for click ups

471
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:19,600
would be a

472
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:21,179
created task of what the actual

473
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,720
module you're going to use in the

474
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:24,720
automation platform is called just

475
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:24,740
to

476
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:26,759
make it even clearer um okay so

477
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:28,940
you've done that you've got the

478
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:31,039
process map you want to show this

479
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:31,200
to

480
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:32,730
their client you can either set up

481
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,320
another meeting with them and walk

482
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:36,120
them through it it's probably best

483
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,730
or you can send them a loom and

484
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:39,549
walk them through it and send them

485
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:40,879
a link and explain each of the

486
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,899
decision points ask if it's valid

487
00:12:43,289 --> 00:12:44,919
accurate is there anything we're

488
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:48,000
missing just based on feedback be

489
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:49,940
reasonable here if they're making

490
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:51,669
some small tweaks that isn't in

491
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:54,259
the original scope of work um and

492
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:54,480
it's

493
00:12:54,529 --> 00:12:55,940
a fixed price like just accept it

494
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:57,379
but if it's a massive change it's

495
00:12:57,379 --> 00:12:59,039
going to have like 10 hours to

496
00:12:59,039 --> 00:12:59,279
project

497
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,889
then you you have a conversation

498
00:13:01,129 --> 00:13:02,399
then and then just get explicit

499
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,149
appropriately okay are you happy

500
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:04,320
with

501
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:07,019
this can i build this now and just

502
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:09,720
this step increases trust again

503
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,919
because they feel like they

504
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:12,710
designed

505
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:14,220
right even though you did all the

506
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,370
work they feel like just by

507
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:16,960
reviewing this and like providing

508
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,200
because

509
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:18,990
every time i guarantee you every

510
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,929
single time they're gonna say like

511
00:13:20,929 --> 00:13:22,720
one little thing it's okay can you

512
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:24,330
make sure like it capitalizes the

513
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:25,840
letters over here and you're like

514
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:27,590
yeah we can do that mr customer no

515
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,470
problem so yeah just doing that is

516
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,330
is super awesome for the client as

517
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:32,740
well because they feel more

518
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:35,389
involved so now you've done what

519
00:13:35,389 --> 00:13:37,779
you need to do you want to build

520
00:13:37,779 --> 00:13:40,480
and test extensively you want to

521
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:40,639
make

522
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,940
sure it works in every scenario

523
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,240
that you've talked about like a

524
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,450
single brook automation can

525
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:45,120
destroy weeks

526
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,649
of trust both up so like you've

527
00:13:46,899 --> 00:13:48,240
done all that work at a time um so

528
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:49,679
make sure you take the time to

529
00:13:49,769 --> 00:13:52,139
actually test it thoroughly um to

530
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:54,330
build up that trust further so

531
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:55,669
build modularly

532
00:13:56,799 --> 00:13:58,759
um create small testable

533
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:01,379
components don't create monster

534
00:14:01,379 --> 00:14:04,080
automations what i mean by that is

535
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:04,610
oftentimes

536
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,240
you can break up the steps for

537
00:14:07,049 --> 00:14:09,120
example you have this automation

538
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,639
that enriches data so maybe the

539
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,970
first automation is it scrapes the

540
00:14:15,049 --> 00:14:16,970
data from a scraping platform

541
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:19,370
called apify that lets you scrape

542
00:14:19,429 --> 00:14:19,610
data

543
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:21,720
i'm just giving you an example

544
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:23,970
here and it captures it into a

545
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:28,070
spreadsheet then maybe there's

546
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:28,639
another

547
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:30,679
automation that watches when the

548
00:14:30,919 --> 00:14:32,080
new data is added and that

549
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:34,480
automation just goes and enriches

550
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,279
it based

551
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,720
on researching that person's

552
00:14:37,129 --> 00:14:38,029
website so that's emails or

553
00:14:38,039 --> 00:14:40,860
something as opposed to building

554
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:41,840
that all into

555
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:43,470
one automation where like it

556
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,279
stripes it then it captures it and

557
00:14:45,549 --> 00:14:48,000
then it enriches it um it just

558
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:48,809
creates complexity

559
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,860
and creates more risk and becomes

560
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:52,629
harder to fix in the future the

561
00:14:52,629 --> 00:14:54,320
more things you add so try to

562
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:54,470
build

563
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:55,919
your automations in small

564
00:14:55,919 --> 00:14:58,820
bite-sized pieces and then test

565
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:03,759
edge cases so empty input fields

566
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:04,159
like what

567
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,649
happens if we miss this data is it

568
00:15:05,649 --> 00:15:07,279
going to break all these different

569
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:08,639
things make sure use error

570
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:09,029
handling

571
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,789
and again in all those videos um

572
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:12,429
it'll show you on how to actually

573
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,159
handle all these different

574
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,279
situations

575
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,769
this is just high level what you

576
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,399
should be thinking about as you're

577
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,870
testing the automations so

578
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:23,990
once you're done building again on

579
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:26,950
the idea of this is all intangible

580
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:28,480
the client can't touch and feel

581
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:28,960
this

582
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:30,960
you need to make it touchy-feely

583
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,960
so how do you make it touchy-feely

584
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,960
you document and demo the build

585
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:36,549
once it's done you create a loom

586
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:38,080
video very similar to what i'm

587
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:39,600
doing here and you just talk

588
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,480
through okay

589
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:43,230
mr customer here's the automation

590
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:45,620
this is the steps it follows all

591
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:47,210
this stuff and if this breaks we

592
00:15:47,269 --> 00:15:47,360
have

593
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,230
this error handling route here and

594
00:15:49,259 --> 00:15:50,539
this is gonna um send you a

595
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:52,279
notification that the process

596
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:52,960
didn't work

597
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,289
um and just explain all the

598
00:15:54,289 --> 00:15:55,899
different decisions you made and

599
00:15:55,899 --> 00:15:59,919
all that stuff other pro tip is if

600
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:00,799
you go to

601
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:08,580
um the the uh json sorry brain

602
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:10,429
fart um you can export the json

603
00:16:10,429 --> 00:16:11,919
which is like just like the

604
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:12,639
instructions of

605
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,059
the automation so if you come to

606
00:16:14,059 --> 00:16:15,580
make.com i'm just gonna find an

607
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:17,779
automation here so here's an

608
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,240
example

609
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:20,799
of automation where it's done in

610
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:23,210
two steps so like step one was a

611
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:25,279
new submission is generated so

612
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:25,679
triggers a

613
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:27,679
webhook and it goes and makes a

614
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,850
mock-up image for some clothing

615
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:32,240
this is exemplated for a prospect

616
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,279
and then once it's done it'll

617
00:16:34,649 --> 00:16:36,460
trigger another webhook and then

618
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:37,519
that'll capture it update the

619
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:37,840
record

620
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:39,450
send an email to the client and

621
00:16:39,639 --> 00:16:40,919
say hey your mock-up for the

622
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:42,730
clothing is done with your logo on

623
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:42,960
it

624
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:44,830
um so this is an example of an

625
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:46,889
automation that's done in two

626
00:16:46,889 --> 00:16:48,539
steps so as opposed to like

627
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:52,720
connecting this part all to here

628
00:16:52,809 --> 00:16:55,169
um it just adds complexity right

629
00:16:55,169 --> 00:16:57,279
so it's better to have it in two

630
00:16:57,370 --> 00:16:59,309
separate automations now i

631
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:01,769
explained to you what this did at

632
00:17:01,779 --> 00:17:04,240
a high level but what you can do

633
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:04,400
is you

634
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,380
can click here and click export

635
00:17:06,809 --> 00:17:08,578
blueprint and what that's going to

636
00:17:08,578 --> 00:17:13,039
do is enable you to actually put

637
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:13,279
this

638
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:16,559
this in something like claude so

639
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:23,960
um if we put in claude and we're

640
00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:27,680
just going to hit upload file

641
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,609
and just say give me a explanation

642
00:17:35,609 --> 00:17:39,380
of this automation that i can use

643
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:40,470
as like turnover

644
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,400
documentation for my client

645
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:48,650
and it'll say what this actually

646
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:54,019
does and what each step does

647
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,490
and you can take this and copy

648
00:17:58,569 --> 00:18:00,920
this into a word document and

649
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,720
paste it or into a google doc

650
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:02,890
whatever

651
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:04,970
the case may be paste it save it

652
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:07,440
as a pdf it explains everything

653
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,079
accordingly and what it does

654
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,119
that's just an example of using

655
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:15,119
the ai put that in a template to

656
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:16,809
tailor it exactly how you want it

657
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,440
add your own letterhead of like

658
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:20,660
documentation and then be like

659
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:23,359
okay customer here is the complete

660
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,569
package you've got a loom we've

661
00:18:24,569 --> 00:18:26,339
got documentation and they can

662
00:18:26,339 --> 00:18:28,339
reference it later the ai is

663
00:18:28,339 --> 00:18:28,720
pretty

664
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:30,400
good here doing this but make sure

665
00:18:30,579 --> 00:18:32,109
you also add some like information

666
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:34,000
manually yourself in case it

667
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:34,319
misses

668
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,710
anything and then throughout this

669
00:18:36,809 --> 00:18:38,809
whole process while you're

670
00:18:38,809 --> 00:18:41,119
building the automation you want

671
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:41,359
to make

672
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,990
sure that you are communicating

673
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:46,480
regularly again i'm gonna beat

674
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,599
this to death but like clients

675
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:49,119
can't see

676
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,740
progress the way they could like a

677
00:18:51,019 --> 00:18:52,490
physical product you're building a

678
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:54,160
house if you're like i'm 50

679
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:54,480
building

680
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:55,890
the house they can actually see

681
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:57,369
that visually like they can't do

682
00:18:57,369 --> 00:18:58,880
that with this so you want to make

683
00:18:58,960 --> 00:18:59,900
sure that you keep on with the

684
00:19:00,069 --> 00:19:01,059
date while you want to include in

685
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:02,279
those updates you want to tell

686
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:02,329
them

687
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,150
what's been done what's happening

688
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,809
now what's happening next and when

689
00:19:05,809 --> 00:19:07,200
to expect the next update

690
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:09,140
and you want to try to do minimum

691
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:11,170
two updates a week probably when

692
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:12,559
you're starting out

693
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,450
or if you guys agree upon a

694
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,019
different cadence that onboarding

695
00:19:16,019 --> 00:19:17,759
call then do it not cadence

696
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:18,900
and then if there's any

697
00:19:19,569 --> 00:19:20,589
emergencies or issues immediate

698
00:19:20,589 --> 00:19:22,880
notification try to fix problems

699
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:23,119
at a

700
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,170
time then tell the client as

701
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,160
opposed to telling the client

702
00:19:25,529 --> 00:19:26,519
something's broken and then be

703
00:19:26,539 --> 00:19:27,039
like oh

704
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:28,559
we could be like okay like

705
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:30,799
something broke because xyz

706
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:33,759
someone put an image into a text

707
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:34,400
field and it

708
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,109
broke everything you can be like

709
00:19:36,299 --> 00:19:37,789
hey someone did this and it broke

710
00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:39,759
the automation but i fixed it just

711
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:40,619
wanted to let you know let the

712
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:41,599
team know kind of thing

713
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:45,619
and then expansion revenue so

714
00:19:45,619 --> 00:19:49,450
after you've successfully done

715
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:51,079
your first project what can

716
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,869
you do you can continue with

717
00:19:53,019 --> 00:19:55,119
either doing fixed price projects

718
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:57,599
so they're easier to price with

719
00:19:57,599 --> 00:19:57,849
proper

720
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,309
discovery if you know exactly what

721
00:19:59,309 --> 00:20:00,789
you're going to be building they

722
00:20:00,789 --> 00:20:02,720
have lower risk of over delivery

723
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:04,319
they can be systemized and resold

724
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:05,680
so you can go back into that

725
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,880
middle column that we talked about

726
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,799
earlier which is that like product

727
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:10,650
high service um so basically this

728
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:12,319
is like getting paid to build

729
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,089
products which is pretty cool one

730
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:15,640
of the cons though is it's less

731
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,440
predictable sometimes the system

732
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,259
can't be resold like it's very

733
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,039
specific um or like there's like

734
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:23,190
annda or something like that right

735
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:25,240
they won't let you resell it so be

736
00:20:25,609 --> 00:20:27,690
aware of that and requires ongoing

737
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:29,599
sales efforts you sell one and

738
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,140
done and there's no more revenue

739
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:32,500
per client so you need to sell

740
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,400
them more more and more things

741
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:34,740
which makes

742
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,559
your cash flow pretty lumpy and

743
00:20:36,779 --> 00:20:38,319
yeah your relationship could end

744
00:20:38,589 --> 00:20:40,460
after that and then the other

745
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,119
option is

746
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,680
monthly retainers so this is

747
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,390
you're gonna have predictable

748
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:46,250
monthly revenue you're gonna get

749
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,029
basically become a partner in the

750
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,720
business as opposed to just like a

751
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,839
vendor or like a transaction

752
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:53,440
relationship you're gonna get an

753
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:55,170
opportunity for strategic input so

754
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:56,759
you can charge more typically for

755
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,680
this if you're also product

756
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,980
writing strategy low over client

757
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:03,200
acquisition costs once you've

758
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,000
acquired a

759
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:05,500
client you no longer have to go

760
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,059
get them again you can just keep

761
00:21:07,059 --> 00:21:10,160
selling so the ltv to cac ratio is

762
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,940
really good and then the cons it's

763
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:15,960
difficult to scope accurately high

764
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,880
risk over delivery challenging to

765
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:19,119
price

766
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,880
correctly requires very strong

767
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:22,519
boundaries which most new business

768
00:21:22,829 --> 00:21:24,559
owners really struggle to do

769
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,779
and it's more complex to manage

770
00:21:25,779 --> 00:21:27,150
multiple clients because you want

771
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:28,480
to make sure you're giving them

772
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:30,519
all value all at the same time so

773
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:33,849
yeah either approach works you can

774
00:21:33,849 --> 00:21:35,680
keep reselling fixed price

775
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,160
projects

776
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,980
until you know you've earned the

777
00:21:38,059 --> 00:21:39,809
trust and the right's probably a

778
00:21:39,869 --> 00:21:41,299
bad word here the trust to

779
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:41,750
transition

780
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,960
retainers start with what you can

781
00:21:44,329 --> 00:21:46,720
confidently deliver on so recap

782
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,920
here what is the full delivery

783
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,309
workflow

784
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,430
understand the client's needs

785
00:21:52,809 --> 00:21:54,880
assess fit and gather initial

786
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,640
requirements on the sales call you

787
00:21:57,710 --> 00:21:57,839
know if

788
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,730
you need to audit them you do that

789
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:01,690
then you have a closing call where

790
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:04,240
you get a contract then you do an

791
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:05,829
onboarding call once things are in

792
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:08,369
place map their process get

793
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:11,440
approval build it test it demo and

794
00:22:11,529 --> 00:22:14,210
document handoff and then upsell

795
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:17,359
or go find some more clients so

796
00:22:17,359 --> 00:22:20,559
yeah every step in the process is

797
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:20,789
key

798
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,339
to protect your time and

799
00:22:23,109 --> 00:22:24,490
reputation don't skip mapping or

800
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:26,390
testing you'll almost always

801
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:28,690
regret it and

802
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:30,210
you're going to set yourself up

803
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:31,579
for scope creep which is a big

804
00:22:31,579 --> 00:22:34,710
problem so yeah that is in summary

805
00:22:34,819 --> 00:22:34,880
how

806
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,740
how to deliver a automation

807
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:37,480
service.
