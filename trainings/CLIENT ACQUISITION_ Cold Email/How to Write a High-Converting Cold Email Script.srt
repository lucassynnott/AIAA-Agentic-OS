1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:01,419
Okay, let's dive in.

2
00:00:01,419 --> 00:00:02,580
So in this video, I'm going to

3
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:04,379
show you how to number one, create

4
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:06,530
a good offer for cold outreach and

5
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:08,699
number two, pitch that offer in an

6
00:00:08,779 --> 00:00:09,759
email or a DM that

7
00:00:09,779 --> 00:00:11,310
gets people interested in learning

8
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:12,410
more about what you do.

9
00:00:12,449 --> 00:00:15,150
So up to this point, you've seen

10
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:17,519
Daniel's videos on offer creation.

11
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:19,469
Keep what he said in mind when you

12
00:00:19,469 --> 00:00:20,780
watch these videos

13
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:22,980
because the idea of an offer,

14
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:23,679
right?

15
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:26,929
30 calls a month, 10K in revenue,

16
00:00:26,929 --> 00:00:29,059
10 new podcast appearances,

17
00:00:29,899 --> 00:00:31,879
100,000 followers on LinkedIn,

18
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:33,659
whatever the offer is, is great.

19
00:00:33,729 --> 00:00:34,899
But I also want to show

20
00:00:34,899 --> 00:00:37,369
you how to create an offer around

21
00:00:37,369 --> 00:00:39,670
a lead magnet or a free piece of

22
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:41,439
work or a service delivery

23
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:42,950
that will get people interested in

24
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:44,289
hearing what you have to say.

25
00:00:44,289 --> 00:00:45,289
Even if you're a brand

26
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,539
new business owner, even if you

27
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,859
have no past experience and you

28
00:00:47,869 --> 00:00:49,219
have no case studies, because

29
00:00:49,259 --> 00:00:50,560
if you're watching this, once

30
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,960
again, that's probably the case

31
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:52,460
for you.

32
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:52,960
So I'm going to

33
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,500
show you how to get around the

34
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:55,979
fact that you're a complete

35
00:00:55,979 --> 00:00:57,619
beginner and have, you know,

36
00:00:57,689 --> 00:00:58,329
basically

37
00:00:58,340 --> 00:00:59,439
build trust with established

38
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:00,560
business owners, even though

39
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,380
you're brand new to the business

40
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:03,060
world, right?

41
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:05,450
So here is how I am going to, you

42
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:07,540
know, basically break this down.

43
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:07,760
I'm going

44
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:09,989
to do, I'm going to write a cold

45
00:01:09,989 --> 00:01:12,180
email and a cold outreach script

46
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:13,890
for every single offer

47
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,319
in here one by one, and I'll break

48
00:01:15,319 --> 00:01:15,780
it down.

49
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:16,859
So if you want to go to your

50
00:01:16,859 --> 00:01:17,680
specific agency

51
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,349
path, feel free to skip ahead in

52
00:01:19,349 --> 00:01:20,099
this video.

53
00:01:20,099 --> 00:01:21,719
If you want to just consume this

54
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:22,519
entire video

55
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:23,959
and learn the process of writing

56
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:25,329
cold outreach, which I would

57
00:01:25,329 --> 00:01:27,120
highly recommend, please just

58
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,060
sit down, put this on 1.5 X speed

59
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:30,469
and watch me go through every

60
00:01:30,469 --> 00:01:31,680
single agency path.

61
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:31,780
So

62
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,060
you can get a feel for the process

63
00:01:33,109 --> 00:01:34,430
that I follow because it's pretty

64
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:35,519
much the same thing every

65
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:37,560
time, but just different, um, you

66
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,280
know, circumstances based on

67
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,560
what's being sold.

68
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,519
So let's dive in first ads and

69
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:43,909
funnels, right?

70
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:46,439
You are selling somebody, um, on

71
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:47,439
Facebook ads,

72
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:49,140
funnel creation, the whole nine

73
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,709
yards of generating leads with

74
00:01:50,709 --> 00:01:51,879
paid advertising.

75
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:53,019
Um, so what are

76
00:01:53,019 --> 00:01:56,129
some of the potential lead magnets

77
00:01:56,129 --> 00:01:58,390
that I can create here?

78
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:00,450
Potential offers lead magnets,

79
00:02:00,459 --> 00:02:00,939
right?

80
00:02:01,069 --> 00:02:02,329
What can I possibly pitch to

81
00:02:02,329 --> 00:02:04,090
somebody to get them interested in

82
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:05,120
hearing what I have

83
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:05,700
to say?

84
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:08,099
Well, sample ad creatives, right?

85
00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:09,439
What does this mean?

86
00:02:09,508 --> 00:02:11,120
You can reach out to a business

87
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,409
owner and say, Hey, I can create,

88
00:02:13,409 --> 00:02:15,599
um, you know, five ad scripts for

89
00:02:15,659 --> 00:02:16,090
you.

90
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:17,599
Let's do ad scripts,

91
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:18,360
right?

92
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,750
Sample ad scripts, sample ad

93
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,560
creatives, right?

94
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:28,919
Um, add templates, a free funnel

95
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:30,300
build

96
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:30,819
out.

97
00:02:30,909 --> 00:02:33,159
Um, and let's just keep it right

98
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:33,849
there.

99
00:02:33,849 --> 00:02:36,110
Let's keep it simple for now.

100
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:37,360
Basically what

101
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,780
I'm doing is picking out

102
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,650
bite-sized services that I can

103
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:42,729
offer to a business owner for free

104
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:44,659
to get them to say yes and trust

105
00:02:44,659 --> 00:02:46,639
me and let me, you know, prove

106
00:02:46,729 --> 00:02:48,400
myself as a service provider.

107
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,270
And in this case, an ad and funnel

108
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:52,199
marketer, um, to then get them on

109
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:53,610
the phone, you know,

110
00:02:53,659 --> 00:02:55,080
to sell them on my services.

111
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,599
So what would this look like?

112
00:02:56,599 --> 00:03:01,620
I created a, you know, a swipe

113
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:02,020
file

114
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:06,500
of five high converting ad scripts

115
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,210
for you to take a look at using

116
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:13,969
the, um, you know, case studies

117
00:03:13,979 --> 00:03:17,159
on your website in the actual ad

118
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:18,020
body.

119
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:21,199
Mind if I share the file with you

120
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:23,259
here or the scripts

121
00:03:23,259 --> 00:03:25,699
with you here, this is a cold

122
00:03:25,699 --> 00:03:27,530
outreach message.

123
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:30,539
You could use this two line thing,

124
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:31,460
this two line

125
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,319
script right here and go DM it to

126
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:35,360
30 people and cold email it to a

127
00:03:35,449 --> 00:03:36,669
thousand people.

128
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:37,379
And I would

129
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:38,680
like to bet that you would get

130
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,139
somebody to raise their hand and

131
00:03:40,139 --> 00:03:41,620
say, yes, I want to learn more.

132
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:42,060
Why?

133
00:03:42,229 --> 00:03:43,919
Because you're offering free

134
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:45,860
services upfront to a business

135
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:46,500
owner.

136
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,099
You're not asking for anything

137
00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:48,699
in return.

138
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:50,050
And all they have to do is say,

139
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:51,419
yeah, I'll take a script that

140
00:03:51,419 --> 00:03:52,659
gives you the green light

141
00:03:52,659 --> 00:03:54,099
to go out and create five really

142
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,009
good ad scripts.

143
00:03:55,009 --> 00:03:56,340
It doesn't have to be five.

144
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,110
It can be three

145
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,849
ad scripts for a business owner,

146
00:03:58,849 --> 00:04:00,629
um, to get them interested in what

147
00:04:00,629 --> 00:04:01,780
you sell, right?

148
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:03,939
Key thing to note when I'm

149
00:04:03,939 --> 00:04:06,830
pitching this lead magnet, a free

150
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:09,939
service delivery is called a lead

151
00:04:09,939 --> 00:04:11,349
magnet in the marketing world.

152
00:04:11,349 --> 00:04:12,699
Um, just like when you walk into

153
00:04:12,699 --> 00:04:14,039
Costco and they offer you a free

154
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:15,620
sample, that's a lead magnet.

155
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,360
Um, you don't have to pitch three.

156
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,079
You could pitch

157
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:18,389
five.

158
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,319
You could pitch 10.

159
00:04:19,379 --> 00:04:20,060
There's no rules.

160
00:04:20,129 --> 00:04:21,399
You could pitch one if you want.

161
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:22,000
I just like to do

162
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,420
five or three because they're

163
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,269
clean numbers.

164
00:04:24,269 --> 00:04:28,579
Um, the key thing to note here is

165
00:04:28,579 --> 00:04:30,420
the ad scripts are

166
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:31,420
not written yet.

167
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:32,790
You don't have to go out and

168
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:34,560
create the five ad scripts for the

169
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,300
entire list

170
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,879
of leads in your campaign.

171
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:38,720
You can just send this message out

172
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,509
to as many people as you want.

173
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:40,680
And then

174
00:04:40,779 --> 00:04:42,550
whoever answers you, then you go

175
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:44,250
out and create the ad scripts for

176
00:04:44,259 --> 00:04:45,990
those specific people that have

177
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,699
showed interest in what you're

178
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:48,649
pitching them.

179
00:04:48,649 --> 00:04:49,160
Right.

180
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,110
Um, so that's a sample ad scripts,

181
00:04:51,139 --> 00:04:51,759
lead magnet

182
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,800
ad creatives, which is like the

183
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,769
video, um, or the static ad,

184
00:04:55,769 --> 00:04:56,379
right?

185
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:58,019
What you actually see on the

186
00:04:58,709 --> 00:04:59,800
Facebook feed.

187
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,579
Um, I created five sample.

188
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:05,769
Let's just say I made, I made five

189
00:05:05,769 --> 00:05:07,850
sample ad creatives

190
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:12,019
for you, um, using the graphics

191
00:05:12,019 --> 00:05:16,199
and testimonials on your site as a

192
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:17,379
guide.

193
00:05:17,379 --> 00:05:20,300
Um, mind if I share the

194
00:05:21,009 --> 00:05:23,899
creatives here so you can test

195
00:05:23,899 --> 00:05:26,629
them out on Facebook.

196
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,680
Same.

197
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,379
It's like the, the formula is very

198
00:05:31,389 --> 00:05:31,730
simple.

199
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,620
Once you have the lead magnet in

200
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:35,860
mind, you just say, Hey, I created

201
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:38,860
a list of scripts, a sample ad

202
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:40,670
creative, an ad template, a free

203
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:41,930
landing page funnel.

204
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:43,620
And then you just ask if they want

205
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:44,019
to see

206
00:05:44,019 --> 00:05:44,269
it.

207
00:05:44,269 --> 00:05:45,509
And that's really all it comes

208
00:05:45,509 --> 00:05:46,870
down to with cold outreach to get

209
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:47,910
somebody interested.

210
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,279
I'll go

211
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:49,589
into some examples in a later

212
00:05:49,589 --> 00:05:51,060
video, but this is all it really

213
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,129
takes to get good at cold

214
00:05:52,149 --> 00:05:52,839
outreach.

215
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:54,050
And you're probably watching this.

216
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:55,800
Like, is this dude for real?

217
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,100
I thought I have to use

218
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,720
like the, the pain point framework

219
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,949
and the, the storytelling

220
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:01,550
framework and all this other stuff

221
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,779
I see online to get people

222
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:03,610
interested.

223
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:05,290
The best outreach messages in the

224
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:06,610
world are extremely short

225
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,100
and to the point, like two

226
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,089
sentences max.

227
00:06:09,089 --> 00:06:10,850
So what you're seeing in front of

228
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:12,800
you, these two sentence

229
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:15,430
scripts are what work the best in

230
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:18,009
the market based on thousands of

231
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:19,899
emails that I've sent over

232
00:06:19,899 --> 00:06:21,509
the past couple of years.

233
00:06:21,509 --> 00:06:23,540
It's crazy to believe, but this is

234
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:24,779
the case, right?

235
00:06:24,779 --> 00:06:26,899
So all of these,

236
00:06:26,899 --> 00:06:28,319
if you're, if you're following

237
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:29,680
this agency path with, which I

238
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,079
would say a lot of you probably

239
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:31,439
are,

240
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:33,110
basically you can test all of

241
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:34,699
these and see which one does

242
00:06:34,699 --> 00:06:35,339
better.

243
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:37,120
And then just offer it over and

244
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,480
over and over and over again,

245
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,839
until you have a client, five

246
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:41,680
clients, 10 clients, right?

247
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,490
At,

248
00:06:42,579 --> 00:06:44,819
you know, add templates.

249
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:47,629
Hey, I put together, um, a library

250
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,879
of ad templates that you can,

251
00:06:49,899 --> 00:06:53,310
use, um, on, I don't actually like

252
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:56,060
add templates that much at all

253
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:58,579
because you can't make it specific

254
00:06:58,579 --> 00:06:59,569
to their business.

255
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:01,399
So honestly, one of these three,

256
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:03,060
um, lead magnets is going to work

257
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:03,629
the best

258
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:06,639
for ads and funnels.

259
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:10,589
I put together, um, a sample

260
00:07:10,589 --> 00:07:14,980
funnel for you, um, with, with

261
00:07:15,329 --> 00:07:17,779
your case studies and

262
00:07:18,389 --> 00:07:23,149
testimonials listed out on the

263
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:24,779
page.

264
00:07:24,779 --> 00:07:29,000
I guarantee this funnel

265
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:36,199
out converts your existing website

266
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:38,939
in terms of books, calls and

267
00:07:39,009 --> 00:07:43,279
conversions or in close deals.

268
00:07:43,889 --> 00:07:46,910
Mind if I share a quick video

269
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:52,000
breaking down the funnel for you?

270
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,500
Mind if I send over a link to the

271
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,209
funnel and a quick video breaking

272
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:01,980
it down

273
00:08:02,589 --> 00:08:03,939
for you?

274
00:08:04,009 --> 00:08:04,439
Boom.

275
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:04,860
Right.

276
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,810
There are, you just in probably

277
00:08:07,819 --> 00:08:09,540
seven minutes, you watch me come

278
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:09,879
up with

279
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:12,379
three separate lead magnet scripts

280
00:08:12,389 --> 00:08:14,290
that you can go out and use on

281
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:17,680
Instagram DMS on LinkedIn, um,

282
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,360
over cold email.

283
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,879
Um, and it really is that simple.

284
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:23,360
Why am I starting here?

285
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,629
Because I want to get you

286
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:27,060
in the mindset of, okay, how do I

287
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:29,459
offer some sort of upfront value

288
00:08:29,459 --> 00:08:31,610
to a business owner to get them to

289
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:33,100
say yes to what I'm trying to

290
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,250
offer them and get the

291
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:35,658
conversation started all

292
00:08:35,658 --> 00:08:36,820
throughout the rest of

293
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:37,500
these videos.

294
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:38,779
I will show you how to actually

295
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:40,168
lead this conversation towards a

296
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:41,139
sales call and a closed

297
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:41,620
deal.

298
00:08:41,788 --> 00:08:43,379
But for right now on this video,

299
00:08:43,379 --> 00:08:45,029
the only goal that we have, you

300
00:08:45,059 --> 00:08:46,759
and I, the only goal that we're

301
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:48,120
striving towards is getting

302
00:08:48,129 --> 00:08:49,559
someone to raise their hand to

303
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:51,419
your message and say, yes, please.

304
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:51,970
I want to

305
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:52,549
learn more.

306
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:52,980
That's it.

307
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:54,139
That's the only thing we're

308
00:08:54,139 --> 00:08:55,240
worried about right now.

309
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,919
Um, now actually I lied.

310
00:08:57,919 --> 00:08:59,379
We can do a video audit.

311
00:08:59,389 --> 00:09:01,000
So when I'm using, when I'm

312
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,820
writing, uh, scripts for any

313
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:03,919
offer, I either go

314
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:05,429
down one of two paths.

315
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:07,269
I either pitch a free service

316
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,299
delivery, like an ad script or an

317
00:09:09,419 --> 00:09:10,870
ad creative or a

318
00:09:10,899 --> 00:09:12,639
funnel, or I pitch some kind of

319
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:13,179
video.

320
00:09:13,179 --> 00:09:14,509
What do I mean by that?

321
00:09:14,509 --> 00:09:16,240
Here's what I mean by that.

322
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:23,399
Hey Christian, I was checking out

323
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:26,470
your website and I noticed a few

324
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:27,259
things

325
00:09:27,889 --> 00:09:34,879
with your landing page that may be

326
00:09:34,899 --> 00:09:38,580
costing you conversions from

327
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:43,519
actually, okay.

328
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,330
So this isn't the case of you're

329
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,980
building them a funnel.

330
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:49,379
I recorded a quick video

331
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:51,850
video breaking down the causes and

332
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:54,200
how to fix them.

333
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,559
Mind if I share the video here.

334
00:09:57,559 --> 00:09:59,879
So what is this?

335
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:01,409
I'm basically critiquing their

336
00:10:01,429 --> 00:10:02,480
existing website.

337
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,240
And then once they say, yes, I'll

338
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:04,500
see the

339
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:04,860
video.

340
00:10:05,049 --> 00:10:05,940
That is when you pull up their

341
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,429
website.

342
00:10:06,429 --> 00:10:07,850
Like, let's say I'm critiquing,

343
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,879
let's say I'm critiquing

344
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:10,340
list kit.

345
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:11,100
Um,

346
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:14,110
and I'm a co-founder at list kit.

347
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:16,549
So let's say I responded to this

348
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:17,580
message.

349
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,580
Oh, Hey Tom, that sounds good.

350
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:20,580
Like I'll take a video.

351
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,149
You would come in here, fire up a

352
00:10:22,149 --> 00:10:24,059
video going over my website and

353
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,519
then show them the

354
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:26,740
sample funnel that you built out

355
00:10:26,789 --> 00:10:28,139
for them and say, Hey, instead of

356
00:10:28,139 --> 00:10:29,580
using your website to generate or

357
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:30,570
drive

358
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:32,779
leads from your ad campaigns, you

359
00:10:32,779 --> 00:10:34,580
can use this funnel instead.

360
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:35,070
Right?

361
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:35,789
My camera just died.

362
00:10:35,879 --> 00:10:36,580
Give me a second.

363
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:37,039
Okay.

364
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:38,879
My camera just died mid video.

365
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:40,480
Um, but what I was saying is

366
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:43,100
you're basically picture this as

367
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:43,320
like

368
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,019
you're throwing out a fishing line

369
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:46,120
with some bait on it.

370
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,539
And all you want is a person to

371
00:10:47,539 --> 00:10:48,259
bite the bait

372
00:10:48,259 --> 00:10:49,450
and take the bait and say, yes,

373
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:50,149
I'll learn more.

374
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,110
And then you can figure out

375
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,480
everything after, right?

376
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:54,820
Um, basically getting them to say

377
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:55,919
yes and then opening a

378
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:57,519
conversation and then you can

379
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:57,779
actually

380
00:10:57,779 --> 00:10:59,649
go out and fulfill, make a, make a

381
00:10:59,649 --> 00:11:01,460
funnel for them, make a video for

382
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:02,990
them and get them to be like, wow,

383
00:11:03,059 --> 00:11:04,169
this is really interesting.

384
00:11:04,169 --> 00:11:05,220
Let's hop on a call so you can,

385
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,100
you know, sell me on your

386
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:06,679
services.

387
00:11:07,289 --> 00:11:09,299
Hopefully that all makes sense.

388
00:11:09,299 --> 00:11:11,889
Um, now on the flip side, instead

389
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:13,960
of pitching a lead magnet,

390
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,190
we can just go right for the

391
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:15,590
offer.

392
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:17,019
Like Daniel has been preaching to

393
00:11:17,019 --> 00:11:17,840
you guys earlier

394
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:21,009
in this program, direct offer

395
00:11:21,009 --> 00:11:22,470
templates.

396
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:25,120
Instead of going for a lead

397
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:27,919
magnet, um, you can just go for a

398
00:11:27,929 --> 00:11:30,500
direct offer, something that looks

399
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,399
like this.

400
00:11:31,409 --> 00:11:34,049
Hey, Christian, um, saw you're the

401
00:11:34,049 --> 00:11:35,940
founder at list kit.

402
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:41,399
We can generate you 15 new clients

403
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:46,279
in the next 60 days with a, um,

404
00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:51,379
Facebook ad campaign guaranteed,

405
00:11:51,379 --> 00:11:52,860
or you do not pay.

406
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:55,269
This is the classic straight to

407
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,799
the point offer that Daniel has

408
00:11:57,799 --> 00:11:58,139
been preaching

409
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,200
to you guys.

410
00:11:59,289 --> 00:12:05,110
Um, you don't need to manage or

411
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:10,059
you'll have everything set up for

412
00:12:10,059 --> 00:12:11,080
you.

413
00:12:11,139 --> 00:12:11,639
Um,

414
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:17,629
ad creatives, meta ads, manager, a

415
00:12:17,629 --> 00:12:22,519
funnel page, tracking pixel,

416
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,679
ETC.

417
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:27,470
You just take calls with the

418
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:28,440
leads.

419
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,169
We from

420
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:36,000
We book from the ads mind.

421
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:39,159
If I share a quick video, um,

422
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:42,159
going over and add strategy I had

423
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,559
in mind for you, right?

424
00:12:44,629 --> 00:12:45,639
So what am I doing here?

425
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:46,500
Instead of pitching

426
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,710
a free deliverable ad creative

427
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:52,610
funnel ad script, I'm pitching my

428
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:54,919
services directly using the offer

429
00:12:54,919 --> 00:12:56,409
framework that Daniel has taught

430
00:12:56,409 --> 00:12:58,429
you previously in this program, 15

431
00:12:58,429 --> 00:13:00,129
new clients in the next 60 days

432
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,399
guaranteed, or you do not pay.

433
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:03,480
You get everything set up for you.

434
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,000
Ad creatives, meta ads manager,

435
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,559
a funnel page tracking pixel.

436
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:07,990
You just take the calls we book

437
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:08,899
from the ads.

438
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:10,360
Mind if I share a video

439
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,580
going over an ad strategy I had in

440
00:13:11,629 --> 00:13:12,679
mind for you, right?

441
00:13:12,679 --> 00:13:15,740
What you guys will start to see is

442
00:13:15,799 --> 00:13:18,110
cold outreach is basically like a

443
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:18,919
puzzle.

444
00:13:18,919 --> 00:13:20,200
Like this is a puzzle piece.

445
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,960
This is a puzzle piece.

446
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,159
And this is a puzzle piece.

447
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:25,610
You can just plug and play

448
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:27,370
different things until you find a

449
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:28,519
winning piece of copy.

450
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:30,269
Cause like you could test this out

451
00:13:30,269 --> 00:13:31,950
and it could get zero responses

452
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:32,840
and you have to test something

453
00:13:32,909 --> 00:13:33,159
new.

454
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:35,230
All you have to do is plug and

455
00:13:35,269 --> 00:13:36,519
play a different puzzle piece.

456
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:38,519
Like let's say this, let's say

457
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:38,909
this

458
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:40,070
message isn't working at all.

459
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:40,960
Like it's not getting any

460
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:41,480
responses.

461
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,679
You're not hearing back from

462
00:13:42,679 --> 00:13:43,549
anybody.

463
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:45,519
You can just take these puzzle

464
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:47,740
pieces out and plug in this puzzle

465
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:48,200
piece.

466
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,500
Mind if I share a quick video

467
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:54,120
going over the ad creatives I had

468
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,759
made up for you, right?

469
00:13:56,759 --> 00:13:58,840
So literally by deleting one

470
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,570
sentence and changing the call to

471
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:02,919
action here, I now have a new

472
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:04,879
message that I can go pitch to

473
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:05,720
people.

474
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,120
So like

475
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:09,799
The main puzzle pieces of cold

476
00:14:09,799 --> 00:14:10,590
outreach are

477
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,840
What am I offering?

478
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,720
Is it a lead magnet?

479
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,500
Is it a video?

480
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:15,960
Is it a direct offer?

481
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,240
And then how am I pitching it?

482
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,000
Am I pitching a video?

483
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,519
Am I pitching a link to a funnel?

484
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:21,049
Am I pitching

485
00:14:21,879 --> 00:14:22,639
the scripts?

486
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:24,250
Like what am I actually offering

487
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:25,779
as the next step that somebody can

488
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:26,679
say yes or no to

489
00:14:26,679 --> 00:14:28,970
to get them interested in what I

490
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:30,330
have to offer?

491
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:33,129
Notice how it's never a statement

492
00:14:33,129 --> 00:14:34,039
at the end.

493
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,399
Every email that you ever send

494
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:36,419
should end in a yes or no

495
00:14:36,419 --> 00:14:36,919
question.

496
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:38,879
Mind if I send this over?

497
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:40,360
Would you be open to seeing this?

498
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:43,980
Interested in checking out a quick

499
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,519
video going over an ad strategy I

500
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:46,440
had in mind for you.

501
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:49,909
All of these angles no matter what

502
00:14:49,909 --> 00:14:50,840
you try are going to

503
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,799
Have a pitch at the end a yes or

504
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:53,799
no question to get people

505
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:54,389
interested.

506
00:14:54,389 --> 00:14:55,320
That's a given, right?

507
00:14:55,929 --> 00:14:59,169
Hopefully this is making sense

508
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,690
If you're worried about things

509
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:03,240
like subject lines

510
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,570
Don't worry.

511
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:05,730
They're inconsequential.

512
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:07,360
I'll break it down to you in the

513
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:07,870
next video

514
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:09,750
But i'm just trying to get you to

515
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:10,509
understand

516
00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:13,149
The mindset around cold outreach

517
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:14,799
and how to say things over email

518
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:16,350
that will get a random stranger

519
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,539
To raise their hand and say yes to

520
00:15:18,549 --> 00:15:20,750
what you're selling right email

521
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:23,080
marketing very similar service

522
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,169
Let's start with the lead magnets

523
00:15:25,179 --> 00:15:26,889
once again because I want to

524
00:15:26,929 --> 00:15:29,080
follow the same you know principle

525
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,029
for all these

526
00:15:30,649 --> 00:15:34,700
Lead magnets sample email flows

527
00:15:34,769 --> 00:15:35,799

528
00:15:35,799 --> 00:15:39,610
Um email designs a free

529
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:41,600
Email flow build out and a video

530
00:15:41,669 --> 00:15:43,669

531
00:15:43,669 --> 00:15:46,279
their existing email stack, right?

532
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,639
So let's go into each of these

533
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:53,960
Starting with sample email flows I

534
00:15:54,039 --> 00:15:57,470
created a swipe file of five

535
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:59,960

536
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:05,279

00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,859
Email marketing three different

576
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,359
lead magnets that you can use to

577
00:17:46,359 --> 00:17:47,720
go out and get people interested

578
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,240
in learning more about what you

579
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:49,460
sell

580
00:17:50,089 --> 00:17:50,519
Right

581
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:51,519
Let's say I want to do a video

582
00:17:51,609 --> 00:17:51,880
audit

583
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,599
Hey, I opted in to your email list

584
00:17:54,599 --> 00:17:56,839
and noticed a few things that are

585
00:17:56,839 --> 00:17:59,720
Likely hurting your conversions

586
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,890
with new customers

587
00:18:04,279 --> 00:18:07,259
I recorded a quick video breaking

588
00:18:07,259 --> 00:18:09,000
down the causes and how to fix

589
00:18:09,009 --> 00:18:09,319
them

590
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:13,000
Mind if I share the video here

591
00:18:13,609 --> 00:18:14,000
Okay, great

592
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:16,119
I now have four different

593
00:18:16,119 --> 00:18:17,940
variations of the same strategy

594
00:18:18,029 --> 00:18:19,420
that I can go out and test in the

595
00:18:19,539 --> 00:18:20,250
marketplace

596
00:18:20,279 --> 00:18:22,369
To get an e-commerce brand or a

597
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:24,599
software company to say okay, sure

598
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,390
I'll bite and I'll take the email

599
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:28,839
template the flow the video right

600
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:31,180
Now let's say you want to go for a

601
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,839
direct offer like daniel preaches

602
00:18:32,839 --> 00:18:33,400
instead of

603
00:18:34,039 --> 00:18:35,779
A free lead magnet we can do that,

604
00:18:35,779 --> 00:18:36,000
too

605
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:39,480
Right

606
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:42,109

00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:45,079

you don't pay me

612
00:18:59,849 --> 00:19:05,000
Your entire klaviyo

613
00:19:05,609 --> 00:19:08,430
Account will get an overhaul

614
00:19:09,049 --> 00:19:12,250
With redesigned welcome flows

615
00:19:12,279 --> 00:19:14,680
Re-engagement

616
00:19:15,289 --> 00:19:19,640
Flows and emails designed to boost

617
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,519
Your average order

618
00:19:22,519 --> 00:19:22,519
Your average order

619
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:24,029
Value

620
00:19:24,609 --> 00:19:26,670
Interested in checking out

621
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:30,109
A quick video going over

622
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:32,750
A

623
00:19:33,369 --> 00:19:36,569
Interested in checking out a quick

624
00:19:36,569 --> 00:19:38,119
video going over a

625
00:19:38,119 --> 00:19:40,680
Klaviyo or an email marketing

626
00:19:41,289 --> 00:19:44,680
Strategy I had in mind for you

627
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,809
Right, so instead of going for the

628
00:19:46,809 --> 00:19:48,230
lead magnet i'm going for a direct

629
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:48,519
offer

630
00:19:48,519 --> 00:19:49,930
Right and you can mix and match

631
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:50,839
this however you want

632
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:53,559
You can change what your guarantee

633
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:55,029
is you can change what you're

634
00:19:55,029 --> 00:19:56,039
offering like there

635
00:19:56,039 --> 00:19:58,099
To reiterate there are no rules

636
00:19:58,099 --> 00:19:59,559
with what you say in the email you

637
00:19:59,569 --> 00:20:00,700
can offer whatever you want

638
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,960
Your only concern is figuring out

639
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,240
what are the combinations of

640
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,160
sentences that are going to get

641
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,440
people to raise their hand and say

642
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:08,680
yes

643
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,599
This sounds good.

644
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:10,359
Tell me more.

645
00:20:10,359 --> 00:20:10,970
That's it.

646
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:12,180
That's all you're looking to do,

647
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:12,359
right?

648
00:20:12,359 --> 00:20:14,319
Is it going to take some patience

649
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:16,119
and some testing probably

650
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:20,180
But that is you know, this is

651
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:21,329
going to be your main focus early

652
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:22,599
on as a business owner

653
00:20:22,599 --> 00:20:24,279
Is just figuring out what you're

654
00:20:24,279 --> 00:20:25,640
saying in the emails and in the

655
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,920
dms to get people to say yes

656
00:20:28,569 --> 00:20:30,230
Right, maybe it's 50k in sales

657
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:30,970
guaranteed.

658
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:31,559
Maybe it's

659
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:35,369
You know

660
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,960
100 new customers a month.

661
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,079
I don't know what that is going to

662
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:38,750
be because i'm not

663
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:40,359
A genie you're gonna have to go

664
00:20:40,359 --> 00:20:41,839
figure that out once you launch

665
00:20:41,849 --> 00:20:42,440
your campaign

666
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,880
And i'm going to show you some

667
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,000
real world examples

668
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,960
Of each of these services in

669
00:20:47,029 --> 00:20:48,809
action with our clients

670
00:20:48,839 --> 00:20:50,319
Because we do have clients that

671
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:51,920
are getting results already from

672
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,400
cold outreach with all these

673
00:20:54,009 --> 00:20:56,109
Different services.

674
00:20:56,109 --> 00:20:56,920
Okay, so moving on

675
00:20:58,569 --> 00:20:59,930
So

676
00:21:00,569 --> 00:21:02,589
Lead generation

677
00:21:02,599 --> 00:21:03,759
If you're watching this from the

678
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:04,559
lead generation path

679
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:08,839
Please refer to the lead

680
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:12,859
Generation path in the learning

681
00:21:12,859 --> 00:21:13,640
platform

682
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,559
So if you're here from the lead

683
00:21:15,559 --> 00:21:17,720
generation path, I basically

684
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,599
already went over

685
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:21,339
Every single video in this module

686
00:21:21,339 --> 00:21:22,279
in your path

687
00:21:22,839 --> 00:21:24,799
Like everything is covered

688
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:25,640
In

689
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:28,980
I'm not going to go into it now,

690
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:30,680
but every single piece of

691
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,640
information here is already

692
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,839
covered in the lead generation

693
00:21:32,839 --> 00:21:33,160
path

694
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:35,029
Because your entire business model

695
00:21:35,029 --> 00:21:35,920
is cold outreach.

696
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,960
So you have to get really good at

697
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,059
it

698
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:39,869
So if you're watching this from

699
00:21:39,869 --> 00:21:40,359
any of the other paths

700
00:21:40,359 --> 00:21:41,819
I would also recommend checking

701
00:21:41,829 --> 00:21:43,250
out the lead generation path in

702
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:43,960
your free time

703
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:46,359
Because that's my most in-depth

704
00:21:46,359 --> 00:21:46,759
training

705
00:21:46,759 --> 00:21:48,920
With tons and tons and tons of

706
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:49,559
content

707
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:51,000
On how to get good at cold

708
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,190
outreach, right?

709
00:21:53,769 --> 00:21:55,299
So even if you're selling a ai

710
00:21:55,299 --> 00:21:56,329
automation or ads and funnels or

711
00:21:56,329 --> 00:21:56,970
email marketing

712
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,640
It's still in your best interest

713
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,910
to get really good at lead

714
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:01,319
generation as a service

715
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,720
Because that's how you're going to

716
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,769
generate leads for your own

717
00:22:03,769 --> 00:22:04,750
business, right?

718
00:22:04,759 --> 00:22:04,920
So

719
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,619
If you're here from the lead gen

720
00:22:06,619 --> 00:22:08,240
path, go watch the videos that are

721
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:08,819
in your path

722
00:22:08,839 --> 00:22:09,960
And if you're watching this from a

723
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:10,519
different path

724
00:22:11,319 --> 00:22:12,630
I would recommend still checking

725
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:13,480
out the lead gen path

726
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,410
Just because of how good it is

727
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:16,690
with the content.

728
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:16,759
So

729
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:20,519
Moving on to content

730
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:21,740
Right.

731
00:22:21,789 --> 00:22:22,940
What are your possible lead

732
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:24,279
magnets for a content business?

733
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:27,130
Pretty simple sample linkedin

734
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:27,480
posts

735
00:22:28,089 --> 00:22:31,240
Sample blogs

736
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,200
Short-form video scripts

737
00:22:33,849 --> 00:22:37,559
Social media profile audit, right?

738
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:38,779
It's the same couple of things

739
00:22:38,839 --> 00:22:40,059
over and over again just based on

740
00:22:40,069 --> 00:22:40,759
what you're selling

741
00:22:41,369 --> 00:22:43,319
So like

742
00:22:43,319 --> 00:22:46,750
I put together five sample

743
00:22:47,369 --> 00:22:49,079
LinkedIn

744
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:51,900
Posts you can use to build

745
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:52,509
authority

746
00:22:52,519 --> 00:22:55,559
on the platform and generate

747
00:22:55,559 --> 00:23:00,220
Inbound demand from your existing

748
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,559
audience

749
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,720
Mind if I share the linkedin the

750
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,200
posts with you here

751
00:23:08,809 --> 00:23:14,380
Feel free to post these on your

752
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:15,079
account

753
00:23:15,079 --> 00:23:17,720
If they look good, right?

754
00:23:18,329 --> 00:23:20,609
Actually, no, let's not say that.

755
00:23:20,609 --> 00:23:21,369
I don't want to say that.

756
00:23:21,369 --> 00:23:22,369
That just sounds like needy

757
00:23:27,559 --> 00:23:30,029
I used content from your website

758
00:23:30,029 --> 00:23:33,769
existing social posts and PR

759
00:23:33,799 --> 00:23:39,319
To write each of these posts, okay

760
00:23:39,319 --> 00:23:42,039
If you're a content agency, you

761
00:23:42,039 --> 00:23:43,930
can also write blogs.

762
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:45,480
Hey, I wrote three

763
00:23:46,089 --> 00:23:51,480
Sample blogs for your website

764
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:54,750
Going over

765
00:23:55,369 --> 00:23:56,920
Common topics in your industry

766
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:00,200
And showcasing your expertise

767
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,160
On each topic

768

00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:34,410
I was checking out your linkedin

813
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:37,039
profile and noticed a few things

814
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:37,799
that are

815
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:40,519
likely

816
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:42,680
hurting your

817
00:25:43,289 --> 00:25:48,430
Let's just say that might be

818
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:48,890
leaving

819
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,680
a bad first impression on

820
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,200
potential customers

821
00:25:54,809 --> 00:25:57,549

822
00:25:57,559 --> 00:25:59,799
Or what is the cta here?

824
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,839
Recorded a quick video breaking

825
00:26:02,839 --> 00:26:03,950

over and over again, and it works

829
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,900
All the time you don't have to

830
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,200
reinvent the wheel here

831
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,940

Up

860
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,240
For you

Okay, great.

862
00:27:12,109 --> 00:27:13,549
Let's go into ai automation then

863
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:14,119
we'll get out of here

864
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:16,680
Because this is

865
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,190
If you're still watching this,

866
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:19,210
thank you for being attentive and

867
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:19,799
paying attention

868
00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:21,730
But I want to go through every

869
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:23,650
single agency path so that you

870
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:26,359
have a winning script off the bat

871
00:27:29,079 --> 00:27:30,750
Okay, what are lead magnets for an

872
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:32,039
ai automation business?

873
00:27:32,589 --> 00:27:34,440
Sample ai flows

874
00:27:35,049 --> 00:27:41,000
Automating different

875
00:27:41,609 --> 00:27:44,119
parts of the business

876
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:47,079
And let's do a

877
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:50,119
An ai audit

878
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:52,839
Okay

879
00:27:52,839 --> 00:27:54,799
I put together

880
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:56,119
a sample

881
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,680
And I think the best way to go

882
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,240
about an ai automation lead magnet

883
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,359
is just saying like you can

884
00:28:00,359 --> 00:28:01,319
automate different parts of their

885
00:28:01,319 --> 00:28:01,799
business

886
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:03,730
I put together a sample n8n flow

887
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:05,000
that automatically

888
00:28:05,609 --> 00:28:06,279
posts

889
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:11,160
Content to each of your social

890
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:11,960
platforms

891
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:14,589
With the click of a button

892
00:28:14,599 --> 00:28:18,450
So you can distribute

893
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:20,759
content to ig tiktok

894
00:28:21,369 --> 00:28:22,920
Facebook

895
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,680
And youtube instantly

896
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:29,000
Mind if I share a video of

897
00:28:29,539 --> 00:28:30,240
The flow

898
00:28:30,890 --> 00:28:32,240
In action

899
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:34,440
So you can see how it works

900
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,500
I really just think like for ai

901
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,240
automation

902
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,119
You're just going to want to

903
00:28:38,119 --> 00:28:39,960
Take a bunch of different use

904
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:40,359
cases

905
00:28:40,359 --> 00:28:42,319
And see what people resonate with

906
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:42,829
the most

907
00:28:42,839 --> 00:28:44,920
I put together a sample n8n flow

908
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:45,799
that automatically

909
00:28:47,799 --> 00:28:49,759
You know transcribes your

910
00:28:50,410 --> 00:28:53,309
Long form video

911
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:56,829
Content and creates 10 to 15

912
00:28:57,450 --> 00:29:00,119
Content pieces

913
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:01,720
Out of it

914
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,990
Mind if I share the video the flow

915
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:04,680
in action

916
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,190
So you can see how it works like

917
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:08,480
Just figure out what kind of

918
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,859
things people want automated in

919
00:29:09,859 --> 00:29:10,440
their business

920
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,630
And that's going to be your entire

921
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:12,519
outreach strategy

922
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,079
I put together a sample n8n flow

923
00:29:15,079 --> 00:29:15,319
that

924
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:21,529
You know takes your sales call

925
00:29:21,529 --> 00:29:23,079
recordings and

926
00:29:23,079 --> 00:29:27,960
Scores the call so you know which

927
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:30,599
sales reps are performing the best

928
00:29:30,599 --> 00:29:31,099
right like

929
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,000
AI is so new and so attractive

930
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,920
that you don't really need to

931
00:29:36,569 --> 00:29:37,640
Offer

932
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,230
A swipe file of email flows or a

933
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:40,509
swipe file of this you can just

934
00:29:40,509 --> 00:29:40,839
say hey

935
00:29:40,839 --> 00:29:42,279
I put together an n8n flow that

936
00:29:42,279 --> 00:29:43,240
does this and this

937
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,460
Do you want to see a video of it

938
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:45,559
so you can see how it works?

939
00:29:45,559 --> 00:29:47,279
And then a direct pitch would be

940
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:48,190
something like

941
00:29:48,809 --> 00:29:55,619
You know we can help you save 10

942
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:56,359

On content creation by or with and

944
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:04,839
n8n flow

945
00:30:04,839 --> 00:30:07,920
That automatically posts your

946
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:10,859

947
00:30:10,859 --> 00:30:14,279

Distribute content to instagram

950
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:24,470
tiktok facebook and youtube with

951
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:26,680
the click of a button

952
00:30:28,599 --> 00:30:30,549
Mind if I share a video

953
00:30:30,599 --> 00:30:31,720
So okay

954
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:33,390
Hopefully if you watch what you're

955
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:34,920
still here from the beginning

956
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,430

958
00:30:38,329 --> 00:30:39,960

00:30:40,569 --> 00:30:44,759
Overall template is

960
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:47,720
I created

00:30:48,329 --> 00:30:49,880
X

Then i'll do an explanation

980
00:31:28,569 --> 00:31:31,000
Of the service

981
00:31:31,609 --> 00:31:34,589
You know basically a line that

982
00:31:34,589 --> 00:31:35,960
explains what the business

983
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:36,519
actually does

984
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:38,599
distribute content to instagram

985
00:31:38,599 --> 00:31:39,720
tiktok and facebook with the click

986
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,559
of a button and then cta

987
00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:43,319
video

988
00:31:43,319 --> 00:31:44,759
sharing the resource

989
00:31:44,759 --> 00:31:45,319
Etc

990
00:31:45,319 --> 00:31:45,799
Right, so

991
00:31:46,410 --> 00:31:48,680
Copywriting for cold outreach is

992
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,599
basically a template system

993
00:31:50,599 --> 00:31:51,960
Like people try to over complicate

994
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:52,200
this

995
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,710
But you can basically boil it down

996
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:55,279
to a few key pieces that you want

997
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:57,160
to reiterate in every single thing

998
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:57,960
that you ever test

999
00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:00,440

1000
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:00,680
video of lead gen in general

1001
00:32:01,289 --> 00:32:04,240

00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:05,309
taught you how to actually

1003
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:07,079
pitch

1004
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:07,960
Something

1005
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,720
In a cold outreach message email
