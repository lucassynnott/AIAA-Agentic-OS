1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:00,580
All right.

2
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:02,240
In this video or set of videos,

3
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:03,279
I'm going to be walking through

4
00:00:03,279 --> 00:00:04,040
and showing you how

5
00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:05,570
you can set up cold email accounts

6
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:06,530
through Google.

7
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:08,179
So you can actually send your cold

8
00:00:08,179 --> 00:00:08,880
email campaigns

9
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:10,080
and how to connect it through

10
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,429
SmartLead all in this kind of one

11
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:11,839
video.

12
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:12,740
So I'm going to try and

13
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:13,509
get through this as fast as

14
00:00:13,509 --> 00:00:13,900
possible.

15
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:14,880
So the first thing you're going to

16
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:15,880
want to do is actually

17
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:17,920
establish the domains you're going

18
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,519
to want to use to send the cold

19
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:20,399
emails from.

20
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:21,320
So go over to your

21
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:22,800
favorite registrar, PorkFun,

22
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,899
GoDaddy, Namecheap.

23
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:25,510
It doesn't really matter too much.

24
00:00:25,579 --> 00:00:26,280
And the settings

25
00:00:26,329 --> 00:00:27,739
are pretty much all in the same

26
00:00:27,739 --> 00:00:28,190
place.

27
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:29,660
If you want to follow along with

28
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:30,879
me, you can use PorkFun.

29
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:32,200
I'm just doing one domain for the

30
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:33,630
sake of this video because I don't

31
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:34,850
want to spend a bunch of money

32
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:36,179
because I already have a bunch of

33
00:00:36,229 --> 00:00:37,369
accounts already set up.

34
00:00:37,369 --> 00:00:38,859
But first, you're going to go and

35
00:00:38,859 --> 00:00:39,299
establish

36
00:00:39,619 --> 00:00:40,829
number one, how many accounts you

37
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:41,570
want to set up.

38
00:00:41,609 --> 00:00:42,810
And then number two, buy the

39
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:43,820
domains that correspond

40
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:44,590
with that.

41
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:46,619
So if you want to send, let's say,

42
00:00:46,619 --> 00:00:48,789
you know, 500 or so emails a day

43
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:50,380
with 20 cold email

44
00:00:50,729 --> 00:00:52,130
sends per inbox per day, that

45
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:54,289
roughly comes out to 20 or 25

46
00:00:54,299 --> 00:00:56,219
email accounts and send one

47
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:56,820
domain.

48
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,439
I like to have two inboxes per one

49
00:00:58,439 --> 00:00:58,979
domain.

50
00:00:58,979 --> 00:01:00,469
There's a lot of speculation on

51
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:00,899
it.

52
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,060
Should you have one inbox per one

53
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:03,439
domain, two inboxes, three, five,

54
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:03,899
whatever.

55
00:01:03,969 --> 00:01:05,079
I like to err

56
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:06,150
a little bit on the side of

57
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:07,069
caution and do two.

58
00:01:07,069 --> 00:01:08,409
I know some people do one, some

59
00:01:08,409 --> 00:01:09,269
people do four,

60
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:10,170
some people do five.

61
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:11,370
If you want a super simple thing

62
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:12,620
to follow along with me, you can

63
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:13,359
just do two.

64
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:14,900
And that's what I'd recommend is

65
00:01:14,989 --> 00:01:15,629
do two or one.

66
00:01:15,629 --> 00:01:17,099
I wouldn't recommend adding a

67
00:01:17,099 --> 00:01:18,000
bunch of domains

68
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:18,829
to one inbox.

69
00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:20,700
So first you're going to establish

70
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,599
how many inboxes you want set up,

71
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:23,719
then divide that by

72
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:25,400
two to figure out how many domains

73
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,909
you want, and then go ahead and

74
00:01:26,969 --> 00:01:28,079
find your domain.

75
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:29,060
So all that

76
00:01:29,069 --> 00:01:30,530
you have to do, and there should

77
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:31,829
be a video link somewhere.

78
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:33,519
And if you just Google, if you

79
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:34,030
Google

80
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:36,390
Matt Lucero, cold email domain

81
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:38,409
ideas, you should find a video

82
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,489
where I kind of explain all I'm

83
00:01:40,489 --> 00:01:40,920
doing

84
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:42,469
is basically just inserting a

85
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:43,900
domain and asking chat GPT and

86
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,599
saying, Hey, give me a bunch of

87
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:45,840
different

88
00:01:46,209 --> 00:01:47,219
variations of this domain.

89
00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:48,609
And then you can look them up in

90
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:50,489
your favorite domain registrar and

91
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:51,180
go ahead and

92
00:01:51,469 --> 00:01:51,790
check out.

93
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:53,280
So I'm going to go ahead, pause

94
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,010
and purchase this domain, and then

95
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:55,739
we can go and

96
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:56,519
actually set it up.

97
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:57,140
All right.

98
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,549
So we went ahead and purchased

99
00:01:58,549 --> 00:01:59,519
this domain here.

100
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:00,390
And so you can see

101
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:01,590
it's all set up or it's all

102
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:02,799
processing right now.

103
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,439
And so in the meantime, while it's

104
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:05,299
processing,

105
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:06,810
we can go and start getting our

106
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:08,030
Google workspace up.

107
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:09,419
So how do we set up the Google

108
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:10,258
workspace?

109
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:10,639
First

110
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:11,819
thing we need to do is establish

111
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:12,639
the admin account.

112
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:13,819
So this is the central place.

113
00:02:13,819 --> 00:02:14,610
You're going to be

114
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:16,020
purchasing all your other email

115
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,310
accounts from like how you can

116
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:18,800
say, Hey, I want to assign this

117
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,060
email

118
00:02:19,349 --> 00:02:19,969
account to this domain.

119
00:02:19,969 --> 00:02:21,039
So this is where you're going to

120
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:22,340
be setting up and purchasing it.

121
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:23,159
And this

122
00:02:23,169 --> 00:02:24,090
is also where you're going to be

123
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:25,090
connecting your domains and just

124
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:26,060
managing all this stuff through

125
00:02:26,349 --> 00:02:26,490
Google.

126
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:27,770
So you might already have one of

127
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:29,150
these set up for like your typical

128
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:29,960
email sending.

129
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,419
I would set

130
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:32,159
up another different one for these

131
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:33,539
for the cold email stuff.

132
00:02:33,539 --> 00:02:35,069
So first I'm going to go over to

133
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:35,460
pricing.

134
00:02:35,469 --> 00:02:36,710
And the reason why I don't just

135
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:37,349
jump in here.

136
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,009
And by the way,

137
00:02:38,009 --> 00:02:40,000
workspace.google.com, this is the

138
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,159
website you want to go to.

139
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:42,590
Reason why I go to pricing first,

140
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:44,180
instead of just like jumping

141
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:44,650
straight in

142
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:45,650
is it's going to like pitch you

143
00:02:45,659 --> 00:02:46,710
the high end thing and you have to

144
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:47,500
like downgrade it.

145
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,199
So if you go to

146
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:49,879
pricing and you press start trial

147
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:51,620
on the $6 a month one, now you can

148
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:53,169
get started and make your admin

149
00:02:53,699 --> 00:02:53,849
account.

150
00:02:53,849 --> 00:02:55,110
So I'm just going to call this a

151
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:55,460
Nevo.

152
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:57,139
I'm going to say we have 10 to 99

153
00:02:57,139 --> 00:02:57,900
employees.

154
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:58,870
I just do

155
00:02:58,889 --> 00:02:59,810
this as a matter of caution

156
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:00,949
because we're going to be adding

157
00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:02,000
like 10 accounts to it.

158
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,789
So it's like, Hey,

159
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:03,789
we have 10 employees.

160
00:03:03,789 --> 00:03:04,520
It kind of lines up.

161
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,900
I don't really think this matters.

162
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,099
We're going to press

163
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:07,590
next.

164
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:09,419
It's going to ask for my name.

165
00:03:09,419 --> 00:03:11,400
So Matt, Lucero, current email

166
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,069
address.

167
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:12,939
And so this is

168
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,520
where you can plug in a email,

169
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:16,050
like a Gmail or another email

170
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:17,930
account, or, you know, really any

171
00:03:18,539 --> 00:03:19,509
other email account.

172
00:03:19,509 --> 00:03:20,990
I'm going to plug in one of my

173
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:22,729
other cold email accounts that I

174
00:03:22,729 --> 00:03:24,300
use so that I just

175
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,340
have like something different

176
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:26,379
than, you know, all the other

177
00:03:26,379 --> 00:03:27,460
admin accounts I'm going to have

178
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:27,800
set up.

179
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:29,110
So give me two seconds here.

180
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:29,689
All right.

181
00:03:29,689 --> 00:03:31,210
So I plugged in a Google account.

182
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,449
Let me actually grab a

183
00:03:32,849 --> 00:03:33,250
different one.

184
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:33,710
Hold on.

185
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:34,250
All right.

186
00:03:34,289 --> 00:03:35,599
So I just picked a different one

187
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,120
of my Google workspace accounts.

188
00:03:37,129 --> 00:03:38,219
And so you can see here, do you

189
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:39,560
want to set up a Google workspace?

190
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,090
I'm going to say, yes, use this

191
00:03:42,569 --> 00:03:43,009
email.

192
00:03:43,009 --> 00:03:45,650
And then let me actually go over

193
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:48,280
here and grab the, the code that

194
00:03:48,409 --> 00:03:48,900
sent.

195
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,879
So basically what we're

196
00:03:50,889 --> 00:03:51,990
doing here is we're just saying

197
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:53,250
like, Hey, we already have like an

198
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,379
email account existing.

199
00:03:54,379 --> 00:03:54,960
You can plug

200
00:03:54,969 --> 00:03:56,500
in a Gmail and outlook, whatever,

201
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,780
just any sort of email account

202
00:03:57,789 --> 00:03:59,150
that you can start off with.

203
00:03:59,219 --> 00:03:59,610
Let me grab

204
00:03:59,629 --> 00:04:01,110
the code that it sent here.

205
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:01,789
All right.

206
00:04:01,789 --> 00:04:03,360
So I got the verification code

207
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,580
going to plug it in here.

208
00:04:04,689 --> 00:04:05,750
And so now it's going to ask me

209
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:06,419
for a password.

210
00:04:06,419 --> 00:04:07,599
So pretty straightforward.

211
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:08,590
Just go ahead and throw

212
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:09,669
it in a password.

213
00:04:09,669 --> 00:04:10,370
All right.

214
00:04:10,409 --> 00:04:12,080
So I went ahead and generated a

215
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:12,789
password.

216
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:14,439
And so now it's, this is what

217
00:04:14,509 --> 00:04:15,139
I'm saying here.

218
00:04:15,139 --> 00:04:16,040
If you would have went to the

219
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:16,939
pricing page and just went

220
00:04:16,939 --> 00:04:17,980
straight in, it would have

221
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:19,680
recommended you a different plan.

222
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,100
So we're going to press try free

223
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:21,980
for 14 days.

224
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:22,939
And now it's going to

225
00:04:23,009 --> 00:04:24,319
ask you to review and check out.

226
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:25,589
And so this is where you're going

227
00:04:25,589 --> 00:04:26,779
to enter in all your business

228
00:04:27,149 --> 00:04:27,860
information and credit card

229
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:28,490
information.

230
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:29,959
Again, pretty straightforward.

231
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:30,939
I'm going to go ahead and

232
00:04:30,949 --> 00:04:31,610
fill this out.

233
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:32,709
And then we can jump in on the

234
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,129
other side, whenever I have it all

235
00:04:34,189 --> 00:04:34,720
filled out.

236
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:35,420
All right.

237
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:37,050
So we entered in our credit card

238
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:38,560
here and we can press skip for

239
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,029
now.

240
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:42,180
All right.

241
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,449
And so now you can see we have the

242
00:04:44,449 --> 00:04:46,550
Google workspace set up.

243
00:04:46,579 --> 00:04:47,579
So now we're going to jump

244
00:04:47,589 --> 00:04:49,050
in and actually create the email

245
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:49,649
accounts.

246
00:04:49,649 --> 00:04:50,240
All right.

247
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,720
So we're going to go over here in

248
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,100
the top,

249
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:52,589
right.

250
00:04:52,589 --> 00:04:53,920
And then scroll down and press

251
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,350
admin.

252
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:55,670
And then that's going to take us

253
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:56,519
to our admin.

254
00:04:56,519 --> 00:04:57,120
It's

255
00:04:57,149 --> 00:04:58,000
going to say, welcome to your new

256
00:04:58,029 --> 00:04:58,319
account.

257
00:04:58,319 --> 00:04:58,970
You're going to press, I

258
00:04:58,970 --> 00:04:59,470
understand.

259
00:04:59,769 --> 00:05:01,990
And then now you are in the admin

260
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:02,759
panel.

261
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:05,319
So this is the admin account.

262
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:06,350
This is where you can set up

263
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:08,149
and add domains and do all that

264
00:05:08,149 --> 00:05:09,579
kind of fun stuff here.

265
00:05:09,579 --> 00:05:11,300
So now I'm going to show you how

266
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,019
you can add

267
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,889
your domain or add an email or a

268
00:05:13,889 --> 00:05:15,199
whatever account.

269
00:05:15,269 --> 00:05:17,439
So you can, or a domain, I mean,

270
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:18,600
add a domain

271
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:19,209
into here.

272
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:20,529
So then you can add a user and

273
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:22,339
create the actual account here.

274
00:05:22,339 --> 00:05:23,569
So first we're going to go

275
00:05:23,709 --> 00:05:25,079
over and scroll down and you can

276
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:26,290
see over here in this domain

277
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:27,779
section, you're going to press

278
00:05:27,779 --> 00:05:28,259
manage

279
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:29,089
domains.

280
00:05:29,149 --> 00:05:30,860
And you can see first it's

281
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:32,910
prompting here to verify your

282
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,959
domain to unlock features.

283
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:35,670
So it's

284
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:37,540
basically asking us like, Hey, do

285
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:39,209
you actually own this, uh, by an

286
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:41,139
Evo account or this other account

287
00:05:41,149 --> 00:05:42,629
that I use, uh, just to set this

288
00:05:42,629 --> 00:05:43,180
thing up.

289
00:05:43,189 --> 00:05:44,620
And so it's going to ask for a TXC

290
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:45,579
verification.

291
00:05:45,579 --> 00:05:46,019
I'm going

292
00:05:46,029 --> 00:05:47,430
to press agree and continue.

293
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,829
And so all it's going to ask me is

294
00:05:48,829 --> 00:05:50,879
to basically put, uh, so some code

295
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:50,980
in

296
00:05:51,029 --> 00:05:52,519
my DNS saying, so I'm going to

297
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:54,139
copy this and then go over to pork

298
00:05:54,139 --> 00:05:55,990
bun, and then I'm going to find my

299
00:05:56,449 --> 00:05:57,269
domain here.

300
00:05:57,269 --> 00:05:59,170
So this one is by an Evo.

301
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:01,050
And then you can see here.

302
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:02,230
All right.

303
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:03,800
So this is by an Evo.

304
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:05,560
We're going to press details.

305
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,310
We're going to go over to the DNS,

306
00:06:07,389 --> 00:06:09,089
and then we're going to add this

307
00:06:09,129 --> 00:06:09,319
in

308
00:06:09,329 --> 00:06:10,269
as a TXT record.

309
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:12,019
So you, all you have to do is just

310
00:06:12,019 --> 00:06:13,110
follow the steps.

311
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:15,160
So, uh, copy this TXT record,

312
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:17,709
and then let's double check, uh,

313
00:06:17,709 --> 00:06:19,389
at for the host alias.

314
00:06:19,459 --> 00:06:21,899
So at answer, add this over here.

315
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:22,800
And so

316
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:24,009
we're just plugging this in saying

317
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:25,250
like, Hey Google, we actually own

318
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:26,680
this, uh, and here's some proof.

319
00:06:26,689 --> 00:06:28,220
And so we can press this.

320
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:30,420
Uh, it'll take a second to verify.

321
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:32,319
And then you can see verifying

322
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:32,759
your TXT

323
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:33,240
record.

324
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,660
It might take a couple of minutes

325
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:36,139
and it might also say like, Hey,

326
00:06:36,139 --> 00:06:37,360
this isn't verified.

327
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:37,720
And you

328
00:06:37,769 --> 00:06:38,879
just have to press it again

329
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:40,259
because it might take a second,

330
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:41,360
uh, for it to update.

331
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:41,819
So we're going to

332
00:06:41,829 --> 00:06:43,060
wait for this to verify and we'll

333
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,089
come back when it's done.

334
00:06:44,089 --> 00:06:44,610
All right.

335
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:45,779
So you can see now it confirmed

336
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:46,009
it.

337
00:06:46,149 --> 00:06:46,529
Great job.

338
00:06:46,529 --> 00:06:47,709
Google can see the updates you

339
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,379
make, uh, confirm verification.

340
00:06:49,379 --> 00:06:51,860
And then now we're

341
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:53,040
upset, uh, all set here.

342
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,500
So updating your Google workspace,

343
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,860
this might take a few minutes.

344
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:56,379
In the

345
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:57,920
meantime, while this verifies, we

346
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,279
can actually start to add our DNS

347
00:06:59,279 --> 00:06:59,829
settings.

348
00:06:59,829 --> 00:07:00,759
So, uh, in the meantime,

349
00:07:00,769 --> 00:07:02,300
you want to add your DMARC and

350
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:03,879
custom domain tracking.

351
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:05,730
So these are really easy to add.

352
00:07:06,209 --> 00:07:07,680
I have a sheet here where you can

353
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,199
just copy and paste this in.

354
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:10,259
So, uh, we're going to

355
00:07:10,269 --> 00:07:11,699
go over here and set up our DMARC

356
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:12,199
record.

357
00:07:12,209 --> 00:07:13,649
All you have to do, uh, is copy

358
00:07:13,649 --> 00:07:14,439
and paste on the

359
00:07:14,779 --> 00:07:16,370
sheet here, DMARC underscore for

360
00:07:16,379 --> 00:07:17,050
the host.

361
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:18,959
Uh, this is a TXT record, which is

362
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:19,879
already set

363
00:07:19,889 --> 00:07:21,350
and then paste this in for the

364
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:21,899
answer.

365
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:23,790
And again, whether using GoDaddy,

366
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:25,319
Porkbun, uh, whatever

367
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:26,769
domain registrar, this is all

368
00:07:26,769 --> 00:07:28,319
going to be pretty much the same,

369
00:07:28,389 --> 00:07:29,959
like all these settings and where

370
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:30,699
you find stuff.

371
00:07:30,699 --> 00:07:32,240
There's a DNS settings record

372
00:07:32,269 --> 00:07:32,959
somewhere.

373
00:07:33,029 --> 00:07:34,610
And all of these registrars is

374
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:34,899
pretty

375
00:07:35,269 --> 00:07:35,689
straightforward.

376
00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:36,649
So now we're going to go on to

377
00:07:36,649 --> 00:07:38,019
custom, uh, domain tracking.

378
00:07:38,019 --> 00:07:39,040
This is another

379
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:39,529
thing.

380
00:07:39,529 --> 00:07:41,129
So DMARC, this just is another

381
00:07:41,129 --> 00:07:42,040
thing that helps us

382
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:44,399
deliverability, uh, for your

383
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:45,079
domains and

384
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:46,610
then custom domain tracking.

385
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,170
This is basically connecting it

386
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:48,449
up.

387
00:07:48,449 --> 00:07:49,920
So whenever you add this into

388
00:07:50,189 --> 00:07:51,389
smart lead, if you want to track

389
00:07:51,389 --> 00:07:52,579
open rates, which I don't

390
00:07:52,579 --> 00:07:53,889
particularly recommend, I

391
00:07:53,889 --> 00:07:54,540
personally

392
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:56,009
have that off because it helps us

393
00:07:56,009 --> 00:07:57,639
deliverability that you could have

394
00:07:57,639 --> 00:07:58,339
that set up.

395
00:07:58,339 --> 00:07:59,420
But, uh, I just

396
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:00,740
add this as basically a safety

397
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:01,970
measure, not because it's

398
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:03,300
necessarily like an urgent

399
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:03,699
priority.

400
00:08:03,699 --> 00:08:04,379
Um, so

401
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:06,800
your domain has been verified,

402
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:08,829
begin activating Gmail.

403
00:08:08,829 --> 00:08:09,750
Um, cool.

404
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:11,959
So let's go over here and actually

405
00:08:12,329 --> 00:08:14,110
create some new users here.

406
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:16,420
So it's asking to let's continue

407
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:16,930
here.

408
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,220
So it's asking to do it under this

409
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:20,980
by an Evo account, which I'm not

410
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,220
actually going to do.

411
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:24,079
Let's go out of here and let's add

412
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:24,800
a new domain.

413
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:26,129
So I added in with another

414
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:27,519
professional domain.

415
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:29,129
It might prompt you to like add

416
00:08:29,129 --> 00:08:30,199
your other domain

417
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:31,720
in right when you set this up, but

418
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,908
we're going to go ahead.

419
00:08:32,908 --> 00:08:34,509
So this is a, uh, not the account

420
00:08:34,509 --> 00:08:34,740
that I

421
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:35,908
want to set up the domain on.

422
00:08:35,908 --> 00:08:37,220
So I'm going to add another domain

423
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:37,548
here.

424
00:08:37,548 --> 00:08:39,298
So I'm going to press add domain

425
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,200
and then we're going to add

426
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:42,620
another domain.

427
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,809
So this is the separate domain

428
00:08:44,809 --> 00:08:46,200
that I have set up here,

429
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:47,889
the different one, an Evo

430
00:08:47,889 --> 00:08:48,960
teams.com.

431
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,019
And then we're going to plug it in

432
00:08:51,019 --> 00:08:52,659
here and we're going to add

433
00:08:52,669 --> 00:08:54,059
this as a secondary domain, uh,

434
00:08:54,059 --> 00:08:55,409
and we're going to add domain and

435
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:56,440
start verification.

436
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:57,820
So this is where you can go

437
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,750
through, uh, and you're going to

438
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,840
add all 10 or whatever domains you

439
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:01,960
want

440
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:02,409
to add.

441
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:04,009
And so same thing here, it's going

442
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:05,690
to ask, uh, to do some DNS stuff.

443
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:06,919
We're going to go to the

444
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:07,679
next setting.

445
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:08,710
We're going to copy this

446
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:09,740
verification code.

447
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:10,840
We're going to go here.

448
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,899
We're going to make it

449
00:09:11,909 --> 00:09:12,950
a TXT record.

450
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:14,899
It's going to ask us to paste it

451
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:15,700
in here.

452
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,720
Um, and then put at in the host

453
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,879
name and press

454
00:09:18,889 --> 00:09:19,970
add same situation.

455
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:21,559
We're just telling Google like,

456
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:23,149
Hey, we own this and here's proof

457
00:09:23,149 --> 00:09:23,759
of that.

458
00:09:23,769 --> 00:09:25,210
So, uh, while it's going to wait

459
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:26,730
for that, we're going to wait here

460
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:27,269
again.

461
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:28,379
All right.

462
00:09:28,379 --> 00:09:29,120
So you can see

463
00:09:29,139 --> 00:09:30,649
that it was able to add it after

464
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:31,750
it verified it.

465
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:32,940
So this is awesome.

466
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,700
So now we have a couple of these,

467
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:36,019
uh, steps check that we talked

468
00:09:36,019 --> 00:09:37,210
about in the intro video.

469
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:38,710
So first we have the domain, we

470
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:39,240
have the

471
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:39,990
admin account.

472
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:41,389
Now we connected the domain to the

473
00:09:41,389 --> 00:09:42,139
admin account.

474
00:09:42,139 --> 00:09:43,659
And so now we're going to want to

475
00:09:44,029 --> 00:09:44,759
create the users.

476
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:46,320
So we can go ahead and press up

477
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,029
here and press add new user.

478
00:09:48,049 --> 00:09:49,120
So go on the left

479
00:09:49,139 --> 00:09:50,960
hand side users, add new user.

480
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,730
And then this is where we can make

481
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:54,090
the, uh, account here.

482
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:54,700
So I can

483
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:55,820
say Matt zero.

484
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,889
We can have it named Matt and evo

485
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:00,179
teams.com secondary email.

486
00:10:00,179 --> 00:10:01,480
So this is where it's

487
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:02,590
going to send over the sign-on

488
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:03,940
instructions, uh, which it looks

489
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:05,179
like you don't need to fill this

490
00:10:05,179 --> 00:10:05,340
out.

491
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:06,789
So you can fill this out and then

492
00:10:06,789 --> 00:10:08,299
you can add a profile picture.

493
00:10:08,299 --> 00:10:09,820
Um, you can have it generate a

494
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:11,049
password, create a password.

495
00:10:11,049 --> 00:10:12,080
It doesn't really matter.

496
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,179
Uh, I'm just going to press add

497
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:13,600
new user

498
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:14,059
here.

499
00:10:14,059 --> 00:10:15,580
And so you can see here's the

500
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:16,759
account I created.

501
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:18,070
Here's the password.

502
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,100
I'm going to copy

503
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:21,000
the password and, uh, paste it on

504
00:10:21,009 --> 00:10:22,100
another tab here.

505
00:10:22,169 --> 00:10:23,750
So we're going to press done.

506
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:25,500
And so now we have our

507
00:10:25,509 --> 00:10:26,409
first user created.

508
00:10:26,409 --> 00:10:27,659
So if you want to do this, all you

509
00:10:27,659 --> 00:10:28,830
have to do to repeat the step,

510
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:29,519
let's say you

511
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:31,470
want two users on this domain, go

512
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,580
back here, make another one, Matt

513
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:34,169
Lucero.

514
00:10:34,299 --> 00:10:35,600
And we already have a

515
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:35,899
Matt.

516
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:37,009
And so you can see it auto filled

517
00:10:37,009 --> 00:10:37,740
with Matt Lucero.

518
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:38,779
We don't need to do that.

519
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:39,679
So, uh, I'm

520
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:40,940
just going to stick with the one

521
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:41,899
that we just created.

522
00:10:41,899 --> 00:10:43,279
So you can see now we have the new

523
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:43,679
account.

524
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:44,820
This is what we can go ahead and

525
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:45,840
connect to smart lead.

526
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,360
Now, in the meantime, if you want

527
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:47,679
to add a

528
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:48,970
profile picture, so you can see, I

529
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:50,090
didn't add a profile picture in

530
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:50,960
the other section.

531
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,759
Uh, you actually

532
00:10:51,769 --> 00:10:53,179
have to enable this because for

533
00:10:53,179 --> 00:10:54,879
whatever reason, by default, uh,

534
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:56,399
Google admin has it disabled.

535
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:56,720
So there

536
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,259
should be a profile picture.

537
00:10:58,350 --> 00:10:59,899
Um, or maybe it's, I think it's

538
00:10:59,899 --> 00:11:01,179
directory settings.

539
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,399
Um,

540
00:11:02,409 --> 00:11:02,899
yep.

541
00:11:02,899 --> 00:11:05,059
Directory settings, profile

542
00:11:05,059 --> 00:11:06,710
editing, and then you can enable

543
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:06,799
it.

544
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:07,919
So like people can change their

545
00:11:07,929 --> 00:11:09,200
own profile picture.

546
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,649
So I'll press save there.

547
00:11:10,649 --> 00:11:12,570
Um, so anyways, now we're here, we

548
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:13,759
got this all set up.

549
00:11:13,769 --> 00:11:15,799
And so now we're going to log into

550
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:17,639
the brand new account we just

551
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:18,409
created.

552
00:11:18,539 --> 00:11:19,279
So we're going to go over

553
00:11:19,549 --> 00:11:19,750
here.

554
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,480
We're going to press, uh, add

555
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,159
account.

556
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:23,470
We're going to log in.

557
00:11:23,539 --> 00:11:25,840
So this was, let's go back to the

558
00:11:26,149 --> 00:11:26,450
account here.

559
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:27,570
Cause I already forgot what it

560
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:27,919
was.

561
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:29,519
Matt at nevo teams.com.

562
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:30,799
We're going to copy this.

563
00:11:30,809 --> 00:11:32,080
Uh, we're going to paste it here.

564
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,580
And then we're going to copy the

565
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:36,480
password that they generated for

566
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:37,409
us and paste it.

567
00:11:37,409 --> 00:11:38,960
And then it's going to ask for a

568
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,940
phone number verification code.

569
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,450
So you can just punch

570
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:43,220
in your own phone number.

571
00:11:43,309 --> 00:11:45,090
Um, if you want to use a different

572
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,649
phone number or like a burner

573
00:11:47,009 --> 00:11:47,519
phone number,

574
00:11:47,789 --> 00:11:49,039
there's a bunch of websites where

575
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:50,340
you can like kind of generate

576
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:51,840
these in one of them is, uh,

577
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:52,870
text verify.com.

578
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:54,059
So you can see this is like a

579
00:11:54,059 --> 00:11:54,600
website.

580
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,000
Uh, there's another one.

581
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,639
Uh, let me,

582
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:58,529
let me go verify it real quick.

583
00:11:58,529 --> 00:12:00,570
Um, through a phone verification

584
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:01,100
tool.

585
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:01,519
All right.

586
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:02,480
So I rented a phone

587
00:12:02,769 --> 00:12:02,909
number.

588
00:12:02,909 --> 00:12:03,980
And so to be clear here, the

589
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:05,059
reason why I'm using a phone

590
00:12:05,059 --> 00:12:06,559
number rental thing instead of my

591
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:07,820
personal phone number is because

592
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,149
again, I've used my personal phone

593
00:12:09,149 --> 00:12:10,240
number for a zillion of these

594
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:10,759
accounts.

595
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:11,960
So I just like using one of these

596
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,480
websites.

597
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,919
So all you have to do is just go

598
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:14,549
on to

599
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,200
text verified SMS pool.

600
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,679
There's like SMS PVA.

601
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:19,470
If you just Google like phone

602
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:20,559
number rental,

603
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:22,200
one-time code thing, uh, you can

604
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,509
check one of those out, but

605
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:25,440
basically I just sent it, uh,

606
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:26,769
it gave me a phone number that I

607
00:12:26,809 --> 00:12:28,159
could use for like Gmail.

608
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:29,600
And I'm just going to paste in the

609
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:29,909
code that

610
00:12:29,929 --> 00:12:30,500
it gave me here.

611
00:12:30,529 --> 00:12:31,460
And so now it's going to say,

612
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,639
welcome to your new account.

613
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,519
Let's log into the

614
00:12:33,889 --> 00:12:34,679
account and let's create a

615
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:35,259
password.

616
00:12:35,259 --> 00:12:36,490
So I'm going to go back and I'm

617
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:37,919
going to create a password for

618
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:38,080
this

619
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:38,750
account.

620
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:39,399
Awesome.

621
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:41,019
So I have the password here,

622
00:12:41,019 --> 00:12:42,360
change the password.

623
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,759
And now we should be able

624
00:12:43,769 --> 00:12:45,529
to log into our Google account.

625
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:46,940
So it's kicking me out here

626
00:12:47,009 --> 00:12:48,720
because I am in the admin panel

627
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,440
and we're

628
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:50,850
logging in from the account, which

629
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:52,120
we just created, which doesn't

630
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,440
have admin access because it's

631
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:53,519
like

632
00:12:53,529 --> 00:12:54,029
a sub user.

633
00:12:54,029 --> 00:12:55,389
So it's kicking me out and saying,

634
00:12:55,389 --> 00:12:56,700
Hey, you can't log in here.

635
00:12:56,769 --> 00:12:58,169
But if we go over to

636
00:12:58,580 --> 00:12:59,909
Gmail, if we go and click into

637
00:12:59,909 --> 00:13:01,570
this account here, and now we

638
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:04,159
press into Gmail, we should have a

639
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:04,399
nice,

640
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:06,350
pristine Gmail account that we can

641
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,019
log in on.

642
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:09,049
So this account is already set up,

643
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:09,279
uh,

644
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:11,000
Matt at an Evo teams, fresh Gmail

645
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:11,610
account.

646
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:12,769
Uh, and this is a nice little

647
00:13:12,769 --> 00:13:13,740
interface that we can use

648
00:13:13,769 --> 00:13:15,159
to set everything else up on.

649
00:13:15,159 --> 00:13:16,500
So now if you want to change the

650
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,840
profile picture, you can press

651
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,070
this

652
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:19,299
nice little pencil and add a

653
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:20,830
profile picture, do whatever you

654
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:21,200
want.

655
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,080
Not necessary.

656
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:22,549
Nice to have

657
00:13:22,929 --> 00:13:23,409
sometimes.

658
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,269
Um, but this account is all set

659
00:13:25,269 --> 00:13:25,559
up.

660
00:13:25,629 --> 00:13:27,399
And so now we want to connect it

661
00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:28,240
to smart lead.

662
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:28,559
So

663
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:29,870
we're going to go over to smart

664
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:30,240
lead.

665
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,720
So I have a smart lead account I'm

666
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,399
logged in on,

667
00:13:32,409 --> 00:13:33,409
and we're going to want to press

668
00:13:33,409 --> 00:13:34,529
add account, and then we're going

669
00:13:34,529 --> 00:13:35,679
to press Gmail.

670
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:36,889
And so whenever you try and add a

671
00:13:36,889 --> 00:13:38,860
Gmail account through, uh, OAuth,

672
00:13:38,929 --> 00:13:40,480
you are going to need to add

673
00:13:40,809 --> 00:13:42,799
this client ID code and smart lead

674
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:44,379
makes it super easy.

675
00:13:44,379 --> 00:13:45,440
Uh, let me pause my Slack

676
00:13:45,809 --> 00:13:46,799
notifications.

677
00:13:46,809 --> 00:13:48,120
So yeah, smart lead makes it super

678
00:13:48,169 --> 00:13:48,559
easy.

679
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:49,600
All you have to do is just follow

680
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,399
these instructions here.

681
00:13:50,409 --> 00:13:51,700
So head over to your admin panel,

682
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:52,799
just press this button.

683
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:53,909
So it's going to throw us back to

684
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:54,399
our admin

685
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:55,720
account and we're going to log in,

686
00:13:55,769 --> 00:13:56,940
uh, with the admin account we

687
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:57,590
created.

688
00:13:57,649 --> 00:13:58,799
And we're going to go,

689
00:13:58,809 --> 00:14:01,080
uh, press, I understand.

690
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:03,360
And then awesome.

691
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,120
So now we're in the admin account

692
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:06,159
and we can configure

693
00:14:06,169 --> 00:14:06,809
apps here.

694
00:14:06,809 --> 00:14:08,320
And so all you have to do, uh,

695
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,820
basically what happens if you

696
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,120
don't paste this in, if you just

697
00:14:11,389 --> 00:14:12,620
press like connect account, and

698
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:13,929
then you try and log in, it'll

699
00:14:13,929 --> 00:14:15,429
give you an error and say like,

700
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:15,759
Hey,

701
00:14:15,769 --> 00:14:17,279
this app has been blocked because

702
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:18,759
that app has been restricted.

703
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:20,409
So you need to enable smart lead

704
00:14:20,539 --> 00:14:20,840
to be able to

705
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:22,649
connect your Google accounts.

706
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:24,070
So the way you do this add app

707
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:25,840
OAuth, and then you paste this

708
00:14:26,149 --> 00:14:26,149
thing

709
00:14:26,169 --> 00:14:27,269
that they just gave you here.

710
00:14:27,269 --> 00:14:28,600
Uh, you're going to press search.

711
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,809
You're going to press select.

712
00:14:29,809 --> 00:14:29,919
You're

713
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:31,649
going to take this box, select

714
00:14:31,649 --> 00:14:33,320
again, continue trusted.

715
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,879
I'm going through this really

716
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:35,600
quick.

717
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:36,769
You can pause and slow down.

718
00:14:36,769 --> 00:14:38,110
All you're doing is saying, yes,

719
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:38,720
yes, yes.

720
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,600
Get me to the end of this.

721
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:41,340
So now we have smart lead all set

722
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:43,090
up and configured on this admin

723
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:43,789
account.

724
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,200
So this admin account hosts

725
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:46,159
these two accounts.

726
00:14:46,169 --> 00:14:47,340
And so these two accounts or

727
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:48,799
however many accounts you add to

728
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:50,159
this admin panel,

729
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:51,620
it'll be cool to add to smart

730
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:52,009
lead.

731
00:14:52,049 --> 00:14:53,539
So now if I go back to smart lead

732
00:14:53,539 --> 00:14:55,200
and I press connect account,

733
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:56,490
it'll pop up with the two accounts

734
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:57,279
I'm logged in on.

735
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,879
And if I go to this freshly made

736
00:14:58,879 --> 00:14:59,509
an evo teams

737
00:14:59,889 --> 00:15:01,059
account, it will let me log in.

738
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,789
So if you don't have this enabled,

739
00:15:02,789 --> 00:15:03,980
allow, allow next.

740
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:04,320
If you don't

741
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:05,460
have this enabled, it'll pop up

742
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:06,679
with an error right there and say,

743
00:15:06,679 --> 00:15:08,000
we can't connect this account.

744
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,320
But

745
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:09,720
since we have it set up properly,

746
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,820
it was able to connect this

747
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:11,320
account.

748
00:15:11,389 --> 00:15:13,289
The account is connected

749
00:15:13,809 --> 00:15:13,950
properly.

750
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:14,970
And now we can set up all the

751
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:15,919
different settings.

752
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:17,120
So this is all set up.

753
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,240
All right.

754
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:18,409
So the

755
00:15:18,929 --> 00:15:19,620
council set up.

756
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,320
So now we're going to go back a

757
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,879
couple of steps and set up a

758
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:24,240
couple more records

759
00:15:24,529 --> 00:15:26,009
that we need to set up before we

760
00:15:26,049 --> 00:15:27,600
get everything going.

761
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,039
So I jumped ahead a few steps.

762
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:29,200
We're going

763
00:15:29,289 --> 00:15:30,549
to go back a couple of steps and

764
00:15:30,549 --> 00:15:31,710
go back to pork bun and start

765
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:33,190
setting up a couple more records.

766
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:33,470
So

767
00:15:33,529 --> 00:15:34,590
I had this in my doc here.

768
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:35,919
I don't know why I missed this,

769
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:37,679
but we can also set up our SPF

770
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:38,080
records

771
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:38,490
here too.

772
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:39,549
So you can do that with the DMARC

773
00:15:39,549 --> 00:15:40,879
and the custom domain tracking.

774
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:41,840
All you have to do again

775
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:42,970
is paste these records.

776
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:44,179
And so we're going to copy and

777
00:15:44,179 --> 00:15:45,679
paste the app and a copy and paste

778
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:46,490
the SPF

779
00:15:46,929 --> 00:15:47,509
record here.

780
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:49,330
And so what, there's three records

781
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:51,210
that you need for deliverability.

782
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:52,639
There is SPF,

783
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:54,559
there's DKIM and there's DMARC.

784
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:59,759
SPF and DMARC are pasted in just

785
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:00,559
like these records,

786
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:02,139
like I did here in this video, we

787
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:04,240
can just press add and our SPF is

788
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,200
all set up.

789
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:05,830
Now for

790
00:16:06,649 --> 00:16:08,320
the other one DKIM, you have to go

791
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,080
in and actually generate a key.

792
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,100
You can't just copy and paste

793
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:11,289
that.

794
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:13,200
So if we go over back into our

795
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,470
admin panel and we type in DKIM,

796
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:17,279
it should give us DKIM

797
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:18,399
authentication.

798
00:16:18,409 --> 00:16:19,820
And then now we have to generate a

799
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:20,500
DKIM record.

800
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,710
So we're going to select the

801
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:23,039
domain we want to do this

802
00:16:23,049 --> 00:16:24,110
for and Evo teams.

803
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:26,009
Again, all these steps I'm showing

804
00:16:26,009 --> 00:16:27,840
you, you have to repeat for the

805
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,009
different

806
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:28,730
accounts.

807
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:30,169
So whenever you create an account

808
00:16:30,169 --> 00:16:31,440
and you need, the only one you

809
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,720
don't need to repeat is the

810
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:33,649
the stuff that's on an

811
00:16:33,649 --> 00:16:35,169
organizational level, like that

812
00:16:35,169 --> 00:16:36,720
smart lead copy and paste code.

813
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,120
You do that

814
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:38,440
once per admin account, the

815
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:39,980
profile picture enable that's

816
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:41,429
across the admin account.

817
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,000
So anything you

818
00:16:42,009 --> 00:16:42,860
add is good to go.

819
00:16:42,889 --> 00:16:44,340
Now, when it comes to the DKIM,

820
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:45,509
you need to do this for each

821
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:46,100
domain.

822
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:46,960
For the SPF,

823
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:47,990
you need to do that for each

824
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:48,409
domain.

825
00:16:48,409 --> 00:16:49,629
And for the custom tracking and

826
00:16:49,629 --> 00:16:50,720
the DMARC, you need to do that

827
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:51,629
for each domain.

828
00:16:51,629 --> 00:16:52,990
And then for logging into the

829
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:54,480
accounts, you have to log into

830
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,200
each account,

831
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,159
connect it to smart lead.

832
00:16:56,169 --> 00:16:57,309
I'm just doing it for one account

833
00:16:57,309 --> 00:16:58,480
for the sake of simplicity.

834
00:16:58,850 --> 00:16:59,700
Otherwise I'd just be repeating

835
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:00,799
all the steps over again.

836
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:02,940
And now to set up the DKIM, we're

837
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:03,120
going to

838
00:17:03,129 --> 00:17:04,588
go over here, select the domains.

839
00:17:04,588 --> 00:17:05,920
We're going to press generate new

840
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,309
record.

841
00:17:06,369 --> 00:17:07,759
We're going to press generate.

842
00:17:07,769 --> 00:17:09,779
And then you can see here, it

843
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:11,920
gives us a nice, neat record that

844
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,519
we can go ahead and add back in

845
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:13,680
here.

846
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:15,838
So you can see same deal, TXT

847
00:17:15,838 --> 00:17:16,650
record.

848
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:18,009
That's the host name.

849
00:17:18,009 --> 00:17:19,119
And then we're going to go over

850
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:19,598
here,

851
00:17:19,609 --> 00:17:21,440
TXT value body.

852
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,779
Now DKIM, a little bit more

853
00:17:22,848 --> 00:17:24,568
annoying than the other records.

854
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,359
We're going to press add

855
00:17:25,369 --> 00:17:26,400
here and I'll show you what I

856
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:26,680
mean.

857
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:27,818
So we're going to add it in and

858
00:17:27,818 --> 00:17:29,269
you can see here, it may take up

859
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:29,359
to

860
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,130
48 hours for DNS changes to fully

861
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:31,819
propagate.

862
00:17:31,819 --> 00:17:33,190
So we're going to press start

863
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:34,079
authentication.

864
00:17:34,089 --> 00:17:36,009
And I have a feeling it's going to

865
00:17:36,019 --> 00:17:38,269
say that the, maybe did it just

866
00:17:38,339 --> 00:17:39,039
work?

867
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:41,519
Let's press, got it.

868
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:43,220
Stop authentication.

869
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,500
Let's see here if it

870
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,829
authenticates.

871
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:47,759
Usually most changes will take a

872
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:48,480
few minutes.

873
00:17:48,849 --> 00:17:50,250
Usually this might take 15 minutes

874
00:17:50,289 --> 00:17:51,039
to get set up.

875
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:52,410
Like I've seen it say, it says up

876
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:53,359
to 48 hours,

877
00:17:53,369 --> 00:17:54,680
but if you have issues setting up

878
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:56,140
the DKIM, like you get an error at

879
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:56,640
this step,

880
00:17:57,009 --> 00:17:59,140
then you need to go back, like

881
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:01,609
just wait a few minutes, go back

882
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:04,400
and try and authenticate again.

883
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:06,769
And then lastly, if you keep doing

884
00:18:06,769 --> 00:18:08,430
it, let's say you paste in the

885
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:09,369
record, you press start

886
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:10,400
authenticate,

887
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:11,440
it doesn't authenticate.

888
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,680
And then you come back and you try

889
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:14,000
it 15 minutes later and it still

890
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,710
doesn't do it.

891
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:16,119
You can regenerate a new record

892
00:18:16,119 --> 00:18:17,200
and do it over again.

893
00:18:17,569 --> 00:18:19,119
All right.

894
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:20,200
So I just regenerated.

895
00:18:20,279 --> 00:18:21,039
I tried to make it.

896
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:22,640
So it showed it as an example, but

897
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,359
you can see here,

898
00:18:23,369 --> 00:18:24,319
email authentication, not

899
00:18:24,329 --> 00:18:24,799
verified.

900
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:25,920
So if you're getting this error,

901
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,359
wait 15 minutes and come back.

902
00:18:27,369 --> 00:18:28,890
You can see we're still getting

903
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:29,759
this error.

904
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:31,119
So paste this in.

905
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:32,319
I just saved it as like a new

906
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:32,799
record.

907
00:18:32,809 --> 00:18:33,819
It looks like the first time it

908
00:18:33,819 --> 00:18:34,880
actually did do it right away,

909
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,160
which is pretty, pretty cool.

910
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:37,700
But looks like this time it's not

911
00:18:37,789 --> 00:18:39,160
being as happy and what I see

912
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,319
across a lot of people.

913
00:18:40,329 --> 00:18:41,400
Oh, it looks like because I

914
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,799
actually put the wrong domain.

915
00:18:42,809 --> 00:18:43,990
So you can see here, stop

916
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:45,039
authentication.

917
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:46,849
So this one actually did work

918
00:18:46,849 --> 00:18:48,950
properly and I just messed it up

919
00:18:49,009 --> 00:18:49,279
again.

920
00:18:49,289 --> 00:18:51,170
But anyways, go to the domain,

921
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:53,180
paste the record in, press start

922
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:54,250
authentication.

923
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:55,930
If you get that red error, wait 15

924
00:18:56,029 --> 00:18:57,680
minutes, try redoing the record.

925
00:18:58,049 --> 00:18:58,930
Otherwise, if it authenticates

926
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:00,160
like this, you're good to go.

927
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,190
Just let it do its thing.

928
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:03,119
So those are the last two things.

929
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:04,680
Now inside of smart lead, you have

930
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,200
the account.

931
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:06,519
This is where you can configure

932
00:19:06,519 --> 00:19:07,279
the settings.

933
00:19:07,289 --> 00:19:08,349
The first thing you want to do is

934
00:19:08,349 --> 00:19:09,039
enable warm up.

935
00:19:09,049 --> 00:19:10,339
So this is just saying like, hey,

936
00:19:10,339 --> 00:19:11,740
smart lead, add it to the warm up

937
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:12,319
network.

938
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:14,000
Always keep this on.

939
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,759
I like to have the following

940
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:16,970
settings and always, always,

941
00:19:17,099 --> 00:19:18,400
always just make sure

942
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:19,960
that you double check because

943
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,200
these videos are, you know, I'm

944
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,359
making this video right now.

945
00:19:23,369 --> 00:19:25,599
It's July 18th, 2024.

946
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:27,039
Some best practices might change.

947
00:19:27,049 --> 00:19:28,579
So always confirm like, or I

948
00:19:28,599 --> 00:19:30,240
should say, always confirm.

949
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:31,549
You can go to one of the coaching

950
00:19:31,549 --> 00:19:32,720
calls and just hop on and be like,

951
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,039
hey, Matt,

952
00:19:33,049 --> 00:19:33,920
just want to double check.

953
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:34,730
Like, hey, are these settings

954
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:35,119
still good?

955
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:36,579
All these are the things I'm using

956
00:19:36,579 --> 00:19:37,279
right now.

957
00:19:37,289 --> 00:19:39,799
I do 20 cold per day, 14 minute

958
00:19:39,799 --> 00:19:40,640
time gap.

959
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:41,589
This is where you can add your

960
00:19:41,609 --> 00:19:42,000
signature.

961
00:19:42,009 --> 00:19:43,940
So you can do first name, last

962
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:45,910
name title at company.

963
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:48,319
So I could say founder at an Evo.

964
00:19:48,329 --> 00:19:49,819
Then you can add your tax based

965
00:19:49,819 --> 00:19:51,039
opt out disclaimer.

966
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:52,000
If you don't want

967
00:19:52,369 --> 00:19:56,609
to get any more emails from me

968
00:19:56,609 --> 00:19:58,700
respond with no, thanks.

969
00:19:58,809 --> 00:20:00,329
And I won't email you.

970
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:01,940
So you're just saying, hey, this

971
00:20:02,029 --> 00:20:03,579
is an opt out custom domain

972
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:04,160
tracking.

973
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:05,369
This is what I was talking about

974
00:20:05,369 --> 00:20:05,839
before.

975
00:20:05,849 --> 00:20:08,759
If you go back and you go and copy

976
00:20:08,759 --> 00:20:10,809
this here, you don't need to copy

977
00:20:11,069 --> 00:20:11,109
it.

978
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:12,190
But this is just a fast way of

979
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:12,660
doing it.

980
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:15,359
You just paste email tracking dot

981
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:17,920
this your domain dot com.

982
00:20:18,269 --> 00:20:19,240
Press check status.

983
00:20:19,289 --> 00:20:21,990
So this is basically, well, it

984
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:22,880
might take a second here.

985
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:25,519
Email tracking dot Evo teams dot

986
00:20:25,519 --> 00:20:25,759
com.

987
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:27,789
Sometimes this might take a second

988
00:20:27,789 --> 00:20:28,240
too.

989
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:30,130
So give it it might might take a

990
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:30,880
minute.

991
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:32,769
But anyways, I'm going to press

992
00:20:32,769 --> 00:20:33,440
save reset.

993
00:20:33,809 --> 00:20:34,880
Check status again.

994
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:36,160
All right, cool.

995
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:37,539
So might take a second email

996
00:20:37,539 --> 00:20:38,079
tracking.

997
00:20:38,089 --> 00:20:39,410
I'm going to double check.

998
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:41,599
Uh, open dot so lead track email

999
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:43,119
tracking dot Evo teams dot com.

1000
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:43,980
Strange.

1001
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:45,039
Usually this, this goes right

1002
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:45,319
away.

1003
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:46,289
Let me pause and try and figure

1004
00:20:46,289 --> 00:20:46,680
this out.

1005
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:48,430
Oh, look, looks like I just had a

1006
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:49,200
space at the end here.

1007
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:50,000
That's why that didn't work.

1008
00:20:50,009 --> 00:20:50,319
Awesome.

1009
00:20:50,329 --> 00:20:51,599
All right, seen and verified.

1010
00:20:51,609 --> 00:20:52,640
We're going to press save here.

1011
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:53,839
And so this is all set up.

1012
00:20:53,849 --> 00:20:55,369
So you only need to do this once

1013
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,440
per domain, not per inbox.

1014
00:20:57,450 --> 00:20:58,740
So like if you have two inbox in

1015
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:00,319
one domain, you do it once each

1016
00:21:00,319 --> 00:21:00,799
domain

1017
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:02,559
because it's in the DNS settings.

1018
00:21:02,569 --> 00:21:03,039
Warm up.

1019
00:21:03,049 --> 00:21:04,480
This is where you can configure

1020
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,690
that we're going to enable warm

1021
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:06,000
up.

1022
00:21:06,019 --> 00:21:07,319
These are the settings I like to

1023
00:21:07,319 --> 00:21:07,680
use.

1024
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:09,920
I like to do 30 warm up emails per

1025
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,400
day.

1026
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:12,319
I like to randomize it between 20

1027
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:14,799
and 30 with a five day ramp up.

1028
00:21:14,809 --> 00:21:17,279
Set the reply rate to 50 and then

1029
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:18,400
leave this off.

1030
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:19,240
And then we're going to press

1031
00:21:19,289 --> 00:21:19,599
update.

1032
00:21:19,609 --> 00:21:20,869
And so now this account is all

1033
00:21:20,869 --> 00:21:22,160
connected to smart lead.

1034
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:23,029
It's all set.

1035
00:21:23,369 --> 00:21:23,839
Ready to go.

1036
00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:25,150
That's how you connect a Google

1037
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:26,640
account to smart lead front to

1038
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,119
back.

1039
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:28,240
Open a close.

1040
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:30,230
You, uh, I, hopefully you stuck

1041
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:31,240
around with me here for all of

1042
00:21:31,309 --> 00:21:32,000
these 20 minutes

1043
00:21:32,009 --> 00:21:32,950
and you were taking notes.

1044
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:34,490
I try to get through this as quick

1045
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:35,920
as possible, uh, because there are

1046
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,799
a lot of steps.

1047
00:21:36,809 --> 00:21:38,000
All you have to do is just repeat

1048
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,200
this for each one of the domains

1049
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:39,759
that you have,

1050
00:21:39,769 --> 00:21:40,799
and then you should be all set.

1051
00:21:40,809 --> 00:21:41,859
So that's how you set up Google

1052
00:21:41,859 --> 00:21:42,380
accounts.

1053
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:43,779
If you have any questions, ask one

1054
00:21:43,779 --> 00:21:45,279
of your student success coaches or

1055
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:46,559
show up at one of my calls.

1056
00:21:46,569 --> 00:21:47,829
And hopefully that was really

1057
00:21:47,829 --> 00:21:48,319
useful.

1058
00:21:48,589 --> 00:21:48,880
Appreciate you guys.
