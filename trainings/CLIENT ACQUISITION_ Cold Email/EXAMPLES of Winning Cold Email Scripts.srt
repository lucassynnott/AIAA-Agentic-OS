1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,000
Okay, I could sit in a Google Doc

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,540
all day and show you different

3
00:00:03,549 --> 00:00:04,740
examples of what could work

4
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:06,809
in a campaign, or I could pull up

5
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:09,060
an example of each offer path and

6
00:00:09,099 --> 00:00:10,919
show you winning campaigns

7
00:00:10,929 --> 00:00:12,099
that already exist and are

8
00:00:12,099 --> 00:00:13,599
generating real results for real

9
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:14,380
businesses.

10
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:16,050
So starting with

11
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:17,829
email marketing, a client of ours,

12
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:19,320
who the guy is also a good friend

13
00:00:19,329 --> 00:00:20,579
of ours, he's been in our

14
00:00:20,589 --> 00:00:22,230
program for a while, he basically

15
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:23,440
does email marketing for

16
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,510
e-commerce brands.

17
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:25,219
And if you're

18
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:26,780
following the email marketing

19
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:28,449
path, this is almost exactly the

20
00:00:28,449 --> 00:00:29,879
same service model that you

21
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:31,660
will be running with your

22
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:32,590
business.

23
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:34,869
So this interface is the sending

24
00:00:34,869 --> 00:00:36,579
tool that we use to

25
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:38,619
reach out to thousands of people a

26
00:00:38,619 --> 00:00:40,009
month on autopilot.

27
00:00:40,009 --> 00:00:41,829
And this is what the dashboard

28
00:00:41,829 --> 00:00:42,280
looks

29
00:00:42,289 --> 00:00:42,630
like.

30
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:43,780
It shows you how many people

31
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:45,329
you've contacted, how many replies

32
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:46,609
you have, and how many total

33
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:47,679
replies you have.

34
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:49,840
So reaching out to 8100 people,

35
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:51,700
they've generated 33 positive

36
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:52,920
replies, which is a

37
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:54,640
very good output.

38
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,929
Um, I like to say that anything

39
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,890
over one positive reply per 500

40
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:01,289
emails is good.

41
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:01,770
And this

42
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:04,969
guy has one positive reply per 247

43
00:01:04,969 --> 00:01:06,620
people contacted.

44
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:09,400
So, you know, crushing it, this is

45
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:10,560
a really good

46
00:01:11,209 --> 00:01:12,640
metric to shoot for.

47
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,689
Um, and if we look here, you can

48
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:18,049
even see based on the AB testing

49
00:01:18,049 --> 00:01:19,060
that he's running,

50
00:01:19,069 --> 00:01:20,299
which of these angles is

51
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:21,590
performing the best.

52
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:23,019
So let's just go through the

53
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:24,459
actual messaging and see

54
00:01:24,469 --> 00:01:25,530
what's working.

55
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:27,450
So, you know, if you, in the last

56
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:29,040
video, I was just going over

57
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,500
basics and examples of

58
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:32,200
what a good campaign looks like in

59
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,709
this video, I want to show you

60
00:01:33,709 --> 00:01:35,480
from a to Z, what is a successful

61
00:01:35,489 --> 00:01:37,069
campaign looks like with subject

62
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,829
lines, follow-ups, AB testing the

63
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,579
whole nine yards, right?

64
00:01:40,579 --> 00:01:42,359
So here is

65
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:44,549
variant a of their campaign.

66
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:46,829
So half of the prospects will get

67
00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:48,760
variant a, the other half

68
00:01:48,769 --> 00:01:50,180
will get variant B, right?

69
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:51,900
Very simple AB testing, different

70
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,599
emails go out to different people

71
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:54,060
to

72
00:01:54,069 --> 00:01:55,629
see which one performs the best.

73
00:01:55,629 --> 00:01:57,260
Here's the entire email, right?

74
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:58,450
Hope you're having a solid

75
00:01:58,450 --> 00:01:59,079
Wednesday

76
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:00,859
reaching out because we can help

77
00:02:00,859 --> 00:02:03,040
you add 40 to 50 can revenue per

78
00:02:03,049 --> 00:02:05,390
month for your brand offer with

79
00:02:05,409 --> 00:02:07,180
email marketing that actually

80
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:09,340
maximizes sale and profit, right?

81
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:11,280
So direct offer that Daniel talks

82
00:02:11,389 --> 00:02:12,900
about plus if you don't see 40 K

83
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,520
in 90 days in revenue, you don't

84
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,849
pay that simple offer and look

85
00:02:16,909 --> 00:02:18,330
at what these guys did the way

86
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:19,860
that they built their puzzle or

87
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,580
their fishing line or whatever you

88
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:21,740
want

89
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,330
to call it is they did direct

90
00:02:23,379 --> 00:02:24,569
offer guarantee.

91
00:02:24,569 --> 00:02:26,330
And then they still used a lead

92
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:26,969
magnet.

93
00:02:26,969 --> 00:02:27,800
So they used

94
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:28,740
a direct offer.

95
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,310
And then instead of pitching a

96
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:31,969
video, they just pitched a lead

97
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:32,659
magnet.

98
00:02:32,669 --> 00:02:34,289
I even went ahead and revamped

99
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,870
your welcome series email to

100
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:37,900
optimize it for more revenue.

101
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:38,780
Mind if I shoot

102
00:02:38,789 --> 00:02:40,639
over the design here, right?

103
00:02:40,689 --> 00:02:42,889
So that's a pretty clever way of,

104
00:02:42,889 --> 00:02:46,180
um, framing their offer.

105
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:47,020
They pitched

106
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:49,400
a guarantee 40 to 50 K in sales,

107
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,349
um, lead magnet, redesign your

108
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:53,069
welcome series email.

109
00:02:53,069 --> 00:02:55,620
Variant one B is

110
00:02:55,629 --> 00:02:57,159
very similar, but it's a little

111
00:02:57,159 --> 00:02:58,409
bit different, right?

112
00:02:58,439 --> 00:03:00,000
Actually, I don't know if this is

113
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,020
any different.

114
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:01,819
Hold on.

115
00:03:01,819 --> 00:03:04,139
We can help you add plus.

116
00:03:04,139 --> 00:03:04,560
Okay.

117
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,460
So these, these are very similar.

118
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:07,819
Let's go into one C.

119
00:03:08,449 --> 00:03:16,259
Um, and also really switching up

120
00:03:16,259 --> 00:03:18,879
is some of the, the filler as in

121
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,689
no generic AI copywriting or

122
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:21,960
inexperienced designers.

123
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:23,530
We even redesigned your welcome

124
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:24,669
flow to show you what we do

125
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,340
differently.

126
00:03:25,349 --> 00:03:25,639
Cool.

127
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:26,719
If I share the design with you

128
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:27,080
here.

129
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:29,020
So when all of these variants,

130
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,219
they're saying the same

131
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:32,159
thing, you know, I, all they want

132
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:33,460
to do is get a welcome flow

133
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:35,340
redesign over to the prospect.

134
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:35,979
And they're

135
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:37,689
just mixing and matching puzzle

136
00:03:37,689 --> 00:03:39,520
pieces to see which angle performs

137
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:40,150
the best.

138
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:40,659
They're literally

139
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:42,349
following the exact thing I was

140
00:03:42,349 --> 00:03:44,300
preaching in the previous video.

141
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:47,900
Email two is similar.

142
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:48,620
Um,

143
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,469
so in their followup email,

144
00:03:51,509 --> 00:03:53,659
basically all this is, is the

145
00:03:53,659 --> 00:03:55,819
first email in the sequence goes

146
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:56,379
out to

147
00:03:56,389 --> 00:03:57,340
Jennifer, right?

148
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,460
Hope you're having a great

149
00:03:58,539 --> 00:04:00,020
Wednesday subject line question

150
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:00,699
for Jennifer

151
00:04:01,419 --> 00:04:04,580
offer guarantee lead magnet, very

152
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:07,090
simple email signature, first and

153
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:08,460
last name, co-founder at

154
00:04:08,469 --> 00:04:09,550
the business.

155
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:11,629
Um, if this email doesn't get

156
00:04:11,629 --> 00:04:14,020
responded to, they send out a

157
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:15,340
followup email,

158
00:04:15,349 --> 00:04:16,920
which is automated by this

159
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,019
software four days later that goes

160
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:21,180
out and all's the followup email

161
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:21,420
says

162
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:22,939
is Jennifer.

163
00:04:22,939 --> 00:04:24,459
We redesigned your welcome floats

164
00:04:24,459 --> 00:04:25,699
email to optimize it for more

165
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,379
conversions.

166
00:04:26,389 --> 00:04:28,379
Mind if I share it with you here

167
00:04:28,379 --> 00:04:29,899
so you can see what we do

168
00:04:29,899 --> 00:04:31,060
differently.

169
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,680
Um, and that's the entire

170
00:04:32,709 --> 00:04:34,379
followup email variant a and

171
00:04:34,379 --> 00:04:36,199
variant B read it revamped your

172
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:38,139
welcome flow email to optimize it

173
00:04:38,139 --> 00:04:38,459
for more

174
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:38,939
revenue.

175
00:04:39,129 --> 00:04:40,110
Mind if I share it with you here

176
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:41,500
to see what we do differently.

177
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,860
It's funny how basic

178
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:47,259
I said that in the previous video.

179
00:04:47,259 --> 00:04:50,810
So we do three email sequences,

180
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:53,100
email one, email two, email three.

181
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:54,829
Um, after email three, we just cut

182
00:04:54,829 --> 00:04:56,180
it off and move on because people

183
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,259
aren't going to answer if they

184
00:04:57,269 --> 00:04:58,699
don't answer in three emails.

185
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,269
The third email, I saw a couple of

186
00:05:00,269 --> 00:05:01,899
things with your welcome series

187
00:05:01,899 --> 00:05:02,060
email

188
00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:03,000
that are damaging your

189
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,649
conversions.

190
00:05:03,699 --> 00:05:04,910
So I revamped it to optimize it

191
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:05,959
for more revenue.

192
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:06,860
Mind if I share

193
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:08,939
the email design with you here and

194
00:05:09,019 --> 00:05:10,959
three B is almost the same exact

195
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:11,660
thing.

196
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:13,019
So if you're in the email

197
00:05:13,029 --> 00:05:14,610
marketing path, pause the video

198
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:16,370
throughout this, um, and just look

199
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:18,459
at the copy that they're using

200
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:20,459
for emails one, two, and three

201
00:05:20,459 --> 00:05:22,300
along with the subject lines

202
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,300
question for Jennifer question

203
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:24,920
for.

204
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,220
So it's the

205
00:05:25,269 --> 00:05:26,470
same subject line.

206
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,360
Um, pause the video, write down

207
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,310
the copy, add your own tweaks into

208
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:31,339
it and use these

209
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:33,370
messages in your outreach because

210
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:34,839
it's working for an email

211
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:36,540
marketing client of mine.

212
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:38,779
Now let's get into the

213
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:40,860
content side of things because

214
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:42,980
this client of ours sells, um,

215
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:44,860
LinkedIn content and ghost

216
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:45,100
writing,

217
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:46,100
which is very similar to what

218
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:46,829
you'll be selling.

219
00:05:46,829 --> 00:05:47,939
If you're following the content

220
00:05:47,939 --> 00:05:48,300
path,

221
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:51,850
I actually want to see which of

222
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:54,610
their email ones got positive

223
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,420
replies.

224
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:57,220
It looks like email one D is the

225
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:57,860
winner.

226
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,519
So let's see what email one D

227
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:00,699
actually says.

228
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:04,259
Um, okay.

229
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:06,379
Your competitors are getting leads

230
00:06:06,379 --> 00:06:07,470
from LinkedIn and they're probably

231
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:08,209
not as qualified

232
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:08,910
as you are.

233
00:06:08,939 --> 00:06:10,600
We write content that positions

234
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,540
coaches and consultants as the

235
00:06:12,579 --> 00:06:14,459
go-to expert in their niche.

236
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:17,250
One client got 63 leads in 30 days

237
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:18,060
offer.

238
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,579
We write content that does X, Y,

239
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:19,819
and Z.

240
00:06:19,819 --> 00:06:20,459
One of our clients

241
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:21,180
got this result.

242
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,639
Want me to send over a video

243
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,449
outlining how we would do this for

244
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:25,500
your company.

245
00:06:26,149 --> 00:06:26,850
That's it.

246
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,389
Direct offer video pitch.

247
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:29,660
One of the puzzle piece

248
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:30,819
combinations that I showed you in

249
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:30,939
the

250
00:06:30,949 --> 00:06:32,019
previous video.

251
00:06:32,019 --> 00:06:34,240
Once again, cause it works, right?

252
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,220
So pause this, take a note of what

253
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:36,819
this person is

254
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,720
saying in the email.

255
00:06:38,769 --> 00:06:41,540
Um, and we'll move on to email two

256
00:06:41,579 --> 00:06:42,699
and three.

257
00:06:42,699 --> 00:06:44,379
So two B and three B are each

258
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:44,779
doing

259
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,490
very well.

260
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,800
Email two B we help business

261
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,800
consultants eliminate the content

262
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,290
creation bottleneck.

263
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:54,540
That's

264
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:56,029
keeping them from scaling with

265
00:06:56,029 --> 00:06:56,939
social content.

266
00:06:56,939 --> 00:06:58,709
One client went from 12 to 50 K

267
00:06:58,899 --> 00:06:59,980
months because LinkedIn

268
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:01,709
content brought him qualified

269
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:02,250
leads.

270
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:03,680
Want me to send over a video

271
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,449
outlining how we would do it for

272
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:05,660
you.

273
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:07,629
Same concept, pitching a video.

274
00:07:07,629 --> 00:07:09,389
And I'm sure three B is similar as

275
00:07:09,389 --> 00:07:09,740
well.

276
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:12,430
Who handles business development

277
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:13,079
for your company?

278
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:14,689
We help business consultants get

279
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:15,420
qualified LinkedIn

280
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:16,370
leads with content.

281
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:17,259
I recorded a video.

282
00:07:17,269 --> 00:07:18,750
Mind if I send it over puzzle

283
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:21,019
pieces, once again, hook offer,

284
00:07:21,029 --> 00:07:23,069
how are you, are you pitching a

285
00:07:23,069 --> 00:07:24,259
lead magnet or a video?

286
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,660
And it works over and over again

287
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:26,139
for all of

288
00:07:26,149 --> 00:07:27,350
the business paths that we offer

289
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,220
in this program.

290
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:31,009
Um, the signature, once again,

291
00:07:31,009 --> 00:07:31,660
very simple.

292
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:31,899
First and

293
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,279
last name, company name, please

294
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:34,600
reply, apply no thanks if you're

295
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,500
not interested.

296
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,939
And the subject

297
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,699
line is, um, so in the email

298
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:43,509
marketing path, they used question

299
00:07:43,509 --> 00:07:45,180
for first name as a subject line

300
00:07:45,189 --> 00:07:46,959
in the ghost writing path and the

301
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:47,870
content path.

302
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:49,769
They they're using LinkedIn leads

303
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:50,779
for consultants.

304
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:52,939
They're using two things about

305
00:07:52,949 --> 00:07:55,649
LinkedIn, um, company name, X

306
00:07:55,649 --> 00:07:57,980
company, new pipeline, very simple

307
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:58,300
subject

308
00:07:58,389 --> 00:07:59,600
lines that you don't really need

309
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:00,329
to worry about.

310
00:08:00,329 --> 00:08:01,720
I'll throw a list of subject lines

311
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,540
down below in the

312
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:03,509
comments.

313
00:08:03,509 --> 00:08:05,750
Um, okay, ads and funnels.

314
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,600
So this client sells lead

315
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,980
generation to real estate and the

316
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:10,060
way

317
00:08:10,149 --> 00:08:12,220
that they're pitching their ads

318
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,660
are with, um, are with just

319
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,579
benefit based messaging.

320
00:08:17,579 --> 00:08:18,459
So let's see which

321
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:20,120
angle is working here.

322
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,560
Um, first name X, your agency

323
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,230
name.

324
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:25,420
So if you're watching this and you

325
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:25,579
want to

326
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:28,519
make a good subject line, just do

327
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:31,339
Christian X email agency intro

328
00:08:31,339 --> 00:08:34,570
seller leads, um, new pipeline,

329
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:35,070
right?

330
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:36,480
That's a really good subject line.

331
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,750
Another really good subject line

332
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,418
is just need seller leads,

333
00:08:39,429 --> 00:08:41,389
need content, need email marketing

334
00:08:41,389 --> 00:08:42,759
help, stuff like that.

335
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:43,980
Um, but let's see what the actual

336
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:44,700
message says.

337
00:08:45,909 --> 00:08:47,120
We've helped hundreds of real

338
00:08:47,259 --> 00:08:48,539
estate agents or investors find

339
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:50,059
sellers over the past five years.

340
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:51,230
Our leads come from people

341
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,610
actively looking to sell their

342
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:53,980
properties, giving you higher

343
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:54,379
conversion

344
00:08:54,389 --> 00:08:55,600
rates than cold prospects.

345
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,820
We compete on price and volume.

346
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,179
So you get more leads for less

347
00:08:59,179 --> 00:08:59,659
money.

348
00:08:59,669 --> 00:09:01,690
Interested in seeing what leads we

349
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:02,889
have in your area.

350
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,539
This is a good call to action that

351
00:09:04,539 --> 00:09:05,129
I haven't talked

352
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:05,919
about yet.

353
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:07,789
Instead of pitching a lead magnet

354
00:09:07,789 --> 00:09:09,639
or a video, I mean, this is a lead

355
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:10,940
magnet, but interested

356
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,379
in seeing what leads we have

357
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,169
available in your area that create

358
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,820
that intrigue is getting people

359
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:16,980
to say, yeah, I want to learn

360
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:17,309
more.

361
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,539
Cause what leads do you have?

362
00:09:18,539 --> 00:09:19,659
I'm very interested.

363
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:19,899
Right?

364
00:09:19,899 --> 00:09:20,700
So

365
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:22,220
direct offer.

366
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:25,379
We help investors find sellers.

367
00:09:25,419 --> 00:09:27,340
Good call to action.

368
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:28,220
Do you want to see what leads

369
00:09:28,309 --> 00:09:30,110
we have available in your area?

370
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:30,600
Right?

371
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:32,220
Same thing with email too.

372
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:33,980
Most companies charge premium

373
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,629
prices for low quality prospects,

374
00:09:35,629 --> 00:09:36,840
but we compete on price and

375
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,320
volume.

376
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,100
Our leads are motivated homeowners

377
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:40,629
looking to sell, giving you better

378
00:09:40,629 --> 00:09:42,110
conversions and cold outreach.

379
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:43,419
Mind if I send over our current

380
00:09:43,429 --> 00:09:44,620
pricing and inventory?

381
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:46,860
Thanks name of the business or

382
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,889
first and last name, name of the

383
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:49,879
business.

384
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:50,179
Right?

385
00:09:51,669 --> 00:09:54,100
Um, once again, the puzzle pieces

386
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,220
are the same, no matter which

387
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,500
service you're selling,

388
00:09:57,509 --> 00:09:58,299
right?

389
00:09:58,299 --> 00:09:59,559
Email three who handles lead

390
00:09:59,559 --> 00:10:01,029
acquisition for your real estate

391
00:10:01,029 --> 00:10:01,490
deals.

392
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,620
We provide high quality

393
00:10:02,629 --> 00:10:04,919
seller leads to investors.

394
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,789
Um, we're helping several

395
00:10:06,889 --> 00:10:08,879
investors get motivated seller

396
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:09,820
leads this month.

397
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:11,039
I've put together our current lead

398
00:10:11,179 --> 00:10:12,120
selection and rates for your

399
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:12,610
market.

400
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:13,740
Would it be valuable if I share

401
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:14,950
that with you here?

402
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,039
So if you're running, um, ads and

403
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:19,820
funnels as a, uh, you know, agency

404
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:20,200
path,

405
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:21,710
pause this and check out what's

406
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,960
working for this specific

407
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:23,659
business.

408
00:10:23,659 --> 00:10:24,779
Because in this case,

409
00:10:24,789 --> 00:10:25,789
they're not even mentioning the

410
00:10:25,789 --> 00:10:26,799
fact that they're running ads or

411
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:28,220
just saying what they can get for

412
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:30,139
the business motivated seller

413
00:10:30,139 --> 00:10:32,389
leads, dental leads, um, whatever

414
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:34,100
type of business model you're

415
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:34,460
reaching

416
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:34,860
out to.

417
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:35,870
It could be an agency.

418
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:37,080
You could be reaching out the

419
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:37,639
software.

420
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:38,620
You could be working

421
00:10:38,629 --> 00:10:39,789
with consultants.

422
00:10:39,789 --> 00:10:41,539
Just take this, you know, keep

423
00:10:41,539 --> 00:10:43,279
this in mind when you're writing

424
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:44,090
your emails,

425
00:10:44,149 --> 00:10:45,220
you can still do a lead magnet

426
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:46,710
approach and say, Hey, I put

427
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:49,419
together a list of five ad scripts

428
00:10:49,419 --> 00:10:49,899
or a list

429
00:10:49,909 --> 00:10:51,110
of five templates or a funnel

430
00:10:51,259 --> 00:10:51,889
build out.

431
00:10:51,889 --> 00:10:53,789
That's still going to work, but

432
00:10:53,789 --> 00:10:55,740
you can also go benefit

433
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,370
heavy and say, Hey, we can get you

434
00:10:57,379 --> 00:10:59,059
25 seller leads in your market

435
00:10:59,059 --> 00:11:00,620
this month, fully guaranteed,

436
00:11:00,629 --> 00:11:01,799
or you don't pay.

437
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:03,860
Um, you know, do you want to see a

438
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:04,539
video?

439
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:07,259
So I'm just giving you examples of

440
00:11:07,269 --> 00:11:08,080
campaigns that are actively

441
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:08,460
working.

442
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,350
So you see real world applications

443
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:11,820
of what I just taught you on the

444
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:12,899
previous video.

445
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:14,570
If you want to go off on your own

446
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:16,460
and try new stuff by all means,

447
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:17,289
please do.

448
00:11:17,429 --> 00:11:18,580
But I'm just showing you what's

449
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,269
worked for actual business owners,

450
00:11:20,269 --> 00:11:22,539
um, in our client base.

451
00:11:22,539 --> 00:11:22,889
So

452
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:27,019
AI automations, a lot of you, you

453
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:28,820
know, chose the AI automations

454
00:11:28,929 --> 00:11:30,299
path probably, and you want to see

455
00:11:30,309 --> 00:11:32,029
what's working for that, um,

456
00:11:32,029 --> 00:11:33,769
agency path over cold email.

457
00:11:33,769 --> 00:11:34,620
Here you go.

458
00:11:34,659 --> 00:11:36,940
We can guarantee you five new

459
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:38,379
clients a month with our AI sales

460
00:11:38,429 --> 00:11:38,940
system.

461
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:42,259
We use N8N chat GPT and make to

462
00:11:42,259 --> 00:11:43,340
automate nurturing,

463
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:45,259
follow-ups and meeting scheduling.

464
00:11:45,259 --> 00:11:46,940
So your team can focus on closing

465
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:47,330
deals.

466
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,580
I created a quick video

467
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:50,669
showing you exactly how this

468
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:51,110
works.

469
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:52,059
Do you want to see it?

470
00:11:52,059 --> 00:11:54,460
Same principle that I've been

471
00:11:54,539 --> 00:11:55,049
showing you the

472
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:58,110
whole time, direct offer video

473
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:00,870
pitch, go for the, the, the

474
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:02,940
response, right?

475
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:07,169
Here's a different way to, to

476
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:09,019
structure the same thing.

477
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:10,860
I created a video demonstrating

478
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:11,580
how our AI

479
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:13,639
sales system helps companies sign

480
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:15,279
five extra clients every month.

481
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:16,220
Guaranteed.

482
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,340
The video shows

483
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:18,559
how we use N8N chat GPT and make

484
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,190
to automate your qualification and

485
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:20,860
follow-ups.

486
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:21,419
Do you want to see

487
00:12:21,429 --> 00:12:21,820
the demo?

488
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,710
So here, I mean, hopefully this

489
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,279
video gives you context.

490
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,299
Like the video that I did

491
00:12:27,409 --> 00:12:27,879
previously

492
00:12:27,909 --> 00:12:29,870
showed you the templates of how to

493
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:31,409
write good cold emails.

494
00:12:31,409 --> 00:12:33,259
This video shows you the actual

495
00:12:33,259 --> 00:12:33,980
cold emails

496
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:34,570
in action.

497
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,000
Like here's a good, I want to go

498
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,659
through the inbox here real quick

499
00:12:37,659 --> 00:12:39,110
to show you what prospects

500
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:41,610
will actually respond with when

501
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:43,740
you use these templates.

502
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:47,100
So this is the campaign.

503
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,059
Let's go to interested.

504
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:51,210
Okay.

505
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,600
Here's the email marketing path

506
00:12:52,629 --> 00:12:53,970
with actual responses in their

507
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:55,029
inbox.

508
00:12:55,129 --> 00:12:55,659
Um,

509
00:12:55,669 --> 00:12:57,210
I read it just now.

510
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:59,309
My week is usually short.

511
00:12:59,309 --> 00:13:01,419
I'm making this for review

512
00:13:01,429 --> 00:13:03,279
next week when I have more time.

513
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:04,139
Okay, great.

514
00:13:04,149 --> 00:13:08,820
Um, this guy said, would love to

515
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:10,019
have a call about this.

516
00:13:10,129 --> 00:13:10,860
Let me know.

517
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:11,580
Good response.

518
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:13,580
Daniel said,

519
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:14,789
can you give me a ballpark pricing

520
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:15,500
structure?

521
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,769
Um, it looks great.

522
00:13:16,769 --> 00:13:17,659
Stuff like that.

523
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:20,139
Jay said, we will contact you

524
00:13:20,139 --> 00:13:22,519
after they've had time to review.

525
00:13:22,529 --> 00:13:26,509
Amy said, okay, yes, please.

526
00:13:26,549 --> 00:13:28,100
So like you can see when you have

527
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,759
a really good pitch with a lead

528
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:31,659
magnet or a video or a redesign

529
00:13:31,669 --> 00:13:33,690
of an email template, people will

530
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:35,500
respond with interest and they

531
00:13:35,509 --> 00:13:36,940
want to learn more from you.

532
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:37,799
And they're actually excited to

533
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:39,129
hear from you, even though you're

534
00:13:39,129 --> 00:13:39,980
a complete stranger.

535
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:40,259
Sure.

536
00:13:40,259 --> 00:13:40,700
Go ahead.

537
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:41,059
Thanks.

538
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:42,059
Exclamation point.

539
00:13:42,139 --> 00:13:42,769
They're excited.

540
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:43,659
Sure.

541
00:13:43,659 --> 00:13:45,340
Good answer.

542
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:46,460
Linda said,

543
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:47,210
okay, I'll bite.

544
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:48,470
I'd love to see your improvements

545
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:49,419
to my welcome email.

546
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:50,950
Corey said, sure.

547
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:52,620
Would love to see it.

548
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:56,409
Janice said, um, okay, they can't

549
00:13:56,409 --> 00:13:56,779
afford it.

550
00:13:56,779 --> 00:13:57,340
That's not our

551
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:57,820
fault.

552
00:13:58,059 --> 00:13:59,379
Adam said, feel free to send it

553
00:13:59,379 --> 00:13:59,799
over.

554
00:13:59,799 --> 00:14:00,279
Right.

555
00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:01,980
So you guys, like I'm giving you a

556
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:02,460
behind the

557
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:03,669
scenes look of successful cold

558
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:05,100
outreach campaigns that my clients

559
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,450
are running with the exact

560
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:06,940
services

561
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:07,980
that you are selling.

562
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,399
All you have to do is replicate

563
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:10,539
what they're doing.

564
00:14:10,539 --> 00:14:11,980
Go back in the video,

565
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:13,419
pause it, see what they're using

566
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:15,110
in their scripts, model your

567
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:16,779
scripts after their scripts.

568
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:17,980
Don't copy them word for word.

569
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,190
Think on your feet and you will be

570
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:20,299
able to get responses in your

571
00:14:20,299 --> 00:14:20,940
inbox

572
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:21,899
that look like this.

573
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:23,580
I'll make a video going over the

574
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,620
technology stack.

575
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:25,580
So you actually,

576
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:26,799
you know, understand what the

577
00:14:26,809 --> 00:14:27,820
hell's going on here.

578
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:28,769
Like, what are all these

579
00:14:28,769 --> 00:14:29,419
responses?

580
00:14:29,429 --> 00:14:30,009
What do I do?

581
00:14:30,139 --> 00:14:31,500
How do I get people on the phone?

582
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:32,379
We will dive into that.

583
00:14:32,379 --> 00:14:33,580
I'm just trying to build

584
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:34,950
the foundation for you of how to

585
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:36,159
write really good outreach

586
00:14:36,169 --> 00:14:37,399
messages that actually get

587
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:38,059
answered.

588
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:39,779
So in the next video, I'm going to

589
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:43,039
go over, um, how to use AI to

590
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:44,519
write your scripts, because if

591
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:44,779
you're

592
00:14:45,409 --> 00:14:46,830
watching this, like I said, I

593
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:49,250
wanted to give you, um, the, the

594
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:51,899
understanding of the actual skill.

595
00:14:51,909 --> 00:14:52,980
I wanted to teach you how to

596
00:14:53,029 --> 00:14:54,299
actually write cold outreach

597
00:14:54,299 --> 00:14:55,820
messages before I show you how to

598
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:56,539
use AI,

599
00:14:56,549 --> 00:14:58,409
because if you're using AI without

600
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:00,379
the actual skill underneath,

601
00:15:00,379 --> 00:15:01,419
you're not going to know if the AI

602
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:01,659
is

603
00:15:01,669 --> 00:15:03,149
giving you good or bad outputs and

604
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:04,539
it's going to be pointless.

605
00:15:04,539 --> 00:15:06,220
So let's dive into the actual AI.

606
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:08,299
So you can basically supercharge

607
00:15:08,379 --> 00:15:10,539
your messaging and create it in

608
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:13,340
seconds, um, with automation,

609
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:14,539
even though I just gave you

610
00:15:14,539 --> 00:15:15,419
winning scripts.

611
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,940
Um, if you want to test new stuff,

612
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:17,809
this AI will show you

613
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:19,230
exactly how to do it.

614
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:20,720
So let's dive into the AI

615
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,100
copywriting video coming up next.
