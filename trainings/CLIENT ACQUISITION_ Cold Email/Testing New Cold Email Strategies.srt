1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:01,830
Okay, let's say that you run a

2
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:03,120
campaign and your inbox is

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,719
completely empty and you're not

4
00:00:04,719 --> 00:00:06,169
getting any responses like the one

5
00:00:06,179 --> 00:00:07,509
I went over in the last video.

6
00:00:07,509 --> 00:00:09,070
That means your copy is just not

7
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:10,900
good enough and you need to update

8
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:11,109
it

9
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:12,789
So here's how to update your cop

10
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,509
your copy.

11
00:00:13,509 --> 00:00:15,189
So you actually fill your inbox

12
00:00:15,189 --> 00:00:15,910
with replies

13
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:19,980
Here's an example of a campaign

14
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:21,609
angle that did not work at

15
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:23,679
All to the point where I had to

16
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:24,500
turn it off

17
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:27,760
So here's how to test

18
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,500
New angles for your campaign,

19
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:31,899
right?

20
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:33,429
Because here's the reality of

21
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:35,100
things not every single piece of

22
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:35,259
copy

23
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,689
You work is gonna get results.

24
00:00:36,689 --> 00:00:37,439
It's just not gonna happen

25
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:39,350
But that's part of the game and

26
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:41,310
the real good cold emailers know

27
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,840
how to troubleshoot and test new

28
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,579
messaging to get things back on

29
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:45,600
track

30
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,829
So what would I do in this

31
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:48,310
scenario to get this angle to

32
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:48,840
work?

33
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,390
I would just make it a lot

34
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:51,859
simpler, right?

35
00:00:51,859 --> 00:00:54,630
I think this call to action of a

36
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:56,359
video going over a cold email

37
00:00:56,359 --> 00:00:56,359
strategy

38
00:00:56,359 --> 00:00:57,560
Email strategy for you and some

39
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,979
results we've got for web design

40
00:00:58,979 --> 00:01:00,259
agencies is a little bit too

41
00:01:00,729 --> 00:01:02,549
Detailed so what I would do as a

42
00:01:02,549 --> 00:01:05,090
test is something like hey first

43
00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:05,379
name

44
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:06,790
Icebreaker.

45
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:09,560
Are you looking for more web?

46
00:01:10,019 --> 00:01:13,219
Design clients right now

47
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,700
I can help you generate 10 to 12

48
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:18,829
new leads a month

49
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:22,079
looking

50
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,049
for a new website

51
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:29,319
All from a cold outreach campaign

52
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:32,310
I recorded a video

53
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:34,530
Explaining what this campaign

54
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:35,640
would look like

55
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:39,939
Mind if I share the video here,

56
00:01:39,939 --> 00:01:40,150
right?

57
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:41,599
So the first thing that I do

58
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:43,269
whenever a piece of copy is not

59
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:43,939
working is

60
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,299
Is I rethink the call to action

61
00:01:46,299 --> 00:01:47,920
and make it much simpler because

62
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,700
chances are the person just

63
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,719
doesn't know or they don't see the

64
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:52,260
value in

65
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:54,299
Saying yes to what I'm asking a

66
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:55,799
video going over a cold email

67
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:57,049
strategy for me and some results

68
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,120
for clients like mine

69
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,750
It's a little bit long-winded.

70
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:01,000
It's a little bit, you know

71
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,420
open-ended instead

72
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:04,239
Hey, I can get you 10 to 12 new

73
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:05,129
leads a month looking for a new

74
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:06,500
website all from cold email

75
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,730
I recorded a video explaining what

76
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:09,090
this would look like mind if I

77
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:10,580
share the video here

78
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:12,680
Much more simplified and easy to

79
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,280
consume

80
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,250
That's just how you're gonna get

81
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:17,539
better results with your campaigns

82
00:02:17,539 --> 00:02:19,699
and even still this might not work

83
00:02:19,699 --> 00:02:21,139
You're just gonna have to test and

84
00:02:21,139 --> 00:02:22,669
test and mix and match and test

85
00:02:22,669 --> 00:02:24,490
different things until you land on

86
00:02:24,569 --> 00:02:25,400
a winning angle

87
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,819
like I have here

88
00:02:27,819 --> 00:02:30,310
With 20 positive replies from

89
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:33,219
email 1d compared to 1 3 and 10

90
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:35,800
Or 1 3 and 4 on the other angles,

91
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,400
right?

92
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,960
So I literally did this in real

93
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,530
time and

94
00:02:38,949 --> 00:02:40,419
Found that this angle didn't

95
00:02:40,419 --> 00:02:41,250
really work

96
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:45,139
This angle didn't really work

97
00:02:45,169 --> 00:02:47,780
This angle didn't really work, but

98
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:49,770
this angle email D worked really

99
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:50,289
well.

100
00:02:50,289 --> 00:02:51,340
Why did it work so well?

101
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:52,719
Are you taking on new clients

102
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:53,419
right now?

103
00:02:53,419 --> 00:02:55,090
We can deliver you 10 and 12 new

104
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:56,460
prospects a month all from cold

105
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:57,909
email looking for a new website

106
00:02:58,819 --> 00:03:00,370
Want to see a video breaking down

107
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:01,810
our strategy and some results

108
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:03,310
we've gotten for our web design

109
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:04,639
clients, right?

110
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:06,939
So can I sit here and tell you

111
00:03:06,939 --> 00:03:07,280
why?

112
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,389
This angle did significantly

113
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:11,819
better than this and this and this

114
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:13,960
I can't I really can't because

115
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,460
sometimes clients will come to me

116
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:17,080
With insanely long cold emails

117
00:03:17,189 --> 00:03:19,050
that are just not well written and

118
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:20,020
I can tell right away

119
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,469
This isn't gonna work, but

120
00:03:21,469 --> 00:03:23,030
sometimes I couldn't tell you why

121
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:24,509
certain things work and certain

122
00:03:24,509 --> 00:03:25,879
things don't so that's why you

123
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:26,349
just have to

124
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,539
Consistently test and find new

125
00:03:28,539 --> 00:03:30,629
ways to to frame your offer,

126
00:03:30,629 --> 00:03:31,120
right?

127
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,270
I'm using an icebreaker.

128
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:34,509
I'm not using a question

129
00:03:34,509 --> 00:03:35,439
icebreaker here

130
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:38,120
I'm not using a question here.

131
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,539
I'm not using a question here

132
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:41,060
So maybe this angle I was using

133
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:42,270
the question icebreaker to get

134
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,300
people to answer and it was

135
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,159
working, right?

136
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:46,080
Maybe the subject line was better

137
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,599
quick question didn't work

138
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,300
quick question didn't work, right?

139
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:50,740
So maybe

140
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,509
It was the opener being a question

141
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,740
um

142
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:57,379
Maybe it was the fact that I said

143
00:03:57,379 --> 00:04:00,620
10 to 12 new prospects a month

144
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:03,400
looking for a new website build

145
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:06,060
compared to 12 new leads a month

146
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,659
compared to

147
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,699
Yeah, so like literally

148
00:04:09,699 --> 00:04:11,610
Cold email is a funny funny game

149
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:13,550
because all the angles that are

150
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,590
well written look like this three

151
00:04:15,669 --> 00:04:16,379
sentences

152
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,000
nothing to them really

153
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:19,019
um

154
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:20,639
But some just get better responses

155
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:22,139
than others like you can see i've

156
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:24,910
reached out to 7600 people and

157
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:25,980
i've got 20

158
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:28,610
People to say yes one and every

159
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:30,990
one in every 384 people wants more

160
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:31,740
information

161
00:04:31,779 --> 00:04:34,040
And that is a very very solid

162
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:35,620
Throughput that I should keep

163
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:37,339
working on and keep building on

164
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,250
This one is a clear loser

165
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,100
I only got one response out of

166
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,519
1100 people

167
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:43,480
um

168
00:04:43,939 --> 00:04:46,480
This one three responses out of

169
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,589
1100 this one four responses out

170
00:04:48,589 --> 00:04:49,370
of 1100

171
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:51,629
On paper, these are actually not

172
00:04:51,629 --> 00:04:53,129
bad, but I turned them off a long

173
00:04:53,129 --> 00:04:54,839
time ago and people just trickled

174
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:55,470
in over time

175
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,600
So when I updated this it was like

176
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,939
10 to 1 to 1 to 1 and d was a

177
00:04:59,939 --> 00:05:00,839
clear winner

178
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:02,459
So I shut everything else off and

179
00:05:02,459 --> 00:05:04,160
just ran with the winning angle,

180
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:04,490
right?

181
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,810
So when you're testing

182
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:11,550
What to look out for when testing

183
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:12,500
new messaging

184
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:16,339
Changing up the icebreaker

185
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,100
Should it be a question?

186
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,199
Should it be?

187
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:24,759
Statement like

188
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:26,139
saw

189
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,029
You're in charge of

190
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:31,420
Company names

191
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:33,790
Marketing like should it be one of

192
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:34,540
those options?

193
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:35,600
Um

194
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:40,100
Testing new call to actions

195
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,699
Should you pitch a video?

196
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,000
Or a sample piece of work?

197
00:05:48,459 --> 00:05:49,220
Or

198
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,800
A video going over a specific

199
00:05:53,259 --> 00:05:54,899
Strategy, right?

200
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,079
Testing new offers

201
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:00,920
Offers

202
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,379
Pitching

203
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:05,920
Um calls versus leads versus sales

204
00:06:06,379 --> 00:06:07,339
Verse

205
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,250
Prospects

206
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:09,660
Um

207
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,160
Right, so those are the main

208
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:11,980
things you want to switch

209
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:14,060
What did I test in this angle that

210
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,500
got such good results?

211
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,949
It was the icebreaker that was

212
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:19,029
different and it's the call to

213
00:06:19,029 --> 00:06:20,420
action that's different and the 10

214
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,920
to 12 new prospects offer

215
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,040
That's different.

216
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:23,259
So

217
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,779
You know

218
00:06:24,779 --> 00:06:26,170
This is probably irrelevant to you

219
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:27,459
when you're just starting out

220
00:06:27,459 --> 00:06:28,689
But once you guys start running

221
00:06:28,689 --> 00:06:29,199
campaigns

222
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:30,870
Um and seeing results come through

223
00:06:31,379 --> 00:06:32,990
And testing and trying stuff for

224
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:33,579
new clients

225
00:06:33,579 --> 00:06:34,990
You're going to come back to this

226
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:36,379
video like oh what christian is

227
00:06:36,379 --> 00:06:37,449
saying makes a lot of sense

228
00:06:37,459 --> 00:06:38,839
And I need to keep testing

229
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:39,879
different things

230
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:41,430
That i'm saying to get better

231
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:41,899
results

232
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:43,500
Like you can see here

233
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,459
In email too, i'm pitching a video

234
00:06:45,459 --> 00:06:46,180
straight off the rip

235
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,420
I created a video going over a

236
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,779
cold email strategy for you

237
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:50,230
Whereas in the other one i'm

238
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:50,689
testing

239
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,889
An offer we can deliver you 10 to

240
00:06:52,889 --> 00:06:53,709
12 prospects

241
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:55,810
Case study video pitch and this

242
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:56,560
one is doing better

243
00:06:57,019 --> 00:06:58,019
Because it's clear

244
00:06:58,019 --> 00:07:00,149
That 10 to 12 new prospects per

245
00:07:00,149 --> 00:07:01,639
month interested in a new website

246
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:03,180
build all from cold email is a

247
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:03,899
very very

00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,680

say yes to so

251
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:09,939
Hopefully this was valuable to

252
00:07:09,939 --> 00:07:11,149
show you guys what you need to be

253
00:07:11,149 --> 00:07:12,629
testing with your messaging to get

254
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:13,720
better results

255
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,810
We're going to go into the

256
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:16,399
targeting later on but I want to

257
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:17,540
give you a master class in

258
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:18,509

people to raise their hand

264
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:28,120

265
00:07:28,149 --> 00:07:28,439
phone

266
00:07:28,899 --> 00:07:30,310
Because if you see a lot of my

267
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:30,879
angles

00:07:35,269 --> 00:07:35,660

271
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:37,279
