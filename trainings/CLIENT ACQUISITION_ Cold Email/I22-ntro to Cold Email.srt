You just learned the agency path

27
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,789
that you want to go down whether

28
00:00:40,789 --> 00:00:42,250
it's email marketing or content or

29
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:42,960
funnels and ads

30
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,070
No matter which one you chose

31
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,939
These next couple videos are going

32
00:00:46,939 --> 00:00:48,259
to show you how to actually

33
00:00:48,369 --> 00:00:50,090
generate interest in what you're

34
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:50,619
selling

35
00:00:51,179 --> 00:00:52,619
Without wasting a ton of time

36
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:54,320
You know posting in facebook

37
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,439
groups and posting on social media

38
00:00:56,439 --> 00:00:57,880
and waiting for your first couple

39
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,240
calls to come through the door

40
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,789
No, you're going to go on offense

41
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:03,490
and reach out to people every

42
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:04,200
single day

43
00:01:04,209 --> 00:01:05,650
Hundreds if not thousands of

44
00:01:05,719 --> 00:01:07,290
people every single day to get

45
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:09,049
people interested in what you're

46
00:01:09,049 --> 00:01:09,579
selling

47
00:01:09,579 --> 00:01:11,530
So you actually gain momentum

48
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:13,840
quickly and start signing clients

49
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,370
And collecting your first couple

50
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:16,670
of invoices because there's

51
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,420
nothing worse

52
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:19,469
From experience then starting your

53
00:01:19,469 --> 00:01:21,359
own agency being excited to go and

54
00:01:21,379 --> 00:01:21,959
you know

55
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:23,409
Get your first couple clients and

56
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,299
then having no idea where to look

57
00:01:25,299 --> 00:01:27,040
to actually find those clients

58
00:01:27,129 --> 00:01:28,599
because four years ago

59
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:30,629
I didn't know about cold email at

60
00:01:30,629 --> 00:01:32,590
all and I was using facebook

61
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:33,980
groups and you know

62
00:01:34,569 --> 00:01:35,079
basically

63
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:36,930
Relying on luck to to find a

64
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,739
client and guess what?

65
00:01:38,739 --> 00:01:40,349
I didn't find any clients going

66
00:01:40,349 --> 00:01:41,670
down that route posting in

67
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:42,799
facebook groups every day

68
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,430
connecting with people on social

69
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:45,000
media

70
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,109
Providing value and hoping that

71
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,049
people dm me that stuff never

72
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:51,030
worked what actually works is cold

73
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:51,560
outreach

74
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,900
Dms emails cold calls linkedin

75
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,939
messages and going on offense to

76
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,500
find your first couple clients

77
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,560
So I want to show you how to

78
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:01,049
actually write a really good

79
00:02:01,069 --> 00:02:02,140
outreach message

80
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:03,959
Using the offer that daniel has

81
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:05,420
taught you using some of the

82
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:06,959
practices that i'll show you how

83
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:07,109
to

84
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,430
You know deploy with emails or

85
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:11,460
video pitches over emails free

86
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:12,810
samples of your work

87
00:02:13,449 --> 00:02:15,319
guarantees risk reversals

88
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:17,060
Basically making it as stupid

89
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:18,960
simple as possible for you to run

90
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,259
an outreach campaign

91
00:02:20,259 --> 00:02:22,270
and sign your first couple clients

92
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:22,780
because

93
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:24,669
The thing that catapults your

94
00:02:24,669 --> 00:02:26,780
entire business journey is going

95
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:27,800
from zero to one

96
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,409
You know starting an agency at

97
00:02:29,409 --> 00:02:31,189
zero and going all the way to one

98
00:02:31,189 --> 00:02:32,919
signing a client because once you

99
00:02:33,009 --> 00:02:34,259
sign your first client and get

100
00:02:34,259 --> 00:02:34,400
them

101
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,270
Good results it builds this really

102
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:38,330
big snowball of more confidence

103
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,590
more experience case studies word

104
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:41,539
of mouth referrals

105
00:02:41,539 --> 00:02:43,150
And as you keep snowballing it

106
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:45,150
becomes easier to get clients.

107
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,560
But right now where you sit

108
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,139
Is you know crunch time because

109
00:02:48,139 --> 00:02:49,639
you need to go out and sign your

110
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:51,050
first client if you want to stay

111
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,460
motivated and actually

112
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:54,300
You know grow your business right

113
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,479
because the biggest

114
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:57,219
The biggest hesitation point that

115
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:58,860
I see with any new business owner

116
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,419
is they just don't know where to

117
00:03:00,419 --> 00:03:00,819
start

118
00:03:00,819 --> 00:03:03,139
Okay, I know email marketing now

119
00:03:03,139 --> 00:03:04,699
How do I actually go out and sign

120
00:03:04,699 --> 00:03:06,259
a client and they just sit there

121
00:03:06,259 --> 00:03:06,939
and you know

122
00:03:06,939 --> 00:03:08,000
Procrastinate and they're

123
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:09,379
paralyzed with analysis because

124
00:03:09,379 --> 00:03:10,639
they just don't know what to do

125
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,740
I'm going to remove all of those

126
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:14,349
Self-limiting beliefs and doubts

127
00:03:14,409 --> 00:03:15,669
and just give you the exact

128
00:03:15,669 --> 00:03:17,419
framework that you need to follow

129
00:03:17,419 --> 00:03:19,439
To sign your first couple clients

130
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:20,849
I'm going to give you the

131
00:03:20,849 --> 00:03:22,830
principles of writing a good cold

132
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:25,080
outreach message so that you have

133
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,500
An understanding of it because I

134
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,780
would rather teach you how to

135
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,199
write them on your own before I

136
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:30,740
introduce you to the ai that we

137
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:31,000
have

138
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:31,879
Available for you

139
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:33,770
And then i'm going to show you how

140
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:35,550
to use the ai to write really good

141
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:37,300
outreach messages to do research

142
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,060
on companies

143
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:40,550
And to basically, you know make

144
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:41,210
your life easier

145
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:43,139
When you're doing the outreach, so

146
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:44,469
i'm going to teach you how to fish

147
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:45,590
and then i'm going to give you a

148
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:47,180
fishing pole that is supercharged

149
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:49,300
To catch a lot of fish at once so

150
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:51,419
that you know how to do it if you

151
00:03:51,419 --> 00:03:52,620
had to go back to the old way

152
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:53,979
But you're also going to be able

153
00:03:53,979 --> 00:03:55,400
to take that knowledge and apply

154
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:55,680
it to

155
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,539
The ai supercharged fishing pole

156
00:03:57,539 --> 00:03:59,240
that i'm going to give you later

157
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,020
on in this video module

158
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:02,620
so long story short

159
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,360
These next couple videos are going

160
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:04,939
to show you

161
00:04:04,939 --> 00:04:06,960
How to write really good outreach

162
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,870
messages and craft good offers

163
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,979
like 10 calls a month guaranteed

164
00:04:10,979 --> 00:04:11,699
or you don't pay

165
00:04:11,699 --> 00:04:13,270
50k from your email list

166
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:13,979
guaranteed

167
00:04:14,539 --> 00:04:16,790
Video pitches lead magnets

168
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,389
Basically all the fundamentals

169
00:04:18,389 --> 00:04:19,970
that you need to get results right

170
00:04:20,089 --> 00:04:20,639
off the bat

171
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:21,879
Even if you have no experience and

172
00:04:21,889 --> 00:04:23,040
even if you're brand new and if

173
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:24,079
you're watching this that's

174
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:24,779
probably the case

175
00:04:24,779 --> 00:04:26,160
for you, so

176
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,509
Let's dive in i'm going to start

177
00:04:28,509 --> 00:04:29,720
out with some copywriting

178
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,240
techniques and methodologies

179
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,850
Then i'm going to show you how to

180
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:34,620
use ai to supercharge your copy

181
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,350
Then i'm going to show you how to

182
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:38,449
do individual dms and emails mass

183
00:04:38,449 --> 00:04:39,990
outreach where you can send

184
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:41,060
thousands of emails a day

185
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,839
Using technology and domains and

186
00:04:42,889 --> 00:04:44,500
inboxes and ascending tool

187
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,079
I'm going to show you how to get a

188
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:46,839
list of leads

189
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:48,730
Because the big thing that I hear

190
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:50,269
is like where do I actually find a

191
00:04:50,269 --> 00:04:51,600
list of people to reach out to?

192
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:53,790
You're in luck because i'm also a

193
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:55,399
co-founder at list kit which is a

194
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:57,430

and go on offense

209
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,540
Instead of just waiting around for

210
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:23,889
your first couple meetings to fall

211
00:05:23,889 --> 00:05:24,459
