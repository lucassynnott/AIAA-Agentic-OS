1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,700
All right.

2
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:03,060
So what we have here is a

3
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,500
financial analysis of a lead gen

4
00:00:05,639 --> 00:00:06,400
system.

5
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,619
Let me try to make this smaller.

6
00:00:08,619 --> 00:00:10,230
So now what we have here is we

7
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:12,019
have automated cold email.

8
00:00:12,019 --> 00:00:12,679
We have free work.

9
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:13,869
So I'm just going to quickly walk

10
00:00:13,869 --> 00:00:14,640
you through these.

11
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:15,830
I'm going to give you access to

12
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:17,030
this sheet so you can fuck with

13
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:17,350
it.

14
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:18,559
You just got to make a copy of it.

15
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,640
So like what's going on here?

16
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:22,300
So this is simulating costs,

17
00:00:22,649 --> 00:00:23,699
result projections and ROI

18
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,780
calculations based on automated

19
00:00:25,789 --> 00:00:26,699
cold email.

20
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:29,039
So the bright green ones are ones

21
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:29,980
you can influence.

22
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:32,039
So let's assume we're sending 500

23
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:32,780
cold email.

24
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:34,679
And this will dynamically update.

25
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:36,619
So I think that to 800, all this

26
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:37,670
changes, right?

27
00:00:37,689 --> 00:00:39,689
So we're going to assume $500.

28
00:00:39,689 --> 00:00:41,649
I'm sorry, 500 cold emails per

29
00:00:41,649 --> 00:00:43,719
day, 28, 70 days in a month.

30
00:00:43,859 --> 00:00:45,270
This is what this comes out to in

31
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:46,200
cost per month.

32
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,899
Now, if we assume a 3% response

33
00:00:47,899 --> 00:00:49,609
rate, a 20% positive response

34
00:00:49,969 --> 00:00:51,679
rate, you get 30% of those 28

35
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:53,560
positive responses to book a call.

36
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:55,270
That means you got eight calls.

37
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,899
Your cost per call is $59.

38
00:00:56,899 --> 00:00:58,560
You close at 20%, you close two

39
00:00:58,750 --> 00:00:59,979
people.

40
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,229
So if your average monthly revenue

41
00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:02,289
for each client, even if your

42
00:01:02,289 --> 00:01:03,500
performance basis, this counts

43
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,400
your performance basis was $2,000.

44
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,400
You have a 70% margin and your

45
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,090
average customer stays for five

46
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:09,540
months.

47
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,329
That means your, your LTGP, your

48
00:01:11,329 --> 00:01:13,060
lifetime gross profit per person

49
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:14,299
is $7,000.

50
00:01:14,299 --> 00:01:17,069
It costs you $296 to acquire them.

51
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:18,430
Now this is not accounting for

52
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:19,060
your time.

53
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:20,870
This is not accounting for time.

54
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:22,290
So you have to understand that as

55
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:23,390
cold email is pretty time

56
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:23,939
intensive.

57
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:25,629
That means your LTGP to CAC is 24,

58
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:26,099
right?

59
00:01:26,099 --> 00:01:27,540
So that's, that's like stupidly

60
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:28,120
good.

61
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,599
Um, now the, the problem though,

62
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:32,719
what most people don't understand

63
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:36,670
is, is when you have, when, when

64
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:38,760
numbers like this, like a response

65
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,870
rate is this low or a positive

66
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:41,980
response rate is 20, this severe,

67
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:43,450
like if you put, put five here,

68
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:45,030
this severely impacts the

69
00:01:45,129 --> 00:01:45,989
cashflow.

70
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,379
So like, let's, let's, let's just

71
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:48,549
look at this if we're, if we're at

72
00:01:48,629 --> 00:01:49,019
3%.

73
00:01:49,019 --> 00:01:50,760
So what people got to understand

74
00:01:51,189 --> 00:01:53,069
is like week, week one, because

75
00:01:53,209 --> 00:01:55,090
you got your sales cycle, you

76
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,219
can't influence this by, by the

77
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:57,780
way.

78
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:58,790
I didn't, I did not make this

79
00:01:58,790 --> 00:01:59,340
editable.

80
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:00,319
So you like, you pay for the

81
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:01,349
stuff, you have the two week

82
00:02:01,349 --> 00:02:01,810
warmup.

83
00:02:01,819 --> 00:02:03,239
So it's not even until

84
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:05,510
theoretically month six that you

85
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:07,920
start signing clients, right?

86
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,639
So 2,352 in week six, six weeks

87
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:13,300
later, right?

88
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,819
And then now week 10, you got

89
00:02:14,849 --> 00:02:16,840
clients week 14, you got clients.

90
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,800
And then that shit goes all the

91
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:21,860
way down over to, to, to week 20.

92
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:22,789
You see what I mean?

93
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,009
So what that means is that this is

94
00:02:24,009 --> 00:02:24,860
how this works out.

95
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:27,020
So month one, negative 593, month

96
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:29,840
two, 1800, month three, 4,000,

97
00:02:30,009 --> 00:02:32,080
month four, 9,000, month five,

98
00:02:32,139 --> 00:02:33,419
18,000.

99
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:34,669
So it's like, if you're running

100
00:02:34,669 --> 00:02:36,060
this one, you go negative, you're

101
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,500
not making shit for six weeks.

102
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,159
And then even when you do start to

103
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,349
make something, it's not a lot at

104
00:02:40,349 --> 00:02:40,719
all.

105
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:42,080
Month three, isn't a lot at all.

106
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,300
And you don't even start making

107
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,610
any kind of substantial return in

108
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:45,840
any capacity whatsoever until

109
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,500
month four.

110
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,020
You see what I mean?

111
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:49,620
And then month five is when shit

112
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,419
starts to get, this doesn't

113
00:02:51,689 --> 00:02:52,800
account for churn.

114
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,150
Churn is not in this calculation

115
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:56,879
right here, right?

116
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,229
Now you can see over here, all of

117
00:02:58,229 --> 00:02:59,550
the, all the influenceable

118
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:00,139
variables.

119
00:03:00,139 --> 00:03:02,150
I put what they're influenced by

120
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:03,759
over here on the right.

121
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:04,750
So it's like a cheat sheet for

122
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:04,900
you.

123
00:03:06,539 --> 00:03:07,879
But this is how this works.

124
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:09,379
So if you fuck with this, you can

125
00:03:09,379 --> 00:03:10,939
see like what happens over 20

126
00:03:10,939 --> 00:03:11,300
weeks,

127
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:13,240
because now if you send this up to

128
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,879
3000, like what happens now, now

129
00:03:15,889 --> 00:03:18,509
you're making 52 grand over 20

130
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:22,780
weeks instead of 34 grand.

131
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,120
You see what I mean?

132
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:25,580
Like, this is, this is how this

133
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,050
works, but you just have to be

134
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,580
like severely cognizant of what's

135
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:29,219
going on here.

136
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,330
Now, now, as I said earlier, this

137
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:33,080
does not count for your time.

138
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,599
Like, and, and just like the

139
00:03:34,729 --> 00:03:36,229
stupid fuckery that goes on with,

140
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,699
with, with cold email.

141
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:38,969
Like obviously cold email works,

142
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:40,389
but like, it's a pain in the

143
00:03:40,389 --> 00:03:42,240
fucking ass to do that shit.

144
00:03:42,259 --> 00:03:44,069
Like it really actually is to do

145
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,379
some high volume shit.

146
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:46,860
Now let's compare it.

147
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:47,949
Like, if you don't want to do

148
00:03:47,949 --> 00:03:49,400
that, like, let's compare this to,

149
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:50,120
to free work.

150
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,319
So like, I got another sheet over

151
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:52,180
here for free work.

152
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,789
So now the mechanisms to reach

153
00:03:53,789 --> 00:03:55,280
clients in this are manual cold

154
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,939
email, manual IG DMs, manual

155
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:58,620
LinkedIn DMs, and manual Twitter

156
00:03:58,729 --> 00:03:59,000
DMs.

157
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,360
Cause they're all $0 each in hard

158
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,050
costs.

159
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:03,120
Obviously it has your time.

160
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,759
Now we can make some assumptions

161
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:05,210
here.

162
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,349
How much does it cost you to

163
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:07,639
fulfill the free work?

164
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:09,740
And this would be the equivalent

165
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,830
of buying leads on cold email or

166
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:12,419
ad spend.

167
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,759
You see what I mean?

168
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:16,589
It costs me $100 to create the

169
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:19,120
free piece of work, right?

170
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,689
Because you have to imagine that

171
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:22,100
you would outsource the creation

172
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:23,399
of the free piece of work.

173
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:24,800
So if you're a Clavio email agency

174
00:04:24,899 --> 00:04:26,149
or some shit, and you're like,

175
00:04:26,149 --> 00:04:27,839
Hey, I'll design you a free email.

176
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:28,819
Right?

177
00:04:28,819 --> 00:04:30,220
It might, you might have to pay

178
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:31,839
your editor or your, I'm sorry,

179
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:33,139
your designer and your copywriter

180
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:34,279
a hundred dollars to get that one.

181
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,230
You see what I mean by this?

182
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,009
Now, if you do, if you do, uh, so

183
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:41,800
how do we, now the free work to

184
00:04:42,129 --> 00:04:42,480
meeting, right?

185
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,579
Let's say it's 35%.

186
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:44,750
And then the people you do get on

187
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,019
there, they closed at 40% because

188
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:46,920
they already see your work.

189
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,120
Now they probably used it.

190
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:48,540
Right.

191
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:49,769
And now you're closing them for an

192
00:04:49,769 --> 00:04:51,319
average of $2,000 a month.

193
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:53,420
Your gross profit on the 2000 is

194
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,120
70% on average to say for six

195
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:55,769
months.

196
00:04:55,779 --> 00:04:57,100
That would mean that your lifetime

197
00:04:57,329 --> 00:04:58,550
gross profit is 8,400.

198
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,170
And now you can fuck with this

199
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:01,680
variable by like one, how much

200
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:03,319
does it cost you to do it?

201
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:04,300
You know what I mean?

202
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:05,569
And then that influences the cash

203
00:05:05,569 --> 00:05:06,100
over here.

204
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,879
So like 100, let's just go back to

205
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:08,339
this.

206
00:05:08,339 --> 00:05:10,170
Now let's say if you're doing 15

207
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:11,889
pieces a month, you'd have to be

208
00:05:11,889 --> 00:05:14,120
spending $1,500 per month.

209
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,860
And with these numbers, you'd be

210
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:17,269
getting five calls booked and

211
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:18,939
you'd be closing two people.

212
00:05:18,939 --> 00:05:20,750
And your cost to acquire customer

213
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:22,500
will be $714, right?

214
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,500
Now, if you're comparing this

215
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,740
against cold email here, you got

216
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:29,160
to understand that if like this,

217
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,670
this shit, this right here, this

218
00:05:30,779 --> 00:05:32,420
could very well be like fucking

219
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:32,920
1%.

220
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,699
And this could be like 10%.

221
00:05:34,699 --> 00:05:35,899
And this could be like 10%.

222
00:05:35,899 --> 00:05:36,439
You see what I mean?

223
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:39,699
So it could send your fucking,

224
00:05:39,709 --> 00:05:42,079
like you would need to send like

225
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,519
such a substantial and then the

226
00:05:44,529 --> 00:05:46,930
cost per call and the cat goes up

227
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,000
here too.

228
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,600
You see what I mean?

229
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,519
So you got to be cognizant of

230
00:05:52,649 --> 00:05:53,040
that.

231
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:53,839
If like cold email isn't

232
00:05:54,009 --> 00:05:54,860
specifically working for you,

233
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:56,139
you're like, okay, well, let's try

234
00:05:56,209 --> 00:05:57,509
a different marketing channel.

235
00:05:57,519 --> 00:05:58,500
You see what I mean?

236
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,920
So like let's try the free work

237
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:00,839
thing, right?

238
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:02,300
And now you can influence this.

239
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,620
But another thing you have to be

240
00:06:03,819 --> 00:06:04,850
cognizant of is that you have a

241
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:05,439
sales cycle.

242
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:06,379
You see what I mean?

243
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,970
So like what happens, like week

244
00:06:08,029 --> 00:06:09,449
one, losing money, week two,

245
00:06:09,449 --> 00:06:11,110
losing money, week three, losing

246
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:11,639
money.

247
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:13,160
And at this point, because you're

248
00:06:13,189 --> 00:06:14,689
a human, you're like, fuck, this

249
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,600
isn't working.

250
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,040
I've been doing this for 20 days,

251
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,870
spending my own money in my own

252
00:06:19,939 --> 00:06:20,360
time.

253
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:21,860
And then finally, you fucking

254
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:23,069
close someone in week four.

255
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:24,160
You see what I mean?

256
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,569
Like that's how that works, right?

257
00:06:26,579 --> 00:06:27,779
And then if we model this again,

258
00:06:27,779 --> 00:06:29,589
it's month one, $1,400, month two,

259
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:31,839
$4,000, month three, $7,000, month

260
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:33,899
four, $10,000, and then $13,000,

261
00:06:33,899 --> 00:06:34,920
and then $16,000 a month.

262
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:35,540
You see what I mean?

263
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,370
And this is calculating the gross

264
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:39,199
profit and the cost, right?

265
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,620
So like now, what stops you from

266
00:06:41,629 --> 00:06:45,180
doing this though is this $1,500.

267
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,540
They don't want to sit here and

268
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:47,980
lose money for three weeks.

269
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,230
Cause you're like, oh, that's not

270
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:50,410
going to work, but it will, if you

271
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:51,800
know your numbers, if you just

272
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:53,389
know the numbers, if you just

273
00:06:53,389 --> 00:06:54,819
track the numbers, you can model

274
00:06:54,819 --> 00:06:56,009
what's going to happen.

275
00:06:56,019 --> 00:06:56,680
You see what I mean?

276
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,980
So like, let's send this to 30.

277
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,389
What happens now?

278
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:00,600
Month one is 2,800.

279
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,410
Month two is fucking 8,000.

280
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,160
You see what I mean?

281
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,870
Like you can, you can influence

282
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:05,680
this stuff.

283
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,360
And this is, this, this tends to

284
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,480
be easier to scale.

285
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:09,920
And you can obviously mix these

286
00:07:10,069 --> 00:07:11,420
two, and then you put a mechanism

287
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:12,769
to reach clients and it's like

288
00:07:12,769 --> 00:07:13,970
automated cold email.

289
00:07:14,019 --> 00:07:15,100
You see what I mean?

290
00:07:15,579 --> 00:07:17,389
Now the only, the only caveat you

291
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:19,310
have to, you have to be cognizant

292
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,980
of here is that if you're doing

293
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,860
high volume cold email, you might

294
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:23,750
start reaching a substantial

295
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:24,689
amount of shitty clients.

296
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:26,120
You really only want to be doing

297
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:27,370
this for like fairly high level

298
00:07:27,449 --> 00:07:27,870
people.

299
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:29,709
So you are going to do this with

300
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:30,649
cold email.

301
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:31,970
You want to make sure it's 10 plus

302
00:07:32,209 --> 00:07:33,170
employees, but you really don't

303
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:34,209
want to be doing, you don't do

304
00:07:34,209 --> 00:07:35,269
free work for people who can't

305
00:07:35,269 --> 00:07:35,899
afford it.

306
00:07:35,899 --> 00:07:37,149
Don't do free work for poor

307
00:07:37,449 --> 00:07:38,620
people, but don't do that.

308
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:39,670
Some random person has a hundred

309
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:40,180
followers.

310
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:41,639
Don't fucking do that shit.

311
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,620
They have to be making money.

312
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:44,980
They should be making $10,000 per

313
00:07:45,149 --> 00:07:45,430
month or more.

314
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:46,120
You see what I mean?

315
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,500
But you can just play with these

316
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:48,199
variables.

317
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:50,439
And like, what if I did literally

318
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:52,670
fucking three pieces of free work

319
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:53,939
a day, 90.

320
00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:57,230
So that would mean you're spending

321
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,810
$9,000 a month to have this shit

322
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:00,439
done.

323
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:01,470
And like, let's say this was even

324
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:01,980
150.

325
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:06,230
You're spending $13,500 per month.

326
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,050
Like you legit, you go negative

327
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,959
fucking hard before you even sign

328
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:11,399
someone right here.

329
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:12,639
Look at week one, two, and three.

330
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:13,420
Hard.

331
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:14,779
Like real negative.

332
00:08:14,779 --> 00:08:17,329
Like $10,000 negative.

333
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:17,939
Right?

334
00:08:17,939 --> 00:08:18,800
But what happens?

335
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,930
Like you fucking rocket yourself

336
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:22,209
in month two, month three, month

337
00:08:22,209 --> 00:08:23,360
four, month five, month seven.

338
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:23,879
You see what I mean?

339
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:25,100
This is what happens.

340
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:28,160
So I'll give you the link to this.

341
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:29,860
You just kind of duplicate it.

342
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:30,600
Just make a copy.

343
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,970
You're only going to have viewer

344
00:08:32,149 --> 00:08:32,990
access duplicated.

345
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,899
Then you have editor access.

346
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:34,990
Only fuck with the green

347
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:35,679
variables.

348
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:36,600
You see what I mean?

349
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,440
Those are the ones that you can

350
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:37,918
influence.

351
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:38,870
And they're influenced by all of

352
00:08:38,889 --> 00:08:39,460
this over here.

353
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:40,120
And that's it.

354
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:40,519
All right.

355
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:40,798
Love you.

356
00:08:40,798 --> 00:08:40,918
Bye.
