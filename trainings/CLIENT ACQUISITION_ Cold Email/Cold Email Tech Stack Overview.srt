1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,850
Okay this video is gonna be about

2
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:03,899
the tech stack required to run a

3
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:04,139
mass

4
00:00:04,139 --> 00:00:05,790
outreach cold email campaign

5
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:07,509
because up to this point you now

6
00:00:07,509 --> 00:00:08,519
know how to write

7
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:10,480
a really good email script and you

8
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,320
know how to make a good offer over

9
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:12,800
email to

10
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,519
get people interested the purpose

11
00:00:14,609 --> 00:00:15,970
of this video is to show you how

12
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:16,120
to

13
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,660
basically reach out to as many

14
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:19,890
people as you physically can using

15
00:00:19,899 --> 00:00:20,879
domains

16
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:22,989
inboxes ascending tool a lead list

17
00:00:22,989 --> 00:00:25,140
basically different automations

18
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:25,440
and

19
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,929
software so that you can reach out

20
00:00:26,929 --> 00:00:28,309
to thousands of people without

21
00:00:28,309 --> 00:00:28,750
sending

22
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,609
emails one by one by hand because

23
00:00:30,699 --> 00:00:32,780
nobody has time for that and you

24
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:33,079
know quite

25
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:34,640
frankly it would be miserable to

26
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,380
do this outreach one by one so

27
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:37,520
here we go right

28
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,229
first and foremost you need a

29
00:00:39,229 --> 00:00:41,079
sending software like the one I

30
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:42,020
have pulled up

31
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:44,140
in front of me here you can either

32
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,929
go through list kit which is the

33
00:00:45,929 --> 00:00:46,100
data

34
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:47,820
company that I'm a co-founder at

35
00:00:47,909 --> 00:00:49,679
and Daniel also in the program is

36
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:50,299
a co-founder

37
00:00:50,299 --> 00:00:51,869
at I'll give more details on that

38
00:00:51,929 --> 00:00:53,810
later in the video but first

39
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:55,140
things first you

40
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,210
need to sign up for a sending

41
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:59,549
platform that can send you know

42
00:00:59,549 --> 00:01:00,659
hundreds if not

43
00:01:00,659 --> 00:01:02,109
thousands of emails a day on

44
00:01:02,109 --> 00:01:03,869
autopilot like you see pulled up

45
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:04,780
in front of me

46
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:06,500
because these are the campaigns

47
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:07,920
that I'm running for my own

48
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,900
company list kit and

49
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:13,459
you can see since July we've sent

50
00:01:13,459 --> 00:01:16,620
30 like over 50,000 emails

51
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:16,900
completely

52
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,930
completely automated and generated

53
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:20,569
you know hundreds of positive

54
00:01:20,569 --> 00:01:21,760
responses and

55
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,329
leads in the door so sign up for a

56
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:26,519
sending tool like smart lead we do

57
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:27,450
have an

58
00:01:27,459 --> 00:01:28,569
option for list kit which I'll

59
00:01:28,569 --> 00:01:29,879
talk about later but first and

60
00:01:29,879 --> 00:01:30,680
foremost you have to

61
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,000
sign up for a tool that will

62
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:34,310
actually help you send the emails

63
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:35,260
on autopilot

64
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:36,819
literally type this into your

65
00:01:36,819 --> 00:01:40,780
browser sign up for an account and

66
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:41,140
you'll be off

67
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:42,859
and running on that front now

68
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:45,640
here's the really tedious annoying

69
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,359
part of cold

70
00:01:46,359 --> 00:01:47,709
outreach cold email in general

71
00:01:47,709 --> 00:01:50,019
which is setting up domains and

72
00:01:50,019 --> 00:01:51,700
inboxes to send

73
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,549
emails for you because you don't

74
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,879
want to send cold outreach

75
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:55,599
messages from a

76
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:57,260
single inbox at scale because

77
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:58,950
that's the easiest way to go to

78
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,019
spam the business

79
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:01,590
email that you set up will be you

80
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:03,329
know marked as spam and you won't

81
00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:03,840
even be able to

82
00:02:03,859 --> 00:02:05,709
email customers or clients or

83
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:08,120
co-founders or employees you don't

84
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:08,419
want to do

85
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:09,719
that you never want to send emails

86
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:11,150
from your main business domain you

87
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:11,780
want to set

88
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:14,039
up fresh domains for the outreach

89
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:15,650
and what do I mean by this well if

90
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:15,919
you look

91
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:18,180
here our main business URL is

92
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,620
listkit.io my business email is

93
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:21,259
Christian at

94
00:02:21,259 --> 00:02:23,530
listkit.io you'll notice none of

95
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:26,180
these domains are listkit.io

96
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:26,800
they're random

97
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:29,310
combinations of domain names that

98
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:31,289
allow us to set up hundreds of

99
00:02:31,289 --> 00:02:33,229
domains at a time to

100
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,699
run the outreach right like

101
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:37,680
listkit try listkit join get

102
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,659
listkit use listkit

103
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:42,389
listkit LLC listkit co listkit one

104
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:43,560
like a bunch of different

105
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,639
combinations of our

106
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:46,740
business name with like prone or

107
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:49,360
prefixes and suffixes that allow

108
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,159
us to set up

109
00:02:50,169 --> 00:02:52,620
hundreds of of domains and then

110
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:55,139
obviously you can't send an email

111
00:02:55,139 --> 00:02:55,400
from a

112
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,659
domain you need an inbox so on

113
00:02:57,659 --> 00:03:00,389
each domain is two inboxes one

114
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:01,930
under me and one under my

115
00:03:01,979 --> 00:03:03,800
partner Daniel right and this

116
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,520
allows us to send thousands of

117
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,849
emails a day while only

118
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,580
sending eight emails per inbox to

119
00:03:08,669 --> 00:03:12,289
stay compliant and under the radar

120
00:03:12,289 --> 00:03:13,259
of Google and Microsoft

121
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:14,979
because the last thing you want to

122
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:16,479
do is wind up in spam and get no

123
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:17,819
responses to your emails

124
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:19,669
and basically have to start the

125
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:21,479
process over so you need a sending

126
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:23,590
tool domains and inboxes

127
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,830
And then the last thing is going

128
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,159
to be the leads.

129
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:28,409
Where do you actually find a list

130
00:03:28,409 --> 00:03:29,500
of people to reach out to?

131
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,199
And that's where ListKit comes in.

132
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:33,270
We are a B2B database company that

133
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,259
has hundreds of millions of email

134
00:03:35,259 --> 00:03:37,150
records across any industry you

135
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,210
could think of.

136
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:40,740
So let's say you're going down the

137
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:43,060
ads and funnels path and you want

138
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:45,199
to make ads for consultants,

139
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:45,889
right?

140
00:03:45,889 --> 00:03:47,759
Just a random industry.

141
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:50,069
I would go into consulting as the

142
00:03:50,069 --> 00:03:51,009
industry.

143
00:03:51,009 --> 00:03:53,129
I only want to target people in

144
00:03:53,129 --> 00:03:55,150
the U.S., right?

145
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:56,780
And just like that, I have a list

146
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:59,270
of over 800,000 people in front of

147
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,680
me that I can pull from.

148
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,530
You can filter based on industry,

149
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:03,599
employee count.

150
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,080
Like let's say I want to only

151
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,219
target smaller consulting

152
00:04:06,699 --> 00:04:07,370
companies.

153
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:08,419
Okay, great.

154
00:04:08,419 --> 00:04:09,300
Right?

155
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:13,919
207,000 people that fit my filters

156
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:14,819
so far.

157
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:18,009
Then let's say we only want to do

158
00:04:18,009 --> 00:04:21,660
sales, marketing, growth, like

159
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:24,600
different keywords that the

160
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,629
business operates under.

161
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:29,199
Okay, cool.

162
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,050
So we now have 8,300 sales and

163
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:32,720
marketing consultants that I can

164
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,139
pull from to get a list of their

165
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:35,730
email addresses so I can reach out

166
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:37,350
to them and get them interested in

167
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,040
my ads and funnels, right?

168
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,290
Using the scripts that we talked

169
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:41,329
about in the previous couple

170
00:04:41,329 --> 00:04:41,800
videos.

171
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,689
So literally as easy as clicking a

172
00:04:43,689 --> 00:04:44,670
couple buttons.

173
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:46,089
Let's say I want 50 credits to

174
00:04:46,189 --> 00:04:46,560
start.

175
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,899
I click redeem.

176
00:04:47,899 --> 00:04:50,170
I'm going to be sent an email with

177
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:52,769
a CSV file of 50 email addresses

178
00:04:52,779 --> 00:04:54,560
that I can then plug into a

179
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,819
campaign and reach out to.

180
00:04:56,819 --> 00:04:58,500
How do I plug it into a campaign?

181
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,639
Well, pretty simple.

182
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:01,040
You go over here in the sending

183
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,399
tool that you sign up for.

184
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:05,800
You create a campaign and then

185
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,519
create campaign.

186
00:05:08,899 --> 00:05:10,350
You're going to import the leads,

187
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:11,019
drag and drop.

188
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:13,329
I'll pull up a random CSV that I

189
00:05:13,329 --> 00:05:15,430
have to show you how it works

190
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,160
because I pull from list kit just

191
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,160
about every day.

192
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,120
Okay.

193
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:36,379
Okay.

194
00:05:36,379 --> 00:05:38,660
So here is an example CSV file

195
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,069
that you will get from list kit

196
00:05:41,069 --> 00:05:43,199
emailed to your inbox.

197
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:44,920
Once it's ready, you literally

198
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,560
download it, drag and drop it to

199
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,019
this box.

200
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:49,199
And you now have a list of leads

201
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:51,750
pulled into the platform, um,

202
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,680
ready to go.

203
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,939
And then I'll, I'll actually write

204
00:05:57,939 --> 00:05:58,850
the sequences first and then

205
00:05:58,850 --> 00:05:59,990
import the leads and I'll show you

206
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:00,970
how everything comes together.

207
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:03,100
So let's just say, um, I'm doing

208
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,389
the ads and funnels path and I'm

209
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:05,899
writing my scripts real quick.

210
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:07,149
You would just literally copy and

211
00:06:07,149 --> 00:06:08,350
paste the scripts that you wrote

212
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:09,639
following my other video and paste

213
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:10,410
them into here.

214
00:06:10,939 --> 00:06:13,430
Um, you know, we can, we can, we

215
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:16,139
can help you sign 10 clients a

216
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:20,800
month with an ad system, right?

217
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:22,500
I'm not going to, I'm just going

218
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,050
to go quick here to, to show you

219
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,680
what exactly it looks like to put

220
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,680
the scripts into the sending tool.

221
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,850
Um, I actually went ahead and

222
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:36,519
created five sample ads for you to

223
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:40,850
take a look at mind if I share the

224
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:43,839
ads here, right?

225
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:45,860
Let's just say all my, I put all

226
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:47,980
my variants in here, A, B, C and

227
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:48,389
D.

228
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:50,339
Um, I have the three-step email

229
00:06:50,339 --> 00:06:51,639
sequence in here.

230
00:06:55,879 --> 00:06:56,519
Okay, great.

231
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:56,839
Right.

232
00:06:56,899 --> 00:06:58,600
I now have a three-step email

233
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,620
sequence with copy that I copy and

234
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,120
pasted from my Google doc

235
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,060
following the video that I made a

236
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:06,050
few, few videos ago, right?

237
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:07,009
Everything's ready to go.

238
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:07,759
The copy's in here.

239
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,170
I'm going to drag and drop my

240
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:09,720
leads.

241
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,329
I'm going to let these leads

242
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:12,069
import.

243
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:13,439
And that's pretty much all you

244
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:14,800
need to do to set up a cold email

245
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,459
campaign.

246
00:07:15,459 --> 00:07:17,290
Like once you have the messaging

247
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:18,910
and the strategy pulled up in

248
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:21,250
front of you, you're basically 80%

249
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,250
of the way home.

250
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:23,660
You just have to set up some very

251
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,319
boring, tedious, technical stuff.

252
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:27,579
Um, I like to call it like the

253
00:07:27,579 --> 00:07:29,529
strategy and the offer is like the

254
00:07:29,529 --> 00:07:31,220
house and the foundation of the

255
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,300
house is the boring stuff.

256
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,199
The leads, the inboxes, the

257
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:36,350
domains, the sending tool, all of

258
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:38,439
the things in the foundation serve

259
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,589
as, um, you know, fuel to get your

260
00:07:40,589 --> 00:07:42,019
message to as many people as

261
00:07:42,019 --> 00:07:42,759
possible.

262
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:43,560
Right.

263
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,279
So once the CSV file is imported,

264
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:47,040
all I do is choose some campaign

265
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,529
settings and I launched the

266
00:07:48,529 --> 00:07:50,250
campaign and I'm pretty much off

267
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:51,199
and running.

268
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,279
Um, and in a future video, I'm

269
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:54,939
going to show you how to basically

270
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,629
handle responses because people

271
00:07:56,629 --> 00:07:58,170
aren't just going to come back to

272
00:07:58,170 --> 00:07:59,920
you and say, yes, I would love to

273
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,399
work with you.

274
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:01,600
Like what's your, send me an

275
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,120
invoice.

276
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:02,910
I'm ready to sign up.

277
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:03,529
They're going to ask you

278
00:08:03,529 --> 00:08:03,899
questions.

279
00:08:03,899 --> 00:08:04,680
They're going to be skeptical.

280
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,920
You're going to have to overcome

281
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,579
objections.

282
00:08:06,579 --> 00:08:08,709
Um, but once you get the campaign

283
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,209
launched, you're basically 90% of

284
00:08:10,209 --> 00:08:10,699
the way there.

285
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:11,639
Um, okay.

286
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:13,490
So all the leads are uploaded.

287
00:08:13,579 --> 00:08:15,139
The copy is here, right?

288
00:08:15,139 --> 00:08:17,029
I'm going to go to campaign setup

289
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:18,920
and select my email inboxes real

290
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,560
quick.

291
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,850
Um,

292
00:08:24,889 --> 00:08:27,470
Like, okay.

293
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:29,069
All my inboxes are here.

294
00:08:29,069 --> 00:08:30,699
Um, we have a ton of inboxes

295
00:08:30,899 --> 00:08:32,658
because we send a lot of volume,

296
00:08:32,658 --> 00:08:34,250
select all of them, apply

297
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:35,320
selection.

298
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:35,730
Okay.

299
00:08:35,798 --> 00:08:37,668
I've selected my inboxes, um,

300
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:39,820
campaign scheduling Monday through

301
00:08:39,889 --> 00:08:40,559
Friday.

302
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:42,960
Um, you want to make sure that you

303
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,460
change this setting, max number of

304
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:45,559
new leads reach per day per

305
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:46,799
campaign, because if it's a

306
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:48,220
hundred, you're only going to send

307
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:49,480
a hundred emails in a day.

308
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,889
And that's going to cause massive

309
00:08:50,889 --> 00:08:52,409
frustration when you're like, why

310
00:08:52,409 --> 00:08:53,830
isn't my campaign sending enough

311
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,500
emails, which is very annoying.

312
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,509
Um, and then I always do New York

313
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:00,720
time for the time zone, save.

314
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,620
And then campaign settings.

315
00:09:05,629 --> 00:09:08,730
Um, we don't want to track opens

316
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:09,419
or link clicks.

317
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,440
Just take my word for it.

318
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,549
You do not want to track either of

319
00:09:12,549 --> 00:09:14,220
those because they basically set

320
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,690
off a red flag to the email

321
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:17,490
inboxes, Google and outlook that

322
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:19,309
you are a cold outreach person.

323
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,399
And we don't want that.

324
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,539
Um, and then you can basically do

325
00:09:22,539 --> 00:09:23,629
a spell check here that

326
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:25,350
everything's set up properly.

327
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,049
Obviously I just put a bunch of

328
00:09:27,049 --> 00:09:28,309
random stuff in a lot of the

329
00:09:28,309 --> 00:09:30,019
angles for the sake of time, but

330
00:09:30,019 --> 00:09:31,139
everything is set up.

331
00:09:31,259 --> 00:09:32,669
If all your copy looks good with

332
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:34,320
the text replacements pulled in,

333
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,559
because you'll see this bracket,

334
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:38,679
first name, underscore name,

335
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:40,519
bracket, bracket looks like this

336
00:09:40,529 --> 00:09:42,279
when it's actually ready to go,

337
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:43,460
because it's going to pull in the

338
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:44,419
prospect's first name.

339
00:09:44,419 --> 00:09:45,840
If everything looks good to go,

340
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,059
you would just click launch

341
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:48,460
campaign or schedule campaign

342
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:49,580
right here and your email

343
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:51,389
campaigns would be started, right?

344
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,259
Simple as that.

345
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:53,600
Everything's ready to go.

346
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,799
Um, and then you'll move into the,

347
00:09:55,799 --> 00:09:58,500
the mode where you're handling

348
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,610
responses, testing new ideas,

349
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:02,460
testing new offer angles.

350
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:04,309
So there will be more videos in

351
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,399
this module about how to test new

352
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:07,899
copy, um, how to do inbox

353
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:09,440
management and actually respond

354
00:10:09,529 --> 00:10:10,860
back to people to get them on the

355
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:11,779
phone with you.

356
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:12,149
Right.

357
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,350
Because the only goal of a cold

358
00:10:13,409 --> 00:10:14,639
email campaign is to get somebody

359
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:15,740
to say yes to a call with you and

360
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:16,769
then you book them in on your

361
00:10:16,769 --> 00:10:17,320
calendar.

362
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:17,820
Right.

363
00:10:17,929 --> 00:10:19,250
So those will be the future.

364
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,759
The videos that come after this is

365
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:22,309
how to actually convert calls from

366
00:10:22,309 --> 00:10:23,070
your campaign.

367
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:24,960
Um, but real quick, you're

368
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,340
probably saying, how do I set up

369
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,679
these domains and inboxes that

370
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:28,960
you've been talking about the

371
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,820
entire call?

372
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,190
Um, and the answer is really

373
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:31,779
simple.

374
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,250
You can either do it all by hand

375
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:36,500
where you set up inboxes one by

376
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,019
one.

377
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:38,879
Um, and there's a really good

378
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:41,049
video from one of our colleagues,

379
00:10:41,059 --> 00:10:42,440
Matt Lucero coming up next

380
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,070
directly after this video.

381
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,750
That will show you the process of

382
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,470
setting up inboxes one by one with

383
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:48,059
Gmail.

384
00:10:48,059 --> 00:10:49,919
Um, it's a huge pain and it's, you

385
00:10:50,019 --> 00:10:51,759
know, quite frankly, not worth

386
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:52,559
your time.

387
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:53,990
But if you know, your, your

388
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:55,500
budget's tight and you want to

389
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,139
conserve capital and you want to

390
00:10:57,139 --> 00:10:58,929
save money, doing it one by one is

391
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:00,460
what I would advise to you.

392
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,029
Um, just because it's going to be

393
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:03,559
a lot of labor, but it's going to

394
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:04,970
be, you know, a very minimal

395
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:06,129
amount of investment.

396
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:08,940
Um, or you can come over to the

397
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:11,759
list kit cold email setup that we

398
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:14,669
have available where we set up the

399
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:17,070
entire process for you with

400
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:20,000
domains, inboxes, a list of leads,

401
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,230
copy, um, and the sending tool all

402
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:24,460
configured completely for you.

403
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:25,139
Right.

404
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:26,659
So instead of following the video

405
00:11:26,659 --> 00:11:28,080
that comes next from Matt to get

406
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,649
domains and inboxes and signing up

407
00:11:29,649 --> 00:11:31,149
for an outreach tool and doing all

408
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:32,139
this yourself.

409
00:11:32,139 --> 00:11:33,600
If you're just like, I just want

410
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:35,139
you guys to handle this for me, we

411
00:11:35,139 --> 00:11:36,720
can handle it for you, right?

412
00:11:36,759 --> 00:11:37,570
Just come to this link.

413
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:38,879
It'll be in the description of

414
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:39,490
this video.

415
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:41,129
And basically all you do is choose

416
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:42,490
a plan depending on how many

417
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:43,909
people you want to contact in a

418
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:44,559
month.

419
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:46,419
Let's say it's 10,000 people a

420
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:46,940
month.

421
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,870
Um, you would pay us an upfront

422
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:51,090
setup fee that covers the many

423
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:54,009
hours of labor, you know, required

424
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,110
to set up domains and inboxes and

425
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:57,799
the initial tech costs.

426
00:11:57,799 --> 00:12:00,419
And then you just pay monthly, um,

427
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:02,009
to run the system.

428
00:12:02,019 --> 00:12:03,740
And these monthly costs are very

429
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:05,460
similar to what you would pay to

430
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:07,259
run the campaign on your own.

431
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:08,779
Like it's either you do it on your

432
00:12:08,779 --> 00:12:10,320
own and you save some money on the

433
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,019
upfront setup fee, or you pay us

434
00:12:12,019 --> 00:12:13,720
the setup fee and have our team do

435
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,879
the labor for you.

436
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:16,139
So you can focus on other areas of

437
00:12:16,149 --> 00:12:16,889
the business.

438
00:12:16,889 --> 00:12:17,600
Right.

439
00:12:18,379 --> 00:12:19,759
And then the monthly cost is

440
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:21,440
pretty much around the exact same

441
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,960
as what you would pay to run this

442
00:12:23,019 --> 00:12:24,809
system on your own with the

443
00:12:24,809 --> 00:12:26,590
domains, the leads, the inboxes,

444
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:27,710
the sending tool, right?

445
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,129
All of it's bundled up into these

446
00:12:29,129 --> 00:12:29,940
monthly fees.

447
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,490
So completely up to you.

448
00:12:31,539 --> 00:12:33,509
Um, if you want to dive into

449
00:12:33,509 --> 00:12:35,379
Matt's video next and run that

450
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:37,529
process yourself, feel free.

451
00:12:37,539 --> 00:12:39,610
If you want to use our setup and

452
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:41,750
let us do the two week process of

453
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:44,379
getting domains, getting inboxes,

454
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,750
warming everything up, hooking it

455
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,139
all up to a sending account.

456
00:12:48,139 --> 00:12:49,019
That looks like this.

457
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:51,080
Um, basically a to Z, the link is

458
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,379
in the description of this video.

459
00:12:53,379 --> 00:12:54,340
So you can sign up there.

460
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,889
Um, either way, we want to make

461
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:57,169
sure that you actually get a cold

462
00:12:57,169 --> 00:12:58,490
outreach campaign up and running

463
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:00,070
as fast as possible because the

464
00:13:00,139 --> 00:13:02,120
whole goal of this entire module

465
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,799
is to help you get initial leads

466
00:13:03,799 --> 00:13:04,809
and calls on your calendar and

467
00:13:04,809 --> 00:13:05,379
close deals.

468
00:13:05,379 --> 00:13:06,779
So hopefully this was helpful.

469
00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:09,299
This is the underlying tech stack

470
00:13:09,299 --> 00:13:11,340
that, you know, powers a cold

471
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:12,779
email system to where you can

472
00:13:12,779 --> 00:13:15,720
reach out to five, 10, 15, 30,000

473
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,039
people a month and get them

474
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:18,789
interested in your ads and funnels

475
00:13:18,789 --> 00:13:20,580
or email marketing services.

476
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:22,100
So hopefully this was helpful.

477
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:22,850
I'll see you guys on the next

478
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:23,740
video after Matt.

479
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:24,080
Peace.
