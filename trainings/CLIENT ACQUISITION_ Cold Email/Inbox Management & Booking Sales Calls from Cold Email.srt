1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:00,690
All right.

2
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:01,840
Now I want to show you what

3
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:03,680
happens once somebody responds

4
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,459
positively to your email because

5
00:00:05,459 --> 00:00:07,280
up to this point, all I've talked

6
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:08,640
about is getting the initial

7
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,789
response from a prospect, but the

8
00:00:10,789 --> 00:00:12,400
job is far from finished.

9
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:14,640
So let's say I'm reaching out to,

10
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,129
um, a group of restaurants, trying

11
00:00:17,129 --> 00:00:18,969
to sell them my social media

12
00:00:18,969 --> 00:00:20,519
marketing services.

13
00:00:20,649 --> 00:00:22,820
Once the restaurant owner says,

14
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:25,140
yes, I would like to learn more.

15
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:26,960
That is when you need to kick it

16
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:28,570
into high gear and get the job

17
00:00:28,579 --> 00:00:30,519
finished to get somebody booked in

18
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:32,320
for a sales call with your client

19
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,479
or for yourself.

20
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:34,719
If these are your own campaigns.

21
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:36,469
Um, so I want to walk you through

22
00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:38,359
a number of scenarios where people

23
00:00:38,469 --> 00:00:39,960
have responded to my emails and

24
00:00:40,049 --> 00:00:42,189
how I've handled these responses.

25
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:43,640
To get them booked in for a

26
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:44,250
meeting.

27
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:46,200
So pulled up in front of me is

28
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,950
what the inbox of the sending tool

29
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:48,820
looks like.

30
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,380
This is basically where all of

31
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:52,229
your conversations are housed with

32
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:53,640
different prospects.

33
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,530
Um, and I checked this religiously

34
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:57,390
twice a day to see if there's new

35
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,200
inboxes.

36
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,640
It's like checking my phone a

37
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,920
couple of times a day.

38
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,770
Um, you know, it's like a Twitch

39
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:04,579
where I just checked the inbox,

40
00:01:04,579 --> 00:01:06,450
hoping for that dopamine rush of a

41
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:07,750
new interested reply.

42
00:01:08,019 --> 00:01:10,879
And once I get a reply like this,

43
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:12,379
um, I want to guide you guys.

44
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:13,549
through how to get these

45
00:01:13,549 --> 00:01:15,239
objections and pushbacks handled

46
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:16,590
until they book in a call with

47
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:16,950
you.

48
00:01:16,989 --> 00:01:18,450
So we reached out to this person

49
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:19,980
and said, we can get you 10 new

50
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:21,379
prospects a month that are

51
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,030
interested in your agency services

52
00:01:23,129 --> 00:01:24,730
all from a loom video, cold email

53
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:25,840
approach.

54
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,099
Can I send you a video breaking

55
00:01:27,099 --> 00:01:28,120
down this strategy?

56
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,870
Um, and he said, all sounds very

57
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:30,569
good.

58
00:01:30,739 --> 00:01:32,609
Just depends on the investment for

59
00:01:32,609 --> 00:01:33,599
me right now.

60
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:35,670
Here's where you have to be a

61
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:38,180
savant and have, you know, finesse

62
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:40,579
and get people to, you know, buy

63
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:41,480
into what you're doing and

64
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,379
overcome objectives.

65
00:01:42,409 --> 00:01:44,099
So here's how we came back, right?

66
00:01:44,099 --> 00:01:45,799
We said, hope you're doing great.

67
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:47,099
I wanted to get back to you and

68
00:01:47,099 --> 00:01:48,640
walk you through pricing a little

69
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:48,950
bit.

70
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:50,719
Here's a breakdown of the cost.

71
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:51,939
This breaks down everything for

72
00:01:52,019 --> 00:01:52,230
you.

73
00:01:52,299 --> 00:01:53,530
Basically at list kit, we have

74
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:54,829
cheaper rates compared to other

75
00:01:54,829 --> 00:01:56,209
agencies because we're only a data

76
00:01:56,209 --> 00:01:56,859
company.

77
00:01:56,859 --> 00:01:58,170
I have a few case studies that

78
00:01:58,170 --> 00:01:59,400
break down the prices.

79
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,719
So let's, this is actually very

80
00:02:00,739 --> 00:02:01,400
long winded.

81
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,400
Um, because transparently we had a

82
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,079
new employee on my team handle

83
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:06,760
this response and I would have

84
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,389
made this a lot shorter.

85
00:02:08,469 --> 00:02:10,530
Um, but either way he comes back

86
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:12,189
and said, it looks amazing, but I

87
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:12,379
can

88
00:02:12,409 --> 00:02:13,490
not afford the monthly.

89
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:14,719
Then on top of the domains, I'm

90
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,199
sorry, but I'm trying to get back

91
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:17,550
up from being scammed and losing

92
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:18,930
all my business building for this

93
00:02:18,949 --> 00:02:19,300
year.

94
00:02:19,409 --> 00:02:21,409
Um, so kind of a, you know, sad

95
00:02:21,409 --> 00:02:22,840
story for this guy.

96
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,569
Um, and then I said, I hear you,

97
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,469
Mark, you won't find a more cost

98
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:29,719
effective cold email solution on

99
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:30,919
the market.

100
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:32,120
So feel free to reach out once you

101
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,400
have that first client signed.

102
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,830
Um, he didn't answer.

103
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:37,229
So the key thing to note here,

104
00:02:37,229 --> 00:02:38,919
guys, is if somebody ghosts you,

105
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:40,520
it's going to happen a lot where

106
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,810
you reach out to them and try to

107
00:02:41,909 --> 00:02:42,379
get the call book.

108
00:02:42,409 --> 00:02:44,289
And they just don't book the call

109
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:44,639
in.

110
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:46,669
Um, you're going to have to follow

111
00:02:46,669 --> 00:02:48,550
up repeatedly, repeatedly and

112
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:49,500
repeatedly.

113
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,159
So this guy didn't answer us on

114
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,409
July 16th.

115
00:02:52,509 --> 00:02:54,729
So on August 7th, which is way too

116
00:02:54,729 --> 00:02:56,669
long of a gap, this should have

117
00:02:56,669 --> 00:02:58,520
been a lot shorter of a, a time

118
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,580
gap, right?

119
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,000
We said, Hey Mark, what a 15

120
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:02,509
minute call really be that bad.

121
00:03:02,509 --> 00:03:03,500
I have all next week.

122
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,539
If you want to grab a time

123
00:03:04,539 --> 00:03:05,460
calendar link.

124
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:07,520
Um, so basically following up over

125
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,169
and over again until somebody

126
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,900
either books in or tells you to

127
00:03:10,949 --> 00:03:12,379
politely screw off.

128
00:03:12,409 --> 00:03:14,639
And he ended up booking in through

129
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:15,520
this link.

130
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,680
And once again, we had a new hire

131
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,520
on our team, call him Betty

132
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,800
instead of Mark, which is a very

133
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,599
unfortunate mix up.

134
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,560
Um, but anyways, saw you grab time

135
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,460
at 3 PM Eastern on the 11th.

136
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,210
You'll be speaking with my

137
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:28,819
partner, Evan.

138
00:03:28,819 --> 00:03:30,289
In the meantime, could you confirm

139
00:03:30,289 --> 00:03:31,939
the calendar invite and watch this

140
00:03:31,939 --> 00:03:33,719
13 minute overview of our system?

141
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:35,189
Here's the link to the video of

142
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:35,960
our system.

143
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,680
Let me know if you have any

144
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,599
questions in the meantime.

145
00:03:38,409 --> 00:03:40,099
He said, for starters, my not, my

146
00:03:40,099 --> 00:03:41,400
name is not Mark or my name is

147
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,569
Mark, not Betty.

148
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:44,110
My booking was for noon, not 3 PM.

149
00:03:44,189 --> 00:03:44,680
Just be sure.

150
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,840
That was my fault.

151
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,520
I just talked to Evan.

152
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:47,659
Looks like it wasn't confirmed.

153
00:03:47,659 --> 00:03:48,800
Um, sounds good.

154
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,860
Talk to you then.

155
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:52,229
So once again, this is somebody

156
00:03:52,229 --> 00:03:54,460
from my team having a bit of a,

157
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:56,289
you know, rookie beginner moment

158
00:03:56,699 --> 00:03:58,240
with some of the things he said,

159
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,909
but the call is booked and it was

160
00:04:00,259 --> 00:04:01,919
forwarded to my sales team.

161
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:05,349
Um, I'm going to link the video

162
00:04:05,409 --> 00:04:06,610
down below.

163
00:04:07,099 --> 00:04:08,180
Basically what I send to everybody

164
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:08,939
that books in.

165
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,599
It's basically a quick overview of

166
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,169
the entire system that we sell.

167
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,189
And you want to have this ideally

168
00:04:14,509 --> 00:04:15,710
for your own business and your

169
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:16,120
clients.

170
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,589
So when somebody books a call with

171
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:19,360
you, you can then reach fall back

172
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:21,079
out and say, Hey, Tom, thanks for

173
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:21,680
booking in.

174
00:04:22,069 --> 00:04:23,120
Please watch this quick five

175
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,439
minute video overviewing our

176
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:25,120
services.

177
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,610
So, you know, if, so you're ready

178
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:27,560
to go for our call.

179
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,199
If this isn't a fit, no worries.

180
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:30,160
We can cancel the call, but just

181
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,029
want to make sure that we're on

182
00:04:31,029 --> 00:04:31,620
the same page.

183
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:31,800
Right.

184
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,040
That's what you want to do to.

185
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:36,209
Prepare somebody to get on the

186
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:36,980
phone with you.

187
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,779
Um, let's go through some other

188
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:39,569
examples.

189
00:04:39,589 --> 00:04:41,250
This is all the way back from

190
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,750
December of last year.

191
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,699
Hey, I saw you're a key player in

192
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:46,259
your company's growth efforts.

193
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:48,740
We have 626 million B2B email

194
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:50,500
leads in a database similar to

195
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,129
Apollo.

196
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,680
I compiled a list of 50 leads,

197
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:53,899
right?

198
00:04:53,899 --> 00:04:55,040
So we reached out with our initial

199
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:55,519
message.

200
00:04:55,579 --> 00:04:56,889
He said, thank you for reaching

201
00:04:57,079 --> 00:04:57,399
out.

202
00:04:57,519 --> 00:04:58,480
I'd be happy to connect and

203
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,100
discuss further.

204
00:04:59,100 --> 00:04:59,920
Let's set up a meeting.

205
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,449
Feel free to share the list.

206
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:01,899
Right.

207
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:03,720
Sent the list over.

208
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,920
Here's a list of 50 decision

209
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,250
makers at SAS companies who could

210
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,639
benefit from your workflows.

211
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:08,439
Here's the list.

212
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:08,959
Right.

213
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:11,250
So whenever somebody answers, you

214
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,089
want to just get right to the

215
00:05:13,089 --> 00:05:15,420
point and move the conversation to

216
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:17,350
a call as soon as you possibly

217
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:17,680
can.

218
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,740
Don't waste time, you know, giving

219
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:21,850
a long X long winded answer.

220
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:24,180
Just answer their question.

221
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:25,860
Like feel free to share the list

222
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,569
here or handle their, you know,

223
00:05:27,579 --> 00:05:29,899
basically fulfill their ask.

224
00:05:29,899 --> 00:05:31,160
He's asking to see a list.

225
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:32,120
Sounds good.

226
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:32,810
Here's the list.

227
00:05:32,819 --> 00:05:34,529
And then I push for a call right

228
00:05:34,529 --> 00:05:35,050
away.

229
00:05:35,069 --> 00:05:36,550
How does tomorrow or Wednesday at

230
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:37,930
noon Eastern work for a call?

231
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:39,329
So I can give you a walkthrough of

232
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,259
our database.

233
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:41,959
If it's easier, feel free to grab

234
00:05:42,029 --> 00:05:43,689
some time on my calendar here with

235
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:45,220
a link to book in with us.

236
00:05:47,569 --> 00:05:48,529
And he never answered.

237
00:05:48,529 --> 00:05:49,579
So the next day I said, how's

238
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:50,600
tomorrow at 9 a.m.

239
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,360
Eastern work?

240
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,699
My calendar is wide open.

241
00:05:52,699 --> 00:05:53,620
Feel free to shoot over a few

242
00:05:53,709 --> 00:05:54,699
times and I'll get it booked.

243
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:55,779
Right.

244
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:57,129
So instead of just sending one

245
00:05:57,129 --> 00:05:58,540
email and this is a good lesson to

246
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:00,139
learn, instead of just sending one

247
00:06:00,139 --> 00:06:01,529
email and calling in a night and

248
00:06:01,589 --> 00:06:03,149
not following up ever again, I

249
00:06:03,149 --> 00:06:05,220
followed up the next day saying,

250
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:06,319
hey, how's tomorrow at nine work

251
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:06,779
instead?

252
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:08,860
He says, apologies for the late

253
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:09,300
response.

254
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,300
I've been out of town and would

255
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,339
love to arrange a meeting at the

256
00:06:11,339 --> 00:06:12,240
earliest opportunity.

257
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,139
Would December 19th work?

258
00:06:14,139 --> 00:06:14,879
Please let me know.

259
00:06:14,889 --> 00:06:15,439
No sweat.

260
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:17,189
I've got 10 and two open to either

261
00:06:17,189 --> 00:06:18,050
of these work.

262
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:19,680
He grabbed the time on this link

263
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,430
and the call happened and that was

264
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,100
handled.

265
00:06:22,129 --> 00:06:23,680
So basically what I'm trying to

266
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,180
show you guys is when somebody

267
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:26,800
answers, it's not going to be as

268
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,180
easy as, yes, send me your

269
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,680
calendar so we can book in.

270
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:31,170
People are going to ask questions.

271
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:32,000
What's your pricing?

272
00:06:32,129 --> 00:06:33,720
Has this worked for other people?

273
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,480
What kind of results can I expect?

274
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:37,290
And people are also going to ghost

275
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:38,610
you and you're going to have to

276
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:39,939
follow up several times.

277
00:06:39,939 --> 00:06:41,319
Like here's a good example.

278
00:06:41,329 --> 00:06:42,579
I thought right here that this

279
00:06:42,579 --> 00:06:43,339
would be a layup.

280
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:44,459
He would book the call.

281
00:06:44,459 --> 00:06:45,149
No problem.

282
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,519
We'd be on our way to a sales

283
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:46,980
call.

284
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:47,660
No reply.

285
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,660
Instead of being mad and sulking

286
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:51,610
and giving up, I followed up the

287
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:53,350
next day and then he answered

288
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:54,360
right away.

289
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:55,889
How's December 19th looked?

290
00:06:55,899 --> 00:06:56,680
Call got booked.

291
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:59,279
We went from there, right?

292
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:00,420
I can go through dozens of these

293
00:07:00,509 --> 00:07:01,000
examples.

294
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:04,800
Here's another one.

295
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,889
Hey, Christian, is your model

296
00:07:05,889 --> 00:07:07,040
retainer base or pay per lead?

297
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,829
Kind of an open-ended question and

298
00:07:08,829 --> 00:07:10,019
I was very upfront.

299
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:11,060
Hey, neither actually.

300
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,339
You pay a one-time setup fee, then

301
00:07:12,339 --> 00:07:13,420
you pay the monthly cost to keep

302
00:07:13,509 --> 00:07:14,540
the system running.

303
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:16,189
We don't profit a cent on the

304
00:07:16,189 --> 00:07:17,399
actual service.

305
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:18,889
Our only goal is to get you onto

306
00:07:18,889 --> 00:07:20,439
our data software list kit.

307
00:07:20,449 --> 00:07:22,240
You won't find a cheaper solution

308
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,180
on the market.

309
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,509
Are you open to a call to discuss

310
00:07:24,509 --> 00:07:25,339
in more detail?

311
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:26,649
Let me know what time that works

312
00:07:26,649 --> 00:07:27,060
here.

313
00:07:28,069 --> 00:07:29,319
Just how, like when I was

314
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:31,129
introducing the initial cold email

315
00:07:31,129 --> 00:07:32,850
writing to you guys, it's the same

316
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:34,500
process every time with hook, case

317
00:07:34,589 --> 00:07:35,980
study, call to action.

318
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:37,670
Same thing is true with following

319
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:38,620
up with people.

320
00:07:38,649 --> 00:07:40,060
Answer the question that they ask

321
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,259
and then push for a call.

322
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:43,519
So I answered his question by

323
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:44,759
saying how our pricing model

324
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:45,259
works.

325
00:07:45,269 --> 00:07:47,089
And then I said, are you open to a

326
00:07:47,089 --> 00:07:48,180
call tomorrow or Thursday so we

327
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:49,610
can discuss details and pricing?

328
00:07:49,629 --> 00:07:50,709
Let me know what time that works

329
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,939
best with you or grab time here.

330
00:07:52,029 --> 00:07:53,480
He comes back.

331
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:53,800
Awesome.

332
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,540
Thanks for the info.

333
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:55,160
Book the meeting.

334
00:07:55,189 --> 00:07:57,000
I come back with, saw you booked

335
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,009
in on Thursday with my partner.

336
00:07:59,029 --> 00:08:00,439
Can you please accept the calendar

337
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:00,920
invite?

338
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,040
Let me know if you have questions.

339
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,889
Perfectly executed conversation

340
00:08:03,889 --> 00:08:04,959
there.

341
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:06,490
Right?

342
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,410
Just to go through a few more of

343
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:07,779
these.

344
00:08:09,509 --> 00:08:10,860
So, he said, yes, would love that.

345
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:11,949
Let's connect in the new year.

346
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:13,879
On New Year's Eve, he actually

347
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:14,720
said this.

348
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,139
Hey, Alex, happy new year.

349
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:17,060
Hope you had time to rest and

350
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,120
enjoy time with your family.

351
00:08:18,129 --> 00:08:19,569
How does Monday at 11 a.m.

352
00:08:19,569 --> 00:08:20,750
Eastern work on your end for a

353
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,139
call?

354
00:08:21,149 --> 00:08:22,920
If it's easier, grab time here.

355
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:24,480
He said, please confirm.

356
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,620
Thanks, Alex.

357
00:08:25,629 --> 00:08:28,660
And I actually didn't answer until

358
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:30,660
later in the day.

359
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:32,029
I dropped the ball here just now

360
00:08:32,029 --> 00:08:32,679
seeing this.

361
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:33,620
Looks like you're in Dubai.

362
00:08:33,629 --> 00:08:34,570
How does 7 a.m.

363
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:35,340
Eastern work?

364
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:36,679
He comes back.

365
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:37,820
Hey, I missed this email too.

366
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:38,720
I'm currently in London.

367
00:08:39,429 --> 00:08:40,259
I say, does 1 p.m.

368
00:08:40,259 --> 00:08:40,679
Eastern?

369
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:41,440
No, it doesn't work.

370
00:08:41,509 --> 00:08:42,740
But 8 or 9 a.m.

371
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:44,059
Eastern does work.

372
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:45,620
Hey, brother, just scheduled you

373
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:47,019
in for 9.15 a.m.

374
00:08:47,019 --> 00:08:47,879
with my partner, Henry.

375
00:08:47,889 --> 00:08:48,559
Thank you.

376
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,340
Received.

377
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:49,799
Right?

378
00:08:49,809 --> 00:08:51,919
So, like, moral of the story here

379
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:54,090
in this nine-minute video is when

380
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:55,350
you get a response from somebody,

381
00:08:55,389 --> 00:08:57,629
it's never going to be as cut and

382
00:08:57,629 --> 00:08:59,539
dry as, let's hop on the phone so

383
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:00,860
I can give you my money.

384
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:02,250
You're going to have to weave your

385
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,669
way through objections and answer

386
00:09:03,669 --> 00:09:04,159
questions

387
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:05,509
and get through the logistics of

388
00:09:05,509 --> 00:09:06,909
booking people in until you have a

389
00:09:06,909 --> 00:09:07,559
call booked.

390
00:09:07,629 --> 00:09:10,179
So, in the next video, I'm going

391
00:09:10,179 --> 00:09:12,159
to go over what to do if your

392
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:14,440
messaging isn't working,

393
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:15,779
like how to test new stuff.

394
00:09:15,789 --> 00:09:17,360
And I basically want to make a

395
00:09:17,389 --> 00:09:19,320
video for every possible scenario

396
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,240
where things are not going right

397
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:22,710
so that you can fix them and

398
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:24,639
improve on them and iterate them,

399
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:25,340
right?

400
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:27,360
So, like, this is very detailed,

401
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,500
in-depth stuff, and I want to give

402
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,019
you all of it that I can possibly

403
00:09:31,019 --> 00:09:31,490
give you

404
00:09:31,549 --> 00:09:33,279
so that you are equipped with the

405
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,100
knowledge to run this business on

406
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:35,840
your own.

407
00:09:35,889 --> 00:09:37,049
And if you have an issue, you can

408
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:38,360
come into this library of videos

409
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,509
and find an answer to your

410
00:09:39,509 --> 00:09:40,149
question.

411
00:09:40,169 --> 00:09:42,000
So, I hope you're following along,

412
00:09:42,009 --> 00:09:43,470
and this is entertaining and

413
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:44,120
insightful

414
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:45,679
because this skill of getting

415
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:47,350
people booked in is literally a

416
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:49,279
million-dollar skill, right?

417
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:51,409
So, here's an example of a really

418
00:09:51,409 --> 00:09:52,639
easy scenario.

419
00:09:52,649 --> 00:09:54,039
For sure, I'll take a look.

420
00:09:54,049 --> 00:09:55,049
If I don't get back to you, here's

421
00:09:55,049 --> 00:09:55,889
a link to my calendar.

422
00:09:55,909 --> 00:09:57,330
Hey, Michael, just scheduled you

423
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:57,620
in.

424
00:09:57,629 --> 00:09:58,259
That's a layup.

425
00:09:58,269 --> 00:10:00,809
Not every call is like this by any

426
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:03,960
stretch of the imagination, right?

427
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,769
Promise, probably will be in

428
00:10:05,769 --> 00:10:07,590
Thursday or Friday before I'm

429
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:08,509
available.

430
00:10:08,549 --> 00:10:09,379
I'll have to lock in some

431
00:10:09,379 --> 00:10:10,059
appointments.

432
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:11,230
I promise you I'm not blowing you

433
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:11,539
off.

434
00:10:11,549 --> 00:10:12,799
I will take the meeting.

435
00:10:12,809 --> 00:10:13,919
Also, can you send me a list of

436
00:10:13,929 --> 00:10:15,120
the industries you guys have?

437
00:10:15,269 --> 00:10:16,350
Sure thing.

438
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:17,519
Here's a list of the industries we

439
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:18,899
get great results reaching out to.

440
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:20,259
Hey, I saw you booked in with my

441
00:10:20,259 --> 00:10:21,899
partner, Eddie, for tomorrow.

442
00:10:21,909 --> 00:10:22,960
Oh, shoot.

443
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:23,940
I booked the appointment but

444
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:24,980
didn't realize it was at the time

445
00:10:25,059 --> 00:10:25,879
with somebody else.

446
00:10:25,889 --> 00:10:27,350
What does your schedule look like

447
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:27,899
tomorrow?

448
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:29,490
No, it's perfect that you booked

449
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:30,279
in with Eddie.

450
00:10:30,309 --> 00:10:31,470
He oversees sales for us.

451
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:32,259
I'm a co-founder here, so I

452
00:10:32,259 --> 00:10:33,230
couldn't care less about getting

453
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:33,720
the credit.

454
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:35,009
Oh, good.

455
00:10:35,029 --> 00:10:35,899
I thought another sales rep was

456
00:10:35,899 --> 00:10:36,860
trying to snake your deal, so I'm

457
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:37,620
glad you clarified.

458
00:10:37,629 --> 00:10:39,120
How did it go with Eddie?

459
00:10:39,129 --> 00:10:39,700
Eddie is great.

460
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:41,519
I had to reschedule the follow-up.

461
00:10:41,529 --> 00:10:43,240
So, yeah, just plenty of examples

462
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,559
of back and forth here.

463
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:46,120
And I'm even going to put a link

464
00:10:46,169 --> 00:10:48,070
down below to a sales vault, which

465
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:49,740
is 100 conversations

466
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,450
just like this, managing responses

467
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:52,809
from people and going back and

468
00:10:52,809 --> 00:10:53,320
forth.

469
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:55,240
So you guys can get really, really

470
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,100
good at writing the initial email

471
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,299
and then responding

472
00:10:58,309 --> 00:10:59,509
to people until they book a call

473
00:10:59,509 --> 00:11:00,019
with you.

474
00:11:00,529 --> 00:11:01,440
So let's move on to the next

475
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:01,860
video.
