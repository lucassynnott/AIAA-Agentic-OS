1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,080
Hello, hello, and welcome.

2
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:02,359
In this module, we're talking

3
00:00:02,379 --> 00:00:04,040
about the profitable e-commerce

4
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:04,620
funnel.

5
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:06,059
And you have my cool Airbnb

6
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,019
kitchen situation behind me.

7
00:00:08,019 --> 00:00:09,099
You can just ignore that.

8
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:10,919
But today we're talking about the

9
00:00:10,919 --> 00:00:11,560
funnel.

10
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,039
So you can see the funnel here,

11
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:14,080
why exactly we are doing

12
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:14,419
this.

13
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,779
And at the end of the day, we want

14
00:00:15,779 --> 00:00:16,640
to be profitable.

15
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,179
That's the only thing that really

16
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:19,170
matters with e-commerce.

17
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:20,350
And we're talking about how that

18
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:21,170
funnel has changed.

19
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:22,339
And so today we're

20
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,839
talking about one, the evolution

21
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:25,350
of the e-commerce market, just so

22
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:27,019
we can understand the context of

23
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:27,699
where we are at.

24
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,199
We're talking about the top three

25
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:31,839
e-commerce problems in 2024, 2025.

26
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:32,840
And then we're

27
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,289
talking about the old e-com

28
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:37,420
funnel, used to work 2020, 21, 22,

29
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:39,200
versus the new one, the only way

30
00:00:39,429 --> 00:00:39,460
to

31
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:40,780
survive in today's market.

32
00:00:40,789 --> 00:00:42,210
And then we're talking about how

33
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:43,619
to convert and retain customers

34
00:00:43,909 --> 00:00:44,000
with

35
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:45,710
email, because that's the point of

36
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:47,320
this whole thing is with email for

37
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,740
maximum profitability.

38
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:50,100
So that is

39
00:00:50,179 --> 00:00:51,829
what we will be covering in this

40
00:00:51,829 --> 00:00:52,369
video.

41
00:00:52,369 --> 00:00:54,259
So sit back, pay attention, take

42
00:00:54,549 --> 00:00:54,829
notes.

43
00:00:54,829 --> 00:00:55,899
This is very, very

44
00:00:55,979 --> 00:00:57,130
important, very important to

45
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:58,469
understand the context of where we

46
00:00:58,479 --> 00:00:58,920
are at.

47
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,719
So evolution of the e-commerce

48
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:01,030
market.

49
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:01,710
Let's talk about it.

50
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:02,090
Okay.

51
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:04,709
So 2020 to 2023, which is 2024

52
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:05,049
plus.

53
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:05,450
Okay.

54
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:07,420
2020, we were in the

55
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:07,939
pandemic.

56
00:01:07,939 --> 00:01:09,310
We had some crazy stuff going on.

57
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:10,739
Government was just printing money

58
00:01:10,739 --> 00:01:11,579
out of their butt cheeks

59
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,219
and there were stimulus checks

60
00:01:13,219 --> 00:01:14,799
everywhere, just getting sent.

61
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:16,319
You were just, money was coming

62
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:16,459
out

63
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:17,709
of thin air and people had a lot

64
00:01:17,709 --> 00:01:18,170
of money.

65
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,609
They had stimulus checks and they

66
00:01:19,609 --> 00:01:20,500
also were probably

67
00:01:20,579 --> 00:01:21,650
getting paid from their job.

68
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:22,890
Still, a lot of people were still

69
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:23,579
getting paid.

70
00:01:23,579 --> 00:01:25,319
And so consumers just

71
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,219
had a ton of money.

72
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:27,650
And so they were buying anything

73
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:29,200
and they had nothing better to do

74
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,239
all day, but to

75
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:30,890
buy anything.

76
00:01:30,909 --> 00:01:31,950
They were just scrolling,

77
00:01:31,969 --> 00:01:33,489
scrolling, scrolling and buying.

78
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,620
That's at least what I was

79
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:35,079
doing.

80
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:36,810
Literally nothing but scrolling.

81
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:38,209
And so e-com brands just felt

82
00:01:38,209 --> 00:01:38,609
rich.

83
00:01:38,609 --> 00:01:39,620
E-com exploded.

84
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:40,900
And so what

85
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:41,890
happened, people saw this

86
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:42,609
opportunity.

87
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:43,590
New e-com brands started

88
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:44,780
absolutely multiplying.

89
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:45,780
And thanks to

90
00:01:45,859 --> 00:01:47,489
Shopify for making it super easy

91
00:01:47,489 --> 00:01:49,239
for people to set up e-com stores,

92
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:50,569
just made it so easy for

93
00:01:50,659 --> 00:01:51,980
new e-com brands to come up.

94
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:53,329
And so now we're kind of in this

95
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,180
situation, in this transition,

96
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:55,689
2024,

97
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:57,590
we're feeling the repercussions of

98
00:01:57,599 --> 00:01:59,359
kind of like the mass printing and

99
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:01,099
where we were at in market with

100
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:03,769
2020, kind of in a bear market,

101
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,170
fear of inflation, recession, all

102
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:07,090
that stuff.

103
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:08,758
And the consumer just has

104
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,439
less cash.

105
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,159
They're getting less money.

106
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:12,770
Costs of living are rising.

107
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:14,780
And so people just have less money

108
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:16,620
than they did in like 2020, 2021,

109
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:17,759
when they were getting just money

110
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:18,449
thrown at them.

111
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,039
And then on top

112
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,300
of that, consumers are just more

113
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,729
skeptical and they're buying less.

114
00:02:22,729 --> 00:02:23,770
The rate at which they're

115
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,430
buying is less than in prior

116
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:25,969
years.

117
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:27,939
One, because they have less money

118
00:02:28,229 --> 00:02:29,740
and two, because they're

119
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:30,300
skeptical.

120
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,539
People have been scammed online

121
00:02:31,539 --> 00:02:32,919
before and they're more protective

122
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:33,699
on their money.

123
00:02:33,699 --> 00:02:34,280
And so

124
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,810
there's a little bit more

125
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:36,699
skeptical.

126
00:02:36,699 --> 00:02:38,449
And so what happens, we have so

127
00:02:38,729 --> 00:02:40,650
many more e-com brands on the

128
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,530
scene, but less people buying that

129
00:02:43,659 --> 00:02:46,330
obviously makes e-com brands make

130
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:47,139
less money.

131
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,780
And so we can have two

132
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:49,770
options here.

133
00:02:49,819 --> 00:02:50,969
E-com brands continue as usual

134
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:52,240
with the old funnel, which we'll

135
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:53,780
go over and they're just going to

136
00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:54,330
fizzle out.

137
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:55,580
And then we have e-com brands who

138
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:56,990
are actually focusing on profit.

139
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:57,780
Those are the ones who are going

140
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:57,780
to

141
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,229
thrive, not just the revenue, we

142
00:02:59,280 --> 00:02:59,930
want profit.

143
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:01,240
And so those are the ones who will

144
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:02,780
survive for the coming years.

145
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,189
So let's talk about the top three

146
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:06,930
e-commerce problems and how that

147
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:07,780
relates to everything.

148
00:03:07,819 --> 00:03:09,009
I've talked, I talked to hundreds

149
00:03:09,009 --> 00:03:10,240
of e-commerce brands and these are

150
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,110
the ones that come up

151
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:11,780
consistently.

152
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:12,930
The only thing, the only things

153
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:14,180
that really matter and they're all

154
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:15,780
kind of related to each other.

155
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:16,979
So number one, cost per

156
00:03:16,979 --> 00:03:18,669
acquisition, how much you spend on

157
00:03:18,729 --> 00:03:20,780
average to acquire one customer.

158
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:21,780
And so essentially

159
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:22,770
you have to pay on marketing.

160
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,370
What good is like a website where

161
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:25,780
you're selling products if nobody

162
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:25,780
knows

163
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:26,770
of it.

164
00:03:26,849 --> 00:03:28,129
And so you have to spend on

165
00:03:28,129 --> 00:03:29,780
marketing to get people in.

166
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,780
So how much are you spending to

167
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:31,780
get people in?

168
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:34,370
For example, if you're running

169
00:03:34,449 --> 00:03:37,310
Facebook ads, you pay $6 in total

170
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:39,780
Facebook ads to get one purchase

171
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:39,780
for

172
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,960
like your bakery or something.

173
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,110
Then your cost per acquisition is

174
00:03:44,219 --> 00:03:44,780
$6.

175
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:45,780
The problem which we'll talk

176
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,490
about and I'll go, I go more in

177
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,780
depth in a second.

178
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,780
But let's talk about retention.

179
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:52,770
So after cost per

180
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,169
acquisition, cost per acquisition

181
00:03:54,169 --> 00:03:55,360
implies that you made that first

182
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:55,780
sale.

183
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:57,780
Retention is now what's the rate

184
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:57,780
at

185
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:59,900
which your customers come back and

186
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:00,669
buy again.

187
00:04:00,729 --> 00:04:01,939
So how many times do your

188
00:04:02,229 --> 00:04:03,780
customers come back on average?

189
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,300
One time, is it two times, three

190
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:05,780
times?

191
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,780
And so that's the rate and that

192
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,280
contributes to your lifetime

193
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:09,780
value.

194
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:11,340
And then we have profitability,

195
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:12,780
which is your take home cash,

196
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,780
revenue minus expenses.

197
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:15,780
Profitability is

198
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,149
directly related to cost per

199
00:04:17,149 --> 00:04:18,550
acquisition and retention.

200
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:19,939
Literally the formula for

201
00:04:19,939 --> 00:04:22,139
profitability is your cost per

202
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:22,779
acquisition

203
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,529
and your expenses and everything.

204
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,509
Profitability relies on

205
00:04:27,509 --> 00:04:28,779
everything.

206
00:04:28,779 --> 00:04:29,779
I kind of butchered that.

207
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,420
But revenue minus expenses, it's

208
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:32,779
all that really matters.

209
00:04:32,779 --> 00:04:35,220
So problem number one, let's talk

210
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:35,779
about cost of acquisition.

211
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,779
So this is the ideal scenario.

212
00:04:37,779 --> 00:04:40,779
We are absolutely blessed today

213
00:04:40,779 --> 00:04:41,399
with easy ways to get site

214
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:41,779
traffic.

215
00:04:41,779 --> 00:04:42,779
It is so simple.

216
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:44,220
You can just put some creatives

217
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:45,550
together in Canva or Figma,

218
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:46,779
whatever you want.

219
00:04:46,779 --> 00:04:48,779
Toss Mr.

220
00:04:48,779 --> 00:04:49,779
Zuckerberg some cash and you're

221
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,230
pretty much guaranteed to get site

222
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:51,779
traffic.

223
00:04:51,779 --> 00:04:53,029
You are guaranteed if you give

224
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:53,779
enough money.

225
00:04:53,779 --> 00:04:55,779
And so what we have, this is the

226
00:04:55,779 --> 00:04:55,779
goal.

227
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,470
You have some money, spend it on

228
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:58,100
paid ads.

229
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,779
You throw some cash at Zuck.

230
00:04:59,779 --> 00:05:02,029
He will bring you site traffic and

231
00:05:02,029 --> 00:05:03,779
hopefully you can make some money.

232
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:05,310
And then you can just refund it

233
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:05,779
here.

234
00:05:05,779 --> 00:05:06,779
Now you have more money.

235
00:05:06,779 --> 00:05:08,779
You spend more on paid ads.

236
00:05:08,779 --> 00:05:09,779
You get more site traffic and

237
00:05:09,779 --> 00:05:10,779
hopefully you can make more money.

238
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,620
But this all revolves around site

239
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,509
traffic and making some money from

240
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:15,779
your site traffic.

241
00:05:15,779 --> 00:05:18,300
The problem is on your site

242
00:05:18,379 --> 00:05:19,779
traffic, people aren't buying.

243
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:20,620
They're not buying like they used

244
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:20,769
to.

245
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:22,079
You're paying for these cold

246
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:23,939
traffic ads, but so little people

247
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:27,230
are actually purchasing at a much,

248
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:28,939
they're purchasing at a much lower

249
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:29,769
rate than before.

250
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,230
The modern customer just doesn't

251
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:32,759
want to buy from you because there

252
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:33,779
are a few reasons.

253
00:05:33,779 --> 00:05:35,779
For one, they have options.

254
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,120
Thanks to Shopify, so many e-com

255
00:05:37,129 --> 00:05:38,370
brands popping up every single

256
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:38,779
day.

257
00:05:38,779 --> 00:05:41,230
And the average customer sees over

258
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:43,550
70 e-commerce ads per day, which

259
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:43,779
is ridiculous.

260
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,750
If you think it's about every two

261
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,569
or three posts on Instagram,

262
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,230
you'll see an ad, some of them

263
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:50,769
being e-com, some not.

264
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:52,220
But if somebody scrolls for like

265
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:53,670
an hour a day, it's way more than

266
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:54,779
70 e-com ads.

267
00:05:54,779 --> 00:05:56,779
And so they're seeing a lot of

268
00:05:56,779 --> 00:05:58,029
brands that are getting exposed to

269
00:05:58,029 --> 00:05:58,779
a lot of new brands.

270
00:05:58,860 --> 00:05:59,769
And so they know what's out there.

271
00:05:59,779 --> 00:06:01,279
They know when they see your

272
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:03,079
brand, they know there are

273
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:04,310
probably hundreds of other brands,

274
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:05,540
thousands of other brands in your

275
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:06,779
niche that they could choose.

276
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:08,810
And two, they have the options and

277
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:10,779
they just like to shop around.

278
00:06:10,779 --> 00:06:11,779
It's fun to shop around.

279
00:06:11,779 --> 00:06:13,050
It's fun to see what other brands

280
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:13,759
are out there.

281
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:14,699
It's fun to see what kind of

282
00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:15,579
branding is there, what

283
00:06:15,579 --> 00:06:16,779
influencers are promoting.

284
00:06:16,779 --> 00:06:17,779
It's fun.

285
00:06:17,779 --> 00:06:18,779
People like shopping around.

286
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:20,189
That's why people go to the mall.

287
00:06:20,209 --> 00:06:21,240
You like to check out your

288
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:21,779
options.

289
00:06:21,779 --> 00:06:22,779
And so that's the other thing.

290
00:06:22,779 --> 00:06:23,779
It's just they like to.

291
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,410
And then three, they're wary about

292
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:26,779
buying online right away.

293
00:06:26,779 --> 00:06:28,209
If they see your brand one time

294
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:30,769
off an ad, it's really difficult.

295
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:32,029
They don't know who you are and

296
00:06:32,029 --> 00:06:33,370
they don't know if they can trust

297
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:33,779
you.

298
00:06:33,779 --> 00:06:35,829
They're not just buying from you

299
00:06:35,829 --> 00:06:36,779
right away.

300
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:38,290
I've been scammed online before

301
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:39,680
buying stuff or I haven't just

302
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:40,779
received my order.

303
00:06:40,779 --> 00:06:42,779
And so a lot of people have too.

304
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:43,769
And so that just like scars you.

305
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:45,509
And so you always like to do your

306
00:06:45,509 --> 00:06:46,779
due diligence now.

307
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:48,339
And so those are kind of like the

308
00:06:48,339 --> 00:06:50,019
reasons why people are buying at a

309
00:06:50,019 --> 00:06:51,779
much lower rate on the website.

310
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:53,009
So kind of what we have to do is

311
00:06:53,009 --> 00:06:54,100
we have to cross the trust

312
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,129
threshold, which is just like a

313
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:57,779
concept that I've made up.

314
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:59,810
But it relies on the fact, like

315
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,939
the concept is what I made, but

316
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,779
the fact that the modern customer

317
00:07:03,779 --> 00:07:05,120
needs to see your brand five plus

318
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,089
times to trust you enough to

319
00:07:06,089 --> 00:07:06,779
purchase is fact.

320
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:07,970
People need to see your brand

321
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:08,779
multiple times.

322
00:07:08,779 --> 00:07:10,779
Maybe it's not times.

323
00:07:10,779 --> 00:07:12,779
Maybe it's time exposure.

324
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:14,610
Like if somebody watches like a

325
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:16,779
one hour podcast with the founder,

326
00:07:16,779 --> 00:07:17,480
that could be enough to get

327
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,339
somebody to trust you enough to

328
00:07:18,339 --> 00:07:18,779
purchase.

329
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,410
But we're talking like ads, little

330
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:21,879
bits of content has to be at least

331
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:22,779
like five plus.

332
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,339
If you ever heard of the rule of

333
00:07:24,339 --> 00:07:25,779
seven, the rule of seven is

334
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:27,610
essentially somebody needs to see

335
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:28,949
you seven times enough to

336
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:29,769
purchase.

337
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:31,220
Someone needs to see you seven

338
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,670
times to purchase from you, to

339
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:33,779
trust you enough.

340
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:35,860
And also if you just, if they only

341
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:37,779
see you like one or two times,

342
00:07:37,779 --> 00:07:39,060
they don't know enough about you

343
00:07:39,139 --> 00:07:39,779
to purchase.

344
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,370
And so you just need to be able to

345
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:42,779
give that information.

346
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,060
So choose like the theoretical

347
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,370
trust threshold, say it's right

348
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:47,110
here, number of times exposed to

349
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:48,180
the brand, first brand

350
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,149
introduction, not ready to

351
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:49,759
purchase.

352
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:50,980
And then once they cross that

353
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:52,370
trust threshold, they're ready to

354
00:07:52,449 --> 00:07:53,779
purchase in every exposure.

355
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:54,720
After that, it doesn't mean

356
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,819
necessarily that they're going to

357
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:56,779
buy right at this point.

358
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,509
It just means they're ready and

359
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:00,350
they trust you enough to where if

360
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:01,850
you, if they have a strong enough

361
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:02,959
need for the product, if your

362
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:04,079
marketing is strong enough, they

363
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:05,779
trust you enough to buy.

364
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,779
So that's what that is.

365
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,639
But where it gets expensive is the

366
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:11,779
customer doesn't buy from your ad.

367
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,089
They get the first brand

368
00:08:13,089 --> 00:08:14,870
introduction and they don't buy

369
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,639
from you this time, this time,

370
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,769
this time, this time, this time.

371
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:20,959
The thing is each time costs

372
00:08:21,029 --> 00:08:21,779
money.

373
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:24,310
If you are using ads, you're just

374
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:25,800
constantly buying more ads to get

375
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,779
more visibility.

376
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:28,750
And so what happens, your expenses

377
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,779
go up and the cost of acquisition.

378
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:31,939
Every single time you're having to

379
00:08:31,939 --> 00:08:32,970
pay for a Facebook ad, you're

380
00:08:33,038 --> 00:08:34,240
paying for these clicks, the cost

381
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:36,230
of acquisition inevitably just is

382
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:37,620
going up to the point where

383
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,250
potentially you're just breaking

384
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:40,779
even on your first purchase.

385
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,059
That's what a lot of econ brands

386
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:43,240
are doing, especially with

387
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:43,779
margins.

388
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,730
Even if you have a 2X, 3X ROAS,

389
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:47,700
depends on your margins, you might

390
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,340
be breaking even on that first

391
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:51,230
purchase and you're hoping to make

392
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,779
it back in the back end.

393
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,509
And so that's where it really gets

394
00:08:54,509 --> 00:08:55,899
expensive, where cost of

395
00:08:55,899 --> 00:08:57,779
acquisition is a real problem.

396
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:59,100
Now let's talk about customer

397
00:08:59,110 --> 00:08:59,779
retention.

398
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:01,659
So kind of related to cost of

399
00:09:01,659 --> 00:09:03,529
acquisition, once you have your

400
00:09:03,529 --> 00:09:04,779
cost of acquisition price,

401
00:09:04,779 --> 00:09:06,139
somebody buys from you, what

402
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:07,779
happens after they buy from you?

403
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,000
Are they not buying again or are

404
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,179
they going to continue to come

405
00:09:10,179 --> 00:09:11,169
back because your cost of

406
00:09:11,169 --> 00:09:12,779
acquisition isn't going to change.

407
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,740
And so no matter what, if you have

408
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:16,779
a set $5 cost per acquisition,

409
00:09:16,779 --> 00:09:17,970
somebody buys from you once, you

410
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:19,769
have a set cost per acquisition,

411
00:09:19,779 --> 00:09:20,730
somebody buys from you twice, you

412
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:21,389
have more profit with that

413
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,320
customer because you don't have to

414
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:24,779
pay for cost of acquisition twice.

415
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,129
So we're talking about customer

416
00:09:26,129 --> 00:09:26,779
retention.

417
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,779
Your product just isn't enough.

418
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,389
Just relying on the quality of

419
00:09:30,389 --> 00:09:32,240
your product for retention used to

420
00:09:32,259 --> 00:09:32,779
work.

421
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:33,769
It used to be just if you have

422
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:34,970
something really good, people

423
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:35,779
would come back.

424
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:37,590
Like in 1900s, if you had good

425
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:39,120
pantaloons, people didn't have

426
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:39,779
options.

427
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,580
You had good enough pantaloons,

428
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,240
this dude would, you just have

429
00:09:43,259 --> 00:09:44,779
your customer for life.

430
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:45,769
That's all you had.

431
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:47,610
But today the modern customer is

432
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:49,779
spoiled because thanks to Shopify,

433
00:09:49,779 --> 00:09:51,049
there are just millions and

434
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:52,789
millions and millions of brands

435
00:09:52,789 --> 00:09:54,279
out there with new ones popping up

436
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:54,779
every day.

437
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:55,769
People just like new.

438
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,049
Even if your product is awesome,

439
00:09:57,049 --> 00:09:58,200
you have the best pantaloons in

440
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:58,779
the world.

441
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,169
People are curious what else are

442
00:10:00,169 --> 00:10:00,779
out there.

443
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:01,769
What other pantaloons are there?

444
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:02,769
What other styles are there?

445
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,070
And they can find them because

446
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:04,779
it's so easy.

447
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,779
They just pull out their phone,

448
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:08,779
but the pantaloons galore.

449
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:10,870
Whereas like in the past, you

450
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:12,779
didn't quite have that.

451
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:13,659
So we kind of just have the

452
00:10:13,659 --> 00:10:15,029
situation where it's like, hmm, I

453
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:15,779
like this brand.

454
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:17,549
I just saw this cool new young

455
00:10:17,549 --> 00:10:18,779
brand on TikTok.

456
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:19,769
Maybe I'll try them.

457
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,450
And so customer retention has been

458
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:22,889
going down with the increased

459
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:23,779
competition.

460
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:24,769
It's increasingly harder.

461
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:26,190
So what you need to do is you need

462
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:27,779
to maintain their attention.

463
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:28,769
You have their attention.

464
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:29,769
You got their purchase once.

465
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:30,769
You need to have a good product.

466
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:31,769
You need a good product.

467
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:33,779
But it's not game over from there.

468
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,779
It's not you're locked in.

469
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:36,610
You need to maintain their

470
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:37,669
attention and keep their loyalty

471
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:38,779
for them to keep coming back.

472
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:40,179
You need to keep building upon the

473
00:10:40,179 --> 00:10:41,490
attention you gathered or else

474
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:42,779
they're going to try someone else.

475
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:44,490
Many will just rely on continued

476
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:46,240
paid ads, which definitely will

477
00:10:46,259 --> 00:10:47,779
work in keeping attention.

478
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:49,779
Just continue to expose people.

479
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:50,769
That's very expensive.

480
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:51,460
It's kind of the basis of

481
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:52,419
everything that we're talking

482
00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:52,779
about.

483
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:53,769
Paid ads are very expensive.

484
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:54,769
You need ads.

485
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:55,769
Don't get me wrong.

486
00:10:55,809 --> 00:10:56,769
I'm not saying do not use ads.

487
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:58,779
You absolutely need them.

488
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,389
But what about your budget for

489
00:11:00,389 --> 00:11:02,129
acquiring new customers if you're

490
00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:04,279
spending so much on these past

491
00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:05,779
customers?

492
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:07,070
Better ways to go about it because

493
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:07,919
you constantly want to be

494
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:09,779
increasing your budget to acquire

495
00:11:09,779 --> 00:11:09,779
new customers.

496
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:12,779
So that's the main problem.

497
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:14,029
So we've talked about cost per

498
00:11:14,029 --> 00:11:14,779
acquisition.

499
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:15,769
Facebook ads going up.

500
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:17,190
People need to see your brand

501
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,779
multiple times to purchase.

502
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:19,769
That's not cheap.

503
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,409
And so cost of acquisition goes

504
00:11:21,409 --> 00:11:21,779
up.

505
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:22,769
And then with customer retention,

506
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:24,370
the problem with that is retention

507
00:11:24,429 --> 00:11:26,620
is low because there's so many

508
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:27,779
brands out there.

509
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:29,779
People want to try out new things.

510
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:30,460
People want to try these new

511
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:30,769
things.

512
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:31,769
They're seeing so many new things.

513
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,070
And so that leads to lower

514
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:34,860
profitability, which is problem

515
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:35,779
number three.

516
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:37,100
Revenue is awesome, but it means

517
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,779
absolutely nothing without profit.

518
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:39,399
You can't reinvest and grow

519
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:39,769
without it.

520
00:11:39,809 --> 00:11:40,769
I talked to a brand the other day.

521
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:42,289
They're doing a million dollars a

522
00:11:42,289 --> 00:11:42,779
month.

523
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:44,100
And then they just went out of

524
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:44,779
business.

525
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:46,009
You think they're doing a million

526
00:11:46,009 --> 00:11:46,779
dollars a month.

527
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:47,769
Holy cow.

528
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:48,769
Holy cow.

529
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:49,769
Holy cow.

530
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:50,769
They weren't profiting anything.

531
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:51,769
They were unprofitable.

532
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:53,110
They were taking, they were

533
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,350
spending more money than they were

534
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:54,779
making.

535
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:55,769
And so they failed.

536
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:57,100
And so revenue doesn't mean

537
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,519
anything, even if you're at a

538
00:11:58,519 --> 00:11:59,779
million a month plus.

539
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:00,769
It's very tough to overcome.

540
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,159
Profitability issues are a result

541
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:03,360
of one of the, both of the prior

542
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:05,500
problems of cost of acquisition

543
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,779
and customer retention.

544
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,179
In a perfect world, you would

545
00:12:08,179 --> 00:12:09,779
acquire customers for cheap.

546
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:11,769
So you acquire a customer for $1

547
00:12:11,769 --> 00:12:13,779
and you retain them for cheap.

548
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,110
They come back 10 plus times and

549
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,230
you don't really have to spend

550
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:16,779
anything.

551
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:17,769
That would be ideal.

552
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:18,769
That leads to the most profit.

553
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,220
However, you need to get new

554
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,840
attention to get your brand, to

555
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,779
your brand, to get new customers

556
00:12:22,779 --> 00:12:23,779
in.

557
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,779
That's, that's not a problem.

558
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:26,769
You need ads.

559
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:27,769
And so that's the problem.

560
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:29,779
Ad prices are higher than ever.

561
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:30,980
So it's very hard to acquire

562
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:32,779
customers for quote unquote cheap.

563
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,230
Cost of acquisition, we need to

564
00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:34,779
accept.

565
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:35,769
Yes, we want to minimize the cost,

566
00:12:35,779 --> 00:12:38,000
but we need to accept that it's

567
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:38,779
going to go up.

568
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,460
Cost of acquisition is going to go

569
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:40,779
up.

570
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:41,669
It's going to keep going up and

571
00:12:41,669 --> 00:12:42,779
it's going to keep being pricey.

572
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:43,220
Mr.

573
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:45,779
Zuck just has us in a chokehold.

574
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:47,620
We need him and so he can charge

575
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:49,240
whatever he wants and then we just

576
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:49,779
have to deal with it.

577
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,779
So this is how we maintain profit.

578
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:53,080
We need to pay for our site

579
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:53,779
traffic.

580
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,220
We need to pay to get the

581
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:56,919
attention with paid ads or

582
00:12:56,919 --> 00:12:57,779
whatever.

583
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,779
Paying for influencers, paying for

584
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:03,269
SEO, organic search, whatever you

585
00:13:03,269 --> 00:13:03,779
need to do.

586
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:04,769
UGC content.

587
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:05,769
We need, we need site traffic.

588
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:06,769
We need to bring it.

589
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:07,769
We need to get people in.

590
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,029
So the only way to maintain

591
00:13:09,029 --> 00:13:10,779
profitability is in the back end.

592
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,909
You're able to retain rather than

593
00:13:12,909 --> 00:13:14,779
spending more money on ads,

594
00:13:14,779 --> 00:13:15,779
influencers, all that stuff.

595
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,220
In the back end, you can retain

596
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:18,519
more profit by using cheaper

597
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:19,779
methods of retention, which

598
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:20,769
is email.

599
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,299
And so you'd be okay paying top

600
00:13:22,299 --> 00:13:23,940
dollar and you'd be comfortable

601
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:25,779
with your cost of acquisition

602
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:27,179
being high to acquire a customer

603
00:13:27,179 --> 00:13:28,519
if you knew that they would make

604
00:13:28,659 --> 00:13:29,779
10 plus purchases over

605
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:30,769
a lifetime.

606
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:32,039
So that's kind of like the concept

607
00:13:32,039 --> 00:13:32,779
on a wide level.

608
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:33,929
And we also want to talk about the

609
00:13:33,929 --> 00:13:34,779
top of mind effect.

610
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:36,379
So this is really how to solve all

611
00:13:36,379 --> 00:13:37,779
three problems at scale.

612
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,190
If you're always in the face of

613
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:40,960
your customer, you're going to, no

614
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:41,779
matter what, hold mental

615
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:42,769
real estate.

616
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:44,929
If you just, if you see a brand

617
00:13:44,929 --> 00:13:47,690
every day, like Coke, a lot, if

618
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:49,779
somebody says soda, it's

619
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,230
just the first brand that comes to

620
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:51,779
my mind.

621
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:53,779
They have top of mind.

622
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:54,980
Any given moment, they think about

623
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,100
industry or product, you want to

624
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:56,779
be the first brand

625
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:57,769
that comes to mind.

626
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:00,320
Because if Coke, somebody asks me,

627
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,779
do you want a soda?

628
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,009
And Coke is the first one that

629
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:03,779
comes to mind.

630
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:04,899
They don't have to pay cost of

631
00:14:04,899 --> 00:14:05,779
acquisition on me.

632
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,289
They don't have literally any

633
00:14:07,289 --> 00:14:08,779
costs directly with that.

634
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:10,100
So that's where that's super

635
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:10,779
valuable.

636
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,230
And email is the cheapest way to

637
00:14:12,279 --> 00:14:12,779
do this.

638
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:13,639
This way you and all your

639
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:14,730
customers will get the random

640
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:15,779
sales when the customer is going

641
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:16,950
about their day and think of a

642
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:18,190
need for you that your product

643
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:18,779
fulfills.

644
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:20,220
So sometimes you're just going

645
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:22,000
about your day and you're like, oh

646
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,779
shoot, I need laundry

647
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:24,769
detergent.

648
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:25,460
What's the first brand that comes

649
00:14:25,549 --> 00:14:25,769
to mind?

650
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:26,460
Whatever the first brand that

651
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:27,230
comes to mind is, that's what I'm

652
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:28,779
going to pull out my phone

653
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:31,659
and order on like Amazon or on the

654
00:14:31,659 --> 00:14:32,779
website.

655
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:33,769
I just thought of Tide.

656
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:35,730
And so I'd go like on Amazon,

657
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:37,909
search Tide, and then Tide just

658
00:14:37,909 --> 00:14:38,779
got that sale because they

659
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:40,779
hold top of mind for me.

660
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:43,080
And so that's kind of the way to

661
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:43,779
do it.

662
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,960
And email is the cheapest, costs

663
00:14:46,039 --> 00:14:47,779
pennies to send emails.

664
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:48,940
And it's just content, just like

665
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:49,779
any other platform.

666
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:50,769
And everybody checks email.

667
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:51,769
That's the thing.

668
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:52,769
Everybody checks their email.

669
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,080
If you're in their email, they

670
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:54,779
will see you.

671
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:55,769
They will see your brand.

672
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:58,269
And so that's why email is the

673
00:14:58,269 --> 00:14:59,779
best for that.

674
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:01,340
So let's talk about the old versus

675
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,779
the new e-commerce funnel.

676
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:03,769
So this was the old funnel.

677
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,779
What used to work fine.

678
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:07,809
Top of funnel is essentially

679
00:15:07,809 --> 00:15:09,779
attention acquisition.

680
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:11,120
So you have paid ads, referrals,

681
00:15:11,129 --> 00:15:12,759
word of mouth, SEO, organic social

682
00:15:12,759 --> 00:15:13,779
media, et cetera.

683
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:15,389
But most stuff is coming from paid

684
00:15:15,389 --> 00:15:15,779
ads.

685
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:16,769
So you're paying money.

686
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,639
You get site traffic and people

687
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:21,779
who don't buy like 99, 97.

688
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,450
Usually conversion rates are

689
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:25,779
between 1 and 3% for e-com stores.

690
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,460
And so they all leave and then

691
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,779
they go back to the top.

692
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:29,769
And then you pay more on paid ads.

693
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:32,139
You get whatever to bring you site

694
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:32,779
traffic.

695
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:34,059
And then eventually you'll get

696
00:15:34,059 --> 00:15:34,779
conversions.

697
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:35,870
That used to be fine when cost of

698
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:36,779
acquisition was low.

699
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:38,960
Paid ads were easy when you could

700
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:40,779
get a 6X ROAS easily.

701
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:42,779
That's not what we get now.

702
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:45,779
So this used to work okay.

703
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,110
And you could just keep, even if

704
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,909
people buy, you could pay more on

705
00:15:48,919 --> 00:15:49,779
this stuff.

706
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:52,370
Paid ads, pay for social media

707
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:54,779
teams to run your profiles.

708
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:57,360
That used to be okay, but now we

709
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:58,779
really can't.

710
00:15:58,860 --> 00:15:59,769
This is what's profitable now.

711
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,460
We need to have stuff in the back

712
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,779
end to retain profit.

713
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,700
We need to send as much content

714
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,539
cheaply as we can rather than

715
00:16:06,539 --> 00:16:07,779
spending more.

716
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:10,669
So this is why we have in-depth

717
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:13,269
and very strong ways to grow our

718
00:16:13,269 --> 00:16:13,779
email list.

719
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,669
So that we can be able to actually

720
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:17,779
contact these people for cheap.

721
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,220
And then they become an email

722
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:19,779
member.

723
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,509
And then we have strong systems

724
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:23,539
set up in the back end and systems

725
00:16:23,539 --> 00:16:24,779
and emails that repeat and send.

726
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,970
We have automation set up that are

727
00:16:27,029 --> 00:16:28,940
going to automate the customer

728
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:29,779
journey.

729
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:30,769
Give them a customized experience

730
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:31,779
and convert them at key parts.

731
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,960
Just like when they abandon

732
00:16:34,039 --> 00:16:36,779
checkout or abandon your site.

733
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:37,769
This is what we need.

734
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,139
And this is what's profitable

735
00:16:39,139 --> 00:16:39,779
right now.

736
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,220
So to summarize, increased

737
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:42,980
competition has made it very, very

738
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:44,429
difficult to scale your e-com

739
00:16:44,429 --> 00:16:45,779
brand profitably.

740
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:47,350
There are just a lot more e-com

741
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:48,860
brands and that's also why ad

742
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:49,779
prices are so high.

743
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,190
And cost of acquisition is going

744
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:52,779
up and retention is going down.

745
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,490
But email is the cheapest way to

746
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,179
nurture your customers into a

747
00:16:56,179 --> 00:16:56,779
purchase.

748
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:57,990
Which can help with lowering your

749
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:58,779
cost of acquisition.

750
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:00,169
Rather than showing somebody an ad

751
00:17:00,169 --> 00:17:01,779
10 times to get them a purchase.

752
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,779
Show them an ad once or twice.

753
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:04,769
Get them on the email list.

754
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:06,779
Send eight emails.

755
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,078
Much cheaper to lower your cost of

756
00:17:08,078 --> 00:17:08,779
acquisition.

757
00:17:08,859 --> 00:17:10,390
And then once you have them to

758
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:11,470
buy, you can retain them for

759
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:11,779
cheap.

760
00:17:11,859 --> 00:17:13,220
Get them into multi-time buyers

761
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:15,029
with email and keeping them

762
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:17,779
nurtured and holding top of mind.

763
00:17:17,859 --> 00:17:18,769
So that when they think of your

764
00:17:18,828 --> 00:17:19,920
brand, when they think of your

765
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,900
product or industry, you're the

766
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:22,779
one that comes to mind.

767
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:23,769
So that is the profitable

768
00:17:23,818 --> 00:17:24,779
e-commerce funnel.

769
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:26,568
This is essentially the basis that

770
00:17:26,568 --> 00:17:28,170
we will be talking about in this

771
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:28,779
course.

772
00:17:28,859 --> 00:17:30,779
So hopefully that all made sense.

773
00:17:30,859 --> 00:17:31,460
Let me know if you have any

774
00:17:31,579 --> 00:17:32,359
questions and we'll get to the

775
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:32,779
next one.

776
00:17:32,859 --> 00:17:33,109
Hello.

777
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:33,119
Hello.
