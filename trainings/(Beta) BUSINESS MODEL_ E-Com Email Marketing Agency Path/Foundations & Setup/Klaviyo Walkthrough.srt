1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:00,990
So now we're going to get into

2
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:02,290
some of the nitty-gritty, and then

3
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:02,990
I'm going to show you

4
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:04,799
inside Klaviyo, inside an actual

5
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:06,629
e-commerce brand's account, and

6
00:00:06,629 --> 00:00:07,980
just kind of like walk

7
00:00:08,009 --> 00:00:09,109
you around so you can get familiar

8
00:00:09,109 --> 00:00:09,539
with it.

9
00:00:09,619 --> 00:00:11,619
So right off the bat, here's just

10
00:00:11,619 --> 00:00:13,400
a diagram of the Klaviyo home

11
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,359
dashboard.

12
00:00:14,439 --> 00:00:16,289
And so just a quick walk through

13
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:18,559
here, we have this section here.

14
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,480
This is just going to be your

15
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:20,629
total store revenue, and they're

16
00:00:20,629 --> 00:00:21,469
just going to track that

17
00:00:21,559 --> 00:00:21,960
for you.

18
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:23,600
And so there's a total store

19
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,670
revenue from Shopify, and this is

20
00:00:25,699 --> 00:00:27,190
going to be your Klaviyo

21
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,339
attributed revenue.

22
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:30,429
So how much money actually came

23
00:00:30,429 --> 00:00:32,520
from email and SMS marketing if

24
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,380
it's inside of Klaviyo?

25
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:35,899
That's what this tells you.

26
00:00:35,979 --> 00:00:37,710
And something to note, you can't

27
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,259
take the attributed revenue

28
00:00:39,259 --> 00:00:40,500
straight to heart.

29
00:00:40,579 --> 00:00:43,189
Like $28,000 here is directly

30
00:00:43,189 --> 00:00:44,719
attributed to email.

31
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:47,229
Attributions, it can never be

32
00:00:47,229 --> 00:00:49,950
perfect because imagine you open

33
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:52,429
an email, you click onto the

34
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,090
site, and then you don't purchase,

35
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:55,840
and then a day later, you're like,

36
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:56,920
oh yeah, that email.

37
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:58,729
That reminds me, I forgot to

38
00:00:58,740 --> 00:00:59,270
purchase.

39
00:00:59,329 --> 00:01:00,369
And then you go back and purchase,

40
00:01:00,369 --> 00:01:01,250
it's like, how is that being

41
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:01,840
attributed?

42
00:01:01,869 --> 00:01:03,770
So Klaviyo, typically they say,

43
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:05,670
somebody clicks an email and they

44
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:06,549
purchase.

45
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,840
Within three to five days, they

46
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,900
count it as email revenue.

47
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:12,040
So usually it's a little bit

48
00:01:12,049 --> 00:01:13,500
inflated, but there's no perfect

49
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,299
way to track it.

50
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,890
Some to note there with Klaviyo

51
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:17,180
attributed revenue.

52
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:18,799
And then right here, you can see

53
00:01:18,819 --> 00:01:20,019
the percentage of your total

54
00:01:20,019 --> 00:01:21,359
revenue that comes from email

55
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:21,969
and SMS marketing.

56
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:23,189
So typically you want to be

57
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:24,879
anywhere from 30 to 50%.

58
00:01:24,909 --> 00:01:26,519
If you're over that, say you're at

59
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,409
like 60%, that tells you, okay,

60
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:29,480
let's funnel some of

61
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:30,799
our profits back into paid ads.

62
00:01:31,099 --> 00:01:33,920
If you're anywhere under 30%, 40%,

63
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,870
then that tells you, okay, our

64
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:37,560
email systems can be improved.

65
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,400
And then right here, there's

66
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,700
another important part, campaigns

67
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,340
versus flows revenue.

68
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:45,219
Here, this is just the percentage

69
00:01:45,219 --> 00:01:47,159
of revenue coming from campaigns,

70
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:48,569
the one-time emails sent

71
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:49,000
to your list.

72
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:50,159
And this is the percentage that's

73
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:51,310
coming from flows, which are the

74
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,129
automated emails.

75
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:53,939
Typically you want to be around

76
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:56,859
50-50 or 40-60, 60-40, anywhere in

77
00:01:56,859 --> 00:01:57,640
that range.

78
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:58,959
Depends on the business setup, but

79
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,150
in most cases, that's what you

80
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:01,040
want to shoot for.

81
00:02:01,069 --> 00:02:02,420
So if you look at a brand like

82
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:04,269
this and you see 14% from flows,

83
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,799
that tells you like, okay,

84
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:06,939
the flows could use a lot of

85
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:07,719
improvement.

86
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:09,710
And then up here, if you want to

87
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:11,979
change the dashboard analytics,

88
00:02:11,979 --> 00:02:13,900
you can just click on time period.

89
00:02:13,939 --> 00:02:15,069
And so right now we can see this

90
00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:16,849
is doing January 27th, 2024 to

91
00:02:16,849 --> 00:02:18,520
February 26th, 2024.

92
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:19,939
So a 30-day period.

93
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:21,680
And it's comparing these numbers.

94
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:23,620
If you see over previous period,

95
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,020
the comparison period is just the

96
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,240
prior 30-day period.

97
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:27,810
So that's the main dashboard.

98
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,090
And then you have top performing

99
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:29,879
flows down here.

100
00:02:29,909 --> 00:02:31,229
So you have the name of the flows

101
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,560
and then like how much revenue

102
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,199
they did and then percent change.

103
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,689
Then over here, this is the main

104
00:02:35,689 --> 00:02:36,240
nav bar.

105
00:02:36,259 --> 00:02:37,590
I'll show you around here.

106
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,680
Your brand name will be here.

107
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:39,789
And then you have just the

108
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,379
different sections of Klaviyo.

109
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:43,449
So let's go over to this live

110
00:02:43,449 --> 00:02:45,060
Klaviyo account.

111
00:02:45,139 --> 00:02:46,710
This is a completely new brand,

112
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,460
fresh brand, just started.

113
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:50,240
And let's just walk around Klaviyo

114
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:50,719
here.

115
00:02:51,979 --> 00:02:53,860
We have the homepage just like I

116
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:56,439
showed you, only $590 in the last

117
00:02:56,439 --> 00:02:59,189
30 days, only $47 from email.

118
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,020
And yeah, let's just go through.

119
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:03,759
So we have the homepage here.

120
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,430
And then we have campaigns, flows,

121
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,289
reviews, sign-up forms, audience,

122
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:08,979
which is a drop-down, content,

123
00:03:08,979 --> 00:03:10,590
which is a drop-down here, and

124
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:12,080
then analytics as well.

125
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:13,819
So let's look at campaigns.

126
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,990
So campaigns, this is where you

127
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:18,080
send the campaigns to your huge

128
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,330
email list or certain segments of

129
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:21,719
your email list.

130
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,560
The campaigns are the emails where

131
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,120
you click a button and they send

132
00:03:25,259 --> 00:03:26,650
right away or schedule.

133
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:28,689
And so if you click create a

134
00:03:28,699 --> 00:03:30,469
campaign up here, you can name

135
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,719
something, test campaign, test

136
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:34,789
campaign, select the date.

137
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,610
Maybe we want to send it for March

138
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:37,199
5th.

139
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:38,219
Save and continue.

140
00:03:38,289 --> 00:03:39,159
We want to do an email.

141
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,680
And then we get taken to

142
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,169
recipients page, which is, okay,

143
00:03:43,169 --> 00:03:45,039
who do we want to send to?

144
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,860
You can pick who you want to send

145
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:47,919
to newsletter.

146
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,150
Who you don't want to send to,

147
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:50,620
make sure they're filtered out.

148
00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:51,689
Let's not send to news

149
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:52,710
subscriptions.

150
00:03:52,819 --> 00:03:55,159
Skip recently emailed profiles.

151
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,289
Typically, you want to send that

152
00:03:56,289 --> 00:03:56,560
off.

153
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:58,129
Continue to content.

154
00:03:58,289 --> 00:03:59,289
And then this is going to be your

155
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,159
actual email builder.

156
00:04:00,189 --> 00:04:01,810
So this is your subject line.

157
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:02,830
So I'm sure you know what a

158
00:04:02,849 --> 00:04:03,699
subject line is.

159
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,849
And then preview text, preview.

160
00:04:05,939 --> 00:04:08,099
And that's essentially just like

161
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:10,180
completely, that's how you do

162
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:11,280
everything.

163
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,280
And so then we have here drag and

164
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,500
drop is what, how you can, that's

165
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,360
how I recommend creating your

166
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:17,680
emails.

167
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:19,089
So you can see inside Klaviyo,

168
00:04:19,089 --> 00:04:20,569
they have a ton of templates that

169
00:04:20,569 --> 00:04:21,139
you can use.

170
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:22,279
If you just want to use this

171
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,779
template or you can create a blank

172
00:04:23,779 --> 00:04:24,269
email.

173
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:27,629
For this sake, let's just use a

174
00:04:27,629 --> 00:04:30,620
template and we can move things

175
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:31,759
around.

176
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:33,399
So let's do something like this.

177
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,180
Let's use template.

178
00:04:35,259 --> 00:04:36,790
And then we'll be taken into the

179
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,860
Klaviyo editor.

180
00:04:37,939 --> 00:04:40,029
More will, I'll show you more

181
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:41,720
about this later on.

182
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,259
But this is the Klaviyo editor.

183
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,649
You have different blocks that you

184
00:04:44,649 --> 00:04:45,990
can drag, like a text block.

185
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:48,220
You have image blocks.

186
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,310
Everything that you need is right

187
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:50,920
here.

188
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,240
But super simple.

189
00:04:52,339 --> 00:04:54,149
You just edit the text however you

190
00:04:54,149 --> 00:04:54,819
want to.

191
00:04:54,899 --> 00:04:57,399
And you can view on desktop and

192
00:04:57,399 --> 00:05:00,149
then how it will look on mobile as

193
00:05:00,149 --> 00:05:01,000
well.

194
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:02,319
So super simple.

195
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:03,930
Super easy.

196
00:05:04,019 --> 00:05:06,009
And yeah, that's kind of how that

197
00:05:06,009 --> 00:05:06,639
works.

198
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:07,480
And then say it's complete.

199
00:05:07,579 --> 00:05:08,420
Click save.

200
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,490
And then you can continue to

201
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,410
review.

202
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,740
And then this is where you would

203
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:13,420
send it out.

204
00:05:13,449 --> 00:05:14,579
You're just ready to send it.

205
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:15,759
Schedule or send.

206
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:16,829
And boom.

207
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,560
That's how you do it.

208
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,480
Now let's go to the flows tab.

209
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,480
Their flow is set up for this

210
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,259
brand.

211
00:05:22,339 --> 00:05:23,610
And so you have all the different

212
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:24,740
triggers for these are the

213
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:25,660
automated flows.

214
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:26,779
So browse abandoned, cart

215
00:05:26,779 --> 00:05:28,199
abandoned, checkout abandoned,

216
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:29,600
post-purchase, site abandoned,

217
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,930
sunset, welcome, win back.

218
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:32,430
These are the recommended flows

219
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:33,639
when just starting out.

220
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:35,379
So you'll be able to see the

221
00:05:35,379 --> 00:05:37,569
revenue, oops, revenue, revenue

222
00:05:37,589 --> 00:05:38,689
per recipient.

223
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,170
Everything of that matter will be

224
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:40,980
recorded here.

225
00:05:41,009 --> 00:05:42,550
So if we like went to, I mean,

226
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,069
let's go to like the checkout

227
00:05:44,069 --> 00:05:45,199
abandoned flow.

228
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,350
Then you'll be able to see like

229
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:48,170
the flow journey.

230
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:50,300
So what's happening in the flow?

231
00:05:50,329 --> 00:05:51,649
We're sending where the trigger's

232
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:52,279
happening.

233
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,819
We're sending a time delay.

234
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,110
And then we're sending an email,

235
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:57,699
another time delay, another email.

236
00:05:57,779 --> 00:05:59,000
And then we're splitting by the

237
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,019
different products.

238
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,399
What did they leave behind in

239
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:02,170
their order?

240
00:06:02,259 --> 00:06:03,300
And then more emails.

241
00:06:03,379 --> 00:06:04,779
And this is like the editor.

242
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,600
You drag in emails that you want

243
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,639
to do for the customer journey.

244
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,500
Time delay is here.

245
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:14,250
And then just like with campaigns,

246
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:16,569
if you just click on to here and

247
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:19,120
click edit, then you'll actually

248
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,620
be able to edit the emails that

249
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:21,379
are inside.

250
00:06:21,459 --> 00:06:22,829
And so, and then it's just going

251
00:06:22,829 --> 00:06:24,199
to look just like campaigns in

252
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:25,399
designing a campaign.

253
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:26,959
So this is just like seeing how

254
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:28,300
the flows are mapped.

255
00:06:28,379 --> 00:06:29,889
So let me zoom out here.

256
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:32,540
Exit, and that's flows.

257
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,100
And then we have, if you do

258
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,230
reviews inside of Klaviyo, you can

259
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:37,139
do it here.

260
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:38,350
Or if you use a different

261
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:40,040
platform, then that's fine.

262
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,310
But if you want to add reviews,

263
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:42,629
you can add review emails here.

264
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,980
And then, important, we have

265
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:46,360
sign-up forms.

266
00:06:46,459 --> 00:06:48,819
So sign-up forms are essentially

267
00:06:48,819 --> 00:06:51,509
the, like, pop-ups and embed forms

268
00:06:51,509 --> 00:06:53,740
and everything like that.

269
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:56,149
So, yeah, and again, these numbers

270
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:57,319
are really bad.

271
00:06:57,399 --> 00:06:58,930
And because typically you want to

272
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:00,720
shoot for 6% to 12% of your total

273
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:01,740
email revenue.

274
00:07:01,819 --> 00:07:04,180
Or 6% to 12% of your total site

275
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:05,040
traffic.

276
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,339
And so you can see here with this

277
00:07:06,339 --> 00:07:07,439
form, this mobile form is

278
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:09,199
converting 0.7% of people who view

279
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:09,839
the site.

280
00:07:10,149 --> 00:07:12,000
So if 1,000 people view the site,

281
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,740
what is that?

282
00:07:12,819 --> 00:07:14,829
Seven people are purchasing?

283
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,660
That's, or seven people are

284
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:17,620
signing up.

285
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:18,459
That's not what you want.

286
00:07:18,579 --> 00:07:20,379
You want to be at least 6% to 12%.

287
00:07:20,459 --> 00:07:21,730
Excuse me.

288
00:07:21,769 --> 00:07:23,019
So if you have 1,000 people

289
00:07:23,019 --> 00:07:24,769
viewing your site, you want to

290
00:07:24,769 --> 00:07:28,870
have at least 60 to 120 people.

291
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:31,100
As for mobile, same as desktop.

292
00:07:31,129 --> 00:07:32,019
You have these different forms.

293
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:33,720
And then creating sign-up forms.

294
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:34,560
We'll go over this later.

295
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,490
But you essentially just create a

296
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:38,230
template and then put it on your

297
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:39,959
site and you're good to go.

298
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,899
Now let's talk about the audience

299
00:07:41,899 --> 00:07:42,620
section.

300
00:07:42,699 --> 00:07:45,870
Audience, you have exactly as you

301
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:46,649
want.

302
00:07:46,779 --> 00:07:48,600
Exactly how it sounds.

303
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,360
Growth tools.

304
00:07:49,389 --> 00:07:50,670
If you just want to have, like, an

305
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:51,949
overview of, like, what growth

306
00:07:51,949 --> 00:07:52,720
tools you use.

307
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,680
I really, like, I'm inside a lot

308
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,509
of Klaviyo accounts and I never

309
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:57,720
visit this page.

310
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,149
I never really view profiles

311
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,509
either because if you're looking

312
00:08:00,509 --> 00:08:02,089
for somebody specific, you can

313
00:08:02,129 --> 00:08:02,819
search for someone.

314
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:04,680
But really, all that really

315
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,759
matters is you want the lists and

316
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:07,670
segments.

317
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,980
And so lists and segments is where

318
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:12,379
you can create different segments

319
00:08:12,379 --> 00:08:14,189
of your email list based on

320
00:08:14,189 --> 00:08:15,370
conditions.

321
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:16,790
So you can see here, like, in

322
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:18,589
gauge 60 days, we can look at this

323
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,230
list and we can see this person,

324
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:22,939
in order for these 258 members,

325
00:08:22,939 --> 00:08:24,699
these people have to be in the

326
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,759
newsletter.

327
00:08:25,899 --> 00:08:27,230
They have to have opened email at

328
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:28,800
least once in the last 60 days or

329
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,300
clicked an email in the last 60

330
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:31,629
days or they've been recently

331
00:08:31,629 --> 00:08:32,940
added to the newsletter in the

332
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,038
last 30 days.

333
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,529
And so that's how these segments

334
00:08:36,529 --> 00:08:37,210
work.

335
00:08:37,259 --> 00:08:38,259
You can segment by all these

336
00:08:38,288 --> 00:08:39,139
different things.

337
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:40,960
Let's walk through one here.

338
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:42,220
Create segment.

339
00:08:42,298 --> 00:08:44,820
Let's do test.

340
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,360
And then we can say we can say

341
00:08:47,389 --> 00:08:49,320
abandoners, people who have

342
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,080
abandoned something.

343
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:53,230
So you go to definition here and

344
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:55,389
then just fill out whatever you

345
00:08:55,389 --> 00:08:56,080
want.

346
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:57,399
Let's do what somebody has done.

347
00:08:57,419 --> 00:08:59,019
I'm going to say they checkout

348
00:08:59,019 --> 00:08:59,720
started.

349
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:01,809
So they started checkout at least

350
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,899
once in the last 30 days.

351
00:09:03,929 --> 00:09:04,509
We'll do that.

352
00:09:06,299 --> 00:09:08,700
And then let's just do that.

353
00:09:08,779 --> 00:09:10,559
And they've placed order zero

354
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:12,620
times in the last 30 days.

355
00:09:12,649 --> 00:09:13,750
So what this is going to tell us

356
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:14,860
is people who have abandoned

357
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:16,340
checkout in the last 30 days.

358
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,399
And then we can create the

359
00:09:17,409 --> 00:09:17,929
segment.

360
00:09:18,019 --> 00:09:19,779
And then we'll be able to see how

361
00:09:19,779 --> 00:09:21,879
many people actually did that.

362
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:27,940
Quick water break.

363
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:29,529
And so that's the segments.

364
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:30,799
Let's wait for this one to load.

365
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:31,559
All right.

366
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:32,169
The segment loaded.

367
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,330
And you can see that there are

368
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:34,639
eight members who did that.

369
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,950
They met these conditions of

370
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:36,960
checkout started.

371
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:39,639
But placed order.

372
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,720
They did place.

373
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,039
Okay.

374
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,000
So I messed up the definition.

375
00:09:43,029 --> 00:09:43,899
So this is great.

376
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,399
Great example of being able to

377
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:45,960
update.

378
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:46,759
So you just go to update

379
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:47,919
definition if you want to change

380
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:48,240
it.

381
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,769
And then we'll do placed order

382
00:09:49,769 --> 00:09:50,580
zero times.

383
00:09:50,659 --> 00:09:53,419
So they've checkout started.

384
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,740
But they've actually placed order

385
00:09:54,779 --> 00:09:55,360
zero times.

386
00:09:55,389 --> 00:09:56,610
And then we're going to have, it

387
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:58,610
looks like, two are going to meet

388
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:00,210
this requirement.

389
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,889
But let's check it out.

390
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,460
And, yep, so this loaded up.

391
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:04,539
And there have been two people in

392
00:10:04,539 --> 00:10:05,700
the last 30 days who meet these

393
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:06,850
requirements of checkout

394
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,409
started at least once and placed

395
00:10:08,409 --> 00:10:09,909
order zero times in the last 30

396
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:10,360
days.

397
00:10:10,389 --> 00:10:11,970
So segments are very useful to get

398
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:13,659
different levels of engagement of

399
00:10:13,659 --> 00:10:14,220
your list

400
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:14,950
and just get a better

401
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:16,179
understanding of where they're at

402
00:10:16,179 --> 00:10:17,240
in the customer journey.

403
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:20,629
So next we can go to content.

404
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:21,779
This is where if you want to

405
00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:23,200
create templates for your brand,

406
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:24,840
you can create templates.

407
00:10:24,919 --> 00:10:27,139
You can look at past templates.

408
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,440
And then say you have a template

409
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,120
that you like,

410
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,710
you can save it in the saved

411
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,159
templates section.

412
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,600
And that's where you can do that.

413
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:35,210
So if you want to create a

414
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,529
template, you can just create a

415
00:10:36,529 --> 00:10:37,549
blank email up here.

416
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:38,809
It's going to take you to just the

417
00:10:38,809 --> 00:10:39,899
regular email builder.

418
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,429
And you can go from there, put in

419
00:10:41,429 --> 00:10:43,110
all your logos, put in all your

420
00:10:43,129 --> 00:10:44,379
colors, all that stuff.

421
00:10:45,139 --> 00:10:45,889
Then if you want to go to

422
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:47,289
products, again, I don't really

423
00:10:47,289 --> 00:10:48,860
use this, but that's there.

424
00:10:48,889 --> 00:10:50,019
Images and branding.

425
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,179
So this will get put into like

426
00:10:52,179 --> 00:10:54,049
unsubscribed pages.

427
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,110
So you can upload images there and

428
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:56,960
name them.

429
00:10:57,039 --> 00:10:58,039
Then you have coupons.

430
00:10:58,070 --> 00:10:59,350
If you want to create coupons

431
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:00,889
inside of Klaviyo, which we will

432
00:11:00,889 --> 00:11:01,879
talk about later,

433
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,120
then you can do that here.

434
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,440
And then you have what's very

435
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:06,340
useful as well.

436
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:07,980
So kind of the main things that

437
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,730
you use on Klaviyo is the homepage

438
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:11,179
for an overall look.

439
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:12,379
You have campaigns for actually

440
00:11:12,379 --> 00:11:12,830
sending.

441
00:11:12,889 --> 00:11:14,120
You spend most of your time here,

442
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,080
campaigns and flows.

443
00:11:16,039 --> 00:11:17,509
And then you have the audience,

444
00:11:17,509 --> 00:11:19,409
lists and segments, pop-up forms,

445
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,759
and then you have the analytics.

446
00:11:20,789 --> 00:11:22,409
So typically, I just look at the

447
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,299
dashboards.

448
00:11:23,379 --> 00:11:25,389
You also have metrics and you have

449
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,240
all this other fun stuff.

450
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:28,889
So you can go to dashboards and

451
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,539
you can look at your analytics

452
00:11:30,539 --> 00:11:32,299
over whatever period you want.

453
00:11:32,379 --> 00:11:33,950
And it will give you all the

454
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:35,679
information you need.

455
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:36,889
If you want to look at a specific

456
00:11:36,889 --> 00:11:38,120
thing, you can add a card.

457
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,490
You can create an analytic from

458
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:40,690
scratch or use some of their

459
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:41,519
pre-made ones.

460
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:43,210
Super cool, super easy.

461
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:46,340
And yeah, you can create new

462
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,889
dashboards as well if you want to

463
00:11:47,899 --> 00:11:49,980
do something like specific to just

464
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:50,889
campaigns dashboard

465
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,220
and only show campaign stats,

466
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:53,120
flows dashboard.

467
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:53,929
Super easy.

468
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,159
I use dashboards a lot.

469
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,379
You have experiments, which is

470
00:11:57,379 --> 00:11:58,759
just A to B tests.

471
00:11:58,789 --> 00:11:59,700
You can see your A to B tests that

472
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:00,350
you're running.

473
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,840
And then you have metrics.

474
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:03,049
You can see what's actually

475
00:12:03,049 --> 00:12:03,490
firing.

476
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:04,830
So like, for example, added to

477
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:06,240
cart, we had to add manually.

478
00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:07,169
Let's see if it's firing

479
00:12:07,169 --> 00:12:07,799
correctly.

480
00:12:07,879 --> 00:12:09,120
Yes, people are actually

481
00:12:09,159 --> 00:12:10,909
abandoning or adding to their cart

482
00:12:10,909 --> 00:12:12,350
and it's being tracked.

483
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,389
That's perfect.

484
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:14,629
And then you have all these

485
00:12:14,649 --> 00:12:15,899
different metrics where you can

486
00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:17,240
actually track how often they're

487
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:17,710
being triggered.

488
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,259
We have benchmarks.

489
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,539
This is helpful if you don't

490
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:22,049
really know what you're doing in

491
00:12:22,049 --> 00:12:23,700
terms of like email marketing.

492
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:25,759
So you can collect your, you can

493
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:27,360
put your industry and access

494
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,360
benchmarks for that industry.

495
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,440
Looks like there was an error

496
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:31,720
there, but you'll be able to see

497
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,840
like what open rates should I

498
00:12:32,899 --> 00:12:34,210
shoot for, what click rates, and

499
00:12:34,269 --> 00:12:34,860
all that jazz.

500
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:36,639
You have deliverability here.

501
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,659
And then you have custom reports

502
00:12:38,659 --> 00:12:39,240
here.

503
00:12:39,269 --> 00:12:40,179
If you want custom reports to be

504
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:40,889
sent to your email.

505
00:12:41,259 --> 00:12:42,820
And then conversations.

506
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:44,379
So essentially just SMS.

507
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:45,679
What are people responding back

508
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:46,029
with?

509
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:48,330
And so, yeah, that's essentially

510
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:50,360
the full Klaviyo walkthrough of

511
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,220
just like on a base level.

512
00:12:52,299 --> 00:12:53,559
What do all these sections take

513
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,129
you to and what is their purpose?
