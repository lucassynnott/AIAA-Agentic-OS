1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:02,569
So I wanted to briefly go over

2
00:00:02,569 --> 00:00:05,509
deliverability metrics and kind of

3
00:00:05,589 --> 00:00:08,439
where you want to be in stand as

4
00:00:08,449 --> 00:00:10,820
far as like all the metrics.

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,160
I don't look too, too, too much

6
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,529
into these besides open rates,

7
00:00:15,529 --> 00:00:17,469
which we'll talk about in a

8
00:00:17,469 --> 00:00:18,460
second.

9
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:20,960
A lot of them, it's really hard to

10
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,510
gauge metrics because every brand

11
00:00:23,649 --> 00:00:26,079
is different, every audience is

12
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:27,140
different.

13
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,769
It's really hard to say like this

14
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:30,079
is the number you want to be at.

15
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:31,039
That's just not how it works.

16
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:31,800
So it's very fluid.

17
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:33,479
But like these are like general

18
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:35,119
numbers of where you want to be

19
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:35,969
open rates.

20
00:00:36,039 --> 00:00:38,100
We want to make sure we're above

21
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,600
45 percent across our flows and

22
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,920
our campaigns.

23
00:00:41,979 --> 00:00:44,390
If you're lower than 45 percent,

24
00:00:44,409 --> 00:00:46,320
all you can do is for the emails

25
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,859
that you're sending in campaigns,

26
00:00:48,859 --> 00:00:50,479
if they're lower than 45 percent,

27
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:52,450
just create a segment of people

28
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,429
who have opened an email in the

29
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:56,420
past 30 days and only send to

30
00:00:56,439 --> 00:00:57,280
those people.

31
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,149
You pump your open rates just by

32
00:00:59,149 --> 00:01:00,750
only sending to people who open

33
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:01,619
your emails.

34
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:03,320
That helps a ton.

35
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:04,629
If you send campaigns to those

36
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:05,950
people, you'll slowly start

37
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:07,379
increasing your reputation and

38
00:01:07,379 --> 00:01:08,689
then your flow open rates will

39
00:01:08,689 --> 00:01:09,859
start to rise as well.

40
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,010
So greater than 45 percent is

41
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:13,840
where we want to be at with our

42
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,819
open rates.

43
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:16,459
Don't want to be lower than that.

44
00:01:16,519 --> 00:01:18,370
If you're lower, do that or

45
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:20,560
there's going to be a six-week

46
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,799
delivery recovery protocol in

47
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,280
another module.

48
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:26,060
So make sure you're doing that.

49
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,180
Click rates.

50
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:28,430
So what's the rate at which

51
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:30,040
somebody clicks your email?

52
00:01:30,099 --> 00:01:31,480
We want to be greater than 1

53
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,760
percent here ideally.

54
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:33,819
Now, this is less of a

55
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:35,219
deliverability thing and more of

56
00:01:35,219 --> 00:01:36,719
an email design and content thing,

57
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:37,980
but I get asked about click rates

58
00:01:38,109 --> 00:01:38,540
a lot.

59
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:39,750
So ideally, we want to be at 1

60
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,299
percent.

61
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:42,290
Big brands, sometimes you can have

62
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:42,859
less.

63
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,700
I have one brand whose average

64
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,200
click rates are 0.6 percent, and

65
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,900
they're eight figures.

66
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:49,950
We're sending to like a

67
00:01:50,109 --> 00:01:51,510
million-person list every time

68
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:52,439
we're sending.

69
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,959
And you know what?

70
00:01:54,019 --> 00:01:55,140
That's okay to be a little bit

71
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:55,560
lower.

72
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:57,239
That'll happen.

73
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,099
But we have perfect

74
00:01:58,109 --> 00:01:58,859
deliverability.

75
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,150
Our inbox placement rate is

76
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:01,200
super-duper high.

77
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:02,829
And so it's like not as much of a

78
00:02:02,829 --> 00:02:03,540
concern.

79
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:04,590
It's more of a design issue.

80
00:02:04,659 --> 00:02:05,780
If you're a smaller brand, you're

81
00:02:05,819 --> 00:02:07,120
sending to less than 5,000 to

82
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,800
10,000 people, and you're under 1

83
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:10,030
percent, it's going to be a design

84
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:10,560
thing.

85
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:12,060
So refer to the design modules.

86
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,159
Bounce rate, less than 1 percent.

87
00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:17,460
Ideally, way less than that, 0.5

88
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:18,180
percent.

89
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,310
But bounce rate is essentially

90
00:02:20,389 --> 00:02:22,259
emails like that didn't get

91
00:02:22,259 --> 00:02:24,800
delivered for whatever reason.

92
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,710
Either it's like a blocked email

93
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:28,669
or it's a fake email that doesn't

94
00:02:28,669 --> 00:02:29,340
exist.

95
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,219
Those are all bounces.

96
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,439
We want to make sure we have less

97
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:32,569
than 1 percent on all of our

98
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:33,120
emails.

99
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,930
So you can just create an

100
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:37,310
exclusion segment in your email

101
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:39,080
sending, which is just like if

102
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,310
somebody's bounced an email at

103
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:41,599
least once over all time, then

104
00:02:41,669 --> 00:02:43,340
we're just going to remove them.

105
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,560
So that's bounce rate.

106
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:45,310
Make sure you're less than 1

107
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:45,610
percent.

108
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:47,400
Spam complaint rate.

109
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:49,780
So this is tough to track because

110
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,110
sometimes people will do it

111
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:52,460
directly with Gmail and not in

112
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:53,219
Klaviyo.

113
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,719
But we want to be less than 0.01

114
00:02:55,719 --> 00:02:56,539
percent.

115
00:02:56,599 --> 00:02:59,879
0.05 percent is really where we

116
00:02:59,889 --> 00:03:01,240
want to be at.

117
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,759
The spam complaint rate.

118
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:04,060
This can harm your inbox

119
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:04,879
placement.

120
00:03:04,939 --> 00:03:06,229
So you want to make sure your spam

121
00:03:06,229 --> 00:03:06,659
is low.

122
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:07,800
But it's tough to track.

123
00:03:08,699 --> 00:03:10,280
Really, you're going to be raising

124
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,060
red flags if you're over like 0.1

125
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,000
to 2 percent.

126
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:15,250
But ideally, we want to be lower

127
00:03:15,259 --> 00:03:17,500
than 0.01 percent.

128
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,099
Unsubscribe rate.

129
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:20,770
This actually doesn't affect

130
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:22,180
deliverability because

131
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,889
unsubscribes are natural.

132
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,150
You want people to unsubscribe who

133
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:26,580
don't want to receive your emails.

134
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:27,500
Like that's totally fine.

135
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,849
We want to be less than 0.5

136
00:03:28,849 --> 00:03:30,259
percent though so that we can keep

137
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,300
people on our list.

138
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,639
Unsubscribe rate.

139
00:03:32,699 --> 00:03:33,979
If you're lower, if you're higher

140
00:03:33,979 --> 00:03:35,780
than 0.5 percent, like 1 percent,

141
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:37,979
then you probably have some issues

142
00:03:37,979 --> 00:03:38,870
going on with your content.

143
00:03:38,939 --> 00:03:40,180
You're not sending good enough

144
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:41,430
emails to these people to keep

145
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,520
them engaged in wanting to

146
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:44,159
continue to be subscribed to you.

147
00:03:44,219 --> 00:03:45,759
So these are the base metrics.

148
00:03:45,819 --> 00:03:46,879
Main one is open rates that we

149
00:03:46,979 --> 00:03:48,099
really want to pay attention to

150
00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:49,360
because that's going to have the

151
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,219
biggest impact.
