1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:01,770
Okay, today we are talking about

2
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:03,879
the 3.5 pillars

3
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,879
of email marketing.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,160
Sounds kind of weird to have 3.5,

5
00:00:08,179 --> 00:00:09,800
but we're gonna get into that.

6
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:10,769
These are literally the only

7
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:11,500
things that matter

8
00:00:11,539 --> 00:00:12,849
with email marketing, everything

9
00:00:12,849 --> 00:00:13,759
else is just noise.

10
00:00:13,779 --> 00:00:14,990
If you just double down on these,

11
00:00:15,009 --> 00:00:16,859
these are the 20,

12
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:18,980
these carry 80% of the results.

13
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,160
The 80/20 rule, the 20%, if you

14
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,399
just dial in these,

15
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:23,339
this is all you need.

16
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:25,420
So we're talking about these 3.5

17
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:26,089
pillars.

18
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:28,359
They're really only 3.5 things

19
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:29,940
that actually matter.

20
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,120
When you're under a million

21
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:31,920
dollars a month,

22
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:33,109
you should just be putting all of

23
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:33,579
your time

24
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,280
into these three and a half

25
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:35,880
pillars

26
00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:37,380
until you reach that point.

27
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:38,299
Then when you're at a million a

28
00:00:38,299 --> 00:00:38,609
month,

29
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,359
like the little

30
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:40,460
micro-optimizations

31
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:42,549
and the fancy stuff, those can

32
00:00:42,549 --> 00:00:44,060
definitely help.

33
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:45,369
But that's only when you should

34
00:00:45,369 --> 00:00:46,420
start getting fancy.

35
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:48,799
Let's just focus on dialing in the

36
00:00:48,979 --> 00:00:49,560
basics

37
00:00:49,579 --> 00:00:51,420
and do them really well.

38
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:55,060
It's quite overwhelming as well.

39
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:56,020
If you're seeing all these

40
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:57,420
different noise with AI,

41
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:58,890
all these advanced automations,

42
00:00:58,929 --> 00:00:59,840
yada, yada, yada,

43
00:00:59,899 --> 00:01:01,270
it just makes you stop doing these

44
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:01,740
things.

45
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:03,920
So I'm telling you, just focus on

46
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,060
these three, three and a half

47
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:05,819
things

48
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,180
and everything else, ignore it

49
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:09,159
until you're at a mil a month.

50
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,079
Just, it's gonna make your life a

51
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:11,939
lot easier.

52
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:13,799
So these are the 3.5 pillars.

53
00:01:13,959 --> 00:01:16,700
List growth, flows, send

54
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:17,620
campaigns,

55
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,750
and then the 0.5 is

56
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:19,739
deliverability.

57
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,489
Very important, but it's quite

58
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:23,560
easy.

59
00:01:23,579 --> 00:01:24,959
That's why it's a 0.5, so I'm

60
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:27,000
gonna show you how it's easy.

61
00:01:27,019 --> 00:01:28,400
But list growth, flows, and

62
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:29,680
campaigns, that's all you should

63
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,260
be focusing on.

64
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,010
How do we get more people on the

65
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:31,260
list?

66
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,640
What are the main ways we do it?

67
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:34,200
What are the base flows?

68
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:35,310
Flows are the automations, so

69
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:36,959
automated emails that are gonna

70
00:01:37,189 --> 00:01:38,200
fire for you,

71
00:01:38,219 --> 00:01:39,599
based on a customer's action.

72
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:41,140
And then three, campaigns.

73
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:42,329
So campaigns are the emails that

74
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:43,500
are sent to the whole list.

75
00:01:43,579 --> 00:01:44,640
How often are you sending?

76
00:01:44,659 --> 00:01:45,819
What emails do you send and

77
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:47,260
keeping the list engaged?

78
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,620
So these are the 3.5 pillars that

79
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:51,140
we are going to be touching on

80
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,519
briefly in this video,

81
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:54,099
and then we're going to be going

82
00:01:54,099 --> 00:01:55,500
in more depth throughout this

83
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:56,200
whole course.

84
00:01:56,219 --> 00:01:58,370
So 2024 Email Marketing Funnel, I

85
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:00,299
talked about this in the

86
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:01,739
Profitable Ecom Funnel video,

87
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,359
but essentially what we have here,

88
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:04,920
we can see the different pillars.

89
00:02:04,939 --> 00:02:07,019
So these are all list growth here,

90
00:02:07,019 --> 00:02:08,210
how you get people on list growth.

91
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,319
So of course we have like

92
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:10,780
attention capture, website

93
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:12,539
traffic, organic traffic, paid

94
00:02:12,539 --> 00:02:13,110
traffic,

95
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:14,560
bring you to site traffic,

96
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:16,229
somebody could leave, or they can

97
00:02:16,229 --> 00:02:17,560
purchase and go here,

98
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,229
or you can convert your site

99
00:02:19,229 --> 00:02:21,210
traffic into email subscribers

100
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:22,430
here with these different ways.

101
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:23,759
So we're talking about all of

102
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:24,169
these.

103
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,930
This is gonna be the list growth

104
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:26,580
pillar.

105
00:02:26,659 --> 00:02:28,500
This right here is going to be

106
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:30,419
your flows pillar, so your

107
00:02:30,419 --> 00:02:31,460
automated emails.

108
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:32,639
And then this right here is going

109
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:33,819
to be your campaigns pillar.

110
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,840
So that is what we will briefly

111
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:36,740
touch on.

112
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:38,199
So let's talk about list growth.

113
00:02:38,219 --> 00:02:40,439
That's this part of the funnel.

114
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,849
There are four main methods of

115
00:02:41,889 --> 00:02:43,110
list growth that we need to

116
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:44,979
understand, kind of ordered by

117
00:02:44,979 --> 00:02:46,020
importance here.

118
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,759
One, pop-up forms, so important.

119
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:51,289
We will talk a lot about pop-up

120
00:02:51,289 --> 00:02:54,080
forms, the most overlooked, not

121
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,020
paid enough attention to part of

122
00:02:57,069 --> 00:02:57,639
the e-com funnel.

123
00:02:57,659 --> 00:02:59,259
Every single customer who goes to

124
00:02:59,259 --> 00:03:00,930
your website is pretty much seeing

125
00:03:00,939 --> 00:03:02,509
your pop-up form and it is the top

126
00:03:02,509 --> 00:03:03,120
of funnel.

127
00:03:03,139 --> 00:03:04,120
It's how you're getting people.

128
00:03:04,139 --> 00:03:05,210
You double the conversions of your

129
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:05,740
pop-up form.

130
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:07,840
You double the amount of revenue

131
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,240
that you get from email over time.

132
00:03:10,259 --> 00:03:12,569
So that's pop-up forms.

133
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:13,729
Then we have post-purchase

134
00:03:13,729 --> 00:03:14,289
opt-ins.

135
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,770
So after somebody purchases, you

136
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:17,060
get their email and they're in the

137
00:03:17,289 --> 00:03:17,860
email list.

138
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:19,860
Sign-up pages, so just parts of

139
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:22,180
your website where it's, hey, sign

140
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:24,259
up to our email list, which you

141
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:25,400
can link like on your social

142
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:25,860
media.

143
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:27,030
You can have links to these

144
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:27,719
sign-up pages.

145
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:28,860
Then sign-up embeds.

146
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:31,169
So embedded parts of your website,

147
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:33,490
embedded parts of wherever, where

148
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:35,590
it's, put your email in and we'll

149
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,199
get you into the email list.

150
00:03:37,219 --> 00:03:39,009
So first, let's talk about pop-up

151
00:03:39,009 --> 00:03:41,020
forms, the best, easiest, scaling

152
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,729
way to grow your list and getting

153
00:03:42,729 --> 00:03:44,460
a profitable e-com funnel.

154
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,759
It doesn't matter what you think

155
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:46,719
about pop-up forms.

156
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:47,729
It's like, oh, I don't like them.

157
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:48,360
It doesn't matter.

158
00:03:48,379 --> 00:03:50,479
Your opinion does not matter.

159
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,780
Marketing doesn't care.

160
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,780
Money doesn't care.

161
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,189
What your opinion is doesn't

162
00:03:54,229 --> 00:03:54,639
matter.

163
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:56,400
You can, yes, they can be a little

164
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,030
bit intrusive at times, but a good

165
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:58,860
pop-up form isn't.

166
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,360
People like deals.

167
00:04:00,379 --> 00:04:01,460
People like discounts.

168
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:02,580
People like good offers.

169
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:04,419
People like, if you're a brand

170
00:04:04,419 --> 00:04:06,610
they like, people will want these

171
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:08,770
pop-ups to have the opportunity to

172
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:09,840
get discounts and everything like

173
00:04:09,889 --> 00:04:10,120
that.

174
00:04:10,219 --> 00:04:14,469
So I could rant on this forever.

175
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,740
You need pop-up forms.

176
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:17,319
You can make them well.

177
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:18,509
You can make them good so they're

178
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:19,680
not intrusive, but like here are

179
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:20,540
the examples, right?

180
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,899
When you open a website, a pop-up

181
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:22,399
comes up.

182
00:04:22,459 --> 00:04:23,740
So those are the pop-up forms.

183
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,819
This is kind of the post-purchase

184
00:04:25,819 --> 00:04:27,040
part where it's essentially

185
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,560
checkout page, email sign-ups,

186
00:04:28,579 --> 00:04:30,160
which is just like, for example,

187
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,639
when you're on the checkout page

188
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:32,879
here, you have the contact

189
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,649
information and then kind of like

190
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:36,250
this check box where it's keep me

191
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,439
updated on up-to-date

192
00:04:38,459 --> 00:04:40,139
on news and offers.

193
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,139
That's that.

194
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,139
That's what we mean.

195
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:42,920
That's a super easy way to get

196
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,939
people who already know, like, and

197
00:04:43,939 --> 00:04:44,500
trust you onto your

198
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,579
email list.

199
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,579
They bought from you.

200
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,329
Now let's get them on the email

201
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:47,579
list.

202
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,579
So there's that.

203
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,069
And then we also have sign-up

204
00:04:50,069 --> 00:04:50,639
pages.

205
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:52,040
So for example, this is like

206
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:52,879
Gymsharks.

207
00:04:52,899 --> 00:04:54,920
These are like optimizations that

208
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,639
I would do.

209
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:56,620
We'll talk about all these

210
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:57,819
individually in later modules, so

211
00:04:57,819 --> 00:04:58,490
I'm just quickly going

212
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:00,019
through them.

213
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,050
But this is like what a sign-up

214
00:05:01,069 --> 00:05:01,540
page is.

215
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,889
And so this is like what they link

216
00:05:02,889 --> 00:05:04,279
on their social media, sign up to

217
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:05,120
our newsletter.

218
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:07,480
The only thing is people really

219
00:05:07,579 --> 00:05:09,439
only give a crap about the

220
00:05:09,579 --> 00:05:10,670
discount.

221
00:05:10,699 --> 00:05:11,850
They know when they sign up for a

222
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:13,040
newsletter, they're getting

223
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:14,800
exclusive content, events, product

224
00:05:14,819 --> 00:05:16,379
drops, all that.

225
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:17,379
People know that.

226
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:18,379
That's implied on a newsletter.

227
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:19,709
All they really care about is the

228
00:05:19,709 --> 00:05:20,240
discount.

229
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:23,019
And all this information is extra,

230
00:05:23,269 --> 00:05:24,160
not needed.

231
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:25,579
And it's just going to increase

232
00:05:25,629 --> 00:05:26,279
your churn.

233
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,819
The amount of ROI you get back

234
00:05:27,819 --> 00:05:29,560
from somebody's date of birth to

235
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,149
send them one email a year,

236
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:33,240
the ROI isn't there for the 3%

237
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,319
less people who are going to opt

238
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:37,139
in because this scares them

239
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,500
and it's too much work to fill

240
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,439
this in.

241
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,730
And then these are like sign-up

242
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:42,180
embeds.

243
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:43,879
So if you have, it's always a good

244
00:05:43,889 --> 00:05:45,470
idea to have an email sign-up in

245
00:05:45,699 --> 00:05:46,379
your footer.

246
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:47,980
Just remind people of the offer.

247
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,980
Get this discount.

248
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,689
And then also like halfway down

249
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,439
your page, you can have embeds

250
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:54,279
like this where it's, "Hey,

251
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:56,660
get 15% off your first order."

252
00:05:56,819 --> 00:05:58,439
So those are the different methods

253
00:05:58,439 --> 00:05:59,160
of list growth.

254
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,199
That is this part of the funnel.

255
00:06:01,339 --> 00:06:03,019
Now we're talking about the email

256
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,779
campaigns, which are this part of

257
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:05,610
the funnel.

258
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:06,689
So why do we want to send

259
00:06:06,689 --> 00:06:07,420
campaigns?

260
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:09,029
So campaigns are the one-time

261
00:06:09,029 --> 00:06:10,980
emails that you send to the list.

262
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,990
campaigns are essentially just

263
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,670
consistent, cheap traffic from

264
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:14,889
customers who already know,

265
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,899
like, and trust you.

266
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,089
Email is cheap, cheap, cheap, 40

267
00:06:18,089 --> 00:06:19,810
times cheaper than paid ads and so

268
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,019
it's cheap traffic.

269
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,629
And then it's also people who

270
00:06:22,629 --> 00:06:24,319
opted into your email list or have

271
00:06:24,529 --> 00:06:26,089
bought from you before.

272
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,290
These people already know, like,

273
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:28,420
and trust you, unlike paid ads,

274
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:29,360
which are more expensive

275
00:06:29,379 --> 00:06:31,069
into people you don't know, and so

276
00:06:31,129 --> 00:06:32,600
it's very harder to get them to

277
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,240
purchase.

278
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:34,560
So that's why we need to be

279
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,660
sending campaigns.

280
00:06:35,779 --> 00:06:37,470
It's just, in principle, it's so

281
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:39,360
much better to be sending to them.

282
00:06:39,379 --> 00:06:40,540
So you can get a consistent

283
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:41,720
cadence of like three to four

284
00:06:41,899 --> 00:06:43,230
email campaigns per week.

285
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,610
It may sound like a lot to some

286
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:46,029
people would talk about that later

287
00:06:46,269 --> 00:06:47,199
on, but trust me, I've

288
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,199
tested everything.

289
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,199
Three to four campaigns a week.

290
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:50,199
It helps with engagement.

291
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,360
It helps people get in a

292
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,519
consistent cadence of

293
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:54,430
understanding you, getting used to

294
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:54,879
seeing

295
00:06:54,899 --> 00:06:56,279
you in their inbox, and then also

296
00:06:56,329 --> 00:06:57,639
if you're sending good content,

297
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:58,759
people won't care.

298
00:06:58,779 --> 00:06:59,839
So that'll establish a

299
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,389
relationship with the customer

300
00:07:01,389 --> 00:07:02,839
where they get in the habit of

301
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:03,079
opening

302
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04,199
your emails.

303
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:05,560
So you kinda have like a couple

304
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,949
different banks of content that

305
00:07:07,189 --> 00:07:08,079
you can send with your

306
00:07:08,139 --> 00:07:09,120
campaigns.

307
00:07:09,139 --> 00:07:09,870
You have discounts and promotional

308
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:10,120
emails.

309
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:11,279
Then you have education and

310
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:11,980
nurture emails.

311
00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:14,670
So you kinda want like a five-one

312
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:17,439
ratio, at least, of educational

313
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:19,120
and nurture emails versus

314
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:20,120
discounts and promos.

315
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:23,819
So education and nurture, these

316
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:27,649
are emails like social proof, like

317
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:30,750
testimonials, media publications,

318
00:07:30,779 --> 00:07:31,759
things like that.

319
00:07:31,779 --> 00:07:32,759
Those types of emails.

320
00:07:32,779 --> 00:07:34,360
Benefits, so choosing, picking out

321
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,860
different benefits of your product

322
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:36,980
and making emails around

323
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,980
those.

324
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,240
News, whether that's like product

325
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,120
drops, news in the company,

326
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,540
whatever it may be.

327
00:07:43,579 --> 00:07:45,089
And then trending/popular to go

328
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:46,699
over just like products that have

329
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:47,879
been performing well.

330
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:49,139
And then you have like discounts

331
00:07:49,209 --> 00:07:50,420
and promotional emails where it

332
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,790
could be just like you promoting

333
00:07:51,819 --> 00:07:54,470
a product like heavily or it could

334
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:56,689
be like percent or dollar off

335
00:07:56,889 --> 00:07:59,329
deals, free X with X order, free

336
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,339
shipping, those types of deals.

337
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:02,769
And so usually we want to have a

338
00:08:02,769 --> 00:08:04,160
lot more educational and nurture

339
00:08:04,389 --> 00:08:05,879
emails to keep people liking our

340
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:06,269
emails

341
00:08:06,459 --> 00:08:08,680
and staying signed up.

342
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:11,949
So now with campaigns, we need to

343
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:14,250
send consistently.

344
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,639
Send consistently.

345
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:16,990
I've talked about the top of mind

346
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:19,079
effect and this is the goal.

347
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,790
And that's what we want because

348
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:22,339
then you don't have to pay to

349
00:08:22,339 --> 00:08:23,800
acquire customers really.

350
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:24,930
It's just like you send these

351
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:27,060
emails for cheap and you just have

352
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,279
the top of mind.

353
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:31,040
You're in top of mind.

354
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:33,009
So this is a very, very, very

355
00:08:33,009 --> 00:08:34,450
profitable byproduct of just

356
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:36,360
sending consistent campaigns.

357
00:08:36,379 --> 00:08:37,860
No, you're not going to annoy your

358
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:38,220
list.

359
00:08:38,298 --> 00:08:39,610
If you're sending good content

360
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:41,360
people enjoy such as tips, you're

361
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,149
educating them.

362
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,288
And people will look forward to

363
00:08:43,288 --> 00:08:43,879
your emails.

364
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:46,519
You have good copy, fun copy.

365
00:08:46,539 --> 00:08:47,879
You have clean design.

366
00:08:47,899 --> 00:08:48,759
People are going to like that.

367
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:49,720
It triggers dopamine.

368
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,490
So the below example is like a

369
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,080
brand.

370
00:08:52,139 --> 00:08:53,220
They were sending one email

371
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:53,980
campaign a week.

372
00:08:54,059 --> 00:08:55,750
We went to three to four per week

373
00:08:55,799 --> 00:08:57,320
of sending good content.

374
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:58,720
And this was the result.

375
00:08:58,779 --> 00:09:00,259
This is proof that more content is

376
00:09:00,259 --> 00:09:00,620
good.

377
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:03,980
Open rates up 14%, 60% average

378
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:05,720
open rate for the whole month.

379
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:07,580
Click rate up 1.77%.

380
00:09:07,659 --> 00:09:10,929
It was down at 1.02% when we came

381
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:11,159
in.

382
00:09:11,179 --> 00:09:13,720
2.79% average click rate.

383
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,860
Placed order rate up 0.07% and

384
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:17,240
revenue per recipient up.

385
00:09:17,259 --> 00:09:18,639
You could see quite a big

386
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:20,840
difference from just sending more.

387
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,330
And they were wary about sending

388
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:22,919
more as well.

389
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:24,600
It's just how it goes.

390
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:26,840
So highly recommend.

391
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,909
Not even recommend.

392
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:29,879
Like you need to do that.

393
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,279
Okay, so we went through this part

394
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:33,320
and we went through this part.

395
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:35,179
Now let's talk about the automated

396
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:35,879
flow emails.

397
00:09:35,899 --> 00:09:37,169
Which usually is the part that

398
00:09:37,169 --> 00:09:38,039
trips people up.

399
00:09:38,059 --> 00:09:39,220
So what are flows?

400
00:09:39,259 --> 00:09:40,419
Flows are the automated emails

401
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:41,860
that get sent to a customer after

402
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:44,279
they complete a specified action.

403
00:09:44,299 --> 00:09:45,950
Things like joining the email

404
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:46,440
list.

405
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:47,559
That could trigger a flow.

406
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,259
Abandoning an item they left in

407
00:09:49,259 --> 00:09:50,120
their cart.

408
00:09:50,139 --> 00:09:51,830
That'll trigger a flow.

409
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:53,399
Or like making a purchase.

410
00:09:53,419 --> 00:09:54,759
That'll trigger a flow.

411
00:09:54,779 --> 00:09:56,389
And essentially each customer, if

412
00:09:56,389 --> 00:09:58,879
a specific customer is doing an

413
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:02,019
action, they individually will get

414
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:02,679
a set of emails.

415
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,389
Rather than like a campaign, I'm

416
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:05,980
sending it out to everybody.

417
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:08,799
But a flow is turned active and if

418
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:11,690
somebody completes that action,

419
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,379
then they go through and they

420
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:15,370
receive one email, wait a couple

421
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:17,100
days, another email, another

422
00:10:17,169 --> 00:10:17,639
email.

423
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:19,309
So flows allow us to automate the

424
00:10:19,309 --> 00:10:20,929
customer journey and send high

425
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,559
converting reminders, such as

426
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:23,860
abandoned carts, which are very

427
00:10:23,899 --> 00:10:24,429
profitable.

428
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:26,190
Send cross-sells.

429
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,590
So somebody bought this, you'd

430
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:28,059
like this.

431
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:29,799
And then like relevant information

432
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:31,399
for the customer that's convenient

433
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:33,070
for them in the customer journey.

434
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,080
So they should make up around 50%

435
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:36,889
of your total revenue and 50%

436
00:10:36,889 --> 00:10:38,360
coming from campaigns.

437
00:10:38,379 --> 00:10:39,539
It's going to vary brand to brand

438
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:40,720
in terms of what's healthy.

439
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:43,879
Like for this brand, 43, 57.

440
00:10:43,899 --> 00:10:45,679
You kind of, as long as you're

441
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:49,600
within 40, 60, 70, 30, 30, 70 is

442
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,840
stretching it.

443
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,830
If your flows were at 30% and

444
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:54,440
campaigns were at 70%, then it's

445
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:55,799
like, okay, your flows need some

446
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:56,350
work.

447
00:10:56,379 --> 00:10:58,070
Usually we want to be around 50,

448
00:10:58,129 --> 00:11:00,440
50, 60, 40, 40, 60.

449
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:03,740
So again, why should we use flows?

450
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,659
A lot of brands I talk to just

451
00:11:05,809 --> 00:11:07,679
don't have them, but that's

452
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:09,480
completely idiotic.

453
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,159
You get automated revenue.

454
00:11:11,179 --> 00:11:12,190
You take pressure off your

455
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:12,759
campaign.

456
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:14,120
So you're not just relying every

457
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,320
week on, oh, we didn't send

458
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,919
enough, we didn't send a campaign

459
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:17,379
this week.

460
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:19,580
And now our revenue is down 70%.

461
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,769
Take pressure off that because you

462
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:21,820
get consistent revenue.

463
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,990
You're converting high intent

464
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:24,279
traffic, like abandoned carts,

465
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,620
abandoned checkouts, people who

466
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,740
had an item in their cart, but

467
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:27,240
they forgot.

468
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,139
You get to recover lost sales with

469
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:30,399
your abandonments, kind of as I

470
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,639
said, and you get to personalize

471
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:33,159
the customer experience by giving

472
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:34,899
them content that's custom to them

473
00:11:34,899 --> 00:11:36,590
based on what you're sending.

474
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:38,309
That's why you use flows.

475
00:11:38,379 --> 00:11:42,129
And then the last 0.5, so the 0.5

476
00:11:42,129 --> 00:11:44,580
pillar, deliverability.

477
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:45,960
And so what is deliverability?

478
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,669
It's essentially your domain and

479
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,629
your eyepiece, like you're sending

480
00:11:49,629 --> 00:11:51,470
credit score is how I look at it.

481
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,000
If you have a good credit score,

482
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,529
you'll land in the primary tab,

483
00:11:54,529 --> 00:11:56,110
which is this part, which is what

484
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:57,279
everybody checks.

485
00:11:57,299 --> 00:11:58,840
If you have a bad credit score,

486
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,460
you're going to land in spam.

487
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,820
And if you're somewhat in the

488
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:03,309
middle, you're going to land in

489
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:05,009
the promotions tab here, which is

490
00:12:05,009 --> 00:12:06,429
also very hard to get people to

491
00:12:06,429 --> 00:12:07,370
check as well.

492
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:09,350
But really, we want to be in the

493
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:10,429
primary tab and good

494
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:12,330
deliverability, but you're in the

495
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:13,289
primary tab.

496
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,269
And so what affects

497
00:12:14,269 --> 00:12:15,340
deliverability?

498
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,000
What affects your credit score?

499
00:12:17,019 --> 00:12:18,860
A few things.

500
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,500
One is technical setup.

501
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:22,669
So having things like DMARC, DKIM,

502
00:12:22,669 --> 00:12:24,759
essentially just like validations

503
00:12:24,769 --> 00:12:26,590
on your domain, which we'll go

504
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:27,129
over.

505
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:29,309
If that sounds overwhelming, it's

506
00:12:29,309 --> 00:12:29,779
not.

507
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:31,159
Just like having these validators

508
00:12:31,159 --> 00:12:32,409
on your domain, it's just like a

509
00:12:32,409 --> 00:12:33,049
checklist.

510
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:33,879
Do you have this?

511
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:34,370
Do you have this?

512
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:34,889
Do you have this?

513
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:35,740
And so super easy.

514
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:36,740
That's one thing that affects it.

515
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:37,909
If you're missing one, you'll just

516
00:12:37,909 --> 00:12:38,460
land in spam.

517
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,820
And then open rates.

518
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,769
How often are people opening your

519
00:12:41,769 --> 00:12:42,080
email?

520
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,110
If you're getting 10% opens on

521
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:45,960
your emails, so one out of 10

522
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,000
people are actually opening your

523
00:12:48,019 --> 00:12:48,440
emails,

524
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:50,299
what do you think that tells

525
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:52,019
Google and Yahoo?

526
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:53,200
Do you think they want to send

527
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,570
their customers who they want to

528
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:55,700
have a good experience?

529
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,409
Do you think they're going to send

530
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:59,240
emails from a brand that's getting

531
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:01,159
one out of 10 people to open?

532
00:13:01,179 --> 00:13:01,580
No.

533
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,289
Same thing as click rates.

534
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,480
If nobody's clicking or engaging

535
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:05,659
with the email, and that proves

536
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,580
that they don't really,

537
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,169
like the emails, and so they're

538
00:13:08,169 --> 00:13:09,870
more likely to send you to spam.

539
00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:11,559
Spam complaint rates.

540
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:12,960
If you have more spam complaint

541
00:13:13,009 --> 00:13:14,710
rates, obviously that tells Google

542
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,120
and Yahoo, let's send these

543
00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:16,610
people out.

544
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:18,980
And then sending volume over time.

545
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,840
So if all of a sudden, say there's

546
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,370
a new domain, if right out of the

547
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:27,559
gate, I start a brand, I start a

548
00:13:27,559 --> 00:13:29,269
domain, and I send a million

549
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:29,799
emails in one day, they're all

550
00:13:29,799 --> 00:13:30,200
going to land in spam.

551
00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:31,919
So it's sending volume over time.

552
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:33,110
If you ever go through a hiatus,

553
00:13:33,169 --> 00:13:34,279
you stop sending, and then you

554
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:35,740
send a ton of emails, you're going

555
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:36,809
to have some deliverability

556
00:13:37,009 --> 00:13:37,600
problems.

557
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:38,580
You need to be consistent.

558
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:39,899
That's also why we need consistent

559
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:40,519
campaigns.

560
00:13:40,539 --> 00:13:44,100
So why is it only a 0.5 pillar?

561
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,899
Because it's so easy.

562
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:47,059
As long as you only send to

563
00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:48,519
engaged profiles and send good

564
00:13:48,519 --> 00:13:49,980
content, you'll be fine.

565
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,320
I'll go over this later.

566
00:13:51,419 --> 00:13:52,679
But if you send good content that

567
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:54,049
people want, and then you're only

568
00:13:54,049 --> 00:13:55,269
sending to people who want your

569
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:56,700
emails, who open your emails, then

570
00:13:56,759 --> 00:13:58,330
you don't have to worry about it.

571
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,409
Because you'll get high

572
00:13:59,409 --> 00:14:00,700
engagement, and you won't get

573
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:02,419
spam, you won't get unsubscribes,

574
00:14:02,419 --> 00:14:03,639
you just, well, you will get

575
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,519
unsubscribes, that's natural.

576
00:14:05,559 --> 00:14:08,139
But you won't get spamming, so

577
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:10,759
it's super easy, trust me.

578
00:14:10,779 --> 00:14:11,559
We'll talk about that in a bit.

579
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:13,389
Quick summary, only 3.5 things you

580
00:14:13,389 --> 00:14:14,700
need to pay attention to in your

581
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:15,440
email account.

582
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,419
List growth, consistent campaigns,

583
00:14:17,419 --> 00:14:18,639
have your base flows, and

584
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:19,659
deliverability.

585
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,080
All the other stuff is noise,

586
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:22,080
aren't worth the time unless

587
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:23,120
you're at one mil a month.

588
00:14:23,139 --> 00:14:25,779
Just focus on these.
