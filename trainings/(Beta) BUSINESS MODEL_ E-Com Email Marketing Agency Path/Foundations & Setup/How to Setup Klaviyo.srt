1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,160
So you can't send emails without

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,950
an ESP, which is an email service

3
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:05,580
provider, unless you just want

4
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,080
to send manually through your

5
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,820
Gmail to your list, but that's not

6
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:10,660
very efficient and that's just not

7
00:00:10,849 --> 00:00:13,210
reasonable for any brand that's

8
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:15,109
over five customers.

9
00:00:15,109 --> 00:00:17,760
So these ESP softwares allow you

10
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:17,879
to

11
00:00:18,089 --> 00:00:19,399
design your emails, send out your

12
00:00:19,469 --> 00:00:21,170
emails, and store your list data.

13
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:22,500
Do not overcomplicate this.

14
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:23,460
Use Klaviyo.

15
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:24,690
I've used all of them.

16
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:26,350
MailChimp, ActiveCampaign,

17
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:28,480
HubSpot, Omicent, Drip, all of

18
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:28,699
that.

19
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,390
Klaviyo is the only true option,

20
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:31,480
especially as you scale.

21
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:32,240
Just do it now.

22
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,079
Just be on Klaviyo.

23
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,039
If you're on another platform,

24
00:00:35,049 --> 00:00:36,009
just switch to Klaviyo now so you

25
00:00:36,009 --> 00:00:36,979
don't have to worry about it.

26
00:00:37,179 --> 00:00:39,380
Klaviyo is the best and if you

27
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:42,289
want to save like $50 a month,

28
00:00:42,289 --> 00:00:44,119
then I don't know.

29
00:00:44,119 --> 00:00:44,679
Maybe you can do

30
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:46,079
that with other platforms, but

31
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,359
that's, you really just, it

32
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:48,579
doesn't really matter.

33
00:00:48,579 --> 00:00:50,060
So Klaviyo integrates

34
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:51,679
with Shopify very, very smoothly.

35
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:52,840
All you have to do is create a

36
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:53,700
Klaviyo account.

37
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:54,479
So if you have a

38
00:00:54,689 --> 00:00:55,880
store, just get set up just right

39
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:56,219
here.

40
00:00:56,229 --> 00:00:57,590
Literally, this is all you fill

41
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:58,200
out and then

42
00:00:58,350 --> 00:00:59,679
you'll, they'll walk you through

43
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:01,000
the whole entire process.

44
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,740
And you'll be able to follow

45
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:04,409
their easy to follow instructions,

46
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,799
integrate with Shopify or any

47
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:06,810
other e-com provider that

48
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:08,760
you are using with their platform.

49
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,189
They also have an excellent

50
00:01:10,189 --> 00:01:11,159
support team and they'll

51
00:01:11,329 --> 00:01:12,620
be able to help you with any

52
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:14,569
integration questions that you may

53
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,079
have.

54
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:17,760
So once you integrate,

55
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:19,150
so just follow their instructions.

56
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:20,230
Literally does not take long,

57
00:01:20,299 --> 00:01:21,379
should not take you more than

58
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:21,829
a day.

59
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:24,159
You just kind of have to install

60
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:25,920
the embed on Klaviyo.

61
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,579
And so once you are inside

62
00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:28,920
of Klaviyo, this is how your

63
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,680
integration pages should look.

64
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,680
So if you go here, this is inside

65
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:33,129
Klaviyo.

66
00:01:33,129 --> 00:01:34,560
When you're inside your dashboard,

67
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,750
you will see this, but if you go

68
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:36,620
down to settings,

69
00:01:36,829 --> 00:01:38,140
which is down here, and then go to

70
00:01:38,209 --> 00:01:39,519
integrations, this is how it

71
00:01:39,579 --> 00:01:40,390
should look.

72
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,739
You should see Shopify

73
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:43,920
here and you should see status is

74
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,730
enabled.

75
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:47,180
Um, that should be how it looks.

76
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:49,519
And then if you click

77
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:51,569
onto Shopify, if you click onto

78
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:53,739
Shopify, this is what you want to

79
00:01:53,829 --> 00:01:54,129
see.

80
00:01:54,469 --> 00:01:55,739
This is exactly how you want

81
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:56,189
to see.

82
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:57,719
You want to see that onsite

83
00:01:57,719 --> 00:01:59,310
tracking is enabled here.

84
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:01,280
We want to check this box, add

85
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:01,560
viewed

86
00:02:01,769 --> 00:02:02,549
product to my site.

87
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:04,209
This is going to be helpful later.

88
00:02:04,209 --> 00:02:05,469
This is for helping us set up

89
00:02:05,469 --> 00:02:06,170
flows and track

90
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:06,890
customer data.

91
00:02:06,939 --> 00:02:08,250
Like if somebody views a product

92
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:09,400
and leave, somebody goes to

93
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,520
checkout and then leaves.

94
00:02:10,689 --> 00:02:11,969
And then you're going to want to

95
00:02:11,969 --> 00:02:13,069
sync your Shopify email

96
00:02:13,069 --> 00:02:14,439
subscribers to Klaviyo.

97
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:15,960
Just put them on the

98
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:17,860
basic list newsletter.

99
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:18,719
And yeah.

100
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:20,580
So we will talk about this more

101
00:02:20,909 --> 00:02:21,710
later on.

102
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:23,740
Um, and just a warning sign

103
00:02:23,949 --> 00:02:24,189
here.

104
00:02:24,189 --> 00:02:26,030
So again, this is more talking to

105
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:26,819
right here.

106
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:28,530
If you have this integration,

107
00:02:28,689 --> 00:02:29,500
you're not done

108
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:30,770
because you need to have the full

109
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:31,949
integration to make sure that

110
00:02:31,949 --> 00:02:33,360
you're tracking all the different

111
00:02:33,569 --> 00:02:34,030
triggers.

112
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,819
And so make sure you have enabled

113
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,599
onsite tracking, which is this

114
00:02:37,669 --> 00:02:38,560
button here.

115
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,280
The instructions

116
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:40,270
are right in here.

117
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,909
I've also attached them here.

118
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:43,599
Um, you want to be able to monitor

119
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:44,560
customers as they

120
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:46,039
view products, start, check out

121
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:47,020
all the stuff and create

122
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:47,770
automations.

123
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:48,979
Here's an article on how to

124
00:02:48,979 --> 00:02:49,340
enable,

125
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:50,750
um, onsite tracking.

126
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,090
It's just right here.

127
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:53,960
Um, it walks you through the whole

128
00:02:54,289 --> 00:02:55,340
entire process.

129
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,560
It's onsite

130
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:58,430
tracking is super easy.

131
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:00,729
You just check mark something in,

132
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:01,879
um, Klaviyo.

133
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:03,430
You just go, once

134
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:04,939
you're in Klaviyo, if you don't

135
00:03:04,939 --> 00:03:06,650
have onsite tracking, it'll bring

136
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:07,900
you this link and you can

137
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:08,960
literally just click this link

138
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,240
here.

139
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,370
It's going to take you directly to

140
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:12,129
Shopify in the, in the Klaviyo

141
00:03:12,349 --> 00:03:12,930
app embed.

142
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:14,590
All you have to do is switch a

143
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:16,689
toggle, save the theme, and then

144
00:03:16,689 --> 00:03:18,500
it will be, it'll be

145
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:20,259
complete, super easy.

146
00:03:20,259 --> 00:03:22,500
Um, and then also, so that's not

147
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,120
all of it.

148
00:03:23,449 --> 00:03:25,099
So what this is going to give you

149
00:03:25,229 --> 00:03:27,030
is viewed product, active onsite

150
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:28,620
and, uh, check out started

151
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:29,340
triggers.

152
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:30,840
But we also want to have an

153
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:32,169
added to cart trigger.

154
00:03:32,169 --> 00:03:33,740
Added to cart is different than

155
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,909
check out started.

156
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:36,400
Um, and Shopify doesn't

157
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:37,500
automatically do that.

158
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,860
So you have to do that manually.

159
00:03:38,939 --> 00:03:39,979
There's a little bit more

160
00:03:39,979 --> 00:03:41,020
advanced, but

161
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,930
you, you need to have added cart

162
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:44,780
because if you're only tracking

163
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:47,120
check out started, you're missing

164
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:47,319
out

165
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:48,979
on anybody who just adds to their

166
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:49,370
cart.

167
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:51,379
So, um, these are different, have

168
00:03:51,629 --> 00:03:52,669
different triggers.

169
00:03:52,669 --> 00:03:52,860
Again,

170
00:03:53,069 --> 00:03:54,629
abandoned checkout and abandoned

171
00:03:54,629 --> 00:03:55,050
cart.

172
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:56,319
Follow this blog here.

173
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,020
I'll go over here just so you can

174
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:58,280
see how

175
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,500
it looks like, how to create an

176
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,879
added to cart event for Shopify.

177
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,219
You have to physically go into

178
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:04,419
your theme and add a snippet.

179
00:04:04,419 --> 00:04:06,830
You add this snippet to your site.

180
00:04:07,129 --> 00:04:09,080
Um, and in most cases, you're

181
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:09,240
going

182
00:04:09,389 --> 00:04:10,710
to want to follow these

183
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:11,879
instructions.

184
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:13,860
If your store has custom liquid

185
00:04:14,189 --> 00:04:16,110
blocks, if your store doesn't have

186
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:17,500
custom liquid blocks, you're going

187
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,670
to have to actually manually go

188
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:19,290
into the code.

189
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:20,579
This is super easy to do

190
00:04:20,689 --> 00:04:22,089
if you have, um, custom liquid

191
00:04:22,089 --> 00:04:22,610
blocks.

192
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:24,069
If not, you're going to have to

193
00:04:24,069 --> 00:04:25,680
follow these instructions.

194
00:04:25,689 --> 00:04:26,379
And in both

195
00:04:26,589 --> 00:04:28,009
cases, you're going to have to

196
00:04:28,009 --> 00:04:29,629
copy and paste this snippet and

197
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,269
then test it by using a UTM of

198
00:04:31,329 --> 00:04:31,699
email

199
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:32,149
testing.

200
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:33,660
And then you'll be able to see if

201
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:34,779
your trigger fired.

202
00:04:34,779 --> 00:04:36,699
Now we're not quite done with

203
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:37,370
getting set up.

204
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:38,750
We need to get the deliverability

205
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:39,579
technicalities.

206
00:04:39,589 --> 00:04:41,139
There are new center requirements

207
00:04:41,329 --> 00:04:43,410
for Google and Yahoo as of 2024.

208
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:45,040
And also there's just some best

209
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,600
practices that you need for

210
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:47,660
deliverability.

211
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:49,019
So first thing is you need a

212
00:04:49,019 --> 00:04:50,569
dedicated sending domain.

213
00:04:50,569 --> 00:04:51,660
And so if you follow

214
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:53,139
these exact steps here, go to this

215
00:04:53,139 --> 00:04:54,500
article so you can see it, how to

216
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,839
set up branding, branded sending

217
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:57,290
domain.

218
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:58,790
So with email, you're sending from

219
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:00,089
a certain address and you don't

220
00:05:00,089 --> 00:05:00,819
want to have the

221
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,160
clavio email.com.

222
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:03,540
This is actually a requirement

223
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:04,620
from Google and Yahoo.

224
00:05:04,629 --> 00:05:05,699
So if you follow these

225
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:07,220
instructions, you're essentially

226
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:09,069
just like getting DNS records from

227
00:05:09,139 --> 00:05:10,449
Klavio and adding that to your

228
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:12,149
domain and creating your sending

229
00:05:12,149 --> 00:05:12,660
domain.

230
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:14,199
Um, this can be a little bit more

231
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:15,019
technical.

232
00:05:15,019 --> 00:05:16,019
So you can shoot

233
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,089
me an email if you have any

234
00:05:17,089 --> 00:05:18,480
questions, but it is a necessary

235
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,019
thing that you do need to have.

236
00:05:20,329 --> 00:05:22,089
Um, and then you need to set up

237
00:05:22,089 --> 00:05:23,550
DMARC on your domain.

238
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:25,699
Um, DMARC is essentially just

239
00:05:25,699 --> 00:05:25,959
going to

240
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,079
help you with deliverability and

241
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:28,009
it is a requirement where else

242
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,720
you're pretty much just going to

243
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:29,920
be

244
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:31,000
guaranteed to go to spam.

245
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,170
So here's another article.

246
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:33,290
We're getting that set up,

247
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,240
understanding email

248
00:05:34,449 --> 00:05:35,029
authentication.

249
00:05:35,029 --> 00:05:36,240
And then if you go down to DMARC,

250
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,319
you can understand this.

251
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:38,620
And then it's also going to

252
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:40,220
tell you how to install it.

253
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:42,000
I've also put the instructions

254
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,240
here, set up DMARC.

255
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:43,810
Um, this is

256
00:05:44,009 --> 00:05:44,910
all you need to do.

257
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:46,389
Log into your domains, DNS

258
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:47,110
settings.

259
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:50,139
Um, and once logged in, create a

260
00:05:50,139 --> 00:05:50,240
new

261
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:51,660
record with this information.

262
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,009
This is literally all you need to

263
00:05:53,009 --> 00:05:53,250
do.

264
00:05:53,259 --> 00:05:54,060
It's super easy.

265
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:54,600
It seems all

266
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:56,089
technical and all this stuff, but

267
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:57,329
literally just go to your DNS

268
00:05:57,329 --> 00:05:59,209
settings and create these, um,

269
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:01,000
create these, um, records.

270
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,589
And then that's all you need to

271
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:02,959
do.

272
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:04,850
Then you can just look up DMARC

273
00:06:05,069 --> 00:06:07,199
authenticator on Google and then

274
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,779
plug in your domain.

275
00:06:08,779 --> 00:06:11,089
And, um, that site will tell you

276
00:06:11,089 --> 00:06:11,500
if you

277
00:06:11,709 --> 00:06:13,170
have DMARC successfully installed.

278
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,550
And then, so those are the two

279
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:15,129
main ones.

280
00:06:15,129 --> 00:06:16,040
And then you need to

281
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,339
ensure that your reply to

282
00:06:17,339 --> 00:06:19,029
addresses on all your emails have

283
00:06:19,069 --> 00:06:20,279
the same root domain.

284
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:21,259
So for example,

285
00:06:21,649 --> 00:06:23,120
you can not have a sending domain

286
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,519
send@getnike.com.

287
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:26,579
And then your reply to address is

288
00:06:26,579 --> 00:06:28,180
support@nike.com

289
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:29,699
because get Nike right here is

290
00:06:29,769 --> 00:06:31,399
different from nike.com.

291
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:33,129
That's going to send you to spam

292
00:06:33,139 --> 00:06:33,779
as well.

293
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,750
So you can just set that in

294
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:36,170
Klaviyo settings, just have your

295
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:37,540
automatic reply to be the same.

296
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:38,339
Um,

297
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,509
I know some brands have different

298
00:06:40,509 --> 00:06:42,750
domains, but you have to make sure

299
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,259
that that is set up.
