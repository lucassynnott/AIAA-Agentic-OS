1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:02,640
Okay, so technical deliverability

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:03,229
setup.

3
00:00:03,399 --> 00:00:05,639
This is just like the first step

4
00:00:05,639 --> 00:00:06,360
that you need to do,

5
00:00:06,419 --> 00:00:07,820
which you might already have all

6
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:09,589
of this set up, but you might not.

7
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:11,140
If you're starting like a new

8
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:12,550
account, new domain, then you're

9
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:13,730
going to need to make sure that

10
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:14,369
all this is set.

11
00:00:14,539 --> 00:00:15,689
But super duper

12
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:16,160
easy.

13
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:18,179
So seems very complex, but again,

14
00:00:18,179 --> 00:00:19,859
most domains already have the

15
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:21,399
correct records in place,

16
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,460
maybe one missing.

17
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,940
So you need to make sure that you

18
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:24,629
have these.

19
00:00:24,629 --> 00:00:26,149
You need to make sure that you

20
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:27,219
have SPF, you need to make sure

21
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:28,260
you have DMARC, and you need to

22
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:29,320
make sure that you have DKIM.

23
00:00:29,379 --> 00:00:31,780
You can use this website here,

24
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:34,509
GlockApps, to just see if you have

25
00:00:34,509 --> 00:00:35,750
everything.

26
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:37,520
Super duper easy.

27
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:37,780
You

28
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,000
can just create like a free

29
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:39,530
account.

30
00:00:39,579 --> 00:00:40,240
Super easy.

31
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,679
Or you can do like a spam checker

32
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:42,479
right here.

33
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:42,759
But

34
00:00:42,829 --> 00:00:45,100
literally, if like right here, you

35
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:47,030
could do DMARC Analyzer, Inbox

36
00:00:47,189 --> 00:00:49,500
Insight, or you can literally just

37
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,840
look up on the internet how to

38
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,229
check if I have SPF and they're

39
00:00:52,329 --> 00:00:53,770
like free, free everything.

40
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:54,840
More than

41
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:56,140
likely you won't have DMARC.

42
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:57,390
And so that's like the main one

43
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,070
that I call out.

44
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,109
So just see if you have

45
00:00:59,179 --> 00:00:59,479
them.

46
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:00,859
If you enter your domain and it's

47
00:01:00,859 --> 00:01:02,189
like, hey, you have it, then

48
00:01:02,189 --> 00:01:03,000
you're all good.

49
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,659
If it says,

50
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:05,370
hey, you don't have it, then make

51
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:06,319
sure you have it.

52
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:07,930
If you're missing a record, this

53
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:08,750
link right here

54
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:09,620
has everything.

55
00:01:09,629 --> 00:01:10,930
I didn't want to explain it for

56
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:11,250
you.

57
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:13,019
SPF, DKIM, and DMARC for Klaviyo.

58
00:01:13,019 --> 00:01:13,989
Holy cookies.

59
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:16,189
It's just all set up right here.

60
00:01:16,189 --> 00:01:17,680
So super duper easy.

61
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,769
Just test to make sure you have

62
00:01:19,859 --> 00:01:20,159
it,

63
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:21,709
and then you're all good.

64
00:01:21,709 --> 00:01:23,489
So super duper easy right there.

65
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:25,319
And then Klaviyo dedicated sending

66
00:01:25,379 --> 00:01:26,370
domain is like the last step.

67
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,459
So you have your records and then

68
00:01:27,459 --> 00:01:28,549
you need to make sure you have

69
00:01:28,609 --> 00:01:29,760
a Klaviyo dedicated sending

70
00:01:29,769 --> 00:01:31,209
domain, which this is part of like

71
00:01:31,209 --> 00:01:32,560
the Klaviyo setup process that

72
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:32,680
they're

73
00:01:32,739 --> 00:01:34,640
going to help walk you through.

74
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,390
This is like a new thing that is

75
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:38,599
like required as of 2024,

76
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:39,299
February.

77
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:40,930
So relatively new.

78
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:43,549
But this article walks you through

79
00:01:43,549 --> 00:01:45,819
everything that you need.

80
00:01:45,819 --> 00:01:47,310
Super duper easy.

81
00:01:47,379 --> 00:01:48,489
This was like really big at the

82
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,739
beginning of 2024.

83
00:01:49,739 --> 00:01:51,299
They were making this like switch.

84
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:51,980
A lot of emails

85
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,159
came with this, like you were

86
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:53,920
sharing from it.

87
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,109
You were sending from a shared

88
00:01:55,109 --> 00:01:56,250
domain, but now you're

89
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:57,719
now that's not a thing because you

90
00:01:57,730 --> 00:01:58,930
can't really be sending.

91
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:00,519
You're just going to go to the

92
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:01,340
spam inbox.

93
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,730
So just make sure you have that.

94
00:02:02,739 --> 00:02:03,840
And then you're all set.

95
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,290
That's literally it for technical

96
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:05,609
setup.

97
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:07,150
Don't have to do anything else

98
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:07,950
besides that.

99
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:09,150
So super duper simple.

100
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:11,038
Get this, knock this out within

101
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:12,770
a couple hours if that should take

102
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:14,740
you like 20, 30 minutes.

103
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,349
Okay.

104
00:02:15,349 --> 00:02:18,280
So technical deliverability setup.

105
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,419
This is just like the first step

106
00:02:20,419 --> 00:02:21,479
that you need to do,

107
00:02:21,539 --> 00:02:22,939
which you might already have all

108
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:24,710
of this set up, but you might not.

109
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,210
If you're starting like a new

110
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,650
account, new domain, then you're

111
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:28,830
going to need to make sure that

112
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:29,469
all this is set.

113
00:02:29,629 --> 00:02:31,080
But super duper easy.

114
00:02:31,139 --> 00:02:33,050
So seems very complex, but again,

115
00:02:33,099 --> 00:02:34,800
most domains already have the

116
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,919
correct records in place, maybe

117
00:02:36,979 --> 00:02:37,610
one missing.

118
00:02:37,629 --> 00:02:39,050
So you need to make sure that you

119
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:39,650
have these.

120
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,020
You need to make sure that you

121
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:41,960
have SPF.

122
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:42,800
You need to make sure you have

123
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:43,689
DMARC and you need to make sure

124
00:02:43,689 --> 00:02:44,439
that you have DKIM.

125
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:45,599
You can use this

126
00:02:45,669 --> 00:02:48,310
website here, Glock apps, to just

127
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:50,569
see if you have everything.

128
00:02:50,569 --> 00:02:52,099
Super duper easy.

129
00:02:52,099 --> 00:02:53,340
You can just create

130
00:02:53,419 --> 00:02:54,500
like a free account.

131
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,240
Super easy.

132
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,030
Or you can do like a spam checker

133
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:57,599
right here.

134
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,639
But literally, if like right

135
00:02:59,699 --> 00:03:01,759
here, you could do DMARC analyzer,

136
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:03,219
inbox insight, or you can

137
00:03:03,219 --> 00:03:04,740
literally just look up on the

138
00:03:04,819 --> 00:03:05,840
internet how to

139
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,300
check if I have SPF and they're

140
00:03:07,349 --> 00:03:08,969
like free, free everything.

141
00:03:08,969 --> 00:03:10,650
More than likely, you won't have

142
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:11,060
DMARC.

143
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,199
And so that's like the main one

144
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:12,939
that I call out.

145
00:03:12,939 --> 00:03:15,050
So just see if you have them.

146
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:16,379
If you enter your domain

147
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:17,539
and it's like, hey, you have it,

148
00:03:17,539 --> 00:03:18,340
then you're all good.

149
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,419
If it says, hey, you don't have

150
00:03:19,419 --> 00:03:21,110
it, then make sure you

151
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:21,530
have it.

152
00:03:21,539 --> 00:03:22,860
If you're missing a record, this

153
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,240
link right here has everything.

154
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,340
I didn't want to explain it

155
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:25,990
for you.

156
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:28,270
SPF, DKIM, and DMARC for Klaviyo.

157
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:29,300
Holy cookies.

158
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,539
It's just all set up right here.

159
00:03:31,539 --> 00:03:32,159
So super

160
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:33,129
duper easy.

161
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:35,080
Just test to make sure you have it

162
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,759
and then you're all good.

163
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:38,460
So super duper easy right

164
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:38,840
there.

165
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,259
And then Klaviyo dedicated sending

166
00:03:40,259 --> 00:03:41,490

00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:42,939
So you have your records and then

you need to make sure you have a

Klaviyo dedicated sending domain,

170
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:46,370
which this is part of like the

171
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:46,719
Klaviyo

172
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,340
setup process that they're going

173
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:49,659
to help walk you through.

174
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,060
This is like a new thing.

175
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:54,610
that is like required as of 2024,

176
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:55,659
February.

177
00:03:55,719 --> 00:03:57,419
So relatively new.

178
00:03:57,419 --> 00:03:59,620
But this article walks you

179
00:03:59,689 --> 00:04:01,240
through everything that you need.

180
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,110
Super duper easy.

181
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:03,389
This was like really big at the

182
00:04:03,389 --> 00:04:03,879
beginning

183
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:04,860
of 2024.

184
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,469
They were making this like switch.

185
00:04:06,469 --> 00:04:07,860
A lot of emails came with this.

186
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:08,520
Like you were

187
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:10,110
sharing from a, you were sending

188
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:11,520
from a shared domain, but now

189
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,060
you're, now that's not a thing

190
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:14,180
because you can't really be

191
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:14,650
sending.

192
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:15,759
You're just going to go to the

193
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:16,329
spam inbox.

194
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,620
So just make sure

195
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,220
you have that.

196
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:19,170
And then you're all set.

197
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:20,339
That's literally it for technical

198
00:04:20,449 --> 00:04:20,819
setup.

199
00:04:20,819 --> 00:04:21,620
Don't have

200
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,329
to do anything else besides that.

201
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:24,509
So super duper simple.

202
00:04:24,509 --> 00:04:26,120
Get this, knock this out within

203
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:26,920
a couple hours.

204
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,410
If, if that should take you like

205
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:29,800
20, 30 minutes.
