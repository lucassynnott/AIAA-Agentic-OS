1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:02,589
Okay, so this is an instant way to

2
00:00:02,589 --> 00:00:04,759
boost your deliverability and how

3
00:00:04,759 --> 00:00:05,870
your emails are set

4
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:08,279
up so that you don't look spammy

5
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:10,480
in the eyes of inbox service

6
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,679
providers.

7
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:13,919
So super duper easy.

8
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:15,119
We do this for every single

9
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:16,429
account that we work on and it

10
00:00:16,429 --> 00:00:18,000
makes such a massive difference

11
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:19,920
and it's all in your footer.

12
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:22,519
So sending emails with images.

13
00:00:22,579 --> 00:00:25,769
So in theory, you can send emails

14
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:28,269
with just image files.

15
00:00:28,339 --> 00:00:29,910
You can do that, but it looks

16
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:30,600
spammy.

17
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:31,800
You probably have a higher inbox

18
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:32,909
placement rate if you're just

19
00:00:32,909 --> 00:00:34,280
sending massive image files

20
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:35,950
and that's purely what's in your

21
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:36,539
email.

22
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,070
That's all that Gmail is seeing is

23
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:39,570
there's a ton of images in here.

24
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:41,619
However, a big misconception in

25
00:00:41,619 --> 00:00:43,299
the space is that you can't send

26
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,039
email with many images.

27
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:47,079
You have to mix in HTML, you have

28
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:49,130
to mix and match stuff, which is

29
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:50,890
just completely false.

30
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,119
You can send primarily image-based

31
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:55,140
emails, you can have large image

32
00:00:55,299 --> 00:00:56,560
files, you can have 20

33
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:58,880
different images in an email.

34
00:00:58,920 --> 00:00:59,880
I wouldn't recommend that.

35
00:00:59,939 --> 00:01:01,960
But you can do that as long as you

36
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,560
have HTML in your email,

37
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:05,819
particularly in the footer.

38
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:07,790
So what is HTML?

39
00:01:07,879 --> 00:01:09,879
It's essentially just native text.

40
00:01:09,939 --> 00:01:11,310
So like a text box inside of

41
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:12,909
Klaviyo or whatever provider

42
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:14,879
you're using, that is HTML.

43
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:15,879
It's not an image.

44
00:01:15,939 --> 00:01:17,819
It's like coded into the email.

45
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:18,819
It is the text.

46
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:20,340
It's just a text box to write

47
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:20,859
text.

48
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,140
That is HTML.

49
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,090
So as long as we have some of that

50
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:25,810
in our email and we have a good

51
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:28,079
ratio of image to text,

52
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:31,079
then we are good to go.

53
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:32,189
The problem with HTML, so you're

54
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:33,480
probably thinking, okay, why don't

55
00:01:33,579 --> 00:01:34,140
we have an email where it's

56
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,349
like we have image and then text

57
00:01:36,349 --> 00:01:38,629
is HTML and then we do more images

58
00:01:38,629 --> 00:01:39,920
and then text.

59
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:41,120
Now the problem with that is

60
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,670
because they are super annoying to

61
00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:44,140
deal with and optimize in your

62
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,140
emails.

63
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,769
One thing is you can't put HTML

64
00:01:46,909 --> 00:01:48,689
over images, so your design is

65
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:49,840
really limited.

66
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,469
So what that means is you can't

67
00:01:51,609 --> 00:01:53,060
have text in your images.

68
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,219
If you want to have like HTML text

69
00:01:55,219 --> 00:01:57,310
like over, if you have like a cool

70
00:01:57,459 --> 00:01:58,739
image and you want

71
00:01:58,799 --> 00:01:59,930
to put over top the image of like

72
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:01,299
someone wearing your product, you

73
00:02:01,299 --> 00:02:03,459
want to say like new product,

74
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:05,090
that has to be fully in.

75
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:07,719
You can't put HTML over that image

76
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,099
as that text.

77
00:02:09,159 --> 00:02:10,960
You'd have to design in an outside

78
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,710
platform and put that text over

79
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:14,020
top of it and export that

80
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,020
whole image.

81
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,020
That's the only thing.

82
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,020
So you can't put HTML over images.

83
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,650
So if you don't use, if that, if

84
00:02:20,789 --> 00:02:22,280
the only way you use text is with

85
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,020
HTML, you're really limited

86
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,550
because then you have to separate

87
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:27,020
images and text everywhere.

88
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:30,020
So that's super annoying.

89
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,069
When you do Klaviyo discount

90
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:34,550
codes, that has to be in HTML, for

91
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:35,449
example.

92
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:36,520
So that's one thing.

93
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:38,020
Another is text size.

94
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,650
That's going to change for people

95
00:02:39,789 --> 00:02:41,020
on different devices.

96
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,560
So if you have HTML and you set

97
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,639
your text size as like 16, that's

98
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:46,020
going to look different

99
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,120
for people on mobile versus

100
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,020
desktop versus iPad.

101
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,370
For people on mobile who have

102
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:53,050
zoomed in automatically on because

103
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:54,740
they have terrible eyesight, it's

104
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:55,020
going

105
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,020
to look different for everybody.

106
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,129
And so you have no way to predict

107
00:02:57,129 --> 00:02:58,289
how your emails are going to look

108
00:02:58,289 --> 00:02:59,020
for everyone.

109
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,020
So that's another thing.

110
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,620
A big thing is HTML sections are

111
00:03:02,629 --> 00:03:05,120
also going to change colors in

112
00:03:05,129 --> 00:03:08,020
dark mode versus light mode, which

113
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:09,009
is the most annoying

114
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,610
thing because you can have like an

115
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:12,250
awesome email with like the colors

116
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:13,020
perfectly.

117
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,389
They look amazing inside of light

118
00:03:15,389 --> 00:03:16,020
mode.

119
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,020
All the colors go together.

120
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,909
Well, but at the second somebody

121
00:03:18,909 --> 00:03:20,580
use turns on dark mode, if you

122
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:23,020
have HTML for like text,

123
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:23,020
everything's

124
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,650
going to invert colors and your

125
00:03:24,789 --> 00:03:26,689
emails colors just get completely

126
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:28,020
thrown out of whack.

127
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,020
Super duper annoying.

128
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,219
So we want to avoid that at all

129
00:03:31,219 --> 00:03:32,020
costs.

130
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,069
I hate HTML and I hate

131
00:03:33,069 --> 00:03:34,610
interweaving it into my email

132
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:36,020
designs because it throws

133
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:36,020
everything

134
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,340
off and you don't know how your

135
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:39,020
email actually looks for the user.

136
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,250
The trick to put HTML in your

137
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,659
email is having a ton of text in

138
00:03:43,659 --> 00:03:45,020
your footer.

139
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,409
So rather than mixing HTML into

140
00:03:47,409 --> 00:03:49,550
your email design, which is going

141
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:50,020
to vary from person to person

142
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,990
cause an inconsistent experience.

143
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,580
We just add a shnikes ton of HTML

144
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:56,020
in our footer.

145
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,400
That's completely out of the way

146
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:58,569
of the design and it doesn't

147
00:03:58,569 --> 00:04:00,020
interfere with it at all.

148
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,330
To take it a step further, which

149
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:03,020
doesn't throw off our footer.

150
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,240
We try to make the HTML invisible

151
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,020
as invisible as possible.

152
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,599
In some appearances, that'll be

153
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:10,509
like this little blurb, which

154
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,020
might people might be like,

155
00:04:12,069 --> 00:04:13,020
"Oh, what the heck?"

156
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,400
But it doesn't make any impact on

157
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,020
conversions.

158
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,410
So we make it invisible where we

159
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:18,019
can.

160
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,439
So this is like light mode, for

161
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:19,990
example.

162
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:24,019
So all that we do, copy some copy

163
00:04:24,019 --> 00:04:25,410
from like your about us section on

164
00:04:25,529 --> 00:04:26,019
your website.

165
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:27,279
I'll just take like a random part

166
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:28,420
of the website that talks about

167
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:30,019
our mission or whatever.

168
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,019
Just copy it all.

169
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:34,439
Usually like 400 to 500 words is

170
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:35,019
enough.

171
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:37,180
And then add a text box in your

172
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:38,019
footer.

173
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:39,019
Paste that copy.

174
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:40,350
Make the text size as small as

175
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:40,990
possible.

176
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:42,939
So I believe this is size like

177
00:04:42,939 --> 00:04:44,019
four or five.

178
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:45,019
Make it as small as possible.

179
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:46,089
You can see it with like the small

180
00:04:46,089 --> 00:04:46,990
footer text right there.

181
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:48,259
So that really puts into

182
00:04:48,259 --> 00:04:50,019
perspective how small this is.

183
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:51,019
Make it as small as possible.

184
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:52,629
Then make the text color the same

185
00:04:52,629 --> 00:04:54,019
color as the background.

186
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:55,019
So this is before changing colors,

187
00:04:55,019 --> 00:04:56,420
how much text there is, and then

188
00:04:56,519 --> 00:04:57,019
after.

189
00:04:57,079 --> 00:04:58,019
That's what it looks like.

190
00:04:58,079 --> 00:04:59,019
You can see how small it is.

191
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:00,990
It barely takes up any space.

192
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:02,199
Doesn't really look like a big

193
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:02,990
anything at all.

194
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:05,069
But it makes such a big difference

195
00:05:05,069 --> 00:05:06,959
in how your emails are looked at

196
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:09,019
with like Gmail.

197
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:10,509
Because when Gmail, when they're

198
00:05:10,509 --> 00:05:12,019
just looking at your email file,

199
00:05:12,019 --> 00:05:13,670
they're saying has some images and

200
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,019
it has a ton of HTML.

201
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:16,019
Good to go.

202
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:17,500
So that's a trick that you want to

203
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,920
make sure that you're having in

204
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,019
all of your emails.

205
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:21,019
Okay.

206
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:22,930
So this is an instant way to boost

207
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:24,910
your deliverability and how your

208
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:26,680
emails are set up so that you

209
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,569
don't look spammy in the eyes of

210
00:05:28,569 --> 00:05:30,850
inbox service providers.

211
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:32,990
So super duper easy.

212
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:34,129
We do this for every single

213
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:35,379
account that we work on and it

214
00:05:35,379 --> 00:05:37,019
makes such a massive difference.

215
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:38,990
And it's all in your footer.

216
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:42,019
So sending emails with images.

217
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:44,839
So in theory, you can send emails

218
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:47,019
with just image files.

219
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:49,180
You can do that, but it looks

220
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,019
spammy.

221
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:51,399
You probably have a higher inbox

222
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:52,649
placement rate if you're just

223
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:54,189
sending massive image files and

224
00:05:54,189 --> 00:05:55,449
that's purely what's in your

225
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:56,019
email.

226
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:57,129
And that's all that Gmail is

227
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:58,420
seeing is there's a ton of images

228
00:05:58,519 --> 00:05:59,019
in here.

229
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:00,930
Um, however, a big misconception

230
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:02,449
in the space is that you can't

231
00:06:02,449 --> 00:06:04,019
send email with many images.

232
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:05,990
Like you have to mix in HTML.

233
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,600
Like you have to mix and match

234
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,439
stuff, which is just completely

235
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:10,019
false.

236
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:11,990
You can send like primarily image

237
00:06:12,029 --> 00:06:13,019
based emails.

238
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:14,990
You can have large image files.

239
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:17,129
You can have 20 different images

240
00:06:17,129 --> 00:06:18,019
in an email.

241
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,629
I wouldn't recommend that, but you

242
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:22,149
can do that as long as you have

243
00:06:22,149 --> 00:06:24,480
HTML in your email, particularly

244
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,019
in the footer.

245
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:26,990
So what is HTML?

246
00:06:27,079 --> 00:06:28,990
It's essentially just native text.

247
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:30,439
So like a text box inside of

248
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:32,050
Klaviyo or whatever provider

249
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,019
you're using.

250
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:34,019
That is HTML.

251
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:35,019
It's not an image.

252
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:36,990
It's like coded into the email.

253
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:38,019
It is the text.

254
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,990
So just a text box to write text.

255
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:41,019
That is HTML.

256
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:43,139
So as long as we have some of that

257
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:45,230
in our email and we have a good

258
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:48,129
ratio of image to text, then we

259
00:06:48,129 --> 00:06:49,019
are good to go.

260
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:50,990
The problem with HTML.

261
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:52,639
So you're probably thinking, okay,

262
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:53,939
why don't we have an email where

263
00:06:53,939 --> 00:06:55,579
it's like we have image image and

264
00:06:55,579 --> 00:06:57,240
then text is HTML and then we do

265
00:06:57,379 --> 00:06:59,019
more images and then text.

266
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:00,329
Now the problem with that is

267
00:07:00,329 --> 00:07:01,990
because they are super annoying to

268
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:03,279
deal with and optimize in your

269
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,019
emails.

270
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:06,620
One thing is you can't put HTML

271
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,019
over images.

272
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:09,019
So your design is really limited.

273
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:10,550
So what that means is you can't

274
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:12,019
have text in your images.

275
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:14,180
If you want to have like HTML text

276
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:16,180
like over if you you have like a

277
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:17,930
cool image and you want to put

278
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:19,649
over top the image of like someone

279
00:07:19,649 --> 00:07:21,009
wearing your product.

280
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:22,649
You want to say like new product

281
00:07:22,649 --> 00:07:24,019
that has to be fully in.

282
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:26,620
You can't put HTML over that image

283
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:28,019
as that text.

284
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:29,899
You'd have to design in an outside

285
00:07:29,899 --> 00:07:31,660
platform and put that text over

286
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,339
top of it and export that whole

287
00:07:33,339 --> 00:07:34,019
image.

288
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:35,990
So that's the only thing.

289
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:37,990
So you can't put HTML over images.

290
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:39,850
So if you don't use if that if the

291
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:41,490
only way you use text is with

292
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:43,019
HTML, you're really limited

293
00:07:43,019 --> 00:07:44,550
because then you have to separate

294
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:46,019
images and text everywhere.

295
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:48,019
So that's super annoying.

296
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:51,050
When you do Klaviyo discount

297
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,360
codes, that has to be in HTML, for

298
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,019
example.

299
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:55,990
So that's one thing.

300
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:57,990
Another is text size.

301
00:07:58,079 --> 00:07:59,649
That's going to change for people

302
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:01,019
on different devices.

303
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:02,920
So if you have HTML and you set

304
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,310
your text size is like 16, that's

305
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:07,389
going to look different for people

306
00:08:07,389 --> 00:08:09,660
on mobile versus desktop versus

307
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:10,019
iPad.

308
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:11,199
For people on mobile who have

309
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,620
zoomed in automatically on because

310
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:14,240
they have terrible eyesight, it's

311
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,449
going to look different for

312
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:16,019
everybody.

313
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:17,129
And so you have no way to predict

314
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:18,290
how your emails are going to look

315
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:19,019
for everyone.

316
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:20,990
So that's another thing.

317
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:22,990
A big thing is HTML sections are

318
00:08:23,029 --> 00:08:24,970
also going to change colors in

319
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:27,100
dark mode versus light mode, light

320
00:08:27,379 --> 00:08:28,920
mode, which is the most annoying

321
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,529
thing because you can have like an

322
00:08:30,529 --> 00:08:32,149
awesome email with like the colors

323
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,009
perfectly.

324
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,889
They look amazing inside of light

325
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:37,019
mode, all the colors go together.

326
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,649
Well, but at the second somebody

327
00:08:38,788 --> 00:08:40,259
use turns on dark mode, if you

328
00:08:40,259 --> 00:08:41,559
have HTML for like text,

329
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:43,038
everything's going to invert

330
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:44,830
colors and your emails colors just

331
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:46,259
get completely thrown out of

332
00:08:46,379 --> 00:08:46,850
whack.

333
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,019
Super duper annoying.

334
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,220
So we want to avoid that at all

335
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:51,019
costs.

336
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,039
I hate HTML and I hate

337
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:53,529
interweaving it into my email

338
00:08:53,529 --> 00:08:54,879
designs because it throws

339
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:56,570
everything off and you don't know

340
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:58,250
how your email actually looks for

341
00:08:58,250 --> 00:08:59,019
the user.

342
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,250
The trick to put HTML on your

343
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:03,659
email is having a ton of text in

344
00:09:03,659 --> 00:09:05,019
your footer.

345
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,370
So rather than mixing HTML into

346
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:07,870
your email design, which is going

347
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:09,210
to vary from person to person,

348
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:11,019
cause an inconsistent experience.

349
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,820
We just add a nice ton of HTML in

350
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,860
our footer that's completely out

351
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:16,600
of the way of the design and it

352
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,019
doesn't interfere with it at all.

353
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,990
To take it a step further, which

354
00:09:21,029 --> 00:09:23,110
doesn't throw off our footer, we

355
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:25,120
try to make the HTML invisible, as

356
00:09:25,379 --> 00:09:27,019
invisible as possible.

357
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,889
In some appearances, it'll be like

358
00:09:28,889 --> 00:09:30,700
this little blurb, which might,

359
00:09:30,809 --> 00:09:32,019
people might be like, oh, what the

360
00:09:32,019 --> 00:09:32,019
heck?

361
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,289
But it doesn't make any impact on

362
00:09:33,289 --> 00:09:33,990
conversions.

363
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,409
So we make it invisible where we

364
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:37,019
can.

365
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,440
So this is like light mode, for

366
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:38,990
example.

367
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,889
So all that we do, copy some copy

368
00:09:41,889 --> 00:09:43,919
from like your about us section on

369
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:45,019
your website.

370
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,649
I'll just take like a random part

371
00:09:46,789 --> 00:09:48,440
of the website that talks about

372
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,019
our mission or whatever.

373
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,019
Just copy it all.

374
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:54,230
Usually like 400 to 500 words is

375
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:55,019
enough.

376
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,460
And then add a text box in your

377
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:56,990
footer.

378
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,990
Paste that copy.

379
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,350
Make the text size as small as

380
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:00,990
possible.

381
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,269
So I believe this is size like

382
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:02,990
four or five.

383
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,990
Make it as small as possible.

384
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,090
You can see it with like the small

385
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:06,990
footer text right there.

386
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:07,820
So that really puts into

387
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:08,990
perspective how small this is.

388
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,019
Make it as small as possible.

389
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,629
Then make the text color the same

390
00:10:11,629 --> 00:10:13,019
color as the background.

391
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,779
So this is before changing colors,

392
00:10:14,789 --> 00:10:16,590
how much text there is, and then

393
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,019
after.

394
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,019
That's what it looks like.

395
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,019
You can see how small it is.

396
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,990
It barely takes up any space.

397
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,129
It doesn't really look like a big,

398
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:22,990
big anything at all.

399
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,070
But it makes such a big difference

400
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:26,960
in how your emails are looked at

401
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,019
with like Gmail.

402
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,450
Cause when Gmail, when they're

403
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:31,019
just looking at your email file,

404
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:33,159
they're saying has some images and

405
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:34,019
it has a ton of HTML.

406
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,019
Good to go.

407
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,500
So that's a trick that you want to

408
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,919
make sure that you're having in

409
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:39,019
all of your emails.
