1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,720
What is segmentation so segments

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:03,240
are very very very similar to

3
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:05,929
lists but in one key way so lists

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,089
are stagnant so this is probably

5
00:00:07,099 --> 00:00:08,199
what you're thinking about with

6
00:00:08,199 --> 00:00:09,599
email marketing are your lists

7
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:11,259
as the name suggests just a flat

8
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:13,029
list of people whereas segments

9
00:00:13,029 --> 00:00:14,679
are dynamic they can change at

10
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:16,000
any second based on the

11
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,809
requirements that you set on the

12
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:19,539
segment and as the name suggests

13
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:20,079
it is just

14
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:21,859
a segment of your full email list

15
00:00:21,899 --> 00:00:23,260
a subset of people who meet

16
00:00:23,339 --> 00:00:25,160
certain characteristics that you

17
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,559
provide so inside of Klaviyo it's

18
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:27,859
just right under here lists and

19
00:00:27,859 --> 00:00:29,019
segments are under the same

20
00:00:29,179 --> 00:00:30,530
apart you can see here are a bunch

21
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:31,969
of lists with different people

22
00:00:31,969 --> 00:00:33,380
these are not segments just

23
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:35,149
because they don't say segment and

24
00:00:35,149 --> 00:00:36,619
they're not dynamic they are

25
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:38,679
static so the possibilities are

26
00:00:38,829 --> 00:00:40,670
literally endless for segments you

27
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:42,579
can do pretty much everything that

28
00:00:42,579 --> 00:00:44,020
you could ever want so you

29
00:00:44,179 --> 00:00:45,600
have everything from basics or

30
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,359
like segment based on like general

31
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:48,960
like email open behavior what

32
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:50,049
somebody's clicking how often

33
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:51,189
these people are doing that then

34
00:00:51,289 --> 00:00:52,070
you have things that are

35
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:52,640
intermediate

36
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,299
where based on like recent store

37
00:00:54,299 --> 00:00:56,109
activities such as like segmenting

38
00:00:56,109 --> 00:00:57,939
based on if somebody abandoned a

39
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,500
start recently if somebody made a

40
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:00,810
purchase recently then you have

41
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:02,399
like pro which is segmenting based

42
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:02,399
on

43
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,969
like specific email or flow

44
00:01:03,969 --> 00:01:05,680
engagement or like specific

45
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,700
product product category interest

46
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:07,700
all that good

47
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:09,099
stuff you can do all this the

48
00:01:09,099 --> 00:01:10,689
possibilities are literally

49
00:01:10,689 --> 00:01:14,280
they're literally endless but it's

50
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,280
just let's not get too

51
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:16,760
complicated is the main thing I

52
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,680
talk about with segmentation like

53
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,280
yes you could hyper segment your

54
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:19,700
list by their

55
00:01:19,859 --> 00:01:21,010
favorite color and their belly

56
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:22,420
button whether it's an innie or an

57
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:24,500
outie and yes that would probably

58
00:01:24,579 --> 00:01:24,939
increase your

59
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:27,069
conversion rate but at what cost

60
00:01:27,069 --> 00:01:29,000
so I always like to ask like would

61
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:30,450
you rather send one to two

62
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,019
targeted

63
00:01:31,189 --> 00:01:32,409
campaigns per week to different

64
00:01:32,409 --> 00:01:34,719
groups of 10,000 people or three

65
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:36,379
to four broader email campaigns a

66
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:37,430
week to 50,000

67
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:40,430
people the latter will outperform

68
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:42,780
99 times out of 100 I always

69
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:44,790
prefer like our time is always

70
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,680
limited in the day and

71
00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:48,680
what I've experienced is that

72
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,049
literally every single time just

73
00:01:51,049 --> 00:01:52,180
by optimizing for sending more

74
00:01:52,329 --> 00:01:54,680
emails to more people the revenue

75
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,799
is always way more

76
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,280
yes there's a time and place for

77
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,900
segmentation but optimize first

78
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,840
for getting like your core content

79
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,060
out to as many people as

80
00:02:02,209 --> 00:02:03,560
possible and then from there once

81
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,969
you really have that down then you

82
00:02:04,969 --> 00:02:06,439
can focus on the segmentation like

83
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:07,530
that's high leverage being

84
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:09,169
able to send good content to a lot

85
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:10,639
more people rather than hyper

86
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,300
specific content to a small group

87
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,379
of people who might not

88
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:14,530
even see your email because like

89
00:02:14,539 --> 00:02:16,770
they're busy so I'll be sharing

90
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:18,180
with you the high leverage stuff

91
00:02:18,259 --> 00:02:19,960
that you should be focusing on in

92
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,500
this guide
