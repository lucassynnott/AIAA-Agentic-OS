1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:01,540
So let's talk about why segment.

2
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:02,399
So the purpose of it.

3
00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:03,430
Segmentation allows you to

4
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:04,679
pinpoint certain members of your

5
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:06,179
list so you can gather data.

6
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:07,280
That's one of the main things that

7
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,310
I use segmentation for, gather

8
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:08,550
data.

9
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:09,919
And then also create targeted

10
00:00:09,919 --> 00:00:11,029
emails to send based on where

11
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,310
they're at in the customer

12
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:12,720
journey.

13
00:00:12,769 --> 00:00:14,000
So some benefits.

14
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:15,109
The main benefits is you can make

15
00:00:15,109 --> 00:00:16,059
more sales from it if you do it

16
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:16,760
the right way.

17
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,739
You can improve your

18
00:00:17,739 --> 00:00:19,350
deliverability as long as you're

19
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:21,429
focusing on content in targeting

20
00:00:21,429 --> 00:00:22,019
the right people.

21
00:00:22,059 --> 00:00:24,390
You can save time with automation.

22
00:00:24,469 --> 00:00:25,969
So putting people into segments

23
00:00:25,969 --> 00:00:27,480
and having automations to send

24
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,859
emails to these people based on

25
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:29,429
characteristics.

26
00:00:29,989 --> 00:00:31,129
And then a personalized customer

27
00:00:31,149 --> 00:00:31,739
experience.

28
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:32,929
That's the other thing that you

29
00:00:32,929 --> 00:00:34,119
don't really see too much like on

30
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:34,710
revenue.

31
00:00:34,759 --> 00:00:37,049
But having customized experience

32
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:39,140
really helps like the customer

33
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:41,299
makes them feel like valued.

34
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:43,119
So basic use case, use cases kind

35
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,869
of extending upon which we had

36
00:00:44,869 --> 00:00:45,579
before.

37
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:47,390
So these are kind of like the four

38
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,579
main use cases that you can use.

39
00:00:49,619 --> 00:00:52,259
So using engaged list for improved

40
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:53,880
deliverability.

41
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:55,070
So you can segment your general

42
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:56,460
list for campaigns to only include

43
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:57,780
people who have recently opened

44
00:00:57,829 --> 00:00:58,740
or clicked emails so that you

45
00:00:58,740 --> 00:00:59,899
ensure you're only sending people

46
00:00:59,899 --> 00:01:00,770
who want to open your emails.

47
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:02,049
This is the biggest use of

48
00:01:02,049 --> 00:01:03,020
segmentation.

49
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:04,430
And you should never be sending an

50
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:05,890
email campaign to your whole email

51
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:06,310
list.

52
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:07,719
Except maybe like Black Friday or

53
00:01:07,719 --> 00:01:08,879
a massive announcement.

54
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,019
Because the truth is a lot of

55
00:01:10,019 --> 00:01:11,230
people won't care about your

56
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:11,640
brand.

57
00:01:11,689 --> 00:01:12,900
And a lot of people use fake email

58
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:13,439
addresses.

59
00:01:13,629 --> 00:01:14,620
And so they're never going to open

60
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:15,340
an email of yours.

61
00:01:15,469 --> 00:01:16,599
So by you continuing to send

62
00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:17,939
emails to these people who will

63
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:19,260
never open your emails, they

64
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:20,790
don't care about your brand, they

65
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:22,450
changed email addresses, they used

66
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:23,620
a fake email address.

67
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:24,750
If you send to them, you're just

68
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:25,989
ruining your deliverability.

69
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,819
Because if an inbox provider sees

70
00:01:27,939 --> 00:01:29,560
you're sending emails to a lot of

71
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,909
people and not a lot of people

72
00:01:30,989 --> 00:01:32,099
are opening them, that's going to

73
00:01:32,099 --> 00:01:33,250
tell Google, be like, hey, not a

74
00:01:33,269 --> 00:01:34,170
lot of people want to receive

75
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:34,560
these emails.

76
00:01:34,609 --> 00:01:35,519
Not a lot of people opened it.

77
00:01:35,569 --> 00:01:36,659
Let's send them to spam.

78
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,069
And so if you can just only send

79
00:01:38,069 --> 00:01:39,500
to people who have opened your

80
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,489
emails before, it's a

81
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:42,510
huge difference on your

82
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:43,870
deliverability in the long run and

83
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,420
make sure that you will continue

84
00:01:45,469 --> 00:01:46,239
to land in the inbox.

85
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,530
And then the next one, two

86
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,129
interested customers for more

87
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:49,659
sales.

88
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:51,109
So you can target people who have

89
00:01:51,189 --> 00:01:52,489
been like active on your site or

90
00:01:52,489 --> 00:01:53,560
have like added items

91
00:01:53,609 --> 00:01:54,680
to their cart, but haven't made a

92
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,599
purchase and send them extra

93
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,530
content to try to get them

94
00:01:56,579 --> 00:01:57,239
across the line.

95
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:58,230
That's something extra that you

96
00:01:58,230 --> 00:01:58,530
can do.

97
00:01:58,609 --> 00:02:00,329
A lot of this stuff can be taken

98
00:02:00,349 --> 00:02:02,159
care of with your flows and your

99
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,469
automations, setting

100
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:04,819
up just like your abandoned cart

101
00:02:04,819 --> 00:02:06,180
flow, for example, to send emails,

102
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,079
people who abandoned

103
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,169
a cart, but you can also send

104
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:09,340
campaigns on top of this, like

105
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:10,479
maybe a couple of times a

106
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,280
month, you send a special discount

107
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,849
to people who have abandoned an

108
00:02:13,849 --> 00:02:15,199
item recently, but they

109
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:15,699
haven't purchased.

110
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:16,889
So that's something else that you

111
00:02:16,889 --> 00:02:17,289
can do.

112
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,560
You can also do a targeted

113
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,979
campaigns based on product

114
00:02:19,979 --> 00:02:20,719
interests.

115
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:22,280
So people who show interest in

116
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,009
certain products or categories,

117
00:02:24,009 --> 00:02:25,680
you can send them information.

118
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:27,360
Like maybe you have a new colorway

119
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,099
that came out for like your shoes,

120
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:30,300
your, your clothing

121
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:31,620
story of all sorts of different

122
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:32,979
stuff, but you only want to send

123
00:02:33,009 --> 00:02:33,659
this like my

124
00:02:33,699 --> 00:02:34,939
growth campaign to people who have

125
00:02:34,939 --> 00:02:36,259
bought shoes before or have looked

126
00:02:36,259 --> 00:02:37,060
at your shoes before.

127
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:38,469
You can do that and send like more

128
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:40,219
targeted campaigns to them without

129
00:02:40,219 --> 00:02:40,900
bothering the rest

130
00:02:40,949 --> 00:02:41,300
of your list.

131
00:02:41,419 --> 00:02:42,759
That's another use case.

132
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:44,270
And another one, remove unengaged

133
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,110
profiles for improved

134
00:02:45,259 --> 00:02:46,180
deliverability.

135
00:02:46,229 --> 00:02:47,469
So kind of tied to number one, but

136
00:02:47,469 --> 00:02:48,860
kind of the opposite, removing the

137
00:02:48,889 --> 00:02:49,840
unengaged profile.

138
00:02:49,889 --> 00:02:51,099
So it's important to always track

139
00:02:51,099 --> 00:02:52,349
and suppress people who haven't

140
00:02:52,349 --> 00:02:53,639
been engaging with your emails

141
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,900
since customers will just

142
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:55,900
naturally churn.

143
00:02:55,979 --> 00:02:57,479
You can't expect someone to be

144
00:02:57,479 --> 00:02:59,349
with you until they're 80 years

145
00:02:59,349 --> 00:02:59,800
old.

146
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,909
They're going to naturally,

147
00:03:00,909 --> 00:03:02,060
there's going to be a point where

148
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:03,560
they stop opening your emails.

149
00:03:03,689 --> 00:03:04,830
So since they aren't opening your

150
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:05,979
emails, you want to remove them

151
00:03:05,979 --> 00:03:06,800
from your list so that

152
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,080
you aren't harming your

153
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,030
deliverability, A, to not send to

154
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:10,580
them.

155
00:03:10,629 --> 00:03:11,979
And then also to save your Klaviyo

156
00:03:11,979 --> 00:03:13,080
bill so that you can know to

157
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,379
suppress these people so

158
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:15,370
that you're not getting charged by

159
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:16,120
your active profile.
