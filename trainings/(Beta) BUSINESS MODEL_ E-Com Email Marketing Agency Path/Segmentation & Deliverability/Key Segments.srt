1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:01,899
So those are the different types

2
00:00:01,899 --> 00:00:03,250
of segmentation so now let's get

3
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:04,599
to like the juicy stuff which is

4
00:00:04,639 --> 00:00:05,960
actually like the key segments the

5
00:00:05,969 --> 00:00:07,290
segments that we build out for all

6
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:08,380
of our clients right off the

7
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,740
bat and stuff that we track over

8
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:11,560
time this is the 80 20 rule these

9
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:12,880
are the main ones that you want

10
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,339
to use all the other stuff is kind

11
00:00:14,339 --> 00:00:15,859
of noise and you don't really need

12
00:00:15,859 --> 00:00:17,079
to worry too much about it

13
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,969
uh just focus on these key

14
00:00:18,969 --> 00:00:21,350
segments so this first one is the

15
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:23,780
x day engaged email members so

16
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:24,230
this is

17
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:26,010
for sending three three or more

18
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:27,769
emails per week we found that to

19
00:00:27,859 --> 00:00:29,739
be optimal three to four times a

20
00:00:29,769 --> 00:00:31,890
week across over 50 different econ

21
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:33,700
brands um seven and eight figures

22
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:34,920
send three to four email

23
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:36,210
campaigns a week keeps you top of

24
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:37,340
mind and it allows you to like

25
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:38,700
build that relationship with

26
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:39,810
the customer and as long as you

27
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:41,100
send good content then people will

28
00:00:41,109 --> 00:00:42,390
enjoy your emails and they won't

29
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:43,759
find it annoying we notice lower

30
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:45,170
unsubscribe rates on this rather

31
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:46,670
than sending like once per week so

32
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:48,149
this is your base engaged email

33
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:49,780
segment for sending campaigns so x

34
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,539
stands for like whatever amount of

35
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,899
days you want to do i recommend

36
00:00:52,909 --> 00:00:54,640
starting off with a 60 day engaged

37
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,340
list and only send emails to these

38
00:00:56,369 --> 00:00:57,439
people like your general email

39
00:00:57,439 --> 00:00:58,609
campaigns only send to people who

40
00:00:58,609 --> 00:00:59,439
have opened or clicked

41
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:00,960
an email in the past 60 days so we

42
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:02,240
want to send this segment to

43
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,740
ensure that we're only sending

44
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:05,000
people who want to receive their

45
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,069
our emails to make sure we get

46
00:01:06,129 --> 00:01:07,480
high engagement rates which will

47
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:08,930
keep our deliverability high

48
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:10,489
rather than sending to our whole

49
00:01:10,489 --> 00:01:12,840
email list with fake profiles uh

50
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:13,239
churned

51
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:14,290
subscribers we don't want to send

52
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:15,299
to those people who aren't going

53
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:16,980
to open our emails so only send to

54
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,180
the engaged people um you can

55
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,530
adjust this from any day that you

56
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:21,159
want i recommend starting with 30

57
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,900
um i know i just said 60 that's

58
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:24,420
like the base but if you haven't

59
00:01:24,519 --> 00:01:25,959
really done any segmentation

60
00:01:25,989 --> 00:01:27,209
before start with 30 day and

61
00:01:27,209 --> 00:01:28,819
slowly open your list to 60 90 and

62
00:01:28,819 --> 00:01:30,219
120 as your open rates go up

63
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:32,030
so we want to be at least 40 opens

64
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:33,739
so say you start off with your 30

65
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,480
day engaged list and you have

66
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,280
uh like 35 percent opens um and

67
00:01:37,349 --> 00:01:39,230
you start sending consistently you

68
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:40,950
start focusing on your content

69
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:41,140
your

70
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:42,819
open rate starts climbing it goes

71
00:01:42,819 --> 00:01:45,260
from 35 to 40 to 45 to 50 once you

72
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,969
get to 50 then it's like okay

73
00:01:46,969 --> 00:01:47,280
let's

74
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,469
expand the list a little bit um

75
00:01:48,469 --> 00:01:49,849
then you switch it from a 30 day

76
00:01:49,849 --> 00:01:51,480
engaged to a 60 day and maybe you

77
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:51,549
start

78
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:53,450
back down at like 30 and then keep

79
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:55,170
sending emails to them now you're

80
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:57,819
at 35 40 45 50 55 now let's open

81
00:01:57,819 --> 00:01:58,159
it and so

82
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,299
that's what i always recommend

83
00:01:59,299 --> 00:02:00,650
until you get to like 90 or 120

84
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:02,060
and then you're good to stop there

85
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,530
so this is the definition inside

86
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:05,310
of klaviyo someone can receive

87
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:07,000
email marketing because this

88
00:02:07,099 --> 00:02:07,659
person is

89
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:09,639
subscribed um and then and we want

90
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,580
to have had someone has opened an

91
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,469
email at least once in the last 60

92
00:02:13,509 --> 00:02:15,289
days um or it's right between that

93
00:02:15,349 --> 00:02:17,009
or someone has clicked an email at

94
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:18,939
least once in the last 60 days

95
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,030
now you're probably like oh well

96
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:21,039
somebody has to click an email

97
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:22,210
someone has to open an email to

98
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:23,659
click so why do you both sometimes

99
00:02:23,659 --> 00:02:25,039
klaviyo doesn't track the opens

100
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:26,439
sometimes it misses it so

101
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:28,310
it's just like a safety measure um

102
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:30,210
and then and what someone has done

103
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:31,819
bounced email zero times

104
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,939
over all time just to make sure

105
00:02:32,939 --> 00:02:34,099
we're not sending to like these

106
00:02:34,099 --> 00:02:35,340
fake profiles or people who have

107
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:37,509
blocked us or something so this is

108
00:02:37,509 --> 00:02:39,370
like the main list where for my

109
00:02:39,389 --> 00:02:41,509
clients this is where 90 of our

110
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,270
emails are going is just to this

111
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:44,939
sort of list and so moving on we

112
00:02:44,939 --> 00:02:46,960
have the unengaged email members

113
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,120
so

114
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:49,740
this is for sending like one email

115
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:52,210
per month um usually this is like

116
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,659
for usually one campaign a month

117
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,110
we'll try to like unengaged people

118
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:57,560
typically you could have you could

119
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,159
have a specific email where

120
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,639
it's like hey you're you're

121
00:03:00,789 --> 00:03:02,840
unengaged take 10 off to come back

122
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,819
um but typically we don't like to

123
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,979
complicate it we'll just send one

124
00:03:05,979 --> 00:03:07,020
of our regular campaigns that

125
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,280
we're sending to the engaged list

126
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:09,569
which we which we just went over

127
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:10,930
we'll just send it to the engaged

128
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:12,340
and the unengaged people to try to

129
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,449
get these people back we don't

130
00:03:13,449 --> 00:03:14,669
want to send every single email to

131
00:03:14,729 --> 00:03:16,000
these people because they're just

132
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,349
going to hurt our center

133
00:03:17,349 --> 00:03:19,099
reputation by driving down our

134
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:20,780
open rates but over time we can

135
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:21,659
send like once a

136
00:03:21,699 --> 00:03:23,259
month typically is what i

137
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,169
recommend um so the unengaged

138
00:03:25,169 --> 00:03:27,580
email members this insinuates that

139
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:27,740
they

140
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:29,030
were engaged at some point so we

141
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:30,520
just said someone has opened email

142
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:32,009
in the past but haven't done so

143
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,539
recently you can suppress these

144
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,090
people if you want so this is like

145
00:03:35,139 --> 00:03:36,699
a base segment that you can use

146
00:03:36,729 --> 00:03:37,669
someone can receive email

147
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:38,689
marketing because they're

148
00:03:38,689 --> 00:03:39,969
subscribed they've opened email at

149
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:40,689
least once over

150
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:42,590
all time but they haven't opened

151
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:44,759
or clicked an email in the past 90

152
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:46,539
days so three months you could do

153
00:03:46,539 --> 00:03:46,699
you

154
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:48,039
could change this from 90 days to

155
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:49,520
120 days it really doesn't matter

156
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,689
all that much the difference

157
00:03:50,729 --> 00:03:51,969
between somebody not opening an

158
00:03:51,969 --> 00:03:53,310
email in three months versus four

159
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:54,379
months isn't that big but

160
00:03:54,379 --> 00:03:54,780
different

161
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,789
it's really all this is you can do

162
00:03:56,789 --> 00:03:58,889
what you want just typically what

163
00:03:58,889 --> 00:04:01,020
we do is around 90 days um

164
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,300
and then we'll still send emails

165
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,490
to these people like once a month

166
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:04,860
but this is what the segment looks

167
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:05,939
like you have you can have it here

168
00:04:05,939 --> 00:04:07,069
for yourself again this talk is in

169
00:04:07,069 --> 00:04:08,379
the description sorry if i didn't

170
00:04:08,379 --> 00:04:08,389
say

171
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:10,530
that already um but you can have

172
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:12,669
this for free um but yeah there's

173
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,620
that um unengaged email members

174
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:16,639
right there this next one a little

175
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:18,310
bit more fun high potential

176
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:20,449
purchasers so this is for sending

177
00:04:20,449 --> 00:04:20,620
one

178
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:21,970
to two times extra emails per

179
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,500
month on top of your engaged list

180
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,259
sends and then people these people

181
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:25,410
are

182
00:04:25,449 --> 00:04:27,319
also getting abandonment uh flows

183
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:29,089
so uh high potential purchasers

184
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,620
this is a set of people who have

185
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:30,860
been

186
00:04:30,889 --> 00:04:32,209
active on your site and have made

187
00:04:32,209 --> 00:04:33,459
it somewhere in the funnel but

188
00:04:33,459 --> 00:04:35,019
they just haven't made a purchase

189
00:04:35,019 --> 00:04:35,569
yet so

190
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,689
high potential um you can send

191
00:04:36,689 --> 00:04:37,850
them more emails try to get them

192
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:38,939
over the edge to increase your

193
00:04:38,939 --> 00:04:39,259
sales

194
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,939
so maybe you have like a specific

195
00:04:40,939 --> 00:04:42,689
uh sale that you're willing to run

196
00:04:42,689 --> 00:04:43,959
for some people this is the

197
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,250
type of list that you want to send

198
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,310
that to like you don't want to

199
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:47,660
send it to everybody but you're

200
00:04:47,689 --> 00:04:49,319
open to run a sale to a specific

201
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:51,029
number of people um people that

202
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:52,860
otherwise would be lost then you

203
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:52,939
can

204
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,199
send this stuff so this is the

205
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:55,579
definition that we use for high

206
00:04:55,579 --> 00:04:57,100
potential purchasers you say

207
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:57,339
someone

208
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,420
can receive email marketing

209
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:59,810
because they're subscribed they've

210
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:01,329
placed an order zero times in the

211
00:05:01,339 --> 00:05:02,139
past 30 days

212
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,490
so high potential purchasers

213
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:04,990
they're not purchasers right now

214
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:06,699
uh so zero times past 30 days and

215
00:05:06,699 --> 00:05:06,839
they've

216
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:08,610
been active on site at least once

217
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:10,129
or you don't want to say and you

218
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:12,220
want to make sure it says or

219
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,660
they have viewed a product at

220
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:15,459
least once in the past 30 days or

221
00:05:15,459 --> 00:05:17,009
they've added a cart or they've

222
00:05:17,009 --> 00:05:17,290
started

223
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:19,149
checkout all in the past 30 days

224
00:05:19,209 --> 00:05:20,610
if they've done any of those so

225
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:22,410
they've gone to checkout they've

226
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:22,699
added

227
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,610
to cart or they've been active on

228
00:05:24,629 --> 00:05:26,370
site anything then they will

229
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:28,699
receive this now you might think

230
00:05:28,699 --> 00:05:28,939
this is a

231
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:30,370
little bit redundant because

232
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:31,970
somebody if somebody adds an item

233
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:33,420
to cart that means they had to

234
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:33,420
have

235
00:05:33,449 --> 00:05:34,870
been active on site sometimes

236
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:36,519
klaviyo doesn't track these things

237
00:05:36,579 --> 00:05:38,209
maybe one of your triggers isn't

238
00:05:38,209 --> 00:05:38,360
set

239
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:40,029
up right so it's not firing this

240
00:05:40,029 --> 00:05:41,550
is just a precaution it's not

241
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,319
going to hurt you um use all these

242
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:43,740
just to

243
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:45,220
be safe and so this is what it

244
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,269
looks like inside of klaviyo it's

245
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,180
a lot more stuff um so you can see

246
00:05:51,449 --> 00:05:53,519
this is they someone can receive

247
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,529
email marketing and um they've

248
00:05:55,529 --> 00:05:57,420
been active on site or viewed

249
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:57,660
product

250
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,730
or added cart or checkout started

251
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:01,639
and they've placed an order zero

252
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:03,980
times um in the past 30 days so

253
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:04,220
that's

254
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,300
a segment that you want to create

255
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,430
for high potential purchasers and

256
00:06:06,459 --> 00:06:07,660
send them like an extra one to two

257
00:06:07,699 --> 00:06:09,139
emails per month if you would if

258
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:10,759
you choose to do so with like an

259
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:12,459
extra sale or just an extra push

260
00:06:12,459 --> 00:06:12,600
to

261
00:06:12,649 --> 00:06:14,829
try to get them over the edge then

262
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:17,000
we have vip customers which is a

263
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,699
another fun one so you this is

264
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,360
something you can send one extra

265
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,949
email per month uh i wouldn't do

266
00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:23,410
more than this it's just a little

267
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:24,889
bit too much for a very small

268
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,519
subset of your list um because

269
00:06:26,579 --> 00:06:28,129
they're also getting all the

270
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,019
engaged list

271
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:30,699
emails if they're engaged in your

272
00:06:30,699 --> 00:06:32,259
emails but they're getting the

273
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:33,959
engaged list sent as well so

274
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:34,300
pretty

275
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:35,750
self-explanatory they're fans of

276
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,019
your brand and they keep coming

277
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:38,290
back um so you can choose to make

278
00:06:38,329 --> 00:06:39,779
your vip list either on like the

279
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,560
number of purchases somebody has

280
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,180
made or the total amount spent at

281
00:06:43,209 --> 00:06:45,509
your store completely preference

282
00:06:45,569 --> 00:06:47,589
based me as a marketer i prefer

283
00:06:47,589 --> 00:06:48,379
total number of

284
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:49,850
purchases because you can predict

285
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,209
it a little bit better and send

286
00:06:51,209 --> 00:06:52,779
emails every purchase letting

287
00:06:52,819 --> 00:06:54,550
people know how many purchases

288
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:56,240
they are from the vip list um so

289
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,779
for example if we do like uh on

290
00:06:58,779 --> 00:06:58,860
your

291
00:06:58,889 --> 00:07:00,149
fifth purchase you're a vip member

292
00:07:00,149 --> 00:07:01,149
then that means like after

293
00:07:01,149 --> 00:07:02,230
somebody makes their fourth

294
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:02,750
purchase we

295
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,250
can be like yo you're one purchase

296
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:05,810
away from getting like a free gift

297
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,490
or something and being on our vip

298
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:09,160
list with exclusive information um

299
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,529
so then it's a lot more it's a lot

300
00:07:10,579 --> 00:07:11,939
easier to get sales that way and

301
00:07:11,939 --> 00:07:11,980
you

302
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,180
can do that for like the third

303
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:14,589
purchase as well whereas if you do

304
00:07:14,589 --> 00:07:15,939
like a total value spend of like a

305
00:07:15,939 --> 00:07:16,250
thousand

306
00:07:16,339 --> 00:07:17,730
dollars really it's a lot more

307
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:19,399
difficult to predict that because

308
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:21,660
somebody's at like 900 spent and

309
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,360
you're like yo you're it's harder

310
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,759
to say it's a little bit more

311
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:26,459
cheap not like it's like sales

312
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,810
they'd be like you have to give us

313
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:29,160
a hundred more dollars and we'll

314
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,449
give you a gift rather than like

315
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,870
you place another order and it's a

316
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:33,230
little bit harder to predict the

317
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:34,699
number like you can be you're so

318
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,639
close to being a member and they

319
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,970
are at like 950 spent of like a

320
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:40,860
thousand so you think like maybe

321
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:42,079
it's one purchase but then they

322
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,360
buy just like a 20 item like a

323
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,850
small one and then they don't make

324
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,339
it and then they might get upset

325
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:47,699
so um that's kind of what i

326
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:49,420
recommend it's a good very good

327
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:49,740
idea to

328
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:51,220
have like a simple vip email flow

329
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:52,660
to anybody who like joins the

330
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:54,300
segment uh thanking them and give

331
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:54,449
them

332
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,879
some exclusive content and like a

333
00:07:55,879 --> 00:07:57,180
generous offer is always what i

334
00:07:57,209 --> 00:07:58,540
recommend um and it's smart to

335
00:07:58,540 --> 00:07:58,699
send

336
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,959
a vip email at least once a

337
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:01,660
quarter uh with like an exclusive

338
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:03,339
dealer offer you can send like one

339
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:04,689
extra email per month just like

340
00:08:04,689 --> 00:08:06,100
with exclusive content at least

341
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,329
once a quarter you can try to

342
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:09,149
give these people a special offer

343
00:08:09,209 --> 00:08:10,550
so definition like a base

344
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:12,279
definition is what i like to do

345
00:08:12,379 --> 00:08:12,540
they can

346
00:08:12,569 --> 00:08:13,889
receive email marketing and they

347
00:08:13,889 --> 00:08:15,220
place an order at least five times

348
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:17,089
over all time super simple

349
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,579
you can do a little bit more fancy

350
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,339
stuff you could say they place an

351
00:08:20,339 --> 00:08:22,040
order at least five times and

352
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,839
they've spent at least 500 at your

353
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:24,990
store it's just a little bit

354
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:27,019
harder to predict and um so i

355
00:08:27,019 --> 00:08:27,079
always

356
00:08:27,629 --> 00:08:29,189
prefer to do like five um but that

357
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,139
is vip customers now we have win

358
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:33,340
back potential customers so this

359
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,798
for sending like one extra email

360
00:08:34,798 --> 00:08:36,210
per month on top of your engaged

361
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:37,610
list sends kind of kind of similar

362
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:37,740
to

363
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:39,548
unengaged but unengaged is for

364
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:41,429
email engagement win back is for

365
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:43,259
past customers so this list is

366
00:08:43,259 --> 00:08:43,658
exclusive

367
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:44,919
people who have bought a certain

368
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:46,139
period of time ago they haven't

369
00:08:46,139 --> 00:08:47,419
purchased recently the amount of

370
00:08:47,419 --> 00:08:47,649
time

371
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:48,879
is going to vary based on like the

372
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:49,990
store and the average buying

373
00:08:50,049 --> 00:08:51,500
period in between purchases like

374
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,559
if you sell hot tubs probably have

375
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:54,490
a couple years in between

376
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:55,769
purchases typically if there is

377
00:08:55,879 --> 00:08:56,059
another

378
00:08:56,529 --> 00:08:57,539
purchase and so you might want to

379
00:08:57,679 --> 00:08:59,159
have a win back campaign to try to

380
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:01,000
get people back like way later

381
00:09:01,139 --> 00:09:02,490
whereas like for a supplement

382
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,100
brand where you sell in like 30

383
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,899
day servings after like 30 days

384
00:09:05,899 --> 00:09:05,980
you

385
00:09:06,009 --> 00:09:07,450
want to have a win back campaign

386
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:09,240
so for this group you want to have

387
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,860
a few flow emails to fire when

388
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:11,779
they enter the segment to

389
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:12,919
encourage these people to come

390
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:14,299
back and make another purchase and

391
00:09:14,299 --> 00:09:14,539
maybe a

392
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:15,750
good idea to later in the flow

393
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:16,870
give them a discount if they

394
00:09:16,929 --> 00:09:18,220
haven't purchased yet something

395
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:18,529
like

396
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:20,019
a supplement where every 30 days

397
00:09:20,169 --> 00:09:21,639
it's like a 30-day trial then you

398
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:23,019
might want to start your win back

399
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:25,100
campaign like on day 45 like it's

400
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,840
been hey you've used up all your

401
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,299
supplement like do you want to

402
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,710
come back how did you like it and

403
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:31,250
then send them a couple reminders

404
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:33,100
just to like try to get them back

405
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:33,980
and then maybe send them a

406
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,190
discount so the base definition is

407
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:36,360
definitely going to depend on your

408
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:36,629
store

409
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,879
and like what your numbers and

410
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:39,240
average buying periods are but for

411
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,500
this one it could be your win back

412
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,440
period could be a period of like

413
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,750
60 days so after three months so

414
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,740
if someone has a cheap has can

415
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:49,299
receive email marketing they place

416
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:50,850
an order at least once in the past

417
00:09:50,889 --> 00:09:53,019
150 days they've placed order zero

418
00:09:53,049 --> 00:09:54,899
times in the last 90 days so that

419
00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:56,750
means their last order was between

420
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,860
90 and 150 days ago so we have

421
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:00,600
this 60 day period here where

422
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,129
they're win back eligible and

423
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,299
whereas like after it gets to 150

424
00:10:04,299 --> 00:10:04,620
days it's

425
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:06,100
like okay they are not interested

426
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,720
they maybe went with a competitor

427
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,889
and they're more in the longer

428
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,179
term

429
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,649
win back flow but this one is like

430
00:10:10,649 --> 00:10:12,019
a buying period where we met we

431
00:10:12,019 --> 00:10:13,340
might want to send them a couple

432
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:15,360
extra emails and trigger them into

433
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:17,309
a flow so this went back potential

434
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:18,539
they can't receive it with

435
00:10:19,009 --> 00:10:20,279
marketing and they've placed order

436
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:22,179
at least once in the last 150 days

437
00:10:22,179 --> 00:10:23,659
you could change this and they've

438
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,139
placed order zero times in the

439
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:26,919
last 90 days so that's went back

440
00:10:27,019 --> 00:10:28,940
potential now let's talk about the

441
00:10:29,409 --> 00:10:30,409
suppressed list which is another

442
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:31,549
sad one but this is for not

443
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:33,210
sending any emails to so this is

444
00:10:33,259 --> 00:10:33,500
an email

445
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:35,289
segment um that is used for people

446
00:10:35,299 --> 00:10:36,960
who aren't engaging with any of

447
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,440
your emails and or their

448
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:39,539
high-risk profiles that don't

449
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:40,629
deserve to be sent emails because

450
00:10:40,629 --> 00:10:41,639
they'll just ruin our email

451
00:10:42,129 --> 00:10:43,129
reputation as i discussed earlier

452
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:44,470
so you should be looking at this

453
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:45,820
list once a month and suppressing

454
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:47,440
these profiles to save yourself on

455
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,830
deliverability and then also

456
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:50,379
costing your clavio bill which

457
00:10:50,379 --> 00:10:50,759
charges

458
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:52,080
you based on like your email

459
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,629
profiles so base definition these

460
00:10:53,629 --> 00:10:55,019
are the people that you want to

461
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:56,500
suppress someone has opened an

462
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:58,500
email zero times in the past 180

463
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,090
days personally i suppress all

464
00:11:00,179 --> 00:11:00,299
these

465
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:02,059
people um just to save costs or

466
00:11:02,059 --> 00:11:03,759
someone has bounced an email

467
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:05,580
anybody bounces an email i don't

468
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:06,299
want to email you

469
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,960
um or somebody has like marked an

470
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,559
email as spam at least once over

471
00:11:09,659 --> 00:11:11,500
all time um so this is the base

472
00:11:11,529 --> 00:11:12,519
list uh that i use and

473
00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:14,220
automatically we'll have this on

474
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:15,909
the suppressed list and then once

475
00:11:15,909 --> 00:11:16,440
a month we'll

476
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:17,899
look at this suppressed list and

477
00:11:17,899 --> 00:11:19,360
then just suppress right in clavio

478
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,809
you can just click on the settings

479
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:23,059
of the list or of the segment and

480
00:11:23,059 --> 00:11:25,450
mark them as suppressed so that's

481
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:27,740
what i do um a little bit more

482
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:28,009
advanced

483
00:11:28,169 --> 00:11:29,620
here we have an interested in x

484
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:31,139
product or a category this for

485
00:11:31,139 --> 00:11:32,620
sending one to two extra emails

486
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:33,419
per month if you want

487
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,710
on top of uh engage with sense

488
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:36,139
this is a list of people who have

489
00:11:36,169 --> 00:11:37,659
had any interest in a specific

490
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,139
product or category in the store

491
00:11:39,289 --> 00:11:40,470
and this will depend store to

492
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:41,820
store on like the different

493
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:42,360
categories you

494
00:11:42,409 --> 00:11:43,860
want to set but it's a great way

495
00:11:44,009 --> 00:11:45,750
to track what the interests are in

496
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,320
your store and then if you have

497
00:11:47,419 --> 00:11:47,740
any

498
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:49,360
specific sales announcements or

499
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:51,000
releases related to the items that

500
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,679
you set in your segment then you

501
00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:52,779
can

502
00:11:52,809 --> 00:11:54,590
send that to this group anybody

503
00:11:54,649 --> 00:11:56,419
who has is interested so you can

504
00:11:56,419 --> 00:11:58,299
do this by product or category

505
00:11:58,299 --> 00:11:58,700
whatever you

506
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:00,440
have in shopify you can do both if

507
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,970
you want um just depends on how

508
00:12:02,059 --> 00:12:03,740
you have organized thing and

509
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:03,899
things

510
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:05,629
in shopify so customize it uh in

511
00:12:05,629 --> 00:12:07,419
the segment definition to choose

512
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,179
either product or category

513
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:10,340
which i'll show you here in a

514
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:11,720
second so this is the definition

515
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,259
that we go for um this is for a

516
00:12:13,259 --> 00:12:13,820
category

517
00:12:14,289 --> 00:12:16,029
example just change it to product

518
00:12:16,059 --> 00:12:18,230
rather than collection um so all

519
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:19,899
you do is someone can receive

520
00:12:19,929 --> 00:12:21,370
email marketing and they have

521
00:12:21,529 --> 00:12:23,360
viewed an item at least once where

522
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,690
the category is whatever your

523
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:25,659
category is

524
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:27,570
at least once or they've added an

525
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:29,169
item to cart or someone has

526
00:12:29,169 --> 00:12:31,179
started checkout where collection

527
00:12:31,179 --> 00:12:31,259
is

528
00:12:31,289 --> 00:12:32,740
this item or they have placed an

529
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:34,360
order where collection is this

530
00:12:34,419 --> 00:12:36,200
item so here's the base definition

531
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,570
for a category not product for

532
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:38,990
product you just want to change

533
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:40,460
the category and collection to

534
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:41,159
product but

535
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:42,600
you say someone can receive email

536
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,950
marketing because this person is

537
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:45,500
subscribed someone has viewed an

538
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:45,740
item

539
00:12:45,769 --> 00:12:47,120
where the category is this at

540
00:12:47,139 --> 00:12:48,549
least once or they've added to

541
00:12:48,549 --> 00:12:50,220
cart where the category is that

542
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:51,340
over all time or

543
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,700
they've started to check out where

544
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:54,149
that's their collection or someone

545
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:55,330
has placed an order or that's

546
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:56,500
their collection so these are

547
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,799
going to be a little bit different

548
00:12:57,799 --> 00:12:59,179
in shopify a little bit advanced

549
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:01,259
but i think you can figure it out

550
00:13:01,259 --> 00:13:03,450
because uh these clavio and added

551
00:13:03,559 --> 00:13:05,980
to cart metrics these are within

552
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,190
clavio and via clavios like um

553
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:10,580
clavios i can't think of the word

554
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:13,129
but how clavio connects to shopify

555
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,610
whereas these are native stop

556
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:16,269
shopify triggers start a checkout

557
00:13:16,269 --> 00:13:17,419
place to order so they use

558
00:13:17,419 --> 00:13:18,120
collections

559
00:13:18,259 --> 00:13:19,700
whereas clavio uses categories so

560
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:21,159
you'll be able to figure it out as

561
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:22,299
long as you have everything

562
00:13:22,769 --> 00:13:23,779
organized in shopify just create

563
00:13:23,929 --> 00:13:25,149
the segment you'll be good so

564
00:13:25,149 --> 00:13:26,700
there's this make all the segments

565
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:26,779
you

566
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:28,049
want for all the products and

567
00:13:28,049 --> 00:13:29,440
categories you want and then we

568
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,669

569
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:30,940
whatever

570
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,110
you want which you could send one

571
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:33,250
to two extra emails per month on

572
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,460
top of your engaged list sends

573
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:35,659
or you can just set up flows to

574
00:13:35,659 --> 00:13:36,870
take care of this for you so this

575
00:13:36,929 --> 00:13:38,059
list of people who have purchased

576
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:39,620
an item or category in the store

577
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:41,240
that you set um so if you have a

578
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,179
common cross sell um you can

579
00:13:43,179 --> 00:13:43,340
create

580
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,629
the segment um to people who

581
00:13:44,659 --> 00:13:46,269
purchase one item so that you know

582
00:13:46,269 --> 00:13:47,820
this person has purchased this

583
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:48,049
item

584
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,690
now let's try to cross sell them

585
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:51,159
to this item um so you can do this

586
00:13:51,159 --> 00:13:52,620
again for both products or

587
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:53,019
specific

588
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:54,730
categories and you can customize

589
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:56,279
the filter to choose the product

590
00:13:56,379 --> 00:13:58,539
or category you want so definition

591
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:00,220
for this category someone has can

592
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,639
receive email marketing and

593
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,179
someone has placed an order where

594
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:05,299
the item is the specific item so

595
00:14:05,299 --> 00:14:07,149
say let's go back to the shoe

596
00:14:07,169 --> 00:14:09,659
example say i have white shoes say

597
00:14:09,659 --> 00:14:09,980
there's

598
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,769
one pair of white shoes in your

599
00:14:11,779 --> 00:14:13,440
store and you want to you're

600
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,580
releasing you release like a white

601
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:15,980
pair

602
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,870
of socks and uh people often buy

603
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:21,820
them together um then if i buy the

604
00:14:21,879 --> 00:14:24,549
white shoes then i can be added to

605
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,100
this segment to where you then can

606
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,570
be like okay this person bought

607
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:29,179
white shoes let's try to sell them

608
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:30,659
white socks then you can set like

609
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:31,960
a cross sell flow where okay

610
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,450
somebody entered this segment

611
00:14:33,559 --> 00:14:34,059
let's try to

612
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,279
push them let's create an email

613
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:36,570
that sells them on socks and tell

614
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:37,970
them specifically you bought these

615
00:14:38,009 --> 00:14:39,129
awesome white shoes match them

616
00:14:39,129 --> 00:14:40,240
with white socks and so that's

617
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,649
something you can do literally as

618
00:14:41,659 --> 00:14:41,820
simple

619
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,110
as this someone can receive email

620
00:14:43,139 --> 00:14:44,399
marketing and they've placed an

621
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:45,980
order at least once over all time

622
00:14:46,009 --> 00:14:47,190
where the collection equals

623
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:48,549
whatever it is in this case it was

624
00:14:48,549 --> 00:14:50,059
protein you could also if you want

625
00:14:50,059 --> 00:14:50,220
to

626
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,419
say it was protein and we are uh

627
00:14:52,419 --> 00:14:54,259
trying to cross sell them

628
00:14:54,269 --> 00:14:57,019
pre-workout and you don't want to

629
00:14:57,019 --> 00:14:57,340
send an

630
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,429
email to anybody who's bought

631
00:14:58,429 --> 00:14:59,409
pre-workout before that's

632
00:14:59,409 --> 00:15:00,700
something you could do as well you

633
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:01,330
just add another

634
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:02,669
condition say someone has placed

635
00:15:02,669 --> 00:15:03,950
order at least once over all time

636
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:05,500
where collections contains protein

637
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:07,610
and then add an and so add another

638
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:09,169
condition right here and say and

639
00:15:09,169 --> 00:15:10,700
someone has placed an order zero

640
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,169
times over all time where

641
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,649
collections equals pre-workout and

642
00:15:14,649 --> 00:15:16,940
then send an email to anybody who

643
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:18,679
open who joins this list set up a

644
00:15:18,679 --> 00:15:20,200
flow that says hey you bought

645
00:15:20,299 --> 00:15:22,009
protein you want to make the most

646
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:22,220
out of

647
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:23,580
your workout um buy our

648
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:25,470
pre-workout and that'll work

649
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:27,269
really well so let's go over a

650
00:15:27,269 --> 00:15:28,620
bonus segmentation

651
00:15:28,649 --> 00:15:30,350
hack which i like to do uh

652
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:32,700
received x email but didn't open

653
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:35,659
so this is going to be less of a

654
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,139
dynamic segment and more of like

655
00:15:37,289 --> 00:15:38,610
one that you do on a case-by-case

656
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:40,940
situation but we're set we're

657
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,230
creating a segment for people who

658
00:15:42,259 --> 00:15:43,549
received an email but didn't open

659
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:44,779
it um so there's a very useful

660
00:15:44,809 --> 00:15:46,039
segment trick that you can use to

661
00:15:46,039 --> 00:15:47,389
resend important emails to people

662
00:15:47,409 --> 00:15:48,860
who like didn't open your original

663
00:15:48,889 --> 00:15:50,149
email so say you have like an

664
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:51,629
important email for like black

665
00:15:51,629 --> 00:15:54,059
friday or whatever and but someone

666
00:15:54,059 --> 00:15:54,220
could

667
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,190
be busy at the time you sent the

668
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,210
email and they just didn't have a

669
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:57,980
chance to look at it um if it's

670
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,450
an important email you can just

671
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:01,009
resend anybody who didn't open it

672
00:16:01,059 --> 00:16:02,250
like one to two days later

673
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,769
um and this segment in resending

674
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:05,470
this using this little trick will

675
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:06,700
help you get the most out of

676
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:08,179
your email so we often use this

677
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:09,970
for product releases big sales or

678
00:16:10,059 --> 00:16:12,779
big announcements um just wait a

679
00:16:12,779 --> 00:16:13,100
day or

680
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,799
two we got 60 opens on the initial

681
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:16,350
email that means 40 of people

682
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,740
didn't open okay let's take that

683
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:18,539
40

684
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:19,799
use the segment trick and resend

685
00:16:19,799 --> 00:16:20,870
the email to them with like a

686
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:22,059
different subject line and a

687
00:16:22,059 --> 00:16:22,299
different

688
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:23,509
preview text so it doesn't look

689
00:16:23,509 --> 00:16:24,730
like we sent the same thing over

690
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:26,139
and over again if they did see the

691
00:16:26,179 --> 00:16:28,149
first one but just didn't open so

692
00:16:28,149 --> 00:16:29,830
step one all you have to do is

693
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:32,220
click onto your specific email so

694
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:32,299
i

695
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,720
just clicked on i'm in campaigns i

696
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,129
click on the campaign this is like

697
00:16:35,129 --> 00:16:36,460
where the name of it would be

698
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:38,980
you can see 42 opened um all we

699
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:41,320
want to do is we want to grab this

700
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,340
little code right here so this is

701
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:45,549
the campaign message id uh this is

702
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:47,419
what how klaviyo tracks the

703
00:16:47,419 --> 00:16:49,820
campaign so we just want to copy

704
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:50,220
this

705
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:51,970
that's all step one is click onto

706
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:53,490
it and uh for the email that you

707
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:55,259
want to resend and then copy the

708
00:16:55,289 --> 00:16:56,919
long code in the url step two we

709
00:16:56,919 --> 00:16:58,899
are actually creating the segment

710
00:16:58,899 --> 00:17:00,460
of people who received that

711
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:01,820
email but didn't open it so all

712
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,289
you want to do is create a segment

713
00:17:03,289 --> 00:17:04,730
with the following conditions

714
00:17:04,818 --> 00:17:06,190
someone has received email at

715
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:07,609
least once over all time where

716
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:10,380
message that's the little uh the

717
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:10,700
metric

718
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:12,180
thing inside of klaviyo that you

719
00:17:12,318 --> 00:17:13,700
want to do where message equals

720
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,380
and then paste your code um so

721
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:16,380
that

722
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:17,859
means someone received it and then

723
00:17:18,009 --> 00:17:19,480
you want to say someone has opened

724
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:21,019
email zero times over all time

725
00:17:21,049 --> 00:17:22,470
where message equals paste that

726
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:23,880
code so this is what it looks like

727
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,420
in klaviyo it received x email

728
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,430
but didn't open someone has done

729
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:29,369
received at least once over all

730
00:17:29,369 --> 00:17:32,299
time where message equals that

731
00:17:32,299 --> 00:17:32,569
code and

732
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:34,099
then it's going to show up the

733
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,890
name of the campaign and they've

734
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:37,319
opened email zero times

735
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:39,849
where message equals that code um

736
00:17:39,849 --> 00:17:41,240
that's all there is so now you

737
00:17:41,299 --> 00:17:42,779
have the list of anybody who

738
00:17:42,779 --> 00:17:43,079
didn't

739
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:44,549
open um then step three just

740
00:17:44,549 --> 00:17:46,369
duplicate the campaign and send to

741
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:48,039
that segment you can duplicate it

742
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:48,170
you

743
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,309
can you could keep the same

744
00:17:49,309 --> 00:17:50,549
subject line in preview text or

745
00:17:50,609 --> 00:17:51,980
you could slightly change it i

746
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:52,130
always

747
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,410
recommend slightly changing it
