1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,740
- Deliverability, you can't make

2
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:03,069
any money

3
00:00:03,299 --> 00:00:05,839
if nobody is actually seeing your

4
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:06,480
emails.

5
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:07,839
So this is one of my most asked

6
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:08,519
about topics,

7
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:09,679
deliverability, how to make sure

8
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:10,589
that you're landing

9
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:11,619
in the inbox and you're not

10
00:00:11,789 --> 00:00:13,660
landing in the spam folder.

11
00:00:13,779 --> 00:00:14,869
Now, obviously we don't wanna be

12
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:15,669
in the spam folder.

13
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:17,320
Now, this is one of my most asked

14
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:17,920
about topics,

15
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:20,589
is deliverability, kinda as I had

16
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,480
gone over,

17
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:23,879
but it's really not that

18
00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:25,000
difficult,

19
00:00:25,059 --> 00:00:25,960
but we're gonna break that in,

20
00:00:26,019 --> 00:00:27,460
I'm gonna make it real easy for

21
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:27,879
you.

22
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:28,769
So results of great

23
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:29,719
deliverability,

24
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:30,949
this is kinda where you wanna be

25
00:00:30,949 --> 00:00:31,239
at.

26
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:32,179
This is how you know you are

27
00:00:32,429 --> 00:00:33,479
landing in the main inbox

28
00:00:33,539 --> 00:00:34,740
if you're sending this to like

29
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:36,079
general engaged segments.

30
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:39,520
61% open rates, 2.79% click rates,

31
00:00:39,579 --> 00:00:40,609
great place to order rates and

32
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:41,630
revenue per recipient.

33
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:43,320
So we recovered the deliverability

34
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,039
of this brand,

35
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,090
like this, and these were the

36
00:00:45,229 --> 00:00:45,609
results.

37
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:47,649
So that's where you can be at if

38
00:00:47,689 --> 00:00:49,000
you're in the right spot.

39
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:50,759
And I hate how complicated many

40
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:51,070
people

41
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:52,880
make deliverability seem.

42
00:00:52,939 --> 00:00:54,140
So it seems like this really

43
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:54,840
daunting topic

44
00:00:54,939 --> 00:00:56,770
and everybody throws out like all

45
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:57,549
of this stuff

46
00:00:57,619 --> 00:00:59,079
with like these crazy terms

47
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:00,200
and S-B-A-B-A-B-A-B-A-B-A.

48
00:01:00,259 --> 00:01:01,219
Like it's just none of it is

49
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:01,880
necessary.

50
00:01:01,939 --> 00:01:03,579
Deliverability is really, really

51
00:01:03,579 --> 00:01:03,920
easy.

52
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,480
And you can, anybody can do it.

53
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,359
Anybody can do it.

54
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:10,239
In most cases, a lot of people are

55
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:10,709
trying to make it seem

56
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:12,159
like you can't do it yourself and

57
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:12,959
then you have to work with them.

58
00:01:13,019 --> 00:01:14,280
But I'm telling you right now that

59
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:14,920
it's super easy

60
00:01:15,019 --> 00:01:16,500
and I'm going to go over why and

61
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:17,069
how to make sure

62
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:18,980
that you're doing deliverability

63
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:19,359
right

64
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:21,030
so that you can have long-term

65
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:21,849
placement.

66
00:01:21,939 --> 00:01:23,680
So what is deliverability?

67
00:01:23,739 --> 00:01:25,200
So inbox providers.

68
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:26,379
So if you think of like Gmail, for

69
00:01:26,409 --> 00:01:26,920
example,

70
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:27,719
they want to improve the

71
00:01:28,109 --> 00:01:28,920
experience of their customers.

72
00:01:29,019 --> 00:01:30,409
Their customers are people who use

73
00:01:30,409 --> 00:01:30,680
Gmail.

74
00:01:30,739 --> 00:01:33,519
And so they want to improve the

75
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:34,159
experience

76
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:35,959
by only showing them emails that

77
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:37,250
the customers want to see.

78
00:01:37,459 --> 00:01:39,400
So what your deliverability is,

79
00:01:39,459 --> 00:01:41,219
is essentially your domain and

80
00:01:41,219 --> 00:01:42,780
IP's like credit score.

81
00:01:42,859 --> 00:01:45,859
So what, like in the eyes of these

82
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,040
inbox providers,

83
00:01:47,099 --> 00:01:48,959
how good of a sender are you?

84
00:01:49,019 --> 00:01:51,010
How much do people open your

85
00:01:51,019 --> 00:01:51,840
emails?

86
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,219
How often are people engaging with

87
00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:53,840
your emails?

88
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:55,140
If you're not getting a lot of

89
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:56,299
engagement on your emails,

90
00:01:56,359 --> 00:01:57,810
then you're going to have bad

91
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:58,760
deliverability

92
00:01:59,019 --> 00:02:01,140
because Google is going to see

93
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:02,000
that and be like,

94
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:03,670
okay, these emails are getting

95
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:03,959
sent,

96
00:02:04,019 --> 00:02:04,930
but people aren't engaging with

97
00:02:04,939 --> 00:02:05,219
them.

98
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,640
This is probably not a reputable

99
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:07,000
sender.

100
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,520
And we're going to give them a bad

101
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,349
credit score.

102
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:10,389
So if you have a good credit

103
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:10,800
score,

104
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:11,819
you're going to land in the

105
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:12,360
primary tab,

106
00:02:12,419 --> 00:02:13,539
which is just like the main inbox,

107
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:14,870
which most of your emails are

108
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:15,530
landing in.

109
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:17,530
And then you also, if you have a

110
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:18,520
bad credit score,

111
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:19,759
you're going to land in spam,

112
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,240
which is down here.

113
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,310
And nobody really goes through

114
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:22,810
their spam,

115
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:23,840
which is unfortunate.

116
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,229
And that's going to destroy your

117
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,000
revenue numbers.

118
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:26,900
If someone in the middle,

119
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,289
you can land in the promotions tab

120
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:29,360
or any of these tabs,

121
00:02:29,419 --> 00:02:30,360
different providers will have

122
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:31,000
different stuff,

123
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:32,539
but you can land in promotions.

124
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:34,280
But obviously we want to be in the

125
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:34,819
green.

126
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,599
So all we need to do to get

127
00:02:36,659 --> 00:02:38,099
in the green is have a good credit

128
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:38,539
score,

129
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:39,840
which I'm going to be going over

130
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,360
with you.

131
00:02:40,419 --> 00:02:41,729
So just think in the eyes of

132
00:02:41,729 --> 00:02:42,300
Google,

133
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,750
I just really want to make it

134
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:44,120
clear

135
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:45,039
that it's really not that

136
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:46,039
difficult and complicated.

137
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:48,580
If you send an email and you get

138
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:49,599
20% open rates,

139
00:02:49,659 --> 00:02:50,900
which a lot of the brands I audit,

140
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,830
they're sending emails and getting

141
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:52,800
20% open rates.

142
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:53,599
And I'm like, oh my goodness.

143
00:02:53,659 --> 00:02:55,400
That means that two out of 10

144
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:55,699
people

145
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,699
are opening your emails.

146
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:58,500
That's what 20% is.

147
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,759
If you didn't know how numbers

148
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:00,099
worked,

149
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,039
20% of people, two out of 10,

150
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:04,219
you think they're going to put you

151
00:03:04,229 --> 00:03:04,879
in the main inbox.

152
00:03:04,939 --> 00:03:05,889
If you're constantly sending

153
00:03:06,069 --> 00:03:07,370
emails and only two people out of

154
00:03:07,409 --> 00:03:08,120
10 are opening them.

155
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:08,919
No.

156
00:03:08,979 --> 00:03:09,860
So what happens?

157
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:11,539
You get 20% open rates.

158
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:13,629
Gmail looks at that and they're

159
00:03:13,629 --> 00:03:13,750
like,

160
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:15,289
hmm, where should we put this

161
00:03:15,289 --> 00:03:15,750
person?

162
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,419
Oh, their reputation goes down.

163
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:19,379
And so that further puts you

164
00:03:19,419 --> 00:03:20,919
inside of like the spam folder

165
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:22,099
promotions tab.

166
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,530
And that continues to give low

167
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:25,409
open rates

168
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,659
because people also aren't seeing

169
00:03:26,669 --> 00:03:27,259
your emails.

170
00:03:27,539 --> 00:03:29,310
Meanwhile, if you have over half

171
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:30,060
the people

172
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,310
who receive your email opening

173
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:33,110
them in solid click rates,

174
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:34,080
Google's going to be like, oh,

175
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:34,639
okay.

176
00:03:34,699 --> 00:03:35,960
People want to receive these

177
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,479
emails.

178
00:03:36,539 --> 00:03:37,789
We can put this into the main

179
00:03:37,789 --> 00:03:38,099
inbox.

180
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:39,409
And then that'll boost your

181
00:03:39,409 --> 00:03:40,169
reputation.

182
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,189
You're landing in the main inbox

183
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:42,379
and this just feeds itself.

184
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:43,860
And so it can be a tough loop if

185
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,360
you're in the middle of it,

186
00:03:45,419 --> 00:03:46,620
but that doesn't mean that it

187
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:47,469
can't be solved.

188
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,650
So what affects deliverability?

189
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:51,580
They're really only two things.

190
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:53,090
First one is super easy, technical

191
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:53,530
setup.

192
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,819
So pretty much just fancy records

193
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:57,300
hosted by your domain provider in

194
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,620
your DNS settings.

195
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,360
So like MX, SPF, DMARC, and DKIM.

196
00:04:01,419 --> 00:04:02,259
Don't worry.

197
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:03,699
I don't know what any of those

198
00:04:03,699 --> 00:04:04,539
mean either.

199
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:06,110
So this isn't meant to like

200
00:04:06,169 --> 00:04:06,919
confuse you

201
00:04:06,979 --> 00:04:08,180
because like I still don't really

202
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,349
understand like what all these

203
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:09,680
are.

204
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:11,099
But essentially, if you have these

205
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:12,439
correctly installed on your

206
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:12,770
domain,

207
00:04:12,979 --> 00:04:14,900
then you're good to go.

208
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,949
All you need to do is have these

209
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:16,699
set up correctly,

210
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:18,420
which you probably already do.

211
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,720
If you don't, you can look it up

212
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,069
on Google

213
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:22,379
or when you sign up with an inbox

214
00:04:22,379 --> 00:04:23,139
provider,

215
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,209
with an email sending provider

216
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:26,209
like Klaviyo,

217
00:04:26,339 --> 00:04:27,339
which I hope you're using.

218
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:28,410
Don't use anything else.

219
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,370
Klaviyo will tell you,

220
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:31,779
oh, you don't have this.

221
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:33,120
So follow this guide to get it

222
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:33,829
installed.

223
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:34,740
Super easy.

224
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,480
Same as a dedicated Klaviyo

225
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,540
sending domain,

226
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,800
which rather than using like a

227
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,730
shared Klaviyo domain,

228
00:04:41,819 --> 00:04:43,660
which again, Klaviyo will let you

229
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:44,459
know like,

230
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:45,939
hey, you're not on a shared,

231
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,610
you're not, you don't have your

232
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:48,060
own domain.

233
00:04:48,259 --> 00:04:48,949
You need to set this up.

234
00:04:49,019 --> 00:04:50,720
So again, that's super easy.

235
00:04:50,779 --> 00:04:52,040
That's technical setup.

236
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:54,000
You set it up once,

237
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,779
it takes 10, 15 minutes,

238
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:56,610
and then you're good to go.

239
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,870
And then number two is send a

240
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:58,579
reputation.

241
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:00,279
That's the other thing that's

242
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:01,040
going to affect your

243
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:01,720
deliverability.

244
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:04,439
So your send a reputation is your

245
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:05,660
quote unquote credit score,

246
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,459
which is a combination of your

247
00:05:07,459 --> 00:05:09,120
email engagement metrics,

248
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,660
like your open rates, click rates,

249
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,399
bounce rates, spam complaints,

250
00:05:12,459 --> 00:05:14,199
all of those combined into like

251
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:16,180
one overall send a reputation.

252
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,860
Now there's not like a database

253
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:18,899
where you can look at your send a

254
00:05:18,899 --> 00:05:19,439
reputation.

255
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,589
You can just look at like how

256
00:05:20,629 --> 00:05:21,910
you're landing in the inbox and

257
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:22,490
whatnot.

258
00:05:22,579 --> 00:05:25,319
So that's like the main thing,

259
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:25,980
your email engagement.

260
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,069
Plus one thing is just proper

261
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:29,439
domain warmup.

262
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,889
So which affects your send a

263
00:05:32,889 --> 00:05:34,319
reputation.

264
00:05:34,379 --> 00:05:36,220
So you can't just like buy a

265
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:38,750
domain on Squarespace or whatever

266
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:39,300
today.

267
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,259
And then tomorrow send emails to

268
00:05:41,269 --> 00:05:43,660
50,000 people at once.

269
00:05:43,939 --> 00:05:45,759
They see that Google sees and it's

270
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,720
like this fresh domain just did

271
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:50,060
all this sending and got poor

272
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:50,500
engagement.

273
00:05:50,579 --> 00:05:51,329
You're going to get like

274
00:05:51,329 --> 00:05:51,959
blacklisted.

275
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:53,720
So there's a proper domain.

276
00:05:53,779 --> 00:05:54,980
Like when you're setting up a new

277
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,550
domain, you have to make sure that

278
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:57,399
it's warmed up.

279
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:00,329
And so which really is not that

280
00:06:00,329 --> 00:06:01,779
difficult.

281
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:03,170
You just start off sending to a

282
00:06:03,209 --> 00:06:04,680
couple hundred people and then

283
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,319
just increase that over time.

284
00:06:06,379 --> 00:06:07,560
Really only takes like a couple

285
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,000
weeks.

286
00:06:08,459 --> 00:06:10,509
If you have automated flow emails,

287
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:12,540
if you just let your flows run for

288
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,490
a couple months, you're going to

289
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:15,500
be properly warmed up.

290
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,560
Because flows will just

291
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:18,100
automatically send to people high

292
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,079
engaging emails.

293
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:20,339
So really not that hard.

294
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:21,389
But we're going to be talking

295
00:06:21,529 --> 00:06:22,410
about all of this in these

296
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:22,959
modules.

297
00:06:23,019 --> 00:06:24,639
Deliverability, super easy.

298
00:06:25,019 --> 00:06:26,350
It's just where you're landing in

299
00:06:26,379 --> 00:06:27,439
the inbox and what is your

300
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:28,040
reputation?

301
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:29,569
Have you proven that people want

302
00:06:29,569 --> 00:06:30,579
to open your emails?

303
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:31,730
If you have, you'll land in the

304
00:06:31,769 --> 00:06:32,319
main inbox.

305
00:06:32,379 --> 00:06:33,600
So that's deliverability.

306
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:34,430
Let's talk about it.

307
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,639
Deliverability.

308
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,759
You can't make any money if nobody

309
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:41,040
is actually seeing your email.

310
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,360
So this is one of my most asked

311
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,149
about topics.

312
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,639
Deliverability, how to make sure

313
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,009
that you're landing in the inbox

314
00:06:46,009 --> 00:06:47,399
and you're not landing in the spam

315
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:48,019
folder.

316
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:49,379
Now, obviously we don't want to be

317
00:06:49,379 --> 00:06:50,339
in the spam folder.

318
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:51,800
Now, this is one of my most asked

319
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,410
about topics is deliverability.

320
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,000
Kind of as I had gone over.

321
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:58,100
But it's really not that

322
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:59,519
difficult.

323
00:06:59,579 --> 00:07:00,759
But we're going to break that in.

324
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:02,250
I'm going to make it real easy for

325
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:02,639
you.

326
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:03,439
So results of great

327
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:04,319
deliverability.

328
00:07:04,379 --> 00:07:05,389
This is kind of where you want to

329
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:05,740
be at.

330
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,829
This is how you know you are

331
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:08,089
landing in the main inbox.

332
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,149
If you're sending this to like

333
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:10,379
general engaged segments.

334
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:12,959
61% open rates, 2.79% click rates,

335
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:14,569
great place to order rates, and

336
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,000
revenue per recipient.

337
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,879
So we recovered the deliverability

338
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:19,319
of this brand like this.

339
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:20,300
And these were the results.

340
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,800
So that's where you can be at if

341
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,199
you're in the right spot.

342
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,139
And I hate how complicated many

343
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:27,459
people make deliverability seem.

344
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,670
So it seems like this really

345
00:07:28,709 --> 00:07:29,500
daunting topic.

346
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,389
And everybody throws out like all

347
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:32,959
of this stuff with like these

348
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:34,389
crazy terms and SPO.

349
00:07:34,459 --> 00:07:35,930
Like it's just none of it is

350
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:36,779
necessary.

351
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:38,420
Deliverability is really, really

352
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:38,779
easy.

353
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:41,310
And you can, anybody can do it.

354
00:07:41,579 --> 00:07:43,160
Anybody can do it.

355
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,470
In most cases, a lot of people are

356
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:45,639
trying to make it seem like you

357
00:07:45,649 --> 00:07:46,720
can't do it yourself.

358
00:07:46,779 --> 00:07:47,490
And then you have to work with

359
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:47,750
them.

360
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:49,230
But I'm telling you right now that

361
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:50,569
it's super easy and I'm going to

362
00:07:50,569 --> 00:07:51,990
go over why and how to make sure

363
00:07:52,069 --> 00:07:53,819
that you're doing deliverability

364
00:07:53,819 --> 00:07:55,110
right so that you can have

365
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:56,500
long-term placement.

366
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,319
So what is deliverability?

367
00:07:58,379 --> 00:07:59,569
So inbox providers, so if you

368
00:07:59,569 --> 00:08:01,060
think of like Gmail, for example,

369
00:08:01,069 --> 00:08:02,069
they want to improve the

370
00:08:02,069 --> 00:08:03,560
experience of their customers.

371
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:04,910
Their customers are people who use

372
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:05,300
Gmail.

373
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:07,769
And so they want to improve the

374
00:08:07,769 --> 00:08:09,660
experience by only showing them

375
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,620
emails that the customers want to

376
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:12,079
see.

377
00:08:12,339 --> 00:08:14,279
So what your deliverability is, is

378
00:08:14,329 --> 00:08:16,199
essentially your domain and IP's

379
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:17,579
like credit score.

380
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:20,009
So what, like in the eyes of these

381
00:08:20,009 --> 00:08:22,290
inbox providers, how good of a

382
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:23,759
sender are you?

383
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:25,810
How much do people open your

384
00:08:25,819 --> 00:08:26,639
emails?

385
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:28,019
How often are people engaging with

386
00:08:28,019 --> 00:08:28,639
your emails?

387
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,009
If you're not getting a lot of

388
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:31,569
engagement on your emails, then

389
00:08:31,569 --> 00:08:32,679
you're going to have bad

390
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,759
deliverability because Google is

391
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:36,798
going to see that and be like,

392
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,070
okay, these emails are getting

393
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:39,429
sent, but people aren't engaging

394
00:08:39,429 --> 00:08:39,889
with them.

395
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,298
This is probably not a reputable

396
00:08:41,298 --> 00:08:41,798
sender.

397
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:43,350
And we're going to give them a bad

398
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:44,059
credit score.

399
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,070
So if you have a good credit

400
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:46,450
score, you're going to land in the

401
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:47,730
primary tab, which is just like

402
00:08:47,789 --> 00:08:49,149
the main inbox, which most of your

403
00:08:49,149 --> 00:08:50,330
emails are landing in.

404
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,039
And then you also, if you have a

405
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:53,950
bad credit score, you're going to

406
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:56,019
land in spam, which is down here.

407
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,029
And nobody really goes through

408
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:58,620
their spam, which is unfortunate.

409
00:08:58,679 --> 00:08:59,899
And that's going to destroy your

410
00:08:59,899 --> 00:09:00,730
revenue numbers.

411
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,129
For someone in the middle, you can

412
00:09:02,129 --> 00:09:03,399
land in the promotions tab or any

413
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:04,129
of these tabs.

414
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,320
Different providers will have

415
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:06,600
different stuff, but you can land

416
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,230
in promotions.

417
00:09:07,379 --> 00:09:09,009
But obviously we want to be in the

418
00:09:09,009 --> 00:09:09,580
green.

419
00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:11,350
So all we need to do to get in the

420
00:09:11,389 --> 00:09:12,980
green is have a good credit score,

421
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:14,419
which I'm going to be going over

422
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:15,139
with you.

423
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,460
So just think in the eyes of

424
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:17,059
Google.

425
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,129
I just really want to make it

426
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,370
clear that it's really not that

427
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:20,730
difficult and complicated.

428
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:22,830
If you send an email and you get

429
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:24,429
20% open rates, which a lot of the

430
00:09:24,429 --> 00:09:25,799
brands I audit, they're sending

431
00:09:25,889 --> 00:09:27,600
emails and getting 20% open rates.

432
00:09:27,659 --> 00:09:28,370
And I'm like, oh my goodness.

433
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,799
That means that two out of 10

434
00:09:29,809 --> 00:09:31,429
people are opening your emails.

435
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,279
That's what 20% is.

436
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,220
If you didn't know how numbers

437
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:34,850
worked.

438
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:37,429
20% of people, two out of 10, you

439
00:09:37,429 --> 00:09:38,700
think they're going to put you in

440
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:39,639
the main inbox if you're

441
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:41,259
constantly sending emails and only

442
00:09:41,259 --> 00:09:42,549
two people out of 10 are opening

443
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:42,919
them.

444
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:43,690
No.

445
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:44,669
So what happens?

446
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:46,340
You get 20% open rates.

447
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:47,980
Gmail looks at that and they're

448
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,659
like, hmm, where should we put

449
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:50,559
this person?

450
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:52,149
Oh, their reputation goes down.

451
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:53,769
And so that further puts you

452
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:55,509
inside of like the spam folder

453
00:09:55,629 --> 00:09:57,610
promotions tab and that continues

454
00:09:57,649 --> 00:09:59,399
to give low open rates because

455
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:01,240
people also aren't seeing your

456
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,039
emails.

457
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,730
Meanwhile, if you have over half

458
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:05,360
the people who receive your email

459
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:07,230
opening them in solid click rates,

460
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:08,850
Google's going to be like, oh,

461
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:09,440
okay.

462
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,750
People want to receive these

463
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:11,259
emails.

464
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,409
We can put this into the main

465
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:12,830
inbox.

466
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:14,190
And then that'll boost your

467
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:14,950
reputation.

468
00:10:15,019 --> 00:10:16,009
You're landing in the main inbox

469
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:17,179
and this just feeds itself.

470
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,529
And so it can be a tough loop if

471
00:10:18,529 --> 00:10:20,000
you're in the middle of it, but

472
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,590
that doesn't mean that it can't be

473
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:22,360
solved.

474
00:10:22,419 --> 00:10:24,470
So what affects deliverability?

475
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:26,379
They're really only two things.

476
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,389
First one is super easy.

477
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:28,330
Technical setup.

478
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,230
So pretty much just fancy records

479
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:32,120
hosted by your domain provider in

480
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,399
your DNS settings.

481
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:36,139
So like MX, SPF, DMARC, and DKIM.

482
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,049
Don't worry.

483
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,500
I don't know what any of those

484
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,340
mean either.

485
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:40,539
So this isn't meant to like

486
00:10:40,549 --> 00:10:42,009
confuse you because like I still

487
00:10:42,019 --> 00:10:43,559
don't really understand like what

488
00:10:43,649 --> 00:10:44,480
all these are.

489
00:10:44,539 --> 00:10:46,350
But essentially, if you have these

490
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:47,830
correctly installed on your

491
00:10:47,909 --> 00:10:49,740
domain, then you're good to go.

492
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:50,990
All you need to do is have these

493
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:52,190
set up correctly, which you

494
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:53,220
probably already do.

495
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,929
If you don't, you can look it up

496
00:10:54,929 --> 00:10:56,700
on Google or when you sign up with

497
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,820
an inbox provider, with an email

498
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:01,080
sending provider like Klaviyo,

499
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,139
which I hope you're using.

500
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,210
Don't use anything else.

501
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:05,220
Klaviyo will tell you, oh, you

502
00:11:05,269 --> 00:11:06,529
don't have this.

503
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:07,909
So follow this guide to get it

504
00:11:07,909 --> 00:11:08,570
installed.

505
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:09,529
Super easy.

506
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,659
Same as a dedicated Klaviyo

507
00:11:11,659 --> 00:11:13,940
sending domain, which rather than

508
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,740
using like a shared Klaviyo

509
00:11:15,879 --> 00:11:17,929
domain, which again, Klaviyo will

510
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,740
let you know like, hey, you're not

511
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,529
on a shared, you're not, you don't

512
00:11:21,539 --> 00:11:22,730
have your own domain.

513
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:23,759
You need to set this up.

514
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,500
So again, that's super easy.

515
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:26,840
That's technical setup.

516
00:11:26,899 --> 00:11:29,149
You set it up once, takes 10, 15

517
00:11:29,149 --> 00:11:30,990
minutes, and then you're good to

518
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:31,399
go.

519
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:32,669
And then number two is send a

520
00:11:32,669 --> 00:11:33,389
reputation.

521
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,159
That's the other thing that's

522
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:35,860
going to affect your

523
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:36,629
deliverability.

524
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,389
So your send a reputation is your

525
00:11:38,389 --> 00:11:40,309
quote unquote credit score, which

526
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:41,940
is a combination of your email

527
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:43,950
engagement metrics, like your open

528
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:46,009
rates, click rates, bounce rates,

529
00:11:46,009 --> 00:11:47,919
spam complaints, all of those

530
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:49,769
combined into like one overall

531
00:11:49,769 --> 00:11:51,120
send a reputation.

532
00:11:51,179 --> 00:11:52,379
Now, there's not like a database

533
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:53,539
where you can look at your send a

534
00:11:53,539 --> 00:11:54,179
reputation.

535
00:11:54,299 --> 00:11:55,389
You can just look at like how

536
00:11:55,429 --> 00:11:56,700
you're landing in the inbox and

537
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:57,269
whatnot.

538
00:11:58,019 --> 00:11:59,440
So that's like the main thing,

539
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,779
your email engagement.

540
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:03,220
Plus one thing is just proper

541
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:04,779
domain warmup.

542
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,549
So which affects your send a

543
00:12:07,549 --> 00:12:09,159
reputation.

544
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:10,919
So you can't just like buy a

545
00:12:10,919 --> 00:12:13,200
domain on Squarespace or whatever

546
00:12:13,259 --> 00:12:15,159
today and then tomorrow send

547
00:12:15,159 --> 00:12:18,440
emails to 50,000 people at once.

548
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,399
They see that Google sees that and

549
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,320
it's like this fresh domain just

550
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,220
did all this sending and got poor

551
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,299
engagement.

552
00:12:25,379 --> 00:12:26,120
You're going to get like

553
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:26,740
blacklisted.

554
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:28,309
So there's a proper domain, like

555
00:12:28,309 --> 00:12:29,610
when you're setting up a new

556
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:31,259
domain, you have to make sure that

557
00:12:31,259 --> 00:12:32,190
it's warmed up.

558
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:35,129
And so which really is not that

559
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:36,580
difficult.

560
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:37,970
You just start off sending to a

561
00:12:38,009 --> 00:12:39,480
couple hundred people and then

562
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,120
just increase that over time.

563
00:12:41,179 --> 00:12:42,360
Really only takes like a couple

564
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:42,799
weeks.

565
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:44,740
If you have automated flow emails,

566
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:46,470
if you just let your flows run for

567
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:48,259
a couple months, you're going to

568
00:12:48,279 --> 00:12:49,870
be properly warmed up because

569
00:12:49,909 --> 00:12:51,840
flows will just automatically send

570
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,879
to people high engaging emails.

571
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,139
So really not that hard.

572
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,360
But we're going to be talking

573
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,440
about all of this in these

574
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,980
modules, deliverability, super

575
00:12:58,980 --> 00:12:59,460
easy.

576
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,019
It's just where you're landing in

577
00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:02,190
the inbox and what is your

578
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:03,000
reputation?

579
00:13:03,059 --> 00:13:04,370
Have you proven that people want

580
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:05,399
to open your emails?

581
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:06,549
If you have, you'll land in the

582
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:07,120
main inbox.

583
00:13:07,179 --> 00:13:08,419
So that's deliverability.

584
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,149
Let's talk about it.
