1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:02,109
So those are the basic use cases

2
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:03,160
now let's talk about the different

3
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:03,720
types of

4
00:00:03,759 --> 00:00:04,960
segmentations and then we'll get

5
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:06,070
into like some actual core

6
00:00:06,129 --> 00:00:06,759
segments that we

7
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:08,779
use so this type of segmentation

8
00:00:08,779 --> 00:00:10,740
of email engagement segmentation

9
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:11,939
so it's

10
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:12,859
great for deliverability and

11
00:00:12,859 --> 00:00:13,859
understanding how your list is

12
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:15,060
responding to your email so we're

13
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:16,320
just creating segments based on

14
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:16,679
somebody's

15
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:18,480
engagement with our emails not

16
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,890
with the store just with our

17
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:21,719
emails so typically

18
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,109
you want to send most your emails

19
00:00:23,219 --> 00:00:24,839
to just the people who are engaged

20
00:00:24,839 --> 00:00:25,440
so don't

21
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:26,609
send to the whole list just send

22
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:28,199
to like your 60-day engaged list

23
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:28,600
which I

24
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:30,480
outline here you can judge

25
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,640
engagement based on opens clicks

26
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:33,359
bounces and more

27
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:34,710
that's typically how you do it so

28
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:35,909
key segments are things like

29
00:00:35,909 --> 00:00:36,479
people who have

30
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,009
opened an email in the past 60

31
00:00:38,009 --> 00:00:39,500
days those are what you call your

32
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:39,960
engaged

33
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,320
profiles this is what you want to

34
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,520
be like your main segment and

35
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,119
again I will be

36
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,570
sharing definitions for all of

37
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:45,759
these like specific Klaviyo

38
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:46,840
definitions in just a

39
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,229
few minutes but that's like your

40
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:49,659
engaged list you have people who

41
00:00:49,729 --> 00:00:50,240
have clicked an

42
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,640
email in the past 60 days that's

43
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:53,380
like your most engaged profiles

44
00:00:53,549 --> 00:00:54,439
you people who

45
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:55,750
have subscribed to email marketing

46
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:57,000
in the past 30 days it's gonna be

47
00:00:57,079 --> 00:00:57,340
like fresh

48
00:00:57,399 --> 00:00:59,090
profiles so you can get a sense of

49
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:00,490
how many people have been joining

50
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:01,119
the list you

51
00:01:01,179 --> 00:01:02,829
people who have bounced at least

52
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:04,519
one email over top all time which

53
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:05,159
a bounce is

54
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,709
essentially if you send an email

55
00:01:06,709 --> 00:01:08,209
to somebody and like the email

56
00:01:08,219 --> 00:01:09,060
isn't

57
00:01:09,099 --> 00:01:10,450
associated with anything anymore

58
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,879
it's like a fake email then it'll

59
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:12,540
result in like a

60
00:01:12,579 --> 00:01:14,650
bounce so that's a high-risk

61
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:17,260
profile we also have people who

62
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:17,939
have marked an

63
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:19,180
email as spam at least once

64
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:20,840
uninterested we want to suppress

65
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:21,659
them and then

66
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:22,709
people haven't opened an email at

67
00:01:22,709 --> 00:01:24,000
least once in the past 120 days

68
00:01:24,069 --> 00:01:24,480
churned

69
00:01:24,519 --> 00:01:26,450
subscribers so if you think about

70
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:28,700
that 120 days is a very very long

71
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:29,420
time and so

72
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:31,420
yeah you don't want to be sending

73
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:32,939
those people that's four months if

74
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:33,239
you've been

75
00:01:33,269 --> 00:01:34,319
sending emails consistently they

76
00:01:34,359 --> 00:01:35,359
haven't opened any in four months

77
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:35,939
they probably

78
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:37,150
don't care so you can put them to

79
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:38,519
like churn subscribers and maybe

80
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:38,840
send them

81
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:40,430
emails like on black friday so

82
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:42,260
that's engagement based

83
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:43,730
segmentation now let's

84
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:44,750
talk about store engagement

85
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,900
segmentation very similar but

86
00:01:47,049 --> 00:01:47,340
instead of talking

87
00:01:47,379 --> 00:01:48,689
about email we're talking about

88
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:50,250
their actual interactions on your

89
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:50,879
store so

90
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,549
somebody could be engaged on your

91
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,040
store but not on your email list

92
00:01:54,189 --> 00:01:54,719
and also the

93
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:56,120
other way around and so this is

94
00:01:56,219 --> 00:01:58,260
store engaged segmentation so you

95
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:59,150
can get a

96
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,510
feel for where people are kind of

97
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:01,819
like being lost in the funnel so

98
00:02:01,819 --> 00:02:02,219
if you see a

99
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:03,140
lot of people have been viewing a

100
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:03,989
product but they haven't been

101
00:02:03,989 --> 00:02:04,739
adding to cart then

102
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:05,900
you know that you might have like

103
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,159
a product problem so these

104
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:07,859
segments and

105
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,050
metrics allow you to track when

106
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:10,439
people are viewing adding to cart

107
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:10,758
making

108
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,439
purchases so some key segments

109
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:13,960
you've people who have viewed a

110
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:14,449
product at least

111
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,699
once in the past 30 days but have

112
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:17,280
not made a purchase during this

113
00:02:17,289 --> 00:02:17,990
time that's

114
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:19,379
like interested customers they've

115
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:20,509
gone on your side a bit but they

116
00:02:20,509 --> 00:02:21,060
just haven't

117
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:23,169
really found the item that they

118
00:02:23,419 --> 00:02:25,030
are ready to move on to make a

119
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:26,110
purchase with so

120
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:27,400
then you have a step further so

121
00:02:27,449 --> 00:02:28,979
people have added a car to start a

122
00:02:28,979 --> 00:02:30,180
checkout in

123
00:02:30,219 --> 00:02:31,259
the past 30 days but they haven't

124
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,099
made a purchase that's high

125
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:32,639
likelihood to

126
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,860
purchase so these are people you

127
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:34,930
really want to make sure that

128
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:36,680
you're engaging you

129
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:38,080
people who place an order which

130
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,360
will be like recent buyers you

131
00:02:39,379 --> 00:02:39,900
have people who

132
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,180
place an order five plus times

133
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:42,360
over all time that's like VIP

134
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:43,379
customers and then you

135
00:02:43,419 --> 00:02:44,740
could do something even as far as

136
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:46,060
like people who viewed at least

137
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:46,289
three

138
00:02:46,419 --> 00:02:47,680
products but like having made a

139
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,199
purchase it's like window shoppers

140
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:49,539
like they're

141
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:50,750
shopping around so that's like

142
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:51,979
store engagement that's kind of

143
00:02:51,979 --> 00:02:52,469
like the stuff

144
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:53,949
that you could do for that you can

145
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,610
also do location segmentation so

146
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:56,090
segmenting

147
00:02:56,139 --> 00:02:57,099
your list based on where they're

148
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,020
at in the world so it's gonna be

149
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:58,500
helpful for

150
00:02:58,539 --> 00:02:59,590
personalized targeted campaigns

151
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:00,620
towards people in different areas

152
00:03:00,909 --> 00:03:01,659
just as like if

153
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:02,650
you have like in-person events

154
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:03,490
like we're putting an email

155
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:04,379
together right now for

156
00:03:04,419 --> 00:03:06,810
client for an in-person event if

157
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:09,060
it's like hey we're in San Diego

158
00:03:09,099 --> 00:03:10,389
California and we're having a

159
00:03:10,389 --> 00:03:11,960
pop-up store you can search people

160
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,289
who are in that

161
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:14,539
city and then send them emails

162
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:16,000
this could also be different for

163
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,139
like compliance if

164
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:18,189
you have compliance email

165
00:03:18,189 --> 00:03:19,250
compliance stuff or different

166
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:20,280
stores for different

167
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:23,129
countries then you can have stuff

168
00:03:23,129 --> 00:03:25,080
custom to them so common segments

169
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:25,560
it's just like

170
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:26,800
segment customers based on like

171
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,069
where your home state is or like

172
00:03:28,069 --> 00:03:28,469
your brand

173
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:29,740
headquarters in case you have

174
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,219
pop-up shops or segment based on

175
00:03:31,219 --> 00:03:32,219
country nothing

176
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,419
really you need to do there and

177
00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:34,729
then we have a little bit advanced

178
00:03:34,729 --> 00:03:35,080
we have

179
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,150
predictive analytics segmentation

180
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,889
so this is a Klaviyo feature which

181
00:03:38,889 --> 00:03:39,120
aren't

182
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,409
perfect but they give you some

183
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:41,759
data to work with and this is like

184
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,939
kind of where I like to get

185
00:03:42,979 --> 00:03:44,870
information about people's lists

186
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:46,780
it just looks at certain customer

187
00:03:46,819 --> 00:03:48,129
behavior to predict certain like

188
00:03:48,129 --> 00:03:49,680
metrics or characteristics so you

189
00:03:49,689 --> 00:03:50,400
can find high

190
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:52,090
spenders who have like AOV

191
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:55,360
calculations so you can so if we

192
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,199
look here in Klaviyo

193
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,439
you can just go to create a

194
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,319
segment predictive analytics about

195
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:00,219
somebody if you go

196
00:04:00,259 --> 00:04:01,939
average order value you can see

197
00:04:01,939 --> 00:04:03,729
how many people are in different

198
00:04:03,729 --> 00:04:04,639
cohorts of like

199
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,460
average order value so say your

200
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:08,300
products your store typically a

201
00:04:08,349 --> 00:04:09,439
$50 average order

202
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:10,629
value you can create a segment of

203
00:04:10,629 --> 00:04:11,870
people whose average order value

204
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,280
is $100 plus and

205
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:14,810
then segment that it's probably

206
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:16,100
maybe you have like a couple

207
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:16,899
thousand people you

208
00:04:16,939 --> 00:04:18,290
could send them like large bundle

209
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:19,600
deals or if you have like a lot of

210
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:19,990
stock that

211
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,350
you want to get rid of you could

212
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:22,759
send them like a massive like hey

213
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:23,959
buy $500 worth of

214
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,199
stuff and you get like 50% off

215
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,540
something like that and they're

216
00:04:26,569 --> 00:04:27,610
much more likely to

217
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,720
purchase so you've like predictive

218
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,579
AOV you find VIP customers with

219
00:04:31,579 --> 00:04:31,930
customer

220
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,230
lifetime value calculations with

221
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:36,079
customer lifetime value value

222
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:37,459
right here you can

223
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,939
do that you could segment and send

224
00:04:39,939 --> 00:04:41,600
timely messages to customers based

225
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:41,949
on like the

226
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,779
average time between purchases so

227
00:04:43,779 --> 00:04:45,339
if you have a cohort where they

228
00:04:45,339 --> 00:04:46,339
usually buy like

229
00:04:46,379 --> 00:04:48,040
45 days in between purchases then

230
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:49,480
you could set up a flow where like

231
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,360
on day 40 you're

232
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:51,560
sending reminders to somebody

233
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,180
right at that time and also like a

234
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,259
big one that we use

235
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,649
a segment based on like gender and

236
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,079
then like send specific products

237
00:04:57,149 --> 00:04:57,680
and emails

238
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,790
based on the gender that they that

239
00:05:00,089 --> 00:05:02,149
Klaviyo believes they are and you

240
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:02,480
can see

241
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:03,660
these are the different options

242
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:04,899
that Klaviyo gives you so you can

243
00:05:04,899 --> 00:05:05,379
take this as

244
00:05:05,459 --> 00:05:05,920
far as you want
