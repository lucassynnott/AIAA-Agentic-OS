1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:02,990
Email marketing optimization let

2
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:04,940
us get into it this is the intro

3
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:06,320
to this new module which will

4
00:00:06,379 --> 00:00:07,929
be pretty quick but we're talking

5
00:00:07,929 --> 00:00:09,470
about how to so we built the bases

6
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:10,539
we have like our base

7
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:12,240
understanding but now let's talk

8
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,890
about how to like take our results

9
00:00:13,929 --> 00:00:16,800
really to the next level so i do

10
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:18,429
want to reiterate 90 of the

11
00:00:18,429 --> 00:00:20,129
results are driven by the basics

12
00:00:20,129 --> 00:00:21,629
what you already know that's

13
00:00:21,629 --> 00:00:22,239
carrying

14
00:00:22,309 --> 00:00:24,489
90 of the load like whoever it's

15
00:00:24,489 --> 00:00:26,429
just trust me the basics having

16
00:00:26,429 --> 00:00:28,070
the basics in place carry

17
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:29,879
everything and so if you're under

18
00:00:29,879 --> 00:00:31,739
like some like really high revenue

19
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:33,520
numbers then really just focus

20
00:00:33,579 --> 00:00:35,049
on that once you get to above like

21
00:00:35,049 --> 00:00:36,710
a mil a month 500k a month or so

22
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:38,479
then it really makes sense to

23
00:00:38,549 --> 00:00:40,170
double down and triple down on the

24
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,259
advanced stuff and the

25
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,060
optimizations and all that stuff

26
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:44,079
but kind

27
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:45,490
of under there really just focus

28
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:46,969
on the basics and testing the crap

29
00:00:46,969 --> 00:00:48,380
out of them um not necessarily

30
00:00:48,469 --> 00:00:49,700
testing the crap out of them but

31
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:51,000
how do we optimize it's like you

32
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,560
hear like all my optimizations do

33
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:54,240
this do that really it's just a b

34
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,100
tests no matter what you think the

35
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,600
numbers don't lie this is what

36
00:00:57,689 --> 00:00:59,130
optimization is just testing

37
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:00,840
testing testing testing a b tests

38
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,159
it's all it is testing one

39
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:03,460
thing versus another thing and

40
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:04,709
then going with whatever wins

41
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:06,000
that's as much as possible and

42
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,549
then apply your learnings that is

43
00:01:07,549 --> 00:01:09,159
the biggest thing testing doesn't

44
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:10,560
matter if you don't apply your

45
00:01:10,629 --> 00:01:12,379
learnings i see that some people

46
00:01:12,379 --> 00:01:14,069
doing the same subject line or

47
00:01:14,069 --> 00:01:16,859
time zone a b test for campaigns

48
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:18,939
every single day for months pick

49
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:20,939
the winner and stick with it and

50
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:22,879
if there isn't any clear winner

51
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:23,120
then you

52
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:24,400
know that you can switch between

53
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,530
the two but that is what we're

54
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:26,760
going to be going over is the

55
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:27,120
highest

56
00:01:27,189 --> 00:01:29,030
leverage a b tests how to set them

57
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:30,769
up and all that good stuff so let

58
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,840
us get into it email marketing

59
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:35,590
optimization let us get into it

60
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:37,129
this is the intro to this new

61
00:01:37,129 --> 00:01:39,120
module which will be pretty quick

62
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:39,359
but

63
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:40,769
we're talking about how to so we

64
00:01:40,769 --> 00:01:42,140
built the bases we have like our

65
00:01:42,219 --> 00:01:43,760
base understanding but now let's

66
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:43,939
talk

67
00:01:44,069 --> 00:01:46,370
about how to like take our results

68
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:48,450
really to the next level so i do

69
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:50,480
want to reiterate 90 of the

70
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:51,120
results

71
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,670
are driven by the basics what you

72
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:54,540
already know that's carrying 90 of

73
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:56,879
the load like whoever it's

74
00:01:56,939 --> 00:01:58,480
just trust me the basics having

75
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,769
the basics in place carry

76
00:01:59,769 --> 00:02:01,599
everything and so if you're under

77
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:01,840
like

78
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,390
some like really high revenue

79
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,120
numbers then really just focus on

80
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,799
that once you get to above like a

81
00:02:06,859 --> 00:02:08,699
mil a month 500k a month or so

82
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:10,219
then it really makes sense to

83
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,569
double down and triple down on the

84
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:13,530
advanced stuff and the

85
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:14,879
optimizations and all that stuff

86
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,800
but kind of under there really

87
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,360
just focus on

88
00:02:17,419 --> 00:02:18,750
the basics and testing the crap

89
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,080
out of them um not necessarily

90
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,659
testing the crap out of them but

91
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:23,139
how do we optimize it's like you

92
00:02:23,139 --> 00:02:24,710
hear like all my optimizations do

93
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:26,509
this do that really it's just a b

94
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,129
tests no matter what you think the

95
00:02:28,129 --> 00:02:29,530
numbers don't lie this is what

96
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:30,969
optimization is just testing

97
00:02:31,069 --> 00:02:31,360
testing

98
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:32,939
testing testing a b tests it's all

99
00:02:32,939 --> 00:02:34,360
it is testing one thing versus

100
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,939
another thing and then going with

101
00:02:36,069 --> 00:02:37,379
whatever wins test as much as

102
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:38,770
possible and then apply your

103
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:40,800
learnings that is the biggest

104
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,080
thing

105
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:42,129
testing doesn't matter if you

106
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:43,270
don't apply your learnings i see

107
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:44,960
that some people doing the same

108
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:47,509
subject line or time zone a b test

109
00:02:47,509 --> 00:02:50,240
for campaigns every single day for

110
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,879
months pick the winner and

111
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:54,069
stick with it and if there isn't

112
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:55,219
any clear winner then you know

113
00:02:55,219 --> 00:02:56,479
that you can switch between the

114
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:56,879
two

115
00:02:56,939 --> 00:02:58,110
but that is what we're going to be

116
00:02:58,259 --> 00:02:59,520
going over is the highest leverage

117
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,719
a b tests how to set

118
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,840
them up and all that good stuff so

119
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,000
let us get into it
