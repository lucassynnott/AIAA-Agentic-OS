1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,529
Okay, so campaign A/B test, what

2
00:00:03,529 --> 00:00:04,879
should we be testing in campaigns,

3
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:05,559
how do we do it,

4
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:06,559
all that good stuff.

5
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:08,119
So, the possibilities for A/B

6
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:09,839
testing are literally endless for

7
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:10,800
your campaigns.

8
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:12,779
You can test anything, and so you

9
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:14,419
should test anything.

10
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,079
Don't just wait for me to hold

11
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:17,920
your hand until you test this,

12
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,440
just test, just test.

13
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,670
It's important to make sure though

14
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:21,859
that you do have the proper volume

15
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:22,559
to know that your

16
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:23,559
results are conclusive.

17
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:25,269
If you send a campaign to 50

18
00:00:25,269 --> 00:00:26,839
people and you have an A/B test

19
00:00:26,899 --> 00:00:28,829
going to 25 and then 25,

20
00:00:28,899 --> 00:00:30,539
it's just not quite enough to like

21
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:31,750
know if your results are

22
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:32,640
conclusive.

23
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,079
You can look up, I don't know if

24
00:00:34,219 --> 00:00:35,640
you remember like algebra class

25
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,200
and stats class, but there's

26
00:00:37,259 --> 00:00:38,409
something known as like

27
00:00:38,409 --> 00:00:40,189
statistically significant where

28
00:00:40,189 --> 00:00:41,880
you can like put in your numbers,

29
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:42,450
whatever

30
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,710
your A/B test is, put it into a

31
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:47,229
calculator and it tells you is the

32
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,060
winner really the winner

33
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,000
or is it just due to chance.

34
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:54,250
So you can use a statistical test

35
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:57,670
thingy for seeing if your results

36
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:57,679
are conclusive.

37
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:59,909
And so, that's something that you

38
00:00:59,909 --> 00:01:01,990
want to make sure that you have in

39
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:03,039
mind is don't just

40
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,299
end A/B tests because you have one

41
00:01:05,299 --> 00:01:07,719
is slightly more than the other.

42
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:08,650
Make sure you look a little bit

43
00:01:08,739 --> 00:01:09,040
deeper.

44
00:01:09,099 --> 00:01:10,250
If you need to send multiple

45
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:11,670
emails to get enough data to make

46
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:12,980
a conclusion, that's fine.

47
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,420
If you're testing sending at 9am

48
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,909
versus 12pm and everything's

49
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:17,400
relatively the same, feel

50
00:01:17,459 --> 00:01:18,670
free to send again and again until

51
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:19,680
you get a clear winner.

52
00:01:19,739 --> 00:01:21,120
If there's no clear winner, cool.

53
00:01:21,219 --> 00:01:22,909
Then you know that 9am or 12pm,

54
00:01:22,909 --> 00:01:24,370
you can use them both because the

55
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:25,519
results are relatively

56
00:01:25,579 --> 00:01:26,310
the same.

57
00:01:26,579 --> 00:01:27,640
Um, and since you can choose

58
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:28,620
anything though, I will

59
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,790
acknowledge that it's hard to

60
00:01:29,859 --> 00:01:30,319
choose.

61
00:01:30,379 --> 00:01:31,200
What do I test?

62
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:32,430
Um, so you want to start off with

63
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:33,810
the highest leverage tests, which

64
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:34,599
is what I'm going to

65
00:01:34,659 --> 00:01:35,439
be sharing with you here.

66
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:36,519
Just super high leverage.

67
00:01:36,579 --> 00:01:37,310
Focus on these.

68
00:01:37,579 --> 00:01:39,420
And then once you have these down

69
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,310
and you have, you have like your

70
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,930
campaign layout and whatnot,

71
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,400
then you can test like the more

72
00:01:44,409 --> 00:01:45,319
advanced stuff.

73
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,540
So moving right along, we have

74
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,719
some initial high leverage A/B

75
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:50,459
tests.

76
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:51,849
Number one is your campaign sends

77
00:01:51,849 --> 00:01:52,239
time.

78
00:01:52,299 --> 00:01:53,680
So, and this is also just happens

79
00:01:53,819 --> 00:01:55,370
to be very high leverage and very,

80
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:56,280
very easy to set up

81
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:57,239
because you don't need to use

82
00:01:57,299 --> 00:01:58,219
different email content.

83
00:01:58,299 --> 00:01:59,829
You can just change the send time.

84
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:00,939
Different lists are going to

85
00:02:00,989 --> 00:02:02,349
respond better at different times

86
00:02:02,349 --> 00:02:02,920
of the day.

87
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:04,030
It's a really important to

88
00:02:04,069 --> 00:02:04,719
understand.

89
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:06,310
Some people like your demographic

90
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:07,459
is like college kids.

91
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:08,900
They might be, um, not checking

92
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:10,240
their stuff like during the

93
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:10,840
morning.

94
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,250
You don't want to send before 10am

95
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:13,319
because people sleep in.

96
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:14,680
Um, but like night they're good,

97
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,990
whereas like some people like old

98
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:16,819
folks, they're better

99
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:18,259
responding at like in the morning.

100
00:02:18,379 --> 00:02:19,629
So you want to make sure that

101
00:02:19,629 --> 00:02:21,389
you're testing, um, good practice

102
00:02:21,389 --> 00:02:22,699
to send at the same time for

103
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:24,280
most of your campaigns so that

104
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:26,199
customers get like accustomed to

105
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:27,629
receiving your emails at

106
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,789
a certain part of the day where

107
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:29,909
it's like part of their lunch

108
00:02:29,909 --> 00:02:31,110
break to check your emails or

109
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:31,909
whatever.

110
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,860
Um, but you want to make sure that

111
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,120
you're mixing it up.

112
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:36,139
You don't just want to send every

113
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:37,080
single time at the same time, mix

114
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:38,060
it up a little bit,

115
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,500
but lean more towards the one that

116
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:40,560
performs the best.

117
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,639
Um, again, some lists will respond

118
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:44,860
better here and there and whatnot.

119
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:46,650
Typically, I found that in most

120
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:49,030
cases, 11am to 12pm is kind of the

121
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:50,199
best because people

122
00:02:50,259 --> 00:02:51,099
are awake.

123
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,509
They can check their emails during

124
00:02:52,509 --> 00:02:53,889
lunch, but you also give somebody

125
00:02:53,889 --> 00:02:54,800
the full day to check

126
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,159
their email.

127
00:02:56,219 --> 00:02:57,509
It's really difficult to get

128
00:02:57,509 --> 00:02:58,900
somebody to open an email from

129
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,120
yesterday just cause it's

130
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:00,909
yesterday.

131
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,120
That's out of the person's mind.

132
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,879
So if we send early enough, like

133
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:05,879
at 11am, somebody goes to bed at

134
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,539
9pm, we have nine

135
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:08,750
hours for the person to open the

136
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:09,979
email app and see our email.

137
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:11,919
Um, that's why like you might get

138
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:13,900
more initial opens at 5pm if you

139
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,340
send an email then, but

140
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,439
you don't give people like the

141
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:17,669
chance to open the email for the

142
00:03:17,669 --> 00:03:18,419
rest of the day.

143
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:20,879
So typically like 11am to 12pm,

144
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,719
1pm is kind of what I find.

145
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,270
Um, the main test times that I

146
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,900
would test for like your normal

147
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:28,020
sends are like 9am, 12pm,

148
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:28,810
2pm, 4pm.

149
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,460
I usually go by like two hour

150
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:31,360
increments.

151
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:33,789
Um, so you can test there, start

152
00:03:33,789 --> 00:03:36,319
at 9am versus 4 and then slowly

153
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,229
like until you find like

154
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,680
the middle that performs the best.

155
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:41,409
So here's like the impact that a

156
00:03:41,409 --> 00:03:43,139
send time could be something as

157
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:44,680
little as 11am versus

158
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,620
1:45pm.

159
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,919
This is like a reminder.

160
00:03:47,979 --> 00:03:49,180
They're both same reminder.

161
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,620
We have a lot of data here.

162
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,560
Look at the increase in open

163
00:03:52,689 --> 00:03:55,449
rates, 48% versus 42% and then

164
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:57,680
click rate as well was higher.

165
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:59,259
And then also placed order rate

166
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:01,180
was higher and the total revenue.

167
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,520
So that is a very big impact.

168
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:05,620
And so now we know, okay, 1:45pm

169
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,439
between 1 to 2pm is better than

170
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:08,860
like 11am before lunch.

171
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:10,740
Also important to keep in mind

172
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:11,840
what day it is.

173
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,550
Sundays are going to be different

174
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:15,120
than like Tuesdays because Sundays

175
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,050
people don't have work

176
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:16,560
or anything.

177
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,000
And so you want to have send times

178
00:04:18,139 --> 00:04:19,560
for the weekend that are kind of

179
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:20,319
your go to and then

180
00:04:20,379 --> 00:04:21,110
also weekdays.

181
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,470
So that's very important to note

182
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:22,939
as well.

183
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,600
Next, very high lever is like

184
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:26,500
graphic based emails versus text

185
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,100
based.

186
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,040
Now you can do like overall style

187
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:31,000
of just like mainly a graphic.

188
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,170
Based email versus one with like a

189
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:32,939
little bit more text.

190
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:33,670
That's something you can do.

191
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,899
You could also do base graphic or

192
00:04:35,899 --> 00:04:38,029
plain text only, which is like

193
00:04:38,029 --> 00:04:39,839
HTML for where it's just

194
00:04:39,899 --> 00:04:40,339
the text.

195
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:42,620
It shows up native in the person's

196
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:43,339
inbox.

197
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:44,100
That's something that you can

198
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:44,339
test.

199
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:45,779
So it's really going to vary

200
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,550
across a lot of accounts and like

201
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:48,959
you're branding on other

202
00:04:49,019 --> 00:04:49,750
platforms.

203
00:04:50,019 --> 00:04:50,959
It's going to depend as well.

204
00:04:51,019 --> 00:04:52,399
So just test, test, test, test the

205
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:53,930
different styles to see what your

206
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:54,980
list performs better

207
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,560
with lots of lifestyle graphics

208
00:04:56,589 --> 00:04:57,920
versus like product style

209
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,639
graphics.

210
00:04:58,699 --> 00:04:59,990
what works best, what gets more

211
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:01,449
clicks, especially for big drops

212
00:05:01,449 --> 00:05:02,019
in sales.

213
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,680
You want to test this?

214
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,579
We find that you want to mix them

215
00:05:05,579 --> 00:05:07,529
up, but use text based for like a

216
00:05:07,529 --> 00:05:08,860
lot of key emails.

217
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,040
When you have a text based email

218
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,269
that's just from the founder and

219
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:12,129
it's like, hey, it's

220
00:05:12,259 --> 00:05:13,639
Max from Well Copy.

221
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:15,420
Um, I wanted to personally reach

222
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:16,829
out and say that this sale is

223
00:05:16,829 --> 00:05:17,339
live.

224
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:19,279
Those usually can perform really

225
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:21,100
well for, um, like big main

226
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:21,860
emails.

227
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,300
But if you send text based emails

228
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:24,699
every single time, then that

229
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:26,290
doesn't have novelty that text

230
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,589
based from me doesn't carry as

231
00:05:27,589 --> 00:05:28,240
much weight.

232
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,740
So I like to do mostly graphic

233
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:31,379
based and then for important key

234
00:05:31,389 --> 00:05:33,100
emails, really make them stand

235
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,439
out by using text based.

236
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,279
This example of like an AB test

237
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:37,970
that we ran on text based way

238
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:40,139
higher, open rates, 42% versus

239
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:42,629
48%, way higher click rates, just

240
00:05:42,629 --> 00:05:44,160
giving people text, not

241
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,379
distracting them with graphics,

242
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:46,480
way

243
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:47,180
higher click rate.

244
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,850
And then look at the revenue as

245
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:51,750
well, way, way higher, um, 13,000

246
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,480
versus 8,000.

247
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:54,829
And so average order value was

248
00:05:54,829 --> 00:05:56,350
down, but that's kind of just due

249
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:57,040
to chance.

250
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,290
Um, they were leading to the same

251
00:05:58,290 --> 00:05:58,670
place.

252
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,759
So text based can really win out

253
00:06:00,769 --> 00:06:02,709
in a lot of these and as like an

254
00:06:02,709 --> 00:06:04,279
overall style test them

255
00:06:04,339 --> 00:06:06,220
both to be like your go-to another

256
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:07,980
high leverage, uh, test is

257
00:06:08,029 --> 00:06:10,000
promoting your categories in

258
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,589
your emails versus your products,

259
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:12,860
like shop hoodie versus shop

260
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:13,399
shirt.

261
00:06:13,459 --> 00:06:14,839
Um, do you promote different

262
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,839
categories to shop hoodies, shirt,

263
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:18,230
pants, or do you actually

264
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:21,149
give them specific, just like try

265
00:06:21,149 --> 00:06:24,220
this, um, this lightweight hoodie

266
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:25,790
and just link to that

267
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:27,230
individual product, uh, same for

268
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,439
like shorts and whatnot.

269
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,879
Some brand customers prefer to

270
00:06:30,019 --> 00:06:31,269
shop by category and some by

271
00:06:31,269 --> 00:06:32,610
individual products.

272
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,060
So test that it's important to mix

273
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:34,560
it up.

274
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,540
Of course, always, always, always,

275
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:38,110
but you can bias one a little bit

276
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:39,579
more, um, especially for

277
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:40,180
important emails.

278
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,050
If like a product or a sale drop

279
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:44,060
email and you want it to do really

280
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:45,560
well and it's, you've

281
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:47,000
proven through your brand that

282
00:06:47,139 --> 00:06:48,810
people like category more than use

283
00:06:48,829 --> 00:06:50,259
categories for your main emails.

284
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:51,649
This is like categories, for

285
00:06:51,649 --> 00:06:53,379
example, winning, um, you can see

286
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:55,300
it had lower opens, but it's

287
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,379
just the email content that we

288
00:06:56,379 --> 00:06:56,740
changed.

289
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,300
And so the opens, that's just due

290
00:06:58,439 --> 00:06:59,860
to variability, but you can see

291
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,420
higher clicks for the categories

292
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,569
and then more revenue.

293
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,819
Now this is relatively low volume.

294
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:06,240
So it's hard to say if it's 100%

295
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:07,620
certainty, this could just be due

296
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:08,259
to chance.

297
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,339
Um, but clicks also being higher

298
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:11,899
tells us something.

299
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:13,259
Um, but this is something that I

300
00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:14,680
probably test a couple more times

301
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,540
just to be sure.

302
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,550
Um, but you can see that it's

303
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,779
definitely like category seems to

304
00:07:17,779 --> 00:07:18,819
be working better there.

305
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,939
And then the easy high leverage

306
00:07:21,019 --> 00:07:23,180
one is subject lines and preview

307
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:23,899
texts.

308
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:25,569
Um, very obvious, but take the

309
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:27,149
learnings or supply to future

310
00:07:27,149 --> 00:07:27,819
emails.

311
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,129
I see people AB testing like every

312
00:07:29,129 --> 00:07:29,949
single campaign.

313
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,420
Just find the layout that works

314
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,060
and kind of stick with that.

315
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:34,509
So here are like some tests that

316
00:07:34,509 --> 00:07:35,660
you can run for sales.

317
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,470
You can do including the discount

318
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:39,500
amount versus not like being like,

319
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,279
uh, warehouse sale, take

320
00:07:41,339 --> 00:07:43,079
$20 off versus just warehouse

321
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:44,750
sale, claim your discount.

322
00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:46,500
And does like the ominous, like

323
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,920
people don't know what the

324
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,860
discount is.

325
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,740
Does that perform better?

326
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,750
Or do people want to know in the

327
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:51,370
subject line?

328
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:52,819
That's something that you can test

329
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:54,459
including or excluding emojis.

330
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:55,899
Um, that's something you can do.

331
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:57,509
Um, using dot, dot, dot, or

332
00:07:57,509 --> 00:07:59,500
excluding like a dot, dot, dot.

333
00:07:59,899 --> 00:08:02,180
Um, adding time delays, um, for

334
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:04,670
certain, um, that's supposed to be

335
00:08:04,769 --> 00:08:05,779
for flows.

336
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:07,860
So ignore that, uh, using all caps

337
00:08:07,939 --> 00:08:08,860
versus not.

338
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,620
So does that harm like your inbox

339
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,139
placement rate for some?

340
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,879
It will, some it won't.

341
00:08:13,939 --> 00:08:15,319
So you can use like all caps

342
00:08:15,459 --> 00:08:17,470
versus not, but really just apply

343
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:19,300
what you, what you find and

344
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:20,819
apply it to like your future, uh,

345
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:22,310
emails, but make sure you mix it

346
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:23,360
up and don't just look

347
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:23,899
at open rates.

348
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:25,160
Look at the revenue, look at

349
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,660
revenue when you're testing your

350
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:27,740
subject lines and preview

351
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:27,980
texts.

352
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,980
That's all we care about.

353
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:30,410
Maybe one has a slightly lower

354
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:31,449
open rate, but it has more

355
00:08:31,449 --> 00:08:31,930
revenue.

356
00:08:32,038 --> 00:08:33,330
Those people who did open, they

357
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:34,730
were more ready to purchase based

358
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:35,860
on the subject line and preview

359
00:08:35,918 --> 00:08:36,139
text.

360
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,460
And all we care about is revenue.

361
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:38,899
That's what we want if we want to

362
00:08:39,038 --> 00:08:39,399
scale.

363
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,570
So these are the high leverage

364
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:41,620
tests that you can do in your

365
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:42,220
campaigns.

366
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:43,658
Again, these aren't the only

367
00:08:43,798 --> 00:08:44,158
tests.

368
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,519
There are literally infinite

369
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:46,350
possible tests.

370
00:08:46,419 --> 00:08:47,659
So test, test, test.

371
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,899
These are just the general ones

372
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:50,139
that are high leverage that you

373
00:08:50,139 --> 00:08:50,940
can start with.

374
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:53,159
Um, possibilities are endless.

375
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,789
So don't just test what I'm

376
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:55,809
telling you.

377
00:08:55,879 --> 00:08:56,360
Test more.

378
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:57,769
Okay.

379
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,600
So campaign AB test, what should

380
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,250
we be testing in campaigns?

381
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:01,960
How do we do it?

382
00:09:02,019 --> 00:09:02,700
All that good stuff.

383
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:04,139
So the possibilities for AB

384
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:05,980
testing are literally endless for

385
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:07,129
your campaigns.

386
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,379
You can test anything.

387
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,320
And so you should test anything.

388
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,529
Don't just wait for me to hold

389
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:13,019
your hand and tell you test this.

390
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:13,870
Just test.

391
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:15,100
Just test.

392
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:16,490
Um, it's important to make sure

393
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,750
though, that you do have the

394
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:18,980
proper volume to know that

395
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:20,080
your results are conclusive.

396
00:09:20,179 --> 00:09:21,700
If you send a campaign to 50

397
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,250
people and you have an AB test

398
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,389
going to 25 and then 25, that's

399
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:27,070
just not quite enough to like know

400
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:28,860
if your results are conclusive.

401
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:30,419
You can look up, I don't know if

402
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,070
you remember like algebra class

403
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:33,789
and stats class, but there's

404
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:35,039
something known as like

405
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:36,799
statistically significant where

406
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:38,629
you can like put in your numbers,

407
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:38,960
whatever

408
00:09:39,019 --> 00:09:41,019
your AB test is, put it into a

409
00:09:41,029 --> 00:09:43,549
calculator and it tells you is, is

410
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:45,220
the winner really the

411
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:46,460
winner or is it just due to

412
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:47,019
chance?

413
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,629
And so you can use a statistical

414
00:09:49,629 --> 00:09:52,730
test thingy, um, for, uh, seeing

415
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:54,899
if your results are conclusive.

416
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,710
And so that's something that you

417
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:58,509
want to make sure that you have in

418
00:09:58,509 --> 00:09:59,730
mind is don't just end

419
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:01,899
AB tests because you have one is

420
00:10:01,899 --> 00:10:04,070
slightly more than the other.

421
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:04,990
Make sure you look a little bit

422
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:05,360
deeper.

423
00:10:05,419 --> 00:10:06,549
If you need to send multiple

424
00:10:06,549 --> 00:10:07,940
emails to get enough data to make

425
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,399
a conclusion, that's fine.

426
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:10,840
If you're testing sending at 9am

427
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,399
versus 12pm and everything's

428
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:13,960
relatively the same, feel

429
00:10:14,019 --> 00:10:15,070
free to send again and again until

430
00:10:15,129 --> 00:10:15,899
you get a clear winner.

431
00:10:16,039 --> 00:10:17,570
If there's no clear winner, cool.

432
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:19,250
Then you know that 9am or 12pm,

433
00:10:19,269 --> 00:10:20,700
you can use them both because the

434
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:21,919
results are relatively

435
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:22,360
the same.

436
00:10:22,419 --> 00:10:23,659
Um, and since you can choose

437
00:10:23,659 --> 00:10:24,809
anything though, I will

438
00:10:24,809 --> 00:10:26,190
acknowledge that it's hard to

439
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:26,779
choose.

440
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,519
What do I test?

441
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:28,779
Um, so you want to start off with

442
00:10:28,779 --> 00:10:30,190
the highest leverage tests, which

443
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,120
is what I'm going to

444
00:10:31,179 --> 00:10:32,360
be sharing with you here.

445
00:10:32,419 --> 00:10:34,059
Just super high leverage, focus on

446
00:10:34,059 --> 00:10:34,559
these.

447
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,230
And then once you have these down

448
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:37,840
and you have, you have like your

449
00:10:37,899 --> 00:10:39,240
campaign layout and whatnot,

450
00:10:39,299 --> 00:10:40,240
then you can test like the more

451
00:10:40,259 --> 00:10:40,870
advanced stuff.

452
00:10:41,659 --> 00:10:43,539
So moving right along, we have

453
00:10:43,669 --> 00:10:45,539
some initial high leverage AB

454
00:10:45,549 --> 00:10:46,240
tests.

455
00:10:46,299 --> 00:10:47,950
Number one is your campaign sends

456
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:48,419
time.

457
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,080
So, and this is also just happens

458
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:51,840
to be very high leverage and very,

459
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,820
very easy to set up

460
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:53,700
because you don't need to use

461
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,639
different email content.

462
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:55,789
You can just change the send time.

463
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,090
Different lists are going to

464
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:58,649
respond better at different times

465
00:10:58,649 --> 00:10:59,299
of the day.

466
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:00,429
It's a really important to

467
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:00,940
understand.

468
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,669
Some people like your demographic

469
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:03,860
is like college kids.

470
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:05,299
They might be, um, not checking

471
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,529
their stuff like during the

472
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:07,139
morning.

473
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,539
You don't want to send before 10am

474
00:11:08,539 --> 00:11:09,580
because people sleep in.

475
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:11,360
Um, but like night they're good.

476
00:11:11,419 --> 00:11:12,509
Whereas like some people like old

477
00:11:12,529 --> 00:11:13,779
folks, they are better responding

478
00:11:13,779 --> 00:11:14,720
at like in the morning.

479
00:11:14,779 --> 00:11:15,409
So you want to make sure that

480
00:11:15,409 --> 00:11:15,919
you're testing.

481
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,860
Um, good practice to send at the

482
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:19,509
same time for most of your

483
00:11:19,509 --> 00:11:21,899
campaigns so that customers get

484
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,379
like accustomed to receiving your

485
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,799
emails at a certain part of the

486
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:25,879
day where it's like part

487
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,090
of their lunch break to check your

488
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:27,970
emails or whatever.

489
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,299
Um, but you want to make sure that

490
00:11:30,299 --> 00:11:31,559
you're mixing it up.

491
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:32,639
You don't just want to send every

492
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:33,740
single time at the same time.

493
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:34,840
Mix it up a little bit, but lean

494
00:11:34,909 --> 00:11:36,080
more towards the one that performs

495
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:36,610
the best.

496
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:38,559
Um, again, some lists will respond

497
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:40,679
better here and there and whatnot.

498
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,570
Typically I found that in most

499
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:45,299
cases, 11am to 12pm is kind of the

500
00:11:45,299 --> 00:11:46,840
best because people are

501
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:47,240
awake.

502
00:11:47,299 --> 00:11:48,679
They can check their emails during

503
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:50,399
lunch, but you also give somebody

504
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,320
the full day to check

505
00:11:51,379 --> 00:11:51,679
their email.

506
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,269
It's really difficult to get

507
00:11:53,289 --> 00:11:54,960
somebody to open an email from

508
00:11:55,019 --> 00:11:56,700
yesterday just because it's

509
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:57,100
yesterday

510
00:11:57,159 --> 00:11:58,379
that's out of the person's mind.

511
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,090
And so if we send early enough,

512
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:02,259
like at 11am, somebody goes to bed

513
00:12:02,259 --> 00:12:04,080
at 9pm, we have nine

514
00:12:04,139 --> 00:12:05,289
hours for the person to open the

515
00:12:05,289 --> 00:12:06,519
email app and see our email.

516
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:08,460
Um, that's why like you might get

517
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:10,440
more initial opens at 5pm if you

518
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,879
send an email then, but

519
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:12,980
you don't give people like the

520
00:12:13,029 --> 00:12:14,210
chance to open the email for the

521
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:14,960
rest of the day.

522
00:12:15,019 --> 00:12:17,509
So typically like 11 to 12, 1pm is

523
00:12:17,509 --> 00:12:18,799
kind of what I find.

524
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,559
Um, the main test times that I

525
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:22,399
would test for like your normal

526
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,419
sense are like 9am, 12pm,

527
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,320
two, four.

528
00:12:25,379 --> 00:12:26,759
I usually go by like two hour

529
00:12:26,899 --> 00:12:27,659
increments.

530
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:30,220
Um, so you can test there, start

531
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:32,919
at 9am versus four and then slowly

532
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:34,779
like until you find like

533
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,840
the middle that performs the best.

534
00:12:36,059 --> 00:12:37,740
So here's like the impact that a

535
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,500
send time could be something as

536
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,129
little as 11am versus

537
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,250
1 45pm.

538
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,159
This is like a reminder.

539
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,480
They're both same reminder.

540
00:12:45,539 --> 00:12:46,840
We have a lot of data here.

541
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:49,139
Look at the increase in open

542
00:12:49,139 --> 00:12:52,159
rates, 48% versus 42%.

543
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:53,480
And then click rate as well was

544
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,019
higher.

545
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,460
And then also placed order rate

546
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,460
was higher and the total revenue.

547
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,980
So that is a very big impact.

548
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,929
And so now we know, okay, 1 45

549
00:13:01,929 --> 00:13:03,690
between 1 to 2pm is better than

550
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:05,399
like 11am before lunch.

551
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:07,289
Also important to keep in mind

552
00:13:07,289 --> 00:13:08,399
what day it is.

553
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:09,840
Sundays are going to be different

554
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:11,399
than like Tuesdays because Sundays

555
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:12,590
people don't have work

556
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:13,039
or anything.

557
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,480
And so you want to have send times

558
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:15,909
for the weekend that are kind of

559
00:13:15,929 --> 00:13:16,860
your go-to and then

560
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:17,649
also weekdays.

561
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,009
So that's very important to note

562
00:13:19,009 --> 00:13:19,480
as well.

563
00:13:19,539 --> 00:13:21,139
Next, very high lever is like

564
00:13:21,139 --> 00:13:23,019
graphic based emails versus text

565
00:13:23,019 --> 00:13:23,600
based.

566
00:13:23,659 --> 00:13:25,490
Now you can do like overall style

567
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:27,169
of just like mainly a graphic

568
00:13:27,169 --> 00:13:28,600
based email versus one

569
00:13:28,659 --> 00:13:29,389
with like a little bit more text.

570
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,139
That's something you could do.

571
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,399
You could also do base graphic or

572
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,559
plain text only, which is like

573
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:36,330
HTML for where it's just

574
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:36,840
the text.

575
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:38,159
It shows up native in the person's

576
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:38,620
inbox.

577
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:40,210
That's something that you can

578
00:13:40,259 --> 00:13:40,700
test.

579
00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:42,279
So it's really going to vary

580
00:13:42,309 --> 00:13:44,200
across a lot of accounts and like

581
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,529
your branding on other

582
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:46,799
platforms, it's going to depend as

583
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:47,000
well.

584
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,850
So just test, test, test, test the

585
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:50,419
different styles to see what your

586
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,539
list performs better

587
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:51,730
with.

588
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:53,299
Lots of lifestyle graphics versus

589
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,860
like product style graphics.

590
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:55,700
What works best?

591
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:56,539
What gets more clicks?

592
00:13:56,679 --> 00:13:58,190
Especially for big drops in sales,

593
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,289
you want to test this.

594
00:13:59,379 --> 00:14:01,519
We find that you want to mix them

595
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:03,750
up, but use text based for like a

596
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:05,279
lot of key emails.

597
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:06,509
When you have a text based email

598
00:14:06,509 --> 00:14:07,779
that's just from the founder and

599
00:14:07,779 --> 00:14:08,700
it's like, hey, it's

600
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:10,059
max from well copy.

601
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,820
I wanted to personally reach out

602
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,639
and say that this sale is live.

603
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,580
Those usually can perform really

604
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:17,740
well for like big main emails.

605
00:14:18,019 --> 00:14:19,399
But if you send text based emails

606
00:14:19,539 --> 00:14:20,860
every single time, then that

607
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,100
doesn't have novelty.

608
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:23,539
That text based from me doesn't

609
00:14:23,539 --> 00:14:24,740
carry as much weight.

610
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:26,179
So I like to do mostly graphic

611
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,929
based and then for important key

612
00:14:27,929 --> 00:14:29,570
emails, really make them stand

613
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:30,919
out by using text based.

614
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:32,360
This example of like an AB test

615
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,840
that we ran on text based.

616
00:14:33,899 --> 00:14:35,279
Way higher open rates.

617
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,460
42% versus 48%.

618
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:39,220
Way higher click rates.

619
00:14:39,539 --> 00:14:40,750
Just giving people text, not

620
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,340
distracting them with graphics.

621
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:43,679
Way higher click rate.

622
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:44,679
And then look at the revenue as

623
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:44,980
well.

624
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:46,919
Way, way higher.

625
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:49,980
13,000 versus 8,000.

626
00:14:50,039 --> 00:14:51,330
And so average order value was

627
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:52,850
down, but that's kind of just due

628
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:53,519
to chance.

629
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:54,759
They were leading to the same

630
00:14:54,759 --> 00:14:55,190
place.

631
00:14:55,259 --> 00:14:57,049
So text based can really win out

632
00:14:57,049 --> 00:14:58,200
in a lot of these.

633
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,200
And as like an overall style, test

634
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:02,240
them both to be like your go-to.

635
00:15:02,299 --> 00:15:03,940
Another high leverage test is

636
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:05,919
promoting your categories in your

637
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:07,659
emails versus your products.

638
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,360
Like shop hoodie versus shop

639
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:09,960
shirt.

640
00:15:10,019 --> 00:15:11,250
Do you promote different

641
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,210
categories to shop hoodies, shirt,

642
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:15,059
pants, or do you actually give

643
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,529
them a specific, just like try

644
00:15:17,529 --> 00:15:20,389
this, this lightweight hoodie and

645
00:15:20,389 --> 00:15:22,779
just link to that individual

646
00:15:22,779 --> 00:15:23,379
product.

647
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:24,840
Same for like shorts and whatnot.

648
00:15:25,019 --> 00:15:26,399
Some brand customers prefer to

649
00:15:26,539 --> 00:15:27,789
shop by category and some by

650
00:15:27,789 --> 00:15:29,129
individual products.

651
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:29,740
So test that.

652
00:15:29,799 --> 00:15:31,129
It's important to mix it up.

653
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,059
Of course, always, always, always,

654
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:34,570
but you can bias one a little bit

655
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:36,120
more, especially for

656
00:15:36,179 --> 00:15:36,700
important emails.

657
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:38,639
If like a product or a sale drop

658
00:15:38,769 --> 00:15:40,899
email and you want it to do really

659
00:15:40,929 --> 00:15:42,299
well and you've proven

660
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,720
through your brand that people

661
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,080
like category more, then use

662
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,740
categories for your main emails.

663
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:47,860
This is like categories, for

664
00:15:47,909 --> 00:15:48,700
example, winning.

665
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:50,539
You can see it had lower opens,

666
00:15:50,539 --> 00:15:52,250
but it's just the email content

667
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:53,379
that we changed.

668
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,750
And so the opens, that's just due

669
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:55,580
to variability.

670
00:15:55,639 --> 00:15:57,019
But you can see higher clicks for

671
00:15:57,159 --> 00:15:58,440
the categories and then more

672
00:15:58,450 --> 00:15:59,049
revenue.

673
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,679
Now, this is relatively low

674
00:16:00,679 --> 00:16:01,340
volume.

675
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,830
So it's hard to say if it's 100%

676
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:04,159
certainty, this could just be due

677
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:04,779
to chance.

678
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,179
But clicks also being higher tells

679
00:16:07,179 --> 00:16:08,379
us something.

680
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,690
But this is something that I'd

681
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:11,169
probably test a couple more times

682
00:16:11,169 --> 00:16:12,039
just to be sure.

683
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:12,970
But you can see that it's

684
00:16:13,059 --> 00:16:14,320
definitely like category seems to

685
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,460
be working better there.

686
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:18,090
And then the easy, high leverage

687
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:19,820
one is subject lines and preview

688
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:20,419
texts.

689
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,860
Very obvious, but take the

690
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,639
learnings or supply to future

691
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:24,340
emails.

692
00:16:24,379 --> 00:16:25,399
I see people A-B testing like

693
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:26,440
every single campaign.

694
00:16:26,539 --> 00:16:27,919
Just find the layout that works

695
00:16:28,059 --> 00:16:29,600
and kind of stick with that.

696
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:30,519
So here are like some tests that

697
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:31,100
you can run.

698
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:33,039
For sales, you can do including

699
00:16:33,169 --> 00:16:35,029
the discount amount versus not

700
00:16:35,029 --> 00:16:37,539
like being like warehouse sale,

701
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:39,600
take $20 off versus just warehouse

702
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,269
sale, claim your discount.

703
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:43,019
And does like the ominous, like

704
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:44,440
people don't know what the

705
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,399
discount is.

706
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:46,250
Does that perform better?

707
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,289
Or do people want to know in the

708
00:16:47,289 --> 00:16:47,919
subject line?

709
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:48,860
That's something that you can

710
00:16:48,929 --> 00:16:49,179
test.

711
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,980
Including or excluding emojis.

712
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:52,419
That's something you can do.

713
00:16:53,139 --> 00:16:54,659
Using dot, dot, dot or excluding

714
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,019
like a dot, dot, dot.

715
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:59,299
Adding time delays for certain.

716
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:01,860
That's supposed to be for flows,

717
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,220
so ignore that.

718
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:05,400
Using all caps versus not.

719
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:07,160
So does that harm like your inbox

720
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,240
placement rate?

721
00:17:08,299 --> 00:17:10,318
For some it will, some it won't.

722
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:11,190
So you can use like all caps

723
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:11,838
versus not.

724
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,210
But really just apply what you

725
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:16,369
find and apply it to like your

726
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:17,809
future emails.

727
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:18,950
But make sure you mix it up and

728
00:17:19,009 --> 00:17:20,180
don't just look at open rates,

729
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:21,119
look at the revenue.

730
00:17:21,598 --> 00:17:22,588
Look at revenue when you're

731
00:17:22,588 --> 00:17:23,779
testing your subject lines and

732
00:17:23,779 --> 00:17:24,500
preview text.

733
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:25,500
That's all we care about.

734
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:26,789
Maybe one has a slightly lower

735
00:17:26,789 --> 00:17:27,920
open rate, but it has more

736
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:28,500
revenue.

737
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:29,759
Those people who did open, they

738
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:31,069
were more ready to purchase based

739
00:17:31,069 --> 00:17:32,369
on the subject line and preview

740
00:17:32,369 --> 00:17:32,670
text.

741
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:34,000
And all we care about is revenue.

742
00:17:34,059 --> 00:17:35,410
That's what we want if we want to

743
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:35,920
scale.

744
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,089
So these are the high leverage

745
00:17:37,109 --> 00:17:38,140
tests that you can do in your

746
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:38,740
campaigns.

747
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:40,180
Again, these aren't the only

748
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:40,680
tests.

749
00:17:40,839 --> 00:17:42,029
They are literally infinite

750
00:17:42,029 --> 00:17:42,880
possible tests.

751
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,200
So test, test, test.

752
00:17:44,259 --> 00:17:45,440
These are just the general ones

753
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,680
that are high leverage that you

754
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,480
can start with.

755
00:17:47,579 --> 00:17:49,700
Possibilities are endless.

756
00:17:50,059 --> 00:17:51,559
So don't just test what I'm

757
00:17:51,579 --> 00:17:52,880
telling you, test more.
