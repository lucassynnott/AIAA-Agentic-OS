1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:01,909
Okay, so we just got finished

2
00:00:01,909 --> 00:00:04,339
talking about campaign A-B tests.

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,599
Flow A-B tests are going to be

4
00:00:05,599 --> 00:00:06,679
very, very similar,

5
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,919
but flows are very important to be

6
00:00:08,919 --> 00:00:09,480
testing

7
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:10,970
because these are always going to

8
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:12,300
be firing out to the customer,

9
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:13,960
and we want to make sure that they

10
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:14,740
are optimized

11
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:15,750
because, again, these are

12
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,079
high-converting important emails,

13
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:18,120
like abandoned cart emails.

14
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:20,879
Same as campaigns, possibilities

15
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:22,079
are endless.

16
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,960
You can literally test anything.

17
00:00:24,019 --> 00:00:25,690
In the same tests that I gave you

18
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:26,660
for campaigns,

19
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:27,780
you can do to flows.

20
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:28,929
So apply those, graphic-based

21
00:00:28,989 --> 00:00:29,820
versus text-based.

22
00:00:30,059 --> 00:00:31,129
That's going to be super key for a

23
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:31,980
lot of your emails.

24
00:00:32,039 --> 00:00:33,399
Like abandoned cart tests like a

25
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:34,880
graphic-based abandoned cart email

26
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:36,299
versus like a text-based and like

27
00:00:36,299 --> 00:00:37,750
the placement of those emails, all

28
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:38,340
that.

29
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:39,759
So everything that I listed about

30
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:41,020
campaigns, A-B tests,

31
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:42,060
can be the same with flows.

32
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:44,759
One of the biggest levers I'd say

33
00:00:44,759 --> 00:00:46,490
easiest to do are flow time

34
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:47,030
delays.

35
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,299
How long do you wait before

36
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:49,340
sending messages,

37
00:00:49,409 --> 00:00:52,020
especially the first email?

38
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:53,500
So after somebody completes an

39
00:00:53,549 --> 00:00:54,020
action,

40
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:55,490
how long are we waiting until we

41
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,219
send them like a site abandoned

42
00:00:57,229 --> 00:00:57,600
email

43
00:00:57,659 --> 00:00:58,960
or a cart abandoned?

44
00:00:59,020 --> 00:00:59,939
How long are we waiting?

45
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,659
And so you can also time delay

46
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:03,159
between your messages,

47
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:04,519
between day one and day two.

48
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:06,150
Should we send the second email

49
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:07,859
same day, eight hours later,

50
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,280
or should we send it 24 hours

51
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:09,760
later?

52
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:11,000
Test, test, test.

53
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:12,420
So like this is an example of

54
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:13,719
waiting 30 minutes

55
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:15,120
versus waiting four hours for the

56
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:15,959
site abandoned.

57
00:01:16,019 --> 00:01:18,000
We have over 1,100 people

58
00:01:18,109 --> 00:01:19,560
receiving both of these,

59
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:20,680
and we have pretty conclusive

60
00:01:20,769 --> 00:01:21,219
evidence here

61
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:23,819
that ordered product is higher,

62
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:25,650
placed order rate and revenue.

63
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:27,579
lower open rate and lower click

64
00:01:27,579 --> 00:01:27,939
rate.

65
00:01:28,019 --> 00:01:29,340
All we care about is revenue

66
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:29,900
though.

67
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:31,939
What we care about is revenue.

68
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:32,879
If we're waiting 30 minutes,

69
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:33,900
it's kind of like too early

70
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:34,810
where the person hasn't thought

71
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:35,430
about it too much.

72
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:36,310
Maybe they'll re-engage,

73
00:01:36,379 --> 00:01:37,359
but they're not ready to buy.

74
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:38,609
And then this just happened to

75
00:01:38,609 --> 00:01:39,400
perform better.

76
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:41,129
It's going to change brand to

77
00:01:41,209 --> 00:01:41,579
brand.

78
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,659
Make sure you test it.

79
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:43,799
This was the one that we ended up

80
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:44,459
going with.

81
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:45,900
So flow time delays,

82
00:01:45,969 --> 00:01:48,400
that first initial time,

83
00:01:48,459 --> 00:01:49,549
and then also your time between

84
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:50,099
messages.

85
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:50,959
Make sure you're testing them

86
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:51,230
both.

87
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:53,420
Especially for flows,

88
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,890
we want to test your longer form

89
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:55,340
content

90
00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:56,420
versus shorter form.

91
00:01:57,219 --> 00:01:58,079
This is going to apply to

92
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:58,629
campaigns,

93
00:01:58,700 --> 00:01:59,939
but especially in flows like your

94
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:00,540
abandonments

95
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:01,579
when people have objections,

96
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,760
you want to see,

97
00:02:02,819 --> 00:02:04,230
do people kind of just need to be

98
00:02:04,269 --> 00:02:05,120
reminded about the product

99
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,159
and we can have a really quick

100
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:06,400
email?

101
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:08,560
Or do we need to really extend the

102
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,159
email,

103
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:10,419
overcome their objections,

104
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,439
and all this good stuff?

105
00:02:11,509 --> 00:02:13,669
Sometimes it makes sense to just

106
00:02:13,669 --> 00:02:14,099
be quick

107
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:15,060
and try to get them to do an

108
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:15,909
impulse purchase.

109
00:02:16,009 --> 00:02:17,750
Other times you want to spend time

110
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:18,629
working through objections.

111
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,439
So this was an abandoned cart

112
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:20,939
email too,

113
00:02:21,009 --> 00:02:22,639
where we did like a really long,

114
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:23,639
longer email.

115
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:25,680
This was a text-based email.

116
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,419
And this was like a thousand

117
00:02:27,419 --> 00:02:27,860
words.

118
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:28,610
And then this one was,

119
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,580
no, not a thousand.

120
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:32,090
This was probably like 300 to 400

121
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:32,819
words.

122
00:02:32,889 --> 00:02:35,180
This one was like a hundred words,

123
00:02:35,229 --> 00:02:35,780
if that.

124
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,860
And this one just performed

125
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:37,250
better.

126
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,560
A lot better.

127
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:39,819
Way higher clicks.

128
00:02:39,889 --> 00:02:41,370
Open rate, I'm not going to

129
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:41,819
attribute to it,

130
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:43,520
but we have over 2,000 people

131
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:44,819
in a way higher place to order

132
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:45,080
rate

133
00:02:45,139 --> 00:02:46,000
and way higher revenue

134
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:47,120
from just being short

135
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:47,629
and just being like,

136
00:02:47,699 --> 00:02:48,620
hey, you left this behind.

137
00:02:49,139 --> 00:02:50,139
Our product is really good.

138
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:50,620
Shop now.

139
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,740
Rather than doing this one,

140
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,099
where it's like,

141
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:52,919
hey, you left this behind.

142
00:02:52,979 --> 00:02:53,819
Our product is really good

143
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:54,629
because of this reason, this

144
00:02:54,629 --> 00:02:55,300
reason, this reason.

145
00:02:55,389 --> 00:02:57,129
The short one just happened to

146
00:02:57,129 --> 00:02:57,819
work in this scenario.

147
00:02:57,879 --> 00:02:59,629
And so test your long form versus

148
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,139
short form.

149
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:00,810
It's going to change.

150
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,860
And then again, same as campaigns.

151
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,979
Graphic versus text-based.

152
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:05,479
Categories versus individual

153
00:03:05,509 --> 00:03:06,159
products.

154
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:07,400
Subject lines and preview text.

155
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:08,870
But the real ones that I want you

156
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:09,319
to focus on

157
00:03:09,379 --> 00:03:10,300
that are the highest leverage

158
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:10,960
right off the bat

159
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:11,979
are your time delays

160
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:13,379
and then also the long form versus

161
00:03:13,379 --> 00:03:14,020
short form.

162
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:16,590
Okay, so we just got finished

163
00:03:16,659 --> 00:03:16,979
talking

164
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:18,639
about campaign A-B tests.

165
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:20,120
Flow A-B tests are going to be

166
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:21,000
very, very similar.

167
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:23,020
But flows are very important to be

168
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:23,840
testing

169
00:03:23,909 --> 00:03:25,419
because these are always going to

170
00:03:25,419 --> 00:03:26,080
be firing out

171
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:26,639
to the customer.

172
00:03:26,699 --> 00:03:28,080
And we want to make sure that they

173
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,080
are optimized

174
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:30,199
because, again, these are

175
00:03:30,289 --> 00:03:31,400
high-converting important emails

176
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:32,439
like abandoned cart emails.

177
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,479
Same as campaigns, possibilities

178
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:36,419
are endless.

179
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:38,300
You can literally test anything.

180
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,039
And the same tests that I gave you

181
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:41,000
for campaigns,

182
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:42,099
you can do to flows.

183
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:42,840
So apply those.

184
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,139
Graphic-based versus text-based.

185
00:03:44,219 --> 00:03:45,560
That's going to be super key for a

186
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,199
lot of your emails.

187
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:47,889
Like abandoned cart tests like a

188
00:03:47,889 --> 00:03:49,219
graphic-based abandoned cart email

189
00:03:49,289 --> 00:03:50,319
versus like a text-based

190
00:03:50,379 --> 00:03:51,400
and like the placement of those

191
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:51,800
emails.

192
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:52,659
All that.

193
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,199
So everything that I listed about

194
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:55,340
campaigns, A-B tests,

195
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,400
can be the same with flows.

196
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:59,099
One of the biggest levers I'd say

197
00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:00,819
easiest to do are flow time

198
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:01,349
delays.

199
00:04:01,419 --> 00:04:02,610
How long do you wait before

200
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:03,680
sending messages?

201
00:04:04,789 --> 00:04:06,340
Especially the first email.

202
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,819
So after somebody completes an

203
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:08,360
action,

204
00:04:08,419 --> 00:04:09,830
how long are we waiting until we

205
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:11,560
send them like a site abandoned

206
00:04:11,569 --> 00:04:11,939
email?

207
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,280
Or a cart abandoned.

208
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:14,259
How long are we waiting?

209
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:16,019
And so you can also time delay

210
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:17,480
between your messages,

211
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:18,860
between day one and day two.

212
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:20,490
Should we send the second email

213
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:22,180
same day, eight hours later?

214
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,600
Or should we send it 24 hours

215
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,079
later?

216
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:25,319
Test, test, test.

217
00:04:25,379 --> 00:04:26,740
So like this is an example of

218
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,060
waiting 30 minutes

219
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,459
versus waiting four hours for the

220
00:04:29,459 --> 00:04:30,279
site abandoned.

221
00:04:30,339 --> 00:04:32,319
We have over 1,100 people

222
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:33,879
receiving both of these

223
00:04:33,939 --> 00:04:35,000
and we have pretty conclusive

224
00:04:35,089 --> 00:04:35,540
evidence here

225
00:04:35,629 --> 00:04:38,160
that ordered product is higher.

226
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,970
Placed order rate and revenue.

227
00:04:40,089 --> 00:04:41,779
Lower open rate and lower click

228
00:04:41,779 --> 00:04:42,279
rate.

229
00:04:42,339 --> 00:04:43,660
All we care about is revenue

230
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:44,240
though.

231
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,279
What we care about is revenue.

232
00:04:46,379 --> 00:04:47,189
If we're waiting 30 minutes,

233
00:04:47,259 --> 00:04:48,240
it's kind of like too early

234
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,139
where the person hasn't thought

235
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:49,709
about it too much.

236
00:04:49,819 --> 00:04:50,839
Maybe they'll re-engage, but

237
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:51,680
they're not ready to buy.

238
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:52,930
And then this just happened to

239
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:53,720
perform better.

240
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,319
It's going to change brand to

241
00:04:55,319 --> 00:04:55,899
brand.

242
00:04:55,959 --> 00:04:56,980
Make sure you test it.

243
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,120
This was the one that we ended up

244
00:04:58,189 --> 00:04:58,779
going with.

245
00:04:58,839 --> 00:05:01,339
So flow time delays, that first

246
00:05:01,339 --> 00:05:02,680
initial time

247
00:05:02,779 --> 00:05:03,870
and then also your time between

248
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:04,439
messages.

249
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,300
Make sure you're testing them

250
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:05,569
both.

251
00:05:05,649 --> 00:05:07,740
Especially for flows,

252
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,209
we want to test your longer form

253
00:05:09,269 --> 00:05:09,660
content

254
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:10,740
versus shorter form.

255
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,209
This is going to apply to

256
00:05:12,259 --> 00:05:12,959
campaigns,

257
00:05:13,019 --> 00:05:14,259
but especially in flows like your

258
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:14,860
abandonments

259
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,899
when people have objections,

260
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:17,079
you want to see,

261
00:05:17,139 --> 00:05:18,550
do people kind of just need to be

262
00:05:18,589 --> 00:05:18,879
reminded

263
00:05:18,939 --> 00:05:19,480
about the product

264
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:20,470
and we can have a really quick

265
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:20,720
email?

266
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:23,019
Or do we need to really extend the

267
00:05:23,019 --> 00:05:23,560
email,

268
00:05:23,629 --> 00:05:24,750
overcome their objections

269
00:05:24,819 --> 00:05:25,750
and all this good stuff?

270
00:05:25,829 --> 00:05:28,009
Sometimes it makes sense to just

271
00:05:28,009 --> 00:05:28,439
be quick

272
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,399
and try to get them to do an

273
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:30,250
impulse purchase.

274
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:32,079
Other times you want to spend time

275
00:05:32,139 --> 00:05:32,949
working through objections.

276
00:05:33,019 --> 00:05:34,649
So this was an abandoned cart

277
00:05:34,649 --> 00:05:35,259
email too

278
00:05:35,329 --> 00:05:36,959
where we did like a really long,

279
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:37,980
longer email.

280
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:40,019
This was a text-based email

281
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:42,180
and this was like 1,000 words

282
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:42,939
and then this one was,

283
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,920
no, not 1,000.

284
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:46,410
This was probably like 300 to 400

285
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:47,139
words.

286
00:05:47,209 --> 00:05:49,720
This one was like 100 words, if

287
00:05:49,779 --> 00:05:50,100
that.

288
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,180
And this one just performed

289
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:51,569
better.

290
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,879
A lot better.

291
00:05:52,939 --> 00:05:54,139
Way higher clicks.

292
00:05:54,209 --> 00:05:55,709
Open rate, I'm not going to

293
00:05:55,709 --> 00:05:56,139
attribute to it,

294
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:57,839
but we have over 2,000 people

295
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:59,240
in a way higher place to order

296
00:05:59,240 --> 00:05:59,420
rate

297
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,319
and way higher revenue

298
00:06:00,379 --> 00:06:01,449
from just being short

299
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:01,959
and just being like,

300
00:06:02,019 --> 00:06:02,939
hey, you left this behind.

301
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,420
Our product is really good.

302
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:04,959
Shop now.

303
00:06:05,019 --> 00:06:06,060
Rather than doing this one

304
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:06,420
where it's like,

305
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,240
hey, you left this behind.

306
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,139
our product is really good

307
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:09,220
because this reason, this reason,

308
00:06:09,259 --> 00:06:09,620
this reason.

309
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:11,459
The short one just happened to

310
00:06:11,459 --> 00:06:12,160
work in this scenario.

311
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:13,970
And so test your long form versus

312
00:06:14,019 --> 00:06:14,459
short form.

313
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:15,129
It's going to change.

314
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,180
And then again, same as campaigns,

315
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:18,300
graphic versus text-based,

316
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:19,879
categories versus individual

317
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:20,490
products,

318
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,740
subject lines and preview text.

319
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,199
But the real ones that I want you

320
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:23,639
to focus on

321
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:24,620
that are the highest leverage

322
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:25,279
right off the bat

323
00:06:25,339 --> 00:06:26,319
are your time delays

324
00:06:26,379 --> 00:06:27,720
and then also the long form versus

325
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,339
short form.
