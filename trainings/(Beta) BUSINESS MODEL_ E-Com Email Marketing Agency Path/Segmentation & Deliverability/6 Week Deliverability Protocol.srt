1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:02,379
Okay, so you might be asking, what

2
00:00:02,379 --> 00:00:04,620
do I do if my open rates are low,

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:05,570
my deliverability

4
00:00:05,639 --> 00:00:06,790
is low, and I want to make sure

5
00:00:06,889 --> 00:00:08,119
I'm landing in the inbox?

6
00:00:08,179 --> 00:00:09,220
That is what I'm going to be

7
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:10,570
sharing with you because a lot of

8
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:11,960
people are in this situation.

9
00:00:12,019 --> 00:00:14,560
Most of the brands that I come on

10
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:17,649
with, pause, they are kind of like

11
00:00:17,649 --> 00:00:20,199
in this situation where

12
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,649
they have lower open rates and

13
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:23,070
they don't really know what to do.

14
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,160
This is what you do.

15
00:00:25,239 --> 00:00:26,800
Okay, so why is engagement low?

16
00:00:26,859 --> 00:00:27,929
Let's assume you have all the

17
00:00:27,929 --> 00:00:29,179
technicalities in place.

18
00:00:29,339 --> 00:00:30,269
You have like your DMARC,

19
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:31,550
everything with your domain that

20
00:00:31,579 --> 00:00:31,910
you need.

21
00:00:32,179 --> 00:00:33,670
If so, there are two possible

22
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:35,329
reasons why you're getting low

23
00:00:35,329 --> 00:00:36,960
open rates, whatever it may be.

24
00:00:37,049 --> 00:00:38,619
Either your emails suck, nobody

25
00:00:38,619 --> 00:00:40,109
wants to open them because you

26
00:00:40,109 --> 00:00:42,039
have terrible content, not

27
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,700
good copy, not engaging design.

28
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:44,710
People don't like your emails, so

29
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:45,740
they're not going to open them.

30
00:00:45,799 --> 00:00:46,840
Two, you have a bad sender

31
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,090
reputation, and a lot of your

32
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:49,420
emails are landing in the spam

33
00:00:49,479 --> 00:00:49,659
folder.

34
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:51,770
Those are the two only possible

35
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:52,609
reasons.

36
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:55,259
So to accomplish reason number

37
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:58,280
one, just make better emails.

38
00:00:58,619 --> 00:00:59,909
If you make good emails, people

39
00:00:59,909 --> 00:01:01,159
enjoy them and continue to open

40
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:02,240
them and help your open

41
00:01:02,299 --> 00:01:02,439
rates.

42
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,900
You have great looking design and

43
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:07,579
copy that gives people dopamine.

44
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,400
Believe it or not, seeing a pretty

45
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,299
looking like piece of art, graphic

46
00:01:11,299 --> 00:01:12,620
design, gives people

47
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,000
dopamine similar to like a funny

48
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,859
Instagram post.

49
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,409
It's just aesthetically pleasing

50
00:01:16,459 --> 00:01:17,129
for people.

51
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,579
They get a dopamine release.

52
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,500
And then just like, I mean, we're

53
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:21,519
all machines.

54
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,049
You get a positive association

55
00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:24,530
with this brand and these colors.

56
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:25,409
And so you get a positive

57
00:01:25,569 --> 00:01:26,120
association.

58
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:27,730
And so anytime that somebody

59
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:29,760
receives that notification from,

60
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,969
hey, this is from this brand, they

61
00:01:31,969 --> 00:01:32,120
have

62
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:33,079
that positive association.

63
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:34,290
Your brain associates that with

64
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,579
dopamine, and then they click on

65
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:36,719
the notification, then they

66
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:36,959
open.

67
00:01:37,579 --> 00:01:38,859
So you get future opens.

68
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,480
So you make better emails, people

69
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:43,879
will start to open all of your

70
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:45,939
emails just because they

71
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,060
get that dopamine release that

72
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:47,620
they crave.

73
00:01:48,099 --> 00:01:50,120
So make better emails, go to the

74
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,140
campaign, the copy and design

75
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,980
sections of this course, study

76
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:56,810
some of the great brands, go to

77
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:58,370
mild.com or really good

78
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:00,599
emails.com, study what they are

79
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:01,349
doing, copy it.

80
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,870
And you'll notice that over time,

81
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,319
if you have better email content,

82
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:05,599
your deliverability and

83
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:06,980
your engagement is going to

84
00:02:06,989 --> 00:02:07,760
skyrocket.

85
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:10,080
So just make better emails to

86
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,830
build up your center reputation.

87
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,599
So if you're getting some 40%

88
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:16,490
opens, then you're likely getting

89
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:18,650
some higher promotions and spam

90
00:02:18,729 --> 00:02:19,659
inbox placement.

91
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:21,340
If you just have lower opens,

92
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:23,150
Gmail is going to look at that and

93
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,740
be like, okay, probably

94
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:26,659
going to send this person, this

95
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:28,680
domain in the spam folder a little

96
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,500
bit more.

97
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,310
So we need to prove to these inbox

98
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:33,000
providers that people like our

99
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:34,620
emails and want to engage

100
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,000
with them.

101
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,180
So that is all we need to do to

102
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,599
boost our center reputation.

103
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,030
And that happens over time.

104
00:02:39,099 --> 00:02:40,580
So we need to prove to them that

105
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:41,639
we're reputable.

106
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:42,620
How do we do that?

107
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,139
Let's boost our opens and clicks

108
00:02:44,139 --> 00:02:45,219
for a period of time.

109
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:47,150
How do we do that?

110
00:02:47,219 --> 00:02:48,960
Let's only send emails to people

111
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,770
who open and click our emails for

112
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:51,939
a period of time.

113
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,639
So it's really just that simple.

114
00:02:53,699 --> 00:02:55,180
We just need to improve our open

115
00:02:55,189 --> 00:02:55,680
rates.

116
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,159
Then Gmail would be like, oh,

117
00:02:57,159 --> 00:02:58,780
they're getting better opens and

118
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,330
this is a reputable person.

119
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,550
People are actually opening this.

120
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,439
Let's put them in the inbox at a

121
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:04,219
higher rate.

122
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,099
So that's really all this is.

123
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:09,020
We are going to boost our opens

124
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,639
and clicks for a period of time by

125
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:11,879
only sending to people

126
00:03:11,939 --> 00:03:12,909
who open and click our emails.

127
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:14,330
Super duper simple.

128
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,259
So what you want to do is you want

129
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:18,530
to create engaged segments of 14

130
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:20,500
day, 30 day, 60 day,

131
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,840
and 90 day variations.

132
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,710
So your most engaged subscribers

133
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:25,189
who have opened an email or

134
00:03:25,189 --> 00:03:27,219
clicked an email in the past 14

135
00:03:27,219 --> 00:03:27,539
days.

136
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,340
That's one segment have the same

137
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,870
segment, but for people who've

138
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:32,580
done that on a 30 day period.

139
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:33,919
So maybe somebody opened an email

140
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:34,689
four weeks ago.

141
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:36,240
They haven't opened one since.

142
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,259
They're in the 30 day engaged.

143
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:38,569
That's a very engaged person.

144
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,270
You have the 60 day engaged and

145
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:42,280
then 90 day engaged as well, which

146
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,150
are slightly less engaged people.

147
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,650
So this is how this looks inside

148
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:47,349
of Klaviyo.

149
00:03:47,419 --> 00:03:49,069
The definition is just somebody

150
00:03:49,069 --> 00:03:50,770
has opened an email at least once

151
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:52,169
in the past 60 days.

152
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:53,530
So this is the engaged 60 day

153
00:03:53,569 --> 00:03:54,060
segment.

154
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,310
It's the same thing for 14,

155
00:03:55,379 --> 00:03:56,629
whatever, whatever it is, it's

156
00:03:56,629 --> 00:03:57,560
going to be the same.

157
00:03:57,699 --> 00:03:59,560
So open email at least once in the

158
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:01,719
past 60 days or clicked an email

159
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:03,580
at least once in the past 60 days.

160
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:04,979
Now you might be wondering, well,

161
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:06,479
if somebody clicked an email, that

162
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:07,889
means that they opened it, which

163
00:04:07,889 --> 00:04:08,389
is true.

164
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,949
But sometimes Klaviyo won't track

165
00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:11,939
the opens.

166
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:14,060
It's just a little flaw.

167
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,280
Open rates are not going to be

168
00:04:15,379 --> 00:04:16,569
perfect, but click rates are

169
00:04:16,569 --> 00:04:18,160
pretty much like very accurate.

170
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:19,930
So you want to make sure that

171
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:22,089
maybe it didn't track somebody's

172
00:04:22,089 --> 00:04:24,170
open, but like they clicked the

173
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:24,860
email.

174
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:26,110
This is just like a little fail

175
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,170
safe to help you out.

176
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,310
You want to make sure that this

177
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:29,339
person is subscribed.

178
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:30,889
You want to make sure that they've

179
00:04:30,939 --> 00:04:32,550
bounced email less than two or one

180
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:33,459
over all time.

181
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:36,560
So very important to have these

182
00:04:36,569 --> 00:04:38,819
and just make sure that like,

183
00:04:38,819 --> 00:04:41,329
yeah, just make sure that this is

184
00:04:41,339 --> 00:04:42,240
all set.

185
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:43,699
So that's really all you need.

186
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:44,720
Make the different variations and

187
00:04:44,779 --> 00:04:45,459
then you're all set.

188
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:46,800
Super simple.

189
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,639
And then this is what like your

190
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:50,629
timeline should be for solving

191
00:04:50,629 --> 00:04:52,680
your spam issue in six weeks.

192
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,310
So weeks one to three.

193
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:57,519
So we just want to create our 14,

194
00:04:57,569 --> 00:05:00,399
30, 60, and 90 day engaged lists.

195
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:02,569
That's what we want to do.

196
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:03,699
So we're struggling with open

197
00:05:03,699 --> 00:05:04,079
rates.

198
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,250
What we're doing, create these

199
00:05:05,259 --> 00:05:05,920
engaged lists.

200
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:07,529
We want to turn off all of our

201
00:05:07,529 --> 00:05:08,160
flows.

202
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,199
If you have a ton of flows, turn

203
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:10,800
them off.

204
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,639
Because we don't know what the

205
00:05:12,649 --> 00:05:14,990
engagement is like on those flows.

206
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:16,170
We want to make sure that during

207
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:17,329
this time, we only want to send

208
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,319
high engaging emails.

209
00:05:18,379 --> 00:05:19,439
And so we don't want all these

210
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:20,139
crazy flows.

211
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:21,699
We just want to turn on the

212
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:23,990
welcome flow, browse abandoned,

213
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,620
cart abandoned, and post purchase.

214
00:05:26,689 --> 00:05:27,970
Because these are the highest

215
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:29,120
engaging email flows.

216
00:05:29,189 --> 00:05:30,889
People engage with these emails at

217
00:05:30,889 --> 00:05:31,660
a high rate.

218
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,779
Like the welcome flow.

219
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:34,389
People are going to that first

220
00:05:34,389 --> 00:05:35,399
welcome email to get their

221
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:35,839
discount.

222
00:05:36,019 --> 00:05:37,370
They engage with that at a high

223
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:37,800
rate.

224
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:38,920
So that gets high engagement.

225
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:39,889
So Google sees that and they're

226
00:05:39,889 --> 00:05:40,790
like, okay, awesome.

227
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:41,579
Boost the reputation.

228
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:42,740
Browse abandoned flow.

229
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,279
That means somebody viewed a

230
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:46,079
product of yours and you send them

231
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:47,920
an email within 30 minutes.

232
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,839
They're very high, highly likely

233
00:05:49,889 --> 00:05:50,519
to engage.

234
00:05:50,779 --> 00:05:51,620
You get good engagement, boost

235
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:52,240
your reputation.

236
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,269
Same with cart and checkout

237
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:53,790
abandoned.

238
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:55,160
Same with post purchase.

239
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,540
People view and click these emails

240
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:57,259
at a high rate.

241
00:05:57,319 --> 00:05:58,730
So we want to keep those on and

242
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:00,660
have those boost our reputation.

243
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:03,069
And then what we want to do is we

244
00:06:03,069 --> 00:06:05,699
want to send engaging campaigns

245
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:08,220
that we're fishing for opens and

246
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,360
clicks three times per week.

247
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,129
Notice how that doesn't say one

248
00:06:13,129 --> 00:06:14,180
time per week.

249
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:15,680
I know you're probably like, oh, I

250
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,990
want to improve my open rates.

251
00:06:17,069 --> 00:06:18,019
I don't want to spam my list.

252
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:18,790
Shush.

253
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:20,300
I've done this not hundreds of

254
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,670
times, but a lot of times in

255
00:06:21,819 --> 00:06:22,839
improving the list.

256
00:06:22,899 --> 00:06:24,889
To improve your reputation, you

257
00:06:24,889 --> 00:06:26,709
need to increase your sending

258
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,939
volume rather than decrease it.

259
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:30,709
Three per week is not a lot.

260
00:06:30,829 --> 00:06:33,240
That's like Sunday, Tuesday, and

261
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,050
Friday.

262
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,199
That's like a cadence that you

263
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:35,720
could do.

264
00:06:35,779 --> 00:06:36,480
That is not a lot.

265
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:37,449
People are receiving a ton of

266
00:06:37,449 --> 00:06:37,839
emails.

267
00:06:37,899 --> 00:06:40,870
People see, on average, 170 e-com

268
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:42,199
brands per day.

269
00:06:42,259 --> 00:06:43,959
This isn't a lot.

270
00:06:44,019 --> 00:06:45,509
But what it is is a healthy

271
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,720
cadence where you're going to get

272
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,639
a lot of reputation by sending

273
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:51,259
three times per week to these

274
00:06:51,259 --> 00:06:52,629
people where you're going to get

275
00:06:52,709 --> 00:06:53,740
over 50% open rates.

276
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,990
And three times per week, you are

277
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:56,300
proving to Google that you are a

278
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,240
reputable sender.

279
00:06:58,259 --> 00:06:58,970
So that's what we're doing in

280
00:06:59,110 --> 00:06:59,819
weeks one through three.

281
00:06:59,889 --> 00:07:02,060
High engaging flows, sending to

282
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,379
our hyper-engaged list, sending

283
00:07:04,379 --> 00:07:06,240
highly engaging emails.

284
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,920
Weeks three through four, at the

285
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,519
back half of the first month.

286
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,459
Once open rates to your 14-day

287
00:07:11,509 --> 00:07:13,240
engage list, our 50% plus

288
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,199
consistently for a couple weeks,

289
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,139
just like three weeks, then you

290
00:07:17,139 --> 00:07:18,790
can expand to like your 30-day

291
00:07:18,829 --> 00:07:19,579
engage list.

292
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,300
Start expanding to your 30-day

293
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,060
engage list.

294
00:07:22,129 --> 00:07:23,550
Maybe turn on a couple of your

295
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:24,410
other flows.

296
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,990
But this has done a lot of the

297
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:28,740
damage.

298
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,850
This has done a lot of the

299
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:30,519
recovery.

300
00:07:30,579 --> 00:07:32,240
And then weeks three through four,

301
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,839
kind of open it up a little bit.

302
00:07:33,899 --> 00:07:35,089
Weeks five through six, open it up

303
00:07:35,149 --> 00:07:35,819
a little bit.

304
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:37,550
So just monitor your opens and

305
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:39,319
slowly open up your list as your

306
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:40,720
engagement goes up.

307
00:07:40,779 --> 00:07:42,990
So you don't want to dip below 40%

308
00:07:43,019 --> 00:07:44,310
to 50% opens.

309
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,410
If you open it up to your 60-day

310
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:48,290
engage list and your open rates go

311
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:50,209
to like 35%, then that's a red

312
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:50,790
flag.

313
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:52,920
Go back to the 30-day engaged or

314
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,389
14-day engaged.

315
00:07:54,459 --> 00:07:55,750
And so we just want to slowly open

316
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:56,319
things up.

317
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:58,029
And then once your 60-day engage

318
00:07:58,029 --> 00:07:59,769
list is seeing 50% opens, you can

319
00:07:59,769 --> 00:08:00,959
just keep expanding.

320
00:08:01,019 --> 00:08:02,180
Just make sure you're staying

321
00:08:02,209 --> 00:08:02,939
above 50.

322
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,680
So just slowly opening things up,

323
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,300
continuing to send three highly

324
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,910
engaged campaigns per week.

325
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:09,800
Usually by week six, you're all

326
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,230
set.

327
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,199
And then you only send to your

328
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,129
90-day engage list.

329
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:13,069
You don't start sending to your

330
00:08:13,069 --> 00:08:13,920
whole email list again.

331
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:14,300
No.

332
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,819
Only send a 90-day engage.

333
00:08:15,889 --> 00:08:17,600
Once a month, you can send a

334
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,769
campaign to your like main list to

335
00:08:19,769 --> 00:08:22,019
try to re-engage past people.

336
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:23,569
But only send a 90-day engage

337
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:24,060
list.

338
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,310
I send, we manage lists with

339
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:28,029
millions of people on it where

340
00:08:28,029 --> 00:08:29,779
we're sending campaigns.

341
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:31,899
We don't, there are like over a

342
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:33,879
million profiles in one of my

343
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:36,320
accounts that we don't send to.

344
00:08:36,379 --> 00:08:37,730
You're probably like, a million

345
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:38,950
profiles, why aren't you sending

346
00:08:39,259 --> 00:08:39,720
to them?

347
00:08:39,788 --> 00:08:40,840
Because it's going to risk our

348
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,460
reputation.

349
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:42,950
And these people have proven that

350
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:44,409
they're not opening emails.

351
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,830
If you think about it, like some

352
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:47,019
of the times we'll send to like

353
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,419
365-day engage,

354
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,399
anybody who's opened an email in

355
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:49,960
the past year.

356
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:52,320
That's a long freaking time to not

357
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:53,580
open an email.

358
00:08:53,779 --> 00:08:55,269
If I'm sending three emails per

359
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,830
week and you haven't opened an

360
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:58,340
email in like nine months,

361
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,090
you probably don't give a crap

362
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:00,820
about me.

363
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:02,220
You either, or you switched your

364
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:03,039
email address.

365
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,419
You don't view this inbox anymore.

366
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,590
I don't want to keep hurting my

367
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:06,980
reputation by sending to you.

368
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:09,110
So only send to your 90-day

369
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,000
engaged.

370
00:09:10,059 --> 00:09:11,720
You can open it up a little bit.

371
00:09:11,779 --> 00:09:13,259
Maybe your 90-day engage list is

372
00:09:13,269 --> 00:09:14,320
getting 60% opens.

373
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:16,799
Expand it to like 120.

374
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,139
And then do that.

375
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,320
Just stay above 50%.

376
00:09:19,379 --> 00:09:20,809
And then just send one campaign

377
00:09:20,809 --> 00:09:21,950
per month to like an expanded

378
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:22,480
list.

379
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:26,899
of like maybe 365-day engaged.

380
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,769
That's completely fine to do once

381
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:30,279
a month and get, you'll get lower

382
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:30,769
engagement.

383
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,639
You'll get 20% to 30% opens.

384
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,159
That's fine to do once a month.

385
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,659
You'll re-engage some profiles and

386
00:09:35,659 --> 00:09:36,789
enter them back into your engaged

387
00:09:37,179 --> 00:09:37,440
list.

388
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,350
So that is the protocol to solving

389
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:40,500
your spam issue.

390
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:42,379
This is a client example to prove

391
00:09:42,379 --> 00:09:43,919
that this is possible.

392
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,370
This brand was seeing 20% to 30%

393
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:46,460
opens on their campaigns.

394
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:48,129
They were constantly landing in

395
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:48,559
spam.

396
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:49,990
Open rates, this is what it was

397
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:50,399
like.

398
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,370
You can see the amount of people

399
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:51,629
here.

400
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:55,360
24%, 29%, 27%, 47%.

401
00:09:55,419 --> 00:09:56,710
But that was like a, they were, it

402
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:57,960
was like a survey or something to

403
00:09:57,970 --> 00:09:59,019
like a tight group.

404
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:01,639
29%, 29%, 29%, 11%, 25%.

405
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:02,590
Very, very bad.

406
00:10:02,659 --> 00:10:03,990
This was frustrating because only

407
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,519
25% of their list was seeing their

408
00:10:05,629 --> 00:10:06,100
messages.

409
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,019
They had over like 100,000 people

410
00:10:08,019 --> 00:10:08,929
that they were sending to.

411
00:10:09,149 --> 00:10:10,539
Super frustrating.

412
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,059
Upon an inspection, they had all

413
00:10:12,059 --> 00:10:13,350
the technicalities set up.

414
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:14,809
This was happening purely due to

415
00:10:14,809 --> 00:10:15,759
their reputation.

416
00:10:16,379 --> 00:10:17,799
All we had to do was improve their

417
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:19,340
reputation and then open the full

418
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:20,440
campaigns back up.

419
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,470
So this was day one when we came

420
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:22,919
in.

421
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,129
Then it's like a day 60.

422
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,850
Open rates, 60%.

423
00:10:28,929 --> 00:10:32,820
With 65, 60,000 people opening the

424
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,870
emails, sending to the same

425
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:35,559
people.

426
00:10:35,659 --> 00:10:37,129
We're sending to the same people,

427
00:10:37,129 --> 00:10:38,980
but now we're getting 60% opens.

428
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:40,539
This is because we improved our

429
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:42,070
reputation and we're no longer

430
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:43,320
landing in the spam folder

431
00:10:43,379 --> 00:10:44,250
to where these people weren't

432
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:44,960
seeing the emails.

433
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:47,059
This was just literally 60 days

434
00:10:47,059 --> 00:10:48,940
later following this protocol that

435
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,330
I gave you in monitoring open

436
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:50,740
rates.

437
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:51,580
And then let's look at the

438
00:10:51,659 --> 00:10:51,990
revenue.

439
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,039
Look at the revenue right here.

440
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:54,799
Five grand, four grand, three

441
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:56,500
grand survey, four grand, two

442
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,100
grand.

443
00:10:57,159 --> 00:10:58,970
Let's look at the revenue here.

444
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:02,620
19 grand, 23 grand, 15, 15, 6, 12,

445
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,789
10, 12.

446
00:11:03,889 --> 00:11:06,129
Massive difference by showing, by

447
00:11:06,129 --> 00:11:08,009
getting more people to look at

448
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:08,940
your emails

449
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,190
and making the emails better

450
00:11:10,259 --> 00:11:11,830
because that's also what we did.

451
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:13,200
So it's really that simple.

452
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:14,409
If you ever have open rate

453
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,379
problems, you just got to play

454
00:11:15,379 --> 00:11:16,230
with your segmentation,

455
00:11:16,299 --> 00:11:18,259
play with different engagements,

456
00:11:18,259 --> 00:11:20,080
and then do that over a period of

457
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:20,379
time,

458
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,129
and then you'll be all set.

459
00:11:21,259 --> 00:11:22,559
Don't overcomplicate it.

460
00:11:22,629 --> 00:11:25,000
Okay, so you might be asking, what

461
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,240
do I do if my open rates are low,

462
00:11:27,299 --> 00:11:28,919
my deliverability is low, and I

463
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:30,139
want to make sure I'm landing in

464
00:11:30,259 --> 00:11:30,740
the inbox?

465
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,169
That is what I'm going to be

466
00:11:32,179 --> 00:11:33,320
sharing with you because a lot of

467
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,580
people are in this situation.

468
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:36,129
Most of the brands that I come on

469
00:11:36,179 --> 00:11:39,980
with, pause, they are kind of like

470
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:41,879
in this situation

471
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:43,649
where they have lower open rates

472
00:11:43,649 --> 00:11:45,490
and they don't really know what to

473
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:45,899
do.

474
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,809
This is what you do.

475
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:49,370
Okay, so why is engagement low?

476
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:50,740
Let's assume you have all the

477
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:51,799
technicalities in place.

478
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:52,820
You have like your DMARC,

479
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,149
everything with your domain that

480
00:11:54,169 --> 00:11:54,740
you need.

481
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:56,269
If so, there are two possible

482
00:11:56,269 --> 00:11:57,850
reasons why you're getting low

483
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:59,580
open rates, whatever it may be.

484
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:01,379
Either your emails suck.

485
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:02,769
Nobody wants to open them because

486
00:12:02,779 --> 00:12:04,039
you have terrible content, not

487
00:12:04,409 --> 00:12:06,340
good copy, not engaging design.

488
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:07,320
People don't like your email, so

489
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,379
they're not going to open them.

490
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,399
Two, you have a bad sender

491
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:10,659
reputation, and a lot of your

492
00:12:10,669 --> 00:12:11,830
emails are landing in the spam

493
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:12,299
folder.

494
00:12:13,049 --> 00:12:14,610
Those are the two only possible

495
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:15,250
reasons.

496
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,889
So, to accomplish reason number

497
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:20,899
one, just make better emails.

498
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,379
If you make good emails, people

499
00:12:22,379 --> 00:12:23,799
will enjoy them and continue to

500
00:12:23,929 --> 00:12:24,820
open them and help your open

501
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:25,059
rates.

502
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,519
You have great looking design and

503
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,200
copy that gives people dopamine.

504
00:12:30,259 --> 00:12:32,120
Believe it or not, seeing a pretty

505
00:12:32,169 --> 00:12:33,700
looking piece of art graphic

506
00:12:33,789 --> 00:12:35,620
design gives people dopamine,

507
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:37,080
similar to like a funny Instagram

508
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:37,460
post.

509
00:12:37,539 --> 00:12:39,029
It's just aesthetically pleasing

510
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:39,750
for people.

511
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,690
They get a dopamine release, and

512
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:43,409
then, just like, I mean, we're all

513
00:12:43,409 --> 00:12:44,139
machines.

514
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,600
You get a positive association

515
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,279
with this brand and these colors,

516
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:48,139
and so you get a positive

517
00:12:48,139 --> 00:12:48,679
association.

518
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,419
And so, anytime that somebody

519
00:12:50,419 --> 00:12:52,519
receives that notification from,

520
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:54,080
hey, this is from this brand,

521
00:12:54,139 --> 00:12:55,029
they have that positive

522
00:12:55,029 --> 00:12:55,700
association.

523
00:12:55,759 --> 00:12:56,789
Your brain associates that with

524
00:12:56,789 --> 00:12:57,919
dopamine, and then they click on

525
00:12:57,919 --> 00:12:59,570
the notification, then they open.

526
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:01,470
So, you get future opens.

527
00:13:01,539 --> 00:13:04,110
So, you make better emails, people

528
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,419
will start to open all of your

529
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,019
emails.

530
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:08,750
Just because they get that

531
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,220
dopamine release that they crave.

532
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:12,399
And so, make better emails.

533
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:14,320
Go to the campaign, the copy and

534
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:16,580
design sections of this course.

535
00:13:16,649 --> 00:13:18,690
Study some of the great brands.

536
00:13:18,759 --> 00:13:20,080
Go to mild.com or

537
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,320
reallygoodemails.com.

538
00:13:22,379 --> 00:13:23,440
Study what they are doing.

539
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,039
Copy it.

540
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,059
And you'll notice that over time,

541
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,340
if you have better email content,

542
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,379
your deliverability and your

543
00:13:28,379 --> 00:13:30,379
engagement is going to skyrocket.

544
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:31,860
So, just make better emails.

545
00:13:31,929 --> 00:13:34,059
Two, build up your sender

546
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,360
reputation.

547
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,279
So, if you're getting sub 40%

548
00:13:37,299 --> 00:13:39,259
opens, then you're likely getting

549
00:13:39,259 --> 00:13:41,019
some higher promotions and spam

550
00:13:41,019 --> 00:13:42,259
inbox placement.

551
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,759
If you just have lower opens,

552
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:45,379
Gmail is going to look at that and

553
00:13:45,379 --> 00:13:47,549
be like, okay, probably going to

554
00:13:47,549 --> 00:13:48,889
send this person,

555
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:50,820
this domain in the spam folder a

556
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:52,139
little bit more.

557
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,759
So, we need to prove to these

558
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:55,350
inbox providers that people like

559
00:13:55,429 --> 00:13:57,000
our emails and want to engage with

560
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,600
them.

561
00:13:57,659 --> 00:13:58,820
So, that is all we need to do to

562
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:00,200
boost our sender reputation.

563
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,639
And that happens over time.

564
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,419
So, we need to prove to them that

565
00:14:03,419 --> 00:14:04,379
we're reputable.

566
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,240
How do we do that?

567
00:14:05,299 --> 00:14:06,759
Let's boost our opens and clicks

568
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:07,840
for a period of time.

569
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:09,750
How do we do that?

570
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,580
Let's only send emails to people

571
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:13,399
who open and click our emails for

572
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:14,559
a period of time.

573
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,259
So, it's really just that simple.

574
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,750
We just need to improve our open

575
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:18,279
rates.

576
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,700
Then Gmail will be like, oh,

577
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,320
they're getting better opens and

578
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,929
this is a reputable person.

579
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,149
People are actually opening this.

580
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,059
Let's put them in the inbox at a

581
00:14:26,059 --> 00:14:26,840
higher rate.

582
00:14:27,179 --> 00:14:29,720
So, that's really all this is.

583
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,070
So, we are going to boost our

584
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,389
opens and clicks for a period of

585
00:14:32,779 --> 00:14:34,600
time by only sending to people who

586
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:35,480
open and click our emails.

587
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:36,929
Super duper simple.

588
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,480
So, what you want to do is you

589
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:40,370
want to create engaged segments of

590
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:43,509
14-day, 30-day, 60-day, and 90-day

591
00:14:43,509 --> 00:14:44,440
variations.

592
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,360
So, your most engaged subscribers

593
00:14:46,409 --> 00:14:47,809
who have opened an email or

594
00:14:47,809 --> 00:14:49,679
clicked an email in the past 14

595
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:51,299
days, that's one segment,

596
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,669
have the same segment but for

597
00:14:52,669 --> 00:14:54,029
people who have done that on a

598
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,179
30-day period.

599
00:14:55,259 --> 00:14:56,580
So, maybe somebody opened an email

600
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:57,309
four weeks ago.

601
00:14:57,379 --> 00:14:58,860
They haven't opened one since.

602
00:14:59,080 --> 00:14:59,940
They're in the 30-day engaged.

603
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,190
That's a very engaged person.

604
00:15:01,299 --> 00:15:02,940
You have the 60-day engaged and

605
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,870
then 90-day engaged as well, which

606
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:06,769
are slightly less engaged people.

607
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,980
So, this is how this looks inside

608
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:09,980
of Klaviyo.

609
00:15:10,039 --> 00:15:11,690
The definition is just somebody

610
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:13,389
has opened an email at least once

611
00:15:13,389 --> 00:15:14,789
in the past 60 days.

612
00:15:14,919 --> 00:15:16,190
So, this is the engaged 60-day

613
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:16,679
segment.

614
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,490
It's the same thing for 14,

615
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:19,309
whatever it is.

616
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:20,230
It's going to be the same.

617
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:22,450
So, opened an email at least once

618
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:24,320
in the past 60 days or clicked an

619
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,950
email at least once in the past 60

620
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:26,200
days.

621
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:27,669
Now, you might be wondering, well,

622
00:15:27,669 --> 00:15:28,860
if somebody clicked an email, that

623
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,500
means that they opened it, which

624
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,009
is true.

625
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,620
But sometimes Klaviyo won't track

626
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:34,600
the opens.

627
00:15:34,659 --> 00:15:36,679
It's just a little flaw.

628
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:37,860
Open rates are not going to be

629
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:39,070
perfect, but click rates are

630
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:40,779
pretty much, like, very accurate.

631
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,580
So, you want to make sure that

632
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:44,590
maybe it didn't track somebody's

633
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:46,830
open, but, like, they clicked the

634
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:47,480
email.

635
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:48,690
This is just, like, a little

636
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,799
fail-safe to help you out.

637
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:50,919
You want to make sure that this

638
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:51,929
person is subscribed.

639
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,490
You want to make sure that they've

640
00:15:53,539 --> 00:15:55,149
bounced email less than two or one

641
00:15:55,149 --> 00:15:56,080
over all time.

642
00:15:56,139 --> 00:15:58,700
So, very important to have these

643
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,289
and just make sure that, like,

644
00:16:01,289 --> 00:16:03,950
yeah, just make sure that this is

645
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:04,879
all set.

646
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:06,320
So, that's really all you need.

647
00:16:06,379 --> 00:16:07,340
Make the different variations and

648
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:08,080
then you're all set.

649
00:16:08,139 --> 00:16:09,419
Super simple.

650
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,500
And then this is what, like, your

651
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,360
timeline should be for solving

652
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,299
your spam issue in six weeks.

653
00:16:15,899 --> 00:16:18,220
So, weeks one to three.

654
00:16:18,279 --> 00:16:20,220
So, we just want to create our 14,

655
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:23,000
30, 60, and 90-day engaged lists.

656
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:25,169
That's what we want to do.

657
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,320
So, we're struggling with open

658
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:26,700
rates.

659
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:27,840
What we're doing, create these

660
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,529
engaged lists.

661
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,149
We want to turn off all of our

662
00:16:30,149 --> 00:16:30,779
flows.

663
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,820
If you have a ton of flows, turn

664
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,750
them off because we don't know

665
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,600
what the engagement is like on

666
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,620
those flows.

667
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:38,789
We want to make sure that during

668
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:39,950
this time, we only want to send

669
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:40,960
high-engaging emails.

670
00:16:41,019 --> 00:16:42,120
And so, we don't want all these

671
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:42,759
crazy flows.

672
00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:44,759
We just want to turn on the

673
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:47,269
welcome flow, browse abandon, cart

674
00:16:47,309 --> 00:16:49,700
abandon, and post-purchase because

675
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,029
these are the highest engaging

676
00:16:51,029 --> 00:16:51,720
email flows.

677
00:16:51,809 --> 00:16:53,509
People engage with these emails at

678
00:16:53,509 --> 00:16:54,279
a high rate.

679
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:55,419
Like, the welcome flow.

680
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:56,750
People are going to that first

681
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:57,929
welcome email to get their

682
00:16:57,929 --> 00:16:58,580
discount.

683
00:16:58,639 --> 00:16:59,990
They engage with that at a high

684
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,419
rate.

685
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:01,539
So, that gets high engagement.

686
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,559
So, Google sees that and they're

687
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:03,409
like, okay, awesome.

688
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,180
Boost their reputation.

689
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,338
Browse abandon flow.

690
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,848
That means somebody viewed a

691
00:17:06,848 --> 00:17:08,598
product of yours and you send them

692
00:17:08,598 --> 00:17:10,519
an email within 30 minutes.

693
00:17:10,578 --> 00:17:12,430
They're very high, highly likely

694
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:13,119
to engage.

695
00:17:13,259 --> 00:17:14,059
You get good engagement.

696
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:14,838
Boost your reputation.

697
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:15,930
Same with cart and checkout

698
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:16,390
abandon.

699
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,809
Same with post-purchase.

700
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:19,170
People view and click these emails

701
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:19,880
at a high rate.

702
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:21,430
So, we want to keep those on and

703
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,279
have those boost our reputation.

704
00:17:24,338 --> 00:17:26,309
And then what we want to do is we

705
00:17:26,309 --> 00:17:28,480
want to send engaging campaigns

706
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:30,720
that we're fishing for opens and

707
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,960
clicks three times per week.

708
00:17:33,019 --> 00:17:34,599
Three times per week.

709
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:35,980
Notice how that doesn't say one

710
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:36,799
time per week.

711
00:17:36,849 --> 00:17:38,299
I know you're probably like, oh, I

712
00:17:38,299 --> 00:17:39,609
want to improve my open rates.

713
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:40,640
I don't want to spam my list.

714
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:41,400
Shush.

715
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:43,109
I've done this, not hundreds of

716
00:17:43,109 --> 00:17:44,259
times, but a lot of times in

717
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:45,460
improving the list.

718
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:47,509
To improve your reputation, you

719
00:17:47,509 --> 00:17:49,329
need to increase your sending

720
00:17:49,369 --> 00:17:51,559
volume rather than decrease it.

721
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:53,390
Three per week is not a lot.

722
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:55,880
That's like Sunday, Tuesday, and

723
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,690
Friday.

724
00:17:56,759 --> 00:17:57,829
That's like a cadence that you

725
00:17:57,829 --> 00:17:58,339
could do.

726
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,109
That is not a lot.

727
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:00,079
People are receiving a ton of

728
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:00,460
emails.

729
00:18:00,519 --> 00:18:03,490
People see, on average, 170 e-com

730
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:04,819
brands per day.

731
00:18:05,589 --> 00:18:07,549
This isn't a lot, but what it is,

732
00:18:07,549 --> 00:18:09,619
is a healthy cadence where you're

733
00:18:09,619 --> 00:18:11,660
going to get a lot of reputation

734
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:13,500
by sending three times per week to

735
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,109
these people where you're going to

736
00:18:15,109 --> 00:18:16,380
get over 50% open rates.

737
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,630
And three times per week, you are

738
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:18,940
proving to Google that you are a

739
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:19,880
reputable sender.

740
00:18:20,019 --> 00:18:21,210
So, that's what we're doing in

741
00:18:21,269 --> 00:18:22,440
weeks one through three.

742
00:18:22,509 --> 00:18:24,680
High engaging flows, sending to

743
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:27,000
our hyper-engaged list, sending

744
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,880
highly engaging emails.

745
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:30,559
Weeks three through four, at the

746
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:32,150
back half of the first month.

747
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:34,319
Once open rates to your 14-day

748
00:18:34,369 --> 00:18:35,900
engage list, or 50% plus

749
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:37,920
consistently for a couple weeks,

750
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,779
just like three weeks, then you

751
00:18:39,779 --> 00:18:41,369
can expand to like your 30-day

752
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:42,299
engage list.

753
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:43,930
Start expanding to your 30-day

754
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:44,680
engage list.

755
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,180
Maybe turn on a couple of your

756
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:47,059
other flows.

757
00:18:47,119 --> 00:18:50,109
But this has done a lot of the

758
00:18:50,109 --> 00:18:51,359
damage.

759
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:52,380
This has done a lot of the

760
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,099
recovery.

761
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,819
And then weeks three through four,

762
00:18:54,819 --> 00:18:56,440
kind of open it up a little bit.

763
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,789
Weeks five through six, open it up

764
00:18:57,789 --> 00:18:58,460
a little bit.

765
00:18:58,519 --> 00:19:00,259
So, just monitor your opens and

766
00:19:00,259 --> 00:19:01,960
slowly open up your list as your

767
00:19:02,049 --> 00:19:03,269
engagement goes up.

768
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,160
So, you don't want to dip below

769
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,930
40- to 50% opens.

770
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,859
If you open it up to your 60-day

771
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:10,759
engage list and your open rates go

772
00:19:10,759 --> 00:19:12,660
to like 35%, then that's a red

773
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:13,420
flag.

774
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,539
Go back to the 30-day engaged or

775
00:19:15,539 --> 00:19:17,039
14-day engaged.

776
00:19:17,099 --> 00:19:18,289
So, we just want to slowly open

777
00:19:18,359 --> 00:19:18,950
things up.

778
00:19:19,019 --> 00:19:20,630
And then once your 60-day engage

779
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:22,230
list is seeing 50% open, so you

780
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:23,579
can just keep expanding.

781
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,009
Just make sure you're staying

782
00:19:25,009 --> 00:19:25,700
above 50%.

783
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:27,440
So, just slowly opening things up,

784
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,960
continuing to send three highly

785
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,509
engaged campaigns per week.

786
00:19:30,579 --> 00:19:32,430
Usually, by week six, you're all

787
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:32,849
set.

788
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:33,819
And then you only send to your

789
00:19:33,819 --> 00:19:34,750
90-day engage list.

790
00:19:34,819 --> 00:19:35,690
You don't start sending to your

791
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:36,539
whole email list again.

792
00:19:36,599 --> 00:19:36,940
No.

793
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,460
Only send a 90-day engage.

794
00:19:38,529 --> 00:19:40,339
Once a month, you can send a

795
00:19:40,339 --> 00:19:42,569
campaign to your main list to try

796
00:19:42,569 --> 00:19:44,640
to re-engage past people.

797
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,190
But only send a 90-day engage

798
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:46,680
list.

799
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:48,940
I send, we manage lists with

800
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:50,630
millions of people on it where

801
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:52,400
we're sending campaigns.

802
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:54,519
We don't, there are like over a

803
00:19:54,529 --> 00:19:56,500
million profiles in one of my

804
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,940
accounts that we don't send to.

805
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,190
You're probably like, a million

806
00:20:00,259 --> 00:20:01,539
profiles, why aren't you sending

807
00:20:01,609 --> 00:20:02,339
them to them?

808
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:03,460
Because it's going to risk our

809
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:04,079
reputation.

810
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:05,569
And these people have proven that

811
00:20:05,569 --> 00:20:07,029
they're not opening emails.

812
00:20:07,099 --> 00:20:08,450
If you think about it, like some

813
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:09,640
of the times we'll send to like

814
00:20:10,059 --> 00:20:11,039
365-day engage.

815
00:20:11,099 --> 00:20:12,019
Anybody who's opened an email in

816
00:20:12,019 --> 00:20:12,579
the past year.

817
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:14,940
That's a long freaking time to not

818
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:16,200
open an email.

819
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:17,910
If I'm sending three emails per

820
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,470
week and you haven't opened an

821
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:20,960
email in like nine months,

822
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:22,710
you probably don't give a crap

823
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:23,440
about me.

824
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,839
You either, or you switched your

825
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:25,660
email address.

826
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,039
You don't view this inbox anymore.

827
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:28,210
I don't want to keep hurting my

828
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:29,579
reputation by sending to you.

829
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,779
So, only send to your 90-day

830
00:20:31,779 --> 00:20:32,619
engaged.

831
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,339
You can open it up a little bit.

832
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,880
Maybe your 90-day engage list is

833
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:36,940
getting 60% opens.

834
00:20:37,079 --> 00:20:39,420
Expand it to like 120.

835
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,759
And then do that.

836
00:20:40,819 --> 00:20:41,940
Just stay above 50%.

837
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,430
And then just send one campaign

838
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:45,079
per month to like an expanded list

839
00:20:45,079 --> 00:20:49,519
of like maybe 365-day engaged.

840
00:20:49,579 --> 00:20:51,390
That's completely fine to do once

841
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:52,910
a month and get, you'll get lower

842
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:53,390
engagement.

843
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,259
You'll get 20-30% opens.

844
00:20:55,339 --> 00:20:56,779
That's fine to do once a month.

845
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:58,279
You'll re-engage some profiles and

846
00:20:58,279 --> 00:20:59,410
enter them back into your engaged

847
00:20:59,799 --> 00:21:00,059
list.

848
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:01,650
So, that is the protocol to

849
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,000
solving your spam issue.

850
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:05,019
This is a client example to prove

851
00:21:05,019 --> 00:21:06,539
that this is possible.

852
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:08,180
This brand was seeing 20-30% opens

853
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:09,079
on their campaigns.

854
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:10,720
They were constantly landing in

855
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,170
spam.

856
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,619
Open rates, this is what it was

857
00:21:12,619 --> 00:21:13,049
like.

858
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:14,009
You can see the amount of people

859
00:21:14,009 --> 00:21:14,269
here.

860
00:21:15,339 --> 00:21:17,880
24%, 29%, 27%, 47%.

861
00:21:18,059 --> 00:21:19,549
But that was like a survey or

862
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:21,640
something to like a tight group.

863
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:24,240
29%, 29%, 11%, 25%.

864
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:25,220
Very, very bad.

865
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:26,609
This was frustrating because only

866
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:28,140
25% of their list was seeing their

867
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:28,720
messages.

868
00:21:28,839 --> 00:21:30,559
They had over like 100,000 people

869
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:31,490
that they were sending to.

870
00:21:31,769 --> 00:21:33,160
Super frustrating.

871
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:34,680
Upon an inspection, they had all

872
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,970
the technicalities set up.

873
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:37,430
This was happening purely due to

874
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:38,380
their reputation.

875
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,119
All we had to do was improve their

876
00:21:40,119 --> 00:21:41,880
reputation and then open the full

877
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:43,049
campaigns back up.

878
00:21:43,539 --> 00:21:45,160
So, this was day one when we came

879
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:45,539
in.

880
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:46,750
Then, it's like a day 60.

881
00:21:46,859 --> 00:21:51,470
Open rates, 60%.

882
00:21:51,549 --> 00:21:55,440
With 65, 60,000 people opening the

883
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,490
emails, sending to the same

884
00:21:57,490 --> 00:21:58,180
people.

885
00:21:58,279 --> 00:21:59,750
We're sending to the same people,

886
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,599
but now we're getting 60% opens.

887
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:03,160
This is because we improved our

888
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,690
reputation and we're no longer

889
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:05,940
landing in the spam folder

890
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:06,869
to where these people weren't

891
00:22:06,869 --> 00:22:07,579
seeing the emails.

892
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,500
This was just literally 60 days

893
00:22:09,549 --> 00:22:11,569
later following this protocol that

894
00:22:11,569 --> 00:22:12,990
I gave you in monitoring open

895
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:13,299
rates.

896
00:22:13,539 --> 00:22:14,269
And then, let's look at the

897
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:14,640
revenue.

898
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:15,660
Look at the revenue right here.

899
00:22:15,779 --> 00:22:18,140
5,000, 4,000, 3,000 survey.

900
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,619
4,000, 2,000.

901
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,539
Let's look at the revenue here.

902
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:25,769
19,000, 23,000, 15, 15, 6, 12, 10,

903
00:22:25,849 --> 00:22:26,390
12.

904
00:22:26,509 --> 00:22:28,359
Like, massive difference by

905
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:30,500
showing, by getting more people to

906
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:31,559
look at your emails.

907
00:22:32,259 --> 00:22:33,190
And making the emails better

908
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:34,470
because that's also what we did.

909
00:22:34,539 --> 00:22:35,819
So, it's really that simple.

910
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:36,710
If you ever have open rate

911
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:37,809
problems, you just got to play

912
00:22:37,809 --> 00:22:38,859
with your segmentation.

913
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,880
Play with different engagements.

914
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:42,279
And then, do that over a period of

915
00:22:42,289 --> 00:22:43,539
time and then you'll be all set.

916
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,130
Don't overcomplicate it.
