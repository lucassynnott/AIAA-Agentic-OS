1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,540
Alright, what up, lads and ladies?

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:04,419
Let's talk about agency marketing.

3
00:00:04,419 --> 00:00:05,469
So marketing and sales

4
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:06,490
are two different things.

5
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:07,629
Marketing is how you get the calls

6
00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:08,000
booked.

7
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:08,619
This is how you

8
00:00:08,789 --> 00:00:10,060
get people interested in you, and

9
00:00:10,269 --> 00:00:11,279
then they book the calls.

10
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:12,599
Sales is, okay, after they

11
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:13,839
book a call, how do we get them to

12
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:14,900
hand over their wallet?

13
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:16,350
So agency marketing, marketing

14
00:00:16,469 --> 00:00:17,609
is going to be the most important

15
00:00:17,989 --> 00:00:19,379
part, and that's something that

16
00:00:19,379 --> 00:00:20,320
I've been able to do

17
00:00:20,329 --> 00:00:22,429
pretty, pretty well, I would say.

18
00:00:22,429 --> 00:00:24,339
I'd say it's my strongest, easily

19
00:00:24,339 --> 00:00:25,539
by far, it's my strongest

20
00:00:25,589 --> 00:00:26,980
suit, it's agency marketing.

21
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:28,469
It's how we've grown from nothing

22
00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:30,059
to over $300k a month in

23
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:31,219
the past couple years.

24
00:00:31,219 --> 00:00:32,590
So let's talk into agency

25
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:33,420
marketing.

26
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:34,500
How the fuck do we get clients?

27
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:36,340
How do you get people to find out

28
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:37,969
who the fuck you are to book a

29
00:00:37,969 --> 00:00:38,579
call?

30
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:39,679
So there are four ways

31
00:00:39,799 --> 00:00:40,619
to get clients.

32
00:00:40,619 --> 00:00:41,799
Now, agencies love to

33
00:00:41,799 --> 00:00:43,119
overcomplicate this.

34
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:45,100
It's really easy to overcomplicate

35
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:45,289
this,

36
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:46,490
but there are really only four

37
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:47,770
ways that you can get clients.

38
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:49,000
Everything else is just some

39
00:00:49,009 --> 00:00:50,259
sort of remix of these.

40
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:52,020
So you have ads, so it's going to

41
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,079
be meta, YouTube, Google ads,

42
00:00:54,109 --> 00:00:54,439
etc.

43
00:00:54,609 --> 00:00:56,109
This is all scalable once you have

44
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:57,079
money in proof.

45
00:00:57,079 --> 00:00:58,039
I haven't really seen too many

46
00:00:58,039 --> 00:00:58,280
people

47
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:00,060
have success in the agency space

48
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,979
with YouTube ads and Google ads.

49
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:03,579
Particularly, it's going

50
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:04,239
to be meta.

51
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:05,939
Everybody just has Instagram.

52
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:07,640
Everybody's scrolling reels.

53
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,189
That's where e-com owners are.

54
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:10,620
So typically, it's going to be

55
00:01:10,629 --> 00:01:11,849
meta ads, and I know a lot of

56
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:13,560
people who do really well on meta,

57
00:01:13,709 --> 00:01:14,819
but if you want to book calls and

58
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:16,129
shit, you've got to put money

59
00:01:16,129 --> 00:01:17,439
down, and then also you've

60
00:01:17,469 --> 00:01:18,939
got to invest a lot of money to

61
00:01:19,069 --> 00:01:20,060
learn how to do it.

62
00:01:20,069 --> 00:01:21,680
So there's ads.

63
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,560
You have content.

64
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,340
So organic

65
00:01:24,489 --> 00:01:26,319
content, posting on Twitter,

66
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:28,739
LinkedIn, Instagram, YouTube, all

67
00:01:28,739 --> 00:01:30,569
that shit, builds trust and

68
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:31,019
authority,

69
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:32,500
and it's a multiplier for all

70
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:34,480
other forms of outreach, meaning

71
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,840
that if you run ads and you

72
00:01:35,989 --> 00:01:36,859
have organic content build up,

73
00:01:36,859 --> 00:01:37,760
your ads are going to perform

74
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,959
better because somebody will look

75
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,159
at your

76
00:01:39,219 --> 00:01:40,120
ad, go see your content, be like,

77
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:40,959
oh, this guy kind of knows what

78
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:42,200
he's talking about, yada, yada.

79
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:42,930
Job boards.

80
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:43,939
When they look at you and they see

81
00:01:44,069 --> 00:01:45,170
all your content, they're like,

82
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:46,099
oh, okay, this guy's

83
00:01:46,109 --> 00:01:46,530
legit.

84
00:01:46,629 --> 00:01:47,840
He's not just like some random

85
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,239
fucking dude who's going to scam

86
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:49,519
me.

87
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:50,540
Outreach as well.

88
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:51,010
If they

89
00:01:51,209 --> 00:01:52,120
know who you are, they've seen you

90
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,170
before, and then you reach out to

91
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:54,319
them, it's going to work a lot

92
00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:54,870
better.

93
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:56,689
But anyways, content, and that's

94
00:01:56,689 --> 00:01:58,400
how I've always gotten my clients

95
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,129
is content.

96
00:01:59,129 --> 00:01:59,719
So that's

97
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:00,959
majority of my expertise and what

98
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:02,239
I'm going to be talking about.

99
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:03,120
But also job boards.

100
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:03,859
This is what got

101
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:04,879
me off the ground.

102
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:06,480
A quick way to land first clients

103
00:02:06,489 --> 00:02:07,939
as a freelancer, and I'll be

104
00:02:07,939 --> 00:02:08,719
talking about

105
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:09,080
that.

106
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:10,219
I know a lot of people who do

107
00:02:10,349 --> 00:02:11,840
really, really well on Upwork.

108
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:12,530
Job boards.

109
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:13,349
Upwork is the

110
00:02:13,389 --> 00:02:14,050
main one of them.

111
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:15,069
And then outreach.

112
00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:16,490
So manual and automated outreach

113
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,870
both work and have their pros

114
00:02:17,909 --> 00:02:18,550
and cons.

115
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:20,080
So I've done all of these.

116
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,370
I've done all of these.

117
00:02:21,509 --> 00:02:23,009
What I've tripled down on is

118
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:23,669
content

119
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:25,500
because that's just my strong

120
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,009
suit.

121
00:02:26,009 --> 00:02:27,830
I'm good at making content.

122
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:30,009
I'm good at giving value to people

123
00:02:30,169 --> 00:02:31,889
in good ways that also convert

124
00:02:31,889 --> 00:02:33,979
them into interested clients.

125
00:02:33,979 --> 00:02:36,120
So that's just what I doubled down

126
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:36,250
on.

127
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:37,419
There are other people who aren't

128
00:02:37,419 --> 00:02:37,939
good at that.

129
00:02:37,939 --> 00:02:39,099
They don't like having their face

130
00:02:39,099 --> 00:02:39,340
everywhere.

131
00:02:39,349 --> 00:02:41,020
They don't like creating content

132
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:42,580
because every Twitter post you

133
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:44,020
might only get like a couple

134
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,259
hundred views or whatever.

135
00:02:45,289 --> 00:02:46,639
Some people like ads because you

136
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,120
guarantee that people are going to

137
00:02:48,229 --> 00:02:48,409
see it.

138
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,360
They're a little bit more numbers

139
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:49,849
oriented.

140
00:02:49,849 --> 00:02:50,740
Some people like the job boards

141
00:02:50,849 --> 00:02:51,610
because they know

142
00:02:51,689 --> 00:02:52,919
exactly what people are looking

143
00:02:52,969 --> 00:02:53,330
for.

144
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:54,580
And then some people like to do

145
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:55,919
the outreach just because it's

146
00:02:56,129 --> 00:02:56,680
scalable.

147
00:02:56,819 --> 00:02:58,360
And there are different ways of

148
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,000
doing it.

149
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,689
It's just whatever your strong

150
00:03:00,689 --> 00:03:01,210
suit is,

151
00:03:01,449 --> 00:03:02,129
I tried all of them.

152
00:03:02,259 --> 00:03:03,110
What ended up sticking was

153
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:03,539
content.

154
00:03:03,539 --> 00:03:04,330
So that's what I do.

155
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:05,120
And then I'm about

156
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,860
to relaunch ads here shortly.

157
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,830
So let's talk about all these.

158
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:10,500
So ads are the best and most

159
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:10,909
scalable

160
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:12,180
method for getting clients.

161
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:15,979
Sorry for the typo here.

162
00:03:15,979 --> 00:03:17,349
And most scalable way of getting

163
00:03:17,349 --> 00:03:17,900
clients.

164
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,139
The problem is you're usually not

165
00:03:19,139 --> 00:03:20,270
the best starting point as you

166
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:21,389
need upfront capital for it.

167
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:21,750
I don't

168
00:03:21,789 --> 00:03:22,810
know about you, but when I was

169
00:03:22,819 --> 00:03:23,930
starting, I was dead broke.

170
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:25,099
I wasn't just going to fucking

171
00:03:25,099 --> 00:03:25,479
start

172
00:03:25,629 --> 00:03:26,719
launching ads when I don't know

173
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:27,569
shit about them.

174
00:03:27,569 --> 00:03:29,620
It'll take you at minimum $10,000

175
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:30,599
plus to get a

176
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:31,280
hang of ads.

177
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,629
And then also you have to pay a

178
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,090
large cost per acquisition.

179
00:03:34,229 --> 00:03:35,509
So you might run ads for three

180
00:03:35,569 --> 00:03:36,979
months before you kind of start

181
00:03:37,189 --> 00:03:38,469
getting booked calls.

182
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,800
And that's three months of

183
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:41,960
spending 4K, 3K a month.

184
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:43,439
And so it's really difficult off

185
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:43,990
the bat.

186
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,449
But if you have like a mentor who

187
00:03:45,449 --> 00:03:46,759
can walk you through it,

188
00:03:46,789 --> 00:03:48,139
who's done it particularly for

189
00:03:48,389 --> 00:03:49,740
agencies and booking calls with

190
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,189
agencies, then you can make it

191
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:51,669
work.

192
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,099
I know people who have done that

193
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:54,590
directly from the get go and

194
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:56,150
they're, they work just fine.

195
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:57,419
And then also the thing with ads

196
00:03:57,469 --> 00:03:58,710
as well, you're going to pay a

197
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:00,159
large cost per acquisition.

198
00:04:00,189 --> 00:04:03,960
So say you have a $3,000 service,

199
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,319
um, you might have to pay $3,000

200
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:07,639
on ads to sign a client.

201
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:10,710
Um, and so it's going to be like,

202
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:11,990
you make no money on like the

203
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:13,300
first month or the first couple

204
00:04:13,349 --> 00:04:13,599
months.

205
00:04:13,689 --> 00:04:14,840
Um, I wouldn't recommend starting

206
00:04:14,889 --> 00:04:16,209
with ads unless you really have

207
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:17,500
somebody holding your hand and

208
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:17,660
like

209
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:18,759
building this all for you.

210
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:21,110
Um, but I just have never really

211
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:21,660
done them.

212
00:04:21,689 --> 00:04:22,899
Cause I've never really needed to.

213
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:25,240
Um, but the pros are, it's

214
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:25,740
predictable.

215
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:26,779
And then also it's scalable.

216
00:04:26,779 --> 00:04:28,730
If like you ever, um, like it's

217
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:30,209
just, once you have cracked ads,

218
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:31,259
then it's just like, do I want

219
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:31,870
more clients?

220
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:32,250
Okay.

221
00:04:32,269 --> 00:04:33,259
Let's up our ad spend.

222
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:34,500
Do I, do we need to chill and

223
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,639
focus on operations?

224
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:36,750
Let's decrease our ad spend.

225
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:37,899
And then you can just like control

226
00:04:37,899 --> 00:04:38,980
how many calls you're booking.

227
00:04:39,009 --> 00:04:40,240
That's what makes it scalable.

228
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:40,939
And then great.

229
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:42,100
Once you have case studies that

230
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,250
exist because case studies are

231
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,680
what's going to get people to

232
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,660
actually like believe you.

233
00:04:45,769 --> 00:04:47,089
Um, cons, very expensive to test

234
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:49,019
and beginners usually waste money.

235
00:04:49,149 --> 00:04:51,220
I've wasted over $20,000 on ads

236
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:52,589
when I probably shouldn't have

237
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:55,180
spent $20,000 experimenting on

238
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:55,420
ads.

239
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:56,620
Uh, but I learned a lot.

240
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,509
Um, and that's shit that they

241
00:04:58,509 --> 00:04:59,819
don't teach you in college.

242
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:01,560
And so it was super valuable and

243
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,879
it's going to help me as I

244
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:04,699
relaunch ads here shortly.

245
00:05:04,829 --> 00:05:06,560
Um, the best time to use, once you

246
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,129
have an offer, two to three great

247
00:05:08,129 --> 00:05:09,379
case studies and you have cash

248
00:05:09,379 --> 00:05:09,949
coming in.

249
00:05:10,069 --> 00:05:11,000
If you want to do ads and you

250
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,310
haven't like really doubled down

251
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:13,470
on any of the other acquisition

252
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:14,060
sources,

253
00:05:14,069 --> 00:05:15,740
then maybe you can look into ads,

254
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:16,709
but that's really not my

255
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:17,339
expertise.

256
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:18,759
And so I'm not going to talk about

257
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:19,959
it too much, but it could

258
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:21,660
literally just be as simple as

259
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:24,620
fucking, um, book a, like, here's

260
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:25,899
a video of me talking about a case

261
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:27,579
study, book a call on my website.

262
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:28,670
There are all sorts of different

263
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:29,420
things you can do.

264
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:31,449
You can go to meta ad library and

265
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,319
look up people and literally look

266
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:34,779
at what their funnels are like.

267
00:05:34,899 --> 00:05:36,720
Um, so I can go, sorry, Angus, I'm

268
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,509
going to expose you, but you can

269
00:05:38,509 --> 00:05:40,060
look up like Angus.

270
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:40,939
He's an email marketer.

271
00:05:41,029 --> 00:05:42,060
He runs ads and he does great on

272
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:42,290
ads.

273
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:43,540
And you can literally go and look

274
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:44,410
at all of his ads that he's

275
00:05:44,459 --> 00:05:45,240
running right now.

276
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:47,000
You can see exactly what it looks

277
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,500
like.

278
00:05:47,649 --> 00:05:48,930
Um, maybe we can go to use

279
00:05:49,129 --> 00:05:49,899
Klaviyo.

280
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,160
So if you're running an e-commerce

281
00:05:51,529 --> 00:05:53,259
brand doing over 3 million per

282
00:05:53,259 --> 00:05:54,540
year and using Klaviyo,

283
00:05:54,569 --> 00:05:55,779
then this is worth two minutes of

284
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:56,220
your time.

285
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:56,939
Q4.

286
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:58,180
And so just talks about Black

287
00:05:58,259 --> 00:06:00,139
Friday, Cyber Monday, and then

288
00:06:00,139 --> 00:06:01,660
take them to a landing page, get a

289
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:02,220
free audit,

290
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:03,829
and then it's just a form and book

291
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:04,379
a call.

292
00:06:04,389 --> 00:06:05,089
Super simple.

293
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,220
That's all you really need to do.

294
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:06,910
There are all sorts of different

295
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:07,699
ways you could run ads, but

296
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:08,379
there's that.

297
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,639
If you find somebody who you know

298
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:11,870
is running ads for an agency, um,

299
00:06:12,009 --> 00:06:14,300
and you want to use that,

300
00:06:14,329 --> 00:06:15,420
then you absolutely can.

301
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:16,660
It looks like I'm on the wrong

302
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:17,100
page.

303
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,939
All right, here we are.

304
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,300
We're back.

305
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,290
Um, so yeah, that's pretty much

306
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:22,379
what you need to know about ads.

307
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:24,199
If you want to learn more about

308
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:26,060
ads, hit up an ads expert.

309
00:06:26,089 --> 00:06:27,259
This is what I do, content.

310
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:27,899
That's what I do.

311
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:29,079
It's how you build authority and

312
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:30,300
prove what you know what you are

313
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,019
talking about.

314
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:32,060
It is a compounding game.

315
00:06:32,189 --> 00:06:33,439
It's very slow at first.

316
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,610
So the first year you do content,

317
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:36,560
you're probably not going to get

318
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:36,939
any clients.

319
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:37,939
And you're going to be doing it

320
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:38,620
every fucking day.

321
00:06:38,709 --> 00:06:39,290
And you're not going to get

322
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:39,660
clients.

323
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,019
Um, it's very slow at first, but

324
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:42,279
then it really picks up.

325
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:43,569
This is my sole method right now

326
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:44,540
for getting clients.

327
00:06:44,569 --> 00:06:46,050
And it has taken us from 30k a

328
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:48,029
month to 300k a month in about a

329
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:50,300
year and a half now.

330
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:52,459
Um, so it allowed us to 10x.

331
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:53,959
Um, and now I'm kind of like the

332
00:06:54,089 --> 00:06:55,810
guy for email marketing, which is

333
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:57,000
pretty crazy, crazy to say

334
00:06:57,029 --> 00:06:57,709
because I looked up to other

335
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:58,220
people.

336
00:06:58,329 --> 00:06:59,639
Um, and now like it, just if you

337
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,709
go off like impressions and, um,

338
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:04,420
and getting clients, um,

339
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:05,620
I am the guy in the space, which

340
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:06,779
is pretty, pretty crazy.

341
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:08,040
So it, it'll come up faster than

342
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:08,769
you think.

343
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:10,639
Um, so this is essentially

344
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,660
LinkedIn, YouTube, X, and

345
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:15,500
Instagram, X, Twitter, whatever.

346
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:16,759
Um, I have gone through different

347
00:07:17,129 --> 00:07:18,410
periods where each one of these

348
00:07:18,459 --> 00:07:20,029
performed better than others.

349
00:07:20,209 --> 00:07:21,870
Um, but in every case, like

350
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:24,079
YouTube and Instagram have been my

351
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:26,459
most, uh, my best ones, um,

352
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:27,949
because I was kind of early to

353
00:07:28,089 --> 00:07:29,600
both of them, um, compared to like

354
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:30,620
other people in my niche.

355
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,860
Um, now it's a little bit more

356
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:32,959
saturated on YouTube and

357
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:33,660
Instagram.

358
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:34,879
Um, but that doesn't mean that

359
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:36,000
like you can't get clients or

360
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,569
anything.

361
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:38,579
Um, and I still get over a hundred

362
00:07:38,579 --> 00:07:40,110
calls a month from these.

363
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:41,480
Um, so, but essentially it's just

364
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:42,860
sharing case studies, wins,

365
00:07:42,949 --> 00:07:44,120
insights, behind the scenes stuff,

366
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,379
uh, build trust with silent

367
00:07:45,379 --> 00:07:46,759
lurkers who will then reach out

368
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:47,259
later.

369
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:48,509
It's a long-term play, the earlier

370
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:50,060
it starts, the more it stacks,

371
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:50,750
start now.

372
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:54,350
You will not, there's no, there

373
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:56,980
like, there's no negative of, of

374
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,689
building your content and your

375
00:07:58,709 --> 00:08:00,050
network because it gives you your

376
00:08:00,329 --> 00:08:01,019
network as well.

377
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,259
All my friends that I have in this

378
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:03,579
space right now, the client

379
00:08:03,579 --> 00:08:04,920
ascension guys, um,

380
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:06,300
the people giving you this course

381
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:08,430
now, how did I become friends with

382
00:08:08,569 --> 00:08:09,100
them?

383
00:08:09,129 --> 00:08:10,220
My content.

384
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:12,300
Um, and so it's just like, it just

385
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:13,939
compounds and it becomes just like

386
00:08:13,939 --> 00:08:14,459
your asset.

387
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:15,800
Um, and it becomes you and it's

388
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:17,100
how you get your name known.

389
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:17,810
It's how you get referrals from

390
00:08:17,939 --> 00:08:18,300
other people.

391
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,009
It's how you get clients.

392
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,259
And then also even better, it's

393
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:21,579
how you learn your service.

394
00:08:21,699 --> 00:08:24,920
I learned, I, there is this, this

395
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,620
doc that I made.

396
00:08:26,629 --> 00:08:30,110
Um, everything you need to know

397
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:33,980
about e-commerce email marketing.

398
00:08:34,048 --> 00:08:35,440
I believe that is what it's

399
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:36,139
called.

400
00:08:36,168 --> 00:08:37,340
This was one of the first things

401
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:39,590
where I really, really, um, where

402
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:41,580
I really, really doubled that.

403
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:42,668
Like I started to like really

404
00:08:42,668 --> 00:08:43,500
focus on content.

405
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:44,700
My knowledge about email marketing

406
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,019
just 10 times, because when you

407
00:08:46,019 --> 00:08:46,620
create content,

408
00:08:46,649 --> 00:08:48,350
you're forced to think about your

409
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:48,669
thing.

410
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:49,610
You're supposed to create

411
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:50,179
philosophies.

412
00:08:50,419 --> 00:08:51,500
You're looking at your past work.

413
00:08:51,529 --> 00:08:52,720
Just creating content makes you so

414
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,580
much better and so much more

415
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:54,139
knowledgeable.

416
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,399
It helps you like put your ideas

417
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:56,460
into thoughts.

418
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:59,360
And so it's, it's just, it's, here

419
00:08:59,419 --> 00:08:59,820
it is.

420
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:00,059
Okay.

421
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:01,299
Magnum Opus.

422
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:02,220
I'm actually, yeah.

423
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,460
So this was like the first one

424
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:06,059
that I did like a year over,

425
00:09:06,059 --> 00:09:08,370
almost two years ago, um, where I

426
00:09:08,409 --> 00:09:09,519
kind of just like compiled all my

427
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:10,700
email marketing knowledge.

428
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:12,600
And then I just created this

429
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,220
massive document of 71 pages of me

430
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:17,179
essentially giving everything

431
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:19,500
that I know about email marketing.

432
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,759
So, um, you can look at this.

433
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:24,000
Um, this is like what, what it was

434
00:09:24,019 --> 00:09:26,110
just a sales letter for brands.

435
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:26,830
And I was just like, fuck it.

436
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:27,649
I'm just going to write everything

437
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:28,200
that I need to know.

438
00:09:28,429 --> 00:09:29,649
If I wanted to write a massive

439
00:09:29,929 --> 00:09:31,519
document towards e-commerce

440
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:33,659
owners, what would I write?

441
00:09:33,779 --> 00:09:34,990
Um, and so I pulled up like a

442
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:36,750
couple of different examples of

443
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,129
like other people and other niches

444
00:09:38,259 --> 00:09:39,179
who had something like this.

445
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:41,169
And then I just wrote, what is

446
00:09:41,179 --> 00:09:42,620
email marketing?

447
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:43,879
Why is it important?

448
00:09:44,009 --> 00:09:44,940
What is all this stuff?

449
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,789
And all of this shit, I low key

450
00:09:46,789 --> 00:09:47,980
didn't know before.

451
00:09:48,029 --> 00:09:49,330
I was just forced to kind of like

452
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:50,139
figure it out.

453
00:09:50,259 --> 00:09:51,250
And it was like, okay, why does

454
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:51,820
email work?

455
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,059
Why do these, why do I have these

456
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:53,809
philosophies?

457
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:55,059
And then I justify it.

458
00:09:55,149 --> 00:09:56,350
A lot of this is just completely

459
00:09:56,409 --> 00:09:59,169
made up, um, with justifications

460
00:09:59,169 --> 00:10:00,009
that I kind of like figured

461
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:01,019
out as I'm writing this.

462
00:10:01,049 --> 00:10:02,470
Mind you, this was before ChatGPT

463
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:02,940
as well.

464
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:04,289
Now you have ChatGPT to help you

465
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:05,590
compile your thoughts and

466
00:10:05,669 --> 00:10:05,980
everything.

467
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:07,240
Um, so then I had these winning

468
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:09,110
philosophies and base principles

469
00:10:09,139 --> 00:10:10,450
and everything, everything

470
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:11,500
that you need right here.

471
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:12,679
And this is what started it all

472
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:13,970
because then I have this massive

473
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:14,620
document.

474
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:15,740
Now I can turn this into fucking

475
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:16,860
so many different tweets.

476
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:18,549
I can turn this into everything

477
00:10:18,549 --> 00:10:20,610
that I need, um, and for content.

478
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:21,659
And then this lasted me a while.

479
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:23,009
And then this was one of my first

480
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,740
YouTube videos as well, which

481
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:25,559
really popped.

482
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:28,080
Ignore my YouTube, um, the

483
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,379
recommended here, but it was one

484
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:31,659
of my first videos that really

485
00:10:31,659 --> 00:10:31,980
popped.

486
00:10:32,129 --> 00:10:35,259
Where are you?

487
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:35,659
Right here.

488
00:10:35,789 --> 00:10:38,059
$25,000.

489
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:39,019
Me just reading this doc.

490
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:40,370
In both time and in this video

491
00:10:40,649 --> 00:10:41,820
training, I'm going to be breaking

492
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,100
down exactly how I've managed

493
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,059
to generate.

494
00:10:44,179 --> 00:10:45,409
It's me just reading this doc

495
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:46,220
right here.

496
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:47,929
Um, and this has gotten me a lot

497
00:10:47,929 --> 00:10:48,779
of clients.

498
00:10:50,059 --> 00:10:50,980
It got me a lot of clients at the

499
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:51,480
beginning.

500
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:52,850
I was pretty early on the email

501
00:10:53,129 --> 00:10:55,480
marketing wave and this video has

502
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,409
printed me so many

503
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:57,100
fucking clients.

504
00:10:57,169 --> 00:10:57,740
It's kind of crazy.

505
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,100
Um, and then I just started

506
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:00,549
ranking and this is what I've done

507
00:11:00,549 --> 00:11:01,179
for YouTube.

508
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:03,970
Uh, but just start posting, just

509
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:04,379
do it.

510
00:11:04,409 --> 00:11:05,500
Don't overthink it.

511
00:11:05,649 --> 00:11:06,399
Just start posting out on all

512
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:06,980
these platforms.

513
00:11:07,129 --> 00:11:08,360
Just post what you're doing, your

514
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:09,750
email examples, things you're

515
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:10,590
learning along the way.

516
00:11:10,769 --> 00:11:12,000
Um, shit like that.

517
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:13,019
That's really all you need.

518
00:11:13,169 --> 00:11:13,730
This is my Twitter.

519
00:11:13,769 --> 00:11:15,549
You could go back to my beginning

520
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:17,220
days on Twitter, scroll down if

521
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:17,740
you want.

522
00:11:17,769 --> 00:11:18,990
When I was an absolute nobody,

523
00:11:19,049 --> 00:11:22,190
December, 2021, um, when I didn't

524
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:24,139
know shit and I'm still,

525
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:25,519
I don't have any clients and I'm

526
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:27,629
tweeting and doing this, reaching

527
00:11:27,769 --> 00:11:29,419
out to other people my size,

528
00:11:29,429 --> 00:11:31,100
just like building, building a

529
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:31,740
network.

530
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:33,220
This is just what you want to do.

531
00:11:33,429 --> 00:11:34,450
So you can look at my content,

532
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:35,330
kind of how it works.

533
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,899
I do three tweets every day,

534
00:11:37,899 --> 00:11:39,559
minimum, and then a couple of

535
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:41,179
threads per week as well.

536
00:11:41,309 --> 00:11:43,000
Um, and then my Instagram, I do a

537
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
short form video and then I do a

538
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,019
swipe every single day.

539
00:11:47,169 --> 00:11:48,279
Now I have like people who help me

540
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,639
write my content in my team.

541
00:11:49,769 --> 00:11:52,360
Um, but this is like, for example,

542
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:54,470
what I'm posting and how it all

543
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,019
works.

544
00:11:55,049 --> 00:11:56,279
And then LinkedIn, I'm just

545
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:57,929
repurposing some of my Twitter

546
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:58,509
content.

547
00:11:58,649 --> 00:12:01,120
So a lot of this was literally

548
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,190
just like a tweet and then just

549
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:04,059
copy and pasting it.

550
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:05,110
A lot of this shit, I'm just

551
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,299
posting the same shit on every

552
00:12:06,299 --> 00:12:06,779
platform.

553
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:08,639
And then YouTube, I post one video

554
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:09,340
per week.

555
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:11,740
Um, and that's how I do it all.

556
00:12:11,889 --> 00:12:12,980
And then they all funnel into a

557
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:13,659
newsletter.

558
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:14,860
So I tell people, Hey, go sign up

559
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:15,580
for my newsletter.

560
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:19,480
Um, inbox newsletter.com

561
00:12:19,649 --> 00:12:22,539
Right here.

562
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:23,580
This is just my newsletter.

563
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:26,759
It's also like a fucking, um, this

564
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:29,019
is like, I, I, I do newsletter

565
00:12:29,019 --> 00:12:30,139
Monday, Wednesday, Friday.

566
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:31,899
I have 16,000 people on it.

567
00:12:32,049 --> 00:12:33,929
If I ever need to do a push, I'll

568
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,519
just send a list, send an email to

569
00:12:35,529 --> 00:12:36,059
my list being like,

570
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:37,860
Hey, if I can book a call, stupid

571
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,419
e-com owner, and that works.

572
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:40,679
And so everything funnels into the

573
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:41,980
newsletter, all my content.

574
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:42,909
I'm like, Hey, go sign up to my

575
00:12:42,909 --> 00:12:43,399
newsletter.

576
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:44,720
I give you a 75 page guide on

577
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,529
email marketing.

578
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:46,929
And it's, it used to be this doc

579
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:48,330
that I'd give away to people when

580
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:49,179
they sign up to my newsletter.

581
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:51,100
Um, but then I adapted it.

582
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:51,960
And now it's a little bit more

583
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,860
modern to what I have now.

584
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:54,120
Um, so that's how my content

585
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:56,340
funnel works top of funnel post on

586
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:58,299
all these different platforms,

587
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:00,740
create tons of value, give free

588
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:02,419
guides, and then give free guides

589
00:13:02,419 --> 00:13:05,259
hidden behind a newsletter.

590
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:06,870
So give me your email and I'll

591
00:13:06,889 --> 00:13:08,590
give you this massive guide on

592
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:09,659
email marketing.

593
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:10,899
And then my newsletter I'm

594
00:13:10,909 --> 00:13:12,700
sending, I have a sequence of when

595
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:13,980
somebody signs up to my email

596
00:13:14,009 --> 00:13:15,360
list, I send them a daily email,

597
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,730
just giving them a stupid amount

598
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:17,340
of sauce.

599
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:18,690
And then also just like teaching

600
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:20,460
them email marketing and then

601
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:21,820
pushing the e-com brands to,

602
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,250
uh, book a call with me.

603
00:13:23,429 --> 00:13:26,909
Um, and then, yeah, and then they

604
00:13:27,049 --> 00:13:27,929
eventually book a call and that's

605
00:13:27,929 --> 00:13:28,460
how it all works.

606
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:29,399
And that's how my content funnel

607
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:29,700
works.

608
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:30,940
Uh, now we have job boards.

609
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:31,990
This is what got me off the

610
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:32,419
ground.

611
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:34,139
This is what got me to 10 K a

612
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:35,809
month where my job boards, it's

613
00:13:35,809 --> 00:13:36,460
where a lot of beginners

614
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:37,419
get their first dollar.

615
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:38,899
It's what I would tell everybody.

616
00:13:39,029 --> 00:13:40,200
If you don't have experience, go

617
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,220
to the job boards, go to Upwork.

618
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:43,379
This is where I had my first 10 K

619
00:13:43,379 --> 00:13:44,870
months, my buddy who I just got on

620
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:45,500
email marketing,

621
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,919
he had his first 20 K month purely

622
00:13:47,129 --> 00:13:47,659
Upwork.

623
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:48,899
I know a guy who does nearly a

624
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:50,570
hundred K a month just on Upwork.

625
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:52,570
Um, job boards are great because

626
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:54,009
these are brands who are actively

627
00:13:54,009 --> 00:13:55,090
looking for help from

628
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:55,460
someone.

629
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:56,480
So you don't need to convince them

630
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,529
that they need email marketing.

631
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:58,730
You just need to convince them to

632
00:13:58,730 --> 00:13:59,570
pick you.

633
00:13:59,669 --> 00:14:00,539
Upwork is my favorite.

634
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:02,779
Um, essentially it's just a job

635
00:14:02,779 --> 00:14:05,259
platform where anybody can post,

636
00:14:05,259 --> 00:14:06,620
hey, I need help with this

637
00:14:06,769 --> 00:14:06,860
thing.

638
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:09,019
And then what you, what you're

639
00:14:09,019 --> 00:14:10,710
able to do is then with these

640
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:12,110
posts that people are like,

641
00:14:12,169 --> 00:14:13,820
Hey, fucking, I need help with

642
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:14,299
this.

643
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:15,519
Then you can be like, I can do

644
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:16,139
that.

645
00:14:16,149 --> 00:14:18,539
And so if we go here, let me

646
00:14:18,539 --> 00:14:20,220
switch to the freelancer side.

647
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:22,379
Um, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh.

648
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:23,340
So this is what it looks like.

649
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:25,070
And all you need to do all

650
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:26,830
throughout the day is look up

651
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:27,580
email marketing.

652
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:28,840
And then you can look at all the

653
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:30,340
job posts that brands right now

654
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:31,419
are asking for email

655
00:14:31,429 --> 00:14:31,899
marketers.

656
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,250
Um, so graphic designer for meta

657
00:14:33,529 --> 00:14:34,809
Google ads and email marketing,

658
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:36,409
mailer light email campaign,

659
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:37,779
uh, go high level expert for email

660
00:14:37,779 --> 00:14:38,870
templates, email marketing

661
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:39,820
designer for Mailchimp.

662
00:14:39,929 --> 00:14:40,860
So just a designer.

663
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:41,820
And then you can see all this.

664
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:43,019
So maybe I'd need entry level

665
00:14:43,019 --> 00:14:44,289
email specialist needed.

666
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:44,990
Perfect.

667
00:14:45,129 --> 00:14:45,980
I'd click onto this.

668
00:14:46,009 --> 00:14:46,940
This is the job post.

669
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:47,629
This is the brand.

670
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:48,730
You can look into it and then it's

671
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:50,600
like, Hey, we need, uh, this is

672
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:51,179

673
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:52,440
And then you can apply now.

674
00:14:52,629 --> 00:14:53,179
It's perfect.

675
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:56,330
Um, you can see all of this email

676
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:58,419
marketing three to five emails per

677
00:14:58,419 --> 00:14:58,779
week.

678
00:14:58,799 --> 00:14:59,159
Boom.

679
00:14:59,299 --> 00:15:00,269
And then it can talk, it'll talk

680
00:15:00,269 --> 00:15:01,580
about like the brand or whatever.

681
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:03,000
And so you have people who are

682
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:04,940
actively looking for help.

683
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:06,620
And so that's, what's great, uh,

684
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:07,480
easy access people who are

685
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,139
actively looking.

686
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:08,980
So you don't need to convince them

687
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:09,899
that they need email marketing.

688
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:10,460
They already know it.

689
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:11,000
They're asking for email

690
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,340
marketing.

691
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:12,350
You just have to convince them to

692
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:12,690
pick you.

693
00:15:12,929 --> 00:15:15,110
Um, cons is a lot of these have

694
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:16,220
smaller budgets.

695
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:17,309
A lot of these brands have smaller

696
00:15:17,309 --> 00:15:17,720
budgets.

697
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,250
Um, they're looking for

698
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:20,539
freelancers, beginner people,

699
00:15:20,539 --> 00:15:21,179
which is great.

700
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:22,100
Uh, but it's going to be very

701
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,500
difficult for you to get like

702
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,299
super big deals.

703
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:26,289
We have got, I've gotten big deals

704
00:15:26,289 --> 00:15:27,789
and you can get big deals 100%.

705
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:28,860
It's just a little bit harder.

706
00:15:29,009 --> 00:15:30,620
Um, and so there's that.

707
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,659
And then it's high competition.

708
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:32,539
It's a bunch of people just like

709
00:15:32,539 --> 00:15:33,500
reaching out and be like, Hey,

710
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:33,820
pick me.

711
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:36,029
Um, so you can use these right off

712
00:15:36,029 --> 00:15:37,259
the bat for case studies,

713
00:15:37,259 --> 00:15:38,350
portfolio building and getting

714
00:15:38,389 --> 00:15:39,340
early momentum.

715
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:41,309
Again, I was purely up work for

716
00:15:41,309 --> 00:15:44,840
like six months, not like, yeah,

717
00:15:44,889 --> 00:15:46,700
like six to nine months.

718
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,730
Um, and it got me to my first 10

719
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,450
K, um, 10 K a month.

720
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:52,509
Um, and so it's great.

721
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:53,659
It's just all throughout the day.

722
00:15:53,789 --> 00:15:54,899
You're refreshing, trying to find

723
00:15:54,929 --> 00:15:55,970
these different, uh, these

724
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:56,779
different posts.

725
00:15:56,809 --> 00:15:58,519
And so, um, you can figure it out

726
00:15:58,519 --> 00:16:00,200
on your own, but literally it's

727
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:03,009
just convince them to work

728
00:16:03,029 --> 00:16:04,379
with you, give them value when

729
00:16:04,649 --> 00:16:05,820
they ask for something.

730
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:07,299
And so always be looking for jobs.

731
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:08,539
Then you have outreach.

732
00:16:08,659 --> 00:16:10,149
So outreach is also a great path

733
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:11,740
to book meetings early on.

734
00:16:11,889 --> 00:16:13,899
Uh, but it's pure brute force in

735
00:16:13,899 --> 00:16:15,100
persistence.

736
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:17,250
Same as job boards, but outreach

737
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,080
is just like fucking hitting

738
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:19,820
people up.

739
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:20,860
Like, yo, let me do your shit.

740
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:21,860
Uh, so you have, you have two

741
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:22,210
things.

742
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,539
You have manual outreach and cold

743
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:24,139
outreach.

744
00:16:24,289 --> 00:16:26,460
So, uh, or automated outreach.

745
00:16:26,539 --> 00:16:28,360
I don't know why I said cold

746
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:33,259
automated outreach, um, automated

747
00:16:33,259 --> 00:16:34,620
outreach, manual outreach would

748
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:35,860
entail you reaching out to brands

749
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:36,809
that you want to work with

750
00:16:36,809 --> 00:16:38,110
manually into having them

751
00:16:38,259 --> 00:16:39,559
or emailing them manually.

752
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:41,690
Um, and then you have, uh,

753
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:43,259
automated outreach.

754
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:44,320
So you can do the same sort of

755
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,730
thing, but make it automated.

756
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,850
So things like cold email

757
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:48,299
automatically send emails.

758
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:49,500
And I, I did that.

759
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:51,309
That's what took me from 10 K a

760
00:16:51,309 --> 00:16:53,879
month to 30 K a month, um, 30, 40

761
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:54,539
K a month.

762
00:16:54,549 --> 00:16:56,149
That's what cold email took me to

763
00:16:56,169 --> 00:16:56,570
that.

764
00:16:56,649 --> 00:16:57,720
I stopped doing job boards and

765
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,049
switched to cold email, got me to

766
00:16:59,049 --> 00:17:00,059
like 40 K a month.

767
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,139
And then my content started

768
00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:01,539
ripping.

769
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:02,899
My cold email started to not do

770
00:17:02,929 --> 00:17:04,098
good anymore because I was putting

771
00:17:04,098 --> 00:17:04,940
less time into it.

772
00:17:05,019 --> 00:17:05,910
So then I just doubled down on

773
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:06,289
content.

774
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,000
Um, but that's what I, that's what

775
00:17:09,109 --> 00:17:09,420
I did.

776
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:10,539
I did the automated.

777
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,660
So you can do cold email.

778
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:12,859
Um, you can just look it up.

779
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,700
The client ascension guys, um,

780
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,088
Fazio and Andre and Christian and

781
00:17:17,088 --> 00:17:18,220
Dan, that's what they do.

782
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:18,779
Cold email.

783
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:19,470
They can help you with it.

784
00:17:19,588 --> 00:17:20,700
Watch their content on it.

785
00:17:20,838 --> 00:17:21,940
You can send thousands of emails

786
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:22,940
every day to brands.

787
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:25,180
Um, and so you can do that.

788
00:17:25,259 --> 00:17:26,259
Um, the only thing is like, it's

789
00:17:26,259 --> 00:17:27,578
not going to be super targeted

790
00:17:27,578 --> 00:17:28,088
because you're sending

791
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:29,099
the same thing to everybody.

792
00:17:29,109 --> 00:17:30,220
Whereas like if you do manual

793
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:31,430
outreach where you're just

794
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:32,779
reaching out to less brands,

795
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,039
but it's super personal and you're

796
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:35,259
reaching out personally.

797
00:17:35,369 --> 00:17:36,950
Um, and being like, Hey, work with

798
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:37,250
me.

799
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:39,039
So this is what I would do if I

800
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:40,710
was starting out and I wanted to

801
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:41,160
get clients.

802
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:44,380
Uh, I would do a manual outreach

803
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:47,220
method of hyper targeted and

804
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:49,329
giving free work.

805
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:51,099
You have to give free work.

806
00:17:51,829 --> 00:17:53,000
It's good experience for you when

807
00:17:53,059 --> 00:17:54,829
you're starting out and it's going

808
00:17:54,829 --> 00:17:56,250
to build your portfolio

809
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:57,539
by having all these email examples

810
00:17:57,539 --> 00:17:58,460
that you create.

811
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:01,579
Um, and it's just the best.

812
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:02,480
So find a list of brands that you

813
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,089
want to work with.

814
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:05,930
Go on Instagram, just search this

815
00:18:06,059 --> 00:18:08,220
fucking brute force.

816
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:08,910
Find a ton of brands that you

817
00:18:09,059 --> 00:18:09,900
think you could work with.

818
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:10,990
Uh, for me, I was looking at

819
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:12,779
brands who were like a thousand to

820
00:18:12,829 --> 00:18:13,980
a hundred thousand followers

821
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:14,690
on Instagram.

822
00:18:14,849 --> 00:18:15,740
They sold physical products.

823
00:18:15,769 --> 00:18:16,970
They were at least doing like one

824
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:17,660
post per week.

825
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:19,690
I'd find one of them, um, that I

826
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:22,170
like, and then I would, uh, like

827
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:23,099
go to their following

828
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:24,109
and then see if they're following

829
00:18:24,109 --> 00:18:24,619
similar brands.

830
00:18:24,769 --> 00:18:25,430
Cause a lot of these brands are

831
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:26,299
following similar brands.

832
00:18:26,349 --> 00:18:27,650
I would find all these brands.

833
00:18:27,769 --> 00:18:28,980
I would screenshot their profile

834
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,319
so I could find them later, make a

835
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:30,650
list.

836
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:32,049
Um, and then opt into all their

837
00:18:32,329 --> 00:18:33,549
email lists to see what their

838
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:34,539
emails are like.

839
00:18:34,599 --> 00:18:35,230
So that's what we would do.

840
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,589
We'd opt into the email list and

841
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:37,660
then what we want to do is look at

842
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:38,460
their welcome email

843
00:18:38,599 --> 00:18:39,640
and then recreate it and make a

844
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,630
better one than what they

845
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,500
currently have.

846
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:42,380
That's all we want to do.

847
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:44,720
Um, so I literally have even

848
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,180
YouTube video on this.

849
00:18:47,329 --> 00:18:49,420
Um, if you go to Max Sturdivant

850
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,720
right here, I literally have

851
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:52,779
welcome email.

852
00:18:52,809 --> 00:18:55,619
Um, I have a YouTube video just on

853
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,990
how to create great welcome email

854
00:18:58,069 --> 00:18:59,019
number ones right

855
00:18:59,039 --> 00:18:59,400
here.

856
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,619
It's a welcome flow right here.

857
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:01,579
You have that.

858
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:02,690
And then I'm pretty sure I have

859
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:05,099
another video from way back on.

860
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:07,299
Do, do, do, do, do, do on

861
00:19:07,299 --> 00:19:08,849
reviewing welcome emails.

862
00:19:09,009 --> 00:19:15,960
Um, I do have a lot of stuff so

863
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,599
you can go through these.

864
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:19,900
I know there's one of me roasting.

865
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:20,779
There we go.

866
00:19:20,789 --> 00:19:22,019
Welcome flow emails, grading

867
00:19:22,089 --> 00:19:23,660
welcome flow emails right here.

868
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:24,859
There's a great one right here of

869
00:19:24,859 --> 00:19:26,220
me going through what welcome

870
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:27,559
emails suck and what good ones

871
00:19:27,589 --> 00:19:27,900
look like.

872
00:19:28,089 --> 00:19:29,359
Um, so you have that and that's

873
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:30,299
what I would do.

874
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:32,150
I would take the time to write a

875
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:33,980
new email and design that email.

876
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:34,960
And then what I would do, I have

877
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,259
the upgraded email and then I have

878
00:19:36,259 --> 00:19:37,099
their before email.

879
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:38,450
I'll show a before and after.

880
00:19:38,549 --> 00:19:39,890
Maybe I'll shoot a loom video

881
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:40,859
showing it.

882
00:19:41,009 --> 00:19:42,000
And then what I would do is I

883
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,450
would send that upgraded email to

884
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:44,700
the brand, send it to the

885
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:45,940
owner and every single employee

886
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,089
that I can find on every single

887
00:19:47,089 --> 00:19:47,609
platform.

888
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:48,920
I'm going to find their Instagram.

889
00:19:49,029 --> 00:19:50,140
I'm going to find their LinkedIn.

890
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:51,099
I'm going to find their email.

891
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:52,140
I'm going to find absolutely

892
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:53,549
fucking everything that I can and

893
00:19:53,549 --> 00:19:54,460
just blast them with it.

894
00:19:54,579 --> 00:19:55,170
Hey, I made this.

895
00:19:55,269 --> 00:19:55,890
Let me know what you think.

896
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:58,109
Um, can I do the whole welcome

897
00:19:58,109 --> 00:19:59,900
flow for free for you guys?

898
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:00,809
I think I'll be able to make you

899
00:20:00,809 --> 00:20:01,140
money.

900
00:20:01,309 --> 00:20:02,220
And that's what I would do.

901
00:20:02,359 --> 00:20:03,480
And just follow up like a mad man.

902
00:20:03,609 --> 00:20:05,900
Just consistently every other day,

903
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,720
shoot them custom messages, shoot

904
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,779
them voice notes, everything.

905
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,200
We want to do email, Instagram,

906
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,400
DMs, LinkedIn messages.

907
00:20:11,509 --> 00:20:12,460
This is free.

908
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:14,140
It's immediate, unlimited scale.

909
00:20:14,259 --> 00:20:14,829
The cause is that it takes

910
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:15,519
persistence.

911
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,309
You're going to get a lot of

912
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:16,779
rejection.

913
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:18,019
You're going to get, most of the

914
00:20:18,049 --> 00:20:19,269
people are not even going to

915
00:20:19,269 --> 00:20:20,140
respond to you.

916
00:20:20,289 --> 00:20:21,339
You got to get used to that.

917
00:20:21,369 --> 00:20:23,000
But the, the pro of this is you

918
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,539
get a fuck ton of experience

919
00:20:24,539 --> 00:20:26,220
creating emails and you have a

920
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:27,640
fuck ton of emails now that you

921
00:20:27,849 --> 00:20:29,339
can show in your portfolio and you

922
00:20:29,339 --> 00:20:30,299
have templates that'll make

923
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:31,420
your process easier.

924
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:32,680
Um, the goal here is just to get

925
00:20:32,759 --> 00:20:34,329
conversations and not close deals

926
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:35,099
in the first message.

927
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,099
Just be like, Hey, I made this for

928
00:20:36,099 --> 00:20:36,339
you.

929
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:37,089
Let me know what you think.

930
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:38,710
And if I'd love to create the rest

931
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:39,900
of the welcome flow,

932
00:20:40,009 --> 00:20:41,819
if I had some of your assets, um,

933
00:20:41,819 --> 00:20:42,809
something like that, that's what

934
00:20:42,859 --> 00:20:43,799
we'd want to do.

935
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,299
So what's one should you focus on?

936
00:20:45,559 --> 00:20:46,589
Depends on where you're at and

937
00:20:46,589 --> 00:20:48,529
what you're good at, good at all

938
00:20:48,529 --> 00:20:49,099
of them work,

939
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:50,200
but don't try to do everything at

940
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:50,450
once.

941
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:52,940
Just try to focus on one platform.

942
00:20:53,079 --> 00:20:54,160
One thing that your gut says you

943
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,299
think you'd be the best at and

944
00:20:55,299 --> 00:20:55,740
then do that.

945
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:56,940
Try them all.

946
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:58,549
Maybe like briefly get a sense of

947
00:20:58,569 --> 00:21:00,140
what you like, find what you like

948
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:01,819
best and triple down on that.

949
00:21:01,849 --> 00:21:03,240
Here's a baseline need clients.

950
00:21:03,349 --> 00:21:05,500
Now I would recommend job boards

951
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,019
and targeted manual outreach.

952
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:08,500
So like what I said earlier of

953
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:11,099
upgrading the emails, I'd do that.

954
00:21:11,109 --> 00:21:12,839
And I'd be a madman on the job

955
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:13,569
boards.

956
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:17,740
Um, and, um, just like do that.

957
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:18,789
And you can also do a combo of

958
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:19,089
both.

959
00:21:19,309 --> 00:21:21,049
If somebody makes a job posting on

960
00:21:21,049 --> 00:21:22,150
Upwork and you can find their

961
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:22,369
name,

962
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:24,299
also send them emails, find their

963
00:21:24,299 --> 00:21:25,500
Instagram, find their LinkedIn and

964
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,220
reach out to them there.

965
00:21:26,299 --> 00:21:27,420
Um, that's something that's super

966
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:27,720
good.

967
00:21:27,859 --> 00:21:28,980
You just gotta be, you gotta be a

968
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:30,980
madman on this and down to play

969
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:31,740
the long game content.

970
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,160
Just start doing that now.

971
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:34,269
And if you have case studies in a

972
00:21:34,269 --> 00:21:35,619
budget, then you can get going on

973
00:21:35,619 --> 00:21:37,099
ads, uh, stack them over time.

974
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:38,299
The outreach will pay the bills,

975
00:21:38,299 --> 00:21:39,420
but content is what build the

976
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,849
brands and then ads will scale

977
00:21:41,009 --> 00:21:41,569
the business.

978
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:42,539
And so that's just like a good

979
00:21:42,539 --> 00:21:44,730
little phrase, um, that I heard

980
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:47,900
once and it absolutely is true.

981
00:21:48,009 --> 00:21:49,160
So that is how we do the marketing

982
00:21:49,529 --> 00:21:50,460
for the company.

983
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:51,710
I wish I could give you a roadmap

984
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,369
for absolutely everything.

985
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:54,279
But a lot of this is just like,

986
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:55,099
figure it the fuck out.

987
00:21:55,109 --> 00:21:56,430
These are the keys.

988
00:21:56,549 --> 00:21:59,099
Just start going and figure it the

989
00:21:59,099 --> 00:22:00,029
fuck out.

990
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:01,559
Hope that was helpful and I'll see

991
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:02,619
you in the next video.
