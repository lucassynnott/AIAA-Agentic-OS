1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:02,109
The sales process.

2
00:00:02,229 --> 00:00:04,629
Let's get some fucking money, huh?

3
00:00:04,629 --> 00:00:06,339
Let's get some goddamn money.

4
00:00:06,349 --> 00:00:07,710
All right, so you get somebody to

5
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:08,720
book a call with you.

6
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,060
Finally, you get these bastards

7
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:13,500
on the phone with you.

8
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,300
How do you get them to hand them

9
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:17,149
their credit card so that you

10
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:18,649
can swipe it and drain their whole

11
00:00:18,949 --> 00:00:19,210
wallet?

12
00:00:19,239 --> 00:00:20,179
No, I'm kidding.

13
00:00:20,179 --> 00:00:21,539
Of course, we're not doing

14
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:21,890
that.

15
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:23,160
But how do we actually get people

16
00:00:23,329 --> 00:00:24,539
to buy from us once we get them on

17
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:25,120
the phone?

18
00:00:25,129 --> 00:00:26,980
The sales process.

19
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:29,219
This is so not complex, so

20
00:00:29,219 --> 00:00:31,089
straightforward.

21
00:00:31,089 --> 00:00:32,579
Do not get caught up in

22
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:34,820
all the sales tactics and all this

23
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:35,399
shit.

24
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:36,609
It is so simple.

25
00:00:36,609 --> 00:00:38,740
And really, as long as you're

26
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:41,630
not mentally disabled, this should

27
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:43,009
be easy for you.

28
00:00:43,009 --> 00:00:45,729
Sales, after you have your first

29
00:00:45,729 --> 00:00:45,789
few

30
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:47,179
calls, you're going to be fine.

31
00:00:47,179 --> 00:00:47,950
It's literally just a

32
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:49,570
conversation, just like, hey, what

33
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:49,700
do

34
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:50,140
you need?

35
00:00:50,299 --> 00:00:51,329
What are you struggling with?

36
00:00:51,429 --> 00:00:52,679
Oh, okay, you're struggling with

37
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:52,939
this?

38
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:53,689
Cool, I do

39
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:54,049
this.

40
00:00:54,049 --> 00:00:55,350
I think I'll be able to help with

41
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:55,710
that.

42
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:56,549
Here's how I do it.

43
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:57,399
And then they're

44
00:00:57,409 --> 00:00:59,340
like, okay, well, what about this?

45
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,090
And then you say, oh, yeah, yeah,

46
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:02,219
I can do that.

47
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:02,579
I'd

48
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:04,159
probably do this, this, this.

49
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:05,469
And then if they like what you

50
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,290
say, they'll be like, all right,

51
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:08,909
cool, what's the price?

52
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:10,400
And you drop the price.

53
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,170
That's it.

54
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:11,939
That's it.

55
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:12,920
So let's get into

56
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:13,159
it.

57
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:13,920
Sales mindset.

58
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,370
Sales is not about tricking people

59
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:16,719
or doing crazy sales tactics.

60
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:17,150
It's not

61
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:19,629
the Jordan Belfort fucking, what

62
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:20,730
does he say?

63
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:22,659
That sound fair enough?

64
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:23,540
It's not that

65
00:01:23,609 --> 00:01:23,969
shit.

66
00:01:23,969 --> 00:01:24,230
No.

67
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:25,250
Sales is just made to be so

68
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:26,840
complicated when reality, you're

69
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:27,900
literally just having a

70
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:29,420
conversation with this person,

71
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:30,909
seeing if you get along together

72
00:01:30,909 --> 00:01:31,930
and if they want to buy

73
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:32,609
from you.

74
00:01:32,609 --> 00:01:34,459
Sales is literally just, does the

75
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:35,640
person like you?

76
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,230
Does the person think that

77
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:38,739
you will do a good job for them?

78
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:40,329
If someone likes you and they're

79
00:01:40,329 --> 00:01:41,739
like, he'll do a good job

80
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:42,109
for me.

81
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:43,359
Then duh, they're going to go with

82
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:43,750
you.

83
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:44,980
That's literally all that sales

84
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:45,359
is.

85
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:45,959
So those are

86
00:01:45,969 --> 00:01:47,780
the two things that you just need

87
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:48,790
to understand.

88
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:50,459
So how to get the person to like

89
00:01:50,459 --> 00:01:51,480
you on a call.

90
00:01:51,609 --> 00:01:53,370
Hopefully I do not need to teach

91
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:53,989
you this.

92
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:56,180
Just be personable, be funny, be

93
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,219
kind, transparent,

94
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:59,040
be honest, everything that you'd

95
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,609
expect.

96
00:01:59,609 --> 00:02:01,230
How do you get people to like you

97
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,040
should be pretty

98
00:02:02,659 --> 00:02:03,030
straightforward.

99
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:04,439
For me, I've always been like,

100
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:05,489
this is just my style.

101
00:02:05,489 --> 00:02:06,829
Like if you see me, I'm very

102
00:02:06,849 --> 00:02:07,790
like no bullshit.

103
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:09,310
I'm a little bit, I'm extroverted

104
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,830
on calls and people like feel

105
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:11,460
comfortable and I'm

106
00:02:11,469 --> 00:02:13,110
also very transparent and honest.

107
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:14,629
I'll tell people exactly what it

108
00:02:14,629 --> 00:02:16,229
is, exactly how the situation is

109
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:17,729
and I'll just get along with them

110
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,389
and match their energy and that's

111
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:20,580
just what works for me.

112
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:21,949
And I think I'm not a good, I

113
00:02:21,949 --> 00:02:23,620
don't think I'm a good salesman at

114
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:25,909
all, but I've closed over 200

115
00:02:25,949 --> 00:02:27,550
deals because I think people just

116
00:02:27,729 --> 00:02:28,969
kind of like me and they like my

117
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,759
vibes and they can feel my passion

118
00:02:30,789 --> 00:02:31,569
and my hunger.

119
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,050
And so a lot of them, especially

120
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:34,580
when starting out, like I still

121
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:35,610
have the same energy

122
00:02:35,669 --> 00:02:36,419
when I'm coming in with no

123
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:37,409
experience and jumping on a phone

124
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:37,990
with somebody.

125
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:38,800
I'm like, fuck yeah,

126
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:39,419
no, that's sick.

127
00:02:39,419 --> 00:02:40,250
I think we should do this.

128
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:41,169
I think we should do this

129
00:02:41,189 --> 00:02:42,430
coming up with great ideas and

130
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:43,689
that's how you get people to like

131
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:44,159
you.

132
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:45,680
Just be personable,

133
00:02:45,689 --> 00:02:48,120
be funny, make jokes, be kind, be

134
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,080
transparent, be honest.

135
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,060
Your vibes should be what gets

136
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:52,580
them

137
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:53,379
to like you.

138
00:02:53,379 --> 00:02:55,099
And then you have to actually get

139
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:57,000
a person to believe that you will

140
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:57,650
do a good job

141
00:02:57,669 --> 00:02:58,520
for them.

142
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:00,669
If I'm just a funny guy and I'm a

143
00:03:00,669 --> 00:03:02,819
nice guy, but I don't have any

144
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,139
good ideas about email

145
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,469
marketing and this guy's like,

146
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:06,900
well, what the fuck can you do for

147
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:07,150
me?

148
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:08,419
Then I'm just going to walk away

149
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:09,770
with a friend and not a client.

150
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:11,250
Um, so how to get them to believe

151
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:12,530
that you can do a good job for

152
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:12,919
them.

153
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:13,879
One, give them good advice on the

154
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:14,169
call.

155
00:03:14,289 --> 00:03:15,050
They're like, Hey, I'm struggling

156
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:15,780
with this.

157
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:17,020
Then you can say, what if you

158
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:17,639
tried this?

159
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:18,680
Give them a good idea.

160
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,199
And then if they're like, Oh yeah,

161
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:20,780
that's a good idea.

162
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:21,539
Then boom, they're going to

163
00:03:21,539 --> 00:03:22,439
believe that you do a good job for

164
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:22,710
them.

165
00:03:22,939 --> 00:03:23,090
So give

166
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,080
them good advice on a call.

167
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,599
What I like to do is have a really

168
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,419
well put together document on your

169
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,860
process and philosophies.

170
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,310
This document is going to do the

171
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,280
selling for you.

172
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,930
That literal document that I

173
00:03:32,949 --> 00:03:33,990
showed you in the, in the

174
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:35,430
marketing video can literally just

175
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:35,979
do that.

176
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:36,879
And when somebody books a call

177
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:37,000
with

178
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:38,259
you'd be like, read this document,

179
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:39,300
read this document, read this

180
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,259
document, make the document

181
00:03:40,409 --> 00:03:41,360
full of life, make it fun.

182
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,400
And then people will come to the

183
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,650
call being like, Oh, this guy's,

184
00:03:43,669 --> 00:03:44,819
this guy knows his shit.

185
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:46,159
Um, and also he has some life to

186
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:46,539
them.

187
00:03:46,539 --> 00:03:47,460
I like his style.

188
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:48,379
I literally have

189
00:03:48,409 --> 00:03:50,569
had that document just sell people

190
00:03:50,569 --> 00:03:52,800
like on the service just already.

191
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,520
They're like, damn, I like

192
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:54,969
this style.

193
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:55,490
This is funny.

194
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:56,259
This is, this is good.

195
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:57,219
It seems like he knows what he's

196
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:57,599
doing.

197
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:58,360
He he's,

198
00:03:58,370 --> 00:03:59,669
he's getting the fuck after it.

199
00:03:59,669 --> 00:04:00,689
And that will do a lot of the

200
00:04:00,689 --> 00:04:01,580
selling for you.

201
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:02,400
I literally

202
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:04,020
have had multiple closes where

203
00:04:04,189 --> 00:04:06,020
people almost every single call.

204
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,460
When I was using that document,

205
00:04:07,469 --> 00:04:08,719
people were like, love that

206
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:09,300
document.

207
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,300
That that was great.

208
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:10,699
I read it.

209
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,689
I read all of it.

210
00:04:11,699 --> 00:04:12,189
I was like,

211
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:12,879
hell yeah.

212
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,460
Um, and so put something really

213
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,960
good together like that.

214
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,920
Um, and then also respond fast

215
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:19,000
to these people over email and

216
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,199
messages to prove you're on top of

217
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:20,740
your shit.

218
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:22,060
Uh, this is an indicator

219
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:23,259
of you moving fast.

220
00:04:23,259 --> 00:04:24,819
People want results fast.

221
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,569
They want shit to be done fast.

222
00:04:26,569 --> 00:04:27,779
A lot of agencies and

223
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:29,269
freelancers out there, they take

224
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:30,269
forever to do stuff.

225
00:04:30,269 --> 00:04:31,879
So if you are responding instantly

226
00:04:31,889 --> 00:04:32,180
to all

227
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:33,430
their emails and text messages,

228
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:34,660
they're gonna be like, Oh, then

229
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:35,670
that's a sign to them that

230
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:36,730
subconsciously, like this guy

231
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:37,170
moves fast.

232
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:38,100
He's going to get our shit done

233
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:38,300
fast.

234
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:39,100
So that's what we want.

235
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:40,430
And then also clearly outline

236
00:04:40,889 --> 00:04:42,220
exactly what you will do for them

237
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,339
and on what timeline.

238
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:44,949
That is how a person will believe

239
00:04:45,129 --> 00:04:46,579
that you will actually get the

240
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,170
shit done in a certain amount

241
00:04:48,209 --> 00:04:48,829
of time.

242
00:04:48,829 --> 00:04:50,459
You need to show exactly what

243
00:04:50,459 --> 00:04:52,420
you're doing on what timeline on

244
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:53,120
this day.

245
00:04:53,269 --> 00:04:53,920
I'm going to do

246
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:54,720
this on this day.

247
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,120
I'm going to do this on this day.

248
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,069
I'm going to do this.

249
00:04:57,069 --> 00:04:57,740
You need to lay

250
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,930
this out so clearly for the

251
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:02,569
prospect that they don't have any

252
00:05:02,939 --> 00:05:05,220
questions about what you're going

253
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,069
to do for them.

254
00:05:06,129 --> 00:05:07,750
One of the biggest problems I see

255
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,459
miss beginners make on sales is

256
00:05:09,459 --> 00:05:10,399
they're like,

257
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:11,519
yeah, I'll do your email

258
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:12,160
marketing.

259
00:05:12,209 --> 00:05:13,569
Yeah, we'll, we'll do this.

260
00:05:13,569 --> 00:05:15,000
Uh, it'll take a, take a couple

261
00:05:15,009 --> 00:05:15,629
months.

262
00:05:15,629 --> 00:05:17,509
Um, no, you need to literally tell

263
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,829
them, okay, day one, I'm going to

264
00:05:19,829 --> 00:05:20,899
do this day two.

265
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,060
I'm

266
00:05:21,069 --> 00:05:22,189
going to do this day three.

267
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:23,389
I'm going to do this day four.

268
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:24,279
I'm going to do this.

269
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:25,199
Tell them literally

270
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:26,300
fucking everything.

271
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,730
Show them a calendar of like, once

272
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:29,500
you understand their situation,

273
00:05:29,509 --> 00:05:30,420
you know what you want to do for

274
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:30,680
them.

275
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,579
Show them a calendar of the due

276
00:05:31,589 --> 00:05:32,600
dates of every single thing

277
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:33,750
that you were going to do.

278
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,089
And that's how you approve to them

279
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,589
and get them to believe that,

280
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:37,790
oh, this guy's actually going to

281
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:38,990
get this stuff done for them, for

282
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:39,129
me.

283
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:40,089
Um, and then as long as

284
00:05:40,149 --> 00:05:41,459
your philosophies are good, you

285
00:05:41,459 --> 00:05:42,670
give them good advice, they like

286
00:05:42,899 --> 00:05:44,279
your ideas, then they're going to

287
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:44,370
be

288
00:05:44,389 --> 00:05:45,459
like, okay, well, I like his

289
00:05:45,459 --> 00:05:45,750
ideas.

290
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:46,870
I trust that he's going to do good

291
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:47,199
work.

292
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:48,120
And then this is the work

293
00:05:48,129 --> 00:05:48,920
he's doing.

294
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,819
I don't have any uncertainty and I

295
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:51,750
like this guy.

296
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:52,540
Let's do it.

297
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,259
That's exactly everything

298
00:05:54,269 --> 00:05:55,199
that we need.

299
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:56,769
So now let's get into like the

300
00:05:57,019 --> 00:05:58,629
actual process of the sales

301
00:05:58,629 --> 00:06:00,399
process in terms of what's the

302
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:01,889
flow of somebody going from

303
00:06:02,189 --> 00:06:03,850
interested in you to then booking

304
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:05,720
a call in or interested in you to

305
00:06:05,779 --> 00:06:06,019
then

306
00:06:06,029 --> 00:06:08,199
they paid and you have money in

307
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:10,370
your account and you can go buy

308
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,399
your first fucking Rolex or

309
00:06:12,589 --> 00:06:13,240
something.

310
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,670
Um, so here's the flow.

311
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:16,430
The lead books a call with you.

312
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:18,060
You warm them up ahead of the

313
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:18,399
calls.

314
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:20,480
You have two calls, they get

315
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,660
closed and then onboarded.

316
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,399
This is how it looks.

317
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:25,389
Call booked via

318
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:26,189

319
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,639
Get a Calendly account.

320
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:29,209
It's just a way for you to have

00:06:29,209 --> 00:06:30,180
people book in.

322
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:31,420
Um, it allows you to

323
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:32,750
send automated emails of

324
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:33,569
reminders.

325
00:06:33,569 --> 00:06:35,459
It allows you to set up workflows.

326
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,240
Um, so ours right here is just

327
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:37,699
like

328
00:06:37,709 --> 00:06:38,430
this.

329
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:41,459
If you can see it, boom, just like

330
00:06:41,459 --> 00:06:43,550
this discovery call.

331
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,170
This call will be discussing

332
00:06:46,189 --> 00:06:47,009
where you're at with your brand,

333
00:06:47,069 --> 00:06:47,550
where you want to be.

334
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:48,339
And if you're right, if we're

335
00:06:48,339 --> 00:06:48,920
right fit to get

336
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:50,120
you there, I have a quick doc

337
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,129
answering some FAQs.

338
00:06:51,129 --> 00:06:52,129
And then this is just the

339
00:06:52,129 --> 00:06:52,680
calendar.

340
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,279
And we asked

341
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:54,709
some questions just about the

342
00:06:54,709 --> 00:06:56,449
brand and everything right here.

343
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:57,810
So somebody is going to book a

344
00:06:57,810 --> 00:06:58,089
call

345
00:06:58,110 --> 00:06:59,199
right here.

346
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:00,100
Oh my God.

347
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,470
Where the fuck did the document

348
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:02,920
go?

349
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,750
Why do I keep losing it?

350
00:07:04,889 --> 00:07:05,800
There we go.

351
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:07,129
Um, that's so call book via

352
00:07:07,129 --> 00:07:07,829
Calendly.

353
00:07:07,829 --> 00:07:09,230
They get the call booked.

354
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:10,620
You want to have an automated

355
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,129
email

356
00:07:11,149 --> 00:07:12,759
and send a document like I'd

357
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:14,379
showed you before of this.

358
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:16,399
I'm going to pull it up again.

359
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:17,259
Some sort of

360
00:07:17,269 --> 00:07:18,529
document that goes over your

361
00:07:18,529 --> 00:07:19,060
process.

362
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,500
Something like this, where I just

363
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,060
did a Google doc, just walking

364
00:07:22,069 --> 00:07:23,560
through all of my philosophies,

365
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:24,509
exactly what I do.

366
00:07:24,509 --> 00:07:25,870
Some of my case studies, how I

367
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:26,699
think about email

368
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,269
marketing, how it's supposed to

369
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:29,730
run, everything like that.

370
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:31,279
You want a document like this to,

371
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:32,769
to show some life and to prove

372
00:07:32,889 --> 00:07:34,509
that you know what you're doing

373
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:36,110
and to warm this person up.

374
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:36,500
So it's

375
00:07:36,509 --> 00:07:38,050
not like this dude's just like a

376
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:38,560
nobody.

377
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,110
And ideally have it be a video as

378
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:40,509
well.

379
00:07:40,509 --> 00:07:41,329
Give them a document

380
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:42,639
and then give them the video as

381
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:43,819
well to show your face, show that

382
00:07:43,819 --> 00:07:44,629
you're a real person and

383
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,180
everything

384
00:07:45,189 --> 00:07:46,449
like that and outline your

385
00:07:46,449 --> 00:07:47,029
process.

386
00:07:47,029 --> 00:07:48,670
And then case studies, if you have

387
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:50,699
them say it is required to read

388
00:07:50,709 --> 00:07:51,839
ahead of the call to make the best

389
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:52,850
use of the time on the call.

390
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:54,930
So in a follow-up email, um, after

391
00:07:54,939 --> 00:07:55,120
somebody

392
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:56,449
books, make sure an automated

393
00:07:56,449 --> 00:07:57,560
email gets sent to them and say

394
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,790
like, you need to check out this

395
00:07:58,839 --> 00:07:59,100
video,

396
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:00,379
watch it, yada, yada, yada.

397
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:01,569
If somebody, if you book somebody

398
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:03,329
in manually, send them the

399
00:08:03,339 --> 00:08:03,759
document in

400
00:08:03,769 --> 00:08:04,839
the video and say, please watch

401
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:05,560
this ahead of time.

402
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,610
So you have an understanding of

403
00:08:06,629 --> 00:08:07,319
our process and we

404
00:08:07,329 --> 00:08:08,600
can make the best use of time on

405
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,110
the call.

406
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,339
We can just talk about you and

407
00:08:10,339 --> 00:08:11,290
your situation.

408
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:11,620
So I can

409
00:08:11,649 --> 00:08:13,129
build you a tailored plan, uh, for

410
00:08:13,129 --> 00:08:14,519
how I might be able to help you.

411
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:16,759
So we have that super important.

412
00:08:16,769 --> 00:08:18,069
Once I implemented this into my

413
00:08:18,069 --> 00:08:19,259
process, my close rates

414
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:21,980
skyrocketed, super important.

415
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:23,750
Um, and then what we have here is

416
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:23,889
then

417
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:25,240
you have call one discovery.

418
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,610
I like to do two call close.

419
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:29,480
It's going to be very difficult to

420
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,230
close people

421
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,069
in one call.

422
00:08:31,129 --> 00:08:32,759
Um, so just expect that it's

423
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,879
probably going to be two calls.

424
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:36,529
Um, and yeah, call one is

425
00:08:36,548 --> 00:08:38,288
just discovery, um, 30 minute

426
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:38,860
meeting.

427
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:40,460
Some people do 15 minutes.

428
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,418
Some people do an hour, whatever

429
00:08:42,418 --> 00:08:42,538
you

430
00:08:42,548 --> 00:08:42,798
want.

431
00:08:42,798 --> 00:08:43,809
I've set it at 30 minutes.

432
00:08:43,809 --> 00:08:44,809
You just want to figure out their

433
00:08:44,809 --> 00:08:45,049
pain.

434
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,299
I don't really like that idea

435
00:08:46,309 --> 00:08:47,919
because I really don't think you

436
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:49,340
need to dig in like too deep to

437
00:08:49,379 --> 00:08:49,789
pain.

438
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:52,980
Like everybody talks about that,

439
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:53,759
but figure out their pain.

440
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,639
What are they struggling with?

441
00:08:54,649 --> 00:08:55,899
What are they looking for?

442
00:08:55,899 --> 00:08:57,669
Lightly introduce your process and

443
00:08:57,669 --> 00:08:59,710
get a second call booked to talk

444
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:00,889
through the strategy you would

445
00:09:00,889 --> 00:09:01,600
employ for them.

446
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,870
Ideally get access to their email

447
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:03,580
platform to run

448
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:05,210
an audit if they have an account.

449
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:06,690
And so that's typically what we

450
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:07,039
do.

451
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:08,340
We'll have a call one,

452
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:10,820
figure out, okay, what's going on.

453
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,759
Can we actually help you?

454
00:09:12,789 --> 00:09:14,240
If we can help you,

455
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:15,740
let's actually run an audit of

456
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:16,570
your account.

457
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:18,200
So we can tell you exactly what we

458
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,049
think we would do for

459
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:19,450
you.

460
00:09:19,649 --> 00:09:20,960
And then we get a, we get the

461
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,870
access to their account in between

462
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:24,340
calls, run an audit of their

463
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:24,779
account.

464
00:09:24,909 --> 00:09:25,889
You're fucking up with this.

465
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:27,019
You're fucking up with this.

466
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,240
You're fucking up with this.

467
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:28,740
I would

468
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:29,879
fix this by doing this, fix this

469
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:30,360
by doing this.

470
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:31,570
This is how much money I can make

471
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:31,830
you.

472
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:32,210
Then you

473
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:33,460
present that on the second call

474
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:34,639
and you really go over like the

475
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:36,059
set in stone pricing in the plan

476
00:09:36,059 --> 00:09:36,250
and

477
00:09:36,269 --> 00:09:37,590
what it looks like.

478
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:39,830
So call one should literally just

479
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:42,299
flow like, Hey, nice to meet you,

480
00:09:42,299 --> 00:09:43,399
but have some

481
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:43,870
small talk.

482
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:44,720
And it's like, all right, why

483
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,529
don't you just tell me a little

484
00:09:45,529 --> 00:09:46,009
bit about your

485
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:46,639
situation.

486
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:47,840
Um, and kind of, we'll take it

487
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:49,169
from there and then they'll start

488
00:09:49,169 --> 00:09:50,210
talking like, okay,

489
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:51,840
we've had a brand since dah, dah,

490
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:52,460
dah, dah.

491
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:53,629
We've been doing this.

492
00:09:53,629 --> 00:09:55,169
Um, and we're having a hard time

493
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:56,889
with this, uh, dah, dah, dah.

494
00:09:57,029 --> 00:09:58,629
And then you're like, Oh, okay.

495
00:09:58,629 --> 00:10:00,070
Um, so just on, so you're doing

496
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:00,679
this

497
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:02,169
and you're struggling with this.

498
00:10:02,169 --> 00:10:03,570
Could you go a little bit, tell me

499
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:04,779
a little bit more about how

500
00:10:04,809 --> 00:10:06,129
you're struggling with like your

501
00:10:06,129 --> 00:10:07,289
email marketing flows?

502
00:10:07,289 --> 00:10:08,789
Like, um, have you worked, are you

503
00:10:08,789 --> 00:10:09,070
currently

504
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:09,799
working with someone?

505
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,379
What's that like?

506
00:10:10,379 --> 00:10:11,360
And then they're going to be like,

507
00:10:11,379 --> 00:10:12,570
Oh, well, we worked with

508
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:14,009
somebody, uh, like a year ago,

509
00:10:14,009 --> 00:10:15,110
they set up our flows and you

510
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:16,870
know, they're just not performing

511
00:10:16,889 --> 00:10:18,029
as well, um, as we want.

512
00:10:18,029 --> 00:10:19,330
So that's why we're looking and

513
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:20,470
why I like book this call.

514
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:20,779
And they're

515
00:10:20,789 --> 00:10:21,610
like, okay, perfect.

516
00:10:21,669 --> 00:10:22,779
So like the main, main thing that

517
00:10:22,779 --> 00:10:23,980
you're struggling with is like the

518
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:24,269
flows.

519
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:24,620
Um,

520
00:10:24,629 --> 00:10:25,889
and you just kind of want the flow

521
00:10:25,889 --> 00:10:26,250
set up.

522
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:26,629
Got it.

523
00:10:26,629 --> 00:10:27,960
Um, so like what, so like, I'd be

524
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,659
curious to see

525
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:29,879
like exactly what you're looking

526
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,110
for in the flows, uh, compared to

527
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:32,440
what, like you don't have just so

528
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:32,519
I

529
00:10:32,529 --> 00:10:33,480
can like be sure that like, you

530
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,480
know, and then you're just like

531
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,299
understanding like, okay, what is

532
00:10:36,299 --> 00:10:36,460
this

533
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:36,879
person?

534
00:10:37,059 --> 00:10:38,059
What, what don't they like and

535
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:38,820
what do they want?

536
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,070
That's all you're trying to find

537
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:40,299
out.

538
00:10:40,309 --> 00:10:41,440
What do they want?

539
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,110
And once you kind of figure out

540
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:44,960
what they want and you have a full

541
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,759
understanding of

542
00:10:45,769 --> 00:10:47,379
their process and the business and

543
00:10:47,549 --> 00:10:48,990
kind of where they want to go,

544
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,529
then you're, then you just go

545
00:10:50,549 --> 00:10:51,450
into, okay, got it.

00:10:52,769 --> 00:10:54,019
everything that you're looking

548
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:54,419
for.

549
00:10:54,419 --> 00:10:56,299
Um, and so

550
00:10:56,309 --> 00:10:57,330
yeah, is there like anything else

551
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:58,259
you want to add or anything else

552
00:10:58,259 --> 00:10:59,149

00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,389
Um, something that I think would

574
00:11:25,409 --> 00:11:27,059
be super helpful if you're open to

575
00:11:27,059 --> 00:11:27,259
it.

576
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:28,480
So I can create like a custom

577
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,590
tailored plan for you.

578
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:31,299
So if you're open to it, I'd love

579
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:31,679
to run a

580
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:32,950
review of your current flow

581
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:33,429
system.

582
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:34,919
Um, and kind of like give you then

583
00:11:35,059 --> 00:11:37,139
like a tailored roadmap in

584
00:11:37,149 --> 00:11:38,299
strategy of what I'd like to do

585
00:11:38,299 --> 00:11:38,710
for you.

586
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,940
And then we could go over that on

587
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,679
a call, say like middle

588
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:42,990
of next week, if that's something

589
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:43,830
that you're open to.

590
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:45,080
And then they'll be like, yeah,

591
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:45,899
that'd be great.

592
00:11:45,909 --> 00:11:47,340
And you're like, okay, perfect.

593
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:47,820
Awesome.

594
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:48,340
Thank you.

595
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,129
Thank you so much.

596
00:11:49,139 --> 00:11:50,000
So just add me to your

597
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:51,009
Klaviyo, add me to your email

598
00:11:51,009 --> 00:11:52,240
marketing account, yada, yada,

599
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:52,960
yada, do this.

600
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,740
I'll review everything in

601
00:11:54,769 --> 00:11:55,659
between calls.

602
00:11:55,659 --> 00:11:57,289
And then they'll be like, okay,

603
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:57,799
great.

604
00:11:57,830 --> 00:11:59,259
Um, what I like to do is also

605
00:11:59,259 --> 00:11:59,879
briefly run

606
00:11:59,909 --> 00:12:01,210
through the process as well on

607
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:02,429
this call, just so they're not

608
00:12:02,659 --> 00:12:04,200
surprised on the follow-up call.

609
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:05,669
And then you can gauge like their,

610
00:12:05,669 --> 00:12:07,019
um, gauge like how interested

611
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:08,480
there are, they are right now.

612
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:08,799
So

613
00:12:08,809 --> 00:12:09,960
I'd be something like, yeah, so

614
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,080
for a flow rebuild, just to walk

615
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,389
you through like a little bit of

616
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:12,620
what,

617
00:12:12,629 --> 00:12:13,279
what it is.

618
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:14,899
Um, so usually it's a 60 day

619
00:12:14,899 --> 00:12:15,500
process.

620
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,159
And so in the first seven days,

621
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:17,649
what we're doing is

622
00:12:17,669 --> 00:12:19,100
we're mapping out the strategy for

623
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,509
you and like figuring out exactly

624
00:12:20,529 --> 00:12:21,879
what emails do we want to send?

625
00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:22,490
Um,

626
00:12:22,649 --> 00:12:23,950
what are the topics of each emails

627
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:25,149
and mapping them out across the

628
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:26,779
welcome flow, all the abandonments

629
00:12:26,809 --> 00:12:27,480
post-purchase.

630
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,419
And then we're going to go over

631
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:29,690
that and share that strategy with

632
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:29,990
you.

633
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:30,679
That's usually the

634
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:31,419
first seven days.

635
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,529
That's what we call analyze.

636
00:12:32,529 --> 00:12:33,549
We then move to the next phase

637
00:12:33,549 --> 00:12:34,440
where it's actually

638
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:35,600
creating all these emails.

639
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,889
So we got to write these emails.

640
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:37,679
We got to design them.

641
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:38,580
Um, we got to send

642
00:12:38,629 --> 00:12:39,950
them over to you for review.

643
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:41,509
Um, and then we got to upload them

644
00:12:41,509 --> 00:12:43,309
into Klaviyo and get them, uh, get

645
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:44,389
them all set live and quality

646
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:44,820
checked.

647
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,049
And so that's usually the bulk of

648
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:46,350
this.

649
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:47,049
It's going to be

650
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:48,309
every single email we're sending

651
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:48,710
it to you.

652
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,950
Um, and usually this process is

653
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,740
going to take around

654
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,049
like 45 days for everything to be

655
00:12:52,049 --> 00:12:52,509
all set up.

656
00:12:52,529 --> 00:12:53,509
We're going to start with the

657
00:12:53,509 --> 00:12:54,159
welcome flow,

658
00:12:54,169 --> 00:12:55,250
the most important flow.

659
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:56,500
And we'll send that over to you by

660
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,049
day 14.

661
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,460
You'll receive a new flow every

662
00:12:58,490 --> 00:12:59,309
couple of days.

663
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:00,940
Um, and then we'll make revisions

664
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:02,399
as you have them usually by day

665
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,320
45, day 50, we're all

666
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:05,629
set up and we're just finishing

667
00:13:05,629 --> 00:13:06,820
getting emails uploaded into

668
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:07,360
Klaviyo.

669
00:13:07,389 --> 00:13:08,769
And we kind of have an extra two

670
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:10,279
weeks there, uh, just in case some

671
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:11,559
flows are taking a little bit

672
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:12,009
longer.

673
00:13:12,019 --> 00:13:13,200
And then also we can use this

674
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:14,529
time to set up some AB tests for

675
00:13:14,549 --> 00:13:14,850
you.

676
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:16,360
And that's usually what the last

677
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,580
little push in this product

678
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:18,889
project is, is reviewing some of

679
00:13:18,889 --> 00:13:20,049
the initial numbers and getting

680
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:21,259
some of those AB tests.

681
00:13:21,269 --> 00:13:22,570
So that's typically like what the

682
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:24,000
process and timeline looks like.

683
00:13:24,019 --> 00:13:24,980
As far as like that is,

684
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:25,799
are you clear on that?

685
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:26,840
Do you have any questions with

686
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,129
that?

687
00:13:27,129 --> 00:13:28,529
And then they'd, if they have

688
00:13:28,529 --> 00:13:29,320
questions,

689
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:30,500
simply answer the questions.

690
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,750
And then they're probably going to

691
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,000
ask, yeah, like what's the pricing

692
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:33,259
like?

693
00:13:33,269 --> 00:13:34,879
Some people will be like, I'll

694
00:13:35,049 --> 00:13:36,500
give, some people will tell you

695
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,379
like, Hey, don't, don't give the

696
00:13:38,389 --> 00:13:38,679
price.

697
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:39,529
But dude, if someone asks a

698
00:13:39,529 --> 00:13:40,580
question, like give them, give

699
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:41,259
them an answer.

700
00:13:41,259 --> 00:13:42,419
I usually give them a range

701
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:42,820
though.

702
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,009
Uh, so if somebody is like, like,

703
00:13:44,029 --> 00:13:44,990
yeah, like how much is this?

704
00:13:45,179 --> 00:13:45,950
And then you'll say something

705
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:47,759
like, yeah, so for a two month, 60

706
00:13:47,769 --> 00:13:49,220
day flow rebuild project, I'll be

707
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,809
able to give you an exact number

708
00:13:51,009 --> 00:13:52,070
after I run a review on the

709
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:52,590
account.

710
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:53,980
Um, and like the exact strategy

711
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:55,419
that I want to use once I have a

712
00:13:55,429 --> 00:13:56,490
sense of the workload, but

713
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:57,889
typically for a flow rebuild, it's

714
00:13:57,889 --> 00:13:59,259
going to be anywhere from five to

715
00:13:59,269 --> 00:14:00,460
$7,000.

716
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:02,149
And we can split that up into two

717
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,610
time payments as well.

718
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:05,549
Um, if, uh, if you prefer that

719
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:07,720
and then just, and then just drop

720
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,070
that.

721
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,389
And then they might be like, most

722
00:14:10,509 --> 00:14:11,909
of the time they'll be

723
00:14:11,929 --> 00:14:13,039
like, okay, sounds good.

724
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:14,250
Looking forward to what you have

725
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:14,610
to say.

726
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:17,399
And then boom, then after that

727
00:14:17,409 --> 00:14:19,580
first call, follow up email, send

728
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:21,320
them a follow up email, just

729
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,340
recap, just same day as fast as

730
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:23,440
you

731
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:24,929
can after that call, just to prove

732
00:14:25,029 --> 00:14:26,529
you're on top of your shit, send a

733
00:14:26,539 --> 00:14:27,909
recap and confirm the second

734
00:14:27,929 --> 00:14:29,120
call for a tailored proposal.

735
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,139
Make sure you get that on the

736
00:14:30,139 --> 00:14:30,720
calendar.

737
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,960
On that first call,

738
00:14:32,009 --> 00:14:33,919
be like, okay, does Wednesday 9am

739
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:34,330
work?

740
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:35,840
Get that call scheduled while

741
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,190
you're on that first call

742
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:38,519
so that they don't ghost you.

743
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:39,960
Um, and ideally get the access to

744
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,090
their Klaviyo account.

745
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:41,559
If they

746
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:43,379
don't have an account, that's

747
00:14:43,379 --> 00:14:43,840
fine.

748
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,409
You can create a process or

749
00:14:45,409 --> 00:14:47,299
strategy just based on like what

750
00:14:47,299 --> 00:14:47,580
you

751
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:48,059
know.

752
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:50,100
Um, so send a follow up email, um,

753
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:52,049
and then call two, all it is, is

754
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:53,600
just you presenting the

755
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:55,210
strategy and then going, walking

756
00:14:55,389 --> 00:14:57,070
through again, what the process

757
00:14:57,149 --> 00:14:57,799
looks like.

758
00:14:57,809 --> 00:14:59,500
So simply, Hey John,

759
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:00,690
great to see you again.

760
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:01,490
How are we doing?

761
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:03,129
Um, do anything over the weekend?

762
00:15:03,179 --> 00:15:04,460
It's bullshit.

763
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:04,740
And

764
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:05,889
then, okay, perfect.

765
00:15:05,889 --> 00:15:07,080
Well, thank you so much for

766
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:07,929
jumping back on.

767
00:15:07,929 --> 00:15:09,340
Um, just want to, you know,

768
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:10,309
go over the strategy that I had

769
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:11,159
for you, but I just want to

770
00:15:11,159 --> 00:15:12,340
confirm a couple of things just to

771
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:12,460
make

772
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:13,789
sure, um, that I understand

773
00:15:13,889 --> 00:15:15,179
everything correctly.

774
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:16,600
Recap what you guys had talked

775
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:17,580
about last week,

776
00:15:17,629 --> 00:15:18,789
be like that all kind of like,

777
00:15:18,789 --> 00:15:20,070
everything's still the same for

778
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:20,350
you.

779
00:15:20,379 --> 00:15:21,649
Was there anything else that came

780
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:22,850
up that you want to share?

781
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:23,440
They say no.

782
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:24,789
And then share your screen and go

783
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:25,740
over the strategy that

784
00:15:25,789 --> 00:15:26,980
you put together and then go over

785
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:28,259
what the next 90 days look like

786
00:15:28,259 --> 00:15:29,500
and be like, so the official

787
00:15:29,509 --> 00:15:30,990
price is $6,000.

788
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:32,620
And then, and then just wait.

789
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:34,220
And then maybe they'll be like,

790
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:34,820
Oh, that's too

791
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:35,399
much.

792
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:37,330
Um, then you can be like, what

793
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,980
about it is too much.

794
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,340
Um, and then just talk through it

795
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:41,460
with

796
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:41,809
them.

797
00:15:41,809 --> 00:15:42,799
It's just that simple.

798
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:44,039
Um, and then at the end of it,

799
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,879
just be like, okay, like, do you

800
00:15:45,909 --> 00:15:46,100
want to

801
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:46,519
move forward?

802
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:47,360
Is this something you want to move

803
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:47,750
forward with?

804
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:48,580
And then they might say yes,

805
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:49,919
or I need to think about it,

806
00:15:50,009 --> 00:15:50,649
whatever.

807
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:52,049
That's completely fine.

808
00:15:52,049 --> 00:15:53,450
People are very rare to get

809
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:54,820
them to close directly on the

810
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:55,309
call.

811
00:15:55,309 --> 00:15:55,990
I never push.

812
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:57,879
I'm just like, okay, no problem.

813
00:15:57,879 --> 00:15:58,539
I'll shoot you a

814
00:15:58,549 --> 00:15:59,649
follow-up email, um, with

815
00:15:59,649 --> 00:16:01,009
everything that you need to know,

816
00:16:01,009 --> 00:16:02,379
summarizing everything that we

817
00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:02,570
talked

818
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:04,220
about with this Taylor proposal.

819
00:16:04,389 --> 00:16:05,580
Um, just so you have it.

820
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:07,039
Um, as, as far as like making a

821
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:07,860
decision,

822
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:09,059
like when do you think that you'll

823
00:16:09,059 --> 00:16:09,830
have a decision by?

824
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:11,000
And then they'll tell you when

825
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:11,279
they have a

826
00:16:11,289 --> 00:16:11,870
decision.

827
00:16:11,889 --> 00:16:13,289
Um, and then you can just follow

828
00:16:13,289 --> 00:16:14,129
up on those days.

829
00:16:14,149 --> 00:16:15,320
That's literally it.

830
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:15,730
That's the

831
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:16,340
process.

832
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,980
So as far as like call booking and

833
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,710
warmup, uh, you're going to be as

834
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:20,610
far as like the first

835
00:16:20,649 --> 00:16:21,830
part of the process.

836
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:23,379
So booking the call, um, and

837
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:24,870
warming them up, you will be

838
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:26,019
judged on the

839
00:16:26,149 --> 00:16:27,570
professionalism and smoothness,

840
00:16:27,809 --> 00:16:28,990
smoothness of your call booking

841
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:29,500
process.

842
00:16:29,509 --> 00:16:30,730
Um, so what we want to do is

843
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:31,769
just make it simple, have a

844
00:16:31,769 --> 00:16:32,970
Calendly link, and then an auto

845
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:33,879
confirmation email.

846
00:16:33,879 --> 00:16:34,799
You can set this up in

847
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:35,440
Calendly.

848
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,629
Just, just look it up.

849
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:37,299
Super easy.

850
00:16:37,299 --> 00:16:39,009
Um, and then automated, like what

851
00:16:39,029 --> 00:16:39,940
to expect doc,

852
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:41,289
which we had went over, uh, just

853
00:16:41,289 --> 00:16:42,490
go over like who you are, case

854
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,990
studies, client wins, and then

855
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:44,110
your

856
00:16:44,129 --> 00:16:45,100
process, what do we do?

857
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,309
So the goal is that when they show

858
00:16:46,309 --> 00:16:47,610
up, they already believe you're

859
00:16:47,669 --> 00:16:47,919
credible

860
00:16:47,929 --> 00:16:49,230
and you run a legit business.

861
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:50,679
Um, so that's what we want to do.

862
00:16:50,679 --> 00:16:51,909
And call one discovery.

863
00:16:51,909 --> 00:16:52,590
I literally

864
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:53,590
already went over this.

865
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:54,789
I forgot I had these slides, but

866
00:16:54,789 --> 00:16:56,009
this first call again, it's not

867
00:16:56,009 --> 00:16:56,639
about closing.

868
00:16:56,669 --> 00:16:57,990
You should want them to get the,

869
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:59,190
get to know where they're at and

870
00:16:59,419 --> 00:17:00,759
where they want to go and then how

871
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:01,470
you could fit in.

872
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:02,639
Um, so figure out exactly what

873
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:03,120
they want.

874
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,598
And if you're fit, key questions,

875
00:17:04,609 --> 00:17:05,430
what's got you interested in

876
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:06,430
upgrading email marketing?

877
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:07,348
What have you tried in the past

878
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:07,759
for email?

879
00:17:07,769 --> 00:17:09,410
What's your goal in three to six

880
00:17:09,549 --> 00:17:10,000
months?

881
00:17:10,009 --> 00:17:11,490
Um, so this is what we do.

882
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:12,430
This is the process.

883
00:17:12,509 --> 00:17:13,598
I already kind of went over this

884
00:17:13,598 --> 00:17:14,848
and by booking the follow-up call,

885
00:17:14,848 --> 00:17:15,880
do not leave it open-ended.

886
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:17,630
Always book that follow-up call on

887
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:18,299
that call.

888
00:17:18,299 --> 00:17:19,700
Or if you pitch on that first

889
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:20,160
call,

890
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:21,318
ask, when are you making a

891
00:17:21,318 --> 00:17:22,009
decision by?

892
00:17:22,009 --> 00:17:23,328
Always try to get a second call

893
00:17:23,328 --> 00:17:24,609
booked in the calendar.

894
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:25,950
Now between calls, this is where

895
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:27,509
you prep for your close, send a

896
00:17:27,559 --> 00:17:29,160
short recap email right off the

897
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:29,430
bat

898
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:30,759
to prove that you give a shit

899
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:31,519
about them.

900
00:17:31,529 --> 00:17:33,099
Run that Klaviyo audit, just a

901
00:17:33,099 --> 00:17:34,140
simple slide deck,

902
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:35,640
um, on pain points they told you,

903
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,119
the audit highlights, like what

904
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:38,480
did you notice in their account

905
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:39,809
that you'd like to do better, your

906
00:17:39,829 --> 00:17:40,990
strategy to fix it, and then a

907
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:41,599
roadmap.

908
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:42,440
What do you,

909
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:44,509
what do the 60, 90 day, what, what

910
00:17:44,519 --> 00:17:46,539
do those 60, 90 days look like?

911
00:17:46,539 --> 00:17:47,500
What are the things you're going

912
00:17:47,509 --> 00:17:47,950
to do?

913
00:17:48,099 --> 00:17:49,099
And in what order?

914
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:50,980
And in that confirm, present and

915
00:17:51,049 --> 00:17:51,529
close.

916
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:53,039
Start by confirming.

917
00:17:53,069 --> 00:17:53,720
Last time

918
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:54,740
you mentioned X, Y, Z are the big

919
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:55,369
problems, right?

920
00:17:55,509 --> 00:17:56,230
Anything else you think is

921
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:56,960
relevant to share?

922
00:17:57,089 --> 00:17:57,569
Perfect.

923
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,039
Maybe they talk a little bit about

924
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,319
stuff and then you ask a couple of

925
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:01,089
questions,

926
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:02,049
but then you just share your

927
00:18:02,109 --> 00:18:03,210
screen, walk through your audit,

928
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:04,259
present your 90 day plan,

929
00:18:04,359 --> 00:18:04,930
transition.

930
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:06,289
Does this sound like something

931
00:18:06,289 --> 00:18:07,500
that you're looking for?

932
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,250
Like, is this exactly what

933
00:18:09,309 --> 00:18:10,130
you're looking for?

934
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:11,450
And then they might say, I'm also

935
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:12,190
looking for this.

936
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,289
And then you can be like,

937
00:18:13,309 --> 00:18:13,900
okay, cool.

938
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:14,789
Let's talk about it.

939
00:18:14,789 --> 00:18:16,140
Or maybe they're like, most often

940
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:17,599
they're like, yeah, no, this is

941
00:18:17,609 --> 00:18:17,940
perfect.

942
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:18,690
Thank you for putting this

943
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:19,049
together.

944
00:18:19,049 --> 00:18:20,029
You just want to clear yes or no.

945
00:18:20,029 --> 00:18:20,829
And then just drop the

946
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:21,319
price.

947
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,150
Okay, got it.

948
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:23,730
And so the investment for this is

949
00:18:23,779 --> 00:18:24,849
$6,000.

950
00:18:24,849 --> 00:18:26,019
Don't overthink it.

951
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:28,460
Just the investment is

952
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:30,079
$6,000.

953
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:32,279
Don't cower in the corner.

954
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:34,809
Just like, no, no, these people

955
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:36,019
have money.

956
00:18:36,039 --> 00:18:37,490
You can always come

957
00:18:37,509 --> 00:18:39,250
down on price if you need to.

958
00:18:39,289 --> 00:18:41,299
But after that, just like drop the

959
00:18:41,299 --> 00:18:43,069
price, $6,000.

960
00:18:43,069 --> 00:18:44,440
And then just wait,

961
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:46,089
wait for them to respond.

962
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:48,119
And then they might be like, oh,

963
00:18:48,119 --> 00:18:49,119
okay, got it.

964
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:50,579
Thank you for, thank you

965
00:18:50,589 --> 00:18:51,150
for sharing.

966
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:52,380
It'll probably take me, I'll need

967
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,339
to think it over, talk to my

968
00:18:53,339 --> 00:18:54,279
business partner.

969
00:18:54,279 --> 00:18:54,839
And then

970
00:18:54,849 --> 00:18:55,990
you can be like, yeah, yeah, no

971
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:56,390
problem.

972
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:57,599
Like overall, like, what are you

973
00:18:57,599 --> 00:18:58,079
thinking?

974
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:58,539
Like, is

975
00:18:58,549 --> 00:18:59,859
like, as far as like the process

976
00:18:59,859 --> 00:19:01,549
price and everything, like kind of

977
00:19:01,549 --> 00:19:02,509
where are you at?

978
00:19:02,509 --> 00:19:02,950
And

979
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:03,900
then maybe they'll be like, and

980
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:04,839
then they'll tell you what their

981
00:19:04,839 --> 00:19:05,400
objections are.

982
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:05,759
And then

983
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:06,980
you always want to ask, when do

984
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,240
you expect to make a decision?

985
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,490
When should I expect this?

986
00:19:09,509 --> 00:19:10,549
Instead of follow up email

987
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:11,880
outlining the offer and follow up

988
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,759
every day until they close, which

989
00:19:13,789 --> 00:19:15,619
means you, they sign the contract.

990
00:19:15,619 --> 00:19:17,019
That means that they close.

991
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,880
After the close, they say,

992
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:20,359
let's do it.

993
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,480
So maybe on that call, they'll be

994
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:22,190
like, let's do it.

995
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:23,019
Let's work together.

996
00:19:23,019 --> 00:19:23,380
And

997
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:25,849
then you will, then that is send

998
00:19:25,849 --> 00:19:27,809
the invoice and contract

999
00:19:27,849 --> 00:19:29,160
immediately.

1000
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,450
And so that's what

1001
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:32,069
officially does the close.

1002
00:19:32,069 --> 00:19:33,529
They might close over email.

1003
00:19:33,579 --> 00:19:35,059
They're like, sounds good.

1004
00:19:35,079 --> 00:19:35,359
Send

1005
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:36,380
me the, send me the contract.

1006
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:37,480
We decide we want to move forward.

1007
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:38,380
And that's what you want

1008
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:38,829
to do.

1009
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:40,640
We want to send the invoice, the

1010
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,400
contract.

1011
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,390
I use PandaDoc.

1012
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:44,019
You can have ChatGPT to make

1013
00:19:44,029 --> 00:19:44,680
you a contract.

1014
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,640
Don't overcomplicate it.

1015
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:46,980
You can ask some other people what

1016
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:47,700
their contracts

1017
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:48,339
are like.

1018
00:19:48,339 --> 00:19:50,210
And then once somebody does that,

1019
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:51,980
they sign the contract, pay the

1020
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:53,519
invoice, which

1021
00:19:53,529 --> 00:19:54,349
I use Stripe for.

1022
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:55,880
Have a simple onboarding form.

1023
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,490
Ask for brand info, assets, brand

1024
00:19:57,490 --> 00:19:57,970
story,

1025
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:58,809
everything like that.

1026
00:19:58,869 --> 00:19:59,980
And then book a kickoff call to go

1027
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:01,200
over that form and then start the

1028
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:01,640
process.

1029
00:20:01,779 --> 00:20:02,529
And the goal is to make the

1030
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:03,730
transition frictionless so that

1031
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,420
they feel confident immediately.

1032
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:06,539
Just like that.

1033
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:08,660
Contract, then onboarding form to

1034
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:09,920
get them going.

1035
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:11,980
And common sales mistakes.

1036
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:13,519
Here's what kills beginners in

1037
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:14,130
sales.

1038
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:15,450
Calls right off the bat.

1039
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:17,079
Talking more than you listen.

1040
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,160
Just like yapping.

1041
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:18,900
Don't yap.

1042
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:21,680
If you find yourself on a long

1043
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,279
monologue,

1044
00:20:22,289 --> 00:20:23,400
shut the hell up.

1045
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,359
Just listen and ask questions.

1046
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:27,269
You just want to ask questions.

1047
00:20:27,349 --> 00:20:28,099
And then if they

1048
00:20:28,109 --> 00:20:29,990
have questions for you, then you

1049
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:30,869
answer them.

1050
00:20:30,869 --> 00:20:32,809
But listen more than you talk.

1051
00:20:32,809 --> 00:20:34,039
Pitching before

1052
00:20:34,049 --> 00:20:35,250
you understand their problems.

1053
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:36,480
You don't want to pitch too early.

1054
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,799
You need to understand fully

1055
00:20:37,809 --> 00:20:39,230
what exactly their problems are

1056
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:40,680
and summarize their problems in

1057
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,940
one sentence before you go

1058
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:42,769
to the pitch or anything.

1059
00:20:42,829 --> 00:20:44,119
It's like, okay, got it.

1060
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:45,660
So like overall, you're working

1061
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:46,390
with an agency,

1062
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:47,730
but you're kind of not confident

1063
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:49,440
that they're bringing you the best

1064
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:49,890
results

1065
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:52,759
because they're not sending quite

1066
00:20:52,759 --> 00:20:54,359
enough emails and the flows are

1067
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:55,539
just not being optimized.

1068
00:20:55,539 --> 00:20:55,700
And

1069
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:56,529
they're kind of just like set and

1070
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:56,940
forget.

1071
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:57,859
And then boom.

1072
00:20:57,859 --> 00:20:58,940
And then they're like, yeah,

1073
00:20:59,079 --> 00:20:59,960
that's it.

1074
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:01,240
And they're like, okay, perfect.

1075
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,039
So this is what we do.

1076
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:03,730
Being vague on deliverables and

1077
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:04,569
pricing.

1078
00:21:04,569 --> 00:21:06,250
Don't be vague on what you're

1079
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:06,569
doing.

1080
00:21:06,579 --> 00:21:07,660
Tell them exactly what

1081
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:08,960
the fuck they're getting.

1082
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,170
Not asking for the close.

1083
00:21:10,359 --> 00:21:11,690
Not being like, once you drop the

1084
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,220
price,

1085
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:13,470
just letting them go.

1086
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:15,109
Be like, so what do you think?

1087
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,839
Do you want to move forward?

1088
00:21:16,839 --> 00:21:18,400
Get them to

1089
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:19,180
answer that.

1090
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,680
And then letting momentum die

1091
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,579
between calls.

1092
00:21:21,579 --> 00:21:23,269
Do not go rogue in between calls.

1093
00:21:23,319 --> 00:21:23,980
Do not go

1094
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:24,480
silent.

1095
00:21:24,589 --> 00:21:25,950
Send them a follow-up email and

1096
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:27,369
send them even like a call, an

1097
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:28,809
email, personal email leading

1098
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:30,210
up to the next call as well, just

1099
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:31,640
to prove that you give a shit and

1100
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,160
carry that momentum and give them

1101
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:33,599
value.

1102
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:35,180
Sales mindset reminder, sales is

1103
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:36,950
literally just solving problems.

1104
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:38,089
If you do that better than

1105
00:21:38,109 --> 00:21:39,400
anyone else, you will win your

1106
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,250
clients for life.

1107
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:41,339
If you come up with the best

1108
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,200
solutions to their

1109
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:43,670
problems, you will get a sale.

1110
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,299
Everybody has problems and they're

1111
00:21:45,299 --> 00:21:46,519
just looking at who has the

1112
00:21:46,529 --> 00:21:47,740
best solution for my problem.

1113
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:48,720
If you come up with the best

1114
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,009
solutions, you get the sale.

1115
00:21:50,069 --> 00:21:50,970
Confidence,

1116
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:52,349
if you just have confidence in

1117
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:54,160
yourself and you're clever, that's

1118
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,599
way better than clever sales

1119
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:55,940
tricks.

1120
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:57,990
Just like you need to have that

1121
00:21:57,990 --> 00:22:00,089
dog in you to just like be like,

1122
00:22:00,099 --> 00:22:01,789
I'm that fucking guy.

1123
00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:02,160
Like you

1124
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:02,990
have to genuinely think that you

1125
00:22:03,049 --> 00:22:03,809
will do better than anyone.

1126
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:04,940
Cause like, that's one thing that

1127
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:06,140
allowed me to succeed at the

1128
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:07,670
beginning is I genuinely thought I

1129
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:08,880
could do this better than

1130
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:09,250
anyone.

1131
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:10,400
I don't have as much experience,

1132
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,380
but I'm going to figure it the

1133
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:11,910
fuck out.

1134
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:12,839
I'm going to be

1135
00:22:12,849 --> 00:22:14,009
in YouTube, in the YouTube

1136
00:22:14,009 --> 00:22:15,359
trenches, figuring this out.

1137
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:16,730
I'm going to go balls to the wall

1138
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:17,180
for this

1139
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:17,809
client.

1140
00:22:17,809 --> 00:22:19,690
And so that, that confidence goes

1141
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:21,849
and objections are opportunities

1142
00:22:21,849 --> 00:22:23,059
to clarify and push

1143
00:22:23,069 --> 00:22:24,490
the client closer to trusting you.

1144
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:25,529
If the client asks you questions

1145
00:22:25,819 --> 00:22:27,420
or objections, it's not a bad

1146
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:27,619
thing.

1147
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:29,349
Your job is to lead them, not to

1148
00:22:29,349 --> 00:22:30,950
beg them and be like, please work

1149
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:31,579
with me.

1150
00:22:31,579 --> 00:22:32,180
Just like,

1151
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:33,759
this is our process is what we do.

1152
00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:35,069
I think you qualify for it.

1153
00:22:35,069 --> 00:22:36,539
Confident that we can help.

1154
00:22:36,549 --> 00:22:37,980
This is something that you want to

1155
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:38,190
do.

1156
00:22:38,329 --> 00:22:39,430
If it's not like, let's talk

1157
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,180
through it.

1158
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:40,839
That's it.

1159
00:22:40,869 --> 00:22:42,190
You just got to have that dog in

1160
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:42,509
you.

1161
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:43,750
Just got to have that dog.

1162
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:46,859
Shout out Connor for having this

1163
00:22:46,869 --> 00:22:48,109
when he was the sales coach for

1164
00:22:48,109 --> 00:22:49,009
client Ascension.

1165
00:22:49,009 --> 00:22:50,259
When I was in there, he showed

1166
00:22:50,259 --> 00:22:51,220
this graphic a lot

1167
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:52,519
and you just got to have that dog

1168
00:22:52,519 --> 00:22:53,730
in you because clients will sense

1169
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:55,369
it and they want dogs on their

1170
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:55,799
team.

1171
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:56,460
That is it.

1172
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,140
Thank you so much for watching.

1173
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:59,680
Hopefully that was helpful.

1174
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:00,799
And don't overthink

1175
00:23:00,809 --> 00:23:01,250
sales.

1176
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,950
Just have a conversation and bring

1177
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:04,440
good solutions to the table.

1178
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:05,029
Peace.
