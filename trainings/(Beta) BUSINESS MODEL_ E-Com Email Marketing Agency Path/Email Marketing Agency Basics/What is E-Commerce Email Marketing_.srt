1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,509
So what the fuck is e-commerce

2
00:00:02,509 --> 00:00:04,280
email marketing?

3
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:07,290
That is what we are going over

4
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:08,339
today.

5
00:00:08,339 --> 00:00:09,160
Apologies,

6
00:00:09,169 --> 00:00:11,019
I don't have a fancy setup right

7
00:00:11,029 --> 00:00:11,470
now.

8
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:12,560
I'm traveling.

9
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,589
I've been traveling Europe for the

10
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:16,510
past three months and I don't have

11
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:17,899
my regular setup so we are

12
00:00:17,929 --> 00:00:19,480
recording on Loom here.

13
00:00:19,629 --> 00:00:20,280
But that

14
00:00:20,289 --> 00:00:21,660
doesn't matter because this

15
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:22,929
information is going to be

16
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:23,519
amazing.

17
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:24,670
So let's get into it.

18
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:26,170
So we're

19
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:27,879
assuming that you are a beginner

20
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:29,640
in terms of an email marketing

21
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:30,239
agency.

22
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:31,320
Maybe you've gotten

23
00:00:31,329 --> 00:00:32,100
some stuff set up.

24
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,210
Maybe you've gotten a couple

25
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:34,149
clients or maybe you know

26
00:00:34,219 --> 00:00:35,179
absolutely nothing.

27
00:00:35,179 --> 00:00:35,409
But

28
00:00:35,429 --> 00:00:36,810
I'm going to go over what

29
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:38,770
e-commerce email marketing is

30
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:41,219
because Fazio and the guys have

31
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:42,299
asked me to share

32
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:43,500
what I've done because I went

33
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,909
through client ascension, their

34
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:46,229
program, and I learned a lot

35
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:47,280
from them.

36
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,539
And I came in to them at around

37
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:52,259
10k-ish a month a couple years

38
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:52,820
ago.

39
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,109
And now I'll talk about

40
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:55,359
on the next slide, but we do

41
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:57,729
$300,000 a month now at my agency.

42
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:59,299
So my name is Max.

43
00:00:59,299 --> 00:01:00,299
I am 22 years old.

44
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,880
I started all of this not knowing

45
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,939
anything as a freshman, 19 years

46
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:04,980
old in college.

47
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:06,019
Now I'm 22.

48
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:07,700
So it was about three years ago

49
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,310
today where I really started

50
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:10,719
taking this serious.

51
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:11,540
I went to the

52
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:13,260
University of San Diego and I

53
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:15,480
graduated two, three months ago,

54
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,370
May 28th or something.

55
00:01:17,409 --> 00:01:19,650
And I'm making

56
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:20,920
this in late August.

57
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:22,920
And so I graduated, stayed through

58
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:23,519
school.

59
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:25,719
I graduated at around 250k a month

60
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:26,689
in revenue in my company.

61
00:01:26,689 --> 00:01:27,750
And now I'm just traveling Europe

62
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:29,159
and trying to figure out what the

63
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:29,620
hell I want

64
00:01:29,629 --> 00:01:31,219
to do now and where I want to go.

65
00:01:31,239 --> 00:01:32,129
So there's that.

66
00:01:32,129 --> 00:01:34,680
So we do email and SMS, $300,000 a

67
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,439
month in revenue.

68
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:41,930
So that was just under two years

69
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:43,640
ago.

70
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,060
So we've grown a lot.

71
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:50,859
And so here's like me, like for

72
00:01:50,859 --> 00:01:51,900
example, I was doing this all

73
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:52,299
through college.

74
00:01:52,299 --> 00:01:54,310
So here's like here, here's me

75
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:54,799
with some of my boys and then me

76
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:54,799
traveling.

77
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:54,799
I studied abroad as well.

78
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:54,799
So I did this all while studying

79
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:54,799
abroad too in Prague.

80
00:01:54,810 --> 00:02:05,069
And then this was July $309,000 in

81
00:02:05,069 --> 00:02:09,629
revenue on Stripe.

82
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:11,479
So let's get into it.

83
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:12,930
Obviously like this is something

84
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:14,360
that can work because I've done

85
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:14,629
it.

86
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:16,800
And now let's get into what this

87
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:16,800
all is.

88
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:18,189
And so why do brands need email

89
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:19,060
marketing?

90
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:19,979
Sounds stupid.

91
00:02:19,979 --> 00:02:21,360
I don't know if you have ever

92
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,110
bought from an email, but I don't

93
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,159
think I ever have.

94
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:25,659
But people do buy from emails.

95
00:02:25,659 --> 00:02:27,520
And it is a main traffic channel.

96
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,800
Why do brands need email

97
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,120
marketing?

98
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,300
It's cheap as hell.

99
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:32,810
And it costs dollars to get a paid

100
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:34,310
ad lead, but it costs pennies to

101
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:35,099
send emails.

102
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:36,479
Brands pay literally tens of

103
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:38,219
thousands of dollars, hundreds of

104
00:02:38,219 --> 00:02:40,000
thousands, millions of dollars,

105
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,409
depending on the brand every

106
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:42,979
single month to drive traffic to

107
00:02:42,979 --> 00:02:44,349
their website just for these

108
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,800
website viewers to leave.

109
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:47,030
They're spending all this money on

110
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:47,250
ads.

111
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,330
They're spending a shit ton.

112
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:49,979
A brand is doing like $100,000 a

113
00:02:49,979 --> 00:02:50,419
month.

114
00:02:50,419 --> 00:02:51,400
They might be spending like

115
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:52,840
$30,000 a month on ads.

116
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,930
That's a fuck ton.

117
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:56,599
But just for these site viewers to

118
00:02:56,599 --> 00:02:56,960
leave.

119
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:58,409
Because if somebody clicks on an

120
00:02:58,409 --> 00:02:59,870
ad, they go to your website, and

121
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:01,250
then they don't buy, then you're

122
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:01,979
fucked.

123
00:03:01,979 --> 00:03:02,680
You don't have anything.

124
00:03:02,689 --> 00:03:04,330
But what an email allows you to do

125
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:06,060
is capture this expensive paid ad

126
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:06,659
traffic.

127
00:03:06,659 --> 00:03:08,319
Somebody clicks on your ad.

128
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,069
Now, instead of somebody just like

129
00:03:10,139 --> 00:03:11,680
leaving, and it's just like,

130
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,180
adios, we can at least get their

131
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,840
email address by having a really

132
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,830
good pop-up form.

133
00:03:16,909 --> 00:03:18,289
And then we can send them emails

134
00:03:18,289 --> 00:03:19,580
to make that first sale without

135
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:21,210
having to spend more on that paid

136
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:22,469
ad traffic, because email

137
00:03:22,469 --> 00:03:23,919
literally costs pennies.

138
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:25,180
Because there's the rule of seven

139
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:25,949
in marketing.

140
00:03:26,129 --> 00:03:27,159
People need to see your brand

141
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:28,560
seven times before they actually

142
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,750
trust you enough to buy.

143
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:31,340
You could pay a shit ton on ads to

144
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:32,810
get somebody to see you seven

145
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:34,150
times, or what if you have

146
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:35,879
somebody see an ad once, and then

147
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:37,810
they see your email six times, and

148
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:39,030
then they know you enough to

149
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:39,310
trust.

150
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:40,669
And then maybe they buy from an

151
00:03:40,669 --> 00:03:41,860
ad, but the email is what built up

152
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:42,340
the trust.

153
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,009
And as a retention tool, email is

154
00:03:44,009 --> 00:03:44,889
the best method.

155
00:03:44,979 --> 00:03:46,460
Everybody checks their email.

156
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,009
Even just a brand being in the

157
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:49,759
inbox, they're reminded.

158
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:50,780
And if you're in the face of

159
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:52,110
someone three to four times a week

160
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:53,439
on email, specifically in their

161
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:54,800
inbox, which 90% of U.S.

162
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,550
users check regularly, you're just

163
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:57,900
guaranteed to stay top of mind.

164
00:03:57,909 --> 00:03:59,159
And you will not be forgotten.

165
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:00,530
You get sales on autopilot.

166
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:02,090
Cheap traffic, you stay top of

167
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:02,539
mind.

168
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:04,219
And top brands are pulling 40% to

169
00:04:04,219 --> 00:04:05,819
60% of their total revenue from

170
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:06,689
email and SMS.

171
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:08,289
So here are just like a couple

172
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:09,250
quick examples here.

173
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,719
It's like a brand, for example,

174
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:13,080
41% of their 15 million came from

175
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:13,680
email.

176
00:04:13,689 --> 00:04:15,050
And you can see here how much

177
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:16,560
revenue we do every month.

178
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,350
You can see the blue is attributed

179
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:19,399
email revenue.

180
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:20,610
And this is in Klaviyo, the email

181
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:21,870
sending platform that we use.

182
00:04:21,889 --> 00:04:23,529
And so attributed revenue, like

183
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:25,160
for this month, 815K.

184
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,230
This was last month.

185
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:29,300
And unattributed revenue, 1.12.

186
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:31,410
So they did about 2 mil, and 815K

187
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:32,629
of that was from email.

188
00:04:32,709 --> 00:04:33,740
Then here's another example.

189
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:34,649
This was one of my first case

190
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:36,230
studies, where a few months into

191
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:36,629
them,

192
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:38,250
we were doing 47% of their total

193
00:04:38,259 --> 00:04:39,740
revenue coming from the email and

194
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:41,439
SMS, just from the email channel.

195
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:42,180
Just email.

196
00:04:42,209 --> 00:04:42,829
Boom.

197
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:43,439
Right here.

198
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:44,500
So it's possible.

199
00:04:44,509 --> 00:04:45,740
And so obviously if you can

200
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:47,920
generate $326,000 a month for a

201
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,839
brand, they'd be down to pay you

202
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:51,670
$3,000 a month.

203
00:04:51,689 --> 00:04:53,399
And so that's why this model works

204
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:54,100
so well.

205
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:55,959
And so we have an e-commerce email

206
00:04:55,959 --> 00:04:57,259
marketing agency.

207
00:04:57,269 --> 00:04:58,079
That is our model.

208
00:04:58,149 --> 00:04:59,550
We run emails for brands.

209
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:01,209
Because every brand needs email if

210
00:05:01,209 --> 00:05:02,470
they want to be profitable in

211
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:03,560
today's day and age.

212
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:04,990
You could get away with not having

213
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:06,339
email in the past, where ads were

214
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:08,339
a lot cheaper, but today ads are

215
00:05:08,339 --> 00:05:08,959
just so expensive.

216
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:10,399
We need an email to make us to be

217
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:11,629
able to recoup some of that

218
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:12,319
profit.

219
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:14,670
And you can check Mild.com for

220
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:15,660
examples.

221
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:17,379
It's just like a huge platform of

222
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,139
all the emails that a brand may

223
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:19,699
send.

224
00:05:19,709 --> 00:05:20,910
Maybe you've seen like Dr.

225
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:21,420
Squatch.

226
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:23,579
They are a very fast-growing

227
00:05:23,579 --> 00:05:24,019
brand.

228
00:05:24,029 --> 00:05:24,839
You can see these are all the

229
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:25,660
emails that they send.

230
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:27,480
August 24th, 23rd, 22nd, 19th,

231
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,860
14th, 13th, 12th.

232
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:29,980
Like they send a lot of emails.

233
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:30,910
And this is the sort of stuff that

234
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,560
they're sending.

235
00:05:31,569 --> 00:05:33,279
And this is the sort of stuff that

236
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:35,199
we will be making for brands.

237
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:36,579
So you have all these brands.

238
00:05:36,589 --> 00:05:37,639
You can look up any brand you

239
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:37,970
want.

240
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:39,790
Like Patagonia right here.

241
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:40,800
You can look at all of Patagonia's

242
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,660
emails and how often they're

243
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:42,079
sending.

244
00:05:42,089 --> 00:05:43,230
They're sending a daily, pretty

245
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:44,019
much a daily email.

246
00:05:44,029 --> 00:05:45,230
And so you can see everything that

247
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:46,300
they're featuring here.

248
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:47,660
So that can give you a sense of

249
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:48,560
what we're doing.

250
00:05:48,569 --> 00:05:50,139
This is why we run email marketing

251
00:05:50,139 --> 00:05:50,899
for brands.

252
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:51,939
So pricing structure, like

253
00:05:51,949 --> 00:05:53,089
typically what we do is you do

254
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:55,290
$2,000 to $5,000 a month

255
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:55,879
retainers.

256
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:57,290
And typically you're going to be

257
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,930
sending or creating 10 to 20

258
00:05:58,930 --> 00:05:59,899
emails per month.

259
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:01,620
Early on, ideally the more you can

260
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:02,980
do the better because that's how

261
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:03,720
you can leverage yourself

262
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:04,870
against the big agencies or the

263
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:05,980
bigger teams like myself.

264
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,579
I have to set these limits on like

265
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,220
we're going to do 16 emails a

266
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:09,939
month for you

267
00:06:09,949 --> 00:06:10,939
and we can't go over just because

268
00:06:10,939 --> 00:06:11,920
I need to be predictable.

269
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:13,439
But when I was starting, we're

270
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:15,490
doing 30, 40 emails a month if we

271
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:15,939
have to

272
00:06:15,949 --> 00:06:17,079
to keep these clients and have

273
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:18,410
them and just leveraging that.

274
00:06:18,449 --> 00:06:20,160
And as far as team structure, so

275
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:21,810
we have like how a typical email

276
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:23,990
marketing agency will operate

277
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:25,949
is you have an account managers

278
00:06:25,949 --> 00:06:27,279
and strategists.

279
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:28,350
These are the people who are

280
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:29,509
building the calendars, the

281
00:06:29,509 --> 00:06:29,959
strategy,

282
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:31,529
and they're directing the team

283
00:06:31,529 --> 00:06:32,639
behind the scenes.

284
00:06:32,689 --> 00:06:34,069
You have a copywriter, somebody

285
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:35,790
who writes your emails, all the

286
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,920
text on the emails,

287
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:37,959
and then you have the designer

288
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:39,279
who's putting the pretty designs,

289
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:40,180
putting in the brand assets and

290
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:40,879
everything there.

291
00:06:40,889 --> 00:06:42,699
So that's typically what we're

292
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:44,670
looking at right here for how it's

293
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:45,240
used.

294
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:47,040
So that's like a very broad

295
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,050
overview of the email of what an

296
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:50,439
email agency is.

297
00:06:50,449 --> 00:06:51,699
Now email sending platforms.

298
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:52,970
So these are platforms that

299
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:54,439
e-commerce brands have set up that

300
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:55,939
are connected to their store.

301
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:56,949
And on these platforms, you're

302
00:06:56,949 --> 00:06:58,259
able to create sign-up forms, hold

303
00:06:58,259 --> 00:06:58,839
your list,

304
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:00,819
create automations, and send

305
00:07:00,819 --> 00:07:02,240
emails for brands.

306
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:03,959
It'll house everything for you.

307
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:05,110
And so the main platforms are

308
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:06,939
going to be Klaviyo, which is best

309
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:07,660
option,

310
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:09,310
and then OmniSend is coming up

311
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:10,120
right now.

312
00:07:10,449 --> 00:07:11,699
Good option for brands on a

313
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:13,180
budget, but most often you are

314
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:14,540
going to be using Klaviyo.

315
00:07:14,569 --> 00:07:15,980
Again, it's just going to hold.

316
00:07:16,089 --> 00:07:17,470
It's where you can set up pop-up

317
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:19,189
forms, set up automations where,

318
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:19,360
like,

319
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:21,019
if somebody abandons a cart,

320
00:07:21,019 --> 00:07:22,860
Klaviyo will recognize that,

321
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:23,870
and then you can set up an email

322
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:24,899
that'll send to those people who

323
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:25,490
abandon a cart

324
00:07:25,569 --> 00:07:26,769
and then, like, hey, finish your

325
00:07:26,769 --> 00:07:27,860
order, that sort of stuff.

326
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:28,769
And then it allows you to track

327
00:07:28,779 --> 00:07:29,769
how much revenue your emails are

328
00:07:29,769 --> 00:07:30,160
making.

329
00:07:30,829 --> 00:07:31,939
You could send emails from Gmail,

330
00:07:31,939 --> 00:07:33,829
but you're not going to be able to

331
00:07:33,829 --> 00:07:34,720
send to that many people,

332
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:36,720
and you're not going to be able to

333
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,040
track your sales.

334
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:39,019
So that's why we use these

335
00:07:39,019 --> 00:07:39,680
platforms.

336
00:07:39,689 --> 00:07:40,939
And so every brand is going to

337
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,399
have one of these platforms that

338
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:43,040
they use,

339
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:44,899
and Klaviyo is the most used one.

340
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:46,170
So that's the email-sending

341
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:46,879
platforms.

342
00:07:46,889 --> 00:07:48,139
Now the last thing I want to touch

343
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:49,490
on is just the different aspects

344
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:50,449
of email marketing

345
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,569
because there are three different

346
00:07:51,569 --> 00:07:52,529
parts of email marketing.

347
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:53,959
We have your list growth, your

348
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:54,930
pop-up forms.

349
00:07:54,949 --> 00:07:56,160
So pretty self-explanatory,

350
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:56,970
growing your list.

351
00:07:57,129 --> 00:07:58,129
If you want to see a ton of

352
00:07:58,129 --> 00:08:00,019
examples, here's just, like, Alia.

353
00:08:00,029 --> 00:08:01,740
These are, like, the sort of

354
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:03,949
pop-ups that brands can set up.

355
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:05,389
You can do this inside of Klaviyo

356
00:08:05,389 --> 00:08:06,699
or in a platform like Alia where

357
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:07,100
it's, like,

358
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:08,259
hey, here's a discount.

359
00:08:08,269 --> 00:08:09,389
Give us your email, something like

360
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:09,649
that.

361
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:10,980
And you can get fancy by asking a

362
00:08:11,009 --> 00:08:14,389
question and then asking for their

363
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:16,519
email address.

364
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:18,569
But this is what we are doing, and

365
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:20,060
this is super important to nail

366
00:08:20,069 --> 00:08:20,910
your pop-up form

367
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:21,779
because this is how you grow the

368
00:08:21,889 --> 00:08:22,160
list.

369
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:24,189
And then you have your campaigns.

370
00:08:24,329 --> 00:08:25,529
So I like to think of this as

371
00:08:25,529 --> 00:08:26,600
casting a wide net.

372
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:27,860
It's an email blast just sent to

373
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:29,519
people that you have their email.

374
00:08:29,529 --> 00:08:31,560
And so that's what a campaign is.

375
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:33,190
Typically, we're sending two to

376
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,940
four of these campaigns per week.

377
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:36,179
You can see these big brands

378
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:37,750
sending these campaigns, like,

379
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:38,759
almost every day.

380
00:08:38,769 --> 00:08:40,679
But really, until you're doing

381
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:42,490
over a mil a month, until a brand

382
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:43,600
is doing over a mil a month,

383
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:44,419
you really don't need to be

384
00:08:44,539 --> 00:08:45,279
sending every day.

385
00:08:45,289 --> 00:08:46,690
We want to be sending usually,

386
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:48,110
like, three times per week is a

387
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:49,039
good sweet spot.

388
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:51,320
And this is where you're sending

389
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,200
things like back in stock, sale

390
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,259
emails, new product releases.

391
00:08:55,269 --> 00:08:56,179
And then you have, like, the

392
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:57,169
educational emails, which is

393
00:08:57,169 --> 00:08:58,440
mostly what you want to be doing.

394
00:08:58,450 --> 00:08:59,860
Just, like, reminding of your

395
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:01,580
brand and things like that, like

396
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:02,460
this example.

397
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:03,440
What to bring, Camp Kitchen

398
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:03,850
Edition.

399
00:09:03,909 --> 00:09:05,269
We made it easy to get out the

400
00:09:05,269 --> 00:09:07,159
door with our packing checklist.

401
00:09:07,169 --> 00:09:08,549
And so stuff like this, where you

402
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:09,970
don't always need to – you don't

403
00:09:10,029 --> 00:09:11,440
need to be sending only discounts

404
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,019
to make sales.

405
00:09:12,029 --> 00:09:12,980
You can do stuff like this and

406
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:14,039
just remind of your product.

407
00:09:14,049 --> 00:09:15,429
So those are the campaigns.

408
00:09:15,529 --> 00:09:17,240
And then we have our flows, which

409
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,009
are, for me, I think of, like,

410
00:09:19,009 --> 00:09:20,879
campaigns casting a wide net.

411
00:09:20,909 --> 00:09:21,720
And then flows is, like, super

412
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,159
targeted.

413
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:23,470
You're targeting specific people

414
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:24,289
at a certain point in their

415
00:09:24,289 --> 00:09:24,740
journey.

416
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,679
So automated emails will fire when

417
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:28,799
a customer does a specific action.

418
00:09:28,809 --> 00:09:29,860
So we're going to be going over

419
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,029
all these core flows and whatnot

420
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:32,279
and what these core flows are.

421
00:09:32,289 --> 00:09:33,429
But an example is, like, the

422
00:09:33,429 --> 00:09:34,100
welcome flow.

423
00:09:34,129 --> 00:09:35,299
So we're going to send somebody a

424
00:09:35,299 --> 00:09:36,509
sequence of emails when they give

425
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:37,980
us their email address right here.

426
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:38,799
So we're going to send them an

427
00:09:38,889 --> 00:09:39,799
email being, like, hey, here's

428
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:40,490
your discount code.

429
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:42,590
Here's a little bit of information

430
00:09:42,769 --> 00:09:43,779
about our brand.

431
00:09:43,789 --> 00:09:44,529
Here's our best sellers.

432
00:09:44,549 --> 00:09:45,679
So we'll set up a couple emails

433
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:47,129
being, like, hey, your discount's

434
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:48,700
about to expire, things like that.

435
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:49,440
That's a welcome flow.

436
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:50,259
And you have, like, our

437
00:09:50,379 --> 00:09:51,120
abandonment flows.

438
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,049
So there are different abandonment

439
00:09:52,059 --> 00:09:52,320
flows.

440
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:53,960
So if somebody abandons a cart,

441
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,559
they add an item to their cart,

442
00:09:55,559 --> 00:09:56,809
but then they leave.

443
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:58,230
We want a couple of emails in

444
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:00,100
place being, like, hey, get your

445
00:10:00,139 --> 00:10:00,919
cart back.

446
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:02,539
Or overcoming objections, anything

447
00:10:02,539 --> 00:10:02,980
like that.

448
00:10:03,149 --> 00:10:03,860
You've abandoned checkout.

449
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:04,840
Somebody goes a step further, they

450
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,580
go to checkout, and then they

451
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:05,889
leave.

452
00:10:06,009 --> 00:10:07,919
We have browse abandoned.

453
00:10:07,929 --> 00:10:09,289
Somebody views a product.

454
00:10:09,309 --> 00:10:10,279
They don't add it to cart or

455
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:10,730
anything.

456
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:11,759
They just click on the product

457
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:12,799
page, and then they leave.

458
00:10:12,809 --> 00:10:13,899
We have a couple emails in place

459
00:10:13,899 --> 00:10:15,080
being, like, hey, did you like

460
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:15,429
this?

461
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:16,480
What can we do to help?

462
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:17,220
Things like that.

463
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:17,879
Then you have, like,

464
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:18,460
post-purchase.

465
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:19,559
So right after somebody purchases,

466
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:21,070
what emails do we send them?

467
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:22,159
To try to get them to come back.

468
00:10:22,169 --> 00:10:23,240
So those are the different flows,

469
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,419
and that's what we're setting up.

470
00:10:24,429 --> 00:10:25,200
So this is literally all that

471
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,230
we're doing for email marketing.

472
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,480
We're setting up these pop-up

473
00:10:27,539 --> 00:10:28,629
forms, and then ideally

474
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:30,139
optimizing, testing these.

475
00:10:30,149 --> 00:10:31,139
We're sending consistent

476
00:10:31,139 --> 00:10:32,309
campaigns, which when you're

477
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:33,539
working with brands, it's going to

478
00:10:33,539 --> 00:10:33,620
be

479
00:10:33,629 --> 00:10:34,240
the bulk of it.

480
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,639
It's sending these consistent

481
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:37,190
email campaigns over time, like

482
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:38,320
three times per week.

483
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:39,580
And then you're setting up these

484
00:10:39,659 --> 00:10:41,070
automated flows, which you set up

485
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:41,889
once, and then they're

486
00:10:41,909 --> 00:10:42,720
going to continue to fire.

487
00:10:43,289 --> 00:10:44,879
And then obviously, ideally,

488
00:10:44,899 --> 00:10:46,700
you're optimizing these flows over

489
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:47,139
time.

490
00:10:47,149 --> 00:10:48,990
So that is what email marketing

491
00:10:49,009 --> 00:10:50,940
is, and that is kind of just like

492
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,320
a brief overview of what

493
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:53,580
an email marketing agency is, why

494
00:10:53,669 --> 00:10:55,220
you need it, and everything there.

495
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:56,320
So hopefully that was helpful.

496
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:57,710
Let's get into the next video.
