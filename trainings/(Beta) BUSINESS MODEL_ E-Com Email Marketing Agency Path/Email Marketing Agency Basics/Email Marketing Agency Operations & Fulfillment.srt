1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:02,620
What is up, my beautiful email

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:04,599
marketing people?

3
00:00:04,599 --> 00:00:05,740
Today we are going over email

4
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:07,009
marketing agency operations and

5
00:00:07,009 --> 00:00:07,400
fulfillment.

6
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:09,230
So hopefully you have watched my

7
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:12,140
other video or videos, whatever,

8
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:14,179
on what the fuck an e-commerce

9
00:00:14,289 --> 00:00:16,239
email marketing agency is.

10
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:17,359
Now let's go over a little bit

11
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:18,579
more in depth on operations and

12
00:00:18,579 --> 00:00:19,190
fulfillment

13
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:20,500
because, you know, it sounds great

14
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,019
in theory.

15
00:00:21,019 --> 00:00:22,079
Let's send email for brands.

16
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:23,309
It's a little bit more complicated

17
00:00:23,309 --> 00:00:23,780
than that,

18
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:25,530
and so we need to go over that in

19
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:26,449
this video.

20
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:27,530
We're going to go over the

21
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:29,129
different levels of fulfillment,

22
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:30,710
how to do this, what offers you

23
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:32,479
can run, and everything here.

24
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,890
So first let's go over the core

25
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:37,039
offers of what the fuck are you

26
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:38,020
doing for these brands?

27
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:39,320
Like when it's like, okay, I can

28
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,539
do your email marketing.

29
00:00:40,539 --> 00:00:41,729
Okay, well, what exactly are you

30
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:42,140
doing?

31
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:43,700
These are the two offers.

32
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:45,049
These are the core offers that we

33
00:00:45,049 --> 00:00:46,100
run and the core offers that I've

34
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:47,079
always done since I started.

35
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:49,179
So offer number one is you have a

36
00:00:49,179 --> 00:00:51,039
flow rebuild or a flow setup

37
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:51,679
project

38
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:52,740
where we talked about those

39
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:53,579
automated emails.

40
00:00:53,619 --> 00:00:54,969
That's exactly what we're doing.

41
00:00:54,979 --> 00:00:56,729
So we do a one-time setup of all

42
00:00:56,729 --> 00:00:58,140
of a brand's emails because a lot

43
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:58,409
of brands,

44
00:00:58,420 --> 00:00:59,049
when they're started with email

45
00:00:59,049 --> 00:01:00,109
marketing, you need all these

46
00:01:00,109 --> 00:01:00,829
automations.

47
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,439
You need these, you just need all

48
00:01:02,439 --> 00:01:03,640
these automations.

49
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,819
And so this is going to be a

50
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:06,829
one-time setup of 30 to 40 emails

51
00:01:06,829 --> 00:01:07,790
within the flows.

52
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:08,769
Sometimes it can be more.

53
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:09,959
Maybe you can do less.

54
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:11,670
But things like your welcome flow,

55
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:13,150
your abandonment flows, your

56
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:14,109
post-purchase flows,

57
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:15,420
your win-back flows, how do you

58
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:16,609
get somebody who bought six months

59
00:01:16,609 --> 00:01:17,739
ago to come back and buy again,

60
00:01:17,739 --> 00:01:18,879
all that stuff.

61
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:20,230
This is usually lower barrier to

62
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:21,120
entry for brands.

63
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:22,650
They kind of want to start with a

64
00:01:22,659 --> 00:01:24,250
project rather than before working

65
00:01:24,349 --> 00:01:25,719
like long-term with somebody.

66
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:26,599
But it all depends on what a

67
00:01:26,739 --> 00:01:27,609
brand's looking for and what they

68
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:28,060
want.

69
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:30,069
And so these are great for quick

70
00:01:30,069 --> 00:01:31,760
wins and case studies.

71
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,430
So this is a quick little project

72
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:35,620
that you can do, 30 to 60 days,

73
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:37,200
lower barrier to entry to close.

74
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,469
You have to be like, yeah, we're

75
00:01:38,469 --> 00:01:39,519
going to be working ongoing

76
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:40,099
together.

77
00:01:40,219 --> 00:01:41,569
It's like, I'll just do this

78
00:01:41,659 --> 00:01:43,290
one-time project and it'll make

79
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:44,920
you money because you set it up

80
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,560
once for brands

81
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,310
and they can run these flows for

82
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,620
years if they want.

83
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:50,120
And it'll continue to make the

84
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,579
money every single month.

85
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:52,959
And so that's just like the flow

86
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:54,189
rebuild where you just set up

87
00:01:54,189 --> 00:01:55,769
these automations and then you say

88
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:56,239
adios.

89
00:01:56,239 --> 00:01:57,780
And then number two is we have the

90
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,400
full email management where it's

91
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,739
we own your email channel

92
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,769
and we're sending everything for

93
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:02,019
you.

94
00:02:02,019 --> 00:02:03,560
So we're doing this flow rebuild.

95
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,329
We're doing this setup, but we're

96
00:02:05,329 --> 00:02:06,719
also doing campaigns.

97
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,490
And so we're doing the ongoing

98
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:10,409
campaigns, the 3x or so email

99
00:02:10,409 --> 00:02:11,639
campaigns per week,

100
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:13,009
and then the ongoing testing, the

101
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,539
reporting, all that good stuff.

102
00:02:14,539 --> 00:02:15,550
This is going to be a higher

103
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,060
retainer, so a monthly retainer.

104
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:18,219
This is recurring revenue.

105
00:02:18,219 --> 00:02:19,969
So it's $3,000 a month and we're

106
00:02:19,969 --> 00:02:21,169
your email team and this is what

107
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:21,669
we do.

108
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:23,229
Whereas like a flow rebuild, maybe

109
00:02:23,229 --> 00:02:25,009
you charge like $5,000 for this

110
00:02:25,009 --> 00:02:25,830
flow rebuild.

111
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,930
And then this, you get stronger

112
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:28,000
client relationships because

113
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,009
you're working with them over

114
00:02:29,009 --> 00:02:29,289
time.

115
00:02:29,379 --> 00:02:30,879
So these are the two offers.

116
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,460
There's like some smaller offers.

117
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,750
Like you could just do campaigns

118
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:34,870
if a brand's happy with their

119
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:35,360
flows.

120
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,550
You could do that as well.

121
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:38,460
I've never done that personally.

122
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:39,960
I've always been like, hey, we're

123
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,039
your full email team.

124
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:42,360
We don't work with brands where we

125
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,939
can't own the whole email channel.

126
00:02:43,939 --> 00:02:46,349
And that's just what we do.

127
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,460
I know a lot of people who do

128
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,259
campaigns only.

129
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,740
I've just always chosen to do the

130
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,229
full management because I want to

131
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:52,280
be able to be like,

132
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,520
we own this channel, we've set up

133
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,849
everything, and these results are

134
00:02:54,849 --> 00:02:55,520
purely ours.

135
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,539
And so it helps prove that.

136
00:02:57,539 --> 00:02:58,180
And then we have the flow

137
00:02:58,219 --> 00:02:58,639
rebuilds.

138
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:00,979
So for example, context right now,

139
00:03:00,979 --> 00:03:03,030
I very much prefer the full email

140
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:04,689
management because

141
00:03:04,699 --> 00:03:05,509
it's recurring revenue.

142
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,270
And so typically if we sign 10

143
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,069
brands in a month, we'll have like

144
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,620
eight brands on the full email

145
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:11,969
management and then like two on a

146
00:03:11,969 --> 00:03:12,699
flow rebuild.

147
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:14,500
So that's like typically how it

148
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,460
will split up for us.

149
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:16,479
But we have some months where it's

150
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:17,199
like five and five.

151
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:18,340
It just depends on the month.

152
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:20,240
We have some where it's 10 ongoing

153
00:03:20,349 --> 00:03:21,740
and zero flow rebuilds.

154
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,110
But these are like the typical

155
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:24,699
core offers that we want to do.

156
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,759
And so the first thing that I

157
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:28,169
really wanted to hit on, like yes,

158
00:03:28,169 --> 00:03:29,129
we agree on this and we

159
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,919
do this project, we're doing this

160
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,289
fulfillment, but the most

161
00:03:32,289 --> 00:03:33,819
important part of your agency

162
00:03:33,819 --> 00:03:35,370
and your performance as an agency

163
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:36,969
is the client communication is the

164
00:03:36,969 --> 00:03:38,099
most important part of

165
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:38,710
your service delivery.

166
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:40,319
You could have mediocre results.

167
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:41,289
You could be a beginner who

168
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:42,599
doesn't know shit about email.

169
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:43,800
But if you have excellent

170
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,460
communication and you're letting

171
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:46,750
the client know of every little

172
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,150
thing that you're doing, your

173
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:49,750
clients will stay with you because

174
00:03:49,849 --> 00:03:50,719
they just like to be

175
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:50,960
updated.

176
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,509
They like to know that somebody is

177
00:03:52,509 --> 00:03:54,030
proactive in managing the email

178
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,560
account, constantly reviewing

179
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,909
things and they give a shit about

180
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:57,659
the account.

181
00:03:57,659 --> 00:03:58,289
That's all they want.

182
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,620
They just want somebody who gives

183
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:00,669
a shit and is looking at it so

184
00:04:00,669 --> 00:04:01,750
that the client, they don't

185
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,560
need to look at the email.

186
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:04,120
So we use Slack.

187
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,319
I don't recommend any other

188
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:05,960
platform.

189
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,699
Just use Slack.

190
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,039
That's what most businesses

191
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,280
already communicate in.

192
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,900
And so we just use Slack.

193
00:04:10,939 --> 00:04:12,259
We go to their platform and that's

194
00:04:12,259 --> 00:04:13,349
where we communicate.

195
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,110
And if we just simply respond fast

196
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:16,990
and we're proactive with updates,

197
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,399
the client's going to be happy.

198
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,579
That's all that we want.

199
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:21,110
So this is like our communication

200
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:21,680
cadence.

201
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,740
So daily, all client emails and

202
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,550
Slack messages are answered within

203
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,829
one hour during working

204
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:27,139
hours.

205
00:04:27,139 --> 00:04:27,779
We work 9 a.m.

206
00:04:27,779 --> 00:04:28,240
to 5 p.m.

207
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:28,490
Eastern.

208
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,120
But everybody on our team, you're

209
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:31,730
expected to respond ASAP or at the

210
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:32,649
latest within one

211
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,910
hour for anything client has a

212
00:04:33,939 --> 00:04:35,269
question or they share anything

213
00:04:35,269 --> 00:04:36,379
with us, whatever it is.

214
00:04:36,379 --> 00:04:37,639
So daily response times.

215
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:39,310
We just need to be communicating

216
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:40,720
daily on email revisions,

217
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,459
whatever.

218
00:04:41,459 --> 00:04:42,490
We need to be communicating all

219
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:43,259
throughout the day.

220
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:44,699
It's not like, hey, we'll pop in

221
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:46,009
once a month or once a week with

222
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:46,709
an update.

223
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:48,230
No, all throughout the day, we

224
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:49,250
need to be available.

225
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:50,879
And then on a weekly level, we

226
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,670
want to have some structure with

227
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:54,000
our communication and our

228
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:54,560
reporting.

229
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,180
So we always do, for us, we do

230
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:58,009
weekly updates on Mondays.

231
00:04:58,019 --> 00:04:59,519
And so every single account that

232
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,980
we're working with, we are going

233
00:05:01,069 --> 00:05:02,439
to show you some numbers.

234
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:03,629
What did we do last week?

235
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:04,850
How much revenue did we make you

236
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:06,310
to reinforce, like, keep working

237
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:06,899
with us.

238
00:05:06,899 --> 00:05:07,509
We're making you money.

239
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,139
So we're going to break down what,

240
00:05:09,139 --> 00:05:10,720
how much money did we generate?

241
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,800
What did we learn?

242
00:05:12,259 --> 00:05:13,860
Did we, one campaign, absolutely

243
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:14,459
crush it?

244
00:05:14,459 --> 00:05:15,939
Did one, did not, didn't perform

245
00:05:15,939 --> 00:05:17,129
as well as we thought that we

246
00:05:17,129 --> 00:05:18,439
learned something from.

247
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:19,759
So we want to break down the

248
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,550
numbers, give a, give kind of like

249
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,899
a synopsis of the week.

250
00:05:22,899 --> 00:05:23,339
What do we do?

251
00:05:23,339 --> 00:05:24,350
We want to give a status.

252
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,920
What did we complete last week?

253
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,360
Show them that, like, yeah, we've

254
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,589
been fucking doing shit.

255
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,060
Hey, we just finished this draft

256
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,560
for the Browse Abandoned Flow.

257
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,779
Last week, we set live two flows.

258
00:05:33,779 --> 00:05:34,860
And so it just shows to them that

259
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:35,670
we're moving forward.

260
00:05:35,779 --> 00:05:36,889
And then also, like, campaigns,

261
00:05:36,899 --> 00:05:37,910
like, how many campaigns did we

262
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:38,300
send?

263
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,600
And then, super important, since

264
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,839
the Monday, we need to outline the

265
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:41,600
upcoming week.

266
00:05:41,819 --> 00:05:42,810
So now we tell them, this is what

267
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:43,439
we did last week.

268
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,399
This is what happened last week.

269
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:45,519
Now here's what we're doing going

270
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:45,980
forward.

271
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:47,220
Here's what we're doing this week.

272
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:47,870
This is our plan.

273
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,779
This is our action item.

274
00:05:48,819 --> 00:05:50,139
We have these three campaigns that

275
00:05:50,139 --> 00:05:51,310
we're going to be launching for

276
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:51,660
you.

277
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,560
And we're finishing up this

278
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:55,399
post-purchase flow.

279
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:56,329
You can expect that to be

280
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:57,629
delivered to you around middle of

281
00:05:57,629 --> 00:05:58,149
the week.

282
00:05:58,540 --> 00:05:58,819
Boom.

283
00:05:58,839 --> 00:05:59,529
Now they have something to look

284
00:05:59,529 --> 00:05:59,899
forward to.

285
00:05:59,899 --> 00:06:01,069
They know that we're working on

286
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:01,439
shit.

287
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:02,439
And they don't got to worry about,

288
00:06:02,459 --> 00:06:03,810
are these people just taking my

289
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:04,699
money and they're not doing

290
00:06:04,699 --> 00:06:04,889
anything?

291
00:06:04,939 --> 00:06:05,790
No, this is exactly what we're

292
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:06,129
doing.

293
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,620
So that's the weekly updates.

294
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,430
And then, every month as well, we

295
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:11,050
want to do a broader overview of

296
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:11,720
the stats.

297
00:06:11,819 --> 00:06:13,569
Do a performance deep dive of the

298
00:06:13,569 --> 00:06:15,120
revenue attribution, your

299
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,259
deliverability, your list growth,

300
00:06:17,259 --> 00:06:18,670
your A-B tests, everything.

301
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,389
We want to put together a set

302
00:06:20,389 --> 00:06:22,480
little slide deck of just broader

303
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,860
overview numbers.

304
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,379
How is the channel progressing?

305
00:06:25,379 --> 00:06:26,139
What have we learned?

306
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:27,910
Are things trending downwards or

307
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:28,579
upwards?

308
00:06:28,579 --> 00:06:29,839
What suggestions do we have?

309
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:30,470
Anything like that.

310
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:31,949
And also, you want to have at

311
00:06:31,949 --> 00:06:33,459
least monthly check-in meetings.

312
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:34,970
Some people will meet every single

313
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:35,360
week.

314
00:06:35,379 --> 00:06:36,720
Some do bi-weekly.

315
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,279
We've typically found that monthly

316
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:41,459
is kind of a good place to go.

317
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,379
You can do like bi-weekly for the

318
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:45,620
first couple weeks, first couple

319
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,420
months with a client, maybe like

320
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:48,329
the first two months, and then go

321
00:06:48,329 --> 00:06:48,779
to monthly.

322
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:50,860
But I definitely recommend forcing

323
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:52,959
clients to meet with you monthly.

324
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:54,579
There are some clients who won't

325
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:56,279
want to talk to you, but it's good

326
00:06:56,279 --> 00:06:57,699
for relationships to be meeting

327
00:06:58,029 --> 00:06:59,490
with them face-to-face so that

328
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:01,149
you're not just another profile on

329
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:02,079
a screen.

330
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,449
It's like, this is a real person

331
00:07:03,449 --> 00:07:04,699
working on my account, and it

332
00:07:04,699 --> 00:07:06,000
makes it harder for them to want

333
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,720
to drop you.

334
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:07,939
Especially if you have fun with

335
00:07:07,939 --> 00:07:08,910
the client and you have a good

336
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:10,089
relationship, they don't want to

337
00:07:10,089 --> 00:07:11,220
drop people that they're friends

338
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:12,230
with, and so make sure that we

339
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:12,939
have these.

340
00:07:12,939 --> 00:07:14,040
But this is really all you need

341
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:14,839
for communication.

342
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,449
Now, let's actually go into the

343
00:07:16,449 --> 00:07:18,060
fulfillment for these different

344
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:19,470
offers that I showed you, and

345
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:21,069
like, what do the timelines look

346
00:07:21,069 --> 00:07:21,589
like?

347
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:22,800
What do we do?

348
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,470
So this is an example of when we

349
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:26,420
were a little bit smaller, this is

350
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:28,250
like what our fulfillment would

351
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,120
look like.

352
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,560
So again, we have the flows, so we

353
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,920
need to map out the strategy.

354
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,930
We need to write the emails,

355
00:07:32,939 --> 00:07:33,759
design the emails.

356
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:34,779
We need to build the emails in

357
00:07:34,779 --> 00:07:35,860
Klaviyo, test them, get them

358
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:37,399
reviewed by clients, everything.

359
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:38,459
We have the campaigns, we have

360
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:39,600
pop-ups, and then reporting and

361
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,360
communication.

362
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,209
So those are really the only parts

363
00:07:42,209 --> 00:07:43,639
of the email strategy.

364
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:46,110
And so this is like a flow rebuild

365
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:48,379
right here, and then this is what

366
00:07:48,709 --> 00:07:51,050
an ongoing project where we're

367
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:53,620
doing absolutely everything would

368
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:54,689
look like.

369
00:07:54,939 --> 00:07:56,120
And so this is just what we do.

370
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,639
Take it if you want or do

371
00:07:57,639 --> 00:07:59,360
something different.

372
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,600
So this is like where we start

373
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,480
with the client.

374
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:03,959
Really, we're bigger, and so we

375
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:05,579
move a little bit slower because

376
00:08:05,579 --> 00:08:07,339
we have a lot more moving parts.

377
00:08:07,339 --> 00:08:08,529
But if you're a small team, you're

378
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,519
definitely going to want to

379
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:10,240
condense this.

380
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,060
When you're small, you have to

381
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,199
move with speed.

382
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,759
You have to move with speed.

383
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:16,370
That's what you can leverage

384
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:18,209
against the bigger agencies like

385
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:18,910
myself.

386
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,480
So we have a kickoff call, and

387
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,879
then we're going to build out the

388
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:23,180
core segments, so the list,

389
00:08:23,189 --> 00:08:24,339
analyzing the list.

390
00:08:24,339 --> 00:08:25,449
And then on the fourth, we're

391
00:08:25,449 --> 00:08:26,790
going to have a flow map diagram.

392
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,930
So we're going to be mapping every

393
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:28,939
single automated email.

394
00:08:28,939 --> 00:08:30,290
What email, what do we do for

395
00:08:30,379 --> 00:08:32,048
email three on the card abandoned

396
00:08:32,048 --> 00:08:32,538
flow?

397
00:08:32,538 --> 00:08:33,559
Oh, we're doing, we're going to

398
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:34,340
remind you the card.

399
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,509
So we want to map this out and

400
00:08:35,509 --> 00:08:36,710
show them the strategy.

401
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,788
And we like to have a call to go

402
00:08:38,788 --> 00:08:41,220
over to this strategy with brands

403
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:43,048
to get them to see it and let us

404
00:08:43,048 --> 00:08:44,090
know if they want to change

405
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:45,379
anything with the emails and the

406
00:08:45,379 --> 00:08:46,690
strategy that we're doing.

407
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,950
Then we'll send a campaign

408
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:49,549
planning form being like, hey,

409
00:08:49,549 --> 00:08:51,149
we're about to build our campaign

410
00:08:51,149 --> 00:08:51,879
calendar.

411
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,179
Do you have any events?

412
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,240
Do you have any sales coming up?

413
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:55,899
Do you have any new product

414
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:56,399
release?

415
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:57,700
And so we'll send like a form

416
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,159
being like, hey, what are the

417
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:00,549
dates that we need to know?

418
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,129
And then right here, the 10th, we

419
00:09:02,129 --> 00:09:03,580
have pop-up forms ready to launch.

420
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:04,929
And then we have an unsubscribe

421
00:09:04,929 --> 00:09:06,210
preferences page, which is a

422
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:07,340
little bit advanced.

423
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:08,059
You probably don't need to do

424
00:09:08,059 --> 00:09:08,759
this, but it's just like if

425
00:09:08,769 --> 00:09:09,600
somebody clicks to unsubscribe

426
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,710
from an email, we have a page

427
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:12,080
where it's like, hey, would you

428
00:09:12,409 --> 00:09:14,120
like to stay subscribed and get,

429
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,000
but only receive emails like once

430
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,899
a month, something like that.

431
00:09:17,899 --> 00:09:19,090
And then on this date, we'll do

432
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,250
the campaign calendar.

433
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:21,610
But all throughout this, we are

434
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:22,909
doing the copy and the design on

435
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:23,710
all the flows.

436
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,909
And then on the 13th, we'll

437
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,299
deliver the campaign calendar.

438
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:27,620
This is every single email that we

439
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:28,200
want to send.

440
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:29,629
This is the topic of this email

441
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:31,230
and this email and this campaign.

442
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,370
We send the topics and our

443
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:33,720
strategy of what we want to do for

444
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,080
review and then see if the client

445
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,710
has anything they want to change.

446
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,590
And then by day 15, the 15th here

447
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:40,009
is when we have the welcome flow

448
00:09:40,009 --> 00:09:41,210
and we send that over to the

449
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:42,220
client to review.

450
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,429
And then card abandon, checkout

451
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,620
abandon, kind of just like two to

452
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:45,840
three email flows per week.

453
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,210
And then all the flows are kind of

454
00:09:47,269 --> 00:09:48,649
built out by the middle of month

455
00:09:48,649 --> 00:09:49,059
two.

456
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,720
We're just working on making sure

457
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,009
they're all approved and whatnot

458
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:53,299
and getting them uploaded inside

459
00:09:53,299 --> 00:09:54,460
of Klaviyo and turned on.

460
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,769
And then we can just focus on

461
00:09:55,769 --> 00:09:56,500
campaigns.

462
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,690
So that's like what a kickoff

463
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,279
schedule would look like there.

464
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:00,860
And for flow rebuild, this is what

465
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:02,419
it would look like with just doing

466
00:10:02,419 --> 00:10:03,100
the flows.

467
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,419
Same sort of thing, but no

468
00:10:04,419 --> 00:10:05,179
campaigns.

469
00:10:05,179 --> 00:10:06,779
And so this is like what a

470
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:08,759
calendar would look like.

471
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,879
So that is how that timeline would

472
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:12,440
look.

473
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:13,840
Let me take a drink of my water.

474
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:15,950
Now we need to build our

475
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:18,340
fulfillment machine.

476
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:19,889
And I'm going to go over, I'm

477
00:10:19,889 --> 00:10:21,440
actually going to skip to the

478
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,080
scaling fulfillment and how to

479
00:10:23,409 --> 00:10:24,899
handle more clients just to show

480
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:26,529
you like the different phases of

481
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:28,440
growing your company to be able to

482
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:30,240
then operate without you.

483
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:32,440
So stage one is the solo operator.

484
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,600
This is going to be you from kind

485
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,940
of like one to four-ish clients.

486
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:35,649
For some people, it might be

487
00:10:35,649 --> 00:10:35,940
higher.

488
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:36,629
For some people, it might be

489
00:10:36,629 --> 00:10:36,899
lower.

490
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:37,980
It just depends on the brands

491
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:38,960
you're working on and your

492
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,139
fulfillment, whatever.

493
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,320
Typically one to four-ish clients,

494
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,590
and this is what I was doing,

495
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:45,039
where it was kind of like at four

496
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:46,500
clients, I was kind of maxed out

497
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,100
on time, four to five clients, and

498
00:10:48,129 --> 00:10:49,450
I needed to start hiring some

499
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:50,419
people to help.

500
00:10:50,419 --> 00:10:51,610
So this is where you're wearing

501
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:52,440
every single hat.

502
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,250
You're doing all the strategy.

503
00:10:53,259 --> 00:10:54,110
You're doing all the copy.

504
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,240
You're doing the design.

505
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,929
You're doing the Klaviyo uploading

506
00:10:56,929 --> 00:10:58,200
and building the emails and

507
00:10:58,289 --> 00:10:59,840
sending them live and scheduling

508
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,299
them, and you're doing all the

509
00:11:01,309 --> 00:11:03,179
client communication yourself.

510
00:11:03,179 --> 00:11:04,330
This is great for learning the

511
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,549
entire process end-to-end.

512
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:06,570
You need to have this phase to

513
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:07,710
where you learn it because as the

514
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:08,799
owner of a company, you need to

515
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:10,019
know how everything works.

516
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:11,070
But there is a limit.

517
00:11:11,139 --> 00:11:12,750
You'll cap out around maybe three

518
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,370
to five clients before quality,

519
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:15,870
your response times, and your

520
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:17,570
sanity will start to suffer.

521
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:19,639
And so there's that, where you're

522
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:21,009
doing everything.

523
00:11:21,019 --> 00:11:22,120
And so this is just what you want

524
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:22,700
to focus on.

525
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,049
Don't fucking worry about your

526
00:11:24,139 --> 00:11:25,610
team until you've maxed out your

527
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:26,250
own time.

528
00:11:26,259 --> 00:11:27,879
A lot of people just think way too

529
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:29,039
far ahead before.

530
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:30,389
It's like, brother, get your own

531
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:31,710
clients until you're maxed out on

532
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,149
time.

533
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:33,049
Then you can figure out how to

534
00:11:33,179 --> 00:11:34,059
hire and everything there.

535
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,340
So that's where we go to the stage

536
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:36,620
two, where you're working with

537
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:38,149
freelancers and contractors, where

538
00:11:38,149 --> 00:11:38,820
you're at five.

539
00:11:39,139 --> 00:11:40,509
This will take you from five to

540
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:42,440
10-ish, 15-ish clients.

541
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,120
And this is where you get some

542
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,279
help from some part-time people.

543
00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:48,289
You don't quite have enough cash

544
00:11:48,289 --> 00:11:50,429
flow to hire full-time people, but

545
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:52,340
you can hire part-time and sort of

546
00:11:52,389 --> 00:11:53,129
like contractors.

547
00:11:53,139 --> 00:11:54,740
And so first hires are typically

548
00:11:54,809 --> 00:11:56,340
designers to design emails,

549
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,269
copywriters to write emails, and

550
00:11:58,269 --> 00:11:59,200
Klaviyo VAs.

551
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,570
So people who will actually build

552
00:12:00,659 --> 00:12:02,039
the emails inside of Klaviyo and

553
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:03,269
schedule the emails for you a

554
00:12:03,269 --> 00:12:04,889
little bit more of the busy work.

555
00:12:04,899 --> 00:12:06,450
These are typically the easiest

556
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:08,100
work to – this is the easiest work

557
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,570
to offload, and it's just like

558
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:10,820
whatever you prefer.

559
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,320
Whatever takes you the most time,

560
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,620
I'd recommend doing that.

561
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,649
You should still hold control of

562
00:12:15,649 --> 00:12:17,639
most of the strategy communication

563
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:19,779
in the execution, the management,

564
00:12:19,779 --> 00:12:21,940
and the strategy, building out the

565
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,169
calendars and building out the

566
00:12:23,169 --> 00:12:24,450
flow maps and the strategies and

567
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:25,779
then client communication.

568
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,960
But whatever's taking up the most

569
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,120
time for you or you just don't

570
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,500
like, do that.

571
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,559
And so the first thing that I

572
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:34,559
hired was a designer.

573
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:35,559
Fucking hate design.

574
00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:36,639
Suck at design.

575
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:37,950
I hired a part-time designer to

576
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:39,169
design the emails, and I was

577
00:12:39,169 --> 00:12:40,490
writing the emails, and then I

578
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:42,200
would upload into Klaviyo as well.

579
00:12:42,919 --> 00:12:44,789
And then we got more clients, and

580
00:12:44,789 --> 00:12:46,899
then I, again, got way too busy.

581
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:48,450
So then I hired a Klaviyo VA,

582
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:50,299
somebody who would actually take

583
00:12:50,299 --> 00:12:51,649
those designs and build them

584
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:53,860
inside of Klaviyo, add the links,

585
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,590
quality check the emails, and

586
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:57,429
schedule them to be sent inside of

587
00:12:57,429 --> 00:12:58,360
Klaviyo.

588
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,730
And then once I maxed out on that,

589
00:12:59,789 --> 00:13:01,129
then I brought in a copywriter,

590
00:13:01,129 --> 00:13:02,450
and then I had somebody writing

591
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:03,100
the copy.

592
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,309
This gives you breathing room

593
00:13:04,309 --> 00:13:05,429
unless you take on five to ten

594
00:13:05,429 --> 00:13:06,000
clients.

595
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,960
You can scale this even.

596
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,860
I see people who scale this to 20,

597
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:10,899
30 clients just doing this sort of

598
00:13:10,899 --> 00:13:11,460
thing.

599
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,929
But that's typically what I would

600
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:15,570
recommend before you really want

601
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:17,059
to start bringing some people as

602
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,750
full-time employees because the

603
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,250
challenge is freelancers aren't

604
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:21,629
always reliable.

605
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:22,889
They're not as bought in to you

606
00:13:22,889 --> 00:13:24,240
because they're doing their own

607
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:24,590
thing.

608
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:25,539
They have their own clients.

609
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:27,039
They're not as bought in.

610
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:28,850
It's just a different frame when

611
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:30,720
it's like, hey, they have other

612
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,269
shit, and they are usually

613
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:33,889
entrepreneurial, and it's

614
00:13:33,889 --> 00:13:35,789
different when you hire somebody

615
00:13:35,789 --> 00:13:37,330
off of a job platform versus

616
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:38,950
somebody that you got off of a

617
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:40,460
LinkedIn job post.

618
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:41,419
It's just a different vibe.

619
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,519
So they're not always reliable, so

620
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:45,169
what you'll need is clear briefs,

621
00:13:45,259 --> 00:13:46,840
QC, and training systems.

622
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,460
And so that's that stage two.

623
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,009
And then once you have enough cash

624
00:13:50,009 --> 00:13:51,440
flow, then you can start really

625
00:13:51,529 --> 00:13:53,059
building out pods and teams within

626
00:13:53,059 --> 00:13:53,940
your company.

627
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,149
So then we can build structured

628
00:13:57,159 --> 00:13:58,860
pods of each pod.

629
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:00,210
It's just a clump of people that

630
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:01,509
can manage, like, six to ten

631
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:02,659
clients in each pod.

632
00:14:02,659 --> 00:14:03,889
So there's going to be an account

633
00:14:03,889 --> 00:14:04,399
manager.

634
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:05,879
So this is somebody who does the

635
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:06,960
strategy in the client

636
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,720
communication, and they manage the

637
00:14:08,769 --> 00:14:09,139
team.

638
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,690
And then you'll have a designer, a

639
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:11,850
copywriter, and a Klaviyo

640
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,350
technician to upload into Klaviyo

641
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:13,940
and all that.

642
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,309
And that's going to be one pod,

643
00:14:15,309 --> 00:14:16,379
and these can manage six to ten

644
00:14:16,379 --> 00:14:16,889
clients.

645
00:14:16,899 --> 00:14:18,799
And so that's what we will build

646
00:14:18,909 --> 00:14:19,379
out.

647
00:14:19,379 --> 00:14:20,500
And then you can build out

648
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,029
multiple, multiple pods, and so

649
00:14:22,029 --> 00:14:23,389
then with each one having six to

650
00:14:23,389 --> 00:14:24,120
ten clients.

651
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:25,600
Account manager is kind of like

652
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,879
the new position where this is

653
00:14:26,889 --> 00:14:28,190
what I would recommend as your

654
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:29,730
first full-time hire is get an

655
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:30,940
account manager,

656
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:32,419
and then they'll manage, like, the

657
00:14:32,419 --> 00:14:33,929
other freelancers, the designers,

658
00:14:34,029 --> 00:14:35,419
copywriters, and Klaviyo VAs.

659
00:14:35,419 --> 00:14:37,590
And they are dealing with the

660
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:38,559
clients.

661
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:40,100
And so this allows you to scale to

662
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:43,120
20 to 30, 40, 50 clients, and your

663
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,730
role kind of shifts to training,

664
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:47,490
hiring, and overseeing the pod

665
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:48,820
performance at this level.

666
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,370
So I ran this all the way to

667
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:52,539
around 30-ish clients until I

668
00:14:52,539 --> 00:14:54,179
needed to get a director of

669
00:14:54,179 --> 00:14:55,289
operations.

670
00:14:56,059 --> 00:14:57,230
Because then my whole day was

671
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,379
just, like, reviewing everybody's

672
00:14:59,379 --> 00:15:00,990
work and being like, is shit

673
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:02,389
getting done, checking in on the

674
00:15:02,389 --> 00:15:03,809
client channels, making sure

675
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:05,980
people are actually active.

676
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,460
And that's when I was just maxed

677
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:08,840
out on time because I was also

678
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,639
doing sales and marketing, getting

679
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:11,519
us clients.

680
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:12,720
So that's when you need to bring

681
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,100
in the management layer, which is

682
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,610
when we're above 30 clients where

683
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:16,830
you can potentially add senior

684
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:17,960
account managers to oversee

685
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,669
account managers or directors to

686
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:21,120
oversee multiple pods.

687
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,779
So, like, a director of operations

688
00:15:22,779 --> 00:15:24,139
to make sure that shit is running

689
00:15:24,139 --> 00:15:25,629
smoothly, to ensure consistency

690
00:15:25,629 --> 00:15:26,909
across the accounts, handle

691
00:15:26,909 --> 00:15:28,450
escalations, and maintain client

692
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:29,950
relationships so that you can

693
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:31,620
focus on whatever you're good at,

694
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:32,960
which, for me, was marketing and

695
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:33,360
sales.

696
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,960
And then you're just stepped into

697
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,710
the CEO role.

698
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,909
You're focused on growth, sales,

699
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:37,809
and vision instead of the

700
00:15:37,809 --> 00:15:38,879
day-to-day client work.

701
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:39,889
This is where you get out of the

702
00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:41,169
day-to-day operations, and you can

703
00:15:41,169 --> 00:15:42,500
focus on growing the business.

704
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,190
This will get you to 50-plus

705
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:45,879
clients in stable systems, and

706
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:47,610
this is still what we operate at,

707
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:49,840
around, like, 100 clients.

708
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,629
So this is, like, for example,

709
00:15:51,629 --> 00:15:52,870
what our team structure kind of

710
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:53,580
looks like.

711
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:54,700
It's a little bit different than

712
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:55,779
this, and we have a couple more

713
00:15:55,779 --> 00:15:56,860
divisions, but this is what it

714
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:57,480
looks like.

715
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,149
Like, for me, I'm the CEO, and

716
00:15:59,149 --> 00:16:00,639
then sales closer, so I have

717
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,220
somebody now who takes my sales

718
00:16:02,549 --> 00:16:02,870
calls.

719
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:04,379
And then we have a director of

720
00:16:04,379 --> 00:16:06,070
operations, and so he's the one

721
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:07,620
who is kind of managing everything

722
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:09,539
on the internal, training

723
00:16:09,539 --> 00:16:11,330
everybody, and double-checking

724
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:12,860
that shit is getting done, and

725
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:14,330
just being the support for

726
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:15,159
everybody.

727
00:16:15,159 --> 00:16:16,509
And so you can see here we have

728
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:18,110
this division, so where we have a

729
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:19,889
senior account manager, and then

730
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:21,379
we have four different pods.

731
00:16:21,379 --> 00:16:22,399
And so you can see one pod,

732
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:23,649
account manager, designer,

733
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,110
copywriter, Klaviyo technician,

734
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:26,279
and then each pod will handle six

735
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:27,440
to eight clients.

736
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:28,620
So we have that pod, we have this

737
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:29,799
pod, we have this pod, then this

738
00:16:29,799 --> 00:16:31,059
pod, then we have a senior account

739
00:16:31,059 --> 00:16:32,409
manager to kind of, like, oversee,

740
00:16:32,529 --> 00:16:33,679
help with the strategy, help deal

741
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:35,409
with clients and everything there.

742
00:16:35,419 --> 00:16:36,470
And then we have that division

743
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:37,179
multiple times.

744
00:16:37,179 --> 00:16:38,529
So, like, at its full scale, this

745
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:39,620
is what it looks like.

746
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,129
At first, maybe it's literally

747
00:16:41,129 --> 00:16:42,539
just you managing everything right

748
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:43,789
here for clients, and then you

749
00:16:43,789 --> 00:16:45,220
turn into the account manager, and

750
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:46,299
you have a hired designer,

751
00:16:46,299 --> 00:16:47,860
copywriter, Klaviyo technician,

752
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,509
and you're doing that for, like,

753
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:49,889
two pods.

754
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,080
But then eventually you have to

755
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,169
hire an account manager, and then

756
00:16:52,169 --> 00:16:53,519
they help, and yada, yada, yada.

757
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:54,710
And that's typically how it all

758
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:55,120
goes.

759
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,950
It never happens that smooth or

760
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:57,700
cleanly.

761
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,210
You kind of just got to, like, go

762
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:01,580
over time and adapt, and you're

763
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:02,990
going to have some weird setups.

764
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:03,860
That's okay.

765
00:17:04,039 --> 00:17:05,730
And ours is definitely not as

766
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:06,740
clean as this.

767
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:08,200
We have some shits that's, like,

768
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:08,799
over here.

769
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:09,828
We have some Klaviyo technicians

770
00:17:09,828 --> 00:17:10,818
working in multiple pods.

771
00:17:10,818 --> 00:17:11,799
We have an account manager over

772
00:17:11,838 --> 00:17:12,720
here who also manages a client

773
00:17:12,818 --> 00:17:13,220
over here.

774
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,180
It's never this perfect, but,

775
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,200
like, in general, this is what it

776
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:15,740
looks like.

777
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:17,640
So common pitfalls that beginners

778
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,630
make when they're building their

779
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:21,700
operations and planning things and

780
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:22,519
growing.

781
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:23,480
First thing is going to be

782
00:17:23,539 --> 00:17:24,789
overpromising deliverables and

783
00:17:24,789 --> 00:17:26,140
then can't fulfill, saying yes to

784
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:27,259
absolutely everything.

785
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,240
Daily campaigns, dozens of flows,

786
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,190
24-7 communication just to close a

787
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:31,650
client.

788
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:33,349
But then you can't actually do

789
00:17:33,349 --> 00:17:33,839
that.

790
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:35,380
That's not going to be good

791
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:37,200
because then the client's just

792
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,759
going to leave, and it's going to

793
00:17:38,759 --> 00:17:39,890
be super stressful for you and the

794
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:40,240
team.

795
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,049
It's going to lead to missed

796
00:17:41,259 --> 00:17:42,140
deadlines, rush to working on

797
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:42,799
happy clients.

798
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:44,130
The solution, just make sure you

799
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:45,390
set realistic expectations up

800
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:46,690
front and surprise your clients

801
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:47,539
with overdelivery.

802
00:17:47,779 --> 00:17:49,289
It's okay to push back a little

803
00:17:49,289 --> 00:17:51,079
bit on some clients as you grow.

804
00:17:51,079 --> 00:17:53,109
At the beginning, fucking take

805
00:17:53,109 --> 00:17:54,339
what you can get.

806
00:17:54,339 --> 00:17:55,490
Do what you've got to do to close

807
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:56,220
these clients.

808
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:57,480
Get a case study out of them.

809
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,079
Get a positive testimonial.

810
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:00,640
And then figure it out later.

811
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,799
But really, we need to be sure

812
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:03,099
that as we're growing, we need to

813
00:18:03,099 --> 00:18:04,400
make sure we're super clear and we

814
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,380
have these boundaries.

815
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:07,720
Underestimating setup time.

816
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,980
So beginners think a full flow

817
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:10,420
rebuild can take just, like, one

818
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:12,170
week to create, like, 30, 40

819
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:12,740
emails.

820
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,480
But we have copy design.

821
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,670
We have client revisions that

822
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:16,960
they're going to leave comments

823
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,490
like, hey, change this, change

824
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:18,640
this.

825
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:19,259
You've got to make those

826
00:18:19,259 --> 00:18:19,660
revisions.

827
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:20,990
And then uploading it and testing

828
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:22,119
it can take a minimum three to

829
00:18:22,119 --> 00:18:22,769
four weeks.

830
00:18:22,779 --> 00:18:24,819
And so try not to rush too much.

831
00:18:24,819 --> 00:18:25,940
It'll lead to sloppy execution,

832
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:26,829
broken automations, and

833
00:18:26,829 --> 00:18:27,440
everything.

834
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,940
So build in buffer time and use

835
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:30,390
SOPs to keep your projects on

836
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:30,890
track.

837
00:18:31,019 --> 00:18:32,339
So just make sure you're tracking

838
00:18:32,339 --> 00:18:33,609
everything and make sure you're

839
00:18:33,609 --> 00:18:34,680
not trying to do way too much

840
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,579
right off the bat.

841
00:18:35,579 --> 00:18:37,069
And use that kind of, like,

842
00:18:37,069 --> 00:18:38,450
calendar that I gave you as

843
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,730
something to go off.

844
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:41,420
Poor client communication is the

845
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,700
most important thing.

846
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,049
You can't go quiet while working

847
00:18:44,059 --> 00:18:45,240
hard behind the scenes.

848
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,430
It just makes them feel ignored.

849
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:48,029
And the client literally only sees

850
00:18:48,029 --> 00:18:48,400
Slack.

851
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,269
You could be fucking working 24

852
00:18:51,269 --> 00:18:53,920
hours a day in a fucking sweatshop

853
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,400
and bending over backwards,

854
00:18:56,539 --> 00:18:58,380
calling Klaviyo, and doing all

855
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:01,279
this, like, crazy shit for them.

856
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:02,210
But if you don't tell them that,

857
00:19:02,299 --> 00:19:03,160
they just see an empty Slack.

858
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,779
They just see an empty Slack chat.

859
00:19:04,819 --> 00:19:05,680
So you need to be telling them

860
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:06,650
about this stuff that, like,

861
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:07,720
you're working on your stuff.

862
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,339
So that'll often lead to churn as

863
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:11,069
if you're not giving these clients

864
00:19:11,069 --> 00:19:11,700
updates.

865
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:12,809
Because the clients assume nothing

866
00:19:12,809 --> 00:19:13,849
is happening, and they'll start

867
00:19:13,849 --> 00:19:14,900
looking for other agencies.

868
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,319
Make sure you do daily response

869
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:17,380
times under one hour, weekly

870
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:18,539
communication, and proactive

871
00:19:18,539 --> 00:19:19,559
communication, even if the

872
00:19:19,589 --> 00:19:20,420
progress is slow.

873
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:21,109
Make sure you're doing this.

874
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:22,180
No clear scope.

875
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:23,990
So lead to scope creep kind of

876
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:25,730
ties into the first one.

877
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:27,289
But without a defined scope of,

878
00:19:27,289 --> 00:19:28,660
hey, we're just doing email

879
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:29,460
marketing.

880
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,809
We're just going to do your email

881
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:32,420
campaigns and your email flows.

882
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,769
This is how many we're going to be

883
00:19:33,769 --> 00:19:35,039
doing roughly every month.

884
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,160
Then they're going to start asking

885
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,210
you for other stuff, and you end

886
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:38,190
up working double for the same

887
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:38,490
pay.

888
00:19:38,519 --> 00:19:39,789
So make sure that your contracts

889
00:19:39,789 --> 00:19:41,009
and your deliverables outline

890
00:19:41,009 --> 00:19:42,670
clearly, like, hey, this goes up

891
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:44,980
to 12 email campaigns a month.

892
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:46,220
They're up to four flows a month.

893
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:48,150
And then enforce them politely but

894
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:48,799
firmly.

895
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:50,259
Often what I'll do is if a client

896
00:19:50,259 --> 00:19:52,049
requests something, I'll be like,

897
00:19:52,049 --> 00:19:53,509
yes, for sure, we can get this

898
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:55,000
taken care of this time.

899
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,900
But please note that, again, we

900
00:19:57,009 --> 00:19:58,849
just do this service, or this is

901
00:19:58,849 --> 00:19:59,740
just what we do.

902
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,180
And so that's something to do.

903
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,240
Then neglecting reporting and

904
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:02,700
results.

905
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,160
Some beginners just think that,

906
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,809
hey, we're sending these emails.

907
00:20:05,819 --> 00:20:07,079
We're all good, without showing

908
00:20:07,079 --> 00:20:08,250
the value in how much money that

909
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,440
you're making the client.

910
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:10,549
If they don't see the ROI, they

911
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,359
don't know how much money that

912
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,390
you're making them, they're going

913
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:12,880
to leave.

914
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,400
So provide clear monthly reports

915
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,759
and your weekly reports to tie

916
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:17,230
your actual work into revenue so

917
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,880
that they can justify the price.

918
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,710
And I want to end this by saying

919
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:22,480
just do not overthink it.

920
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,829
Most beginners stress about

921
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,680
systems, processes, and problems

922
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,980
that don't even exist.

923
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,519
They don't even exist for you yet.

924
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:30,279
They will, but don't worry about

925
00:20:30,279 --> 00:20:30,970
them now.

926
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,150
Your number one priority is to

927
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:32,839
sign clients.

928
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:34,099
Nothing matters until revenue is

929
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:34,559
coming in.

930
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,099
Worry about the operation second.

931
00:20:36,099 --> 00:20:37,289
You will naturally figure out

932
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:38,400
operations over time.

933
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,589
Sales is one thing that you don't

934
00:20:39,619 --> 00:20:40,839
naturally figure out over time

935
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:42,549
because you have to put in so much

936
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,369
work to get these clients in the

937
00:20:44,369 --> 00:20:44,890
door.

938
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,019
I started with absolutely no

939
00:20:46,019 --> 00:20:47,410
knowledge on email marketing, and

940
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:48,839
I was advertising to everybody.

941
00:20:48,839 --> 00:20:50,440
I'm an email marketing expert.

942
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,170
Come work with me.

943
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:52,539
I generate amazing results.

944
00:20:52,539 --> 00:20:54,140
I'm an email marketing expert.

945
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:55,130
And then I just figure it the fuck

946
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:55,509
out later.

947
00:20:55,579 --> 00:20:56,950
I sign, like, five clients.

948
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,299
Then it's like, fuck, what do I do

949
00:20:58,299 --> 00:20:58,579
now?

950
00:20:58,579 --> 00:20:59,930
It's so over.

951
00:21:00,019 --> 00:21:01,019
How am I doing this?

952
00:21:01,019 --> 00:21:02,200
And then you always figure it out.

953
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:03,690
And the operations just naturally,

954
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:04,809
you're forced to figure it the

955
00:21:04,809 --> 00:21:05,279
fuck out.

956
00:21:05,319 --> 00:21:06,660
And that's how everything that

957
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:07,940
I've shared with you just come

958
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:09,470
from me figuring it the fuck out.

959
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:10,640
Just focus on sales, and then

960
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:11,829
you'll figure it out later.

961
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:12,900
A simple-based system is good

962
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,150
enough to get started, and your

963
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:15,519
growth will just naturally expose

964
00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:17,039
the weaknesses in your operations,

965
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:17,960
and then you can just pivot and

966
00:21:18,059 --> 00:21:18,319
adjust.

967
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:19,920
When something breaks, just fix

968
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,500
it, update the system, and then

969
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,319
keep moving.

970
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:23,690
It's going to be a system of you

971
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,660
grow, grow, grow, grow, grow, and

972
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:26,809
then your operations kind of break

973
00:21:26,849 --> 00:21:27,440
a little bit.

974
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,630
And then you kind of go down, and

975
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:29,890
then you kind of figure it out,

976
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:31,589
and then you grow, grow, grow,

977
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:31,660
grow, grow,

978
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:33,420
and then you meet another point

979
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:35,339
where you go down a little bit.

980
00:21:35,339 --> 00:21:36,500
And you've got to figure it out

981
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,650
because some stuff breaks and

982
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:38,599
yada, yada, yada.

983
00:21:38,599 --> 00:21:39,670
You need to make a new hire,

984
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:40,700
everything like that.

985
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:41,660
That's typically how it goes.

986
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:42,779
So just repeat this cycle.

987
00:21:42,779 --> 00:21:44,380
It's an ongoing cycle.

988
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:45,730
I'm still going through this.

989
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:46,549
It's an ongoing cycle all

990
00:21:46,759 --> 00:21:47,420
throughout business.

991
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:48,769
Find your system that works.

992
00:21:48,829 --> 00:21:50,380
Scale it until it breaks.

993
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:51,500
Figure something new out.

994
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,480
Scale it until it breaks.

995
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,130
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom,

996
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:53,329
boom.

997
00:21:53,539 --> 00:21:54,789
And then your operations will

998
00:21:54,789 --> 00:21:56,440
evolve alongside your client base.

999
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,740
So that's it for the operations

1000
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:58,940
and everything, mindset,

1001
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:00,559
everything, some base knowledge.

1002
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:01,380
Let me know if you have any

1003
00:22:01,579 --> 00:22:01,910
questions.

1004
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,079
And, yeah, let's get to the next

1005
00:22:03,079 --> 00:22:03,329
one.
