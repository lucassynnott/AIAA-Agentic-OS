1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,310
Okay, okay, that all makes sense

2
00:00:01,310 --> 00:00:01,840
in theory.

3
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:02,919
Yes, we want a high-converting

4
00:00:03,029 --> 00:00:03,339
pop-up,

5
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:04,919
but how exactly do you make an

6
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:05,900
effective pop-up form?

7
00:00:05,929 --> 00:00:07,240
That is what we are going to be

8
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:07,849
going over

9
00:00:07,889 --> 00:00:09,179
in this very, very, very, very,

10
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:10,679
very important doc here.

11
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:12,080
Lots of jam-packed information

12
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:12,480
here.

13
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:14,830
So these are the steps you want to

14
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:15,039
do

15
00:00:15,109 --> 00:00:16,539
when creating a pop-up form.

16
00:00:16,649 --> 00:00:17,890
First, we want to establish the

17
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:18,320
offer.

18
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:19,679
Choose what incentive you're going

19
00:00:19,699 --> 00:00:20,420
to be giving the recipients.

20
00:00:20,449 --> 00:00:22,199
The stronger your incentive, the

21
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:23,399
higher your opt-ins,

22
00:00:23,449 --> 00:00:24,899
but again, you want to be able to

23
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:25,460
balance it

24
00:00:25,489 --> 00:00:26,940
so that you're not giving like 90%

25
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:27,719
off your products

26
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:29,019
because obviously that's a bad

27
00:00:29,019 --> 00:00:29,839
look for your brand

28
00:00:29,859 --> 00:00:30,600
or you're giving somebody,

29
00:00:30,629 --> 00:00:32,070
everybody who signs up gets a free

30
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,060
Tesla Cybertruck.

31
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:33,320
No.

32
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:34,679
So first, we want to establish our

33
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:35,159
offer.

34
00:00:35,189 --> 00:00:35,950
What do we want to do?

35
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:37,039
And then we want to choose what

36
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:38,060
form type you want.

37
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:39,799
So I'm giving you five different

38
00:00:39,799 --> 00:00:40,420
form types

39
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:41,640
and then pick a starting point.

40
00:00:41,659 --> 00:00:42,640
I'll give you recommendations.

41
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:44,920
Three, we want to create our form

42
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,250
in Klaviyo or Amped.

43
00:00:46,549 --> 00:00:47,740
Use my tutorial guides,

44
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:48,759
which I'm going to show you for

45
00:00:48,759 --> 00:00:49,140
your form

46
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:50,179
and your desired platform.

47
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:51,789
Then four, run your form through

48
00:00:51,789 --> 00:00:52,619
my checklist,

49
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:53,700
which I will show you,

50
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:54,689
the high-converting form

51
00:00:54,689 --> 00:00:55,119
checklist,

52
00:00:55,149 --> 00:00:56,469
and then set up your A-B test and

53
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,420
test from there.

54
00:00:57,450 --> 00:00:59,049
So number one, establish your

55
00:00:59,049 --> 00:00:59,549
offer.

56
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:00,939
Your offer is the most important

57
00:01:00,939 --> 00:01:01,149
part

58
00:01:01,189 --> 00:01:02,960
in terms of getting conversions.

59
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:05,079
So we want to really try off,

60
00:01:05,109 --> 00:01:06,510
try different offers based on our

61
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:06,900
margins

62
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:07,980
and then what opt-in rates we're

63
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:08,540
getting.

64
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:09,620
Like obviously if you don't have

65
00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:10,280
good margins,

66
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:12,090
don't be given like $500 off your

67
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:12,840
first order.

68
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:15,140
So a great test to ask yourself

69
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:15,560
is,

70
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:16,640
if I was given this offer,

71
00:01:16,689 --> 00:01:18,500
would I exchange my email for it?

72
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:19,739
So make sure you're testing all

73
00:01:19,739 --> 00:01:20,640
these different styles.

74
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:22,840
Do percent off versus dollar off.

75
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:24,200
So this is a great test to do.

76
00:01:24,569 --> 00:01:25,859
Typically if your average order

77
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:26,200
value

78
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:27,680
is below $100, you want to do

79
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:28,489
percent off.

80
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:29,439
If your average order value is

81
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:30,159
above $100,

82
00:01:30,189 --> 00:01:31,200
you want to do dollar off.

83
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:33,299
Because say your product sells

84
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:33,739
for,

85
00:01:33,769 --> 00:01:36,400
say your product is $50,

86
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:37,859
that's your average order value.

87
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:40,450
You could either say, so 10%,

88
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:41,510
say you want your offer to be

89
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:42,480
around like 10%.

90
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:45,069
So 10% of $50 is $5.

91
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,709
So you're telling people, hey, $5

92
00:01:46,709 --> 00:01:47,140
off.

93
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:49,670
That doesn't sound as good as 10%

94
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:50,219
off.

95
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:51,689
Would you rather have $5 off or

96
00:01:51,819 --> 00:01:52,480
10% off?

97
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:53,780
Probably 5% off.

98
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:55,099
Meanwhile, if your average order

99
00:01:55,099 --> 00:01:55,920
value is $500,

100
00:01:55,989 --> 00:01:57,980
10% would be $50.

101
00:01:58,010 --> 00:01:59,680
Would you rather say, hey, do you

102
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,299
want 10% off

103
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:01,519
or do you want $50 off?

104
00:02:01,549 --> 00:02:02,500
Do you want a $50 bill?

105
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:04,340
That sounds a lot better.

106
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:05,579
So make sure you test those,

107
00:02:05,609 --> 00:02:07,459
but that's just a way to start.

108
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,099
A mystery discount is a great way

109
00:02:09,099 --> 00:02:09,599
as well.

110
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:10,520
Say no matter what,

111
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:12,000
you want to give somebody 10% off,

112
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:12,960
you could just frame it as a

113
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,560
mystery discount

114
00:02:13,629 --> 00:02:15,060
and then be like, open your email

115
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:15,919
for your mystery discount.

116
00:02:15,949 --> 00:02:16,879
That can work well.

117
00:02:16,909 --> 00:02:18,520
You could do a free X with like

118
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,400
your order.

119
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,020
So get a free pair of socks with

120
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:22,240
an order of pants,

121
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:23,319
something like that.

122
00:02:23,409 --> 00:02:24,159
You could do free shipping.

123
00:02:24,189 --> 00:02:25,469
You could do like a giveaway

124
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:26,000
entry.

125
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:27,460
Like every month you do a giveaway

126
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:28,860
for Cybertruck.

127
00:02:28,889 --> 00:02:30,139
It doesn't need to be that crazy.

128
00:02:30,169 --> 00:02:31,439
You can do a giveaway, sign up for

129
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:32,060
a giveaway.

130
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:33,379
You can do a free guide,

131
00:02:33,409 --> 00:02:35,509
like how to do XYZ in X amount of

132
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:35,939
days,

133
00:02:35,969 --> 00:02:37,409
or you could do like early access.

134
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:38,349
That's something that you could

135
00:02:38,349 --> 00:02:38,439
do.

136
00:02:38,469 --> 00:02:39,270
If you don't want to offer any

137
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:39,680
discount,

138
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:41,129
you could just say, hey, sign up

139
00:02:41,129 --> 00:02:41,699
to our email list

140
00:02:41,729 --> 00:02:43,120
for like early access on all this

141
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:43,419
stuff

142
00:02:43,449 --> 00:02:44,090
or something.

143
00:02:44,129 --> 00:02:44,960
You just want to make sure that

144
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,500
it's enticing

145
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:47,099
because typically sign up to our

146
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:47,629
newsletter

147
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,879
for free tips and content.

148
00:02:49,909 --> 00:02:51,219
That's not really enticing enough.

149
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:52,280
So you really want to make it,

150
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,199
you want to make sure there's a

151
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:53,919
value prop in there.

152
00:02:53,949 --> 00:02:55,800
So make sure that you do that

153
00:02:55,819 --> 00:02:56,490
if you're not doing a discount.

154
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:58,240
So now that you have your offer,

155
00:02:58,270 --> 00:02:59,719
we want to choose what type of

156
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,680
form that we want.

157
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:02,000
So different forms are going to

158
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:02,139
have

159
00:03:02,169 --> 00:03:03,219
different effectiveness based on

160
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:03,840
your audience.

161
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:05,520
Depends on like how the form loads

162
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:06,300
and all that good stuff.

163
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:07,490
It's important to give all of

164
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:08,229
these forms a shot

165
00:03:08,289 --> 00:03:09,719
and see what resonates best

166
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:10,979
because truly you don't know.

167
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:12,539
It doesn't matter what you think.

168
00:03:12,569 --> 00:03:13,960
What matters is the numbers.

169
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:14,770
What do the numbers say?

170
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:15,860
So start with one and then test

171
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:16,199
from there.

172
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:17,280
Your best bet is going to be the

173
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:17,680
classic

174
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:18,409
or the micro commit.

175
00:03:18,469 --> 00:03:19,520
So here's what the classic looks

176
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:19,919
like.

177
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:21,400
It's literally just a simple,

178
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:23,300
hey, take this off your order

179
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:24,039
or whatever it is

180
00:03:24,069 --> 00:03:25,039
and then they enter their email

181
00:03:25,069 --> 00:03:26,120
and then you're good to go.

182
00:03:26,169 --> 00:03:27,400
Then you also have the micro

183
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:27,800
commit,

184
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:29,199
which is just an extra step

185
00:03:29,229 --> 00:03:31,330
before the enter your email.

186
00:03:31,389 --> 00:03:32,280
So the micro commit,

187
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:33,580
just before the email,

188
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:34,659
you say, do you want this

189
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:35,240
discount?

190
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:36,719
And this works really well.

191
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:37,860
A lot of times this performs

192
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:38,979
better on mobile

193
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:40,020
for some reason.

194
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:41,379
It's just the commitment bias.

195
00:03:41,409 --> 00:03:42,360
That is the reason.

196
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:43,800
It's a psychology trick,

197
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:45,740
which essentially this seems

198
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:46,949
a very low barrier to entry for

199
00:03:46,949 --> 00:03:47,219
somebody.

200
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:48,039
It's just 10% off.

201
00:03:48,069 --> 00:03:49,080
Yeah, I want 10% off.

202
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:49,770
So they click it

203
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:51,219
and then they've already committed

204
00:03:51,229 --> 00:03:51,840
something.

205
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:52,919
So they're already like down the

206
00:03:52,939 --> 00:03:53,240
funnel.

207
00:03:53,259 --> 00:03:53,590
So they're like,

208
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:54,680
I might as well just enter my

209
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,080
email.

210
00:03:55,129 --> 00:03:56,840
So that works a lot better.

211
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,099
In some cases,

212
00:03:58,129 --> 00:03:59,000
depends on the audience.

213
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,759
You have the quiz here.

214
00:04:00,909 --> 00:04:01,759
So you could be,

215
00:04:01,789 --> 00:04:02,979
you could gamify it a little bit.

216
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:03,330
So you say,

217
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:04,729
hey, you've got this discount.

218
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:06,020
You just have to tell us this.

219
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:07,099
And then it really,

220
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:08,650
it's the same sort of thing.

221
00:04:08,689 --> 00:04:09,219
They don't know

222
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:09,990
that they have to enter their

223
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:10,199
email

224
00:04:10,229 --> 00:04:11,030
and they're much more likely to

225
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:11,539
enter it here.

226
00:04:11,569 --> 00:04:12,460
Then also it feels like

227
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:13,419
they earned their discount.

228
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:14,110
It's like, oh, okay,

229
00:04:14,139 --> 00:04:15,159
I gave them this information

230
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,120
in exchange for this discount.

231
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:17,120
I'll claim my discount

232
00:04:17,149 --> 00:04:17,779
because I earned it.

233
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:19,240
So that works really well.

234
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:20,310
And you also get information

235
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:21,480
about the customer this way,

236
00:04:21,509 --> 00:04:22,420
which is very, very good.

237
00:04:22,449 --> 00:04:24,180
You also have the spin to win,

238
00:04:24,209 --> 00:04:24,870
which is only available

239
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:25,899
on some platforms.

240
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:26,899
Just spin to win,

241
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:27,939
get this discount.

242
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:29,019
In most cases,

243
00:04:29,689 --> 00:04:30,279
in all cases,

244
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,519
you just have it land

245
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:33,000
on like whatever the discount is.

246
00:04:33,069 --> 00:04:34,389
Make it the highest offer though.

247
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:35,480
So spin to win,

248
00:04:35,529 --> 00:04:36,240
win this,

249
00:04:36,269 --> 00:04:36,879
congrats,

250
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:37,230
you won it,

251
00:04:37,329 --> 00:04:38,379
enter your email to claim it.

252
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:39,449
Then you also have something

253
00:04:39,589 --> 00:04:40,639
like the uncover your discount

254
00:04:40,709 --> 00:04:41,470
where it's a little bit more

255
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:41,920
gamified.

256
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:43,199
This isn't going to work

257
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:43,870
for all brands

258
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:44,759
in terms of like branding,

259
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:46,149
but just like choose this

260
00:04:46,149 --> 00:04:46,519
discount,

261
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:47,180
uncover your,

262
00:04:47,209 --> 00:04:48,639
or choose a box,

263
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:49,680
uncover your discount

264
00:04:49,709 --> 00:04:51,379
and it's a lot more engaging

265
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:51,899
for somebody.

266
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:53,139
So those are the different

267
00:04:53,139 --> 00:04:53,720
options.

268
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:54,069
Typically,

269
00:04:54,149 --> 00:04:54,959
you're going to go

270
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:56,300
with like one of these two

271
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:58,120
in 90% of cases,

272
00:04:58,149 --> 00:04:58,920
that's just what you're going to

273
00:04:58,930 --> 00:04:59,139
do.

274
00:04:59,689 --> 00:05:00,009
Three,

275
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:01,339
we need to create your form

276
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:02,379
in Klaviyo or Amped.

277
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:02,879
Klaviyo and Amped

278
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:04,829
are different pop-ups platforms.

279
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:05,800
So Klaviyo is just,

280
00:05:05,829 --> 00:05:06,759
hopefully you're using that

281
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:07,540
for your email marketing.

282
00:05:07,569 --> 00:05:09,160
And then Amped

283
00:05:09,189 --> 00:05:10,300
is a separate pop-up platform,

284
00:05:10,329 --> 00:05:11,379
which is a different,

285
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:13,310
it's a separate cost for you,

286
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:14,399
but it's really,

287
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:14,790
really good.

288
00:05:14,829 --> 00:05:16,110
I love Amped.

289
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,860
We see a lot better results

290
00:05:17,889 --> 00:05:19,079
on Amped for our clients

291
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,160
and so I would highly recommend

292
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:20,420
it,

293
00:05:20,769 --> 00:05:21,819
but it is an extra cost.

294
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:23,779
The ROI is like worth it always.

295
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:25,379
If you have a 10% form on Klaviyo,

296
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:26,459
a lot of times you can get it

297
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:27,600
to like 15% on Amped.

298
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:29,720
So tutorials will be provided

299
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:30,800
in a future module.

300
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:32,300
Four, you want to run your form

301
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:33,639
through this winning checklist

302
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:35,339
in terms of how it is laid out.

303
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:36,420
We only want to ask

304
00:05:36,509 --> 00:05:37,800
for one input per step,

305
00:05:37,829 --> 00:05:38,800
so we don't want to ask

306
00:05:38,829 --> 00:05:39,759
what's your email,

307
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:40,699
what's your phone number,

308
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:42,819
what is your birth certificate,

309
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:43,399
I don't know.

310
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:44,819
You don't want to ask anything

311
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:45,800
besides just one thing.

312
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:47,199
If you want to get multiple things

313
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:48,300
like email and phone number,

314
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:49,639
ask for email first

315
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:50,709
and then phone number

316
00:05:50,829 --> 00:05:51,560
in the next step.

317
00:05:51,589 --> 00:05:53,220
So that's going to drastically

318
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:54,160
improve your conversions

319
00:05:54,189 --> 00:05:55,040
because if somebody sees

320
00:05:55,069 --> 00:05:55,720
so many inputs,

321
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:56,500
they're just going to X out.

322
00:05:56,529 --> 00:05:56,759
They're like,

323
00:05:56,779 --> 00:05:57,519
I don't want to do all that.

324
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:58,990
If you do it one by one,

325
00:05:59,029 --> 00:06:00,720
you at least get some information.

326
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,579
So we also want to make sure

327
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:04,319
the time delay is 4 to 12 seconds

328
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:05,060
because we don't want

329
00:06:05,089 --> 00:06:05,839
to fire it right away.

330
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:06,459
It's going to hurt

331
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:07,240
the customer experience.

332
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:08,220
We want to give it a little delay.

333
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,339
We also want the form

334
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,240
to load instantly

335
00:06:11,269 --> 00:06:12,480
after the delay.

336
00:06:12,509 --> 00:06:13,500
So say it's four seconds,

337
00:06:13,529 --> 00:06:14,100
we want the form

338
00:06:14,129 --> 00:06:15,170
to just pop up instantly

339
00:06:15,269 --> 00:06:16,519
and not like load in.

340
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:18,000
Usually that's going to happen

341
00:06:18,089 --> 00:06:19,519
like if your image files

342
00:06:19,569 --> 00:06:20,160
are too big

343
00:06:20,189 --> 00:06:21,319
so you'd want to compress it.

344
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:22,220
So you want to make sure

345
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,279
that it loads instantly

346
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:23,959
with no lag.

347
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:24,860
We want our form

348
00:06:24,889 --> 00:06:26,120
to cover at least 75%

349
00:06:26,149 --> 00:06:26,639
of the screen.

350
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:27,420
The bigger the form,

351
00:06:27,449 --> 00:06:28,500
typically the better it performs.

352
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:29,660
We want it to have

353
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:30,740
under 10 words of copy.

354
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,189
Don't try to give somebody

355
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:32,990
a ton of information.

356
00:06:33,029 --> 00:06:34,000
Just trust me.

357
00:06:34,029 --> 00:06:35,300
You can test it yourself.

358
00:06:35,329 --> 00:06:36,370
Put a bunch of information

359
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:37,680
on what somebody gets

360
00:06:37,709 --> 00:06:38,370
in the email list

361
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:39,060
and then just have one

362
00:06:39,089 --> 00:06:39,560
where it's just like,

363
00:06:39,589 --> 00:06:40,660
you're 10% off.

364
00:06:40,689 --> 00:06:43,079
And I can almost promise you

365
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:43,839
it's going to perform better.

366
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:45,000
We want to make sure

367
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:45,920
the offer is the largest

368
00:06:45,949 --> 00:06:47,000
aspect of the form

369
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:49,360
so that like 10% off

370
00:06:49,389 --> 00:06:50,259
isn't a small part of it.

371
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:50,949
We literally want it

372
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:52,019
to be 10% off

373
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:52,810
so somebody literally

374
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:53,509
can't miss it

375
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:55,180
so that even a blind person

376
00:06:55,209 --> 00:06:55,699
could see it.

377
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:56,680
And then also,

378
00:06:56,709 --> 00:06:57,939
this is a bonus,

379
00:06:57,970 --> 00:06:59,660
but there's no X button,

380
00:06:59,689 --> 00:07:00,399
but rather like a

381
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:01,240
closed form button

382
00:07:01,269 --> 00:07:02,319
underneath the submit button.

383
00:07:02,449 --> 00:07:03,089
So rather than putting

384
00:07:03,129 --> 00:07:03,600
like an X

385
00:07:03,629 --> 00:07:04,360
in the top right corner

386
00:07:04,389 --> 00:07:04,920
of your pop-up,

387
00:07:04,949 --> 00:07:06,329
everybody's conditioned

388
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:06,939
at this point

389
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:08,220
to just right when

390
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:08,839
they see a pop-up,

391
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:09,600
they just go to the top

392
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:10,389
right corner and click it

393
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,069
without even looking.

394
00:07:11,649 --> 00:07:13,939
So if we can put the X

395
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:14,680
somewhere else

396
00:07:14,709 --> 00:07:16,139
or just have a closed form button

397
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:17,459
underneath like the submit button,

398
00:07:17,509 --> 00:07:18,220
it forces somebody

399
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:18,959
to look at the offer

400
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:19,980
and then close from there.

401
00:07:20,009 --> 00:07:21,459
So highly recommend doing that.

402
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:22,459
Then five,

403
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:23,120
we want to set up

404
00:07:23,149 --> 00:07:24,139
our A-B test.

405
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:25,139
So no form's going to be

406
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:26,019
perfect on the first go.

407
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:27,339
You must be setting up tests

408
00:07:27,389 --> 00:07:28,430
at least weekly

409
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:29,779
to slowly inch up your form.

410
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:32,279
So just to really help you

411
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:33,180
understand this,

412
00:07:33,209 --> 00:07:34,490
for every 1% increase

413
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:35,019
in conversions

414
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:35,879
that you're able to get,

415
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:36,670
which is very easy

416
00:07:36,709 --> 00:07:37,370
on pop-up forms,

417
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:38,540
on 10,000 visitors,

418
00:07:38,569 --> 00:07:40,019
that's an extra 100 subscribers.

419
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:41,480
Imagine 100 people

420
00:07:41,509 --> 00:07:42,160
standing in a line.

421
00:07:42,189 --> 00:07:43,230
Literally just from

422
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,139
a little A-B test,

423
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:45,000
that is what you can get.

424
00:07:45,029 --> 00:07:45,810
So make sure that you're

425
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:46,899
setting up your A-B tests.

426
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:49,399
And these are the top 7 A-B tests

427
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:50,259
that you should be running

428
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:50,720
on your form.

429
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:51,959
We have the offer,

430
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:53,360
highest level that you can test,

431
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:54,420
try the different offers

432
00:07:54,449 --> 00:07:55,860
outlined above that I showed,

433
00:07:55,889 --> 00:07:57,680
and even try doing

434
00:07:57,709 --> 00:07:58,420
the mystery offer,

435
00:07:58,649 --> 00:08:00,569
even if you want to give $10 off,

436
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:01,920
have your pop-up be,

437
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:03,379
hey, sign up and get

438
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,129
a mystery offer.

439
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:05,420
Sometimes that can perform better.

440
00:08:05,449 --> 00:08:06,639
Two, we want to test

441
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:07,439
different form types,

442
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:08,740
so it's another very large lever,

443
00:08:08,769 --> 00:08:10,000
so try the different form types

444
00:08:10,029 --> 00:08:10,600
that I went over.

445
00:08:10,629 --> 00:08:11,459
Try micro commit,

446
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:12,100
try regular,

447
00:08:12,129 --> 00:08:13,000
try doing a quiz,

448
00:08:13,029 --> 00:08:14,079
try doing a spin to win.

449
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:15,860
You can even test out things

450
00:08:15,889 --> 00:08:16,740
like doing a pop-up

451
00:08:16,769 --> 00:08:18,050
versus like a full page

452
00:08:18,089 --> 00:08:19,990
versus like a fly-out,

453
00:08:20,029 --> 00:08:20,839
which are all settings

454
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:21,620
inside of Klaviyo.

455
00:08:21,649 --> 00:08:23,740
Three, our closed form

456
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:24,329
functionality,

457
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:26,100
so try using the closed form

458
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:26,379
button

459
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:27,459
versus the X in the corner,

460
00:08:27,529 --> 00:08:28,540
see if that performs better,

461
00:08:28,649 --> 00:08:29,660
try an X in the other corner.

462
00:08:29,689 --> 00:08:31,339
Try saying closed form,

463
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:32,740
try saying no thanks,

464
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:33,639
I don't want this discount.

465
00:08:33,668 --> 00:08:35,120
That's something that you can do.

466
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:36,500
Time delay,

467
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:38,240
so we want to make sure,

468
00:08:38,269 --> 00:08:39,320
so you can do four seconds

469
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:40,029
versus 12 seconds,

470
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:40,980
we just want to make sure

471
00:08:41,009 --> 00:08:41,820
that we're maximizing

472
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:42,580
and choosing the winner

473
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:43,600
based on the total number

474
00:08:43,629 --> 00:08:44,080
of submits,

475
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:45,559
because, for example,

476
00:08:45,649 --> 00:08:48,700
if you have a 60-second delay

477
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:50,000
on your pop-up form

478
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:50,620
and you're running that

479
00:08:50,649 --> 00:08:51,679
versus like a four-second delay,

480
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:53,080
usually if somebody's been

481
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:54,159
on your site for 60 seconds,

482
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:55,019
they're going to take a discount,

483
00:08:55,259 --> 00:08:55,590
so you might have

484
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:56,759
a really high conversion rate

485
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:57,490
on that pop-up.

486
00:08:57,549 --> 00:08:58,379
Somebody's been looking

487
00:08:58,409 --> 00:08:59,190
at your website for a while

488
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:00,519
and so maybe you have

489
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:02,529
like a 10% conversion rate

490
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:03,730
on a 60-second delay.

491
00:09:03,769 --> 00:09:04,980
The problem with that

492
00:09:05,009 --> 00:09:05,559
is how many people

493
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:06,919
are on your site for 60 seconds?

494
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:08,139
Not a lot,

495
00:09:08,169 --> 00:09:09,220
versus compared to

496
00:09:09,269 --> 00:09:09,740
like how many people

497
00:09:09,769 --> 00:09:10,200
are on your site

498
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:11,279
for four seconds.

499
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:12,879
So maybe you have

500
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:14,139
a 5% converting form

501
00:09:14,169 --> 00:09:14,899
at four seconds

502
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:17,029
and a 10% converting form

503
00:09:17,169 --> 00:09:19,679
at 60 seconds,

504
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:20,960
but the total submits

505
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:21,500
is going to go

506
00:09:21,529 --> 00:09:22,190
to the four-second

507
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:23,279
because a lot more people

508
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:23,940
are seeing it

509
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:24,820
and so I'd rather have

510
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:27,490
5% of 10,000

511
00:09:27,529 --> 00:09:30,139
rather than 10% of 1,000.

512
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:31,210
So make sure

513
00:09:31,289 --> 00:09:31,899
that you're looking at that.

514
00:09:31,929 --> 00:09:33,179
Five, you can test

515
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:33,850
different photos

516
00:09:33,889 --> 00:09:34,700
and photo content,

517
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:35,620
kind of like the design

518
00:09:35,649 --> 00:09:37,080
overall look of your pop-up.

519
00:09:38,029 --> 00:09:38,759
You should test

520
00:09:38,789 --> 00:09:39,700
the placement of your photos

521
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:41,820
also, either like in the form

522
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:42,759
or like as the backdrop

523
00:09:42,789 --> 00:09:43,740
so test photo content.

524
00:09:43,769 --> 00:09:44,809
You can test the copy

525
00:09:44,909 --> 00:09:46,139
so you can try

526
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:47,200
unlock my offer

527
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:48,620
versus unlock this offer,

528
00:09:48,649 --> 00:09:49,480
claim this offer

529
00:09:49,509 --> 00:09:50,419
and then colors.

530
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:51,299
Not a massive lever

531
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:52,340
but it can make a difference.

532
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:53,340
Typically the less colors

533
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:54,029
you have the better.

534
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:54,960
Try different shades,

535
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:55,480
try white,

536
00:09:55,509 --> 00:09:56,039
try black,

537
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:56,779
try different colors

538
00:09:56,809 --> 00:09:57,799
and these are all

539
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:58,840
in order from

540
00:09:58,870 --> 00:09:59,799
highest effectiveness,

541
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:00,740
highest levers

542
00:10:00,769 --> 00:10:01,960
to lowest levers.

543
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:02,860
So make sure

544
00:10:02,889 --> 00:10:03,700
that you test these out

545
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:05,000
and then you can have

546
00:10:05,029 --> 00:10:05,820
some great form.

547
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:07,139
So that is the fifth step

548
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:07,440
is to test
