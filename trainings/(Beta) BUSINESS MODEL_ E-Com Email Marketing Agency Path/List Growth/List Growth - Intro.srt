1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:01,750
All right let's talk about the

2
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:03,500
thing that most people F up and

3
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:04,820
that is list growth.

4
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:05,610
That is what

5
00:00:05,809 --> 00:00:06,780
this next module is going to be

6
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:07,009
on.

7
00:00:07,009 --> 00:00:08,009
How do you grow your list?

8
00:00:08,089 --> 00:00:09,140
How do you get more people on

9
00:00:09,449 --> 00:00:09,779
your list?

10
00:00:09,779 --> 00:00:10,990
And how do you do it effectively

11
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:12,099
to where you're getting the most

12
00:00:12,259 --> 00:00:12,789
out of like the

13
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:14,250
site traffic that you're bringing?

14
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:15,130
So let's talk about it.

15
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:16,370
So there are four methods of list

16
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:16,640
growth,

17
00:00:16,829 --> 00:00:17,989
four main methods.

18
00:00:17,989 --> 00:00:19,839
We have pop-up forms, we have

19
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:21,920
post-purchase opt-ins, we have

20
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:22,940
sign-up pages,

21
00:00:23,129 --> 00:00:24,379
and sign-up embeds.

22
00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:26,100
Now kind of in this order is

23
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:28,339
typically how people come in in

24
00:00:28,339 --> 00:00:29,160
terms of like

25
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:29,530
numbers.

26
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:30,570
Like most people are going to come

27
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:31,260
in from pop-ups, then

28
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:32,179
post-purchase opt-ins,

29
00:00:32,368 --> 00:00:33,759
sign-up pages, and then sign-up

30
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:34,270
embeds.

31
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:35,700
So let's just talk real quick.

32
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,700
Who is more likely to make

33
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:39,049
more money this year?

34
00:00:39,049 --> 00:00:40,090
So we have brand A.

35
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,799
They currently have 10,000 email

36
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,200
subscribers but they

37
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:46,469
also gain 2,000 subscribers a

38
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:47,030
month.

39
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:49,719
In brand B, they have 20,000 email

40
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:51,359
subscribers but they gain

41
00:00:51,549 --> 00:00:53,359
250 subscribers a month.

42
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:53,960
Huh?

43
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:54,579
Huh?

44
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,409
What do you think?

45
00:00:56,409 --> 00:00:59,600
I'm going with brand A because the

46
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,759
value of new

47
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,509
subscribers is just much higher

48
00:01:02,509 --> 00:01:03,939
than old subscribers who are

49
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:06,750
probably, you have 20,000 current

50
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:07,040
email

51
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:09,170
subscribers, probably only 5,000

52
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:10,469
of them are still engaged.

53
00:01:10,469 --> 00:01:11,719
And then for this, there's

54
00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:12,439
probably only

55
00:01:12,609 --> 00:01:14,450
like 4,000, 3,000 people that are

56
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:15,180
still engaged.

57
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:17,159
And you're gaining 250 a month.

58
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:18,799
It's going to be

59
00:01:18,989 --> 00:01:20,540
very hard to convert people right

60
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:22,019
off the bat and get sales right

61
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:23,620
off the bat because there's kind

62
00:01:23,769 --> 00:01:24,790
of that honeymoon phase.

63
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,000
After somebody signs up within

64
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,560
that first like 6 to 12 months,

65
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,140
that's a

66
00:01:28,329 --> 00:01:29,430
honeymoon phase where somebody's

67
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:30,680
probably going to place multiple

68
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,859
orders with you if you can make

69
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:32,000
the

70
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:33,680
customer experience correct.

71
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,359
And also, subscribers will just

72
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:36,379
naturally churn.

73
00:01:36,379 --> 00:01:37,359
Over time, people will

74
00:01:37,549 --> 00:01:38,599
naturally lose interest to your

75
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:39,569
brand and your emails.

76
00:01:39,569 --> 00:01:40,909
Like you can't, you can't expect

77
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:41,219
somebody

78
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:42,489
to be a part of your brand forever

79
00:01:42,489 --> 00:01:43,819
unless you're like Starbucks.

80
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:44,920
Like people will move on and

81
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,340
that's

82
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:46,340
just part of the game.

83
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:47,290
So you always need to be

84
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:48,390
replenishing your active

85
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:49,359
subscribers at a higher

86
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:50,680
rate than you're losing them.

87
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,109
If you lose 100 subscribers a

88
00:01:52,109 --> 00:01:53,799
month, you should be gaining at

89
00:01:53,819 --> 00:01:54,079
least

90
00:01:54,269 --> 00:01:54,719
200.

91
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:56,280
So in this situation, this, these

92
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,609
current email subscribers are

93
00:01:57,739 --> 00:01:58,900
probably slowly going to be

94
00:01:59,170 --> 00:01:59,430
falling off.

95
00:01:59,469 --> 00:02:00,420
Same as here, but we're getting

96
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,700
2,000 a month extra and we're

97
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,409
getting, we're gaining 250

98
00:02:03,609 --> 00:02:04,480
subscribers a month.

99
00:02:04,549 --> 00:02:06,120
Now they're probably just going to

100
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:06,939
be flatlining.

101
00:02:06,939 --> 00:02:08,758
If you're gaining 250,

102
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:11,520
they're probably getting like 250

103
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,159
unsubscribes a month.

104
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:15,560
So that's why I am taking brand A.

105
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,030
So

106
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:18,409
let's talk about people need

107
00:02:18,409 --> 00:02:20,159
content to convert.

108
00:02:20,219 --> 00:02:22,939
So again, there are thousands of

109
00:02:22,939 --> 00:02:23,699
econ brands in your

110
00:02:23,889 --> 00:02:25,139
niche that are out there and just

111
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,729
people need info about your brand

112
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:27,389
to convert.

113
00:02:27,389 --> 00:02:28,500
And people just don't

114
00:02:28,689 --> 00:02:29,560
trust you right off the bat.

115
00:02:29,629 --> 00:02:30,740
They've seen one ad from you.

116
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:32,050
They're not going to trust you.

117
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:32,490
So it's just

118
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:33,770
very rare for somebody to go to

119
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:35,069
your site and buy the first time

120
00:02:35,069 --> 00:02:36,479
they see you and just buy right on

121
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:37,050
the spot.

122
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:38,590
So you need to get their email.

123
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:40,180
That's the importance of email is

124
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:41,240
to send these people

125
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:42,889
content, nurture them to get them

126
00:02:42,889 --> 00:02:44,250
over the edge, to get them to

127
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:44,759
trust you.

128
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,060
Rule of seven, somebody needs

129
00:02:46,259 --> 00:02:47,639
to see your brand seven times in

130
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:49,000
order to trust you enough to

131
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,629
purchase.

132
00:02:49,629 --> 00:02:50,919
That's the whole basis of

133
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,189
everything here.

134
00:02:52,189 --> 00:02:54,110
And email is the cheapest way to

135
00:02:54,259 --> 00:02:54,860
do this.

136
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:57,879
So the value of a new subscribers,

137
00:02:57,879 --> 00:02:58,580
new subscribers

138
00:02:58,639 --> 00:02:59,710
are just worth more than past

139
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:00,449
subscribers.

140
00:03:00,449 --> 00:03:02,539
They just opted into your list and

141
00:03:02,539 --> 00:03:03,400
they're probably ready to

142
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:03,819
buy.

143
00:03:03,819 --> 00:03:05,310
They're in the honeymoon phase.

144
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,360
There's fresh interest.

145
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,900
They're probably going to buy

146
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:08,240
within the

147
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:09,240
next couple of weeks.

148
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,620
They're probably, they probably

149
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:11,780
have a strong need for your

150
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:12,689
product and

151
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,789
they're looking at you versus a

152
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,900
couple other competitors.

153
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,500
I was looking at getting an ice

154
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:16,830
bath

155
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:17,509
recently.

156
00:03:17,539 --> 00:03:19,099
And so I opted in, I went to a few

157
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:20,710
different sites, got offered

158
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,259
discounts, joined their email

159
00:03:22,449 --> 00:03:22,560
lists.

160
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,389
And then I was kind of in this

161
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,289
phase where I was going to buy

162
00:03:24,289 --> 00:03:25,039
from one of them.

163
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:25,789
And I ended up going with

164
00:03:25,979 --> 00:03:26,759
the one that I had the best

165
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:27,819
relationship with and I thought

166
00:03:27,849 --> 00:03:29,080
they connected with me the most.

167
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:29,400
And so

168
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:30,819
that right there, value of a new

169
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,539
subscriber.

170
00:03:31,539 --> 00:03:33,159
Whereas old subscribers, you could

171
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:33,490
have a hundred

172
00:03:33,689 --> 00:03:34,650
thousand people on your email

173
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:35,870
list, but five thousand of them

174
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:36,699
may only be active.

175
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,819
And so that's why we

176
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:39,189
really need to focus on these

177
00:03:39,189 --> 00:03:40,210
fresh subscribers.

178
00:03:40,289 --> 00:03:41,740
So it's as simple as more people

179
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:42,740
joining your list,

180
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:44,129
the more money you make.

181
00:03:44,129 --> 00:03:46,469
If a brand getting 20,000 email

182
00:03:46,469 --> 00:03:48,060
subscribers new a month, it's

183
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:48,349
going to make

184
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,270
more than a brand getting 10,000.

185
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:51,580
So it's really just that simple.

186
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:52,500
It is that simple.

187
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,639
Get more people on

188
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:54,409
your list.

189
00:03:54,409 --> 00:03:56,159
If you double your list growth

190
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,090
over the long run, you're going to

191
00:03:58,189 --> 00:03:59,419
be doubling your revenue

192
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:00,789
because twice as more people to

193
