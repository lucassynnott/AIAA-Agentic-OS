1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,169
Okay, so before we really get into

2
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:03,779
what makes good copy, you're

3
00:00:03,799 --> 00:00:04,940
probably already writing copy,

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,139
and you could be making these

5
00:00:06,139 --> 00:00:06,719
mistakes.

6
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:08,179
So I want to first talk about what

7
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,400
to avoid in your copy

8
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:11,250
so that we can be clear on what we

9
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:12,169
need to have.

10
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:14,179
Sometimes it can be better to just

11
00:00:14,179 --> 00:00:15,000
go over what

12
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:16,640
not to do, and that tells you what

13
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:17,109
to do.

14
00:00:17,109 --> 00:00:18,750
So let's talk about what to avoid

15
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:19,629
in your copy.

16
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:20,199
So as we

17
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:22,390
went over, 2024, 2025 customer is

18
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:23,440
different than the past.

19
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:24,829
Their attention spans are shorter

20
00:00:24,829 --> 00:00:25,160
than

21
00:00:25,219 --> 00:00:25,679
ever.

22
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:27,980
We really need to understand that.

23
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,589
If you look at tracking on

24
00:00:29,589 --> 00:00:31,300
websites and on ads and whatnot,

25
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:32,560
it just keeps on shrinking.

26
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,969
The average watch time just keeps

27
00:00:33,969 --> 00:00:34,670
on going down.

28
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:35,929
Same thing applies to

29
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:36,509
emails.

30
00:00:36,509 --> 00:00:38,189
So we need to understand that.

31
00:00:38,189 --> 00:00:39,929
Our time, we're on the clock with

32
00:00:39,929 --> 00:00:41,200
having people's attention.

33
00:00:41,259 --> 00:00:42,560
So we really need to make the most

34
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:42,850
of it.

35
00:00:42,929 --> 00:00:44,100
So we need to make sure that we

36
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,179
are avoiding this.

37
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:45,520
So

38
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:47,140
first thing to avoid, unnecessary

39
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:47,899
information.

40
00:00:47,899 --> 00:00:49,429
You always hear it, copy, keep it

41
00:00:49,429 --> 00:00:50,460
nice and concise.

42
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,079
We really, really, really, really

43
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:54,340
need to live up to that with our

44
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:54,899
emails.

45
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:55,960
A lot of the copy that I

46
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:57,770
see in emails is literally just

47
00:00:57,770 --> 00:00:58,320
fluff.

48
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,700
That is unnecessary.

49
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:00,630
Unnecessary.

50
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,119
For example, when somebody

51
00:01:02,179 --> 00:01:03,759
joins a newsletter, they know that

52
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:05,329
when they join, they enter their

53
00:01:05,329 --> 00:01:06,939
email for like a discount, they

54
00:01:06,989 --> 00:01:07,140
know

55
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,340
they're going to get like

56
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:10,000
exclusive access, sneak peeks,

57
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,769
insights, community, and they kind

58
00:01:11,819 --> 00:01:12,420
of know that

59
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,379
those are fluff words and you kind

60
00:01:14,379 --> 00:01:15,780
of just like say that.

61
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:17,799
So there's no need to waste space

62
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:18,840
talking about

63
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:19,519
that.

64
00:01:19,659 --> 00:01:21,739
Because every, every extra

65
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:24,579
sentence that you add increases

66
00:01:24,579 --> 00:01:26,500
the barrier of entry for a

67
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,019
customer to like

68
00:01:27,079 --> 00:01:28,280
read that and they get more scared

69
00:01:28,299 --> 00:01:29,659
with the more words somebody sees,

70
00:01:29,659 --> 00:01:30,829
the more scared they get and the

71
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:30,980
more

72
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,390
likely they are to leave.

73
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:33,760
And so we really just want to

74
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:35,120
focus our time on useful

75
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,920
information that can be used by

76
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:38,480
the customer, such as your brand

77
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,159
unique selling propositions, your

78
00:01:40,219 --> 00:01:41,439
social proof, all that.

79
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:42,920
A lot of the

80
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:44,819
branded stuff that you might want

81
00:01:44,819 --> 00:01:46,719
to include, a lot of the exclusive

82
00:01:46,819 --> 00:01:48,379
access stuff that you want to

83
00:01:48,379 --> 00:01:48,609
include

84
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,209
just isn't necessary and you

85
00:01:50,209 --> 00:01:51,340
shouldn't use it.

86
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:52,780
I always find that it hurts

87
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,200
conversions to include

88
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:54,640
that stuff.

89
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,680
So every sentence that you're

90
00:01:55,719 --> 00:01:56,980
adding, literally every sentence

91
00:01:56,989 --> 00:01:57,950
that you're adding to your

92
00:01:58,019 --> 00:02:00,150
copy, just ask yourself, does this

93
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:01,909
push the customer closer to a

94
00:02:01,909 --> 00:02:02,400
sale?

95
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,959
That's all you need to know.

96
00:02:04,019 --> 00:02:05,519
So like look at this example.

97
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:07,079
This whole section is complete

98
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:08,000
wasted space.

99
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,900
At this brand,

100
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:10,038

time.

104
00:02:12,819 --> 00:02:13,849

We appreciate style, performance,

107
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,379

00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:16,569

00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:17,780
what you can look forward to.

110
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:19,289
Exclusive offers, expert insights,

00:02:19,289 --> 00:02:20,840
products, sneak peeks, yada yada.

112
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,289
To kick

113
00:02:21,379 --> 00:02:22,189
things off, here's a 10% off

114
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:22,539
discount.

115
00:02:22,539 --> 00:02:23,259
This is all the person cares

116
00:02:23,259 --> 00:02:23,639
about.

117
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:26,110
All of this stuff is just

118
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:27,919
masking and hiding the discount

119
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:29,039
code that they want.

120
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:31,129
The discount code, which was right

121
00:02:31,129 --> 00:02:31,740
under.

122
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,150
That's, you could delete all this

123
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,509
and just say, welcome to this.

124
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,810
We're excited to have you.

125
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:36,099
To kick

126
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:37,430
things off, here's 10% off.

127
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:38,490
That's going to convert a lot

128
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:38,870
better.

129
00:02:38,889 --> 00:02:39,560
I guarantee it.

130
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,439
All this stuff is just

131
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:40,919
fluff.

132
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:42,060
Don't need all of it.

133
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,490
People are just there for the

134
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,159
discount.

135
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:44,819
I'm sorry.

136
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:46,020
People don't care as much

137
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:46,469
about you.

138
00:02:46,469 --> 00:02:47,400
They care more about their

139
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:47,810
wallets.

140
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:48,889
And so that's just what they're

141
00:02:48,889 --> 00:02:49,340
doing.

142
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:50,240
So that's just

143
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,680
completely unnecessary.

144
00:02:51,699 --> 00:02:52,909
And then another one.

145
00:02:52,909 --> 00:02:54,419
So I tie in design and copy very

146
00:02:54,419 --> 00:02:55,030
closely.

147
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:55,639
I think they

148
00:02:55,699 --> 00:02:56,729
should be hand in hand.

149
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:58,219
And we're going to talk about that

150
00:02:58,219 --> 00:02:58,539
close.

151
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,080
We're going to talk about that

152
00:03:00,139 --> 00:03:00,930
in the future.

153
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,490
But another thing on top of like

154
00:03:02,509 --> 00:03:04,479
unnecessary information, maybe you

155
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:05,039
have good

156
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:07,000
information, but you can't have

157
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,539
too much in your emails.

158
00:03:08,539 --> 00:03:10,219
Too much copy just increases

159
00:03:10,219 --> 00:03:10,860
churn.

160
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:11,460
Even

161
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,479
if you have the helpful info, just

162
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:15,139
nobody's going to read it.

163
00:03:15,139 --> 00:03:17,039
The shorter your copy is, the more

164
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:17,300
likely

165
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,729
someone will actually take the

166
00:03:18,729 --> 00:03:19,550
time to read it.

167
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:20,530
This is an example.

168
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:21,599
This copy is actually

169
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:22,689
good copy.

170
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:24,479
It's talking about like what

171
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:26,780
everybody, what they changed about

172
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,180
like these new bars or

173
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:28,669
whatever.

174
00:03:28,669 --> 00:03:29,830
It's not letting me zoom in, but

175
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:30,819
it's talking about it.

176
00:03:30,819 --> 00:03:32,219
You can, this doc will be attached

177
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,659
for you and so you can read it.

178
00:03:33,689 --> 00:03:35,120
It's a great copy, but nobody's

179
00:03:35,259 --> 00:03:35,909
reading it.

180
00:03:35,909 --> 00:03:37,180
If they just did like this

181
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,270
line and this line, then people

182
00:03:38,349 --> 00:03:38,819
would read it.

183
00:03:38,909 --> 00:03:39,879
But when somebody sees all this

184
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:40,659
copy, they're just going to

185
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:41,650
skip over it, go down here.

186
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:44,960
These little icons did 10x more

187
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,009
the effectiveness and readability

188
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:47,539
for someone.

189
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:48,960
It's just these icons.

190
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,740
People prefer that sort of stuff.

191
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:51,349
And that's what we're going to

192
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:52,340
talk about and what we need to be

193
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,129
doing with our copy.

194
00:03:53,139 --> 00:03:54,879
We can't just list blocks and we

195
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,780
can't have information too long.

196
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:57,960
People aren't going to read that.

197
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:58,750
They're going to see that and get

198
00:03:58,750 --> 00:03:59,030
scared.

199
00:03:59,129 --> 00:04:02,719
Another thing is too many points.

200
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:04,259
So the customer is very,

201
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:05,659
very, very, very, very easy to get

202
00:04:05,659 --> 00:04:06,360
overwhelmed.

203
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,319
So if you try to give your

204
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:09,409
customer five different

205
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:10,889
takeaways, like we are the best,

206
00:04:10,939 --> 00:04:12,319
we have this, we also do this, and

207
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,840
you can also get this, and you can

208
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,310
also get this, they're not going

209
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:16,480
to remember any of them.

210
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,180
Each takeaway would get 20% of

211
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:18,300
their

212
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,110
attention.

213
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:21,449
If you split 100% divided by five,

214
00:04:21,449 --> 00:04:22,100
20%.

215
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:23,860
Whereas if you try to just point

216
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:24,579
on one thing,

217
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,139
such as our product does this

218
00:04:26,139 --> 00:04:28,240
specific benefit, in one takeaway,

219
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,959
much more likely that they're

220
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:30,060
going

221
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,660
to be able to remember it because

222
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,709
that's 100% of their attention.

223
00:04:33,709 --> 00:04:35,540
This below example is great in

224
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:35,819
terms

225
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:37,259
of like talking about benefits for

226
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,720
the customer, but there are just

227
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,100
too many benefits to the point

228
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,439
that the customer isn't really

229
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:42,829
going to take any of them away.

230
00:04:42,829 --> 00:04:44,319
It seems kind of productive to

231
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:44,459
leave

232
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:45,930
out benefits, but we found it

233
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:47,879
immensely to increase conversions.

234
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:49,560
Like right here, they're talking,

235
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:49,740
so

236
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,839
they're talking about the meter

237
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:51,930
block right here, and they're

238
00:04:51,949 --> 00:04:53,339
saying perfect results, no strings

239
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:54,629
attached, durable construction.

240
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:55,629
It has a cook estimator, cook

241
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:57,329
graphs, cooking alerts, multi view

242
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:57,839
cook, all

243
00:04:57,899 --> 00:04:58,560
this stuff.

244
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,079
We kind of just want to focus on

245
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:01,639
one and then meter two plus meter

246
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:02,879
and then meter block.

247
00:05:02,939 --> 00:05:04,519
Like this is all way too much that

248
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:06,120
all this information is on the

249
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,000
landing page.

250
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,910
We want to get people

251
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:08,589
to click.

252
00:05:08,589 --> 00:05:10,329
So we want to tease some stuff,

253
00:05:10,329 --> 00:05:12,220
give them one of the benefits such

254
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:13,819
as you have, you get

255
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:16,000
perfect results because you remove

256
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,730
guest work, because you're

257
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:19,220
tracking like on your phone,

258
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:20,120
whatever it may be.

259
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:21,509
Then you could have one that's all

260
00:05:21,509 --> 00:05:22,819
about no strings attached.

261
00:05:22,819 --> 00:05:23,560
There are no strings.

262
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:24,649
It's all mobile and wireless so

263
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:25,829
that you can take it anywhere.

264
00:05:25,829 --> 00:05:27,240
This could be split into like six

265
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,680
different emails and it would just

266
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:30,139
be way better for the customer to

267
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:31,240
take everything in.

268
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,600
So that's kind

269
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:33,889
of the philosophy there.

270
00:05:33,899 --> 00:05:35,639
And then also boring.

271
00:05:35,649 --> 00:05:38,189
Avoid being boring in your copy.

272
00:05:38,189 --> 00:05:39,350
No one wants to buy

273
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:40,310
from a lame brand.

274
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:41,850
They want to buy from brands they

275
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:42,259
like.

276
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:44,100
So that seems obvious.

277
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:44,939
If a copy is lame

278
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,350
and they're not, you're not giving

279
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:47,720
them dopamine, they're not going

280
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:48,470
to come back.

281
00:05:48,509 --> 00:05:49,339
And so include

282
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:51,699
powerful words, include puns and

283
00:05:51,699 --> 00:05:54,149
cute humor and then information.

284
00:05:54,149 --> 00:05:56,139
Also, if you can give valuable

285
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,949
information, then people will

286
00:05:57,949 --> 00:05:58,740
enjoy that.

287
00:05:58,740 --> 00:05:59,959
People like to learn.

288
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,769
People like to see that sort of

289
00:06:01,829 --> 00:06:02,100
stuff.

290
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,220
And so this is an example of just

291
00:06:03,269 --> 00:06:03,750
lame copy.

292
00:06:03,829 --> 00:06:05,019
Maximum coverage and comfort in a

293
00:06:05,139 --> 00:06:05,620
lightweight

294
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,060
performance fabric that blocks UV

295
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:10,009
rays and dries in a flash.

296
00:06:10,009 --> 00:06:11,230
Like, come on.

297
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:12,519
We can make that better.

298
00:06:12,579 --> 00:06:13,959
The finest con tees on earth.

299
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:15,569
Cool comfort for trail and town.

300
00:06:15,579 --> 00:06:18,720
Like, it's not the end of the

301
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,160
world,

302
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:20,750
but you just get higher on

303
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,050
subscribes when you're not

304
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:23,720
entertaining people rather than

305
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,120
like,

306
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:27,870
um, rather than like sun's out,

307
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:30,120
sun's out, surf screen.

308
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:30,970
I don't know.

309
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:32,300
So something that can be a

310
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,060
little bit more fun.

311
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,259
Just put, put it in a chat.gbt and

312
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:35,180
say, make this more fun.

313
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:35,959
And that'll give you

314
00:06:36,019 --> 00:06:36,860
everything that you need.

315
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:37,839
You can't be lame, uh, with the

316
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:38,430
customer today.

317
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:39,490
They need to be entertained.

318
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,360
And then lastly, no value for the

319
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,089
customer.

320
00:06:42,089 --> 00:06:43,750
You want to avoid providing no

321
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:44,319
value.

322
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:45,420
You need to provide

323
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,839
value in some way, whatever it is

324
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:48,050
for the customer, such as an

325
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:49,779
exclusive offer, some useful

326
00:06:49,779 --> 00:06:50,259
information,

327
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:51,379
or an engaging story that

328
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:52,319
entertains them.

329
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:53,660
If you don't have a clear value

330
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:54,439
proposition,

331
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,779
value you can bring the customer,

332
00:06:55,779 --> 00:06:56,949
you're going to fail to capture

333
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:58,180
and retain their interest.

334
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:58,420
So

335
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,209
the below copy doesn't explain the

336
00:07:00,209 --> 00:07:01,670
value of having travel sized

337
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,439
products, which makes it very

338
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:03,800
unclear

339
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:04,870
and not effective.

340
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:06,500
It's just saying, elevate your

341
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,389
journey, indulge in, uh, Darfin's

342
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:09,120
travel bag,

343
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:09,899
skincare essentials.

344
00:07:09,899 --> 00:07:10,480
Why?

345
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,199
Like that doesn't, that doesn't

346
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,399
tell me anything rather than

347
00:07:15,459 --> 00:07:18,439
like, um, um, get, uh, airline

348
00:07:18,459 --> 00:07:19,589
approved.

349
00:07:19,589 --> 00:07:22,589
Never worry about never get your,

350
00:07:22,589 --> 00:07:24,759
uh, never get your

351
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:26,800
skincare lotion confiscated at the

352
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,949
airline ever again, or what, what,

353
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:30,540
something along those lines

354
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,600
where it's talking about the

355
00:07:31,709 --> 00:07:32,980
benefit, uh, take these on the go,

356
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:34,259
never have to worry about picking

357
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:34,540
up

358
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,009
whatever your skincare stuff at

359
00:07:36,019 --> 00:07:37,439
the store on, on your vacation

360
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:37,779
spot.

361
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:39,040
That could be worded a lot

362
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,360
better, but you get the point.

363
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,350
Elevate your journey.

364
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:42,819
That isn't, that isn't telling me

365
00:07:42,819 --> 00:07:43,120
anything.

366
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:44,370
indulge in our travel bag

367
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:44,970
essentials.

368
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:46,470
That isn't telling me anything.

369
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:47,040
I need to know

370
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,110
what is the benefit for me, such

371
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:51,089
as never, such as being able to

372
00:07:51,089 --> 00:07:54,699
take this on the go, um, and not

373
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:56,680
get it confiscated.

374
00:07:56,689 --> 00:07:59,490
So that's like the, that's like

375
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:01,709
the value that we need.

376
00:08:01,709 --> 00:08:03,379
Um, so that I just

377
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:05,790
accidentally, um, clicked off, but

378
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:06,279
okay.

379
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,180
So that is what to avoid in your

380
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:08,709
copy.

381
00:08:08,709 --> 00:08:10,149
You want to make sure that

382
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:11,149
you're giving value.

383
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:12,560
You have to avoid being boring.

384
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,079
You have to avoid too many points

385
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:14,240
and

386
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,310
sharing too many points.

387
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:16,500
You have to avoid being too long

388
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,420
with your messaging.

389
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:18,250
You need to avoid

390
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:19,569
unnecessary information.

391
00:08:19,569 --> 00:08:20,750
So that is it for this one.

392
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:22,259
Now let's get into what we want to

393
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:22,439
do.

394
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:22,870
Okay.

395
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,560
So before we really get into what

396
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,360
makes good copy, you're probably

397
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,579
already writing copy

398
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:28,810
and you could be making these

399
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:29,379
mistakes.

400
00:08:29,379 --> 00:08:30,779
So I want to first talk about what

401
00:08:30,779 --> 00:08:32,019
to avoid in your copy

402
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,000
so that we can be clear on what we

403
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,918
need to have.

404
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:37,000
Sometimes it can be better to just

405
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,399
go over what not to do.

406
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:39,840
And that tells you what to do.

407
00:08:39,879 --> 00:08:41,298
So let's talk about what to avoid

408
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,320
in your copy.

409
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,200
So as we went over

410
00:08:43,259 --> 00:08:45,450
2024, 2025 customer is different

411
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:46,100
than the past.

412
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,639
Their attention spans shorter than

413
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:48,029
ever.

414
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:48,779
We really

415
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,340
need to understand that.

416
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:51,679
If you look at tracking on

417
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,610
websites and on ads and whatnot,

418
00:08:53,649 --> 00:08:54,659
it just keeps on

419
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,350
shrinking.

420
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:56,940
The average watch time just keeps

421
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:57,730
on going down.

422
00:08:57,730 --> 00:08:59,250
Same thing applies to emails.

423
00:08:59,259 --> 00:09:00,149
So we need to

424
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:01,769
understand that our time we're on

425
00:09:01,769 --> 00:09:03,269
the clock with having people's

426
00:09:03,269 --> 00:09:03,970
attention.

427
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:05,299
So we really need to make the

428
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:05,899
most of it.

429
00:09:05,899 --> 00:09:07,220
So we need to make sure that we

430
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,200
are avoiding this.

431
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,320
So first thing to avoid

432
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,090
unnecessary

433
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:10,809
information.

434
00:09:10,809 --> 00:09:12,169
You always hear it copy, keep it

435
00:09:12,169 --> 00:09:13,000
nice and concise.

436
00:09:13,139 --> 00:09:16,120
We really, really, really, really

437
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:16,570
need to

438
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:17,889
live up to that with our emails.

439
00:09:17,889 --> 00:09:18,950
A lot of the copy that I see in

440
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:20,490
emails is literally just fluff.

441
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:20,879
That is

442
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,100
unnecessary.

443
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,070
Unnecessary.

444
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:25,350
For example, when somebody joins a

445
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:27,549
newsletter, they know that when

446
00:09:27,559 --> 00:09:27,950
they join,

447
00:09:28,059 --> 00:09:29,139
they enter their email for like a

448
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:29,620
discount.

449
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:30,679
They know they're going to get

450
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:31,679
like exclusive access,

451
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,919
sneak peeks, insights, community,

452
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:35,409
and they kind of know that those

453
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:36,820
are fluff words and you kind of

454
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:38,460
just like say that.

455
00:09:38,549 --> 00:09:41,059
So there's no need to waste space

456
00:09:41,059 --> 00:09:43,759
talking about that because every

457
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:45,789
extra sentence

458
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:47,559
that you add increases the barrier

459
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:49,049
of entry for a customer to like

460
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,940
read that and they get more scared

461
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,200
with the more words somebody sees,

462
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:53,269
the more scared they get and the

463
00:09:53,269 --> 00:09:54,519
more likely they are to leave.

464
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:56,139
And so we really just want to

465
00:09:56,139 --> 00:09:57,409
focus our time on useful

466
00:09:57,559 --> 00:09:59,389
information that can be used by

467
00:09:59,389 --> 00:10:00,080
the customer,

468
00:10:00,139 --> 00:10:01,570
such as your brand unique selling

469
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,309
propositions, your social proof,

470
00:10:03,379 --> 00:10:04,059
all that.

471
00:10:04,059 --> 00:10:06,139
A lot of the branded

472
00:10:06,259 --> 00:10:07,600
stuff that you might want to

473
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,100
include, a lot of the exclusive

474
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,700
access stuff that you want to

475
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:11,220
include

476
00:10:11,299 --> 00:10:12,840
just isn't necessary and you

477
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,970
shouldn't use it.

478
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:15,429
I always find that it hurts

479
00:10:15,429 --> 00:10:16,840
conversions to include

480
00:10:16,899 --> 00:10:17,340
that stuff.

481
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,379
So every sentence that you're

482
00:10:18,379 --> 00:10:19,620
adding, literally every sentence

483
00:10:19,629 --> 00:10:20,590
that you're adding to your

484
00:10:20,659 --> 00:10:22,679
copy, just ask yourself, does this

485
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:24,289
push the customer closer to a

486
00:10:24,289 --> 00:10:24,759
sale?

487
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:26,580
That's all you need to know.

488
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:28,149
So like look at this example.

489
00:10:28,149 --> 00:10:29,730
This whole section is complete

490
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:30,659
wasted space.

491
00:10:30,659 --> 00:10:31,789
At this brand, we're all

492
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:32,899

493
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:34,059
experience one mod at a time.

494
00:10:34,059 --> 00:10:35,299
As a subscriber, you're now part

495
00:10:35,299 --> 00:10:35,549
of an

496
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:36,529
exclusive community of car

497
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:37,850
enthusiasts who appreciate style,

498
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:39,019
performance, and quality.

499
00:10:39,019 --> 00:10:39,580
Here's what you can

500
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:40,370
look forward to.

501
00:10:40,379 --> 00:10:42,019
Exclusive offers, expert insights,

502
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:43,539
product sneak peeks, yada yada.

503
00:10:43,539 --> 00:10:44,320
To kick things off,

504
00:10:44,379 --> 00:10:45,200
here's a 10% off discount.

505
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:45,919
This is all the person cares

506
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:46,259
about.

507
00:10:46,259 --> 00:10:49,620
All of this stuff is just masking

508
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:49,899
and

509
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,639
hiding the discount code that they

510
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:52,059
want.

511
00:10:52,059 --> 00:10:53,860
The discount code, which was right

512
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:54,360
under.

513
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,519
You could

514
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:56,590
delete all this and just say,

515
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:57,269
welcome to this.

516
00:10:57,269 --> 00:10:58,289
We're excited to have you.

517
00:10:58,289 --> 00:10:59,049
To kick things off,

518
00:10:59,159 --> 00:10:59,980
you're 10% off.

519
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:01,070
That's going to convert a lot

520
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:01,490
better.

521
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:02,179
I guarantee it.

522
00:11:02,179 --> 00:11:03,360
All this stuff is just fluff.

523
00:11:03,419 --> 00:11:04,580
Don't need all of it.

524
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,129
People are just there for the

525
00:11:06,129 --> 00:11:06,850
discount.

526
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:07,679
I'm sorry.

527
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:08,639
People don't care as much

528
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:09,159
about you.

529
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:10,210
They care more about their

530
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:10,679
wallets.

531
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:11,879
And so that's just what they're

532
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:12,279
doing.

533
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:12,879
So that's just

534
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,320
completely unnecessary.

535
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,549
And then another one.

536
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:17,059
So I tie in design and copy very

537
00:11:17,059 --> 00:11:17,669
closely.

538
00:11:17,669 --> 00:11:18,279
I think they

539
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:19,370
should be hand in hand.

540
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:20,860
And we're going to talk about that

541
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:21,179
close.

542
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,720
We're going to talk about that

543
00:11:22,779 --> 00:11:23,570
in the future.

544
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:25,129
But another thing on top of like

545
00:11:25,149 --> 00:11:27,120
unnecessary information, maybe you

546
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:27,679
have good

547
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:29,639
information, but you can't have

548
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:31,179
too much in your emails.

549
00:11:31,179 --> 00:11:32,860
Too much copy just increases

550
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:33,500
churn.

551
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,100
Even

552
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:36,120
if you have the helpful info, just

553
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,779
nobody's going to read it.

554
00:11:37,779 --> 00:11:39,679
The shorter your copy is, the more

555
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:39,940
likely

556
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,370
someone will actually take the

557
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:42,190
time to read it.

558
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:43,169
This is an example.

559
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,240
This copy is actually

560
00:11:44,299 --> 00:11:45,090
good copy.

561
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:46,940
It's talking about like what

562
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:49,330
everybody, what they changed about

563
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,820
like these new bars or

564
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:51,309
whatever.

565
00:11:51,309 --> 00:11:52,470
It's not letting me zoom in, but

566
00:11:52,549 --> 00:11:53,460
it's talking about it.

567
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:54,860
You can, this doc will be attached

568
00:11:54,919 --> 00:11:56,299
for you and so you can read it.

569
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:57,759
It's a great copy, but nobody's

570
00:11:57,899 --> 00:11:58,519
reading it.

571
00:11:58,519 --> 00:11:59,799
If they just did like this

572
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:00,870
line and this line, then people

573
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:01,440
would read it.

574
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,480
But when somebody sees all this

575
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,139
copy, they're just

576
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,779
going to skip over it, go down

577
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:05,279
here.

578
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,309
These little icons did 10x more

579
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:09,710
the effectiveness and readability

580
00:12:09,779 --> 00:12:10,200
for someone.

581
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,009
It's just these icons.

582
00:12:11,019 --> 00:12:12,899
People prefer that sort of stuff.

583
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:14,019
And that's what we're going

584
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,309
to talk about and what we need to

585
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,370
be doing with our copy.

586
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:17,669
We can't just list blocks and we

587
00:12:17,669 --> 00:12:18,279
can't have

588
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,070
information too long.

589
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:20,190
People aren't going to read that.

590
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:21,179
They're going to see that and get

591
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:21,659
scared.

592
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,169
Another thing is too many points.

593
00:12:24,169 --> 00:12:26,409
So the customer is very, very,

594
00:12:26,409 --> 00:12:28,519
very, very, very easy to get

595
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:29,330
overwhelmed.

596
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:30,460
So if you try to give your

597
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:32,299
customer five different takeaways,

598
00:12:32,299 --> 00:12:33,429
like we are the best,

599
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,879
we have this, we also do this, and

600
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:36,259
you can also get this, and you can

601
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:37,059
also get this,

602
00:12:37,179 --> 00:12:38,460
they're not going to remember any

603
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:38,889
of them.

604
00:12:38,889 --> 00:12:40,279
Each takeaway would get 20% of

605
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:41,259
their attention.

606
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,730
If you split 100% divided by five,

607
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:44,429
20%.

608
00:12:44,429 --> 00:12:46,250
Whereas if you try to just point

609
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:47,700
on one thing, such as

610
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:49,279
our product does this specific

611
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,950
benefit, in one takeaway, much

612
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,679
more likely that they're going

613
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:53,690
to be able to remember it because

614
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,120
that's 100% of their attention.

615
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,769
This below example is great

616
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,169
in terms of like talking about

617
00:12:59,169 --> 00:13:00,679
benefits for the customer, but

618
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,279
there are just too many benefits

619
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:03,529
to the point that the customer

620
00:13:03,529 --> 00:13:04,879
isn't really going to take any of

621
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:05,460
them away.

622
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:06,490
It seems kind of

623
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:08,039
productive to leave out benefits,

624
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:09,210
but we found it immensely to

625
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:10,299
increase conversions.

626
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:11,480
Like right here,

627
00:13:11,539 --> 00:13:12,509
they're talking, so they're

628
00:13:12,649 --> 00:13:13,570
talking about the meter block

629
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:14,799
right here, and they're saying

630
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:15,120
perfect

631
00:13:15,179 --> 00:13:16,210
results, no strings attached,

632
00:13:16,289 --> 00:13:17,179
durable construction.

633
00:13:17,179 --> 00:13:18,190
It has a cook estimator, cook

634
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:19,159
graphs, cooking alerts,

635
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,929
multi-view cook, all this stuff.

636
00:13:20,929 --> 00:13:22,350
We kind of just want to focus on

637
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:24,350
one, and then meter two plus

638
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:24,759
meter,

639
00:13:24,919 --> 00:13:25,850
and then meter block.

640
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:27,149
Like this is all way too much.

641
00:13:27,149 --> 00:13:28,500
All this information is on the

642
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,419
landing page.

643
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,080
We want to get people to click, so

644
00:13:31,149 --> 00:13:32,600
we want to tease some stuff.

645
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,100
Give them one of the benefits,

646
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:34,620
such as

647
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:37,059
you have, you get perfect results

648
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,379
because you remove guest work,

649
00:13:39,379 --> 00:13:41,620
because you're tracking like on

650
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:41,690
your

651
00:13:41,799 --> 00:13:42,840
phone, whatever it may be.

652
00:13:42,909 --> 00:13:44,090
Then you could have one that's all

653
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:45,210
about no strings attached.

654
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:45,840
There are no

655
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:46,259
strings.

656
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:47,279
It's all mobile and wireless so

657
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:48,450
that you can take it anywhere.

658
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:49,879
This could be split into like six

659
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:51,250
different emails, and it would

660
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:52,289
just be way better for the

661
00:13:52,309 --> 00:13:53,879
customer to take everything in.

662
00:13:53,879 --> 00:13:55,080
So that's

663
00:13:55,139 --> 00:13:57,139
kind of the philosophy there.

664
00:13:57,139 --> 00:13:58,659
And then also boring.

665
00:13:58,659 --> 00:14:00,860
Avoid being boring in your copy.

666
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:01,879
No one wants to

667
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,110
buy from a lame brand.

668
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:04,779
They want to buy from brands they

669
00:14:04,779 --> 00:14:05,200
like.

670
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:06,470
So that seems obvious.

671
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:07,340
If your copy is

672
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:08,899
lame and you're not giving them

673
00:14:08,899 --> 00:14:10,519
dopamine, they're not going to

674
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:11,149
come back.

675
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,429
And so include powerful

676
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,470
words, include puns and cute

677
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:17,070
humor, and then information also.

678
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:18,789
If you can give valuable

679
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:19,320
information,

680
00:14:19,379 --> 00:14:21,090
then people will enjoy that.

681
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:22,429
People like to learn.

682
00:14:22,429 --> 00:14:24,129
People like to see that sort of

683
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:24,679
stuff.

684
00:14:24,679 --> 00:14:25,080
And so

685
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:26,169
this is an example of just lame

686
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:26,470
copy.

687
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:27,690
Maximum coverage and comfort in a

688
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:28,759
lightweight performance

689
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,779
fabric that blocks UV rays and

690
00:14:30,779 --> 00:14:32,080
dries in a flash.

691
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,279
Like, come on.

692
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,159
We can make that better.

693
00:14:35,159 --> 00:14:35,830
The finest

694
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,340
quantities on earth.

695
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:39,429
Cool comfort for trail and town.

696
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:41,190
Like, it's not the end of the

697
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:43,769
world, but you just get

698
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,019
higher on subscribes when you're

699
00:14:45,019 --> 00:14:46,220
not entertaining people rather

700
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:46,659
than like,

701
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:51,169
rather than like sun's out, sun's

702
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,759
out, surf screen.

703
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:53,720
I don't know.

704
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,519
So something that can be a little

705
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:54,519
bit

706
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:55,059
more fun.

707
00:14:55,059 --> 00:14:56,509
Just put it in a chat GPT and say,

708
00:14:56,509 --> 00:14:57,419
make this more fun.

709
00:14:57,559 --> 00:14:58,840
And that'll give you everything

710
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:58,990
that

711
00:14:59,059 --> 00:14:59,409
you need.

712
00:14:59,409 --> 00:15:00,259
You can't be lame with the

713
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:00,940
customer today.

714
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:02,120
They need to be entertained.

715
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,720
And then lastly,

716
00:15:03,779 --> 00:15:05,159
no value for the customer.

717
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:06,620
You want to avoid providing no

718
00:15:06,759 --> 00:15:07,139
value.

719
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:09,080
You need to provide value in some

720
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:09,279
way,

721
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:10,700
whatever it is for the customer,

722
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,100
such as an exclusive offer, some

723
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,620
useful information or an engaging

724
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:14,039
story

725
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,100
that entertains them.

726
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,350
If you don't have a clear value

727
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:18,500
proposition, value you can bring

728
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:18,950
the customer,

729
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:20,169
you're going to fail to capture

730
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:21,340
and retain their interest.

731
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:22,639
So the below copy doesn't explain

732
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:22,759
the

733
00:15:22,919 --> 00:15:24,250
value of having travel sized

734
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:25,750
products, which makes it very

735
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,279
unclear and not effective.

736
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:27,850
It's just saying

737
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:29,299
elevate your journey.

738
00:15:29,379 --> 00:15:31,169
Indulge in Darfin's travel bag,

739
00:15:31,169 --> 00:15:32,490
skincare essentials.

740
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:35,440
Why?

741
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,759
Like that doesn't, that doesn't

742
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:38,279
tell me anything rather than like,

743
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:41,700
um, get, uh, airline

744
00:15:41,799 --> 00:15:42,809
approved.

745
00:15:42,909 --> 00:15:45,539
Never worry about never get your,

746
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:48,529
uh, never get your skincare lotion

747
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:49,990
confiscated at the

748
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:50,950
airline ever again.

749
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,240
Or what, what, something along

750
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,450
those lines where it's talking

751
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:54,340
about the benefit,

752
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:55,629
uh, take these on the go.

753
00:15:55,639 --> 00:15:57,240
Never have to worry about picking

754
00:15:57,370 --> 00:15:59,120
up whatever your skincare stuff at

755
00:15:59,120 --> 00:15:59,240
the

756
00:15:59,299 --> 00:16:00,450
store on, on your vacation.

757
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:01,789
That could be worded a lot better,

758
00:16:01,789 --> 00:16:02,820
but you get the point.

759
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:03,820
Elevate your

760
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:04,259
journey.

761
00:16:04,259 --> 00:16:05,480
That isn't, that isn't telling me

762
00:16:05,549 --> 00:16:05,970
anything.

763
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:06,860
Indulge in our travel bag

764
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:07,570
essentials.

765
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:08,080
That isn't

766
00:16:08,139 --> 00:16:09,509
telling me anything.

767
00:16:09,509 --> 00:16:11,440
I need to know what is the benefit

768
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,279
for me, such as never, such as

769
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:13,940
being able

770
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,320
to take this on the go, um, and

771
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,370
not get it confiscated.

772
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:20,850
So that's like the, that's like

773
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:21,620
the value

774
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:23,009
that we need.

775
00:16:23,009 --> 00:16:26,090
Um, so that I just accidentally,

776
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,879
um, clicked off, but okay.

777
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:30,870
So that is what to avoid in

778
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:31,399
your copy.

779
00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:32,669
You want to make sure that you're

780
00:16:32,669 --> 00:16:33,320
giving value.

781
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,840
You have to avoid being boring.

782
00:16:34,899 --> 00:16:36,370
You have to avoid too many points

783
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:37,889
and sharing too many points.

784
00:16:37,899 --> 00:16:39,279
You have to avoid being too

785
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,289
long with your messaging.

786
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:41,340
You need to avoid unnecessary

787
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:42,000
information.

788
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,379
So that is it for this

789
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:43,639
one.

790
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:44,779
Now let's get into what we want to

791
00:16:44,779 --> 00:16:45,019
do.
