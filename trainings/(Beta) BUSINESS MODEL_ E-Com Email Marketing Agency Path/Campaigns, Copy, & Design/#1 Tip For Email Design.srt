1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:01,860
So, let's talk about the number

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:03,640
one tip for effective email

3
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:04,160
design.

4
00:00:04,179 --> 00:00:06,570
This is single-handedly the reason

5
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:07,940
why I'm here today,

6
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:09,669
being able to teach you about

7
00:00:09,669 --> 00:00:10,640
email design.

8
00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:13,160
It is purely from this, and that

9
00:00:13,169 --> 00:00:14,300
is to steal.

10
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,480
So, don't have any shame in

11
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,739
copying layouts from emails and

12
00:00:18,739 --> 00:00:19,579
brands that you like,

13
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,989
emails and brands that you know

14
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,059
are good at emails,

15
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:23,280
because if a big brand is sending

16
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:24,719
a certain type of email,

17
00:00:24,739 --> 00:00:26,460
it's probably because they work.

18
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,320
So, don't reinvent the wheel.

19
00:00:28,339 --> 00:00:29,539
Don't try to be too crazy.

20
00:00:29,719 --> 00:00:30,739
Just stick with what has proven to

21
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:30,920
work.

22
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:32,880
Essentially, like, especially when

23
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:33,700
I was starting,

24
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:35,649
every single email I made was

25
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:38,429
literally carbon copy layout from

26
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,979
another email that I liked.

27
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,200
I would pull an image.

28
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:43,079
I would find an email, put it side

29
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:44,380
by side with my design,

30
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:45,600
and just copy the layout, and then

31
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:47,039
just replace the images and the

32
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:47,359
colors,

33
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,119
and it served me very well.

34
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:50,939
So, taken from the great Steve

35
00:00:50,939 --> 00:00:51,399
Jobs,

36
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:52,609
good artist copy, great artist

37
00:00:52,609 --> 00:00:52,979
steal.

38
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,719
We've always been shameless about

39
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,000
stealing great ideas.

40
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:57,219
And then, of course, Pablo

41
00:00:57,219 --> 00:00:58,899
Picasso, good artist copy,

42
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:00,039
great artist steal.

43
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,320
So, I have no shame in that.

44
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,759
Steal, steal, steal.

45
00:01:02,859 --> 00:01:05,349
So, here are 10 great email design

46
00:01:05,349 --> 00:01:06,930
brands that are conversion focused

47
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:07,959
that you can steal from.

48
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:10,579
Casely, phone cases, Monk Pack,

49
00:01:10,579 --> 00:01:11,560
they sell snacks.

50
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:12,659
Kizik sells food.

51
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,719
Duck Camp is clothing.

52
00:01:14,739 --> 00:01:16,599
Magic Mind, they sell little

53
00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:19,879
drinks, like shots of energy.

54
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,180
Magic Spoon, cereal, Olipop, soda,

55
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:23,569
Dr.

00:01:23,569 --> 00:01:26,079
Squatch, men's, like, soap and all

57
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:27,099

00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,290
Seed, they sell microbiotics.

59
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:31,819
And then Breeze, they sell, like,

60
00:01:31,819 --> 00:01:33,870
sodas that are THC-based, and

61
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:34,840
their emails are super good.

62
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,129
We showed, essentially, all of

63
00:01:36,219 --> 00:01:37,840
these, almost all of these brands

64
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,290
were in this slideshow at some

65
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:39,780
point.

66
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,099
So, make sure that you subscribe

67
00:01:41,459 --> 00:01:43,269
to the email list, and you can use

68
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,019
these websites such as Milled.

69
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,239
So, Milled is just this massive

70
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:48,079
database of, like, 90% of

71
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:49,849
e-commerce brands in literally all

72
00:01:49,849 --> 00:01:51,219
of their past emails.

73
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:52,439
Like, all of them.

74
00:01:52,659 --> 00:01:53,340
It's pretty ridiculous.

75
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,390
If they go back to, like, 2018,

76
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:56,739
you can find brands' emails and

77
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,340
look at them and spy at them, and

78
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:59,849

00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:01,409

they've done in 2024, whatever you

88
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:14,020

89
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:15,300
So, definitely use Milled.

90
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:17,319
And then Really Good at Emails is

91
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:19,400
another one where, exactly as it

92
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,419
sounds, it's just a database of

93
00:02:21,419 --> 00:02:22,840
really good emails.

94
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:24,919
And so, they're just hand-picked

95
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:26,629
designs of all industries and

96
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:28,870
categories, so it's super easy to,

97
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:30,830
like, look at what type of, I can

98
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:31,939
just show you.

99
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,169
You can see what types of emails

100
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,000
you want, so you can click on,

101
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:36,819
like, Behavioral, and then go to,

102
00:02:36,819 --> 00:02:38,599
like, Abandoned Cart, and then

103
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:39,919
you're just going to be shown

104
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:41,719
Abandoned Cart emails, which is

105
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:42,360
awesome.

106
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,620
You could look up, like, Industry,

107
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:46,300
if you want to do, let's talk

108
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,400
about Beverage, then there's a ton

109
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,819
of beverage emails.

110
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,680
So, super, super helpful there.

111
00:02:53,699 --> 00:02:55,120
Really Good Emails is going to be

112
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:56,740
better for finding, like, specific

113
00:02:56,819 --> 00:02:58,419
emails, like Abandoned Cart.

114
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:00,120
And Milled isn't going to be as

115
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,949
good at finding those abandoned

116
00:03:01,949 --> 00:03:03,639
carts and industry-specific

117
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:04,379
things.

118
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,189
So, if you're looking for

119
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:06,379
something specific, I'd recommend

120
00:03:06,379 --> 00:03:07,080
Really Good Emails.

121
00:03:07,259 --> 00:03:08,569
If you're looking for a brand, I'd

122
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:09,479
recommend Milled.
