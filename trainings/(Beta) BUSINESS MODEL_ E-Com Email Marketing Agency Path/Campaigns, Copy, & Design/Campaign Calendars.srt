1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,520
Okay, now we're talking about

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:04,190
creating your campaign calendars.

3
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:05,599
This is going to be more important

4
00:00:05,599 --> 00:00:07,000
than actually creating the

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:07,780
campaigns.

6
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:10,119
It's always the strategy and the

7
00:00:10,119 --> 00:00:12,240
ideas behind your emails that

8
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,759
generate the most revenue.

9
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:15,839
It's always the strategy.

10
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,120
That's what carries the load.

11
00:00:17,179 --> 00:00:18,859
So this is super important, but

12
00:00:18,859 --> 00:00:20,539
it's also super duper easy once

13
00:00:20,539 --> 00:00:21,640
you get good at it and

14
00:00:21,699 --> 00:00:23,059
once you just have a ton of topics

15
00:00:23,059 --> 00:00:24,129
that you know are going to

16
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:24,719
convert.

17
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:26,269
It's just about filling in the

18
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:26,879
blanks.

19
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:27,879
So let's talk about it.

20
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:29,350
This is the exact process that you

21
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:30,870
want to use when creating campaign

22
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:31,579
calendars.

23
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:32,780
So you have a ton of content to

24
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:33,439
choose from.

25
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,820
You have your chat GBT prompts.

26
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,240
You have a ton of bullets in the

27
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,729
chamber that you can fire and be

28
00:00:37,729 --> 00:00:38,579
ready to use.

29
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,119
You have those non-discount

30
00:00:40,119 --> 00:00:41,649
examples that I gave you.

31
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:42,700
All that stuff.

32
00:00:42,759 --> 00:00:43,700
You have the swipe file.

33
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:44,700
You have everything.

34
00:00:44,759 --> 00:00:45,829
So here's the process for actually

35
00:00:45,829 --> 00:00:47,060
creating your monthly calendar.

36
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:48,439
So first you want to determine

37
00:00:48,439 --> 00:00:49,929
your important dates and insert

38
00:00:49,929 --> 00:00:50,880
into a calendar.

39
00:00:50,939 --> 00:00:52,240
So I like to start with a blank

40
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:52,960
calendar.

41
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:54,119
Get my important dates whether

42
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:55,259
it's holidays, whether it's

43
00:00:55,259 --> 00:00:56,500
product launches, whether it's

44
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:58,049
sale deals.

45
00:00:58,119 --> 00:00:59,750
So if it's October, you have to

46
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:01,229
think like, okay, we have

47
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,799
Halloween and say you have a

48
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:03,149
product

49
00:01:03,299 --> 00:01:04,659
release that's coming in October.

50
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:05,659
Awesome.

51
00:01:05,719 --> 00:01:06,609
Put those base dates into the

52
00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:07,140
calendar.

53
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,579
That's first because we need to

54
00:01:08,579 --> 00:01:09,629
work around those.

55
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:11,150
So those are the main launches

56
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:12,590
that you want to do or the main

57
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:14,019
campaigns that you want to

58
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:15,019
put in.

59
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:16,430
add your supplementary emails to

60
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:17,579
those important dates.

61
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,530
So say you have Halloween and

62
00:01:18,569 --> 00:01:19,750
you're running like a flash sale.

63
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:20,760
Okay.

64
00:01:20,819 --> 00:01:21,760
Let's add in the launch.

65
00:01:21,819 --> 00:01:23,129
Let's add in the reminder for the

66
00:01:23,129 --> 00:01:24,239
sale and let's add in like a

67
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:25,349
closer for the sale.

68
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,180
So we have multiple emails.

69
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:28,579
So that's what you want to add.

70
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,579
And then like product launch.

71
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,719
Maybe you want to add a teaser for

72
00:01:30,769 --> 00:01:31,560
the product launch.

73
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,840
Maybe you want to do like a

74
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,620
reminder or a low on stock email.

75
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,650
That's the kind of stuff that you

76
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:36,170
want to add.

77
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:37,909
And then at that point, it's just

78
00:01:37,909 --> 00:01:39,560
fill in gaps to send three to four

79
00:01:39,579 --> 00:01:40,340
per week.

80
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:42,500
Again, you can get away with two

81
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,359
per week.

82
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:44,290
You're going to get more revenue

83
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:45,079
if you do three to four.

84
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:46,129
But if you're busy, you can get

85
00:01:46,129 --> 00:01:46,780
away with two.

86
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:49,340
But then you just fill in the gaps

87
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:50,659
with the topics that we talked

88
00:01:50,659 --> 00:01:51,680
about and we covered.

89
00:01:51,739 --> 00:01:53,719
And you really don't need to have

90
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:55,609
too much like you don't need to

91
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:56,769
spend too much time

92
00:01:56,969 --> 00:01:58,450
thinking about that other than

93
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:00,219
putting your educational content

94
00:02:00,219 --> 00:02:01,500
in and just keeping your

95
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,659
list nurtured and generating sales

96
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:05,659
without even really having to put

97
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:06,810
too much strategy

98
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:07,769
and time into it.

99
00:02:07,859 --> 00:02:09,669
It's just what are the angles, the

100
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:11,409
education points that we can hit

101
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:12,759
and get the customer to

102
00:02:12,819 --> 00:02:12,949
buy.

103
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:15,039
So step one, step two, step three.

104
00:02:15,099 --> 00:02:15,669
Super easy.

105
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:17,900
So here's like an example for

106
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,830
Lululemon, which you'll have

107
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:21,060
walkthroughs.

108
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,599
I'll give a video of me live

109
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:24,490
adding this stuff for Lululemon

110
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:26,080
and then also Gymshark.

111
00:02:26,139 --> 00:02:27,759
Those are going to be attached for

112
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:29,500
you so that you can watch those.

113
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,039
But let me just talk through this

114
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:31,919
really quick.

115
00:02:31,979 --> 00:02:34,240
So Lululemon, this is March.

116
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,400
So let's look at the main events.

117
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:37,360
I don't know why this says brand

118
00:02:37,389 --> 00:02:38,430
Nike, but let's look at these main

119
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:38,889
events.

120
00:02:38,979 --> 00:02:39,819
So St.

121
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:41,110
Patrick's Day sale, they want to

122
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:42,379
do 20% off site-wide.

123
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:43,639
And then there's a new product

124
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:45,120
drop on Thursday the 28th.

125
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:46,340
So that's going to be the first

126
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,240
thing that we put in.

127
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,780
So we have the, this isn't

128
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:49,659
Lululemon.

129
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:50,719
This is Nike.

130
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:53,360
Okay, this is supposed to be Nike.

131
00:02:53,419 --> 00:02:55,759
I'm going to fix that.

132
00:02:55,819 --> 00:02:57,840
But, so we have a new product

133
00:02:57,849 --> 00:02:59,960
release on the 28th.

134
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,300
This is hypothetical, by the way.

135
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,110
New product release, Nike Tech

136
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:03,699
Pants.

137
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:04,639
And then we've added the

138
00:03:04,729 --> 00:03:05,870
supplementary email just right

139
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,379
here.

140
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:08,110
So that's step one and two is you

141
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:09,759
put the main event, Nike Tech

142
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:10,469
Pants.

143
00:03:10,539 --> 00:03:11,219
You put this.

144
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,180
That's when the release is.

145
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,030
And then also St.

146
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:13,879
Patrick's Day.

147
00:03:13,939 --> 00:03:14,939
We're running St.

148
00:03:14,939 --> 00:03:16,629
Patrick's Day from the 15th

149
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:18,020
through the 18th.

150
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:18,360
Cool.

151
00:03:18,419 --> 00:03:20,139
So we have those in the calendar.

152
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:21,060
Now let's add the supplementary

153
00:03:21,069 --> 00:03:21,419
emails.

154
00:03:21,699 --> 00:03:23,669
So this is the new release

155
00:03:23,669 --> 00:03:24,800
reminder.

156
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:25,900
It's testimonials.

157
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,740
So people who have them already.

158
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:29,900
People who, maybe it's celebrities

159
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,110
who endorse them.

160
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,479
That's a supplementary email as

161
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:33,680
like a reminder for that.

162
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:34,939
Then also let's add like a

163
00:03:34,939 --> 00:03:36,169
reminder for the sale.

164
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:36,849
These are the St.

165
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:37,900
Patrick's Day favorites.

166
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:40,020
And then a last chance.

167
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,830
So we have just a general promo,

168
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:43,990
favorites, and then last chance.

169
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:44,939
Okay, perfect.

170
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,530
Then after that, it's like, what

171
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:47,400
can we fill in?

172
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,479
So for something like Nike, you're

173
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:50,240
going to have a little bit more

174
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:50,919
product highlights,

175
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,919
a little bit less value.

176
00:03:51,979 --> 00:03:53,080
They're already just like super

177
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:53,740
established.

178
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,159
But you can see, education-wise,

179
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,180
we have the science behind the

180
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:59,280
tech fleece.

181
00:03:59,409 --> 00:04:01,099
Like how is it made?

182
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:02,599
What are the materials of it?

183
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:04,180
And what's the science behind it?

184
00:04:04,259 --> 00:04:05,280
How does it keep you warm?

185
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:06,280
All that good stuff.

186
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:08,240
You also have tips for warming up

187
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,189
to avoid injury.

188
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,840
There's another value-based thing

189
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,710
that you can do.

190
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,689
And then a blog, running outdoors

191
00:04:13,689 --> 00:04:14,800
versus indoors.

192
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:15,860
What are the things you need to

193
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:16,959
know if you're running outdoors

194
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:17,680
versus indoors?

195
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:18,819
Do you need to prep differently?

196
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:19,660
Do you need to have different

197
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:19,939
gear?

198
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,560
All that sort of stuff.

199
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:22,639
So we're linking to a blog here.

200
00:04:22,699 --> 00:04:24,269
Then we have like a scientific

201
00:04:24,269 --> 00:04:26,019
study outlining something.

202
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,509
So you can just go on, ask

203
00:04:27,509 --> 00:04:29,230
ChatGBT, do you have any, what are

204
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,129
some recent interesting scientific

205
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:33,199
studies on working out that I can

206
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,290
send for Nike?

207
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,310
And then they'll find like a ton

208
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,360
of stuff like the role of

209
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,019
electrolytes and da, da, da, da.

210
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:40,449
And then just outline one of that

211
00:04:40,449 --> 00:04:41,680
to bring value and position

212
00:04:41,689 --> 00:04:43,319
yourself as an industry leader.

213
00:04:43,379 --> 00:04:45,470
And then we have something like

214
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:47,399
the celebrity features.

215
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,600
Nike has a ton of those.

216
00:04:48,689 --> 00:04:51,050
This is kind of like testimonial

217
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:53,209
and getting the celebrity's

218
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:54,160
audience.

219
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,410
It's a good way to get trust and

220
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,860
get association with that.

221
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,279
So we have that.

222
00:05:00,459 --> 00:05:02,379
And then we also have just like

223
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:04,339
general product features in

224
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,180
promoting the product, like March

225
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,759
favorites, promoting what are the

226
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:09,980
best sellers for March.

227
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,519
Then you also have a restock on

228
00:05:11,529 --> 00:05:12,639
like these shoes.

229
00:05:12,699 --> 00:05:14,800
Restocks work really well because

230
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,899
if something is restocked, that

231
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:18,379
means it's sold out.

232
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:19,329
And so it's probably popular.

233
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:20,379
So those always do well.

234
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:21,139
So you have a restock.

235
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,790
The best selling tech fleece.

236
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:25,000
So a specific product.

237
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:26,800
And then favorite pants, which is,

238
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,290
and then we're doing a favorite

239
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:28,860
pants.

240
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,810
And then we're also teasing.

241
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:30,970
It looks like we're teasing these

242
00:05:31,009 --> 00:05:31,620
pants as well.

243
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,600
So doing an email about, hey,

244
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:35,639
these are like our best selling

245
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:36,399
pants.

246
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,389
By the way, we have a new release

247
00:05:38,389 --> 00:05:39,399
coming up Thursday.

248
00:05:39,459 --> 00:05:41,680
And so, and then also just added a

249
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,870
free campaign, a hat, added an

250
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:45,920
extra sale, just like flash

251
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:47,470
sale of a free hat with orders

252
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:48,720
above $150.

253
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:50,399
Something like that is always nice

254
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:51,800
to throw in on the month to keep

255
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:53,100
your email list engaged

256
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,399
and giving them a reason to stay

257
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:55,870
subscribed if they're getting like

258
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:57,000
secret offers like this.

259
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:00,610
So that is Nike, the example for

260
00:06:00,629 --> 00:06:01,600
them.

261
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,300
And then we also have Gymshark.

262
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,889
So let's take a look at like main

263
00:06:04,889 --> 00:06:06,370
events that we're doing.

264
00:06:06,459 --> 00:06:07,550
So we have Juneteenth.

265
00:06:07,629 --> 00:06:09,379
This is for June.

266
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:10,459
So we have Juneteenth.

267
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:12,649
And then it looks like one of the,

268
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,620
we have Father's Day as like a

269
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:15,550
main event.

270
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:18,500
So Juneteenth and Father's Day.

271
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,990
And then it looks like also a

272
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:23,589
release for Swim Trunks.

273
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:25,180
So that's what we're starting off

274
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:25,629
with.

275
00:06:25,699 --> 00:06:26,670
We're starting off with, okay,

276
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:27,600
what are the dates we're doing

277
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,220
Father's Day?

278
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:30,800
What are we releasing at what day?

279
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:32,029
So we're sending the Swim Trunks

280
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:32,639
on this day.

281
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:33,769
And then we also have Juneteenth.

282
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:35,519
And so let's see.

283
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:36,959
Let's create the supplementary

284
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:37,480
strategy.

285
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:38,600
Let's start with Father's Day.

286
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:40,529
So we have Father's Day right

287
00:06:40,529 --> 00:06:41,089
here.

288
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:41,980
Father's Day promo.

289
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,449
We're just, Father's Day is on the

00:06:43,449 --> 00:06:44,079
16th.

291
00:06:44,139 --> 00:06:46,250
So hey, get your father some gear.

292
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:48,660
There's nothing better than, if

293
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:50,350
you want to show your dad you care

294
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:51,819
about him, get him some gym gear,

295
00:06:51,899 --> 00:06:52,399
yada, yada, yada.

296
00:06:52,939 --> 00:06:53,600
Transformation Tuesday.

297
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,790
So this is like an educational,

298
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:57,639
cool community email.

299
00:06:57,699 --> 00:06:59,399
Transformation Tuesday showing

300
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:01,149
like somebody's, they went from

301
00:07:01,149 --> 00:07:02,959
this overweight to like this, now

302
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:04,060
they're jacked.

303
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,319
Show one of that, but it's

304
00:07:05,339 --> 00:07:06,269
father-themed.

305
00:07:06,579 --> 00:07:07,970
So go through and find like some

306
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:09,360
middle-aged men who had like a

307
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,160
great transformation wearing your

308
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,319
gear and feature them.

309
00:07:12,379 --> 00:07:13,920
And then Father's Day last chance

310
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:15,490
is like, hey, Father's Day is on

311
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:16,160
Sunday.

312
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,110
It's your last chance to get

313
00:07:17,189 --> 00:07:18,279
something in time for that.

314
00:07:18,339 --> 00:07:19,709
And then having a note from the

315
00:07:19,709 --> 00:07:21,360
founder, just being like, hey,

316
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:22,920
shout out all the fathers all out

317
00:07:22,939 --> 00:07:23,519
there.

318
00:07:23,579 --> 00:07:24,860
My dad was important to me, yada,

319
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:25,550
yada, yada.

320
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:28,040
You guys are what are shaping the

321
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,889
future.

322
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:29,779
Something like that.

323
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:31,110
That's very, it's good for the

324
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:31,759
community.

325
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,500
It's good for your brand.

326
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,050
Then we have Juneteenth, just like

327
00:07:35,069 --> 00:07:36,379
an email for Juneteenth.

328
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:38,459
Just giving, giving a shout out

329
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:40,639
and helping with community there

330
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:41,399
as well.

331
00:07:41,459 --> 00:07:42,740
And then Swim Trunks.

332
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,459
So we have a drop on the 6th for

333
00:07:44,459 --> 00:07:45,439
Swim Trunks.

334
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,259
And so it looks like we're doing

335
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:49,500
a, we're dropping this tomorrow.

336
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,339
Looks like this, we had a tease.

337
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:52,339
So we wanted to add like a quick

338
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:53,529
tease at the bottom of the email.

339
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:54,620
Just being like, hey, we have Swim

340
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:55,300
Trunks coming out.

341
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:57,740
For the summer, be on the lookout.

342
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,800
And then on the 5th, we're fully

343
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,420
teasing them.

344
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,670
Being like, hey, this is dropping

345
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:01,180
tomorrow.

346
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:01,639
Be ready.

347
00:08:01,699 --> 00:08:03,259
And then actually dropping them on

348
00:08:03,259 --> 00:08:03,810
this day.

349
00:08:03,939 --> 00:08:05,430
And then doing bestsellers.

350
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,019
So from the trunk drop, these are

351
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:08,410
the ones that are selling the

352
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:09,029
hottest.

353
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,000
So summer favorites, we're doing

354
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,120
two variations.

355
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:13,259
And we're splitting the email by

356
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:13,670
gender.

357
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:14,959
So for women, women's summer

358
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:15,639
favorites.

359
00:08:15,699 --> 00:08:17,079
And then men's summer favorites.

360
00:08:17,139 --> 00:08:18,680
And then let's look at Monday

361
00:08:18,689 --> 00:08:20,819
Motivation as a recurring theme.

362
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,420
So every other week, doing Monday

363
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:23,180
Motivation.

364
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,959
Of just like a quote, Gymshark is

365
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:28,240
big on having inspirational stuff

366
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,269
and everything like that.

367
00:08:30,339 --> 00:08:31,759
So doing Monday Motivation as a

368
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,298
recurring theme is a great way to

369
00:08:33,298 --> 00:08:35,158
have your list expect something.

370
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:36,908
And this was like the NBA finals

371
00:08:36,908 --> 00:08:38,639
were going on at this time.

372
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:39,779
So doing it from like an NBA

373
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:40,340
player.

374
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:41,889
And having another one and another

375
00:08:41,908 --> 00:08:42,500
one here.

376
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,450
And another recurring theme of

377
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:44,480
Transformation Tuesday.

378
00:08:44,539 --> 00:08:45,990
Which one is Father's Day themed.

379
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,090
And then the other one is just

380
00:08:47,129 --> 00:08:48,330
like a regular transformation.

381
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:50,889
Which helps with, yeah.

382
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,779
And then we have some others.

383
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,080
So push day inspiration.

384
00:08:55,149 --> 00:08:56,809
Bringing some value in terms of

385
00:08:56,809 --> 00:08:57,860
like workouts.

386
00:08:57,919 --> 00:08:58,990
Like this is what you can do for

387
00:08:59,049 --> 00:08:59,840
your next push day.

388
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,779
And then having something like an

389
00:09:02,789 --> 00:09:04,240
influencer testimonial.

390
00:09:04,299 --> 00:09:06,730
Influencer testimonial for social

391
00:09:06,789 --> 00:09:07,519
proof.

392
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,019
And also just being able to get

393
00:09:09,019 --> 00:09:10,980
recognized with the testimonial.

394
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:12,529
Suns out, guns out.

395
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,490
Promoting tank tops.

396
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:16,080
Which is kind of more of a product

397
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:17,779
highlight email.

398
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,629
So there's less value in this

399
00:09:19,629 --> 00:09:20,269
month.

400
00:09:20,379 --> 00:09:21,570
It was a busy month with like

401
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:22,350
Father's Day.

402
00:09:22,789 --> 00:09:25,210
And like a release.

403
00:09:25,299 --> 00:09:27,210
And so less of value in terms of

404
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:29,259
here's how to get the most out of

405
00:09:29,259 --> 00:09:29,879
this.

406
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,700
But a lot of community building

407
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:32,279
stuff.

408
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:33,399
Like Monday Motivation.

409
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:34,340
Transformation Tuesday.

410
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:35,700
Gym fit of the day.

411
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:37,570
Note from the founder for Father's

412
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:37,980
Day.

413
00:09:38,049 --> 00:09:39,210
Things like that.

414
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,100
So this is also another route that

415
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:41,879
you can go.

416
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,860
But I'm going to drop some videos

417
00:09:43,899 --> 00:09:45,470
for you to watch on me live

418
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:47,379
creating some calendars.

419
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:49,700
Okay.

420
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:51,120
Now we are talking about creating

421
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,399
your campaign calendars.

422
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:53,850
This is going to be more important

423
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:55,059
than actually creating the

424
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:55,759
campaigns.

425
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,929
It's always the strategy and the

426
00:09:58,019 --> 00:10:00,080
ideas behind your emails that

427
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,179
generate the most revenue.

428
00:10:02,299 --> 00:10:03,440
It's always the strategy.

429
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,029
That's what carries the load.

430
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,610
So this is super important.

431
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:08,370
But it's also super duper easy

432
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:09,879
once you get good at it.

433
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:11,080
And once you just have a ton of

434
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,370
topics that you know are going to

435
00:10:12,429 --> 00:10:12,950
convert.

436
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:14,070
It's just about filling in the

437
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:14,500
blanks.

438
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:15,960
So let's talk about it.

439
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:17,360
This is the exact process that you

440
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,799
want to use when creating campaign

441
00:10:18,809 --> 00:10:19,480
calendars.

442
00:10:19,539 --> 00:10:20,820
So you have a ton of content to

443
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:21,600
choose from.

444
00:10:21,659 --> 00:10:23,039
You have your chat GPT prompts.

445
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,299
You have a ton of bullets in the

446
00:10:24,299 --> 00:10:25,600
chamber that you can fire and be

447
00:10:25,659 --> 00:10:26,399
ready to use.

448
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,840
You have those non-discount

449
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,279
examples that I gave you.

450
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:30,429
All that stuff.

451
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,480
You have the swipe file.

452
00:10:31,539 --> 00:10:32,159
You have everything.

453
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,470
So here's the process for actually

454
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:34,899
creating your monthly calendar.

455
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,399
So first you want to determine

456
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:37,980
your important dates and insert

457
00:10:38,029 --> 00:10:39,039
into a calendar.

458
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,200
So I like to start with a blank

459
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:40,730
calendar.

460
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:42,090
Get my important dates whether

461
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:43,379
it's holidays, whether it's

462
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:44,919
product launches, whether it's

463
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:45,440
sale deals.

464
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,120
So if it's October you have to

465
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,080
think like okay we have Halloween

466
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,980
and say you have a product release

467
00:10:51,059 --> 00:10:52,840
that's coming in October.

468
00:10:53,139 --> 00:10:53,360
Awesome.

469
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:54,559
Put those base dates into the

470
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:55,120
calendar.

471
00:10:55,179 --> 00:10:56,490
That's first because we need to

472
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:57,519
work around those.

473
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:59,090
So those are the main launches

474
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,590
that you want to do or the main

475
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:02,600
campaigns that you want to put in.

476
00:11:02,659 --> 00:11:03,649
And then you need to add your

477
00:11:03,649 --> 00:11:04,769
supplementary emails to those

478
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:05,669
important dates.

479
00:11:06,139 --> 00:11:07,350
So say you have Halloween and

480
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:08,870
you're running like a flash sale,

481
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:10,259
okay let's add in the launch,

482
00:11:10,259 --> 00:11:11,440
let's add in the reminder for the

483
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:12,679
sale, and let's add in like a

484
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:13,639
closer for the sale.

485
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:14,799
So we have multiple emails.

486
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:16,799
So that's what you want to add.

487
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:17,840
And then like product launch,

488
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,919
maybe you want to add a teaser for

489
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:19,740
the product launch.

490
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:21,000
Maybe you want to do like a

491
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,779
reminder or a low on stock email.

492
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,919
That's the kind of stuff that you

493
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:24,519
want to add.

494
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:26,210
And then at that point it's just

495
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:27,970
fill in gaps to send three to four

496
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:28,700
per week.

497
00:11:28,769 --> 00:11:30,860
Again, you can get away with two

498
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:31,720
per week.

499
00:11:31,779 --> 00:11:32,759
You're going to get more revenue

500
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:33,700
if you do three to four, but if

501
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:34,769
you're busy you can get away with

502
00:11:34,769 --> 00:11:35,100
two.

503
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,490
But then you just fill in the gaps

504
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:38,860
with the topics that we talked

505
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,039
about and we covered.

506
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,929
And you really don't need to have

507
00:11:41,929 --> 00:11:43,679
too much like you don't need to

508
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:45,710
spend too much time thinking about

509
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:47,389
that other than putting your

510
00:11:47,389 --> 00:11:49,240
educational content in and just

511
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,679
keeping your list nurtured and

512
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:52,570
generating sales without even

513
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:54,320
really having to put too much

514
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:56,139
strategy and time into it.

515
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,950
It's just what are the angles, the

516
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:59,649
education points that we can hit

517
00:11:59,649 --> 00:12:01,230
and get the customer to buy.

518
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,399
So step one, step two, step three.

519
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:04,029
Super easy.

520
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,399
So here's like an example for

521
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,240
Lululemon, which you'll have

522
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,419
walkthroughs.

523
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,960
I'll give a video of me live

524
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,850
adding this stuff for Lululemon

525
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:14,440
and then also Gymshark.

526
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,120
Those are going to be attached for

527
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,820
you so that you can watch those.

528
00:12:17,899 --> 00:12:19,379
But let me just talk through this

529
00:12:19,389 --> 00:12:20,259
really quick.

530
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,580
So Lululemon, this is March.

531
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,750
So let's look at the main events.

532
00:12:24,789 --> 00:12:25,549
I don't know why this says brand

533
00:12:25,549 --> 00:12:25,820
Nike.

534
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:26,840
But let's look at these main

535
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:27,279
events.

536
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:28,179
So St.

537
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:29,480
Patrick's Day sale, they want to

538
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:30,740
do 20% off site-wide.

539
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:31,990
And then there's a new product

540
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:33,460
drop on Thursday the 28th.

541
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:34,620
So that's going to be the first

542
00:12:34,649 --> 00:12:35,580
thing that we put in.

543
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:37,110
So we have the – this isn't

544
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:38,019
Lululemon.

545
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,080
This is Nike.

546
00:12:39,139 --> 00:12:41,700
Okay, this is supposed to be Nike.

547
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,090
I'm going to fix that.

548
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:46,129
But so we have a new product

549
00:12:46,129 --> 00:12:48,320
release on the 28th.

550
00:12:48,379 --> 00:12:49,659
This is hypothetical, by the way.

551
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,470
New product release, Nike Tech

552
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:52,039
Pants.

553
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:52,990
And then we've added the

554
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:54,360
supplementary email just right

555
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:54,740
here.

556
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:56,470
So that's step one and two is you

557
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:58,120
put the main event, Nike Tech

558
00:12:58,149 --> 00:12:58,820
Pants.

559
00:12:58,879 --> 00:12:59,580
You put this.

560
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:00,539
That's when the release is.

561
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:01,450
And then also St.

562
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:02,210
Patrick's Day.

563
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:03,279
We're running St.

564
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:04,970
Patrick's Day from the 15th

565
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:06,379
through the 18th.

566
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:06,700
Cool.

567
00:13:06,759 --> 00:13:08,480
So we have those in the calendar.

568
00:13:08,539 --> 00:13:09,399
Now let's add the supplementary

569
00:13:09,409 --> 00:13:09,759
emails.

570
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:11,919
So this is the new release

571
00:13:12,019 --> 00:13:13,129
reminder.

572
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,259
It's testimonials.

573
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,100
So people who have them already.

574
00:13:16,169 --> 00:13:17,509
People who – maybe it's

575
00:13:17,509 --> 00:13:19,460
celebrities who endorse them.

576
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:20,789
That's a supplementary email as,

577
00:13:20,789 --> 00:13:22,019
like, a reminder for that.

578
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,379
Then also let's add, like, a

579
00:13:23,379 --> 00:13:24,580
reminder for the sale.

580
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:25,279
These are the St.

581
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:26,379
Patrick's Day favorites.

582
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,360
And then a last chance.

583
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,120
So we have general promo,

584
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,340
favorites, and then last chance.

585
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:33,279
Okay, perfect.

586
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:34,929
Then after that, it's, like, what

587
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:35,759
can we fill in?

588
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,840
So for something like Nike, you're

589
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,649
going to have a little bit more

590
00:13:38,649 --> 00:13:39,259
product highlights,

591
00:13:39,299 --> 00:13:40,259
a little bit less value.

592
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,409
They're already just, like, super

593
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:42,000
established.

594
00:13:42,059 --> 00:13:44,480
But you can see, education-wise,

595
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,549
we have the science behind the

596
00:13:46,549 --> 00:13:47,679
tech fleece.

597
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:49,440
Why – like, how is it made?

598
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,940
What are the materials of it?

599
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,559
And what's the science behind it?

600
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:53,620
How does it keep you warm?

601
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:54,659
All that good stuff.

602
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,440
You also have tips for warming up

603
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,559
to avoid injury.

604
00:13:57,879 --> 00:13:59,320
There's another value-based thing

605
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,009
that you can do.

606
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:02,039
And then a blog, running outdoors

607
00:14:02,039 --> 00:14:03,159
versus indoors.

608
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:04,200
What are the things you need to

609
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:05,309
know if you're running outdoors

610
00:14:05,309 --> 00:14:06,039
versus indoors?

611
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,179
Do you need to prep differently?

612
00:14:07,259 --> 00:14:08,019
Do you need to have different

613
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:08,299
gear?

614
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,889
All that sort of stuff.

615
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,000
So we're linking to a blog here.

616
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:12,220
And then we have, like, a

617
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,620
scientific study outlining

618
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:14,370
something.

619
00:14:14,539 --> 00:14:15,639
So you can just go on, ask

620
00:14:15,669 --> 00:14:17,240
ChatGBT, do you have any – what

621
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,740
are some recent interesting

622
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:20,980
scientific studies on working out

623
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:22,700
that I can send for Nike?

624
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:24,330
And then they'll find, like, a ton

625
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:25,529
of stuff, like the role of

626
00:14:25,529 --> 00:14:27,350
electrolytes and da-da-da-da-da.

627
00:14:27,419 --> 00:14:28,789
And then just outline one of that

628
00:14:28,789 --> 00:14:30,019
to bring value and position

629
00:14:30,029 --> 00:14:31,659
yourself as an industry leader.

630
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,129
And then we have something like

631
00:14:34,129 --> 00:14:35,799
the celebrity features.

632
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:36,950
Nike has a ton of those.

633
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:39,590
This is kind of, like, testimonial

634
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:41,600
and getting the celebrity's

635
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:42,590
audience.

636
00:14:42,659 --> 00:14:44,769
It's a good way to get trust and

637
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:47,220
get association with that.

638
00:14:47,799 --> 00:14:49,720
So we have that, and then we also

639
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:52,019
have just, like, general product

640
00:14:52,019 --> 00:14:54,460
features in promoting the product,

641
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,490
like March favorites, promoting

642
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:57,830
what are the best sellers for

643
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:58,320
March.

644
00:14:58,379 --> 00:14:59,850
Then you also have a restock on,

645
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:00,980
like, these shoes.

646
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:02,860
Restocks work really well because

647
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,679
if something is restocked, that

648
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:06,419
means it's sold out, and so it's

649
00:15:06,419 --> 00:15:07,679
probably popular.

650
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,720
So those always do well.

651
00:15:08,779 --> 00:15:09,500
So you have a restock.

652
00:15:09,559 --> 00:15:11,899
The best-selling tech fleece, so a

653
00:15:11,899 --> 00:15:13,360
specific product.

654
00:15:13,419 --> 00:15:14,960
And then favorite pants, which is,

655
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:16,330
and then we're doing a favorite

656
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:17,529
pants, and then we're also

657
00:15:17,529 --> 00:15:18,200
teasing.

658
00:15:18,259 --> 00:15:19,330
It looks like we're teasing these

659
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:19,960
pants as well.

660
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:21,820
So doing an email about, hey,

661
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:24,039
these are, like, our best-selling

662
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:24,740
pants.

663
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:26,470
By the way, we have a new release

664
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:27,740
coming on Thursday.

665
00:15:27,799 --> 00:15:29,769
And so, and then also just added a

666
00:15:29,769 --> 00:15:31,730
free campaign, a hat, added an

667
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:34,049
extra sale, just, like, flash sale

668
00:15:34,049 --> 00:15:35,870
of a free hat with orders above

669
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:37,080
$150.

670
00:15:37,149 --> 00:15:38,759
Something like that is always nice

671
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:40,159
to throw in on the month to keep

672
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:41,460
your email list engaged

673
00:15:41,539 --> 00:15:42,629
and giving them a reason to stay

674
00:15:42,669 --> 00:15:43,909
subscribed if they're getting,

675
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:45,340
like, secret offers like this.

676
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:48,929
So that is Nike, the example for

677
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:49,919
them.

678
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,639
And then we also have Gymshark.

679
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,100
So let's take a look at, like,

680
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,710
main events that we're doing.

681
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:55,860
So we have Juneteenth.

682
00:15:55,919 --> 00:15:57,700
This is for June, so we have

683
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:58,799
Juneteenth.

684
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:00,919
And then it looks like one of the,

685
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:03,029
we have Father's Day as, like, a

686
00:16:03,029 --> 00:16:04,059
main event.

687
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:07,019
So Juneteenth and Father's Day,

688
00:16:07,019 --> 00:16:09,419
and then it looks like also a

689
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,960
release for Swim Trunks.

690
00:16:12,019 --> 00:16:13,539
So that's what we're starting off

691
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:13,990
with.

692
00:16:14,059 --> 00:16:15,029
We're starting off with, okay,

693
00:16:15,029 --> 00:16:15,960
what are the dates we're doing

694
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:16,559
Father's Day?

695
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:19,139
What are we releasing at what day?

696
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,370
So we're sending the Swim Trunks

697
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:20,980
on this day.

698
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:22,120
And then we also have Juneteenth.

699
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,879
And so let's see.

700
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,240
Let's create the supplementary

701
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:25,820
strategy.

702
00:16:25,879 --> 00:16:26,950
Let's start with Father's Day.

703
00:16:27,559 --> 00:16:28,850
So we have Father's Day right

704
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:30,340
here, Father's Day promo.

705
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:31,809
We're just, Father's Day is on the

706
00:16:31,809 --> 00:16:32,440
16th.

707
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,139
So, hey, get your father some

708
00:16:34,139 --> 00:16:34,610
gear.

709
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:36,620
There's nothing better than, if

710
00:16:36,659 --> 00:16:38,570
you want to show your dad you care

711
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,090
about him, get him some gym gear,

712
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:40,759
yada, yada, yada.

713
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:41,960
Transformation Tuesday.

714
00:16:42,019 --> 00:16:44,299
So this is, like, an educational,

715
00:16:44,299 --> 00:16:45,980
cool community email.

716
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:47,779
Transformation Tuesday showing,

717
00:16:47,779 --> 00:16:49,570
like, somebody's, they went from

718
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:51,740
this, overweight, to, like, this.

719
00:16:51,799 --> 00:16:52,419
Now they're jacked.

720
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,720
Show one of that, but it's

721
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,700
father-themed.

722
00:16:54,759 --> 00:16:56,250
So go through and find, like, some

723
00:16:56,269 --> 00:16:57,769
middle-aged men who had, like, a

724
00:16:57,769 --> 00:16:59,379
great transformation wearing your

725
00:16:59,379 --> 00:17:00,659
gear and feature them.

726
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,210
And then Father's Day last chance

727
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,899
is, like, hey, Father's Day is on

728
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:04,480
Sunday.

729
00:17:04,539 --> 00:17:05,480
It's your last chance to get

730
00:17:05,509 --> 00:17:06,640
something in time for that.

731
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,068
And then having a note from the

732
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:09,720
founder just being, like, hey,

733
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:11,279
shout out all the fathers all out

734
00:17:11,299 --> 00:17:11,730
there.

735
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,200
My dad was important to me, yada,

736
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:13,890
yada, yada.

737
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,359
You guys are what are shaping the

738
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:17,240
future.

739
00:17:17,309 --> 00:17:18,140
Something like that.

740
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,470
That's very, it's good for the

741
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:20,119
community.

742
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,818
It's good for your brand.

743
00:17:22,279 --> 00:17:23,380
Then we have Juneteenth, just,

744
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:24,710
like, an email for Juneteenth.

745
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:26,568
Just giving a shout out and

746
00:17:26,568 --> 00:17:28,920
helping with the community there

747
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,740
as well.

748
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:31,099
And then Swim Trunks.

749
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,819
So we have a drop on the 6th for

750
00:17:32,819 --> 00:17:33,799
Swim Trunks.

751
00:17:33,859 --> 00:17:35,619
And so it looks like we're doing

752
00:17:35,619 --> 00:17:37,839
a, we're dropping this tomorrow.

753
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:38,740
Looks like this.

754
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:39,700
We had a tease.

755
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:40,759
So we wanted to add, like, a quick

756
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:41,869
tease at the bottom of the email.

757
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,480
Just being like, hey, we have Swim

758
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,109
Trunks coming out for the summer.

759
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:46,079
Be on the lookout.

760
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:47,319
And then on the 5th, we're fully

761
00:17:47,319 --> 00:17:48,400
teasing them, being like, hey,

762
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,539
this is dropping tomorrow.

763
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:50,000
Be ready.

764
00:17:50,059 --> 00:17:51,619
And then actually dropping them on

765
00:17:51,619 --> 00:17:52,170
this day.

766
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:53,769
And then doing bestsellers.

767
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:55,359
So from the trunk drop, these are

768
00:17:55,369 --> 00:17:56,750
the ones that are selling the

769
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:57,369
hottest.

770
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:59,519
So summer favorites.

771
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:00,470
We're doing two variations.

772
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:01,599
And we're splitting the email by

773
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,009
gender.

774
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,339
So for women, women's summer

775
00:18:03,349 --> 00:18:04,000
favorites.

776
00:18:04,059 --> 00:18:05,460
And then men's summer favorites.

777
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:07,059
And then let's look at Monday

778
00:18:07,069 --> 00:18:09,170
motivation as a recurring theme.

779
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,130
So every other week doing Monday

780
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:13,319
motivation of just like a quote.

781
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,039
Gymshark is big on having

782
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:17,640
inspirational stuff and everything

783
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,619
like that.

784
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,240
So doing Monday motivation as a

785
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,910
recurring theme is a great way to

786
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:23,519
have your list expect something.

787
00:18:23,579 --> 00:18:25,269
And this was like the NBA finals

788
00:18:25,269 --> 00:18:27,000
were going on at this time.

789
00:18:27,059 --> 00:18:28,140
So doing it from like an NBA

790
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:28,700
player.

791
00:18:28,759 --> 00:18:29,920
Then having another one and

792
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,859
another one here.

793
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:31,960
And another recurring theme of

794
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:33,220
Transformation Tuesday, which one

795
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:34,359
is Father's Day themed.

796
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:35,900
And then the other one is just

797
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,710
like a regular transformation,

798
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:39,259
which helps with, yeah.

799
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:42,109
And then we have some others.

800
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:44,069
So push day inspiration, bringing

801
00:18:44,069 --> 00:18:45,500
some value in terms of like

802
00:18:45,529 --> 00:18:46,279
workouts.

803
00:18:46,339 --> 00:18:47,390
Like this is what you can do for

804
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:48,259
your next push day.

805
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:50,549
And then having something like an

806
00:18:50,549 --> 00:18:52,579
influencer testimonial.

807
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,069
Influencer testimonial for social

808
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:55,859
proof.

809
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,369
And also just being able to get

810
00:18:57,369 --> 00:18:59,339
recognized with the testimonial.

811
00:19:00,019 --> 00:19:01,930
Sun's out, guns out, promoting

812
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:03,829
tank tops, which is kind of more

813
00:19:03,829 --> 00:19:05,799
of a more of a product highlight

814
00:19:05,799 --> 00:19:06,119
email.

815
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,970
So there's less value in this

816
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:08,609
month.

817
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,819
It was a busy month with like

818
00:19:10,819 --> 00:19:13,599
Father's Day and like a release.

819
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:15,569
And so less of value in terms of

820
00:19:15,569 --> 00:19:17,619
here's how to get the most out of

821
00:19:17,619 --> 00:19:18,240
this.

822
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,829
But a lot of community building

823
00:19:19,829 --> 00:19:21,329
stuff like Monday motivation,

824
00:19:21,329 --> 00:19:23,369
Transformation Tuesday, gym fit of

825
00:19:23,369 --> 00:19:25,500
the day, note from the founder for

826
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,579
Father's Day, things like that.

827
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,460
So this is also another route that

828
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,240
you can go.

829
00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:32,220
But I'm going to drop some videos

830
00:19:32,259 --> 00:19:33,829
for you to watch on me live

831
00:19:33,829 --> 00:19:35,740
creating some calendars.
