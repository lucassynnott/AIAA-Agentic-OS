1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:01,860
Okay, so now let's talk about

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:04,040
subject lines and preview text.

3
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:06,280
I get asked about these a lot,

4
00:00:06,629 --> 00:00:08,019
subject lines and preview text,

5
00:00:08,019 --> 00:00:09,500
and so let us talk about them and

6
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,039
break them down and give you some

7
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:12,650
simple frameworks to use for this

8
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:14,419
to make them as easy as possible.

9
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,570
Now, I am under the belief that

10
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:18,969
your subject line and your preview

11
00:00:18,969 --> 00:00:21,379
text should not matter for getting

12
00:00:21,379 --> 00:00:22,140
opens.

13
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:23,339
A lot of times people are using

14
00:00:23,339 --> 00:00:24,769
the subject line and preview text,

15
00:00:24,769 --> 00:00:26,129
like if you have bad opens, you're

16
00:00:26,129 --> 00:00:27,469
like, oh, it's a subject line and

17
00:00:27,469 --> 00:00:28,339
preview text.

18
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:30,440
Disagree completely.

19
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:32,229
Your content in your emails should

20
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:33,810
be so good and your cadence just

21
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,280
like so consistent that you're

22
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:36,850
sending emails on like this

23
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:38,689
consistent cadence and the content

24
00:00:38,689 --> 00:00:40,159
is so good every time that the

25
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:41,939
customers are conditioned to open

26
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:43,700
every email no matter what.

27
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:45,259
We want them to open our emails

28
00:00:45,259 --> 00:00:46,890
based off our sender name rather

29
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,520
than off of the subject line and

30
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,539
preview text.

31
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,219
For example, maybe there's like

32
00:00:51,219 --> 00:00:52,750
probably not a lot of people out

33
00:00:52,789 --> 00:00:54,340
there, but there might be some

34
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:55,840
people out there who watch all of

35
00:00:55,929 --> 00:00:57,619
my YouTube videos not because the

36
00:00:57,689 --> 00:00:59,299
title is extremely relevant to

37
00:00:59,320 --> 00:00:59,520
them,

38
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:00,609
or the description is super

39
00:01:00,609 --> 00:01:01,179
important.

40
00:01:01,179 --> 00:01:03,000
They just see it's a video from

41
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:04,890
me, they like my content, and so

42
00:01:04,909 --> 00:01:06,840
they're going to watch every video

43
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,019
or at least click on it and check

44
00:01:08,019 --> 00:01:08,400
it out.

45
00:01:08,459 --> 00:01:09,569
It's going to be the same thing

46
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:10,510
for your email list.

47
00:01:10,519 --> 00:01:11,549
This happens for a lot of my

48
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:12,400
favorite brands.

49
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,239
I'm opening because of it's this

50
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:14,859
brand.

51
00:01:14,859 --> 00:01:15,989
I don't care what the subject line

52
00:01:15,989 --> 00:01:16,900
and preview text says.

53
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:18,510
I'm just going to open their email

54
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:19,629
and see what's inside because

55
00:01:19,629 --> 00:01:20,900
their brand I like, their content

56
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:21,980
is always good, I'm getting

57
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:23,530
information from their emails, and

58
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:25,319
they're constantly sending to me

59
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:26,819
so it's not a surprise that I'm

60
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:28,390
seeing them in my inbox.

61
00:01:28,609 --> 00:01:29,849
I'm just conditioned no matter

62
00:01:29,859 --> 00:01:30,239
what.

63
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:31,340
When I see this brand, I open

64
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:32,060
every email.

65
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,640
So I really look less at the

66
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,670
subject line and preview text for

67
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,620
opens, and I think that subject

68
00:01:37,969 --> 00:01:39,560
lines and preview text are quite

69
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:40,560
overrated.

70
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:41,870
If you have a strong brand,

71
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:43,340
subject lines and preview text

72
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:44,659
won't matter too much.

73
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:46,219
But the real purpose of subject

74
00:01:46,219 --> 00:01:47,870
lines and preview text is going to

75
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:48,719
be for sales.

76
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,150
That's all we care about in

77
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:50,980
marketing.

78
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:51,980
We want more sales.

79
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,390
So different subject lines and

80
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:54,849
preview text are going to change

81
00:01:54,849 --> 00:01:56,519
the frame of your email and prime

82
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:58,040
the customer for sales in

83
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,239
different ways.

84
00:01:59,299 --> 00:02:01,030
So if somebody sees an email, like

85
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:02,260
for example, you have a

86
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,189
bestseller's email, if you just

87
00:02:04,189 --> 00:02:05,900
say, these are the bestsellers

88
00:02:06,129 --> 00:02:07,650
versus bestsellers low on stock,

89
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:09,430
those are going to have different

90
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:11,180
views in the customer's eyes.

91
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,330
They're going to open the email

92
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:12,990
differently.

93
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:14,599
They're going to be thinking about

94
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:16,030
the products through the email

95
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:17,409
differently based off what we

96
00:02:17,409 --> 00:02:17,830
said.

97
00:02:17,939 --> 00:02:19,439
So we've had some subject lines

98
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:20,759
and preview text generate

99
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:22,439
literally 3x more revenue than

100
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:23,000
others.

101
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,759
Same copy and design.

102
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,379
Any A-B tests.

103
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:27,669
Test your subject lines based on

104
00:02:27,669 --> 00:02:29,060
revenue and less about opens.

105
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,009
Let's look at this example.

106
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:32,060
Same exact email right here.

107
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:33,990
These are the same email but

108
00:02:34,009 --> 00:02:36,050
different subject lines and

109
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:37,289
preview text.

110
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,360
This had less opens.

111
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:40,939
Less open rate.

112
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:43,139
Much higher click rate.

113
00:02:43,219 --> 00:02:47,020
And a 3x in revenue.

114
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,400
Place to order rate.

115
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:52,259
Just from subject line.

116
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,650
We changed the frame at which

117
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:57,259
somebody opened that email.

118
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:58,800
I believe it was an abandoned cart

119
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,280
email.

120
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,020
And it said like, this one said

121
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,659
like, finish your order.

122
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:04,919
And then this one said like, your

123
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:06,490
order is ready to ship.

124
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:07,460
Or something like that.

125
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,460
To really prime it in the

126
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:09,810
customer's head that like, you

127
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:10,520
have an order.

128
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:11,780
It's ready to go.

129
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,979
We're ready for you.

130
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:13,659
Just make the move.

131
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:14,729
Rather than like, you left

132
00:03:14,729 --> 00:03:16,060
something behind or something like

133
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:16,419
that.

134
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:18,300
Just completely changes the frame

135
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:20,009
of the email and gets different

136
00:03:20,009 --> 00:03:20,740
results.

137
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,719
So really test off your revenue.

138
00:03:22,789 --> 00:03:24,409
Think of your subject line as your

139
00:03:24,409 --> 00:03:25,120
headline.

140
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,699
Preview text is your sub headline.

141
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:27,840
You don't want to give away all

142
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,129
your information in your subject

143
00:03:29,129 --> 00:03:30,199
line and preview text.

144
00:03:30,259 --> 00:03:31,599
We want to give people a hint.

145
00:03:31,659 --> 00:03:33,979
But in order to really know what

146
00:03:33,979 --> 00:03:36,020
we're saying, they need to open

147
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,439
the email to find out more.

148
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,460
So that's really the main thing to

149
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:41,159
make sure that we're getting like,

150
00:03:41,259 --> 00:03:42,860
enough opens is give them a hint.

151
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:44,280
Don't tell them the full story.

152
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,800
It's just the headline and the sub

153
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,569
headline that's teasing the open.

154
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:49,120
So this is a simple subject line

155
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,900
framework that we use most often.

156
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,719
It looks clean.

157
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:53,750
It builds intrigue.

158
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:54,740
And will prime your customer for a

159
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:55,180
purchase.

160
00:03:55,259 --> 00:03:58,300
This is for subject lines.

161
00:03:58,379 --> 00:03:59,129
And then we'll go into preview

162
00:03:59,259 --> 00:03:59,620
text next.

163
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,310
So typically what we're doing is

164
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:02,400
two to five words.

165
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,319
And again, don't overthink subject

166
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:05,719
lines of preview text.

167
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,669
There's really no right answer for

168
00:04:07,669 --> 00:04:08,500
all of them.

169
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:10,759
But just do spend a little bit of

170
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:11,919
time on them.

171
00:04:11,979 --> 00:04:13,800
But this is like typically what we

172
00:04:13,819 --> 00:04:15,199
use most of the time.

173
00:04:15,259 --> 00:04:16,290
But it's important to always be

174
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:16,899
mixing it up.

175
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,939
So two to five words in length.

176
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:20,139
Nothing too long.

177
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:21,160
We don't want to write a whole

178
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,370
sentence because that's going to

179
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:23,000
get cut off.

180
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:23,949
And it's going to scare people

181
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:24,230
off.

182
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,800
Two to five words in length.

183
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:26,720
It's short and sweet.

184
00:04:27,259 --> 00:04:28,790
And it builds intrigue just having

185
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:29,850
a shorter headline.

186
00:04:29,939 --> 00:04:30,980
Title case.

187
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:31,810
Like this sentence.

188
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:32,810
I always think it looks more

189
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:33,319
official.

190
00:04:33,379 --> 00:04:35,300
Adds more legitimacy to the email

191
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,290
rather than having it be sentence

192
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:37,860
case.

193
00:04:37,939 --> 00:04:39,899
Builds curiosity.

194
00:04:40,019 --> 00:04:43,079
So we're selling people to click.

195
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:44,939
It ends with one to two emojis.

196
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,839
This is optional.

197
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,620
Good to do every now and again.

198
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,980
So let's look at these examples.

199
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:51,310
Title case.

200
00:04:51,379 --> 00:04:52,459
Two to five words in length.

201
00:04:52,529 --> 00:04:53,550
Builds curiosity.

202
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:54,509
Ends with an emoji.

203
00:04:54,579 --> 00:04:55,660
A taste of sunshine.

204
00:04:56,579 --> 00:04:57,439
Ooh, what does that mean?

205
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,319
Builds your curiosity.

206
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:00,439
Myth busted.

207
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,579
What myth is busted?

208
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:01,910
What?

209
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,579
Builds curiosity.

210
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:04,410
They're finally here.

211
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,339
What's finally here?

212
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:06,610
It's literally this easy.

213
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,540
What's this easy?

214
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:08,850
It builds curiosity.

215
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,810
It looks clean.

216
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:10,500
It looks official.

217
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,120
And then the emojis are just like

218
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,040
an added touch.

219
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,329
Which you don't want to do every

220
00:05:14,339 --> 00:05:15,000
single time.

221
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:16,360
But you want to do a good amount

222
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,040
of the time.

223
00:05:17,139 --> 00:05:17,879
Let's include emojis.

224
00:05:17,939 --> 00:05:18,399
They work.

225
00:05:18,459 --> 00:05:20,529
And then a preview text framework.

226
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,490
Do not overthink it.

227
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,529
Preview text.

228
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,949
Just build off the subject line

229
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:26,319
and create more curiosity.

230
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,379
That's all it is.

231
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:28,399
Do not overthink it.

232
00:05:28,459 --> 00:05:29,920
So here's a framework that feeds

233
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,290
off of the subject line that I

234
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:32,550
like to use for the preview text.

235
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,170
So we want the preview text to be

236
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:35,600
one full sentence long.

237
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,600
Regular capitalization.

238
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:38,750
So we're not capitalizing each

239
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:39,139
thing.

240
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,360
Just regular sentence case.

241
00:05:40,819 --> 00:05:41,769
It's going to add support to the

242
00:05:41,769 --> 00:05:42,360
subject line.

243
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:44,110
And every now and again, like a

244
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:45,319
good tip that I like to use is end

245
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:46,360
with dot, dot, dot.

246
00:05:46,459 --> 00:05:48,170
Really builds your intrigue and

247
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:49,949
kind of like leaves the customer

248
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:51,139
like unfinished.

249
00:05:51,209 --> 00:05:53,180
And so some examples.

250
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,490
This wasn't supposed to be made,

251
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:55,680
but now it's a bestseller.

252
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:56,480
Dot, dot, dot.

253
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:57,829
That dot, dot, dot just really

254
00:05:57,829 --> 00:05:58,959
builds your intrigue.

255
00:05:59,019 --> 00:05:59,639
And you're like, uh.

256
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:00,870
And so builds off of like the

257
00:06:00,899 --> 00:06:01,680
subject line.

258
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,259
For example, that would be like a

259
00:06:03,259 --> 00:06:04,339
taste of sunshine.

260
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:06,050
With the subject, with the preview

261
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:07,310
text, this wasn't supposed to be

262
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:08,430
made, but now it's a bestseller.

263
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,079
And it's a taste of sunshine.

264
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:10,620
Holy cow.

265
00:06:10,699 --> 00:06:11,720
Like what is this?

266
00:06:11,779 --> 00:06:12,399
What does this mean?

267
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,290
So another one, it's available,

268
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:16,149
but the last drop sold out in 24

269
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:16,720
hours.

270
00:06:16,779 --> 00:06:17,500
Same thing here.

271
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,550
You could say for one that's like,

272
00:06:19,589 --> 00:06:21,339
you could do that for a taste of

273
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:22,660
sunshine as well.

274
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,569
It's available, but the last drop

275
00:06:24,589 --> 00:06:26,180
sold out in 24 hours.

276
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,829
If you want the cold, hard facts,

277
00:06:27,829 --> 00:06:29,459
we got them, dot, dot, dot.

278
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:30,379
That would be for like myth

279
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:30,790
busted.

280
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:32,839
That is a banger.

281
00:06:32,939 --> 00:06:33,800
Myth busted.

282
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:35,170
If you want the cold, hard facts,

283
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:36,500
we got them, dot, dot, dot.

284
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,240
Oh my goodness.

285
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,639
I'm smashing that email.

286
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:40,519
I'm smashing to open that.

287
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,220
No one is talking about this, but

288
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:43,740
it will make you more money.

289
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:46,149
That could go with, it's literally

290
00:06:46,149 --> 00:06:47,060
this easy.

291
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,600
Banger.

292
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:51,079
Builds on the subject line.

293
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,720
Looks good.

294
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:54,300
It's a full sentence.

295
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,279
Ends with dot, dot, dot.

296
00:06:55,339 --> 00:06:56,350
That's how you get people to

297
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:56,759
click.

298
00:06:56,839 --> 00:06:58,779
Again, don't overthink it.

299
00:06:58,839 --> 00:06:59,750
If your email content is good,

300
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:00,649
people are going to open your

301
00:07:00,649 --> 00:07:01,560
emails no matter what.

302
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:02,709
No matter what your subject line

303
00:07:02,709 --> 00:07:03,500
and preview text.

304
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:05,100
You have good designs, you have

305
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,569
good copy, you have good branding,

306
00:07:06,569 --> 00:07:07,550
all that good stuff.

307
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,120
People will just continue to open

308
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,649
your emails and start to open your

309
00:07:10,649 --> 00:07:11,579
emails based off the

310
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:12,800
sender name and not the subject

311
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,819
line and preview text.

312
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:15,100
So don't overthink it.

313
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,050
Don't get too caught up.

314
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,220
Focus more on your content.

315
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:18,600
And the opens will take care of

316
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:19,220
themselves.

317
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,259
Okay, so now let's talk about

318
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:23,759
subject lines and preview text.

319
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:25,959
I get asked about these a lot.

320
00:07:26,019 --> 00:07:27,699
Subject lines and preview text.

321
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:29,060
And so let us talk about them and

322
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,480
break them down and give you some

323
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,519
simple frameworks to

324
00:07:31,579 --> 00:07:33,199
use for this to make them as easy

325
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:34,100
as possible.

326
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:36,860
Now, I am under the belief that

327
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:39,310
your subject line and your preview

328
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:41,379
text should not matter for

329
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:41,860
getting opens.

330
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,360
A lot of times people are using

331
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,240
the subject line and preview text.

332
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,310
Like if you have bad opens, you're

333
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:47,370
like, oh, it's a subject line and

334
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:48,019
preview text.

335
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:50,079
Disagree completely.

336
00:07:50,189 --> 00:07:52,230
Your content in your emails should

337
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,120
be so good and your cadence just

338
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:55,689
like so consistent that

339
00:07:55,779 --> 00:07:57,009
you're sending emails on like this

340
00:07:57,009 --> 00:07:57,959
consistent cadence.

341
00:07:58,019 --> 00:07:59,589
The content is so good every time

342
00:07:59,589 --> 00:08:01,339
that the customers are conditioned

343
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:02,459
to open every email

344
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:03,379
no matter what.

345
00:08:03,819 --> 00:08:05,379
We want them to open our emails

346
00:08:05,379 --> 00:08:07,079
based off our sender name rather

347
00:08:07,129 --> 00:08:08,420
than off of the subject

348
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,199
line and preview text.

349
00:08:09,259 --> 00:08:10,689
For example, maybe there's like

350
00:08:10,689 --> 00:08:12,069
probably not a lot of people out

351
00:08:12,069 --> 00:08:13,350
there, but there might be

352
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:14,980
some people out there who watch

353
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:16,500
all of my YouTube videos, not

354
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,209
because the title is extremely

355
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:19,230
relevant to them or the

356
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:20,860
description is super important.

357
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:22,720
They just see it's a video from

358
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,139
me.

359
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:24,339
They like my content.

360
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:25,629
And so they're going to watch

361
00:08:25,629 --> 00:08:27,040
every video or at least click on

362
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,069
it and check it out.

363
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:29,250
It's going to be the same thing

364
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,189
for your email list.

365
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:31,230
This happens for a lot of my

366
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:32,110
favorite brands.

367
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:33,960
I'm opening because of it's this

368
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,509
brand.

369
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,649
I don't care what the subject line

370
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:36,559
and preview text says.

371
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:37,990
I'm just going to open their email

372
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:39,259
and see what's inside because

373
00:08:39,259 --> 00:08:40,279
their brand I like.

374
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,360
Their content is always good.

375
00:08:41,418 --> 00:08:43,129
I'm getting information from their

376
00:08:43,129 --> 00:08:44,649
emails and they're constantly

377
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:45,549
sending to me.

378
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:46,879
So it's not a surprise that I'm

379
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:48,139
seeing them in my inbox.

380
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:49,509
I'm just conditioned no matter

381
00:08:49,509 --> 00:08:49,919
what.

382
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,039
When I see this brand, I open

383
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:51,730
every email.

384
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:53,720
So I really look less at the

385
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:56,230
subject line and preview text for

386
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:56,950
opens.

387
00:08:57,039 --> 00:08:58,470
And I think that subject lines of

388
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:00,240
preview text are quite overrated.

389
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:01,799
If you have a strong brand,

390
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:03,159
subject lines and preview text

391
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:04,340
won't matter too much.

392
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:05,899
But the real purpose of subject

393
00:09:05,899 --> 00:09:07,549
lines and preview text is going to

394
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:08,399
be for sales.

395
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:09,830
That's all we care about in

396
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:10,659
marketing.

397
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,659
We want more sales.

398
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,070
So different subject lines and

399
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:14,529
preview text are going to change

400
00:09:14,529 --> 00:09:16,490
the frame of your email and prime

401
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:17,730
the customer for sales in

402
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:18,919
different ways.

403
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:20,950
So if somebody sees an email, like

404
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:22,059
for example, you have a

405
00:09:22,059 --> 00:09:23,220
bestsellers email.

406
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:24,700
If you just say these are the

407
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,600
bestsellers versus bestsellers low

408
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,490
on stock, those are going to have

409
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,340
different views in the customer's

410
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:30,840
eyes.

411
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:32,009
They're going to open the email

412
00:09:32,009 --> 00:09:32,700
differently.

413
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:34,279
They're going to be thinking about

414
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:35,700
the products through the email

415
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,070
differently based off what we

416
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:37,529
said.

417
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,480
So we've had some subject lines of

418
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,250
preview text generate literally 3x

419
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:42,679
more revenue than others.

420
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:44,440
Same copy and design.

421
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:46,080
Any A-B tests.

422
00:09:46,139 --> 00:09:47,370
Test your subject lines based on

423
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:48,730
revenue and less about opens.

424
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:49,690
Let's look at this example.

425
00:09:49,769 --> 00:09:51,740
Same exact email right here.

426
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,669
These are the same email but

427
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:55,730
different subject lines and

428
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:56,970
preview text.

429
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:00,830
This had less opens, less open

430
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:04,529
rate, much higher click rate, and

431
00:10:04,549 --> 00:10:06,759
a 3x in revenue.

432
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:10,080
Placed order rate.

433
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:11,940
Just from subject line.

434
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,330
We changed the frame at which

435
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:16,940
somebody opened that email.

436
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,929
I believe it was an abandoned cart

437
00:10:18,929 --> 00:10:20,669
email and it said like this one

438
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,210
said like finish your order

439
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,320
and then this one said like your

440
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:25,769
order is ready to ship or

441
00:10:25,809 --> 00:10:27,139
something like that

442
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,159
to really prime it in the

443
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:29,669
customer's head that like you have

444
00:10:29,669 --> 00:10:31,480
an order, it's ready to go,

445
00:10:31,539 --> 00:10:33,009
we're ready for you, just make the

446
00:10:33,009 --> 00:10:34,250
move rather than like you left

447
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:35,789
something behind or something like

448
00:10:35,789 --> 00:10:36,100
that.

449
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,980
Just completely changes the frame

450
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,690
of the email and gets different

451
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:40,419
results.

452
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,419
So really test off your revenue.

453
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:44,019
Think of your subject line as your

454
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:45,539
headline, preview text as your

455
00:10:45,549 --> 00:10:46,500
sub-headline.

456
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:47,610
You don't want to give away all

457
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:48,870
your information in your subject

458
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:49,879
line and preview text.

459
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:52,009
We want to give people a hint but

460
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:54,320
in order to really know what we're

461
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:54,899
saying,

462
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,450
they need to open the email to

463
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:57,120
find out more.

464
00:10:57,179 --> 00:10:58,779
So that's really the main things

465
00:10:58,779 --> 00:11:00,379
to make sure that we're getting

466
00:11:00,379 --> 00:11:02,220
like enough opens is give them a

467
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:02,539
hint,

468
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,960
don't tell them the full story.

469
00:11:04,019 --> 00:11:05,279
It's just the headline and the

470
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:06,740
sub-headline that's teasing the

471
00:11:06,809 --> 00:11:07,240
open.

472
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:08,799
So this is a simple subject line

473
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:10,620
framework that we use most often.

474
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:11,879
It looks clean, it builds

475
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:13,370
intrigue, and will prime your

476
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:14,860
customer for a purchase.

477
00:11:14,929 --> 00:11:17,009
This is for subject lines and then

478
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:19,299
we'll go into preview text next.

479
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,179
So typically what we're doing is

480
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,269
two to five words and again, don't

481
00:11:23,269 --> 00:11:25,090
overthink subject lines of preview

482
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:25,399
text.

483
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,789
There's really no right answer for

484
00:11:27,789 --> 00:11:29,759
all of them but just do spend a

485
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:31,600
little bit of time on them.

486
00:11:31,659 --> 00:11:33,240
But this is like typically what we

487
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,590
use most of the time but it's

488
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:36,159
important to always be mixing it

489
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:36,580
up.

490
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:38,549
So two to five words in length,

491
00:11:38,549 --> 00:11:39,820
nothing too long.

492
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:40,909
We don't want to write a whole

493
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:42,190
sentence because that's going to

494
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:43,179
get cut off and it's going to

495
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:43,899
scare people off.

496
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,629
Two to five words in length, it's

497
00:11:45,629 --> 00:11:47,100
short and sweet and it builds

498
00:11:47,149 --> 00:11:48,730
intrigue just having a shorter

499
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:49,539
headline.

500
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,179
Title case, like this sentence, I

501
00:11:51,179 --> 00:11:52,320
always think it looks more

502
00:11:52,389 --> 00:11:54,370
official, adds more legitimacy to

503
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,409
the email rather than having it be

504
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,559
sentence case.

505
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:01,350
Builds curiosity, so we're selling

506
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:02,740
people to click.

507
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,809
It ends with one to two emojis,

508
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:07,159
this is optional, good to do every

509
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:08,299
now and again.

510
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,659
So let's look at these examples.

511
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:11,350
Title case, two to five words in

512
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:13,179
length, builds curiosity, ends

513
00:12:13,179 --> 00:12:14,470
with an emoji, a taste of

514
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:15,340
sunshine.

515
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:17,139
Ooh, what does that mean?

516
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:19,269
Builds your curiosity, myth

517
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:20,100
busted.

518
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:21,600
What myth is busted, what?

519
00:12:21,669 --> 00:12:23,460
Builds curiosity, they're finally

520
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:24,980
here, what's finally here?

521
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,600
It's literally this easy, what's

522
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,240
this easy?

523
00:12:27,299 --> 00:12:28,799
It builds curiosity, it looks

524
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:30,620
clean, it looks official, and then

525
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,279
the emojis are just like an added

526
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:32,720
touch,

527
00:12:32,779 --> 00:12:34,070
which you don't want to do every

528
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:35,480
single time, but you want to do a

529
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,720
good amount of the time.

530
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:38,080
Let's include emojis, they work.

531
00:12:38,139 --> 00:12:40,240
And then a preview text framework.

532
00:12:40,299 --> 00:12:42,149
Do not overthink it.

533
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,860
Preview text, just build off the

534
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:45,299
subject line and create more

535
00:12:45,299 --> 00:12:46,039
curiosity.

536
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,070
That's all it is.

537
00:12:47,139 --> 00:12:48,080
Do not overthink it.

538
00:12:48,139 --> 00:12:49,450
So here's a framework that feeds

539
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:50,659
off of the subject line that I

540
00:12:50,659 --> 00:12:52,230
like to use for the preview text.

541
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,850
So we want the preview text to be

542
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:55,279
one full sentence long.

543
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:57,690
Regular capitalization, so we're

544
00:12:57,690 --> 00:12:58,980
not capitalizing each thing, just

545
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,029
regular sentence case.

546
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,309
It's going to add support to the

547
00:13:01,309 --> 00:13:02,039
subject line.

548
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,519
And every now and again, a good

549
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:04,990
tip that I like to use is end with

550
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:06,039
dot, dot, dot.

551
00:13:06,139 --> 00:13:07,850
Really builds your intrigue and

552
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:09,629
kind of like leaves the customer

553
00:13:09,629 --> 00:13:10,820
like unfinished.

554
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:12,570
And so some examples, this wasn't

555
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:14,200
supposed to be made, but now it's

556
00:13:14,299 --> 00:13:16,090
a bestseller, dot, dot, dot.

557
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,440
That dot, dot, dot just really

558
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,700
builds your intrigue and you're

559
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:19,309
like, oh.

560
00:13:19,379 --> 00:13:20,690
And so builds off of like the

561
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,440
subject line, for example, that

562
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,940
would be like a taste of sunshine

563
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,090
with the subject.

564
00:13:25,159 --> 00:13:26,519
With the preview text, this wasn't

565
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:27,830
supposed to be made, but now it's

566
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:29,029
a bestseller and it's a taste of

567
00:13:29,029 --> 00:13:29,759
sunshine.

568
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:30,340
Holy cow.

569
00:13:30,419 --> 00:13:31,389
Like what is this?

570
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:32,080
What does this mean?

571
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,220
So another one, it's available,

572
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,860
but the last drop sold out in 24

573
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:36,399
hours.

574
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:37,179
Same thing here.

575
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,230
You could say for one that's like,

576
00:13:39,269 --> 00:13:41,019
you could do that for a taste of

577
00:13:41,019 --> 00:13:42,340
sunshine as well.

578
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,669
It's available, but the last drop

579
00:13:44,669 --> 00:13:45,860
sold out in 24 hours.

580
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:47,509
If you want the cold, hard facts,

581
00:13:47,509 --> 00:13:49,120
we got them, dot, dot, dot.

582
00:13:49,179 --> 00:13:50,039
That would be for like myth

583
00:13:50,059 --> 00:13:50,450
busted.

584
00:13:50,539 --> 00:13:52,500
That is a banger.

585
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:53,490
Myth busted.

586
00:13:53,559 --> 00:13:54,850
If you want the cold, hard facts,

587
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:56,149
we got them, dot, dot, dot.

588
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:56,899
Oh my goodness.

589
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,299
I'm smashing that email.

590
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,210
I'm smashing to open that.

591
00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:01,899
No one is talking about this, but

592
00:14:01,899 --> 00:14:03,419
it will make you more money.

593
00:14:03,539 --> 00:14:05,919
That could go with it.

594
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:06,750
It's literally this easy.

595
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:09,299
Banger.

596
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:10,750
Builds on the subject line.

597
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,399
Looks good.

598
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,289
It's a full sentence, ends with

599
00:14:14,289 --> 00:14:14,960
dot, dot, dot.

600
00:14:15,019 --> 00:14:16,039
That's how you get people to

601
00:14:16,039 --> 00:14:16,460
click.

602
00:14:16,539 --> 00:14:18,460
Again, don't overthink it.

603
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:19,429
If your email content is good,

604
00:14:19,429 --> 00:14:20,330
people are going to open your

605
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:21,240
emails no matter what.

606
00:14:21,299 --> 00:14:22,389
No matter what your subject line

607
00:14:22,389 --> 00:14:23,149
and preview text.

608
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,559
You have good designs, you have

609
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:26,169
good copy, you have good branding,

610
00:14:26,169 --> 00:14:27,240
all that good stuff.

611
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,720
People will just continue to open

612
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,320
your emails and start to open your

613
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,299
emails based off the

614
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,490
sender name and not the subject

615
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:33,500
line and preview text.

616
00:14:33,559 --> 00:14:34,779
So don't overthink it.

617
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,730
Don't get too caught up.

618
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:37,139
Focus more on your content and the

619
00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:38,090
opens will take care of

620
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:38,799
themselves.
