1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,000
Let's talk about it.

2
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:02,080
Number one, we're going to talk

3
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:03,000
about ease of click.

4
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:04,209
So when customers are

5
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:05,860
opening our emails, they are in

6
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:06,650
zombie mode.

7
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:08,279
Any friction in the ability for

8
00:00:08,279 --> 00:00:09,259
someone to click

9
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:10,689
on our button to go to our site

10
00:00:10,689 --> 00:00:12,369
will automatically lead to churn

11
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:14,419
if there's any friction at all.

12
00:00:14,439 --> 00:00:16,230
So we need to literally hand them

13
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:18,019
the click on a silver platter.

14
00:00:18,089 --> 00:00:19,750
So you can do this with having

15
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:21,079
buttons above the fold, which

16
00:00:21,079 --> 00:00:22,210
we'll talk about, which is

17
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:23,579
essentially having your button

18
00:00:23,579 --> 00:00:23,920
high up

19
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:24,839
in the email so the customer

20
00:00:24,989 --> 00:00:26,190
doesn't have to scroll, spun above

21
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:27,309
the fold, and then you want

22
00:00:27,339 --> 00:00:28,789
to make sure your buttons are very

23
00:00:28,789 --> 00:00:30,280
large so that somebody, even with

24
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,640
small thumbs, even

25
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:32,729
a blind person could click it.

26
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:33,679
And that's how big you want your

27
00:00:33,799 --> 00:00:34,270
buttons to be.

28
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:35,070
And then you

29
00:00:35,149 --> 00:00:36,560
want to make sure they're clear.

30
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,020
So there's nothing around them.

31
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:39,020
It's just, this is like

32
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:40,460
the focal point of the email and

33
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:41,469
make those buttons.

34
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,829
And then also you want to make

35
00:00:42,829 --> 00:00:43,159
them

36
00:00:43,429 --> 00:00:43,899
centered.

37
00:00:43,899 --> 00:00:45,789
So these are all about the button.

38
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,719
The button is the most important

39
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:48,420
part about

40
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,039
your email.

41
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:50,439
You need to make sure that it's

42
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:51,679
super clear and all of these

43
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:52,439
things will do

44
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:53,060
that for you.

45
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:54,240
But again, just to touch on

46
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,799
customers are just in zombie mode.

47
00:00:55,799 --> 00:00:56,789
They're not sitting

48
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,170
down, annotating their emails and

49
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:01,119
just waiting to that they're

50
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:02,340
getting up to go to the bathroom.

51
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:03,250
They're opening their email for

52
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:03,789
three seconds.

53
00:01:03,789 --> 00:01:05,260
So we need to make it very, very

54
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:05,950
easy for them.

55
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:07,159
So let's talk about button above

56
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:07,590
the fold.

57
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,129
So the above the fold section is

58
00:01:09,129 --> 00:01:09,849
the section of

59
00:01:09,909 --> 00:01:11,340
your email that is viewed without

60
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:11,920
scrolling.

61
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,730
So if you go to this example, I

62
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:15,150
just opened up

63
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:16,980
my email and immediately when I

64
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:18,870
open, this is the above the fold

65
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:19,599
section.

66
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:21,280
This is stuff that

67
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:21,760
is viewable.

68
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,760
Now I could scroll and look at the

69
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,239
other part of the email, but in

70
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:25,120
this above the

71
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:26,590
fold section, you can see, I can

72
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:27,159
see the logo.

73
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,920
There's a headline, some body copy

74
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:29,459
and a button

75
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:32,819
all above the fold, which is

76
00:01:32,819 --> 00:01:34,280
amazing.

77
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,980
So not every customer will scroll

78
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:36,760
your email.

79
00:01:36,769 --> 00:01:37,359
So there's

80
00:01:37,609 --> 00:01:38,430
always going to be a drop off.

81
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:39,719
Some people just open and leave.

82
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:42,359
So you want to make sure that you

83
00:01:42,579 --> 00:01:43,730
have a button available in the

84
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:45,489
hero section so that 100% of the

85
00:01:45,489 --> 00:01:46,799
people who open your email

86
00:01:47,069 --> 00:01:48,799
will see a button.

87
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:50,870
So including a top button in your

88
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:52,739
email designs is an easy, low

89
00:01:52,739 --> 00:01:53,280
hanging fruit,

90
00:01:53,299 --> 00:01:54,680
and that's going to automatically

91
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,680
improve your click rates

92
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,420
guaranteed.

93
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:59,480
Now let's talk about large

94
00:01:59,739 --> 00:01:59,950
buttons.

95
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:01,269
You want to make sure your buttons

96
00:02:01,269 --> 00:02:01,689
are big.

97
00:02:01,689 --> 00:02:03,040
So an iPhone screen is 2.75

98
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:03,599
inches.

99
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:04,159
That's not a

100
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:04,640
lot.

101
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,980
Unfortunately, sorry, all the lads

102
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,550
out there, but 2.75 inches is not

103
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:10,758
a large space.

104
00:02:10,758 --> 00:02:11,740
So the larger your

105
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,500
button is, the more surface area,

106
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,759
the easier it is to click.

107
00:02:14,909 --> 00:02:15,699
Pretty obvious.

108
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:17,030
So this actually has a

109
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:18,669
massive impact on conversions.

110
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:20,199
So we can look at this bad example

111
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:21,030
here from Nike.

112
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:21,909
Look at how small

113
00:02:22,169 --> 00:02:22,849
this button is.

114
00:02:22,949 --> 00:02:24,409
It's about like half an inch if

115
00:02:24,409 --> 00:02:26,129
it's on a phone screen versus this

116
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:27,080
button here,

117
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:28,699
which is like two inches wide.

118
00:02:28,699 --> 00:02:30,259
Even a blind person could click

119
00:02:30,259 --> 00:02:30,710
this.

120
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:31,949
So easy.

121
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,139
It's just,

122
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:35,310
it doesn't compare.

123
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:37,969
And you would have to be, even a

124
00:02:37,969 --> 00:02:39,080
blind person could click it.

125
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:39,889
As simple as that.

126
00:02:40,139 --> 00:02:41,039
So that's going to be a lot more

127
00:02:41,189 --> 00:02:42,310
clear that people can click it and

128
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:43,509
you're subconsciously going to get

129
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:44,960
people to click it more and have

130
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,479
their eyes just gravitate towards

131
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:46,819
it.

132
00:02:46,819 --> 00:02:48,870
That applies as well to clear

133
00:02:49,139 --> 00:02:49,719
calls to action.

134
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:51,159
So the goal of an email obviously

135
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:52,479
is to get somebody to click.

136
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:53,740
And so your button should

137
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,500
be the easiest part of your email.

138
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,110
And there should be no ability for

139
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,979
someone to click over a button or

140
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,009
to view over a button.

141
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:01,169
You just want it to be super

142
00:03:01,169 --> 00:03:01,590
clear.

143
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:02,539
Here's the button.

144
00:03:02,539 --> 00:03:03,599
So avoid distracting

145
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:05,229
backgrounds and contrasting colors

146
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,560
to get your CTAs to stand out.

147
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:08,080
So here's like a bad example.

148
00:03:08,469 --> 00:03:09,840
Like you can't even really see it.

149
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,069
If I'm just like opening my email

150
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:12,240
and quickly scrolling,

151
00:03:12,259 --> 00:03:13,539
I'm not even going to see this

152
00:03:13,539 --> 00:03:14,030
button.

153
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:15,169
A very bad example versus

154
00:03:15,169 --> 00:03:16,180
something like this,

155
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:17,960
where it's, there's nothing around

156
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,219
it.

157
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,860
There's enough space between the

158
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,259
title and the picture.

159
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:22,669
They're not putting the button

160
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:23,860
like over top this picture

161
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:24,460
slightly.

162
00:03:24,469 --> 00:03:25,120
It's clear.

163
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:25,860
It's in its own,

164
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:27,500
it's in its own space and nobody's

165
00:03:27,539 --> 00:03:29,219
going to miss it essentially.

166
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:31,780
And then we also want to have our

167
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:32,780
buttons centered.

168
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:35,009
So let's go back to this Nike

169
00:03:35,009 --> 00:03:35,750
example.

170
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:36,219
So

171
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,110
the thing about buttons and having

172
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:39,650
your button on the left side of

173
00:03:39,729 --> 00:03:41,300
the screen is that think about

174
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,379
holding your phone in your right

175
00:03:42,379 --> 00:03:42,659
hand.

176
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:43,729
Most everybody holds their phone

177
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:44,479
in the right hand

178
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:45,949
because we're not weirdo lefties.

179
00:03:45,949 --> 00:03:46,520
I'm kidding.

180
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:47,819
Sorry, all the lefties.

181
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:49,020
But you actually have to like

182
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,090
stretch your thumb to reach

183
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:51,060
buttons on the left side,

184
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,409
especially if your button's at the

185
00:03:52,469 --> 00:03:52,900
top of your

186
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:54,530
email, you've top left of your

187
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:56,310
email, you have to like stretch.

188
00:03:56,409 --> 00:03:58,810
And that actually really impacts

189
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:00,159
conversions as well.

190
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,620
So we even did that for not a

191
00:04:01,629 --> 00:04:03,419
button that was at the top left,

192
00:04:03,419 --> 00:04:04,280
but just in the

193
00:04:04,539 --> 00:04:05,860
middle, but to the left versus

194
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:06,530
centered.

195
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:07,990
And we noticed a different in

196
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:10,039
place to order rate of 6.6%

197
00:04:10,069 --> 00:04:13,939
or 7.5% of 15 K to 19.9 K.

198
00:04:13,979 --> 00:04:16,930
And then about a 10% increase in

199
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:20,000
clicks here, despite having less

200
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,480
opens,

201
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,680
a lot more revenue.

202
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,430
So that's just like an example of

203
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,100
like AB test we did there.

204
00:04:25,329 --> 00:04:27,069
And it's pretty ridiculous how

205
00:04:27,069 --> 00:04:29,110
much something like stretching

206
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:30,769
your thumb can have on your

207
00:04:30,769 --> 00:04:31,850
conversions.
