00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,149
Hello hello so in this video i

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,250
just wanted to give you just a

3
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:06,639
brief look around as to figma

4
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:08,108
some of its main features and

5
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:09,839
really just the main stuff you're

6
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:11,660
going to use to be quite honest

7
00:00:11,689 --> 00:00:11,919
like

8
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:13,740
you're just way better off just

9
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,589
exploring yourself and messing

10
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:17,600
around inside of the platform but

11
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:17,679
i

12
00:00:17,739 --> 00:00:18,989
just wanted to give you some of

13
00:00:18,989 --> 00:00:20,350
this just to show you around like

14
00:00:20,449 --> 00:00:21,920
some of the main stuff that you

15
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:23,829
will use so all i did was i went

16
00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:26,079
to figma and then i clicked create

17
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:27,839
new design file and this is

18
00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:29,920
exactly the page that it took me

19
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,839
to so this is your figma design

20
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:33,990
file it is as simple as this so

21
00:00:34,219 --> 00:00:35,700
this is essentially where you are

22
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,159
designing this central area you

23
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,630
have like your file where it's at

24
00:00:38,859 --> 00:00:39,979
and then you have like all this

25
00:00:39,979 --> 00:00:41,140
stuff and then you have all this

26
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:42,799
stuff and then this stuff so

27
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:43,289
essentially

28
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,630
what we have here on this left

29
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,039
side these are like your layers so

30
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:47,679
once you start inputting designs

31
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:47,899
into

32
00:00:47,979 --> 00:00:49,939
this area they're going to show up

33
00:00:49,939 --> 00:00:51,920
here so let's just run you through

34
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:53,469
an example so if i go here

35
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:54,890
these are different shapes that

36
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:56,189
you can use and you're going to be

37
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:57,520
using a lot of shapes more often

38
00:00:57,579 --> 00:00:59,429
than not you'll be using something

39
00:00:59,479 --> 00:01:00,990
like a rectangle so if i add a

40
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:02,960
rectangle and i put the size right

41
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:04,950
here you'll notice that a layer

42
00:01:04,969 --> 00:01:06,969
went over here on the left side so

43
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:09,129
and you will see this is over here

44
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:10,469
so if i were to copy this and

45
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,739
duplicate it now we have two

46
00:01:11,739 --> 00:01:13,280
layers and each one if i click on

47
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:13,599
it it's

48
00:01:13,659 --> 00:01:14,859
going to reference a different

49
00:01:14,859 --> 00:01:15,939
layer so this is exactly like

50
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:17,519
where everything will show up here

51
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:17,609
on the

52
00:01:17,739 --> 00:01:19,359
left left and this helps with

53
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:21,450
organization for example you could

54
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:24,879
say rectangle um cool and then

55
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:25,140
this one

56
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:26,810
could be rectangle not cool i

57
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:28,439
don't know why i went with those

58
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:30,239
names but you know what i mean you

59
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:32,340
have these so you'll also notice

60
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:34,250
that with a shape you have this

61
00:01:34,379 --> 00:01:36,709
stuff here on the right side so

62
00:01:36,739 --> 00:01:37,040
this is

63
00:01:37,099 --> 00:01:38,280
where you can do a lot of the

64
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,890
customization with your stuff so

65
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:41,510
kind of the main stuff here is you

66
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:41,579
have

67
00:01:41,819 --> 00:01:43,049
width so if you don't want to do

68
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:44,430
this yourself you can adjust this

69
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:46,079
and you'll notice the width will

70
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:46,719
adjust

71
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:48,569
as well as height you can do that

72
00:01:48,569 --> 00:01:50,349
and adjust those if you want to

73
00:01:50,349 --> 00:01:52,390
adjust things where they're locked

74
00:01:52,459 --> 00:01:54,280
in proportion like say i wanted to

75
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,170
keep this exact shape but i wanted

76
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:58,870
to increase it as a whole like

77
00:01:58,939 --> 00:02:00,280
maybe i wanted to double it you

78
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,870
can lock these two together so you

79
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:03,329
could lock this and if i wanted to

80
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,329
make this 400 the height is going

81
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:06,900
to move in proportion so that's

82
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,240
something cool that you can

83
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:10,008
do and then you can unlock it by

84
00:02:10,008 --> 00:02:11,909
doing this so it's one thing that

85
00:02:11,949 --> 00:02:13,599
you can do of course you can

86
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:13,919
change

87
00:02:13,979 --> 00:02:15,620
colors here mess around with your

88
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:17,189
colors you can even do some cool

89
00:02:17,189 --> 00:02:19,199
stuff over here like if you add

90
00:02:19,259 --> 00:02:20,550
this section like a gradient you

91
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:21,800
can make a gradient and you can

92
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,120
mess around there i won't go too

93
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:23,439
much

94
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,169
into that stuff but there's

95
00:02:25,169 --> 00:02:27,270
gradients there that you can do so

96
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:29,199
that's what you can do over here

97
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:29,520
you have

98
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,129
things like you can add like a

99
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:32,879
stroke like you can add um like a

100
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,639
border to it for example so you

101
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:34,800
can

102
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,699
see here's like the color of your

103
00:02:36,699 --> 00:02:38,189
border the opacity so how

104
00:02:38,189 --> 00:02:40,000
see-through you want it to be

105
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,240
that's what

106
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,800
these percentages are um you can

107
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,370
add inside outside whatever you

108
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:44,960
want you can change the width of

109
00:02:45,009 --> 00:02:45,199
it so

110
00:02:45,259 --> 00:02:46,939
if i wanted it to be 20 then it's

111
00:02:46,939 --> 00:02:48,430
a lot thicker of a border so i'm

112
00:02:48,449 --> 00:02:51,199
just going to undo that so let me

113
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:51,680
undo

114
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:53,129
that there we go and then i just

115
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:54,780
want to remove this you can change

116
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,639
all sorts of different stuff with

117
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:57,240
it

118
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:58,780
you have things like effects so

119
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,250
you can add a shadow you can add a

120
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,599
layer blur so you can see

121
00:03:01,659 --> 00:03:02,840
like the corner got layered you

122
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,159
could add a background blur if you

123
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:05,110
have a background you can

124
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:06,550
add an inner shadow so you can see

125
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:07,870
on the top there there's like a

126
00:03:07,889 --> 00:03:09,439
little shadow and then say you do

127
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,080
choose one of these let's do an

128
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,719
inner shadow you can adjust it

129
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:14,639
even further by clicking here and

130
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:14,800
then

131
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,129
changing like the coordinates of

132
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:17,289
it whatever you want to do a lot

133
00:03:17,289 --> 00:03:18,639
of this stuff is advanced and you

134
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:20,289
really won't really use it so

135
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,110
let's just delete that you can do

136
00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:23,919
like layers so if you want your

137
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:24,400
layers

138
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,740
to adjust in any sort of way you

139
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:29,210
can do this all this fancy stuff

140
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:31,280
add different filters but

141
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:33,460
again like i rarely use that and i

142
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:35,719
create emails all day every day so

143
00:03:35,719 --> 00:03:37,919
that's some stuff that you can

144
00:03:37,979 --> 00:03:39,610
do and then you have these layers

145
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:41,210
so some stuff that you are going

146
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,039
to do however is you're going to

147
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:43,199
like

148
00:03:43,259 --> 00:03:44,879
group stuff and put them together

149
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,490
so one thing that you can do let's

150
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,080
say this is all going to be part

151
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:48,159
of

152
00:03:48,219 --> 00:03:49,909
like a cohesive design we go here

153
00:03:49,909 --> 00:03:51,379
change this and let's say we

154
00:03:51,389 --> 00:03:53,180
wanted to group these together

155
00:03:53,259 --> 00:03:55,370
you can just click on both of them

156
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:57,629
just by holding down shift and you

157
00:03:57,629 --> 00:03:59,349
can just left click and you can

158
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,509
group so a few different options

159
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:03,370
here you can group them you can

160
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:05,439
frame them so if we just click a

161
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:05,689
group

162
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,750
then we have a group here and if

163
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,590
you down to this then they're

164
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,650
together and now it's together

165
00:04:12,699 --> 00:04:14,729
you can also turn any group into

166
00:04:14,729 --> 00:04:16,829
what's called a frame so kind of

167
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:19,040
frame is like a level up from a

168
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,800
group so you can have groups

169
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,930
inside of frames so that's kind of

170
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,800
as far as it goes you have frames

171
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,009
then you add groups and then you

172
00:04:26,019 --> 00:04:27,370
can add multiple different groups

173
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:28,810
underneath them you can name this

174
00:04:28,939 --> 00:04:32,279
group rectangles so typically when

175
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:35,519
we're talking about email design

176
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:38,560
we're going to be using a frame as

177
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,740
a singular design so your designs

178
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,910
are going to be frames whereas you

179
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:45,040
have groups within your frames

180
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,579
so you have groups within your

181
00:04:46,579 --> 00:04:48,110
emails which is frame so let's

182
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:49,839
just name this frame let's just

183
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:50,540
say email

184
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:52,470
number one so we have an email

185
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:54,850
here and typically for your emails

186
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:56,800
you want to be 600 width so i'm

187
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:56,879
just

188
00:04:56,939 --> 00:04:58,769
going to change that and now this

189
00:04:58,769 --> 00:05:00,449
is our frame so we are going to

190
00:05:00,449 --> 00:05:02,800
create a frame let's make it 600

191
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,350
wide and

192
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:06,399
then let's make it like 800 tall

193
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:08,610
now this is our frame so some

194
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:10,819
different stuff you can do with

195
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:11,279
frame

196
00:05:11,339 --> 00:05:12,649
so we can even i'm just going to

197
00:05:12,649 --> 00:05:14,079
remove these from the group and

198
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:15,600
you'll see it from the frame and

199
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:15,680
you

200
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:16,879
can see that the frame is now

201
00:05:16,889 --> 00:05:18,350
lonely so typically like when you

202
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:19,500
have your emails you want a

203
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,000
specific

204
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,600
background for your emails so you

205
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,000
can add a fill to your frame and

206
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,509
have this be like the background

207
00:05:24,769 --> 00:05:24,800
to

208
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:26,879
your email so for example let's

209
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:29,040
add like a logo section i'm going

210
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,439
to create a new rectangle i'm

211
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:31,759
going to

212
00:05:31,819 --> 00:05:33,149
put you like this and then i'll

213
00:05:33,149 --> 00:05:34,990
adjust the width to be 600 so it's

214
00:05:35,009 --> 00:05:37,120
the full width of the frame and

215
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:37,269
then

216
00:05:37,339 --> 00:05:39,529
let's make you like 100 tall and

217
00:05:39,529 --> 00:05:41,420
then we can just slide this in and

218
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:43,279
adjust it and then now we have we

219
00:05:43,339 --> 00:05:45,269
can just imagine this is a logo

220
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:47,269
and then right here we can name

221
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:49,500
this logo section and that right

222
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:49,839
there

223
00:05:49,899 --> 00:05:51,750
is like a logo section so some

224
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,850
cool stuff you can do there and of

225
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:56,079
course you can add images in so

226
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:56,240
let's

227
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,970
say for our email we wanted to add

228
00:05:57,970 --> 00:05:59,639
like a hero image all you have to

229
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:01,110
do to add any sort of image

230
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:02,930
is you can just go right up here

231
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:04,589
to left you can go to file and

232
00:06:04,589 --> 00:06:06,620
place image so i'm just going to

233
00:06:06,629 --> 00:06:06,959
go

234
00:06:07,019 --> 00:06:09,290
place an image oops okay so here

235
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:11,730
we go i just grabbed an image just

236
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:14,160
my logo and you can place your

237
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:15,829
image wherever so let's just place

238
00:06:15,829 --> 00:06:17,250
you right here for now and it's

239
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,879
going to change to the size it was

240
00:06:18,939 --> 00:06:20,379
thousand by a thousand so here it

241
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:21,829
is and then we can adjust this so

242
00:06:21,829 --> 00:06:23,350
i have these locked let's change

243
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:24,160
it to like

244
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:26,189
five let's see if this is 600

245
00:06:26,189 --> 00:06:27,930
width maybe we'll have this be

246
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:30,319
like 400 width so it can take up

247
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:30,639
this

248
00:06:30,699 --> 00:06:32,420
whole section and then we can

249
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:34,360
center it here and then boom now

250
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,199
we have an image but we want to

251
00:06:36,269 --> 00:06:36,399
make

252
00:06:36,459 --> 00:06:37,980
sure that it's inside of the frame

253
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,379
so if it's ever not in the frame

254
00:06:39,379 --> 00:06:40,870
and you want it to be you can just

255
00:06:41,019 --> 00:06:43,779
drag it in and we'll go right here

256
00:06:43,779 --> 00:06:46,600
so boom now we have our main image

257
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,279
and then boom now we have a full

258
00:06:49,339 --> 00:06:51,449
frame and you can create groups

259
00:06:51,449 --> 00:06:53,589
within them so we also have this

260
00:06:53,589 --> 00:06:55,759
text text feature which of course

261
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:55,839
you

262
00:06:55,899 --> 00:06:58,709
can add text of any kind we could

263
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:01,600
say this is a sub headline and

264
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:05,519
then just like it's a google doc

265
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:05,680
you

266
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:07,579
have all your information here so

267
00:07:07,579 --> 00:07:09,319
let's center it we can make this

268
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:11,920
bigger we can go like 24 and then

269
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,000
we

270
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,910
can bold it and then boom we have

271
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:16,000
a sub headline let's say we wanted

272
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,680
to add body copy i'm just going

273
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:19,860
to copy and paste this and then

274
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:22,449
let's change you to like 18 take

275
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:24,800
you bolt take you off bold and be

276
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,139
like

277
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:28,529
this is the body copy of my email

278
00:07:28,529 --> 00:07:31,509
and what we can do within this so

279
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,639
let's just extend this out

280
00:07:34,699 --> 00:07:38,430
and then center you then we have

281
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:41,389
body copy here if you want to just

282
00:07:41,389 --> 00:07:43,519
for organizational purposes you

283
00:07:43,579 --> 00:07:45,509
could group these together even

284
00:07:45,509 --> 00:07:47,480
further so click here shift boom

285
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:49,199
and then group and then we could

286
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:49,600
say

287
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:51,889
this is like a copy section wow i

288
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:56,800
spelled that wrong and then boom

289
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,480
now you have this

290
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:00,680
that's really the extent of what

291
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,689
you use in figma you use shapes

292
00:08:02,689 --> 00:08:04,720
here and there you upload a lot of

293
00:08:04,779 --> 00:08:06,319
images and you can organize them

294
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:07,720
within them and then you can

295
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,189
create all sorts of different

296
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:09,839
emails so

297
00:08:09,899 --> 00:08:11,920
let's just copy and paste this if

298
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,759
we want to create another you'll

299
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,279
see another frame came out we

300
00:08:15,339 --> 00:08:17,370
can rename that email too oh i

301
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:20,350
changed this one to email too let

302
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:22,560
me undo that i want this one to be

303
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:24,329
emailed too if i change this name

304
00:08:24,329 --> 00:08:25,970
it's going to go here and now we

305
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:27,839
have two emails you can collapse

306
00:08:27,899 --> 00:08:29,540
stuff as you go so i'm just going

307
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:31,250
to delete that and then boom now

308
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,200
you can see we have two frames for

309
00:08:33,259 --> 00:08:35,399
emails here and here and that is

310
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:37,668
kind of the extent of what you use

311
00:08:37,668 --> 00:08:40,000
you have you can create frames up

312
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:41,450
here you can create sections which

313
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:42,798
are a little bit different but we

314
00:08:42,798 --> 00:08:44,158
don't even really use them but if

315
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:44,320
you

316
00:08:44,379 --> 00:08:45,679
ever want to create a frame you

317
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:47,200
can just create it just like this

318
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,399
and that is pretty much the extent

319
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:51,990
of what you want to do all sorts

320
00:08:52,059 --> 00:08:53,690
of different stuff but this is

321
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:55,600
just very base what you want you

322
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:55,759
have

323
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,279
all sorts of stuff that you can do

324
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:58,649
here you can view like this is

325
00:08:58,649 --> 00:09:00,159
just your edit properties if you

326
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:00,210
want

327
00:09:00,299 --> 00:09:01,970
to add plugins these are plugins

328
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:03,639
that i use so these are like apps

329
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:05,200
built on to figma so if you want

330
00:09:05,259 --> 00:09:06,860
to create gifts and whatnot you

331
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:08,649
can do that here um screenshots to

332
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:10,159
designs whatever you want to do

333
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:11,279
and then there are widgets which

334
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:12,320
are which are also like little

335
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,320
tools that you can create you can

336
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:14,559
do

337
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,399
all sorts of different stuff

338
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,460
alignment but again i don't even

339
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:20,559
really use those so all sorts of

340
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:21,200
different

341
00:09:21,259 --> 00:09:22,500
shapes that you can use uh the

342
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,990
slice feature is what we'll talk

343
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:25,820
about later this is helpful for so

344
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,820
essentially what a slice does is

345
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,580
you can slice any anything you

346
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,480
want and essentially just be able

347
00:09:31,549 --> 00:09:31,679
to

348
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,460
export just a slice so if i did

349
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:35,320
that and i wanted to export the

350
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,120
slice the slice is just taking

351
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,240
that piece and

352
00:09:38,299 --> 00:09:40,129
then you can export the slice over

353
00:09:40,129 --> 00:09:42,009
here you can export it however you

354
00:09:42,009 --> 00:09:43,360
want and that's how we are

355
00:09:43,419 --> 00:09:44,750
going to be uploading emails but

356
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,029
for now i'm just going to delete

357
00:09:46,129 --> 00:09:49,269
this slice let's see is there

358
00:09:49,269 --> 00:09:49,590
anything

359
00:09:49,659 --> 00:09:51,330
else i'm missing not really you

360
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:53,059
have a pen and pencil if you want

361
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:54,720
to use those uh if you want to

362
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,159
comment

363
00:09:55,259 --> 00:09:57,480
that's this comment feature you

364
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,210
could be hey at max this is

365
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:03,019
terrible um let me just make sure

366
00:10:03,059 --> 00:10:03,429
it actually

367
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,039
tags me so i know that this is

368
00:10:05,049 --> 00:10:06,870
terrible and then boom you have

369
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:08,879
comments like this then you can

370
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:09,279
resolve

371
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:10,470
comments say somebody leaves a

372
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,820
comment and it's resolved you just

373
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,120
click this check mark and it'll

374
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:14,720
go away of course you can share

375
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,480
your file and all that good stuff

376
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:20,399
with whoever you want um but that

377
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:20,580
is

378
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,340
pretty much the extent of what you

379
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:23,720
need in figma the main stuff

380
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,090
you're going to be using is

381
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:25,440
creating

382
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,039
your frames adding in shapes

383
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:28,799
adding in a ton of photos and all

384
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,559
of that good stuff you can even

385
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:31,200
adjust your

386
00:10:31,259 --> 00:10:33,539
photos however you want you can

387
00:10:33,539 --> 00:10:35,669
change your photos um we don't

388
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:38,000
need that let me undo what i just

389
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,200
did

390
00:10:38,299 --> 00:10:40,230
there we go um you can do whatever

391
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:42,029
you want but again you really

392
00:10:42,029 --> 00:10:44,000
don't really use any of this and

393
00:10:44,059 --> 00:10:45,330
just like we could with frames you

394
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:46,669
can add different strokes like if

395
00:10:46,669 --> 00:10:47,990
i wanted to add a border around

396
00:10:48,139 --> 00:10:48,240
this

397
00:10:48,299 --> 00:10:50,470
picture i just added a border so

398
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:52,710
highly recommend you just mess

399
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:54,559
around with this and kind of

400
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,360
experiment but

401
00:10:55,419 --> 00:10:56,960
this is just like the general

402
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:58,639
overview of figma and the main

403
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:00,480
features that you'll use and kind

404
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:00,639
of

405
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,100
just inside my head as i'm

406
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:04,070
navigating figma i just wanted to

407
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:05,750
get you just a live video of me

408
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:06,320
doing this

409
00:11:06,379 --> 00:11:08,820
hello hello so in this video i

410
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:11,299
just wanted to give you just a

411
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,779
brief look around as to figma some

412
00:11:13,909 --> 00:11:14,240
of its

413
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:16,049
main features and really just the

414
00:11:16,049 --> 00:11:17,779
main stuff you're going to use to

415
00:11:17,779 --> 00:11:20,240
be quite honest like you're just

416
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:20,480
way

417
00:11:20,539 --> 00:11:22,210
better off just exploring yourself

418
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:23,759
and messing around inside of the

419
00:11:23,769 --> 00:11:24,950
platform but i just wanted

420
00:11:25,179 --> 00:11:26,700
to give you some of this just to

421
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,340
show you around like some of the

422
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:30,080
main stuff that you will use so

423
00:11:30,139 --> 00:11:31,919
all i did was i went to figma and

424
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:33,929
then i clicked create new design

425
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,159
file and this is exactly the page

426
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:38,240
that it took me to so this is your

427
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,399
figma design file it is as simple

428
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,159
as this so this is essentially

429
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:43,460
where you are designing this

430
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:44,830
central area you have like your

431
00:11:44,929 --> 00:11:46,320
file where it's at and then you

432
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:46,610
have like

433
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,090
all this stuff and then you have

434
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:49,639
all this stuff and then this stuff

435
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:51,039
so essentially what we have

436
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,470
here on this left side these are

437
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:54,009
like your layers so once you start

438
00:11:54,009 --> 00:11:55,909
inputting designs into this area

439
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:57,529
they're going to show up here so

440
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:59,049
let's just run you through an

441
00:11:59,049 --> 00:12:01,039
example so if i go here these are

442
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,379
different shapes that you can use

443
00:12:02,379 --> 00:12:03,639
and you're going to be using a lot

444
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:05,039
of shapes more often than not

445
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,929
you will be using something like a

446
00:12:06,929 --> 00:12:08,710
rectangle so if i add a rectangle

447
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,600
and i put the size right here

448
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,629
you'll notice that a layer went

449
00:12:12,629 --> 00:12:14,629
over here on the left side so and

450
00:12:14,629 --> 00:12:16,639
you will see this is over here so

451
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:17,730
if i were to copy this and

452
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:18,970
duplicate it now we have two

453
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,480
layers and each one if i click on

454
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:20,960
it it's going

455
00:12:21,019 --> 00:12:22,279
to reference a different layer so

456
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:23,299
this is exactly like where

457
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:24,549
everything will show up here on

458
00:12:24,549 --> 00:12:25,429
the left

459
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,730
left and this helps with

460
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:28,659
organization for example you could

461
00:12:28,669 --> 00:12:32,000
say rectangle um cool and then

462
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,399
this one

463
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,940
could be rectangle not cool i

464
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:35,600
don't know why i went with those

465
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,360
names but you know what i mean you

466
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:37,519
have

467
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:39,750
these so you'll also notice that

468
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,889
with a shape you have this stuff

469
00:12:41,889 --> 00:12:44,240
here on the right side so this is

470
00:12:44,299 --> 00:12:45,480
where you can do a lot of the

471
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,100
customization with your stuff so

472
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,690
kind of the main stuff here is you

473
00:12:48,779 --> 00:12:50,120
have width so if you don't want to

474
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,500
do this yourself you can adjust

475
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,039
this and you'll notice the width

476
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:53,190
will

477
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:55,090
adjust as well as height um you

478
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:56,899
can do that and adjust those if

479
00:12:56,899 --> 00:12:58,840
you want to adjust things where

480
00:12:58,909 --> 00:12:59,200
they're

481
00:12:59,259 --> 00:13:00,950
locked in proportion like say i

482
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:02,700
wanted to keep this exact shape

483
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:05,440
but i wanted to um increase it as

484
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:05,519
a

485
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:06,840
whole like maybe i wanted to

486
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,330
double it you can lock these two

487
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:09,919
together so you could lock this

488
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:10,240
and if i

489
00:13:10,299 --> 00:13:12,200
wanted to make this 400 the height

490
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,740
is going to move in proportion so

491
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,440
that's something cool that you can

492
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,190
do and then you can unlock it by

493
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:18,909
doing this so that's one thing

494
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,799
that you can do of course you can

495
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:21,000
change

496
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,779
colors here mess around with your

497
00:13:22,779 --> 00:13:24,330
colors you can even do some cool

498
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,320
stuff over here like if you add

499
00:13:26,379 --> 00:13:27,669
this section like a gradient you

500
00:13:27,669 --> 00:13:28,919
can make a gradient and you can

501
00:13:28,919 --> 00:13:30,320
mess around there i won't go too

502
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:30,769
much into

503
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:32,879
that stuff but there's gradients

504
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:34,740
there that you can do so that's

505
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:36,639
what you can do over here you have

506
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,240
things like you can add like a

507
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,929
stroke like you can add um like a

508
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,840
border to it for example so you

509
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,399
can see

510
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:43,940
here's like the color of your

511
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:45,289
border the opacity so how

512
00:13:45,289 --> 00:13:46,830
see-through you want it to be

513
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:47,600
that's what these

514
00:13:47,659 --> 00:13:49,100
percentages are um you can add

515
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,779
inside outside whatever you want

516
00:13:50,779 --> 00:13:52,320
you can change the width of it so

517
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:52,720
if i wanted

518
00:13:52,779 --> 00:13:54,220
it to be 20 then it's a a lot

519
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,720
thicker of a border so i'm just

520
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:58,559
going to undo that so let me undo

521
00:13:58,559 --> 00:13:59,710
that there we go

522
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,230
and then i just want to remove

523
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,559
this uh you can change all sorts

524
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:04,559
of different stuff with it you

525
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:05,120
have things like

526
00:14:05,179 --> 00:14:06,700
effects so you can add a shadow

527
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,210
you can add a layer blur so you

528
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:09,590
can see like the corner got

529
00:14:09,889 --> 00:14:10,320
layered you could

530
00:14:10,379 --> 00:14:11,519
add a background blur if you have

531
00:14:11,529 --> 00:14:12,610
a background you could add an

532
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:13,759
inner shadow so you can see on the

533
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:14,559
top there there's

534
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,019
like a little shadow and then say

535
00:14:16,029 --> 00:14:17,440
you do choose one of these let's

536
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,029
do an inner shadow you can adjust

537
00:14:19,029 --> 00:14:20,500
it even further

538
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:22,139
by clicking here and then changing

539
00:14:22,149 --> 00:14:23,360
like the coordinates of it

540
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,720
whatever you want to do a lot of

541
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,049
this stuff is

542
00:14:25,179 --> 00:14:26,730
advanced and you really won't

543
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,289
really use it um so let's just

544
00:14:28,289 --> 00:14:30,240
delete that you can do like layers

545
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:30,480
so if

546
00:14:30,539 --> 00:14:32,820
you want your layers to adjust in

547
00:14:32,889 --> 00:14:34,919
any sort of way you can do this

548
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:37,590
all this fancy stuff add different

549
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:38,299
filters

550
00:14:38,379 --> 00:14:40,139
but again like i rarely use that

551
00:14:40,139 --> 00:14:41,990
and i create emails all day every

552
00:14:42,029 --> 00:14:44,559
day so that's some stuff that you

553
00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:45,120
can

554
00:14:45,179 --> 00:14:46,750
do and then you have these layers

555
00:14:46,779 --> 00:14:48,330
so some stuff that you are going

556
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:50,090
to do however is you're going to

557
00:14:50,169 --> 00:14:50,399
like

558
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:52,080
group stuff and put them together

559
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,690
so one thing that you can do let's

560
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:55,200
say this is all going to be part

561
00:14:55,259 --> 00:14:56,809
of like a cohesive design we go

562
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:58,490
here change this and let's say we

563
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:00,320
wanted to group these together

564
00:15:00,379 --> 00:15:02,480
you can just click on both of them

565
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,720
just by holding down shift and you

566
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,639
can just left click and you can

567
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,629
group so a few different options

568
00:15:08,649 --> 00:15:10,490
here you can group them you can

569
00:15:10,529 --> 00:15:12,559
frame them so if we just click a

570
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:12,809
group

571
00:15:13,019 --> 00:15:14,870
then we have a group here and if

572
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:16,710
you down to this then they're

573
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,480
together and now it's together you

574
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,240
can also

575
00:15:20,299 --> 00:15:22,259
turn any group into what's called

576
00:15:22,259 --> 00:15:24,779
a frame so kind of frame is like a

577
00:15:25,009 --> 00:15:26,879
level up from a group so you can

578
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,919
have groups inside of frames so

579
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:30,870
that's kind of as far as it goes

580
00:15:31,019 --> 00:15:32,799
you frames then you add groups

581
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:33,039
then you

582
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,539
can add multiple different groups

583
00:15:34,539 --> 00:15:35,990
underneath them you can name this

584
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:39,440
group rectangles so

585
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,779
typically when we're talking about

586
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:44,279
email design we're going to be

587
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:46,899
using a frame as a singular design

588
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:48,240
so your designs are going to be

589
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,080
frames whereas you have

590
00:15:50,139 --> 00:15:52,240
groups within your frames so you

591
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,320
have groups within your emails

592
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,159
which is frame so let's just name

593
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:56,230
this

594
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:58,600
frame let's just say email number

595
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,590
one so we have an email here and

596
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:02,720
typically for your emails you want

597
00:16:02,779 --> 00:16:04,269
to be 600 width so i'm just going

598
00:16:04,269 --> 00:16:05,590
to change that and now this is our

599
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:08,279
frame so we are going to create a

600
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:08,720
frame

601
00:16:08,779 --> 00:16:11,389
let's make it 600 wide and then

602
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:14,139
let's make it like 800 tall now

603
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:17,250
this is our frame so some

604
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:17,679
different stuff

605
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:18,740
you can do with frame so we can

606
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:19,779
even i'm just going to remove

607
00:16:19,799 --> 00:16:20,970
these from the group and you'll

608
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:21,919
see it from

609
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,370
the frame and you can see that the

610
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:24,850
frame is now lonely so typically

611
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:26,389
like when you have your emails you

612
00:16:26,539 --> 00:16:27,690
want a specific background for

613
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:28,960
your emails so you can add a fill

614
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,100
to your frame and have this be

615
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:31,440
like the

616
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,409
background to your email so for

617
00:16:33,419 --> 00:16:35,269
example let's add like a logo

618
00:16:35,269 --> 00:16:37,360
section i'm going to create a new

619
00:16:37,419 --> 00:16:38,950
rectangle i'm going to put you

620
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,759
like this and then i'll adjust the

621
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:42,720
width to be 600 so it's the full

622
00:16:42,779 --> 00:16:44,769
width of the frame and then let's

623
00:16:44,769 --> 00:16:47,190
make you like 100 tall and then we

624
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:49,360
can just slide this in and adjust

625
00:16:49,419 --> 00:16:50,960
it and then now we have we can

626
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:52,649
just imagine this is a logo and

627
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,720
then right here we can name this

628
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,120
logo

629
00:16:55,179 --> 00:16:57,019
section and that right there is

630
00:16:57,019 --> 00:16:58,889
like a logo section so some cool

631
00:16:58,889 --> 00:17:01,120
stuff you can do there and of

632
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:01,289
course

633
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,330
you can add images in so let's say

634
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:05,009
for our email we wanted to add

635
00:17:05,009 --> 00:17:06,559
like a hero image all you have to

636
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:06,720
do

637
00:17:06,779 --> 00:17:08,630
to add any sort of image is you

638
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,720
can just go right up here to left

639
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:12,890
you can go to file and place image

640
00:17:13,078 --> 00:17:13,359
so

641
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:15,430
i'm just going to go place an

642
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:17,588
image oops okay so here we go i

643
00:17:17,588 --> 00:17:20,230
just grabbed an image just my logo

644
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:20,318
and

645
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:22,140
you can place your image wherever

646
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,960
so let's just place you right here

647
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,279
for now and it's going to change

648
00:17:25,338 --> 00:17:26,640
to the size it was thousand by a

649
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,119
thousand so here it is and then we

650
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:29,599
can adjust this so i have these

651
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:31,279
locked let's change it to like

652
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:33,230
five let's see if this is 600

653
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:34,910
width maybe we'll have this be

654
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:36,000
like 400

655
00:17:36,059 --> 00:17:38,079
width so it can take up this whole

656
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:40,170
section and then we can center it

657
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:42,000
here and then boom now we have an

658
00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:43,599
image but we want to make sure

659
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:45,289
that it's inside of the frame so

660
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:47,200
if it's ever not in the frame and

661
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:47,279
you

662
00:17:47,339 --> 00:17:49,740
want it to be you can just drag it

663
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:52,269
in and we'll go right here so boom

664
00:17:52,329 --> 00:17:54,720
now we have our main image

665
00:17:54,779 --> 00:17:56,630
and then boom now we have a full

666
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,720
frame and you can create groups

667
00:17:58,859 --> 00:18:00,640
within them so we also have this

668
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,440
text

669
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,910
text feature which of course you

670
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:06,269
can add text of any kind we could

671
00:18:06,279 --> 00:18:08,319
say this is a sub headline

672
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:10,920
and then just like it's a google

673
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,720
doc you have all your information

674
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,779
here so let's center it we can

675
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:16,079
make

676
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:18,420
this bigger we can go like 24 and

677
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:20,480
then we can bold it and then boom

678
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,480
we have a sub headline let's say

679
00:18:22,539 --> 00:18:24,390
we wanted to add body copy i'm

680
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,490
just going to copy and paste this

681
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:28,650
and then let's change you to like

682
00:18:28,839 --> 00:18:29,359
18

683
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:32,470
take you bolt take you off bold

684
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:35,529
and be like this is the body copy

685
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:38,410
of my email and what we can do

686
00:18:38,569 --> 00:18:38,799
within

687
00:18:38,859 --> 00:18:41,759
this so let's just extend this out

688
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:46,029
then center you then we have body

689
00:18:46,029 --> 00:18:49,039
copy here if you want to just

690
00:18:49,099 --> 00:18:50,619
for organizational purposes you

691
00:18:50,619 --> 00:18:52,130
could group these together even

692
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:54,549
further so click here shift boom

693
00:18:54,549 --> 00:18:54,599
and

694
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,549
then group and then we could say

695
00:18:56,549 --> 00:18:59,079
this is like a copy section wow i

696
00:18:59,079 --> 00:19:03,920
spelled that wrong and then boom

697
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,009
now you have

698
00:19:05,339 --> 00:19:07,460
this that's really the extent of

699
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:09,289
what you use in figma you use

700
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:11,599
shapes here and there you upload a

701
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:13,180
lot of images and you can organize

702
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:14,690
them within them and then you can

703
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:16,089
create all sorts of different

704
00:19:16,369 --> 00:19:16,799
emails

705
00:19:16,859 --> 00:19:18,880
so let's just copy and paste this

706
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,720
if we want to create another

707
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,309
you'll see another frame came out

708
00:19:22,309 --> 00:19:22,480
we

709
00:19:22,539 --> 00:19:24,569
can rename that email too oh i

710
00:19:24,569 --> 00:19:27,539
changed this one to email too let

711
00:19:27,539 --> 00:19:29,680
me undo that i want this one to be

712
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:31,359
email too if i change this name

713
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:33,150
it's going to go here and then now

714
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:34,640
we have two emails you can

715
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,039
collapse

716
00:19:35,099 --> 00:19:36,740
stuff as you go so i'm just going

717
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:38,450
to delete that and then boom now

718
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:40,400
you can see we have two frames for

719
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:42,599
emails here and here and that is

720
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:44,869
kind of the extent of what you use

721
00:19:44,869 --> 00:19:47,200
you have you can create frames up

722
00:19:47,259 --> 00:19:48,589
here you can create sections which

723
00:19:48,589 --> 00:19:49,869
are a little bit different but we

724
00:19:49,869 --> 00:19:51,359
don't even really use them but if

725
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:52,720
you ever want to create a frame

726
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,140
you can just create it just like

727
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:57,200
this and that is pretty much the

728
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:57,519
extent

729
00:19:57,579 --> 00:19:59,190
of what you want to do all sorts

730
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:00,809
of different stuff but this is

731
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,720
just very base what you want you

732
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:02,960
have

733
00:20:03,019 --> 00:20:04,470
all sorts of stuff that you can do

734
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:05,799
here you can view like this is

735
00:20:05,799 --> 00:20:07,279
just your edit properties if you

736
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:07,410
want

737
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,170
to add plugins these are plugins

738
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:10,839
that i use so these are like apps

739
00:20:10,839 --> 00:20:12,240
built on to figma so if you

740
00:20:12,299 --> 00:20:13,880
want to create gifts and whatnot

741
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:14,910
you can do that here um

742
00:20:15,009 --> 00:20:16,730
screenshots to designs whatever

743
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:17,039
you want

744
00:20:17,099 --> 00:20:18,190
to do and then there are widgets

745
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:19,250
which are which are also like

746
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:20,480
little tools that you can create

747
00:20:20,539 --> 00:20:22,390
you can do all sorts of different

748
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:24,470
stuff alignment but again i don't

749
00:20:24,619 --> 00:20:25,839
even really use those

750
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:28,009
so all sorts of different shapes

751
00:20:28,009 --> 00:20:29,839
that you can use uh the slice

752
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,279
feature is what we'll talk about

753
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:31,759
later

754
00:20:31,819 --> 00:20:33,509
this is helpful for so essentially

755
00:20:33,509 --> 00:20:35,200
what a slice does is you can slice

756
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,960
any anything you want

757
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:38,799
and essentially just be able to

758
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:40,500
export just a slice so if i did

759
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,009
that and i wanted to export

760
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:44,190
the slice the slice is just taking

761
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:46,160
that piece and then you can export

762
00:20:46,299 --> 00:20:47,920
the slice over here you can

763
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,279
export it however you want and

764
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:50,529
that's how we are going to be

765
00:20:50,529 --> 00:20:51,930
uploading emails but for now i'm

766
00:20:52,059 --> 00:20:52,390
just going

767
00:20:52,619 --> 00:20:54,900
to delete this slice let's see is

768
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:57,049
there anything else i'm missing

769
00:20:57,329 --> 00:20:59,230
not really you have a pen and

770
00:20:59,259 --> 00:20:59,920
pencil

771
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:01,480
if you want to use those uh if you

772
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,859
want to comment that's this

773
00:21:02,859 --> 00:21:04,319
comment feature you could be

774
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:07,980
hey max this is terrible um let me

775
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:11,130
just make sure it actually tags me

776
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:13,279
so i know that this is terrible

777
00:21:13,339 --> 00:21:14,960
and then boom you have comments

778
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,559
like this then you can resolve

779
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:17,869
comments say somebody leaves a

780
00:21:18,049 --> 00:21:18,160
comment

781
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:19,700
and it's resolved you just click

782
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:21,240
this check mark and it'll go away

783
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,180
of course you can share your file

784
00:21:23,259 --> 00:21:24,279
and all that good stuff with

785
00:21:24,279 --> 00:21:26,269
whoever you want um but that is

786
00:21:26,269 --> 00:21:29,200
pretty much the extent of what you

787
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:29,599
need

788
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:31,160
in figma the main stuff you're

789
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,880
going to be using is creating your

790
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:34,569
frames adding in shapes adding in

791
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:34,720
a

792
00:21:34,779 --> 00:21:36,410
ton of photos and all of that good

793
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:37,990
stuff you can even adjust your

794
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:39,599
photos however you want you can

795
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:42,099
change your photos um we don't

796
00:21:42,099 --> 00:21:44,700
need that let me undo what i just

797
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:47,359
did there we go um you can do

798
00:21:47,359 --> 00:21:47,740
whatever

799
00:21:47,819 --> 00:21:49,210
you want but again you really

800
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:50,759
don't really use any of this and

801
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:52,480
just like we could with frames you

802
00:21:52,529 --> 00:21:52,779
can add

803
00:21:52,859 --> 00:21:54,569
different strokes like if i wanted

804
00:21:54,569 --> 00:21:55,910
to add a border around this

805
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:58,799
picture i just added a border so

806
00:21:58,799 --> 00:21:58,970
highly

807
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:00,660
recommend you just mess around

808
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:02,269
with this and kind of experiment

809
00:22:02,269 --> 00:22:03,920
but this is just like the general

810
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:05,599
overview of figma and the main

811
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:07,490
features that you'll use and kind

812
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:09,119
of just inside my head as i'm

813
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:11,400
navigating figma i just wanted to

814
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,349
get you just a live video of me

815
00:22:13,349 --> 00:22:14,140
doing this
