1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,089
All righty.

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:04,160
So in this video, I'm going to be

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:05,879
showing you how to take your email

4
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:06,860
designs from

5
00:00:06,919 --> 00:00:09,140
Figma over to Klaviyo, exactly how

6
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:10,980
to upload them and how to make

7
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:13,019
sure that they're optimized so

8
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,230
that you're getting good

9
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:15,919
deliverability and everything is

10
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:17,260
all like squared away.

11
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:18,960
So this

12
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:20,140
is the email in question.

13
00:00:20,149 --> 00:00:20,960
Just an example.

14
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,179
I didn't put the footer in.

15
00:00:22,179 --> 00:00:23,219
We're going to do that

16
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,579
inside of Klaviyo, but typically

17
00:00:24,579 --> 00:00:25,750
you want to have your footer in

18
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:27,059
here as well, just so you can

19
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:27,870
reference it.

20
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:29,410
So this is our like fake email.

21
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:31,079
For example, imagine that this is

22
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:31,530
a logo.

23
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:31,969
You can

24
00:00:32,039 --> 00:00:33,299
see my layers over here.

25
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:34,799
It might be a little bit cut off

26
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:36,420
here on the side, but this is our

27
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:37,020
email.

28
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:39,500
So the thing with this is in your

29
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:42,149
slicing is for example, if I just

30
00:00:42,179 --> 00:00:44,439
uploaded, so essentially we're

31
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,789
exporting image files, we are

32
00:00:46,789 --> 00:00:49,500
exporting images rather than doing

33
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:50,130
HTML.

34
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:51,859
You really don't need

35
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:52,250
HTML.

36
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:53,460
In fact, it limits you.

37
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:54,869
And when you use HTML, that means

38
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:56,539
like sections built directly

39
00:00:56,539 --> 00:00:57,039
inside of

40
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,939
Klaviyo where it's showing up as

41
00:00:58,939 --> 00:01:00,990
native text inside of the

42
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,539
recipient's email inbox.

43
00:01:02,539 --> 00:01:04,640
So if somebody like

44
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:06,040
actually sent an email, that's

45
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,540
HTML because those are actually,

46
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:09,140
you can like highlight all of the

47
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:09,859
words there.

48
00:01:09,859 --> 00:01:11,329
So a lot of people will tell you,

49
00:01:11,329 --> 00:01:12,700
you need designs with HTML.

50
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:13,769
You don't, because there are

51
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,549
some things that you can overcome

52
00:01:15,549 --> 00:01:17,340
it inside of this video, inside of

53
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:18,900
this tutorial that I'm going to

54
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:19,340
show you.

55
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:20,719
But essentially we are just

56
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:22,280
exporting everything as image

57
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,349
files and we're uploading a bunch

58
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:24,519
of

59
00:01:24,579 --> 00:01:25,659
images into Klaviyo.

60
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:27,480
So the thing with that is we need

61
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,319
to make sure that our images are

62
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:30,280
also optimized.

63
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,120
And so they're not massive files.

64
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,519
Cause if you have a massive, like

65
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:35,079
two megabyte, three megabyte

66
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:36,659
photo in your email, that's going

67
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:38,079
to take a long time to load in the

68
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:39,120
customer's inbox.

69
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:39,980
And then also

70
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,560
it can be kind of spammy in the

71
00:01:41,569 --> 00:01:43,109
eyes of inbox providers.

72
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:45,200
If you're just attaching massive

73
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:45,640
files

74
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:46,670
to a ton of people.

75
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:48,269
So this is exactly what you want

76
00:01:48,269 --> 00:01:48,650
to do.

77
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:49,959
Um, again, you don't necessarily

78
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:50,359
need to

79
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:51,650
know all these reasons you could

80
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:52,879
just follow this guide and it's

81
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:54,040
going to give you everything that

82
00:01:54,099 --> 00:01:55,620
you need, but figured I'd let you

83
00:01:55,629 --> 00:01:56,120
know.

84
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,329
So essentially we're just

85
00:01:57,329 --> 00:01:58,599
exporting image files.

86
00:01:58,659 --> 00:01:59,939
So what we're going to do is

87
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:01,530
inside of figma, we have these

88
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:02,349
tools here.

89
00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:03,640
And what we want to do is we

90
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,010
want to use the slice tool.

91
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:06,599
So when you click the slice tool,

92
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:08,199
you're going to get this and you

93
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:08,439
just want

94
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,379
to highlight the different

95
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:10,300
sections of your email.

96
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,759
So since we're doing image files,

97
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:13,849
say, for example,

98
00:02:13,939 --> 00:02:15,969
we just wanted to slice this whole

99
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:18,169
entire thing and we have this full

100
00:02:18,169 --> 00:02:19,400
thing and we just wanted to

101
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:21,000
export this, go to export.

102
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:22,530
We wanted to export this.

103
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:25,080
The problem with that is that

104
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,680
there are different

105
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:27,879
products here and these need

106
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:28,729
different links.

107
00:02:28,729 --> 00:02:30,180
The logo section should just click

108
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,000
to the homepage.

109
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,629
Um,

110
00:02:31,699 --> 00:02:32,830
this product sections should link

111
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:33,810
to that specific product.

112
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:35,000
This product should link to that

113
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,479
specific

114
00:02:35,539 --> 00:02:35,900
product.

115
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,050
And if we just have one image, you

116
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:38,000
can only attach one link per

117
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,439
image.

118
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:39,319
So we need to separate

119
00:02:39,379 --> 00:02:39,759
them.

120
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:41,569
So instead of making this slice,

121
00:02:41,569 --> 00:02:43,360
we want to have a slice per link.

122
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:44,430
And then also we just want

123
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,819
to make sure that our slices

124
00:02:45,819 --> 00:02:46,719
aren't too big.

125
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:48,400
If you have a massive slice, your

126
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,240
file size is just going

127
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,120
to get big.

128
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,360
So I recommend having a maximum of

129
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:53,639
800 or so.

130
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:55,960
Um, even then that's a bit much,

131
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,759
maybe more like

132
00:02:56,819 --> 00:02:58,310
700 or 600.

133
00:02:58,310 --> 00:02:59,889
So our first slice that we're

134
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,710
going to do is we're just going to

135
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:03,000
do the logo because when

136
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:03,960
somebody clicks on the logo, we

137
00:03:04,099 --> 00:03:04,919
just want to take them to the main

138
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:05,479
home screen.

139
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:06,360
So here's what I always

140
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:07,060
recommend.

141
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,729
So you slice, we have this section

142
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:10,419
and it's going to capture that and

143
00:03:10,419 --> 00:03:11,719
let us export it.

144
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:13,539
I always export in two X because

145
00:03:13,539 --> 00:03:15,210
if you export in one X, if you

146
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:17,479
have like a high resolution photo,

147
00:03:17,539 --> 00:03:19,030
it's going to become grainy.

148
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,400
I like to always do two X and

149
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,879
change this to JPEG because it's a

150
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:22,280
slightly

151
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,129
smaller file.

152
00:03:23,129 --> 00:03:24,580
So we can export slice one.

153
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,139
We can just name it slice one.

154
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:27,240
You can name it logo,

155
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:27,960
whatever you want.

156
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,039
We are going to, it looks like we

157
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:29,759
already have that.

158
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:31,479
So we're going to say logo one

159
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:33,639
and then boom, we created that.

160
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,169
Now we can create another slice

161
00:03:35,229 --> 00:03:36,520
for this different section.

162
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:37,580
We're going to do this one.

163
00:03:37,669 --> 00:03:38,580
So I'm just going to copy and

164
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:39,400
paste this slice.

165
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:41,000
So now I have slice two and I'm

166
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:42,919
going to move it down to the edge

167
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:43,879
of this one.

168
00:03:43,939 --> 00:03:45,240
Let's make sure it's lined up.

169
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,400
There we go.

170
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,759
And then let's change the size to

171
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:49,639
go all the way down

172
00:03:49,699 --> 00:03:50,360
to here.

173
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,639
So we can do that.

174
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:53,960
We're going to export this second

175
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:57,680
slice and then we're all set

176
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:58,349
there.

177
00:03:58,419 --> 00:03:59,889
Now let's keep doing the same for

178
00:03:59,889 --> 00:04:01,240
the different sections.

179
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,759
Now I'm not going to have a 600

180
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:03,240
size here

181
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,650
because I want this section to be

182
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:06,250
linking directly to this product.

183
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,719
So I'm going to copy and paste

184
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:07,870
this

185
00:04:07,939 --> 00:04:10,349
slice again, move this one down,

186
00:04:10,349 --> 00:04:12,639
have it line up perfectly to this

187
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:13,240
one.

188
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,159
Let's see.

189
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:15,879
There we go.

190
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:19,040
Just like that.

191
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:20,819
And then we are going to have it

192
00:04:20,819 --> 00:04:21,959
end right here.

193
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:25,319
So we're slice three, slice three

194
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:26,439
test.

195
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,250
And then let's just do the same

196
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,300
for the other products, copy and

197
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,519
paste, line these up, move you

198
00:04:32,579 --> 00:04:37,149
here, export slice for test.

199
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,480
And then let's do the last one.

200
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,199
Move you here.

201
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:46,040
Get you right to the edge and then

202
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,220
right there.

203
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,579
Slice five test.

204
00:04:49,769 --> 00:04:50,350
Boom.

205
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:50,759
So now we have

206
00:04:50,819 --> 00:04:51,410
all our slices.

207
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:51,870
Awesome.

208
00:04:51,949 --> 00:04:53,730
Let's upload that in Klaviyo.

209
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:53,769
Not.

210
00:04:53,949 --> 00:04:56,670
So when you export like 2x, you're

211
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:56,839
going to

212
00:04:56,899 --> 00:04:58,129
have massive file sizes.

213
00:04:58,129 --> 00:04:59,360
So we need to use an outside

214
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,100
platform to compress our files for

215
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:01,399
us.

216
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:01,959
So I'm going

217
00:05:02,019 --> 00:05:03,800
to pull that up right now.

218
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,560
So this is a website called

219
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,000
iloveimg.com.

220
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,120
It's great for compressing

221
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:08,870
your images.

222
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:09,480
So we can go to

223
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,399
iloveimg.com/compress image.

224
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:12,920
And this is where you upload your

225
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,399
files and

226
00:05:13,459 --> 00:05:14,660
it'll automatically compress them.

227
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:15,699
So I'm going to upload these right

228
00:05:15,699 --> 00:05:16,040
now.

229
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,720
Alrighty.

230
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,610
There we go.

231
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:18,759
Here

232
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:20,360
are all the slices in their order.

233
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:21,750
And then just going to click

234
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:22,370
compress.

235
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:24,439
Then we'll see how much file

236
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,040
size we fit, we save.

237
00:05:26,149 --> 00:05:28,480
So the slices were three megabytes

238
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:30,199
before pretty much.

239
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:30,839
And then we lowered

240
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:32,600
it to 600 kilobytes, which is

241
00:05:32,709 --> 00:05:33,470
pretty awesome.

242
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:34,730
So I'm just going to download

243
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:35,100
this.

244
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:35,879
It's going to put

245
00:05:35,939 --> 00:05:37,750
it in a zip file and then we can

246
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:38,829
open it.

247
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:43,649
And then boom, we have this and

248
00:05:43,649 --> 00:05:45,639
now it's in there and we can

249
00:05:45,699 --> 00:05:46,839
upload that to Klaviyo.

250
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:47,990
So now I'm just going to go

251
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:50,269
straight to Klaviyo over here and

252
00:05:50,269 --> 00:05:51,480
you, maybe you're

253
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:52,740
familiar with Klaviyo, maybe you

254
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:53,910
aren't, but we're just going to

255
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:55,230
create like a fake campaign and

256
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:55,980
upload this.

257
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,149
So we're going to create a

258
00:05:57,149 --> 00:05:58,779
campaign, which is just one of our

259
00:05:58,779 --> 00:05:59,870
emails or emails.

260
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:00,040
Let's

261
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,610
go into the whole list.

262
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:03,600
Let's name this test for video,

263
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:04,370
the date.

264
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:05,319
That's fine.

265
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:06,920
We're just doing email,

266
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:09,129
continue, select your list

267
00:06:09,129 --> 00:06:10,360
newsletter.

268
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:13,089
Um, we can, you can do whatever

269
00:06:13,089 --> 00:06:14,680
you want with settings.

270
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,560
Um,

271
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:18,459
now let's go to content subject

272
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:21,670
line, SL preview text, PT, well,

273
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:22,839
copy, whatever you need to do.

274
00:06:22,899 --> 00:06:24,170
And we're just going to do a drag

275
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:25,529
and drop because we're dragging

276
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,670
our images in.

277
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:27,639
So we can just start

278
00:06:27,699 --> 00:06:28,879
blank or you can go off template,

279
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:29,680
whatever you want.

280
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,769
I'm just going to create a blank

281
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:31,319
email here.

282
00:06:31,379 --> 00:06:36,040
And it gave me this.

283
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,480
So cool.

284
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,759
Let's just delete this.

285
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:40,279
Let's delete this.

286
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:41,399
And then we already have a

287
00:06:41,459 --> 00:06:42,139
footer in for us.

288
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,370
Usually you're going to want to

289
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:44,410
create your own footer.

290
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:46,600
So now we literally just

291
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:48,560
want to upload our image files.

292
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,310
So I'm just going to drag image

293
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:53,879
here and then we can upload our

294
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:54,360
images.

295
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,110
So I'm just going to duplicate

296
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:56,579
this.

297
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,519
So we have, I believe it was five

298
00:06:58,519 --> 00:06:59,639
and I'm just going to go here

299
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:01,680
and I'm going to upload these

300
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,439
images.

301
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:03,540
So here we go.

302
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:05,589
Just going to go first to this

303
00:07:05,589 --> 00:07:07,000
logo file and then

304
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,889
boom, our logo comes in and then

305
00:07:09,889 --> 00:07:12,360
let's do the rest now.

306
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:17,160
And it should be, if you have just

307
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:17,779
the correct

308
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:19,750
widths should just be super

309
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,959
coherent and look exactly as it

310
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:23,480
was in your Figma.

311
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:28,100
Now, typically if you just sent

312
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,779
these, um, if you just sent like

313
00:07:30,819 --> 00:07:33,000
these images with no HTML,

314
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,189
then you could have some issues

315
00:07:34,189 --> 00:07:35,170
with deliverability.

316
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:36,540
If you're just sending just like a

317
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:37,319
ton of images,

318
00:07:37,379 --> 00:07:38,480
but I'm going to show you how to

319
00:07:38,509 --> 00:07:39,639
overcome that right now.

320
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:41,310
So we have, well, in just a

321
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:41,720
second.

322
00:07:41,779 --> 00:07:43,319
So here we are, here's our email.

323
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:44,610
We have our logo, this main

324
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:45,800
section, and then our different

325
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:47,269
sections here looks awesome.

326
00:07:47,269 --> 00:07:48,629
And then we have our footer.

327
00:07:48,629 --> 00:07:50,199
So now we want to put our links.

328
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:50,750
So let me

329
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:51,970
move you over here.

330
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:53,709
So you can see here there are alt

331
00:07:53,709 --> 00:07:54,180
text.

332
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,370
You can do alt text.

333
00:07:55,379 --> 00:07:56,199
If you want,

334
00:07:56,259 --> 00:07:57,519
you don't need to necessarily.

335
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:58,800
That's pretty much just going to

336
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,319
show up.

337
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:01,149
If somebody's browser isn't

338
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:02,680
showing the images, it'll show an

339
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,160
alternative text, like logo.

340
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,480
It'll just say like logo.

341
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,839
Um, but you can

342
00:08:06,899 --> 00:08:08,660
add your different links here to

343
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:09,970
each separate image.

344
00:08:10,029 --> 00:08:11,810
Um, so this would be like my main

345
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:12,439
site and this

346
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,220
would be like to the product in

347
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,129
the picture.

348
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,160
This would be to this product.

349
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,279
This link would be to this

350
00:08:18,339 --> 00:08:19,750
product and so on.

351
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,959
So now this gets to where we want

352
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:24,110
to overcome kind of the, we want

353
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:24,589
to add some

354
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:26,100
HTML to our email so that we are

355
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,540
showing inbox providers.

356
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:27,959
Okay.

357
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:29,480
There's actually text in this

358
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:29,939
email.

359
00:08:29,939 --> 00:08:31,420
It's a mix of text and images.

360
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,970
So we're not just like blasting a

361
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:34,429
ton of emails to people.

362
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,879
So we have our footer here.

363
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:37,129
We have social links.

364
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:37,879
And so we have that.

365
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:38,840
And then we have,

366
00:08:38,899 --> 00:08:40,129
this is actually HTML.

367
00:08:40,129 --> 00:08:41,610
This is what I mean by HTML.

368
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:43,460
It's custom text inside of the

369
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:44,200
platform.

370
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:44,519
And so

371
00:08:45,299 --> 00:08:46,490
kind of to improve our

372
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:48,480
deliverability to prove we're not

373
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,759
just doing a ton of images.

374
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:51,139
We're going

375
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:52,570
to add a bunch of HTML in our

376
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:53,149
footer.

377
00:08:53,149 --> 00:08:54,559
So all I'm going to do is I'm

378
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:55,789
going to drag this.

379
00:08:55,789 --> 00:08:56,110
I'm going

380
00:08:56,179 --> 00:08:57,720
to drag a new text box here and

381
00:08:57,809 --> 00:08:59,679
then we can add a bunch of text.

382
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:01,480
So I'm just going to go to my

383
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:01,960
website

384
00:09:02,019 --> 00:09:05,159
and take a bunch of text here.

385
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:07,179
Can I even copy and paste this?

386
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:07,799
Okay.

387
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:08,039
Let me,

388
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,639
I'm going to take this.

389
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,210
You can get a free guide if you go

390
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:12,759
to my site, but I'm just going to

391
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:13,960
take some copy.

392
00:09:15,299 --> 00:09:16,740
So I just got the copy from my

393
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:17,200
site.

394
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,840
I can delete this and then just

395
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,399
paste it.

396
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:21,429
And then boom, now I have a bunch

397
00:09:21,429 --> 00:09:23,240
of text, but this sucks.

398
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,279
This doesn't look good.

399
00:09:24,289 --> 00:09:25,299
And so what we can

400
00:09:25,379 --> 00:09:27,129
do is let's make this very small

401
00:09:27,129 --> 00:09:28,799
because nobody's going to be

402
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:29,769
reading this.

403
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:31,000
And I'll show you why

404
00:09:31,059 --> 00:09:32,830
we can make this like five where

405
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:34,009
it's super small.

406
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:36,120
Let's change the line spacing.

407
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,159
So it's like,

408
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,850
I don't know, 10, you can do that.

409
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:41,720
And then even further, we're going

410
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,059
to just change the text to be the

411
00:09:43,139 --> 00:09:44,110
exact same color as the

412
00:09:44,259 --> 00:09:44,820
background.

413
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,440
So we make it white and then boom,

414
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,019
look at that.

415
00:09:48,029 --> 00:09:48,919
Doesn't look

416
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:50,129
too much out of place.

417
00:09:50,129 --> 00:09:51,610
If we want to cut out some of the

418
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:53,480
copy, um, in this, we can let's

419
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,679
just delete.

420
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:56,179
Can't even see this, make it a

421
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:58,840
little bit smaller and then boom,

422
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,279
then that looks good.

423
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:01,600
And then we have

424
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,000
a ton of HTML.

425
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,509
This is like a whole essays worth

426
00:10:05,509 --> 00:10:07,370
and nobody can see it.

427
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:09,159
But in the eyes of the inbox

428
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:11,720
provider, it's a ton of HTML data.

429
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,990
And so that right there is going

430
00:10:14,019 --> 00:10:16,039
to overcome any of the issues

431
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:16,860
that we could have.

432
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,129
Uh, everything's just right here

433
00:10:18,179 --> 00:10:19,279
and we have this HTML and then

434
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:20,120
everything looks

435
00:10:20,179 --> 00:10:20,759
good.

436
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:21,320
Trust me.

437
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,909
I've sent thousands of emails.

438
00:10:22,909 --> 00:10:24,519
This has never been a problem.

439
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:26,279
So if anybody does try to

440
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:28,000
say it's a problem, they don't

441
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,009
know what they're talking about.

442
00:10:30,009 --> 00:10:32,279
Um, I consistently get 60% opens

443
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:32,720
by doing this.

444
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,669
And then you're all set.

445
00:10:34,669 --> 00:10:36,909
So it's always smart to preview

446
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:39,480
your email in your inbox so you

447
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,200
can preview

448
00:10:40,259 --> 00:10:41,610
it, whatever it is, uh, whatever

449
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:42,889
your email is, you'll send a test

450
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,200
email and then you can check

451
00:10:44,259 --> 00:10:45,490
the links, make sure everything is

452
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:45,779
good.

453
00:10:45,789 --> 00:10:46,750
Everything looks good.

454
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,440
And then you can go on to sending

455
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:48,759
the

456
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:49,120
email.

457
00:10:49,129 --> 00:10:50,200
So hopefully you found that

458
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,450
helpful and make sure you do that

459
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,159
and make sure you add some HTML

460
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,240
and you are good to go.

461
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,389
Alrighty.

462
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:58,659
So in this video, I'm going to be

463
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:00,360
showing you how to take your email

464
00:11:00,419 --> 00:11:02,169
designs from Figma over to

465
00:11:02,169 --> 00:11:04,370
Klaviyo, exactly how to upload

466
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:06,440
them and how to make sure that

467
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:06,759
they're

468
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,559
optimized so that you're getting

469
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:10,519
good deliverability and everything

470
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:12,120
is all like squared away.

471
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,480
So this is

472
00:11:13,539 --> 00:11:14,559
the email in question.

473
00:11:14,659 --> 00:11:15,419
Just an example.

474
00:11:15,419 --> 00:11:16,649
I didn't put the footer in.

475
00:11:16,669 --> 00:11:18,200
We're going to do that inside of

476
00:11:18,259 --> 00:11:19,580
Klaviyo, but typically you want to

477
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:20,889
have your footer in here as well,

478
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:22,360
just so you can reference it.

479
00:11:22,419 --> 00:11:24,169
So this is our like fake email.

480
00:11:24,169 --> 00:11:25,879
For example, imagine that this is

481
00:11:25,879 --> 00:11:26,279
a logo.

482
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:27,399
You can see my layers over

483
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:27,820
here.

484
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:29,350
It might be a little bit cut off

485
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:31,000
here on the side, but this is our

486
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:31,639
email.

487
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:33,799
So the thing with this

488
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:36,250
is in your slicing is for example,

489
00:11:36,309 --> 00:11:38,740
if I just uploaded, so essentially

490
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,279
we're exporting image

491
00:11:40,419 --> 00:11:41,149
files.

492
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:43,759
We are exporting images rather

493
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:45,399
than doing HTML.

494
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:46,759
You really don't need HTML.

495
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:47,240
In fact,

496
00:11:47,299 --> 00:11:48,029
it limits you.

497
00:11:48,029 --> 00:11:49,590
And when you use HTML, that means

498
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:51,080
like sections built directly

499
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:51,960
inside of Klaviyo,

500
00:11:52,019 --> 00:11:54,139
where it's showing up as native

501
00:11:54,139 --> 00:11:56,309
text inside of the recipient's

502
00:11:56,309 --> 00:11:57,480
email inbox.

503
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,080
So if somebody like

504
00:11:59,139 --> 00:12:00,490
actually sent an email, that's

505
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:02,200
HTML, because those are actually,

506
00:12:02,269 --> 00:12:03,559
you can like highlight all of the

507
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:04,289
words there.

508
00:12:04,289 --> 00:12:05,809
So a lot of people will tell you,

509
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:07,309
you need designs with HTML.

510
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,190
You don't, because there are

511
00:12:08,259 --> 00:12:09,970
some things that you can overcome

512
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:11,759
it inside of this video, inside of

513
00:12:11,789 --> 00:12:13,399
this tutorial that I'm going to

514
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:13,559
show

515
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:13,919
you.

516
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:15,309
But essentially we are just

517
00:12:15,309 --> 00:12:16,889
exporting everything as image

518
00:12:16,889 --> 00:12:18,279
files and we're uploading

519
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:20,279
a bunch of images into Klaviyo.

520
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:22,419
So the thing with that is we need

521
00:12:22,419 --> 00:12:23,799
to make sure that our images are

522
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:24,649
also optimized.

523
00:12:24,649 --> 00:12:26,169
And so they're not massive files,

524
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:27,639
because if you have a massive,

525
00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:28,840
like two megabyte,

526
00:12:28,899 --> 00:12:30,220
three megabyte photo in your

527
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,850
email, that's going to take a long

528
00:12:32,029 --> 00:12:33,240
time to load in the customer's

529
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:33,789
inbox.

530
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:35,610
And then also it can be kind of

531
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:37,269
spammy in the eyes of inbox

532
00:12:37,269 --> 00:12:39,320
providers if you're just attaching

533
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:39,799
massive

534
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,210
files to a ton of people.

535
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:42,889
So this is exactly what you want

536
00:12:42,909 --> 00:12:43,340
to do.

537
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:44,679
Again, you don't necessarily need

538
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:45,730
to know all these reasons.

539
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:46,899
You could just follow this guide

540
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:47,809
and it's going to give you

541
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:48,360
everything

542
00:12:48,419 --> 00:12:49,960
that you need, but figured I'd let

543
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:50,580
you know.

544
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:51,840
So essentially we're just

545
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,080
exporting image files.

546
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:54,419
So what we're going to do is

547
00:12:54,419 --> 00:12:56,029
inside of Figma, we have these

548
00:12:56,029 --> 00:12:56,759
tools here.

549
00:12:56,759 --> 00:12:58,120
And what we want to do is we

550
00:12:58,179 --> 00:12:59,480
want to use the slice tool.

551
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,059
So when you click the slice tool,

552
00:13:01,059 --> 00:13:02,679
you're going to get this and you

553
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:02,840
just

554
00:13:02,899 --> 00:13:04,330
want to highlight the different

555
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:05,529
sections of your email.

556
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,240
So since we're doing image files,

557
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,440
say for example,

558
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,990
we just wanted to slice this whole

559
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,629
entire thing and we have this full

560
00:13:12,629 --> 00:13:14,440
thing and we just wanted to export

561
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:14,919
this,

562
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:15,750
go to export.

563
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:17,250
We wanted to export this.

564
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:19,639
The problem with that is that

565
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:21,559
there are different products

566
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:22,669
here and these need different

567
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:23,080
links.

568
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,419
The logo section should just click

569
00:13:24,419 --> 00:13:25,230
to the homepage.

570
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:26,509
This

571
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:27,590
product section should link to

572
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:28,490
that specific product.

573
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:29,529
This product should link to that

574
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:30,279
specific product.

575
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,590
And if we just have one image, you

576
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:32,649
can only attach one link per

577
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:33,059
image.

578
00:13:33,059 --> 00:13:34,360
So we need to separate them.

579
00:13:34,419 --> 00:13:36,240
So instead of making this slice,

580
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,200
we want to have a slice per link.

581
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,080
And then also we just want to

582
00:13:39,139 --> 00:13:40,679
make sure that our slices aren't

583
00:13:40,789 --> 00:13:41,169
too big.

584
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:43,000
If you have a massive slice, your

585
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,960
file size is just going to get

586
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:44,360
big.

587
00:13:44,419 --> 00:13:46,669
So I recommend having a maximum of

588
00:13:46,669 --> 00:13:48,029
800 or so.

589
00:13:48,029 --> 00:13:50,759
Even then that's a bit much, maybe

590
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,399
more like 700 or 600.

591
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,169
So our first slice that we're

592
00:13:54,169 --> 00:13:56,100
going to do is we're just going to

593
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,799
do the logo because when somebody

594
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:58,789
clicks on the logo, we just want

595
00:13:58,799 --> 00:13:59,639
to take them to the main home

596
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:00,019
screen.

597
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:00,809
So here's what I always

598
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:01,559
recommend.

599
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:03,299
So you slice, we have this section

600
00:14:03,299 --> 00:14:04,980
and it's going to capture that and

601
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,200
let us export it.

602
00:14:06,259 --> 00:14:08,019
I always export in two X because

603
00:14:08,019 --> 00:14:09,700
if you export in one X, if you

604
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,960
have like a high resolution photo,

605
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:13,070
it's going to become grainy.

606
00:14:13,139 --> 00:14:14,889
I like to always do two X and

607
00:14:14,889 --> 00:14:16,440
change this to JPEG because it's a

608
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:16,759
slightly

609
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:17,870
smaller file.

610
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,230
So we can export slice one.

611
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:20,690
We can just name it slice one.

612
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:21,799
You can name it logo,

613
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:22,440
whatever you want.

614
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,580
We are going to, it looks like we

615
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:24,440
already have that.

616
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,960
So we're going to say logo one

617
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:28,120
and then boom, we created that.

618
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,529
Now we can create another slice

619
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,080
for this different section.

620
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:31,240
We're

621
00:14:31,299 --> 00:14:32,049
going to do this one.

622
00:14:32,049 --> 00:14:33,019
So I'm just going to copy and

623
00:14:33,019 --> 00:14:33,879
paste this slice.

624
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:35,480
So now I have slice two and I'm

625
00:14:35,539 --> 00:14:37,220
going to move it down to the edge

626
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:38,019
of this one.

627
00:14:38,019 --> 00:14:40,230
Let's make sure it's lined up.

628
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:41,879
There we go.

629
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:42,120
And

630
00:14:42,179 --> 00:14:43,600
then let's change the size to go

631
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,759
all the way down to here.

632
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:45,750
So we can do that.

633
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,000
We're going to export

634
00:14:47,059 --> 00:14:50,200
this second slice and then we're

635
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,509
all set there.

636
00:14:51,509 --> 00:14:53,919
Now let's keep doing the same for

637
00:14:54,169 --> 00:14:55,320
the different

638
00:14:55,379 --> 00:14:55,899
sections.

639
00:14:55,899 --> 00:14:57,409
Now I'm not going to have a 600

640
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:58,730
size here because I want this

641
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:00,269
section to be linking directly

642
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:01,169
to this product.

643
00:15:01,169 --> 00:15:02,500
So I'm going to copy and paste

644
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,169
this slice again, move this one

645
00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:04,440
down.

646
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:07,240
have it line up perfectly to this

647
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:07,929
one.

648
00:15:07,929 --> 00:15:09,100
Let's see.

649
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,440
There we go.

650
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,159
Just like that.

651
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:15,019
And then we are going to have it

652
00:15:15,029 --> 00:15:16,750
end right here.

653
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:20,090
Let's go slice three, slice three

654
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:20,990
test.

655
00:15:21,059 --> 00:15:22,850
And then let's just do the same

656
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:24,470
for the other products.

657
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:26,409
Copy and paste, line these up,

658
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:27,080
move you

659
00:15:27,139 --> 00:15:30,559
here, export slice four test.

660
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:33,960
And then let's do the last one.

661
00:15:35,539 --> 00:15:38,379
Move you here, get you right to

662
00:15:38,379 --> 00:15:39,559
the edge.

663
00:15:39,559 --> 00:15:43,210
And then right there, slice five

664
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:44,440
test.

665
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:44,759
Boom.

666
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:46,039
So now we have all our slices.

667
00:15:46,149 --> 00:15:46,440
Awesome.

668
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,039
Let's upload that in Klaviyo.

669
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:48,779
Not.

670
00:15:48,779 --> 00:15:51,159
So when you export like two X,

671
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:52,080
you're going to have massive file

672
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:52,440
sizes.

673
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,320
So we need to use an

674
00:15:53,379 --> 00:15:55,100
outside platform to compress our

675
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:55,960
files for us.

676
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,070
So I'm going to pull that up right

677
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:57,399
now.

678
00:15:58,659 --> 00:16:00,200
So this is a website called

679
00:16:00,309 --> 00:16:01,559
iloveimg.com.

680
00:16:01,559 --> 00:16:02,720
It's great for compressing your

681
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,159
images.

682
00:16:03,159 --> 00:16:03,720
So

683
00:16:03,779 --> 00:16:05,120
we can go to iloveimg.com slash

684
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:05,940
compress image.

685
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,470
And this is where you upload your

686
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:08,120
files and it'll

687
00:16:08,179 --> 00:16:09,240
automatically compress them.

688
00:16:09,299 --> 00:16:10,299
So I'm going to upload these right

689
00:16:10,299 --> 00:16:10,600
now.

690
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,070
Alrighty, there we go.

691
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:14,389
Here are all the slices in their

692
00:16:14,389 --> 00:16:14,779
order.

693
00:16:14,789 --> 00:16:16,090
And then I'm just going to click

694
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:16,750
compress.

695
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:17,710
Then we'll see

696
00:16:17,779 --> 00:16:20,039
how much file size we fit, we

697
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:20,730
save.

698
00:16:20,909 --> 00:16:23,759
So the slices were three megabytes

699
00:16:23,769 --> 00:16:24,720
before pretty much.

700
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,080
And then

701
00:16:25,139 --> 00:16:27,059
we lowered it to 600 kilobytes,

702
00:16:27,059 --> 00:16:28,440
which is pretty awesome.

703
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,799
So I'm just going to download

704
00:16:29,799 --> 00:16:30,039
this.

705
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,639
It's going to put it in a zip file

706
00:16:31,639 --> 00:16:32,840
and then we can open it.

707
00:16:32,919 --> 00:16:38,950
And then boom, we have this and

708
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:40,129
now it's in there and we can

709
00:16:40,129 --> 00:16:41,190
upload that to Klaviyo.

710
00:16:41,299 --> 00:16:42,289
So now I'm just going to go

711
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:44,360
straight to Klaviyo over here and

712
00:16:44,429 --> 00:16:46,519
you, maybe you're familiar with

713
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:46,960
Klaviyo.

714
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,120
Maybe you aren't, but we're just

715
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:49,169
going to create like a fake

716
00:16:49,179 --> 00:16:50,600
campaign and upload this.

717
00:16:50,659 --> 00:16:51,879
So we're going to create a

718
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:53,610
campaign, which is just one of our

719
00:16:53,799 --> 00:16:54,440
emails or emails.

720
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,080
Let's go into the

721
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:56,179
whole list.

722
00:16:56,269 --> 00:16:58,730
Let's name this test for video the

723
00:16:58,730 --> 00:16:59,220
date.

724
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,129
That's fine.

725
00:17:00,129 --> 00:17:01,480
We're just doing email,

726
00:17:01,539 --> 00:17:03,690
continue, select your list

727
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:04,920
newsletter.

728
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:08,279
Um, we can, you can do whatever

729
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:09,640
you want with settings.

730
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,078
Um, now let's go to content

731
00:17:11,078 --> 00:17:15,950
subject line, SL preview text, PT,

732
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:17,078
well, copy, whatever you need to

733
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:17,400
do.

734
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:18,869
Then we're just going to do a drag

735
00:17:18,869 --> 00:17:20,338
and drop because we're dragging

736
00:17:20,338 --> 00:17:21,230
our images in.

737
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:22,200
So we can just start

738
00:17:22,259 --> 00:17:23,440
blank or you can go off template,

739
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,240
whatever you want.

740
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,328
I'm just going to create a blank

741
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:25,880
email here.

742
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:30,519
And it gave me this.

743
00:17:30,519 --> 00:17:31,289
So cool.

744
00:17:31,349 --> 00:17:33,210
Let's just delete this.

745
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:34,819
Let's delete this.

746
00:17:34,839 --> 00:17:35,839
And then we already have a

747
00:17:36,019 --> 00:17:36,630
footer in for us.

748
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:37,730
Usually you're going to want to

749
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:38,759
create your own footer.

750
00:17:38,759 --> 00:17:41,160
So now we literally just

751
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:43,119
want to upload our image files.

752
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:44,869
So I'm just going to drag image

753
00:17:44,869 --> 00:17:47,769
here and then we can upload our

754
00:17:47,769 --> 00:17:48,920
images.

755
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:50,670
So I'm just going to duplicate

756
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:51,140
this.

757
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,079
So we have, I believe it was five

758
00:17:53,079 --> 00:17:54,200
and I'm just going to go here

759
00:17:54,259 --> 00:17:55,440
and I'm going to upload these

760
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:55,960
images.

761
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,400
So here we go.

762
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,079
Just going to go first to this

763
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,559
logo file and then

764
00:18:01,619 --> 00:18:04,180
boom, our logo comes in and then

765
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:06,190
let's do the rest now.

766
00:18:06,259 --> 00:18:10,690
And it should be, if you have just

767
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:14,039
the correct widths should just be

768
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:15,619
super coherent and look

769
00:18:15,779 --> 00:18:18,039
exactly as it was in your Figma.

770
00:18:18,039 --> 00:18:22,339
Now, typically if you just sent

771
00:18:22,339 --> 00:18:25,640
these, um, if you just sent like

772
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:25,960
these

773
00:18:26,019 --> 00:18:27,380
images with no HTML, then you

774
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:28,650
could have some issues with

775
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,200
deliverability if you're just

776
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:30,680
sending

777
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:32,079
just like a ton of images, but I'm

778
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:33,319
going to show you how to overcome

779
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,200
that right now.

780
00:18:34,259 --> 00:18:35,720
So we have, well, in just a

781
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,279
second.

782
00:18:36,349 --> 00:18:37,880
So here we are, here's our email.

783
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,839
We have our logo,

784
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,200
this main section, and then our

785
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,490
different sections here looks

786
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:41,849
awesome.

787
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:42,920
And then we have our footer.

788
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:45,180
So now we want to put our links.

789
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:47,210
So let me move you over here.

790
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:48,680
So you can see here there are alt

791
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,079
text.

792
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:50,099
You can do alt text.

793
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:51,660
If you want, you don't need to

794
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:52,599
necessarily.

795
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:53,559
That's pretty much just going to

796
00:18:53,559 --> 00:18:53,710
show

797
00:18:53,779 --> 00:18:53,990
up.

798
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:55,299
If somebody's browser isn't

799
00:18:55,299 --> 00:18:56,869
showing the images, it'll show an

800
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:58,759
alternative text, like logo.

801
00:18:58,819 --> 00:19:00,299
It'll just say like logo.

802
00:19:00,299 --> 00:19:02,250
Um, but you can add your different

803
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,519
links here to each separate image.

804
00:19:04,579 --> 00:19:06,119
Um, so this would be like my main

805
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:07,759
site and this would be like to the

806
00:19:07,759 --> 00:19:09,000
product in the picture.

807
00:19:09,059 --> 00:19:11,039
This would be to this product.

808
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:13,200
This link would be to this product

809
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,039
and so on.

810
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:15,920
So now this gets to

811
00:19:16,019 --> 00:19:18,140
where we want to overcome kind of

812
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:20,220
the, we want to add some HTML to

813
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:22,119
our email so that we are showing

814
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:22,890
inbox providers.

815
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:23,200
Okay.

816
00:19:23,299 --> 00:19:24,339
There's actually text in this

817
00:19:24,339 --> 00:19:24,700
email.

818
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:25,869
It's a mix of text and images.

819
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,279
So we're not

820
00:19:26,339 --> 00:19:28,089
just like blasting a ton of emails

821
00:19:28,089 --> 00:19:28,799
to people.

822
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:30,349
So we have our footer here.

823
00:19:30,349 --> 00:19:31,750
We have social links.

824
00:19:31,769 --> 00:19:31,960
And so

825
00:19:32,019 --> 00:19:32,700
we have that.

826
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,329
And then we have, this is actually

827
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:34,750
HTML.

828
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,109
This is what I mean by HTML.

829
00:19:36,109 --> 00:19:37,319
It's custom text

830
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:38,430
inside of the platform.

831
00:19:38,509 --> 00:19:41,420
And so kind of to improve our

832
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:43,160
deliverability, to prove we're not

833
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:43,630
just doing

834
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,240
a ton of images.

835
00:19:45,349 --> 00:19:46,960
We're going to add a bunch of HTML

836
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,880
in our footer.

837
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,240
So all I'm going to do is I'm

838
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:49,480
going to

839
00:19:49,539 --> 00:19:51,450
drag this, I'm going to drag a new

840
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:53,410
text box here, and then we can add

841
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:54,599
a bunch of text.

842
00:19:54,599 --> 00:19:55,240
So I'm just

843
00:19:55,299 --> 00:19:57,710
going to go to my website and take

844
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:59,450
a bunch of text here.

845
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:02,039
Can I even copy and paste this?

846
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:02,240
Okay.

847
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:02,599
Let me,

848
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,109
I'm going to take this.

849
00:20:04,109 --> 00:20:05,940
You can get a free guide if you go

850
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,319
to my site, but I'm just going to

851
00:20:07,319 --> 00:20:08,200
take some

852
00:20:08,259 --> 00:20:08,599
copy.

853
00:20:08,599 --> 00:20:10,569
So I just got the copy from my

854
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:11,200
site.

855
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,359
I can delete this and then just

856
00:20:13,369 --> 00:20:13,960
paste it.

857
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,299
And then boom, now I have a bunch

858
00:20:16,299 --> 00:20:17,529
of text, but this sucks.

859
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:18,839
This doesn't look good.

860
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:19,400
And so what

861
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:21,250
we can do is let's make this very

862
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,329
small because nobody's going to be

863
00:20:23,329 --> 00:20:24,440
reading this.

864
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:24,759
And I'll show

865
00:20:24,819 --> 00:20:26,799
you why we can make this like five

866
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:28,470
where it's super small.

867
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:30,660
Let's change the line spacing.

868
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,720
So it's like,

869
00:20:31,779 --> 00:20:34,359
I don't know, 10 can do that.

870
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:36,099
And then even further, we're going

871
00:20:36,099 --> 00:20:37,559
to just change the text to be the

872
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:37,880
exact

873
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:39,480
same color as the background.

874
00:20:39,589 --> 00:20:41,329
So we make it white and then boom,

875
00:20:41,329 --> 00:20:42,279
look at that.

876
00:20:42,279 --> 00:20:43,779
Doesn't look too much

877
00:20:43,859 --> 00:20:44,579
out of place.

878
00:20:44,579 --> 00:20:46,079
If we want to cut out some of the

879
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:47,880
copy, um, in this, we can, let's

880
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:48,680
just delete.

881
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,480
Can't

882
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:51,569
even see this, make it a little

883
00:20:51,619 --> 00:20:53,849
bit smaller and then boom, then

884
00:20:53,849 --> 00:20:55,180
that looks good.

885
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:56,680
And then we have a ton

886
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:57,500
of HTML.

887
00:20:57,859 --> 00:21:00,000
This is like a whole essays worth

888
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,859
and nobody can see it.

889
00:21:01,859 --> 00:21:03,599
But in the eyes of the inbox

890
00:21:03,779 --> 00:21:06,369
provider, it's a ton of HTML data.

891
00:21:06,369 --> 00:21:08,599
And so that right there is going

892
00:21:08,609 --> 00:21:10,599
to overcome any of the issues

893
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:11,420
that we could have.

894
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:12,690
Uh, everything's just right here

895
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:13,839
and we have this HTML and then

896
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:14,680
everything looks

897
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:15,089
good.

898
00:21:15,089 --> 00:21:15,700
Trust me.

899
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,369
I've sent thousands of emails.

900
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,079
This has never been a problem.

901
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:20,839
So if anybody does try to

902
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,559
say it's a problem, they don't

903
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,569
know what they're talking about.

904
00:21:24,569 --> 00:21:26,839
Um, I consistently get 60% opens

905
00:21:26,839 --> 00:21:27,000
by

906
00:21:27,059 --> 00:21:29,009
doing this and then you're all

907
00:21:29,009 --> 00:21:29,490
set.

908
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:31,589
So it's always smart to preview

909
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:33,400
your email in your inbox.

910
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:33,920
So you

911
00:21:34,019 --> 00:21:35,400
can preview it, whatever it is,

912
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,970
uh, whatever your email is, you'll

913
00:21:37,049 --> 00:21:38,519
send a test email and then you can

914
00:21:38,579 --> 00:21:39,500
check the links and make sure

915
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:40,279
everything is good.

916
00:21:40,279 --> 00:21:41,190
Everything looks good.

917
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,440
And then you can go on to

918
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,430
sending the email.

919
00:21:43,539 --> 00:21:44,730
So hopefully you found that

920
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:46,190
helpful and make sure you do that

921
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:46,519
and make sure

922
00:21:46,579 --> 00:21:48,519
you add some HTML and you are good

923
00:21:48,519 --> 00:21:49,079
to go.
