1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,690
Okay, so we are talking about copy

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:04,290
here and we're talking about core

3
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:05,429
copy principle number

4
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:07,389
one, which first principle in my

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,320
eyes is skimmable, which we are

6
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:11,029
going to be talking about right

7
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:11,980
here.

8
00:00:12,099 --> 00:00:13,550
So SCE, these are kind of the

9
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:15,130
three main pillars, the copy

10
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:16,839
principles that we like to follow

11
00:00:17,019 --> 00:00:18,559
at my agency, which has served us

12
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:20,329
pretty well, which are skimmable,

13
00:00:20,329 --> 00:00:21,679
clear and concise, and

14
00:00:21,739 --> 00:00:22,620
then engaging.

15
00:00:22,739 --> 00:00:24,140
So first one is what we're talking

16
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:25,429
about in this video, which is

17
00:00:25,429 --> 00:00:26,640
skimmable, which is the

18
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:28,940
ease at which someone can briefly,

19
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:30,780
briefly skim your email.

20
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:32,200
So let's talk about it.

21
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:33,439
Time is money.

22
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,100
The customer is not sitting down

23
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,729
every morning and reading their

24
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:38,079
emails in depth like they

25
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,939
would like the morning newspaper.

26
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,520
It's just not what the modern

27
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,969
customer is doing today,

28
00:00:42,969 --> 00:00:44,979
especially since most of the sales

29
00:00:44,979 --> 00:00:45,210
that

30
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,869
are coming are going to be people

31
00:00:46,869 --> 00:00:48,509
under the age of 50 and those

32
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:50,020
people aren't really reading

33
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,250
the newspaper and have the

34
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:52,609
attention spans like some other

35
00:00:52,609 --> 00:00:53,979
older demographics would.

36
00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:55,729
So we really only have a couple of

37
00:00:55,729 --> 00:00:57,159
seconds of our customer's

38
00:00:57,159 --> 00:00:58,000
attention.

39
00:00:58,060 --> 00:00:59,840
Everybody, they're just quickly

40
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,570
opening their email and briefly

41
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:02,740
going through it.

42
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:04,069
So we need to understand that if

43
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:05,500
people cannot skim your email,

44
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,819
they're not going to bother

45
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:07,260
reading it.

46
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:09,049
So we need to optimize for the

47
00:01:09,049 --> 00:01:10,569
skim and not the read.

48
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,180
Very, very important.

49
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:13,400
So how do we do that?

50
00:01:13,459 --> 00:01:14,299
There are a couple main things

51
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:14,959
that we want to do.

52
00:01:15,019 --> 00:01:17,560
First is we want to avoid blocks

53
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,439
of text.

54
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,299
Blocks of text just scare people

55
00:01:20,299 --> 00:01:20,760
off.

56
00:01:20,819 --> 00:01:21,620
They are terrified.

57
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,310
Inside it is the modern customer's

58
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:25,000
kryptonite is blocks of text.

59
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:26,599
So it's very difficult for the

60
00:01:26,599 --> 00:01:28,340
eyes to like make out and process

61
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:29,560
blocks of text when we

62
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:30,930
only have a couple seconds of the

63
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:31,739
person's time.

64
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:33,250
So this just results in people

65
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:34,939
skipping past any type of block of

66
00:01:34,939 --> 00:01:35,859
information.

67
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,609
So we really want to shorten our

68
00:01:37,609 --> 00:01:39,200
copy or split it up in our text

69
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:40,819
with like line breaks in

70
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:41,920
different forms of graphics.

71
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:43,450
So when you're outlining your

72
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:45,109
emails like as far as like copy,

73
00:01:45,109 --> 00:01:46,480
you really want to make sure

74
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:47,469
that you're splitting things up

75
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:48,140
for the designer.

76
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,019
So here are like two examples.

77
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:52,239
These could have been put in like

78
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:53,500
blocks of text.

79
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:54,799
But look, they're listed out.

80
00:01:54,859 --> 00:01:56,079
One, two, three, four, five.

81
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,920
You can easily skim this.

82
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:00,219
Five ways nature supports mental

83
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:01,140
health.

84
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,239
Reduces the stress.

85
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:03,939
That's bolded.

86
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,879
Improves mood.

87
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,680
That's bolded.

88
00:02:05,739 --> 00:02:06,799
Improve attention and memory.

89
00:02:06,859 --> 00:02:07,500
That's bolded.

90
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,740
And you can see it's just not

91
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:09,500
blocked out.

92
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:11,330
It's just clear, easy to just for

93
00:02:11,379 --> 00:02:12,580
your eyes to follow.

94
00:02:12,659 --> 00:02:13,909
Same thing as right here.

95
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,419
Easy for the eyes to follow.

96
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:16,919
We're not using blocks of text.

97
00:02:16,979 --> 00:02:18,669
We are just separating things out

98
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,509
into like our different points and

99
00:02:20,509 --> 00:02:21,659
then bolding like the

100
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:23,210
main stuff or putting it up clear

101
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:24,699
up top so that if somebody wants

102
00:02:24,699 --> 00:02:26,159
more information, they

103
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:26,939
can read down here.

104
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,060
But if they just want to skim,

105
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:28,979
they can look at this.

106
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:30,669
So avoid blocks of text.

107
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,340
That's the real main first thing

108
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,479
that you want to do.

109
00:02:33,539 --> 00:02:34,889
The other thing that you want to

110
00:02:34,889 --> 00:02:36,310
do is you want to bold all of your

111
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:37,050
main points.

112
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,389
Most of your audience will not

113
00:02:39,389 --> 00:02:40,949
read any of your copy, but they

114
00:02:40,949 --> 00:02:42,250
will read the bolded main

115
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:43,349
points as they're skimming your

116
00:02:43,349 --> 00:02:43,719
email.

117
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,210
So use body copy to support your

118
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:46,530
main points, kind of like I

119
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:47,710
mentioned before.

120
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:48,900
Some people might read it.

121
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,120
People might do that.

122
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:51,729
But other people are just going to

123
00:02:51,729 --> 00:02:52,969
read the main points.

124
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:54,560
And I mean, look at what I've done

125
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,110
with this guide and all the other

126
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:57,409
guides in these modules.

127
00:02:57,479 --> 00:02:59,009
I put, if you want to read all

128
00:02:59,009 --> 00:03:00,419
this stuff, you can.

129
00:03:00,449 --> 00:03:01,210
I've attached the links to

130
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:01,719
everything.

131
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:02,900
But really what we're doing is

132
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,340
we're highlighting the main points

133
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:05,740
so people can get the gist of it

134
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,759
if they just want to skim it.

135
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:09,080
So a really good example is this

136
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,860
guide and what I'm doing here.

137
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:12,289
The main points allow the readers

138
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,479
to get the full picture.

139
00:03:13,539 --> 00:03:15,169
Then the body copy is used for the

140
00:03:15,169 --> 00:03:16,960
further justification and proof

141
00:03:17,009 --> 00:03:18,259
you have about that.

142
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:19,949
So right here, here's an example.

143
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:21,479
Accept the seasons of life.

144
00:03:21,539 --> 00:03:23,080
Relationships are rarely 50-50.

145
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:24,340
Striving for your goals is

146
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,159
underrated.

147
00:03:25,219 --> 00:03:27,020
And remember, you always have

148
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:27,780
choices.

149
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,949
And so you can see justification

150
00:03:29,949 --> 00:03:32,110
in backing the information up is

151
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:33,199
in this text.

152
00:03:33,259 --> 00:03:35,740
And you can read more if you want.

153
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,599
These are like kind of blocks of

154
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,449
text, but not like too big.

155
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,490
This is like kind of the situation

156
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:43,530
where you can sometimes have like

157
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:45,270
quick blocks of text for different

158
00:03:45,409 --> 00:03:45,639
points.

159
00:03:45,699 --> 00:03:47,199
But as long as you bold like your

160
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:48,699
main points, then people can

161
00:03:48,699 --> 00:03:49,759
easily skim that.

162
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,759
Here's a good example number two,

163
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:52,889
comparing others versus your

164
00:03:52,889 --> 00:03:53,340
brand.

165
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:56,159
Rather than have everything just

166
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:57,830
in like single points without

167
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:00,060
bolding the top, you have or that

168
00:04:00,229 --> 00:04:02,340
would be tough to read.

169
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,960
But instead, we bold just the main

170
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,500
points.

171
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,180
And if people want to have further

172
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,699
information on that specific

173
00:04:07,699 --> 00:04:09,039
point, then they can.

174
00:04:09,099 --> 00:04:10,370
Empty monthly versus daily.

175
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,599
If you want to read more and say

176
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:14,599
at any time empty after dozens of

177
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:16,009
cycles, perfect.

178
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,199
Then you have that information.

179
00:04:17,259 --> 00:04:18,879
But you can just easily see all

180
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:20,339
the main points here.

181
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,449
That's one of the other keys.

182
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:24,139
And then also, just keep it short.

183
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:25,759
We'll touch on this in all of our

184
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,620
principles, but we really want our

185
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:28,759
copy to be short.

186
00:04:28,819 --> 00:04:30,370
The shorter it is, the more

187
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:31,500
skimmable it is.

188
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,750
If there's a lot of stuff, you're

189
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,060
not going to be able to skim it.

190
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,379
So that's very, very, very

191
00:04:35,379 --> 00:04:36,120
important.

192
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,540
And these are just kind of the

193
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,240
three main things to make our copy

194
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,040
skimmable.

195
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,139
And we're going to be talking a

196
00:04:41,139 --> 00:04:42,199
lot about this and then using

197
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:42,920
infographics.

198
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,449
That's kind of like the main thing

199
00:04:44,449 --> 00:04:46,089
I'm trying to tell, trying to say

200
00:04:46,089 --> 00:04:48,019
like with these copy modules is

201
00:04:48,019 --> 00:04:49,759
don't focus less on the copy and

202
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:51,540
focus more on infographics like

203
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:52,029
this.

204
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:54,050
So avoid blocks of text, highlight

205
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:55,860
your main points, and keep your

206
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,209
copy nice and short.

207
00:04:57,279 --> 00:04:58,550
We only have a couple seconds of

208
00:04:58,579 --> 00:05:00,040
our customer's attention, so we

209
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,560
have to be really intentional with

210
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,019
what copy that we are using.

211
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:05,829
Okay, so we are talking about copy

212
00:05:05,829 --> 00:05:06,560
here.

213
00:05:06,699 --> 00:05:08,490
And we're talking about core copy

214
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:10,480
principle number one, which first

215
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,439
principle in my eyes is skimmable,

216
00:05:12,589 --> 00:05:13,790
which we are going to be talking

217
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:14,709
about right here.

218
00:05:14,819 --> 00:05:16,240
So SCE, these are kind of the

219
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,800
three main pillars, the copy

220
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,550
principles that we like to follow

221
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:21,279
at my agency, which has served us

222
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:23,470
pretty well, which are skimmable,

223
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:25,050
clear and concise, and then

224
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:25,829
engaging.

225
00:05:25,899 --> 00:05:27,649
So first one is what we're talking

226
00:05:27,649 --> 00:05:29,259
about in this video, which is

227
00:05:29,259 --> 00:05:31,000
skimmable, which is the ease at

228
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,009
which someone can briefly, briefly

229
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:34,199
skim your email.

230
00:05:34,519 --> 00:05:35,600
So let's talk about it.

231
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:36,860
Time is money.

232
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,490
The customer is not sitting down

233
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:40,110
every morning and reading their

234
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:41,660
emails in depth like they would

235
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:43,290
like the morning newspaper.

236
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:44,860
It's just not what the modern

237
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:46,220
customer is doing today,

238
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,000
especially since most of the sales

239
00:05:48,069 --> 00:05:49,579
that are coming are going to be

240
00:05:49,579 --> 00:05:51,420
people under the age of 50,

241
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,069
and those people aren't really

242
00:05:53,069 --> 00:05:54,610
reading the newspaper and have the

243
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:56,029
attention spans like some other

244
00:05:56,029 --> 00:05:57,410
older demographics would.

245
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,170
So we really only have a couple of

246
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:00,589
seconds of our customer's

247
00:06:00,589 --> 00:06:01,399
attention.

248
00:06:01,459 --> 00:06:03,269
Everybody, they're just quickly

249
00:06:03,269 --> 00:06:05,000
opening their email and briefly

250
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,160
going through it.

251
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:07,100
So we need to understand that.

252
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:08,720
If people cannot skim your email,

253
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,980
they're not going to bother

254
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:10,720
reading it.

255
00:06:10,819 --> 00:06:12,449
So we need to optimize for the

256
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,980
skim and not the read.

257
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,600
Very, very important.

258
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:16,839
So how do we do that?

259
00:06:16,899 --> 00:06:17,709
There are a couple main things

260
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:18,360
that we want to do.

261
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,959
First is we want to avoid blocks

262
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:21,899
of text.

263
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:23,720
Blocks of text just scare people

264
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,180
off.

265
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,040
They are terrified.

266
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,569
It is the modern customer's

267
00:06:26,569 --> 00:06:28,420
kryptonite is blocks of text.

268
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,920
So it's very difficult for the

269
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,540
eyes to like make out and process

270
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:33,160
blocks of text when we only have a

271
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,709
couple seconds of the person's

272
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,160
time.

273
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,670
So this just results in people

274
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:38,360
skipping past any type of block of

275
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,279
information.

276
00:06:39,819 --> 00:06:41,209
So we really want to shorten our

277
00:06:41,209 --> 00:06:42,540
copy or split it up in our text

278
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:43,709
with like line breaks and

279
00:06:43,709 --> 00:06:45,339
different forms of graphics.

280
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:46,949
So when you're outlining your

281
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:48,740
emails like as far as like copy,

282
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:49,769
you really want to make sure that

283
00:06:49,819 --> 00:06:51,009
you're splitting things up for the

284
00:06:51,009 --> 00:06:51,560
designer.

285
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,439
So here are like two examples.

286
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,660
These could have been put in like

287
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:56,920
blocks of text.

288
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,240
But look, they're listed out.

289
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,500
One, two, three, four, five.

290
00:06:59,579 --> 00:07:01,360
You can easily skim this.

291
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,660
Five ways nature supports mental

292
00:07:03,769 --> 00:07:04,579
health.

293
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,660
Reduces the stress.

294
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,379
That's bolded.

295
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:08,319
Improves mood.

296
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:09,100
That's bolded.

297
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,240
Improves attention and memory.

298
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:10,920
That's bolded.

299
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:12,160
And you can see it's just not

300
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:12,920
blocked out.

301
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:14,730
It's just clear, easy to just for

302
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:16,000
your eyes to follow.

303
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:17,329
Same thing as right here.

304
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:18,839
Easy for the eyes to follow.

305
00:07:18,899 --> 00:07:20,339
We're not using blocks of text.

306
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:22,029
We are just separating things out

307
00:07:22,029 --> 00:07:23,779
into like our different points and

308
00:07:23,779 --> 00:07:25,389
then bolding like the main stuff

309
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:26,899
or putting it up clear up top so

310
00:07:26,899 --> 00:07:28,290
that if somebody wants more

311
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:29,990
information, they can read down

312
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:30,360
here.

313
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,350
But if they just want to skim,

314
00:07:31,459 --> 00:07:32,220
they can look at this.

315
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:34,120
So avoid blocks of text.

316
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,779
That's the real main first thing

317
00:07:35,779 --> 00:07:36,899
that you want to do.

318
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,310
The other thing that you want to

319
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:39,730
do is you want to bold all of your

320
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:40,470
main points.

321
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,990
Most of your audience will not

322
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:43,550
read any of your copy, but they

323
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:45,120
will read the bolded main points

324
00:07:45,189 --> 00:07:47,120
as they're skimming your email.

325
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:49,050
So use body copy to support your

326
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:50,120
main points, kind of like I

327
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:51,110
mentioned before.

328
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:52,319
Some people might read it.

329
00:07:52,379 --> 00:07:53,540
People might do that.

330
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,149
But other people are just going to

331
00:07:55,149 --> 00:07:56,389
read the main points.

332
00:07:56,459 --> 00:07:57,939
And I mean, look at what I've done

333
00:07:57,939 --> 00:07:59,449
with this guide and all the other

334
00:07:59,449 --> 00:08:00,829
guides in these modules.

335
00:08:01,389 --> 00:08:02,670
I put, if you want to read all

336
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:03,839
this stuff, you can.

337
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:04,629
I've attached the links to

338
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:05,139
everything.

339
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:06,310
But really what we're doing is

340
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:07,720
we're highlighting the main points

341
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,860
so people can get the gist of it

342
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:10,189
if they just want to skim it.

343
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:12,100
So a really good example is this

344
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,279
guide and what I'm doing here.

345
00:08:14,339 --> 00:08:15,709
The main points allow the readers

346
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,899
to get the full picture.

347
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:18,589
Then the body copy is used for the

348
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,379
further justification and proof

349
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:21,699
you have about that.

350
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,389
So right here, here's an example.

351
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,899
Accept the seasons of life.

352
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:26,500
Relationships are rarely 50-50.

353
00:08:26,579 --> 00:08:27,759
Striving for your goals is

354
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:28,579
underrated.

355
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:30,470
And remember, you always have

356
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:31,220
choices.

357
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,379
And so you can see justification

358
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:35,538
in backing the information up is

359
00:08:35,538 --> 00:08:36,610
in this text.

360
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:39,158
And you can read more if you want.

361
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:41,070
These are like kind of blocks of

362
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,870
text but not like too big.

363
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,700
This is like kind of the situation

364
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,500
where you can sometimes have like

365
00:08:46,509 --> 00:08:48,389
quick blocks of text for different

366
00:08:48,389 --> 00:08:49,080
points.

367
00:08:49,139 --> 00:08:50,639
But as long as you bold like your

368
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:52,139
main points, then people can

369
00:08:52,139 --> 00:08:53,179
easily skim that.

370
00:08:53,259 --> 00:08:54,870
Here's a good example number two.

371
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,289
Comparing others versus your

372
00:08:56,289 --> 00:08:56,759
brand.

373
00:08:57,759 --> 00:08:59,389
But rather than have everything

374
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,240
just in like single points without

375
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,919
bolding the top, you have or that

376
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:05,759
would be tough to read.

377
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:07,379
But instead, we bold just the main

378
00:09:07,379 --> 00:09:07,919
points.

379
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,600
And if people want to have further

380
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,110
information on that specific

381
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:12,419
point, then they can.

382
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,820
Empty monthly versus daily.

383
00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:15,820
If you want to read more and say

384
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,980
at any time empty after dozens of

385
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:19,429
cycles, perfect.

386
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,600
Then you have that information.

387
00:09:20,659 --> 00:09:22,279
But you can just easily see all

388
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:23,740
the main points here.

389
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:25,879
That's one of the other keys.

390
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,559
And then also, just keep it short.

391
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:28,769
We'll touch on this in all of our

392
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:29,460
principles.

393
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,500
But we really want our copy to be

394
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,139
short.

395
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,720
The shorter it is, the more

396
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,820
skimmable it is.

397
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:36,139
If there's a lot of stuff, you're

398
00:09:36,139 --> 00:09:37,480
not going to be able to skim it.

399
00:09:37,539 --> 00:09:38,799
So that's very, very, very

400
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:39,539
important.

401
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,960
And these are just kind of the

402
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,659
three main things to make our copy

403
00:09:42,659 --> 00:09:43,480
skimmable.

404
00:09:43,539 --> 00:09:44,580
And we're going to be talking a

405
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:45,639
lot about this and then using

406
00:09:45,639 --> 00:09:46,360
infographics.

407
00:09:46,779 --> 00:09:48,600
That's kind of like the main thing

408
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,419
I'm trying to say with these copy

409
00:09:50,419 --> 00:09:52,730
modules is don't focus less on the

410
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:53,860
copy and focus more on

411
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,460
infographics like this.

412
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,470
So avoid blocks of text, highlight

413
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:59,279
your main points, and keep your

414
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:00,629
copy nice and short.

415
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:01,970
We only have a couple seconds of

416
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,460
our customer's attention, so we

417
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:04,980
have to be really intentional with

418
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,440
what copy that we are using.
