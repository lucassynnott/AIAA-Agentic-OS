1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,120
Okay, so we have talked about the

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:03,990
microtopics and how we want to

3
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:05,759
educate the customer and we don't

4
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:06,799
just want to annoy our list with

5
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:08,000
discount sales sales sales sales

6
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,199
sales and all this stuff.

7
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:10,710
So I'm going to give you 29

8
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:12,519
non-discount email frameworks and

9
00:00:12,519 --> 00:00:14,029
then some examples for a few of

10
00:00:14,029 --> 00:00:15,779
them, about half of them, giving

11
00:00:15,779 --> 00:00:17,239
two examples for each.

12
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:19,140
So that is what we are doing.

13
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:20,339
These are things that you can plug

14
00:00:20,339 --> 00:00:21,100
and play and copy.

15
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,570
You could literally just follow

16
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:23,989
these frameworks and then just

17
00:00:23,989 --> 00:00:25,399
repeat it over and over again if

18
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:26,260
you wanted to.

19
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,600
But later I'm also going to show

20
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,120
you more ways to get more ideas.

21
00:00:29,179 --> 00:00:31,070
So 29 non-discount email

22
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:33,060
frameworks and examples.

23
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:33,960
Let's get into it.

24
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:35,030
So I already showed this.

25
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:36,149
I already went over this.

26
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,729
Education plus positioning equals

27
00:00:37,729 --> 00:00:39,009
sales without discounts.

28
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:40,969
We want to educate the customer on

29
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:42,840
a problem that they could have a

30
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,549
process that we follow or a

31
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:46,799
solution that we have to any of

32
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:48,780
these problems and then position

33
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:50,460
our product just as that solution.

34
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,390
So educate and then also promote

35
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:53,740
our product subtly.

36
00:00:53,799 --> 00:00:55,570
So these are all of the campaign

37
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:57,539
ideas, which you can screenshot

38
00:00:57,539 --> 00:00:59,579
this, do whatever you want, take

39
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:01,340
the document, which you have

40
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:03,329
provided for you, and use these

41
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:04,640
over and over again.

42
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:05,870
You can lean on some more than

43
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:06,340
others.

44
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:07,390
Like there are a ton of different

45
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:08,469
benefit emails you could do, a ton

46
00:01:08,469 --> 00:01:09,500
of different feature emails you

47
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:10,390
could do, a ton of different

48
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:11,510
frequently asked question emails

49
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:13,120
you could do, all that stuff.

50
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:14,170
Same as like trending and

51
00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:15,560
testimonials, us versus them,

52
00:01:15,629 --> 00:01:16,579
myths versus facts.

53
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,849
These are all emails that you can

54
00:01:17,849 --> 00:01:18,769
continue to repeat.

55
00:01:18,859 --> 00:01:19,950
So let's break down a few of them,

56
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:20,859
some of my favorites.

57
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,920
So first one is one benefit.

58
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:24,709
So that's the whole thing of the

59
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:25,299
email.

60
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:26,719
We are focusing on one singular

61
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:28,189
benefit that our product brings

62
00:01:28,189 --> 00:01:29,159
for the customer.

63
00:01:29,219 --> 00:01:30,629
Right off the top of your head,

64
00:01:30,629 --> 00:01:32,280
for your product, you should come

65
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,099
up with 10 single benefits of like

66
00:01:34,099 --> 00:01:35,629
going with you, going with your

67
00:01:35,629 --> 00:01:36,299
product.

68
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:37,980
And so let's, you can create 10

69
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:39,609
emails off of that, just focusing

70
00:01:39,609 --> 00:01:40,299
one by one.

71
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:42,200
We don't want to show everything

72
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,650
all at once for a lot of our

73
00:01:43,709 --> 00:01:45,629
emails because then the customer

74
00:01:45,629 --> 00:01:47,379
will kind of like forget all of

75
00:01:47,379 --> 00:01:47,980
them.

76
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,540
We just want to drill into their

77
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:50,620
head one at a time.

78
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,799
Customer doesn't have a big

79
00:01:51,819 --> 00:01:53,189
attention span, so we need to go

80
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:53,939
one at a time.

81
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,219
So why?

82
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,670
By highlighting the one benefit,

83
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:57,659
easy for them to know.

84
00:01:57,739 --> 00:01:59,629
So we just want to dive deeper on

85
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,890
our product, whatever it may be,

86
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:04,000
and earn those trust points.

87
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:06,439
And so how, just write out 10 of

88
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:09,210
your, 10 of your benefits and then

89
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:11,370
just create an email about each

90
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:12,020
one.

91
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,169
If you want to have a chat GPT

92
00:02:13,189 --> 00:02:14,419
prompt to help you come up with

93
00:02:14,419 --> 00:02:15,509
some of these, you could just say,

94
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:16,870
we have this product for this

95
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:17,879
e-commerce store.

96
00:02:17,939 --> 00:02:19,060
Our product is, put as much

97
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,400
information as you can about a

98
00:02:20,409 --> 00:02:21,000
product.

99
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:22,270
It's verified, you ought to take

100
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:23,550
information from your website if

101
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:23,990
you can.

102
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,169
You could say, give me a list of

103
00:02:25,169 --> 00:02:26,560
10 specific benefits about this

104
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,080
product.

105
00:02:27,139 --> 00:02:28,419
So kind of to show you what I

106
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:30,060
mean, I have a couple examples

107
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:30,569
here.

108
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:32,729
So we have this example from Magic

109
00:02:32,729 --> 00:02:35,020
Mind, super simple email, banish

110
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:37,060
festive fogginess, has a bit of

111
00:02:37,069 --> 00:02:39,330
information, and then just showing

112
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:41,009
like step-by-step how to use our

113
00:02:41,009 --> 00:02:42,740
product, has cool branding, good

114
00:02:42,909 --> 00:02:44,740
design, releases dopamine.

115
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,240
And that single benefit is just

116
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,539
conquering brain fog.

117
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:48,819
That's the one benefit they

118
00:02:48,819 --> 00:02:49,979
decided to drill in on.

119
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:51,539
And then we have this one from

120
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:52,000
Seed.

121
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:53,599
Their single benefit is getting

122
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:54,120
rid of bloat.

123
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:55,909
All they do is they say 61% of

124
00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:57,569
people experience digestive

125
00:02:57,569 --> 00:02:58,479
discomfort.

126
00:02:58,539 --> 00:03:00,080
The good news, we have strains

127
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:01,659
that are proven to reduce your

128
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,090
bloating in two weeks.

129
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,659
That's the whole email.

130
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:05,960
And then we have just like some

131
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,229
testimonials right here.

132
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:09,199
It's just super duper duper

133
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,080
simple.

134
00:03:10,139 --> 00:03:11,439
This is the benefit.

135
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,759
Use our product.

136
00:03:12,819 --> 00:03:14,879
And ours is like the solution.

137
00:03:14,939 --> 00:03:16,830
So that's just the one benefit

138
00:03:16,889 --> 00:03:17,580
email.

139
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:19,159
Very nice and simple.

140
00:03:19,219 --> 00:03:20,860
Very similar.

141
00:03:20,939 --> 00:03:22,219
This one is one feature.

142
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,789
So rather than looking at like a

143
00:03:23,789 --> 00:03:25,500
benefit of your product, we want

144
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,830
to focus on a feature of our

145
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:27,550
product.

146
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:29,150
Focus on the benefits, not the

147
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:29,879
features.

148
00:03:29,939 --> 00:03:30,539
You always hear that.

149
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:31,479
Focus on the benefits, not the

150
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:31,900
features.

151
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,599
That's a flawed claim that gets

152
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:34,629
thrown around.

153
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:35,419
People want to know what's in

154
00:03:35,419 --> 00:03:35,960
their product.

155
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,120
They want to know like the science

156
00:03:37,129 --> 00:03:38,139
behind it when they're making

157
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:38,689
decisions.

158
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,919
Especially, again, if it's a

159
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,689
health product.

160
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,389
Even if you have a clothing

161
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:44,300
product, you can do different

162
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,169
features like our pocket.

163
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,759
You can have a whole email on like

164
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:49,180
your front pocket and how much

165
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,240
space it has in it.

166
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:51,939
Or your zippers, like how your

167
00:03:51,939 --> 00:03:52,710
zippers work.

168
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,400
You can have all sorts of features

169
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,050
because those have benefits tied

170
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:56,759
into them.

171
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:58,849
And so people just love, people

172
00:03:58,849 --> 00:04:01,080
love features of your product.

173
00:04:01,139 --> 00:04:03,219
And so like why do you think that

174
00:04:03,219 --> 00:04:05,449
every software out there has the

175
00:04:05,449 --> 00:04:07,419
word like AI thrown on every

176
00:04:07,419 --> 00:04:08,000
landing page?

177
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:09,500
They just, if you look at any

178
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,169
software, guarantee, go to their

179
00:04:11,189 --> 00:04:12,750
website, they have AI in like one

180
00:04:12,789 --> 00:04:14,300
of the main points because it's a

181
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:14,900
feature.

182
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:16,699
And people like features and stuff

183
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:17,399
like that.

184
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:19,439
So like every protein powder will

185
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:21,529
say the benefit, gain muscle.

186
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,199
But that's just so basic.

187
00:04:24,259 --> 00:04:25,759
We want our features to make our

188
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,000
product like unique.

189
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,560
Because if you were to say like

190
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,490
gain muscle, which is the benefit,

191
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:32,560
that's the benefit, gain muscle.

192
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,120
But not everyone is going to say

193
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,910
pre-digested whey protein, which

194
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:37,480
people are going to find unique

195
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,439
and want to buy.

196
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,589
And so that's really what can set

197
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,639
you over the edge.

198
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:42,759
Your features are what make you

199
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:43,319
different.

200
00:04:43,379 --> 00:04:45,000
All protein powders, they do the

201
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,759
same thing.

202
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:46,720
They have the same benefit.

203
00:04:46,779 --> 00:04:49,699
It's all just to build muscle.

204
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,560
But each one has different little

205
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,660
mechanisms and features within it,

206
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:54,800
which make it special and why

207
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,990
people will end up buying from

208
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:56,730
them instead.

209
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,139
So how what you may think about

210
00:04:59,189 --> 00:05:01,079
your product is common sense may

211
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:02,870
be unknown to your customer.

212
00:05:03,019 --> 00:05:04,639
So if you've been in, to go back

213
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,579
to the supplement like protein, if

214
00:05:06,579 --> 00:05:08,639
you've been in the industry for 30

215
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,230
years, you've been lifting weights

216
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:10,819
for so long.

217
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:12,300
And some of the stuff you think is

218
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,899
common sense, like for example,

219
00:05:13,899 --> 00:05:15,379
like what creatine does for your

220
00:05:15,379 --> 00:05:16,709
muscles or what instantized

221
00:05:16,709 --> 00:05:18,470
creatine is or why you need to

222
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:20,629
take creatine every day instead of

223
00:05:20,629 --> 00:05:22,339
just taking it every now and

224
00:05:22,339 --> 00:05:22,980
again.

225
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:24,459
That could be common sense to you.

226
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,089
But the everyday person who just

227
00:05:26,089 --> 00:05:27,439
found out about creatine last

228
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:28,980
week, they don't know that.

229
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,740
So how you can do this to really

230
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,870
like understand like your features

231
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:34,790
is just write out every material

232
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:36,769
or ingredient or a little feature

233
00:05:36,779 --> 00:05:38,699
like your pockets, write it all

234
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:39,339
out.

235
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:40,230
Each one of those can be a

236
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:41,350
singular benefit that you can

237
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,459
highlight in the email.

238
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:43,959
So here's some examples.

239
00:05:44,019 --> 00:05:45,860
So for this product, one of their

240
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:47,939
main ingredients is Tamanu oil.

241
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,959
Never heard of it.

242
00:05:49,019 --> 00:05:50,639
Can't really read this.

243
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:51,720
Kind of difficult to see.

244
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,790
But it's pretty much just saying

245
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:55,259
what, like unlock the power of

246
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:56,060
Tamanu oil.

247
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,350
Hopefully I'm pronouncing that

248
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:57,759
right.

249
00:05:57,839 --> 00:05:59,199
So you're just breaking down one

250
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:00,620
feature of your product and what

251
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:01,579
makes it special.

252
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:03,620
That's what is going to sell you.

253
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,810
And then, and they even break it

254
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:08,079
further and say like what are the

255
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:10,000
features of Tamanu oil.

256
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,459
So that's super effective.

257
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:12,779
And then also like this one, what

258
00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:14,300
we mean by instantized creatine.

259
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,600
So creatine is instantized.

260
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:18,769
That's its feature, feature of the

261
00:06:18,769 --> 00:06:19,540
product.

262
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,019
And so you're just breaking down.

263
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:21,660
What is it?

264
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,709
Usual creatine does this, but

265
00:06:23,709 --> 00:06:25,500
instantized does this.

266
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,509
And that makes it this.

267
00:06:27,579 --> 00:06:29,089
And here's how it can benefit you.

268
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,550
So those are the one feature

269
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:31,290
campaigns.

270
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:33,980
Then we have FAQ, which is very

271
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:36,160
similar to the others.

272
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:37,279
And you can have a ton of these.

273
00:06:37,339 --> 00:06:38,459
So it's just what we're going to

274
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,699
find a common question from our

275
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:41,860
customer and then directly address

276
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:42,120
it.

277
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:44,779
FAQ emails that are quick.

278
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:45,930
You can have FAQ emails that

279
00:06:45,949 --> 00:06:47,379
answer multiple questions as long

280
00:06:47,379 --> 00:06:48,269
as they're quick.

281
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,100
But for longer ones, I like to do

282
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,649
a full email out of this.

283
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,459
So again, what may be common sense

284
00:06:53,459 --> 00:06:54,670
to you may not be for your

285
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:55,500
customers.

286
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:57,920
So rather than drown out all of

287
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,420
our FAQs and making them all like

288
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,720
kind of random and creating a

289
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,459
super long email,

290
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:04,660
we just want to focus on one to

291
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,050
really get our point across.

292
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,420
This way, the customer has no

293
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:08,949
other choice but to agree because

294
00:07:08,949 --> 00:07:10,300
we laid out all the facts.

295
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,699
Just think of yourself as an alien

296
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:13,029
on Mars who just came to Earth and

297
00:07:13,089 --> 00:07:14,430
found out about your product.

298
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,600
What would they ask?

299
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,050
Gather data from your support

300
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:17,480
team.

301
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:18,920
Ask your support like what are

302
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,180
like the emails that we get

303
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:22,029
questions about the most and then

304
00:07:22,029 --> 00:07:23,920
create emails out of each one.

305
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,839
You can also use ChatGPT.

306
00:07:25,899 --> 00:07:26,459
Here's a prompt.

307
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:29,360
We have this product and this for

308
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,720
this brand.

309
00:07:30,779 --> 00:07:32,540
Our product does this.

310
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,009
Give me a list of 50 frequently

311
00:07:34,009 --> 00:07:35,470
asked questions about our niche to

312
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:36,879
customers that may have no idea we

313
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:37,399
exist.

314
00:07:37,459 --> 00:07:39,579
So look at both of these examples.

315
00:07:39,699 --> 00:07:41,319
When can I expect to see creatines

316
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:41,720
of X?

317
00:07:41,779 --> 00:07:43,970
That is one frequently asked

318
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:45,040
question.

319
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,199
How soon can I see results?

320
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:47,120
Same as this one.

321
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:48,819
Can teeth whitening harm your

322
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:49,459
teeth?

323
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:51,339
Very common question, I'm sure,

324
00:07:51,339 --> 00:07:53,019
for teeth whitening brands.

325
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,370
And so for this one, you're just

326
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:57,189
going into depth on this is when

327
00:07:57,189 --> 00:07:58,930
you can see it and this is why.

328
00:07:59,019 --> 00:08:00,300
And here are some tips.

329
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,360
And then recommended for you.

330
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:03,589
Super simple.

331
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:04,730
Overcome that objection.

332
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,220
And then same thing for here.

333
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:07,579
The truth behind teeth whitening.

334
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:08,839
Here's the problem with most.

335
00:08:08,899 --> 00:08:10,269
The thing is like most teeth

336
00:08:10,269 --> 00:08:11,899
whitening, they use this.

337
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:12,779
So it can be harmful.

338
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:14,319
But ours doesn't.

339
00:08:14,379 --> 00:08:15,689
We are the solution.

340
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:16,720
See what I mean here?

341
00:08:16,819 --> 00:08:18,079
By tying your product in as the

342
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:18,709
solution.

343
00:08:18,779 --> 00:08:20,680
That is what can really set you

344
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,860
over the edge.

345
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,990
And then adding some social proof.

346
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:25,009
So there's that one.

347
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:26,339
Now let's go to what's inside.

348
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:28,060
So if you sell like a package or a

349
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:29,589
consumable good, explain

350
00:08:29,589 --> 00:08:31,439
everything that comes with the

351
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:31,620
order.

352
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,639
That's super simple.

353
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,960
For example, your ingredients.

354
00:08:34,019 --> 00:08:35,038
Kind of like we talked about

355
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:35,620
features.

356
00:08:36,158 --> 00:08:37,690
Let's talk about what's inside and

357
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:39,129
like what maybe you throw extra

358
00:08:39,129 --> 00:08:40,418
things into your order.

359
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,658
If you have a bundle, explain each

360
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:42,970
thing that comes in the bundle.

361
00:08:43,038 --> 00:08:44,330
This is a great email that you can

362
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:44,740
send.

363
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,870
So people just want to know

364
00:08:45,889 --> 00:08:47,399
exactly what they're getting.

365
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,389
It helps clear some of the

366
00:08:48,389 --> 00:08:49,690
uncertainty that someone could

367
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:50,750
have before ordering.

368
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,480
We want to just clear as much

369
00:08:52,509 --> 00:08:54,519
uncertainty up as possible.

370
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:55,879
So some brands, for example,

371
00:08:55,879 --> 00:08:57,250
they'll give like free product

372
00:08:57,309 --> 00:08:58,649
guides with every purchase.

373
00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:00,629
That's like a free course with

374
00:09:00,629 --> 00:09:01,840
like whatever.

375
00:09:01,899 --> 00:09:02,970
But then they don't even tell

376
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:04,200
their customers about it.

377
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:05,399
That's a nice little bonus to get

378
00:09:05,409 --> 00:09:06,379
somebody over the edge.

379
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,879
Be like, hey, if you order today,

380
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:09,360
we'll give you this free guide.

381
00:09:09,419 --> 00:09:10,230
And then someone's like, oh, I

382
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:10,990
want this free guide.

383
00:09:11,059 --> 00:09:12,549
That right there can be included

384
00:09:12,549 --> 00:09:14,139
in like a what's inside email.

385
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,480
Just like, hey, when you order

386
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,600
this, you also get this.

387
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,600
If you sell consumable products,

388
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,419
you can list everything that you

389
00:09:20,419 --> 00:09:21,240
have in it.

390
00:09:21,299 --> 00:09:22,059
People want to know exactly what

391
00:09:22,059 --> 00:09:22,940
they're putting in their body.

392
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:24,389
So just unpack everything in your

393
00:09:24,389 --> 00:09:25,710
bundle of product and display it

394
00:09:25,769 --> 00:09:26,840
in like a list format.

395
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:28,019
Just make sure it's skimmable and

396
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:28,659
easy to read.

397
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,259
So here's like an unboxing for

398
00:09:30,289 --> 00:09:31,759
AG1, massive brand.

399
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:32,940
This is a great email.

400
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,480
There's so much to look forward

401
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:34,799
to.

402
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,399
You get this, you get this, you

403
00:09:36,429 --> 00:09:37,860
get a shaker bottle, you get

404
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:39,460
packs, yada, yada, yada.

405
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,580
Super simple, super easy.

406
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:42,509
And then this one for supplement

407
00:09:42,509 --> 00:09:42,840
brand.

408
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:44,559
Here are the seven ingredients

409
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:46,019
that are in our product.

410
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,139
Just listed out here.

411
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,519
Super easy, skimmable, and easy to

412
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:50,759
just check out.

413
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,080
Super good email.

414
00:09:52,139 --> 00:09:53,440
Clears up a ton of uncertainty.

415
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,399
Another one is how it's made.

416
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,779
So an email just explaining the

417
00:09:56,779 --> 00:09:58,450
creation process of your product.

418
00:09:58,519 --> 00:09:59,559
Similar to before.

419
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:01,059
Maybe common sense to you.

420
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,009
Maybe not be for your average

421
00:10:03,059 --> 00:10:04,000
customer.

422
00:10:04,059 --> 00:10:05,159
For example, if you have a

423
00:10:05,169 --> 00:10:06,509
filtration process for like a

424
00:10:06,529 --> 00:10:08,100
certain ingredient like beer.

425
00:10:08,179 --> 00:10:09,350
These aren't emails, but I thought

426
00:10:09,379 --> 00:10:10,460
these were great graphics.

427
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:13,129
If you have like a filtration

428
00:10:13,129 --> 00:10:15,409
process that like you, the process

429
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,340
takes it through like three

430
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:19,070
different filters to like make

431
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,470
sure it's safe.

432
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:21,679
But then you don't tell customers.

433
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:22,669
They're going to always question

434
00:10:22,669 --> 00:10:23,620
the safety of your product.

435
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:25,059
But that right there, just by

436
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,519
explaining how it's made, here's

437
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:27,700
how we take it from here.

438
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:28,679
It proves the quality of your

439
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:29,139
product.

440
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,350
And it's also super interesting to

441
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:31,090
see that laid out.

442
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,570
This also gives your product a

443
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:34,120
story and adds background to the

444
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,600
product that the customer will

445
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,039
soon have in their hands.

446
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,029
So when they look at their

447
00:10:38,029 --> 00:10:39,340
product, it's not just like this

448
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,320
appeared in my hand.

449
00:10:40,379 --> 00:10:41,500
It has a story.

450
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:43,379
It went from here to here to here.

451
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,659
And now it's in my hand.

452
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,539
It's a lot cooler.

453
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,490
And it creates a full customer

454
00:10:48,539 --> 00:10:49,379
journey.

455
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,830
So, and then how, just list out

456
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:53,330
every step of your process from

457
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:55,000
material gathering to the factory

458
00:10:55,049 --> 00:10:56,610
to warehouse to shipment.

459
00:10:56,679 --> 00:10:57,720
Talk about the process or

460
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,019
highlight parts about it.

461
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,230
Different ones like this.

462
00:11:00,299 --> 00:11:02,110
Like step by step, lay them out so

463
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:03,679
the customer can see it.

464
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:04,259
Super interesting.

465
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,879
And then one, how to use.

466
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:07,909
Again, this is super

467
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:09,320
straightforward, but super

468
00:11:09,409 --> 00:11:10,129
effective.

469
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,450
So just a step by step product of

470
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:12,580
how to use your product.

471
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:14,000
So why?

472
00:11:14,059 --> 00:11:15,149
We just want to be as clear as

473
00:11:15,149 --> 00:11:16,570
possible with our prospects.

474
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:18,399
Remove as much uncertainty as

475
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,240
possible.

476
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,659
We don't want to leave things to

477
00:11:20,659 --> 00:11:21,750
their imagination because then

478
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:22,870
they're going to overcomplicate

479
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:23,320
things.

480
00:11:23,379 --> 00:11:24,580
We all know you love to

481
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:26,220
overcomplicate things.

482
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:27,690
So let's remove uncertainty by

483
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:29,519
explaining how to use our product.

484
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:30,700
And a bonus if you can explain

485
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,919
like how to get the most out of

486
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:33,649
your product, which we can talk

487
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,830
about here with this example.

488
00:11:35,899 --> 00:11:36,500
But how?

489
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:37,710
Just use your product yourself and

490
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:38,940
share the steps that you follow.

491
00:11:39,059 --> 00:11:40,029
If you have a tough time

492
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:41,600
explaining it, you can alter this

493
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,899
to be how to get the most out of

494
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:43,700
your product.

495
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:45,320
Or if you sell clothing, you could

496
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,460
say like how to style your

497
00:11:46,529 --> 00:11:47,059
product.

498
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,330
Those are all things that you can

499
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:48,600
do.

500
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,529
So a couple examples, how to pull

501
00:11:50,529 --> 00:11:51,639
a shot of espresso.

502
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,580
So probably a common objection for

503
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:55,210
this brand is just like I don't

504
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,070
know how to – why would I buy this

505
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:58,909
product if I don't even really

506
00:11:58,909 --> 00:12:00,179
know how to do this?

507
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,059
And so they have like an article

508
00:12:02,059 --> 00:12:03,870
of doing like how to pull a shot

509
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:04,879
of espresso.

510
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:06,320
What's the best recipe?

511
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:08,460
So people can know how much like

512
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:10,590
ratio to have different stuff and

513
00:12:10,659 --> 00:12:12,059
how to prepare it.

514
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,610
Super effective in getting people

515
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:16,960
to realize it's not that hard and

516
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,820
get them to purchase.

517
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,539
And then how to get the most out

518
00:12:20,549 --> 00:12:21,330
of your product.

519
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:22,279
So even if it's super

520
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:23,889
straightforward like how to spray

521
00:12:23,889 --> 00:12:25,049
a perfume, that's super

522
00:12:25,049 --> 00:12:26,539
straightforward for like how to

523
00:12:26,539 --> 00:12:27,059
use it.

524
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,480
Just say how to get the most out

525
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:28,940
of it.

526
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,889
So tip number one, protect your

527
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:32,759
perfume from direct light.

528
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:33,809
Avoid the bathroom.

529
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:35,250
Store in a fragrance in a dry

530
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:35,779
place.

531
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,940
Keep your perfume in a place with

532
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:37,889
consistent temperature.

533
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,309
Like these are all tips where it

534
00:12:39,309 --> 00:12:40,840
can prove to people that like it's

535
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,200
just bringing value to them,

536
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:43,539
building trust points.

537
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,700
You're not heavy selling them.

538
00:12:44,759 --> 00:12:46,120
So those are all very effective.

539
00:12:46,179 --> 00:12:49,110
And then we have back in stock.

540
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,830
So if you have a product back in

541
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:52,590
stock, create a full email or two

542
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:53,320
about it.

543
00:12:53,379 --> 00:12:54,580
Just let people know of that.

544
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,120
But even if you don't have a

545
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,019
product back in stock, just get

546
00:12:58,019 --> 00:12:59,539
some new products in.

547
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,700
Maybe put like an extra shipment

548
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:01,830
in even though you never really

549
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:02,679
went out of stock.

550
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,919
Just use the angle of back in

551
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:05,289
stock because it works really

552
00:13:05,289 --> 00:13:05,740
well.

553
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:07,190
If something is back in stock,

554
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:08,820
that means it went out of stock.

555
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:09,970
And if something went out of

556
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:11,500
stock, that means it's popular.

557
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:13,139
And that means it may likely go

558
00:13:13,139 --> 00:13:14,730
out of stock again, which is

559
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:15,440
urgency.

560
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,259
So the back in stock angle mixes

561
00:13:17,259 --> 00:13:19,360
popularity and urgency at once.

562
00:13:19,419 --> 00:13:20,539
So even if a product, again,

563
00:13:20,539 --> 00:13:21,679
didn't necessarily go out of

564
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:23,379
stock, you'd still use this angle.

565
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,879
So this is one of my favorites to

566
00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:26,440
do.

567
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,740
So keep track of when you get new

568
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:28,450
products in.

569
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:29,899
Just create a feature product.

570
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,350
You don't even necessarily need to

571
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:31,820
do that.

572
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:32,769
You can just say back in stock

573
00:13:32,769 --> 00:13:33,500
whenever you want.

574
00:13:33,559 --> 00:13:34,480
So here's an example.

575
00:13:34,539 --> 00:13:35,659
The Spidey Suds is back.

576
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,919
This has returned.

577
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:38,799
You could say limited time only.

578
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:39,620
That adds urgency.

579
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:41,879
So then just product feature here.

580
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,399
And then just another example.

581
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:44,799
The full glass is back.

582
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,320
And it's in this style.

583
00:13:46,379 --> 00:13:48,649
That's also something that you can

584
00:13:48,649 --> 00:13:50,899
do and just feature whatever your

585
00:13:50,909 --> 00:13:51,750
style is.

586
00:13:51,879 --> 00:13:53,750
So just always do back in stock

587
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,379
emails now and again.

588
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,559
And then straightforward trending

589
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:58,440
products.

590
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,970
Feature email on what products are

591
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:01,519
performing well on that month.

592
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:03,159
These work because the customer

593
00:14:03,159 --> 00:14:04,860
just likes to be updated on trends

594
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,629
and popular products, what's going

595
00:14:06,629 --> 00:14:06,879
on.

596
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,330
But one thing that I don't see a

597
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:11,379
lot of people do too much is doing

598
00:14:11,379 --> 00:14:12,740
future trending.

599
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:14,669
Not just saying, here's what's

600
00:14:14,669 --> 00:14:16,299
been popular in the past six

601
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:17,059
months.

602
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,000
You want to say, here's what's

603
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,159
popular this upcoming season.

604
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,840
Or here's, we noticed that this

605
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,419
trend is going to be new and it's

606
00:14:24,419 --> 00:14:25,309
up and coming.

607
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,500
You want to frame it as like,

608
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,570
here's what's going on.

609
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:29,330
Instead of saying, like for

610
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:31,200
summer, trending email, you don't

611
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,639
want to say, here's what was

612
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:33,980
popular last summer.

613
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,059
That was last summer.

614
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:35,840
Shit changes.

615
00:14:35,899 --> 00:14:37,250
You want to be, here's what's

616
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,519
trending this summer.

617
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:40,470
Here's like the newest trend for

618
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,509
summer going.

619
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,700
Here's the trend that's going to

620
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:43,919
take over the rest of summer.

621
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,279
You really can't send too many of

622
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:46,039
these emails.

623
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,629
They're a great way to make you

624
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:48,379
stand out.

625
00:14:48,539 --> 00:14:49,519
So just pick a product or

626
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:51,059
collection you want to highlight,

627
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:52,559
feature those, and just create

628
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:53,470
trending off of it.

629
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,330
You could also, bonus points, if

630
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:56,639
you create like a curated

631
00:14:56,669 --> 00:14:58,299
collection for the customer.

632
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,740
Inside of Shopify or whatever

633
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:01,389
platform you're using, create a

634
00:15:01,389 --> 00:15:02,870
custom collection for like the

635
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:04,309
trending or a different category

636
00:15:04,309 --> 00:15:04,950
that you want.

637
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:06,700
So for this example right here,

638
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:08,450
this was a special Shopify page.

639
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:09,480
It was new and trending.

640
00:15:09,539 --> 00:15:11,159
It was checker cases, 2024's

641
00:15:11,159 --> 00:15:12,299
hottest case, number one

642
00:15:12,299 --> 00:15:13,870
bestseller this year, and just

643
00:15:13,909 --> 00:15:15,940
created like a new collection page

644
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:17,899
for this, just linking people to

645
00:15:17,899 --> 00:15:18,669
that page.

646
00:15:18,759 --> 00:15:19,970
And then they're also saying now

647
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:21,139
in stock, even though this has

648
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:22,190
always been in stock.

649
00:15:22,279 --> 00:15:24,120
So that's always angle that you

650
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:24,840
can use.

651
00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:26,190
And then another example is like

652
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:26,759
trending.

653
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,570
It's just like green, green for

654
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:29,200
spring.

655
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,590
This is something where you're

656
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,250
just showing off green products.

657
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,259
These are trending right now.

658
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:34,659
Also something that you can do and

659
00:15:34,659 --> 00:15:35,450
is very effective.

660
00:15:35,539 --> 00:15:37,889
Reviews and testimonials, probably

661
00:15:37,889 --> 00:15:39,830
one of my favorites, if not the

662
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:41,870
favorite, just because it's so

663
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:43,970
straightforward, so easy, but so

664
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:44,669
effective.

665
00:15:44,899 --> 00:15:45,600
Always is.

666
00:15:45,659 --> 00:15:47,299
But people just don't really send

667
00:15:47,299 --> 00:15:49,090
testimonial emails that often.

668
00:15:49,179 --> 00:15:50,330
Don't know why.

669
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,299
So testimonials just do a few

670
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,070
things.

671
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:54,389
They prove that you're a legit

672
00:15:54,389 --> 00:15:55,529
brand and you deliver your

673
00:15:55,529 --> 00:15:57,080
products to people, which is going

674
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,779
to overcome some doubt in people.

675
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,059
And two, they also show that other

676
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:01,289
people are fans of your brand.

677
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:03,169
And as you know, humans like to

678
00:16:03,169 --> 00:16:04,039
follow the herd.

679
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,240
As hearing others who took the

680
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,610
leap, they made the risk of buying

681
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:07,929
from you and then they're happy,

682
00:16:07,929 --> 00:16:09,200
customers more likely to.

683
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:10,960
So it's really important to pull

684
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,970
testimonials that actually address

685
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:14,399
like an objection that the

686
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:15,639
customer may have.

687
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,690
General testimonials don't do too

688
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:18,240
much.

689
00:16:18,299 --> 00:16:19,320
Like this brand is awesome.

690
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:20,639
That's not going to do too much.

691
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,460
You want to say this brand or you

692
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:24,500
want to say like, I struggled with

693
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,320
acne for three months and I have

694
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,149
sensitive skin, but this is so

695
00:16:28,149 --> 00:16:30,320
light on my skin, yada, yada.

696
00:16:30,379 --> 00:16:31,639
Find a testimonial like that.

697
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:32,399
It's worth it.

698
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:33,720
You can even take social media

699
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,200
comments and integrate them in,

700
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,500
which this brand did, which I

701
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,519
think is awesome.

702
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:38,980
These are pretty general, but I

703
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:40,340
think it works kind of like for

704
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:41,649
the Instagram feel, general

705
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,399
comments.

706
00:16:43,159 --> 00:16:44,799
But you can just throw them in any

707
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:45,399
email.

708
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:47,100
Over 30,000 five-star reviews

709
00:16:47,149 --> 00:16:48,129
always feature that.

710
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,840
And then look at, there's only two

711
00:16:49,889 --> 00:16:51,580
testimonials here, but they're

712
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:53,399
just really good testimonials that

713
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:55,029
are in-depth and they just prove

714
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:56,879
that people were passionate enough

715
00:16:56,879 --> 00:16:58,629
to sit down, spend five to ten

716
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:00,299
minutes writing a review for this

717
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:00,929
brand.

718
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,340
Okay, they must be good.

719
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:03,679
So I love that.

720
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:05,440
And then us versus them.

721
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,670
This is an email just comparing

722
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:07,880
you versus your customer versus

723
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:09,259
your competitors or other people

724
00:17:09,259 --> 00:17:10,578
in the industry just clearly laid

725
00:17:10,578 --> 00:17:10,869
out.

726
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:12,838
So you probably notice this is a

727
00:17:12,838 --> 00:17:14,848
theme with like our emails is just

728
00:17:14,848 --> 00:17:16,869
displaying things super clearly

729
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,200
for the customer.

730
00:17:18,259 --> 00:17:19,359
This is kind of a tougher one to

731
00:17:19,369 --> 00:17:20,640
execute though because you don't

732
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:21,890
want to beg the customer for the

733
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:22,500
purchase.

734
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:23,848
Be like, these guys suck, but

735
00:17:23,859 --> 00:17:24,578
we're great.

736
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,730
You lose frame and that just

737
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:27,380
increases your sales resistance.

738
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,720
It's kind of like pick me, pick

739
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,220
me.

740
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:31,130
So you want to be careful.

741
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,529
You just want to display the

742
00:17:32,529 --> 00:17:34,230
facts, show them how you defer,

743
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:35,789
and then just help the customer

744
00:17:35,789 --> 00:17:37,440
make the decision rather than be

745
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,250
like, you have to buy from us.

746
00:17:39,339 --> 00:17:40,140
So how?

747
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:40,900
Just use a table.

748
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,450
Just laying out us versus our

749
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:43,339
competitor.

750
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,849
ChatGPT prompt, super easy.

751
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:46,779
This is what we use.

752
00:17:46,839 --> 00:17:47,759
We have this product in this

753
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:48,150
niche.

754
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:49,210
Our product does this.

755
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:50,509
Then you just say, I'm creating an

756
00:17:50,509 --> 00:17:51,480
us versus them email.

757
00:17:51,539 --> 00:17:52,609
My brand versus another brand in

758
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:53,279
the industry.

759
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:54,329
Give me a comparison list

760
00:17:54,349 --> 00:17:55,430
comparing unique selling

761
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:56,839
propositions with my brand versus

762
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,269
competitors to make my brand look

763
00:17:58,279 --> 00:17:58,859
superior.

764
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,859
So here's like an example for food

765
00:18:00,859 --> 00:18:01,839
delivery service.

766
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,160
Here's why we shine.

767
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:03,759
Here's us.

768
00:18:03,819 --> 00:18:05,700
And then here's generic delivery.

769
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:07,880
And then also this one right here.

770
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:08,700
Another table.

771
00:18:08,759 --> 00:18:09,799
Us versus them.

772
00:18:09,859 --> 00:18:10,849
Here's us.

773
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,119
And then here's them like

774
00:18:12,119 --> 00:18:13,920
faceless, bland, making us stand

775
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,339
out.

776
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,279
This is just a unique way to show

777
00:18:16,279 --> 00:18:18,130
your benefits of why somebody

778
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:19,519
should choose you.

779
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:21,960
And then another favorite as well

780
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,319
is myths versus facts.

781
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:24,359
So going over common

782
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:26,049
misconceptions in your industry

783
00:18:26,109 --> 00:18:27,670
versus what the facts actually

784
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:28,119
say.

785
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,559
So there are plenty of common

786
00:18:29,559 --> 00:18:31,190
misconceptions that people can

787
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:32,880
have in your industry like we'll

788
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:33,559
see down here.

789
00:18:33,619 --> 00:18:35,160
Similar to like an FAQ email, we

790
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:36,910
want to just address them straight

791
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:37,240
up.

792
00:18:37,299 --> 00:18:38,359
You can ask your support team for

793
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:39,069
like what are common

794
00:18:39,069 --> 00:18:39,859
misconceptions.

795
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,180
And then, yeah, and the bonus of

796
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:43,740
the myths versus facts email is

797
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:45,359
that myths versus facts is like a

798
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:46,299
cool headline.

799
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:47,319
That's an intriguing topic.

800
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:48,670
People like seeing myths versus

801
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,019
facts like did you know this?

802
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:50,819
This is a myth.

803
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,740
People like knowing that stuff.

804
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,519
So usually overcoming objections,

805
00:18:54,519 --> 00:18:55,730
easy way to make sales.

806
00:18:55,819 --> 00:18:57,329
So just think about your common

807
00:18:57,329 --> 00:18:59,039
misconceptions and compare them

808
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:00,150
side by side versus the

809
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:02,410
misconception versus the fact.

810
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,369
So here's a common chat GPT prompt

811
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:05,599
that you can use.

812
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:06,779
Again, talk about your product and

813
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:07,960
then say I'm creating myths versus

814
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:08,900
facts email campaign.

815
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,839
Give me three myths versus facts

816
00:19:10,849 --> 00:19:12,509
about my industry that I can

817
00:19:12,509 --> 00:19:14,140
include in this email.

818
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,549
Here's an example for the

819
00:19:15,549 --> 00:19:16,400
sunscreen.

820
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,599
Myth, it's impossible to get

821
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:18,740
sunscreen on my kiddos.

822
00:19:18,789 --> 00:19:20,420
Kiddos love applying this thing.

823
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:22,289
Thanks to the super fun texture

824
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:23,200
and consistency.

825
00:19:23,259 --> 00:19:26,339
Sunscreen and sweating don't mix.

826
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,440
And then you could say like our

827
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,279
product does this.

828
00:19:28,339 --> 00:19:29,839
Sunscreen mist always leaves a

829
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:30,619
white cast.

830
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,480
Nope, we don't.

831
00:19:31,539 --> 00:19:32,849
Same sort of thing here.

832
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,640
Facts and then myths right here.

833
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,680
So super clearly laid out, easy

834
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,940
for the customer to see and read.

835
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,930
And then the blog promo.

836
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,109
So most brands will have a blog,

837
00:19:44,109 --> 00:19:45,880
have some sort of blog.

838
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,539
So all we can do is we can create

839
00:19:47,539 --> 00:19:49,220
an email about this blog.

840
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:50,490
Now this is going to make sales

841
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:52,140
because blogs are on your website.

842
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,680
And if you can get people to click

843
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,279
onto a blog, it's super easy for

844
00:19:55,309 --> 00:19:56,829
them at that point to just click

845
00:19:56,839 --> 00:19:58,289
the logo in the top of your

846
00:19:58,289 --> 00:20:00,130
website and then that takes them

847
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:00,980
to go shop.

848
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:03,000
So what we really want to do in

849
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,710
this email is like give a sneak

850
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:06,710
peek on the blog to encourage site

851
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:07,259
clicks.

852
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:08,460
So we want to optimize for the

853
00:20:08,539 --> 00:20:08,880
click.

854
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,079
Just get people to click.

855
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,759
Don't give all the information on

856
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:13,450
the blog just right off the bat.

857
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:15,009
So it's all about engagement,

858
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:16,460
moving people down the funnel.

859
00:20:16,519 --> 00:20:18,019
Someone clicks a blog, there's

860
00:20:18,029 --> 00:20:19,279
more likely to go buy.

861
00:20:19,339 --> 00:20:20,380
And also a good blog, if you're

862
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:21,720
creating good blogs, they're going

863
00:20:21,799 --> 00:20:22,839
to promote your products at the

864
00:20:22,839 --> 00:20:23,410
same time.

865
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:24,490
So it's kind of like a sales

866
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:25,829
letter for people anyways and you

867
00:20:25,829 --> 00:20:27,019
get people to view that.

868
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,289
So it's also a nice change of pace

869
00:20:29,289 --> 00:20:30,970
as well for your list to soft sell

870
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:31,539
them.

871
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:33,490
And like promoting a blog, it's

872
00:20:33,539 --> 00:20:35,670
like non-salesy, but it's going to

873
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:37,900
result in a good chunk of sales.

874
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,059
So you're building goodwill, but

875
00:20:39,059 --> 00:20:40,089
you're still making sales.

876
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:41,539
So how?

877
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,720
Just use a past blog, use an

878
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,329
intriguing headline, and then give

879
00:20:44,329 --> 00:20:45,599
a sneak peek in the email.

880
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,000
Try to really sell the click.

881
00:20:47,059 --> 00:20:48,700
Example right here.

882
00:20:48,759 --> 00:20:50,240
The health benefits of olive oil.

883
00:20:50,299 --> 00:20:51,180
Get the scoop.

884
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,309
You're teasing it right here.

885
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:53,609
And then there are a few

886
00:20:53,609 --> 00:20:54,789
questions, get all the Q&A

887
00:20:54,839 --> 00:20:55,700
goodness here.

888
00:20:55,759 --> 00:20:57,230
They just give a few, they sneak

889
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:58,759
peek it, and then you can go read

890
00:20:58,759 --> 00:21:00,299
more on the site, which is on the

891
00:21:00,299 --> 00:21:00,690
blog.

892
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:01,819
Benefits of the bong.

893
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,400
That's a fun topic.

894
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:05,299
Are they really better than this?

895
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:05,980
Learn more.

896
00:21:06,039 --> 00:21:07,009
Button right at the top of the

897
00:21:07,009 --> 00:21:08,170
email in the header section.

898
00:21:08,259 --> 00:21:10,640
And then here's some examples,

899
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:13,190
again, of educating, giving a

900
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:16,180
little bit of background, and then

901
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,390
learn more.

902
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:18,630
And then promoting some bongs down

903
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:19,460
here at the bottom.

904
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:20,460
Great example.

905
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,420
And then the last one here is

906
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,039
research study highlight, which

907
00:21:24,039 --> 00:21:25,720
just is going to position yourself

908
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,400
as an authority.

909
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:27,700
So we just find a research study

910
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:28,950
published that relates to our

911
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:30,480
niche and promote it in an email.

912
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:32,200
So by promoting research studies,

913
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:33,599
you position your brand as an

914
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:35,170
industry leader, your thought

915
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:36,599
leader, you're on top of these

916
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:37,960
things, all that good stuff.

917
00:21:38,019 --> 00:21:40,130
Now, it doesn't necessarily have

918
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:42,349
to be about your specific product,

919
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:44,160
like a research study on your

920
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,000
product, but it could be one just

921
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,380
in your niche or a material in

922
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,319
your product.

923
00:21:48,579 --> 00:21:49,599
One way or another, you can

924
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:50,960
connect any research study to your

925
00:21:51,029 --> 00:21:51,480
brand.

926
00:21:51,539 --> 00:21:52,809
So you can look up on Google

927
00:21:52,809 --> 00:21:54,380
Scholar or like ChatGPT around

928
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:56,079
your niche, read the abstract,

929
00:21:56,079 --> 00:21:57,710
read the summary, and then just

930
00:21:57,710 --> 00:21:59,240
create an email about that and

931
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,660
link people to that.

932
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,730
Just, again, you might not make a

933
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:04,789
ton of sales directly on this, but

934
00:22:04,789 --> 00:22:06,650
you'll make more sales down the

935
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:08,660
line by telling people about this

936
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:09,359
study.

937
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:10,930
So you can say, we have this

938
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:11,920
product, you can ask ChatGPT to

939
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,480
find this.

940
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:13,319
We're trying to find a

941
00:22:13,349 --> 00:22:14,829
professional third-party research

942
00:22:14,829 --> 00:22:16,160
study related to our niche that we

943
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,799
can educate our customers about.

944
00:22:17,859 --> 00:22:18,980
Can you provide me with five?

945
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:20,160
And then you can click through and

946
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,240
find the one that you like.

947
00:22:21,319 --> 00:22:23,130
So new study reveals the soft link

948
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:24,329
between soft gums and

949
00:22:24,329 --> 00:22:25,390
inflammation.

950
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:26,630
Soft gums, pathway to

951
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:27,589
inflammation.

952
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,140
What we found, here's the risk.

953
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,670
And then position your product as

954
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:31,460
the solution.

955
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,519
So this is linking to the research

956
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:35,190
study, whereas this, now we're

957
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:36,819
promoting our product and how we

958
00:22:36,819 --> 00:22:37,740
overcome this.

959
00:22:37,819 --> 00:22:39,160
Same sort of thing here.

960
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:40,859
Here's a research study.

961
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:41,940
What does the research say?

962
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,779
Read more, read more, read more.

963
00:22:44,059 --> 00:22:45,019
And we're trying to just get

964
00:22:45,019 --> 00:22:46,180
people to read a little bit more

965
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:47,339
and position ourselves as that

966
00:22:47,339 --> 00:22:48,849
industry leader and people and

967
00:22:48,849 --> 00:22:50,609
someone that you guys can trust

968
00:22:50,609 --> 00:22:52,720
because we've done the research.

969
00:22:52,779 --> 00:22:53,950
That's really what we're trying to

970
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:54,200
do.

971
00:22:54,259 --> 00:22:57,319
Oh, actually, we have more.

972
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:58,759
We have the holiday email here.

973
00:22:58,819 --> 00:23:00,390
So we're promoting a fun, a random

974
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:02,009
holiday that we can connect to our

975
00:23:02,009 --> 00:23:03,000
niche somehow.

976
00:23:03,059 --> 00:23:05,299
That's the email, the whole email.

977
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:06,180
So why?

978
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,259
Who doesn't love a holiday?

979
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:08,660
But we're not using typical

980
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:10,240
holidays for these emails.

981
00:23:10,299 --> 00:23:11,039
Although you still can.

982
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,529
You can send, like, Christmas,

983
00:23:12,529 --> 00:23:14,019
Easter emails, all that stuff.

984
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:15,490
But we're using random holidays

985
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:16,859
because there are random ones

986
00:23:16,859 --> 00:23:18,150
every single day that you can

987
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:19,640
easily spin up and connect to one

988
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,730
of your products.

989
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,440
And just create a fun email about

990
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:22,799
it.

991
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:24,220
Connect it to your product.

992
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:25,049
Make it fun.

993
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:26,650
Make it exciting.

994
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,069
So you can use websites like Check

995
00:23:29,069 --> 00:23:31,359
a Day and Blank Calendar Pages to

996
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,740
find holidays.

997
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:35,180
You can also use ChatGPT to say,

998
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,589
are there any random holidays in

999
00:23:36,589 --> 00:23:37,890
this month that we can create an

1000
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:39,019
email campaign out of?

1001
00:23:39,079 --> 00:23:40,000
Here's my product.

1002
00:23:41,059 --> 00:23:42,019
So those are always fun to do.

1003
00:23:42,079 --> 00:23:44,279
So, for example, this is the day.

1004
00:23:44,359 --> 00:23:46,700
It's Irish, National Irish Coffee

1005
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:47,220
Day.

1006
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:48,930
Whether you're in the mood for a

1007
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:51,039
traditional taste, whatever, shop

1008
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:51,500
now.

1009
00:23:51,559 --> 00:23:53,759
So it's just promoting their

1010
00:23:53,779 --> 00:23:56,099
product, which has this.

1011
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,440
Easy way to just promote your

1012
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,069
products without being too salesy

1013
00:23:59,069 --> 00:24:00,640
and giving people a reason to shop

1014
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,380
your item.

1015
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,269
Same thing.

1016
00:24:02,339 --> 00:24:03,259
National Hiking Day.

1017
00:24:03,319 --> 00:24:04,440
View this trail.

1018
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,000
And this brand is probably getting

1019
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,470
paid for the amount of clicks that

1020
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:08,119
they get.

1021
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:08,900
Same sort of thing.

1022
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,779
National Hiking Day.

1023
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:10,859
You can do this for clothing

1024
00:24:10,859 --> 00:24:11,319
brands.

1025
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:12,259
If you sell hiking gear.

1026
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:13,779
National Hiking Day.

1027
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:15,220
Shop this.

1028
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:15,859
Okay.

1029
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,869
So here are 15 more campaign ideas

1030
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:18,940
that you can use.

1031
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,519
Progress update.

1032
00:24:20,579 --> 00:24:22,059
So share, like, recent updates in

1033
00:24:22,059 --> 00:24:22,680
the brand.

1034
00:24:22,819 --> 00:24:23,890
We've seen those perform well.

1035
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,410
It really gets people close to the

1036
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:25,849
brand.

1037
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:27,829
Keeps the subscribers informed and

1038
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:28,539
engaged.

1039
00:24:28,599 --> 00:24:29,400
You can do a customer

1040
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:30,839
transformation, similar to the

1041
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:32,259
testimonial, but really show,

1042
00:24:32,259 --> 00:24:33,430
like, a before and after of

1043
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:34,140
somebody.

1044
00:24:35,339 --> 00:24:36,400
That's kind of what we have here,

1045
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,230
before versus after.

1046
00:24:37,339 --> 00:24:38,990
The effectiveness of your product

1047
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:40,579
before and after being used.

1048
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,000
Puzzles and riddles.

1049
00:24:42,059 --> 00:24:43,009
That's something that you can do

1050
00:24:43,009 --> 00:24:43,950
with, like, brain teasers or

1051
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:44,440
puzzles.

1052
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:46,289
It's a fun break from the usual

1053
00:24:46,329 --> 00:24:46,789
content.

1054
00:24:46,859 --> 00:24:48,119
Note from the founder.

1055
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:49,619
These absolutely crush it.

1056
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,990
Just like, hey, this is X, the

1057
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,240
founder of, I just wanted to

1058
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,710
remind you of this, yada, yada,

1059
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:54,230
yada.

1060
00:24:54,299 --> 00:24:55,519
Gift guide.

1061
00:24:55,579 --> 00:24:56,559
No matter the time of the year,

1062
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:57,579
you can create a gift guide.

1063
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,150
Like, hey, is it have a friend's

1064
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:00,829
birthday coming up or marriage, a

1065
00:25:00,829 --> 00:25:01,559
wedding.

1066
00:25:01,619 --> 00:25:02,930
Here's a gift guide.

1067
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,119
This is perfect for this person,

1068
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:04,740
yada, yada.

1069
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:05,759
Treat yourself.

1070
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:06,339
Kind of similar.

1071
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,200
These perform well.

1072
00:25:07,259 --> 00:25:08,329
Hey, you deserve it.

1073
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,200
Buy.

1074
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:11,089
Buy for yourself.

1075
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:11,740
You know you want it.

1076
00:25:11,799 --> 00:25:12,339
Something like that.

1077
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,690
Social proof email, like media

1078
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,250
publications, where you've been in

1079
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:17,019
the media, press coverage,

1080
00:25:17,019 --> 00:25:18,390
interviews, articles, whatever

1081
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:18,920
like that.

1082
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:20,289
Good form of social proof there.

1083
00:25:20,359 --> 00:25:21,460
Behind the scenes.

1084
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:22,829
Take pictures, like, behind the

1085
00:25:22,839 --> 00:25:23,839
scenes in your factory or

1086
00:25:23,839 --> 00:25:24,950
whatever's happening.

1087
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:26,140
That's an email that you can send.

1088
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,410
Tips and tricks is another

1089
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:28,839
valuable one that you can do in

1090
00:25:28,839 --> 00:25:30,500
your niche or your industry.

1091
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:32,039
UGC content.

1092
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,890
So anybody who's created content

1093
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:35,509
for you, just feature what they've

1094
00:25:35,509 --> 00:25:36,339
put together.

1095
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,420
You can have a sneak peek for

1096
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,880
upcoming products, features, or

1097
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,180
content that's coming up.

1098
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,549
You can do flashback Friday or

1099
00:25:41,549 --> 00:25:42,819
throwback Thursday, like

1100
00:25:42,819 --> 00:25:44,670
historical content from the brand.

1101
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:46,049
Like, this was us one year ago.

1102
00:25:46,119 --> 00:25:47,819
That's something fun that you can

1103
00:25:47,819 --> 00:25:48,160
do.

1104
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:49,440
Staff picks.

1105
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,029
So here's what we recommend.

1106
00:25:51,099 --> 00:25:52,059
Anything like that.

1107
00:25:52,119 --> 00:25:53,579
And then also, like, brand values.

1108
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,789
This is a cool email that you can

1109
00:25:54,809 --> 00:25:56,019
do where it's just like, this is

1110
00:25:56,089 --> 00:25:57,069
what we optimize for.

1111
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,400
This is what's important to us.

1112
00:25:58,460 --> 00:25:59,400
Are you with us?

1113
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:00,859
Just to remind people of your

1114
00:26:00,859 --> 00:26:01,500
message.

1115
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,079
So, that was a lot.

1116
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:05,359
This was definitely a longer

1117
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:05,779
email.

1118
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,369
But hopefully that gave you

1119
00:26:07,369 --> 00:26:09,259
unlimited email content ideas to

1120
00:26:09,259 --> 00:26:10,180
choose from.

1121
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,339
That's kind of my goal here.

1122
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,859
But I'm going to show you how to

1123
00:26:12,859 --> 00:26:14,450
get even more for you here in the

1124
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:15,380
next module.

1125
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,329
But these are some of my

1126
00:26:16,329 --> 00:26:16,950
favorites.

1127
00:26:17,019 --> 00:26:17,759
Use them.

1128
00:26:17,819 --> 00:26:20,599
Reuse the ones that work.

1129
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:22,359
And you're going to be printing.

1130
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:23,019
All right.

1131
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:24,000
So, I hope you got value from

1132
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:24,299
that.

1133
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:25,880
And let's move on to the next one.

1134
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:27,609
Okay.

1135
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,079
So, we have talked about the micro

1136
00:26:29,079 --> 00:26:30,440
topics and how we want to educate

1137
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:31,240
the customer.

1138
00:26:31,299 --> 00:26:32,289
And we don't just want to annoy

1139
00:26:32,289 --> 00:26:33,390
our list with discount sales,

1140
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:34,730
sales, sales, sales, sales, and

1141
00:26:34,789 --> 00:26:35,339
all this stuff.

1142
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,150
So, I'm going to give you 29

1143
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:38,859
non-discount email frameworks and

1144
00:26:38,859 --> 00:26:40,279
then some examples for a few of

1145
00:26:40,279 --> 00:26:41,940
them, about half of them, giving

1146
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:43,380
two examples for each.

1147
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,259
So, that is what we are doing.

1148
00:26:45,319 --> 00:26:46,440
These are things that you can plug

1149
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:47,210
and play and copy.

1150
00:26:47,299 --> 00:26:48,710
You could literally just follow

1151
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:50,130
these frameworks and then just

1152
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:51,539
repeat it over and over again if

1153
00:26:51,549 --> 00:26:52,400
you wanted to.

1154
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:53,970
But later, I'm also going to show

1155
00:26:54,019 --> 00:26:55,269
you more ways to get more ideas.

1156
00:26:55,339 --> 00:26:57,230
So, 29 non-discount email

1157
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:59,119
frameworks and examples.

1158
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:00,059
Let's get into it.

1159
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:01,500
So, I already showed this.

1160
00:27:01,529 --> 00:27:02,279
I already went over this.

1161
00:27:02,339 --> 00:27:03,849
Education plus positioning equals

1162
00:27:03,849 --> 00:27:05,140
sales without discounts.

1163
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,089
We want to educate the customer on

1164
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:08,960
a problem that they could have a

1165
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,670
process that we follow or a

1166
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:12,920
solution that we have to any of

1167
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,119
these problems.

1168
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:15,670
And then position our product just

1169
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:16,630
as that solution.

1170
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:18,579
So, educate and then also promote

1171
00:27:18,579 --> 00:27:19,880
our product subtly.

1172
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:21,829
So, these are all of the campaign

1173
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:22,500
ideas.

1174
00:27:22,819 --> 00:27:24,359
You can screenshot this, do

1175
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:26,000
whatever you want, take the

1176
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,039
document, which you have provided

1177
00:27:28,039 --> 00:27:29,779
for you, and use these over and

1178
00:27:29,779 --> 00:27:30,779
over again.

1179
00:27:30,839 --> 00:27:31,960
You can lean on some more than

1180
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:32,480
others.

1181
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:33,509
Like, there are a ton of different

1182
00:27:33,509 --> 00:27:34,509
benefit emails you could do, a ton

1183
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:35,470
of different feature emails you

1184
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:36,630
could do, a ton of different

1185
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:37,930
frequently asked question emails

1186
00:27:38,049 --> 00:27:39,259
you could do, all that stuff.

1187
00:27:39,319 --> 00:27:40,420
Same as, like, trending and

1188
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:41,700
testimonials, us versus them,

1189
00:27:41,769 --> 00:27:42,720
myths versus facts.

1190
00:27:42,779 --> 00:27:43,990
These are all emails that you can

1191
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:44,910
continue to repeat.

1192
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:45,900
So, let's break down a few of

1193
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:46,980
them, some of my favorites.

1194
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:49,039
So, first one is one benefit.

1195
00:27:49,099 --> 00:27:50,880
So, that's the whole thing of the

1196
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:51,440
email.

1197
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,859
We are focusing on one singular

1198
00:27:52,859 --> 00:27:54,329
benefit that our product brings

1199
00:27:54,329 --> 00:27:55,299
for the customer.

1200
00:27:55,359 --> 00:27:56,710
Right off the top of your head,

1201
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:58,289
for your product, you should come

1202
00:27:58,289 --> 00:27:59,910
up with 10 single benefits of,

1203
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:01,519
like, going with you, going with

1204
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:02,420
your product.

1205
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,119
And so, let's, you can create 10

1206
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:05,750
emails off of that, just focusing

1207
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:06,440
one by one.

1208
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,250
We don't want to show everything

1209
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:09,619
all at once for a lot of our

1210
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,529
emails because then the customer

1211
00:28:11,529 --> 00:28:13,470
will kind of, like, forget all of

1212
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:14,089
them.

1213
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,549
We just want to, like, drill into

1214
00:28:15,549 --> 00:28:16,740
their head one at a time.

1215
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,390
The customer doesn't have a big

1216
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:19,480
attention span, so we need to go

1217
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,069
one at a time.

1218
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:21,359
So, why?

1219
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:22,809
By highlighting the one benefit,

1220
00:28:22,809 --> 00:28:23,799
easy for them to know.

1221
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,920
So, we just want to dive deeper on

1222
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:28,089
our product, whatever it may be,

1223
00:28:28,089 --> 00:28:30,140
and earn those trust points.

1224
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:30,720
And so, how?

1225
00:28:31,299 --> 00:28:33,420
Just write out 10 of your

1226
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:36,180
benefits, and then just create an

1227
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:38,160
email about each one.

1228
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:39,180
If you want to have a chat GPT

1229
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:40,299
prompt to help you come up with

1230
00:28:40,299 --> 00:28:41,650
some of these, you could just say,

1231
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:42,990
we have this product for this

1232
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:44,019
e-commerce store.

1233
00:28:44,079 --> 00:28:45,119
Our product is put as much

1234
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:46,450
information as you can about our

1235
00:28:46,549 --> 00:28:47,140
product.

1236
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:47,759
It's verified.

1237
00:28:47,819 --> 00:28:49,089
You ought to take information from

1238
00:28:49,089 --> 00:28:50,160
your website if you can.

1239
00:28:50,519 --> 00:28:51,500
You could say, give me a list of

1240
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:52,769
10 specific benefits about this

1241
00:28:52,769 --> 00:28:53,259
product.

1242
00:28:53,319 --> 00:28:54,700
So, kind of to show you what I

1243
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:56,250
mean, I have a couple examples

1244
00:28:56,279 --> 00:28:56,700
here.

1245
00:28:56,759 --> 00:28:58,250
So, we have this example from

1246
00:28:58,250 --> 00:28:59,079
Magic Mind.

1247
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:00,420
Super simple email.

1248
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,839
Banish festive fogginess.

1249
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,319
Has a bit of information.

1250
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:05,779
And then, just showing, like,

1251
00:29:05,779 --> 00:29:06,980
step-by-step how to use our

1252
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:07,569
product.

1253
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,630
Has cool branding.

1254
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,039
Good design.

1255
00:29:10,099 --> 00:29:10,859
Releases dopamine.

1256
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,359
And that single benefit is just

1257
00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:13,660
conquering brain fog.

1258
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,920
That's the one benefit they

1259
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,099
decided to drill in on.

1260
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:17,779
And then, we have this one from

1261
00:29:17,779 --> 00:29:18,160
Seed.

1262
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:19,569
Their single benefit is getting

1263
00:29:19,569 --> 00:29:20,279
rid of bloat.

1264
00:29:20,339 --> 00:29:22,049
All they do is they say 61% of

1265
00:29:22,049 --> 00:29:23,710
people experience digestive

1266
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:24,619
discomfort.

1267
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,220
The good news, we have strains

1268
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:27,799
that are proven to reduce your

1269
00:29:27,819 --> 00:29:29,230
bloating in two weeks.

1270
00:29:29,319 --> 00:29:30,799
That's the whole email.

1271
00:29:30,859 --> 00:29:32,190
And then, we have just, like, some

1272
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:33,349
testimonials right here.

1273
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:35,420
It's just super, duper, duper

1274
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:36,220
simple.

1275
00:29:36,279 --> 00:29:37,559
This is the benefit.

1276
00:29:37,619 --> 00:29:38,900
Use our product.

1277
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,000
And ours is, like, the solution.

1278
00:29:41,059 --> 00:29:43,069
So, that's just the one benefit

1279
00:29:43,069 --> 00:29:43,720
email.

1280
00:29:43,779 --> 00:29:45,299
Very nice and simple.

1281
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,019
Very similar.

1282
00:29:47,079 --> 00:29:48,339
This one is one feature.

1283
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,890
So, rather than looking at, like,

1284
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:51,519
a benefit of your product, we want

1285
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:53,099
to focus on a feature of our

1286
00:29:53,099 --> 00:29:53,670
product.

1287
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:55,279
Focus on the benefits, not the

1288
00:29:55,309 --> 00:29:56,019
features.

1289
00:29:56,079 --> 00:29:56,680
You always hear that.

1290
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:57,569
Focus on the benefits, not the

1291
00:29:57,599 --> 00:29:58,019
features.

1292
00:29:58,079 --> 00:29:59,720
That's a flawed claim that gets

1293
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:00,750
thrown around.

1294
00:30:00,859 --> 00:30:01,559
People want to know what's in

1295
00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:02,099
their product.

1296
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,099
They want to know, like, the

1297
00:30:03,099 --> 00:30:04,140
science behind it when they're

1298
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:04,829
making decisions.

1299
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:06,059
Especially, again, if it's a

1300
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:06,829
health product.

1301
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,319
Even if it's, even if you have a

1302
00:30:08,319 --> 00:30:09,839
clothing product, you can do

1303
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:11,099
different features.

1304
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,380
Like, our pocket.

1305
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,680
You can have a whole email on,

1306
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,099
like, your front pocket and how

1307
00:30:15,170 --> 00:30:16,319
much space it has in it.

1308
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,990
Or your zippers, like, how your

1309
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:18,859
zippers work.

1310
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,619
You can, all sorts of features.

1311
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,210
Because those have benefits tied

1312
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:22,880
into them.

1313
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:25,049
And so, people just love, people

1314
00:30:25,049 --> 00:30:27,220
love features of your product.

1315
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:29,039
And so, like, why do you think

1316
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:31,000
that every software out there has

1317
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,099
the word, like, AI thrown on every

1318
00:30:33,099 --> 00:30:34,140
landing page?

1319
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:35,859
They, they just, if you look at

1320
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:37,559
any software, guarantee, go to

1321
00:30:37,559 --> 00:30:38,500
their website.

1322
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:39,660
They have AI in, like, one of the

1323
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:40,279
main points.

1324
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:41,109
Because it's a feature.

1325
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:42,819
And people like features and stuff

1326
00:30:42,829 --> 00:30:43,519
like that.

1327
00:30:43,579 --> 00:30:45,410
So, like, every protein powder

1328
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:47,650
will say the benefit, gain muscle.

1329
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:50,279
But, that's just so basic.

1330
00:30:50,339 --> 00:30:51,730
We want our features to make our

1331
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:53,140
product, like, unique.

1332
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,859
Because if you were to, say, like,

1333
00:30:54,869 --> 00:30:56,759
gain muscle, which is the benefit.

1334
00:30:56,819 --> 00:30:58,680
That's the benefit, gain muscle.

1335
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:00,309
But not everyone is going to say

1336
00:31:00,309 --> 00:31:02,019
pre-digested whey protein.

1337
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:03,380
Which people are going to find

1338
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:04,569
unique and want to buy.

1339
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,519
And so, that's really what can set

1340
00:31:06,519 --> 00:31:07,759
you over the edge.

1341
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:08,890
Your features are what make you

1342
00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:09,440
different.

1343
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,119
All protein powders, they do the

1344
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:11,880
same thing.

1345
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:12,839
They have the same benefit.

1346
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:15,829
It's all just to build muscle.

1347
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:17,650
But each one has different little

1348
00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:19,799
mechanisms and features within it.

1349
00:31:19,859 --> 00:31:20,930
Which make it special and why

1350
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:22,130
people will end up buying from

1351
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:22,900
them instead.

1352
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,279
So, how, what you may think about

1353
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:27,509
your product as common sense may

1354
00:31:27,549 --> 00:31:29,099
be unknown to your customer.

1355
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,589
So, if you've been in, to go back

1356
00:31:30,589 --> 00:31:32,089
to the supplement, like, like,

1357
00:31:32,119 --> 00:31:32,779
protein.

1358
00:31:32,839 --> 00:31:34,259
If you've been in the industry for

1359
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:35,849
30 years, you've been lifting

1360
00:31:35,849 --> 00:31:36,910
weights for so long.

1361
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,069
And some of the stuff you think is

1362
00:31:38,089 --> 00:31:39,480
common sense, like, for example,

1363
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,380
like, what creatine does for your

1364
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:41,759
muscles.

1365
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,549
Or what instantized creatine is.

1366
00:31:43,619 --> 00:31:45,490
Or why you need to take creatine

1367
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:47,500
every day instead of just taking

1368
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,140
it every now and again.

1369
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,579
That could be common sense to you.

1370
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,940
But to the everyday person who

1371
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:53,539
just found out about creatine last

1372
00:31:53,539 --> 00:31:55,069
week, they don't know that.

1373
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:57,009
So, how you can do this to really,

1374
00:31:57,009 --> 00:31:58,900
like, understand, like, your

1375
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:00,730
features is just write out every

1376
00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:02,700
material or ingredient or a little

1377
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:03,599
feature.

1378
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:04,430
Like, your pockets.

1379
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:05,460
Write it all out.

1380
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:06,349
Each one of those can be a

1381
00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:07,519
singular benefit that you can

1382
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:08,539
highlight in an email.

1383
00:32:08,599 --> 00:32:10,099
So, here's some examples.

1384
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,210
So, for this product, one of their

1385
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:14,079
main ingredients is Tamanu oil.

1386
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,079
Never heard of it.

1387
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:16,759
Can't really read this.

1388
00:32:16,819 --> 00:32:17,839
Kind of difficult to see.

1389
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:19,539
But it's pretty much just saying

1390
00:32:19,589 --> 00:32:21,400
what, like, unlock the power of

1391
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,220
Tamanu oil.

1392
00:32:22,279 --> 00:32:23,529
Hopefully, I'm pronouncing that

1393
00:32:23,529 --> 00:32:23,920
right.

1394
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:25,380
So, you're just breaking down one

1395
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:26,740
feature of your product and what

1396
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:27,700
makes it special.

1397
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:29,420
That's what it's going to sell

1398
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:29,759
you.

1399
00:32:29,819 --> 00:32:31,839
And then, and they even break it

1400
00:32:31,839 --> 00:32:34,000
further and say, like, what are

1401
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,119
the features of Tamanu oil?

1402
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:37,599
So, that's super effective.

1403
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:38,839
And then, also, like this one,

1404
00:32:38,859 --> 00:32:39,859
what we mean by instantized

1405
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:40,420
creatine.

1406
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,740
So, creatine is instantized.

1407
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:45,680
That's its feature of the product.

1408
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:47,160
And so, you're just breaking down.

1409
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:47,779
What is it?

1410
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:49,829
Usual creatine does this, but

1411
00:32:49,829 --> 00:32:51,619
instantized does this.

1412
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,660
And that makes it this.

1413
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,230
And here's how it can benefit you.

1414
00:32:55,299 --> 00:32:56,720
So, those are the one feature

1415
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,430
campaigns.

1416
00:32:58,079 --> 00:33:00,400
Then, we have FAQ, which is very

1417
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,299
similar to the others.

1418
00:33:02,359 --> 00:33:03,420
And you can have a ton of these.

1419
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,299
So, it's just what.

1420
00:33:04,359 --> 00:33:05,480
We're going to find a common

1421
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:06,849
question from our customer and

1422
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:08,200
then directly address it.

1423
00:33:08,259 --> 00:33:10,920
FAQ emails that are quick.

1424
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:12,069
You can have FAQ emails that

1425
00:33:12,089 --> 00:33:13,519
answer multiple questions as long

1426
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:14,410
as they're quick.

1427
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:16,240
But for longer ones, I like to do

1428
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,789
a full email out of this.

1429
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,380
So, again, what may be common

1430
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:20,880
sense to you may not be for your

1431
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:21,640
customers.

1432
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,799
So, rather than drown out all of

1433
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:27,490
our FAQs and making them all kind

1434
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,079
of random and creating a super

1435
00:33:29,079 --> 00:33:29,599
long email,

1436
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:30,779
we just want to focus on one to

1437
00:33:30,859 --> 00:33:32,170
really get our point across.

1438
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,539
This way, the customer has no

1439
00:33:33,539 --> 00:33:35,059
other choice but to agree because

1440
00:33:35,059 --> 00:33:36,400
we laid out all the facts.

1441
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:37,799
Just think of yourself as an alien

1442
00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:39,130
on Mars who just came to Earth and

1443
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:40,529
found out about your product.

1444
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,740
What would they ask?

1445
00:33:41,799 --> 00:33:43,190
Gather data from your support

1446
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:43,619
team.

1447
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,660
Ask your support.

1448
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,140
Like, what are the emails that we

1449
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:47,650
get questions about the most?

1450
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:49,619
And then create emails out of each

1451
00:33:49,619 --> 00:33:50,059
one.

1452
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:51,960
You can also use ChatGPT.

1453
00:33:52,019 --> 00:33:52,579
Here's a prompt.

1454
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,490
We have this product and this for

1455
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:56,859
this brand.

1456
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,660
Our product does this.

1457
00:33:58,720 --> 00:33:59,970
Give me a list of 50 frequently

1458
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:01,369
asked questions about our niche to

1459
00:34:01,369 --> 00:34:03,109
customers that may have no idea we

1460
00:34:03,109 --> 00:34:03,539
exist.

1461
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:04,990
So, look at both of these

1462
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:05,720
examples.

1463
00:34:05,839 --> 00:34:07,460
When can I expect to see creatines

1464
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:07,839
of X?

1465
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:10,099
That is one frequently asked

1466
00:34:10,119 --> 00:34:11,179
question.

1467
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:12,340
How soon can I see results?

1468
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,260
Same as this one.

1469
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,960
Can teeth whitening harm your

1470
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:15,579
teeth?

1471
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:17,460
Very common question, I'm sure,

1472
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:19,139
for teeth whitening brands.

1473
00:34:19,659 --> 00:34:21,530
And so, for this one, you're just

1474
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:23,280
going into depth on this is when

1475
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,050
you can see it and this is why.

1476
00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:26,420
And here are some tips.

1477
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,500
And then recommend it for you.

1478
00:34:28,559 --> 00:34:29,710
Super simple.

1479
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:30,880
Overcome that objection.

1480
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:32,360
And then same thing for here.

1481
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:33,719
The truth behind teeth whitening.

1482
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:34,980
Here's the problem with most.

1483
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:36,519
The thing is, like, most teeth

1484
00:34:36,519 --> 00:34:38,010
whitening, they use this.

1485
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:38,900
So it can be harmful.

1486
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,440
But ours doesn't.

1487
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:41,809
We are the solution.

1488
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:43,550
See what I mean here by tying your

1489
00:34:43,559 --> 00:34:44,840
product in as the solution?

1490
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:46,800
That is what can really set you

1491
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:47,980
over the edge.

1492
00:34:48,059 --> 00:34:49,119
And then adding some social proof.

1493
00:34:49,179 --> 00:34:51,130
So there's that one.

1494
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:52,480
Now let's go to what's inside.

1495
00:34:52,539 --> 00:34:54,199
So if you sell, like, a package or

1496
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:55,659
a consumable good, explain

1497
00:34:55,659 --> 00:34:57,179
everything that comes with the

1498
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:57,760
order.

1499
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:58,760
That's super simple.

1500
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:00,079
For example, your ingredients.

1501
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,199
Kind of like we talked about

1502
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:01,739
features.

1503
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,699
Let's talk about what's inside.

1504
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:05,119
And, like, what maybe you throw

1505
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:06,539
extra things into your order.

1506
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:07,829
If you have a bundle, explain each

1507
00:35:07,829 --> 00:35:09,110
thing that comes in the bundle.

1508
00:35:09,179 --> 00:35:10,469
This is a great email that you can

1509
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:10,820
send.

1510
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:11,989
So people just want to know

1511
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:13,500
exactly what they're getting.

1512
00:35:13,559 --> 00:35:14,489
It helps clear some of the

1513
00:35:14,489 --> 00:35:15,800
uncertainty that someone could

1514
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:16,849
have before ordering.

1515
00:35:17,659 --> 00:35:18,989
We want to just clear as much

1516
00:35:18,989 --> 00:35:20,659
uncertainty up as possible.

1517
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:21,989
So some brands, for example,

1518
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,559
they'll give, like, free product

1519
00:35:23,559 --> 00:35:24,840
guides with every purchase.

1520
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:26,789
That's, like, a free course with,

1521
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:27,960
like, whatever.

1522
00:35:28,019 --> 00:35:29,090
But then they don't even tell

1523
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:30,320
their customers about it.

1524
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:31,469
That's a nice little bonus to get

1525
00:35:31,469 --> 00:35:32,500
somebody over the edge.

1526
00:35:32,559 --> 00:35:34,000
Be like, hey, if you order today,

1527
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,480
we'll give you this free guide.

1528
00:35:35,539 --> 00:35:36,409
And then someone's like, oh, I

1529
00:35:36,409 --> 00:35:37,139
want this free guide.

1530
00:35:37,199 --> 00:35:38,579
That right there can be included

1531
00:35:38,579 --> 00:35:40,280
in, like, a what's inside email.

1532
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,570
Just like, hey, when you order

1533
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:42,739
this, you also get this.

1534
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,730
If you sell consumable products,

1535
00:35:44,739 --> 00:35:46,559
you can list everything that you

1536
00:35:46,559 --> 00:35:47,389
have in it.

1537
00:35:47,659 --> 00:35:48,329
People want to know exactly what

1538
00:35:48,329 --> 00:35:49,119
they're putting in their body.

1539
00:35:49,179 --> 00:35:50,449
So just unpack everything in your

1540
00:35:50,449 --> 00:35:51,739
bundle of product and display it

1541
00:35:51,739 --> 00:35:52,980
in, like, a list format.

1542
00:35:53,039 --> 00:35:54,159
Just make sure it's skimmable and

1543
00:35:54,159 --> 00:35:54,780
easy to read.

1544
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,420
So here's, like, an unboxing for

1545
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:56,960
AG1.

1546
00:35:57,019 --> 00:35:57,880
Massive brand.

1547
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:59,059
This is a great email.

1548
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:00,590
There's so much to look forward

1549
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:00,920
to.

1550
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:01,739
You get this.

1551
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,659
You get this.

1552
00:36:02,719 --> 00:36:03,739
You get a shaker bottle.

1553
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:04,789
You get packs.

1554
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:05,579
Yada, yada, yada.

1555
00:36:05,639 --> 00:36:07,719
Super simple, super easy.

1556
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:08,659
And then this one for supplement

1557
00:36:08,659 --> 00:36:09,000
brand.

1558
00:36:09,059 --> 00:36:10,690
Here are the seven ingredients

1559
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:12,179
that are in our product.

1560
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:13,280
Just listed out here.

1561
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:15,659
Super easy, skimmable, and easy to

1562
00:36:15,659 --> 00:36:16,900
just check out.

1563
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:18,199
Super good email.

1564
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:19,559
Clears up a ton of uncertainty.

1565
00:36:19,619 --> 00:36:21,519
Another one is how it's made.

1566
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:22,900
So an email just explaining the

1567
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:24,599
creation process of your product.

1568
00:36:24,659 --> 00:36:25,679
Similar to before.

1569
00:36:25,739 --> 00:36:27,179
Maybe common sense to you.

1570
00:36:27,239 --> 00:36:29,130
Maybe not be for your average

1571
00:36:29,179 --> 00:36:30,119
customer.

1572
00:36:30,179 --> 00:36:31,219
For example, if you have a

1573
00:36:31,219 --> 00:36:32,670
filtration process for, like, a

1574
00:36:32,679 --> 00:36:34,250
certain ingredient, like beer.

1575
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,539
These aren't emails, but I thought

1576
00:36:35,539 --> 00:36:36,679
these were great graphics.

1577
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:39,389
If you have, like, a filtration

1578
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,369
process that, like, you – the

1579
00:36:41,369 --> 00:36:43,449
process takes it through, like,

1580
00:36:43,449 --> 00:36:45,449
three different filters to, like,

1581
00:36:45,449 --> 00:36:46,630
make sure it's safe.

1582
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:47,769
But then you don't tell customers.

1583
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:48,789
They're going to always question

1584
00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:49,730
the safety of your product.

1585
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,039
But that right there, just by

1586
00:36:51,039 --> 00:36:52,550
explaining how it's made, here's

1587
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:53,840
how we take it from here.

1588
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:54,840
It proves the quality of your

1589
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:55,250
product.

1590
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,469
And it's also super interesting to

1591
00:36:56,519 --> 00:36:57,210
see that laid out.

1592
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,690
This also gives your product a

1593
00:36:58,690 --> 00:37:00,239
story and adds background to the

1594
00:37:00,239 --> 00:37:01,719
product that the customer will

1595
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:03,159
soon have in their hands.

1596
00:37:03,239 --> 00:37:04,119
So when they look at their

1597
00:37:04,119 --> 00:37:05,550
product, it's not just, like, this

1598
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:06,460
appeared in my hand.

1599
00:37:06,639 --> 00:37:07,659
It has a story.

1600
00:37:07,719 --> 00:37:09,380
It went from here to here to here,

1601
00:37:09,389 --> 00:37:10,780
and now it's in my hand.

1602
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,579
It's a lot – that's a lot cooler,

1603
00:37:12,579 --> 00:37:14,210
and that's – it creates a full

1604
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:15,469
customer journey.

1605
00:37:15,539 --> 00:37:17,639
So – and then how.

1606
00:37:17,699 --> 00:37:19,079
Just list out every step of your

1607
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:20,750
process from material gathering to

1608
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:22,030
the factory to warehouse to

1609
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:22,739
shipment.

1610
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,920
Talk about the process or

1611
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:25,170
highlight parts about it,

1612
00:37:25,269 --> 00:37:26,869
different ones like this, like,

1613
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:28,550
step-by-step, lay them out so the

1614
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:29,789
customer can see it.

1615
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:30,380
Super interesting.

1616
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:33,019
And then one, how to use.

1617
00:37:33,079 --> 00:37:34,099
Again, this is super

1618
00:37:34,099 --> 00:37:35,460
straightforward but super

1619
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:36,269
effective.

1620
00:37:36,639 --> 00:37:37,739
So just a step-by-step product of

1621
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:38,760
how to use your product.

1622
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:40,119
So why?

1623
00:37:40,179 --> 00:37:41,190
We just want to be as clear as

1624
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:42,559
possible with our prospects.

1625
00:37:42,659 --> 00:37:44,500
Remove as much uncertainty as

1626
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:45,329
possible.

1627
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:46,519
We don't want to leave things to

1628
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:47,719
their imagination because then

1629
00:37:47,719 --> 00:37:48,929
they're going to overcomplicate

1630
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:49,440
things.

1631
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:50,699
We all know you love to

1632
00:37:50,699 --> 00:37:52,360
overcomplicate things.

1633
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:53,829
So let's remove uncertainty by

1634
00:37:53,829 --> 00:37:55,639
explaining how to use our product.

1635
00:37:55,699 --> 00:37:56,820
And a bonus if you can explain,

1636
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,050
like, how to get the most out of

1637
00:37:58,050 --> 00:37:59,769
your product, which we can talk

1638
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,980
about here with this example.

1639
00:38:02,039 --> 00:38:02,619
But how?

1640
00:38:02,679 --> 00:38:03,849
Just use your product yourself and

1641
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,130
share the steps that you follow.

1642
00:38:05,639 --> 00:38:06,500
If you have a tough time

1643
00:38:06,519 --> 00:38:07,909
explaining it, you can alter this

1644
00:38:07,909 --> 00:38:09,070
to be how to get the most out of

1645
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:09,880
your product.

1646
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:11,340
Or if you sell clothing, you could

1647
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:12,590
say, like, how to style your

1648
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:13,199
product.

1649
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:14,469
Those are all things that you can

1650
00:38:14,469 --> 00:38:14,739
do.

1651
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,260
So a couple examples.

1652
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,760
How to pull a shot of espresso.

1653
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:19,400
So probably a common objection for

1654
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,039
this brand is just, like, I don't

1655
00:38:21,039 --> 00:38:22,280
know how to properly.

1656
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:24,000
Why would I buy this product if I

1657
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:25,750
don't even really know how to do

1658
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:26,320
this?

1659
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:28,260
And so they have, like, an article

1660
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:30,130
of doing, like, how to pull a shot

1661
00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:31,019
of espresso.

1662
00:38:31,099 --> 00:38:32,440
What's the best recipe?

1663
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,699
So people can know how much, like,

1664
00:38:34,719 --> 00:38:36,829
ratio to have different stuff and

1665
00:38:36,869 --> 00:38:38,239
how to prepare it.

1666
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:40,750
Super effective in getting people

1667
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:43,110
to realize it's not that hard and

1668
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:44,889
get them to purchase.

1669
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,460
And then how to get the most out

1670
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:47,510
of your product.

1671
00:38:47,579 --> 00:38:48,300
So even if it's super

1672
00:38:48,389 --> 00:38:49,630
straightforward, like, how to

1673
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:51,130
spray a perfume, that's super

1674
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:52,889
straightforward for, like, how to

1675
00:38:52,889 --> 00:38:53,199
use it.

1676
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:54,599
Just say how to get the most out

1677
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:55,039
of it.

1678
00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:56,989
So tip number one, protect your

1679
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,900
perfume from direct light.

1680
00:38:58,960 --> 00:38:59,949
Avoid the bathroom.

1681
00:39:00,019 --> 00:39:01,389
Store in a fragrance in a dry

1682
00:39:01,389 --> 00:39:01,920
place.

1683
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,019
Keep your perfume in a place with

1684
00:39:03,019 --> 00:39:04,000
consistent temperature.

1685
00:39:04,239 --> 00:39:05,599
Like, these are all tips where it

1686
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:07,019
can prove to people that, like,

1687
00:39:07,019 --> 00:39:08,670
it's just bringing value to them.

1688
00:39:08,739 --> 00:39:09,659
Building trust points.

1689
00:39:09,719 --> 00:39:10,820
You're not heavy selling them.

1690
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,260
So those are all very effective.

1691
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:15,239
And then we have back in stock.

1692
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:16,840
So if you have a product back in

1693
00:39:16,869 --> 00:39:18,699
stock, create a full email or two

1694
00:39:18,699 --> 00:39:19,369
about it.

1695
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:20,670
Just let people know of that.

1696
00:39:20,739 --> 00:39:22,219
But even if you don't have a

1697
00:39:22,219 --> 00:39:24,130
product back in stock, just get

1698
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:25,670
some new products in.

1699
00:39:25,739 --> 00:39:26,909
Maybe put, like, an extra shipment

1700
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:28,039
in, even though you never really

1701
00:39:28,039 --> 00:39:28,780
went out of stock.

1702
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,039
Just use the angle of back in

1703
00:39:30,039 --> 00:39:31,429
stock because it works really

1704
00:39:31,429 --> 00:39:31,880
well.

1705
00:39:32,099 --> 00:39:33,389
If something is back in stock,

1706
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,940
that means it went out of stock.

1707
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,090
And if something went out of

1708
00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:37,619
stock, that means it's popular.

1709
00:39:37,679 --> 00:39:39,260
And that means it may likely go

1710
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:40,849
out of stock again, which is

1711
00:39:40,849 --> 00:39:41,559
urgency.

1712
00:39:41,619 --> 00:39:43,380
So the back in stock angle mixes

1713
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:45,480
popularity and urgency at once.

1714
00:39:45,539 --> 00:39:46,639
So even if a product, again,

1715
00:39:46,639 --> 00:39:47,769
didn't necessarily go out of

1716
00:39:47,769 --> 00:39:49,099
stock, you can still use this

1717
00:39:49,099 --> 00:39:49,519
angle.

1718
00:39:49,579 --> 00:39:52,019
So this is one of my favorites to

1719
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:52,550
do.

1720
00:39:52,619 --> 00:39:53,860
So keep track of when you get new

1721
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:54,570
products in.

1722
00:39:54,639 --> 00:39:56,039
Just create a feature product.

1723
00:39:56,099 --> 00:39:57,469
You don't even necessarily need to

1724
00:39:57,469 --> 00:39:57,940
do that.

1725
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:58,889
You can just say back in stock

1726
00:39:58,889 --> 00:39:59,619
whenever you want.

1727
00:39:59,679 --> 00:40:00,619
So here's an example.

1728
00:40:00,679 --> 00:40:01,780
The Spidey Suds is back.

1729
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:03,119
This has returned.

1730
00:40:03,179 --> 00:40:04,940
You could say limited time only.

1731
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:05,769
That adds urgency.

1732
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:08,039
So then just product feature gear.

1733
00:40:08,099 --> 00:40:09,539
And then just another example.

1734
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:10,940
The full glass is back.

1735
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,440
And it's in this style.

1736
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:13,599
That's also something that you can

1737
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:13,840
do.

1738
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:16,570
And just feature, like, whatever

1739
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:17,940
your style is.

1740
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,869
So just always do back in stock

1741
00:40:19,869 --> 00:40:21,500
emails now and again.

1742
00:40:21,579 --> 00:40:23,699
And then straightforward trending

1743
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:24,579
products.

1744
00:40:24,639 --> 00:40:26,090
Feature email on what products are

1745
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:27,639
performing well on that month.

1746
00:40:28,019 --> 00:40:29,500
These work because the customer

1747
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:31,079
just likes to be updated on trends

1748
00:40:31,079 --> 00:40:32,769
and popular products, what's going

1749
00:40:32,769 --> 00:40:33,039
on.

1750
00:40:33,099 --> 00:40:35,110
But one thing that I don't see a

1751
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:37,329
lot of people do too much is doing

1752
00:40:37,329 --> 00:40:38,860
future trending.

1753
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,800
Not just saying, here's what's

1754
00:40:40,809 --> 00:40:42,480
been popular in the past six

1755
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,199
months.

1756
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:45,139
You want to say, here's what's

1757
00:40:45,139 --> 00:40:47,300
popular this upcoming season.

1758
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:48,920
Or here's, we noticed that this

1759
00:40:48,949 --> 00:40:50,530
trend is going to be new and it's

1760
00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:51,449
up and coming.

1761
00:40:51,559 --> 00:40:52,570
You want to frame it as, like,

1762
00:40:52,570 --> 00:40:53,539
here's what's going on.

1763
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:55,219
Instead of saying, like, for

1764
00:40:55,219 --> 00:40:57,099
summer trending email, you don't

1765
00:40:57,139 --> 00:40:58,670
want to say, here's what was

1766
00:40:58,670 --> 00:41:00,119
popular last summer.

1767
00:41:00,619 --> 00:41:01,199
That was last summer.

1768
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:01,980
Shit changes.

1769
00:41:02,039 --> 00:41:03,389
You want to be, here's what's

1770
00:41:03,389 --> 00:41:04,639
trending this summer.

1771
00:41:04,699 --> 00:41:06,679
Here's, like, the newest trend for

1772
00:41:06,679 --> 00:41:07,630
summer going.

1773
00:41:07,719 --> 00:41:08,820
Here's the trend that's going to

1774
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:10,039
take over the rest of summer.

1775
00:41:10,099 --> 00:41:11,400
You really can't send too many of

1776
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,179
these emails.

1777
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:13,739
They're a great way to make you

1778
00:41:13,739 --> 00:41:14,500
stand out.

1779
00:41:14,559 --> 00:41:15,539
So just pick a product or

1780
00:41:15,539 --> 00:41:17,119
collection you want to highlight,

1781
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:18,539
feature those, and just create

1782
00:41:18,539 --> 00:41:19,619
trending off of it.

1783
00:41:19,679 --> 00:41:21,510
You could also, bonus points, if

1784
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:23,110
you create, like, a curated

1785
00:41:23,170 --> 00:41:25,070
collection for the customer inside

1786
00:41:25,170 --> 00:41:26,559
of Shopify or whatever platform

1787
00:41:26,559 --> 00:41:27,139
you're using,

1788
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:28,780
create a custom collection for,

1789
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,079
like, the trending or a different

1790
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:31,099
category that you want.

1791
00:41:31,199 --> 00:41:32,800
So for this example right here,

1792
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,630
this was a special Shopify page.

1793
00:41:34,699 --> 00:41:35,599
It was new and trending.

1794
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:37,280
It was checker cases, 2024's

1795
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,420
hottest case, number one

1796
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:39,539
bestseller this year,

1797
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:41,239
and just created, like, a new

1798
00:41:41,239 --> 00:41:43,019
collection page for this, just

1799
00:41:43,019 --> 00:41:44,840
linking people to that page.

1800
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:46,170
And then they're also saying, now

1801
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:47,349
in stock, even though this has

1802
00:41:47,369 --> 00:41:48,329
always been in stock.

1803
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:50,250
So that's always angle that you

1804
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:50,960
can use.

1805
00:41:51,019 --> 00:41:52,409
And then another example is, like,

1806
00:41:52,409 --> 00:41:53,880
trending is just, like, green.

1807
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:55,340
Green for spring.

1808
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:56,980
This is something where you're

1809
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:58,369
just showing off green products.

1810
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:59,380
These are trending right now.

1811
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,699
Also something that you can do and

1812
00:42:00,699 --> 00:42:01,570
is very effective.

1813
00:42:01,659 --> 00:42:04,030
Reviews and testimonials, probably

1814
00:42:04,030 --> 00:42:05,989
one of my favorites, if not the

1815
00:42:06,030 --> 00:42:06,820
favorite,

1816
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,000
just because it's so

1817
00:42:08,019 --> 00:42:10,110
straightforward, so easy, but so

1818
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:10,949
effective.

1819
00:42:11,039 --> 00:42:11,719
Always is.

1820
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:13,420
But people just don't really send

1821
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:15,210
testimonial emails that often.

1822
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:16,440
Don't know why.

1823
00:42:16,519 --> 00:42:18,420
So testimonials just do a few

1824
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:19,190
things.

1825
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,420
They prove that you're a legit

1826
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:21,409
brand and you deliver your

1827
00:42:21,409 --> 00:42:22,289
products to people,

1828
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:23,889
which is going to overcome some

1829
00:42:23,889 --> 00:42:24,920
doubt in people.

1830
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:26,199
And two, they also show that other

1831
00:42:26,199 --> 00:42:27,429
people are fans of your brand.

1832
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:29,119
And as you know, humans like to

1833
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:30,170
follow the herd.

1834
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:31,519
As hearing others who took the

1835
00:42:31,519 --> 00:42:33,039
leap, they made the risk of buying

1836
00:42:33,039 --> 00:42:33,480
from you,

1837
00:42:33,539 --> 00:42:34,099
and then they're happy.

1838
00:42:34,159 --> 00:42:35,329
The customer's more likely to.

1839
00:42:35,739 --> 00:42:37,280
So it's really important to pull

1840
00:42:37,309 --> 00:42:38,800
testimonials that actually

1841
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:39,519
address, like,

1842
00:42:39,579 --> 00:42:41,309
an objection that the customer may

1843
00:42:41,309 --> 00:42:41,780
have.

1844
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,829
General testimonials don't do too

1845
00:42:43,829 --> 00:42:44,380
much.

1846
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:45,460
Like, this brand is awesome.

1847
00:42:45,519 --> 00:42:46,780
That's not going to do too much.

1848
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:48,900
You want to say, this brand, or

1849
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,130
you want to say, like,

1850
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:52,210
I struggled with acne for three

1851
00:42:52,210 --> 00:42:54,559
months and I have sensitive skin,

1852
00:42:54,619 --> 00:42:56,039
but this is so light on my skin.

1853
00:42:56,059 --> 00:42:56,480
Yada, yada, yada.

1854
00:42:56,539 --> 00:42:57,760
Find a testimonial like that.

1855
00:42:57,820 --> 00:42:58,519
It's worth it.

1856
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,030
You can even take social media

1857
00:43:00,030 --> 00:43:01,539
comments and integrate them in,

1858
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:02,780
which this brand did, which I

1859
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:03,659
think is awesome.

1860
00:43:03,719 --> 00:43:05,099
These are pretty general, but I

1861
00:43:05,099 --> 00:43:06,099
think it works kind of like for

1862
00:43:06,159 --> 00:43:07,150
the Instagram feel.

1863
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:08,519
General comments.

1864
00:43:08,579 --> 00:43:10,780
But you can just throw them in any

1865
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:11,510
email.

1866
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:13,340
Over 30,000 five-star reviews.

1867
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:14,230
Always feature that.

1868
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:15,019
And then look it.

1869
00:43:15,079 --> 00:43:16,250
There's only two testimonials

1870
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:16,619
here.

1871
00:43:16,699 --> 00:43:18,150
But they're just really good

1872
00:43:18,150 --> 00:43:19,940
testimonials that are in-depth,

1873
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,699
and they just prove that people

1874
00:43:21,699 --> 00:43:23,400
were passionate enough to sit

1875
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:23,900
down,

1876
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:25,599
spend five to ten minutes writing

1877
00:43:25,650 --> 00:43:27,079
a review for this brand.

1878
00:43:27,139 --> 00:43:28,449
Okay, they must be good.

1879
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:29,800
So I love that.

1880
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:31,559
And then us versus them.

1881
00:43:31,619 --> 00:43:32,860
This is an email just comparing

1882
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:34,210
you versus your customer versus

1883
00:43:34,210 --> 00:43:35,019
your competitors

1884
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:36,139
or other people in the industry

1885
00:43:36,139 --> 00:43:37,119
just clearly laid out.

1886
00:43:37,179 --> 00:43:39,210
So you probably notice this is a

1887
00:43:39,210 --> 00:43:41,449
theme with, like, our emails is

1888
00:43:41,449 --> 00:43:43,139
just displaying things

1889
00:43:43,199 --> 00:43:44,320
super clearly for the customer.

1890
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:45,619
This is kind of a tougher one to

1891
00:43:45,619 --> 00:43:46,510
execute, though,

1892
00:43:46,619 --> 00:43:47,610
because you don't want to beg the

1893
00:43:47,630 --> 00:43:48,639
customer for the purchase.

1894
00:43:48,699 --> 00:43:49,980
Be like, these guys suck, but

1895
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:50,699
we're great.

1896
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:51,929
You lose frame, and that just

1897
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:53,500
increases your sales resistance.

1898
00:43:53,559 --> 00:43:55,840
It's kind of like pick me, pick

1899
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:56,340
me.

1900
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,260
So you want to be careful.

1901
00:43:57,860 --> 00:43:58,719
You just want to display the

1902
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:00,400
facts, show them how you defer,

1903
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:02,219
and then just help the customer

1904
00:44:02,219 --> 00:44:03,880
make the decision rather than be

1905
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:04,179
like,

1906
00:44:04,239 --> 00:44:05,389
you have to buy from us.

1907
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:06,280
So how?

1908
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:07,019
Just use a table.

1909
00:44:07,079 --> 00:44:08,570
Just laying out us versus our

1910
00:44:08,570 --> 00:44:09,460
competitor.

1911
00:44:09,519 --> 00:44:11,969
ChatGPT prompt, super easy.

1912
00:44:12,039 --> 00:44:12,920
This is what we use.

1913
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:13,929
We have this product and this

1914
00:44:13,929 --> 00:44:14,289
niche.

1915
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:15,349
Our product does this.

1916
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:16,780
Then you just say, I'm creating an

1917
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:17,619
us versus them email.

1918
00:44:17,679 --> 00:44:18,750
My brand versus another brand in

1919
00:44:18,769 --> 00:44:19,420
the industry.

1920
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:20,309
Give me a comparison list

1921
00:44:20,349 --> 00:44:21,280
comparing unique selling

1922
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:21,860
propositions.

1923
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:23,400
My brand versus competitors to

1924
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:24,980
make my brand look superior.

1925
00:44:25,039 --> 00:44:26,789
So here's like an example for food

1926
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:27,969
delivery service.

1927
00:44:28,039 --> 00:44:29,280
Here's why we shine.

1928
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:31,090
Here's us, and then here's generic

1929
00:44:31,090 --> 00:44:31,829
delivery.

1930
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:34,019
And then also this one right here.

1931
00:44:34,099 --> 00:44:34,840
Another table.

1932
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:35,920
Us versus them.

1933
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:37,929
Here's us, and then here's them,

1934
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:39,809
like faceless, bland, making us

1935
00:44:39,809 --> 00:44:40,460
stand out.

1936
00:44:40,519 --> 00:44:42,400
This is just a unique way to show

1937
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,269
your benefits of why somebody

1938
00:44:44,269 --> 00:44:45,659
should choose you.

1939
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:48,079
And then another favorite as well

1940
00:44:48,110 --> 00:44:49,460
is myths versus facts.

1941
00:44:49,519 --> 00:44:50,500
So going over common

1942
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:52,190
misconceptions in your industry

1943
00:44:52,250 --> 00:44:53,809
versus what the facts actually

1944
00:44:53,809 --> 00:44:54,260
say.

1945
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:55,679
So there are plenty of common

1946
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:57,250
misconceptions that people can

1947
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:58,820
have in your industry, like

1948
00:44:58,880 --> 00:44:59,699
we'll see down here.

1949
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:01,269
Similar to like an FAQ email, we

1950
00:45:01,269 --> 00:45:03,000
want to just address them straight

1951
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:03,360
up.

1952
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:04,519
You can ask your support team for

1953
00:45:04,519 --> 00:45:05,239
like what are common

1954
00:45:05,239 --> 00:45:06,000
misconceptions.

1955
00:45:06,059 --> 00:45:07,760
And then, yeah.

1956
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:09,360
And the bonus of the myths versus

1957
00:45:09,389 --> 00:45:11,000
facts email is that myths versus

1958
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,420
facts is like a cool headline.

1959
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:13,460
That's an intriguing topic.

1960
00:45:13,659 --> 00:45:14,809
People like seeing myths versus

1961
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:16,150
facts, like did you know this?

1962
00:45:16,219 --> 00:45:16,960
This is a myth.

1963
00:45:17,019 --> 00:45:18,860
People like knowing that stuff.

1964
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:20,920
So overcoming objections, easy way

1965
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:21,849
to make sales.

1966
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:23,579
So just think about your common

1967
00:45:23,579 --> 00:45:25,369
misconceptions and compare them

1968
00:45:25,429 --> 00:45:26,739
side by side versus the

1969
00:45:26,739 --> 00:45:27,300
misconception

1970
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:28,559
versus the fact.

1971
00:45:28,619 --> 00:45:30,510
So here's a common chat GPT prompt

1972
00:45:30,559 --> 00:45:31,739
that you can use.

1973
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:32,900
Again, talk about your product,

1974
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:33,929
and then say I'm creating myths

1975
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:35,039
versus facts email campaign.

1976
00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:36,980
Give me three myths versus facts

1977
00:45:36,989 --> 00:45:38,650
about my industry that I can

1978
00:45:38,650 --> 00:45:40,280
include in this email.

1979
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:41,690
Here's an example for the

1980
00:45:41,690 --> 00:45:42,539
sunscreen.

1981
00:45:43,079 --> 00:45:43,949
Myth, it's impossible to get

1982
00:45:43,949 --> 00:45:44,880
sunscreen on my kiddos.

1983
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:46,559
Kiddos love applying this thing

1984
00:45:46,559 --> 00:45:48,190
thanks to the super fun texture

1985
00:45:48,190 --> 00:45:49,340
and consistency.

1986
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:52,480
Sunscreen and sweating don't mix.

1987
00:45:52,539 --> 00:45:53,579
And then you could say like our

1988
00:45:53,579 --> 00:45:54,420
product does this.

1989
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:55,980
Sunscreen mist always leaves a

1990
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:56,739
white cast.

1991
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:57,619
Nope, we don't.

1992
00:45:57,679 --> 00:45:58,989
Same sort of thing here.

1993
00:45:59,059 --> 00:46:00,760
Facts and then myths right here.

1994
00:46:00,820 --> 00:46:02,800
So super clearly laid out, easy

1995
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:05,059
for the customer to see and read.

1996
00:46:06,179 --> 00:46:08,059
And then the blog promo.

1997
00:46:08,119 --> 00:46:10,250
So most brands will have a blog,

1998
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:12,019
have some sort of blog.

1999
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:13,679
So all we can do is we can create

2000
00:46:13,679 --> 00:46:15,360
an email about this blog.

2001
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:16,630
Now this is going to make sales

2002
00:46:16,630 --> 00:46:18,280
because blogs are on your website.

2003
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:19,820
And if you can get people to click

2004
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:21,349
onto a blog, it's super easy for

2005
00:46:21,349 --> 00:46:22,840
them at that point to just click

2006
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:24,860
the logo in the top of your

2007
00:46:24,869 --> 00:46:26,530
website and then that takes them

2008
00:46:26,530 --> 00:46:27,090
to go shop.

2009
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:29,119
So what we really want to do in

2010
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:30,869
this email is like give a sneak

2011
00:46:30,869 --> 00:46:32,829
peek on the blog to encourage site

2012
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:33,400
clicks.

2013
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:34,579
So we want to optimize for the

2014
00:46:34,659 --> 00:46:35,000
click.

2015
00:46:35,079 --> 00:46:36,230
Just get people to click.

2016
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:37,840
Don't give all the information on

2017
00:46:37,869 --> 00:46:39,579
the blog just right off the bat.

2018
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,170
So it's all about engagement,

2019
00:46:41,199 --> 00:46:42,599
moving people down the funnel.

2020
00:46:42,659 --> 00:46:44,159
Someone clicks a blog, there's

2021
00:46:44,170 --> 00:46:45,420
more likely to go buy.

2022
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:46,519
And also a good blog, if you're

2023
00:46:46,519 --> 00:46:47,860
creating good blogs, they're going

2024
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:48,980
to promote your products at the

2025
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:49,550
same time.

2026
00:46:49,659 --> 00:46:50,619
So it's kind of like a sales

2027
00:46:50,619 --> 00:46:51,960
letter for people anyways and you

2028
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:53,159
get people to view that.

2029
00:46:53,219 --> 00:46:55,099
So it's also a nice change of pace

2030
00:46:55,099 --> 00:46:57,050
as well for your list to soft sell

2031
00:46:57,050 --> 00:46:57,650
them.

2032
00:46:57,719 --> 00:46:59,610
And like promoting a blog, it's

2033
00:46:59,659 --> 00:47:01,789
like non-salesy, but it's going to

2034
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:04,039
result in a good chunk of sales.

2035
00:47:04,099 --> 00:47:05,199
So you're building goodwill, but

2036
00:47:05,199 --> 00:47:06,230
you're still making sales.

2037
00:47:07,159 --> 00:47:07,679
So how?

2038
00:47:07,739 --> 00:47:08,829
Just use a past blog, use an

2039
00:47:08,829 --> 00:47:10,409
intriguing headline, and then give

2040
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:11,719
a sneak peek in the email.

2041
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:13,139
Try to really sell the click.

2042
00:47:13,199 --> 00:47:14,840
Example right here.

2043
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:16,380
The health benefits of olive oil.

2044
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:17,300
Get the scoop.

2045
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:18,429
You're teasing it right here.

2046
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:19,619
And then there are a few

2047
00:47:19,639 --> 00:47:20,389
questions.

2048
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:21,809
Get all the Q&A goodness here.

2049
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:22,530
They just give a few.

2050
00:47:22,599 --> 00:47:23,480
They sneak peek it.

2051
00:47:23,539 --> 00:47:25,010
And then you can go read more on

2052
00:47:25,010 --> 00:47:26,820
the site, which is on the blog.

2053
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:27,940
Benefits of the bong.

2054
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,519
That's a fun topic.

2055
00:47:29,579 --> 00:47:31,420
Are they really better than this?

2056
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:32,110
Learn more.

2057
00:47:32,179 --> 00:47:33,150
Button right at the top of the

2058
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:34,309
email in the header section.

2059
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,780
And then here's some examples,

2060
00:47:36,869 --> 00:47:39,329
again, of educating, giving a

2061
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:42,519
little bit of background, and then

2062
00:47:42,519 --> 00:47:43,530
learn more.

2063
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:44,769
And then promoting some bongs down

2064
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:45,599
here at the bottom.

2065
00:47:45,659 --> 00:47:46,599
Great example.

2066
00:47:46,659 --> 00:47:48,039
And then the last one here is

2067
00:47:48,039 --> 00:47:49,889
research study highlight, which

2068
00:47:49,889 --> 00:47:51,840
just is going to position yourself

2069
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:52,500
as an authority.

2070
00:47:52,579 --> 00:47:53,820
So we just find a research study

2071
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:55,070
published that relates to our

2072
00:47:55,070 --> 00:47:56,599
niche and promote it in an email.

2073
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:58,719
So by promoting research studies,

2074
00:47:58,719 --> 00:47:59,880
you position your brand as an

2075
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:01,320
industry leader, you're a thought

2076
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:02,559
leader, you're on top of these

2077
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:04,000
things, all that good stuff.

2078
00:48:04,159 --> 00:48:06,130
And it doesn't necessarily have to

2079
00:48:06,130 --> 00:48:08,090
be about your specific product,

2080
00:48:08,090 --> 00:48:09,769
like a research study on your

2081
00:48:09,769 --> 00:48:11,719
product, but it could be one just

2082
00:48:11,719 --> 00:48:13,289
in your niche or a material in

2083
00:48:13,449 --> 00:48:14,460
your product.

2084
00:48:14,519 --> 00:48:15,619
One way or another, you can

2085
00:48:15,630 --> 00:48:17,119
connect any research study to your

2086
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:17,599
brand.

2087
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,179
So you can look up on Google

2088
00:48:19,179 --> 00:48:20,739
Scholar or like ChatGPT around

2089
00:48:20,739 --> 00:48:22,420
your niche, read the abstract,

2090
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:24,030
read the summary, and then just

2091
00:48:24,039 --> 00:48:25,539
create an email about that and

2092
00:48:25,539 --> 00:48:26,800
link people to that.

2093
00:48:26,860 --> 00:48:28,869
Just, again, you might not make a

2094
00:48:28,869 --> 00:48:30,929
ton of sales directly on this, but

2095
00:48:30,929 --> 00:48:32,789
you'll make more sales down the

2096
00:48:32,789 --> 00:48:34,800
line by telling people about this

2097
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:35,500
study.

2098
00:48:35,559 --> 00:48:36,679
So you can say, we have this

2099
00:48:36,699 --> 00:48:37,260
product.

2100
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:38,619
You can ask ChatGPT to find this.

2101
00:48:38,679 --> 00:48:39,460
We're trying to find a

2102
00:48:39,489 --> 00:48:40,969
professional third-party research

2103
00:48:40,969 --> 00:48:42,300
study related to our niche that we

2104
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:43,940
can educate our customers about.

2105
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,119
Can you provide me with five?

2106
00:48:45,179 --> 00:48:46,300
And then you can click through and

2107
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:47,380
find the one that you like.

2108
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:49,269
So new study reveals the soft link

2109
00:48:49,269 --> 00:48:50,469
between soft gums and

2110
00:48:50,469 --> 00:48:51,500
inflammation.

2111
00:48:51,579 --> 00:48:52,750
Soft gums, pathway to

2112
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:53,780
inflammation.

2113
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:55,280
What we found, here's the risk.

2114
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:56,769
And then position your product as

2115
00:48:56,769 --> 00:48:57,579
the solution.

2116
00:48:57,639 --> 00:48:59,300
So this is linking to the research

2117
00:48:59,329 --> 00:49:01,070
study, whereas this, now we're

2118
00:49:01,130 --> 00:49:02,780
promoting our product and how we

2119
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:03,880
overcome this.

2120
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:05,280
Same sort of thing here.

2121
00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:06,980
Here's a research study.

2122
00:49:07,059 --> 00:49:08,079
What does the research say?

2123
00:49:08,139 --> 00:49:09,920
Read more, read more, read more.

2124
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:10,989
And we're trying to just get

2125
00:49:10,989 --> 00:49:12,179
people to read a little bit more

2126
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:13,409
and position ourselves as that

2127
00:49:13,469 --> 00:49:14,989
industry leader and people and

2128
00:49:14,989 --> 00:49:16,659
someone that you guys can trust

2129
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:18,860
because we've done the research.

2130
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:20,090
That's really what we're trying to

2131
00:49:20,090 --> 00:49:20,360
do.

2132
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:23,440
Oh, actually, we have more.

2133
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:24,900
We have the holiday email here.

2134
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:26,500
So we're promoting a fun or random

2135
00:49:26,530 --> 00:49:28,110
holiday that we can connect to our

2136
00:49:28,110 --> 00:49:29,139
niche somehow.

2137
00:49:29,199 --> 00:49:31,400
That's the email, the whole email.

2138
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:32,309
So why?

2139
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:33,400
Who doesn't love a holiday?

2140
00:49:33,980 --> 00:49:34,989
But we're not using typical

2141
00:49:34,989 --> 00:49:36,099
holidays for these emails,

2142
00:49:36,099 --> 00:49:37,170
although you still can.

2143
00:49:37,239 --> 00:49:38,639
You can send, like, Christmas,

2144
00:49:38,639 --> 00:49:40,159
Easter emails, all that stuff.

2145
00:49:40,219 --> 00:49:41,630
But we're using random holidays

2146
00:49:41,630 --> 00:49:43,000
because there are random ones

2147
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,289
every single day that you can

2148
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:45,780
easily spin up and connect to one

2149
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:46,809
of your products.

2150
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:48,559
And just create a fun email about

2151
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:48,920
it.

2152
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:50,340
Connect it to your product.

2153
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:51,170
Make it fun.

2154
00:49:51,239 --> 00:49:52,780
Make it exciting.

2155
00:49:53,340 --> 00:49:55,110
So you can use websites like

2156
00:49:55,110 --> 00:49:57,409
Checkaday and Blank Calendar Pages

2157
00:49:57,480 --> 00:49:58,880
to find holidays.

2158
00:49:58,940 --> 00:50:01,320
You can also use ChatGPT to say,

2159
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:02,730
are there any random holidays in

2160
00:50:02,730 --> 00:50:04,030
this month that we can create an

2161
00:50:04,030 --> 00:50:05,159
email campaign out of?

2162
00:50:05,219 --> 00:50:06,139
Here's my product.

2163
00:50:06,199 --> 00:50:08,099
So those are always fun to do.

2164
00:50:08,199 --> 00:50:10,440
So, for example, this is the day.

2165
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:12,840
It's Irish, National Irish Coffee

2166
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:13,360
Day.

2167
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:15,300
Whether you're in the mood for a

2168
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:17,219
traditional taste, whatever, shop

2169
00:50:17,219 --> 00:50:17,639
now.

2170
00:50:17,699 --> 00:50:19,559
So it's just promoting their

2171
00:50:19,559 --> 00:50:21,769
product, which has this easy way

2172
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:23,800
to just promote your products

2173
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:25,679
without being too salesy and

2174
00:50:25,699 --> 00:50:26,829
giving people a reason to shop

2175
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:27,489
your item.

2176
00:50:27,579 --> 00:50:29,380
Same thing, National Hiking Day.

2177
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:30,559
View this trail.

2178
00:50:30,639 --> 00:50:32,139
And this brand is probably getting

2179
00:50:32,139 --> 00:50:33,610
paid for the amount of clicks that

2180
00:50:33,630 --> 00:50:34,260
they get.

2181
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:35,329
Same sort of thing, National

2182
00:50:35,329 --> 00:50:35,889
Hiking Day.

2183
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:36,980
You can do this for clothing

2184
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:38,340
brands if you sell hiking gear.

2185
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:39,920
National Hiking Day.

2186
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:41,340
Shop this.

2187
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:43,679
Okay, so here are 15 more campaign

2188
00:50:43,679 --> 00:50:45,099
ideas that you can use.

2189
00:50:45,159 --> 00:50:46,659
Progress update.

2190
00:50:46,719 --> 00:50:48,190
So share, like, recent updates in

2191
00:50:48,190 --> 00:50:48,800
the brand.

2192
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:50,030
We've seen those perform well.

2193
00:50:50,099 --> 00:50:51,519
It really gets people close to the

2194
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:51,989
brand.

2195
00:50:52,059 --> 00:50:53,949
Keeps the subscribers informed and

2196
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:54,659
engaged.

2197
00:50:54,719 --> 00:50:55,519
You can do a customer

2198
00:50:55,530 --> 00:50:56,960
transformation, similar to the

2199
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:58,380
testimonial, but really show,

2200
00:50:58,380 --> 00:50:59,550
like, a before and after of

2201
00:50:59,550 --> 00:51:00,260
somebody.

2202
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:02,079
That's kind of what we have here,

2203
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:03,400
before versus after.

2204
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:05,110
The effectiveness of your product

2205
00:51:05,110 --> 00:51:06,699
before and after being used.

2206
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:08,119
Puzzles and riddles.

2207
00:51:08,179 --> 00:51:09,130
That's something that you can do

2208
00:51:09,130 --> 00:51:10,070
with, like, brain teasers or

2209
00:51:10,119 --> 00:51:10,559
puzzles.

2210
00:51:11,539 --> 00:51:12,530
It's a fun break from the usual

2211
00:51:12,530 --> 00:51:13,000
content.

2212
00:51:13,059 --> 00:51:14,260
Note from the founder.

2213
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:15,780
These absolutely crush it.

2214
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:17,150
Just like, hey, this is X, the

2215
00:51:17,159 --> 00:51:18,389
founder of, I just wanted to

2216
00:51:18,389 --> 00:51:19,860
remind you of this, yada, yada,

2217
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:20,380
yada.

2218
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:21,659
Gift guide.

2219
00:51:21,719 --> 00:51:22,659
No matter the time of the year,

2220
00:51:22,659 --> 00:51:23,699
you can create a gift guide.

2221
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:25,289
Like, hey, is it have a friend's

2222
00:51:25,289 --> 00:51:26,969
birthday coming up or marriage, a

2223
00:51:26,969 --> 00:51:27,699
wedding.

2224
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:29,070
Here's a gift guide.

2225
00:51:29,139 --> 00:51:30,260
This is perfect for this person,

2226
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:30,880
yada, yada.

2227
00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:31,880
Treat yourself.

2228
00:51:31,940 --> 00:51:32,460
Kind of similar.

2229
00:51:32,519 --> 00:51:33,340
These perform well.

2230
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:34,440
Hey, you deserve it.

2231
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:36,320
Buy.

2232
00:51:36,380 --> 00:51:37,210
Buy for yourself.

2233
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:37,880
You know you want it.

2234
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:38,500
Something like that.

2235
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:40,460
Social proof email, like media

2236
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:41,909
publications, where you've been in

2237
00:51:41,909 --> 00:51:43,159
the media, press coverage,

2238
00:51:43,159 --> 00:51:44,500
interviews, articles, whatever

2239
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:45,059
like that.

2240
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:46,420
Good form of social proof there.

2241
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:47,599
Behind the scenes.

2242
00:51:47,659 --> 00:51:48,969
Take pictures, like, behind the

2243
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:49,980
scenes in your factory or

2244
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:51,090
whatever's happening.

2245
00:51:51,179 --> 00:51:52,280
That's an email that you can send.

2246
00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:53,550
Tips and tricks is another

2247
00:51:53,550 --> 00:51:54,980
valuable one that you can do in

2248
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:56,599
your niche or your industry.

2249
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:58,900
UGC content, so anybody who's

2250
00:51:58,900 --> 00:52:00,460
created content for you, just

2251
00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:02,480
feature what they've put together.

2252
00:52:02,539 --> 00:52:03,559
You can have a sneak peek for

2253
00:52:03,579 --> 00:52:05,019
upcoming products, features, or

2254
00:52:05,019 --> 00:52:06,320
content that's coming up.

2255
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:07,639
You can do flashback Friday or

2256
00:52:07,639 --> 00:52:08,960
throwback Thursday, like,

2257
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:10,800
historical content from the brand.

2258
00:52:10,860 --> 00:52:12,199
Like, this was us one year ago.

2259
00:52:12,260 --> 00:52:13,900
That's something fun that you can

2260
00:52:13,909 --> 00:52:14,280
do.

2261
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:15,579
Staff picks.

2262
00:52:15,639 --> 00:52:17,170
So, here's what we recommend.

2263
00:52:17,239 --> 00:52:18,179
Anything like that.

2264
00:52:18,599 --> 00:52:19,860
And then also, like, brand values

2265
00:52:19,860 --> 00:52:20,980
is a cool email that you can do,

2266
00:52:21,050 --> 00:52:22,420
where it's just like, this is what

2267
00:52:22,420 --> 00:52:23,239
we optimize for.

2268
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:24,539
This is what's important to us.

2269
00:52:24,599 --> 00:52:25,539
Are you with us?

2270
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:26,980
Just to remind people of your

2271
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:27,619
message.

2272
00:52:27,679 --> 00:52:30,219
So, that was a lot.

2273
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:31,739
This was definitely a longer

2274
00:52:31,739 --> 00:52:33,570
email, but hopefully that gave you

2275
00:52:33,630 --> 00:52:35,400
unlimited email content ideas to

2276
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:36,320
choose from.

2277
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:37,480
That's kind of my goal here.

2278
00:52:37,539 --> 00:52:39,030
But I'm going to show you how to

2279
00:52:39,030 --> 00:52:40,659
get even more for you here in the

2280
00:52:40,659 --> 00:52:41,539
next module.

2281
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:42,530
But these are some of my

2282
00:52:42,530 --> 00:52:43,199
favorites.

2283
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:43,880
Use them.

2284
00:52:43,940 --> 00:52:46,739
Reuse the ones that work.

2285
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,500
And you're going to be printing.

2286
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:49,159
All right.

2287
00:52:49,219 --> 00:52:50,440
So, hope you got value from that.

2288
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:52,000
And let's move on to the next one.
