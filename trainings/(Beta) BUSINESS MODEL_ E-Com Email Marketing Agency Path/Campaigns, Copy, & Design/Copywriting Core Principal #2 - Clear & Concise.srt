1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,359
And now we're talking about core

2
00:00:02,359 --> 00:00:04,790
copy principle number two which is

3
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:07,280
clear and concise so going

4
00:00:07,339 --> 00:00:09,099
back here to our main graphic of

5
00:00:09,099 --> 00:00:10,880
skimmable clear and concise and

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,720
then engaging those are our three

7
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:14,349
principles we already went through

8
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:15,910
skimmable clear and concise ties

9
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:17,140
into that for sure but

10
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:18,679
we want to make sure that we have

11
00:00:18,679 --> 00:00:20,149
one takeaway kind of like in our

12
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:21,440
emails that we want to be

13
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,760
the driving force of our emails so

14
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,059
clear and concise the customer's

15
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,760
iq is dropping by about

16
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,300
50 the second they open their

17
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:30,839
email they're just in zombie mode

18
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:32,079
and if we aren't clear on what

19
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:33,659
we're giving them they're just not

20
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:35,100
going to understand and so if we

21
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,060
aren't concise they're

22
00:00:36,219 --> 00:00:37,640
not going to bother giving us time

23
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:38,729
so this kind of ties it into

24
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:40,159
keeping our copy short which is

25
00:00:40,299 --> 00:00:42,429
definitely a principle with clear

26
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:44,219
and concise is keeping it short

27
00:00:44,439 --> 00:00:46,320
but also less scatter with your

28
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,130
copy just make sure you're clear

29
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:49,750
on what you're giving away so

30
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:51,679
short and sweet that's the main

31
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:53,170
thing the shorter your email is

32
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:54,399
the better we only have a few

33
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:56,090
seconds your email should not be

34
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:56,479
longer

35
00:00:56,539 --> 00:00:57,829
than one to two scrolls in most

36
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,149
cases now we want to make sure

37
00:00:59,149 --> 00:01:00,460
we're mixing things up for

38
00:01:00,679 --> 00:01:01,759
audience but

39
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:03,649
look at like these short and sweet

40
00:01:03,649 --> 00:01:05,379
emails benefits beyond the gut

41
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,750
this is the whole email and then

42
00:01:07,819 --> 00:01:09,569
this button right here it's the

43
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:11,370
whole email nobody's reading an

44
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,239
essay they don't have to worry

45
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:13,599
about

46
00:01:13,659 --> 00:01:15,280
these like crazy crazy emails that

47
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,859
they have to read short and simple

48
00:01:16,939 --> 00:01:18,319
and then look at this email

49
00:01:18,379 --> 00:01:20,120
we're texting you for one thing we

50
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,680
want to be in your shower just

51
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,200
being honest and we're just trying

52
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:23,519
to get

53
00:01:23,579 --> 00:01:25,469
people on the text list we're not

54
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,450
spending so much time going over

55
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:29,030
like each benefit we're just

56
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:29,359
keeping

57
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:30,989
it short and sweet and to the

58
00:01:30,989 --> 00:01:32,620
point so the customer isn't

59
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,730
overwhelmed and you know it's just

60
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:35,040
clear and

61
00:01:35,099 --> 00:01:36,620
concise what we're giving away and

62
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:38,140
then also really important which

63
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:39,659
not a lot of people talk about is

64
00:01:39,739 --> 00:01:41,760
one takeaway per email that's

65
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:44,090
really what we want to do for 90

66
00:01:44,209 --> 00:01:46,370
75 of our emails we want it to

67
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:46,879
have

68
00:01:46,939 --> 00:01:48,370
one specific takeaway the odds of

69
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:49,870
having our customer remember one

70
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:51,209
takeaway that we're trying to

71
00:01:51,209 --> 00:01:52,239
drive home is

72
00:01:52,299 --> 00:01:53,780
much higher than the odds of them

73
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,370
taking like three plus different

74
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:56,560
takeaways we're trying to tell

75
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:56,640
them

76
00:01:56,859 --> 00:01:58,140
so many different things they're

77
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,310
not going to be able to they're

78
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:02,480
not going to it's then each one

79
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:02,719

80
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:04,909
like 33 of their attention we want

81
00:02:04,969 --> 00:02:07,120

129
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:23,189

concise and now we're talking

133
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:29,110
about core

134
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:31,930
copy principle number two which is

135
00:03:31,969 --> 00:03:34,500
clear and concise so going back

136
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,639
here to our main graphic of

137
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:37,199
skimmable

138
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:38,330
clear and concise and then

139
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:39,560
engaging those are our three

140
00:03:39,569 --> 00:03:40,819
principles we already went through

141
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:41,439
skimmable

142
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,189
clear and concise ties into that

143
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:44,439
for sure but we want to make sure

144
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:45,419
that we have one takeaway

145
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:47,330
kind of like in our emails that we

146
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:49,259
want to be the driving force of

147
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:50,240
our emails so

148
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,900
clear and concise the customer's

149
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,189
iq is dropping by about 50 percent

150
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,479
the second they open their email

151
00:03:56,539 --> 00:03:57,979
they're just in zombie mode and if

152
00:03:57,979 --> 00:03:59,419
we aren't clear on what we're

153
00:03:59,419 --> 00:04:00,080
giving them

154
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:01,009
they're just not going to

155
00:04:01,169 --> 00:04:02,129
understand and so if we aren't

156
00:04:02,129 --> 00:04:03,280
concise they're not going to

157
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:03,699
bother giving

158
00:04:03,819 --> 00:04:05,080
us time so this kind of ties it

159
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,629
into keeping our copy short which

160
00:04:06,629 --> 00:04:08,159
is definitely a principle with

161
00:04:08,219 --> 00:04:09,789
clear and concise is keeping it

162
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:12,129
short but also less scatter with

163
00:04:12,139 --> 00:04:14,400
your copy just make sure you're

164
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:14,800
clear

165
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,379
on what you're giving away so

166
00:04:16,379 --> 00:04:18,060
short and sweet that's the main

167
00:04:18,139 --> 00:04:20,160
thing the shorter your email is

168
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:20,879
the better

169
00:04:20,939 --> 00:04:22,189
we only have a few seconds your

170
00:04:22,189 --> 00:04:23,540
email should not be longer than

171
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:25,279
one to two scrolls in most cases

172
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:25,290
now

173
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:27,110
we want to make sure we're mixing

174
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:28,920
things up for audience but look at

175
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,300
like these short and sweet

176
00:04:30,379 --> 00:04:32,129
emails benefits beyond the gut

177
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:33,920
this is the whole email and then

178
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,519
this button right here

179
00:04:35,579 --> 00:04:37,339
it's the whole email nobody's

180
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:39,350
reading an essay they don't have

181
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:41,839
to worry about these like crazy

182
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:42,160
crazy

183
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,300
emails that they have to read

184
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,569
short and simple and then look at

185
00:04:44,579 --> 00:04:46,779
this email we're texting you for

186
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:47,040
one

187
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,399
thing we want to be in your shower

188

just being honest and we're just

189
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,019
trying to get people on

190
00:04:51,259 --> 00:04:52,939
the text list we're not spending

191
00:04:52,939 --> 00:04:54,699
so much time going over like each

192
00:04:54,699 --> 00:04:56,639
