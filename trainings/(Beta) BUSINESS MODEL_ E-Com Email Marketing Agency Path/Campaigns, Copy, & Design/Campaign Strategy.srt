1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,759
Okay, so we had our campaigns

2
00:00:02,759 --> 00:00:04,700
intro, now let's get into like

3
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:06,070
actually the strategy of

4
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:07,080
campaigns.

5
00:00:07,179 --> 00:00:08,720
Again, campaigns, one-time emails

6
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,179
that we're sending to our list.

7
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,169
Okay, so how often do we want to

8
00:00:12,169 --> 00:00:13,519
send our emails?

9
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:15,679
So I'm going to save you now three

10
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:17,760
years, over three years of A-B

11
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,719
testing on campaign frequency.

12
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:21,800
We've tested it all from two per

13
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,719
day for some brands to two per

14
00:00:23,719 --> 00:00:24,420
month.

15
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,489
This is what we found.

16
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:27,329
So this is the different sending

17
00:00:27,329 --> 00:00:29,079
frequencies kind of like you can

18
00:00:29,179 --> 00:00:30,379
do, grouped in.

19
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,530
So sending one to two times per

20
00:00:31,629 --> 00:00:32,820
week, customer kind of forgets

21
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:34,100
about you, anything less.

22
00:00:34,179 --> 00:00:35,429
The customer doesn't really

23
00:00:35,429 --> 00:00:36,780
recognize you in the inbox and

24
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,140
it's kind of just more of a shock

25
00:00:38,189 --> 00:00:39,460
to see you in the inbox.

26
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,780
And so they're unable to form that

27
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:42,219
habit of just consistently opening

28
00:00:42,219 --> 00:00:42,880
your emails.

29
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,210
It's not quite enough and you're

30
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:45,719
just leaving money on the table.

31
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:47,710
You get lower on subscribes and

32
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:49,820
this can be okay, but you're just

33
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:51,799
leaving money on the table.

34
00:00:51,939 --> 00:00:53,539
We want to get as much money as we

35
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:55,020
can from our email list.

36
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:56,799
And so you're just leaving money

37
00:00:56,799 --> 00:00:57,520
on the table.

38
00:00:57,579 --> 00:00:59,119
You're not really getting the

39
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:01,060
customer too familiar and situated

40
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:01,759
with you.

41
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:02,719
And then let's go on the other

42
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:03,560
side of the spectrum.

43
00:01:03,619 --> 00:01:04,920
Let's say five to seven times per

44
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:06,329
week where we're sending almost

45
00:01:06,329 --> 00:01:06,980
every day.

46
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,739
You get higher on subscribes.

47
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:10,090
You get customers that can be a

48
00:01:10,129 --> 00:01:11,480
little bit more annoying.

49
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:12,590
Dilutes the power of your

50
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:13,269
messaging.

51
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,450
So anytime you send something, it

52
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,560
holds less weight because you're

53
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,939
sending so often.

54
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,209
And then your revenue kind of

55
00:01:20,209 --> 00:01:21,709
plateaus at a certain point where

56
00:01:21,709 --> 00:01:23,079
you get diminishing returns.

57
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:24,819
Where sending, you have like a,

58
00:01:24,819 --> 00:01:26,620
it's like an exponential graph and

59
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,109
then it like plateaus after a

60
00:01:28,109 --> 00:01:29,159
certain point.

61
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:30,890
So the juice just isn't quite

62
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:32,689
worth the squeeze at a certain

63
00:01:32,689 --> 00:01:33,340
point.

64
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:35,120
So that's kind of like where we're

65
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:36,599
at with like the, with sending

66
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,299
five to seven times per week.

67
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:39,659
Okay.

68
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:41,159
And then now going to sending

69
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:42,799
three to four times per week.

70
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,319
Get high revenue.

71
00:01:44,379 --> 00:01:46,890
You're getting more off the table.

72
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:47,829
You're getting lower on

73
00:01:47,829 --> 00:01:48,459
subscribes.

74
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:49,750
You stay top of mind with the

75
00:01:49,849 --> 00:01:51,170
customer and every email that you

76
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:52,400
send is like equal weight and

77
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:52,959
impact.

78
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,269
Now, this isn't just like an

79
00:01:54,269 --> 00:01:55,840
arbitrary number that I pulled out

80
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,560
of nowhere.

81
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:58,540
The three to four times per week,

82
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:00,530
we've tested different lists and

83
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:02,040
sending one list down,

84
00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:04,140
sending like seven times per week,

85
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,140
another sending once per week, and

86
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:07,280
then another sending three to

87
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:07,640
four.

88
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,409
We got the highest revenue, the

89
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:11,439
lowest unsubscribed, and just like

90
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:12,699
the best response.

91
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:14,099
And this was on an eight figure

92
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:14,520
list.

93
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,659
So this is just what the numbers

94
00:02:16,659 --> 00:02:17,219
say.

95
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:18,900
Listen to me if you want.

96
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:20,259
I'm just going off the numbers.

97
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:21,560
So kind of just like I like to

98
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,099
think of this as just like you're

99
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:24,819
sending once per week on Monday.

100
00:02:24,939 --> 00:02:25,930
It's just like, what is this brand

101
00:02:26,129 --> 00:02:26,879
doing in my inbox?

102
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:28,129
A customer is subscribed to on

103
00:02:28,129 --> 00:02:29,659
average like over 40 e-commerce

104
00:02:29,669 --> 00:02:30,759
brands, email lists.

105
00:02:30,819 --> 00:02:31,680
You just get lost.

106
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:33,060
Whereas like sending four times

107
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:34,370
per week, you're able to build

108
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:35,319
that engagement.

109
00:02:35,379 --> 00:02:37,060
You're able to like the customer

110
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,860
can be affiliated with you and see

111
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:39,900
you and like you.

112
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,259
You've strong branded content and

113
00:02:41,259 --> 00:02:42,330
you're giving them value.

114
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:43,229
And then it's like, oh, hey, I

115
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:43,819
know this brand.

116
00:02:43,849 --> 00:02:44,479
I like this brand.

117
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:46,060
So there's that.

118
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,319
So again, just once per week isn't

119
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:49,110
going to cut it.

120
00:02:49,259 --> 00:02:50,479
They're exposed to over 70

121
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:51,949
different e-commerce brands every

122
00:02:51,949 --> 00:02:52,289
day.

123
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,870
Younger audience can be even

124
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:55,439
double with just the amount of

125
00:02:55,539 --> 00:02:57,219
brands out there like over one

126
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,289
week and the amount of ads people

127
00:02:58,419 --> 00:02:58,800
are seeing.

128
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,300
There's like 490 different brands.

129
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,569
So it's very, very easy for you to

130
00:03:01,569 --> 00:03:02,460
get lost in the mix.

131
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,120
And your engagement and your open

132
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,520
rate will drop as a result of

133
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,770
sending once per week,

134
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,030
which a lot of people don't

135
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:08,620
expect.

136
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,740
It's just the customer isn't able

137
00:03:09,819 --> 00:03:10,520
to get in that habit.

138
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,000
This was the result from pumping a

139
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,530
client from 2x per week to 4 per

140
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:13,939
week.

141
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,800
Open rates, crushed it.

142
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:16,479
Same list.

143
00:03:16,539 --> 00:03:18,319
Click rates, crushed it.

144
00:03:18,379 --> 00:03:19,219
Placed order rates up.

145
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:19,789
Revenue up.

146
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,409
That's just, it's just what the

147
00:03:21,419 --> 00:03:22,169
numbers say.

148
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:24,479
I highly recommend that.

149
00:03:24,539 --> 00:03:26,229
But 2x per day, ramming content

150
00:03:26,229 --> 00:03:27,879
down the customer's throat.

151
00:03:27,939 --> 00:03:28,610
They get annoyed.

152
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,919
You want to send a healthy amount.

153
00:03:29,979 --> 00:03:31,610
But more importantly, we want to

154
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,030
send the right content.

155
00:03:33,099 --> 00:03:34,439
So that's what we're going to talk

156
00:03:34,449 --> 00:03:35,120
about next.

157
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,740
If you only send sales-focused

158
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:38,039
emails at your audience, then

159
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:39,240
they're going to be annoyed no

160
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,139
matter how much you send.

161
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:41,060
Even if it's once per week.

162
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:41,990
They're going to be like, why is

163
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:42,419
this a sale?

164
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,960
Why is it just this?

165
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,110
But what about giving them value?

166
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:47,240
Giving them entertainment.

167
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,520
Giving them tips and tricks.

168
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:49,219
Things like that.

169
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,240
That's just the healthy balance.

170
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,759
If you can find that, you're going

171
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:55,099
to be able to print cash while at

172
00:03:55,099 --> 00:03:56,150
the same time building a

173
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:57,430
passionate fan base and not

174
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:58,319
annoying your list.

175
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:00,189
So this is what we want our fans

176
00:04:00,189 --> 00:04:00,759
to be.

177
00:04:00,819 --> 00:04:02,120
We want them to be rooting for us.

178
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,780
So what to send?

179
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:06,289
Again, nobody wants the pick-me

180
00:04:06,289 --> 00:04:07,199
type content.

181
00:04:07,259 --> 00:04:08,159
That's kind of the vibe you give

182
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:09,120
off when it's just like sales,

183
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:09,750
sales, sales.

184
00:04:09,819 --> 00:04:10,439
Just like pick me.

185
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:10,919
Buy from us.

186
00:04:10,979 --> 00:04:11,469
Buy from us.

187
00:04:11,539 --> 00:04:12,500
You seem needy.

188
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,889
Nobody wants to buy from someone

189
00:04:13,889 --> 00:04:14,340
needy.

190
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,409
Create sales resistance.

191
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:17,000
So we want to be altruistic.

192
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,639
We want to avoid asking for sales.

193
00:04:18,699 --> 00:04:20,480
We want to make it seem like we're

194
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,620
better off without the customer.

195
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,689
We want to make them feel special,

196
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:24,550
but we want to make sure that

197
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:25,560
there's a balance there.

198
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:27,319
So by being altruistic and

199
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:28,879
avoiding asking for sales so

200
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:30,839
constantly, we avoid annoying our

201
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:32,660
list with discounts over and over

202
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,500
again in sales, sales, sales,

203
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,480
buyer stuff.

204
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:36,879
And also you position yourself as

205
00:04:36,889 --> 00:04:38,129
like a sought-after brand who

206
00:04:38,129 --> 00:04:39,740
doesn't need to beg for purchases.

207
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,170
And inherently, that proves to

208
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:42,519
people that you're legit.

209
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:43,949
If you're just sending valuable

210
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,100
content, you're sending good

211
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,300
content, just educating on your

212
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,759
product, people are like, huh,

213
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,439
they kind of know their stuff.

214
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,339
So like this is bad content.

215
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:52,120
You make people mad.

216
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:52,759
Good content.

217
00:04:52,819 --> 00:04:53,519
Tips and tricks.

218
00:04:53,579 --> 00:04:54,639
Message from the founder.

219
00:04:54,699 --> 00:04:55,899
Watch out for this in your

220
00:04:55,899 --> 00:04:56,620
industry.

221
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,899
Watch out for fluoride in your

222
00:04:57,899 --> 00:04:58,360
water.

223
00:04:58,379 --> 00:04:58,699
I don't know.

224
00:04:58,759 --> 00:04:59,269
Something like that.

225
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,620
Our favorite picks for this.

226
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:03,980
What does this, what does creatine

227
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:04,779
mean?

228
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:06,160
What is creatine?

229
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:06,699
Stuff like that.

230
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:07,850
Educational stuff that the

231
00:05:07,949 --> 00:05:09,250
customer will actually enjoy.

232
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:10,819
So this is where we want to be.

233
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:12,920
Education plus positioning.

234
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,420
We want to educate the customer

235
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:15,910
and then position them on our,

236
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:17,459
position our product as like the

237
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:18,300
solution.

238
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,699
So the modern customer today, they

239
00:05:19,709 --> 00:05:21,000
want to do their due diligence and

240
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,129
they want to understand what

241
00:05:22,129 --> 00:05:23,300
product they're buying.

242
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,819
We're kind of in like, especially

243
00:05:24,819 --> 00:05:26,350
if you're in the health industry,

244
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:28,100
people want to know these things.

245
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,399
We're in like a health awakening,

246
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:32,759
what's the, health enlightenment,

247
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,959
there we go, history class.

248
00:05:35,019 --> 00:05:36,009
So we want to remove as much

249
00:05:36,209 --> 00:05:37,649
friction for them as possible in

250
00:05:37,649 --> 00:05:38,480
that process.

251
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:40,370
We don't want to have them have to

252
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:41,990
go look at a ton of different

253
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:44,040
research studies and whatnot.

254
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,089
We want to give them everything

255
00:05:45,089 --> 00:05:45,759
that they need.

256
00:05:45,819 --> 00:05:48,720
So the content that wins in 2025

257
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,149
for getting sales, it's going to

258
00:05:51,149 --> 00:05:53,220
A, educate the customer on a

259
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:56,259
problem, a process, or a solution.

260
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,350
It'll educate them.

261
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:59,189
And then B, it'll position your

262
00:05:59,189 --> 00:06:00,899
product as the solution and as

263
00:06:00,899 --> 00:06:02,720
the, as like the thing that ties

264
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,000
it all together.

265
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:05,250
And if you can do both, you'll

266
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,600
guide the customer, hold their

267
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,699
hand into making the right

268
00:06:07,699 --> 00:06:09,420
decision, which is going with you

269
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:10,819
if your product's good.

270
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:12,120
And also you're going to earn

271
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,759
trust points in the process, which

272
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,120
are needed to make that buying

273
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:15,860
decision.

274
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,240
So with every piece of valuable

275
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,839
content you give the customer, you

276
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:20,329
earn trust points and you can cash

277
00:06:20,329 --> 00:06:21,759
in on those trust points when you

278
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:22,689
ask for sales.

279
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:24,649
You're going to be able to cash in

280
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,459
on that if they don't buy

281
00:06:25,459 --> 00:06:26,180
automatically.

282
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,550
So product education, promotion,

283
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:30,339
we want the right balance,

284
00:06:30,339 --> 00:06:32,060
everything like that.

285
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:32,959
And that's for every email

286
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:33,459
campaign.

287
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:34,740
We want to have that balance.

288
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,850
So how we do that is we're going

289
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:38,490
to use micro topics.

290
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,160
This is something that I made up

291
00:06:40,189 --> 00:06:41,810
that I've seen work the best,

292
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:43,339
which again, we're going to

293
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:44,959
continue to talk about.

294
00:06:45,019 --> 00:06:46,519
So micro topics are just little

295
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:48,209
subtopics of information on your

296
00:06:48,209 --> 00:06:50,069
industry, your process, whatever

297
00:06:50,069 --> 00:06:51,759
it may be, and your product.

298
00:06:51,819 --> 00:06:52,699
Just little subtopics of

299
00:06:53,009 --> 00:06:53,339
information.

300
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:55,259
So this allows the customer to

301
00:06:55,259 --> 00:06:57,259
digest the information easier

302
00:06:57,259 --> 00:06:59,399
because it's easier to just learn

303
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:01,779
one little micro topic, get taught

304
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:03,610
one little thing rather than

305
00:07:03,629 --> 00:07:05,939
trying to learn like 10 points in

306
00:07:05,939 --> 00:07:07,529
one email where we're overwhelming

307
00:07:07,529 --> 00:07:08,139
the customer.

308
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:08,899
That just doesn't work.

309
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,540
So each email, like we have to

310
00:07:10,569 --> 00:07:12,290
understand also the customer, each

311
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:13,639
email is getting viewed for a

312
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:15,459
maximum of three to five seconds.

313
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:17,019
Nobody's sitting down annotating

314
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:18,600
their emails being like, oh, it's

315
00:07:18,699 --> 00:07:19,860
time to check my email.

316
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,519
And no, that's just not what's

317
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:22,720
happening today.

318
00:07:22,779 --> 00:07:23,769
People are checking their email

319
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:25,089
while they're at a red light.

320
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:26,250
As bad as it is, people will check

321
00:07:26,449 --> 00:07:27,720
their email while they're driving

322
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,800
like that and just quickly,

323
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,920
quickly skim something while

324
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,459
they're waiting for the bathroom.

325
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:32,230
They'll just quickly check their

326
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:32,480
email.

327
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:33,829
So we just want to focus on one

328
00:07:33,829 --> 00:07:35,420
specific point in each email that

329
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,949
our customer, who's brain dead

330
00:07:36,949 --> 00:07:38,310
right now in that – not that

331
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:39,519
they're brain dead.

332
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,589
I'm not – just in that when

333
00:07:40,769 --> 00:07:41,889
they're scrolling their phone,

334
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,939
they're brain dead.

335
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,779
They're kind of on autopilot.

336
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,069
So we just want to make it super

337
00:07:46,069 --> 00:07:46,839
easy for them.

338
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:48,569
If we try to give them too much,

339
00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:50,360
they're not going to get any.

340
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:51,379
But if we try to give them one

341
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:52,490
thing, they'll take that one

342
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:52,889
thing.

343
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:54,490
So just ask yourself when you're

344
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:55,540
creating your email, what is the

345
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:56,480
one thing I want my customer to

346
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,839
know after looking at this email?

347
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,519
One email, one topic, one

348
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:00,379
takeaway.

349
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:01,439
That's it.

350
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,420
And that is the micro-topic

351
00:08:02,689 --> 00:08:03,629
philosophy in the campaigns that

352
00:08:03,629 --> 00:08:04,399
you're sending.

353
00:08:04,459 --> 00:08:05,819
And again, we'll go over this.

354
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:07,649
So customers, like back in the

355
00:08:07,649 --> 00:08:09,620
day, this is like an easy example

356
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:10,800
that I think of.

357
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:11,949
It's like, oh, yes, the morning

358
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:12,459
newspaper.

359
00:08:12,509 --> 00:08:13,819
I can't wait to read all these

360
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:14,759
long articles.

361
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:15,240
Awesome.

362
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,610
But now, like, customer, thanks

363
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,959
to, like, all these social media

364
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:22,350
platforms, they'd rather do weird

365
00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:24,379
things than actually read.

366
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:26,100
And, like, nobody reads like that

367
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,639
in terms of, like, the younger

368
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:29,079
audience and people who are on

369
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:30,000
their phone.

370
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:30,959
They're not doing that to read.

371
00:08:31,019 --> 00:08:32,460
People like reading, but when they

372
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:33,908
set time aside to read, the people

373
00:08:33,908 --> 00:08:35,309
aren't setting aside time to read

374
00:08:35,309 --> 00:08:36,019
their email.

375
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,519
So that is kind of the campaign

376
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,038
strategy that we're doing.

377
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,519
We want to educate and position

378
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:42,168
ourselves by sending good content

379
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:43,480
and by sending educational

380
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,110
content.

381
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,549
And how we do that is by sending

382
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:46,259
micro-topics.

383
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,750
And we're sending those three to

384
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:48,830
four times per week.

385
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:50,460
So that is the campaign strategy

386
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:51,740
that we want to follow.

387
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:54,879
Okay, so we had our campaigns

388
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:55,980
intro.

389
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:57,879
Now let's get into, like, actually

390
00:08:57,879 --> 00:08:59,519
the strategy of campaigns.

391
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,120
Again, campaigns, one-time emails

392
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,580
that we're sending to our list.

393
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:04,570
Okay, so how often do we want to

394
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:05,919
send our emails?

395
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,919
So I'm going to save you now three

396
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:09,840
years, over three years of A-B

397
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,139
testing on campaign frequency.

398
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,350
We've tested it all from two per

399
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:16,129
day for some brands to two per

400
00:09:16,129 --> 00:09:16,830
month.

401
00:09:16,899 --> 00:09:17,940
This is what we found.

402
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,769
So this is the different sending

403
00:09:19,769 --> 00:09:21,600
frequencies kind of like you can

404
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,779
do, grouped in.

405
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:23,899
So sending one to two times per

406
00:09:24,049 --> 00:09:24,240
week.

407
00:09:24,299 --> 00:09:25,559
Customer kind of forgets about

408
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:25,899
you.

409
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,539
Anything lasts.

410
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,659
The customer doesn't really

411
00:09:27,789 --> 00:09:29,059
recognize you in the inbox.

412
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,370
And it's kind of just more of a

413
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:31,870
shock to see you in the inbox.

414
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:33,200
And so they're unable to form that

415
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,639
habit of just consistently opening

416
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:35,299
your emails.

417
00:09:35,419 --> 00:09:36,620
It's not quite enough.

418
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:37,690
And you're just leaving money on

419
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:38,159
the table.

420
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,820
You get lower unsubscribes.

421
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:42,190
And this can be okay.

422
00:09:42,299 --> 00:09:43,659
But you're just leaving money on

423
00:09:43,659 --> 00:09:44,279
the table.

424
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:45,940
We want to get as much money as we

425
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:47,419
can from our email list.

426
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,070
And so you're just leaving money

427
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:49,809
on the table.

428
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,519
You're not really getting the

429
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,460
customer too familiar and situated

430
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,159
with you.

431
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:55,120
And then let's go on the other

432
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:55,980
side of the spectrum.

433
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:57,340
Let's say five to seven times per

434
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:58,730
week where we're sending almost

435
00:09:58,730 --> 00:09:59,379
every day.

436
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,990
You get higher unsubscribes.

437
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,490
You get customers that can be a

438
00:10:02,529 --> 00:10:03,899
little bit more annoying.

439
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,049
It dilutes the power of your

440
00:10:05,149 --> 00:10:05,690
messaging.

441
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:07,870
So anytime you send something, it

442
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:09,980
holds less weight because you're

443
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:11,360
sending so often.

444
00:10:11,419 --> 00:10:12,620
And then your revenue kind of

445
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:14,110
plateaus at a certain point where

446
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:15,480
you get diminishing returns.

447
00:10:15,539 --> 00:10:17,139
Where sending, you have like a,

448
00:10:17,169 --> 00:10:18,899
it's like an exponential graph.

449
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:20,620
And then it like plateaus after a

450
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,600
certain point.

451
00:10:21,659 --> 00:10:23,309
So the juice just isn't quite

452
00:10:23,309 --> 00:10:25,090
worth the squeeze at a certain

453
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:25,700
point.

454
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,620
So that's kind of like where we're

455
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:29,230
at with like the, with sending

456
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:30,720
five to seven times per week.

457
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:32,080
Okay.

458
00:10:32,139 --> 00:10:33,580
And then now going to sending

459
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:35,220
three to four times per week.

460
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:36,740
Get high revenue.

461
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:39,309
You're getting more off the table.

462
00:10:39,379 --> 00:10:40,879
You're getting lower unsubscribes.

463
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,000
You stay top of mind with the

464
00:10:42,129 --> 00:10:42,669
customer.

465
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:43,980
And every email that you send is

466
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,379
like equal weight and impact.

467
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,669
Now, this isn't just like an

468
00:10:46,669 --> 00:10:48,240
arbitrary number that I pulled out

469
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:48,960
of nowhere.

470
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:50,759
The three to four times per week,

471
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:52,440
we've tested different lists.

472
00:10:52,759 --> 00:10:54,429
And sending one list down, sending

473
00:10:54,429 --> 00:10:55,840
like seven times per week.

474
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,429
Another sending once per week.

475
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,710
And then another sending three to

476
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:00,049
four.

477
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,830
We got the highest revenue, the

478
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,860
lowest unsubscribed, and just like

479
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:05,120
the best response.

480
00:11:05,179 --> 00:11:06,519
And this was on an eight-figure

481
00:11:06,529 --> 00:11:06,940
list.

482
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,080
So this is just what the numbers

483
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:09,639
say.

484
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,299
Listen to me if you want.

485
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,659
I'm just going off the numbers.

486
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,960
So kind of just like I like to

487
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,500
think of this as just like you're

488
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,220
sending once per week on Monday.

489
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,330
It's just like what is this brand

490
00:11:18,529 --> 00:11:19,299
doing in my inbox?

491
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,419
Because a customer is subscribed

492
00:11:20,549 --> 00:11:21,669
to, on average, like over 40

493
00:11:21,769 --> 00:11:23,179
e-commerce brands, email lists.

494
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,100
You just get lost.

495
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:25,480
Whereas like sending four times

496
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:26,789
per week, you're able to build

497
00:11:26,789 --> 00:11:27,740
that engagement.

498
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:29,480
You're able to like the customer

499
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,279
can be affiliated with you and see

500
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:32,320
you and like you.

501
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,679
You've strong branded content and

502
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:34,750
you're giving them value.

503
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:35,649
And then it's like, oh, hey, I

504
00:11:35,649 --> 00:11:36,240
know this brand.

505
00:11:36,269 --> 00:11:36,879
I like this brand.

506
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:38,440
So there's that.

507
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,480
So again, just once per week isn't

508
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,580
going to cut it.

509
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:42,740
They're exposed to over 70

510
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:44,309
different e-commerce brands every

511
00:11:44,309 --> 00:11:44,700
day.

512
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,470
Younger audience can be even

513
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:47,970
double with just the amount of

514
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:49,600
brands out there like over one

515
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:50,740
week and the amount of ads people

516
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:51,220
are seeing.

517
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:52,700
There's like 490 different brands.

518
00:11:52,759 --> 00:11:53,970
So it's very, very easy for you to

519
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:54,879
get lost in the mix.

520
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:56,539
And your engagement and your open

521
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:57,940
rate will drop as a result of

522
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:59,679
sending once per week, which a lot

523
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:00,960
of people don't expect.

524
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,139
It's just the customer isn't able

525
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:02,940
to get in that habit.

526
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,379
This was the result from pumping a

527
00:12:04,379 --> 00:12:05,870
client from 2x per week to 4 per

528
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:06,340
week.

529
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,210
Open rates, crushed it.

530
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:08,879
Same list.

531
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:10,720
Click rates, crushed it.

532
00:12:10,779 --> 00:12:11,639
Placed order rates up.

533
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:12,190
Revenue up.

534
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,059
That's just, it's just what the

535
00:12:14,059 --> 00:12:14,700
numbers say.

536
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:16,899
I highly recommend that.

537
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,649
But 2x per day, ramming content

538
00:12:18,649 --> 00:12:20,299
down the customer's throat.

539
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,029
They get annoyed.

540
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,340
You want to send a healthy amount.

541
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,029
But more importantly, we want to

542
00:12:24,039 --> 00:12:25,450
send the right content.

543
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:26,860
So that's what we're going to talk

544
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:27,539
about next.

545
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,840
If you only send sales-focused

546
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,139
emails at your audience, then

547
00:12:30,139 --> 00:12:31,389
they're going to be annoyed no

548
00:12:31,389 --> 00:12:32,559
matter how much you send.

549
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:33,480
Even if it's once per week.

550
00:12:33,539 --> 00:12:34,409
They're going to be like, why is

551
00:12:34,409 --> 00:12:34,840
this a sale?

552
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:37,379
Why is it just this?

553
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,529
But what about giving them value?

554
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,659
Giving them entertainment.

555
00:12:39,779 --> 00:12:40,940
Giving them tips and tricks.

556
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:41,639
Things like that.

557
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:44,559
That's just the healthy balance.

558
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:46,080
If you can find that, you're going

559
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,419
to be able to print cash while at

560
00:12:47,419 --> 00:12:48,470
the same time building a

561
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:49,690
passionate fan base and not

562
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:50,820
annoying your list.

563
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:52,610
So this is what we want our fans

564
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:53,179
to be.

565
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,539
We want them to be rooting for us.

566
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,200
So what to send?

567
00:12:56,259 --> 00:12:58,440
Again, nobody wants the pick-me

568
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,600
type content.

569
00:12:59,659 --> 00:13:00,559
That's kind of the vibe you give

570
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:01,519
off when it's just like sales,

571
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:02,169
sales, sales.

572
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:02,860
Just like pick me.

573
00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:03,340
Buy from us.

574
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:03,879
Buy from us.

575
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:04,919
You seem needy.

576
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:06,299
Nobody wants to buy from someone

577
00:13:06,309 --> 00:13:06,740
needy.

578
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:07,809
Create sales resistance.

579
00:13:07,879 --> 00:13:09,419
So we want to be altruistic.

580
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,080
We want to avoid asking for sales.

581
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,269
We want to make it seem like we're

582
00:13:13,269 --> 00:13:15,039
better off without the customer.

583
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,110
We want to make them feel special,

584
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:16,970
but we want to make sure that

585
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:17,980
there's a balance there.

586
00:13:18,039 --> 00:13:19,450
So by being altruistic and

587
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:21,059
avoiding asking for sales so

588
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:23,080
constantly, we avoid annoying our

589
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,970
list with discounts over and over

590
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,850
again in sales, sales, sales,

591
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:27,879
buyer stuff.

592
00:13:28,379 --> 00:13:29,570
And also you position yourself as

593
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:30,669
like a sought-after brand who

594
00:13:30,669 --> 00:13:32,159
doesn't need to beg for purchases.

595
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,590
And inherently, that proves to

596
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:34,940
people that you're legit.

597
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,080
If you're not – if you're just

598
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,419
sending valuable content, you're

599
00:13:37,419 --> 00:13:38,519
sending good content, just

600
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:39,879
educating on your product, people

601
00:13:39,879 --> 00:13:41,129
are like, huh, they kind of know

602
00:13:41,129 --> 00:13:41,879
their stuff.

603
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,750
So like this is bad content.

604
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:44,539
You make people mad.

605
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,179
Good content.

606
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:45,940
Tips and tricks.

607
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,059
Message from the founder.

608
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,320
Watch out for this in your

609
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,039
industry.

610
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,320
Watch out for fluoride in your

611
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:50,779
water.

612
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:51,120
I don't know.

613
00:13:51,179 --> 00:13:51,690
Something like that.

614
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:53,100
Our favorite picks for this.

615
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:55,470
What does this – what does

616
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:57,120
creatine mean?

617
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,580
What is creatine?

618
00:13:58,639 --> 00:13:59,120
Stuff like that.

619
00:13:59,179 --> 00:14:00,269
Educational stuff that the

620
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:01,669
customer will actually enjoy.

621
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,240
So this is where we want to be.

622
00:14:03,299 --> 00:14:05,340
Education plus positioning.

623
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:06,840
We want to educate the customer

624
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,389
and then position them on our –

625
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:09,919
position our product as like the

626
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:10,720
solution.

627
00:14:10,779 --> 00:14:12,080
So the modern customer today, they

628
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:13,389
want to do their due diligence and

629
00:14:13,389 --> 00:14:14,490
they want to understand what

630
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:15,700
product they're buying.

631
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:17,269
We're kind of in like – especially

632
00:14:17,269 --> 00:14:18,789
if you're in the health industry,

633
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,500
people want to know these things.

634
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,779
We're in like a health awakening –

635
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:25,210
what's the – health enlightenment.

636
00:14:25,379 --> 00:14:25,919
There we go.

637
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:27,379
History class.

638
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,429
So we want to remove as much

639
00:14:28,629 --> 00:14:30,070
friction for them as possible in

640
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:30,899
that process.

641
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,789
We don't want to have them have to

642
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:34,409
go look at a ton of different

643
00:14:34,409 --> 00:14:36,460
research studies and whatnot.

644
00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:37,509
We want to give them everything

645
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:38,179
that they need.

646
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,320
So the content that wins in 2025

647
00:14:41,419 --> 00:14:43,899
for getting sales, it's going to

648
00:14:43,899 --> 00:14:46,110
A, educate the customer on a

649
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:48,679
problem, a process, or a solution.

650
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:49,750
It will educate them.

651
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,129
And then B, it will position your

652
00:14:52,129 --> 00:14:53,879
product as the solution and as

653
00:14:53,879 --> 00:14:55,629
like the thing that ties it all

654
00:14:55,629 --> 00:14:56,419
together.

655
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,730
And if you can do both, you'll

656
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,169
guide the customer, hold their

657
00:14:59,169 --> 00:15:00,340
hand into making the right

658
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:01,879
decision, which is going with you

659
00:15:01,879 --> 00:15:03,240
if your product is good.

660
00:15:03,299 --> 00:15:04,580
And also you're going to earn

661
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:06,159
trust points in the process which

662
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:07,539
are needed to make that buying

663
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:08,279
decision.

664
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,629
So with every piece of valuable

665
00:15:09,629 --> 00:15:11,210
content you give the customer, you

666
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:12,580
earn trust points, and you can

667
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:14,039
cash in on those trust points when

668
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:15,100
you ask for sales.

669
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,090
You're going to be able to cash in

670
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:17,899
on that if they don't buy

671
00:15:17,899 --> 00:15:18,590
automatically.

672
00:15:18,659 --> 00:15:20,970
So product education, promotion,

673
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,759
we want the right balance,

674
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:24,480
everything like that.

675
00:15:24,539 --> 00:15:25,379
And that's for every email

676
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:25,879
campaign.

677
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:27,159
We want to have that balance.

678
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:29,539
So how we do that is we're going

679
00:15:29,539 --> 00:15:31,059
to use microtopics.

680
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,720
This is something that I made up

681
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,350
that I've seen work the best,

682
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,889
which again, we're going to

683
00:15:35,889 --> 00:15:37,379
continue to talk about.

684
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,940
So microtopics are just little

685
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,629
subtopics of information on your

686
00:15:40,629 --> 00:15:42,490
industry, your process, whatever

687
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:44,159
it may be, and your product.

688
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,100
Just little subtopics of

689
00:15:45,409 --> 00:15:45,759
information.

690
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,679
So this allows the customer to

691
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:49,679
digest the information easier

692
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:51,830
because it's easier to just learn

693
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:54,240
one little microtopic, get taught

694
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:56,049
one little thing rather than

695
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:58,379
trying to learn like 10 points in

696
00:15:58,379 --> 00:15:59,950
one email where we're overwhelming

697
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:00,539
the customer.

698
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,320
That just doesn't work.

699
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,019
So each email, like we have to

700
00:16:03,049 --> 00:16:04,750
understand also the customer, each

701
00:16:04,789 --> 00:16:06,070
email is getting viewed for a

702
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:07,879
maximum of three to five seconds.

703
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,440
Nobody's sitting down annotating

704
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,019
their emails being like, oh, it's

705
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,279
time to check my email.

706
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:13,940
And no, that's just not what's

707
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:15,139
happening today.

708
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,190
People are checking their email

709
00:16:16,389 --> 00:16:17,509
while they're at a red light.

710
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:18,669
As bad as it is, people will check

711
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:20,139
their email while they're driving

712
00:16:20,139 --> 00:16:21,220
like that and just quickly,

713
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,330
quickly skim something while

714
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:23,860
they're waiting for the bathroom.

715
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:24,629
They'll just quickly check their

716
00:16:24,629 --> 00:16:24,879
email.

717
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:26,230
So we just want to focus on one

718
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:27,820
specific point in each email that

719
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,350
our customer, who's brain dead

720
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:30,710
right now in that – not that

721
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:31,919
they're brain dead.

722
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,009
I'm not – just in that when

723
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:34,309
they're scrolling their phone,

724
00:16:34,419 --> 00:16:35,360
they're brain dead.

725
00:16:35,419 --> 00:16:37,200
They're kind of on autopilot.

726
00:16:37,259 --> 00:16:38,460
So we just want to make it super

727
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:39,240
easy for them.

728
00:16:39,299 --> 00:16:40,970
If we try to give them too much,

729
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:42,779
they're not going to get any.

730
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,799
But if we try to give them one

731
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:44,909
thing, they'll take that one

732
00:16:44,909 --> 00:16:45,309
thing.

733
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:46,929
So just ask yourself when you're

734
00:16:46,929 --> 00:16:47,980
creating your email, what is the

735
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:48,909
one thing I want my customer to

736
00:16:48,909 --> 00:16:50,279
know after looking at this email?

737
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,940
One email, one topic, one

738
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:52,779
takeaway.

739
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:53,850
That's it.

740
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:54,840
And that is the micro-topic

741
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:56,049
philosophy in the campaigns that

742
00:16:56,049 --> 00:16:56,820
you're sending.

743
00:16:56,879 --> 00:16:58,220
And again, we'll go over this.

744
00:16:58,279 --> 00:17:00,049
So customers, like back in the

745
00:17:00,049 --> 00:17:02,019
day, this is like an easy example

746
00:17:02,019 --> 00:17:03,200
that I think of.

747
00:17:03,259 --> 00:17:04,348
It's like, oh, yes, the morning

748
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:04,859
newspaper.

749
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:06,240
I can't wait to read all these

750
00:17:06,269 --> 00:17:07,180
long articles.

751
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:07,660
Awesome.

752
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,160
But now, like, customer, thanks

753
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,390
to, like, all these social media

754
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:14,690
platforms, they'd rather do weird

755
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:16,769
things than actually read.

756
00:17:16,838 --> 00:17:18,500
And, like, nobody reads like that

757
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,039
in terms of, like, the younger

758
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,480
audience and people who are on

759
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,420
their phone.

760
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,380
They're not doing that to read.

761
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,880
People like reading, but when they

762
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,328
set time aside to read, the people

763
00:17:26,328 --> 00:17:27,730
aren't setting aside time to read

764
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:28,440
their email.

765
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,940
So that is kind of the campaign

766
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,460
strategy that we're doing.

767
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:32,910
We want to educate and position

768
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:34,529
ourselves by sending good content

769
00:17:34,529 --> 00:17:35,809
and by sending educational

770
00:17:35,809 --> 00:17:36,480
content.

771
00:17:36,539 --> 00:17:37,839
And how we do that is by sending

772
00:17:37,869 --> 00:17:38,700
micro-topics.

773
00:17:38,759 --> 00:17:40,160
And we're sending those three to

774
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,250
four times per week.

775
00:17:41,319 --> 00:17:42,880
So that is the campaign strategy

776
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,160
that we want to follow.
