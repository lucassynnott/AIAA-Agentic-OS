1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:01,929
Okay, and moving on to core

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,139
principle number three,

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,370
which is engaging, not having

4
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:07,980
boring, boring copy.

5
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:09,060
So engaging is just like the

6
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:10,439
entertainment of the content

7
00:00:10,539 --> 00:00:11,560
that you're sending to your list.

8
00:00:11,619 --> 00:00:13,050
So the customer is craving

9
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:13,839
dopamine.

10
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:15,519
That's where we are at in this

11
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:16,140
world.

12
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:17,379
You need to have dopamine at all

13
00:00:17,539 --> 00:00:17,960
times.

14
00:00:18,019 --> 00:00:18,890
People are scrolling TikTok,

15
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,179
they're scrolling Instagram all

16
00:00:20,339 --> 00:00:20,980
day, every day.

17
00:00:21,079 --> 00:00:22,579
They're eating sugar all day,

18
00:00:22,579 --> 00:00:23,300
every day.

19
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:24,230
If we're not gonna be able to give

20
00:00:24,309 --> 00:00:24,879
them dopamine,

21
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:27,160
they're not going to want to read

22
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,120
our stuff.

23
00:00:28,179 --> 00:00:29,339
So we need to give that to them.

24
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:30,989
We want our emails to be engaging

25
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:31,420
enough

26
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:32,298
to trigger dopamine in the

27
00:00:32,298 --> 00:00:33,060
customer's brain.

28
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:34,280
This is gonna lead to a positive

29
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,799
association with our brand

30
00:00:35,939 --> 00:00:37,359
and then results in future opens

31
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:37,929
and sales.

32
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:39,719
If we give them dopamine one time,

33
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:40,929
they're much more likely to keep

34
00:00:40,929 --> 00:00:41,539
coming back.

35
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,780
So that's super, super key.

36
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:45,149
So the first thing that we wanna

37
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:45,869
focus on

38
00:00:45,939 --> 00:00:47,880
is having our copy be punchy.

39
00:00:47,939 --> 00:00:50,200
A punchy email with punchy copy is

40
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,310
short, but full of power.

41
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:54,229
You can tell with the strength of

42
00:00:54,229 --> 00:00:54,789
the words

43
00:00:54,859 --> 00:00:55,969
that it's just like, it's just

44
00:00:55,969 --> 00:00:56,979
like one, two, boom.

45
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:58,719
It's just very punchy.

46
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,240
It evokes emotion and the

47
00:01:00,409 --> 00:01:02,049
information is very, very dense.

48
00:01:02,119 --> 00:01:04,099
The below examples do a great job

49
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:05,719
at injecting their information

50
00:01:05,719 --> 00:01:07,200
into small amounts of space.

51
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:08,939
Small amounts of space.

52
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,829
So having ton of information in

53
00:01:10,829 --> 00:01:12,260
short little areas.

54
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:13,500
So here's an example.

55
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,079
Don't just buy shit, invest in

56
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:15,560
yours,

57
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:16,799
which is a banger email.

58
00:01:17,379 --> 00:01:19,260
So right here with two daily

59
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:23,340
capsules containing 53 billion, I

60
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:24,140
think.

61
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,359
Or is that trillion?

62
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:26,310
No, it's billion.

63
00:01:26,379 --> 00:01:27,359
53 billion.

64
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,180
You give the whole body benefits

65
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:30,370
of all this stuff.

66
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:32,340
Short, punchy, to the point, has a

67
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:33,079
lot of information.

68
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:34,319
And then right here, you will

69
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,859
spend 92 days or 2,200 hours of

70
00:01:36,989 --> 00:01:37,739
your life on the toilet.

71
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:39,030
Want to make that time feel

72
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:39,519
smoother.

73
00:01:39,579 --> 00:01:41,099
Look at that.

74
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:42,640
That is nice and punchy.

75
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:43,879
That engages me.

76
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,519
That's what keeps me engaged.

77
00:01:45,579 --> 00:01:47,040
When every single line that I'm

78
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:47,519
seeing,

79
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:48,900
every single line is giving me

80
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,920
tons of information.

81
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:51,159
And it's giving me stuff to like

82
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:51,959
keep reading.

83
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:53,579
Same thing right here.

84
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,500
Nice and punchy.

85
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,989
Every little word packs a punch

86
00:01:56,989 --> 00:01:57,420
here.

87
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,079
Sugary cereal is delicious for

88
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,040
many reasons.

89
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:01,780
Added sugars, empty carbs, and

90
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:02,150
more.

91
00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:03,290
That's why we recreated your

92
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:04,340
childhood favorites.

93
00:02:04,379 --> 00:02:05,219
Tastes just as good.

94
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,459
But now with ingredients we're

95
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:07,120
proud of.

96
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,580
Amazing.

97
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,400
Packed with protein.

98
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:11,139
Zero sugar.

99
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:12,870
Magic Spoon helps you power

100
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,599
through the day with less cravings

101
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:15,300
and more energy.

102
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:16,379
Cut back on added sugars and

103
00:02:16,389 --> 00:02:17,180
processed carbs.

104
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,419
Perfect for the keto lifestyle.

105
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:20,310
This is short, punchy, 100%

106
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:22,000
gluten-free and grain-free.

107
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:22,599
That's right.

108
00:02:22,659 --> 00:02:23,840
No corn or wheat around here.

109
00:02:23,979 --> 00:02:25,689
It's just punchy to the point.

110
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:26,520
Has some life.

111
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:28,560
But it's not like too much.

112
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:29,259
Impressed?

113
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:30,319
Honestly, we still are.

114
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:32,199
That is what keeps people engaged.

115
00:02:32,259 --> 00:02:33,439
That is what gives them dopamine.

116
00:02:33,539 --> 00:02:35,930
That's what creates engaging copy.

117
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,539
We're not rambling on and on about

118
00:02:37,539 --> 00:02:38,860
stupid little things.

119
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:39,150
No.

120
00:02:39,219 --> 00:02:41,139
Short, punchy, to the point.

121
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:43,469
Also, informational.

122
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,120
So we talked about punchy, putting

123
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,860
things, making things powerful.

124
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:48,319
Now we want informational.

125
00:02:48,379 --> 00:02:51,060
You don't need to be Shane Gillis

126
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:53,479
or just Dave Chappelle.

127
00:02:53,539 --> 00:02:55,530
For copy to be engaging, that's a

128
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,039
big misconception.

129
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,319
People think for copy to be

130
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,860
engaging, you need to be funny.

131
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,460
You need to be cracking jokes.

132
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:02,370
No, you don't.

133
00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:03,500
That's not everybody's brand.

134
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,259
Not everybody's brand is cracking

135
00:03:05,259 --> 00:03:06,050
jokes like Dr.

136
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:06,759
Squatch.

137
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:08,330
Informational is another way you

138
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:09,500
can keep your copy really

139
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,180
engaging.

140
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,419
People love to learn and they want

141
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:12,620
to be able to make an educated

142
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:13,740
decision in the purchasing

143
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:14,979
process.

144
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,680
If you can give people facts,

145
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,900
people will engage with your

146
00:03:17,979 --> 00:03:18,919
emails more often.

147
00:03:18,979 --> 00:03:19,960
They want to know information.

148
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:20,900
They like learning.

149
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,539
My favorite book growing up was

150
00:03:23,539 --> 00:03:24,460
fact books.

151
00:03:25,099 --> 00:03:26,729
I loved reading fact books and

152
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,599
there wasn't like fun and nothing

153
00:03:28,629 --> 00:03:29,909
fun about that in terms

154
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:30,879
of like it being funny.

155
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,560
But if someone learns something

156
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:34,090
new every time they open your

157
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:35,699
email, you're in a good place

158
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:36,639
because they know they're

159
00:03:36,699 --> 00:03:37,699
benefiting from being on your

160
00:03:37,699 --> 00:03:38,870
email list and they're going to

161
00:03:38,889 --> 00:03:39,080
keep

162
00:03:39,139 --> 00:03:39,289
reading.

163
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:40,879
So keep your copy as informational

164
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:41,469
as possible.

165
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,270
So heard about golden root

166
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:45,460
talking, educating people.

167
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,139
Have you heard about this?

168
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:47,629
Known for centuries in older Asian

169
00:03:47,629 --> 00:03:48,879
and European mountains for its

170
00:03:48,969 --> 00:03:50,300
ability to yada, yada, yada,

171
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,280
yada, 140 active compounds.

172
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:54,159
It's just one of the amazing.

173
00:03:54,219 --> 00:03:55,560
Look at how informational that is.

174
00:03:55,699 --> 00:03:57,689
I just learned something golden

175
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,800
root and it's called Rhodiola Rose

176
00:04:00,009 --> 00:04:01,360
and it's in this product.

177
00:04:01,419 --> 00:04:02,310
So it ties things in.

178
00:04:02,379 --> 00:04:03,169
Amazing.

179
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,419
Super informational.

180
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,889
And then this example right here,

181
00:04:05,889 --> 00:04:06,699
informational.

182
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:08,669
Five ways nature supports mental

183
00:04:08,669 --> 00:04:09,340
health.

184
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,580
Spending just 20, 30 minutes

185
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:11,990
outside reduces the stress hormone

186
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:12,530
cortisol.

187
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:14,590
Exposing yourself to natural light

188
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,900
can improve mood.

189
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,379
Improve attention and memory up to

190
00:04:17,379 --> 00:04:17,920
20%.

191
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:19,160
I'm learning stuff from this

192
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:19,759
email.

193
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:20,759
I'm going to keep it.

194
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,980
I'm going to keep engaging.

195
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,800
And this email is engaging.

196
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:24,459
It keeps me interested.

197
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:25,399
What's the next point?

198
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:26,230
What's the next thing I'm going to

199
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:26,540
learn?

200
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,300
And then another thing is keeping

201
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,949
things entertaining, which we

202
00:04:29,949 --> 00:04:30,660
talked about.

203
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,129
You don't need to have it like be

204
00:04:32,129 --> 00:04:33,850
funny necessarily, but you can

205
00:04:33,889 --> 00:04:36,310
really spice things up by making

206
00:04:36,379 --> 00:04:38,089
it entertaining with jokes, puns,

207
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,879
puzzles, et cetera, all that stuff

208
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:41,259
and keeping things punchy.

209
00:04:41,379 --> 00:04:42,860
The worst thing that you can do is

210
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:43,759
be repetitive.

211
00:04:43,819 --> 00:04:45,290
That's kind of like the main thing

212
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:46,709
that I want you to understand is

213
00:04:46,709 --> 00:04:48,139
for things to be entertaining.

214
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:49,889
You can't just send the same thing

215
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:51,579
over and over and over again.

216
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:52,819
We need to mix it up.

217
00:04:52,899 --> 00:04:53,560
That's how you keep things

218
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:54,069
entertaining.

219
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,279
So a good example here, super

220
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:57,610
funny email from Dr.

221
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:58,040
Squatch.

222
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,540
How to last longer, last longer,

223
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:01,079
shower harder, have more fun.

224
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:02,319
It's like a butter pill for your

225
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:02,800
soap.

226
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,040
So that's super funny.

227
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:05,579
And then tips to last longer.

228
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,230
Obviously, guys are going to perk

229
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:11,139
their ears up or perk their eyes

230
00:05:11,139 --> 00:05:12,879
once they see this email.

231
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:14,139
That's super funny.

232
00:05:14,339 --> 00:05:15,519
Same thing here.

233
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:16,560
This is entertaining.

234
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:17,800
Look at this flow chart.

235
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:19,579
Work bag, ready, go.

236
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:20,319
Follow the prompt.

237
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:22,259
So this is kind of like copy

238
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:24,149
that's engaging, keeps me

239
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:26,569
entertained, and it feels custom

240
00:05:26,569 --> 00:05:27,060
to me.

241
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,579
So these are great ways to keep

242
00:05:28,579 --> 00:05:30,160
your emails entertaining.

243
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,220
And then infographics.

244
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:33,959
That's how you can keep things

245
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:35,949
entertaining, engaged, and tie

246
00:05:36,129 --> 00:05:37,449
this all together is with

247
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:38,829
infographics, which we're talking

248
00:05:38,829 --> 00:05:39,850
about in the next module.

249
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,740
Okay, and moving on to core

250
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,949
principle number three, which is

251
00:05:44,949 --> 00:05:45,850
engaging.

252
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,189
Not having boring, boring copy.

253
00:05:48,259 --> 00:05:49,220
So engaging is just like the

254
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:50,529
entertainment of the content that

255
00:05:50,589 --> 00:05:51,759
you're sending to your list.

256
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:53,269
So the customer is craving

257
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:54,060
dopamine.

258
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,740
That's where we are at in this

259
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:56,360
world.

260
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:57,600
You need to have dopamine at all

261
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:58,180
times.

262
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,110
People are scrolling TikTok.

263
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,399
They're scrolling Instagram all

264
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,199
day, every day.

265
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,800
They're eating sugar all day,

266
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,519
every day.

267
00:06:03,579 --> 00:06:04,930
If we're not going to be able to

268
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:06,540
give them dopamine, they are not

269
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:08,339
going to want to read our stuff.

270
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:09,560
So we need to give that to them.

271
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:10,810
We want our emails to be engaging

272
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:12,300
enough to trigger dopamine in the

273
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:13,290
customer's brain.

274
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,389
This is going to lead to a

275
00:06:14,389 --> 00:06:15,759
positive association with our

276
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:17,279
brand and then results in future

277
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:18,170
opens and sales.

278
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,689
If we give them dopamine one time,

279
00:06:19,689 --> 00:06:20,980
they're much more likely to keep

280
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:21,759
coming back.

281
00:06:21,819 --> 00:06:23,000
So that's super, super key.

282
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,290
So the first thing that we want to

283
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:27,220
focus on is having our copy be

284
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:27,930
punchy.

285
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,550
A punchy email with punchy copy is

286
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:32,540
short but full of power.

287
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,110
You can tell with the strength of

288
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:35,680
the words that it's just like,

289
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,839
whop-ah, it's just like a one-two,

290
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:37,199
boom.

291
00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:38,939
It's just very punchy.

292
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,180
It evokes emotion, and the

293
00:06:40,339 --> 00:06:42,279
information is very, very dense.

294
00:06:42,339 --> 00:06:43,990
The below examples do a great job

295
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:45,699
at injecting their information

296
00:06:45,699 --> 00:06:47,420
into small amounts of space.

297
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,379
So having a ton of information in

298
00:06:50,379 --> 00:06:52,290
short little areas.

299
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,740
So here's an example.

300
00:06:53,939 --> 00:06:55,350
Don't just buy shit, invest in

301
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:57,069
yours, which is a banger email.

302
00:06:57,139 --> 00:06:59,620
So right here with two daily

303
00:06:59,629 --> 00:07:03,389
capsules containing 53 billion, I

304
00:07:03,529 --> 00:07:04,360
think?

305
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:05,560
Or is that trillion?

306
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:06,509
No, it's billion.

307
00:07:06,899 --> 00:07:08,720
53 billion, you give the whole

308
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,569
body benefits of all this stuff.

309
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,230
Short, punchy, to the point, has a

310
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:13,319
lot of information.

311
00:07:13,379 --> 00:07:14,560
And then right here, you will

312
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,660
spend 92 days or 2,200 hours of

313
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:17,959
your life on the toilet.

314
00:07:18,019 --> 00:07:19,110
Want to make that time feel

315
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:19,730
smoother.

316
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,319
Look at that.

317
00:07:21,379 --> 00:07:22,860
That is nice and punchy.

318
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,100
That engages me.

319
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,740
That's what keeps me engaged.

320
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:27,259
When every single line that I'm

321
00:07:27,259 --> 00:07:28,560
seeing, every single line is

322
00:07:28,649 --> 00:07:30,620
giving me tons of information, and

323
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:31,600
it's giving me stuff to, like,

324
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,209
keep reading.

325
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:33,779
Same thing right here.

326
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:35,720
Nice and punchy.

327
00:07:35,779 --> 00:07:37,180
Every little word packs a punch

328
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:37,620
here.

329
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,290
Sugary cereal is delicious for

330
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:40,259
many reasons.

331
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:41,930
Added sugars, empty carbs, and

332
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:42,310
more.

333
00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:43,500
That's why we recreated your

334
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,430
childhood favorites.

335
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,439
Tastes just as good.

336
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:46,829
But now with ingredients we're

337
00:07:46,829 --> 00:07:47,339
proud of.

338
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:48,819
Amazing.

339
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,639
Packed with protein.

340
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:51,360
Zero sugar.

341
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:52,600
Magic Spoon helps you power

342
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:54,529
through the day with less cravings

343
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:55,519
and more energy.

344
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,550
Cut back on added sugars and

345
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:57,389
processed carbs.

346
00:07:57,459 --> 00:07:58,639
Perfect for the keto lifestyle.

347
00:07:58,819 --> 00:08:00,529
This is short, punchy, 100%

348
00:08:00,529 --> 00:08:02,220
gluten-free and grain-free.

349
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:02,819
That's right.

350
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,060
No corn or wheat around here.

351
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:05,970
It's just punchy, to the point,

352
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:07,990
has some life, but it's not, like,

353
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:08,779
too much.

354
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:09,480
Impressed?

355
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:10,519
Honestly, we still are.

356
00:08:10,579 --> 00:08:12,420
That is what keeps people engaged.

357
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,660
That is what gives them dopamine.

358
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:16,160
That's what creates engaging copy.

359
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:17,759
We're not rambling on and on about

360
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,079
stupid little things.

361
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:19,399
No.

362
00:08:19,459 --> 00:08:21,379
Short, punchy, to the point.

363
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:23,709
Also, informational.

364
00:08:23,779 --> 00:08:25,339
So we talked about punchy, putting

365
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:27,100
things, making things powerful.

366
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,540
Now we want informational.

367
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,279
You don't need to be Shane Gillis

368
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:33,720
or just Dave Chappelle.

369
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:35,769
For copy to be engaging, that's a

370
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:37,279
big misconception.

371
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:38,548
People think for copy to be

372
00:08:38,548 --> 00:08:40,220
engaging, you need to be funny.

373
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:41,360
You need to, like, be cracking

374
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:41,759
jokes.

375
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:42,580
Like, no, you don't.

376
00:08:42,658 --> 00:08:43,720
That's not everybody's brand.

377
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,350
Not everybody's brand is, like,

378
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:46,440
cracking jokes like Dr.

379
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:46,980
Squatch.

380
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:48,549
Informational is another way you

381
00:08:48,549 --> 00:08:49,720
can keep your copy really

382
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,399
engaging.

383
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:51,590
People love to learn, and they

384
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:52,450
want to be able to make an

385
00:08:52,539 --> 00:08:53,570
educated decision in the

386
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:55,179
purchasing process.

387
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,419
And so if you can give people

388
00:08:56,419 --> 00:08:57,870
facts, people will engage with

389
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,139
your emails more often.

390
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,179
They want to know information.

391
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,120
They like learning.

392
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:03,409
Like, my favorite book growing up

393
00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:04,990
was, like, fact books.

394
00:09:05,059 --> 00:09:06,720
I loved reading fact books.

395
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:08,240
And there wasn't, like, fun and

396
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,649
nothing fun about that in terms

397
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:11,100
of, like, it being funny.

398
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:12,759
But if someone learns something

399
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:14,289
new every time they open your

400
00:09:14,289 --> 00:09:15,919
email, you're in a good place

401
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:16,909
because they know they're

402
00:09:16,909 --> 00:09:18,009
benefiting from being on your

403
00:09:18,059 --> 00:09:19,039
email list, and they're going to

404
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:19,500
keep reading.

405
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:21,080
So keep your copy as informational

406
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:21,799
as possible.

407
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,600
So heard about Golden Root.

408
00:09:23,659 --> 00:09:25,649
Talking, educating people.

409
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:26,360
Have you heard about this?

410
00:09:26,419 --> 00:09:27,809
Known for centuries in older Asian

411
00:09:27,809 --> 00:09:29,100
and European mountains for its

412
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,840
ability to yada, yada, yada, yada.

413
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:32,500
140 active compounds.

414
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:34,379
It's just one of the amazing.

415
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,779
Look at how informational that is.

416
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:37,700
I just learned something, Golden

417
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,370
Root, and it's called Rhodiola

418
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,230
Rose, and it's in this product, so

419
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:42,519
it ties things in.

420
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:43,399
Amazing.

421
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:44,629
Super informational.

422
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,090
And then this example right here,

423
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:46,919
informational.

424
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,889
Five ways nature supports mental

425
00:09:48,889 --> 00:09:49,559
health.

426
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:50,799
Spending just 20 to 30 minutes

427
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,210
outside reduces the stress hormone

428
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:52,750
cortisol.

429
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,809
Exposing yourself to natural light

430
00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:56,120
can improve mood.

431
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:57,600
Improve attention and memory up to

432
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,139
20%.

433
00:09:58,190 --> 00:09:59,379
I'm learning stuff from this

434
00:09:59,539 --> 00:09:59,980
email.

435
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:02,159
I'm going to keep engaging, and

436
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:04,019
this email is engaging.

437
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:04,679
It keeps me interested.

438
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:05,620
What's the next point?

439
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:06,450
What's the next thing I'm going to

440
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:06,759
learn?

441
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,370
And then another thing is keeping

442
00:10:08,379 --> 00:10:09,929
things entertaining, which we

443
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:10,879
talked about.

444
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,330
You don't need to have it, like,

445
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:14,120
be funny necessarily, but you can

446
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,490
really spice things up by making

447
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,200
it entertaining with jokes, puns,

448
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,009
puzzles, et cetera, all that

449
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,539
stuff, and keeping things punchy.

450
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,080
The worst thing that you can do is

451
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:23,990
be repetitive.

452
00:10:24,059 --> 00:10:25,480
That's kind of, like, the main

453
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,460
thing that I want you to

454
00:10:26,539 --> 00:10:27,879
understand is for things to be

455
00:10:27,909 --> 00:10:29,529
entertaining, you can't just send

456
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:30,909
the same thing over and over and

457
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:31,779
over again.

458
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,019
We need to mix it up.

459
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:33,779
That's how you keep things

460
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:34,289
entertaining.

461
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:36,350
So a good example here, super

462
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:37,480
funny email from Dr.

463
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:38,259
Squatch.

464
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,279
How to last longer.

465
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,779
Last longer, shower harder, have

466
00:10:40,779 --> 00:10:41,299
more fun.

467
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,539
It's like a butter pill for your

468
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:43,019
soap.

469
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,259
So that's super funny.

470
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,799
And then tips to last longer.

471
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,429
Obviously, like, guys are going to

472
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,200
perk their ears up or perk their

473
00:10:51,289 --> 00:10:53,120
eyes once they see this email.

474
00:10:53,179 --> 00:10:54,360
That's super funny.

475
00:10:55,179 --> 00:10:55,600
Same thing here.

476
00:10:55,659 --> 00:10:55,919
Same thing here.

477
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:56,840
This is entertaining.

478
00:10:56,899 --> 00:10:58,080
Look at this flow chart.

479
00:10:58,179 --> 00:10:59,799
Work bag, ready, go.

480
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:00,539
Follow the prompt.

481
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,590
And so this is, like, kind of like

482
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:04,549
copy that's engaging, keeps me

483
00:11:04,549 --> 00:11:06,629
entertained, and it feels custom

484
00:11:06,629 --> 00:11:07,259
to me.

485
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,799
So these are great ways to keep

486
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:10,419
your emails entertaining.

487
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,470
And then infographics.

488
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,129
That's how you can keep things

489
00:11:14,129 --> 00:11:16,000
entertaining, engaged, and tie

490
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,360
this all together is with

491
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,039
infographics, which we're talking

492
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:20,059
about in the next module.

493
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:20,120
Thank you.
