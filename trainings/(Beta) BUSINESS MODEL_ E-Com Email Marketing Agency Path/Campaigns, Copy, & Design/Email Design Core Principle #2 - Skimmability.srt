1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,310
We just covered ease of click, now

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:03,960
we are going to talk about skim

3
00:00:04,099 --> 00:00:04,710
ability.

4
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:07,030
We want to make sure that people

5
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:08,720
can skim our emails.

6
00:00:08,779 --> 00:00:10,490
So, like we said earlier, nobody's

7
00:00:10,699 --> 00:00:12,130
sitting at their desk annotating

8
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:13,009
their emails.

9
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:13,949
They're checking their emails as

10
00:00:13,949 --> 00:00:14,750
they're getting up to go to the

11
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:15,169
bathroom,

12
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:16,539
they're on a quick break, they're

13
00:00:16,539 --> 00:00:17,800
waiting for their kids at soccer

14
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,739
practice just in between drills.

15
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,000
I don't know, but on average you

16
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,089
really only have two to four

17
00:00:22,089 --> 00:00:23,660
seconds to get your email across.

18
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:26,429
It's just, that's just the reality

19
00:00:26,429 --> 00:00:27,820
of the situation,

20
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:29,489
and you need to optimize for the

21
00:00:29,489 --> 00:00:30,820
skim and not the read.

22
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:32,509
So, you really just want these

23
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:33,200
factors.

24
00:00:33,219 --> 00:00:34,420
You want to have simplicity,

25
00:00:34,429 --> 00:00:35,700
simplicity, simplicity.

26
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:37,350
You want to have clear sections,

27
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:38,780
as minimal copy as possible,

28
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:40,399
and clear headlines and the main

29
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:42,020
points just like so somebody can

30
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:43,490
quickly look at it and boom, we're

31
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:43,899
good to go.

32
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:44,880
So, those are the main factors

33
00:00:44,979 --> 00:00:46,009
we're going to talk about.

34
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:46,890
First, we're talking about

35
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:47,399
simplicity.

36
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:48,939
Simplicity will always win.

37
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,539
Adding too much complexity in your

38
00:00:50,539 --> 00:00:51,750
emails will overwhelm the

39
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:52,439
customer.

40
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:54,090
So, that's the first thing.

41
00:00:54,119 --> 00:00:55,079
If you throw a whole bunch of

42
00:00:55,179 --> 00:00:56,210
stuff at a customer right when

43
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:57,109
they open their email,

44
00:00:57,439 --> 00:00:58,179
because, again, they're in zombie

45
00:00:58,210 --> 00:00:58,399
mode.

46
00:00:58,439 --> 00:00:59,700
They don't want to sit down and

47
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,000
read and go through like three

48
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,320
minutes looking through your

49
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:02,810
email.

50
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:03,700
They don't want to read a blog

51
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:04,930
when they're checking their email.

52
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,329
So, if they do open your email and

53
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,609
there's so much going on,

54
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,079
they're just going to leave

55
00:01:08,219 --> 00:01:08,799
because they're like, I don't want

56
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:09,579
to deal with this right now.

57
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:11,310
So, too much complexity will

58
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:12,439
overwhelm.

59
00:01:12,459 --> 00:01:14,209
And then, more importantly,

60
00:01:14,379 --> 00:01:16,079
complex designs will distract from

61
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:17,859
the whole purpose of the email,

62
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:18,840
which is to sell.

63
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:20,099
Took that from David Ogilvie.

64
00:01:20,659 --> 00:01:21,989
But, essentially, if you have so

65
00:01:21,989 --> 00:01:23,129
much going on, you're just

66
00:01:23,129 --> 00:01:24,719
distracting from the bigger point

67
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:25,750
of the email,

68
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:26,859
which is to click and make it easy

69
00:01:26,859 --> 00:01:27,739
for someone to click.

70
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,890
If you're giving so much stuff,

71
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:30,099
that's distracting from it.

72
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,689
So, keep it simple so you just can

73
00:01:31,689 --> 00:01:33,159
easily just skim and understand

74
00:01:33,219 --> 00:01:34,739
the contents of the email.

75
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,349
When possible, also, shorten your

76
00:01:36,349 --> 00:01:37,629
email as much as possible.

77
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:39,769
So, this is a bad example.

78
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,750
There is just so much going on.

79
00:01:41,819 --> 00:01:44,290
So, I am going, in 2024, I am

80
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:45,939
going to, and then there's a

81
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:47,620
sticky note with different font.

82
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,129
And then, there's this, a weird

83
00:01:49,129 --> 00:01:50,819
button that's a different shape.

84
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,549
And then, you have a different

85
00:01:52,549 --> 00:01:54,459
section, which is hack the habit,

86
00:01:54,569 --> 00:01:55,640
keys to success.

87
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,000
And then, all these different

88
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,280
icons and crazy colors and all

89
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,439
this different stuff.

90
00:01:59,459 --> 00:02:00,319
There's just too much going on

91
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:00,599
here.

92
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,920
The colors are distracting.

93
00:02:01,939 --> 00:02:03,500
There's just a lot.

94
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:05,879
I'm too overwhelmed to read it.

95
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,200
Whereas, like this, this is the

96
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:07,920
whole email.

97
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:08,538
Right here.

98
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,520
That is perfect.

99
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:11,270
Nobody's going to be scared of

100
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:12,990
looking at something like this

101
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:14,199
with calm colors.

102
00:02:14,219 --> 00:02:16,539
It's just almost sold out.

103
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,750
This is what it is.

104
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:18,960
Grab this best-selling crisp and

105
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,800
refreshing color.

106
00:02:19,819 --> 00:02:21,530
You can just let the product do

107
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:23,419
the talking a lot of the time.

108
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:24,979
And so, it's just super simple.

109
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,240
Someone can easily open this.

110
00:02:26,259 --> 00:02:27,539
And in two seconds, while they're

111
00:02:27,539 --> 00:02:28,879
getting up to go to the bathroom,

112
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:29,979
they can get this.

113
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,490
And they may as well click because

114
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:32,360
it's that easy.

115
00:02:32,379 --> 00:02:34,090
So, make sure that you're keeping

116
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,949
things as simple, simple, simple

117
00:02:35,949 --> 00:02:36,759
as possible.

118
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,689
Now, another one, which is kind of

119
00:02:39,689 --> 00:02:41,400
underrated, is clear sections.

120
00:02:41,419 --> 00:02:42,740
So, the human brain just likes

121
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:44,030
when things are organized and

122
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:44,530
clear.

123
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,919
So, we want to be smooth with our

124
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:47,360
sections, but we want to be clear

125
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,900
when we're differentiating.

126
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:50,039
So, we let our brain kind of like

127
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:51,319
process things differently.

128
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,099
So, this way, people can clearly

129
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:54,340
see two to three sections,

130
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,930
categorize it in their head, and

131
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:56,979
then skim with ease.

132
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,969
So, the below example, not below,

133
00:02:58,969 --> 00:03:00,240
the below example is how

134
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,039
unprofessional of me, makes it

135
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:03,530
clear what is the intro and what

136
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:04,860
is the product section.

137
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,629
So, you should have clear.

138
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,400
This is obvious.

139
00:03:07,419 --> 00:03:08,009
This is the header.

140
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:08,879
And then this is obvious.

141
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,080
This is the product section.

142
00:03:10,099 --> 00:03:11,639
They're not doing anything crazy.

143
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,090
The colors are a little bit much,

144
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:14,039
but it's kind of clear.

145
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,680
It's a little bit smooth.

146
00:03:15,699 --> 00:03:16,840
It's smooth here.

147
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,229
And it's the same.

148
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,870
The background is the same color

149
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:20,780
as this button.

150
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,629
So, it kind of flows a little

151
00:03:21,629 --> 00:03:21,990
better.

152
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,280
It ties together.

153
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,580
And you just know that these are

154
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:25,740
two different sections.

155
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:28,599
So, that's a good example here.

156
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:29,780
You wouldn't want it to be like a

157
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:30,949
flat, like blocky thing with a

158
00:03:30,949 --> 00:03:32,189
different color because then it

159
00:03:32,189 --> 00:03:33,199
would look awkward.

160
00:03:33,219 --> 00:03:34,590
Like if this was a gray and it was

161
00:03:34,689 --> 00:03:35,349
just cut off.

162
00:03:35,379 --> 00:03:35,740
Like, no.

163
00:03:35,979 --> 00:03:37,280
We want it to be a little bit

164
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:37,729
smooth.

165
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,020
We want to make sure it flows and

166
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,229
matches the email and you're at

167
00:03:40,229 --> 00:03:41,430
least clear with the different

168
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,060
sections.

169
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,449
So, good example there.

170
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,039
And then, probably the most

171
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:46,689
important, as minimal copy as

172
00:03:46,689 --> 00:03:47,460
possible.

173
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,759
So, the customer is only going to

174
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:49,900
be on your email for three-ish

175
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,120
seconds and nobody is going to be

176
00:03:51,229 --> 00:03:52,060
reading an essay.

177
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,449
One, it's going to overwhelm them.

178
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,800
And two, nobody wants to read it.

179
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:57,099
And nobody is going to read it.

180
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,300
So, if you're spending all this

181
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,599
time on your copy, it's just going

182
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:00,669
to be wasted because no one is

183
00:04:00,669 --> 00:04:01,280
reading it.

184
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,840
So, more copy, least overwhelmed.

185
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:03,759
No one will read it.

186
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:04,740
It's wasted space.

187
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:06,280
So, optimized for the three-second

188
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:06,729
viewers.

189
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:07,500
Quick and punchy.

190
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,849
So, let's look at this bad example

191
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:10,080
with just way too much copy.

192
00:04:10,099 --> 00:04:12,469
When you open this email, like, I

193
00:04:12,469 --> 00:04:14,449
can almost guarantee, I can

194
00:04:14,449 --> 00:04:16,660
guarantee, not a single person

195
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:19,160
read every single word of this.

196
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:19,819
Guarantee it.

197
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,550
Everybody is just reading, Gorilla

198
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,069
Bars arrived, 2023, enhanced each

199
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:25,980
bar's flavor, available at Gorilla

200
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:26,560
Mine.

201
00:04:26,579 --> 00:04:26,790
Okay.

202
00:04:26,819 --> 00:04:28,910
That's what the whole process was.

203
00:04:28,939 --> 00:04:30,970
And you have these great icons,

204
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:33,160
this great graph, but you're just

205
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,680
taking up so much space.

206
00:04:34,699 --> 00:04:35,889
Because now the customer has to

207
00:04:35,899 --> 00:04:37,290
scroll, like, three times to even

208
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:38,639
get to the bottom and see this.

209
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,279
It's just way too much, and it's

210
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:41,920
just causing problems and making

211
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:43,500
it hard for the design to flow.

212
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,050
Whereas, this is an awesome

213
00:04:45,149 --> 00:04:45,759
example.

214
00:04:45,779 --> 00:04:47,490
So simple.

215
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,350
Look at how simple this is, and

216
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:51,430
the design makes it where, even if

217
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:53,300
there is a little bit of copy,

218
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:55,129
it's displayed simple, and it's in

219
00:04:55,129 --> 00:04:56,490
just this simple table.

220
00:04:57,019 --> 00:04:59,129
Look at how simple this is, so

221
00:04:59,139 --> 00:05:01,079
little copy, amazing.

222
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:01,759
How will I feel?

223
00:05:01,779 --> 00:05:02,860
Find your perfect dosage.

224
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:03,839
And it's just overcoming an

225
00:05:03,939 --> 00:05:05,149
objection of, like, what's it

226
00:05:05,149 --> 00:05:06,079
going to feel like?

227
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,699
And then this is the blend, the

228
00:05:07,699 --> 00:05:09,350
active parts of it, and then the

229
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:10,040
effects.

230
00:05:10,149 --> 00:05:11,060
Amazing.

231
00:05:11,139 --> 00:05:11,579
Perfect.

232
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,970
Copy and design go together with

233
00:05:13,069 --> 00:05:13,310
email.

234
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:14,639
That's why I included this.

235
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:17,040
So, 100%, this is probably the

236
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,009
most important aspect of making

237
00:05:19,009 --> 00:05:20,399
things skimmable.

238
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,879
But also very important, headlines

239
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:24,199
and main points.

240
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,139
This is necessary.

241
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,529
You can see in this body copy,

242
00:05:26,629 --> 00:05:27,930
there's no headlines or main

243
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:28,519
points.

244
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:29,870
So, this person is just going to

245
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:31,269
scroll through the bottom and not

246
00:05:31,269 --> 00:05:32,319
get anything from it.

247
00:05:32,339 --> 00:05:33,269
Whereas, if you have something

248
00:05:33,269 --> 00:05:34,199
like this, they're going to get

249
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:34,470
these.

250
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,230
So, talking about the headlines

251
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:37,910
and main points, very few people

252
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:39,670
will read your body copy in full,

253
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:41,250
but they will read, skim, all your

254
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,860
headlines and sub-headlines.

255
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:44,250
So, if we only have three seconds

256
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:45,699
of our customer's attention, we

257
00:05:45,699 --> 00:05:46,910
need to make it loud and clear

258
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:48,069
what the main points and the

259
00:05:48,069 --> 00:05:49,000
takeaways are.

260
00:05:49,019 --> 00:05:50,310
So, I've attached two good

261
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:51,250
examples here.

262
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:53,029
You can see here, for this brand,

263
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:54,449
it's just a new standard in

264
00:05:54,449 --> 00:05:55,379
probiotics.

265
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:56,579
And then, you have bolded.

266
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,089
You just know it's clinically

267
00:05:58,089 --> 00:05:58,879
validated.

268
00:05:58,899 --> 00:06:00,529
It's engineered to survive, so

269
00:06:00,529 --> 00:06:01,439
stay with you.

270
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,680
And then, it's superior science.

271
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:04,069
So, you just know, like walking

272
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:05,480
away from this email, you know,

273
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,930
okay, this is like a legit product

274
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:08,199
because of these points.

275
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,699
And if you want to learn more

276
00:06:09,699 --> 00:06:11,420
about them, there's one, two

277
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:12,759
sentences about it.

278
00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:14,910
That's perfect, easy to take away,

279
00:06:15,009 --> 00:06:16,889
little copy, and it's just clear

280
00:06:16,889 --> 00:06:18,459
what the takeaways are.

281
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,100
And then, this right here as well.

282
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,829
You can see, cheers to crunchy

283
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:22,860
beginnings.

284
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:24,170
So, that just kind of like you can

285
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:25,360
feel the crunchy in your mouth

286
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,620
when they said that, so that's a

287
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:27,250
good copy.

288
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:28,790
So, clear headline, you have some

289
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:30,189
body copy, and then you have your

290
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:31,220
sub-headlines here.

291
00:06:31,379 --> 00:06:32,750
So, it's very clear that protein

292
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:34,389
packed, sugar smugger, so there's

293
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:35,860
no sugar, and then it's vegan and

294
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:36,740
gluten free.

295
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:38,250
Like, somebody could skim this and

296
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:39,360
easily get the point.

297
00:06:39,379 --> 00:06:41,129
So, they open the email, cheers to

298
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,000
crunchy, it's protein packed, no

299
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,680
sugar, and then it's vegan.

300
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:45,819
Cool, I'm vegan, and then they

301
00:06:45,819 --> 00:06:46,069
buy.

302
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,139
It's just that simple.

303
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,769
Everything's clear, so you don't

304
00:06:48,769 --> 00:06:50,230
even need to read the body copy,

305
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:51,420
and you get the point of the

306
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:51,959
email.
