1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:01,320
And then the other point, so we

2
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:03,770
have skimmability and then we have

3
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:06,759
the simplicity and then last we

4
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:07,459
have branding.

5
00:00:07,459 --> 00:00:08,859
So I won't go too much in this as

6
00:00:08,859 --> 00:00:10,480
it is pretty self-explanatory.

7
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,279
A design can be

8
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:12,949
really beautiful, but unrelated to

9
00:00:12,949 --> 00:00:13,429
a brand.

10
00:00:13,429 --> 00:00:14,939
And so in order to strengthen your

11
00:00:14,939 --> 00:00:15,720
brand and keep up

12
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:17,579
your positive associations, you

13
00:00:17,579 --> 00:00:18,879
need to make sure that all

14
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:20,129
channels are the same.

15
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:20,750
So this is going

16
00:00:20,829 --> 00:00:21,809
to promote your longer term

17
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:23,269
conversions as you build up these

18
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:24,109
associations.

19
00:00:24,109 --> 00:00:24,899
So make sure your

20
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:26,329
graphics are branded, you have the

21
00:00:26,329 --> 00:00:27,760
correct fonts, you have congruent

22
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,019
styling and the colors are all

23
00:00:29,089 --> 00:00:29,660
the same.

24
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:31,519
And that's going to kind of be it.

25
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:33,079
So just make sure when you're

26
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:34,049
working with a brand,

27
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:35,049
you get all the brand styling

28
00:00:35,049 --> 00:00:36,229
guidelines, looking at the past

29
00:00:36,229 --> 00:00:37,619
emails, you're relating everything

30
00:00:37,619 --> 00:00:37,789
to

31
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:38,289
the site.

32
00:00:38,289 --> 00:00:39,560
And it really is that simple.
