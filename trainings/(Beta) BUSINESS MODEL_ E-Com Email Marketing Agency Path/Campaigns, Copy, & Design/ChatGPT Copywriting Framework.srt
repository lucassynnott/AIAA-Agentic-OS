1
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:03,620
ChatGBT for writing copy, save

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:05,190
yourself the mental bandwidth,

3
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:06,700
save yourself all the effort

4
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:08,470
of writing by using ChatGBT to

5
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:09,439
help you out.

6
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,439
These are the prompts and the tips

7
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:13,089
that I use to write copy and then

8
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:14,439
what all of my team

9
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:14,779
uses.

10
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:16,589
I'd say it's very, very rare for

11
00:00:16,589 --> 00:00:18,280
our team to just like free ball

12
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,600
off the dome to write

13
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:19,940
copy.

14
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,600
A lot of times we're going off of

15
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,149
ChatGBT and using it to like help

16
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:24,600
influence what we're

17
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:25,559
writing and get ideas.

18
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,120
Now AI isn't perfect, obviously.

19
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,559
It's not quite there yet.

20
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:31,929
It's easy to tell if something's

21
00:00:31,929 --> 00:00:34,179
fully written by AI and you just

22
00:00:34,179 --> 00:00:35,810
like copy a prompt and

23
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,170
then throw it in and then just use

24
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:37,640
the copy.

25
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:39,439
I think we can all agree there.

26
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:40,539
It's pretty brutal.

27
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,109
ChatGBT isn't going to give you

28
00:00:42,109 --> 00:00:43,700
the finished product where you

29
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:45,219
just copy and paste and then

30
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:45,750
you're good to go.

31
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,100
But we want to use it as a guide

32
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,159
and we want to use it as a

33
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:48,939
framework.

34
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,619
We want to be picking different

35
00:00:50,619 --> 00:00:51,109
parts.

36
00:00:51,219 --> 00:00:53,109
We want to be asking ChatGBT for

37
00:00:53,109 --> 00:00:55,380
different options and then picking

38
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:56,390
and choosing your

39
00:00:56,659 --> 00:00:56,920
favorites.

40
00:00:56,979 --> 00:00:58,520
It's an iterative process.

41
00:00:58,579 --> 00:01:00,109
Edits, asking ChatGBT to change

42
00:01:00,109 --> 00:01:01,490
things around, all that good

43
00:01:01,539 --> 00:01:02,079
stuff.

44
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:03,609
This framework that I'm giving you

45
00:01:03,609 --> 00:01:05,180
is a really good place to start.

46
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:07,319
So there are two steps.

47
00:01:07,379 --> 00:01:08,849
We need a prime ChatGBT with like

48
00:01:08,849 --> 00:01:09,989
all of our brand info and

49
00:01:09,989 --> 00:01:11,280
everything like that.

50
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,290
And then we have the prompt of the

51
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:15,510
actual, just like write this email

52
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:16,180
for me.

53
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:17,500
So we need to give it all the

54
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,060
information and you can create

55
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:20,569
custom ChatGBTs of like saving

56
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:21,459
different chats.

57
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:23,500
So you can have a chat saved where

58
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,620
you give all the information from

59
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:26,620
your brand.

60
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,900
But this is what I use.

61
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:29,500
I give it all the information.

62
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,409
This is from me taking things out,

63
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:32,930
putting new things in that I

64
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:34,560
noticed like through using

65
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:35,719
this thousands of times.

66
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:37,370
But I just say I'm going to give

67
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:38,640
you all this stuff.

68
00:01:38,689 --> 00:01:39,890
I want you to process it so you

69
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:41,329
can later write email marketing

70
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:41,849
copy for me.

71
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:43,930
My e-commerce brand is this, we

72
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:45,379
sell this, here's our website,

73
00:01:45,379 --> 00:01:46,469
yada, yada, yada.

74
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:47,879
Our mission and goal is to do

75
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:48,299
this.

76
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:49,519
So you're telling it what to

77
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:51,049
optimize for, what's important for

78
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:51,420
us.

79
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,620
Our brand is unique.

80
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,840
So you're giving it why we stand

81
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,959
out from competitors.

82
00:01:55,019 --> 00:01:56,629
Our products are unique, again,

83
00:01:56,629 --> 00:01:57,909
differentiating you from

84
00:01:57,909 --> 00:01:59,129
competitors again.

85
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,939
And then we move to the customer.

86
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,329
My ideal customer is this with

87
00:02:02,329 --> 00:02:03,379
this demographic.

88
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:04,769
They enjoy this, yada, yada, yada,

89
00:02:04,769 --> 00:02:05,140
yada.

90
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,200
Then you talk about brand voice.

91
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:09,310
And then goals and aspirations of

92
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:10,038
the customer.

93
00:02:10,099 --> 00:02:11,449
And then why the customers are

94
00:02:11,539 --> 00:02:12,909
unique, such as like they're

95
00:02:12,909 --> 00:02:14,430
gluten free or something like

96
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:14,719
that.

97
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:15,789
And then you just say, are you

98
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:16,629
ready to write copy?

99
00:02:16,699 --> 00:02:18,259
So here's like an example.

100
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,599
This is for Gymshark.

101
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:21,740
I did this for Gymshark.

102
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,120
And I'm going through a full

103
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,680
example in this doc with you and

104
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,430
showing you the finished product.

105
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,610
So I'm giving you this.

106
00:02:28,699 --> 00:02:29,400
We're called Gymshark.

107
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:30,610
We sell high quality gym apparel

108
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:31,860
meant for working out and also for

109
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:32,610
leisurely wearing.

110
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:33,599
It's also important.

111
00:02:33,659 --> 00:02:35,340
Our mission and goal is, I just

112
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,120
took this from the website.

113
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:38,319
Our legacy was built in the weight

114
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:38,659
room.

115
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:39,919
Found it in love for training.

116
00:02:39,979 --> 00:02:41,189
The passion continues into all our

117
00:02:41,189 --> 00:02:42,430
gym clothes today, yada, yada,

118
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:42,840
yada.

119
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,520
We're unique because of this.

120
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:46,840
Really talking about the

121
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,490
technology and the quality.

122
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,560
Can't talk right now.

123
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:52,659
These are our ideal customers,

124
00:02:52,659 --> 00:02:54,219
yada, yada, yada.

125
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,729
For brand voice, this is what they

126
00:02:55,729 --> 00:02:56,129
want.

127
00:02:56,199 --> 00:02:57,099
These are their goals and

128
00:02:57,229 --> 00:02:58,159
aspirations, yada.

129
00:02:58,219 --> 00:02:59,689
They're unique because the gym is

130
00:02:59,689 --> 00:03:00,479
a way of life.

131
00:03:00,539 --> 00:03:02,289
So JackCBT is understanding that

132
00:03:02,289 --> 00:03:04,139
these customers really care about

133
00:03:04,349 --> 00:03:05,169
the gym, okay?

134
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:07,000
And then the actual prompt for the

135
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,240
campaign, the email that you're

136
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:08,729
writing.

137
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:10,770
So this is what I always like to

138
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:12,870
say for making things clear and

139
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:14,740
concise and following all

140
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,419
of our principles and not because

141
00:03:16,419 --> 00:03:17,960
sometimes JackCBT will show you

142
00:03:18,189 --> 00:03:19,300
like a text-based email.

143
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,379
It's like 300 words.

144
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:21,680
I found out that this is the best

145
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,550
way to overcome it.

146
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:23,819
You say, I'm creating a

147
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:25,550
graphic-based email campaign with

148
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:26,360
minimal copy.

149
00:03:26,509 --> 00:03:27,840
I've tried tons of different

150
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,409
variations, longer and shorter

151
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:30,120
than that.

152
00:03:30,259 --> 00:03:31,319
This is kind of like the happy

153
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:31,780
medium.

154
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,949
So we're creating graphic-based

155
00:03:32,949 --> 00:03:33,340
email.

156
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,189
This is the topic.

157
00:03:34,259 --> 00:03:35,159
So give us some background.

158
00:03:35,259 --> 00:03:36,610
Using the information on the brand

159
00:03:36,699 --> 00:03:37,960
of the customer, I want you to

160
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,560
write a quick and punchy headline.

161
00:03:40,099 --> 00:03:41,080
Then I want you to write a

162
00:03:41,129 --> 00:03:42,599
slightly longer sub-headline,

163
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:43,699
which goes into two to three

164
00:03:43,949 --> 00:03:45,509
sentences of body copy leading to

165
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:46,680
a shop now call to action.

166
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:47,919
Boom.

167
00:03:47,979 --> 00:03:48,879
Perfect.

168
00:03:48,939 --> 00:03:50,139
That is what we want.

169
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:51,680
So this is an example for

170
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,599
Gymshark.

171
00:03:52,659 --> 00:03:54,509
Graphic-based email, minimal copy.

172
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:55,639
The topic is about our

173
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:56,560
bestsellers.

174
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,360
It's a bestsellers email and how

175
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,770
they are the MVP for you in the

176
00:04:00,009 --> 00:04:00,199
gym.

177
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,289
They're going to make you feel

178
00:04:02,289 --> 00:04:03,289
comfortable and break your

179
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:04,340
personal records using the

180
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,039
information, yada, yada, yada.

181
00:04:06,099 --> 00:04:08,729
This is what the process was like.

182
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,300
After I gave ChatGPT that prompt

183
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,509
and those campaigns or that

184
00:04:13,509 --> 00:04:16,279
information, here's what it spit

185
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:17,000
out.

186
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,730
You get the headline and then you

187
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:19,670
get body copy.

188
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:21,720
Meet your MVPs, Gymshark's

189
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,899
bestsellers.

190
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,410
That could easily be a headline.

191
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,040
Crush your goals, set new personal

192
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,579

193
00:04:27,579 --> 00:04:28,970
design for peak performance,

194
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:30,699
ultimate, yada, yada, yada.

196
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:32,819
Gear up, push your limits, and see

197
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:33,439
the difference.

198
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,129
And then it seemed a bit basic for

199
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:35,500
me.

200
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,000
So I was like, can you make it a

201
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,019
bit more unique?

202
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:39,779
Unleash your potential.

Love it.

208
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,079
Starts with a benefit.

These bestsellers combine

cutting-edge innovation and

213
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:51,740
comfort.

214
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,699
Amazing.

215
00:04:52,779 --> 00:04:54,129
Ready to transform your training.

216
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:55,100
That's a really good copy.

217
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,529
So I just said, can you make the

218
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:57,970
headline more conversational

219
00:04:57,970 --> 00:04:59,120
rather than unleash your

220
00:04:59,120 --> 00:04:59,829
potential?

221
00:05:00,339 --> 00:05:02,019
So ready to meet your gym MVPs.

222
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,430
That is also a banger.

223
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:04,699
Let's see what I did.

224
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:06,040
Give me more options for

225
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:06,860
headlines.

226
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,519
So then it gave me like eight.

227
00:05:08,579 --> 00:05:10,879
So it said, yada, yada, yada.

228
00:05:10,939 --> 00:05:12,439
And so I landed with, your new

229
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:13,579
go-tos for PR day.

230
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:14,519
PR day.

231
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,430
So gym-goers would understand PR

232
00:05:16,459 --> 00:05:16,860
day.

233
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,180
It's your personal record day.

234
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,579
So I explained that.

235
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:20,759
And then I said, amazing.

236
00:05:20,819 --> 00:05:23,500
Give me body copy for that.

237
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,379
And then it said, smash your

238
00:05:24,579 --> 00:05:25,459
personal records, yada, yada,

239
00:05:25,459 --> 00:05:25,839
yada.

240
00:05:25,899 --> 00:05:27,500
And then I said, give me options

241
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,660
for sub-headline.

242
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,350
Because at that point, this body

243
00:05:30,379 --> 00:05:31,459
copy is good to go.

244
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:33,149
The headline is, your new go-tos

245
00:05:33,149 --> 00:05:33,879
for PR day.

246
00:05:33,939 --> 00:05:35,060
Body copy is going to be smash

247
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:36,389
your personal records with gear

248
00:05:36,389 --> 00:05:37,759

249
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,269
every move.

Our best sellers provide the

251
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:41,189

innovation, making PR day your

00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:43,920

limits.

255
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:45,629
Amazing.

256
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,860
And then I was like, okay, I kind

257
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:47,779
of want a sub-headline.

258
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:48,550
Give me options.

259
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:49,519
And then boom.

260
00:05:49,579 --> 00:05:50,930
I have a ton of options here,

261
00:05:51,019 --> 00:05:52,420
which I can implement.

262
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,589
And then here's what this finished

263
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:56,079
product looks like.

264
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:57,240
This is where I put the

265
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,029
sub-headline over product images

266
00:05:59,029 --> 00:06:00,970
because I need a product section.

267
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,769
So this is what ChatGPT gave me

268
00:06:02,769 --> 00:06:04,639
from the iterative process.

269
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,639
Your new go-tos for PR day.

270
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,379
Banger.

your every move.

00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,360

00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,839
innovation, making PR day your

00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:16,360

280
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,310
And then to tie the products, this

281
00:06:19,339 --> 00:06:20,560
is the sub-headline.

282
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:22,379
PR day dominance awaits.

283
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,000
And then we just copy information

284
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,389
from their website for product

285
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:27,000
images because we're doing a best

286
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,720
sellers email.

287
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,769
Banger.

288
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:30,920
Banger.

289
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,540
ChatGPT helps me with this whole

290
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:33,079
thing.

291
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,040
I didn't just take the first

292
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:34,439
option.

293
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:35,980
Imagine if I took the first option

294
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:37,379
where it was just meet your MVPs,

295
00:06:37,379 --> 00:06:38,879
Gymshark bestsellers, crush your

296
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:39,810
goals, and set new personal

297
00:06:40,189 --> 00:06:41,769
records with our top-selling gear.

298
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:42,680
That's basic.

299
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:43,800
That's not Gymshark.

300
00:06:44,139 --> 00:06:45,759
Instead of meet your MVPs, crush

301
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,560
your goals, these bestsellers are

302
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,310
your ultimate gym companions.

303
00:06:49,379 --> 00:06:50,189
No.

304
00:06:50,259 --> 00:06:51,720
We're saying your new go-tos for

305
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,279
PR day.

306
00:06:52,339 --> 00:06:53,350
Smash your personal records with

307
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:54,370

308
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:55,050
your every move.

00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,139
Much more powerful.

310
00:06:56,199 --> 00:06:57,259
Much more punchy.

311
00:06:57,319 --> 00:06:58,300
We're going back and forth with

312
00:06:58,339 --> 00:06:58,779
Gymshark.

313
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:00,040
Choosing what we're like and

314
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,410
taking what we like and getting

315
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:02,709
rid of what we don't like.

316
00:07:02,779 --> 00:07:04,480
So, that is how you use ChatGPT.

317
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:06,129
That's the process and the prompts

318
00:07:06,129 --> 00:07:06,860
that we use.

319
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:10,069
ChatGPT for writing copy.

320
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:11,410
Save yourself the mental

321
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:12,199
bandwidth.

322
00:07:12,259 --> 00:07:13,939
Save yourself all the effort of

323
00:07:13,939 --> 00:07:15,730
writing by using ChatGPT to help

324
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:16,410
you out.

325
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,350
These are the prompts and the tips

326
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:20,079
that I use to write copy and then

327
00:07:20,329 --> 00:07:21,649
what all of my team uses.

328
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,410
I'd say it's very, very rare for

329
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:25,209
our team to just, like, free ball

330
00:07:25,209 --> 00:07:26,920
off the dome to write copy.

331
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:28,329
A lot of times we're going off of

332
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,889
ChatGPT and using it to, like,

333
00:07:29,889 --> 00:07:31,569
help influence what we're writing

334
00:07:31,569 --> 00:07:32,560
and get ideas.

335
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:35,120
Now, AI isn't perfect, obviously.

336
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,529
It's not quite there yet.

337
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,649
It's easy to tell if something's

338
00:07:38,649 --> 00:07:40,790
fully written by AI and you just,

339
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:43,040
like, copy a prompt and then throw

340
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,670
it in and then just use the copy.

341
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:46,439
I think we can all agree there.

342
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,519
It's pretty brutal.

343
00:07:47,579 --> 00:07:48,930
ChatGPT isn't going to give you

344
00:07:49,019 --> 00:07:50,410
the finished product where you

345
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:51,680
just copy and paste and then

346
00:07:51,689 --> 00:07:52,740
you're good to go.

347
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,089
But we want to use it as a guide

348
00:07:54,089 --> 00:07:55,149
and we want to use it as a

349
00:07:55,149 --> 00:07:55,939
framework.

350
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,620
We want to be picking different

351
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:58,110
parts.

352
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:59,850
We want to be asking ChatGPT for

353
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:01,819
different options and then picking

354
00:08:02,069 --> 00:08:03,939
and choosing your favorites.

355
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,500
It's an iterative process.

356
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,079
Edits, asking ChatGPT to change

357
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:08,470
things around, all that good

358
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:09,060
stuff.

359
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,589
This framework that I'm giving you

360
00:08:10,589 --> 00:08:12,160
is a really good place to start.

361
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:14,300
So there are two steps.

362
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,639
We need a prime ChatGPT with,

363
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:17,040
like, all of our brand info and

364
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,259
everything like that.

365
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,220
And then we have the prompt of the

366
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,899
actual just, like, write this

367
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:23,180
email for me.

368
00:08:23,339 --> 00:08:24,379
So we need to give it all the

369
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:25,079
information.

370
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:26,610
And you can create custom ChatGPTs

371
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:28,300
of, like, saving different chats.

372
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,379
You can have a chat saved where

373
00:08:30,379 --> 00:08:32,559
you give all the information from

374
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,620
your brand.

375
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,879
But this is what I use.

376
00:08:34,929 --> 00:08:36,480
I give it all the information.

377
00:08:36,538 --> 00:08:38,220
This is from me taking things out,

378
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,600
putting new things in that I

379
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,460
noticed, like, through using this

380
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:42,700
thousands of times.

381
00:08:43,059 --> 00:08:44,409
But I just say I'm going to give

382
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,639
you all this stuff.

383
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:46,889
I want you to process it so you

384
00:08:46,889 --> 00:08:48,309
can later write email marketing

385
00:08:48,309 --> 00:08:48,860
copy for me.

386
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,919
My e-commerce brand is this.

387
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:51,690
We sell this.

388
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:52,759
Here's our website.

389
00:08:52,789 --> 00:08:53,460
Yada, yada, yada.

390
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:54,860
Our mission and goal is to do

391
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:55,279
this.

392
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:56,500
So you're telling it what to

393
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,029
optimize for, what's important for

394
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:58,399
us.

395
00:08:58,460 --> 00:08:59,600
Our brand is unique.

396
00:08:59,659 --> 00:09:00,820
So you're giving it why we stand

397
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:01,940
out from competitors.

398
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,769
Our products are unique.

399
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,159
Again, differentiating you from

400
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:06,120
competitors again.

401
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:07,870
And then we move to the customer.

402
00:09:08,019 --> 00:09:09,370
My ideal customer is this.

403
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,830
With this demographic, they enjoy

404
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:11,240
this.

405
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:12,120
Yada, yada, yada, yada.

406
00:09:12,179 --> 00:09:14,179
Then you talk about brand voice.

407
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,009
And then goals and aspirations of

408
00:09:16,059 --> 00:09:17,019
the customer.

409
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,350
And then why the customers are

410
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:19,860
unique, such as, like, they're

411
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,230
gluten-free or something like

412
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:21,679
that.

413
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:22,750
And then you just say, are you

414
00:09:22,769 --> 00:09:23,620
ready to write copy?

415
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:25,240
So here's, like, an example.

416
00:09:25,299 --> 00:09:27,580
This is for Gymshark.

417
00:09:27,629 --> 00:09:28,740
I did this for Gymshark.

418
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:30,039
And I'm going through a full

419
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:31,509
example in this doc with you and

420
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,419
showing you the finished product.

421
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,590
So I'm giving you this.

422
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:36,389
We're called Gymshark.

423
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:37,659
We sell high-quality gym apparel

424
00:09:37,659 --> 00:09:38,879
meant for working out and also for

425
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:39,679
leisurely wearing.

426
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:40,580
It's also important.

427
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:42,269
Our mission and goal is I just

428
00:09:42,269 --> 00:09:44,100
took this from the website.

429
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:45,309
Our legacy was built in the weight

430
00:09:45,309 --> 00:09:45,659
room.

431
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,919
Founded in love for training.

432
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,289
The passion continues into all our

433
00:09:48,289 --> 00:09:49,090
gym clothes today.

434
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:49,820
Yada, yada, yada.

435
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:52,500
We're unique because of this.

436
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:53,820
Really talking about the

437
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,470
technology and the quality.

438
00:09:55,559 --> 00:09:57,559
I can't talk right now.

439
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:00,080
These are our ideal customers.

440
00:10:00,129 --> 00:10:01,200
Yada, yada, yada.

441
00:10:01,259 --> 00:10:02,710
For brand voice, this is what they

442
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:03,139
want.

443
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:03,899
These are their goals and

444
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:04,440
aspirations.

445
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,139
Yada.

446
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:06,889
They're unique because the gym is

447
00:10:06,889 --> 00:10:07,480
a way of life.

448
00:10:07,539 --> 00:10:09,159
So ChatGPT is understanding that

449
00:10:09,159 --> 00:10:10,690
these customers really care about

450
00:10:10,929 --> 00:10:11,460
the gym.

451
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:12,159
Okay?

452
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,570
And then the actual prompt for the

453
00:10:13,659 --> 00:10:15,129
campaign, the email that you're

454
00:10:15,129 --> 00:10:15,740
writing.

455
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:17,700
So this is what I always like to

456
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,750
say for making things clear and

457
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,960
concise and following all of our

458
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,360
principles.

459
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,539
Because sometimes ChatGPT will

460
00:10:24,539 --> 00:10:25,870
show you like a text-based email

461
00:10:25,909 --> 00:10:27,370
and it's like 300 words.

462
00:10:27,429 --> 00:10:28,679
I found out that this is the best

463
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:29,549
way to overcome it.

464
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:30,769
You say, I'm creating a

465
00:10:30,769 --> 00:10:32,509
graphic-based email campaign with

466
00:10:32,509 --> 00:10:33,279
minimal copy.

467
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,830
I've tried tons of different

468
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:36,389
variations, longer and shorter

469
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:37,100
than that.

470
00:10:37,259 --> 00:10:38,320
This is kind of like the happy

471
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:38,779
medium.

472
00:10:39,019 --> 00:10:40,320
So creating graphic-based email.

473
00:10:40,379 --> 00:10:41,169
This is the topic.

474
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,259
So give us some background.

475
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,629
Using the information on the brand

476
00:10:43,629 --> 00:10:44,919
and the customer, I want you to

477
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:46,539
write a quick and punchy headline.

478
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,659
Then I want you to write a

479
00:10:47,659 --> 00:10:49,240
slightly longer sub-headline,

480
00:10:49,269 --> 00:10:50,549
which goes into two to three

481
00:10:50,549 --> 00:10:52,250
sentences of body copy leading to

482
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,659
a shop now call to action.

483
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,899
Boom.

484
00:10:55,539 --> 00:10:55,840
Perfect.

485
00:10:55,899 --> 00:10:57,120
That is what we want.

486
00:10:57,179 --> 00:10:58,659
So this is an example for

487
00:10:58,659 --> 00:10:59,580
Gymshark.

488
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:01,519
Graphic-based email, minimal copy.

489
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:02,620
The topic is about our

490
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,539
bestsellers.

491
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,340
It's a bestsellers email and how

492
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,750
they are the MVP for you in the

493
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:07,179
gym.

494
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:08,710
They're going to make you feel

495
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:09,860
comfortable and break your

496
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:10,679
personal records.

497
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,590
Using the information, yada, yada,

498
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:12,970
yada.

499
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,710
This is what the process was like.

500
00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:18,279
After I gave ChatGPT that prompt

501
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:20,490
and those campaigns or that

502
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:23,259
information, here's what it spit

503
00:11:23,259 --> 00:11:23,960
out.

504
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:25,860
You get the headline and then you

505
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:26,679
get body copy.

506
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:28,720
Meet your MVPs, Gymshark's

507
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,899
bestsellers.

508
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:31,389
That could easily be a headline.

509
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,019
Crush your goals, set new personal

510
00:11:33,019 --> 00:11:34,559
records with a top-selling gear,

511
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:35,950
design for peak performance,

512
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:37,679
ultimate, yada, yada, yada.

513
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,009
Gym companions, gear up, push your

514
00:11:39,009 --> 00:11:40,419
limits, and see the difference.

515
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,110
And then it seemed a bit basic for

516
00:11:42,139 --> 00:11:42,500
me.

517
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:44,000
So I was like, can you make it a

518
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
bit more unique?

519
00:11:45,059 --> 00:11:47,100
Unleash your potential, Gymshark's

520
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,100
bestsellers.

521
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:49,919
Elevate your top pit, elevate your

522
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,600
workout with our top picks.

523
00:11:51,659 --> 00:11:52,100
Love it.

524
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:53,059
Starts with a benefit.

525
00:11:53,259 --> 00:11:54,580
Crafted to be your unique,

526
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:55,840
ultimate gym allies.

527
00:11:55,899 --> 00:11:56,659
These bestsellers combine

528
00:11:56,919 --> 00:11:58,230
cutting-edge and innovation and

529
00:11:58,230 --> 00:11:58,759
comfort.

530
00:11:58,820 --> 00:11:59,720
Amazing.

531
00:11:59,779 --> 00:12:01,110
Ready to transform your training.

532
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:02,080
That's a really good copy.

533
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:03,509
So I just said, can you make the

534
00:12:03,529 --> 00:12:04,950
headline more conversational

535
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:06,100
rather than unleash your

536
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:06,809
potential?

537
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:09,000
So ready to meet your gym MVPs.

538
00:12:09,059 --> 00:12:10,409
That is also a banger.

539
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,679
Let's see what I did.

540
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:13,019
Give me more options for

541
00:12:13,019 --> 00:12:13,840
headlines.

542
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,450
So then it gave me like eight.

543
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:17,860
So it said, yada, yada, yada.

544
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:19,389
And so I landed with your new

545
00:12:19,389 --> 00:12:20,549
go-tos for PR day.

546
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:21,500
PR day.

547
00:12:21,559 --> 00:12:23,399
So gym goers would understand PR

548
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:23,860
day.

549
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:25,179
It's your personal record day.

550
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,580
So I explained that.

551
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:27,759
And then I said, amazing.

552
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:30,500
Give me body copy for that.

553
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:31,379
And then it said, smash your

554
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:32,450
personal records, yada, yada,

555
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:32,820
yada.

556
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:34,480
And then I said, give me options

557
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,639
for sub-headline.

558
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,370
Because at that point, this body

559
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:38,460
copy is good to go.

560
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:40,149
The headline is, your new go-tos

561
00:12:40,149 --> 00:12:40,879
for PR day.

562
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:42,059
Body copy is going to be smash

563
00:12:42,059 --> 00:12:43,389
your personal records with gear

564
00:12:43,389 --> 00:12:44,759
that's designed to support your

565
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:45,269
every move.

566
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,500
Our bestsellers provide the

567
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,700
perfect blend of comfort and

568
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,399
innovation.

569
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:50,080
Making PR day your best day.

570
00:12:50,139 --> 00:12:51,639
Ready to redefine your limits.

571
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:52,460
Amazing.

572
00:12:52,779 --> 00:12:53,840
And then I was like, okay, I kind

573
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,759
of want a sub-headline.

574
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:55,529
Give me options.

575
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,500

577
00:12:58,019 --> 00:12:59,399

579
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:03,139
product looks like.

580
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,289

581
00:13:04,289 --> 00:13:06,360
sub-headline over product images.

582
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,980

583
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:09,769

thing.

608
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,019
I didn't just take the first

00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:44,539
