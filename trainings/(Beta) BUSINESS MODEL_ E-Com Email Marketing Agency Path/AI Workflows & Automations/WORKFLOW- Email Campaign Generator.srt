1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:01,800
What's up guys, Lucas here, and

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:02,879
this one will be showing you

3
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:05,169
our e-com email campaign generator

4
00:00:05,259 --> 00:00:05,730
agent.

5
00:00:06,049 --> 00:00:06,780
This one is pretty

6
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:08,599
straightforward, but pretty cool.

7
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,039
So essentially what this does is

8
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:11,039
like a lot of the others,

9
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:12,839
it's a form submission workflow.

10
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:14,740
So we have a form and on that

11
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,210
form, all you have to submit is

12
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:17,120
the brand name,

13
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:18,879
the brand website, industry and

14
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,280
niche, choose their existing

15
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:20,760
client.

16
00:00:20,809 --> 00:00:22,199
You can add some personalization

17
00:00:22,469 --> 00:00:22,640
notes.

18
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:24,160
You also could put some details

19
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:25,570
here about any specific campaigns

20
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:26,079
that you want

21
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:28,179
to create, you know, say civic

22
00:00:28,179 --> 00:00:29,800
data or product launch coming up.

23
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:32,689
And then choose from a dropdown,

24
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:34,280
the campaign types you want to

25
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:34,679
make.

26
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:36,039
Uh, there's multiple you can

27
00:00:36,039 --> 00:00:37,159
select from on there.

28
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,880
Uh, if I scroll down here, you can

29
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,009
see a few, as you can see, it's a

30
00:00:40,119 --> 00:00:40,520
lot here.

31
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,039
So choose the ones that you want.

32
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:44,170
They're a checkbox and then we are

33
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:44,969
good to go.

34
00:00:45,219 --> 00:00:46,939
After that, we have our brand

35
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,600
research agent, um, that goes and

36
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,200
researches

37
00:00:50,429 --> 00:00:51,490
everything about the brand reason

38
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:52,079
perplexity.

39
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:53,039
Make sure you got perplexity set

40
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:53,270
up.

41
00:00:53,429 --> 00:00:54,439
Make sure you get open writer set

42
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,119
up, make sure you got Google drive

43
00:00:56,119 --> 00:00:56,520
set up.

44
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,799
I make sure you got slack set up.

45
00:00:57,850 --> 00:00:58,479
Those are all the ones we're

46
00:00:58,530 --> 00:00:58,799
using.

47
00:00:59,369 --> 00:01:01,460
Uh, then we have a campaign idea

48
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:02,119
agent.

49
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,560
And this actually creates the

50
00:01:03,829 --> 00:01:05,439
ideas for your campaigns.

51
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,180
So, uh, it takes the information

52
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:08,670
you put into it, uh, next to

53
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:09,959
research and then create some

54
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:11,409
really, really nice campaigns.

55
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:13,000
And then we write five of them

56
00:01:13,269 --> 00:01:14,930
that we actually have a different,

57
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:16,599
uh, AI agent writing each

58
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,599
of the campaigns to make sure

59
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:18,859
they're as detailed as possible.

60
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,400
And then at the end, we aggregate

61
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,560
all this information together.

62
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:25,819
Google docs, send your Google, uh,

63
00:01:25,939 --> 00:01:27,840
docs OAuth to set up for MD2 docs

64
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:29,260
creates a nice Google

65
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:30,120
document for us.

66
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:31,500
And then as usual, we run through

67
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:32,840
the, are they using client?

68
00:01:33,049 --> 00:01:33,200
Yes.

69
00:01:33,489 --> 00:01:34,469
Then searches for the existing

70
00:01:34,549 --> 00:01:36,680
folder, moves the folder and sends

71
00:01:36,939 --> 00:01:38,640
you a slack notification.

72
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:40,989
Now the campaigns themselves or

73
00:01:40,989 --> 00:01:42,450
the document actually looks like

74
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:43,560
it gives you the subject

75
00:01:43,739 --> 00:01:44,989
line, the preview text, the

76
00:01:44,989 --> 00:01:46,760
headline, the body copy, uh, goes

77
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,439
into full detail on the campaign.

78
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,760
It gives you the CTA, uh, goes

79
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,040
through the whole thing.

80
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:53,219
So it is super in-depth it, uh,

81
00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:55,180
does a very, very good job of

82
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:57,480
writing, uh, the full campaigns

83
00:01:57,689 --> 00:01:58,879
seven pages worth of campaigns in

84
00:01:58,879 --> 00:01:59,280
here.

85
00:01:59,489 --> 00:02:02,030
And, uh, it is, uh, everything you

86
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:04,519
need to automatically create new

87
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:05,069
campaigns for your

88
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,450
clients on autopilot, uh, super

89
00:02:07,459 --> 00:02:09,819
easy to, to, to run again, all you

90
00:02:09,819 --> 00:02:11,520
need is that input form.

91
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,680
Uh, make sure you've got your

92
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:13,909
perplexity API key in there and

93
00:02:13,909 --> 00:02:14,800
make sure you get your open

94
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,879
writers set up and make sure that

95
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:18,800
you have your Google drive and

96
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,590
your Google docs or MD2 doc set

97
00:02:20,669 --> 00:02:20,879
up.

98
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:22,370
Uh, again, all this is doing is

99
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,689
taking the information,

100
00:02:23,689 --> 00:02:25,280
researching the brand, uh,

101
00:02:25,509 --> 00:02:27,150
creating campaign ideas, sending

102
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:28,580
those ideas to our campaign

103
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:29,199
writer.

104
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:30,469
This code node just spits out the

105
00:02:30,469 --> 00:02:31,680
different campaign ideas.

106
00:02:31,849 --> 00:02:32,840
And then we take all the

107
00:02:32,909 --> 00:02:34,909
information, put it all together,

108
00:02:34,909 --> 00:02:36,560
prepare the document data,

109
00:02:36,789 --> 00:02:38,810
create the document to MD2 docs,

110
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:40,250
and then send you a slack

111
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:41,520
notification.

112
00:02:41,669 --> 00:02:42,860
Just saying, Hey, new campaigns

113
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:43,360
created.

114
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,039
We're all done.

115
00:02:44,129 --> 00:02:46,560
Uh, you know, uh, the client, the

116
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,800
status document, each campaign

117
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,319
strategy created the

118
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:51,120
campaign focus.

119
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,680
Um, and then the strategy

120
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,879
highlights.

121
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:56,319
Now in the ages themselves, these

122
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:57,939
are actually built very, very

123
00:02:57,939 --> 00:02:59,039
heavily on max.

124
00:02:59,219 --> 00:03:03,039
Um, uh, campaign, uh, methodology.

125
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,370
Uh, you can see here actually in

126
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:05,599
the, in this one, up here we go.

127
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:06,939
Uh, we're actually saying create

128
00:03:06,939 --> 00:03:08,240
five high converting emails.

129
00:03:08,449 --> 00:03:10,270
Using max has proven, uh, 40

130
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:11,599
million methodology.

131
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:14,360
Um, and then, uh, same for our

132
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,680
system message.

133
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:17,120
Uh, we sell it the micro topic

134
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,039
mastery education positioning.

135
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:20,099
We go through all the different

136
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:21,120
things it's got to include.

137
00:03:21,169 --> 00:03:23,580
So, uh, this goes super in depth,

138
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:24,810
uh, make sure that, you know,

139
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:25,759
everything that is being,

140
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:28,319
um, out, uh, output by max here

141
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:29,919
is, uh, everything's output is

142
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:30,960
based on max's training.

143
00:03:31,129 --> 00:03:32,949
And, uh, you know, guarantees that

144
00:03:32,949 --> 00:03:34,750
you are getting really, really

145
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:35,680
solid campaigns.

146
00:03:35,719 --> 00:03:37,069
Uh, I use an existing brand that I

147
00:03:37,069 --> 00:03:38,080
knew about for this.

148
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,349
So we were able to get actual real

149
00:03:39,349 --> 00:03:40,639
information or real brand.

150
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,960
Um, obviously put in the brand

151
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,120
that you're working with.

152
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:44,409
If you give it the, the, the brand

153
00:03:44,409 --> 00:03:45,919
website, it helps a lot.

154
00:03:46,099 --> 00:03:47,250
And, uh, again, any

155
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,930
personalization notes, you just

156
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:50,199
put it in the presentation, those

157
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:50,960
box.

158
00:03:51,009 --> 00:03:52,400
And, uh, you'll get some kind of

159
00:03:52,669 --> 00:03:53,810
extra context and it'd be, you

160
00:03:53,909 --> 00:03:54,000
know,

161
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,000
kind of tailored a bit more to

162
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,229
whatever kind of information that

163
00:03:56,229 --> 00:03:56,800
you give it.

164
00:03:56,849 --> 00:03:58,240
So that's how this works.

165
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,639
Uh, super straightforward.

166
00:03:59,889 --> 00:04:01,500
Again, all you need to do is get

167
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,800
the, uh, production URL here and

168
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,800
then set your flow live.

169
00:04:07,009 --> 00:04:09,199
And you will be good to go.

170
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:10,490
All you gotta do is input the

171
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:11,900
information form and you're

172
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:12,479
flying.

173
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,639
So this is great for, you've got

174
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:14,740
a, if you're running an e-commerce

175
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:14,879
agency,

176
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:15,840
you've got some campaign managers

177
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,120
that we were doing, you know, uh,

178
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:17,839
more in detail things,

179
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:19,120
handling clients, stuff like that.

180
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,170
Now they can actually just write

181
00:04:20,189 --> 00:04:21,600
campaigns pretty much on autopilot

182
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,160
as well.

183
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:23,439
And you're good to go.

184
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,560
So I'll be helpful.

185
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:25,720
And I will see you in the next

186
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:26,009
one.

187
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:26,800
Peace.
