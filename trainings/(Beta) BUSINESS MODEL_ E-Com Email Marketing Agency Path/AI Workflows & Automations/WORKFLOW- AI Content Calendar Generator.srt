1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,439
What's up guys, Lucas here, and

2
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:02,200
this one I'm going to be showing

3
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:03,720
you our content calendar

4
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:04,240
generator.

5
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:05,839
This is for creating your content

6
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:07,120
calendar for an e-com email

7
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,240
marketing agency.

8
00:00:08,589 --> 00:00:10,269
Again, like a lot of other forms,

9
00:00:10,269 --> 00:00:12,070
it's a calendar input form.

10
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:13,599
For this, you will need to have

11
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,380
set up your Perplexity API key,

12
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:17,160
your OpenRouter API key,

13
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:19,649
your Google Sheets, and your

14
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,039
Google Drive and Slack.

15
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:23,260
We've been over had to do all

16
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:24,440
these in other videos.

17
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:25,940
Check them out if you are not

18
00:00:26,019 --> 00:00:27,850
sure, but it's very simple.

19
00:00:28,219 --> 00:00:30,230
For most of these, it is simply

20
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:32,179
just inputting an API key.

21
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,670
And then for Google Sheets, you

22
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:37,460
will do the usual Google Sheets.

23
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,799
So just log in with Google and

24
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:39,859
you're good to go.

25
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:42,219
So the way this works is there is

26
00:00:42,219 --> 00:00:44,149
a campaign request form.

27
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:45,679
You can put brand details below to

28
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:46,869
generate a comprehensive email

29
00:00:46,979 --> 00:00:47,859
content calendar.

30
00:00:47,899 --> 00:00:48,869
So you need to put in the brand

31
00:00:48,869 --> 00:00:49,969
name, the brand website, the

32
00:00:49,969 --> 00:00:50,729
industry and niche,

33
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,210
are they existing clients, any

34
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:53,630
personalization notes you might

35
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:54,060
have.

36
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:55,969
For instance, any specific product

37
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,780
launch date or anything like that.

38
00:00:58,119 --> 00:01:00,570
Upcoming key dates and that's it.

39
00:01:00,679 --> 00:01:03,070
So once you do that, then our AI

40
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:05,200
agent immediately generates a

41
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:06,670
fully detailed content calendar

42
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,140
for you.

43
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:08,439
Our code nodes here are just

44
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:09,980
formatting data for us and parsing

45
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:11,260
the data that's output.

46
00:01:11,299 --> 00:01:12,920
We then create a spreadsheet.

47
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:14,359
We create a sheet inside that

48
00:01:14,359 --> 00:01:16,060
spreadsheet called calendar.

49
00:01:16,099 --> 00:01:17,349
And we create another sheet called

50
00:01:17,349 --> 00:01:17,819
summary.

51
00:01:17,859 --> 00:01:19,439
Then we prepare the data for this

52
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:20,700
by splitting the rows, just

53
00:01:20,859 --> 00:01:21,650
preparing the data here.

54
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:23,420
And then we populate the data onto

55
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,079
the sheet.

56
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,549
Then we aggregate those results

57
00:01:25,549 --> 00:01:26,400
back together.

58
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:27,859
We check, are they a returning

59
00:01:27,859 --> 00:01:28,420
client?

60
00:01:28,459 --> 00:01:29,870
If they are, then we search for an

61
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:31,290
existing folder and move the sheet

62
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,250
to that folder.

63
00:01:32,299 --> 00:01:33,579
If not, we create the folder and

64
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:34,680
move it to that folder.

65
00:01:35,239 --> 00:01:37,120
Then finally, we send a nice Slack

66
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,250
notification saying, hey, it's all

67
00:01:39,549 --> 00:01:39,760
done.

68
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:41,200
Here's a link to the calendar

69
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:41,939
ready to go.

70
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:43,420
And what the calendar looks like

71
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:43,959
is this.

72
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,280
So as I said, there's two sheets,

73
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:46,340
calendar and summary.

74
00:01:46,819 --> 00:01:48,260
The calendar one obviously has all

75
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:48,980
the details.

76
00:01:49,019 --> 00:01:50,230
There's the date, day of week,

77
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:51,640
campaign type, the subject line,

78
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,079
the preview text, primary goal,

79
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:55,010
content theme, key message, CTA,

80
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:57,250
segment priority, notes, and the

81
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:57,920
brand.

82
00:01:57,959 --> 00:01:59,519
You can see it's super, super

83
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:00,280
detailed.

84
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:04,219
So this handles that for you.

85
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:06,379
And then the next thing we have is

86
00:02:06,379 --> 00:02:08,379
the summary that goes over the

87
00:02:08,379 --> 00:02:10,699
campaign mix, the total number of

88
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:12,050
emails, the key dates

89
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:14,039
incorporated, the strategic notes,

90
00:02:14,129 --> 00:02:15,680
and when it was generated.

91
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:17,389
So this generates a full content

92
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:19,030
calendar for you, ready to go.

93
00:02:19,409 --> 00:02:21,460
Very, very easy to use.

94
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:23,379
Again, when you're ready to go

95
00:02:23,469 --> 00:02:25,550
live with this, you will simply

96
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:27,490
get your production URL from up

97
00:02:27,659 --> 00:02:29,620
here, and then you will set it to

98
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:31,900
live, and you are ready to go.

99
00:02:31,939 --> 00:02:34,000
So that is how this works.

100
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:35,469
Very simple, as you can see, and

101
00:02:35,469 --> 00:02:36,879
very useful because, you know,

102
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:38,199
planning out these campaign

103
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:39,960
calendars can be very, very hard.

104
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:41,800
This makes it very easy for you to

105
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,319
get it set up in seconds versus,

106
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:44,830
you know, planning out over the

107
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:46,680
course of, you know, a few hours,

108
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,659
having to do, even having to

109
00:02:47,659 --> 00:02:48,919
create, like, custom graphics for

110
00:02:49,009 --> 00:02:49,599
it or whatever.

111
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:50,729
Now you've just got a spreadsheet

112
00:02:50,729 --> 00:02:51,900
where it's got everything in there

113
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:52,469
ready to go.

114
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,099
So I hope this is helpful.

115
00:02:54,139 --> 00:02:55,409
Any problems, feel free to hit me

116
00:02:55,409 --> 00:02:56,590
up, and I will see you in the next

117
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:56,979
one.

118
00:02:57,389 --> 00:02:57,680
Peace.
