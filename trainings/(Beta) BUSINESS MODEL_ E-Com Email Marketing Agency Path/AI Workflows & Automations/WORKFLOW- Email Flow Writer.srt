1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,260
What's up guys, Lucas here.

2
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:02,859
So this is actually one of my

3
00:00:03,009 --> 00:00:04,190
favorite flows that I've made

4
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,629
simply because this is one that I

5
00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:06,960
know is highly requested.

6
00:00:07,059 --> 00:00:08,099
We have a lot of e-com email

7
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:09,519
marketing guys inside Client

8
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:09,880
Ascension

9
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:11,369
and one of the things I regularly

10
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:13,199
get is questions about copywriting

11
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:13,960
and how do they replace

12
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:14,419
copywriters

13
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:16,660
and how do they write their email

14
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:18,300
flows and stuff with AI

15
00:00:18,379 --> 00:00:20,489
and now this automation does all

16
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,679
of that for them completely, 100%.

17
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:25,480
So let's take a look at how this

18
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:26,089
works.

19
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:26,899
As usual, let's start off by

20
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:27,839
saying what you need to have set

21
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:28,059
up.

22
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,210
You need to have your open writer

23
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:29,489
set up.

24
00:00:29,719 --> 00:00:30,960
You need perplexity for a research

25
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:31,649
set up.

26
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:33,670
You will need your Google Docs

27
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,520
OAuth 2 for your MD2 Docs,

28
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:38,990
Google Drive, and Slack.

29
00:00:39,369 --> 00:00:40,950
Aside from that, we are good to

30
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:41,359
go.

31
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:42,969
So the way this works is it is a

32
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:43,549
form.

33
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,789
The form asks for the brand name.

34
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,140
This is of course about the brand

35
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:49,159
you're creating e-com emails for.

36
00:00:49,259 --> 00:00:51,020
So the brand name, their website,

37
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:52,380
the industry niche they're in,

38
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:53,409
are they an existing client,

39
00:00:53,539 --> 00:00:54,750
and any personalization notes you

40
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,090
might have about them you want to

41
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:56,340
add.

42
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:59,450
Then our brand research agent is

43
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:01,399
used perplexity to do detailed

44
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:02,649
research on the brand.

45
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:03,969
As you can see, it comes out with

46
00:01:03,979 --> 00:01:05,239
a very detailed thing on this

47
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:05,590
brand.

48
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:07,120
This is a brand that I used to

49
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:08,519
work with a long time ago,

50
00:01:08,599 --> 00:01:09,530
so I already kind of knew a bit

51
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:09,950
about them.

52
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:11,359
I could verify that everything you

53
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:12,120
got was correct.

54
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,409
After that, we take that

55
00:01:14,409 --> 00:01:16,030
information and we write seven

56
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:16,620
flows.

57
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:17,870
The welcome flow, the cart

58
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:19,549
abandon, the checkout abandon, the

59
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:20,420
browse abandon,

60
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:22,280
the post-purchase, site abandon,

61
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,340
and the win back flow.

62
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,299
And these are all super detailed

63
00:01:26,299 --> 00:01:29,170
based on Max Durdvant's writings

64
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:31,000
and his training.

65
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,430
And it creates the full sequence

66
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:34,489
for each of these.

67
00:01:34,739 --> 00:01:36,569
Then the MD2 Docs creates Google

68
00:01:36,569 --> 00:01:37,900
Docs for all of them.

69
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:39,250
Then we have some code nodes

70
00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:41,290
running here that essentially are

71
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:42,000
an aggregate node

72
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:43,340
that essentially are putting all

73
00:01:43,379 --> 00:01:44,930
of these Google Doc IDs together.

74
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,459
Then we check and see if they are

75
00:01:47,459 --> 00:01:49,920
an existing customer or not.

76
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:51,469
So on the form, if you say that

77
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:54,599
they are, then they'll go to the

78
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:55,939
true branch,

79
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:58,859
which will search for their client

80
00:01:59,069 --> 00:02:01,700
folder inside of your client's

81
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:02,359
folder,

82
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:03,390
as well as always need a Google

83
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:04,609
Drive folder named clients.

84
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,769
And if they're not, it'll create a

85
00:02:06,769 --> 00:02:08,038
folder for them.

86
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,038
Then we've got some more

87
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:10,590
processing with the code nodes to

88
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:12,300
do with the IDs and the documents.

89
00:02:12,669 --> 00:02:15,210
Then we're moving the files from

90
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:18,030
the seven files we created to the

91
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:18,919
correct folder

92
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:20,319
before finally sending a very

93
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:22,280
nicely formatted Slack message

94
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:24,219
that says, hey, new client setup

95
00:02:24,219 --> 00:02:24,939
is complete

96
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:27,180
and includes a link to their

97
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,240
client folder, which will look

98
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:29,680
like this.

99
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:30,909
That will be named whatever you

100
00:02:30,909 --> 00:02:31,849
put the brand name at the

101
00:02:31,849 --> 00:02:32,599
beginning of the form

102
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,979
along with all the different

103
00:02:34,979 --> 00:02:35,699
flows.

104
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,050
So if we have a look, these are

105
00:02:37,139 --> 00:02:38,479
what the flows look like.

106
00:02:38,569 --> 00:02:39,490
So as you can see, it gives the

107
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:40,979
subject line options, preview

108
00:02:41,009 --> 00:02:42,240
text, email layout,

109
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:45,879
gives all the copy, email too.

110
00:02:45,949 --> 00:02:46,800
It goes all the way through.

111
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:47,830
Same for all of these.

112
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:49,389
These are card abandoned, six to

113
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,210
eight email sequence, the checkout

114
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:52,099
abandoned flow,

115
00:02:52,189 --> 00:02:53,840
the post-purchase flow, the win

116
00:02:53,889 --> 00:02:55,669
back flow, the site abandoned

117
00:02:55,669 --> 00:02:58,659
flow, and the browse abandonment

118
00:02:58,659 --> 00:02:58,979
flow.

119
00:02:59,069 --> 00:03:00,169
As you can see, they're all very

120
00:03:00,169 --> 00:03:00,740
detailed.

121
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,069
It goes through the full breakdown

122
00:03:02,259 --> 00:03:03,379
of what you should do.

123
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:04,659
You can give some notes on things

124
00:03:04,659 --> 00:03:05,629
like the Clavio setup and

125
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:06,300
personalization

126
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,990
and things like that, depending on

127
00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:08,870
what the flow is.

128
00:03:09,419 --> 00:03:11,139
So this is super detailed.

129
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,449
This is something that the

130
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:13,930
e-commerce email guys and site

131
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:14,530
client essentially have been

132
00:03:14,539 --> 00:03:16,319
asking for for quite a long time.

133
00:03:16,419 --> 00:03:18,509
To get this set up, again, all you

134
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:20,580
need to do is make sure that you

135
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,860
modify anything you need to modify

136
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:23,659
here.

137
00:03:23,729 --> 00:03:24,580
It really should be nothing.

138
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:25,610
It's just setting up really your

139
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:26,960
different account details, such as

140
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,379
your open router, your perplexity,

141
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,490
getting your Google OAuth for the

142
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:33,409
MD2 docs, and the Google Drive and

143
00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:34,780
Slack setup.

144
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:37,620
Once that is done, then you are

145
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:38,819
good to go.

146
00:03:38,939 --> 00:03:41,610
You simply just turn it to active

147
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:44,400
and then get your production URL

148
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,840
for the form.

149
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:47,389
Anytime you have a new client, you

150
00:03:47,389 --> 00:03:48,659
just input the information into

151
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:49,060
the form,

152
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:50,370
and you will, within a few

153
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,219
minutes, have all of their flows

154
00:03:52,219 --> 00:03:53,879
written, ready to go in Google

155
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:54,900
Drive for you.

156
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,330
Now, you don't have to hire a flow

157
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:57,310
copywriter.

158
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:58,280
You are good to go.

159
00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:00,169
So, next we're working on is going

160
00:04:00,169 --> 00:04:01,860
to be campaign ideas and things

161
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:02,580
like that.

162
00:04:02,729 --> 00:04:03,840
So you can, again, put out any

163
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,050
copywriter whatsoever and have

164
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:06,259
everything handled by AI.

165
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,990
But this is going to get you 90%

166
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:09,439
of the way there for one of the

167
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,150
most important parts of becoming a

168
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:11,900
marketing,

169
00:04:12,009 --> 00:04:13,229
which is the flow creation and

170
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:13,819
setup.

171
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:16,350
After this, you've got to design

172
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:18,120
the emails and put the copy and

173
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,250
you're sorted.

174
00:04:19,379 --> 00:04:22,519
So, hopefully, this was helpful

175
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:25,050
and I will see you in the next

176
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:25,819
one.

177
00:04:26,189 --> 00:04:26,560
Peace.
