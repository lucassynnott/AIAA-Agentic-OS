1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:05,250
What's up guys lucas here this is

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:06,309
probably one of my favorite

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:07,559
automations that we've done

4
00:00:07,599 --> 00:00:09,640
uh this is an ai product photo

5
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:12,089
shoot generator and uh essentially

6
00:00:12,339 --> 00:00:14,220
i think i should show you guys

7
00:00:14,259 --> 00:00:15,519
the the results before anything

8
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:16,859
else because they turn out really

9
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:19,980
cool but uh these are entirely

10
00:00:20,019 --> 00:00:22,219
ai generated using google's nano

11
00:00:22,219 --> 00:00:24,379
banana uh image generator which

12
00:00:24,379 --> 00:00:26,059
released only recently

13
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,359
and does an absolutely phenomenal

14
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:30,170
job of following uh product

15
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:32,149
dimensions and uh copying things

16
00:00:32,149 --> 00:00:32,280
from

17
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,460
one image to another look at the

18
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:36,799
detail on that absolutely insane

19
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:38,500
uh you see logos and everything

20
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:41,070
are all perfect text all perfect

21
00:00:41,109 --> 00:00:43,450
uh super super nice uh this is

22
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:45,979
absolutely perfect if you are

23
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:47,310
creating uh product photo shoots

24
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:48,950
or you need them for email designs

25
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:51,020
anything like that so the way

26
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,369
this works it looks complicated

27
00:00:52,539 --> 00:00:54,070
but it's pretty simple uh there's

28
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:55,479
actually i'll start off with

29
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,810
saying the two things we're going

30
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,310
to need to set up you will need to

31
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:00,719
get an api from imagebb.com

32
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:04,379
now just type in imgbb.com and uh

33
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:07,909
once you are in imagebb and you're

34
00:01:07,909 --> 00:01:10,620
signed up you are going to

35
00:01:10,659 --> 00:01:11,670
i'm going to my website to show

36
00:01:11,769 --> 00:01:12,680
you guys you're going to go to

37
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:13,890
about and you're going to click

38
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:14,540
api

39
00:01:14,579 --> 00:01:16,719
here you'll get your api key

40
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:19,069
simply take that api key and you

41
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:22,000
are going to double click this one

42
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,129
here

43
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:24,370
this is the upload original image

44
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:26,299
to imagebb one and where it says

45
00:01:26,299 --> 00:01:28,060
key paste in your key here

46
00:01:28,099 --> 00:01:30,060
and that's it and then the other

47
00:01:30,069 --> 00:01:32,140
one you're going to need is going

48
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:35,540
to be file ai so go to file.ai

49
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:37,159

i'm going to choose my account

53
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:44,629
continue

54
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:50,510
and when you're in file to ai

55
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:51,719
again i'm just going to go back to

56
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,799
the main home page so you see

57
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:53,060
exactly

58
00:01:53,099 --> 00:01:54,480

think api is available from

62
00:02:01,129 --> 00:02:02,879
beginning so api keys and add key

63
00:02:03,019 --> 00:02:04,439
and once you have that there's

64
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,019

new header auth so you're going to

69
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,520
do uh header auth create new

00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,800
it that's what you're going to do

74
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,150
do it for that do the same then

75
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:30,009
once that's created you'll uh

76
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:32,039
select obviously header auth as

77
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:34,080

80
00:02:39,069 --> 00:02:39,599
auth file

81
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:41,000
ai and get file image uh we're

82
00:02:41,189 --> 00:02:42,979
going to set that to actually you

83
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,840
don't need that at all that's fine

84
00:02:44,979 --> 00:02:46,939
you just leave get so it's just

85
00:02:46,949 --> 00:02:49,020
for uh these three create image

86
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:50,830
get status and get url image

87
00:02:50,939 --> 00:02:51,000
you're

88
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:53,229
going to set file ai you also need

89
00:02:53,229 --> 00:02:55,210
to set up uh your google drive

90
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:57,919
your slack uh perplexity uh open

91
00:02:57,979 --> 00:02:59,289
router and we actually will need

92
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:00,870
an open ai key for the analyze

93
00:03:00,909 --> 00:03:02,219
image uh to do that you're just

94
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:02,469
going

95
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,469
to go to uh i think it's

96
00:03:04,469 --> 00:03:07,289
platform.openai or openai uh yeah

97
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,919
platform.openai.com slash settings

98
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:14,139
uh log in obviously let's log in

99
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:16,419
continue with google

100
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:22,860
then once you're logged in you're

101
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:28,870
just going to go down to api keys

102
00:03:28,939 --> 00:03:33,919
and you're going to create a new

103
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:37,080
key and copy and paste it then

104
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:40,780
into uh your account settings

105
00:03:40,939 --> 00:03:42,310
under open ai account api keys

106
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:44,349
paste it in there and then you're

107
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:46,139
good to go so the way this works

108
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,509
you have a form as usual you'll

109
00:03:48,509 --> 00:03:50,539
put in a brand name the brand

110
00:03:50,569 --> 00:03:52,900
website the brand niche the photo

111
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:53,180
shoot

112
00:03:53,259 --> 00:03:55,210
goals any additional context are

113
00:03:55,229 --> 00:03:57,219
they existing client yes or no and

114
00:03:57,219 --> 00:03:59,460
you will upload a product photo

115
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:00,020
pngs

116
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,419
are preferable so upload a product

117
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:04,780
photo um then what this will do is

118
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,949
it will immediately upload the

119
00:04:06,979 --> 00:04:07,219
image

120
00:04:07,259 --> 00:04:08,699
image to image bb and it will send

121
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:10,689
it to open ai to analyze the image

122
00:04:10,729 --> 00:04:11,750
and say what's in it

123
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:13,120
then we have a photo shoot

124
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,330
research agent that does detailed

125
00:04:15,449 --> 00:04:17,019
research on conducting a photo

126
00:04:17,139 --> 00:04:17,459
shoot and

127
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,810
comes up with five different

128
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:20,860
scenes for the photo shoot after

129
00:04:21,129 --> 00:04:23,220
creating our five scenes we split

130
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:23,540
those

131
00:04:23,579 --> 00:04:25,939
out and then we send it to a loop

132
00:04:26,029 --> 00:04:28,550
and the loop basically creates

133
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:30,259
those five scenes so it sends

134
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,000
it to file ai to generate the

135
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,439
image it waits 60 seconds then it

136
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:36,740
gets the status if it's completed

137
00:04:36,779 --> 00:04:38,620
then we get the url of the uh

138
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,759
image if not then we wait in our

139
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:43,300
60 seconds and we get the file

140
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,009
image

141
00:04:44,139 --> 00:04:45,550
and then we upload the file to

142
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:47,379
google drive uh it'll loop over

143
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,970
these so they're done we'll have

144
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:49,220
five

145
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:50,779
files it'll upload the files to

146
00:04:50,779 --> 00:04:52,279
google drive aggregate those

147
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:53,750
together then we'll check if

148
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:54,420
they're a returning

149
00:04:54,459 --> 00:04:56,610
client client and if they uh are

150
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:58,709
not in this case it'll create a

151
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,310
client folder and then we will

152
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:00,730
loop

153
00:05:00,779 --> 00:05:02,829
over moving the files uh the five

154
00:05:02,829 --> 00:05:05,019
different files into that folder

155
00:05:05,019 --> 00:05:07,220
and then send a notification same

156
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:08,430
deal if they are existing client

157
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:09,620
we just loop over moving the files

158
00:05:09,689 --> 00:05:10,740
into the folder then send you a

159
00:05:10,779 --> 00:05:12,199
notification and as i showed you

160
00:05:12,329 --> 00:05:13,980
this is the sort of result you're

161
00:05:14,129 --> 00:05:16,339
going to get uh looks really

162
00:05:16,339 --> 00:05:16,639
really

163
00:05:16,699 --> 00:05:17,949
good um i think this is my

164
00:05:17,949 --> 00:05:19,290
favorite one just having

165
00:05:19,629 --> 00:05:21,189
incredibly detailed and uh like

166
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,060
close up that is

167
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,709
and uh yeah absolutely perfect so

168
00:05:24,709 --> 00:05:26,329
this is everything you would need

169
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:28,019
then to create everything from ads

170
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:30,250
to uh really really good um email

171
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,410
designs uh you know throughout

172
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:34,500
your uh your email campaigns

173
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,610
so that is how that works again to

174
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:38,740
get this live all you're going to

175
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:40,100
do is you're going to click the

176
00:05:40,939 --> 00:05:43,910
active button up here and then you

177
00:05:43,949 --> 00:05:46,699
will get your uh production url

178
00:05:46,699 --> 00:05:49,139
here input the form and you will

179
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,470
automatically end up with a slack

180
00:05:50,689 --> 00:05:52,149
notification with a link to the

181
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,670
files in your google drive folder

182
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:54,660
so

183
00:05:54,699 --> 00:05:55,959
that's how that works a really

184
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:57,079
cool one probably one of my

185
00:05:57,129 --> 00:05:59,060
favorite one so far um hope this

186
00:05:59,060 --> 00:05:59,189
is helpful

187
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,040
and i will see you in the next one

188
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:02,579
