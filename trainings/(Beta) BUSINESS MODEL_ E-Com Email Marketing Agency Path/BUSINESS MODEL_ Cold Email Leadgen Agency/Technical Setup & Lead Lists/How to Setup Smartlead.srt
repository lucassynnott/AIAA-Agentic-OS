1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:01,080
All right, in this video, I'm

2
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:02,779
going to cover how you can set up

3
00:00:02,779 --> 00:00:04,480
a cold email campaign inside of

4
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:05,129
Smartlead.

5
00:00:05,129 --> 00:00:06,830
It is really not that complicated.

6
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:08,070
It does not take that long.

7
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,210
It just requires you to

8
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:10,060
press a few buttons.

9
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:11,250
So first off, we're going to hop

10
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:12,449
into Smartlead, go to the email

11
00:00:12,449 --> 00:00:12,939
campaign

12
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,580
section and press create campaign.

13
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:15,859
Now you're going to be prompted

14
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:16,929
here to import leads.

15
00:00:16,929 --> 00:00:17,109
So

16
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:18,519
you can drag these in from

17
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:20,370
wherever you are dragging them in

18
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:20,829
from.

19
00:00:20,829 --> 00:00:22,000
This is a list I made

20
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:23,199
for my boy Evan Siege here in

21
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:24,140
Client Ascension.

22
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:24,920
Shout out Evan.

23
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:26,390
So I'm just going to upload this

24
00:00:26,449 --> 00:00:27,059
as an example.

25
00:00:27,059 --> 00:00:28,129
Now it's going to ask you for

26
00:00:28,129 --> 00:00:29,609
settings here, import leads, even

27
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:30,160
if they're

28
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:32,320
in the general or in the global

29
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,359
block list.

30
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:35,869
I like to respect that, not import

31
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:36,659
the leads

32
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:37,740
if they're in the block list, not

33
00:00:37,859 --> 00:00:39,049
import the leads if they're in the

34
00:00:39,049 --> 00:00:40,000
unsubscribed list.

35
00:00:40,049 --> 00:00:41,750
I do like to ignore this because

36
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,700
Smartlead's global bounce list is

37
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:45,039
not super accurate in

38
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:45,909
our experience.

39
00:00:45,909 --> 00:00:47,380
And then ignore leads that exist

40
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:48,350
in other campaign.

41
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:49,270
That's up to you.

42
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:49,859
I only

43
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:51,299
enable this if you have leads in

44
00:00:51,299 --> 00:00:52,780
other campaigns you want to filter

45
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:53,240
out.

46
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,270
This depends on your

47
00:00:54,579 --> 00:00:55,619
exact circumstance.

48
00:00:55,619 --> 00:00:57,200
You could leave this off or on

49
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,920
depending if you want to import

50
00:00:58,920 --> 00:00:59,179
leads

51
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:00,469
exists in other campaigns to

52
00:01:00,469 --> 00:01:00,939
yours.

53
00:01:00,939 --> 00:01:02,490
The next step you're going to do

54
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:03,429
here, you can name

55
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:04,519
the campaign however you'd like.

56
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:05,859
I like to name it, you know,

57
00:01:05,859 --> 00:01:07,219
whatever campaign this is.

58
00:01:07,219 --> 00:01:07,340
So

59
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:09,010
let's say Hormozy followers and

60
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:10,780
then 12, 15, 24.

61
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:12,239
So like what the date is.

62
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,060
Now here's where

63
00:01:14,109 --> 00:01:15,019
you're going to map the fields.

64
00:01:15,019 --> 00:01:15,859
You're going to add your first

65
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:16,799
name, your email, all the

66
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:16,980
different

67
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:17,599
fields.

68
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:19,150
Typically you're going to have

69
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:20,840
first name, last name, company

70
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,659
name, email, any custom

71
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:24,659
variable, custom variables.

72
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:26,439
You'll have a company name and

73
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:28,409
LinkedIn profile and a few others

74
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:28,900
website.

75
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:30,010
So this is where you're going to

76
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:30,349
map it.

77
00:01:30,349 --> 00:01:31,620
You're just going to want to tell

78
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:32,000
Smartlead

79
00:01:32,049 --> 00:01:33,250
like, Hey, in the Google sheet, it

80
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:33,890
says first name.

81
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:34,920
We're going to map this to first

82
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:35,359
name.

83
00:01:35,409 --> 00:01:36,439
Same thing with email and all the

84
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,799
other stuff you want to pull in.

85
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:39,299
Now, if I want to include

86
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:40,939
their follower count as a custom

87
00:01:40,939 --> 00:01:42,689
field, I can just press the custom

88
00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:43,849
field button here and

89
00:01:43,909 --> 00:01:44,700
then import that.

90
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,359
So we're going to, I'm going to

91
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,359
make sure the settings are set up

92
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:48,680
properly.

93
00:01:48,829 --> 00:01:50,519
So I'm just going to upload this

94
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:51,280
as a sample.

95
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,010
This takes anywhere from a few

96
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:54,000
seconds to a few

97
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:55,390
minutes, depending on how big your

98
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:55,799
list is.

99
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:56,920
So you're going to let this upload

100
00:01:57,099 --> 00:01:57,840
and wait a couple

101
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,780
seconds here for this to load.

102
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:01,629
While this is loading, you're

103
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,379
going to want to make sure that

104
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:04,829
you have your email script already

105
00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:06,079
set up and all the other assets

106
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:06,540
ready.

107
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,000
Now you can see here,

108
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:09,400
this is all the stuff that

109
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,729
Smartlead uploaded.

110
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:12,389
So you can see, here's all the

111
00:02:12,389 --> 00:02:13,020
stuff.

112
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:13,620
I don't like

113
00:02:13,669 --> 00:02:14,909
to validate inside Smartlead.

114
00:02:14,909 --> 00:02:16,120
I like to validate externally.

115
00:02:16,259 --> 00:02:17,759
And so we're going to continue and

116
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:18,240
upload.

117
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,870
Now, now that we're in the

118
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:21,969
sequences section here, here's

119
00:02:21,979 --> 00:02:23,699
where you can write the email.

120
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:25,129
You're going to put your subject

121
00:02:25,129 --> 00:02:26,539
line, all your different email

122
00:02:26,539 --> 00:02:27,110
contents.

123
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:28,199
Writing this is pretty

124
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:28,919
straightforward.

125
00:02:29,009 --> 00:02:29,939
So you're just going to insert

126
00:02:29,939 --> 00:02:31,030
what you put as a subject line.

127
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:32,080
If you want variables,

128
00:02:32,129 --> 00:02:33,159
like the stuff in your sheets, all

129
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,120
you have to do is press this

130
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:34,810
variable button.

131
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:35,560
So I could say like,

132
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:36,810
hi, first name.

133
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:38,479
This is obviously not a good

134
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:39,340
script.

135
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:40,680
Hi, first name.

136
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,090
Sometimes it does that like

137
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:43,680
undefined thing if you press

138
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:44,250
enter.

139
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:45,789
So just keep that in mind.

140
00:02:45,789 --> 00:02:47,000
Hi, first name.

141
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,860
I want you to book

142
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:50,909
a call.

143
00:02:50,909 --> 00:02:51,479
Okay.

144
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:53,590
That's how you type stuff in.

145
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,789
If you want to make split tests,

146
00:02:55,789 --> 00:02:57,120
this is where you add

147
00:02:57,419 --> 00:02:57,569
variant.

148
00:02:57,569 --> 00:02:58,800
You can have your split tests.

149
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,990
If you want to add extra steps to

150
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:00,860
the campaign, like

151
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:01,930
other emails.

152
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:04,139
Let me move this loom thing here.

153
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,990
You just press add step, add

154
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:07,780
email, and then plug in

155
00:03:07,849 --> 00:03:09,030
your next email here and you can

156
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:09,599
keep going.

157
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:10,979
You can keep adding split tests

158
00:03:10,979 --> 00:03:12,080
and do all that

159
00:03:12,379 --> 00:03:12,770
stuff here.

160
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:14,379
This video is not on copywriting,

161
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,840
but this is where you paste your

162
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,330
copy.

163
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:17,479
If you want to add

164
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:19,050
images, links, which in 99% of the

165
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,520
scenarios, I don't recommend it.

166
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,120
You can do that here as well.

167
00:03:22,169 --> 00:03:23,569
Now, moving on, we're just going

168
00:03:23,569 --> 00:03:24,620
to press save it next and go

169
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,020
through this very quickly.

170
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:27,319
That's where

171
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:28,150
you write your sequences.

172
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:29,229
Again, pretty straightforward.

173
00:03:29,229 --> 00:03:30,240
You're just copying and pasting

174
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:30,719
your stuff into

175
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:31,069
here.

176
00:03:31,069 --> 00:03:32,430
And then if you want variables,

177
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:33,759
you can insert those through the

178
00:03:33,819 --> 00:03:34,780
variable button.

179
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:36,669
Now, moving on to the setup.

180
00:03:36,669 --> 00:03:38,180
Oh, one last thing I'll cover here

181
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:38,960
is Spintax.

182
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,490
So Spintax is a good

183
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:41,210
thing to have.

184
00:03:41,219 --> 00:03:42,689
Generally, Spintax is basically

185
00:03:42,729 --> 00:03:44,030
like randomization of stuff in

186
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:44,729
your email.

187
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:45,009
So

188
00:03:45,069 --> 00:03:46,659
if you want your email to say hi

189
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:48,430
in half the cases and hello in the

190
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:49,900
other half the cases like

191
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:52,169
this, all you have to do is make a

192
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:54,629
curly open embrace, put whatever

193
00:03:54,659 --> 00:03:56,669
you want one randomization

194
00:03:56,729 --> 00:03:58,409
to be, put a line, put your other

195
00:03:58,409 --> 00:04:00,219
randomization, and then close it

196
00:04:00,219 --> 00:04:00,699
out.

197
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:02,219
So if you want half the

198
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,900
emails to say A and half the

199
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,719
emails to say B, if you set up

200
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:07,740
this Spintax, it will show us

201
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:07,860
that.

202
00:04:07,909 --> 00:04:09,379
So the reason why you do this is

203
00:04:09,379 --> 00:04:10,990
because you want your emails to

204
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:12,590
appear not as like copy and paste

205
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:13,610
templates and have some

206
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:14,400
randomization.

207
00:04:14,469 --> 00:04:15,780
So in this case, you know, half

208
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:16,920
our emails will say hi,

209
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:18,269
half our emails will say hello,

210
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:19,170
and this is useful for

211
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:20,459
deliverability reasons.

212
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:21,459
Now, if you're trying

213
00:04:21,509 --> 00:04:22,879
to like split test something to

214
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:24,240
see which result will perform

215
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,699
better, that's where you're going

216
00:04:25,769 --> 00:04:27,089
to want to use the A/B split

217
00:04:27,089 --> 00:04:28,180
testing feature.

218
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,870
If you want to just include micro

219
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:31,139
variations in your

220
00:04:31,379 --> 00:04:32,000
email to help improve

221
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,290
deliverability, this is where

222
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:34,319
you're going to want to use

223
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:34,930
Spintax.

224
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:35,350
You can say,

225
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:37,240
hey, instead of I want you to book

226
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,949
a call, I want you to schedule a

227
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,149
meeting, right?

228
00:04:40,149 --> 00:04:40,879
And it's not

229
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:41,600
half our emails.

230
00:04:41,689 --> 00:04:42,810
It'll say, I want you to book a

231
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:43,139
call.

232
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:44,310
And the other half, it'll say

233
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:44,949
schedule a

234
00:04:45,259 --> 00:04:45,470
meeting.

235
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,939
So that's how you set up Spintax.

236
00:04:46,939 --> 00:04:48,069
Spintax is basically just

237
00:04:48,069 --> 00:04:49,339
randomization your email,

238
00:04:49,579 --> 00:04:51,500
and it helps improve results for

239
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,860
deliverability.

240
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:55,240
So that's how you set up Spintax.

241
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:55,639
That's how you

242
00:04:55,689 --> 00:04:56,490
set up your emails.

243
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:57,680
Now moving on to the next step,

244
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:58,560
the setup section.

245
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,139
Choose sender accounts.

246
00:05:00,139 --> 00:05:00,370
This is

247
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:01,389
where you can add the emails that

248
00:05:01,389 --> 00:05:02,319
you want to be associated with

249
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:02,879
this campaign.

250
00:05:03,019 --> 00:05:04,120
I like to just add

251
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,870
all the emails that are relevant,

252
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:07,259
you know, included in this

253
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:07,910
campaign.

254
00:05:07,949 --> 00:05:09,540
Some people like to chop them up

255
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:10,920
into separate campaigns, but

256
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,370
smartly, smart enough to know to

257
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:13,790
like respect your daily sending

258
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,360
limits and

259
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:15,439
not over send on those email

260
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,019
accounts.

261
00:05:16,019 --> 00:05:17,209
I just add them all in here.

262
00:05:17,209 --> 00:05:19,060
Schedule campaign, pick your time

263
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,139
zone, pick the days you want to

264
00:05:20,259 --> 00:05:20,509
send.

265
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,560
You can send on weekends if you

266
00:05:21,699 --> 00:05:21,949
want.

267
00:05:21,949 --> 00:05:23,290
I know people that crush that do

268
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:23,750
that.

269
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,420
For your time of day that you're

270
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:27,269
sending, again, this depends on

271
00:05:27,269 --> 00:05:28,610
your time zone and who you're

272
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,459
sending to.

273
00:05:29,459 --> 00:05:31,350
But I like to send from like seven

274
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:33,350
in the morning to like 2 p.m.

275
00:05:33,379 --> 00:05:34,519
ish because I'd rather

276
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:35,740
send earlier and they see it

277
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,019
during their workday than send

278
00:05:37,149 --> 00:05:38,319
close to when most people's

279
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:39,120
workday is up.

280
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:41,120
An email will be sent every X

281
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,040
minutes.

282
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,930
I like to make sure that this just

283
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:45,620
adds up to whatever your

284
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,939
email sending limit is.

285
00:05:46,939 --> 00:05:48,860
So if you're sending 15 emails per

286
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:50,420
account per day, you want this

287
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:50,879
number

288
00:05:50,949 --> 00:05:52,699
to be 15 or greater, which it is

289
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:53,399
by default.

290
00:05:53,529 --> 00:05:54,930
But if you want it to be, you

291
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:56,149
know, exactly the same

292
00:05:56,269 --> 00:05:57,300
as what you have it for your email

293
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:58,629
accounts, you can keep playing

294
00:05:58,629 --> 00:05:59,939
with the numbers until it's like

295
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:00,339
that.

296
00:06:00,339 --> 00:06:01,879
As long as this is above what your

297
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:03,430
email sending limits are, then

298
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:04,259
that's fine.

299
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:05,360
Email

300
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:06,319
account start date.

301
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:07,329
If you want to schedule a

302
00:06:07,329 --> 00:06:08,889
campaign, you can do this 99% of

303
00:06:08,889 --> 00:06:09,480
the time.

304
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:09,980
I don't do

305
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:10,360
that.

306
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,709
For the max number of new leads

307
00:06:11,709 --> 00:06:12,480
reached per day.

308
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:14,319
Again, this doesn't really matter

309
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:14,600
because

310
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,029
smartly to smart enough to know to

311
00:06:16,029 --> 00:06:17,290
say like, hey, if your email

312
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:18,879
account, if you have 10 email

313
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,459
accounts sending 50 emails per

314
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:22,470
day, 1515, that means you're going

315
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,899
to send 150 emails a day.

316
00:06:23,949 --> 00:06:25,660
Now, if I put anything higher than

317
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:27,699
150, smart leads are not going to

318
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:28,980
go over that because you

319
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:30,430
have email account limits.

320
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,899
So it doesn't matter as long as

321
00:06:32,019 --> 00:06:33,529
it's above the number that your

322
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:33,939
email

323
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,740
account, like your amount of email

324
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:37,500
accounts times the amount sent per

325
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,649
day of the email account.

326
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:38,899
So

327
00:06:38,949 --> 00:06:40,310
you can just set this to a really

328
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:41,019
high number.

329
00:06:41,019 --> 00:06:42,149
I like to set this to like a

330
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,449
thousand or whatever

331
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,220
higher number you could possibly

332
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:46,899
think of because your smart lead

333
00:06:46,899 --> 00:06:48,560
account will respect your email

334
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:49,579
account sending limits.

335
00:06:49,579 --> 00:06:50,879
By the way, I know I'm breezing

336
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:52,180
through this really quickly.

337
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:53,920
Um, there, if you want to rewatch

338
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,660
this video, I'd recommend it just

339
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:57,079
to solidify the settings,

340
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:58,430
but this is to mainly be a quick

341
00:06:58,430 --> 00:06:59,129
start guide.

342
00:06:59,129 --> 00:07:00,430
And again, you can DM me if you

343
00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:01,420
have any questions,

344
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:02,819
time zone, pick your time zone,

345
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:04,240
pretty straightforward, press

346
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:04,660
save.

347
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,019
So I'm going to put New York here,

348
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:07,470
New York.

349
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:08,920
Awesome.

350
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,240
Cause I want EST.

351
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,189
Cool.

352
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,579
So now that's set up, um, schedule

353
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:18,300
campaign center

354
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,000
settings.

355
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:21,000
We have that all set up campaign

356
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,810
settings.

357
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:23,939
These are, um, where you can put

358
00:07:23,939 --> 00:07:24,839
your kind of more

359
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:25,980
important settings here.

360
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,399
So if you want to optimize email

361
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:28,800
deliverability, which I always

362
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,439
recommend,

363
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:30,839
this is basically saying, Hey,

364
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:31,939
smart lead, don't send any

365
00:07:32,069 --> 00:07:33,480
additional baggage in my email.

366
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,860
So, um,

367
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:36,310
my emails land in the inbox as

368
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,360
much as possible.

369
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:38,930
I always have this ticked now

370
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:40,000
force plain Texas

371
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,029
content type.

372
00:07:41,029 --> 00:07:42,920
What this basically means is like

373
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,209
some email providers won't like,

374
00:07:45,209 --> 00:07:46,379
you'll say, Hey,

375
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:47,680
I want to send this to the plain

376
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,879
text email and they'll like

377
00:07:49,019 --> 00:07:49,569
reformat it.

378
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:50,740
You can force your emails

379
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:51,439
plain text.

380
00:07:51,459 --> 00:07:52,939
I haven't seen the like actual

381
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:54,699
results on deliverability, but I

382
00:07:54,699 --> 00:07:55,970
typically don't have this

383
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:57,259
enabled because sometimes it

384
00:07:57,259 --> 00:07:58,470
messes up the formatting.

385
00:07:58,470 --> 00:07:59,899
So your mileage may vary here.

386
00:07:59,899 --> 00:08:00,779
You can split test

387
00:08:00,829 --> 00:08:01,500
this right now.

388
00:08:01,579 --> 00:08:02,800
I just believe this unchecked

389
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,220
since you have this ticked, it's

390
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:04,699
not going to let

391
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:05,930
you track email opens or link

392
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:07,199
clicks, which is what we want

393
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:08,560
because again, that reduces

394
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,240
deliverability.

395
00:08:09,449 --> 00:08:11,439
Now prioritizing sending pattern.

396
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:13,610
Uh, I like to set this just 50% of

397
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:15,500
emails go to new leads and 50%

398
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:16,550
go to follow-ups pretty

399
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:17,509
straightforward.

400
00:08:17,509 --> 00:08:19,019
If you want results to be quicker,

401
00:08:19,019 --> 00:08:20,209
you can send it all to new

402
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,040
leads that way.

403
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,569
Um, you're hitting new people as

404
00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:23,990
fast as possible and new people

405
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:25,000
typically respond

406
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,079
better than follow-up.

407
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:27,040
So you can do that.

408
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:28,540
Um, company level auto pause.

409
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:29,879
I always have this disabled

410
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,120
because there's been plenty of

411
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,250
times where I reach out to two

412
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:33,639
people from the same company.

413
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:34,360
One person

414
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:34,830
says no.

415
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:36,019
And one person says yes.

416
00:08:36,019 --> 00:08:37,899
And what this feature does is if

417
00:08:37,899 --> 00:08:39,879
person a response, your email,

418
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:41,179
then it also pauses person B if

419
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:42,340
they are belong to the same

420
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:43,000
company.

421
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,679
So I don't have this enabled

422
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,419
enhanced email sending.

423
00:08:46,419 --> 00:08:47,879
This is like, if you have outlook

424
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:49,320
accounts, it'll route them to

425
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:49,929
outlook accounts.

426
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:51,159
If you have Google accounts, it'll

427
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:52,070
route them to other Google

428
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:52,600
accounts.

429
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:55,440
Your mileage may vary here.

430
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,879
I usually leave this off.

431
00:08:56,879 --> 00:08:58,769
Uh, and in some cases sending

432
00:08:58,899 --> 00:08:59,960
across providers

433
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:01,480
and say if instead of the same

434
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,059
providers performs better, I

435
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,519
usually leave this off.

436
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:05,539
Um, isolated

437
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,200
sending provider matching.

438
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,789
So right now, as of December,

439
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:11,139
2024, a lot of outlook accounts

440
00:09:11,139 --> 00:09:11,940
reject emails

441
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:12,659
at a lot higher rate.

442
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:13,740
So if you're like, Hey, I don't

443
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:14,769
want to reach out to outlook

444
00:09:14,769 --> 00:09:15,399
accounts.

445
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:16,480
I only want to do the Gmail.

446
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,899
Then you can just take this box.

447
00:09:18,029 --> 00:09:21,559
This depends if you want to filter

448
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:22,850
out certain providers, but in a

449
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:24,019
lot of cases, you just want to

450
00:09:24,019 --> 00:09:26,110
send to all intelligent AI

451
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:26,820
categorization.

452
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,480
This is basically telling smart

453
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,279
lead to like, Hey, whenever we get

454
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:32,279
replies, let's tag them as certain

455
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:33,919
filters, um, which can be useful

456
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:35,129
for inbox management.

457
00:09:35,129 --> 00:09:36,350
I like to have this on.

458
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,029
And then I like to include,

459
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:39,980
um, do not contact out of office,

460
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:42,059
interested, not interested, um,

461
00:09:42,059 --> 00:09:44,200
and meeting a request that pretty

462
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:44,360
much

463
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,370
gets the job done.

464
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:46,720
I have a bunch of extra stuff

465
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,240
inside my smart lead, uh, for

466
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,240
custom tags, which

467
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:50,320
you don't need to have.

468
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,740
Um, so that's why you might see

469
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:53,259
different stuff than what I have

470
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:53,720
here.

471
00:09:53,769 --> 00:09:55,519
Um, ignore auto categorize out of

472
00:09:55,529 --> 00:09:57,159
office from the reply rate.

473
00:09:57,159 --> 00:09:58,360
I like to include it as part

474
00:09:58,409 --> 00:09:59,330
of the reply rate.

475
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:00,519
So I leave this in and then

476
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:01,799
automatically restart AI

477
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:03,000
categorize out of office

478
00:10:03,049 --> 00:10:03,899
from lead returns.

479
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:05,279
This is basically saying someone

480
00:10:05,299 --> 00:10:06,789
says, Hey, I'm out of office until

481
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:07,960
January 15th.

482
00:10:08,009 --> 00:10:09,409
It'll pause them for now.

483
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:11,320
And then in January 15th, it'll

484
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,600
resume them, which is pretty cool.

485
00:10:12,649 --> 00:10:14,399
So I have this enabled high bounce

486
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:15,870
rate auto protection.

487
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:16,830
This is basically saying like,

488
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,320
Hey,

489
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:19,000
if our bounce rate goes above 4%,

490
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,570
pause this campaign so that you

491
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:21,159
don't, you know,

492
00:10:21,419 --> 00:10:22,470
ruin your email account

493
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:23,340
reputation.

494
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:25,139
I like to have this on, uh, email

495
00:10:25,139 --> 00:10:25,639
accounts.

496
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:26,539
This is where you can select the

497
00:10:26,539 --> 00:10:27,600
email accounts again, just in a

498
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,139
different view.

499
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:29,289
If I want to select all of my

500
00:10:29,289 --> 00:10:30,779
3,800 accounts, I can do that

501
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:31,200
here.

502
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,240
Um, and so that's where you can

503
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:34,120
set that up.

504
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,159
Now, last section here, final

505
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:38,110
review in the final review

506
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:38,919
section.

507
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:39,960
This is where you can see

508
00:10:40,009 --> 00:10:41,000
what your emails look like.

509
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
And so this is great.

510
00:10:42,049 --> 00:10:44,269
If you want to see what, if like

511
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:45,080
your spin tax is

512
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:45,480
working.

513
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,480
So you can see a high, hello,

514
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:46,960
first name.

515
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,429
I want to schedule a meeting, book

516
00:10:48,429 --> 00:10:48,919
a call.

517
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:49,909
So you can see, and some of these

518
00:10:49,909 --> 00:10:50,950
will say, hello, first name.

519
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,360
And some of these will say,

520
00:10:52,659 --> 00:10:55,220
um, Oh, looks like it, this did

521
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:55,950
not save.

522
00:10:56,039 --> 00:10:56,750
Hold on.

523
00:10:56,759 --> 00:10:58,840
So in some of these emails, it'll

524
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,240
say hi,

525
00:10:59,450 --> 00:10:59,750
first name.

526
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,039
And some of them, it'll say hello.

527
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:01,559
So hello.

528
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:04,990
Hi, hi, hello.

529
00:11:05,049 --> 00:11:06,169
This is for deliverability

530
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:06,809
reasons.

531
00:11:06,809 --> 00:11:08,450
And you can see some say schedule

532
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,059
a meeting, book a call, book a

533
00:11:10,059 --> 00:11:11,320
call, schedule a meeting.

534
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:11,720
Right.

535
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,870
So the point of this is to add

536
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:14,649
randomization to make your emails,

537
00:11:14,649 --> 00:11:16,759
uh, land in inbox better.

538
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:18,419
I always recommend saying a test

539
00:11:18,419 --> 00:11:19,679
email before you run your

540
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:20,350
campaign.

541
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,309
So you can see what it looks like

542
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:21,799
in the inbox.

543
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:22,720
And then if you want to see what

544
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,220
your email to looks like, this is

545
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,549
where, if I had an

546
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,990
email to, which I'll add super

547
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:28,480
quick, you'll be able to see what

548
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,360
this looks like in your sequences.

549
00:11:30,409 --> 00:11:31,820
So before you push it live, always

550
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,200
send a test email to make sure it

551
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:33,879
looks good.

552
00:11:33,879 --> 00:11:34,590
Always double check

553
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,299
your spin tax looks like, or it

554
00:11:36,299 --> 00:11:38,190
looks right in the editor, because

555
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:39,860
what you see in the editor is what

556
00:11:39,929 --> 00:11:41,389
your recipients will see, and then

557
00:11:41,389 --> 00:11:42,700
also send a test email so you can

558
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,110
see your email signature to make

559
00:11:44,169 --> 00:11:45,090
sure that shows up right.

560
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:46,389
For whatever reason, your email

561
00:11:46,389 --> 00:11:48,350
signature does not show up in the

562
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:48,759
final

563
00:11:49,059 --> 00:11:49,840
review section.

564
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,879
So again, I sped run this super

565
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:53,559
quick to go over like quick start,

566
00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:53,879
how to make

567
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,519
sure your campaign settings are

568
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,000
right.

569
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,669
That's basically everything you

570
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:59,240
need to know, how I like to set up

571
00:11:59,289 --> 00:12:00,320
my campaigns, how I like to set

572
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,740
up, um, everything from there.

573
00:12:01,879 --> 00:12:02,679
And then when you're ready to go,

574
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:04,090
you can just launch your email,

575
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:04,919
um, campaign.

576
00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:06,039
It says select email accounts

577
00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:07,000
because I didn't actually

578
00:12:07,299 --> 00:12:08,899
save one, but if I press this

579
00:12:08,899 --> 00:12:11,240
account, I press save, you'll see

580
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,840
it'll let you just launch the

581
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,169
campaign

582
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:13,659
here.

583
00:12:13,659 --> 00:12:15,399
So that's a quick start guide, how

584
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:16,830
to set up email campaigns.

585
00:12:16,899 --> 00:12:18,360
I went through that super quick,

586
00:12:18,409 --> 00:12:19,570
but if you have any questions,

587
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:20,860
reach out to me in Slack, reach

588
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,279
out in the outbound channel,

589
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:23,820
and we will help you out.

590
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:24,330
Appreciate you.
