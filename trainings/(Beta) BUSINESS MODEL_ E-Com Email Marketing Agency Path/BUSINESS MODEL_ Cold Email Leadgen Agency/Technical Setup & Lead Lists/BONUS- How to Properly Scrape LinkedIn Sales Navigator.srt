1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:00,910
Hey, what's going on, guys?

2
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:02,240
My name is Nick Abraham, and today

3
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:03,310
I'm going to show you how you

4
00:00:03,459 --> 00:00:04,570
can properly scrape Sales

5
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:05,250
Navigator.

6
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:06,610
So I get this question all the

7
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:06,990
time.

8
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,060
Nick, what's the

9
00:00:08,199 --> 00:00:09,300
safest way to scrape Sales

10
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:09,980
Navigator?

11
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:11,380
How can I get my Sales Navigator

12
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:12,679
search to get me business

13
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:13,230
emails?

14
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:14,929
And tons of questions from people

15
00:00:14,929 --> 00:00:16,329
hitting me up on Twitter and

16
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:16,870
YouTube.

17
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:17,710
So I thought I would

18
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:19,239
make a video on this specifically.

19
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:20,510
And if you don't know who I am, my

20
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:21,469
name is Nick Abraham,

21
00:00:21,699 --> 00:00:23,339
like I mentioned before.

22
00:00:23,339 --> 00:00:25,019
I run Libra.io and a other

23
00:00:25,129 --> 00:00:27,620
plethora of SaaS companies in the

24
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:27,739
cool

25
00:00:27,879 --> 00:00:28,440
outreach space.

26
00:00:28,449 --> 00:00:29,519
And we're pretty good when it

27
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:30,949
comes to scraping Sales Navigator,

28
00:00:30,949 --> 00:00:31,800
enriching our

29
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:33,240
data with business emails and so

30
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:33,780
forth.

31
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,210
And so I want to kind of give you

32
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:36,310
a quick overview on how

33
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,219
to properly scrape Sales Navigator

34
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:39,689
and kind of talk about the pros

35
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:41,409
and the cons of Sales Navigator.

36
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:44,090
So Sales Navigator, believe it or

37
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:46,130
not, is what all the big B2B

38
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,679
databases use to kind of build out

39
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,950
their database, right?

40
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:51,560
The only issue is that it does not

41
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,880
provide business email.

42
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:53,859
So on Sales Navigator,

43
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,289
you can apply filters, find a

44
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:56,899
whole bunch of leads that fit your

45
00:00:56,899 --> 00:00:58,369
ICP, but typically they're

46
00:00:58,490 --> 00:00:59,399
not going to have a business email

47
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:00,280
unless they include it in the

48
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:00,719
profile.

49
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,200
And so that's where,

50
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:03,399
you know, data sources like

51
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:04,799
Apollo, ZoomInfo and so forth do

52
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,120
really well is because they'll

53
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:07,370
actually provide the business

54
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:08,090
email, right?

55
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:09,409
But they're basing all their data

56
00:01:09,409 --> 00:01:10,099
off of Sales

57
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:10,659
Navigator.

58
00:01:10,659 --> 00:01:11,969
And typically they're just doing

59
00:01:11,969 --> 00:01:13,310
permutations and other sources to

60
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:13,900
actually get

61
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,340
the business emails, but that's a

62
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,260
whole other topic.

63
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,620
So just to kind of recap, in Sales

64
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:18,920
Navigator,

65
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:20,209
you do not get the business emails

66
00:01:20,209 --> 00:01:21,500
for the leads, but that's okay.

67
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,629
I'm going to show you how to get

68
00:01:22,819 --> 00:01:23,049
them.

69
00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:24,359
And then when it comes to Sales

70
00:01:24,379 --> 00:01:25,959
Navigator, the search results are

71
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:27,379
actually very inaccurate.

72
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:28,739
And this is one of the biggest

73
00:01:28,739 --> 00:01:30,269
issues with Sales Navigator and

74
00:01:30,269 --> 00:01:31,379
why I hate using it.

75
00:01:31,379 --> 00:01:32,299
It's because

76
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:33,709
no matter how you apply the

77
00:01:33,709 --> 00:01:35,510
filters, whether you do Boolean

78
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:37,219
searches or not, your search

79
00:01:37,219 --> 00:01:37,319
result

80
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:39,609
typically on average is only going

81
00:01:39,609 --> 00:01:41,560
to be 33% accurate, right?

82
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,290
So, you know, you may say,

83
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:44,739
hey, I only want people that are

84
00:01:44,849 --> 00:01:46,219
in the United States and it's

85
00:01:46,269 --> 00:01:47,760
going to have leads that are from

86
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,200
India, from all the countries and

87
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:49,719
so forth.

88
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:51,180
And so you really do need to build

89
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,650
a filtering mechanism

90
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:54,219
to kind of make sure that your

91
00:01:54,219 --> 00:01:56,099
search result that you're getting

92
00:01:56,099 --> 00:01:57,689
is accurate to the filters that

93
00:01:57,769 --> 00:01:57,879
you

94
00:01:58,019 --> 00:01:58,269
applied.

95
00:01:58,319 --> 00:01:59,500
So that's, that's one thing I'll

96
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,530
kind of speak about and how to

97
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:01,659
automate that later in this

98
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:02,049
video.

99
00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:03,379
The other thing about Sales

100
00:02:03,379 --> 00:02:04,969
Navigator, this is typical in most

101
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,680
B2B like lead gen databases is

102
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:08,490
that they only show you a select

103
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:10,210
few amount of the leads that are

104
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:11,960
compared to your total results.

105
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,360
So what I mean by that is, you

106
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,719
know, if your search result comes

107
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:16,120
back with a hundred thousand

108
00:02:16,259 --> 00:02:17,909
contacts, typically you're only

109
00:02:17,909 --> 00:02:20,180
going to actually see 2,500 total

110
00:02:20,189 --> 00:02:20,759
leads.

111
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:22,240
And so it's going to show

112
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:23,680
you 25 results per page and a

113
00:02:23,789 --> 00:02:24,939
total of a hundred pages.

114
00:02:24,939 --> 00:02:27,120
So 2,500 total leads per search.

115
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:27,889
And so,

116
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:29,150
you know, if you're wanting to

117
00:02:29,219 --> 00:02:30,710
scrape your entire TAM, right?

118
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:32,090
So let's say your TAM is a hundred

119
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,199
thousand contacts.

120
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:34,710
You're going to have to break down

121
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:35,759
your search result.

122
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:37,219
It's a tiny batches of 2,500.

123
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,360
And I'll show you like the most

124
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,490
effective way of how to kind of

125
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:40,620
think about this using the

126
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:41,460
slice spread method.

127
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:42,539
So I did not come up with the

128
00:02:42,539 --> 00:02:43,539
slice spread method.

129
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:44,810
I'm not even sure where I

130
00:02:44,979 --> 00:02:45,800
learned from, and I don't even

131
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,810
know where I got the spreadsheet

132
00:02:46,819 --> 00:02:47,900
from, but the spreadsheet's

133
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:48,159
outdated,

134
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,719
so it doesn't work, but you can

135
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:51,349
take that same exact process and

136
00:02:51,349 --> 00:02:53,000
build out these tiny search links.

137
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:54,680
So basically what this spreadsheet

138
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,129
does is like, you're coming in

139
00:02:56,129 --> 00:02:57,889
here and you're basically applying

140
00:02:58,039 --> 00:02:59,689
all the geographies that you can

141
00:02:59,689 --> 00:03:01,210
apply, the IDs, right?

142
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:02,930
And so like, you know, let's say

143
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:03,659
you want

144
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,039
to get everyone in the UK.

145
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:06,539
So you want to split the search

146
00:03:06,539 --> 00:03:07,800
because it's too big.

147
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,169
It has a hundred

148
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:09,620
thousand contacts and you need to

149
00:03:09,729 --> 00:03:11,650
break them into batches of 2,500.

150
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,159
Easiest way is probably doing

151
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,599
geography and just doing and

152
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:16,319
breaking each, like your total

153
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:16,830
search.

154
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:18,580
It's a tiny little batches,

155
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:20,020
just by the geography, right?

156
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:21,689
And so you come in here, you can

157
00:03:21,689 --> 00:03:23,599
apply all the different geography

158
00:03:23,939 --> 00:03:24,229
IDs.

159
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:25,500
I just copy and paste in the same

160
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,550
thing, but you get what I'm

161
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:27,000
saying.

162
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,150
And then it builds out the

163
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,120
search link over here.

164
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,490
And then you could just, you know,

165
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:31,629
input this search link into your

166
00:03:31,729 --> 00:03:32,080
tools

167
00:03:32,219 --> 00:03:32,780
and scrape it.

168
00:03:32,789 --> 00:03:34,060
But this is the process of like

169
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:35,370
breaking down your search.

170
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:36,270
You want to break it

171
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:36,599
down.

172
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:37,740
Like you're still like, let's say

173
00:03:37,849 --> 00:03:39,180
you're still targeting marketing,

174
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:40,219
advertising, and managing

175
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,469
directors at these companies,

176
00:03:41,539 --> 00:03:41,930
right?

177
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,210
But now you're just breaking it

178
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:44,729
out down into tiny little batches

179
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,180
so that you get everyone, right?

180
00:03:46,289 --> 00:03:47,840
Because Sales Navigator only shows

181
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,599
2,500 total searches per

182
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:49,990
source.

183
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:51,240
That's why you got to have to use

184
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,340
the sliced bread method.

185
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,580
So I just want to kind of quickly

186
00:03:53,719 --> 00:03:54,990
touch on that and explain how that

187
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:55,389
works.

188
00:03:55,389 --> 00:03:56,759
But the two methods for scraping

189
00:03:56,759 --> 00:03:58,090
Sales Navigator are using

190
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,599
Chrome extensions or a headless

191
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:00,919
browser tool, right?

192
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:02,340
So I'll kind of talk about this

193
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:03,099
and the pros and

194
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:03,819
cons of it.

195
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:05,080
The con of using a Chrome

196
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:07,050
extension is that it is very risky

197
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:07,719
profile.

198
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:08,759
So LinkedIn will

199
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:10,030
ban you if they see that there's,

200
00:04:10,099 --> 00:04:11,530
you know, unusual activity coming

201
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:12,639
through your account.

202
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:13,280
And a lot of

203
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:14,530
these Chrome extensions are

204
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:15,830
cheaply made and can get your

205
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,689
account banned.

206
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:17,790
I've never ran into that

207
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:18,410
situation.

208
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:19,569
I haven't really used a Chrome

209
00:04:19,569 --> 00:04:20,980
extension in a while, but LinkedIn

210
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:21,800
is very sensitive

211
00:04:21,939 --> 00:04:22,360
nowadays.

212
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,779
So if you're in an industry where,

213
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:24,970
or you have a profile that's

214
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:25,990
really built up with a lot

215
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,250
of followers and stuff, it's

216
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:28,750
definitely not worth the risk of

217
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,079
using a Chrome extension,

218
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:30,939
right?

219
00:04:30,939 --> 00:04:31,949
And so if you do use a Chrome

220
00:04:31,949 --> 00:04:33,240
extension, I recommend that you

221
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,079
use like an avatar.

222
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:34,779
So there's

223
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,949
a website called get AIA, get

224
00:04:36,949 --> 00:04:39,160
A-I-A dot I-O that allows you to

225
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,899
rent out profiles.

226
00:04:40,899 --> 00:04:41,339
And, you know,

227
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,920
these are throwaway profiles that

228
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,379
you can put a Chrome extension on

229
00:04:44,379 --> 00:04:45,680
and not have to worry about it.

230
00:04:45,769 --> 00:04:46,730
So that's something I would

231
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:48,079
recommend if you're wanting to use

232
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:48,990
a Chrome extension.

233
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,060
The thing about a

234
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:51,220
Chrome extension as well is that

235
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:52,449
typically the outputs are pretty

236
00:04:52,449 --> 00:04:52,879
basic.

237
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:53,730
So, you know,

238
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:54,829
you're just getting first name,

239
00:04:54,829 --> 00:04:55,670
last name, the title of the

240
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,199
person, their company name,

241
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:58,879
maybe their company website, their

242
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:00,670
LinkedIn URL, sales navigator URL,

243
00:05:00,769 --> 00:05:02,319
leads location, summary,

244
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:02,579
and headline.

245
00:05:02,579 --> 00:05:04,170
Just the basic information.

246
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,779
And then you typically just take

247
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:06,509
that, you know,

248
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,209
CSV export that you just used off

249
00:05:08,209 --> 00:05:09,889
of Chrome extension to scrape and

250
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:11,560
put it into drop contact to go

251
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:11,610
find

252
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:12,529
the business email.

253
00:05:12,529 --> 00:05:13,709
That's the simplest way to do it.

254
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,800
I just don't prefer this method

255
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,199
because,

256
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,199
you know, you're leveraging your

257
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:16,579
profile.

258
00:05:16,579 --> 00:05:18,459
I don't want to have my profile

259
00:05:18,459 --> 00:05:20,220
banned or just,

260
00:05:20,379 --> 00:05:21,850
you know, deleted or anything of

261
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:22,480
that sort.

262
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,839
So I don't like using a Chrome

263
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:24,639
extension,

264
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:25,740
but it's different for everyone.

265
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:26,079
Right.

266
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:27,550
And free plug for myself.

267
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:28,310
I own this tool called

268
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:28,790
Golden Leads.

269
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:29,480
I'm a partner here.

270
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,800
And what we do is we actually use

271
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:34,120
our own network of accounts

272
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:35,560
so that you don't have to use your

273
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:36,290
own account.

274
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:36,720
Right.

275
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,279
And so, you know, once you get

276
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:38,879
your search

277
00:05:39,019 --> 00:05:40,790
result from sales net, you just

278
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:42,879
literally input that search result

279
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,279
into our platform.

280
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:44,959
And we're going

281
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:46,079
to run the scrape through our

282
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:46,600
accounts.

283
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:46,939
Right.

284
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,269
So we don't use your account.

285
00:05:48,269 --> 00:05:49,420
And then we do a lot

286
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,529
more than the average Chrome

287
00:05:50,529 --> 00:05:51,399
extension could do.

288
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,600
And I'll kind of explain some of

289
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,480
the stuff as well.

290
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,040
So, you know, we can get all of

291
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,730
this data very easily, but we do a

292
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:58,250
lot of really cool things on

293
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,040
our own.

294
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,180
So one thing that we do is we're

295
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:03,629
actually getting the activity of

296
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:04,860
the profile.

297
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:05,259
Right.

298
00:06:05,259 --> 00:06:05,329
So

299
00:06:05,579 --> 00:06:06,730
we'll get your sales net search

300
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,930
and we can even see if it's an

301
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:09,350
active profile, meaning has,

302
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,519
you know, have they been active in

303
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:11,319
the last 30 days?

304
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:12,480
And typically what we've seen is

305
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:12,660
we're

306
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,910
running any kind of LinkedIn

307
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:14,480
campaign.

308
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,060
If we target the active profiles,

309
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:17,579
we see a much higher

310
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,689
response rate, connection

311
00:06:18,689 --> 00:06:20,120
acceptance rate, and everything of

312
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:20,699
that sort.

313
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:21,240
Right.

314
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:21,920
We'll even check

315
00:06:22,009 --> 00:06:23,170
if the lead has an open profile so

316
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,449
you can run in-mail campaigns to

317
00:06:24,449 --> 00:06:24,779
them.

318
00:06:24,779 --> 00:06:25,860
And then we'll go even

319
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,959
further and grab the industry that

320
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:30,000
was applied and specific to their

321
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,689
sales net result, company

322
00:06:31,899 --> 00:06:33,199
description, you know, their start

323
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,560
date, how long they've worked at

324
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,759
the company, their company

325
00:06:35,899 --> 00:06:36,930
page, LinkedIn URL.

326
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:38,240
If you want to do some stuff

327
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,199
instead of clay, company location,

328
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:40,519
company

329
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:42,189
employee count range, and then

330
00:06:42,189 --> 00:06:44,180
we'll even do advanced filtering.

331
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:44,939
So I kind of want to show

332
00:06:45,019 --> 00:06:45,209
you that.

333
00:06:45,209 --> 00:06:45,430
Right.

334
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:47,120
So this is kind of what the CSV

335
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,939
looks like when you pull it from

336
00:06:48,939 --> 00:06:49,730
golden leads.

337
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:51,139
And the cool thing is, is that on

338
00:06:51,139 --> 00:06:52,079
the very right of your

339
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:54,019
spreadsheet, we'll basically see,

340
00:06:54,019 --> 00:06:54,250
okay,

341
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,180
hey, does your title actually

342
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:58,370
match what you inputted inside of,

343
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:00,529
you know, your search result?

344
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,079
Yes or no.

345
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:02,480
Right.

346
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,170
Is the industry matching?

347
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:04,959
Yes or no.

348
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:06,509
Is the region matching?

349
00:07:06,589 --> 00:07:07,360
Yes or no.

350
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,160
Is the company

351
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,220
headcount matching?

352
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:09,740
Yes or no.

353
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,170
Because these are the typically

354
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:12,579
the areas where we see the most

355
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,290
inaccuracies when it comes to

356
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:15,790
using Sales Navigator.

357
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:17,899
And so by doing so, we're able to,

358
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:18,360
you know, make

359
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,800
sure, hey, you know, in this

360
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:22,870
search for this client, having the

361
00:07:22,939 --> 00:07:25,430
title as yes only is very

362
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:25,870
important,

363
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:26,240
right?

364
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,160
We can't have any no's because

365
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,420
they can't target outside of this.

366
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,920
So, you know, let's only

367
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:30,939
target the people to yes.

368
00:07:30,939 --> 00:07:32,019
So we can kind of get our search

369
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:33,319
result to be a lot more accurate

370
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:34,939
and relevant

371
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:36,779
to what we want.

372
00:07:36,779 --> 00:07:37,660
So this is kind of like the

373
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:38,839
outputs that we can give you.

374
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:41,639
And then past that, we also do

375
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:43,209
a lot of extra stuff that most

376
00:07:43,209 --> 00:07:44,529
creepers can't pull.

377
00:07:44,529 --> 00:07:46,149
So a great example is company

378
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:47,290
follower URLs.

379
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:48,449
So this is probably some of our

380
00:07:48,449 --> 00:07:49,769
best performing campaigns that we

381
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:50,100
had.

382
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,509
We can actually grab

383
00:07:51,699 --> 00:07:53,230
everyone that follows Zoom Info,

384
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:54,730
for example, or everyone that

385
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:56,379
follows Apollo, for example,

386
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,720
or, you know, go find one of my

387
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,230
competitors and scrape everyone

388
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:00,980
that follows their company page.

389
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,230
And the reason why this is so

390
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:03,649
important is because it's like

391
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:04,399
intent data.

392
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:05,899
Because if anyone's following

393
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,639
Zoom Info on LinkedIn, they're

394
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,920
probably interested in have

395
00:08:11,269 --> 00:08:14,680
knowledge of like B2B, lead gen,

396
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:15,959
lead sourcing,

397
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,209
and things of that sort.

398
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:18,839
So if I'm selling anything within

399
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:20,470
that realm, it's like the best

400
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:20,980
campaign to

401
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:22,110
run because you could basically

402
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:23,040
say something up the lines of

403
00:08:23,139 --> 00:08:23,980
like, hey, I saw that you're

404
00:08:24,029 --> 00:08:24,459
following

405
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,230
Zoom Info on LinkedIn and thought

406
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:27,730
I'd reach out to see if you're

407
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:29,160
interested in my lead gen

408
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:29,680
solution,

409
00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:31,560
XYZ, that does XYZ.

410
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,340
Like that's a game changing

411
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:34,190
campaign.

412
00:08:34,259 --> 00:08:35,860
And so that's

413
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:36,899
one of the things that you could

414
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:37,840
scrape using all the leads.

415
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:39,320
The other one is kind of similar,

416
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:41,580
like a LinkedIn event attendees.

417
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:43,769
So, you know, if you find an event

418
00:08:43,769 --> 00:08:45,950
that has tons of people within

419
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,210
your space, you can go grab

420
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:48,860
everyone that attended it, same

421
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:50,659
similar situation, run a campaign,

422
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:52,600
saying something up the lines of,

423
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,470
hey, I saw that you attended this

424
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:55,580
webinar by XYZ.

425
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:56,879
You know,

426
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,080
we help people do XYZ.

427
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,460
Would you be interested?

428
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:00,750
Whatever it is, right?

429
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:02,059
Totally depends on how you

430
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:02,909
want to run it.

431
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:04,320
And we can also scrape group

432
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,899
members inside of a LinkedIn

433
00:09:05,899 --> 00:09:06,250
group.

434
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:06,950
So you can

435
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,399
find groups that, you know, have

436
00:09:08,509 --> 00:09:08,940
your ICP.

437
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:10,429
We could pull everyone in there.

438
00:09:10,529 --> 00:09:11,470
And then we could also do

439
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:12,940
a lot of other advanced search

440
00:09:13,049 --> 00:09:14,809
features that are coming out soon.

441
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:17,620
So like, let's say you have a

442
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:19,299
list of LinkedIn URLs and you want

443
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,080
to, you know, identify which ones

444
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:22,580
have open profiles or active

445
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,159
profiles.

446
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:24,299
Or if you have like a list of

447
00:09:24,299 --> 00:09:25,820
accounts that you need to search,

448
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,059
we have all of these advanced

449
00:09:27,299 --> 00:09:28,870
search features coming out onto

450
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:30,460
our platform golden leads.

451
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:32,659
And what I'm most excited for is

452
00:09:32,659 --> 00:09:33,100
we're going

453
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:34,779
to build something called a sales

454
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:35,559
nav breaker.

455
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:37,059
And so what we're going to do is

456
00:09:37,059 --> 00:09:38,120
actually on our end,

457
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:39,299
instead of you having to do the

458
00:09:39,299 --> 00:09:40,639
slice spread method, we're going

459
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:42,000
to break the sales nav search into

460
00:09:42,139 --> 00:09:43,250
tiny little batches so that we

461
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,190
could scrape more than 2,500 at a

462
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:45,470
time.

463
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:47,019
And we'll be the only platform

464
00:09:47,149 --> 00:09:48,610
in the entire world that can, you

465
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:50,100
know, be able to do this where,

466
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,700
you know, if you're like, hey,

467
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:53,139
I want to, you know, just get

468
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:54,899
everyone on this list as a hundred

469
00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:56,559
thousand people on it.

470
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:57,610
And I don't want to do this

471
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:59,059
tedious process of doing the slice

472
00:09:59,059 --> 00:10:00,179
spread method that I explained

473
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:00,629
earlier.

474
00:10:00,629 --> 00:10:01,740
You know, you can put it into

475
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:02,440
golden leads.

476
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,179
So we'll be able to do that.

477
00:10:03,179 --> 00:10:04,049
Can't do it yet,

478
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,179
but we will vary, you know,

479
00:10:05,179 --> 00:10:06,850
probably in like the next 30 to 60

480
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:07,340
days.

481
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,700
But yeah, that's kind of like

482
00:10:08,789 --> 00:10:10,019
an overview of how to scrape sales

483
00:10:10,029 --> 00:10:10,600
navigator.

484
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,789
And like I mentioned before,

485
00:10:11,789 --> 00:10:13,419
right, if you want to get

486
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:15,690
the business emails, all you need

487
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,850
to do is run the LinkedIn profile

488
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:20,480
URLs into drop contact or pretty

489
00:10:20,539 --> 00:10:20,539
much

490
00:10:20,769 --> 00:10:21,690
any enrichment tool and you'll be

491
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:22,759
able to get the business email.

492
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:25,159
And so that's a quick overview

493
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:26,200
on how to scrape sales navigator.
