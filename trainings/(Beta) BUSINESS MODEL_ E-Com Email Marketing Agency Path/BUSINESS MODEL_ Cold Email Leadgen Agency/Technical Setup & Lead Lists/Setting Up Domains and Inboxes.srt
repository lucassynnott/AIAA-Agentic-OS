1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:01,340
Okay, so this video is going to

2
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:02,379
show you how to set up the

3
00:00:02,379 --> 00:00:04,750
infrastructure necessary to run

4
00:00:04,759 --> 00:00:05,969
mass outreach cold email

5
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:06,719
campaigns.

6
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:09,650
As you can see, you cannot send

7
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:12,800
cold emails at scale from a single

8
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,560
domain.

9
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,199
You need to set up brand new

10
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:16,699
domains specifically for the

11
00:00:16,699 --> 00:00:18,260
function of running cold email

12
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:19,019
campaigns.

13
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:20,980
And we have over a thousand of

14
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:21,679
these.

15
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:24,160
For starters, you'll probably need

16
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,399
about 50 email inboxes to run

17
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:27,899
outreach at scale.

18
00:00:28,699 --> 00:00:30,370
We have literally a thousand

19
00:00:30,379 --> 00:00:32,200
because we send a lot, a lot, a

20
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,840
lot of volume with our email

21
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,320
campaigns.

22
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,719
But either way, here's how you

23
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,320
actually go ahead and set up, you

24
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,359
know, a bunch of domains and

25
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:41,969
inboxes.

26
00:00:41,979 --> 00:00:43,530
And this kind of stuff is even

27
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:44,600
confusing to me.

28
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,259
I'm a marketer.

29
00:00:45,259 --> 00:00:46,329
I don't like the technical stuff.

30
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:47,399
So let me explain it to you in

31
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:48,299
very simple terms.

32
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:50,119
If you work at a business and you

33
00:00:50,119 --> 00:00:51,799
have an email address at that

34
00:00:51,799 --> 00:00:53,789
business, Christian at list

35
00:00:53,799 --> 00:00:55,979
kit.io, right?

36
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:58,340
Christian at list kit.io is my

37
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,240
main business email for my work

38
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,159
communication at list kit.

39
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:03,659
You probably have, if you're

40
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:04,989
watching this, an email

41
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:06,709
specifically for the job you work

42
00:01:06,709 --> 00:01:08,269
at or the university you go to or

43
00:01:08,269 --> 00:01:09,920
the university you went to that is

44
00:01:09,969 --> 00:01:11,530
set up specifically for that

45
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:12,239
purpose.

46
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,250
Think of this like setting up

47
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,340
hundreds of new email addresses

48
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:18,420
like the one you already have but

49
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,230
just for cold email because if

50
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,430
your main business email goes to

51
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:24,299
spam and doesn't send emails

52
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:26,060
anymore as a result of a cold

53
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:28,129
email campaign, you will not be

54
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:29,769
able to email your coworkers, your

55
00:01:29,769 --> 00:01:31,469
clients, your boss, or anything,

56
00:01:31,469 --> 00:01:31,969
right?

57
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:34,620
So this is why we set up dozens if

58
00:01:34,689 --> 00:01:36,930
not hundreds of brand new email

59
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,079
accounts for cold email.

60
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:40,530
And there's a two-step process.

61
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,640
First, you have to buy the domain,

62
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,230
right?

63
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:45,519
List kit.io is our business domain

64
00:01:45,609 --> 00:01:47,900
and Christian at list kit.io is an

65
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,459
inbox on that domain.

66
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:51,769
So you have to purchase a ton of

67
00:01:51,769 --> 00:01:54,189
different domains from a tool like

68
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,900
GoDaddy or Porkbun.

69
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:58,140
Most of you have probably heard of

70
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,540
GoDaddy, right?

71
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:01,480
They used to have famous ads with

72
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,480
girls in them and I don't know.

73
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,769
They had really good marketing for

74
00:02:04,769 --> 00:02:05,879
a domain registrar, which is

75
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:06,480
hilarious.

76
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:09,240
But Porkbun is a tool that we use

77
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,229
most of the time to set up these

78
00:02:11,229 --> 00:02:13,819
domains for the campaigns, right?

79
00:02:13,819 --> 00:02:17,080
And here's a good example.

80
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,360
Like let's just say

81
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,280
GetAgencyServices.com.

82
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,639
This is probably taken, but let's

83
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:22,419
see if it's not.

84
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:25,110
Okay.

85
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,219
It is available.

86
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,960
GetAgencyServices.com.

87
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,289
Then I would try

88
00:02:29,289 --> 00:02:31,879
GoAgencyServices.com.

89
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:35,159
Available.

90
00:02:35,379 --> 00:02:36,879
So I would sit here and literally

91
00:02:36,909 --> 00:02:38,300
purchase 25 domains.

92
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,400
This is what you need to do.

93
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:41,889
Sit in a tool like Porkbun and

94
00:02:41,889 --> 00:02:45,199
purchase 25 different domains and

95
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,780
then check out and purchase them.

96
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:49,639
And they're $11 each for a year,

97
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:51,139
which, you know, at first is

98
00:02:51,139 --> 00:02:51,840
expensive,

99
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,879
but then you don't pay for it for

100
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:53,699
a whole nother year.

101
00:02:53,699 --> 00:02:56,439
And once you have all 25 domains

102
00:02:56,439 --> 00:02:58,469
ready to go, you purchase them and

103
00:02:58,469 --> 00:02:59,460
they are now yours.

104
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:01,409
So the first part of the process

105
00:03:01,409 --> 00:03:02,340
has been set up

106
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,270
where you have the domains

107
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:06,639
necessary to run campaigns.

108
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:09,069
What you don't have is the inboxes

109
00:03:09,069 --> 00:03:09,650
yet.

110
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,259
So what you need to do is go into

111
00:03:15,289 --> 00:03:17,539
Google Admin Panel.

112
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,810
And honestly, I hate doing this

113
00:03:25,849 --> 00:03:26,639
stuff on my own.

114
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,500
So if I butcher this, I'm sorry

115
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,110
because I haven't done this

116
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:31,919
process in five years and I'll

117
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:33,219
show you why in a second because I

118
00:03:33,219 --> 00:03:34,430
have people doing it for me.

119
00:03:36,539 --> 00:03:38,090
But basically what you need to do

120
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:39,460
is go into because think of it

121
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:40,240
like this.

122
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,699
You have your 25 domains purchased

123
00:03:42,699 --> 00:03:44,530
and ready to go, but you don't

124
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:46,460
have the email accounts ready to

125
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,000
go.

126
00:03:47,419 --> 00:03:48,919
And where do you send emails from

127
00:03:48,949 --> 00:03:49,419
Gmail?

128
00:03:49,419 --> 00:03:50,919
Gmail is a Google business.

129
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:52,699
So you need to go into your Google

130
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:54,689
Admin account, which it looks like

131
00:03:54,689 --> 00:03:57,770
I can't even get into, and set up

132
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:03,780
Google email inboxes.

133
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,379
Like to set up multiple inboxes in

134
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:08,939
Gmail, navigate to settings,

135
00:04:08,939 --> 00:04:10,139
select inbox type.

136
00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:11,580
Like you just have to go into the

137
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,199
Google Admin panel and build these

138
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:14,840
inboxes out using the domains that

139
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,879
you just purchased.

140
00:04:16,259 --> 00:04:18,019
Because once you have the inboxes

141
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:19,899
created, you now have both pieces

142
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:21,550
of the puzzle with the inbox and

143
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:23,519
the domain set up and ready to go.

144
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:25,509
So you can then connect it to a

145
00:04:25,509 --> 00:04:28,180
tool like Smartlead and have these

146
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:30,620
inboxes in this dashboard that

147
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:33,420
you're sending emails from.

148
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,060
Because we only, so for

149
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:37,290
simplicity's sake, let's say I

150
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:39,319
have 100 domains.

151
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:41,779
I can only send 11 emails a day

152
00:04:41,779 --> 00:04:44,230
per domain before my account's at

153
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:46,120
risk of going to spam.

154
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:47,449
If you send it any more than 11

155
00:04:47,449 --> 00:04:48,459
per day per domain, you're

156
00:04:48,459 --> 00:04:49,620
probably going to go to spam and

157
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:50,980
your whole campaign is toast.

158
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:52,870
So like I said, you have to set up

159
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:54,769
a lot of different email inboxes

160
00:04:54,769 --> 00:04:56,449
so you can send a ton of volume

161
00:04:56,459 --> 00:04:58,060
without sending a lot of volume

162
00:04:58,410 --> 00:04:59,259
per inbox.

163
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:00,470
Right?

164
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,620
So once you purchase the domains

165
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:04,680
from a tool like Pork Bun, once

166
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,680
you set everything up in a tool

167
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,639
like Gmail or Outlook, you now

168
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:09,910
have your email inboxes.

169
00:05:09,939 --> 00:05:12,019
And then you just hook them up to

170
00:05:12,019 --> 00:05:14,259
this tool called Smartlead and go

171
00:05:14,259 --> 00:05:15,230
from there.

172
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:17,889
In the description, I'm going to

173
00:05:17,889 --> 00:05:19,660
link a video from my partner Andre

174
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:21,160
where he basically sets up an

175
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,970
inbox from scratch doing this

176
00:05:23,149 --> 00:05:25,060
whole process manually.

177
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:27,579
And you will see it is a massive,

178
00:05:27,579 --> 00:05:29,420
massive pain in the ass that

179
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:31,410
nobody wants to handle or deal

180
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:32,079
with.

181
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:35,870
Nobody wants to deal with.

182
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:36,120
Right?

183
00:05:36,139 --> 00:05:37,639
You don't want to sit here and set

184
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,779
up 15 domains, 30 inboxes for each

185
00:05:39,779 --> 00:05:40,819
of your clients.

186
00:05:41,379 --> 00:05:43,420
The reason why I said earlier that

187
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:45,209
I haven't done this in years is

188
00:05:45,209 --> 00:05:47,139
because our tool, ListKit, has

189
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,160
basically a cold email set up in a

190
00:05:49,189 --> 00:05:50,810
box where you come to us and you

191
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,279
say, hey, I need 30 domains and 60

192
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:53,860
inboxes.

193
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:56,750
You pay us $691 a month to manage

194
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,889
everything and we build it all out

195
00:05:58,889 --> 00:06:00,879
for you where you get the domain

196
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:02,930
set up, the inbox is set up, and

197
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:05,319
you have the ability to send 660

198
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:07,600
emails a day for your clients.

199
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,029
Right?

200
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:09,540
So you can do this process

201
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:11,230
manually using the link below this

202
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:11,730
video.

203
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:13,540
It's from my partner Andre.

204
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,740
It basically shows you how to

205
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:15,819
properly set up an inbox.

206
00:06:15,899 --> 00:06:17,769
If you're, you know, just starting

207
00:06:17,769 --> 00:06:19,569
out, you're balling on a budget, I

208
00:06:19,569 --> 00:06:21,319
would highly recommend doing it on

209
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:22,740
your own and just sucking it up

210
00:06:22,829 --> 00:06:23,660
for a few hours.

211
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,759
If you want us to do it for you,

212
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,810
you go through a tool like ListKit

213
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:29,569
just like you would do for the

214
00:06:29,569 --> 00:06:31,670
data, except this time you come to

215
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:33,220
us for the inboxes and the

216
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:34,990
domains, and we will build this

217
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:36,800
out for you for a monthly fee.

218
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,199
Right?

219
00:06:38,019 --> 00:06:39,560
There is a monthly fee either way

220
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,810
because you have to pay for

221
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:42,339
inboxes and domains, or you can

222
00:06:42,339 --> 00:06:43,779
just use the monthly fee and put

223
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:45,240
it towards a ListKit build out

224
00:06:45,449 --> 00:06:46,939
where we handle all this for you

225
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:49,029
so that you log into a sending

226
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,389
tool and you have 60 email inboxes

227
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:53,839
warmed up and ready to go so you

228
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:55,259
can start emailing from them so

229
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:56,759
you can launch a campaign that

230
00:06:56,769 --> 00:06:58,850
reaches out to 10,000 people a

231
00:06:58,850 --> 00:06:59,519
month.

232
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:01,149
So that is the manual process of

233
00:07:01,149 --> 00:07:03,079
setting up inboxes and domains.

234
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:03,879
It's not fun.

235
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:05,319
Nobody wants to do it, but it is

236
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:06,779
necessary to get results.

237
00:07:07,899 --> 00:07:10,410
So, at this point, you have now

238
00:07:10,509 --> 00:07:13,160
learned how to set up inboxes, how

239
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:15,420
to write good copy, how to build a

240
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:16,509
list of leads.

241
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,870
Everything is all ready to go, and

242
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,040
I've shown you real examples of

243
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,350
different campaigns built out and

244
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:20,819
ready.

245
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:22,810
So you basically now have a very

246
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:25,019
basic beginner knowledge of how to

247
00:07:25,019 --> 00:07:26,779
do cold email and get actual

248
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:28,259
results from them.

249
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:29,680
So, there's going to be a ton more

250
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,750
videos in here going over

251
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,139
different subsectors of issues

252
00:07:32,139 --> 00:07:33,300
you're going to run into and

253
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,850
things you need help with, but

254
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:36,600
this is the basic gist of how to

255
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,660
do cold email.

256
00:07:37,779 --> 00:07:39,449
So, hopefully you enjoyed, there's

257
00:07:39,449 --> 00:07:40,540
going to be questions and

258
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:41,990
concerns, and you guys are going

259
00:07:42,029 --> 00:07:43,439
to have things that you need help

260
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:43,920
with.

261
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,230
I know, and I'm aware of this, and

262
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:46,410
I'm looking forward to hearing

263
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:47,660
from you so I can help you out,

264
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:49,160
but hopefully this was valuable,

265
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,750
and congrats on kicking off your

266
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:52,709
journey of running your very own

267
00:07:52,709 --> 00:07:54,120
cold email business.

268
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:54,500
Thanks.
