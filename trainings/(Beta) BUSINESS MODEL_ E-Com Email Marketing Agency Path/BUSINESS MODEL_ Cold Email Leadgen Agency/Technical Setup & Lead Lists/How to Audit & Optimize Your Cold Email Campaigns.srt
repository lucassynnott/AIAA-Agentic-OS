00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,160
What's going on y'all in this

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,359
video i'm going to be showing you

3
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:05,589
how to audit a cold email campaign

4
00:00:05,629 --> 00:00:07,219
so basically taking all the

5
00:00:07,219 --> 00:00:09,070
responses you've got so far and

6
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:11,039
showing you how to optimize them

7
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:12,000
for

8
00:00:12,029 --> 00:00:13,609
more results based on what you've

9
00:00:13,609 --> 00:00:15,109
already been seeing working so

10
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:16,940
step number one go to your gmail

11
00:00:16,989 --> 00:00:18,600
inbox itself and click on this

12
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,190
little gear icon here and all

13
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:21,839
you're going to do is type the

14
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:22,160
subject

15
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:23,120
line of the cold email you're

16
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,280
sending it might be quick question

17
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,440
it might be something different

18
00:00:26,989 --> 00:00:28,760
into the line that says subject go

19
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:30,399
down to search and go to inbox

20
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:33,119
instead of all mail and then click

21
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:35,280
search and what you're going to

22
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,340
have here is all of your replies

going to do is okay i actually

26
00:00:41,929 --> 00:00:44,460
made this a little bit trickier

27
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,509
than i had to because i want to

28
00:00:47,509 --> 00:00:48,479
get rid of

29
00:00:51,429 --> 00:00:56,479

33
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:08,260
is go through every single cold

34
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:10,129
email that got a reply not

35
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:11,599
interested skip

36
00:01:11,629 --> 00:01:13,659
intrigue feel free to send the

37
00:01:13,659 --> 00:01:15,980
video thanks so this is a positive

38
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:17,760
reply we're going to star it to

39
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:17,920
make

40
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:19,439
it easy to find and you're

41
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,250
basically going to go through

42
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:23,280
every single positive reply that

43
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:23,439
you've

44
00:01:23,469 --> 00:01:25,709
got and you're going to star them

45
00:01:25,709 --> 00:01:27,650
all until you get to the end of

46
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,599
the inbox and you have every

47
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:30,079
single

48
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:34,530
reply start right because all this

49
00:01:34,549 --> 00:01:36,159
is going to do is make a really

50
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:38,000
easy crm for you to go into

51
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:39,659
and see all these positive replies

52
00:01:39,969 --> 00:01:45,030
right so um doesn't have mwr

53
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:46,719
because mwr is like the warm-up

54
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:48,269
emails so all them were showing up

55
00:01:48,269 --> 00:01:49,500
but here we go right all the

56
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,840
positive replies are here um so

57
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,000
all

58
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:53,609
you're going to do is whenever

59
00:01:53,609 --> 00:01:55,409
there's a positive reply go to the

60
00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:57,200
email that you sent over to them

61
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:58,599
was researching cannabis brands

62
00:01:58,599 --> 00:02:00,049
and came across your website based

63
00:02:00,049 --> 00:02:01,030
on your website i think your

64
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:01,280
products

65
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:04,069
would go viral and all you're

66
00:02:04,069 --> 00:02:07,090
going to do is go over to the cold

67
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:07,760
email

68
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:10,189
scripts that you wrote up i don't

69
00:02:10,189 --> 00:02:12,479
know where you might be keeping

70
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:14,000
track of it maybe it's notion

71
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,159
maybe

72
00:02:14,189 --> 00:02:16,340
it's trello um but all you're

73
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,750
going to do go into the place you

74
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:21,039
keep your scripts and find the

75
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:21,599
exact

76
00:02:21,629 --> 00:02:23,259
angle that got the positive reply

77
00:02:23,259 --> 00:02:24,889
um which i think is this one right

78
00:02:24,909 --> 00:02:26,479
here and you're going to put a one

79
00:02:26,509 --> 00:02:27,830
next to it right and you're just

80
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:29,219
going to keep tallying up all the

81
00:02:29,229 --> 00:02:30,560
angles that you get positive

82
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:31,979
replies from until you're at the

83
00:02:31,979 --> 00:02:33,349
end and then you're going to see

84
00:02:33,349 --> 00:02:34,770
like for example this one is

85
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:35,039
already

86
00:02:35,069 --> 00:02:36,360
fully tallied up because i went

87
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,800
through every single one of these

88
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,199
angles found which angle got the

89
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:39,979
reply

90
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:41,879
and marked it up over here so

91
00:02:41,949 --> 00:02:44,349
you'll see right email 1a had four

92
00:02:44,349 --> 00:02:46,639
positive replies 1b had 11 and a

93
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:46,879
half

94
00:02:46,909 --> 00:02:49,000
positive replies 1c had seven

95
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,090
replies seven and a half nine and

96
00:02:51,219 --> 00:02:52,960
a half and you might be wondering

97
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:54,629
where's the half coming from if

98
00:02:54,659 --> 00:02:56,300
the response is to a follow-up

99
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:58,080
like if email three got responded

100
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:58,479
to

101
00:02:58,509 --> 00:03:00,590
i give half a point to every angle

102
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:02,199
that was sent before that so

103
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:04,009
whatever email two angle got sent

104
00:03:04,139 --> 00:03:04,159
i

105
00:03:04,189 --> 00:03:05,770
give a half a point and whatever

106
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:07,370
email one angle got sent i sent i

107
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:08,960
give half a point so at the end

108
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:10,080
you're going to have all these

109
00:03:10,139 --> 00:03:11,270
tallies and you're like what do i

110
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:12,960
do from here well you optimize the

111
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:14,610
campaign based on which angles are

112
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:16,789
actually working in your outreach

113
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:19,120
right so for example in this one

114
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:21,219
this has 11 and a half responses

115
00:03:21,219 --> 00:03:23,250
what email 1b email 1c only has

116
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,620
seven and then email 1a has four

117
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:27,120
i would get rid of 1a it only had

118
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,819
four which is way less than 11 and

119
00:03:28,819 --> 00:03:32,180
a half right and then all you're

120
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:34,419
going to do is run email 1a and

121
00:03:34,419 --> 00:03:36,610
email 1b as your next round of

122
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:38,960
campaigns right so you went from

123
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,189
three

124
00:03:39,229 --> 00:03:40,750
angles to two um these ones are

125
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,310
pretty even nine and a half and

126
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:43,830
seven and a half and that's the

127
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,000
only

128
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:45,550
other ones with the test but yeah

129
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:46,810
it's pretty simple really

130
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:48,479
elementary stuff tally up all your

131
00:03:48,509 --> 00:03:50,169
positive replies as you get them

132
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,189
see which angles got the best or

133
00:03:52,189 --> 00:03:54,159
most amount of positive replies

134
00:03:54,189 --> 00:03:55,280
optimize the campaign by

135
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:56,889
eliminating the losing angles and

136
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,240
go from there so pretty simple

137
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:58,789
straightforward

138
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:00,830
that's how you optimize campaigns

139
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:02,629
for what's already working i do

140
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:04,479
this once a month for my clients i

141
00:04:04,509 --> 00:04:06,129
really recommend that every single

142
00:04:06,169 --> 00:04:07,680
month you do it for your client as

143
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,960
well and you'll get them more

144
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:10,159
results moving forward because

145
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:11,319
they're going to double down on

146
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:12,629
what's already working so thanks
