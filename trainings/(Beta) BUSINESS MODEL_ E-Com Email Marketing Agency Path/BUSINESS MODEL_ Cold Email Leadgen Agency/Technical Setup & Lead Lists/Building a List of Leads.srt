1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,459
All right, in this video, I'm

2
00:00:01,459 --> 00:00:02,720
going to show you how to build a

3
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:04,250
list of leads for your clients or

4
00:00:04,339 --> 00:00:05,240
for your own campaigns

5
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:06,519
Because you're probably saying

6
00:00:06,519 --> 00:00:07,820
where in the world do I get

7
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:10,019
5,000 email addresses of people

8
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:11,439
that I want to work with with

9
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:13,279
tools like list kit pulled up in

10
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:14,000
front of me

11
00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:15,740
Disclaimer, this is my software

12
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:16,370
company.

13
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:18,199
I'm a co-founder at this business

14
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:20,250
It's the only tool that I use to

15
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,190
get lists of leads if you would

16
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:23,649
like to use other tools on the

17
00:00:23,649 --> 00:00:24,379
marketplace

18
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:25,949
No hard feelings at all.

19
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:28,160
I just don't have the expertise

20
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,839
necessary to teach you about it

21
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:31,859
so for the sake of this video, I'm

22
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:33,020
going to show you how to use list

23
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:33,210
kit

24
00:00:33,229 --> 00:00:34,329
To get a list of emails to

25
00:00:34,329 --> 00:00:35,729
actually reach out to with the

26
00:00:35,729 --> 00:00:36,829
email machine that you're

27
00:00:36,969 --> 00:00:37,719
building.

28
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:37,859
So

29
00:00:37,869 --> 00:00:40,000
let's say you want to reach out to

30
00:00:40,369 --> 00:00:42,579
first of all, um, think of any

31
00:00:42,579 --> 00:00:44,640
company in the world and

32
00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:46,280
Realize that they can be

33
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,640
categorized based on a few things

34
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,630
industry.

35
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:50,479
Are they marketing?

36
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:51,479
Are they restaurants?

37
00:00:51,479 --> 00:00:52,270
Are they hotels?

38
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:54,229
Is it a software company you

39
00:00:54,229 --> 00:00:56,500
filter based on industry first?

40
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:58,460
Then you filter by how many

41
00:00:58,460 --> 00:00:59,729
employees are at the company

42
00:00:59,729 --> 00:01:01,200
because your client might want to

43
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,759
target small businesses big

44
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:03,299
businesses

45
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:05,719
Medium-sized businesses and then

46
00:01:05,719 --> 00:01:07,329
where are they located if you have

47
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:08,760
a client who only works with

48
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:09,780
florida companies?

49
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:11,209
You're going to need to select

50
00:01:11,209 --> 00:01:12,810
florida as a filter

51
00:01:13,189 --> 00:01:15,459
Inside of this of the data tool

52
00:01:16,189 --> 00:01:18,120
And then to finish it off you can

53
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,540
filter based on job title.

54
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:20,829
Do you want to reach out to ceos

55
00:01:20,829 --> 00:01:21,640
owners founders?

56
00:01:22,069 --> 00:01:24,340
chief marketing officers

57
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:26,599
Operations managers hr all of

58
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,170
these filters are possible with

59
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:29,620
list kit and other data tools

60
00:01:29,629 --> 00:01:31,730
So let's dive in right.

61
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:32,680
Let's say for the sake of this

62
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:32,989
video.

63
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:34,739
I want to reach out to companies

64
00:01:34,739 --> 00:01:36,019
that are in

65
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:40,019
hospitality

66
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:42,019
hospitality industry

67
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:44,019
In the u.s

68
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:46,700
But let's say you have a client

69
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:47,920
that does marketing for

70
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,370
hospitality companies

71
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:54,140
Okay, great we have

72
00:01:54,549 --> 00:01:56,739
Hospitality companies in the u.s.

73
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,739
And let's say we specifically want

74
00:01:58,739 --> 00:02:00,340
hotels so hotel

75
00:02:00,349 --> 00:02:02,340
I would type in and as a keyword

76
00:02:02,349 --> 00:02:03,739
This is going to filter out any

77
00:02:03,739 --> 00:02:05,129
company that is not listed as a

78
00:02:05,129 --> 00:02:05,459
hotel

79
00:02:05,829 --> 00:02:08,020
inside of our database

80
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:10,449
And we're left with eight hundred

81
00:02:10,449 --> 00:02:11,629
thousand people at fourteen

82
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:12,659
thousand companies

83
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:14,430
Which just means that most of the

84
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:16,030
companies in here have a lot of

85
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:16,740
employees?

86
00:02:18,189 --> 00:02:20,310
So let's also add in a filter of

87
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:21,939
one to two hundred employees

88
00:02:21,939 --> 00:02:22,740
you're basically

89
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:24,520
Building a pot.

90
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:25,500
You have a bunch of puzzle pieces

91
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,259
out in front of you.

92
00:02:26,259 --> 00:02:27,699
You have to construct the puzzle

93
00:02:27,699 --> 00:02:28,500
in such a way that

94
00:02:28,509 --> 00:02:30,389
You get the exact list of people

95
00:02:30,389 --> 00:02:32,310
that you want to reach out to for

96
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:33,960
yourself or for your clients

97
00:02:34,389 --> 00:02:38,979
So now we have a list of hotels

98
00:02:38,979 --> 00:02:39,860
pulled up in front of me

99
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:45,669
Hospitality recruitment agency

100
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:46,740
would actually don't want that

101
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:48,990
Great accommodation hotel looking

102
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,360
for best and cheapest place to

103
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:51,939
stay in los angeles home page

104
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:54,169
Okay, so basically all of these

105
00:02:54,169 --> 00:02:55,680
companies given there's always a

106
00:02:55,699 --> 00:02:57,139
few outliers that aren't fitting

107
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:58,629
The search that we want that's

108
00:02:58,659 --> 00:03:01,139
just the nature of data in general

109
00:03:01,509 --> 00:03:04,229
But bottom line we now have a list

110
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,860
of hospitality companies

111
00:03:06,229 --> 00:03:08,340
to reach out to

112
00:03:08,349 --> 00:03:10,259
In the hotel sector specifically

113
00:03:10,259 --> 00:03:12,150
and what we want to do is finish

114
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:12,740
off with

115
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:16,520
Job titles so ceo owner founder

Marketing vp of marketing right so

120
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:25,419
like whatever your client

121
00:03:25,419 --> 00:03:25,939
specifies

122
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:29,020
For the targeting it the the type

123
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,189
of people that they want to reach

124
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:30,500
out to

125
00:03:30,509 --> 00:03:32,259
You come into a tool like list kit

126
00:03:32,259 --> 00:03:33,860
and build that list for them

127
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:36,120
Up until the point where okay,

128
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:38,259
this looks like a good list

129
00:03:38,569 --> 00:03:40,629
All this is looking good owner

130
00:03:40,629 --> 00:03:42,099
president marketing manager

131
00:03:42,099 --> 00:03:43,539

132
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,219
Great, this is looking good.

133
00:03:45,219 --> 00:03:47,060
Let's go ahead and export the list

134
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:49,300
I want

135
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,780
10 people per company so I can

00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:52,169
reach out to several people at the

137
00:03:52,169 --> 00:03:52,750
same company

138
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:54,800
And then you enter how many leads

139
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,060
you want if you want 5,000

140
00:03:59,229 --> 00:04:00,639
Let's say you want 3,000.

141
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:02,289
Okay, great 3,000 leads redeem

142
00:04:02,289 --> 00:04:02,590

143
00:04:02,949 --> 00:04:04,139

00:04:04,139 --> 00:04:05,129
You're going to get a list of

145
00:04:05,129 --> 00:04:05,689
email credits

146
00:04:06,069 --> 00:04:08,300
You know 3,000 people deep if you

147
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:10,099
only want 50 like i'm going to do

148
00:04:10,099 --> 00:04:11,439
here to give you guys a quick

149
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:11,860
example

150
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:14,210
Redeemed credits my list is being

151
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:14,580
built

152
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:17,540
And once it's ready I get sent a

153
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:20,600
csv file to my inbox that looks

154
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,300
like this

155
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:24,579
Let me open it real quick

156
00:04:26,949 --> 00:04:28,579
Where is it?

157
00:04:28,949 --> 00:04:34,870
And here is an example of what

158
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:35,689
this list

159
00:04:36,069 --> 00:04:37,470
Looks like here.

160
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:37,959
We go ready

161
00:04:38,339 --> 00:04:40,910
We get their email their name

162
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:42,019
their linkedin profile

163
00:04:42,389 --> 00:04:44,800
Job title company name

164
00:04:45,069 --> 00:04:46,459
So like in the earlier videos when

165
00:04:46,459 --> 00:04:47,699
I was showing you the company

166
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:49,459
underscore name text replacement

167
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:50,709
It just pulls in the name of the

168
00:04:50,709 --> 00:04:52,819
company from this csv file

169
00:04:53,089 --> 00:04:55,079
So it'll say circa divine

170
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,069
birdine's current marin ralph and

171
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:57,459
russo

172
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:58,579
Like it'll pull in the name of the

173
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,720
actual business that you want to

174
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,250
reach out to

175
00:05:00,629 --> 00:05:01,930
um

176
00:05:01,949 --> 00:05:03,550
So it seems more personalized and

177
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:04,980
more relevant to them, but

178
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,209
In a nutshell, this is how you get

179
00:05:07,209 --> 00:05:08,509
a good list of leads for your

180
00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:09,459
client at scale

181
00:05:10,389 --> 00:05:11,980
Um sent right to your email and

182
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:13,779
you can just plug in this csv file

183
00:05:13,779 --> 00:05:14,180
into

184
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:16,899
The sending tool right so like in

185
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:17,540
the last video

186
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,629
I was showing you what the actual

187
00:05:19,629 --> 00:05:21,110
campaigns look like when you're

188
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:21,540
running them

189
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:25,779
And if I go here

190
00:05:26,149 --> 00:05:28,930
Import leads like all I would do

191
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:30,740
is just drag and drop my csv

192
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:33,300
Into this box and i'm good to go

193
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,339
right i'm not going to do it here

194
00:05:34,339 --> 00:05:35,170
because that would mess up my

195
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:35,939
actual campaign

196
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:37,810
But you draw you literally

197
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:39,379
download the csv file drag and

198
00:05:39,379 --> 00:05:40,339
drop it into this

199
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:42,230
And all of the leads are uploaded

200
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:43,620
into your sending tool

201
00:05:43,629 --> 00:05:45,040
You throw in the copy that you

202
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,699
wrote that we've gone over in the

203
00:05:46,699 --> 00:05:48,100
in the past couple videos

204
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:51,060
And the campaign is ready and good

205
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:51,300
to go

206
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:53,300
Okay, so that's how list kit works

207
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:54,850
There'll be more info on how to

208
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:56,500
sign up for list kit down below

209
00:05:56,509 --> 00:05:58,629
I'll go through the website real

210
00:05:58,629 --> 00:05:59,220
quick basically

211
00:05:59,589 --> 00:06:02,040
What you can do with any data

212
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,470
company that you work with is

213
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:04,500
charge your clients

214
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,480
This subscription fee so like bake

215
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,120
in the cost of a subscription to

216
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:09,470
list kit

217
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:11,300
into the

218
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:12,500
Pricing that you charge your

219
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,899
clients like let's say you sign a

220
00:06:13,899 --> 00:06:15,209
client and you charge them a

221
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:16,759
thousand dollars up front

222
00:06:17,189 --> 00:06:18,740
This

223
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:20,899
297 a month can be baked into that

224
00:06:20,899 --> 00:06:21,970
pricing that you charge your

225
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:22,259
client

226
00:06:22,269 --> 00:06:23,610
So they're the ones paying for

227
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:25,209
list kit and you get access to our

228
00:06:25,209 --> 00:06:26,689
tool so you can then go ahead and

229
00:06:26,689 --> 00:06:27,699
build a list of leads

230
00:06:28,069 --> 00:06:29,540
um

231
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:30,529
There's plenty of other tools out

232
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:31,540
there like if you look up

233
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:35,139
B2b databases

234
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,170
Best b2b data providers you will

235
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,730
get an entire list of other

236
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:40,740
companies that you can pull from

237
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:42,500
Obviously, you know

238
00:06:42,509 --> 00:06:43,920
I would love for you to use list

239
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,230
kit because we have the most

240
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:46,660
expertise with list kit and

241
00:06:47,029 --> 00:06:48,579
um

242
00:06:48,589 --> 00:06:49,930
We'll be able to give you the most

243
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:51,410
amount of support because it's our

244
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:51,699
tool

245
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:53,339
If you go to another tool for

246
00:06:53,339 --> 00:06:54,610
their data not going to take it

247
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:55,129
personally

248
00:06:55,509 --> 00:06:55,939
um

249
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:58,579
You know feel free to pull data

250
00:06:58,579 --> 00:06:59,699
from wherever you want if you want

251
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:01,240
to go to linkedin and pull people

252
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,660
one by one you can also do that

253
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:02,980
but

254
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:05,139
um

255
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:06,560
Like if you literally wanted to

256
00:07:06,579 --> 00:07:08,420
pull this guy's email one by one

257
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:09,930
You can do that

258
00:07:09,949 --> 00:07:11,220
But with the volume that you're

259
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,550
going to be doing for yourself and

260
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:13,779
your clients you're going to want

261
00:07:13,779 --> 00:07:15,139
to use a tool like

262
00:07:15,509 --> 00:07:16,980
list kit

263
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:17,579
or

264
00:07:17,629 --> 00:07:19,220
a similar database tool to get a

265
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:20,339
list of leads so

266
00:07:20,709 --> 00:07:22,180
um

267
00:07:22,189 --> 00:07:23,670
Not to go super in depth

268
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:25,459
with everything but

269
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,350
What you're going to want to do is

270
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:28,279
get really good

271
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:30,240
At building a list from scratch

272
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,370
based on what industry the company

273
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:33,800
is in like let's say construction

274
00:07:35,009 --> 00:07:36,740
And then let's say you want

275
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:38,399
Contractor home builder

276
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:41,939
Home builder right

277
00:07:41,949 --> 00:07:43,810
You have to be able to come into a

278
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:45,509
tool like list kit and build the

279
00:07:45,509 --> 00:07:46,699
exact list of leads that your

280
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,620
client is looking for

281
00:07:47,629 --> 00:07:49,990
So for example, I have contractors

282
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:51,220
and home builders

283
00:07:51,589 --> 00:07:53,939
searched up in the us

284
00:07:53,949 --> 00:07:55,360
And then let's say your client

285
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,970
only wants to work with the owners

286
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,360
and founders you would have to

287
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,290
come in here and select

288
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:01,939
CEO owner founder

289
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:04,339
And get a list of leads that way

290
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:06,550
Right, so like just like writing

291
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:08,240
copy is a skill that you have to

292
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,620
master writing messaging

293
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,610
Building a list of leads is also

294
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:13,569
going to be a skill that you need

295
00:08:13,569 --> 00:08:14,180
to master

296
00:08:14,189 --> 00:08:15,810
So you get the right list for your

297
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:16,970
clients because the last thing you

298
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:18,339
want is to reach out to the wrong

299
00:08:18,339 --> 00:08:19,529
contacts for your clients

300
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:20,529
And have them be upset when

301
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:22,019
they're not getting in touch with

302
00:08:22,019 --> 00:08:23,149
the people that they want to get

303
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:24,180
in touch with so

304
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:26,069
That is how building a list of

305
00:08:26,069 --> 00:08:26,899
leads works

306
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:28,120
I'm going to drop a ton of

307
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,879
resources down below going over

308
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:31,500
the best practices when you use

309
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:31,910
list kit

310
00:08:32,788 --> 00:08:34,179
Um, but yeah guys at this point

311
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:35,538
you basically know how to

312
00:08:35,908 --> 00:08:37,798
Write a good cold email set it all

313
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:39,370
up in a sending tool like smart

314
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:40,658
lead or list kit

315
00:08:41,029 --> 00:08:43,129
um

316
00:08:43,149 --> 00:08:45,059
Get a good list of leads the last

317
00:08:45,059 --> 00:08:46,309
thing i'm going to wrap up with

318
00:08:46,309 --> 00:08:46,759
for now is

319
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:49,429
What how do you actually like get

320
00:08:49,429 --> 00:08:51,039
the technology behind a good cold

321
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:52,840
email campaign because you need to

322
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:53,210
set up

323
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:55,860
domains and inboxes

324
00:08:56,029 --> 00:08:58,019
For your campaigns and this is the

325
00:08:58,289 --> 00:08:59,889
Most labor-intensive part of the

326
00:08:59,889 --> 00:09:01,350
entire process, but i'm going to

327
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,269
show you how to do it in one sec

328
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:03,970
So let's get into that video and

329
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:04,980
then we'll wrap up
