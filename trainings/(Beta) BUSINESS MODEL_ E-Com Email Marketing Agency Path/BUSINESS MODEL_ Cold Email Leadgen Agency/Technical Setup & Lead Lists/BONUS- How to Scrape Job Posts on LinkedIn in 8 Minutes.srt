1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:01,010
What's going on guys?

2
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:02,279
In this video, I'm going to walk

3
00:00:02,279 --> 00:00:03,419
you through one of the many

4
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:04,330
playbooks that we

5
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:06,150
use at Leadbird to generate high

6
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:08,019
quality leads for our clients.

7
00:00:08,019 --> 00:00:09,490
My name is Nick Abraham.

8
00:00:09,529 --> 00:00:09,880
I'm the

9
00:00:10,029 --> 00:00:10,830
founder at Leadbird.

10
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:12,070
We generate leads for our clients

11
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:13,160
on a pay-per-lead basis.

12
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:14,560
And this is our

13
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:16,079
playbook called LinkedIn Jobs

14
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:16,800
Scraping.

15
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,379
So I'm going to walk you through

16
00:00:18,379 --> 00:00:19,399
how we use LinkedIn

17
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:21,440
Jobs to generate leads for our

18
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,219
clients.

19
00:00:22,219 --> 00:00:24,300
So this is super important if you

20
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,579
are a recruitment agency.

21
00:00:26,949 --> 00:00:28,579
So as a recruitment agency,

22
00:00:28,579 --> 00:00:29,980
specifically if you are

23
00:00:29,989 --> 00:00:32,460
specialized in certain job roles

24
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:32,929
that you can

25
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:35,270
fill, imagine finding all the open

26
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:37,200
job posts for that role and the

27
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,429
hiring manager that's involved

28
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:40,960
and their email address so that

29
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:42,560
you can run super targeted cold

30
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,820
outreach campaigns.

31
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:45,100
That's what I'm

32
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:46,219
going to walk you through in this

33
00:00:46,219 --> 00:00:46,560
video.

34
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,530
And you can do the same thing if

35
00:00:47,609 --> 00:00:48,539
you're a service-based

36
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,000
business, right?

37
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,969
A lot of times a business isn't

38
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:54,359
ready or needs a full-time hire.

39
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:55,520
And so if you're

40
00:00:55,609 --> 00:00:56,990
able to kind of come in and pitch

41
00:00:57,119 --> 00:00:58,590
your solution, your outsourced

42
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:00,210
solution that isn't, you know,

43
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,179
having them to, you know, have to

44
00:01:02,179 --> 00:01:03,969
pay a full-time salary, all the

45
00:01:03,969 --> 00:01:06,019
benefits and being able to manage

46
00:01:06,069 --> 00:01:08,159
to do all that in-house, like you

47
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:09,930
can really come in and be the

48
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,030
alternative solution to their

49
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:12,409
full-time

50
00:01:12,519 --> 00:01:12,790
hire.

51
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:13,909
And so that's kind of the two

52
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:15,269
strategies that I want to walk you

53
00:01:15,269 --> 00:01:16,469
through if you're a recruiter

54
00:01:16,549 --> 00:01:18,129
or if you're a service-based

55
00:01:18,129 --> 00:01:19,939
business on how to basically run

56
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,519
this LinkedIn Jobs playbook.

57
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,060
So the first thing you want to do

58
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:25,500
is open up LinkedIn Jobs.

59
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,840
And what you can do is just put in

60
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:29,090
a role that is, you know,

61
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:30,530
something that you can fill or

62
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:32,150
something that is related to what

63
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:32,709
you sell.

64
00:01:32,769 --> 00:01:34,510
So Leadbird, like I mentioned

65
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:36,260
earlier, we're a B2B Legion

66
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:36,879
agency.

67
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:38,700
We do what an SDR does, generate

68
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:39,099
leads,

69
00:01:39,379 --> 00:01:40,870
generate meetings for our clients,

70
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:41,379
right?

71
00:01:41,379 --> 00:01:42,959
So I can come in here and say,

72
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:44,319
hey, let me find all the open

73
00:01:44,379 --> 00:01:45,840
job posts for SDRs in the United

74
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,420
States.

75
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:48,040
And, you know, I want to see all

76
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,370
the ones that are in the past

77
00:01:49,469 --> 00:01:51,209
24 hours that are offering remote

78
00:01:51,209 --> 00:01:51,609
jobs.

79
00:01:51,609 --> 00:01:53,390
There's about 563 results.

80
00:01:53,489 --> 00:01:55,870
And you can see from this first

81
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,510
result, there's a hiring team

82
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:58,579
that's involved.

83
00:01:58,579 --> 00:02:00,430
Brandon Lewis is the direct person

84
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:01,439
that's responsible

85
00:02:01,569 --> 00:02:03,200
for hiring the SDR.

86
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,489
So let me show you how I would go

87
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:07,819
about running and getting his

88
00:02:07,819 --> 00:02:08,819
email address at

89
00:02:08,909 --> 00:02:09,240
scale.

90
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:10,719
The easiest way is this internal

91
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:12,360
tool that we actually built called

92
00:02:12,379 --> 00:02:14,560
Leadbird Recruiter.

93
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:16,080
If I could get back to the screen

94
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:17,580
right there, there we go.

95
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,409
If you go to leadbird.io slash

96
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:20,879
recruiter,

97
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:22,240
all you need to do is take this

98
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,800
search URL that you've composed

99
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,240
from using LinkedIn jobs,

100
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,620
put it into the scraper.

101
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,120
And now you're going to get an

102
00:02:28,129 --> 00:02:30,909
email back with a link to download

103
00:02:30,909 --> 00:02:31,520
the list

104
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:33,039
that you just, you just uploaded

105
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,629
or not uploaded, but requested to

106
00:02:34,629 --> 00:02:35,110
scrape.

107
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:36,210
It's going to come back

108
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:37,550
within five to 10 minutes.

109
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:38,669
And what we've seen from, you

110
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:39,919
know, running a lot of these

111
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:40,800
scrapes is that

112
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:43,020
20 to 30% of every search that you

113
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,409
have will have a direct hiring

114
00:02:44,409 --> 00:02:45,900
manager associated with the job

115
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:46,409
post.

116
00:02:46,409 --> 00:02:48,330
There are some posts on LinkedIn

117
00:02:48,409 --> 00:02:50,289
where there isn't a hiring team

118
00:02:50,289 --> 00:02:52,060
attached to the actual job

119
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:53,370
post, which is fine.

120
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:55,009
I'll show you how to find who is

121
00:02:55,009 --> 00:02:56,750
there and take a really educated

122
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:57,419
guest.

123
00:02:57,419 --> 00:02:58,069
But

124
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:00,050
basically, if the hiring manager

125
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:02,110
is not associated with the job

126
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:04,340
post, what you can do is kind of

127
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:04,590
make

128
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:05,610
assumptions, right?

129
00:03:05,629 --> 00:03:06,960
If the company is smaller, wants

130
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,629
50 headcount, it's typically going

131
00:03:08,629 --> 00:03:09,289
to be the owner,

132
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:10,939
founder, CEO that is directly

133
00:03:10,939 --> 00:03:13,289
responsible for the hiring, right?

134
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,580
And you know, if the company

135
00:03:14,669 --> 00:03:16,300
headcount is 50 plus, we like to

136
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,009
use ChatGDP.

137
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:18,300
So I'll literally come into

138
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,439
ChatGDP and say, hey,

139
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:20,960
at a tech company with over 50

140
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:22,689
plus employees, who is responsible

141
00:03:22,689 --> 00:03:23,710
for hiring the SDRs?

142
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:24,280
And they're

143
00:03:24,469 --> 00:03:25,500
going to kind of give me some

144
00:03:25,569 --> 00:03:25,900
roles.

145
00:03:25,979 --> 00:03:27,590
Sales managers, sales operation,

146
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:28,939
those are probably where I'd want

147
00:03:28,939 --> 00:03:29,050
to

148
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:29,710
start.

149
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,770
And since the CV that I get from

150
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:33,490
the email is going to have

151
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:36,430
everything from the actual job ID,

152
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:37,889
the job URL, the title that I'm

153
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:39,469
hiring for the job description,

154
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:41,189
the company name, I can kind of go

155
00:03:41,189 --> 00:03:41,409
in

156
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,729
and find these people.

157
00:03:42,729 --> 00:03:44,569
But more specifically, you'll see

158
00:03:44,569 --> 00:03:46,129
that this list has in total about

159
00:03:46,229 --> 00:03:47,319
75 results,

160
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,120
because it's very targeted, small

161
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,370
one that I wanted to do.

162
00:03:50,379 --> 00:03:52,009
You'll see that this has already

163
00:03:52,009 --> 00:03:52,710
about 25

164
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,509
people from that 75.

165
00:03:54,509 --> 00:03:56,599
So roughly about 33% of this

166
00:03:56,599 --> 00:03:58,469
search is there with a hiring

167
00:03:58,469 --> 00:03:59,780
manager, which I can

168
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,710
leverage to go find and do true

169
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:03,199
targeted outreach.

170
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:05,319
So two strategies whenever you do

171
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,500
have the actual

172
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:08,150
hiring manager is, you know, hit

173
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:09,060
them up on email.

174
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,370
So the best way to find their

175
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:11,840
email address is upload

176
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:13,580
your CSV that you get from us and

177
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:15,520
to find email or drop contact, and

178
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,279
they will get you their email

179
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:17,899
address.

180
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:19,870
You're seeing a 40 to 50% match

181
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,170
using find email, very

182
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:21,970
recommended.

183
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,620
Best in class when it comes to

184
00:04:23,899 --> 00:04:26,629
enrichment percentage, validation,

185
00:04:26,629 --> 00:04:27,589
and price.

186
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:29,850
And if you don't want to do cold

187
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:31,360
email campaigns,

188
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:33,139
I would recommend using the

189
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:35,259
profile URL of the hiring manager

190
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:36,620
that you'll get.

191
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,730
So you'll see in this post

192
00:04:39,019 --> 00:04:43,439
right here that we have the hiring

193
00:04:43,569 --> 00:04:45,339
manager's profile URL.

194
00:04:45,339 --> 00:04:46,740
And so you could run really

195
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,240
targeted campaigns via

196
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:49,670
media or expandee from link to

197
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:51,360
connector campaigns and saying,

198
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,029
hey, first name wanted to connect,

199
00:04:53,029 --> 00:04:53,740
saw your job post,

200
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:54,860
saw that you're the hiring manager

201
00:04:54,899 --> 00:04:55,939
for this, wanted to connect,

202
00:04:55,939 --> 00:04:56,740
whatever, right?

203
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:58,800
So that's kind of how you run the

204
00:04:59,139 --> 00:05:00,259
actual scraping of this and

205
00:05:00,259 --> 00:05:01,290
getting the data.

206
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:03,100
So now let's talk about the actual

207
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:05,060
cold email angles that you can use

208
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:05,980
to generate the leads.

209
00:05:06,029 --> 00:05:07,480
So if you're a recruitment agency,

210
00:05:07,579 --> 00:05:08,680
this is what I recommend.

211
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,709
This is some of the stuff and some

212
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:10,540
of the copy that we use

213
00:05:10,589 --> 00:05:11,920
for our clients, where it's simply

214
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,370
saying, hey, first name, saw that

215
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:15,209
you're the hiring manager for the

216
00:05:15,209 --> 00:05:16,370
SDR job role.

217
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:17,500
I can help you find qualified

218
00:05:17,569 --> 00:05:18,939
candidates that would be happy to

219
00:05:18,939 --> 00:05:20,519
send over some open CVs that we

220
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:21,660
have for SDRs

221
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:23,339
that make sense to connect, right?

222
00:05:23,339 --> 00:05:26,350
Very simple cold email campaign.

223
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:28,339
And it has high intent because it

224
00:05:28,339 --> 00:05:28,980
shows that you did

225
00:05:29,069 --> 00:05:30,970
some level of research by pulling

226
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:31,939
that data in.

227
00:05:31,939 --> 00:05:34,420
And then similarly, if you're a

228
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:35,720
service-based business, being able

229
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:35,920
to say,

230
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:37,439
hey, first name, I saw that you're

231
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:40,750
the hiring manager for SDRs at

232
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,879
Leadbird and wanted to reach out.

233
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:43,600
Have you considered?

234
00:05:43,649 --> 00:05:44,589
And then you want to pitch your

235
00:05:44,589 --> 00:05:45,519
alternative solution.

236
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:47,610
Have you considered using an

237
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:48,800
outsourced to manage an agency

238
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:49,920
that works on a performance basis?

239
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,560
Question mark.

240
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,980
Like imagine getting that email

241
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,120
and you're the hiring manager.

242
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:54,620
You're like, oh, you know, might

243
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,040
want to see what this is about.

244
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,560
And so those are two different

245
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,110
angles that I like to use

246
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:00,639
for the actual campaigns when we

247
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,730
have them running.

248
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,279
And then last but not least, just

249
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:04,949
want to kind of talk

250
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:06,370
about the different things that

251
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:07,389
we're going to do for this

252
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:08,639
internal tool that we're

253
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,120
releasing.

254
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,790
So our goal

255
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:12,250
in the next 30 days is to be able

256
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:13,550
to be able to provide more than a

257
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:14,959
thousand results per search.

258
00:06:15,009 --> 00:06:17,209
So similarly to SalesNav, LinkedIn

259
00:06:17,209 --> 00:06:18,740
Jobs does this thing where they

260
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:19,600
only show you a certain amount of

261
00:06:19,689 --> 00:06:20,480
results per page.

262
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,029
And they only show you in total a

263
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:24,290
thousand results and in general.

264
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:24,879
And so we're going

265
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:26,149
to scrape more than a thousand

266
00:06:26,149 --> 00:06:27,629
results per search coming soon.

267
00:06:27,629 --> 00:06:29,040
And then we're also going to just

268
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,279
go ahead

269
00:06:29,329 --> 00:06:30,769
and directly integrate with my

270
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:32,139
email to retrieve the hiring

271
00:06:32,139 --> 00:06:33,519
manager's email for you.

272
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:33,920
So you don't have

273
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:35,040
to run that process.

274
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,769
And then we're also going to build

275
00:06:36,769 --> 00:06:38,589
this super cool solution where you

276
00:06:38,589 --> 00:06:38,759
could

277
00:06:38,889 --> 00:06:40,870
get a recurring list sent to you

278
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:41,569
weekly.

279
00:06:41,569 --> 00:06:43,639
So let's say, you know, you're

280
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:45,540
filling in SDR job roles.

281
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:47,430
You could get a recurring list of

282
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:49,029
all the new job posts that are

283
00:06:49,029 --> 00:06:51,279
submitted every week on LinkedIn

284
00:06:51,329 --> 00:06:52,639
so that you could keep running

285
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,290
outreach, keep having that system

286
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:55,839
built out, keep seeing, you know,

287
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:57,259
what's coming out in the market

288
00:06:57,259 --> 00:06:58,449
and running campaigns.

289
00:06:58,449 --> 00:06:59,750
So that's, that's basically what

290
00:06:59,759 --> 00:06:59,839
we're

291
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,029
doing on the LinkedIn job scraping

292
00:07:02,029 --> 00:07:03,269
tool that we built,

293
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:04,970
Libra.io/recruiter.

294
00:07:05,009 --> 00:07:05,439
So yeah, that's,

295
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,560
that's basically the entire

296
00:07:06,579 --> 00:07:07,110
playbook.

297
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:08,639
Nothing too crazy, super simple,

298
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:09,600
short video,

299
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,959
just a very targeted way of kind

300
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:12,589
of, you know, standing out in the

301
00:07:12,589 --> 00:07:14,660
inbox from the typical cold email.

302
00:07:14,769 --> 00:07:16,620
So if you want us to do this on a

303
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:18,709
pay-per-lead basis and your, your,

304
00:07:18,709 --> 00:07:20,279
your business that's doing over

305
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,839
50K a month that wants to

306
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,329
outsource this out, hit us up, go

307
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:25,360
to Libra.io,

308
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:26,519
book a call with our team and we

309
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:27,790
can walk you through this and many

310
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:28,879
of the other playbooks

311
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:29,629
that we use.

312
00:07:29,629 --> 00:07:31,189
If you want to test this out and

313
00:07:31,189 --> 00:07:32,839
do this on your own, we built a

314
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:33,899
very cheap internal

315
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:35,470
solution that I kind of mentioned

316
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:37,379
in this video, Libra.io/recruiter.

317
00:07:37,379 --> 00:07:38,839
And you could go run this exact

318
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,079
campaign on your own.

319
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:41,639
So that's basically it for this

320
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:42,120
video.

321
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,750
If you liked this video, do me a

322
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:44,160
favor,

323
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:46,079
like, comment, and subscribe, and

324
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:47,600
we'll catch you on the next one.
