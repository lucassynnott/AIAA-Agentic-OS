1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:00,700
All right.

2
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:02,060
In this video, I'm going to go

3
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:03,919
over email account settings plus

4
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:05,480
deliverability KPIs,

5
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:07,480
deliverability checklist, and how

6
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:09,419
to troubleshoot deliverability on

7
00:00:09,539 --> 00:00:11,000
your cold email account.

8
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:11,230
So

9
00:00:11,349 --> 00:00:12,619
first I'm going to cover the

10
00:00:12,619 --> 00:00:13,099
setup.

11
00:00:13,099 --> 00:00:14,730
So first you're going to go inside

12
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:15,630
smart lead, you're

13
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:16,780
going to press email accounts, and

14
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:17,559
then here's where you can

15
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:18,399
configure settings.

16
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:18,879
If you go to

17
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,679
the email account section, you can

18
00:00:20,679 --> 00:00:22,120
bulk select it and do this.

19
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,899
So you select multiple people at a

20
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:24,269
time.

21
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:25,579
Like if you go here and you just

22
00:00:25,579 --> 00:00:26,940
select a bunch, you can do that

23
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:27,329
there.

24
00:00:27,329 --> 00:00:28,000
So let's talk

25
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:28,640
about settings.

26
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,600
First thing, when you set up an

27
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,579
email account, you're going to

28
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:31,160
want to go to the

29
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,259
general settings.

30
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:33,880
Also, I want to preface this and

31
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,549
say your exact settings depend on

32
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:36,359
the setup you're

33
00:00:36,439 --> 00:00:36,700
using.

34
00:00:36,869 --> 00:00:37,850
There are a lot of different ways

35
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:38,700
you can set up cold email

36
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:39,179
accounts.

37
00:00:39,179 --> 00:00:39,859
And so I'm giving you

38
00:00:40,109 --> 00:00:41,500
like a general setup.

39
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,359
I like to set up one inbox or two

40
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:45,000
inboxes per one domain.

41
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,240
And so this is what's

42
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,780
working again as of December 2024.

43
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:50,189
If you're using a different

44
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:52,350
provider, maybe like a mail reef,

45
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:52,500
a

46
00:00:52,609 --> 00:00:54,009
hyper tide, a who knows what

47
00:00:54,009 --> 00:00:55,590
you're using at this point.

48
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:57,090
And so if there's a different

49
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:57,500
setup,

50
00:00:57,609 --> 00:00:58,770
consult with the people that

51
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:00,039
obviously set up your stuff.

52
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:01,600
This is relevant to Google and

53
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:01,960
Microsoft

54
00:01:02,119 --> 00:01:03,630
setups where I set up one domain

55
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:05,040
and two email accounts.

56
00:01:05,049 --> 00:01:06,900
If you set up in a different way,

57
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,590
there's probably some wiggle room.

58
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:09,769
So I'm just giving some rough

59
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,379
general settings and also refer

60
00:01:11,459 --> 00:01:13,180
to the doc in this video for the

61
00:01:13,189 --> 00:01:14,769
most up-to-date stuff.

62
00:01:14,769 --> 00:01:16,719
So the exact setup depends or the

63
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:17,219
exact

64
00:01:17,329 --> 00:01:18,450
what's it called?

65
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:19,219
Settings.

66
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:20,069
Settings.

67
00:01:20,069 --> 00:01:21,579
Depends on the setup.

68
00:01:21,579 --> 00:01:24,170
So this is typical settings I

69
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:24,370
have.

70
00:01:24,859 --> 00:01:26,060
Minimum messages per day.

71
00:01:26,129 --> 00:01:27,859
It can be anywhere from, I say 15

72
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:29,019
is about an average.

73
00:01:29,019 --> 00:01:30,019
I like to start at 10

74
00:01:30,099 --> 00:01:31,780
and then like ramp up to like 15,

75
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:33,510
20, and up to 25 even in some

76
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:33,950
cases.

77
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:35,260
But let's just split the

78
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:36,450
difference and say 15.

79
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:37,530
I'm just trying to keep this

80
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:38,769
simple, but you can ramp it up.

81
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:39,760
Minimum time gap,

82
00:01:39,829 --> 00:01:40,950
at least 14 minutes.

83
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:42,560
I just did 15 arbitrarily in this

84
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,870
case because sometimes I just

85
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:44,569
press different

86
00:01:44,769 --> 00:01:46,230
numbers for different reasons.

87
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:47,530
But you want to have, I like to

88
00:01:47,659 --> 00:01:49,099
extend out the time gap between

89
00:01:49,099 --> 00:01:49,239
the

90
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,290
email sent.

91
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:51,769
Warmup settings.

92
00:01:51,769 --> 00:01:54,280
I like to have a 25 total amount

93
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,659
of warmup email sent, randomized

94
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:57,299
between

95
00:01:57,459 --> 00:01:58,579
15 and 25.

96
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,609
This email account was imported

97
00:02:00,609 --> 00:02:02,450
from a different lifetime.

98
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:04,159
So that's why this is disabled.

99
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,659
But typically you're going to want

100
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:06,969
to have a five email per day ramp

101
00:02:06,969 --> 00:02:08,479
up and then randomized between

102
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:09,860
15 and 25.

103
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:11,909
I like to set my warmup reply rate

104
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:12,849
to 50%.

105
00:02:12,849 --> 00:02:15,300
Now I have it set to 100% because

106
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,289
in reality,

107
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:17,780
what ends up happening is if you

108
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,379
check out the warmup email sent,

109
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:20,680
you can see I have it set to

110
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,680
100% and smart lead for whatever

111
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:24,620
reason only wants to reply to 10%

112
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:25,169
of them.

113
00:02:25,169 --> 00:02:27,099
So I just jack it up over

114
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:27,610
the top.

115
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:29,110
But I've seen, depending on the

116
00:02:29,189 --> 00:02:30,599
actual smart lead account that

117
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,500
you're using, sometimes I've seen

118
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:33,780
it respect it and I don't know why

119
00:02:33,849 --> 00:02:35,250
maybe my account is just tweaking

120
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:35,550
out.

121
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:36,759
So that's why I have it set to

122
00:02:37,259 --> 00:02:37,620
100.

123
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,629
But typically 50%, I'd like to

124
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:41,469
have the auto adjust a warmup

125
00:02:41,469 --> 00:02:42,900
sending ratio off.

126
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,379
And then the rest of

127
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:45,659
the stuff you can just leave blank

128
00:02:45,669 --> 00:02:46,919
or it doesn't really matter.

129
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:49,189
So those are the actual settings

130
00:02:49,289 --> 00:02:49,699
on

131
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:51,379
the email accounts typically.

132
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:52,879
And I say typically because it

133
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,509
depends on your setup and a lot of

134
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:54,740
other

135
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:55,319
factors.

136
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:56,740
If you are sending like a lot of

137
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,169
really, really high quality

138
00:02:58,199 --> 00:02:59,780
emails, you can probably ramp

139
00:02:59,889 --> 00:03:00,099
it up.

140
00:03:00,099 --> 00:03:01,300
If you're seeing good metrics, you

141
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,180
can probably ramp it up.

142
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,310
If you're sending really poor

143
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:03,770
emails

144
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:05,219
that get you reported as spam a

145
00:03:05,219 --> 00:03:06,930
lot, then you're actually going to

146
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:08,759
see, you know, terrible results,

147
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,099
even with these settings because

148
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:11,449
people were reporting to spam.

149
00:03:11,449 --> 00:03:12,699
So diving to the next level,

150
00:03:12,819 --> 00:03:14,289
what are the things you can do to

151
00:03:14,289 --> 00:03:15,860
make sure that your emails have

152
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:17,259
high deliverability?

153
00:03:17,259 --> 00:03:18,039
Here's a rough

154
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:18,560
checklist.

155
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,710
Number one, make sure you have a

156
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:20,879
relevant email and audience.

157
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,280
Like this is really the biggest

158
00:03:22,389 --> 00:03:24,020
factor in email deliverability is

159
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:25,460
your spam compliant rate.

160
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:27,039
So you could have all your stuff

161
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:27,560
on paper,

162
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,460
perfectly set up.

163
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:29,930
But if everyone's reporting your

164
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:31,340
emails to spam, you are going to

165
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:32,020
land spam.

166
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:32,270
You could

167
00:03:32,389 --> 00:03:33,830
have everything else set up

168
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:34,639
perfectly.

169
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:36,219
The spam report means a lot.

170
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:37,840
So if, like I said before,

171
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,599
you could send, if you're saying

172
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,400
super, super high quality messages

173
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,960
and everyone's replying to them

174
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:44,229
and you're seeing no issues at

175
00:03:44,229 --> 00:03:45,500
all, you can keep scaling your

176
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:47,060
email sent per day and you're not

177
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:48,000
going to see issues.

178
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,419
This is why, you know, people can

179
00:03:49,419 --> 00:03:50,580
send tons and tons of emails off

180
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:51,199
of, you know,

181
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:52,939
one domain and not see any issues.

182
00:03:52,939 --> 00:03:54,289
But when you're sending cold

183
00:03:54,289 --> 00:03:56,050
emails, typically some percentage

184
00:03:56,139 --> 00:03:56,240
of

185
00:03:56,349 --> 00:03:57,400
people are going to report your

186
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,560
emails to spam because they're

187
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,710
cold and some people just hate

188
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:00,180
cold emails.

189
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:01,400
So the best thing you can do is

190
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,650
have a relevant email, have a

191
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:04,139
relevant audience, make sure that

192
00:04:04,259 --> 00:04:05,449
the people you're sending the

193
00:04:05,449 --> 00:04:06,939
emails to actually are responding

194
00:04:06,939 --> 00:04:08,120
well to them generally.

195
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,500
And that's

196
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:10,780
going to do like the most of your

197
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,669
deliverability.

198
00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:13,000
But aside from that, plain text

199
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:13,430
emails.

200
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:13,900
So make

201
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,460
sure you don't have any links,

202
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:17,259
images, any garbage in your emails

203
00:04:17,259 --> 00:04:18,939
that could help increase the odds

204
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:19,100
of

205
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,310
your landing and spam.

206
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:21,819
Have open rate tracking turned

207
00:04:21,819 --> 00:04:22,160
off.

208
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,910
Have your bounce rate low, less

209
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,660
than 4%.

210
00:04:24,819 --> 00:04:25,339
4% is

211
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,290
kind of the high end.

212
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:27,600
You ideally want like less than

213
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:27,879
2%.

214
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:29,160
And then warm up your email

215
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:31,060
accounts for minimum of two weeks.

216
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:33,050
Those are the high level things

217
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:34,160
you should do.

218
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,439
Now, how to monitor

219
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:37,120
and make sure your deliverability

220
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,459
metrics are doing well.

221
00:04:38,459 --> 00:04:40,360
Your warmup score is not a be all

222
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:40,660
end all

223
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:41,860
metric, which you can see here in

224
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:42,990
the email accounts section.

225
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:44,160
You can see your reputation.

226
00:04:44,339 --> 00:04:45,050
It's not a

227
00:04:45,129 --> 00:04:46,319
be all end all metric, but it can

228
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:47,600
roughly equate to how your email

229
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,560
accounts are doing.

230
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:49,439
You want to see

231
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:50,639
95% plus on these.

232
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,129
Typically, if I see like lower

233
00:04:52,129 --> 00:04:53,850
scores than that, there's usually

234
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:54,600
an issue with

235
00:04:54,709 --> 00:04:55,410
deliverability.

236
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:56,600
Reply rates and campaigns.

237
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:58,100
I cover this in a different video.

238
00:04:58,279 --> 00:05:00,180
But if you're seeing less than 1%

239
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,250
replies on emails sent, there's

240
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,279
typically an issue.

241
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:03,699
Again, there's a lot of nuance

242
00:05:03,699 --> 00:05:04,139
here.

243
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:04,939
This is why we want to

244
00:05:05,019 --> 00:05:05,740
collect all these different

245
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:06,100
metrics.

246
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,250
And then placement tests.

247
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,250
These are really good.

248
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:09,420
So smartly include the smart

249
00:05:09,579 --> 00:05:10,180
delivery thing.

250
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:11,350
And so you can see, you can run

251
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:12,730
placement tests and see where your

252
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:13,519
emails are actually

253
00:05:13,629 --> 00:05:13,939
landing.

254
00:05:14,029 --> 00:05:15,199
Now, I don't care about personal,

255
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,379
so it doesn't really matter.

256
00:05:16,379 --> 00:05:17,339
But you can see on professional

257
00:05:17,449 --> 00:05:19,199
emails, 60% of the outlooks are

258
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:20,850
inboxing, 40% are in spam.

259
00:05:21,019 --> 00:05:22,579
And then the G suites, these are

260
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:23,699
inboxing really well.

261
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:25,009
And so you can take that at face

262
00:05:25,009 --> 00:05:25,439
value.

263
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:26,699
And if most of your emails are

264
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:27,220
landing

265
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,939
an inbox, that's awesome.

266
00:05:28,939 --> 00:05:30,089
Those are the KPIs.

267
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:32,000
Those are the checklist action

268
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,550
items.

269
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:33,290
Those are the

270
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:33,689
settings.

271
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:34,810
Now, if something's wrong.

272
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:35,839
So how do you actually fix this?

273
00:05:35,949 --> 00:05:36,800
If something's wrong,

274
00:05:37,589 --> 00:05:39,060
if something's wrong, you either

275
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,550
need to lower your sending volume

276
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:43,259
to compensate for your results

277
00:05:43,389 --> 00:05:43,959
going down.

278
00:05:44,029 --> 00:05:45,290
You need to send more warm-up

279
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:46,709
emails and less cold emails to

280
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:47,990
basically try and tell the

281
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:49,410
system, hey, most of my emails are

282
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:50,269
doing pretty well.

283
00:05:50,269 --> 00:05:51,509
That's what the point of warm-up

284
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,240
emails are,

285
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,800
is to get responses that signal to

286
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,110
providers like, hey, I'm not

287
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,720
reporting this guy's spam.

288
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,000
Get this guy in the inbox.

289
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:59,589
Or just set up new accounts, which

290
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,959
is what I like doing.

291
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,529
If you just set up

292
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:02,959
new accounts, it's the easiest way

293
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:03,769
to make sure that your

294
00:06:03,769 --> 00:06:05,079
deliverability is doing well.

295
00:06:05,259 --> 00:06:06,060
And so those

296
00:06:06,139 --> 00:06:07,449
are the two action items.

297
00:06:07,449 --> 00:06:08,870
So hopefully this is a quick

298
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,449
video, how to set up your email

299
00:06:10,449 --> 00:06:12,120
accounts, KPIs,

300
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:13,769
settings, all that type of stuff,

301
00:06:13,769 --> 00:06:15,370
deliverability stuff, and how to

302
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:16,600
troubleshoot issues.

303
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,019
So if you

304
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,269
have any questions, hop on one of

305
00:06:18,269 --> 00:06:19,339
my calls or shoot me a DM.
