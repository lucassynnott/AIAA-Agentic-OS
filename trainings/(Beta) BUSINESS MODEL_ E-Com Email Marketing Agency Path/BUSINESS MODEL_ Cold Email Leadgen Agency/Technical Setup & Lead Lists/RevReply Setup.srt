00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,910
ad bond in the center we are

00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:34,000
you'll be

20
00:00:34,039 --> 00:00:35,920
able to see that up front as well

21
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:38,000
with some light metrics at least

22
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,320

23
00:00:40,359 --> 00:00:42,409

26
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,570
second as well and how that works

27
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:50,509
let's go to go into edit manager

28
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:52,799
so i can at least show you a few

29
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,140
things here now when you come in

30
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,659
obviously naming it it's going to

31
00:00:57,659 --> 00:01:00,079
be defaulting to inbox manager one

32
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:01,750
inbox manager two and so on you

33
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:03,359
can feel free to customize it

34
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,120
however you see fit you see this

35
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:07,209
accordion view here all of these

36
00:01:07,209 --> 00:01:09,140
are fields that we will need in

37
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:11,120
order to activate that the most

38
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:11,359
amount

39
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,840
of time it will be spent under

40
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,510
profile configuration and we go

41
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:17,010
ahead and dive into that here now

42
00:01:17,109 --> 00:01:17,480
if you are

43
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,409
using a lead and you're using the

44
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:21,370
signature sound which looks like

45
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:23,120
this right and you want to leave

46
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:24,519
the name blank you could

47
00:01:24,519 --> 00:01:26,340
definitely do so you know i went

48
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,079
ahead and put my name as if i am

49
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:28,640
working for

50
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,260
zoom and my company url zoom.com

51
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:33,709
now this is a pretty cool feature

52
00:01:33,709 --> 00:01:36,000
that people love that we launched

53
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,170
very

54
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,989
recently is if once you put the

55
00:01:37,989 --> 00:01:39,840
domain in here click auto general

56
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:42,079
profile give that about 10 seconds

57
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:42,239
it's

58
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,700
going to search the web it's going

59
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:44,959
to search the site and pull up

60
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:46,959
whatever it can about zoom there's

61
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,140
an additional box as that loads up

62
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:49,239
there's additional box that's

63
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:50,230
going to be available for

64
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,980
yes are there any additional

65
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:53,840
insights about the company's

66
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:55,840
offering links whatever may be

67
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,359
pricing

68
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:58,489
details whatever may be feel free

69
00:01:58,579 --> 00:02:00,400
to engage with that if you like

70
00:02:00,409 --> 00:02:02,159
you are limited a thousand

71
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:02,519
characters

72
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:04,010
per each of these boxes trust me

73
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:05,560
that's more than enough we used to

74
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,280
have 500 and we almost used to

75
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:07,599
have

76
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,340
one box but people kept on asking

77
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:10,830
for more so we loaded up both

78
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,719
these with a thousand characters

79
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:14,229
some ideas for here what you could

80
00:02:14,379 --> 00:02:16,000
do just pretty much think of it as

81
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:18,639
a prompt for for the autoresponder

82
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,900
anything you wanted to keep in

83
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,360
mind right if there's information

84
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,479
to pour over here go ahead and put

85
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:22,800
that in

86
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,629
there if not i'm going to feel

87
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:26,719
free to tell anything else you'd

88
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:28,449
like to and if done that you just

89
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:28,639
keep

90
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,319
that off but some examples here

91
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:31,919
people like we have clients who

92
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:33,780
just hey don't use the word

93
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:34,560
synergy

94
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:36,469
right or sound like a millennial

95
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:38,120
or you know anytime you book a

96
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,830
meeting make sure to ask for the

97
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,159
mobile

98
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:41,979
number before you know when you

99
00:02:41,979 --> 00:02:43,719
send the last email any little

100
00:02:43,909 --> 00:02:45,280
details like that could be

101
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,000
important for

102
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:47,500
how you want to engage whether

103
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:49,310
it's about pricing or any specific

104
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:51,120
details about your offering make

105
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:51,139

106
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,710
go ahead and include that in there

107
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:54,300
next section is going to ask you

108
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,759
if there's any case studies

109
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,580
any videos any white papers any

110
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:59,330
ebooks whatever may be just go in

111
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:01,360
and put the description here what

112
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:01,520
it

113
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,599
is put the link here and that will

114
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,520
be able to read and pull that in

115
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,319
if the context deems to to reply

116
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,830
with that information now look

117
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:11,479
majority of the people here are

118
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:13,460
looking to book a meeting that is

119
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,530
the objective of most sales reps

120
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:17,610
and most inbox managers but there

121
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:19,169
are other cases where the

122
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:21,930
objective is to perhaps send them

123
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:24,460
to a landing page have them sign

124
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:27,039
up for an account or you know we

125
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:27,189
have

126
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,229
a client who like just does or

127
00:03:29,229 --> 00:03:31,599
manufactures door frames and just

128
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,719
works with contractors and so

129
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:34,000
their

130
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:35,479
objective is other and they put

131
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:37,009
please collect width length and

132
00:03:37,009 --> 00:03:38,400
height of door frame so they can

133
00:03:38,469 --> 00:03:38,800
just send

134
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,080
them a quote they don't even want

135
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,310
to talk to people right which is

136
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:43,360
perfectly fine but for the most

137
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,250
part people are gonna are gonna be

138
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,960
setting a schedule a meeting and

139
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,879
what that's gonna allow you to do

140
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:49,120
is

141
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:50,620
fill out all the other meeting

142
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:52,400
scheduling preferences now select

143
00:03:52,569 --> 00:03:54,240
your time zone obviously you want

144
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:54,389
to let

145
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:56,770
the autoresponder understand where

146
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,750
you are so he knows what times to

147
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:01,199
suggest as well as what time zone

148
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,460
you can go ahead and include

149
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:04,030
weekends or include weekends most

150
00:04:04,139 --> 00:04:05,520
people do exclude as you can

151
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,340
imagine but

152
00:04:06,439 --> 00:04:07,439
in the event you do want to

153
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:08,659
include weekends go ahead and

154
00:04:08,659 --> 00:04:11,199
remove that that is for when you

155
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:12,479
want to schedule

156
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,990
the other section here is going to

157
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:15,759
be meeting scheduling preferences

158
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:17,839
now you could see here

159
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:18,970
the question is would you like the

160
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:20,100
autoresponder to connect to your

161
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,399
calendars this is just available

162
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,949
days and times now you can go

163
00:04:23,069 --> 00:04:24,589
ahead and do so by clicking

164
00:04:24,589 --> 00:04:26,550
clicking on a connect to google

165
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:27,199

166
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,009
which will then have this pop-up

167
00:04:29,009 --> 00:04:30,800

00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,970
which that will have a different

170
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:37,220
pop-up for microsoft right so once

171
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:39,279
you connect those either one or

172
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,300

173
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,569
you want they will populate in

207
00:05:36,889 --> 00:05:38,800
other questions you'll ask is if

00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,199
you have

209
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,709
multiple calendars selected for

210
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:41,920
example let's just say i do

211
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,600
because like pablo here it's going

212
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,459
to ask you

213
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:45,970
which mailbox do you want to send

214
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,459
the calendar invite from in this

215
00:05:47,459 --> 00:05:48,800
case i'm going to go ahead and

216
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:50,060
keep it myself if you want to

217
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,329
include anybody else on the

218
00:05:51,329 --> 00:05:53,029
calendar invite that would be this

219
00:05:53,029 --> 00:05:53,389
section

220
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,389
here let's just say i want to

221
00:05:55,389 --> 00:05:57,769
include anybody else at this point

222
00:05:57,769 --> 00:05:59,759
then you go ahead and input it

223
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:00,160
there

224
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:02,600
click enter and that will populate

225
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,750
next question is would you like

226
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,680
the calendar booking sorry would

227
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:06,800
you

228
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:08,029
like the autoresponder to include

229
00:06:08,029 --> 00:06:09,180
a calendar booking link so if you

230
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,370
have a calendar or whatever it may

231
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:11,040

feel free to include that there

233
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:14,310
again the more the merit that

234
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:16,000
would be very helpful as now

235
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,079

236
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,980

237
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:19,860

238
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:21,439

239
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,949

00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:29,120
for any reason

327
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:31,399

label

331
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:38,190
redirect for example ours is this

332
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:40,480
so i'm going to go ahead and put

333
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:43,019
app.revor.com click sub once i put

334
00:08:43,029 --> 00:08:43,149
my

335
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,200
credentials and i'll be good to go

336
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,039
let's go ahead and go back to the

337
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:49,039
zoom account and continue with

338
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:49,279
that

339
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,659
example and go back into the

340
00:08:50,659 --> 00:08:52,460
mailbox settings that's where it's

341
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,889
at so right now i have my gmail

342
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:54,240
connected

343
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:55,620
because i want to show you guys

344
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:57,059
some examples of how that looks

345
00:08:57,179 --> 00:08:58,830
trigger activation controls this

346
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,279
is

347
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,309
probably where people usually get

348
00:09:01,309 --> 00:09:03,059
stuck this is a new thing right

349
00:09:03,059 --> 00:09:04,929
it's not like an outreach a sales

350
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,629
loft in apollo or any other

351
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:08,559
sequencing tool out there it is

352
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:10,720
completely new and this is what

353
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,110
you just need

354
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:13,440
to comprehend that this is where

355
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,009
the autoresponder will decide what

356
00:09:16,009 --> 00:09:18,000
to trigger on or what not to

357
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,399
trigger

358
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,629
on i say that because you notice

359
00:09:20,629 --> 00:09:22,919
here it says hashtag zoom with me

360
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:25,120
these are the trigger activation

361
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,730
controls so this is what the

362
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:30,659
autoresponder will look for in

363
00:09:30,669 --> 00:09:33,679
order to decide whether or not to

364
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:34,240
reply to

365
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:36,769
that specific email so this needs

366
00:09:36,769 --> 00:09:38,639
to be unique this is an and

367
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,659
statement not an or statement and

368
00:09:41,669 --> 00:09:42,159
it needs to

369
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,909
be in the first email so if it's

370
00:09:43,909 --> 00:09:45,440
in other emails it will still

371
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:47,509
catch and that would not be good

372
00:09:47,509 --> 00:09:47,809
though you

373
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:49,259
don't want to do that so you want

374
00:09:49,259 --> 00:09:50,570
to make sure it's in the first

375
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:51,919
email again this is an and

376
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:52,429
statement

377
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,590
i have here hashtag zoom with me

378
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:56,629
for example i will show you what

379
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:58,639
that looks like on my initial

380
00:09:58,639 --> 00:09:58,879
email

381
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:01,309
here in this example i'm selling

382
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:03,639
zoom here's a subject here is my

383
00:10:03,649 --> 00:10:05,830
verbiage but here is my little

384
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:06,799
trigger word

385
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,940
it's zoom with me partner now this

386
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:13,090
trigger word can be in the subject

387
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:16,159
line anywhere in the body or

388
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:16,559
anywhere in

389
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,549
the body or both it could be a

390
00:10:18,549 --> 00:10:20,909
subject line or body so just keep

391
00:10:20,909 --> 00:10:23,360
that in mind when you send this up

392
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:24,870
again it's an end statement some

393
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:26,419
popular stuff that i've seen

394
00:10:26,419 --> 00:10:27,970
people do and we do ourselves is

395
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:31,350
www-company-com hashtags as i

396
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:33,169
showed you here forward slash and

397
00:10:33,169 --> 00:10:34,879
forward slash company like that's

398
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:35,029
your

399
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,539
linkedin page right whatever may

400
00:10:36,539 --> 00:10:37,870
be those things can tend to work

401
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,440
pretty well because they don't

402
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:39,649
include

403
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:41,259
a domain it's a little different

404
00:10:41,389 --> 00:10:42,580
it's not consistent and

405
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:44,159
specifically unique very very much

406
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:45,279
to you in this case

407
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,779
let's say i have multiple people

408
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:48,480
running this campaign maybe i want

409
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,399
it to be triggered for ramsey

410
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,490
and i'm going to duplicate this

411
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:54,720
inbox manager and do another one

412
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,440
for john do another one for sam do

413
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,179
another one for mary and so on

414
00:10:59,179 --> 00:11:01,200
right and so i'll say mary zoom in

415
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,080
zoom with me zoom with me right

416
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,590
whoever maybe so that's how i

417
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:06,909
would manage it if you had

418
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:08,480
multiple inbox managers for

419
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:09,200
multiple different

420
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,639
people as well now after the

421
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:12,480
trigger activation controls you're

422
00:11:12,649 --> 00:11:14,159
going to get into additional

423
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,570
settings look at this as like more

424
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:16,840
advanced settings it's where

425
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,559
you'll be able to select your tone

426
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:20,149
exactly how you want it to engage

427
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:21,919
and additional settings that will

428
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:23,519
you know use more credit to be

429
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:25,000
honest with you right so how much

430
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,350
of that do you want to use and how

431
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:28,110
much more engagement do you want

432
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:30,120
is ultimately up to you obviously

433
00:11:30,129 --> 00:11:31,809
we like to maximize this we've

434
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:33,379
noticed a lot of success from

435
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:33,679
making

436
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,100
sure to do no thanks follow-ups

437
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,429
and so on and i'll show you what

438
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,559
that is all about inbox manager

439
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,889
tone pretty self-explanatory our

440
00:11:40,889 --> 00:11:42,830
default is professional and

441
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:45,279
standard length but my co-founder

442
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,269
picks laid back and brief so i

443
00:11:47,269 --> 00:11:49,409
don't think he's a brief type of

444
00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:51,399
guy either i think he's a more

445
00:11:51,429 --> 00:11:51,750
standard

446
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:54,470
type of guy but it's whatever your

447
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:56,899
heart desires all right so this

448
00:11:57,019 --> 00:11:59,440
section here is the no thanks

449
00:11:59,440 --> 00:11:59,809
section

450
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:01,929
so what we believe is like look

451
00:12:02,019 --> 00:12:04,360
somebody responded and took the

452
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:06,360
time to tell you not interested in

453
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:06,639
no

454
00:12:06,679 --> 00:12:08,009
thanks they took the time to do

455
00:12:08,009 --> 00:12:09,269
that have a little courtesy

456
00:12:09,269 --> 00:12:10,799
respond back to them and confirm

457
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:12,080
that hey

458
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,080
receive your no thanks appreciate

459
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,379
it and it's also a great

460
00:12:15,529 --> 00:12:17,340
opportunity to throw in some leave

461
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:17,679
behind

462
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,600
materials so what a great way to

463
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:21,620
go hey by the way here's some case

464
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:23,679

466
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:27,440
outbound campaigns are not for you

467
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,600

autoresponder will recognize that

476
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:43,750
sentiment and respond back

477
00:12:43,899 --> 00:12:45,809
accordingly now we've also added

478
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:47,750
some restrictions if you like some

479
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:47,889

it or one two three punch and

483
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:52,529
that's

484
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:54,399
it i want to take over right uh i

485
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,799
don't want it to go have a

486
00:12:55,799 --> 00:12:57,990
conversation going back and forth

487
00:12:57,990 --> 00:12:59,110
9 10 12 times

488
00:12:59,159 --> 00:13:00,330
whatever it may be i want to be

489
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:01,690
able to have control of that and i

490
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:03,440
want to get notification of it

491
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,820
absolutely you can connect slack

492
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,139
that'll get pushed forward or if

493
00:13:06,139 --> 00:13:07,440
you just have gmail connected

494
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:07,759
don't

495
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:09,759
get drafted and sitting in your

496
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:11,740
inbox or draft box but as you can

497
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:14,000
see we don't have that turned on

498
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,230
but

499
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:15,519
in the events you want to do that

500
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,789
you're more than welcome to

501
00:13:16,789 --> 00:13:18,850
follow-up settings this is also

502
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,120
something

503
00:13:19,159 --> 00:13:21,409
to point out in this that gets a

504
00:13:21,409 --> 00:13:23,519
little tricky is it will only

505
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,399
respond to the last email that rev

506
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,110
reply

507
00:13:27,159 --> 00:13:29,210
sent reason is let's just say rev

508
00:13:29,299 --> 00:13:31,519
replies engaging with a prospect

509
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:33,759
of yours and let's say it's done

510
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:35,190
through smart lead or whatever it

511
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:36,490
may be but all of a sudden you hop

512
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:38,720
in and start chatting well it's

513
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:40,230
gonna know why am i gonna follow

514
00:13:40,309 --> 00:13:41,720
up and see if i could get that

515
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,600
meeting booked if you know ramsey

516
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:43,679
or

517
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,480
somebody else had actually stepped

518
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,399
in so you know as you know 25 35

519
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:49,120
percent of your time is spent just

520
00:13:49,159 --> 00:13:50,789
trying to convert somebody to get

521
00:13:50,789 --> 00:13:52,350
a meeting so it is a good check of

522
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,080
time once even somebody engages

523
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,129
with you it doesn't mean the

524
00:13:55,129 --> 00:13:56,460
meeting is booked you're trying to

525
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,679
get continue pushing for that

526
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,490
lean on rev reply for that so one

527
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:01,250
two or three follow-up it will be

528
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:03,279
very context specific as well

529
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,139
and i'll pick that up so however

530
00:14:05,139 --> 00:14:06,879
many days apart you want them i

531
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,039
want one one day after the last

532
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,549
auto response two days after the

533
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,059
last auto response maybe i want

534
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:13,250
this to be and maybe i want to

535
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:13,440
wait a

536
00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:15,019
little bit and i want to space

537
00:14:15,019 --> 00:14:16,539
this out a little bit more one

538
00:14:16,539 --> 00:14:18,399
three five so day two technically

539
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:18,639
day

540
00:14:18,679 --> 00:14:20,730
five and day ten ultimately right

541
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,440
and day after the last auto

542
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:25,110
response um adaptive templates

543
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:25,440
think of

544
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,110
this as like something that would

545
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:28,720
you would give the auto responder

546
00:14:28,889 --> 00:14:30,480
with some some guidance like you

547
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:31,840
want to actually give it hey i

548
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,100
anybody that's a positive

549
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,879
sentiment any of these interested

550
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:35,279
information

551
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,259
requests being a request i want

552
00:14:37,259 --> 00:14:39,340
you to tell like hey you know what

553
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:42,159
i absolutely love to buy you a

554
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:42,809
guitar

555
00:14:42,919 --> 00:14:44,730
and sing you a song and tell you

556
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:46,879
more about your questions but

557
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:50,240
first let's put together a poem

558
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:50,409
right

559
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:51,970
whatever maybe you want to tell

560
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:53,289
this thing it will grab that

561
00:14:53,289 --> 00:14:54,879
whatever context you want to give

562
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:55,090
it

563
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,639
and whatever context it pulls in

564
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:57,909
from the email thread it will

565
00:14:57,909 --> 00:14:59,519
combine it and will adapt it

566
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:00,639
accordingly to

567
00:15:00,679 --> 00:15:02,149
the email so you could pick and

568
00:15:02,299 --> 00:15:03,879
choose however you'd like to see

569
00:15:03,889 --> 00:15:06,399
that fit and now for the finale

570
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,419
automatic sending options so you

571
00:15:08,419 --> 00:15:10,429
see here you have two options full

572
00:15:10,429 --> 00:15:12,240
auto right i'm going to go hey

573
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:13,940
let's just go ahead and run with

574
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:15,720
it no matter what i want rev reply

575
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,679
to respond to everything of every

576
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,590
category automatically if you

577
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:21,559
don't want that the other option

578
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:23,440
is custom and you'll have to

579
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,320
integrate slack

580
00:15:24,919 --> 00:15:26,389
so what slack allows you to do is

581
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:28,120
you could pick the sentiment and

582
00:15:28,129 --> 00:15:29,470
you can imagine positive

583
00:15:29,559 --> 00:15:30,750
is anything that's information

584
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,149
request being a request interested

585
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:34,080
follow-up is anybody that says hey

586
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,450
circle back with me a different

587
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:36,769
day and time not interested no

588
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,669
thanks not interested and all that

589
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,309
right so you can pick and choose

590
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,070
which one you want on automatic

591
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,759
which one you want manual review

592
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:43,840
and

593
00:15:43,879 --> 00:15:45,309
i'll show you how that looks in a

594
00:15:45,309 --> 00:15:46,789
second in this case i typically

595
00:15:46,789 --> 00:15:48,240
like to keep follow-up and not

596
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,240
interested no thanks all those

597
00:15:50,289 --> 00:15:52,120
full automatic i do not want to

598
00:15:52,149 --> 00:15:54,080
touch those out of sight out of

599
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:54,720
mind

600
00:15:54,919 --> 00:15:56,970
i completely trust rev reply on

601
00:15:57,059 --> 00:15:59,450
the sentiment analysis that's able

602
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:00,879
to pick up and just let

603
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:02,159
it do its thing i don't need to

604
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:03,629
spend time doing that but maybe i

605
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:04,960
want to review the positive

606
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:05,470
responses

607
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:06,470
just you know maybe in the

608
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:07,679
beginning i highly recommend it in

609
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,870
the beginning so you can see and

610
00:16:08,919 --> 00:16:10,309
feel confident with what we're

611
00:16:10,309 --> 00:16:11,710
able to do and you can edit it and

612
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,200
guide it a little bit more if you

613
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,620
need to and train it and i'll show

614
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:15,919
you how to do that in a second so

615
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:17,519
typically start out you know

616
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:18,799
i suggest starting out something

617
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:20,090
like this you can pick and choose

618
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:21,840
whichever slack channels you want

619
00:16:21,879 --> 00:16:23,019
most people have three different

620
00:16:23,019 --> 00:16:24,240
slack channels depending on which

621
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,110
one but some people actually

622
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,669
have one and all go into one

623
00:16:26,669 --> 00:16:28,330
channel we'll still able to be

624
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:30,320
distinguished you'll still be able

625
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:30,340
to

626
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,500
distinguish the difference between

627
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:34,330
which message is what so let's go

628
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:36,870
ahead and jump into how that looks

629
00:16:36,919 --> 00:16:38,779
all right so zoom here's an

630
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:40,669
example of one of the first

631
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:43,120
messages i had sent out and i will

632
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:43,399
show you

633
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,919
how it kind of ends up running

634
00:16:44,919 --> 00:16:46,679
through this what nine responses

635
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:48,320
back and forth to get to where

636
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:48,700
it's at

637
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,789
so in this example i shared with

638
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:52,559
you earlier that saying hey mark

639
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:53,870
trying to pitch on zoom

640
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,289
and here's a trigger word zoom

641
00:16:55,289 --> 00:16:56,340
with me partners so the

642
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:58,149
autoresponder said i'm sorry the

643
00:16:58,149 --> 00:16:58,960
the prospect

644
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,700
said how do you compare to google

645
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,429
meet it's free you're expensive

646
00:17:02,429 --> 00:17:04,400
autoresponder came back and said

647
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,900
mark great question while google

648
00:17:06,039 --> 00:17:07,940
me offers basic free service zoom

649
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:10,400
offers blah blah blah right in the

650
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:10,720
end

651
00:17:10,759 --> 00:17:12,390
we'll push it and say i'd love to

652
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:14,220
discuss this further and address

653
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:15,838
any specific needs you might have

654
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,119
here are a couple available slots

655
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,559
and i'll suggest both these times

656
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,430
if you're picking the time that

657
00:17:20,519 --> 00:17:22,359
works for you or suggest another

658
00:17:22,369 --> 00:17:23,759
time you could also use my

659
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:26,000
calendar booking link that you saw

660
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:26,130
in the

661
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,509
profile best ramsey mark goes eh

662
00:17:28,509 --> 00:17:30,950
no thank you no longer interested

663
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,039
so what happened is this turned

664
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:33,200
from

665
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,289
a positive sentiment to a negative

666
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:37,430
sentiment right so i went from yes

667
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:39,119
interested to no thanks not

668
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:39,519
interested

669
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,930
sent a no thank you email as you

670
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:43,970
can see here with customer success

671
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:46,400
stories and then shortly after

672
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,880
mark had a change of heart 10

673
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,230
minutes later after he saw the

674
00:17:49,339 --> 00:17:50,799
case studies and said actually

675
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:51,359
wait those

676
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,849
are some impressive case studies

677
00:17:52,849 --> 00:17:54,190
so i guess i am interested what's

678
00:17:54,299 --> 00:17:56,480
your cheapest plan autoresponder

679
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:56,500
is

680
00:17:56,599 --> 00:17:57,819
actually also able to handle that

681
00:17:57,819 --> 00:17:58,829
right like hey thank you for

682
00:17:58,829 --> 00:18:00,079
renewed interest it recognizes

683
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:00,400
went from

684
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,069
yes no yes no i'm glad you found

685
00:18:02,069 --> 00:18:03,910
the case studies impressive our

686
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:06,400
most affordable plan starts at 15

687
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,160
a month and if you probably saw

688
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,359
there's nothing actually mentioned

689
00:18:10,359 --> 00:18:13,519
here that says 15 a month pretty

690
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:15,890
magical isn't it so it's able to

691
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:18,559
pick up on previous learnings able

692
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:21,039
to pick up on anything online as

693
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:21,440
well

694
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,529
it will pick up on whatever it can

695
00:18:23,619 --> 00:18:26,839
to ensure the answer is as solid

696
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:28,640
as can be if you'd like to discuss

697
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,150
further or have any questions feel

698
00:18:30,269 --> 00:18:31,470
free to book a meeting via my

699
00:18:31,579 --> 00:18:33,779
calendar link and that goes to my

700
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:34,240
calendar

701
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:36,000
booking link right so mark comes

702
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,220
back says actually i'm only

703
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,829
interested if you give me 80

704
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:39,890
discount

705
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,009
and give me a love poem right now

706
00:18:42,009 --> 00:18:43,869
depending obviously on the

707
00:18:43,869 --> 00:18:46,240
sentiments that you pick you could

708
00:18:46,279 --> 00:18:48,990
actually you know because i put if

709
00:18:49,049 --> 00:18:51,380
you recall professional and

710
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,440
standard if i had more of

711
00:18:53,559 --> 00:18:55,539
enthusiastic or laid back perhaps

712
00:18:55,619 --> 00:18:57,630
you know the autoresponder might

713
00:18:57,630 --> 00:18:59,359
give him a little love poem

714
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,240
but instead i said while i can't

715
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,299
quite offer an 80 discount or

716
00:19:03,299 --> 00:19:04,619
write a love poem i appreciate

717
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:04,799
your

718
00:19:04,839 --> 00:19:06,589
interest in the sense of humor so

719
00:19:06,589 --> 00:19:08,400
it's talking about zoom it throws

720
00:19:08,509 --> 00:19:10,059
it one more time and it still

721
00:19:10,119 --> 00:19:11,460
pushes out to discuss how zoom can

722
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:12,750
be best for you here are a couple

723
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:13,680
available time slots

724
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,269
now if in the event just to show

725
00:19:16,269 --> 00:19:18,210
you an example you notice these

726
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,759
are hyperlinked that's because

727
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:21,269
i'm my calendar connected and it's

728
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:23,029
suggesting a calendar booking link

729
00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:24,349
because i have that provided

730
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,759
as well to the inbox manager but

731
00:19:26,759 --> 00:19:28,930
you see here are two options i

732
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:31,279
could definitely click on and what

733
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:31,349
will

734
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,450
happen is it will go to this page

735
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:35,099
and show you that you're

736
00:19:35,099 --> 00:19:37,680
confirming the calendar invite for

737
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,240
this day and

738
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:40,329
time now i could confirm it

739
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:43,069
through there or if i was mark i'd

740
00:19:43,069 --> 00:19:46,390
go hey sounds good let's put

741
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:47,359

742
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,430
this day has passed now at 12 30

743
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:52,829

746
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:57,990
going to recognize that and that's

747
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:59,359
automatically going to send that

748
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,690
calendar invite for 12 30 on

749
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:03,839

00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:05,599
this pop up thing is this is in

751
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:06,400
the past

752
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,910
so it's gonna tell hey mark sorry

753
00:20:08,059 --> 00:20:09,599

00:20:10,839 --> 00:20:12,630
so let's go show you how this

756
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,369
looks in slack now this is my

757
00:20:14,519 --> 00:20:16,559
dummy account here so i have a lot

758
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:16,640
of

759
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,529
tests going on so excuse the

760
00:20:18,529 --> 00:20:20,750
little mess that we've got going

761
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,720
on but as you could see once a

762
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,359
response

763
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,240
comes in and this is the sentiment

764
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,119
analysis here this is what you get

765
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:28,880
i'll show you that inbound email

766
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,720
it'll show you the rest of the

767
00:20:30,789 --> 00:20:32,410
email you could also see more tell

768
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:34,559
you it's a positive sentiment if

769
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:35,089
it's

770
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,630
not a positive sentiment it'll

771
00:20:36,779 --> 00:20:38,349
tell you it's a follow-up or if

772
00:20:38,349 --> 00:20:39,910
it's a no thanks for example

773
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,019
soft no it will that one's change

774
00:20:42,099 --> 00:20:44,509
one will tell you no thanks right

775
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:47,430
so it will happen as this pops up

776
00:20:47,559 --> 00:20:49,339
you also have ability to approve

777
00:20:49,349 --> 00:20:51,089
again remember this is a manual

778
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,779
scent you have ability to edit so

779
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:52,960
i could

780
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,319
go right in and go you know what

781
00:20:55,319 --> 00:20:57,869

00:20:57,869 --> 00:21:00,380

783
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:00,640

790
00:21:10,279 --> 00:21:12,640
here and click approve and it will

791
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,509
send automatically now if i wanted

792
00:21:14,519 --> 00:21:15,869
just to stop it all all of a

793
00:21:15,869 --> 00:21:17,779
sudden even though it's unmeaning

794
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:18,079
review

795
00:21:18,119 --> 00:21:19,099
i don't want it to go back and

796
00:21:19,099 --> 00:21:20,339
forth i don't want to generate any

797
00:21:20,339 --> 00:21:22,000
more responses i'll take over

798
00:21:22,039 --> 00:21:23,240
i can go ahead and click i'll take

799
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,460
over and what you'll see here is

800
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:25,569
let me show you a different

801
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,569
example this pop-up will happen

802
00:21:27,569 --> 00:21:29,599
i'll say stop thread and that will

803
00:21:29,609 --> 00:21:31,720
pop up now some other things

804
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:32,000
you'll

805
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:33,509
see as well is link to thread if

806
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,490
you are using white label for some

807
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:37,119
smart lead it will take you to

808
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:37,359
that

809
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,869
white label link that's the

810
00:21:39,019 --> 00:21:40,500
beautiful part you do have an

811
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,980
option to turn this off in the

812
00:21:42,119 --> 00:21:42,400
additional

813
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,640
settings and then you have ability

814
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,470
to thumbs up thumbs down it so

815
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:48,640
this is where the autoresponder

816
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,849
is going to get smarter so in this

817
00:21:50,849 --> 00:21:52,829
case let me show you one that i

818
00:21:52,829 --> 00:21:54,640
have yet to click on it will show

819
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,529
you a thumbs up a thumbs down and

820
00:21:56,529 --> 00:21:58,660
that will automatically train the

821
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:00,640
autoresponder as it goes

822
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,359
you need about 20 plus for it to

823
00:22:02,359 --> 00:22:03,880
really start getting more of an

824
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:05,250
expert and be a mirror of your

825
00:22:05,319 --> 00:22:07,589
voice so i highly recommend you do

826
00:22:07,589 --> 00:22:09,650
that if you like the message if

827
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:12,000
not edit it and then thumbs up

828
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:13,140
so that way it learns the

829
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:14,690
differences and what you've put

830
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:17,039
together so i hope this helps at

831
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:17,140
least

832
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,710
guide you through that and as you

833
00:22:18,859 --> 00:22:20,259
can see even from the follow-ups

834
00:22:20,259 --> 00:22:22,240
for example um it is intuitive

835
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:22,559
enough

836
00:22:22,599 --> 00:22:24,440
if somebody says hey i'm out this

837
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,029
not not i'm out right now i'm

838
00:22:26,029 --> 00:22:27,920

848

850
00:22:43,759 --> 00:22:44,000

let me know if there's any

854
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:49,259
specific

855
00:22:49,319 --> 00:22:51,660
daytime that works best for you

856
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:54,230
now this was sent yesterday guess

857
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:55,680
what not next week

858
00:22:56,519 --> 00:22:57,650
by the week after it's going to

859
00:22:57,650 --> 00:22:59,089
come back it's automatically going

860
00:22:59,089 --> 00:23:00,240
to send a follow-up

861
00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:01,750
now one thing i'll also share with

862
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:02,970
you guys about the sentiment

863
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:04,559
analysis that's pretty unique

864
00:23:04,599 --> 00:23:07,230
is our sentiment analysis actually

865
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:09,700
supersedes smart leads what i mean

866
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,200
by that is you know smart lead

867
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,269
does have the ever going issue of

868
00:23:13,269 --> 00:23:15,500
marking something out of office or

869
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:18,000
not having to be categorized so

870
00:23:18,039 --> 00:23:19,920
what our sentiment analysis will

871
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,779
do is it actually is able to pick

872
00:23:21,779 --> 00:23:23,349
those up and it's able to correct

873
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,450
the correct sentiment because we

874
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:27,609
use about four different four five

875
00:23:27,609 --> 00:23:29,200
different ai models to be

876
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,099
exact and they obviously all talk

877
00:23:31,099 --> 00:23:32,480
to each other and more of an

878
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:34,849
objective approach so it is far

879
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:35,200
more

880
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,710
accurate so therefore it will

881
00:23:36,859 --> 00:23:38,349
update it to the current center

882
00:23:38,349 --> 00:23:40,000
the correct sentiments and if

883
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:40,319
there's

884
00:23:40,359 --> 00:23:42,009
uncategorized it will put it in

885
00:23:42,009 --> 00:23:43,869
the right category for you as well

886
00:23:43,869 --> 00:23:45,680
so anyways that's the walkthrough

887
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:45,829
