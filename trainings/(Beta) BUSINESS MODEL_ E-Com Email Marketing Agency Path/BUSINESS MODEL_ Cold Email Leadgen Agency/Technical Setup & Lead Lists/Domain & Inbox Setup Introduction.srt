1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:01,500
All right, in this video, we're

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:02,720
going to be covering how you can

3
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:03,980
set up your cold email

4
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:04,440
campaigns.

5
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:05,860
I'm really just going to lay out a

6
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:07,339
quick roadmap here, showing you

7
00:00:07,339 --> 00:00:08,619
all the different steps you

8
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:09,140
need to take.

9
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:10,500
And in the other videos in this

10
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,119
training and throughout the client

11
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,640
ascension modules, you'll

12
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:14,740
see how to tangibly do all these

13
00:00:14,779 --> 00:00:15,199
things.

14
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:16,170
By first, want to lay out a

15
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:17,320
roadmap so you know what you're

16
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,010
getting into.

17
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:19,510
It looks a lot more complex than

18
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:20,460
it actually is.

19
00:00:20,469 --> 00:00:21,960
And once you see how things are

20
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,429
done, all you have to do is just

21
00:00:23,559 --> 00:00:24,859
click the buttons, go

22
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:25,539
step by step.

23
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:26,879
And if you have any questions, you

24
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:28,070
can reach out to me or one of your

25
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:29,140
student success coaches

26
00:00:29,149 --> 00:00:30,940
or any one of the other cold email

27
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:32,109
experts in here.

28
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:33,579
So first, I'm just going to do a

29
00:00:33,579 --> 00:00:34,890
quick roadmap to have it in a

30
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:36,380
little bit more digestible

31
00:00:36,689 --> 00:00:37,729
format of the things you need to

32
00:00:37,729 --> 00:00:39,179
do to actually get your campaigns

33
00:00:39,189 --> 00:00:40,060
up and running.

34
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:41,170
So the first thing you're going to

35
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,119
have to set up your tech.

36
00:00:42,369 --> 00:00:43,719
That's what a majority of these

37
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:45,280
kind of intro modules are.

38
00:00:45,289 --> 00:00:46,700
It's purchasing the domains.

39
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:48,060
You're going to go to a domain

40
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:49,679
registrar, Porkbun, GoDaddy,

41
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:50,619
Cloudflare.

42
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:51,689
They all kind of do the same

43
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:52,119
thing.

44
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:53,479
And you're going to purchase the

45
00:00:53,479 --> 00:00:54,729
actual domains you're going to

46
00:00:54,789 --> 00:00:56,039
host the email accounts on.

47
00:00:56,109 --> 00:00:57,369
From there, you're going to

48
00:00:57,369 --> 00:00:58,799
connect them to an admin panel,

49
00:00:58,799 --> 00:00:59,859
account, tenant.

50
00:00:59,869 --> 00:01:01,119
They all kind of mean the same

51
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:02,840
thing through Google or Microsoft.

52
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:04,319
And so you can host your email

53
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:05,849
accounts where you can actually

54
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:07,579
send and receive emails from.

55
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:09,159
We have trainings on how to do

56
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:10,060
both of them.

57
00:01:10,069 --> 00:01:11,680
I recommend if you want to have

58
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,159
the most safe and resilient

59
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:14,799
solution, you do a little bit

60
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:15,299
on both.

61
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:16,510
You can set up 10 inboxes on

62
00:01:16,519 --> 00:01:18,120
Google, 10 inboxes on Microsoft,

63
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:20,079
or 20 on Google, 20 on Microsoft.

64
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:21,239
It doesn't really matter.

65
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:22,840
Or you can do it all on one or the

66
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,430
other.

67
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:24,349
If you want an exact

68
00:01:24,349 --> 00:01:26,040
recommendation, I would just say

69
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,560
do 50-50 on both.

70
00:01:27,569 --> 00:01:29,269
But you can do all on one, all on

71
00:01:29,269 --> 00:01:31,260
the other, or a split of both.

72
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,700
Then you're going to add your

73
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,230
records to the DNS settings.

74
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:36,200
So your records, it's just like

75
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,900
the backend settings for the

76
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:38,959
domain stuff.

77
00:01:38,969 --> 00:01:40,519
It's a lot of copying and pasting.

78
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:41,709
I'll walk you through and show you

79
00:01:41,709 --> 00:01:42,329
how to do that.

80
00:01:42,349 --> 00:01:43,439
Then you're going to create the

81
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,500
inboxes, a couple clicks of a

82
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:44,939
button.

83
00:01:44,969 --> 00:01:46,040
You're going to connect it to

84
00:01:46,099 --> 00:01:47,010
SmartLeads so that you can

85
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:48,359
actually start sending the emails,

86
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:49,810
receiving the emails, and using

87
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:50,980
the automations there.

88
00:01:50,989 --> 00:01:52,329
Then you're going to scrape your

89
00:01:52,329 --> 00:01:53,829
leads, write your emails, launch

90
00:01:53,829 --> 00:01:55,400
campaigns, and book meetings.

91
00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:56,840
And there's plenty of modules and

92
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,010
plenty of trainings on all of

93
00:01:58,069 --> 00:01:58,540
that.

94
00:01:58,549 --> 00:02:00,040
So that's basically the high-level

95
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:00,549
roadmap.

96
00:02:00,569 --> 00:02:02,260
It's a lot more digestible when

97
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:03,769
you just see it in this quick

98
00:02:03,769 --> 00:02:05,640
nine-step bullet point section

99
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:05,900
here.

100
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:07,140
And so all the videos are going to

101
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:07,709
cover this.

102
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:09,280
I'd highly, highly, highly

103
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,949
recommend watch through all the

104
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:12,599
videos the first time over.

105
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:13,849
Just take notes, digest it a

106
00:02:13,849 --> 00:02:14,539
little bit.

107
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:15,879
And then whenever you go back to

108
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:17,319
actually execute on it, then you

109
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:18,300
can go back and start

110
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:20,300
to pause, replay, do the things in

111
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:22,189
the videos, just so you can have a

112
00:02:22,189 --> 00:02:23,840
digest, or you can digest

113
00:02:23,889 --> 00:02:25,039
the content and have a little bit

114
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:25,689
of a feel for it.

115
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,199
So those are all the steps.

116
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:28,689
I'm going to have a training here

117
00:02:28,689 --> 00:02:29,810
on how to set up the Google

118
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:30,580
accounts.

119
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:31,879
Andre already has a training on

120
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:32,979
how to set up the Microsoft

121
00:02:32,979 --> 00:02:33,560
accounts.

122
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:35,199
And then, yeah, if you have any

123
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:36,810
questions, feel free to let me or

124
00:02:36,889 --> 00:02:38,199
any one of the other student

125
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:39,469
success coaches or cold email

126
00:02:39,469 --> 00:02:40,210
coaches know.

127
00:02:40,229 --> 00:02:41,759
So appreciate you guys a ton and

128
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:43,199
excited to get you some help on

129
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:44,479
getting these cold email

130
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:45,280
campaigns launched.
