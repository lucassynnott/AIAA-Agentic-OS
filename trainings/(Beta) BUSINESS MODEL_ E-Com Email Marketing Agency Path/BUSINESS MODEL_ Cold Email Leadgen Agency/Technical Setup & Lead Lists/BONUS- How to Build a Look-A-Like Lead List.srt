1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:01,060
What's going on guys in this video

2
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:02,100
i'm going to walk you through how

3
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:03,410
you can build a list of

4
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:05,410
lookalike domains for your lead

5
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:07,309
list so that you can build super

6
00:00:07,309 --> 00:00:10,000
targeted just like you can inside

7
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:12,699
of tools like ocean.io and so this

8
00:00:12,699 --> 00:00:15,130
is very very very important when

9
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:17,059
you're trying to build lead

10
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:18,469
lists for clients that need that

11
00:00:18,469 --> 00:00:19,920
sniper precision and the keywords

12
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,440
that you're applying inside of

13
00:00:21,489 --> 00:00:23,019
sales nav or inside of apollo just

14
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:24,579
aren't cutting it so let's kind of

15
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:26,210
back up real quick what is a

16
00:00:26,289 --> 00:00:28,030
lookalike lead list so if i put in

17
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:30,109
leadbird.io the output is going to

18
00:00:30,109 --> 00:00:32,079
be a list of domains that are

19
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:33,890
similar to lead bird and lead bird

20
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:35,679
is a b2b region agency so i would

21
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:37,590
get an output of domains or pp

22
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:39,340
region agencies and so there's two

23
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:40,740
ways of grabbing it you can use

24
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:42,210
the pioneer in the space that

25
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:42,369
built

26
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:43,780
this kind of technology and use

27
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:45,179
case which is ocean.io they're

28
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:46,479
more of an enterprise solution

29
00:00:46,609 --> 00:00:47,700
so they are a little bit more

30
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,109
expensive they have annual plans i

31
00:00:49,109 --> 00:00:50,960
think that start in that 12 to 16

32
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:52,710
thousand dollar range we use them

33
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:54,460
very early on and they're amazing

34
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:55,729
but they are a little bit more

35
00:00:55,969 --> 00:00:57,219
on the expensive side so if you're

36
00:00:57,219 --> 00:00:58,380
more of a startup then there's

37
00:00:58,380 --> 00:00:59,679
another tool on the market called

38
00:00:59,729 --> 00:01:01,829
export list io they basically will

39
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,689
get you almost the same results

40
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:06,159
that ocean will do for 75 dollars

41
00:01:06,209 --> 00:01:07,730
per search so you can try to you

42
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:09,099
know test this out use it as

43
00:01:09,099 --> 00:01:10,719
needed and not really worry about

44
00:01:10,769 --> 00:01:12,430
paying like an enterprise solution

45
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:13,859
like ocean and so that's a pretty

46
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:15,489
good tool to go through and then

47
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:16,950
when it comes to finding and

48
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:18,510
getting like really good results

49
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:20,079
whether you use ocean or export

50
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:20,450
list

51
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:22,920
is you need to identify a domain

52
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,250
for like your ideal icp that is

53
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:27,359
rich with keywords so what i mean

54
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:27,519
by

55
00:01:27,569 --> 00:01:29,400
that i mean that the website isn't

56
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,209
just like a one pager with barely

57
00:01:31,209 --> 00:01:32,799
any keywords and maybe doesn't

58
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:32,879
have

59
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:34,299
any traffic behind it like what

60
00:01:34,299 --> 00:01:35,959
they're doing is they're basically

61
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:37,599
scraping the website identifying

62
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:39,170
keywords and then going and trying

63
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:40,439
to find other websites with

64
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:42,000
similar keywords and so you need

65
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,319
to find

66
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:43,510
something that you know talks a

67
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:44,750
lot about the process talks a lot

68
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,349
about like b2b legion or whatever

69
00:01:46,569 --> 00:01:47,090
it may be

70
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:48,680
that identifies you know that

71
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,439
specific website and so let's kind

72
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:52,560
of walk through the entire process

73
00:01:52,609 --> 00:01:54,709
so this is export list.io you can

74
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:56,560
just go to the ai lookalike and

75
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,299
then we could put in just a name

76
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:58,480
for

77
00:01:58,530 --> 00:01:59,900
this order so i'm just gonna call

78
00:01:59,989 --> 00:02:01,180
it testing and then let's do

79
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:03,200
leaper.io so if i once i input

80
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:03,359
that i

81
00:02:03,489 --> 00:02:05,370
just submit the order and then i

82
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:07,370
can go into orders and you'll see

83
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:09,280
that i have this right here and

84
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:09,439
i'm

85
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:10,860
just going to open it up so i

86
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:12,569
already downloaded it and in the

87
00:02:12,669 --> 00:02:14,560
csv there is tons of information

88
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,180
in it but

89
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:17,349
the main thing that we are looking

90
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:19,539
for is just the domains and to see

91
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:21,120
how accurate this is we can kind

92
00:02:21,169 --> 00:02:22,689
of just start opening up a couple

93
00:02:22,689 --> 00:02:24,250
of the domains to kind of see what

94
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,680
it looks like so i inputted

95
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:27,400
leaper.io bbgen agency and so

96
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,939
everything in here should be sales

97
00:02:28,939 --> 00:02:30,400
and leads orientated and you can

98
00:02:30,449 --> 00:02:31,819
see that this says is your sales

99
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:33,289
cycle yawn and lacks the mojo so

100
00:02:33,289 --> 00:02:35,169
that makes sense but it caused me

101
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,930
books 25 to 30 meetings in a day

102
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:38,340
and let's just kind of keep going

103
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,520
down to see if we can find

104
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:39,840
something

105
00:02:39,889 --> 00:02:41,710
else conversion calls so this is a

106
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:43,469
call center so bbbgen at the same

107
00:02:43,509 --> 00:02:45,120
time so you can see that the

108
00:02:45,169 --> 00:02:46,990
ai lookalike does pretty good

109
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:49,000
results but now we need to go from

110
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,150
list of domains to actual people

111
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:52,990
and then to emails so if i copy

112
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:54,770
the list of domains i can head

113
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:56,879
into apollo and then click uh

114
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:57,240
company

115
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:59,020
include list of companies and then

116
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:00,449
paste this in there and click save

117
00:03:00,449 --> 00:03:01,590
and search and now what we're

118
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:03,280
telling apollo is like okay hey

119
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,159
everyone inside of these websites

120
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:06,800
i need to go find the people that

121
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,039
work

122
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:08,969
there so this is the 2500 people

123
00:03:08,969 --> 00:03:10,360
that work at all of the domains

124
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,810
that we have in here and i believe

125
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:14,300
we were able to get a total of

126
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:17,310
1145 and now i can apply the

127
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:19,680
filters to go find my icp so let's

128
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:19,909
go

129
00:03:19,969 --> 00:03:21,340
ahead and say you know we just

130
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:22,919
want the owner the founder and

131
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:24,639
c-suite let's just say that's the

132
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:25,120
icp

133
00:03:25,169 --> 00:03:26,719
that we want what i can do then is

134
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:28,259
just copy this search url come

135
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:29,949
back and export and then i can put

136
00:03:30,129 --> 00:03:31,639
this here and so this has a total

137
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:33,810
of about 1100 contacts so i'm just

138
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:36,110
going to order 2000 and then call

139
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:38,000
this linkedin testing and then

140
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,889
order this and now they're going

141
00:03:39,889 --> 00:03:42,000
to actually go ahead and pull

142
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:43,699
the emails from the contacts that

143
00:03:43,699 --> 00:03:45,479
are right here almost immediately

144
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:46,770
right that's i think a better

145
00:03:47,009 --> 00:03:48,979
pricing than what apollo gives and

146
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:50,879
so that's how we go from building

147
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,560
the lookalike and then being able

148
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:54,250
to actually find the emails of the

149
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:55,689
people we want to hit and then

150
00:03:55,689 --> 00:03:57,280
when it comes to actually writing

151
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:57,330
the

152
00:03:57,409 --> 00:03:59,129
cold email campaign since we have

153
00:03:59,129 --> 00:04:00,889
a hyper specific lead list we want

154
00:04:00,889 --> 00:04:02,400
to get hyper specific with the

155
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:02,719
call

156
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:04,030
out of the lead list so you know

157
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:05,490
if i'm running a campaign to b2b

158
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:06,750
agent agencies i need to be able

159
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:08,180
to say hey first name we've been

160
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,449
working with other b2b agent

161
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,870
agencies i wouldn't just say hey

162
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:11,439
we're

163
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:12,830
working with other agencies so

164
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:14,009
that's the benefit and then

165
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,469
whenever you're able to get hyper

166
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:16,209
specific

167
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:17,879
with the outreach like that you

168
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:19,560
typically have a higher response

169
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,040
rate just because it doesn't look

170
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:22,720
like it's a mass blast like some

171
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,170
of our other campaigns do so

172
00:04:24,269 --> 00:04:25,759
that's how you go from start to

173
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:26,990
to finish on how to build a

174
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:28,540
lookalike legalist and then

175
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,060
building a campaign around it.
