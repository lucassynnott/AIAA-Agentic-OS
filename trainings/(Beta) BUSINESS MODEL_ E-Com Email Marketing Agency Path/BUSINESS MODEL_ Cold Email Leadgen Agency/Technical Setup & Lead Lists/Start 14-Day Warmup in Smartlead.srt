1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,040
What's going on guys, in this

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,540
video, we're going to finish off

3
00:00:03,649 --> 00:00:04,980
the deliverability section

4
00:00:05,019 --> 00:00:06,750
of the cold email setup guide

5
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:09,410
updated for 2023 and SmartLead by

6
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:11,380
starting the warmup process

7
00:00:11,419 --> 00:00:13,400
in SmartLead for each of the new

8
00:00:13,539 --> 00:00:15,859
email accounts we've now connected

9
00:00:15,859 --> 00:00:18,079
to our new SmartLead account.

10
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,000
And so right within SmartLead in

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,969
the email account section, you

12
00:00:21,969 --> 00:00:23,160
should have 10 email

13
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,039
accounts added here and you're

14
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:26,989
going to go into each individual

15
00:00:26,989 --> 00:00:28,739
one, take note of what

16
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:30,649
the domain or email account it is,

17
00:00:30,649 --> 00:00:32,170
and you're going to start in

18
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:32,899
general.

19
00:00:32,939 --> 00:00:34,429
The first thing we want to do is

20
00:00:34,429 --> 00:00:36,280
set up a custom tracking domain.

21
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:38,890
And so turn this on and then we're

22
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:40,869
going to have to go back to

23
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,869
domains.google, back to

24
00:00:43,939 --> 00:00:45,200
the registrar, and then we're

25
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,250
going to have to go to this

26
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:47,109
specific domain.

27
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,020
So this is clientascend.com right

28
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:49,479
here.

29
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,850
We're going to go back into

30
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:51,479
manage.

31
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,219
We're going to go into DNS and

32
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:55,259
then we're going to manage custom

33
00:00:55,259 --> 00:00:56,960
records and we're going to

34
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,990
create a new record after DMARC.

35
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,600
And the value here is just the

36
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,209
host is email tracking, just

37
00:01:04,209 --> 00:01:05,299
spelled that way.

38
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:07,819
The type is going to be CNAME.

39
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:09,319
This can stay the same.

40
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:10,959
And then the domain name is

41
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:14,739
open.sleadtrack.com.

42
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:17,180
So email tracking, CNAME, this

43
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:18,390
stays the same,

44
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,819
open.sleadtrack.com.

45
00:01:20,859 --> 00:01:22,420
You're going to save that.

46
00:01:22,459 --> 00:01:24,329
So it should show up exactly like

47
00:01:24,329 --> 00:01:25,170
you see here.

48
00:01:25,349 --> 00:01:27,769
And then back in Smart Lead, the

49
00:01:27,769 --> 00:01:30,120
way you're going to set this up is

50
00:01:30,219 --> 00:01:31,890
like it says here.

51
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:34,739
Or where does it say?

52
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:38,140
So it's basically just going to be

53
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:41,769
HTTP, right, like this, slash,

54
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:44,939
slash, and then email tracking

55
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:47,359
dot.

56
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,760
And then it's going to be your

57
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,280
domain.

58
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:52,379
So clientascend.com like this.

59
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,370
And then you can verify CNAME.

60
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,420
And then it should be verified

61
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:57,629
successfully.

62
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,280
Okay.

63
00:01:58,319 --> 00:01:59,480
And then click save in the bottom

64
00:01:59,480 --> 00:01:59,859
right.

65
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:02,239
And it'll be saved successfully.

66
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,370
And you could go off the email

67
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:04,709
account and back into the general

68
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:05,329
settings.

69
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:10,740
Let's see if it wants to load.

70
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:13,770
I think we might have crashed the

71
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:14,819
system.

72
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:15,740
No, we're good.

73
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:17,750
So go into general settings and

74
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,460
this should show up this way.

75
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,479
So HTTP, dash, dash, email

76
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,830
tracking, and then the domain

77
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:26,819
name, dot, the domain name, right?

78
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,669
So that's all set up exactly like

79
00:02:28,669 --> 00:02:29,610
we just showed.

80
00:02:29,939 --> 00:02:32,050
And then now for the actual

81
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:34,349
warmup, first, we want to actually

82
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,259
enable warmup in the bottom right.

83
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:37,400
Okay.

84
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:39,050
And then, so this should be

85
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:39,879
enabled.

86
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:41,270
And then the total number of

87
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,860
warmup emails per day should be

88
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:43,500
40.

89
00:02:44,219 --> 00:02:46,539
The ramp up should be four.

90
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,830
And then the randomized number

91
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:52,500
should be 25 to 40.

92
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:54,520
And then the reply rate should be

93
00:02:54,659 --> 00:02:55,240
45.

94
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:56,740
Okay.

95
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,719
Everything else can say the same.

96
00:02:58,759 --> 00:03:01,129
And then we can enable auto adjust

97
00:03:01,129 --> 00:03:03,270
warmup setting ratio and then

98
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:04,099
update.

99
00:03:04,139 --> 00:03:06,099
So these are the warmup settings.

100
00:03:06,139 --> 00:03:07,009
It should be enabled.

101
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:08,599
This number should be 40.

102
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:10,139
Ramp up should be four.

103
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,539
Randomizer should be 25 to 40.

104
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,199
Reply rate percentage should be

105
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:14,629
45.

106
00:03:14,979 --> 00:03:16,460
This can stay the same.

107
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,479
And then this should be toggled on

108
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:19,669
and enabled.

109
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:20,919
And that's it.

110
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,939
So you want to just go back to all

111
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,319
the email accounts and that should

112
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:26,879
be enabled for each of them.

113
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:28,409
So when it says warmup enabled,

114
00:03:28,409 --> 00:03:29,819
all of them should say yes.

115
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,150
And we're going to leave that on

116
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:33,389
for 14 days.

117
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:35,000
So from the moment you complete

118
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,719
this step, which brings us to the

119
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:38,629
end of the deliverability section,

120
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:40,879
you're going to be able to launch

121
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:43,669
your campaign 14 days from today.

122
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:45,419
So that gives you 14 days to go

123
00:03:45,419 --> 00:03:47,150
and complete the targeting and the

124
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,360
messaging sections of the program.

125
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,009
It also gives you 14 days to do

126
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,830
your landing page and your VSL.

127
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:54,900
And so make sure to use these 14

128
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:56,939
days very strategically so you're

129
00:03:56,939 --> 00:03:58,379
not wasting any time.

130
00:03:58,419 --> 00:04:00,219
On day 14, you want to come in

131
00:04:00,219 --> 00:04:02,129
here, follow the rest of the steps

132
00:04:02,129 --> 00:04:04,039
in the launch campaign videos,

133
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:05,229
which are at the end of this

134
00:04:05,229 --> 00:04:06,530
section after targeting and

135
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:08,240
messaging, which we'll do next.

136
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:09,889
And follow those steps to actually

137
00:04:09,889 --> 00:04:10,680
launch campaigns.

138
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:12,150
But for now, where you should be

139
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:13,680
at is you should have all 10 of

140
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,889
your new domains and email

141
00:04:14,889 --> 00:04:16,389
accounts registered via Google

142
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:17,079
domains.

143
00:04:17,139 --> 00:04:18,420
You should have your smart lead

144
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,120
account set up.

145
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,610
You should have all your email

146
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:22,170
accounts connected in your smart

147
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:23,019
lead account.

148
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,949
And you should have the warmup

149
00:04:24,949 --> 00:04:27,040
process enabled for each of your

150
00:04:27,069 --> 00:04:29,069
email accounts with the custom

151
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:31,240
tracking domain set up with these

152
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,000
settings.

153
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,439
40 is the total number with a wrap

154
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:36,379
up of four, with the randomization

155
00:04:36,379 --> 00:04:38,579
of 25 to 40, with the reply rate

156
00:04:38,629 --> 00:04:40,899
of 45% with this setting enabled.

157
00:04:40,939 --> 00:04:42,310
And from there, we're going to be

158
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:43,629
able to jump into the targeting

159
00:04:43,629 --> 00:04:44,699
section next and then the

160
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:45,720
messaging section.

161
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,620
And then we're going to be able to

162
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,600
launch campaigns 14 days from

163
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,259
today.
