1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:01,600
What's going on guys?

00:00:01,629 --> 00:00:02,450
Andre Hagel Jr.

3
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:03,980
here from Client Ascension and in

4
00:00:04,099 --> 00:00:05,540
this video I'm going to

5
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:08,130
reveal to you the new way of doing

6
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:11,480
cold email in 2025 and this is for

7
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:13,699
Client Ascension students

8
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,849
only so if you're watching this

9
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:17,789
congrats you have access to a

10
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:20,320
strategy in a way and essentially

11
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:20,500
a

12
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,500
private infrastructure which I'll

13
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,199
get into all the details about to

14
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,809
just get the best possible

15
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:28,149
results from cold email in 2025

16
00:00:28,149 --> 00:00:30,039
and really just capitalize on all

17
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:31,839
this momentum we have going

18
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:33,740
between Donald Trump getting

19
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:35,780
re-elected to the White House,

20
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:38,320
stock markets skyrocketing, crypto

21
00:00:38,359 --> 00:00:40,000
meme coins skyrocketing, Bitcoin

22
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:41,979
on its way to $100,000.

23
00:00:41,979 --> 00:00:43,609
There's so much momentum in the

24
00:00:43,609 --> 00:00:43,840
world

25
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,640
right now and so let's continue to

26
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,369
ride it and create that momentum

27
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:48,820
and replicate that momentum

28
00:00:48,859 --> 00:00:50,780
here in cold email outreach and so

29
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:52,229
let's just get into it.

30
00:00:52,229 --> 00:00:54,140
It's really straightforward and

31
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:54,630
simple

32
00:00:56,799 --> 00:00:58,000
really all this offer is is to get

33
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,979
your cold email system set up

34
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:04,159
completely done for you by the

35
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,950
ListKit team on ListKit's private

36
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:07,689
sending infrastructure which is

37
00:01:07,709 --> 00:01:09,040
performing better than

38
00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:10,719
any other deliverability tools on

39
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:11,500
the market.

40
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,939
If you stay until the end I'll

41
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:14,359
show you all the proof of that

42
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:16,079
so you can see how well our

43
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:18,569
infrastructure has been performing

44
00:01:18,569 --> 00:01:20,319
for us and for our clients

45
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,560
but more importantly by being a

46
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,579
student in Client Ascension you'll

47
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:29,040
get the $1,500 setup fee 100%

48
00:01:29,069 --> 00:01:29,200
waived.

49
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:30,719
So you just pay the monthly

50
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,620
subscription depending on the

51
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:34,150
package you choose.

52
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:35,040
The packages

53
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:36,000
are as follows.

54
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,319
It's $500 a month for 15,000 email

55
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:40,780
sends and then that goes all the

56
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:41,760
way up to

57
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:45,459
$5,000 a month for 210,000 email

58
00:01:45,579 --> 00:01:48,640
sends and for even higher volume

59
00:01:49,099 --> 00:01:51,120
if you want to go past 210,000

60
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:51,349
email

61
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,000
sends.

62
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,609
Personally here at ListKit and

63
00:01:53,609 --> 00:01:55,269
Client Ascension we're sending

64
00:01:55,269 --> 00:01:57,840
anywhere from 10 to 20,000 emails

65
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,079
per

66
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,909
day and so a little bit past that

67
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:01,530
higher package.

68
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:03,079
So for the higher packages you can

69
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,879
stack 15,000 email send

70
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,040
add-ons on top of the highest

71
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,800
package for $350 a month each and

72
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,719
also this is not fake urgency but

73
00:02:12,939 --> 00:02:15,030
prices will be increasing by 20%

74
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:17,539
on December 1st 2024.

75
00:02:17,539 --> 00:02:19,360
I'm currently recording this video

76
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,939
on November 20th

77
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:23,530
2024 so you have about a week and

78
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:25,409
a half to lock in on any of these

79
00:02:25,409 --> 00:02:27,520
packages before they increase by

80
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,629
20% so this package will go to 600

81
00:02:29,629 --> 00:02:31,699
or yeah 600 and then this package

82
00:02:31,699 --> 00:02:33,919
will go to 6,000 and all the rest

83
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,590
will go up by uh 20% as well and

84
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,979
so get in before then lock in on

85
00:02:38,979 --> 00:02:42,139
this pricing and uh reap the

86
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:42,639
rewards.

87
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,840
So packages include the following

88
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,340
you get cold email scripts from

89
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:48,159

98
00:02:57,479 --> 00:02:59,120
intent data topics and targeting

99
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:00,639

105
00:03:08,259 --> 00:03:08,560

107

channel exclusive weekly support

108
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:13,759
calls and so much more the cost

109
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,330
comparison breakdown if you were

110
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:16,840
to do this yourself essentially

111
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,430
your option is either you do cold

112
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,000
email yourself you go figure out

113
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,409
the tools you want to use for the

114
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:22,960
inboxes the tool you want to use

115
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,120
for

116
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:25,199
the sending the tool you want to

117
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:27,199
use for the email leads and all

118
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:29,199
that uh and you can see the cost

119
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:29,680
breakdown

120
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:31,569
for doing it yourself versus the

121
00:03:31,569 --> 00:03:33,319
cost if you were to just do this

122
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:35,460
through the list kit setup offer

123
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,199
not only is it actually cheaper

124
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,990
this is just an example based on

125
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:41,300
the 45 000 email sends per month

126
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,180
package but it's also going to

127
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:45,219
save you so much time because cold

128
00:03:45,219 --> 00:03:48,219
email takes a long time to set up

129
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,289
okay and this has been a

130
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:50,500
bottleneck for client ascension

131
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,919
students since we've launched the

132
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:52,180
program

133
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,669
which is why i'm so excited about

134
00:03:53,669 --> 00:03:55,360
this offer and this opportunity uh

135
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,199
because we can now get cold

136
00:03:57,419 --> 00:03:59,460
email checked off and out of the

137
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:01,550
way so we can move on to action

138
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:03,759
items and other legion sources

139
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:04,060
like

140
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:05,840
posting organic content on twitter

141
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:07,349
linkedin and youtube or doing

142
00:04:07,349 --> 00:04:09,280
dream 100 outreach or doing

143
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,599
outreach on upwork or just

144
00:04:10,659 --> 00:04:12,370
refining our sales process with

145
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:14,240
david by putting together a sales

146
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:14,590
script

147
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,839
um and doing the three pillars and

148
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:19,040
doing sales mock calls there's so

149
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,279
much other tasks that you could be

150
00:04:21,509 --> 00:04:22,860
focusing on crafting your your

151
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,620
perfect vsl following nick verges

152
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:26,279
training like there's so much you

153
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:26,589
could be

154
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:29,000
doing the problem though is cold

155
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,279
email is is obviously of utmost

156
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:33,279
importance especially for

157
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:34,720
client ascension students just

158
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,199
getting started and it just takes

159
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:37,439
a while to set up if you were to

160
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:37,680
do it

161
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,110
the old way if you were to do it

162
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:40,610
yourself but if you were to do it

163
00:04:40,689 --> 00:04:41,959
through list kit it's really

164
00:04:42,009 --> 00:04:42,350
simple

165
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:44,009
