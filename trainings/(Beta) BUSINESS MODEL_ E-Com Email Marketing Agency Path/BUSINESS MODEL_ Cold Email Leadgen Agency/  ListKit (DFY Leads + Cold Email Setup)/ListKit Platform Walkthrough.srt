00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01,449
What is going on christian here

2
00:00:01,449 --> 00:00:02,839
co-founder at list kit in this

3
00:00:02,839 --> 00:00:04,139
short video i want to give you

4
00:00:04,169 --> 00:00:05,900
a rundown and a quick tutorial of

5
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:07,620
how list kit works and how it can

6
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:09,000
save you hours upon hours

7
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:10,500
on your data and outbound

8
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,310
prospecting efforts let's dive

9
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:13,939
into it so self-serve platform

10
00:00:14,109 --> 00:00:14,740
similar

11
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:16,120
to zoom info similar to apollo

12
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,539
right the the dashboard is very

13
00:00:17,539 --> 00:00:18,820
similar we have the search

14
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,519
filters on the left the outputs on

15
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:22,030
the right let's build a sample

16
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:23,510
search for example let's do

17
00:00:26,859 --> 00:00:29,570
in advertising companies um with

18
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:33,119
you know 10 to 100 employees in

19
00:00:33,159 --> 00:00:35,429
the united states let's see what

20
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:35,539
we

21
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:38,869
get and then let's add in um ceo

22
00:00:38,869 --> 00:00:42,109
cmo owner job titles and the

23
00:00:42,109 --> 00:00:46,070
output is going to populate here

24
00:00:46,219 --> 00:00:47,429
right like any other data tool um

25
00:00:47,429 --> 00:00:48,520
this is very similar to what

26
00:00:48,579 --> 00:00:49,950
you've seen with other tools in

27
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,939
the marketplace let me go over the

28
00:00:51,939 --> 00:00:53,920
few key differences with list kit

29
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,060
first off when you

30
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,810
get a um a search outputted like

31
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:58,600
this and you see all the contacts

32
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,240
here 65 000 people all as you can

33
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:03,039
see with other tools is the first

34
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:05,359
you know 50 to 100 records and

35
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:07,439
that's your entire um glimpse into

36
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:08,340
the search that you built you

37
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:09,189
don't know if it's actually

38
00:01:09,189 --> 00:01:10,250
accurate and up to your standards

39
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:10,659
for what

40
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:11,920
you want to target list kit

41
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,189
changes that with our data

42
00:01:13,189 --> 00:01:14,819
visualization chart that you see

43
00:01:14,819 --> 00:01:15,900
here you can

44
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,200
actually see all 65 000 people in

45
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,780
the search and what continents

46
00:01:19,819 --> 00:01:21,609
they're in what location industry

47
00:01:21,849 --> 00:01:22,040
job

48
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:23,450
titles keywords and you can

49
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:25,230
eliminate outliers that you do not

50
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:26,900
want in your search for example

51
00:01:27,099 --> 00:01:29,390
let's say we don't want any social

52
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:31,459
media or let's do no branding

53
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,810
agencies in my search we cut out

54
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,280
branding and now the search is

55
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,689
going to exclude you can see it

56
00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:38,730
went down to 59 000 it's going to

57
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:39,359
exclude

58
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,560
every branding agency in the

59
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,959
search because we don't want that

60
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:43,200
right let's say we don't want

61
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:43,500
europe

62
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,659
in the search we don't want um

63
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:48,090
africa or asia we just want north

64
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:50,530
america we can sit here and trim

65
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,040
this search down until it is

66
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,790
exactly up to our specifications

67
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:55,739
not for the first 25 leads but for

68
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,950
the entire search of you know 47

69
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,540
000 people right once that is done

70
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,609
the export process is way faster

71
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:04,040
than any other tool in the

72
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,890
marketplace because all you do is

73
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:07,730
go here select how many contacts

74
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:08,258
per company

75
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,740
you want select how many credits

76
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:11,150
you would like click redeem and

77
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,939
you're going to be presented with

78
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,900
um a list in your email inbox that

79
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,860
is fully verified and ready to go

80
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,610
and let me explain the next

81
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:19,139
feature

82
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,710
what i mean by verified and ready

83
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:22,199
to go because when you get the

84
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:23,919
list in your inbox i'll pull one

85
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:24,219
up here

86
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,530
as an example every single email

87
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:28,830
in this list and in this output is

88
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:31,020
verified by us now what does that

89
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:31,240
mean

90
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:32,810
with apollo with zoom info with

91
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:34,819
seamless these guys say that their

92
00:02:34,819 --> 00:02:36,639
data is verified but they're just

93
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:37,939
giving you email contacts from

94
00:02:37,939 --> 00:02:39,289
their database without cleaning

95
00:02:39,349 --> 00:02:40,599
them at all and they're saying

96
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,020
good luck you have to use a

97
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:44,129
third-party verification tool like

98
00:02:44,129 --> 00:02:46,919
million verifier like never bounce

99
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:47,060
to

100
00:02:47,219 --> 00:02:48,330
actually make sure that these

101
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:49,830
email contacts are deliverable and

102
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:51,280
verified which takes a ton of time

103
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:52,800
a ton of effort it's a headache

104
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,430
list kit solves that we build the

105
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:56,159
verification to process into our

106
00:02:56,439 --> 00:02:58,099
backend so every email that you

107
00:02:58,189 --> 00:03:00,080
get from us is verified one credit

108
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,800
from us is one verified email

109
00:03:01,939 --> 00:03:03,759
whereas with apollo zoom info you

110
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:06,000
may export 10 you know emails into

111
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,900
a search and only six or seven of

112
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:09,469
them are verified so you wasted

113
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:11,129
three credits or you know three

114
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:12,770
dollars or however much the cost

115
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:13,099
is

116
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,250
on bad data we only charge you for

117
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,300
good verified triple verified

118
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,919
deliverable email data and that's

119
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:19,949
a

120
00:03:20,139 --> 00:03:21,389
key differentiator also you can

121
00:03:21,389 --> 00:03:23,199
export up to 10 000 credits at a

122
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:24,719
time right from this search bar

123
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:24,849
and

124
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,770
click redeem without needing to go

125
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:29,419
25 at a time exporting 25 25 25

126
00:03:29,419 --> 00:03:31,360
and taking 30 minutes to export

127
00:03:31,389 --> 00:03:32,919
a list of a few thousand records

128
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:33,939
right that's the key

129
00:03:33,939 --> 00:03:35,560
differentiator with the export

130
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,469
process it is as

131
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:37,849
simple as that to the point where

132
00:03:37,849 --> 00:03:39,099
you can get a list in your inbox

133
00:03:39,099 --> 00:03:40,439
in five minutes and you're ready

134
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:42,469
to start sending emails on the

135
00:03:42,469 --> 00:03:44,310
flip side we also have phone

136
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:46,150
number data and all you do like

137
00:03:46,389 --> 00:03:46,960
let's say

138
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,669
we built the exact same searches

139
00:03:48,669 --> 00:03:50,569
before marketing agencies instead

140
00:03:50,569 --> 00:03:52,400
of choosing email you just select

141
00:03:52,539 --> 00:03:53,900
with phone and this is going to

142
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,580
bring up a database of completely

143
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:57,639
new contacts with phone numbers so

144
00:03:57,639 --> 00:03:57,710
if

145
00:03:57,919 --> 00:03:59,110
you want to do cold calling and

146
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:00,770
send some you know dial some

147
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:02,550
outbound cold calls you can do

148
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:03,090
that too

149
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,419
right export process is the exact

150
00:04:05,419 --> 00:04:07,520
same you know three credits per

151
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,719
company let's say we want 10

152
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,960
credits to

153
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:12,530
redeem we click redeem there and

154
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:14,449
i'm now going to get a list of 50

155
00:04:14,449 --> 00:04:16,379
or 10 phone numbers in my email

156
00:04:16,379 --> 00:04:16,860
inbox that

157
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,209

158
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:19,300
dials to and here's what the

159
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:20,800
spreadsheet for phone numbers

160
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,000
looks

161
00:04:21,139 --> 00:04:22,569
like once you get it so we give

162
00:04:22,689 --> 00:04:24,339

rookie

165
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:27,439
but i just did it for marketing

166
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:28,660
purposes and some of the people

167
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,100

not as important as the ones i

199
00:05:11,009 --> 00:05:12,389
