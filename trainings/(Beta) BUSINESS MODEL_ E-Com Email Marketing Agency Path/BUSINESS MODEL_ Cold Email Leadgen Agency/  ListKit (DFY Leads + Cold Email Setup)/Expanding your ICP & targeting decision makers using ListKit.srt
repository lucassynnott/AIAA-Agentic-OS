1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,540
All right what's going on guys in

2
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:03,020
this video i want to show you how

3
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:04,509
to expand your list kit

4
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:06,030
search based on job titles so you

5
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:07,509
have a bigger total addressable

6
00:00:07,509 --> 00:00:09,119
market and more prospects to

7
00:00:09,449 --> 00:00:11,359
reach out to for example let's say

8
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:13,580
i'm reaching out to marketing and

9
00:00:13,619 --> 00:00:16,000
advertising companies and

10
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:17,690
i'm targeting um you know media

11
00:00:17,769 --> 00:00:19,410
keywords right this is going to

12
00:00:19,539 --> 00:00:21,039
give us a huge list that looks

13
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:22,719
great on paper but then when we go

14
00:00:22,809 --> 00:00:24,579
over here to job title and we only

15
00:00:24,579 --> 00:00:26,460
do cmos all of a sudden we

16
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:27,980
only have a thousand people to

17
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:29,190
reach out to um and a lot of

18
00:00:29,239 --> 00:00:30,940
people will come to us at list kit

19
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:31,199
and be

20
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:33,079
like i only want to work with one

21
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:35,020
specific job title i only want to

22
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:36,619
reach out to one job title

23
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:37,939
and i'm showing you right here why

24
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:39,219
that's not the best idea because

25
00:00:39,219 --> 00:00:40,240
you're going to run out of

26
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:42,390
addressable market in like a week

27
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:44,219
right so in the case of um only

28
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:47,119
having 1300 people based on cmo

29
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:47,359
job

30
00:00:47,689 --> 00:00:49,420
titles the easiest way to expand

31
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:51,549
your search is to add in different

32
00:00:51,549 --> 00:00:53,439
job titles so vp of marketing

33
00:00:54,969 --> 00:00:57,679
head of marketing marketing

34
00:00:57,679 --> 00:00:59,359
director

35
00:00:59,689 --> 00:01:03,070
okay so we already 9x the search

36
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:08,180
results from 1300 to 9 000 and

37
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:09,280
this is going to give you more

38
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:10,859
addressable market to reach out to

39
00:01:10,859 --> 00:01:12,269
with your campaigns and you're

40
00:01:12,269 --> 00:01:13,680
probably saying well i only

41
00:01:13,939 --> 00:01:15,230
like speaking to cmos that's

42
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:16,849
completely fine you can add in a

43
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,719
step in your cold email sequence

44
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:19,200
that says

45
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:21,489
who might be the best person at um

46
00:01:21,489 --> 00:01:24,219
top 10 media to discuss marketing

47
00:01:24,219 --> 00:01:26,239
with and they're more than likely

48
00:01:26,569 --> 00:01:28,269
going to say my cmoivan is the

49
00:01:28,269 --> 00:01:30,480
best person right so even if you

50
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,799
don't have a list of strictly the

51
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:32,959
job

52
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,260
titles you want to reach out to

53
00:01:34,349 --> 00:01:35,670
you can still get in touch with

54
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:38,640
the right person by proxy of

55
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:39,040
reaching

56
00:01:39,069 --> 00:01:40,090
out to a different job title at

57
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:41,359
that company does that make sense

58
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:43,840
if you only work with cmos you can

59
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,079
still

60
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,760
reach out to other marketing job

61
00:01:45,849 --> 00:01:47,489
titles at a company and they will

62
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:49,680
direct you to the cmo by asking in

63
00:01:49,969 --> 00:01:51,659
your cold email script who might

64
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:53,620
be the best person to reach out to

65
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:55,680
to discuss xyz with right and if

66
00:01:55,709 --> 00:01:57,230
we're still looking for more tam

67
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:58,609
we can literally just type in

68
00:01:58,609 --> 00:02:00,099
marketing as a job title this is

69
00:02:00,099 --> 00:02:00,500
going

70
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:02,569
to pull in every single marketing

71
00:02:02,569 --> 00:02:04,480
job title in the search and we're

72
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,239
at 91 000 people we went from a

73
00:02:06,269 --> 00:02:08,909
we went from a thousand to 91 000

74
00:02:08,909 --> 00:02:10,979
people by adding in marketing as a

75
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:12,240
as a broad job title

76
00:02:12,469 --> 00:02:13,930
yes this might get you some

77
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:16,199
interns and some weird people that

78
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:18,159
respond to your emails but they

79
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:18,560
will

80
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:20,060
they will direct you to their

81
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:21,689
higher ups the cmos the ceos the

82
00:02:21,689 --> 00:02:23,680
people you want to speak to so if

83
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:25,370
you're struggling to find enough

84
00:02:25,449 --> 00:02:26,939
tam total addressable market

85
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:28,500
inside of list kit this is your

86
00:02:28,689 --> 00:02:29,349
best bet

87
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:31,770
expand the job titles um obviously

88
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:33,710
you can expand keywords and do

89
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,719
like digital

90
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:36,409
media but if you're really

91
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,280
struggling to build a bigger

92
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,960
audience all you want to do is add

93
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,120
in those

94
00:02:41,469 --> 00:02:42,750
extra job titles because they even

95
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,020
if you don't want to work with

96
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:45,439
them will direct you to the right

97
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:46,009
person

98
00:02:46,189 --> 00:02:48,250
at the company and you will have

99
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:50,240
you'll have more deal flow right

100
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,199
so that's pretty much it

101
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:53,120
hopefully this makes sense thanks
