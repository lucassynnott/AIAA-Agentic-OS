1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,419
All right time for the most

2
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:02,950
important part of any cold email

3
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:04,580
campaign the copywriting

4
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:06,549
What are you actually saying in

5
00:00:06,549 --> 00:00:08,150
your email to get a random

6
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:10,230
stranger to raise their hand and

7
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:10,720
say yes?

8
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:12,060
I want to learn more

9
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:13,740
There is a very specific art and

10
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,640
science to this and I want to show

11
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,359
you how to do it step by step

12
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:18,730
so you can write a really good

13
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:20,739
cold email from scratch without

14
00:00:20,739 --> 00:00:21,190
much

15
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,000
guidance or hand-holding

16
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:25,879
Obviously we have an AI tool

17
00:00:25,879 --> 00:00:26,969
that's going to show you how to

18
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:28,640
write good cold emails where you

19
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,600
can just input the

20
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,730
Service that you're selling and

21
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:32,368
it'll spit out a really good cold

22
00:00:32,368 --> 00:00:34,170
email script based on my training

23
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:35,880
and my guidance because I

24
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,759
Fed an AI bought all of my work

25
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:39,450
and all of my training and

26
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:40,280
everything

27
00:00:40,289 --> 00:00:42,159
so you have an AI at your disposal

28
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:43,990
that can write really good cold

29
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:44,960
emails, but

30
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:48,060
You still want to understand

31
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:49,630
The fundamentals of a good cold

32
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:51,600
email scripts because you if you

33
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,170
don't then you'll have no clue if

34
00:00:53,179 --> 00:00:54,759
the AI is actually producing good

35
00:00:54,759 --> 00:00:55,630
content or not

36
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,369
So let's learn the basics of cold

37
00:00:58,369 --> 00:00:58,700
email

38
00:00:58,729 --> 00:01:00,719
So when you use the AI tool you

39
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,469
will actually know how to create a

40
00:01:02,469 --> 00:01:04,079
good cold email scripts with it

41
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:05,560
and how to judge if the script

42
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,450
that it created is good

43
00:01:06,459 --> 00:01:09,430
So let's dive in so the only two

44
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,829
things that matter in a cold email

45
00:01:11,829 --> 00:01:13,359
scripts are the offer

46
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:15,829
What are you selling right and the

47
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:17,000
call to action?

48
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:19,780

next?

50
00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:22,260
Think of this like a commercial

52

Think about what in that title

195
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:33,220
grabs your attention

196
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,529
The world's best hamburger

197
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:37,529
Is a lot more enticing than I

198
00:05:37,529 --> 00:05:39,810
tried a good hamburger today,

199
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:40,180
right?

200
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:42,379
Same principle applies when you're

201
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:44,180
writing cold email scripts

202
00:05:44,189 --> 00:05:46,649
We can create custom polos from

203
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,740
ralph loren with your logo on it

204
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:48,870

205
00:05:49,149 --> 00:05:50,899
we can make custom clothing for

206
00:05:50,899 --> 00:05:51,610
your school

207
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:53,189
When you're writing a cold email

208
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,589
scripts you want it to be so

209
00:05:54,699 --> 00:05:55,220
enticing

210
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:56,990
That anybody would be a fool to

211
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,019
not want to learn more

212
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,199

instagram bad offer

218

We can grow your instagram account

219
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:15,459
Vague not enticing it's not sexy

220
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:16,750
you want to be able to write a

221
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:19,029
cold email offer and have it be

222
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:22,029
sexy 100k followers custom polos

223
00:06:22,029 --> 00:06:23,699

224
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:26,579
Much better than we can run cold

225
00:06:26,579 --> 00:06:27,600
email campaigns.

226
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,870
We can make custom clothing.

227
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:29,980
We can grow your account.

228
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:31,139
No one cares about those things

229
00:06:31,149 --> 00:06:32,829
So keep that in mind when you're

230
00:06:32,829 --> 00:06:34,720
writing your cold emails and using

231
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,139
the ai

232
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:38,970
And then the only other piece of a

233
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,519
cold email campaign is the call to

234
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:40,870
action

235
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,370
What do you because if somebody

236
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:44,339
reads your cold email?

237
00:06:44,339 --> 00:06:45,720
They need to know what the next

238
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,720
step is or else they're going to

239
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,100
get confused and log off and not

240
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,019
answer your email

241
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:51,399
Think about just think of like

242
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:52,019
human nature

243
00:06:52,269 --> 00:06:53,750
If somebody gets an email from a

244
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,480
stranger in their inbox and it's

245
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,089
not clear

246
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,930
What the next step is they're not

247
00:06:57,930 --> 00:06:58,569
going to answer you

248
00:06:58,579 --> 00:07:00,410
Think about the average human at

249
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:02,589
the airport if if the tsa agent at

250
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:03,939
the airport doesn't say

251
00:07:03,939 --> 00:07:06,189
Go into lane six.

252
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:07,050
How many people are going to be

253
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:07,220
like?

254
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,060
Where do I go?

255
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:10,579
Oh, and just sit there with their

256
00:07:10,579 --> 00:07:11,939
mouth open the same thing is true

257
00:07:11,939 --> 00:07:13,629
over email you have to guide

258
00:07:13,629 --> 00:07:14,259
somebody

259
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:16,730
Hand hold them into opening their

260
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:18,579
email clicking respond and saying

261
00:07:18,579 --> 00:07:19,300
hey, yes

262
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,259
I would love to learn more

263
00:07:20,269 --> 00:07:22,560
So what are you pick what is your

264
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,449
tsa agent instruction to this

265
00:07:24,449 --> 00:07:26,180
person to get them to answer?

266
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:30,399
Would you like to see a quick

267
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:32,819
video explaining further?

268
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:36,290
Hey, we can book you 10 sales

269
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:37,370
calls a month from a cold email

270
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:37,899
campaign.

271
00:07:37,899 --> 00:07:38,819
Would you like to see a quick

272
00:07:38,819 --> 00:07:39,860
video explaining further?

273
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:41,939
That is a good call to action

274
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:46,629
Mind if I send over a catalog of

275
00:07:47,019 --> 00:07:47,620
our ralph

276
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:50,329
Loren products

277
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:53,699
So you can pick out a few samples?

278
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:56,019
Why is this a good call to action?

279
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,339
Because i'm creating the curiosity

280
00:07:58,339 --> 00:07:58,720
factor

281
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,540
By asking if they want to see a

282
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:02,759
catalog of the products that we

283
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:04,660
offer so you can pick out samples

284
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,310
Right what else is a good call to

285
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:08,660
action?

286
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:12,610
Would you be open to seeing a

287
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:15,670
sample instagram post I made for

288
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,019
you?

289
00:08:16,019 --> 00:08:18,490
Why is this a good call to action?

290
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:20,610
Because i'm offering free upfront

291
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:22,560
work in exchange for nothing,

292
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:22,980
right?

293
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:27,500
So when you guys are using the ai

294
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,819
bot and writing the cold email

295
00:08:28,819 --> 00:08:29,699
scripts on your own

296
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,899
Think about what would entice

297
00:08:32,899 --> 00:08:34,840
somebody to click on your email

298
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,418
and respond back to it

299
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:38,230
Yeah, I would like this.

300
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:39,330
I would take a video explaining

301
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:39,610
further

302
00:08:40,158 --> 00:08:41,668
Yeah, I would take a catalog of

303
00:08:41,668 --> 00:08:42,168
products.

304
00:08:42,269 --> 00:08:43,460
There's no harm in that, right?

305
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:44,809
I would be open to seeing a sample

306
00:08:44,809 --> 00:08:45,860
post that you made for me

307
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,940
What are some bad call to actions?

308
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:53,220
Open to learning more

309
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:55,220
It's vague, right?

310
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:56,820
There's no clear next step if I if

311
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:59,059
someone reads this and says, uh

312
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,110
Yeah, I could be open to learning

313
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:02,149
more, but I don't really know

314
00:09:02,149 --> 00:09:03,129
what's going on here.

315
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,659
Click next, right?

316
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:06,080
You have literally three seconds

317
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,629
to get someone's attention to get

318
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:09,299
them to respond back to you

319
00:09:09,309 --> 00:09:10,879
Or else you're just not going to

320
00:09:10,899 --> 00:09:12,340
get them to say yes, right?

321
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:13,879
And i'll show you guys examples of

322
00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:15,519
good cold emails in action.

323
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,100
So this is like

324
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:18,500
because I hate when

325
00:09:18,509 --> 00:09:20,179
I hate like if you're watching

326
00:09:20,179 --> 00:09:21,370
this if I was watching this from

327
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:23,179
your perspective, I hate theories

328
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:24,019
and

329
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,759
You know thought like I don't want

330
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:28,070
to just show you what my thought

331
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:28,710
processes are

332
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,480
I want to show you real examples

333
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,320
from our clients that work so you

334
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,419
can see this in action

335
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:36,279
Um with a business that's actively

336
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:37,059
generating cash

337
00:09:37,139 --> 00:09:39,299
From what i'm teaching you in this

338
00:09:39,299 --> 00:09:39,610
right?

339
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,230
So sit tight i'm going to go

340
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:42,509
through the theory of it and then

341
00:09:42,509 --> 00:09:43,139
i'm going to show you

342
00:09:43,139 --> 00:09:45,019
Real world applications of what

343
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:47,120
i'm telling you so sit tight pay

344
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,549
attention and then we'll relate it

345
00:09:48,549 --> 00:09:49,299
to a real example

346
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:50,580
so

347
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,379
Are you open to learning more bad,

348
00:09:52,389 --> 00:09:52,740
right?

349
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,899
Would you

350
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,980
Be open

351
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,059
To a quick

352
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,379
Call to learn more

353
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,220
Bad call to action because once

354
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:04,500
again

355
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,970
Um, first of all they're like

356
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:09,519
This is going to take time out of

357
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:10,980
my day to talk to this person

358
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:11,899
I don't really want to talk to

359
00:10:11,899 --> 00:10:12,820
them yet

360
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:15,019
As compared to oh, yeah, i'll take

361
00:10:15,019 --> 00:10:16,389
a catalog and then once they see

362
00:10:16,389 --> 00:10:17,460
the catalog, they're like wow

363
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:18,149
This is great.

364
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,299
Let's hop on a phone call

365
00:10:19,309 --> 00:10:20,870
So you're kind of reversing the

366
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,259
psychology of it where you're

367
00:10:22,259 --> 00:10:24,419
giving people things a video a

368
00:10:24,419 --> 00:10:26,019
catalog a free sample

369
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,840
Instead of asking for things like

370
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,250
would you be open to a quick call

371
00:10:29,289 --> 00:10:29,940
to learn more?

372
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:32,409
What's another bad call to action?

373
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:35,220
Um

374
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,620
Are you interested?

375
00:10:41,379 --> 00:10:42,879
Would you want to talk more about

376
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:43,379
this like?

377
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,710
Bottom line here is the entire

378
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:48,340
email needs to be sexy, right?

379
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:49,759
We can help you book 10 sales

380
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,159
calls a month from a cold email

381
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:51,700
campaign

382
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:52,980
Would you like to see a quick

383
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,889
video explaining further is a lot

384
00:10:54,889 --> 00:10:57,120
sexier than we can run cold email

385
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,179
campaigns for your business?

386
00:10:58,190 --> 00:10:59,370
Are you interested?

387
00:10:59,370 --> 00:10:59,700
Right?

388
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,039
Let's go through full examples

389
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:02,399
here

390
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:05,929
Like let's just piece this

391
00:11:05,929 --> 00:11:07,379
together, right?

392
00:11:07,379 --> 00:11:09,570
Let's turn it into a real cold

393
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:10,350
email angle

394
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:13,029
We can book 10 sales calls a month

395
00:11:13,029 --> 00:11:14,980
from a cold email campaign

396
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:20,149
Would you like to see a quick

397
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,039
video explaining further that is

398
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:23,269
the meat and potatoes of a cold

399
00:11:23,629 --> 00:11:25,139
email angle that would actually

400
00:11:25,139 --> 00:11:25,379
work?

401
00:11:25,389 --> 00:11:26,929
If you're watching this and you're

402
00:11:26,929 --> 00:11:27,059
like

403
00:11:27,059 --> 00:11:28,820
All I have to do is write two

404
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,250
sentences and I can get strangers

405
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,669
to say yes to my email and want to

406
00:11:31,669 --> 00:11:32,179
learn more

407
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:34,179
Yes, you can that is a real

408
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:36,049
No bs answer.

409
00:11:36,049 --> 00:11:36,980
Yes, you can

410
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:37,870
Are there things you can do to

411
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:38,549
make this better?

412
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:40,399
Yes, but we're we're going very

413
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:41,299
basic right now

414
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:43,259
And then we can expand on this in

415
00:11:43,259 --> 00:11:43,700
a second

416
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:48,100
Angle number two

417
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:49,899
We can help you collect 50k in a

418
00:11:49,899 --> 00:11:51,519
month in revenue with an email

419
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:52,570
marketing system

420
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,129
Using klaviyo klaviyo is an email

421
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:58,730
marketing software that a lot of

422
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:00,659
e-commerce brands use right?

423
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,539
Call to action

424
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,009
Mind if I send or let's do

425
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:10,779
Mind if I send over an email

426
00:12:10,779 --> 00:12:12,820
template I came up with

427
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:16,049
for you

428
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:18,500
Using the products on your

429
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:22,659
Website

430
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:23,940
Yes, I would love to see the

431
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,029
products that you've made for me

432
00:12:25,029 --> 00:12:26,100
on the on your website, right?

433
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:29,299
Angle three

434
00:12:30,909 --> 00:12:32,950
We can create custom polos from

435
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:34,820
ralph lauren with your central

436
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:36,820
school district's logo on the polo

437
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:40,230
Mind if I send over a catalog of

438
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:41,679
our products so you can take a

439
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:43,299
look and pick out a few samples

440
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:45,299
Good angle, right?

441
00:12:45,309 --> 00:12:47,299
These are what good cold emails

442
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:49,259
look like and once I go into real

443
00:12:49,259 --> 00:12:50,919
real examples, they really are

444
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:52,179
this short and to the point

445
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:53,139
Now

446
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:55,399
Let's call this meat and potatoes,

447
00:12:55,409 --> 00:12:55,700
right?

448
00:12:56,159 --> 00:12:57,379
Because this is like

449
00:12:57,379 --> 00:12:58,759
These are like the fundamental

450
00:12:58,759 --> 00:13:00,179
basics of a cold email campaign

451
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:02,059
that makes it successful

452
00:13:02,259 --> 00:13:04,100
Let's go into the toppings

453
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:06,779
That can add flavor to your cold

454
00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:07,779
email, right?

455
00:13:07,789 --> 00:13:09,460
What are some toppings?

456
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:11,259
Instead of just saying hey, we can

457
00:13:11,259 --> 00:13:12,429
book you 10 sales calls a month

458
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:13,629
from a cold email campaign.

459
00:13:13,629 --> 00:13:14,149
We can also say

460
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:17,940
List kit was able to sign two new

461
00:13:18,039 --> 00:13:20,419
high ticket clients

462
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:25,460
From the calls we booked for them

463
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,700
And we can replicate

464
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:29,370
This success

465
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,740
For you, right?

466
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:33,779
What is the topping here?

467
00:13:33,789 --> 00:13:34,740
It's a case study

468
00:13:34,769 --> 00:13:37,019
Of work that I did for somebody

469
00:13:37,029 --> 00:13:37,210
else

470
00:13:37,309 --> 00:13:39,059
If you're brand new to business

471
00:13:39,059 --> 00:13:40,000
and you don't have any case

472
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:40,500
studies yet

473
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,480
You can't use case studies as a

474
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,019
topping until you have

475
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,019
Case studies to use

476
00:13:46,029 --> 00:13:47,860
So what you can do instead

477
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:50,559
For yourself or for your clients

478
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,820
Is use a guarantee?

479
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:53,779
What is a guarantee?

480
00:13:53,789 --> 00:13:54,559
For me, it looks like this

481
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,700
We can help you collect 50k a

482
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:57,700
month in revenue with an email

483
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,139
marketing system using klaviyo

484
00:13:59,149 --> 00:13:59,830
If you don't

485
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,830
See at least a 50k boost

486
00:14:02,909 --> 00:14:04,259
In sales

487
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,139
Within 60 days

488
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:08,500
You don't have to pay us

489
00:14:10,269 --> 00:14:11,620
Why is this a guarantee?

490
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,190
Because you're guaranteeing the

491
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:13,779
end outcome

492
00:14:13,779 --> 00:14:16,919
Of 50k a month in sales within 60

493
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:17,299
days

494
00:14:17,309 --> 00:14:18,710
Or else you don't pay us

495
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:19,710
That's why it's a guarantee

496
00:14:19,779 --> 00:14:21,490
because there's no risk to the

497
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:22,340
prospect

498
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:26,100
To say yes to this, right?

499
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:27,919
Of course, you or your client has

500
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:29,539
to actually be comfortable

501
00:14:29,539 --> 00:14:31,299
With selling a guarantee

502
00:14:31,309 --> 00:14:32,279
Like you can't just make up a

503
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:33,679
guarantee for your client and then

504
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:33,769
go

505
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:34,559
Hey, mr.

506
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:35,059
Client

507
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:36,360
I guaranteed this person this

508
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,059
amount of revenue

509
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:38,019
They're gonna get pissed at you

510
00:14:38,019 --> 00:14:38,899
and probably fire you

511
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:44,820
So make sure that you have

512
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,389
You know some sort of process of

513
00:14:46,419 --> 00:14:47,789
asking your clients if they're

514
00:14:47,899 --> 00:14:48,789
comfortable with pitching a

515
00:14:48,789 --> 00:14:49,289
guarantee

516
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:50,909
Otherwise, this isn't going to

517
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,620
work, right?

518
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:53,460
Let's say you're doing an angle

519
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:55,190
for your own business and you want

520
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:56,090
to have a guarantee in there

521
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,379
We can add 10 sales calls

522
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:02,820
Per month to your calendar

523
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:06,820
With an outbound cold email

524
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:07,500
campaign

525
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:13,620
If you don't

526
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:18,309
You only let's do um, we work

527
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,710
fully on performance.

528
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:22,100
So you only pay us

529
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:25,070
for

530
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:29,529
Per booked call that actually

531
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,899
Shows up to the meeting

532
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,779
Mind

533
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:38,580
If I send over a video explaining

534
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:39,779
Further

535
00:15:39,779 --> 00:15:42,659
So literally the meat and potatoes

536
00:15:42,659 --> 00:15:43,850
is the offer

537
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:45,110
What are you actually offering to

538
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,279
the person on on the other end of

539
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:46,659
the email?

540
00:15:46,659 --> 00:15:48,539
And what action do you want them

541
00:15:48,629 --> 00:15:49,139
to take?

542
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,220
Say yes to a video

543
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:52,419
Say yes to a template that you

544
00:15:52,419 --> 00:15:53,100
made for them.

545
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:54,580
Say yes to a catalog, right?

546
00:15:55,409 --> 00:15:57,220
Obviously, if you're a cold email

547
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:58,340
business, all of your

548
00:15:58,799 --> 00:15:59,909
messaging is going to be around

549
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,309
cold email, but you're going to

550
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:02,980
work with clients that sell email

551
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,659
marketing custom polos

552
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,740
Any b2b service, we have a client

553
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,259
that sells amish gazebos to pool

554
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:10,340
builders, right?

555
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:10,490
So

556
00:16:10,509 --> 00:16:12,070
The beauty of cold email is you

557
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:13,470
can work with any business

558
00:16:13,549 --> 00:16:14,759
The downside is that you have to

559
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:15,990
get really good at writing cold

560
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:17,139
emails for a lot of different

561
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,820
business and service offerings

562
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:20,639
But i'm here to show you how to do

563
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:20,960
it.

564
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,009
So

565
00:16:22,179 --> 00:16:23,350
Hopefully this makes sense meat

566
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:25,379
and potatoes offer call to action

567
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,259
toppings

568
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:29,159
Case study if your client has a

569
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:30,720
case study use it if you have a

570
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,950
case study after a few months of

571
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:33,460
being in business use it

572
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:35,240
If you don't have a case study

573
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,259
that you can use

574
00:16:36,259 --> 00:16:38,730
Guarantee throw in a guarantee ask

575
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:40,019
your client if they're comfortable

576
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:40,820
with the guarantee

577
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,779
And then go from there

578
00:16:43,789 --> 00:16:44,870
And now because I know a lot of

579
00:16:44,899 --> 00:16:46,179
you are going to be asking this

580
00:16:46,769 --> 00:16:48,309
Subject lines

581
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,029
What subject lines do I use to get

582
00:16:50,029 --> 00:16:51,580
people to open my email and i'm

583
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:53,289
going to give you literally four

584
00:16:53,419 --> 00:16:53,860
options

585
00:16:53,909 --> 00:16:56,129
With the first being quick

586
00:16:56,139 --> 00:16:58,100
question the most classic

587
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:00,850
cold email line of all time is

588
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:03,220
quick question it works for

589
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:06,818
It's worked for the last

590
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,318
Five six years and it's going to

591
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:09,869
continue to work for the next five

592
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:10,338
years

593
00:17:10,348 --> 00:17:12,160
It just works really well at

594
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,809
getting people to open the email

595
00:17:14,818 --> 00:17:16,180
and respond to it

596
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:17,160
It's as simple as that.

597
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:18,180
I don't know what it is about it

598
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,490
People just love to open a quick

599
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:21,150
question email

600
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:24,190
But I like to test a couple

601
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,078
different things in my outreach to

602
00:17:26,269 --> 00:17:27,779
see what performs better

603
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,180
Because if you're just running one

604
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:31,380
strategy, then you're

605
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,769
Not being a smart marketer because

606
00:17:33,769 --> 00:17:34,759
you have the ability to test

607
00:17:34,759 --> 00:17:36,059
different things and you should be

608
00:17:36,059 --> 00:17:37,059
testing different things

609
00:17:37,059 --> 00:17:38,940
What else can I use as a subject

610
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:39,299
line?

611
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:42,259
I like to do

612
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,349
company name

613
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:45,789
So this is going to be a text

614
00:17:45,789 --> 00:17:46,339
replacement for the actual

615
00:17:46,339 --> 00:17:47,640
business that you're reaching out

616
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:48,059
to x

617
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:50,299
Your business name or your

618
00:17:50,329 --> 00:17:50,980
client's name

619
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:52,980
So like list kit

620
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,339
Intro, right?

621
00:17:54,349 --> 00:17:55,319
So what does this look like from

622
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:56,809
the the person on the other end's

623
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:57,539
perspective?

624
00:17:57,539 --> 00:17:59,799
Let's say the person on the other

625
00:17:59,809 --> 00:18:00,509
end runs a company called

626
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,099
um

627
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:03,779
sunny

628
00:18:03,789 --> 00:18:05,339
Plumbing right sunny plumbing is

629
00:18:05,339 --> 00:18:06,410
the name of their business.

630
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:07,539
It would look like this sunny

631
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:08,460
plumbing x

632
00:18:09,859 --> 00:18:11,740
Your business name i'm list kit is

633
00:18:11,829 --> 00:18:12,519
my business.

634
00:18:12,519 --> 00:18:13,619
Let's say you're running.

635
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:14,980
Um, one two three leads

636
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,140
Intro

637
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:20,559
Why does this work because I had

638
00:18:20,619 --> 00:18:22,099
an email in my inbox that said

639
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:23,670
um

640
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:25,579
Like list kit x one two three

641
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:27,299
leads intro and it got me to open

642
00:18:27,319 --> 00:18:29,039
the email because it looked like a

643
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:30,099
warm introduction

644
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:32,900
To a new client a new referral

645
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:33,849
So I was like, oh, this is an

646
00:18:33,849 --> 00:18:35,069
introduction and then I opened the

647
00:18:35,069 --> 00:18:36,339
email and I realized it was a cold

648
00:18:36,339 --> 00:18:37,579

Therefore i'm going to be using

651
00:18:40,329 --> 00:18:41,299
this because of myself

652
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:43,750
If I fell for this as a cold email

653
00:18:43,779 --> 00:18:45,140
expert other people are going to

654
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:46,549

email

686
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,309
Scripts the subject lines should

687
00:19:51,309 --> 00:19:52,769
be an afterthought you plug in

688
00:19:52,769 --> 00:19:53,539
quick question

689
00:19:53,549 --> 00:19:55,299
The gold standard of cold email

690
00:19:55,299 --> 00:19:57,299
subject lines you plug in

691
00:19:57,759 --> 00:20:00,000

00:20:00,019 --> 00:20:01,890
intro and then you test out like

693
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:03,359
one or two of these other ones and

694
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:04,980
that covers subject lines

695
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:05,519
completely

696
00:20:06,509 --> 00:20:08,500
So let's tie it all together,

697
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:08,500
right?

698
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,099
A master email

699
00:20:12,109 --> 00:20:14,500
I'll just call it a master email

700
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,740
Subject line quick question

701
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:23,460
Hey tom

702
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:26,990
We can book you 10 sales calls a

703
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:30,299
month with an outbound cold email

704
00:20:30,299 --> 00:20:31,029
campaign

705
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:34,339
And we work on performance

706
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,700
So you only pay us per booked

707
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:41,049
Sales call that shows up to the

708
00:20:41,049 --> 00:20:41,940
meeting

709
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,259
Mind if I share a quick video

710
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,900
Explaining how this would work for

711
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:54,609
Sunny roofing right whatever the

712
00:20:54,609 --> 00:20:55,920
business's name is that's just a

713
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:56,710
stupid example.

714
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:57,220
I came up with

715
00:20:58,430 --> 00:20:59,509
It would actually look like this

716
00:20:59,509 --> 00:21:00,890
because you want to use the text

717
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:02,019
replacement so that you can

718
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:04,569
Automatically pull in the name of

719
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:05,700
the business that you're reaching

720
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:05,930
out to

721
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,130
And that's it guys hey tom we can

722
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:10,509
book you 10 sales calls a month

723
00:21:10,509 --> 00:21:11,599
with an outbound cold email

724
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:12,099
campaign

725
00:21:12,589 --> 00:21:14,109
And we work on performance so you

726
00:21:14,109 --> 00:21:15,690
only pay us I would actually cut

727
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:15,940
this

728
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,089
Into two lines it looks easier to

729
00:21:19,089 --> 00:21:20,619
digest this is another good thing

730
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:21,059
to know

731
00:21:21,069 --> 00:21:23,720
Look at how easily digestible this

732
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:23,940
is

733
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,109
Compared to this where it's like

734
00:21:26,109 --> 00:21:28,200
two sentences in one you want to

735
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,420
segment this as much as you can

736
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:32,309
So it looks easier more bite-sized

737
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:33,940
to read because once again the

738
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:35,109
average person doesn't want to

739
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:36,339
read a big block of text

740
00:21:36,339 --> 00:21:37,910
They want to read short bite-sized

741
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:39,039
pieces of information

742
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:42,890
And that's the entire email can

743
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,279
you throw in a question to open it

744
00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:44,740
of course

745
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:47,599
Are you looking to sign more

746
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:49,380
roofing clients?

747
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:51,849
We can have an icebreaker we can

748
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:53,380
say hey tom noticed you're

749
00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:56,349
the owner at

750
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,420
sunny roofing

751
00:21:58,430 --> 00:22:00,130
So like you can use different

752
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:01,960
icebreakers if you want but the

753
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,099
only things that matter

754
00:22:03,859 --> 00:22:05,529
Are the offer and the call to

755
00:22:05,529 --> 00:22:07,460
action and sprinkle in a little

756
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:08,329
ketchup and mustard

757
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,599
With the guarantee or with the

758
00:22:10,609 --> 00:22:11,990
case study, right?

759
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,019
meat and potatoes

760
00:22:14,029 --> 00:22:15,839
A little bit of ketchup and

761
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:17,990
mustard and then a little bit of

762
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:18,700
an opener

763
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,710
There see what I mean does this

764
00:22:21,819 --> 00:22:23,140
opener have to be like this?

765
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:24,099
No, you can say

766
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:28,779
Saw you're a leading roofer in

767
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:29,460

Saw you oversee marketing at sunny

769
00:22:33,869 --> 00:22:35,609
roofing so like you can just

770
00:22:35,609 --> 00:22:36,849
experiment with a ton of these

771
00:22:36,849 --> 00:22:37,220
openers

772
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:38,789
But once you have the offer and

773
00:22:38,789 --> 00:22:40,579
the call to action your cold email

774
00:22:40,579 --> 00:22:41,049
is set

775
00:22:41,069 --> 00:22:42,190
And you just got to mix in a

776
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:43,740
couple other variables to make it

777
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:44,890
as perfect as possible

778
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:46,440
In the next video.

779
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,869
I want to go over a live campaign

780
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:49,220
that i'm running for my business

781
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:51,099
Along with a few examples of my

782
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:51,690
clients

783
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:53,440
So you can get a better concept of

784
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,839
how this works because I want to

785
00:22:54,839 --> 00:22:55,220
ease you

786
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:57,250
I want to ease you into this as

787
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:58,369
much as I possibly can so

788
00:22:58,369 --> 00:23:00,259
hopefully this is helpful so far.

789
00:23:00,259 --> 00:23:00,880
Let's see.

790
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:02,019
Let's get to the next video
