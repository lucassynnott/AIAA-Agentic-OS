1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,919
All right, so what happens when

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:03,680
somebody responds saying yes,

3
00:00:03,879 --> 00:00:04,719
please send me a video

4
00:00:04,719 --> 00:00:05,960
What do you do from there this

5
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:07,559
entire guide is going to break it

6
00:00:07,559 --> 00:00:09,269
down from you from top to bottom?

7
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:12,480
With examples of a video pitch

8
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,920
that you can use I have one two

9
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:19,739
three different examples in here

10
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:21,690
Along with you know a whole

11
00:00:21,739 --> 00:00:23,829
backstory on my business.

12
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:25,579
How do you frame the the video

13
00:00:25,579 --> 00:00:26,280
over email?

14
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:28,109
How do you send the email that

15
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:29,960
sends the video in it how to book

16
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,500
a call on the back end?

17
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,020
Basically?

18
00:00:32,368 --> 00:00:34,340
What I'm doing here is I'm trying

19
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:36,420
to think of every what if

20
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:37,939
situation where you get a result

21
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:38,780
and you're like

22
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:39,960
What do I do now?

23
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,460
I want to have a video in this

24
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:43,640
module for every single possible

25
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,759
scenario where you could possibly

26
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:47,520
say what now, right?

27
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,469
So if someone says yes to a video

28
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:50,420
for yourself

29
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,140
Reference this doc if someone says

30
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:55,479
yes to a video from your client

31
00:00:55,479 --> 00:00:57,000
send your client this document

32
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,280
have them read it and then make a

33
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:58,600
really

34
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,369
Well done video on their end,

35
00:01:01,369 --> 00:01:02,009
right?

36
00:01:02,009 --> 00:01:03,149
So here's how it works, right?

37
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:04,519
Somebody says yes to a video

38
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:08,120
Right, they say yes, I would love

39
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:08,689
to see a video.

40
00:01:08,689 --> 00:01:09,260
Please share it

41
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:11,060
What do you do from there?

42
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:12,620
Well, I'm not gonna go through

43
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:13,840
these videos in detail, but

44
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,670
basically here.

45
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,519
Let's check this out

46
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:17,750
Alright, this is the first example

47
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:18,540
of a new video I would send to a

48
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,099
prospect that they agreed to get a

49
00:01:20,099 --> 00:01:20,739
video for me

50
00:01:20,739 --> 00:01:22,180
In this case, I'm pitching a web

51
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:23,209
design service to a coaching

52
00:01:23,209 --> 00:01:24,189
program find ascension

53
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,299
I have a co-founder at this

54
00:01:25,299 --> 00:01:26,209
coaching program.

55
00:01:26,209 --> 00:01:27,120
That's my business partner video

56
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:27,599
on the screen

57
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:28,650
But I just want to show you a

58
00:01:28,659 --> 00:01:30,000
great example of what a new video

59
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,140
would look like once a prospect

60
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:31,659
said yes

61
00:01:31,659 --> 00:01:32,879
Send me the video, right?

62
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:33,739
There's a couple key things to

63
00:01:33,739 --> 00:01:34,060
know here

64
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:35,620
I'm gonna do the example video and

65
00:01:35,629 --> 00:01:37,269
I'm gonna go over why I said what

66
00:01:37,269 --> 00:01:37,739
I said

67
00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:50,459
So right there.

68
00:01:50,469 --> 00:01:51,670
I'm starting the video off.

69
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:52,989
Hey, thanks for responding to my

70
00:01:52,989 --> 00:01:53,840
email in this video

71
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,790
I'm gonna go over three things you

72
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:57,519
can do to accomplish X improve

73
00:01:57,719 --> 00:01:59,239
your website improve your emails

74
00:01:59,349 --> 00:02:00,079
improve your marketing

75
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:01,519
Whatever the case may be don't

76
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:03,359
waste time saying here's who I am.

77
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:04,239
Here's what I can do

78
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:05,359
Here's how I can help you

79
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:06,969
literally come in and say here are

80
00:02:06,969 --> 00:02:08,580
three things that you can do right

81
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,599
now to accomplish X

82
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:12,409
And then go into detail going over

83
00:02:12,409 --> 00:02:14,120
those three things which is the

84
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,919
bulk of this video and then wrap

85
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:17,280
up the video at the end

86
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,770
I'm wrapping up the video by

87
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:25,039
saying how does a call tomorrow or

88
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:27,900
thursday at 2 p.m.

89
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:28,819
Eastern work for you?

90
00:02:28,819 --> 00:02:30,740
So there's no gray area or

91
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:33,539
confusion from the prospect and it

92
00:02:33,539 --> 00:02:35,039
and they know exactly what the

93
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:35,680
next step is

94
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,180
To book a call with you to learn

95
00:02:37,289 --> 00:02:37,960
more, right?

96
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,169
So that's how you make a really

97
00:02:39,169 --> 00:02:39,860
well done video

98
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,669
And I have three examples of them

99
00:02:41,669 --> 00:02:43,340
for you to go through using the

100
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:45,419
doc in the description down below

101
00:02:45,849 --> 00:02:48,360
What happens once the video is

102
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,120
filmed?

103
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,669
How do you actually send it over

104
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,300
email to get somebody to open and

105
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:52,800
watch it?

106
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,520
Here's how

107
00:02:53,949 --> 00:03:00,449
So this just doesn't want to load

108
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:01,759
hold on

109
00:03:02,189 --> 00:03:04,759
All right, well, I'll just skip

110
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:05,319
ahead ready

111
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:07,210
This is all in the doc down below

112
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:08,659
if you want to go read it

113
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:12,080
Okay, so here we go, right?

114
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,819
Let's check out this script pulled

115
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:14,620
up in front of me

116
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,569
Here's the custom video I made for

117
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:16,990
you.

118
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:18,319
Just click the thumbnail below to

119
00:03:18,419 --> 00:03:18,740
view it

120
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:19,979
Actually say click the thumbnail

121
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,849
because people won't know what to

122
00:03:21,849 --> 00:03:23,610
do if you don't say that and then

123
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:23,969
I say

124
00:03:23,979 --> 00:03:26,139
You'll notice at the one minute 30

125
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:26,860
second mark

126
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,360
I discuss how to use vibrant

127
00:03:28,389 --> 00:03:29,659
colored backgrounds

128
00:03:29,659 --> 00:03:31,560
To boost your conversions and at

129
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,379
four minutes

130
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:33,960
You'll see how ugc videos can

131
00:03:33,979 --> 00:03:35,870
convert more customers from your

132
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:36,560
campaigns

133
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,780
Thumbnail of the video

134
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:40,120
Would you be open to a quick call

135
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,699
tomorrow or thursday at 2 p.m.

136
00:03:41,699 --> 00:03:42,180
Eastern?

137
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,439
If those times don't work, you can

138
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:45,759
pick a slot on my calendar

139
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:48,020
Here and that is how you send the

140
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:48,500
video

141
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,389
Over email to get people to open

142
00:03:50,389 --> 00:03:52,080
and click on it and watch it

143
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,580
And book a call with you

144
00:03:53,979 --> 00:03:55,780
What happens if they ghost the

145
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:57,319
video that you send?

146
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,419
How do you follow up?

147
00:03:58,939 --> 00:04:04,919
Here's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 templates

148
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:05,680
that you can use

149
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,469
So this doc down below is a full

150
00:04:07,469 --> 00:04:09,599
breakdown of how to make the video

151
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,280
How to send the video over email

152
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,930
how to follow up on the video how

153
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:13,599
to book a call

154
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:14,939
Everything you need to know about

155
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:16,439
what happens once the prospect

156
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:18,279
says yes, I would like a video

157
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:20,040
Is in this doc down below?

158
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,769
I'm not going to keep harping on

159
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:23,259
it because you can just go consume

160
00:04:23,259 --> 00:04:24,279
this doc on your own time

161
00:04:24,279 --> 00:04:26,230
But basically what i'm trying to

162
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,959
do is eliminate any scenario where

163
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:28,620
you don't know

164
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:30,350
How to proceed with a prospect or

165
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:32,180
a customer and i'm eliminating all

166
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,490
that self-doubt and just giving

167
00:04:33,589 --> 00:04:34,670
you the playbook step by step

168
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,930
So i'll see you on the next video
