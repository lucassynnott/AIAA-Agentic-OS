1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:01,620
What is going on guys?

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:02,859
Welcome back to part two of the

3
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:04,490
cold email training in this video

4
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:05,950
I want to go over the cold email

5
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:07,690
KPIs that you can expect from a

6
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:09,449
successful cold email campaign

7
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:10,720
Meaning if you're hitting all of

8
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:11,880
these metrics on the screen in

9
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,439
front of me, you are golden

10
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:14,849
You can scale that campaign as far

11
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:16,100
as you want and you are highly

12
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:18,390
profitable on your campaigns.

13
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:18,579
So

14
00:00:18,579 --> 00:00:20,370
Starting at the top of the funnel

15
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:21,109
open rate.

16
00:00:21,179 --> 00:00:22,640
I do not put a big emphasis on

17
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:23,739
open rate because

18
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,510
Tracking open rates puts you at

19
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:27,460
risk of being flagged by Microsoft

20
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:28,920
or Google as

21
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,359
Spam and you'll go to spam and not

22
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:31,679
deliver your emails anymore

23
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:32,399
because

24
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:33,820
This is from a technical

25
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,820
perspective.

26
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:36,149
I'm a copywriter, but this is what

27
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:37,020
I hear from my partners

28
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,490
If you track open rates, it puts a

29
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:41,380
line of code in your emails that

30
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:42,409
Microsoft or outlook

31
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:44,530
Can detect and flag you on which

32
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:45,840
will put you in spam

33
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,399
Is this 100% true?

34
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:48,979
I don't know but everything else

35
00:00:48,979 --> 00:00:50,600
on this chart if all these other

36
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,679
metrics are on point

37
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:53,479
That means that your open rate is

38
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,409
also on point.

39
00:00:54,409 --> 00:00:54,950
Therefore.

40
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:57,390
It is an insignificant metric to

41
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:57,829
track

42
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,710
Right, it's like if you're booking

43
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:01,299
two to four calls per a thousand

44
00:01:01,299 --> 00:01:01,960
prospects

45
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,829
Who cares what your open rate is?

46
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,790
You're you're seeing an roi you

47
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:06,840
can scale your campaigns.

48
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,420
Everything's good

49
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:10,269
So an open rate should be 50 to 60

50
00:01:10,269 --> 00:01:11,920
percent or higher on a good cold

51
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:12,810
email campaign

52
00:01:12,819 --> 00:01:14,709
But once again, I do not track

53
00:01:14,709 --> 00:01:15,019
opens

54
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:16,890
Many of my peers do not track

55
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:17,439
opens.

56
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:18,299
I would not recommend it

57
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:19,939
So open rates not important, but

58
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:20,700
let's move on

59
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,750
Total reply rate your total reply

60
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,810
rate of all prospects reached out

61
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:26,579
to should be between two to four

62
00:01:26,579 --> 00:01:28,159
percent of total prospects

63
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:28,879
contacted

64
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:30,650
Meaning if you're reaching out to

65
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:31,659
a thousand people

66
00:01:31,659 --> 00:01:33,859
You are getting 20 to 40 total

67
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:34,650
replies.

68
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:35,840
Even if they say no, thanks

69
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,939
unsubscribe f you screw off

70
00:01:37,939 --> 00:01:39,540
Doesn't matter because if your

71
00:01:39,549 --> 00:01:41,280
total reply rate is between two to

72
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,540
four percent or higher

73
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,099
That means that your emails are

74
00:01:44,099 --> 00:01:45,060
not going to spam.

75
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:45,840
They're being delivered

76
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,250
Um, and we just have to work on

77
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:48,719
the product market fit with the

78
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:50,239
copy in the audience, right?

79
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:51,439
Because even if i'm getting a

80
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:52,200
bunch of no thanks

81
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,049
That means people are opening the

82
00:01:54,049 --> 00:01:55,340
emails and seeing them

83
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:56,840
We just have to test new copy to

84
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,609
get them to say yes instead of no,

85
00:01:58,609 --> 00:01:58,859
right?

86
00:01:58,859 --> 00:02:00,459
So total reply rate is a really

87
00:02:00,469 --> 00:02:02,319
good indicator of deliverability

88
00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:04,090
and your domain health

89
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,150
um, even more so than open rate

90
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,400
People love to obsess over open

91
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:08,960
rate.

92
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,379
I personally don't care at all

93
00:02:10,379 --> 00:02:11,710
about my open rate as long as

94
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:13,330
these metrics are on point so

95
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,879
total positive

96
00:02:14,889 --> 00:02:16,939
Positive reply rate not the total

97
00:02:17,009 --> 00:02:18,789
reply rate the positive reply rate

98
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,430
Should be between 0.25 and 0.5

99
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:23,580
percent of all prospects contacted

100
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,210
Meaning if you're reaching out to

101
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,539
a thousand people a month

102
00:02:26,539 --> 00:02:28,169
You're getting three to five

103
00:02:28,229 --> 00:02:29,969
positive replies on the on the

104
00:02:29,969 --> 00:02:30,520
average

105
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,569
If you sell a no-brainer offer

106
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:34,360
like I have a podcast and I want

107
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,319
you to come on it

108
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:37,349
This is going to shoot up to three

109
00:02:37,349 --> 00:02:38,680
to five to ten percent of

110
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,710
prospects contacted are saying yes

111
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,939
And if you sell cyber security or

112
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:45,060
web design or branding this is

113
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,129
going to go down towards

114
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:49,120
0.1 to 0.2 percent where you're

115
00:02:49,129 --> 00:02:50,360
only getting one to two positive

116
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,719
replies per 1000 people contacted

117
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:54,479
So this range is realistically

118
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:56,259
anywhere from point one to you

119
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:56,580
know

120
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:57,300
five percent

121
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,360
but for most services and

122
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:00,169
businesses

123
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,069
That you know are in the

124
00:03:02,069 --> 00:03:02,840
marketplace.

125
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,360
It's between point two five and

126
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,569
zero point five percent

127
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,490
And then out of these replies

128
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,819
You're converting them to

129
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:09,919
meetings, right?

130
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:11,449
Because once a prospect responds

131
00:03:11,449 --> 00:03:11,659
yes

132
00:03:11,659 --> 00:03:13,289
That gives you permission to

133
00:03:13,289 --> 00:03:15,009
enroll them in your crm call the

134
00:03:15,009 --> 00:03:16,469
number in their signature pull up

135
00:03:16,469 --> 00:03:18,129
their linkedin profile and connect

136
00:03:18,129 --> 00:03:18,620
with them

137
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:21,009
Follow up with them 5 10 15 20

138
00:03:21,009 --> 00:03:22,479
times like when somebody says yes

139
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:24,349
You should be on them like a hawk

140
00:03:24,349 --> 00:03:25,439
every single day

141
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:27,159
Until they book a call with you

142
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:28,949
To the point where if you get five

143
00:03:28,969 --> 00:03:30,699
interested replies in a month

144
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:32,050
You should be booking two to three

145
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:32,349
of them

146
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:34,580
On a call and then from those two

147
00:03:34,669 --> 00:03:36,210
to four calls, you know, let's

148
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:37,719
hope two to three of them show up

149
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:40,229
And you're closing one deal per

150
00:03:40,229 --> 00:03:43,210
1000 prospects contacted as the

151
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,020
golden kpi

152
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:45,379
of cold email

153
00:03:45,379 --> 00:03:46,879
If you're closing one deal per

154
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,110
every 1000 people you're reaching

155
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:49,479
out to

156
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,620
You are roying at such a high clip

157
00:03:51,629 --> 00:03:53,879
that you can scale your cold email

158
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:55,419
campaigns to the moon

159
00:03:55,419 --> 00:03:57,210
And you will see that roi as the

160
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:59,569
campaign scale campaign scale very

161
00:03:59,569 --> 00:04:00,180
linearly

162
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:01,500
Um, you know, there's no

163
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,340
exponential growth curve or uh,

164
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,949
you know, your campaigns fall off

165
00:04:04,949 --> 00:04:05,259
a cliff

166
00:04:05,259 --> 00:04:06,680
If you reach out to a thousand

167
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:07,900
people and close a deal

168
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,210
You can pretty much safely assume

169
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:10,780
that you can reach out to 10 000

170
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,039
people and close 10 deals with the

171
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:13,539
same copy

172
00:04:13,539 --> 00:04:15,099
And the same audience that is the

173
00:04:15,099 --> 00:04:16,529
beautiful part of cold email is it

174
00:04:16,629 --> 00:04:18,319
scales very cleanly

175
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:20,370
Um and very predictably right

176
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:21,889
Because if you're closing a deal

177
00:04:21,889 --> 00:04:23,100
per a thousand prospects

178
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,680
That means your deliverability is

179
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,360
on point your copies on point

180
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,930
Your audience is on point your

181
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:29,240
list of leads is on point

182
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:30,540
um, and your

00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,449
Inbox management and appointment

184
00:04:32,449 --> 00:04:33,980

Biggest green light in the world

187

to scale your campaigns if you're

188
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:39,579
closing one deal

189

Per 1000 prospects contacted now

190
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:44,720
If you're meeting booked rate is

191
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,050
not up to speed.

192
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:47,339
This is an inbox management issue

193
00:04:47,339 --> 00:04:48,759
This is a sales issue because

194
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:50,079
you're getting leads in the door

195
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:51,529
people are saying yes, yes, yes

196
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,050
But you're not converting them

197
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:53,610
into calls

198
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:54,899
And we'll go over this later in

199
00:04:54,899 --> 00:04:56,079
the training how to convert

200
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:57,509
interested replies into booked

201
00:04:57,519 --> 00:04:58,920
meetings with follow-ups and loom

202
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,339
videos

203
00:04:59,339 --> 00:05:00,699
And linkedin connections and

204
00:05:00,699 --> 00:05:01,860
calling phone numbers and

205
00:05:01,949 --> 00:05:02,480
signatures

206
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:03,540
Um

207
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,709
If your positive reply rate is not

208
00:05:05,709 --> 00:05:07,939
up to speed, this is a copy issue

209
00:05:07,939 --> 00:05:09,290
You're just not pitching people

210
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:10,459
things that they want to buy

211
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,600
Um, and we'll talk about how to

212
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,000
fix this with lead magnets loom

213
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,680
videos free samples guarantees all

214
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,420
this fun stuff

215
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:17,839
ai personalization

216
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:20,290
If your total reply rate is not up

217
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:20,980
to speed

218
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:22,899
This is a deliverability issue

219
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,269
You're going to spam no one's

220
00:05:24,269 --> 00:05:25,209
seeing your emails

221
00:05:25,939 --> 00:05:27,220
Um, and you're just having a major

222
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,230
issue with deliverability

223
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,750
And this is fixable

224
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,959
By auditing your copy

225
00:05:32,019 --> 00:05:34,199
You don't want any links any html

226
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:36,120
Any photographs in your copy or

227
00:05:36,149 --> 00:05:37,560
your signature at all

228
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,970
Just plain text black text on

229
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:40,389
white background in gmail or

230
00:05:40,389 --> 00:05:41,000
outlook.

231
00:05:41,009 --> 00:05:41,439
That's it

232
00:05:42,139 --> 00:05:42,480
Um

233
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,899
And you want to make sure that

234
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:45,730
you're sending volume per inbox is

235
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:46,670
not too high

236
00:05:46,699 --> 00:05:48,860
I'll talk about the inbox rules in

237
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:50,579
the next video or my team and I

238
00:05:50,579 --> 00:05:51,459
will talk about it with you

239
00:05:51,459 --> 00:05:53,199
You don't want to send more than

240
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:54,980
20 emails per day per inbox

241
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,540
In cold email, right?

242
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:57,949
Some people will come to me saying

243
00:05:57,949 --> 00:05:59,509
hey, I sent 200 emails from one

244
00:05:59,509 --> 00:05:59,779
inbox

245
00:05:59,779 --> 00:06:00,759
Why am I going to spam?

246
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:02,170
Because you're sending way too

247
00:06:02,209 --> 00:06:03,279
much volume from

248
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:05,810
One single gmail inbox that google

249
00:06:05,889 --> 00:06:07,040
is like absolutely not

250
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,439
Go to spam jail.

251
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:09,350
You're not coming out.

252
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:10,649
Don't pass go don't collect 200

253
00:06:10,649 --> 00:06:11,100
bucks, right?

254
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:11,879
So

255
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:14,610
To recap if your total reply rate

256
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:16,199
is not up to speed deliverability

257
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:17,620
issue audit this with

258
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:18,579
Um

259
00:06:18,579 --> 00:06:20,329
Making sure that your copy is only

260
00:06:20,329 --> 00:06:22,040
plain text and your signature no

261
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:23,949
headshot photos in the signature

262
00:06:23,949 --> 00:06:24,339
at all

263
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,819
Um and don't overdo it with the

264
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:28,100
volume like if you go past the

265
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,360
speed limit google is going to put

266
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,480
you in jail and give you a ticket,

267
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:30,699
right?

268
00:06:30,699 --> 00:06:32,329
So you scale campaigns by

269
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:34,310
purchasing more domains setting up

270
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,839
more inboxes and warming them up

271
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:36,339
properly

272
00:06:36,339 --> 00:06:37,569
Which we'll talk about in later

273
00:06:37,569 --> 00:06:37,920
videos

274
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:39,769
Positive reply rate is a copy

275
00:06:39,769 --> 00:06:41,279
issue and a leads issue

276
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:42,860
because if you sell an hr software

277
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,149
and you're reaching out to

278
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,360
um, you know cmos and project

279
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:47,699
managers, you're not going to

280
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,740
convert if you have shitty copy

281
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:50,730
It's not going to convert.

282
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:51,939
So this is a product market fit

283
00:06:52,029 --> 00:06:52,259
issue

284
00:06:52,259 --> 00:06:53,990
Meeting book trade is a sales

285
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:55,850
issue and of course golden kpi of

286
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:57,620
cold email is also a sales issue

287
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,579
With show rate and you know offers

288
00:06:59,579 --> 00:07:01,060
made in closed deals.

289
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:01,220
So

290
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,589
Throughout these next couple

291
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:03,990
videos i'm going to go over every

292
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:05,189
single aspect of a cold email

293
00:07:05,189 --> 00:07:06,279
campaign that

294
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,100
Addresses all of these metrics,

295
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:08,680
right?

296
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,220
Like if your reply rate is low fix

297
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,779
this if your positive reply rate

298
00:07:11,779 --> 00:07:13,189
is low, here's how to fix your

299
00:07:13,189 --> 00:07:13,629
copy

300
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:14,800
Here's how to fix your inbox

301
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,439
management.

302
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,629
So we'll make sure that every

303
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:18,110
single aspect of this funnel is on

304
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:18,509
point

305
00:07:18,699 --> 00:07:21,000
Because if you close one deal

306
00:07:21,699 --> 00:07:23,720
rough math here, um

307
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,490
A thousand prospects contacted

308
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:27,720
costs around 120 dollars a month

309
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,569
so if you're closing a deal for

310
00:07:29,569 --> 00:07:30,839
120 per deal

311
00:07:31,579 --> 00:07:32,750
that is

312
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:34,389
An unheard of acquisition cost

313
00:07:34,449 --> 00:07:36,110
compared to ads compared to

314
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:37,589
content right the money that you

315
00:07:37,589 --> 00:07:38,860
would invest into other marketing

316
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:39,240
channels

317
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,850
So if you can hit this metric

318
00:07:40,939 --> 00:07:42,360
unless you're selling a service

319
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,560
that's literally 60 dollars

320
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,560
you are roying out

321
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,199
like

322
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,750
Like crazy from a cold email

323
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:49,529
campaign now

324
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:51,910
The cool part about cold email is

325
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,639
let's say this is one closed deal

326
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,439
per 4 000 people contacted

327
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:58,009
Which on paper you would be like

328
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,000
Dude, this is a horrible

329
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,930
conversion rate.

330
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:01,160
Why would I ever scale this?

331
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:01,480
Well

332
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,910
If you multiply 120 by 4 480

333
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,430
dollars a 480 dollar acquisition

334
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,060
cost is still pretty damn good

335
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:11,129
Better than paid ads unless you're

336
00:08:11,209 --> 00:08:11,949
crazy.

337
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:13,269
You have a crazy good ads funnel

338
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:14,860
So the beauty of cold email is you

339
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:16,420
have a lot of leeway here even if

340
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:17,720
campaigns don't convert at the

341
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,360
highest level

342
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,930
You can still see an incredible

343
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:21,500
return on your investment with

344
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,120
cold email

345
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,529
So i'm excited to dive into the

346
00:08:23,529 --> 00:08:24,959
rest of this training with you

347
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:25,240
guys

348
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,759
and kind of go over

349
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:28,720
What goes into a cold email

350
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,389
campaign with domains inboxes

351
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:32,690
warming them up sending tools copy

352
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:34,519
list of leads inbox management

353
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:35,480
offer creation

354
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:38,009
Lead magnet creation cold emails

355
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:39,298
tricky in 2025.

356
00:08:39,298 --> 00:08:39,879
It still works

357
00:08:39,879 --> 00:08:41,370
I want to show you why it still

358
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:42,788
works and in these next couple

359
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:43,158
videos

360
00:08:43,158 --> 00:08:45,220
You will see how to hit all of

361
00:08:45,289 --> 00:08:46,990
these kpis throughout the funnel

362
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:48,279
and hit the golden kpi

363
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:50,460
Of one closed deal per a thousand

364
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,129
leads if you're at one closed deal

365
00:08:52,129 --> 00:08:53,230
per 2 000 leads

366
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,250
You're probably still seeing an

367
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:57,210
roi 3 000 even 5 000 leads.

368
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:58,190
You're still seeing an roi

369
00:08:58,899 --> 00:09:01,000
Like for 10 000 prospects a month

370
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,039
you're paying a thousand dollars

371
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:03,090
if you're closing a deal for a

372
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:03,799
thousand dollars

373
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:05,399
That is still pretty damn good,

374
00:09:05,409 --> 00:09:06,669
but let's shoot for the stars here

375
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:07,899
Go for a closed deal per a

376
00:09:07,899 --> 00:09:09,629
thousand prospects and I will see

377
00:09:09,629 --> 00:09:11,559
you on the next video
