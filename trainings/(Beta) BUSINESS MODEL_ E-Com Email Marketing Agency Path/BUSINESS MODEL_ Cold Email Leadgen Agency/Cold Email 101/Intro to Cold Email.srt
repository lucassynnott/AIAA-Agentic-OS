1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:00,960
What's going on?

2
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,750
Welcome to the cold email section

3
00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:03,620
of AI clients.

4
00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:04,339
My name is Christian

5
00:00:04,339 --> 00:00:05,790
and I want to teach you everything

6
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:07,299
you need to know about cold email

7
00:00:07,469 --> 00:00:08,810
so you can use cold email

8
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:10,769
to sign your own clients and then

9
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:12,789
get clients results using cold

10
00:00:12,789 --> 00:00:13,449
email.

11
00:00:13,689 --> 00:00:14,619
That's the beauty of

12
00:00:14,619 --> 00:00:16,079
this service is you can use cold

13
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,579
email to grow your own business

14
00:00:17,579 --> 00:00:18,940
and then use that same skill

15
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:20,589
to help get your clients results.

16
00:00:20,589 --> 00:00:22,649
It's a very self-sufficient model.

17
00:00:22,649 --> 00:00:24,230
And for that reason,

18
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:26,250
if you're watching this, you're in

19
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:28,010
luck because you chose the best

20
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:29,480
skill to learn by far.

21
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,260
Yes, I'm very biased about this

22
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,259
because I run a cold email

23
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:33,520
business and I've done so

24
00:00:33,539 --> 00:00:34,950
for the past four years.

25
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:36,689
Um, but the beauty of cold email

26
00:00:36,689 --> 00:00:38,920
in all truthfulness is that it's

27
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,710
the most in demand service out of

28
00:00:40,759 --> 00:00:42,869
any marketing service in the game.

29
00:00:43,009 --> 00:00:44,539
You know, if it's a recession,

30
00:00:44,539 --> 00:00:46,060
a bull market, a bear market, a

31
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,789
depression, it literally doesn't

32
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:49,399
matter because every single

33
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:51,640
B2B business owner in the world

34
00:00:51,649 --> 00:00:53,740
needs leads and therefore they

35
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:55,859
need cold email services because

36
00:00:55,859 --> 00:00:57,539
I'm going to explain cold email to

37
00:00:57,539 --> 00:00:57,899
you.

38
00:00:57,899 --> 00:00:59,460
Um, as if you're hearing it for

39
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:00,329
the first time,

40
00:01:00,409 --> 00:01:02,109
which if you're watching this, you

41
00:01:02,109 --> 00:01:03,829
might be, but basically cold email

42
00:01:03,829 --> 00:01:04,870
helps businesses get

43
00:01:05,079 --> 00:01:06,530
in touch with other business

44
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:08,280
owners, um, who need what they

45
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:08,719
sell.

46
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:09,859
So let's dive in.

47
00:01:09,859 --> 00:01:10,120
First

48
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,680
of all, quick background on me.

49
00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:12,790
My name is Christian.

50
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:15,359
I'm a co-founder at a business

51
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:15,849
called client

52
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,980
Ascension, which is the parent

53
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:19,590
company of AI clients.

54
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:21,959
Um, and I'm also a co-founder at

55
00:01:21,969 --> 00:01:24,140
list kit, which is a B2B database

56
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:24,920
software.

57
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:26,930
And my only responsibility over

58
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:27,980
the past five

59
00:01:28,269 --> 00:01:30,939
years has been helping, you know,

60
00:01:31,109 --> 00:01:33,140
clients and students and

61
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:35,469
consulting clients and my own

62
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:37,200
businesses do cold email

63
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:38,599
effectively at scale.

64
00:01:38,769 --> 00:01:40,780
Um, so I've literally done cold

65
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:41,739
email for four

66
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,629
years in a row.

67
00:01:42,629 --> 00:01:44,450
It's basically, you know, like

68
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:46,209
riding a bike at this point, I can

69
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:46,780
look at,

70
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:48,129
I can look at a cold email

71
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:50,049
strategy and dissect it and break

72
00:01:50,049 --> 00:01:51,700
it down and fix it and make it

73
00:01:51,969 --> 00:01:52,209
better.

74
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:53,609
So not to toot my own horn, but

75
00:01:53,609 --> 00:01:55,129
there are very few people in this

76
00:01:55,189 --> 00:01:56,019
world that are more

77
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,049
qualified to teach you cold email

78
00:01:58,049 --> 00:01:58,980
than myself.

79
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:01,180
Um, am I a nerd about this stuff?

80
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:02,340
Do I geek out on it a

81
00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:03,769
little bit transparently, but

82
00:02:03,769 --> 00:02:05,239
you're going to learn everything

83
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:06,810
that I know, you know, across four

84
00:02:07,269 --> 00:02:08,590
years of trial and error and

85
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:10,500
working with clients and growing

86
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:12,439
my own business condensed into a

87
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:13,180
30 minute

88
00:02:13,219 --> 00:02:15,240
or probably an hour long module of

89
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:15,889
videos.

90
00:02:15,889 --> 00:02:17,689
So what is cold email, right?

91
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:19,419
The whole point of this intro

92
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,039
video is to introduce you to the

93
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:22,379
model of cold email in and of

94
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:23,889
itself and why it's so important

95
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:26,219
and why every business needs it.

96
00:02:26,219 --> 00:02:27,969
So the example I like to give a

97
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:30,280
lot of the time is Wolf of Wall

98
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:30,759
Street.

99
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:32,400
You're probably seeing the movie.

100
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,900
If you haven't go watch it, Jordan

101
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:34,750
Belfort, the main

102
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:36,610
character picks up the phone and

103
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:38,240
dials people all day to get them

104
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,060
interested in his stock services

105
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:40,319
and

106
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:41,770
sell, you know, he's selling

107
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:43,520
people, penny stocks through phone

108
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,000
calls and he picks up the phone.

109
00:02:45,419 --> 00:02:46,740
Hey Margie, this is Jordan Belfort

110
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:47,050
here.

111
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:48,199
Are you looking to invest in the

112
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:48,919
stock market?

113
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:49,370
I have a

114
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,360
winning penny stock that is going

115
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,379
to boom in the next couple months.

116
00:02:53,379 --> 00:02:55,360
Um, that is a cold call, right?

117
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,580
He's picking up the phone and

118
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:57,699
calling people to get them

119
00:02:57,699 --> 00:02:59,310
interested in what he's selling.

120
00:02:59,449 --> 00:03:00,840
Cold email is

121
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,389
very similar to cold calling,

122
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,139
except of course it's over email,

123
00:03:04,139 --> 00:03:05,639
not over the phone, right?

124
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:06,060
You're

125
00:03:06,349 --> 00:03:07,849
actually emailing people, getting

126
00:03:07,849 --> 00:03:09,340
them interested in what you and

127
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:10,819
your clients are selling.

128
00:03:10,819 --> 00:03:12,949
Who does cold email work for?

129
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:15,289
It works for any B2B business in

130
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:16,340
the world.

131
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:17,979
Any business that helps

132
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:20,430
other businesses can benefit from

133
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:21,409
cold email.

134
00:03:21,469 --> 00:03:23,539
You can't email Nancy down the

135
00:03:23,539 --> 00:03:25,120
road and sell her a

136
00:03:25,409 --> 00:03:27,250
penny stock strategy like Jordan

137
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,069
Belfort used to do, but you can

138
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:31,460
email Tom at his business email to

139
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:31,620
get

140
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:34,050
him interested in your clients,

141
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:36,460
um, remote controls, right?

142
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:38,889
So we literally have clients that

143
00:03:38,889 --> 00:03:39,090
sell

144
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:41,400
physical products like French

145
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,479
fries, gazebos, t-shirts,

146
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:44,360
trophies.

147
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,080
Um, and then we also have

148
00:03:46,409 --> 00:03:48,319
clients that sell email marketing,

149
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,460
copywriting, video production,

150
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:51,389
consulting.

151
00:03:51,389 --> 00:03:52,319
So you can help

152
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:54,330
literally any B2B business owner

153
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:56,139
in the world with this service,

154
00:03:56,139 --> 00:03:57,659
which is good news for you

155
00:03:57,949 --> 00:03:58,870
because there will never be a

156
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:00,240
shortage of clients that you can

157
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:00,860
work with.

158
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,099
And there will never be a

159
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:04,030
shortage of opportunity in the

160
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:05,699
world for what you sell.

161
00:04:05,699 --> 00:04:08,120
So with that being said, let's

162
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:08,819
dive into the

163
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:09,900
fundamentals of cold email and

164
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,159
what does it actually look like?

165
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:14,159
Are you sending emails one by one

166
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:14,400
for

167
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,650
your clients all day on the

168
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:17,189
keyboard and Gmail to get them,

169
00:04:17,189 --> 00:04:18,870
you know, to get them new leads?

170
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:19,540
No,

171
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:21,810
you're using automations and AI

172
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:24,009
and softwares and tools that are

173
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,519
built specifically for cold email

174
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:28,069
so that you can send a thousand

175
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:30,379
emails a day for your client, 2000

176
00:04:30,379 --> 00:04:32,100
emails a day for your client and

177
00:04:32,389 --> 00:04:34,370
deliver them five new leads, 10

178
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:36,420
new leads, two new leads a day.

179
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:37,680
Um, and the name of the game for

180
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,329
you is to get people interested in

181
00:04:40,339 --> 00:04:42,970
what your clients are selling.

182
00:04:43,009 --> 00:04:44,579
So here's an example.

183
00:04:44,579 --> 00:04:45,060
Let's

184
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,790
say you sign a client and they're

185
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:48,680
a marketing company or a marketing

186
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,279
company, a marker company,

187
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:52,800
and they want to get their markers

188
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,699
into more businesses.

189
00:04:54,699 --> 00:04:56,220
Hey Christian.

190
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,860
Um, I have a marketing.

191
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:00,139
I said marketing again, I have a

192
00:05:00,139 --> 00:05:02,250
marker company and I want more

193
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:04,230
school districts to use my

194
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:05,160
markers.

195
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,160
Can you help me?

196
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,610
You would go, Hey, Mr.

197
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,560
Prospect, I can help you reach out

198
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,920
to 10,000 schools every

199
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,389
single month to get them

200
00:05:13,389 --> 00:05:15,250
interested in your markers.

201
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,430
He would go amazing.

202
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:17,639
How much is this

203
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:18,730
going to cost me?

204
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:20,769
You would go nothing up front.

205
00:05:20,769 --> 00:05:22,610
You only pay me for every sales

206
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:23,680
call that I book

207
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,540
on your calendar.

208
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:25,689
So if I don't deliver you the

209
00:05:25,689 --> 00:05:27,110
result that you want, which is new

210
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:28,100
sales conversations

211
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,740
and new leads, you don't pay me.

212
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:30,889
Does that sound fair?

213
00:05:30,889 --> 00:05:32,500
He's going to go, yes, that sounds

214
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:32,819
great.

215
00:05:32,829 --> 00:05:33,040
Let's

216
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,129
get started right away.

217
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:35,480
And that is the great part about

218
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,839
cold email is you can sell it on

219
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:37,360
performance

220
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,079
only and get people interested in

221
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:39,939
your service.

222
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:41,529
Even if you're watching this at

223
00:05:41,529 --> 00:05:43,560
18, 19, 20 years old

224
00:05:43,589 --> 00:05:45,339
with no past experience, no

225
00:05:45,339 --> 00:05:47,399
results, no case studies to show

226
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:49,600
for it, you can still generate new

227
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,060
business

228
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,490
because people will put their

229
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:52,189
trust in you.

230
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:53,699
If they're not having to pay you

231
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:55,250
anything upfront to get

232
00:05:55,259 --> 00:05:56,350
that campaign started.

233
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:57,850
Hopefully that makes sense.

234
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:00,990
Um, the marker is a very practical

235
00:06:01,089 --> 00:06:01,519
example

236
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:03,480
because let's say you reach out to

237
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,029
a thousand schools a day.

238
00:06:05,089 --> 00:06:05,790
Hey, Mr.

239
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:07,360
School, um, I'm a marker

240
00:06:07,379 --> 00:06:08,430
company and I can provide new

241
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:09,829
markers for each of your students.

242
00:06:09,829 --> 00:06:11,310
Would you like to see our catalog?

243
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:12,879
That's a very easy idea to

244
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,160
understand in your head, right?

245
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,939
Another example that's less easy

246
00:06:17,939 --> 00:06:18,079
to

247
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:20,180
understand a little bit more of a

248
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:22,379
complex topic is let's say someone

249
00:06:22,379 --> 00:06:24,779
sells email marketing services to

250
00:06:24,779 --> 00:06:25,870
e-commerce brands.

251
00:06:25,949 --> 00:06:27,449
You can run a campaign for your

252
00:06:27,449 --> 00:06:28,910
email marketing client that

253
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:30,509
reaches out to 10,000

254
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,019
e-commerce brands a month to get

255
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,500
them interested in their email

256
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,160
marketing.

257
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,649
And you'll notice the other

258
00:06:35,949 --> 00:06:37,620
courses or the other paths in this

259
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,439
course are services that could

260
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:41,180
benefit from your cold email

261
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:41,779
services,

262
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:43,649
which is the beauty of cold email.

263
00:06:43,649 --> 00:06:45,389
Once again, is you can help every

264
00:06:45,389 --> 00:06:47,879
other person in this AI clients

265
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:48,540
community.

266
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:50,009
That's not doing cold email.

267
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,620
Christian, if somebody is selling

268
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,540
email marketing,

269
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:53,459
why would they need my email

270
00:06:53,459 --> 00:06:53,889
services?

271
00:06:53,899 --> 00:06:55,100
They already know how to do email,

272
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:55,420
right?

273
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:56,490
Wrong because

274
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,000
cold email and email marketing are

275
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,100
very different things.

276
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,529
Email marketing is a service for

277
00:07:01,529 --> 00:07:02,459
e-commerce

278
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,480
brands and coaches and software

279
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,730
companies, um, to help them, you

280
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:08,540
know, sell more stuff to their

281
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:09,019
existing

282
00:07:09,019 --> 00:07:09,319
customers.

283
00:07:09,339 --> 00:07:10,980
Kith, a great brand that I love

284
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:12,660
wearing wouldn't need an email

285
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:15,019
marketing company to send emails

286
00:07:15,019 --> 00:07:15,420
to their

287
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:17,550
existing customers like me to sell

288
00:07:17,589 --> 00:07:19,370
new products that come out.

289
00:07:19,509 --> 00:07:21,100
So if Kith releases a new line of

290
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:21,620
t-shirts

291
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:22,860
and they want to sell more

292
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,550
t-shirts to their customers, they

293
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:26,459
would hire an email marketing team

294
00:07:26,459 --> 00:07:28,589
to email those customers, which is

295
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,569
very, very different from a cold

296
00:07:30,569 --> 00:07:32,660
email campaign where you're

297
00:07:32,709 --> 00:07:33,220
reaching out

298
00:07:33,259 --> 00:07:35,680
to brand new people to try to get

299
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,860
them interested in your client's

300
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:38,139
services, right?

301
00:07:38,139 --> 00:07:38,939
Email marketing

302
00:07:38,939 --> 00:07:40,839
is designed to reach out to an

303
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:42,889
existing list of customers.

304
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:45,069
Cold email is designed to reach

305
00:07:45,069 --> 00:07:45,579
out to,

306
00:07:45,579 --> 00:07:47,560
a list of new people that have

307
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,529
never heard of your client's

308
00:07:49,529 --> 00:07:50,769
business before

309
00:07:50,779 --> 00:07:52,759
and, you know, trying to get them

310
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:54,730
interested in what your client

311
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:55,490
sells.

312
00:07:55,509 --> 00:07:56,459
So like I said,

313
00:07:56,459 --> 00:07:57,839
you're going to use cold email to

314
00:07:57,839 --> 00:07:59,300
sign your first couple of clients

315
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,779
and then you're going to use cold

316
00:08:00,779 --> 00:08:01,870
email to get your client's

317
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:02,430
results.

318
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:03,740
And it's like a snowball effect

319
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:05,660
that just keeps trickling up.

320
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,920
Three years ago, 2022 was when I

321
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,060
first started my cold email agency

322
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:11,980
and we signed all of our clients

323
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:13,769
from cold email and then we got

324
00:08:13,819 --> 00:08:15,899
them results using cold email.

325
00:08:15,899 --> 00:08:17,709
So if you master the craft of cold

326
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:18,060
email,

327
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,519
which you won't even really have

328
00:08:19,589 --> 00:08:20,889
to do because the AI workflows

329
00:08:20,889 --> 00:08:22,459
that we have will help you do it.

330
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:24,959
You're a self-sufficient business

331
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:26,139
owner for the rest of your life.

332
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:27,170
You will never

333
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:28,589
find or have trouble finding new

334
00:08:28,589 --> 00:08:29,939
clients and you will never have

335
00:08:29,939 --> 00:08:31,420
trouble getting results for your

336
00:08:31,709 --> 00:08:32,629
existing clients.

337
00:08:32,629 --> 00:08:34,580
And that compound effect just goes

338
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,460
up and up and up into infinity.

339
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:37,149
That's the beauty of

340
00:08:37,179 --> 00:08:37,899
cold email.

341
00:08:37,899 --> 00:08:39,580
In these next couple videos, I'm

342
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:41,080
going to show you how to write a

343
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,139
good cold email because

344
00:08:42,139 --> 00:08:43,538
you can't get results if you don't

345
00:08:43,538 --> 00:08:45,039
know how to write good messaging.

346
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:46,379
I'm going to show you how to get a

347
00:08:46,379 --> 00:08:47,789
list of leads because if you need

348
00:08:47,789 --> 00:08:49,669
to build a list of 10,000 leads

349
00:08:49,669 --> 00:08:51,019
for your clients, you're going to

350
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:51,340
need a

351
00:08:51,629 --> 00:08:52,799
software that has email leads.

352
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:54,259
And then I'm going to show you how

353
00:08:54,259 --> 00:08:55,659
to automate the entire setup

354
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:59,340
with a sending tool, with inboxes,

355
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:01,820
with domains, and basically build

356
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,659
the correct infrastructure

357
00:09:03,659 --> 00:09:05,110
to actually send a thousand emails

358
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:05,450
a day.

359
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,379
Because guess what?

360
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,419
You're going to need to set up

361
00:09:07,419 --> 00:09:07,580
some

362
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:09,710
pretty in-depth technology stuff

363
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,769
if you want to contact a thousand

364
00:09:11,769 --> 00:09:13,740
new people a day consistently

365
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:14,769
from cold email.

366
00:09:14,769 --> 00:09:16,690
So don't, you know, don't panic,

367
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:17,659
don't stress out.

368
00:09:17,659 --> 00:09:18,620
I'm going to show you everything

369
00:09:18,629 --> 00:09:20,710
from a very beginner standpoint as

370
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:22,570
if I was, you know, I'm going to

371
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:24,220
film this as if I'm watching

372
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:25,639
it for the first time in my life

373
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:27,059
four years ago and I'm going to

374
00:09:27,059 --> 00:09:28,460
speak through that lens.

375
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:29,100
So it's like

376
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:29,730
very basic.

377
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:30,879
And you know, if I was just

378
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:32,409
starting out, I would comprehend

379
00:09:32,409 --> 00:09:33,570
it because I want you to

380
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,710
understand this skill on a basic

381
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:37,840
level and you know, learn it and

382
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,659
get good enough at it so you can

383
00:09:39,659 --> 00:09:40,139
go out and

384
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:41,929
build your business to a hundred K

385
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,600
a month is where we reached with

386
00:09:43,629 --> 00:09:44,610
our email agency.

387
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:46,860
So sit tight, lock in.

388
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:47,769
These next couple of videos are

389
00:09:47,769 --> 00:09:48,820
going to teach you everything you

390
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,299
need to know about cold email.

391
00:09:50,299 --> 00:09:51,759
And let's start out with

392
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,279
copywriting and how to write a

393
00:09:53,429 --> 00:09:54,539
good cold email, because that's my

394
00:09:54,539 --> 00:09:54,769
favorite

395
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:55,669
topic to teach.

396
00:09:55,669 --> 00:09:57,200
And it's the most important topic

397
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,460
to understand if you want to

398
00:09:58,460 --> 00:09:59,899
become good at this skill.

399
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:00,590
Let's go.
