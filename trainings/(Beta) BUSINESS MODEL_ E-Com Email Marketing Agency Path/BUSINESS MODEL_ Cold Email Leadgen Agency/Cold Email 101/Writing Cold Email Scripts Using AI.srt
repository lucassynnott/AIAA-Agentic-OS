1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,700
Okay, I'm going to show you in

2
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:03,470
this video how to use AI to create

3
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:05,530
a three-step email sequence with a

4
00:00:05,589 --> 00:00:06,730
few simple inputs

5
00:00:06,769 --> 00:00:09,750
this AI is trained on hundreds of

6
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:09,990
my

7
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,890
Cold email scripts over the past

8
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:13,939
couple years and my screen is

9
00:00:13,939 --> 00:00:14,730
frozen.

10
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:16,149
So I'm gonna fix that real quick

11
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:17,920
before we dive in so

12
00:00:18,429 --> 00:00:19,839
Okay, great.

13
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:22,079
So basically this AI dashboard has

14
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:23,570
a bunch of really cool tools that

15
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,679
you can use to create cold emails

16
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:26,949
sales call reviews

17
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,800
Get offer creation input chat with

18
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,140
my CEO Andre on operations chat

19
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:33,219
with Daniel on offers

20
00:00:33,229 --> 00:00:34,450
Basically a bunch of different

21
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:35,579
cool tools that you can use to

22
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:36,759
build your business with AI

23
00:00:36,759 --> 00:00:38,609
But the focus of this video is

24
00:00:38,609 --> 00:00:40,380
going to be on the cold email

25
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:41,079
creation

26
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:43,530
Chat or bot or whatever you want

27
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:44,320
to call it

28
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,270
So basically all you have to do is

29
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:48,140
tell it what you're selling what

30
00:00:48,219 --> 00:00:49,340
your audience is

31
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:51,100
What's your background and what's

32
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:52,990
your campaign preferences and also

33
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:54,399
I'm gonna say is this I?

34
00:00:56,119 --> 00:00:57,689
I noticed my box is actually in

35
00:00:57,689 --> 00:00:58,329
the way.

36
00:00:58,340 --> 00:00:59,350
Let me see if I can

37
00:00:59,909 --> 00:01:03,340
Okay, there we go.

38
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:05,640
So I'll leave the bar down below.

39
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,079
That's fine

40
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,569
But basically what I'm gonna do is

41
00:01:07,569 --> 00:01:09,280
let's start with the content

42
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,040
creation

43
00:01:10,549 --> 00:01:12,450
Agency path.

44
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:15,000
I run a LinkedIn content

45
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:18,060
agency

46
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:21,040
Helping CEOs builds authority on

47
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,459
LinkedIn with long-form

48
00:01:24,989 --> 00:01:26,950
posts

49
00:01:27,469 --> 00:01:28,959
and

50
00:01:29,469 --> 00:01:30,359
video

51
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:33,090
Contents I handle all of the

52
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:35,790
content creation and

53
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:40,200
Distribution for them I post

54
00:01:40,709 --> 00:01:45,200
Everything on

55
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,260
There be half okay?

56
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:49,260
Okay

57
00:01:49,769 --> 00:01:56,340
My best case study is helping

58
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,260
Andre from list kit close 10

59
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:01,920
clients in one month on LinkedIn

60
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:06,900
And I prefer to offer a video

61
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,000
going over a LinkedIn

62
00:02:09,508 --> 00:02:12,500
Strategy I had in mind for them

63
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:12,729
and

64
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:15,479
Then this AI will

65
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:18,939
Create a three-step email sequence

66
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:20,699
for whatever you want to sell

67
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:22,960
Obviously, you're gonna have to

68
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,750
use your own

69
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:25,879
Critical thinking and input to

70
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:27,460
make this better, but this is

71
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:28,469
going to give you a really well

72
00:02:28,469 --> 00:02:29,969
done email sequence

73
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:34,620
Or a lot of varieties of different

74
00:02:34,659 --> 00:02:35,419
email sequences

75
00:02:35,969 --> 00:02:39,879
That you can use so please make

76
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:42,280
this a three-step email sequence

77
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,460
With a be testing for each angle

78
00:02:53,469 --> 00:02:56,610
Great one C 1d email 2 great.

79
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:59,639
So with any AI the outputs are

80
00:02:59,689 --> 00:03:00,599
only as good as the inputs

81
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:01,550
So make sure that it's a

82
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:03,050
three-step email sequence because

83
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:04,280
I always prefer to do three-step

84
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,759
email sequences with my campaigns

85
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:07,180
You're free to do whatever you

86
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:07,580
want.

87
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:08,599
There are no rules to this game

88
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:10,800
But I like to do three steps.

89
00:03:10,819 --> 00:03:13,330
So email 1a LinkedIn authority for

90
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:13,710
CEOs.

91
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:14,650
Are you getting enough qualified

92
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:15,659
leads from LinkedIn right now?

93
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:17,259
We help CEOs build authority with

94
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:18,659
long-form post and content

95
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:20,330
handling all content creation and

96
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:21,479
posting on your behalf

97
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:23,479
Andre from LinkedIn closed 10

98
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:24,699
clients in one month

99
00:03:24,699 --> 00:03:26,560
Mind if I share a video going over

100
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,280
a LinkedIn strategy I had in mind

101
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:28,530
for you

102
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:31,259
Great CEO LinkedIn content done

103
00:03:31,259 --> 00:03:31,650
for you

104
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,099
Most CEOs struggle to consistently

105
00:03:33,099 --> 00:03:34,330
create LinkedIn content while

106
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:35,889
running their business want to see

107
00:03:35,889 --> 00:03:37,039
a video outlining the LinkedIn

108
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:38,560
strategy 10 clients from LinkedIn

109
00:03:38,659 --> 00:03:40,689
Right, so like this sequence is

110
00:03:40,689 --> 00:03:42,759
very very good all from a simple

111
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:44,409
input that I gave it.

112
00:03:44,409 --> 00:03:44,979
So now

113
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,990
All I'm gonna do is move it to a

114
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:49,469
Google Doc and

115
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:52,539
paste it in here

116
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,770
obviously clear up the formatting

117
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:54,560
because it looks like

118
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:57,300
Shit right now

119
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:59,300
Okay, cool

120
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,900
Now I'm gonna make some changes to

121
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,580
the subject lines LinkedIn content

122
00:04:02,689 --> 00:04:02,900
for

123
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:05,159
First name this will make it say

124
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:06,840
LinkedIn content for Christian Tom

125
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,330
Steven.

126
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:08,189
It'll pull in the actual name

127
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,860
Hey, Tom, are you getting enough

128
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:10,689
qualified leads from LinkedIn

129
00:04:10,689 --> 00:04:11,060
right now?

130
00:04:11,569 --> 00:04:14,740
I prefer to say we can help you

131
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:16,569
instead of we can help CEOs we can

132
00:04:16,699 --> 00:04:17,550
help you build authority on

133
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:19,370
LinkedIn with long-form posts and

134
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:20,089
video content

135
00:04:20,649 --> 00:04:22,610
We handle

136
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:26,620
All content creation and posting

137
00:04:26,689 --> 00:04:27,100
on your behalf

138
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:33,290
Fake I made up this case study my

139
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:35,199
business partners Andre Andre from

140
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,000
list kit close 10 clients in one

141
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,819
month after we started

142
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:39,339
Started managing his LinkedIn

143
00:04:39,339 --> 00:04:40,569
presence mind if I share a video

144
00:04:40,569 --> 00:04:41,550
going over a strategy ahead of

145
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:42,000
mine for you

146
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,449
That's a good angle, right?

147
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:44,560
Really good angle all from AI in

148
00:04:44,589 --> 00:04:45,279
the click of a button

149
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:50,000
Df y LinkedIn content

150
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,170
Most CEOs struggle to consistently

151
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:53,980
create LinkedIn content we handle

152
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:54,899
all creation and distribution

153
00:04:54,899 --> 00:04:57,259
For busy executives long-form

154
00:04:57,259 --> 00:04:57,899
posts.

155
00:04:57,899 --> 00:04:58,720
Okay, great.

156
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,920
Good, right?

157
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:00,879
So like you guys can see

158
00:05:01,389 --> 00:05:02,379
that

159
00:05:02,379 --> 00:05:04,209
The AI is going to output you a

160
00:05:04,209 --> 00:05:06,370
script sequence that is so close

161
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:07,829
to being perfect that it's

162
00:05:07,829 --> 00:05:09,769
actually insane not to toot my own

163
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:09,879
horn

164
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:11,410
It's trained on my writing.

165
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:12,930
So it comes out pretty damn good.

166
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,800
Um, but like

167
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:17,740
You don't really need to make too

168
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,019
many changes to what it gives you

169
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,779
if you have a good prompt LinkedIn

170
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:22,259
company name X list kit

171
00:05:22,769 --> 00:05:24,860
intro I

172
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:26,589
Would actually change up this

173
00:05:26,589 --> 00:05:29,180
angle completely we can help you

174
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,740
sign five clients from LinkedIn

175
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:35,339
fully guaranteed with

176
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:39,480
Authority LinkedIn content posted

177
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:40,560
for you I

178
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,910
I don't like these subject lines

179
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:44,509
to be fair.

180
00:05:44,509 --> 00:05:45,790
So I would switch up the subject

181
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:46,680
lines in this case

182
00:05:47,189 --> 00:05:48,680
I

183
00:05:49,189 --> 00:05:54,180
Don't know why they're doing a dot

184
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:58,649
instead of a hyphen here, but I'm

185
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:02,990
just making sure that looks good

186
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:05,810
Okay.

187
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:07,740
I mean like if you're doing the

188
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,420
the lead generation path like this

189
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,519
AI will literally knock

190
00:06:11,529 --> 00:06:14,470
The time of your work like when

191
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:15,680
you sign a client if you're

192
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,660
running a legion agency and you

193
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:18,009
have to write them a new email

194
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:18,399
sequence

195
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,379
This AI will cut that curve from

196
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:22,290
an hour to five minutes, right?

197
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,699
If you're in the other paths and

198
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:25,220
you're just looking to write your

199
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:25,839
own scripts

200
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:27,959
This AI will be helpful.

201
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:29,069
Um, but you're probably not gonna

202
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,279
have to rely on it super often

203
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:31,959
because you're only doing outreach

204
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:33,339
to sign your own clients

205
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,529
The legion path the whole business

206
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,209
model is running campaigns for

207
00:06:37,209 --> 00:06:38,740
clients for the other paths

208
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:40,319
You're only doing outreach for

209
00:06:40,329 --> 00:06:41,360
your own campaigns

210
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:44,300
So this bot is gonna be most

211
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,839
effective for people running a

212
00:06:45,899 --> 00:06:47,509
legion agency cold email, but if

213
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,180

214
00:06:48,689 --> 00:06:50,639
Another agency path you can still

215
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,089
benefit from using this AI to test

216
00:06:53,089 --> 00:06:55,180
different angles, right?

similar three-step email sequence

219
00:07:04,029 --> 00:07:07,250
For a professional I want to try

220
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:08,810
to confuse the AI to see if it can

221
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:09,670
really overcome

222
00:07:09,699 --> 00:07:11,610

Pitch a tickle video in the call

00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:36,829
to action.

235
00:07:36,829 --> 00:07:37,899
I want to see if I can throw a

236
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:39,449
wrench in the AI is thinking and

237
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:40,579

beginner mode of AI

because you're gonna live in this

280

00:08:52,139 --> 00:08:53,279
write new scripts for each of your

282
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:54,899
clients if you're following the

283
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:55,940
email marketing path or

284
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:58,370
The content path or something

285
00:08:58,389 --> 00:09:00,200
similar this is gonna be you know

286
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,250
A little bit less relevant for you

287
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,289
because you're not going to use it

288
00:09:02,289 --> 00:09:03,740
as much, but it will still help

289
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:05,070
you write really good outreach

290
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:05,480

outreach.

293
00:09:08,049 --> 00:09:09,210
So hopefully this helped in the

294
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:10,039
next video

295
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:11,340
I'm gonna be going into a much

296
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,039
more advanced

297
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:14,519
AI workflow that can help you

298
00:09:14,629 --> 00:09:16,159
write cold email scripts that are

299
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:18,059
personalized to every single

300
00:09:18,059 --> 00:09:19,960
person in your list of leads

301
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,059
This AI is gonna be a lot more

302
00:09:22,059 --> 00:09:23,690
in-depth and it's gonna take a big

303
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:24,360
learning curve

304
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,980
But once you master it you can

305
00:09:26,049 --> 00:09:26,360
write

306
00:09:27,509 --> 00:09:28,710
personalized emails to every

307
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:30,580
prospect because clearly these are

308
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:32,149
not personalized to everyone in

309
00:09:32,149 --> 00:09:32,649
your list

310
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:34,370
They're just templated blanket

311
00:09:34,379 --> 00:09:36,279
statements that will still work.

312
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:37,559
Well, but they're not

313
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:40,029
They're not personalized to every

314
00:09:40,149 --> 00:09:40,799
person.

315
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,559
So in the next video

316
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:42,919
I'm gonna show you how to write

317
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:44,720
personalized ones for every single

318
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,720
prospect in the list.

00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,440
See you in the next video
