1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,720
All right.

2
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:02,680
So last video, I went over theory

3
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:04,719
around cold email, like giving you

4
00:00:04,719 --> 00:00:05,620
my philosophies

5
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:06,990
of how cold email works.

6
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:08,660
In this video, I want to show you

7
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:10,240
cold email applied to a real

8
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:10,820
campaign

9
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:12,939
for three different businesses

10
00:00:12,939 --> 00:00:14,500
that have all generated

11
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,100
significantly effective results.

12
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:17,420
So

13
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:18,859
pulled up in front of me is a real

14
00:00:18,859 --> 00:00:20,239
estate marketing campaign.

15
00:00:20,379 --> 00:00:21,940
Basically, we have a client that

16
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:22,199
sells

17
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:23,940
marketing services to real estate

18
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:24,359
agents.

19
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:26,160
And this is brand new for you, I'm

20
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:26,679
aware.

21
00:00:26,679 --> 00:00:28,079
So what we have

22
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:30,059
here is total number of emails

23
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:32,060
sent 45,000.

24
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:35,090
We've generated 433 total replies,

25
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:36,280
which is around

26
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,259
3% reply rate, which is really

27
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:38,979
strong.

28
00:00:38,979 --> 00:00:40,960
Anything above one to 2% reply

29
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,439
rate is really good.

30
00:00:42,439 --> 00:00:45,899
Out of those 433, we have 189

31
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:48,200
positive replies, which is

32
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,450
phenomenal.

33
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:51,939
It's an, it's an outstanding

34
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:52,490
result.

35
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:54,710
So we've reached out to 15,000

36
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:55,250
people.

37
00:00:55,259 --> 00:00:56,869
Each person has received three

38
00:00:56,869 --> 00:00:57,939
emails, which is

39
00:00:57,939 --> 00:00:59,920
why the total email metric on the

40
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,729
last page was around 45,000.

41
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:05,180
And we have 189 unique positive

42
00:01:05,659 --> 00:01:07,159
replies, which is incredible.

43
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,959
So if we come down here, we can

44
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:10,799
see all the different variants

45
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:10,980
that

46
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,599
I'm currently testing.

47
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:13,739
A, B, C, and D.

48
00:01:13,739 --> 00:01:15,689
Like you see pulled up in front of

49
00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:17,219
you, A, B, C, and D.

50
00:01:18,219 --> 00:01:21,150
And it looks like email 1B has 37

51
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,939
unique positive replies, which is

52
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:26,299
a clear winner because the other

53
00:01:26,299 --> 00:01:28,439
ones have seven, 22, 17.

54
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:30,099
So I want to show you guys what a

55
00:01:30,099 --> 00:01:31,959
winning cold email angle looks

56
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:32,239
like

57
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:33,799
in the real world to real people

58
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:35,049
getting real results.

59
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:36,609
And here it is pulled up in front

60
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:37,019
of me.

61
00:01:37,019 --> 00:01:39,170
Hey, Mark, we've helped hundreds

62
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:40,750
of real estate investors find

63
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:42,540
motivated sellers over the past

64
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:43,200
five years.

65
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,519
That is the offer, right?

66
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:46,170
Helping real estate investors find

67
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:47,299
motivated sellers.

68
00:01:47,299 --> 00:01:48,719
Our leads come from people

69
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:50,400
actively looking to sell their

70
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,129
properties, giving you higher

71
00:01:52,219 --> 00:01:52,569
conversion

72
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,879
rates than cold prospects.

73
00:01:53,969 --> 00:01:55,060
This is like a topping.

74
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:56,609
It's not the meat and potatoes.

75
00:01:56,609 --> 00:01:58,180
We compete on both

76
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:59,310
price and volume.

77
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:00,890
So you get more leads for less

78
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:02,859
money, another topping, and then

79
00:02:02,859 --> 00:02:03,819
CTA, the call to

80
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,980
action, interested in seeing what

81
00:02:06,189 --> 00:02:07,900
leads we have available in your

82
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:08,409
area.

83
00:02:08,409 --> 00:02:09,979
So we have hundreds of real

84
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:10,310
estate.

85
00:02:10,379 --> 00:02:11,199
We've helped hundreds of real

86
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:12,139
estate investors find motivated

87
00:02:12,349 --> 00:02:12,659
sellers.

88
00:02:12,659 --> 00:02:13,710
Are you open

89
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:15,219
to seeing what leads we have

90
00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:16,539
available in your area?

91
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:18,409
That is the entire email subject

92
00:02:18,409 --> 00:02:19,969
line, Mark X,

93
00:02:19,979 --> 00:02:21,409
same thing I showed you guys in

94
00:02:21,409 --> 00:02:22,509
the previous video.

95
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:24,169
The subject line that's working is

96
00:02:24,229 --> 00:02:25,210
first name X

97
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:26,930
clients direct, my client's name,

98
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:27,699
seller leads.

99
00:02:27,699 --> 00:02:28,969
That's the entire email.

100
00:02:28,969 --> 00:02:30,259
It's working like a charm

101
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:33,400
compared to this angle, which only

102
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,800
has seven positive replies

103
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:39,050
compared to 37 because we always

104
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:39,449
test

105
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,370
different angles in our campaigns

106
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:42,360
to find a winner.

107
00:02:42,469 --> 00:02:44,110
So this one is a clear winner.

108
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,340
Variant B, clear

109
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:45,990
winner.

110
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:47,949
Variant A is underperforming.

111
00:02:47,949 --> 00:02:49,490
Are you struggling to find

112
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:50,819
motivated sellers?

113
00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:51,520
We provide

114
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,080
high volume seller leads to real

115
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,699
estate investors at competitive

116
00:02:54,699 --> 00:02:55,219
prices.

117
00:02:55,219 --> 00:02:56,750
Our leads are people actively

118
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:58,379
looking to sell their properties.

119
00:02:58,379 --> 00:02:59,840
We've been connecting investors

120
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,330
with sellers for five years and

121
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:01,539
worked

122
00:03:01,539 --> 00:03:02,780
with hundreds of active investors.

123
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:05,360
Do you want to see our current

124
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,080
lead inventory?

125
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,280
Why is this one

126
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,360
underperforming?

127
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,090
Because the offer, we provide high

128
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:13,960
volume seller leads at competitive

129
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,550
prices.

130
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,349
Want to see our current inventory?

131
00:03:16,349 --> 00:03:17,889
The call to action is not as good

132
00:03:17,939 --> 00:03:19,830
as do you want to see what leads

133
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:20,020
we

134
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:21,120
have in your area?

135
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,669
We're making it specific and

136
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:24,550
relevant to each person and that's

137
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:25,909
why this is performing so

138
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:26,099
well.

139
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,780
And if we go back, email 2B.

140
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,530
So for context, all of the things

141
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:33,479
that I've been showing you so far

142
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:33,990
is about

143
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,740
the first email in the sequence.

144
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,819
What is the first email that we're

145
00:03:37,819 --> 00:03:39,740
reaching out to somebody saying to

146
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:40,849
get them interested in what we're

147
00:03:40,849 --> 00:03:41,000
selling?

148
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:46,090
But there are follow-ups.

149
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:46,810
So I know this is brand new.

150
00:03:46,849 --> 00:03:48,560
I'm trying to make it as simple as

151
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,479
possible to you so you understand

152
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:50,860
it.

153
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:55,539
Email 1 is the initial email, but

154
00:03:55,539 --> 00:03:56,120
only

155
00:03:56,699 --> 00:04:00,120
1-2% of people ever reply to the

156
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:00,659
first email.

157
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,580
So do we just let them go forever

158
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,039
and never reach out to them again?

159
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,860
No, we follow up with them with

160
00:04:06,969 --> 00:04:08,699
the second and a third email that

161
00:04:08,699 --> 00:04:11,469
all have positive responses 21 66

162
00:04:11,469 --> 00:04:12,060
13

163
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,180
So all the follow-up emails also

164
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:15,400
get great results

165
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,870
As well.

166
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:18,129
So let's take a look at what a

167
00:04:18,129 --> 00:04:19,889
follow-up email looks like that is

168
00:04:19,889 --> 00:04:20,959
producing results

169
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,110
Most lead companies charge premium

170
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:25,709
prices for low quality prospects,

171
00:04:25,709 --> 00:04:27,300
but we compete on price and volume

172
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,540
Our seller leads are motivated

173
00:04:28,629 --> 00:04:30,129
homeowners actively looking to

174
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:30,500
sell

175
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,089
Giving you better conversions and

176
00:04:32,089 --> 00:04:33,500
cold outreach minded by sending

177
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,810
over our current pricing and lead

178
00:04:34,819 --> 00:04:35,279
inventory

179
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:37,120
So once again pricing and lead

180
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,089
inventory is a clear winner in the

181
00:04:39,089 --> 00:04:40,000
call to action

182
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:41,600
and the offer

183
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,139
Our seller leads are motivated

184
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:44,730
homeowners actively looking to

185
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:46,410
sell giving you better conversions

186
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:47,399
than cold outreach.

187
00:04:47,449 --> 00:04:48,339
This is a winning angle

188
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:50,540
66 positive replies to this

189
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,019
follow-up email

190
00:04:52,019 --> 00:04:55,050
So every single campaign that you

191
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:56,000
ever write

192
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,519
Should be a three-step email

193
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:00,699
sequence email one and two

194
00:05:00,699 --> 00:05:02,310
follow-ups to get people

195
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:04,180
interested because as you can see

196
00:05:04,189 --> 00:05:06,339
Each step one two and three is

197
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:08,720
producing positive results

198
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,839
The third email in the sequence

199
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:13,199
that's getting results is this one

200
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,750
We're helping several investors

201
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,410
secure motivated seller leads this

202
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:17,819
month at competitive prices

203
00:05:17,819 --> 00:05:19,500
I've put together our current lead

204
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,009
inventory and pricing for your

205
00:05:21,009 --> 00:05:21,459
market

206
00:05:21,459 --> 00:05:23,000
Would it be helpful if I shared

207
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
that with you here?

208
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,509
Right put together our current

209
00:05:25,509 --> 00:05:27,019
lead inventory and pricing for

210
00:05:27,019 --> 00:05:27,699
your market

211
00:05:27,699 --> 00:05:29,480
I'm leading with a free piece of

212
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,269
value a free piece of information

213
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:33,259
And this angle is getting a ton of

214
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:35,149
great responses as well.

215
00:05:35,149 --> 00:05:35,259
So

216
00:05:35,339 --> 00:05:37,009
Here's what it actually looks like

217
00:05:37,009 --> 00:05:38,269
when you're building out a

218
00:05:38,269 --> 00:05:39,910
campaign inside of the sending

219
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,319
tool.

220
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:40,980
This is advanced

221
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,160
We'll get to this later on but

222
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,680
here's what it looks like you put

223
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,740
all of your

224
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,589
A b c and d variants because like

225
00:05:46,589 --> 00:05:48,389
I said, we always like to test

226
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:49,959
different angles for each

227
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:50,720
different

228
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,660
Client that we work with and you

229
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:54,050
should do the same.

230
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,930
So I have four variations of email

231
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:56,180
one

232
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:58,990
A b c and d all the messaging is

233
00:05:59,139 --> 00:06:00,300
different as you can see

234
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,129
And all of the subject lines are

235
00:06:02,129 --> 00:06:04,199
very different as you can also see

236
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:05,699
And the biggest thing that you

237
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,319
want to be testing is the subject

238
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:08,879
line because it's different in

239
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:09,459
everyone

240
00:06:09,459 --> 00:06:11,439
The offer and the call to action

241
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:13,550
like I showed you guys in the last

242
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:14,029
video

243
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,569
Those are the biggest levers that

244
00:06:15,569 --> 00:06:16,850
you want to pull and the biggest

245
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:17,980
things that you want to test

246
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:19,769
When you're writing those emails,

247
00:06:19,769 --> 00:06:20,279
right?

248
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:23,209
If they don't answer right, let's

249
00:06:23,259 --> 00:06:24,399
say you reach out to somebody with

250
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:25,000
the first email

251
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,810
Camera died on me, but we're back

252
00:06:27,939 --> 00:06:30,029
Um, so like I said, if you reach

253
00:06:30,029 --> 00:06:31,220
out to them with the first email

254
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:32,660
There's a pretty high percentage

255
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:34,319
chance that prospects aren't going

256
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,170
to answer this email like a 98

257
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:36,680
chance

258
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:37,540
So

259
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,620
You set a follow-up four days

260
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:40,120
later

261
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,689
That just reiterates what you

262
00:06:41,689 --> 00:06:43,360
already said in the first email

263
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,699
Our seller leads come from people

264
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:46,120
looking to sell their properties

265
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,019
not cold prospects

266
00:06:47,019 --> 00:06:48,139
You have to convince we've been in

267
00:06:48,139 --> 00:06:49,089
business for five years.

268
00:06:49,089 --> 00:06:50,329
Do you want to see seller leads?

269
00:06:50,339 --> 00:06:51,930
We have available if they don't

270
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:53,819
answer that one three days later

271
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:55,490
after that we send another email

272
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,180
That says we're helping several

273
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,990
investors find motivated sellers

274
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:00,220
at competitive prices

275
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,819
I put together our lead inventory

276
00:07:01,819 --> 00:07:03,310
and pricing for your market.

277
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:04,329
Would it be helpful if I share

278
00:07:04,329 --> 00:07:04,860
that with you?

279
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,540
So think of a cold email campaign

280
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,779
as a three-step outreach sequence

281
00:07:08,779 --> 00:07:10,620
where you have an initial email

282
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:12,540
that you have four variations of

283
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:16,189
Where 25 of the prospects will

284
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:18,300
receive this one 25 here 25 here

285
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,019
25 here

286
00:07:19,019 --> 00:07:20,569
And if they don't answer this

287
00:07:20,569 --> 00:07:22,100
first email, they get sent a

288
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,100
follow-up message

289
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:24,920
Four days later and then three

290
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,230
days later with another follow-up

291
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:27,259
to get people interested

292
00:07:27,259 --> 00:07:29,069
That is what cold email looks like

293
00:07:29,069 --> 00:07:30,449
in a nutshell and this is what it

294
00:07:30,449 --> 00:07:31,569
looks like in the sending tool

295
00:07:31,579 --> 00:07:33,959
And if you're wondering what are

296
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:35,259
these brackets christian?

297
00:07:35,259 --> 00:07:36,649
What are these brackets with the

298
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,759
word variations all these brackets

299
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:41,490
do is switch up the wording of the

300
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:42,139
email

301
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:44,500
so that you don't go to spam

302
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,069
because if you send the exact same

303
00:07:46,189 --> 00:07:49,050
email to 10 000 people google and

304
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:51,019
outlook and microsoft are going to

305
00:07:51,019 --> 00:07:51,329
smack

306
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,279
Smack you on the wrist and say

307
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:54,060
this is bad

308
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:55,540
You're going to spam and then your

309
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:56,810
campaigns are going to completely

310
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:57,970
melt down because all of your

311
00:07:57,970 --> 00:07:59,199
emails are landing in the spam

312
00:07:59,209 --> 00:07:59,579
folder

313
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,560
Rather than the main inbox

314
00:08:01,579 --> 00:08:03,209
So what we do is we use this

315
00:08:03,209 --> 00:08:04,779
little thing called spin tax

316
00:08:04,779 --> 00:08:06,519
Which is what I have pulled up in

317
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:07,180
front of me

318
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,860
Where it's just variations of the

319
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:09,579
same phrase.

320
00:08:09,579 --> 00:08:10,379
So if you read this

321
00:08:11,019 --> 00:08:12,149
Are you struggling to find

322
00:08:12,149 --> 00:08:13,019
motivated sellers?

323
00:08:13,019 --> 00:08:14,529
Are you having trouble finding

324
00:08:14,529 --> 00:08:15,660
motivated sellers?

325
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,329
Are you looking for motivated

326
00:08:17,329 --> 00:08:17,819
sellers?

327
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:19,949
They all say the same thing we

328
00:08:19,949 --> 00:08:21,800
provide supply deliver high volume

329
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:22,220
leads

330
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:24,379
the only goal is that whenever the

331
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:26,529
The software sends out an email

332
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,110
it's going to pull one of these

333
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:29,560
combos at random to send your

334
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,050
email out

335
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:31,860
So no two emails look the same and

336
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,580
you stay in the in the main inbox

337
00:08:33,629 --> 00:08:34,889
and you don't go to spam

338
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:37,918
We will show you how to make spin

339
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:39,740
tax for your emails using ai it

340
00:08:39,788 --> 00:08:40,620
takes three seconds

341
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,840
But this is just a really good way

342
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,019
to stay out of the spam folder

343
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,990
Because if you go here the emails

344
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:46,330
look regular when they actually

345
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,179
get sent out, right?

346
00:08:47,179 --> 00:08:48,340
Are you looking to find motivated

347
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:49,179
sellers in your market?

348
00:08:49,659 --> 00:08:51,230
Right, but when we set it up on

349
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,960
the back end, we use this little

350
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,340
bit of

351
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,799
Technology, I guess you can call

352
00:08:55,799 --> 00:08:57,419
it or just like text replacement

353
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,009
To have variations of the same

354
00:09:00,009 --> 00:09:01,450
email going out so you don't go to

355
00:09:01,549 --> 00:09:01,830
spam.

356
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:02,539
Hopefully that makes sense

357
00:09:02,539 --> 00:09:03,549
If you have questions on it,

358
00:09:03,549 --> 00:09:04,220
please reach out

359
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,440
I know it's a little bit complex

360
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,299
and new for you

361
00:09:06,299 --> 00:09:07,820
But basically you're choosing

362
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,009
different variants of the same

363
00:09:09,009 --> 00:09:09,419
sentence

364
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:11,350
So that no two emails look the

365
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:12,559
same and you go to the main inbox

366
00:09:12,669 --> 00:09:14,539
when you reach out to people now

367
00:09:15,019 --> 00:09:17,659
Number or email

368
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,159
Let's where am I here?

369
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:20,940
Okay, so

370
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,850
This campaign that I have pulled

371
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:24,759
up in front of me is the first

372
00:09:24,759 --> 00:09:26,379
campaign is a client that we have

373
00:09:26,379 --> 00:09:27,820
that sells real estate marketing

374
00:09:28,299 --> 00:09:30,379
this is the

375
00:09:30,379 --> 00:09:32,090
Dashboard for list kit my own

376
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:32,529
business

377
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:33,840
We do outreach for our own

378
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,110
business just like you will be

379
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:36,590
doing for your own business on top

380
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:37,740
of your client outreach

381
00:09:38,539 --> 00:09:39,759
And we have a bunch of campaigns

382
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:40,950
going and the most successful

383
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:42,620
campaign of all time

384
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,240
Is this campaign that we're

385
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,950
running targeting web design

386
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,889
agencies because like I said

387
00:09:47,899 --> 00:09:50,019
Even marketing agencies need cold

388
00:09:50,019 --> 00:09:52,049
email marketing right like the

389
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:53,169
best marketing companies in the

390
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:53,500
world

391
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,740
Don't know how to market

392
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:56,600
themselves and get new clients.

393
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,830
That's where you come into play

394
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:58,700
and do it for them.

395
00:09:58,700 --> 00:09:58,769
So

396
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,509
Just like I did with the real

397
00:10:00,509 --> 00:10:02,139
estate marketing company

398
00:10:02,139 --> 00:10:04,220
I do the same stuff with my own

399
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:06,059
business and pay close attention

400
00:10:06,059 --> 00:10:07,860
because you want campaigns running

401
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:08,460
for yourself

402
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,120
Alongside your clients because you

403
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,259
want to be able to sign new

404
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:11,740
clients

405
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:12,700
At the same time as you get

406
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:13,899
results for your other clients.

407
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:15,179
Hopefully that makes sense

408
00:10:15,659 --> 00:10:16,139
Right

409
00:10:16,139 --> 00:10:18,120
And this the messaging is almost

410
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,070
the exact same

411
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:21,009
Saw you're in charge at visual

412
00:10:21,009 --> 00:10:21,259
fizz

413
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:22,899
We can get you 12 new leads a

414
00:10:22,899 --> 00:10:24,580
month interested in a new website

415
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:25,509
all from cold email

416
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:27,190
Mind if I share a quick video

417
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:29,009
going over a campaign strategy

418
00:10:29,009 --> 00:10:31,110
that got my web design client 11

419
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:33,019
high quality leads in one month

420
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:34,379
Right

421
00:10:34,379 --> 00:10:35,259
What's the hook here?

422
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:36,750
12 new leads a month and a new

423
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,190
website all from cold email.

424
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,340
What's the call to action?

425
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,750
A quick video going over a

426
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,669
campaign that got my client 11

427
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,500
leads in one month

428
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,450
What am I saying in the follow-up

429
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:47,179
almost the same exact thing?

430
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:49,919
We can deliver you 10 to 12 new

431
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:51,610
prospects a month all from cold

432
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:52,139
email hook

433
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:55,179
Ketchup and mustard the topping

434
00:10:55,179 --> 00:10:56,659
our client in dallas got 11 new

435
00:10:56,659 --> 00:10:57,940
leads in the dallas fort worth

436
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,259
area this month from a cold email

437
00:10:59,259 --> 00:10:59,649
campaign

438
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,740
All from a new website build out

439
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:02,980
Do you want to see a video call to

440
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:04,570
action breaking down our strategy,

441
00:11:04,669 --> 00:11:04,940
right?

442
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:06,379
So once you get the feel

443
00:11:06,379 --> 00:11:08,100
For the how cold email works, it's

444
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,659
the same plug and play system

445
00:11:09,659 --> 00:11:10,940
every time hook

446
00:11:11,419 --> 00:11:15,110
toppings like meat toppings

447
00:11:15,659 --> 00:11:17,330
Bun

448
00:11:17,419 --> 00:11:19,399
For a lack of a better term hook

449
00:11:19,899 --> 00:11:21,250
case study call to action

450
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:24,059
Email three

451
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:25,100
Similar

452
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,340
I recorded a video going over a

453
00:11:26,429 --> 00:11:27,820
cold email strategy that can bring

454
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,500
you 10 to 12 new leads a month

455
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:29,820
hook

456
00:11:30,269 --> 00:11:31,909
Call to action mind if I share the

457
00:11:31,909 --> 00:11:32,509
video here.

458
00:11:32,509 --> 00:11:33,419
That's the entire email

459
00:11:34,539 --> 00:11:35,659
Done, right?

460
00:11:35,659 --> 00:11:37,139
Same thing over here with a custom

461
00:11:37,139 --> 00:11:38,580
merchandise client of ours that

462
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:39,500
has reached out to

463
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:41,649
215,000

464
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:44,379
People and got 446

465
00:11:44,379 --> 00:11:46,529
Leads from a single campaign

466
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,779
Keep in mind this this company

467
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:50,139
sells multiple five-figure

468
00:11:50,139 --> 00:11:50,779
packages

469
00:11:50,779 --> 00:11:52,220
So one client to them is worth

470
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:54,269
five figures and they have 446

471
00:11:54,269 --> 00:11:55,820
leads from our campaign

472
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:59,200
And very similar to the last two

473
00:11:59,200 --> 00:11:59,740
examples

474
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:02,149
We can create branded apparel for

475
00:12:02,149 --> 00:12:03,659
your company from brands like

476
00:12:03,659 --> 00:12:05,490

482

Ketchup and mustard the toppings

483
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,519
the call to action mind if I share

484
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,070
a video going over our apparel

485
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:19,580
catalog

486
00:12:20,059 --> 00:12:21,500
hook

487
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:22,700
guarantee

488
00:12:23,179 --> 00:12:24,299
body

489
00:12:24,299 --> 00:12:25,539
Just like this email

490
00:12:26,059 --> 00:12:29,100
Hook case study

491
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:30,820
Call to action.

492
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:32,029
I meant to say call to action not

493
00:12:32,059 --> 00:12:34,370
body hook guarantee call to action

494
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:37,190
Hook case study call to action.

495
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:39,179
It's the same system over and over

496
00:12:39,179 --> 00:12:40,220
and over again

497
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,370
And once you get really good at

498
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:43,029
it, you can just do this at scale

499
00:12:43,149 --> 00:12:44,379
for each of your clients

500
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:45,970
Hopefully i'm getting you in the

501
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:47,500
right mindset of how to write good

502
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,059
cold emails

503
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,149
In the next video, I want to show

504
00:12:50,149 --> 00:12:51,629
you how to respond to people once

505
00:12:51,659 --> 00:12:53,269
they so you're probably like

506
00:12:53,269 --> 00:12:53,529
christian

507
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:54,629
This is cool and all but what

508
00:12:54,629 --> 00:12:55,740
happens when somebody actually

509
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:56,919
says yes, i'm interested

510
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,379
How do I make a video?

511
00:12:58,379 --> 00:12:59,580
How do I respond back to them?

512
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:01,129
How do I book them in for a sales

513
00:13:01,129 --> 00:13:01,559
call?

514
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:02,889
I'm going to show you that on the

515
00:13:02,899 --> 00:13:04,840
next video stay tuned
