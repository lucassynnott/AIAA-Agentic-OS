1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,909
All right, this video is gonna be

2
00:00:01,909 --> 00:00:03,470
very intro and elementary but I

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:04,879
feel like it's necessary because a

4
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:06,000
lot of the terms that I'm

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,139
Going to use over the course of

6
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:08,199
this program and a lot of the

7
00:00:08,199 --> 00:00:09,369
terms that you're gonna hear

8
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:11,140
When you watch these videos are

9
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:12,560
gonna be brand new to you

10
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,390
And these are terms that I've been

11
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:16,760
using for four plus years.

12
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,280
They feel like second nature to me

13
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,219
so there will be times where I say

14
00:00:20,219 --> 00:00:21,230
something like

15
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:24,079
LTV or CAC or margins

16
00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:26,589
That seems like you know an easy

17
00:00:26,589 --> 00:00:27,320
thing to understand

18
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,730
But you probably have no clue what

19
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:30,140
i'm saying because this is a brand

20
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:30,359
new

21
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,039
Concept to you

22
00:00:32,039 --> 00:00:33,340
So I want to go through a bunch of

23
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:34,600
key terms that you need to know

24
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,070
And understand so that when you're

25
00:00:36,189 --> 00:00:37,539
watching the content and you're

26
00:00:37,539 --> 00:00:39,060
conducting business as a business

27
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:39,399
owner

28
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:41,780
You know what they mean and why

29
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:42,829
they're important.

30
00:00:42,829 --> 00:00:42,960
So

31
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:44,880
First of all an offer.

32
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:45,560
What is an offer?

33
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,799
Daniel went over this and all the

34
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:47,880
videos you watched before

35
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,479
An offer is just the way that

36
00:00:49,479 --> 00:00:51,250
you're packaging up your services

37
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:52,560
and selling them and selling them

38
00:00:52,609 --> 00:00:53,640
to your clients, right?

39
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:56,020
We can book you 10 calls a month

40
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:57,479
on a performance basis offer

41
00:00:57,479 --> 00:00:59,340
We can generate you 10k in new

42
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:00,810
business with a cold email

43
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:01,880
campaign offer

44
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,810
We can help you sign five clients

45
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:05,980
a month with an outreach campaign.

46
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:07,000
That's an offer, right?

47
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,030
What you're selling cold email is

48
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:10,010
not an offer.

49
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:11,230
Daniel explained this very well

50
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:12,709
I'm sure you comprehend this by

51
00:01:12,829 --> 00:01:13,049
now.

52
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:13,560
Let's move on

53
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,549
Pay per call

54
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,909
This is a pricing model that's

55
00:01:16,909 --> 00:01:18,340
commonly used to sell cold email

56
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:18,840
services

57
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,450
It's the the model that i'm going

58
00:01:20,459 --> 00:01:21,780
to be referencing in the next

59
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:22,120
video

60
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,109
Basically, it's a structure where

61
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,340
you only get paid for every call

62
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:26,799
that you book for your clients and

63
00:01:26,849 --> 00:01:27,530
it's very

64
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,870
Incentive aligned because they're

65
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:31,370
only you know your clients only

66
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:32,489
paying you for every call that you

67
00:01:32,489 --> 00:01:32,969
book for them

68
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,989
And this is a model called the pay

69
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:35,560
per call

70
00:01:35,569 --> 00:01:37,510
Model pretty straightforward,

71
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:37,799
right?

72
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:39,260
Close rate.

73
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,200
What is a close rate?

74
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,560
This is the percentage of sales

75
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,920
calls that a business converts

76
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,870
into paying clients

77
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,319
If you get on five sales calls and

78
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:48,209
you close one of them your close

79
00:01:48,209 --> 00:01:49,519
rate is 20%

80
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,579
You got one person out of five to

81
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:53,469
pay you money and become a client

82
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,810
you closed one deal out of five

83
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:57,159
calls your close rate

84
00:01:57,599 --> 00:01:58,760
is

85
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:00,599
total closes or signed clients

86
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:02,079
divided by the number of calls you

87
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,719
took the higher the close rate the

88
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:04,760
better you are at sales

89
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,079
The more you can scale right?

90
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:09,960
MRR monthly recurring revenue and

91
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,550
arr is annual recurring revenue.

92
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:13,680
This is just how much money you're

93
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,509
making every single month

94
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,539
Let's say 10 clients are paying

95
00:02:16,539 --> 00:02:17,830
you two grand a month.

96
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:19,310
Your mrr is twenty thousand

97
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:21,080
dollars a month pretty simple

98
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,479
Lifetime value how much a client

99
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,400
is worth to a business?

100
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,219
LTV for short lifetime value LTV

101
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,710
This is how much money a client is

102
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:32,680
worth to you

103
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,860
so let's say

104
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:35,240
This is going to take you a long

105
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,620
time to realize on your own and

106
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,000
figure out what your lifetime

107
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,509
value is

108
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,189
But what you're going to want to

109
00:02:40,189 --> 00:02:41,909
ask on sales calls is what is your

110
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:43,639
lifetime value of a client?

111
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,629
which is

112
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:46,590
um

113
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:47,979
Basically, how many months a

114
00:02:47,979 --> 00:02:49,919
client pays somebody for times how

115
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:52,000
much they're paying them so let's

116
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,080
say on average

117
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,539
I

118
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:56,030
Keep my clients for six months and

119
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:57,370
they pay me a thousand dollars a

120
00:02:57,370 --> 00:02:57,719
month

121
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,889
On average my client lifetime

122
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,770
value is six thousand dollars if I

123
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:02,599
sign a client

124
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:04,439
I know based on law of averages

125
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:05,639
that they're going to pay me six

126
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:07,000
thousand dollars before they

127
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,719
eventually leave

128
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,740
And go off on their own or stop

129
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:11,460
paying me right and this is a

130
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:13,159
metric that you realize once you

131
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:13,400
have

132
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,319
A business for a long enough

133
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:15,960
stretch of time

134
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,879
hey, I know that pretty much for

135
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:18,280
certain

136
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,039
I'm going to keep a client for 12

137
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:21,199
months and they're going to pay me

138
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:22,039
a thousand dollars a month

139
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:24,240
My lifetime value is twelve

140
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,560
thousand dollars pretty simple

141
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,159
Um, and this is what you're going

142
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:28,159
to want to be asking people on the

143
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:28,439
phone

144
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:30,360
To figure out how much you should

145
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,759
charge which is something i'll

146
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:32,759
explain in the next video

147
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:34,199
But hey

148
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:35,629
My lifetime value of a client is

149
00:03:35,629 --> 00:03:37,169
10 grand I keep people for 10

150
00:03:37,169 --> 00:03:37,620
months.

151
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:38,699
Usually I charge a thousand

152
00:03:38,699 --> 00:03:40,919
dollars lifetime value 10 grand on

153
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:41,560
the other hand

154
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:45,400
CAC customer acquisition cost cac

155
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,250
Is how much it costs for you to

156
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,319
acquire a customer?

157
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:51,159
Right, let's say you spend

158
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,610
1200 on a cold email campaign and

159
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:55,520
you sign a client your cac your

160
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,800
customer acquisition cost is 1200

161
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,080
because you paid

162
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,580
Your invest you invested rather

163
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:03,080
1200 bucks into a cold email

164
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,199
campaign to sign a client

165
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:06,710
Let's say somebody refers you a

166
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:08,830
client and you close them and you

167
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,639
sign them as a

168
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:12,219
Client your cac is zero dollars

169
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:13,759
because you didn't invest in any

170
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,900
marketing to sign that client and

171
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:16,920
the big

172
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,319
golden ratio of business is

173
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,009
However much you're spending to

174
00:04:23,009 --> 00:04:24,839
acquire a customer needs to be

175
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:26,500
less hopefully a lot less than the

176
00:04:26,509 --> 00:04:27,800
lifetime value of a client

177
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,490
If you invest a thousand dollars

178
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:30,860
into a cold email campaign

179
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,129
And your clients are worth 10

180
00:04:33,129 --> 00:04:34,480
grand to you your cac

181
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:37,459
To lifetime value ratio is 10 1 to

182
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:39,050
10 i'm spending one thousand

183
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:40,990
dollars to acquire ten thousand

184
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:42,050
dollars worth of business

185
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,990
If your cac is higher than your

186
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:45,000
lifetime value

187
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,649
You're obviously going to go out

188
00:04:46,649 --> 00:04:48,129
of business because you're paying

189
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,410
more to acquire a customer than

190
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:50,829
what they're worth to you

191
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:52,569
This is going to be very important

192
00:04:52,569 --> 00:04:53,800
for your sales process

193
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,269
Because you're going to be

194
00:04:55,389 --> 00:04:57,319
charging a pay-per-meeting model

195
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,199
So ideally if somebody can close

196
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,230
20% of the sales calls that you

197
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:03,399
book for them and you're charging

198
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:05,720
200 dollars a call

199
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,129
They're closing every thousand

200
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,180
dollars they spend 200 times five

201
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:10,519
calls

202
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:12,839
A thousand dollars is their cac

203
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:14,670
their cac is a thousand dollars

204
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,519
So hopefully their lifetime value

205
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:18,199
is more than a thousand dollars

206
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:19,660
That is how you will be successful

207
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,139
with your agency because you're

208
00:05:21,139 --> 00:05:22,329
charging two hundred dollars a

209
00:05:22,329 --> 00:05:22,509
call

210
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:25,019
Your client is closing one in five

211
00:05:25,019 --> 00:05:26,019
of those calls.

212
00:05:26,019 --> 00:05:27,329
So they're paying ten a thousand

213
00:05:27,329 --> 00:05:28,490
dollars to acquire a customer

214
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:29,959
That's their cac

215
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:31,110
And their lifetime value is

216
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:32,470
hopefully five ten grand and

217
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:33,519
they're happy to work with you and

218
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:34,920
pay you 200 bucks a call

219
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,399
I'll dive into that in the next

220
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:36,889
video.

221
00:05:36,889 --> 00:05:38,100
Let's stay focused on the rest of

222
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:38,470
this list

223
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:41,110
Margins profit margins how much

224
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:42,439
profit a business is making each

225
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,790
month relative to total income

226
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:46,300
Let's say you made a hundred

227
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:47,579
thousand dollars.

228
00:05:47,579 --> 00:05:49,069
You paid out 60 grand and

229
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,589
Salary and fees and all this stuff

230
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,410
your margin is forty percent you

231
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:55,800
took home forty thousand dollars

232
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,009
out of the hundred thousand

233
00:05:57,009 --> 00:05:57,569
dollars that you're

234
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:00,120
Generating in revenue, right

235
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,910
revenue minus expense equals

236
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:03,240
margin profit margin

237
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,959
Okay, technical cold email stuff

238
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:08,850
Deliverability this is a term that

239
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:09,959
is used to measure

240
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:11,579
How many of your emails are going

241
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:12,439
to the main inbox?

242
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:13,779
One of the biggest things that

243
00:06:13,779 --> 00:06:14,819
you're going to want to focus on

244
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:16,199
as a cold email agency owner

245
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:18,750
Is good client deliverability

246
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:20,829
because if your deliverability is

247
00:06:20,829 --> 00:06:21,079
bad

248
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:23,329
Their emails are going to go to

249
00:06:23,329 --> 00:06:23,720
spam

250
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,870
Your clients going to get no

251
00:06:24,899 --> 00:06:26,089
responses and they're going to be

252
00:06:26,089 --> 00:06:26,939
very upset with you because

253
00:06:26,939 --> 00:06:27,870
they're not getting results

254
00:06:27,889 --> 00:06:30,519
Good deliverability means that

255
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:32,250
Their email is landing in the main

256
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,290
inbox right here the main gmail

257
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:36,759
inbox and not in spam

258
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,050
Here's my spam folder.

259
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:39,589
No good.

260
00:06:39,589 --> 00:06:41,670
Here's my regular inbox.

261
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:42,360
Very good.

262
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,560
We want to be in this folder

263
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:44,949
Not in spam.

264
00:06:44,949 --> 00:06:45,420
So if you have good

265
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,600
deliverability, that means your

266
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,519
emails are landing in the main

267
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:47,779
inbox

268
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,490
If you have bad deliverability,

269
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:50,730
your emails are going to spam and

270
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:51,949
we will show you how to fix that

271
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:52,279
so

272
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,759
Scripts pretty simple.

273
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:56,079
What is actually being said in

274
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:56,839
your cold email?

275
00:06:56,839 --> 00:06:58,019
I'll show you how to write really

276
00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:58,829
good scripts, but

277
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:00,089
You're like what the hell is a

278
00:07:00,089 --> 00:07:00,439
script?

279
00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:01,589
It's just what you're saying in

280
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,000
the email to get people interested

281
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:05,639
Okay lead list

282
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:06,990
This is a list of email contacts

283
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:08,279
that you're using in your cold

284
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:09,079
email campaigns

285
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:11,319
Let's say you're reaching out to

286
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:13,449
ceos of tech companies.

287
00:07:13,459 --> 00:07:15,350
You will be building a lead list

288
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:18,329
Of ceo emails at tech companies.

289
00:07:18,329 --> 00:07:19,579
That is your list of leads.

290
00:07:19,579 --> 00:07:21,430
It's in a csv excel file or a

291
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:22,519
google sheets file

292
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:24,540
That is your lead list

293
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,810
That is a list of email leads that

294
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:27,009
you're reaching out to to get them

295
00:07:27,009 --> 00:07:28,360
interested in what you're selling

296
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,310
Different than a lead so when I

297
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:31,959
say lead

298
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:34,370
I either mean the actual email

299
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,860
address that you're reaching out

300
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:36,920
to that is an email lead

301
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,379
A lead could also mean someone

302
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:39,860
that's interested in your

303
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:40,470
services.

304
00:07:40,579 --> 00:07:41,800
So there's a distinction there

305
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,180
Hey, I got a lead yesterday.

306
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,160
That's someone interested in what

307
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:45,810
you're selling.

308
00:07:45,819 --> 00:07:47,110
Hey, I have a list of leads

309
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,610
That's an email list.

310
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:49,410
They're not interested in what

311
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:49,980
you're selling.

312
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:50,709
You still have to reach out to

313
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:50,920
them

314
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,889
So there's a little bit of a

315
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:53,399
caveat there just realize which

316
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:54,439
one i'm referring to

317
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:57,160
Did I get a positive response lead

318
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,610
or do I have a list of email leads

319
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:00,040
that i'm going to reach out to?

320
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,399
Kind of confusing but you'll

321
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:02,069
understand it

322
00:08:02,129 --> 00:08:04,839
As we progress here

323
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:05,680
Okay

324
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,470
What is an upsell an upsell means

325
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:09,279
selling your client more services

326
00:08:09,379 --> 00:08:10,680
and charging them more money?

327
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,829
Let's say you're reaching out to

328
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:13,399
10 000 people a month for them

329
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:15,319
And they're really happy with you

330
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:17,860
you want to upsell them on 10 000

331
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:18,920
more contacts a month

332
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:20,680
Hey, man, you're getting great

333
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,060
results.

334
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,110
Let's just double your volume and

335
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:22,680
uh, you know

336
00:08:22,689 --> 00:08:24,959
Book twice as many meetings you

337
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:26,670
just upsold your client, which is

338
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:27,670
a good thing because you're making

339
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:27,990
more money

340
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,060
Similarly a cross sell is selling

341
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:31,959
your client new services and

342
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,779
charging them more money.

343
00:08:33,788 --> 00:08:35,009
So instead of just selling them

344
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:35,798
more of the same

345
00:08:35,798 --> 00:08:37,809
Hey, you already ordered a steak.

346
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:38,600
Do you want a steak for your

347
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,720
friend here?

348
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,418
You're selling them.

349
00:08:41,418 --> 00:08:42,259
Hey, here's the steak.

350
00:08:42,259 --> 00:08:43,529
Do you want fries with this or mac

351
00:08:43,529 --> 00:08:44,519
and cheese with this?

352
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:47,210
So like cold email, maybe you get

353
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:48,669
really good at cold email and then

354
00:08:48,669 --> 00:08:49,200
you introduce

355
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:51,559
LinkedIn outreach or content or

356
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:54,049
youtube you're cross selling them

357
00:08:54,049 --> 00:08:55,080
new services

358
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,879
to generate more revenue

359
00:08:57,879 --> 00:08:59,549
Cross sell upsell two different

360
00:08:59,549 --> 00:08:59,899
things

361
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,590
Inbox management, what is inbox

362
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:04,940
management you're literally

363
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:07,080
managing your email inbox

364
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,899
And uh responding back to people

365
00:09:08,899 --> 00:09:10,850
that are interested in what you're

366
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:11,529
selling.

367
00:09:11,529 --> 00:09:13,269
Here's a look at the email inbox

368
00:09:13,269 --> 00:09:15,000
that I have for my campaigns

369
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,169
I'm managing my inbox by coming in

370
00:09:18,169 --> 00:09:19,879
here and answering rob's email

371
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:21,350
I actually have to book him in for

372
00:09:21,429 --> 00:09:22,090
a call still.

373
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:23,259
I need to jump on this after I

374
00:09:23,289 --> 00:09:24,440
finish this video

375
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,899
Um, but that's an up.

376
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:27,129
That's an inbox management.

377
00:09:27,129 --> 00:09:28,330
You're just managing your email

378
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:29,360
inbox for yourself or your

379
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,120
clients, right?

380
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,820
A-b testing this is just testing

381
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,360
two different scripts against each

382
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,490
other to see which one does better

383
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,240
um

384
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:40,700
Literally like

385
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,019
If you look at a thumbnail on

386
00:09:42,059 --> 00:09:43,299
youtube from mr beast, he's

387
00:09:43,299 --> 00:09:44,840
probably a b testing different

388
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,399
thumbnails

389
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,870
To see which one is getting a

390
00:09:46,889 --> 00:09:47,710
better click rate

391
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,179
The same thing is true with an

392
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,200
email campaign

393
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,220
You want to be a b testing

394
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:53,700
different messaging to see which

395
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,600
one performs better

396
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,620
Here's a really good example.

397
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:58,509
Um, all these angles are different

398
00:09:58,519 --> 00:09:59,509
as you can see here.

399
00:09:59,509 --> 00:10:00,019
I'm a b

400
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:02,000
c and d testing different

401
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,169
messaging to see what does the

402
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:03,399
best

403
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,279
Um, that's an a b test

404
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,629
What is an email angle different

405
00:10:09,629 --> 00:10:10,840
ways of explaining what you sell

406
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,240
so in this here's how I would

407
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:13,879
refer to this

408
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:15,870
I'm a b testing different angles

409
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:17,370
to see which angle performs the

410
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:17,639
best

411
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:20,289
An angle is just what i'm saying

412
00:10:20,289 --> 00:10:21,929
to get somebody interested instead

413
00:10:21,929 --> 00:10:23,720
of saying leads i'm saying calls

414
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:26,000
Like one angle could be hey i'm

415
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,399
going to get you 10 leads a month

416
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,000
Another angle could be hey i'm

417
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,600
getting you five sales calls a

418
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,440
month another angle could be hey

419
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,720
i'm getting you one new client a

420
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:33,960
month

421
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:35,899
Another angle could be hey i'm

422
00:10:35,899 --> 00:10:37,509
generating you 5k and new sales

423
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:38,190
every month

424
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:40,580
All of those angles are selling

425
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:42,029
the same thing of cold email.

426
00:10:42,049 --> 00:10:43,519
I'm just offering it differently

427
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,159
A common thing that I will say is

428
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:48,429
hey, try new offer angles

429
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:50,889
Instead of selling buy one get one

430
00:10:50,889 --> 00:10:51,559
free try

431
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:53,230
Bring a friend for five dollars

432
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:54,909
like different ways of selling

433
00:10:54,909 --> 00:10:56,649
what you're already offering in

434
00:10:56,649 --> 00:10:57,240
this case

435
00:10:57,679 --> 00:10:59,049
Obviously cold email right offer

436
00:10:59,049 --> 00:10:59,480
angles

437
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,139
Just different ways of saying what

438
00:11:01,139 --> 00:11:02,789
you're reaching out to somebody to

439
00:11:02,789 --> 00:11:03,299
sell them

440
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:04,759
Um, okay

441
00:11:04,759 --> 00:11:06,679
Retention this is how long you

442
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:07,799
keep a client for

443
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,009
If you keep a client for six

444
00:11:10,009 --> 00:11:11,659
months you retain them for six

445
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:13,500
months my customer retention on

446
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,070
average is about six months that's

447
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:15,559
retention

448
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,460
Churn is what happens when you

449
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:19,980
lose a client and you're no longer

450
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:20,759
retaining them

451
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,240
Yeah, I churned a client last

452
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:23,710
week.

453
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:25,769
It sucked not churn is not a good

454
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:26,759
feeling but

455
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:29,539
Churn is the the thing to describe

456
00:11:29,539 --> 00:11:30,759
what happens when somebody

457
00:11:31,179 --> 00:11:32,789
Churns from your business.

458
00:11:32,929 --> 00:11:33,750
They no longer work with you.

459
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:34,309
They fired you.

460
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,159
They don't want to work with you

461
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:35,159
anymore

462
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:37,679
You churned that client not good,

463
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:37,799
right?

464
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,350
Domains, okay

465
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:44,409
Domains are the web urls you will

466
00:11:44,419 --> 00:11:45,889
be setting up for your client and

467
00:11:45,889 --> 00:11:47,090
yourself to run cold email

468
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:47,639
campaigns

469
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:50,529
For example, let's say I am steve

470
00:11:50,529 --> 00:11:52,909
jobs and apple.com is my domain

471
00:11:52,919 --> 00:11:55,620
You would never send cold emails

472
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:58,659
from the apple.com domain because

473
00:11:58,679 --> 00:12:00,559
If you wind up going to spam with

474
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:02,990
the apple.com domain every single

475
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:04,639
apple employee can no longer send

476
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:05,879
emails without going to spam

477
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:06,919
And that's a huge problem.

478
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:08,840
So for yourself and your clients

479
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,830
You're going to set up fresh

480
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,629
domains specifically for cold

481
00:12:12,629 --> 00:12:13,149
outreach

482
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:17,960
Use apple.com get apple.com try

483
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,080
apple.com

484
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,139
You're gonna have all these

485
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:21,629
different domains that all send

486
00:12:21,629 --> 00:12:23,669
emails for you and your clients to

487
00:12:23,669 --> 00:12:24,919
avoid going to spam

488
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,279
um

489
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:28,509
So yeah, whenever I say domains,

490
00:12:28,509 --> 00:12:29,720
that's just like the website urls

491
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,600
that i'm purchasing from a tool

492
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,120
like

493
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:34,039
pork bun

494
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,220
um

495
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:36,700
Literally, it's called a domain

496
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,610
registrar, right?

497
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:37,879
So like

498
00:12:38,529 --> 00:12:40,259
Use apple.com.

499
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:41,259
I doubt this domain is even

500
00:12:41,259 --> 00:12:41,720
available

501
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:43,399
um

502
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:45,360
It's registered already use apple

503
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:45,960
products

504
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,779
Dot com this one's probably also

505
00:12:48,779 --> 00:12:49,080
taken

506
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:50,759
um

507
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:51,710
Okay, it's actually available

508
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,840
eleven dollars a year, right?

509
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,990
That's a domain that I would set

510
00:12:54,019 --> 00:12:54,679
up for my client

511
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:57,080
On top of the domain you're going

512
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,039
to set up inboxes

513
00:12:58,039 --> 00:12:59,509
Right because you're running a

514
00:12:59,629 --> 00:13:00,649
cold email campaign.

515
00:13:00,649 --> 00:13:01,559
You need to have an inbox

516
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,200
Multiple hundreds of inboxes for

517
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,080
some of your clients.

518
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,620
So when I say hey set up new

519
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:06,970
domains

520
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:09,000
That's just going and setting up

521
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,669
Buying new website urls for your

522
00:13:10,669 --> 00:13:12,240
client inside of a registrar so

523
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,960
that you can send emails from them

524
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,559
And then when I say inboxes, this

525
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:17,000
just means

526
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,559
Steve at use apple.com

527
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,120
Kevin at use apple.com

528
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,000
It's the actual email inbox that

529
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,250
you're setting up on top of the

530
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:26,889
domain the easiest way to think of

531
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:27,860
this is

532
00:13:27,889 --> 00:13:30,440
You have a work email, right?

533
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:30,759
Like

534
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:34,120
Tom at tampalawyers.com

535
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:36,149
Your inbox is tom at

536
00:13:36,289 --> 00:13:37,860
tampalawyers.com the domain is

537
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:38,919
tampalawyers.com

538
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,590
Right so domains and inboxes the

539
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,379
website and then the actual email

540
00:13:43,379 --> 00:13:44,450
address that you set up on the

541
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:44,840
website

542
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:47,240
two more things

543
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:48,600
Email warm up

544
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,340
So warm up is what happens when

545
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,730
you first set up a new domain in a

546
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:52,279
new inbox

547
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:53,720
You're not just going to send

548
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,220
emails from that domain on the

549
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:55,820
first day.

550
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:56,679
That's the easiest way in the

551
00:13:56,679 --> 00:13:57,559
world to go to spam

552
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,289
Instead you're going to want to

553
00:14:00,289 --> 00:14:02,330
warm them up for two weeks so that

554
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:04,039
by the time you launch campaigns

555
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,720
Google and outlook, you know

556
00:14:08,129 --> 00:14:09,960
Think that you're a human instead

557
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,269
of a robot that just sent cold

558
00:14:11,379 --> 00:14:12,950
emails on the first day of setting

559
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:13,789
up that inbox

560
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,639
same thing

561
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:17,000
You wouldn't go out to your car in

562
00:14:17,009 --> 00:14:18,299
the freezing cold and sitting it

563
00:14:18,299 --> 00:14:19,549
freezing cold and drive off

564
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:20,710
You would let the car warm up

565
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:22,120
until it's good enough to sit in

566
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,919
The same thing is here true here

567
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:26,350
you want to warm up your inboxes

568
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:27,000
for two weeks

569
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,690
Um, and i'll show you how to do

570
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:29,019
that later

571
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,000
Warm up emails, right?

572
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,460
They all landed in the inbox

573
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:33,620
That's why you warm up your

574
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:35,100
domains and your inboxes because

575
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,519
you will not go to spam, right?

576
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:37,799
So

577
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:40,039
You will have bad deliverability

578
00:14:40,039 --> 00:14:41,700
If you don't warm up your inboxes,

579
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:41,879
right?

580
00:14:41,889 --> 00:14:42,830
That's just

581
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:44,600
Different ways that I refer to

582
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,659
This is the kind of terminology

583
00:14:45,659 --> 00:14:46,870
that I use so I want to give you

584
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:47,639
this context now

585
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,100
Sending tool, what is the sending

586
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:50,309
tool?

587
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,450
This is the software that you're

588
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:52,379
going to be sending your emails

589
00:14:52,529 --> 00:14:53,879
from it looks like this

590
00:14:53,879 --> 00:14:55,289
You're not sending emails one by

591
00:14:55,289 --> 00:14:55,799
one by hand

592
00:14:55,799 --> 00:14:57,399
You're setting up a sending tool

593
00:14:57,409 --> 00:14:59,419
That does the outreach for you

594
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:00,940
Because you're not going to sit

595
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:02,840
here and send 2300 emails by hand

596
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,789
that would drive you insane

597
00:15:03,799 --> 00:15:04,950
You have a sending tool that does

598
00:15:05,019 --> 00:15:05,830
it all automatically.

599
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:06,929
So these are all the terms that

600
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,710
i'm going to be using

601
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,200
There will be more terms that

602
00:15:09,309 --> 00:15:10,360
you'll probably hear

603
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,820
But I wanted to give you a crash

604
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:13,259
course on the different terms that

605
00:15:13,259 --> 00:15:13,909
i'm going to be using

606
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:15,830
During these videos and during the

607
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:17,659
course of your business career so

608
00:15:17,659 --> 00:15:18,519
you understand them

609
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,190
Um, and let's dive into the meat

610
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:21,220
and potatoes of cold email.

611
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:22,039
Thank you for watching this

612
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,710
Hopefully this wasn't too boring,

613
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:24,769
but I think it was important.

614
00:15:24,769 --> 00:15:25,240
So cheers
