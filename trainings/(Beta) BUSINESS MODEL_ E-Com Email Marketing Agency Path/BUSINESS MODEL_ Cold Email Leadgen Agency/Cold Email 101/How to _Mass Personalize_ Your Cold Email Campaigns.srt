1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:01,690
What's going on?

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:03,640
I want to make this video to

3
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:06,469
explain how I personalize cold

4
00:00:06,469 --> 00:00:07,879
emails at scale, no matter

5
00:00:07,929 --> 00:00:09,300
what industry you're in, what

6
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:10,539
offer you have, who you're

7
00:00:10,539 --> 00:00:11,960
targeting, or any of that.

8
00:00:12,009 --> 00:00:13,390
So let's break it down.

9
00:00:13,449 --> 00:00:15,369
There's four different scenarios,

10
00:00:15,369 --> 00:00:16,989
pretty much, of what you can do

11
00:00:16,989 --> 00:00:18,440
for personalization.

12
00:00:18,489 --> 00:00:20,230
Scenario one, to act as a fan or

13
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:21,940
consumer of their brand.

14
00:00:21,989 --> 00:00:23,600
Scenario two, stroke their ego,

15
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:25,399
which I'll explain more in a bit.

16
00:00:25,449 --> 00:00:26,600
Scenario three, tap into a pain

17
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,839
point or desire that they have.

18
00:00:27,969 --> 00:00:29,949
Scenario four, build some rapport

19
00:00:29,949 --> 00:00:31,570
and trust with them with your

20
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:32,289
opener.

21
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:34,259
So let's dive into each one, a fan

22
00:00:34,259 --> 00:00:36,020
or consumer of their brand.

23
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:38,960
This is primarily for e-commerce

24
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:41,600
brands or SaaS, right?

25
00:00:41,649 --> 00:00:44,039
So in this scenario, you want to

26
00:00:44,119 --> 00:00:46,100
be able to come across as if

27
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:48,259
you're a consumer of their

28
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:49,229
brand.

29
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:50,219
You're shopping on their website.

30
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:51,219
You came across their Instagram.

31
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:53,219
You saw a TikTok video of theirs.

32
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:55,469
Basically any e-commerce brand or

33
00:00:55,469 --> 00:00:57,619
anyone you see online that you can

34
00:00:57,649 --> 00:00:59,340
come across as a consumer.

35
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:01,020
So here's how I would do it for

36
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:02,770
different industries within

37
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:04,400
e-commerce and then a local

38
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:04,819
business

39
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:05,780
in your city.

40
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:07,400
So toddler brand, right?

41
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:09,150
Let's say you scrape a list.

42
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,379
I always recommend that if you're

43
00:01:10,379 --> 00:01:11,599
targeting e-com, you get really,

44
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,599
really specific on your

45
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:14,599
targeting like toddler brands,

46
00:01:14,599 --> 00:01:16,379
skincare brands, jewelry,

47
00:01:16,379 --> 00:01:18,319
clothing, CBD, like choose a

48
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:18,530
really

49
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:20,219
specific niche because you can

50
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:21,969
come across as a consumer of their

51
00:01:21,969 --> 00:01:22,540
brand.

52
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:23,640
And it's going to bring the

53
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,980
prospects guard down when you go

54
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:26,079
to write a cold email.

55
00:01:26,129 --> 00:01:27,750
So here's what I mean by acting as

56
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:29,310
a fan or consumer, right?

57
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:42,560
So what are they going to see in

58
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:54,870
the preview of the email?

59
00:01:54,969 --> 00:01:56,379
I was doing some shopping for my

60
00:01:56,379 --> 00:01:57,640
sister's baby shower.

61
00:01:57,689 --> 00:01:59,069
They're a toddler brand and they

62
00:01:59,069 --> 00:02:00,069
make baby products.

63
00:02:00,189 --> 00:02:01,420
They're going to open your email

64
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:02,579
and read what you have to say,

65
00:02:02,659 --> 00:02:03,079
right?

66
00:02:03,129 --> 00:02:04,310
And chances are, they're going to

67
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:05,349
be like, oh, congrats on your

68
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,760
sister's baby, yada, yada.

69
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:08,180
Granted, this is not true that

70
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:09,639
your sister is having a baby.

71
00:02:09,689 --> 00:02:10,990
The whole purpose is to get their

72
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:12,189
attention and show them that

73
00:02:12,189 --> 00:02:13,310
you're a consumer of their

74
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:15,580
brand rather than someone pitching

75
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:16,139
them.

76
00:02:16,189 --> 00:02:17,289
And this works really well for

77
00:02:17,289 --> 00:02:17,930
e-commerce.

78
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:19,830
So another example, skincare, how

79
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:21,340
do you come off as a consumer of

80
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:22,229
their brands?

81
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:22,819
Here's how.

82
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:27,219
So my cousin sent me one of the

83
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:32,039
company's Instagram posts the

84
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:34,139
other day.

85
00:02:34,189 --> 00:02:37,979
It looks like you're on her

86
00:02:38,069 --> 00:02:41,360
Christmas wish list.

87
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:43,020
Now, I'm writing this right around

88
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:44,530
Christmas time, 2022.

89
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:46,689
So obviously, Christmas is super

90
00:02:46,689 --> 00:02:47,500
relevant.

91
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:48,800
If it's not around Christmas, you

92
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,729
can do something like her

93
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:50,300
birthday.

94
00:02:50,349 --> 00:02:52,090
But either way, you want to show

95
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,969
the brand owner that you're doing

96
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,259
some shopping for your

97
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:57,050
cousin's birthday or her wedding

98
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,500
or her Christmas gift.

99
00:02:58,550 --> 00:02:59,949
Whatever it might be, this line is

100
00:02:59,949 --> 00:03:01,319
going to get their attention and

101
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:02,240
make it seem like you're

102
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:02,919
a fan of the brand.

103
00:03:02,969 --> 00:03:03,879
And it's going to get them to open

104
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:04,560
it and respond.

105
00:03:04,729 --> 00:03:06,520
And the cool thing about these

106
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,349
kind of lines is, okay, so say

107
00:03:08,379 --> 00:03:10,240
you're a TikTok marketer.

108
00:03:10,289 --> 00:03:11,770
You can say something like, based

109
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:14,729
on your Instagram, I think your

110
00:03:14,729 --> 00:03:19,259
products would be a huge hit on

111
00:03:19,259 --> 00:03:19,719
TikTok.

112
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:20,479
Boom.

113
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:22,900
Now you can say TikTok CTA, right?

114
00:03:22,949 --> 00:03:24,789
It's a really smooth transition

115
00:03:24,789 --> 00:03:26,469
from opener to middle line to

116
00:03:26,469 --> 00:03:28,120
transition into TikTok.

117
00:03:28,169 --> 00:03:31,240
Or based on your Instagram, I

118
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:34,530
imagine you're getting a lot of

119
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:37,780
opt-ins to your email list.

120
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:40,210
Klaviyo CTA, right?

121
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:41,900
Like no matter what offer you

122
00:03:41,909 --> 00:03:43,719
have, you can transition your

123
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:45,460
opener into your pitch really

124
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:46,000
seamlessly.

125
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:48,430
As opposed to like, saw you went

126
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:50,759
to Harvard, you know, really

127
00:03:50,949 --> 00:03:52,060
impressive.

128
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:53,780
And then being like curious, are

129
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,000
you looking for more email

130
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:55,819
revenue?

131
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,080
Like it just doesn't flow the way

132
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,259
that the openers I'm showing you

133
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:58,740
flow.

134
00:03:58,789 --> 00:04:00,680
So yeah, really pick a specific

135
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,460
niche and get really, really

136
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:04,360
targeted with that opener.

137
00:04:04,409 --> 00:04:05,740
And then local business in your

138
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:06,150
city.

139
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:07,379
Say you're targeting restaurants.

140
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:08,909
You could do something like, I'm

141
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:14,530
looking for a new restaurant for

142
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:19,399
my wife and I's anniversary dinner

143
00:04:19,449 --> 00:04:23,220
and came across companies' website

144
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,920
from Google.

145
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:29,500
Looks like you have some delicious

146
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:32,079
dishes, right?

147
00:04:32,129 --> 00:04:33,139
Any restaurant owner reading this

148
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:34,129
is going to be like, oh, they're

149
00:04:34,129 --> 00:04:35,019
giving me a compliment.

150
00:04:35,069 --> 00:04:36,040
Let me hear what they have to say.

151
00:04:36,089 --> 00:04:37,449
And it kind of shows that you did

152
00:04:37,449 --> 00:04:38,870
your research and it's more of a

153
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:40,500
personalized approach than,

154
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:42,560
you know, a blasted cold email out

155
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,790
to a thousand people.

156
00:04:44,449 --> 00:04:46,009
Once again, it is an email blasted

157
00:04:46,009 --> 00:04:47,339
out to thousands of people.

158
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:48,649
But the whole point of this opener

159
00:04:48,649 --> 00:04:49,779
is to make it seem like it's super

160
00:04:49,779 --> 00:04:51,399
personalized and well-researched.

161
00:04:51,449 --> 00:04:53,189
So that's scenario one.

162
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,779
I'm going to pause real quick and

163
00:04:54,779 --> 00:04:56,139
go through scenario two.

164
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,540
And then I'll be back on video to

165
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:58,279
talk it over.

166
00:04:58,329 --> 00:04:59,399
So be right back.

167
00:04:59,449 --> 00:05:00,860
All right.

168
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:03,660
So scenario two, this is where if

169
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:06,180
you're targeting like recently

170
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:12,670
funded startups, law firms, local

171
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,420
businesses, et cetera.

172
00:05:14,569 --> 00:05:16,660
So a lot of these target audiences

173
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:18,810
for this scenario could also apply

174
00:05:18,889 --> 00:05:20,639
up here to like a fan of their

175
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:21,379
brand.

176
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:23,379
But the main one is for recently

177
00:05:23,379 --> 00:05:24,740
funded startups.

178
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:26,269
So, you know, if you're scraping

179
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:27,680
the list of recently funded

180
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,139
startups, you could open your

181
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:32,389
email with congrats on company's

182
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:35,360
recent funding round.

183
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:39,730
It's super inspiring to see your

184
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,220
recent growth.

185
00:05:44,209 --> 00:05:45,829
And then, you know, you're just

186
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:47,540
stroking their ego, making them

187
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:49,370
feel good, be happy emotionally so

188
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:51,009
that they're more open to reading

189
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:53,009
what you're going to pitch them as

190
00:05:53,009 --> 00:05:54,740
opposed to, you know, if they're

191
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:55,709
having a bad day and they just

192
00:05:55,709 --> 00:05:57,250
read your email, they're going to

193
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:58,589
not give you, they're going to

194
00:05:58,589 --> 00:05:59,350
tell you to screw off.

195
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:00,620
But if you give them this nice

196
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:01,980
compliment in the opener, it's

197
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:03,230
going to get them to see, oh,

198
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:04,629
they're congratulating me and my

199
00:06:04,629 --> 00:06:05,279
funding.

200
00:06:05,329 --> 00:06:07,910
And then you can maybe translate

201
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:10,810
it to something like, you know, as

202
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:13,540
you look to deploy your marketing

203
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:17,279
budget, I'm sure you're looking

204
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:21,420
for profitable ways to acquire new

205
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:23,180
customers.

206
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:25,959
We can help you XYZ, right?

207
00:06:26,009 --> 00:06:27,389
Like it's a really smooth pitch

208
00:06:27,389 --> 00:06:28,879
from the opener into your actual

209
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:30,310
pitch and what you're trying to

210
00:06:30,329 --> 00:06:31,060
sell them.

211
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:33,410
Another example, top businesses in

212
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:34,029
the area.

213
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:35,529
Say you're going after like law

214
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:36,920
firms who get pitched nonstop in

215
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,600
the inbox.

216
00:06:37,649 --> 00:06:40,449
We're getting pitched nonstop in

217
00:06:40,449 --> 00:06:42,339
the inbox, right?

218
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:43,579
You could give them a nice

219
00:06:43,579 --> 00:06:45,139
compliment so that they're less

220
00:06:45,139 --> 00:06:46,939
abrasive to reading your email.

221
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:51,019
Like was doing a search for the

222
00:06:51,019 --> 00:06:55,740
top law firms in Tampa, Florida

223
00:06:55,740 --> 00:07:01,139
and came across company's website.

224
00:07:01,189 --> 00:07:05,399
You have some amazing reviews.

225
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,899
I'll keep you in mind if I, I

226
00:07:07,899 --> 00:07:10,449
don't actually know if you want to

227
00:07:10,649 --> 00:07:12,949
go down this route, but I don't

228
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,550
know if I ever need, I don't want

229
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,399
to say ever need a divorce

230
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:19,480
attorney, but you get what I'm

231
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,220
saying.

232
00:07:20,269 --> 00:07:21,680
If you just keep it at this, but

233
00:07:21,689 --> 00:07:23,160
basically they know that you're

234
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:24,980
searching for a law firm in Tampa.

235
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:27,370
They're saying, oh, you're, this

236
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:28,720
person's recognizing me as a top

237
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,819
law firm in Tampa.

238
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:31,220
Let me hear what they have to say.

239
00:07:31,269 --> 00:07:32,040
They did the research.

240
00:07:32,089 --> 00:07:33,420
They like my website, yada, yada,

241
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:33,829
right?

242
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:35,319
You're just making a good first

243
00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:36,829
impression on them as opposed to

244
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,230
just going into a pitch.

245
00:07:39,649 --> 00:07:41,019
And then a senior level position.

246
00:07:41,069 --> 00:07:42,990
So you're going after like a CEO

247
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:45,500
or a CMO at like a fortune 500.

248
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:48,720
You could say something like

249
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:52,540
really impressed by what you've

250
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:55,560
accomplished as the CEO of

251
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:57,089
company.

252
00:07:57,149 --> 00:07:59,689
You know, not many major

253
00:07:59,689 --> 00:08:03,470
corporations have your kind of

254
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:05,529
track record.

255
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:07,970
Basically, if you're, you know,

256
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,779
recently funded startups, senior

257
00:08:09,779 --> 00:08:11,660
level, top businesses, any way

258
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:13,870
that you can approach a prospect

259
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:15,879
and stroke the ego for a bit and

260
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:17,750
warm them up to your pitch is

261
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,319
going to help you.

262
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:21,069
I'm sure these are just three

263
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,519
specific examples.

264
00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:23,870
You could probably come up with a

265
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:24,959
way to, you know, play to

266
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,269
someone's ego in just about any

267
00:08:26,269 --> 00:08:26,920
scenario.

268
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:28,389
But these are some examples that

269
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:29,769
I've seen with my clients and

270
00:08:29,769 --> 00:08:31,560
people here in Client Ascension.

271
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:34,440
So, okay, scenario three, tap into

272
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,320
a pain point or desire.

273
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:39,870
This is good for just about any

274
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:41,418
industry.

275
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:45,250
It's best when you have a specific

276
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:46,519
offer.

277
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:50,340
A no-brainer offer, actually.

278
00:08:50,389 --> 00:08:51,879
So I like to use this kind of

279
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:53,629
opener when it's a no-brainer

280
00:08:53,649 --> 00:08:55,450
offer, like a sales agency or a

281
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:57,500
lead gen agency or a guarantee.

282
00:08:57,549 --> 00:08:58,750
If you have a guarantee in your

283
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,149
offer, this is going to be a great

284
00:09:00,149 --> 00:09:00,440
one.

285
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:01,100
Here's what I mean.

286
00:09:01,149 --> 00:09:05,340
So as, you know, as the founder of

287
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:09,850
a fast-growing agency, I'm sure, I

288
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:13,240
mean, this is like a pain point

289
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:15,759
and a desire.

290
00:09:15,809 --> 00:09:16,899
Let me try to find a better one.

291
00:09:19,629 --> 00:09:22,519
I'm sure you know how hard it is

292
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:26,059
to find motivated, experienced

293
00:09:26,059 --> 00:09:27,620
sales reps.

294
00:09:27,669 --> 00:09:31,610
You know, we can place a

295
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:37,389
commission-only sales rep on your

296
00:09:37,389 --> 00:09:38,840
team.

297
00:09:43,389 --> 00:09:45,580
Meaning they only get paid a cut

298
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:48,840
of the deals they close for you.

299
00:09:48,889 --> 00:09:52,250
Can't type, but you get what I'm

300
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:53,980
saying here.

301
00:09:54,029 --> 00:09:55,610
Where, you know, we're saying we

302
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:57,399
can place a commission-only rep.

303
00:09:58,250 --> 00:09:59,990
Is this something you'd be

304
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:02,039
interested in discussing any

305
00:10:02,129 --> 00:10:03,429
further, right?

306
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:05,100
So the pain point, they can't find

307
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:06,139
experienced reps.

308
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:08,080
We know that if you have a really

309
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,269
deep knowledge in an industry like

310
00:10:10,269 --> 00:10:12,399
agency life, SaaS companies,

311
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:13,679
startups, and you know a pain

312
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:15,159
point that is true for you and is

313
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:16,600
also true for anyone else that

314
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,250
you're reaching out to, just

315
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:19,360
mention that.

316
00:10:19,529 --> 00:10:20,559
Like, I'm sure you know how hard

317
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:21,710
it is to find motivated reps.

318
00:10:21,769 --> 00:10:23,330
I'm sure you're frustrated with

319
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:24,840
how dried up the talent pool is

320
00:10:24,909 --> 00:10:26,279
for sales reps right now.

321
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:27,730
And then go into your pitch of, we

322
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:29,000
can place a rep on your team,

323
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,539
right?

324
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:31,970
The reason I say you want to have

325
00:10:32,059 --> 00:10:34,539
a really specific offer for this

326
00:10:34,539 --> 00:10:36,759
is because if you offer something

327
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,850
like, what's a random, like, I

328
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:41,690
don't know, I don't want to insult

329
00:10:42,139 --> 00:10:42,899
any offers here.

330
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:44,679
But, like, say you do, I don't

331
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:46,570
know, end-to-end marketing for a

332
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,429
company, like branding, logo

333
00:10:48,429 --> 00:10:50,059
design, everything.

334
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:51,529
You can't say, like, as the

335
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:53,480
founder of a fast-growing agency,

336
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,080
I'm sure you know how hard it is

337
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,559
to get a good logo or to have a

338
00:10:56,559 --> 00:10:58,000
good brand strategy.

339
00:10:58,049 --> 00:10:59,039
Because someone reading that,

340
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:00,110
they're not going to say that and

341
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:01,399
be like, oh, yeah, that's true.

342
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:02,740
Like, I hate, you know, I wake up

343
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:04,000
in the morning and I'm wondering

344
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,059
how I can have a better brand

345
00:11:05,059 --> 00:11:05,690
strategy.

346
00:11:05,769 --> 00:11:06,159
Like, no.

347
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:07,419
People wake up and they want to

348
00:11:07,419 --> 00:11:08,779
know how to make more money, get

349
00:11:08,779 --> 00:11:09,990
more calls, find better team

350
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:10,720
members.

351
00:11:10,769 --> 00:11:12,899
There's, like, really tangible

352
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:14,980
things that you can quantify in an

353
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:15,470
email.

354
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:17,190
So, what does this look like as a

355
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:17,740
desire?

356
00:11:17,789 --> 00:11:22,179
As the founder of a fast-growing

357
00:11:22,179 --> 00:11:25,940
SaaS product, I'm sure you're

358
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:29,450
always looking for more qualified

359
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:30,480
demos.

360
00:11:31,909 --> 00:11:36,379
We can book eight to 12 demos on

361
00:11:36,379 --> 00:11:40,110
your calendar each month on a

362
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:43,340
pay-per-call basis.

363
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:46,279
Meaning you only pay once they

364
00:11:46,529 --> 00:11:48,580
show up to the demo.

365
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:50,159
Right?

366
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:51,899
So, you know that SaaS companies

367
00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:53,779
are probably looking for demos.

368
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:55,309
Agencies are looking for qualified

369
00:11:55,559 --> 00:11:56,029
calls.

370
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:56,279
Right?

371
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:58,509
No-brainer offer.

372
00:11:58,570 --> 00:11:59,279
They know it.

373
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:00,519
They know that they need it at all

374
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:01,850
times and it's something that it's

375
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:02,940
going to get the reply.

376
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:05,879
So, you know, CTA.

377
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:09,470
So, that's tapping into a pain

378
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:10,299
point or desire.

379
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:11,870
Only use that if you have a pretty

380
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,309
tangible, quantifiable,

381
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:14,769
straightforward offer or a

382
00:12:14,769 --> 00:12:15,820
no-brainer offer.

383
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:17,080
And you know your industry really

384
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:17,440
well.

385
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:18,759
Because the last thing you want to

386
00:12:18,759 --> 00:12:20,049
do is say, like, I'm sure you're

387
00:12:20,049 --> 00:12:21,100
always looking for X.

388
00:12:21,149 --> 00:12:22,070
And they're like, I've actually

389
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:23,100
never looked for X in my life.

390
00:12:23,149 --> 00:12:24,129
Because then you're just going to

391
00:12:24,129 --> 00:12:24,840
look unqualified.

392
00:12:26,289 --> 00:12:27,340
So, that's that scenario.

393
00:12:27,389 --> 00:12:28,669
And scenario four, building

394
00:12:28,669 --> 00:12:29,240
rapport.

395
00:12:29,289 --> 00:12:32,669
This is best if you're reaching

396
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:36,250
out to the same industry that you

397
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,919
operate in.

398
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:39,500
Here's what I mean by this.

399
00:12:39,549 --> 00:12:40,860
If you're reaching out to agencies

400
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,110
and you're an agency owner, you

401
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:43,529
could say something like, you

402
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:44,080
know,

403
00:12:44,129 --> 00:12:48,450
as a fellow agency owner, super

404
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,509
impressed by your growth with

405
00:12:52,549 --> 00:12:54,220
company.

406
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:58,570
I've actually run a B2B legion

407
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:02,389
agency for, you know, the past X

408
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:03,580
years.

409
00:13:03,629 --> 00:13:09,129
I've scaled my agency to 100K MRR

410
00:13:09,129 --> 00:13:11,399
in that time.

411
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:15,179
And I have a blueprint to help you

412
00:13:15,179 --> 00:13:16,879
do the same.

413
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:20,720
Interested in hearing some growth

414
00:13:20,809 --> 00:13:23,240
ideas I had in mind.

415
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,399
So, in this case, if you're

416
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,350
reaching out to an industry that's

417
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:28,960
the exact same industry that

418
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,759
you're in.

419
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:30,899
And you have a proven track

420
00:13:30,899 --> 00:13:31,389
record.

421
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:32,299
You've had success.

422
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:33,440
You can help them with the same

423
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,919
things that you've accomplished.

424
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:36,539
You can make a whole angle that's

425
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:37,870
basically like a resume.

426
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:39,200
Like, hey, look, I've run this

427
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,379
agency for this many years.

428
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:41,460
I've accomplished this.

429
00:13:41,509 --> 00:13:43,210
And I can help you do the same.

430
00:13:43,269 --> 00:13:43,559
Right?

431
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,429
Like, you can't reach out to an

432
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:47,210
e-commerce brand as a Klaviyo

433
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:49,029
owner and be like, I've actually

434
00:13:49,029 --> 00:13:50,269
run a Klaviyo agency for two

435
00:13:50,269 --> 00:13:50,799
years.

436
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:52,179
I've scaled through.

437
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:54,149
Maybe you even could say, like,

438
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:55,600
I've scaled four other skincare

439
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,190
brands to 100K and I can scale

440
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:57,899
yours too.

441
00:13:57,950 --> 00:13:58,179
Right?

442
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:00,240
Like, just basically if you're in,

443
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,169
if you've accomplished something

444
00:14:02,169 --> 00:14:03,970
that the person you're reaching

445
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:05,399
out to also wants to accomplish

446
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,720
and they're in your industry, you

447
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,129
can reach out to them with a line

448
00:14:09,129 --> 00:14:09,769
like this.

449
00:14:09,889 --> 00:14:10,620
And it's going to get a lot of

450
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:11,200
great results.

451
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:11,519
Right?

452
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:13,220
Same job role.

453
00:14:13,289 --> 00:14:13,919
This is one.

454
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:15,039
This is going to be a lot easier

455
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:15,639
to explain.

456
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:15,860
Right?

457
00:14:15,909 --> 00:14:20,610
So, you know, noticed you're the

458
00:14:20,809 --> 00:14:23,080
CMO of company.

459
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:27,009
I actually have a really great

460
00:14:27,009 --> 00:14:29,340
opener for this.

461
00:14:29,389 --> 00:14:30,309
I'm going to dig it up real quick

462
00:14:30,309 --> 00:14:31,240
and I'll be right back on.

463
00:14:31,289 --> 00:14:33,399
All right.

464
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:35,340
So, for this example, say you're

465
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:36,740
reaching out to the VPs of

466
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,620
e-commerce at a bunch of clothing

467
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:39,330
brands.

468
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:39,700
Right?

469
00:14:39,889 --> 00:14:41,919
And this is the opener that I like

470
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:43,669
to use if there's the same job

471
00:14:43,769 --> 00:14:44,519
title.

472
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:46,220
So, as the former VP of e-commerce

473
00:14:46,299 --> 00:14:47,940
for a fast growing brand, I know

474
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,039
how important it is to

475
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:50,750
consistently acquire and retain

476
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:51,740
new customers.

477
00:14:51,889 --> 00:14:56,029
I scaled XYZ company as their VP

478
00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:59,889
of e-com in under X years and I

479
00:14:59,889 --> 00:15:03,970
have Blueprint to help you do the

480
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,480
same.

481
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:09,889
So, might you be interested in

482
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:13,149
hearing a few growth ideas I had

483
00:15:13,159 --> 00:15:15,480
in mind for company?

484
00:15:15,529 --> 00:15:15,980
Right?

485
00:15:16,769 --> 00:15:21,600
Right.

486
00:15:21,649 --> 00:15:22,509
So, these two kind of tie

487
00:15:22,529 --> 00:15:23,039
together.

488
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:24,110
Like, they don't have to be the

489
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:24,740
same job role.

490
00:15:24,789 --> 00:15:26,179
It doesn't necessarily have to be

491
00:15:26,179 --> 00:15:27,169
the same industry.

492
00:15:28,429 --> 00:15:30,240
All you want to say is, you know,

493
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,970
you're an agency owner, I'm an

494
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:33,059
agency owner.

495
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:33,970
As a fellow, I might have even

496
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:35,220
done these backwards to be honest.

497
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:37,120
Like, this could probably go up

498
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,809
here to the industry and this

499
00:15:38,809 --> 00:15:41,019
could probably go to the job role.

500
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:42,769
But either way, all you're doing

501
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:44,529
is stating how you're in the exact

502
00:15:44,529 --> 00:15:46,120
same shoes that they're in,

503
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,070
whether it's job title or

504
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:47,590
industry.

505
00:15:47,789 --> 00:15:49,070
You know, as a former VP of

506
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:50,710
e-commerce for a brand similar to

507
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,500
yours, this is what I accomplished

508
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:54,039
and I can help you accomplish

509
00:15:54,039 --> 00:15:56,299
something similar, right?

510
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:58,629
So, where these angles work the

511
00:15:58,629 --> 00:16:00,679
best is in an offer where it's

512
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:03,029
like holistic growth partner,

513
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:05,110
outsourced CMO, you know,

514
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:07,159
end-to-end marketing.

515
00:16:07,409 --> 00:16:08,830
Like, anything that's hard to

516
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,250
quantify in an email where you

517
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,940
can't say, like, you know, ads,

518
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,659
paid ads, UGC, emails, where it's

519
00:16:13,659 --> 00:16:15,120
like a bunch of stuff piled into

520
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,639
one offer, like, kind of like a

521
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,960
consulting offer.

522
00:16:18,009 --> 00:16:19,690
This is where you should go with

523
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:21,340
an opener, like, as a fellow

524
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:23,049
agency owner, as a former VP of

525
00:16:23,049 --> 00:16:24,950
e-commerce, you know, I've ran a

526
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:26,539
B2B lead gen agency.

527
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:28,000
I was a VP of e-com for this

528
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:29,159
brand, right?

529
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:31,309
Like, using your past experience

530
00:16:31,309 --> 00:16:33,309
as a cold email angle and getting

531
00:16:33,309 --> 00:16:34,639
replies that way.

532
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:36,389
So, long story short, there's four

533
00:16:36,419 --> 00:16:38,070
different scenarios, acting as a

534
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:39,789
fan of their brands, typically for

535
00:16:39,789 --> 00:16:41,799
e-commerce brands, stroking their

536
00:16:41,799 --> 00:16:43,740
ego if they're recently funded, if

537
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,600
they're a business in the area, if

538
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,409
they're a high-level position at a

539
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,730
big company, tapping into a pain

540
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:51,159
point or desire.

541
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:52,470
If you have a really tangible

542
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:53,889
offer and you know the industry

543
00:16:53,889 --> 00:16:55,460
you're reaching out to very well,

544
00:16:55,529 --> 00:16:56,940
you can use something like, as a

545
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,379
founder, you know, I'm sure you

546
00:16:58,690 --> 00:16:59,730
know how hard it is to find,

547
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:01,230
motivated sales reps, or you're

548
00:17:01,269 --> 00:17:03,269
looking for more qualified demos.

549
00:17:04,029 --> 00:17:05,440
And then scenario four, building

550
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:06,920
rapport, if you're in a similar

551
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:08,598
industry or a similar job role as

552
00:17:08,598 --> 00:17:10,180
the prospect you're reaching out

553
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:13,828
to, and your offer is vague,

554
00:17:14,088 --> 00:17:19,039
growth partner, outsourced, CMO,

555
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,078
etc.

556
00:17:21,009 --> 00:17:22,309
So, hopefully these are all

557
00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:22,920
helpful.

558
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:24,240
I'll post a link to this doc as

559
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,640
well under the video so you can

560
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,289
check them out on your own time.

561
00:17:27,348 --> 00:17:29,089
And yeah, take all of these angles

562
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:30,970
and all of these openers, rather,

563
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,759
and put them into your own words,

564
00:17:32,759 --> 00:17:34,329
spin them up into the industry

you're going after, and I

00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:38,640
opens and a lot more good replies.

00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:40,019
