1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,840
Okay, in this video, I'm going to

2
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:03,029
show you how to structure your

3
00:00:03,029 --> 00:00:03,980
lead generation offer

4
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:05,929
in such a fashion that it becomes

5
00:00:05,929 --> 00:00:08,019
a no-brainer for people to say yes

6
00:00:08,019 --> 00:00:09,019
and become your first couple

7
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:09,560
clients.

8
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,400
This is the exact same offer

9
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,560
structure that I used four years

10
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:13,810
ago

11
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:15,099
to start my lead generation

12
00:00:15,099 --> 00:00:16,300
business from scratch.

13
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,760
I had no past experience.

14
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:18,879
I had no case studies.

15
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:20,359
I had no one to vouch for me.

16
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:21,550
I had no confidence yet.

17
00:00:21,559 --> 00:00:22,820
And if you're watching this,

18
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:24,359
you're in that exact same position

19
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:24,879
probably

20
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:26,579
that I was in four years ago.

21
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:28,480
So I'm going to show you how to

22
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,850
sell your services on a

23
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:31,160
pay-per-call basis

24
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,100
so people are only paying you once

25
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,799
you deliver them a sales call

26
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:36,270
because it makes it really easy

27
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:37,840
for someone to say yes, I'll give

28
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:38,500
it a shot.

29
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,060
I don't have to pay you any money

30
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:40,679
up front.

31
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:42,520
And it's going to help you build

32
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,280
confidence

33
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,299
because you'll get your first

34
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:45,299
couple clients in the door

35
00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:46,219
and you'll start getting

36
00:00:46,219 --> 00:00:47,429
experience in your first couple

37
00:00:47,429 --> 00:00:48,100
case studies.

38
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:49,439
If you're watching this and you're

39
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:50,359
a complete beginner,

40
00:00:50,359 --> 00:00:51,670
you're going to be nervous on your

41
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:52,820
first couple sales calls.

42
00:00:52,859 --> 00:00:53,600
You're going to be shaking.

43
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,490
You're going to be stuttering a

44
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:54,960
little bit.

45
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:55,969
That's completely fine.

46
00:00:55,969 --> 00:00:57,109
That's part of the process.

47
00:00:57,119 --> 00:00:58,969
I still get nervous for some sales

48
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:00,390
calls, but you're a complete

49
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:00,820
beginner,

50
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:01,859
so it's completely fine that you

51
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:02,530
get nervous.

52
00:01:02,539 --> 00:01:04,310
Here's how to sell your services

53
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:05,700
in a way that overcomes the

54
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:06,379
nerves,

55
00:01:06,379 --> 00:01:08,180
overcomes the lack of experience,

56
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:09,480
and gets somebody to say,

57
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,390
you know what, I'll give it a

58
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:10,650
shot.

59
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:11,329
Let's try it out.

60
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:13,579
So before we dive in, I want to

61
00:01:13,579 --> 00:01:15,200
talk about using your own

62
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:16,579
instincts, right,

63
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:18,430
because there are no rules in this

64
00:01:18,489 --> 00:01:20,129
game like I said before, and I'll

65
00:01:20,129 --> 00:01:20,540
say again.

66
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:21,989
You can sell your services in

67
00:01:21,989 --> 00:01:23,579
whatever fashion you want.

68
00:01:23,579 --> 00:01:25,250
I'm simply recommending what

69
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:26,980
worked for me and what helped me

70
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:28,700
sign my first couple of clients.

71
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:30,909
Throughout this entire program, I

72
00:01:30,909 --> 00:01:32,370
want you to use your own critical

73
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:33,260
thinking skills,

74
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,129
your own gut instincts, and your

75
00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:37,329
own business acumen because you're

76
00:01:37,329 --> 00:01:38,530
a smart person.

77
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:39,760
You invested in yourself.

78
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,840
You're here watching this video

79
00:01:40,859 --> 00:01:41,359
right now.

80
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:42,530
You're ahead of 99% of the

81
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:43,209
population.

82
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:45,650
Trust yourself and your gut

83
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:47,219
instincts and do what you think is

84
00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:48,060
best, right?

85
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,379
Just because I'm telling you to do

86
00:01:49,379 --> 00:01:50,760
something doesn't mean you have to

87
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,840
copy it word for word.

88
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,530
The most successful business

89
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,000
people that I know have the

90
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,540
ability to think on the fly

91
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:59,000
and think on their feet and have

92
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:01,900
their own compass that guides them

93
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,170
without just copying people word

94
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:03,640
for word.

95
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,819
So keep that in mind as I go

96
00:02:04,819 --> 00:02:05,659
through this.

97
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:07,260
Here is what worked for me and

98
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,180
what will most likely work for you

99
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:10,210
as you just start out in this

100
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:10,830
business.

101
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,639
So let's dive in.

102
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,360
Okay, so pay per call is the offer

103
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,800
structure that you're going to

104
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,219
want to follow

105
00:02:18,229 --> 00:02:20,680
where you only collect an invoice

106
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:23,259
from somebody per sales call that

107
00:02:23,259 --> 00:02:24,849
you book for them.

108
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,849
300 bucks a call, 200 bucks a

109
00:02:26,849 --> 00:02:27,659
call, right?

110
00:02:27,659 --> 00:02:29,020
Doesn't matter how much you charge

111
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:29,430
for it.

112
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:30,610
That is the structure that you

113
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:31,289
want to follow.

114
00:02:31,349 --> 00:02:32,319
Why?

115
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:34,020
Because it creates a win-win

116
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,069
scenario for you and your client,

117
00:02:36,069 --> 00:02:36,719
right?

118
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:38,210
You're getting paid for the number

119
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:39,610
of sales calls that you generate

120
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:40,060
for them.

121
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,759
If you generate them 10 calls at

122
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:43,699
$200 a call, you're collecting a

123
00:02:43,699 --> 00:02:45,419
$2,000 invoice, right?

124
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,580
Okay, hold on one second.

125
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:49,879
I need to refresh my background

126
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:51,199
because it's not scrolling.

127
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:51,759
One sec.

128
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:53,159
Okay, I'm back.

129
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:55,830
So you get paid for the calls that

130
00:02:55,849 --> 00:02:57,960
you generate for them.

131
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,810
Your client gets qualified sales

132
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:01,719
calls added to their calendar with

133
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:02,189
no risk

134
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:03,389
because they're only paying you

135
00:03:03,409 --> 00:03:04,560
for a completed sales call.

136
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,520
So you basically have a no stress

137
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,120
situation because if you don't

138
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:08,979
deliver results,

139
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,060
you're not going to get paid so

140
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:11,159
their client will be a lot more

141
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:11,879
patient with you

142
00:03:11,889 --> 00:03:13,319
compared to if they paid you

143
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:14,000
upfront.

144
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,080
You are also not relying on your

145
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,020
client to be good at sales.

146
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:19,379
Think about it for a second.

147
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:20,569
If somebody is paying you a

148
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:22,020
percentage of closed deals,

149
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:24,099
you're only getting paid if they

150
00:03:24,099 --> 00:03:25,080
close a client.

151
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,439
And if they're bad at sales,

152
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:27,780
you're not going to get paid

153
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:28,639
because they're not going to close

154
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:29,099
any clients.

155
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:31,400
So you basically charge at the

156
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,259
point where you pass the

157
00:03:33,259 --> 00:03:35,500
responsibility over to them.

158
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,240
Your responsibility is all the way

159
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,860
up until a sales call is booked on

160
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:39,840
their calendar.

161
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,120
You charge your $200, $300 per

162
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:43,780
call.

163
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:45,180
And then you say, you know what?

164
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,599
I don't even care what happens to

165
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:47,520
this sales call.

166
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,699
It's completely up to my client.

167
00:03:48,819 --> 00:03:49,800
They can go close them.

168
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,789
And if they're bad at sales, you

169
00:03:51,789 --> 00:03:52,550
still get paid.

170
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,919
That's not being selfish.

171
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:55,449
That's just being a good business

172
00:03:55,449 --> 00:03:56,870
owner and charging what you're

173
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:57,719
worth, right?

174
00:03:57,719 --> 00:04:00,289
Like imagine you book somebody 20

175
00:04:00,289 --> 00:04:01,759
sales calls and you're working

176
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:02,580
fully on commission.

177
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,430
How mad would you be if they

178
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:06,099
didn't close a single deal out of

179
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,060
20 calls?

180
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:08,629
You did all this good work.

181
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:09,879
You got them 20 calls booked.

182
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:11,300
You haven't been paid yet.

183
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,560
You're ready to cash in on a big

184
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,199
payday because they told you,

185
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:15,240
oh man, you'll get so much

186
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:16,839
commission once we close the deal.

187
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:17,860
And then they don't close a single

188
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:18,300
client.

189
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,079
You're going to be pissed.

190
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:21,230
So for that reason, you should

191
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:23,500
charge per booked sales call.

192
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:25,360
Let's say you have a client who

193
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,579
sells TikTok marketing services to

194
00:04:27,579 --> 00:04:28,480
restaurants

195
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,329
and you get them 10 calls booked

196
00:04:30,389 --> 00:04:32,240
with 10 restaurant owners.

197
00:04:32,899 --> 00:04:34,519
You get paid once that sales call

198
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:35,899
is added to their calendar.

199
00:04:35,899 --> 00:04:37,910
And the amount that you charge is

200
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:39,430
completely up to you.

201
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:41,000
When I started out in business

202
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,910
four years ago, we were charging

203
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:45,139
$250 per booked sales call.

204
00:04:45,139 --> 00:04:46,569
And then as we got more confident

205
00:04:46,569 --> 00:04:47,939
and got better at what we did and

206
00:04:47,939 --> 00:04:48,920
got more results,

207
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,129
we bumped it up to $300 per call

208
00:04:51,129 --> 00:04:53,269
and then up to $350 per booked

209
00:04:53,269 --> 00:04:53,899
call.

210
00:04:53,899 --> 00:04:55,449
The key thing to know, like I

211
00:04:55,449 --> 00:04:57,220
said, is there are no rules.

212
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:59,319
Charge however much you want and

213
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:01,399
use your own business acumen and

214
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:02,319
gut instinct

215
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,589
to charge a price on the phone,

216
00:05:04,649 --> 00:05:05,199
right?

217
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:06,839
If you're feeling confident and

218
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:08,560
ballsy and you say 500 bucks a

219
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,019
call,

220
00:05:09,029 --> 00:05:10,750
somebody probably will say yes to

221
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,800
you and sign that contract, right?

222
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,750
So don't be afraid to overcharge

223
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,829
and say 500 because if they come

224
00:05:16,829 --> 00:05:17,579
back to you and say,

225
00:05:17,579 --> 00:05:19,319
oh, I can do 300 a call, you still

226
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,439
get a client, right?

227
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,470
So don't be afraid to be a little,

228
00:05:22,529 --> 00:05:25,470
you know, confident and shoot your

229
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:27,269
shot basically, right?

230
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,060
Hey, 500 bucks a call.

231
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:29,920
Oh, I can do 300.

232
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,949
Okay, deal, right?

233
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,779
So charge however much you'd like.

234
00:05:33,779 --> 00:05:35,910
But if you want some mathematical

235
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:38,319
guidance, here's a good formula.

236
00:05:38,329 --> 00:05:40,569
Number one, ask the client how

237
00:05:40,569 --> 00:05:42,879
much a client is worth to them and

238
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:44,519
then ask the client what

239
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:45,550
their close rate is on sales

240
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:46,060
calls.

241
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:47,019
What do I mean by this?

242
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,060
Let's say I'm reaching, I'm on a

243
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:50,600
call with Tom and he runs a TikTok

244
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,839
marketing business.

245
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:54,060
I would go, Tom, just curious, how

246
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,980
much is a client worth to you?

247
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,149
If you sign a client, what, you

248
00:05:58,149 --> 00:06:00,540
know, dollar amount is that client

249
00:06:00,649 --> 00:06:01,500
worth to you?

250
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,540
Based on how much you charge and

251
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:04,790
how long that they stay on with

252
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:06,079
you, they will probably

253
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,860
tell you, oh, five grand.

254
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,459
A client to me is worth $5,000.

255
00:06:09,459 --> 00:06:10,959
I charge $1,000 a month.

256
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:12,689
I typically keep a client for five

257
00:06:12,689 --> 00:06:13,300
months.

258
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,329
So $5,000 is how much a new client

259
00:06:15,329 --> 00:06:16,199
is worth to me.

260
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:17,220
Okay, great.

261
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,589
What's your close rate on sales

262
00:06:18,589 --> 00:06:19,060
calls?

263
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:21,939
How many calls are you closing and

264
00:06:21,939 --> 00:06:24,139
signing on as clients?

265
00:06:24,139 --> 00:06:25,139
What is a close rate?

266
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:26,990
That's just how many conversions

267
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:28,779
you get from the amount of sales

268
00:06:28,779 --> 00:06:30,180
calls that you take.

269
00:06:30,579 --> 00:06:32,339
If they close one in four calls,

270
00:06:32,339 --> 00:06:34,370
their conversion, their close rate

271
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:35,139
is 25%.

272
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,240
Hey, every four calls I get on, I

273
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,180
close one deal and generate one

274
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,149
new client.

275
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:41,420
Okay, Tom.

276
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:43,610
So it takes you four sales calls

277
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:45,889
to sign a client and the client is

278
00:06:45,889 --> 00:06:48,980
worth $5,000 to you, right?

279
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:51,610
Would you be okay with $250 per

280
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:53,209
booked sales call?

281
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:55,350
Because on average, you're going

282
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:58,430
to spend about $1,000, $250 per

283
00:06:58,430 --> 00:06:59,850
call times four calls

284
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,839
to generate a $5,000 client.

285
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:03,079
They're going to go, yeah, that's

286
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:03,939
a no-brainer, man.

287
00:07:03,939 --> 00:07:06,230
I would love to pay $250 a call to

288
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:08,660
get a $5,000 client every four

289
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:09,819
calls, right?

290
00:07:09,819 --> 00:07:12,519
You see how this is making sense?

291
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:13,920
It's just a mathematical equation.

292
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,069
Let's say somebody goes, hey, man,

293
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:18,600
a client is actually worth $30,000

294
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,600
to me because I charge

295
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,790
a lot of money and clients never

296
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:21,449
really leave.

297
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,459
And we close at about a 20% rate.

298
00:07:24,459 --> 00:07:26,100
So every one in five calls that we

299
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,579
take turns into a client.

300
00:07:27,589 --> 00:07:32,310
Okay, would you pay $500, $750 per

301
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:33,160
call?

302
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,120
Oh, you know what?

303
00:07:35,139 --> 00:07:37,579
I would pay $750 per call because

304
00:07:37,579 --> 00:07:39,509
it's going to take me five calls

305
00:07:39,509 --> 00:07:40,699
to close a deal.

306
00:07:40,699 --> 00:07:41,680
What is that?

307
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,600
$750 times five.

308
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,420
That's $3,700 to close a $20,000

309
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:47,000
client.

310
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,500
Yes, that works with me.

311
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:51,149
So you can literally not even come

312
00:07:51,149 --> 00:07:52,959
to the call with a price in mind

313
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:54,259
and then ask your

314
00:07:54,259 --> 00:07:55,399
client a couple of questions.

315
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:56,990
Hey, how much is the client worth

316
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:57,500
to you?

317
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,350
Oh, we keep our clients for a year

318
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:01,339
and we charge two grand a month.

319
00:08:01,389 --> 00:08:03,500
24 grand is what a client is worth

320
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,029
to me.

321
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,779
12 months times two grand, right?

322
00:08:05,779 --> 00:08:07,540
24 grand easily is what I would,

323
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:08,829
you know, how much is what a

324
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:10,060
client is worth to me.

325
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,839
And I close at a 10% rate.

326
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:14,339
It takes me 10 calls to close one

327
00:08:14,339 --> 00:08:14,699
deal.

328
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:16,040
I'm not that good at sales.

329
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,740
I like to do client work a lot

330
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:18,319
more.

331
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:19,680
Okay, great.

332
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,379
Would you pay 300 bucks per call?

333
00:08:21,389 --> 00:08:23,149
Because it's going to take you 10

334
00:08:23,149 --> 00:08:24,879
calls at 300 bucks per call to

335
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:25,800
close a client.

336
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:26,870
They're going to go, you know

337
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:27,220
what?

338
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:28,519
If I'm paying three grand to you

339
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:30,500
to close a $24,000 client, I'm

340
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,779
going to say yes to that

341
00:08:31,779 --> 00:08:32,350
all day long.

342
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:33,570
You see how this mathematical

343
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:34,620
equation makes sense?

344
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,649
As long as the amount, the dollar

345
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:38,320
amount per call that you're

346
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,000
charging them is, you know,

347
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:42,038
a no brainer relative to how much

348
00:08:42,038 --> 00:08:43,980
the client is worth to them.

349
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:45,019
They're going to say yes to you

350
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:46,179
and they're going to want to sign

351
00:08:46,179 --> 00:08:47,340
on and work with your

352
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:48,220
business, right?

353
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:49,740
It's pretty much that simple.

354
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:52,659
And I need to delete.

355
00:08:53,139 --> 00:08:56,399
This is a different document.

356
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:56,919
One second.

357
00:08:56,919 --> 00:08:58,230
I'm going to delete the rest of

358
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:58,940
these tabs.

359
00:08:58,940 --> 00:08:59,509
Okay, great.

360
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,740
So I want to space this out so I

361
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:04,100
can get through the rest of this

362
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,179
text without my face being

363
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,029
in the way because this box is

364
00:09:08,029 --> 00:09:09,679
blocking out the text.

365
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:11,129
But that's basically what I was

366
00:09:11,129 --> 00:09:11,679
saying.

367
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,870
Reverse engineer the math.

368
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:14,950
So if a client is worth $10,000 to

369
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:16,580
a business and they close 20% of

370
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:17,639
their sales calls, they

371
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:19,110
need five calls booked to sign a

372
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:20,690
$10,000 client.

373
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,379
They would be very willing to

374
00:09:22,379 --> 00:09:24,409
spend $400 per call because

375
00:09:24,409 --> 00:09:26,279
they're paying two grand to get

376
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:27,419
a $10,000 client.

377
00:09:27,539 --> 00:09:29,210
This is simple math and it will

378
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:31,100
help with your sales process.

379
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,899
Now, other offer structures,

380
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:34,779
right?

381
00:09:34,779 --> 00:09:35,820
Because let's say, oh man, you

382
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:36,820
know what, Christian?

383
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,240
I don't want to charge just on

384
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,100
performance.

385
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,009
I want to be compensated for my

386
00:09:41,009 --> 00:09:42,460
time ahead of time as well.

387
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:43,740
No problem.

388
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:45,100
Here's what else you can do.

389
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:50,279
Monthly tech fee plus pay per

390
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:51,740
call.

391
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,299
Honestly, I would recommend a tech

392
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,529
fee of some sort because there is

393
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:57,919
a tech expense related

394
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:00,970
to or involved with running your

395
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:02,360
campaigns.

396
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,590
It's going to cost a fixed amount

397
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:04,820
of dollars every month to run cold

398
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:05,759
email campaigns.

399
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:07,299
You need inboxes, you need

400
00:10:07,299 --> 00:10:09,080
domains, you need a sending tool,

401
00:10:09,139 --> 00:10:10,720
and you need leads, right?

402
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,980
So there's a couple of different

403
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:13,019
components of a cold email

404
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:14,500
campaign that costs actual money.

405
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,360
If you explain this to somebody on

406
00:10:16,389 --> 00:10:18,230
the phone, they will most likely

407
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:19,539
be willing to cover the

408
00:10:19,539 --> 00:10:21,000
cost of the technology, right?

409
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,220
Oh, sure, Christian.

410
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:23,269
I'll pay you the money that it

411
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,580
costs to run the software if you

412
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:25,659
just do it all for me.

413
00:10:25,659 --> 00:10:26,299
Okay, great.

414
00:10:26,299 --> 00:10:28,970
So now, what can we do here,

415
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:29,940
right?

416
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:32,149
Oh, the monthly tech fee is going

417
00:10:32,149 --> 00:10:34,679
to be $500 per month to cover the

418
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:35,460
tech costs.

419
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:40,389
And then plus $250 per booked

420
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:43,559
sales call, right?

421
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:45,129
Hey, man, you know what?

422
00:10:45,139 --> 00:10:46,600
It's going to cost us about $500

423
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,960
to run this system every month.

424
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,370
So that's what we're going to

425
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:50,899
charge you no matter what every

426
00:10:50,899 --> 00:10:51,440
month.

427
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,350
And then it's going to be $250 per

428
00:10:53,409 --> 00:10:54,539
booked sales call.

429
00:10:54,539 --> 00:10:56,649
You know, factoring in how much a

430
00:10:56,649 --> 00:10:58,769
client is worth to you, this is

431
00:10:58,779 --> 00:11:00,500
still plenty of leeway

432
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:03,539
because you're only paying $1,500

433
00:11:03,549 --> 00:11:06,690
to close a client, $500 plus 250

434
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:08,299
calls times four calls

435
00:11:08,299 --> 00:11:11,639
at your 25% close rate, right?

436
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:16,460
Still a no-brainer because let's

437
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:19,720
say the close rate is 25%.

438
00:11:19,809 --> 00:11:22,610
They need four calls booked to

439
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:24,360
close a client.

440
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:28,559
They would be paying $1,000, 250

441
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:30,990
times four calls, right?

442
00:11:31,009 --> 00:11:34,429
Plus the $500 tech fee equals

443
00:11:34,429 --> 00:11:38,039
$1,500 to sign a client.

444
00:11:38,539 --> 00:11:42,610
As long as this person or as long

445
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:46,820
as a client is worth, you know,

446
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:52,120
$3,000 plus to this person,

447
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,919
they will happily agree to this,

448
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:57,059
right?

449
00:11:57,059 --> 00:11:58,980
Even with the flat tech fee

450
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:01,570
involved, if you price the cost

451
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:04,679
per booked sales call accordingly,

452
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:07,230
people will be happy to pay you

453
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:09,409
the tech fee and the cost per call

454
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,080
pricing

455
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,519
because they're acquiring a client

456
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:12,539
for $1,500.

457
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,899
And if that client is worth $3,000

458
00:12:14,919 --> 00:12:16,659
or more to them, they're going to

459
00:12:16,659 --> 00:12:17,820
happily say yes.

460
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,580
Now, you're probably saying,

461
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:20,940
Christian, why, you know, if

462
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,519
someone's lifetime value of a

463
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:23,779
client,

464
00:12:23,779 --> 00:12:25,429
if a client is worth $1,500 to

465
00:12:25,429 --> 00:12:27,820
somebody, why can't I just charge

466
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,639
this same pricing?

467
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:31,419
Well, because no one's going to

468
00:12:31,419 --> 00:12:33,269
want to pay you $1,500 if their

469
00:12:33,269 --> 00:12:35,309
client is only worth $1,500 to

470
00:12:35,409 --> 00:12:35,740
them

471
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:37,120
because they are literally not

472
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,519
making any money on that client

473
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:39,710
and they're paying you all of the

474
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:40,460
profit margin.

475
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,720
So think on your feet.

476
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,899
Once again, there's no set formula

477
00:12:44,899 --> 00:12:45,460
here.

478
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:46,960
It's just a ballpark range.

479
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:50,039
But, you know, price it in a range

480
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:52,299
that makes it a no-brainer to the

481
00:12:52,299 --> 00:12:53,639
client based on your gut

482
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:54,700
instincts, right?

483
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:58,440
If a client is worth $5,000 to

484
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,350
somebody, you can ramp up this

485
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:02,620
tech fee to $1,000 and the cost

486
00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:04,179
per call to $300.

487
00:13:04,179 --> 00:13:06,480
So they're now paying $2,200 to

488
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,350
acquire a client, but it's worth

489
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:10,120
$5,000, right?

490
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,200
So there's no set number in terms

491
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,129
of what you should be charging

492
00:13:14,129 --> 00:13:16,059
related to how much a client is

493
00:13:16,059 --> 00:13:17,759
worth to your client.

494
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:19,299
But you just want to have a gut

495
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:19,779
feeling.

496
00:13:19,779 --> 00:13:21,440
If it's like 5X, if a client's

497
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,500
worth $5,000 to somebody and

498
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,860
you're only getting paid $1,000 in

499
00:13:25,929 --> 00:13:28,259
total for 250 calls times four

500
00:13:28,259 --> 00:13:28,799
calls,

501
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:30,419
you're going to sign that person

502
00:13:30,419 --> 00:13:31,259
very easily.

503
00:13:31,259 --> 00:13:32,299
They're going to want to work with

504
00:13:32,299 --> 00:13:33,440
you, but they might, you know, you

505
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,679
might be selling yourself short.

506
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:36,179
So find the perfect range where

507
00:13:36,179 --> 00:13:37,769
it's a no-brainer for your client

508
00:13:37,769 --> 00:13:39,240
because the mathematics makes

509
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:40,340
sense for them.

510
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:41,820
The math makes sense for them.

511
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,620
And it's a good situation for you

512
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,090
because you're being paid

513
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:46,840
according to your time and your

514
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,460
value.

515
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,960
You don't want to have a scenario

516
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,759
where you're charging $100 per

517
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:52,679
call and that person is signing

518
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:54,919
clients that are worth 20 grand

519
00:13:54,919 --> 00:13:56,490
because you're getting, you know,

520
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:58,080
$500 for five calls and they're

521
00:13:58,129 --> 00:13:59,980
getting a $20,000 client.

522
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:02,440
So you can price the cost per call

523
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:05,159
in accordance to what it is worth

524
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:06,500
or to what a client is worth to

525
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,240
that business

526
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,820
so you both get upside because

527
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,600
you're getting paid per the calls

528
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,039
booked

529
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:12,889
and your client is getting revenue

530
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:14,519
in the door from the calls that

531
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:15,289
you booked.

532
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:16,909
So hopefully this makes sense.

533
00:14:16,929 --> 00:14:20,080
Once again, there's no rules here.

534
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,399
So if you want to do, you don't,

535
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,820
like, let's say the tech fee

536
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,769
really is $300.

537
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:28,629
It costs you $300 to run a

538
00:14:28,629 --> 00:14:29,379
campaign.

539
00:14:29,379 --> 00:14:32,029
You can show up to a call and say,

540
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:34,000
hey, man, it costs me $1,000 a

541
00:14:34,049 --> 00:14:35,399
month to run this system.

542
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:38,120
You pay the $300.

543
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,259
You pocket the $700 in profit.

544
00:14:40,259 --> 00:14:41,509
They're not going to know that

545
00:14:41,509 --> 00:14:42,559
it's only $300.

546
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:44,080
This is called business.

547
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:47,750
People, you know, make a margin on

548
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:50,519
services because the business

549
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:52,730
owner doesn't really know how much

550
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:54,740
is required to run a campaign.

551
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:56,330
If you say $1,000 and they believe

552
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:57,549
you, you collect the invoice for

553
00:14:57,549 --> 00:15:00,309
$1,000, you pay the $300 in tech

554
00:15:00,309 --> 00:15:02,360
costs, and you pocket $700 in

555
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,919
profit, and then you get the

556
00:15:03,929 --> 00:15:05,559
pay-per-call fee as well.

557
00:15:05,559 --> 00:15:06,820
So if you're a confident

558
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,659
salesperson and you can explain to

559
00:15:08,659 --> 00:15:10,470
somebody why it's a no-brainer for

560
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:12,210
them, you can make a lot of profit

561
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:14,389
margin without doing any extra

562
00:15:14,389 --> 00:15:14,960
work.

563
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,559
Do you see what I'm saying?

564
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,279
Let's say somebody has a massive

565
00:15:19,289 --> 00:15:22,330
business and they sign $150,000

566
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:23,179
clients.

567
00:15:23,179 --> 00:15:24,500
You can say, hey, man, it's going

568
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,049
to cost me like $2,000 a month to

569
00:15:26,049 --> 00:15:27,379
run these campaigns, and then it's

570
00:15:27,379 --> 00:15:28,779
going to be $400 per call.

571
00:15:28,779 --> 00:15:29,559
Is that okay with you?

572
00:15:29,559 --> 00:15:30,740
Oh, yeah, that's cool.

573
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:31,500
Where do I sign?

574
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:34,419
$300 a month to run the campaign,

575
00:15:34,419 --> 00:15:36,500
you pocket $1,700 because the

576
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,980
$2,000 minus the $300 to run the

577
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:41,330
campaign is $1,700, and you make a

578
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:42,399
lot of profit.

579
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:43,429
That is business.

580
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,659
This happens all the time in any

581
00:15:44,659 --> 00:15:45,200
industry.

582
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,049
If you go to the grocery store and

583
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:49,230
you buy a Red Bull for $2, Walmart

584
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:51,080
paid $1 to have the Red Bull in

585
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:51,850
their stock.

586
00:15:52,179 --> 00:15:53,659
Red Bull makes money.

587
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:54,519
Walmart makes money.

588
00:15:54,519 --> 00:15:55,870
You have a product in your hands

589
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:57,330
that makes you happier because it

590
00:15:57,330 --> 00:15:58,279
gives you energy.

591
00:15:58,759 --> 00:16:01,840
Same thing here, arbitrage.

592
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,860
You pay $300 in tech costs to run

593
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:04,779
the campaign.

594
00:16:04,779 --> 00:16:06,549
The client pays you $1,000 or $500

595
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:08,240
or $2,000, it doesn't matter.

596
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,090
You pocket the difference before

597
00:16:10,149 --> 00:16:12,080
you even get into the pay-per-call

598
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,019
situation.

599
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:16,250
Now, I hope you're still watching

600
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:19,259
because I want to dive into set up

601
00:16:19,259 --> 00:16:20,919
fees, right?

602
00:16:24,039 --> 00:16:29,860
You want to cover your own ass up

603
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:35,669
front before campaigns even

604
00:16:35,669 --> 00:16:37,919
launch.

605
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:41,019
You'll see in later videos.

606
00:16:41,019 --> 00:16:42,519
Okay, I should have explained the

607
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:43,860
set up fees a little bit earlier

608
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:45,200
in the video here, but hopefully

609
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:45,960
you're still watching.

610
00:16:47,389 --> 00:16:49,840
There is a fixed cost required to

611
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:57,860
set up a cold email system, right?

612
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:00,679
You need to buy domains like .com

613
00:17:00,679 --> 00:17:02,820
addresses on behalf of the

614
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,500
business owner.

615
00:17:04,539 --> 00:17:06,279
I'll explain why in later videos.

616
00:17:07,078 --> 00:17:09,289
You need to buy email inboxes that

617
00:17:09,289 --> 00:17:11,490
are on each domain like Christian

618
00:17:11,539 --> 00:17:14,338
at apple.com, Suzy at apple.com,

619
00:17:14,369 --> 00:17:15,059
right?

620
00:17:15,059 --> 00:17:15,940
That's an email inbox.

621
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:17,200
They cost money through Google or

622
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:17,680
Outlook.

623
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,980
You also need to buy leads, a list

624
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:22,460
of email contacts to reach out to,

625
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:24,088
and you need to buy a sending

626
00:17:24,088 --> 00:17:26,180
software to automate this entire

627
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:27,700
process because you're not going

628
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:28,980
to be sending emails by hand.

629
00:17:29,099 --> 00:17:30,420
You're not going to be sending one

630
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:31,539
by one, um, that would take

631
00:17:31,539 --> 00:17:32,819
literally all day and it would be

632
00:17:32,819 --> 00:17:33,980
a waste of your time.

633
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:34,900
There's a software that does it

634
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:35,539
automatically.

635
00:17:35,539 --> 00:17:37,170
Um, so you have to buy these

636
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:39,240
things before you even get started

637
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,160
with a client's campaign and you

638
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:42,180
have to invest.

639
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:46,680
You are investing into your own

640
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:50,569
labor or a virtual assistance

641
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:52,980
labor, right?

642
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,829
Not only do you have hard costs,

643
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:56,819
you have either your own time that

644
00:17:56,819 --> 00:17:58,559
you're investing or a virtual

645
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:00,380
assistance time who you have to

646
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:02,190
pay for their labor, right?

647
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:05,750
So you want to charge some form of

648
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:09,029
an upfront setup fee, you know,

649
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:15,089
$1,000, $1,500, 2K, right?

650
00:18:15,339 --> 00:18:17,299
We used to charge, I think, 1,500

651
00:18:17,299 --> 00:18:18,710
bucks as a setup cost and then pay

652
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:19,339
per call.

653
00:18:19,339 --> 00:18:20,369
So you go, hey, Mr.

654
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:22,450
Client, I'm going to need 1,500

655
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:23,750
bucks up front to build this

656
00:18:23,799 --> 00:18:25,019
entire system out.

657
00:18:25,019 --> 00:18:26,829
This is going to be invested into

658
00:18:26,829 --> 00:18:28,829
hard costs, um, for the domains,

659
00:18:28,829 --> 00:18:30,500
the inboxes, the leads, the

660
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,359
sending tool, my own messaging,

661
00:18:32,359 --> 00:18:34,369
and copywriting abilities and my

662
00:18:34,369 --> 00:18:36,640
labor and my team's labor, right?

663
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,160
You own the system, you know,

664
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,799
we're building it out for you.

665
00:18:39,799 --> 00:18:40,849
We're basically building you an

666
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:41,869
asset that your business has

667
00:18:41,869 --> 00:18:42,359
forever.

668
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:43,660
You're just going to have to pay

669
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:44,960
me some kind of upfront capital

670
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,529
to, you know, deploy into this

671
00:18:46,529 --> 00:18:48,440
actual system being built, right?

672
00:18:48,519 --> 00:18:51,160
Do you need to charge a setup fee?

673
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:53,220
No, but ideally you cover your own

674
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:55,200
ass and pay for the technology out

675
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,539
of their pocket, not your pocket.

676
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,700
And then you go ahead and charge a

677
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,509
pay per call model or a tech fee

678
00:19:01,509 --> 00:19:03,549
plus pay per call model or a tech

679
00:19:03,549 --> 00:19:05,609
fee plus pay per call plus rev

680
00:19:05,609 --> 00:19:06,799
share model.

681
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:08,240
Once again, there are no rules

682
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:08,650
here.

683
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:10,220
Um, these are just a bunch of

684
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:12,049
different ways to frame, um, or

685
00:19:12,049 --> 00:19:13,839
charge, you know, for the offer

686
00:19:13,859 --> 00:19:15,279
that you're selling.

687
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,880
Hey, we can get you 10 calls a

688
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,259
month on a pay per call basis.

689
00:19:18,259 --> 00:19:19,859
You only pay us 300 bucks a call.

690
00:19:20,339 --> 00:19:21,980
Hopefully this is in depth enough.

691
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:23,250
I think I explained this very well

692
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:24,539
and very, um, thoroughly.

693
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:26,599
So, you know, how to, how to, you

694
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:28,380
know, structure your offer so that

695
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:29,910
it's an easy no brainer for your

696
00:19:30,009 --> 00:19:31,750
client and an easy no brainer for

697
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,190
you to get them to, to sign on

698
00:19:33,289 --> 00:19:34,220
with you and get to work.

699
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:36,430
So hopefully this helped see y'all

700
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:38,089
on the next video in the next

701
00:19:38,089 --> 00:19:38,730
video.

702
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:40,390
I'm going to basically be going

703
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:42,250
over, um, how to actually write a

704
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:44,079
good email, a good cold email,

705
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:46,039
because number one cold email is

706
00:19:46,039 --> 00:19:48,069
how you're probably going to sign

707
00:19:48,069 --> 00:19:50,119
your first couple of clients.

708
00:19:50,119 --> 00:19:52,099
And two, the entire service that

709
00:19:52,099 --> 00:19:54,099
you're selling is cold email.

710
00:19:54,099 --> 00:19:55,299
So it's in your best interest to

711
00:19:55,309 --> 00:19:56,670
become very, very good at writing

712
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:57,930
cold email so you can get results

713
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:58,819
for your clients.

714
00:19:58,819 --> 00:20:00,109
I want to teach you everything

715
00:20:00,109 --> 00:20:01,490
that I know based on four years of

716
00:20:01,509 --> 00:20:03,019
experience writing cold emails in

717
00:20:03,019 --> 00:20:03,960
this next video.

718
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,380
So please pay attention to the

719
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,970
next video because it's probably

720
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:08,509
the most important one that you're

721
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:10,200
ever going to watch in this, um,

722
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,599
course in this program.

723
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:12,440
So thanks for watching.

724
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,900
Let's dive into the copywriting

725
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,079
section of cold email.

726
00:20:15,079 --> 00:20:15,539
See you there.
