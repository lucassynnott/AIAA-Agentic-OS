1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:01,780
- What's up guys, Lucas here.

2
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:03,560
I'm gonna be showing you in this

3
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:03,919
video

4
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:04,679
what I think is one of our

5
00:00:04,679 --> 00:00:06,320
probably handiest automations

6
00:00:06,419 --> 00:00:08,400
so far, it's our Booked Meeting

7
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:08,720
Alert

8
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:10,839
and Prospect Research workflow.

9
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:11,699
So there's a few things we're

10
00:00:11,699 --> 00:00:12,119
gonna have to set up

11
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:13,189
ahead of this, I'm gonna go over

12
00:00:13,189 --> 00:00:13,240
these

13
00:00:13,419 --> 00:00:15,789
by order of kind of complexity of

14
00:00:15,789 --> 00:00:17,120
setting it up.

15
00:00:17,219 --> 00:00:18,750
So first of all, you'll just need

16
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:19,640
a Google Drive folder

17
00:00:19,739 --> 00:00:21,210
named Prospect Research, that's a

18
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:21,960
pretty easy one.

19
00:00:22,059 --> 00:00:23,199
Just go to your Google Drive,

20
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:23,800
create a folder,

21
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:26,199
name it Prospect Research, done.

22
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,359
Next thing, this uses Explorium,

23
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:29,570
which is something we use in a

24
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:30,519
previous automation

25
00:00:30,589 --> 00:00:31,879
as well, one of our other research

26
00:00:31,879 --> 00:00:32,439
automations.

27
00:00:32,539 --> 00:00:34,600
So you wanna sign up on Explorium

28
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,770
and then you wanna get your API

29
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:37,320
key.

30
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:38,700
Now where you're gonna input this

31
00:00:38,909 --> 00:00:40,479
is if we go back here

32
00:00:40,579 --> 00:00:41,869
and where we see Explorium Match

33
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:42,799
Prospects,

34
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:44,659
we double click this, this will

35
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:45,600
all be set up like this,

36
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:47,479
but you will need to create a new

37
00:00:47,509 --> 00:00:48,240
header auth.

38
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:49,619
And to do that, you will just

39
00:00:50,119 --> 00:00:51,759
click create new credential

40
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:53,560
and you will just type name

41
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:56,229
authorization with a capital A

42
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:57,619
and then you're just going to copy

43
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,759
and paste your API key

44
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:04,280
in like this and you are done.

45
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:07,200
That will use your Explorium API.

46
00:01:07,299 --> 00:01:09,120
The next thing is gonna be

47
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,159
Calendly.

48
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:11,200
Calendly seems like it should be

49
00:01:11,209 --> 00:01:11,849
very easy to set up.

50
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:13,840
Surprisingly, it's a little bit

51
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:14,560
awkward.

52
00:01:14,629 --> 00:01:15,439
So I'm gonna show you what it

53
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:15,680
looks like

54
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:17,060
to create a new credential in

55
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:17,849
Calendly.

56
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:20,200
We're gonna be using OAuth 2 and

57
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,120
if you have set up

58
00:01:21,219 --> 00:01:22,840
the Google Drive OAuth for the

59
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:23,959
Google Sheets,

60
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:24,829
then you know kind of what this

61
00:01:24,829 --> 00:01:25,159
looks like,

62
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:26,760
but it's not super hard.

63
00:01:26,829 --> 00:01:27,640
But first we're gonna go to our

64
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,140
Calendly account

65
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:29,700
and we're gonna go to integrations

66
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:30,640
and apps.

67
00:01:30,739 --> 00:01:31,959
When you're here, you're going to

68
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:32,760
either scroll down

69
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:35,280
to API and webhooks or just search

70
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,079
API here

71
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,000
and you're gonna click on it.

72
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,159
Then we are going to go to OAuth.

73
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:41,540
We're gonna click get started

74
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:42,000
here.

75
00:01:42,099 --> 00:01:43,000
This is gonna bring you to the

76
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,040
Calendly developer page.

77
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:46,310
You're gonna have to create a

78
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:47,790
Calendly developer account.

79
00:01:47,859 --> 00:01:48,760
So again, you're gonna want to go

80
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,969
to developer.calendly.com

81
00:01:50,069 --> 00:01:51,370
or you're going to want to click

82
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:52,000
that link

83
00:01:52,099 --> 00:01:53,519
we see here under OAuth.

84
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:55,000
And then once you've signed in,

85
00:01:55,099 --> 00:01:56,379
sign in with Google makes it super

86
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:57,099
easy.

87
00:01:57,549 --> 00:02:00,480
Just go to account and my apps.

88
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:02,560
Then you're gonna create a new

89
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:02,840
app.

90
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:04,689
Making this very simple, just type

91
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,620
in N8N or whatever,

92
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:09,639
kind of app web, environment type,

93
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:11,020
I chose production.

94
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,599
And then you will copy your OAuth

95
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,020
redirect URL from here.

96
00:02:15,139 --> 00:02:17,789
And you will paste it in here,

97
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,800
save and continue.

98
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:19,680
And then it gives you all the

99
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:20,400
details you need.

100
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,319
So you just copy the client ID and

101
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:23,719
paste it in here.

102
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:25,099
And then you copy the client

103
00:02:25,629 --> 00:02:28,280
secret, paste it in here

104
00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:31,800
on the Calendly page here.

105
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:34,289
And then connect my account and

106
00:02:34,289 --> 00:02:35,840
log in and you're good to go.

107
00:02:35,939 --> 00:02:36,960
Very, very simple, very

108
00:02:36,979 --> 00:02:37,800
straightforward,

109
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,719
but it is slightly more awkward

110
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:40,280
than just, you know,

111
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:41,060
clicking a connect button or

112
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:41,659
something like that.

113
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:42,789
So just make sure to do that.

114
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,530
So again, your process there, you

115
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:46,960
are going to go to integrations,

116
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:48,960
APIs and webhooks, click OAuth,

117
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,439
get started here.

118
00:02:50,539 --> 00:02:51,810
Then you will sign up for a

119
00:02:52,349 --> 00:02:52,960
developer account

120
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:54,030
or just log into the developer

121
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:54,919
account with Google.

122
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,259
Then you will go to account, my

123
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:57,669
apps, new app.

124
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,000
And just fill in the details that

125
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,840
we showed you there a moment ago.

126
00:03:01,939 --> 00:03:03,189
After that, you are pretty much

127
00:03:03,189 --> 00:03:03,560
done.

128
00:03:03,659 --> 00:03:06,469
We have some other basic set up

129
00:03:06,469 --> 00:03:08,150
here that we will have seen in

130
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:08,879
other ones.

131
00:03:08,949 --> 00:03:09,599
Go high level.

132
00:03:09,699 --> 00:03:10,979
Again, refer to the video I did

133
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:12,000
breaking down how to connect,

134
00:03:12,069 --> 00:03:13,360
go high level to N8N to get that

135
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,879
set up as it is a bit complicated.

136
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:18,560
Then we have, what else?

137
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:21,280
Open router for our AI agent,

138
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,879
perplexity for our research.

139
00:03:22,979 --> 00:03:24,610
Perplexity again is an API key.

140
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:25,120
Very simple.

141
00:03:25,219 --> 00:03:26,340
Just go to perplexity.com, get

142
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:26,879
your API key.

143
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:29,780
MD2 Docs, you will need your

144
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,840
Google Docs account, OAuth 2 API,

145
00:03:31,939 --> 00:03:34,610
and your Google Drive account,

146
00:03:34,699 --> 00:03:35,840
just connect it up.

147
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:38,169
Gmail account, connect it up, and

148
00:03:38,169 --> 00:03:40,069
your Slack as usual.

149
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:42,430
So let's run through what this

150
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,080
does.

151
00:03:43,259 --> 00:03:45,289
This listens for new Calendly

152
00:03:45,349 --> 00:03:46,120
events.

153
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:47,539
So when someone books a meeting

154
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,569
with you on Calendly or with one

155
00:03:49,569 --> 00:03:51,199
of your clients on Calendly,

156
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:53,969
what this does is it searches

157
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:56,280
through our Go High Level to see

158
00:03:56,349 --> 00:03:58,000
if they're an existing lead.

159
00:03:58,099 --> 00:04:01,659
If they are a new lead, then we

160
00:04:01,659 --> 00:04:04,000
will get that lead.

161
00:04:04,099 --> 00:04:06,770
We will just search through the

162
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:10,050
CRM, and we'll update their status

163
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,969
to meeting booked.

164
00:04:12,099 --> 00:04:13,030
That's essentially all that does.

165
00:04:13,139 --> 00:04:15,060
If they're not a new lead, then it

166
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:18,069
will create a contact in our Go

167
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:19,089
High Level CRM,

168
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,850
create an opportunity in the CRM.

169
00:04:20,949 --> 00:04:21,839
And then finally, we get to the

170
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:22,560
important part here,

171
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:23,899
which is actually getting

172
00:04:23,899 --> 00:04:25,759
information about the prospect.

173
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,720
The Explorium basically searches

174
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,879
through for information about the

175
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:29,279
prospect

176
00:04:29,379 --> 00:04:30,399
and matches the email address,

177
00:04:30,449 --> 00:04:31,839
things like that, to its database.

178
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,279
Then we will extract the prospect

179
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:36,160
IDs for the match results,

180
00:04:36,259 --> 00:04:37,699
and we will enrich the contact's

181
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:38,560
information.

182
00:04:38,629 --> 00:04:39,889
So we get extra information about

183
00:04:39,889 --> 00:04:41,319
the client, including other email

184
00:04:41,329 --> 00:04:42,319
addresses.

185
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:43,860
And then we enrich the profiles by

186
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,089
getting things like their

187
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:45,759
LinkedIn,

188
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,139
their previous experience, their

189
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:48,529
company they work for, all this

190
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:49,439
sort of information here.

191
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,519
Then we merge that together.

192
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:53,920
And this is just handling some of

193
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,750
the processing in relation to

194
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:58,459
how we're formatting the data we

195
00:04:58,459 --> 00:05:00,350
got from Explorium.

196
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,569
And then we put it all together

197
00:05:02,569 --> 00:05:03,680
here into a bio.

198
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:06,029
I've pinned some data, which is

199
00:05:06,029 --> 00:05:07,199
why they're showing red right now.

200
00:05:07,379 --> 00:05:09,620
But as you can see here, now we've

201
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:10,800
got the name, the city, the

202
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:12,160
country, the position,

203
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:14,209
about the current company, their

204
00:05:14,209 --> 00:05:15,589
previous experience in JSON

205
00:05:15,589 --> 00:05:16,079
format,

206
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,459
their LinkedIn URL, and their

207
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:18,560
education details.

208
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,329
Then we send it to our AI agent.

209
00:05:21,459 --> 00:05:23,449
And what this agent does is we

210
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:25,360
tell it it's an agent specializing

211
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:25,680
in generating

212
00:05:25,779 --> 00:05:27,019
meeting preparation documents for

213
00:05:27,019 --> 00:05:28,000
business professionals.

214
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,379
We always provide the data,

215
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:30,639
specifically LinkedIn profiles,

216
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:31,720
and synthesize it into actual

217
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,240
insights.

218
00:05:32,339 --> 00:05:33,620
Generate a conference of meeting

219
00:05:34,149 --> 00:05:34,879
preparation documents.

220
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:35,720
You receive a JSON object

221
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,879
containing LinkedIn profile.

222
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:38,240
Then we have all this information

223
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,279
we gave it there, including the

224
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:40,639
LinkedIn profile URL.

225
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,839
We also just have just a system

226
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:44,560
message here telling it,

227
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:45,839
you know, so how it should kind of

228
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:46,560
create the report

229
00:05:46,629 --> 00:05:47,430
and what it should include and

230
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:47,939
things like that.

231
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:50,649
So then it uses perplexity as well

232
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:52,319
to do a bit of extra research.

233
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:54,399
And finally, we take the output

234
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:58,069
and we create a HTML version of it

235
00:05:58,180 --> 00:05:59,459
that we then send via email.

236
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:00,560
Now you can either send this to

237
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,000
your client or to yourself.

238
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,230
It's probably a pretty good idea

239
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:05,279
to have this sent to your clients.

240
00:06:05,379 --> 00:06:06,240
They can see, you know, meetings

241
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,329
coming in constantly and things

242
00:06:07,329 --> 00:06:07,680
like that.

243
00:06:07,779 --> 00:06:10,449
And what the emails look like are

244
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:11,199
this.

245
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,860
So I hadn't set it up, but it

246
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,279
actually will have the client's,

247
00:06:15,379 --> 00:06:16,660
the prospect's name and booking

248
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:17,680
date there.

249
00:06:17,779 --> 00:06:19,060
And then it has a full breakdown

250
00:06:19,589 --> 00:06:22,959
of the prospect and all a ton of

251
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:23,519
extra information.

252
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:25,209
That will help someone that's

253
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:26,240
meant to get a sales call

254
00:06:26,339 --> 00:06:27,339
with this person repair ahead of

255
00:06:27,339 --> 00:06:27,970
the sales call.

256
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,910
Then we do basically the same

257
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:31,680
thing, but we create a Google doc

258
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,040
of the information,

259
00:06:33,139 --> 00:06:34,420
which I'm going to show you what

260
00:06:34,699 --> 00:06:35,680
that looks like here.

261
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:39,730
Same information that email, just

262
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:41,360
a nicely formatted Google doc.

263
00:06:41,459 --> 00:06:42,480
That gives us all the information

264
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,839
and kind of that we need to know

265
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:44,800
about the client ahead of time.

266
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:47,839
And then we move that to our

267
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:50,240
prospect research folder.

268
00:06:51,139 --> 00:06:52,290
And then we send a nicely

269
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:54,160
formatted Slack message saying,

270
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,519
Hey, new call booked.

271
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,250
And here's the call date, the call

272
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:58,769
title, the prospect notes, the

273
00:06:58,769 --> 00:06:59,040
name,

274
00:06:59,139 --> 00:07:00,769
the company, the email address,

275
00:07:00,949 --> 00:07:02,319
and the research document.

276
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:03,699
So basically every time someone

277
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:05,439
books a call with your client,

278
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:06,399
they'll get a detailed,

279
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,279
their, their, their, their, their

280
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:08,910
CRM will be updated and they will

281
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:11,199
get a detailed research document,

282
00:07:11,269 --> 00:07:12,470
as well as notification that the

283
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:13,819
calls and booked the time, things

284
00:07:13,819 --> 00:07:14,220
like that.

285
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:15,930
This is a lot of extra, more extra

286
00:07:16,149 --> 00:07:17,439
information than just, you know,

287
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:18,000
call booked.

288
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,110
Here's a, you know, a quick

289
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:19,920
notification.

290
00:07:20,019 --> 00:07:21,300
Uh, this gives us actual detailed

291
00:07:21,829 --> 00:07:23,160
information on the prospect and

292
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,389
really helps prepare ahead of the

293
00:07:24,389 --> 00:07:24,879
sales call.

294
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:26,980
So is extremely valuable and it's

295
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,970
kind of going that extra mile for

296
00:07:29,009 --> 00:07:30,240
your lead gen clients,

297
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:31,079
you know, to show that you're

298
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:32,079
actually preparing documents for

299
00:07:32,149 --> 00:07:33,439
them ahead of the call in order

300
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:34,449
for them to be as prepared as

301
00:07:34,449 --> 00:07:34,829
possible.

302
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,540
So that's essentially how it

303
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:37,050
works.

304
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:38,620
Any issues, feel free to hit me

305
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:39,870
up, but I think this is actually a

306
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:40,639
super useful one.

307
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:41,759
Again, make sure that once you've

308
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:43,259
got all this set up, you set it to

309
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:43,680
active.

310
00:07:43,779 --> 00:07:45,790
So that anytime a new, um, meeting

311
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:47,360
is booked in Calendly, this whole,

312
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,269
uh, flow will run.

313
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:49,699
Hope this was helpful and I will

314
00:07:49,899 --> 00:07:51,279
see you in the next one.

315
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:52,079
Peace.
