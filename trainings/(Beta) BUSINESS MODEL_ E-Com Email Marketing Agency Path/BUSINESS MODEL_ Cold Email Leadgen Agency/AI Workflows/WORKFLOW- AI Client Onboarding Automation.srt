1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,060
What's up guys, Lucas here.

2
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:02,549
So today I'm going to be going

3
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,080
over the AI client onboarding

4
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:04,490
agent.

5
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:05,320
This is going to be useful

6
00:00:05,349 --> 00:00:06,509
regardless of what type of agency

7
00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:06,960
you run.

8
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,050
Essentially what it's

9
00:00:08,279 --> 00:00:09,119
going to allow you to do is input

10
00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:10,519
the client details, get their

11
00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:12,400
information, turn it into

12
00:00:12,689 --> 00:00:14,189
tasks inside of your Go High Level

13
00:00:14,189 --> 00:00:15,910
and add your client to Slack along

14
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:17,219
with a welcome email.

15
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:18,649
So as usual, let's break down what

16
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,000
you're going to need to have set

17
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,260
up for this and

18
00:00:21,489 --> 00:00:22,620
what each node does.

19
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:24,469
So first of all, you're going to

20
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,820
have to have Go High Level set up.

21
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:28,640
You're going to want to watch the

22
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,140
video I break down in the N8N

23
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:31,100
course where I tell you

24
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,259
exactly how to sort of Go High

25
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:33,280
Level as it is a little bit

26
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,659
complicated to connect Go High

27
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:35,479
Level to N8N.

28
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:36,770
So you're going to make sure

29
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:37,570
that's done.

30
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:39,979
You want your Google Drive set up.

31
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:41,039
As mentioned in other previous

32
00:00:41,109 --> 00:00:42,500
videos, if you're self-hosting,

33
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,899
you'll use the Google OAuth

34
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:45,539
method, which I break down in

35
00:00:45,549 --> 00:00:46,539
another video.

36
00:00:46,539 --> 00:00:48,390
And if you are using N8N Cloud,

37
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:49,159
you will simply

38
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:50,539
just log in with Google.

39
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:52,229
Then you will need Open Router,

40
00:00:52,229 --> 00:00:53,979
your Open Router API key for all

41
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:55,170
of our AI agents, as we've talked

42
00:00:55,579 --> 00:00:56,619
about in other videos.

43
00:00:56,619 --> 00:00:58,060
And you also have Slack set up

44
00:00:58,390 --> 00:00:59,159
and Gmail.

45
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:01,320
So the way this works is it's a

46
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,619
simple form input.

47
00:01:02,619 --> 00:01:03,899
This is your client onboarding

48
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:04,900
form.

49
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,010
Now you just put in the client

50
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:07,340
name, the client's email, their

51
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:08,230
company name, their

52
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:08,859
website.

53
00:01:08,859 --> 00:01:10,599
And then you have a choice of

54
00:01:10,599 --> 00:01:12,769
either uploading a PDF proposal or

55
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:13,799
a scope document

56
00:01:13,969 --> 00:01:14,859
that you may have created for what

57
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:16,069
you're going to do for the client

58
00:01:16,069 --> 00:01:17,400
or just filling out here,

59
00:01:17,629 --> 00:01:18,890
client information and tasks.

60
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,579
So this is going to be input very

61
00:01:20,579 --> 00:01:21,579
briefly, just, you know,

62
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:23,780
I'm going to do this, this, this,

63
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:24,579
and this.

64
00:01:24,579 --> 00:01:26,010
Then once that's submitted, it

65
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:26,640
will check to

66
00:01:26,819 --> 00:01:28,019
see if we have uploaded a PDF

67
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:28,700
proposal.

68
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:29,680
We'll get the information from

69
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,040
there.

70
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:30,719
If not, we'll

71
00:01:30,859 --> 00:01:32,609
go directly to creating the main

72
00:01:32,609 --> 00:01:34,239
client folder inside of your

73
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:36,129
client's folder in Google Drive.

74
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:37,200
So as mentioned before, you always

75
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,280
need to have a client's folder in

76
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:38,959
Google Drive.

77
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:39,200
That's

78
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:40,260
the way a lot of these workflows

79
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:40,879
are set up.

80
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:42,579
We look for the client's folder in

81
00:01:42,579 --> 00:01:42,739
there.

82
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:44,450
Then we're just going to rename

83
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:45,379
the folder ID.

84
00:01:45,379 --> 00:01:47,079
This is just taking the ID of the

85
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:47,560
folder

86
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:49,760
and naming a drive folder ID.

87
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,760
Then we're going to create the

88
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,780
contact in your go high level

89
00:01:53,019 --> 00:01:53,780
CRM.

90
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,599
And then if this is again, it's

91
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:57,549
checking if we have uploaded a PDF

92
00:01:57,569 --> 00:01:58,680
or not, or if it's

93
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,810
just coming directly from what

94
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:02,609
your input here and client

95
00:02:02,609 --> 00:02:04,739
information and tasks here, I'll

96
00:02:04,739 --> 00:02:04,859
put

97
00:02:05,049 --> 00:02:05,920
some basic information using

98
00:02:05,989 --> 00:02:07,310
myself as an example, just said

99
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:09,379
paid 50% of $10,000 starting fee,

100
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:10,430
creating new website and BSR for

101
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:11,590
them, setting up funnel for them,

102
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:12,590
setting up Google Analytics

103
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,460
for them, need to get Google

104
00:02:13,509 --> 00:02:14,479
account login details, need to

105
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:15,469
write copy documents based

106
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:17,300
on their current products.

107
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,250
Then this will check, see if we've

108
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:20,439
uploaded CSV.

109
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:21,060
If we haven't, it'll

110
00:02:21,289 --> 00:02:22,120
run this agent.

111
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,270
And if we have, it'll run this

112
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,120
agent.

113
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,599
Essentially it's the same agent.

114
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:26,599
All

115
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:27,659
it's going to do is going to

116
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,129
create a number of tasks based on

117
00:02:29,129 --> 00:02:30,560
the provided information.

118
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:31,620
So you can see, create a client

119
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:33,139
payment schedule, request Google

120
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,379
account access, create website

121
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:35,990
project brief, product analysis

122
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:37,419
review, BSL script outline,

123
00:02:37,419 --> 00:02:38,870
initial copy framework, website

124
00:02:38,979 --> 00:02:39,439
wireframe design.

125
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:40,120
It's going to break down all the

126
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:41,099
things you're going to have to do

127
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:42,539
for them.

128
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:44,139
Then we're going to split this out

129
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:45,490
and we're going to send it to a

130
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:46,379
loop agent.

131
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:46,620
What this

132
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,300
does is going to, or a loop tool.

133
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,699
This loop tool is going to create

134
00:02:49,699 --> 00:02:50,439
all of those things

135
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:51,379
we see listed here.

136
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:53,460
All of these 26 or so tasks here.

137
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:55,139
It is going to create them inside

138
00:02:55,139 --> 00:02:55,500
go high

139
00:02:55,729 --> 00:02:55,919
level.

140
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:57,240
Only we can see these in go high

141
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,710
level is for our internal project

142
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,919
management for each

143
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:00,409
client.

144
00:03:00,409 --> 00:03:01,789
And it'll also be for your team

145
00:03:01,789 --> 00:03:03,129
that are in go high level so that

146
00:03:03,259 --> 00:03:04,430
you can keep track of

147
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,189
what needs to be done for each

148
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:05,500
client.

149
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:06,840
So we'll create the tasks in

150
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:07,379
there.

151
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:08,500
You can see it's

152
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,400
created a 25 of them in total.

153
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,490
Um, and then when it's done, we're

154
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:14,330
just going to send it to

155
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:14,740
aggregate,

156
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:15,919
just so we don't get a bunch of,

157
00:03:15,949 --> 00:03:17,080
uh, items going to our Slack

158
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:17,949
create channel.

159
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:19,120
It sends one item,

160
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:20,819
and we're just going to create the

161
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:22,349
channel with the client name.

162
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:23,699
So we just do the client name,

163
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,009
and then this is set to name it

164
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,819
client name, underscore channel.

165
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:28,340
So you can see there innovative,

166
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:29,900
underscore channel, uh, based on

167
00:03:29,939 --> 00:03:31,550
the company, uh, uh, named they've

168
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,099
input.

169
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:33,939
And then we post a message

170
00:03:33,979 --> 00:03:34,680
to that channel.

171
00:03:34,689 --> 00:03:36,169
Just saying big, welcome to name.

172
00:03:36,169 --> 00:03:37,150
We're excited to copy this

173
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:37,780
project.

174
00:03:37,819 --> 00:03:38,800
The channel serves our central

175
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,900
place for communication updates

176
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:40,500
during the storyline

177
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:41,330
throughout the journey.

178
00:03:41,379 --> 00:03:42,520
Next up checklist, give off calls,

179
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,050
next steps.

180
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:43,780
We've got you covered.

181
00:03:43,819 --> 00:03:44,319
Let's crush it.

182
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:45,300
You can obviously change this to

183
00:03:45,379 --> 00:03:46,020
whatever you want.

184
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,460
Um, the only thing they have

185
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:49,180
there is the name is the only

186
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,990
variable we have in there.

187
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:52,810
Uh, so then we are going to send

188
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:53,060
them a

189
00:03:53,289 --> 00:03:53,639
welcome email.

190
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:54,659
Again, you're going to want to

191
00:03:54,669 --> 00:03:55,139
edit this.

192
00:03:55,139 --> 00:03:56,180
So, uh, obviously connect your

193
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:56,580
Gmail

194
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:57,110
account.

195
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:58,469
This would go to the, the, the

196
00:03:58,469 --> 00:03:59,780
email address you put in on the

197
00:03:59,789 --> 00:04:01,060
onboarding form.

198
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,389
Welcome to agency name.

199
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:04,030
Obviously put your name in there

200
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:05,379
and then it has their name.

201
00:04:05,379 --> 00:04:06,340
So welcome to

202
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,400
innovative Lucas and your

203
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:08,659
onboarding is complete.

204
00:04:08,659 --> 00:04:10,400
And then this message here, you'll

205
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:10,819
want to modify

206
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:11,879
this a little bit too.

207
00:04:12,009 --> 00:04:12,389
Hi name.

208
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:13,270
Welcome aboard.

209
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:14,900
Uh, your project works is live.

210
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:15,379
Uh, you should,

211
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:16,600
you should receive the most of the

212
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:17,930
following slack, Google drive,

213
00:04:17,939 --> 00:04:19,060
next steps about any relevant

214
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,240
documentation here, Google drive

215
00:04:20,629 --> 00:04:20,759
folder.

216
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:21,889
And then you've got their Google

217
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:24,399
drive folder linked space there.

218
00:04:24,459 --> 00:04:25,759
Uh, schedule your onboarding call.

219
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,060
You're going to replace this with

220
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,100
your calendar link.

221
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:28,889
Obviously

222
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:29,959
join the Slack channel.

223
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:31,540
You're going to want to replace

224
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:32,980
this URL with your Slack URL.

225
00:04:33,089 --> 00:04:34,100
Uh,

226
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:35,529
this should work perfectly though.

227
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:36,600
This should be the channel ID

228
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,300
should be in there.

229
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,000
And then obviously put in your

230
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,939
name, uh, name, your agency and

231
00:04:40,949 --> 00:04:42,980
your title and your website.

232
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:44,399
And that will send the email to

233
00:04:44,579 --> 00:04:44,819
them.

234
00:04:44,819 --> 00:04:46,740
So that's basically how it works.

235
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:47,449
Uh, again,

236
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,800
it's a form submission, uh, form

237
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:49,569
looks like this.

238
00:04:49,569 --> 00:04:50,980
You put in their name, email,

239
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:51,939
company, website,

240
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,589
and then to either, either a PDF

241
00:04:53,589 --> 00:04:55,149
or a description of the tasks and

242
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:57,019
information about the client.

243
00:04:57,259 --> 00:04:58,699
And then this will roll run and

244
00:04:58,709 --> 00:05:00,019
we'll, uh, basically create a

245
00:05:00,019 --> 00:05:00,980
folder in Google drive,

246
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:02,720
add them to go high level, create

247
00:05:02,779 --> 00:05:04,420
tasks for them, add those tasks

248
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:05,779
to, to go high level,

249
00:05:06,009 --> 00:05:07,079
create a Slack channel, send a

250
00:05:07,379 --> 00:05:08,480
message in that Slack channel and

251
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,699
send them a welcome email.

252
00:05:09,939 --> 00:05:12,250
So, uh, I heard this part about

253
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,269
this program to be connected to

254
00:05:13,269 --> 00:05:13,589
the DHL.

255
00:05:13,589 --> 00:05:14,180
Check out that video in

256
00:05:14,379 --> 00:05:16,000
the N8N module and hope this is

257
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,759
helpful and I will see you in the

258
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:18,519
next one.

259
00:05:18,589 --> 00:05:19,220
Peace.

260
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:19,449
Thank you.
