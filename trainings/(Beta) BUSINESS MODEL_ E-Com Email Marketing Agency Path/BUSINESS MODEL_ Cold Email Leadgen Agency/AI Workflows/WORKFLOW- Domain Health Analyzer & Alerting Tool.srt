00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,370
What's up guys Lucas here so in

2
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:03,730
this one I'm gonna be showing you

3
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:04,500
guys the email

4
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:06,809
deliverability and reputation

5
00:00:06,809 --> 00:00:09,029
manager workflow so as you guys

6
00:00:09,029 --> 00:00:09,720
know if you're

7
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:11,640
going to be running both cold

8
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,710
email or also actually email for

9
00:00:13,789 --> 00:00:14,720
e-com brands

10
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:16,789
your domain reputation is very

11
00:00:16,969 --> 00:00:18,149
important you're gonna have to

12
00:00:18,179 --> 00:00:18,519
check to

13
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:20,019
make sure that your emails are

14
00:00:20,019 --> 00:00:21,679
going to spam you know it's a big

15
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:22,190
part of that

16
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:24,969
whole process so what we developed

17
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:27,019
here is a flow that runs on a

18
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:28,239
schedule that

19
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,699
will check your domains to ensure

20
00:00:30,699 --> 00:00:33,020
that they are still all good and

21
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:33,460
provide the

22
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,289
maximum deliverability for your

23
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:37,429
email accounts so as usual I'm

24
00:00:37,429 --> 00:00:38,679
gonna walk you

25
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:39,960
through the different nodes in

26
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:41,159
this flow I'm gonna explain

27
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:42,219
anything you'll need to

28
00:00:42,259 --> 00:00:44,429
edit or set and then kind of what

29
00:00:44,469 --> 00:00:46,579
it sort of looks like at the end

30
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:47,899
result now with

31
00:00:47,939 --> 00:00:49,179
this flow we're actually going to

32
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:50,409
be using for the first time what

33
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:50,829
we call

34
00:00:50,899 --> 00:00:53,049
variables and variables very

35
00:00:53,109 --> 00:00:55,219
simply are just a set of keys or

36
00:00:55,219 --> 00:00:56,799
information you can

37
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,579
create and reference in any of

38
00:00:58,579 --> 00:00:59,909
your flows they're very handy for

39
00:00:59,909 --> 00:01:00,759
things like API

40
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:01,799
keys so that's exactly what we're

41
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:05,099
using it for here so you will need

42
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:06,010
an account over

43
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:10,170
at MX Toolbox now this is

44
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,680
mxtoolbox.com if we go to the main

45
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,599
page here you can see

46
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,590
there's a ton of domain related

47
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:17,269
tools all you need to know is that

48
00:01:17,349 --> 00:01:18,099
when you get to

49
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:19,390
this site on the main site here

50
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:20,790
you're going to click your name

51
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:22,230
and click settings

52
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:25,010
then you're going to go over to

53
00:01:25,069 --> 00:01:27,769
API and get your API key once you

54
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:28,920
have that if you go back

55
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:30,629
to our flow here you're going to

56
00:01:30,629 --> 00:01:32,790
see variables here on the left

57
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:34,780
hand side now I open this in a new

58
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:36,819
tab and very simply it looks like

59
00:01:36,989 --> 00:01:39,200
this you're going to click add

60
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,069
variable and you're going to name

61
00:01:41,069 --> 00:01:44,680
it MX Toolbox API and paste your

62
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,900
API key in here now we've done

63
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:49,200
that as you can see and you can

64
00:01:49,219 --> 00:01:50,879
see here we've got copy to

65
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:51,459
clipboard virus dot mxtoolbox API

66
00:01:51,459 --> 00:01:51,609
and paste your API key in here now

67
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:51,780
we've done that as you can see and

68
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:51,939
you can see here we've got copy to

69
00:01:51,939 --> 00:01:52,219
clipboard virus dot mxtoolbox API

70
00:01:52,219 --> 00:01:52,219
and paste your API key in here now

71
00:01:52,219 --> 00:01:52,219
we've done that as you can see and

72
00:01:52,219 --> 00:01:52,219
you can see here we've got copy to

73
00:01:52,219 --> 00:01:52,219
clipboard virus dot mxtoolbox API

74
00:01:52,219 --> 00:01:52,219
and paste your API key in here.

75
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:55,010
mxtoolbox API so basically we can

76
00:01:55,069 --> 00:01:57,989
now reference that API key in our

77
00:01:57,989 --> 00:01:59,709
workflow this is so that you don't

78
00:01:59,709 --> 00:02:00,920
have to go through every node

79
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,780
separately and you know copy and

80
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:03,920
paste your API key the entire time

81
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,209
very simply all we do here is uh

82
00:02:07,349 --> 00:02:08,990
later on in the process we're

83
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:09,580
going to show you where to where

84
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:11,490
to put that uh how that's set up

85
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:12,610
so that it'll automatically pull

86
00:02:12,669 --> 00:02:14,639
in your API key but uh how does

87
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:16,360
this work so there's a few ways

88
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,840
that this can kind of be triggered

89
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,889
it'll be triggered by an email

90
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:22,219
provider event so maybe your email

91
00:02:22,219 --> 00:02:22,219
provider like smart lead or

92
00:02:22,219 --> 00:02:22,219
something

93
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,129
uh you know can notify you can

94
00:02:23,129 --> 00:02:23,810
notify you if a domain is

95
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:24,750
disconnected or if there's an

96
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:25,909
issue with it in which case you

97
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:28,780
can run this flow uh or by doing

98
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,520
it uh a forum trigger a manual

99
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:31,870
assessment and then we can run the

100
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:34,669
trigger on a continuous monitoring

101
00:02:34,669 --> 00:02:36,639
or weekly audit weekly audit is

102
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:37,680
probably the best in terms of

103
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,409
keeping your API costs down you

104
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:40,530
should not have to pay for

105
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:41,060
mxtoolbox if you're just doing a

106
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,240
weekly audit should be fine

107
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,530
so if we go over here we're going

108
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:44,939
to see how this works so let's see

109
00:02:44,939 --> 00:02:46,639
here from the form from the form

110
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:48,379
trigger i double click it at this

111
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:49,949
go to schema version

112
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,530
you can see the assessment type

113
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:53,240
we've chosen is a pre-campaign

114
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,819
validation this is essentially

115
00:02:54,819 --> 00:02:56,030
you're running this before you

116
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:57,460
have started sending out your

117
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:58,259
email campaigns

118
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,979
you put in your domain name uh

119
00:02:59,979 --> 00:03:02,270
your ip address uh the email

120
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,939
service provider uh the campaign

121
00:03:04,939 --> 00:03:05,449
volume

122
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,000
the urgency level of checking this

123
00:03:07,009 --> 00:03:08,319
as if for instance if there is a

124
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:09,750
performance issue or we're just

125
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:10,300
checking

126
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:12,009
beforehand uh add additional notes

127
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:13,580
this is for your own records that

128
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:15,409
we're going to save all of this in

129
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:17,430
air table so that runs and that's

130
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,250
we did a manual assessment so

131
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:21,379
we've got the manual assessment

132
00:03:21,379 --> 00:03:22,060
data here

133
00:03:22,099 --> 00:03:23,629
just get set it's the same stuff

134
00:03:23,689 --> 00:03:25,590
that we had over here before then

135
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:28,139
what this does is it goes to the

136
00:03:28,139 --> 00:03:28,780
mxtoolbox

137
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,729
blacklist check this checks if it

138
00:03:30,729 --> 00:03:32,620
has been blacklisted then the spf

139
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:34,819
record check dkim record check and

140
00:03:34,819 --> 00:03:36,060
the dmark policy check

141
00:03:36,099 --> 00:03:37,180
basically all the things you want

142
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,270
to check to make sure your domains

143
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:40,180
deliverability is at the peak that

144
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:40,229
it

145
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,830
should be so let's take a look in

146
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:43,560
here we're going to see how we set

147
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,340
that api key we've already got all

148
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:45,740
the information

149
00:03:45,819 --> 00:03:47,819
you need in here that's all set up

150
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:49,710
and good to go but if you go down

151
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:51,250
here you're going to see the

152
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:53,439
authorization and this is our

153
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,520
variable that we got from here

154
00:03:55,659 --> 00:03:57,439
right so if you name this mx

155
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:58,629
toolbox api

156
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,469
that and put your your api key in

157
00:04:00,509 --> 00:04:01,939
here then this will work

158
00:04:01,939 --> 00:04:04,819
automatically but uh say you named

159
00:04:04,819 --> 00:04:04,849
it

160
00:04:04,939 --> 00:04:06,729
something else you wanted to add a

161
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:08,520
variable it's very simple as we

162
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,099
saw over here you copy this

163
00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:12,009
make sure the word bearer and

164
00:04:12,009 --> 00:04:14,060
space is in there for that's the

165
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,310
type of authentication that the mx

166
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:16,740
toolbox

167
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:19,509
api uses then we do a space to uh

168
00:04:19,569 --> 00:04:22,680
curly brackets there we go that's

169
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,019
it paste it in so if we've got

170
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,279
the setup for you so just go to uh

171
00:04:27,329 --> 00:04:29,439
variables create one named mx

172
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:31,860
toolbox api paste in your api key

173
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:32,319
and

174
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,470
then everything else will work so

175
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:36,579
then it runs through all of those

176
00:04:36,579 --> 00:04:39,490
before we send it to an ai to make

177
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:39,720
an

178
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,110
analysis of it where it gives us a

179
00:04:42,209 --> 00:04:44,100
score a grade a summary uh notes

180
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:46,420
any issues uh and ways to fix this

181
00:04:46,459 --> 00:04:47,699
and then we save it to an air

182
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,350
table base so i'm going to share

183
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:50,769
the air table base that i've

184
00:04:50,769 --> 00:04:51,319
created

185
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,060
for this uh with you guys so you

186
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,889
guys can essentially copy it uh

187
00:04:54,889 --> 00:04:56,430
but all this does here is it

188
00:04:56,439 --> 00:04:57,040
stores the

189
00:04:57,079 --> 00:04:59,089
assessment in the air table base

190
00:04:59,089 --> 00:05:00,970
so this is what it looks like uh

191
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:02,899
it's just called domain risk

192
00:05:02,899 --> 00:05:03,250
manager

193
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,480
and if you go across here you can

194
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,759
see it's got all the information

195
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:06,660
we need gives us the

196
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,779
different uh results the score the

197
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:10,990
timestamp and the recommendations

198
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:12,149
and then the status

199
00:05:12,259 --> 00:05:13,189
so this just helps us to keep

200
00:05:13,189 --> 00:05:14,370
track of everything and make sure

201
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:15,620
that everything is all running

202
00:05:15,689 --> 00:05:16,100
smoothly

203
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:17,399
uh we can check this on a regular

204
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:18,500
basis but also we want to be

205
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,769
notified if there's a problem

206
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:20,089
right

207
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:22,600
so it checks the alert threshold

208
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,740
so basically if the alert is or

209
00:05:24,769 --> 00:05:27,279
the domain score is less than 70

210
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:28,990
it will send us uh an alert and if

211
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,660
not it just sends us the status

212
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,120
report after the thing is run

213
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,389
saying it's all good here's what

214
00:05:33,389 --> 00:05:34,509
we've got so far so either way

215
00:05:34,509 --> 00:05:36,040
you're getting a message in slack

216
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:37,240
either saying that there's a

217
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:38,689
critical alert or that everything

218
00:05:38,689 --> 00:05:40,519
is all good and again as i've

219
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:40,720
shown you

220
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:42,259
in previous videos to set up slack

221
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:43,629
you simply just add your slack

222
00:05:43,629 --> 00:05:45,220
account then choose whether you

223
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:45,379
want

224
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:46,949
the message to go to a channel or

225
00:05:47,009 --> 00:05:48,490
to a user so you can send it to a

226
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:50,040
channel uh you know it's gonna be

227
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:51,300
your email to really check our

228
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,720
channel to make sure it's working

229
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,939
okay uh you just send message to

230
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,230
channel instead of user and select

231
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:57,439
your channel from here or select

232
00:05:57,439 --> 00:05:58,610
user and then as i have done

233
00:05:58,699 --> 00:06:00,860
select my username from slack and

234
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:03,300
that's how the slack notifications

235
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,040
work so again if you just roll

236
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:06,839
through this super quick you will

237
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:08,670
trigger the manual assessment by

238
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:10,589
uh opening the form and inputting

239
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,610
uh all of this information here

240
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:14,680
then it will send that through to

241
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,810
mx toolbox where we check all of

242
00:06:16,889 --> 00:06:17,000
the

243
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,370
different uh things we need to

244
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:19,509
know about the domain our ai

245
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:20,990
summarizes it in a nice report

246
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:21,930
stores it in

247
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,769
air table and then sends us a

248
00:06:23,829 --> 00:06:25,930
message in slack so again i will

249
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:28,480
share this uh air table base uh

250
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:28,720
with

251
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:29,910
you so you guys can copy it

252
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:31,449
exactly if you make a base and you

253
00:06:31,449 --> 00:06:33,269
name it domain risk manager you

254
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:33,730
name

255
00:06:33,779 --> 00:06:35,660
the table deliverability

256
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:38,120
assessments and add these fields

257
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,279
then we will be good to go uh you

258
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:40,899
also if

259
00:06:40,939 --> 00:06:42,100
you're totally free to swap this

260
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,290
out for a google sheet it'd be the

261
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:44,420
exact same process you would

262
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:44,569
simply

263
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,290
just add a google sheet node and

264
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:47,939
you would change adding uh all

265
00:06:47,939 --> 00:06:49,819
these uh different outputs that

266
00:06:49,819 --> 00:06:49,899
you

267
00:06:49,939 --> 00:06:51,310
get here so you don't score grade

268
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,579
summary issues remediation

269
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:53,990
optimizations just got all that

270
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,360
stuff

271
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:56,329
there so that's the basis of how

272
00:06:56,329 --> 00:06:58,360
it works um hopefully this will be

273
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:00,199
a super useful one for you guys

274
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,389
especially any of you guys that

275
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:02,399

00:07:02,449 --> 00:07:03,540
marketing and e-com email

277
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:03,839

278
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:06,250
and uh yeah i'll see you guys in

279
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:07,040
