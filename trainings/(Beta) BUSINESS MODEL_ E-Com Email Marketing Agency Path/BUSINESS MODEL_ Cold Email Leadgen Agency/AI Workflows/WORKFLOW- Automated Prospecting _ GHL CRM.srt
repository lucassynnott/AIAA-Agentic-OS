1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:01,530
What's up guys, Lucas here.

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:02,830
Today I'm going to be showing you

3
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:05,019
our targeted prospect list builder

4
00:00:05,019 --> 00:00:05,780
workflow.

5
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:07,459
This is a super interesting

6
00:00:07,929 --> 00:00:09,609
workflow that basically finds

7
00:00:09,779 --> 00:00:11,529
contact details for people

8
00:00:11,619 --> 00:00:13,060
to add to your CRM for you, fully

9
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:14,679
enriched, ready to go, ready for

10
00:00:14,679 --> 00:00:15,539
you to reach out.

11
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,690
So the way that this works is it

12
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:20,120
uses a tool called SURF, S-U-R-F-E

13
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:20,960
dot com.

14
00:00:21,019 --> 00:00:22,410
I'm going to be going over, as

15
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:23,769
usual, how to set up all the

16
00:00:23,769 --> 00:00:25,100
accounts you'll need for

17
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,660
this and just explaining how the

18
00:00:27,129 --> 00:00:27,859
workflow works.

19
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:28,879
Of course, first thing you're

20
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:29,699
going to need is going to be a

21
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:30,539
SURF.com account.

22
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,060
They have a free trial, as you can

23
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:33,640
see here on their pricing page.

24
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,140
And then their essential plan is

25
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:38,920
about like $42 or something per

26
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:39,630
month.

27
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,200
And their pro is like $84,

28
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,920
something like that per month.

29
00:00:42,979 --> 00:00:44,210
And you can see here, you get 150

30
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,880
email finders, 1000 email finders,

31
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:46,820
all this sort of stuff.

32
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,060
They all have unlimited email

33
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:48,759
validation.

34
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,320
And you probably want to get the

35
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:51,979
essential plan to get started.

36
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,579
But for now, we're just going to

37
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:55,000
show you kind of how SURF works

38
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,799
and why this is actually

39
00:00:56,859 --> 00:00:57,619
extremely, extremely, extremely

40
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:58,009
powerful.

41
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,020
So the first thing is, this is

42
00:01:00,049 --> 00:01:02,000
just for testing purposes.

43
00:01:02,119 --> 00:01:03,630
We can just remove that and just

44
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:05,219
tidy up the workflow.

45
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,260
It's a little trick as well.

46
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:07,269
If you right-click anywhere on the

47
00:01:07,269 --> 00:01:08,140
canvas, you can click tidy up

48
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:08,920
workflow to make things

49
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:09,269
look nicer.

50
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:11,439
So the first thing is the form

51
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:12,200
input.

52
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:13,409
You're just going to put in your

53
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:14,900
industry that you're researching,

54
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:15,680
the max employee

55
00:01:15,739 --> 00:01:17,239
count, the country code that you

56
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:18,870
want to search within, your name

57
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:19,819
and your email.

58
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:22,329
Then from there, we set the

59
00:01:22,329 --> 00:01:24,359
prospect data just, you know, I'll

60
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:25,359
put it like this.

61
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:28,140
And then we search ICP companies.

62
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,170
Now, again, I'm going to show you

63
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:30,069
here how you're going to set up

64
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:31,099
your SURF credentials.

65
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,590
So this one works a little bit

66
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:34,359
different to some of the others.

67
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,840
This will already be filled in for

68
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:35,989
you.

69
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:37,250
The method will be filled in for

70
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:38,310
you and the URL will be filled in

71
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:38,640
for you.

72
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:39,939
The URL, just if you need to put

73
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,540
it in yourself, https colon slash

74
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:45,359
slash api.surfe.com slash

75
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:47,019
v2 slash company slash search.

76
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,370
Now, here's the part you're going

77
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,239
to have to set up.

78
00:01:49,299 --> 00:01:50,540
You're going to choose for

79
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,459
authentication, generic credential

80
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:53,900
type and header auth.

81
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:55,459
So you see down here, generic

82
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:57,569
credential type, and then it'll be

83
00:01:57,569 --> 00:01:58,500
header auth.

84
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,060
And then once that's set up,

85
00:02:00,129 --> 00:02:02,010
you'll have to add your details

86
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:02,480
here.

87
00:02:02,659 --> 00:02:03,810
Now, this seems complicated.

88
00:02:03,879 --> 00:02:04,280
It's not.

89
00:02:04,329 --> 00:02:05,019
It's actually a lot simpler than

90
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:05,750
even some of the other ones we've

91
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:06,040
done.

92
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,270
You're just going to click add

93
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:10,400
new, create new credential or edit

94
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,289
the one you have and

95
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,000
type the word authorization with a

96
00:02:14,419 --> 00:02:14,680
capital A.

97
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,240
Then after signing up for SURF,

98
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:18,110
just note they will actually make

99
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:19,560
you install a Chrome extension,

100
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:20,490
which is kind of annoying, but

101
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:21,120
just go ahead with it.

102
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:22,580
Once you sign up for SURF, you're

103
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:24,080
going to end up on this page here.

104
00:02:24,139 --> 00:02:25,639
You're going to go to use SURF API

105
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,530
and you're going to copy your API

106
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:29,219
key and you're going to

107
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,919
paste it back in here under value

108
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:33,449
and you're done.

109
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:34,240
That's it.

110
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,500
This will be set up as well.

111
00:02:35,699 --> 00:02:37,139
SendBuddy and then we've formatted

112
00:02:37,139 --> 00:02:38,539
what you're going to be searching

113
00:02:38,539 --> 00:02:39,080
for here.

114
00:02:39,139 --> 00:02:40,650
But that's all you need to do.

115
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:42,409
So again, that is generic

116
00:02:42,409 --> 00:02:44,569
credential type, header auth, set

117
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:46,819
it up with authorization, capital

118
00:02:46,819 --> 00:02:46,870
A

119
00:02:47,729 --> 00:02:48,620
authorization and paste your API

120
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,139
key in here and you are done.

121
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:52,129
And that's actually how a lot of

122
00:02:52,169 --> 00:02:54,120
APIs later on in some of the other

123
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,099
elements.

124
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:56,379
We're trying to avoid API call

125
00:02:56,389 --> 00:02:57,789
ones because it's a bit awkward,

126
00:02:57,789 --> 00:02:58,780
but it does work really,

127
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,080
really well.

128
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,110
So what this node does is it

129
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:04,620
searches for ICP companies.

130
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,699
So you've put in your ICP and what

131
00:03:05,699 --> 00:03:07,229
you're looking for, and now it

132
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:09,020
finds us a bunch of companies

133
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,580
that fit that ICP.

134
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:11,659
Now, of course, this is a very

135
00:03:11,669 --> 00:03:12,139
broad one.

136
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,379
It's a SaaS with employee kind of

137
00:03:13,379 --> 00:03:14,110
10 in the US.

138
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:14,819
It's a lot of people.

139
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,150
So you can be a bit more detailed

140
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:16,530
with that.

141
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:18,259
But after that, it prepares the

142
00:03:18,349 --> 00:03:19,919
JSON payload, essentially just

143
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:21,639
outputs the company's names

144
00:03:21,699 --> 00:03:22,259
and their domains.

145
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,360
And then we use Surf again to

146
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:26,580
search for employees within these

147
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:27,539
companies.

148
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:28,620
And we'll see them down along

149
00:03:28,629 --> 00:03:29,889
here, the different people that

150
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:31,000
are part of the company.

151
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,460
It goes all the way down, all the

152
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:33,960
different names, all different

153
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:35,219
contact details, stuff

154
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:35,569
like that.

155
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:37,139
And then we prepare that for an

156
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:38,500
enrichment request.

157
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,580
And then we enrich those

158
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:41,849
companies.

159
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:42,620
It says our enrichment has

160
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:43,000
started.

161
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,490
We're going to enrich those names

162
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:45,830
and details to get their email

163
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:47,240
addresses on phone numbers,

164
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:47,939
things like that.

165
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,430
So then we check the emission

166
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:50,900
status, make sure that it's

167
00:03:50,979 --> 00:03:51,650
completed.

168
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,560
If it's not, if this is the is

169
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,710
enrichment complete, if it's not

170
00:03:55,879 --> 00:03:57,580
false, we wait three seconds and

171
00:03:57,639 --> 00:03:59,469
check again until it says true,

172
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:01,289
upon which point we extract a list

173
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:02,300
of people.

174
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,599
Here's one guy got 20 items out of

175
00:04:03,699 --> 00:04:04,139
this one.

176
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:06,969
And then we are going to add that

177
00:04:06,969 --> 00:04:09,770
to our go high level CRM and then

178
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,669
send you an email to

179
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:12,360
your own name.

180
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:14,669
Again, send it your Gmail here,

181
00:04:14,669 --> 00:04:16,600
put your email in here and you

182
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:18,769
will get a nice email telling

183
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:19,819
you that the enrichment is

184
00:04:19,819 --> 00:04:21,129
finished and you can go check your

185
00:04:21,139 --> 00:04:21,980
go high level CRM.

186
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,560
where you will find all of your

187
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,860
new contact details.

188
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,350
Now you could also set the

189
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:28,350
prospect data in here manually if

190
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:30,100
you're using the same ICP every

191
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:30,660
single time.

192
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,930
And instead for the trigger,

193
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:35,259
remove the form and instead add

194
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:39,439
your what's called a schedule

195
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,519
or yeah, schedule.

196
00:04:41,579 --> 00:04:42,240
So you do it on a schedule.

197
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,250
So every 24 hours, you could

198
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,459
scrape a certain amount of people.

199
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:46,819
So to do that, you would simply

200
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:49,459
under here, delete these and just

201
00:04:49,459 --> 00:04:50,220
type in.

202
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:51,790
So for instead of for industry

203
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,199
research, just type in SAS instead

204
00:04:54,329 --> 00:04:55,850
of a, so just do SAS like

205
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:57,480
that instead of what we just had

206
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,879
there a second ago, which is

207
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:00,550
taking the data from the input

208
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:01,850
form like that.

209
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,319
And fill these out.

210
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:04,420
So these are basically always

211
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:05,360
going to stay the same.

212
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:07,449
And then when your schedule node

213
00:05:07,449 --> 00:05:09,339
triggers and to do that, if I go

214
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:10,779
to plus and I go to add

215
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:12,600
another trigger and I do on a

216
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:14,759
schedule, you say every one day at

217
00:05:14,889 --> 00:05:16,769
midnight, then we are going

218
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,430
to set the prospect data, which

219
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,079
you filled out manually and

220
00:05:20,209 --> 00:05:21,339
doesn't change.

221
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,339
And then it will run the rest of

222
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:24,639
the automation.

223
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:26,980
So that's basically how that

224
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:27,779
works.

225
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:29,600
Again, by the end of it, you're

226
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:31,490
going to input your data, then it

227
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,160
will search for companies

228
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:34,730
that fit that description, search

229
00:05:35,189 --> 00:05:36,870
people in those companies, enrich

230
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,259
those people with contact

231
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:40,230
information and add it to your Go

232
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:41,399
High Level CRM.

233
00:05:41,459 --> 00:05:42,600
Now you will need to set up Go

234
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,750
High Level as well for your

235
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,000
authentication there.

236
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,079
I'm going to do a full video a bit

237
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:48,939
earlier on in the course.

238
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,199
So that's going to explain in

239
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:51,560
detail how to set up your Go High

240
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,160
Level CRM.

241
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,259
I go over it in one of the video

242
00:05:53,259 --> 00:05:54,430
already as well, but I'm going to

243
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:55,480
make a dedicated video

244
00:05:55,639 --> 00:05:57,139
that's going to teach you just how

245
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:58,800
to connect that to Go High Level

246
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:00,160
to N8M because it is a

247
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:00,759
little bit complicated.

248
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:03,480
So look out for that one.

249
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:05,819
And that's basically it.

250
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:07,360
So again, you input the

251
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,779
information here.

252
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:10,360
It finds all the information of

253
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:12,230
their prospects, add them to your

254
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:12,509
CRM.

255
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:13,759
You've got a bunch of new

256
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,379
prospects ready for outreach.

257
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:18,860
So hopefully this was helpful.

258
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,839
and any problems,

259
00:06:19,899 --> 00:06:20,389
feel free to hit me up

260
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,500
and I will see you in the next

261
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:21,720
one.

262
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,300
Peace.
