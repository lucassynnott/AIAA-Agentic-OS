1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:01,740
What's up guys, Lucas here.

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:02,930
So in this one I'm going to be

3
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:04,389
showing you a pretty simple but

4
00:00:04,389 --> 00:00:05,500
very important workflow.

5
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:07,700
What this does is it makes a daily

6
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:10,099
report on your smart lead campaign

7
00:00:10,099 --> 00:00:12,380
statistics as well as the health

8
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:14,660
of your domains and campaigns.

9
00:00:14,699 --> 00:00:16,410
It also alerts you if your bounce

10
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:17,940
rate goes above 10%.

11
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:19,350
So this is super helpful for one,

12
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:20,719
just getting an overview of kind

13
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:22,129
of how your campaigns are doing on

14
00:00:22,129 --> 00:00:23,179
a day-to-day basis,

15
00:00:23,219 --> 00:00:24,679
as well as watching out for any

16
00:00:24,679 --> 00:00:26,410
burn domains that may be affecting

17
00:00:26,429 --> 00:00:27,739
your deliverability.

18
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:29,929
So let's take a look at what this

19
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:31,829
does and what you're going to have

20
00:00:31,829 --> 00:00:32,640
to set up.

21
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:34,539
So you'll need to set up Google

22
00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:36,759
Sheets using the Google Sheets

23
00:00:36,759 --> 00:00:38,700
account and you need to set up

24
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:40,079
Slack as usual.

25
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:41,859
The only other thing you're going

26
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:43,530
to need for this is going to be

27
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:44,899
your smart lead API key.

28
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:46,100
And where you put that is on all

29
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:47,689
these nodes here, wherever you see

30
00:00:47,689 --> 00:00:48,810
the little globe with HTTP

31
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:49,460
requests,

32
00:00:49,509 --> 00:00:50,659
you're going to put this in, but

33
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:51,560
it's very simple.

34
00:00:51,619 --> 00:00:53,479
Let's see here API key to get

35
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:55,899
this, go to smart lead, go to your

36
00:00:55,899 --> 00:00:58,710
account icon over here, click

37
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,399
settings and click copy key.

38
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:02,929
And then you're just going to

39
00:01:02,939 --> 00:01:04,519
paste that right in there.

40
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:05,700
And that's all you need to do.

41
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:07,959
So what this one does is it gets

42
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:10,879
different metrics for your domain.

43
00:01:11,129 --> 00:01:13,400
If we look at the split out node,

44
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,019
you can see that we've got 293

45
00:01:15,019 --> 00:01:15,840
items in total.

46
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:18,290
It basically goes over the entire

47
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:20,519
of the time that the campaign is

48
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:21,959
run and we update.

49
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,579
It gets to see how many emails are

50
00:01:23,579 --> 00:01:25,260
sent, replied, bound, subscribed,

51
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:26,359
all those sort of things.

52
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:29,140
So it updates our sheet here daily

53
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:31,180
with that information.

54
00:01:31,239 --> 00:01:32,959
This one does the same thing, but

55
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:34,859
for campaigns overall, this was

56
00:01:34,989 --> 00:01:36,760
for each individual domain.

57
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:38,480
This just does it for campaigns.

58
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:39,540
So we check here, you can see

59
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,989
we've got two campaigns about a

60
00:01:40,989 --> 00:01:42,439
hero section campaign and welcome

61
00:01:42,489 --> 00:01:43,189
flow campaign.

62
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:44,930
How many sent, replied, bounced,

63
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:46,640
open rate, all our metrics here.

64
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:48,170
And this keeps it updated in a

65
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:49,400
Google sheet here.

66
00:01:49,459 --> 00:01:52,530
And this trigger sets run every 24

67
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:53,359
hours.

68
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:55,079
It will also send us a Slack

69
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:57,319
message with the, you can see here

70
00:01:57,319 --> 00:01:58,879
what it looks like.

71
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,439
It'll say just the date, the

72
00:02:00,489 --> 00:02:02,549
campaign name, email sent, emails

73
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:04,319
open, replies, bounced.

74
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:05,709
Now, the reason it was open to

75
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:07,200
zero is because I'm not tracking

76
00:02:07,209 --> 00:02:07,989
email opens.

77
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:09,729
But this just gives you a daily

78
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:11,159
summary of kind of how the

79
00:02:11,189 --> 00:02:12,479
campaign is doing.

80
00:02:12,539 --> 00:02:14,229
Then domain health checks the

81
00:02:14,229 --> 00:02:16,159
health of your domains by looking

82
00:02:16,289 --> 00:02:17,629
for bounced emails.

83
00:02:17,689 --> 00:02:19,310
You can see here we get the same

84
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:20,870
information out again.

85
00:02:20,939 --> 00:02:22,599
This is the domain health metrics.

86
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:24,219
So you can see all the information

87
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:25,560
we get here for each domain that

88
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,050
we have.

89
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:26,819
This is going to go down.

90
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:28,389
There's a bunch along here for the

91
00:02:28,389 --> 00:02:29,819
table, a bit easier to see.

92
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:31,909
Yes, we've got nine domains here

93
00:02:31,909 --> 00:02:34,310
and it's going to, or 10, I think

94
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:35,120
the total.

95
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:36,759
And it's going to update our

96
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:38,050
Google sheet with that

97
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:39,099
information.

98
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,659
And then what this does, it says

99
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:44,349
if the total bounce rate is above

100
00:02:44,349 --> 00:02:45,319
10%,

101
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,560
then it sends us a message in

102
00:02:47,659 --> 00:02:49,900
Slack saying, yo, critical bounce

103
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,120
rate and gives us all the

104
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,800
information we need on the metrics

105
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:55,169
so that you can go and quickly

106
00:02:55,169 --> 00:02:56,419
take a look.

107
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:57,469
It says immediate action needed.

108
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:58,590
Stop all campaigns in this domain

109
00:02:58,590 --> 00:02:58,759
now.

110
00:02:58,889 --> 00:02:59,569
Check for domain blacklist

111
00:02:59,569 --> 00:03:00,020
immediately.

112
00:03:01,469 --> 00:03:02,889
identify authentication records

113
00:03:02,889 --> 00:03:04,229
gives you an idea of kind of what

114
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,669
you should do straight away.

115
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,370
This is the same, but for overall

116
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:08,110
campaigns.

117
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,550
If the campaigns are doing poorly

118
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:10,699
and if the bounce rate is too

119
00:03:10,699 --> 00:03:12,090
high, it will do the exact same

120
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:12,539
thing.

121
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:13,719
Critical bounce rate alert, the

122
00:03:13,889 --> 00:03:15,080
severity, and give you all the

123
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,629
information that you need in order

124
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:18,120
to make sure that you are keeping

125
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:20,219
track of which domains and which

126
00:03:20,419 --> 00:03:21,189
campaigns are currently

127
00:03:21,189 --> 00:03:21,659
performing.

128
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:23,389
And which have high bounce rates

129
00:03:23,389 --> 00:03:24,729
that could be affecting your

130
00:03:24,729 --> 00:03:26,409
deliverability and overall domain

131
00:03:26,409 --> 00:03:28,099
health and sender reputation.

132
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:30,259
So, as you can see, this is a

133
00:03:30,259 --> 00:03:32,860
little bit more advanced than just

134
00:03:32,969 --> 00:03:35,569
doing your basic, you know, daily

135
00:03:35,569 --> 00:03:37,419
campaign reporting.

136
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:38,120
We've got that in there.

137
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:39,870
We're also setting up alerts for

138
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:41,349
high bounce rates and we're

139
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:42,830
keeping track of our domain

140
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:43,599
metrics.

141
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,370
We can analyze those over times

142
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:46,979
and see if anything we can do to

143
00:03:46,979 --> 00:03:48,840
improve it and improve our overall

144
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,710
cold email setup, domain setup,

145
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:52,180
and deliverability.

146
00:03:52,219 --> 00:03:53,900
So, it makes it super easy just to

147
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,340
keep track of everything and

148
00:03:55,379 --> 00:03:57,110
really helpful reporting to your

149
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:58,180
clients as well.

150
00:03:58,229 --> 00:03:59,770
You know, you could even put this

151
00:03:59,789 --> 00:04:01,389
in the client channel with them so

152
00:04:01,389 --> 00:04:02,939
they can see, say, for the daily

153
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:04,719
campaign metrics, how many sends,

154
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:05,860
the replies, et cetera, et cetera,

155
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:06,340
et cetera.

156
00:04:06,469 --> 00:04:07,939
So, super useful.

157
00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:09,590
As I said, kind of simple, pretty

158
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:11,169
basic and straightforward.

159
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,740
All you're going to need to set up

160
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,639
again, just get your Smart Lead

161
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:17,259
API key and just paste it in

162
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,120
wherever it says API key in here.

163
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:21,139
And you are going to want to set

164
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:22,980
up your Google Sheets and your

165
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:23,620
Slack.

166
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:24,540
And that's it.

167
00:04:24,649 --> 00:04:25,660
Simple but important.

168
00:04:25,829 --> 00:04:27,509
And make sure you got this one set

169
00:04:27,509 --> 00:04:28,850
up if you are running lead

170
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:30,540
generation email campaigns for

171
00:04:30,649 --> 00:04:31,370
your clients.

172
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:32,920
I hope this is helpful and I will

173
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:34,019
see you in the next one.

174
00:04:34,129 --> 00:04:34,660
Peace.
