1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:01,620
What's up guys, Lucas here.

2
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:02,700
Today I'm going to be going over

3
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:04,099
the cold email script writer

4
00:00:04,099 --> 00:00:04,780
workflow.

5
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:06,459
Now this is for if you want to

6
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:08,570
create cold email campaigns at

7
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:10,960
scale using a CSV file of leads.

8
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,810
If you've got a CSV with say a

9
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,839
thousand prospects in there

10
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,510
and you want to write personalized

11
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:17,879
emails for each of them,

12
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,059
that's what this is going to do.

13
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,250
Now we have other videos showing

14
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:23,850
you how to use the client

15
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,570
ascension AI dashboard

16
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,260
to also create your cold email

17
00:00:27,699 --> 00:00:28,800
templates and scripts.

18
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:30,070
So make sure to check out that

19
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:31,320
video as well from Christian

20
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:33,520
and use these based on, you know,

21
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,810
your different kind of use cases.

22
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,119
If you're only doing a small

23
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:40,039
amount of campaigns for, you know,

24
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:41,280
a certain number of lists,

25
00:00:41,729 --> 00:00:43,820
leads, and you just want to write

26
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:45,920
a template to kind of, you know,

27
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,320
send out to a few people at a

28
00:00:47,329 --> 00:00:48,939
time, then follow the CIA

29
00:00:48,939 --> 00:00:50,200
dashboard video.

30
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,600
If you are doing mass campaigns

31
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:53,000
and you specifically want to

32
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:54,000
personalize them,

33
00:00:54,509 --> 00:00:57,520
then try using this workflow.

34
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,560
So as usual, I'm going to go over

35
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:01,320
what you need to have set up and

36
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,640
what is involved in this.

37
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:06,390
So let's take a look and see what

38
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,840
we have here.

39
00:01:07,879 --> 00:01:10,000
So we will need your Google Sheets

40
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
connected.

41
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,680
Do you just use your Google Sheets

42
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:13,799
account to log in?

43
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,519
You'll be good to go.

44
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,930
You will need, as usual, open

45
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:17,540
router.

46
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:19,219
We use perplexity for the

47
00:01:19,659 --> 00:01:20,340
research.

48
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:22,049
So we'll suggest setting your

49
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:23,180
perplexity there.

50
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:24,659
As usual, you just go here, get

51
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:26,420
your perplexity API key, put it in

52
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,140
there, and you'll be good to go.

53
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:31,420
And we will need Slack set up.

54
00:01:31,459 --> 00:01:33,019
And as we've talked about in other

55
00:01:33,019 --> 00:01:34,519
videos, you just connect your

56
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:35,799
Slack account, log in.

57
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:36,879
It's all good to go.

58
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,409
So one thing I want to note is

59
00:01:38,409 --> 00:01:40,620
this little active button up here.

60
00:01:41,069 --> 00:01:42,140
Basically, the way this works is

61
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:43,620
that once this workflow is set to

62
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:46,620
active, once you get your campaign

63
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:48,890
request form URL and you submit

64
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:49,709
that URL,

65
00:01:50,219 --> 00:01:51,450
that will cause this whole

66
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:52,680
workflow to trigger.

67
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:55,400
So essentially, the way this works

68
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,849
for any workflow that goes off of

69
00:01:57,939 --> 00:01:59,659
a form is you can create a

70
00:01:59,659 --> 00:02:01,590
bookmark or create a list of all

71
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:03,239
your different forms that you need

72
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:04,560
to input to trigger certain

73
00:02:04,659 --> 00:02:05,280
workflows.

74
00:02:05,379 --> 00:02:06,900
And just once it's set to active

75
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,400
up here, when you submit that

76
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,830
form, those workflows will

77
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,370
trigger.

78
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,139
So let's take a look at what the

79
00:02:12,139 --> 00:02:13,270
form looks like.

80
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:13,840
This is it.

81
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,639
It's very basic.

82
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,250
You're going to put in your name,

83
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:17,939
your title, a description of your

84
00:02:17,939 --> 00:02:19,460
product or service, your value

85
00:02:19,909 --> 00:02:21,639
proposition, your company website,

86
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:23,569
and you're going to upload your

87
00:02:23,569 --> 00:02:24,659
lead list CSV.

88
00:02:24,699 --> 00:02:26,340
Once you do that, then this

89
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,659
situation runs where we process

90
00:02:28,659 --> 00:02:30,979
the CSV, normalize the data, and

91
00:02:30,979 --> 00:02:33,129
we process the other form data as

92
00:02:33,139 --> 00:02:35,349
well for merging it together.

93
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:38,009
And then we create an empty blank

94
00:02:38,009 --> 00:02:40,360
spreadsheet that will be named

95
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,889
just cold email campaigns and the

96
00:02:42,889 --> 00:02:45,129
date and time that it was it was

97
00:02:45,189 --> 00:02:45,800
run.

98
00:02:45,889 --> 00:02:47,620
After that, we will generate an

99
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:48,960
email sequence.

100
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,530
Now, these are generated based on

101
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:53,819
writings from Christian and his

102
00:02:54,229 --> 00:02:55,580
previous examples.

103
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,580
We actually have a full list in

104
00:02:57,819 --> 00:02:59,620
here of 30 scripts that won a

105
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,590
breakdown, how to write a good

106
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,099
cold email, and we have

107
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:05,300
instructions here directly on how

108
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,530
to write the cold email, including

109
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:08,680
your product on offering and

110
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,539
things like that.

111
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,319
Then that runs.

112
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,719
And we also have this up as an

113
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:14,689
output parser.

114
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,389
What the output parser really just

115
00:03:16,819 --> 00:03:18,500
means is that instead of giving us

116
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,300
one string called output, it

117
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,250
breaks it down by how we delineate

118
00:03:22,419 --> 00:03:22,699
it.

119
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:25,280
So we have told the output parser

120
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,039
that we want, uh, things like a,

121
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:30,740
uh, as a object, uh, sorry, the

122
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:33,490
email sequence, uh, we want the

123
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:35,900
timing, the subject suggestion,

124
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:37,539
the body CTA framework, key

125
00:03:37,909 --> 00:03:39,509
elements, personalization, use

126
00:03:39,509 --> 00:03:41,159
required things like this.

127
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:42,710
So that now when the AI generates

128
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:44,539
this, we get email number, timing,

129
00:03:44,539 --> 00:03:46,039
subject suggestion, body, CTA

130
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:47,650
framework, key elements, et

131
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:49,520
cetera, like that throughout it.

132
00:03:50,219 --> 00:03:52,300
Um, that will generate the basic

133
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,319
body of your email template.

134
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,000
Then what do we do is we actually

135
00:03:56,439 --> 00:03:58,819
research the prospect afterwards.

136
00:03:58,979 --> 00:04:00,500
We do a prospect research agent

137
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,060
use perplexity to do a detailed

138
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,430
research on the prospect.

139
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:04,930
Now I use an example, lead list

140
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:05,240
CSV.

141
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:06,159
I don't think they're actually

142
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:06,620
real people.

143
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,800
Um, but, uh, it did some research

144
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,830
on the first one was a law firm.

145
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:12,020
So it gave us, I'm going to go to

146
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:13,210
a conversation starters, a

147
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:15,080
personalized first line, uh, some

148
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:16,259
like the objections.

149
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,939
Uh, and these are also all based

150
00:04:18,379 --> 00:04:20,399
around our, uh, service as well.

151
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:22,089
The service that we chose for this

152
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:24,189
was a, uh, content repurposing

153
00:04:24,259 --> 00:04:24,899
service.

154
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,540
And we'd save them, you know, a

155
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,139
hundred hours or per month on, on

156
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:29,339
content creation.

157
00:04:29,379 --> 00:04:31,350
Uh, after that, we send that to a

158
00:04:31,459 --> 00:04:33,459
first line writer and this was, he

159
00:04:33,459 --> 00:04:35,660
writes a personalized first line

160
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:37,810
for the prospect based again on

161
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:39,339
what you do and on the research we

162
00:04:39,339 --> 00:04:40,189
have from over here.

163
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,339
So the one is after seeing the ABA

164
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:42,990
2023 tech report showing attorneys

165
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:44,589
using 40% of billable times and

166
00:04:44,589 --> 00:04:45,610
non billable tasks like content

167
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:45,990
creation.

168
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,220
I've been curious how Grimes and

169
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:48,509
Huff balances thought leadership

170
00:04:48,509 --> 00:04:49,589
with the pressure to maximize

171
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:50,579
partner productivity.

172
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:52,939
Then we create some AB variants of

173
00:04:52,939 --> 00:04:55,149
our emails, including some first

174
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:56,449
lines as well.

175
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,759
So we end up with, uh, uh, three

176
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:01,000
variants in total, just AB tests

177
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,139
of our emails.

178
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,750
And finally we format all of

179
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,720
these, and this is what's going to

180
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:07,860
go into our CSV.

181
00:05:07,899 --> 00:05:08,959
So you end up with the CSV,

182
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:10,360
they'll have the prospect name,

183
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,439
their email, the formatted

184
00:05:11,589 --> 00:05:13,310
personalized, uh, email, the

185
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:15,589
company name, email one, two, and

186
00:05:15,589 --> 00:05:16,970
three in the sequence, and then

187
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:18,399
various AB and C.

188
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:21,699
And if we check our CSV here, this

189
00:05:21,699 --> 00:05:23,420
is what it looks like.

190
00:05:23,459 --> 00:05:24,699
Now I have customized this

191
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:26,480
afterwards when the, when the, the

192
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,029
first, uh, row here is put in,

193
00:05:28,069 --> 00:05:29,509
it'll just look like this Texas

194
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:30,899
white text, but you can then

195
00:05:30,899 --> 00:05:32,730
modify it afterwards to make it a

196
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:33,500
bit easier to read.

197
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,230
And it'll, uh, update normally

198
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:36,290
then after that.

199
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,399
So prospect name, Victor Cochran

200
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:39,839
email company name.

201
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:41,139
Hi, Victor.

202
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,470
After seeing the AB 23, but we

203
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:43,540
just, the first time we just

204
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:44,120
talked about.

205
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:44,850
So with this whole content

206
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:45,680
production, getting a lot of

207
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,720
references to pieces, we have to

208
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,139
market teams have 10 plus hours.

209
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:48,879
Hope it was a quick chat about

210
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:49,540
your content workflow.

211
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:50,920
Uh, hi, Victor, struggling with

212
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:52,310
slow content production, getting a

213
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,540
lot of references to pieces.

214
00:05:53,579 --> 00:05:54,759
Uh, hey, Victor, I put together a

215
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:55,829
short video showing you how you

216
00:05:55,829 --> 00:05:57,029
can 10 extra content output,

217
00:05:57,029 --> 00:05:58,040
creating anything new.

218
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,490
Victor, reaching out one last

219
00:05:59,560 --> 00:05:59,980
time.

220
00:06:00,019 --> 00:06:01,920
And then the very inside, Victor,

221
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,040
same first line.

222
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:03,699
Right now your partners will be

223
00:06:03,769 --> 00:06:04,439
suffering from the bill of virus.

224
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,389
The draft should be thought you've

225
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:06,199
forgotten while struggling to keep

226
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:07,220
your digital presence consistently

227
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:07,560
updated.

228
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,310
Imagine this day that your

229
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,230
training is focusing solely on

230
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:09,860
billable work.

231
00:06:09,899 --> 00:06:11,250
Uh, this one, did you know, clear

232
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:12,649
24 legal trends research revealed

233
00:06:12,829 --> 00:06:14,079
first hosting weekly thought.

234
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,459
Later should be 46% hard client

235
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:16,199
conversation.

236
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,399
Uh, then I, Victor, many firms at

237
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:19,670
Grimes show the products needing

238
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:21,019
consistent thought issue.

239
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:21,879
But the ABI tech part shows the

240
00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:22,949
trainers who's nearly half their

241
00:06:23,129 --> 00:06:24,060
weeks and not available tasks.

242
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,660
So you get a bunch of emails out

243
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:26,220
there.

244
00:06:26,259 --> 00:06:27,899
And the, uh, way this workflow

245
00:06:28,339 --> 00:06:30,189
works is that once it finishes the

246
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:32,009
first prospect, it loops.

247
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:33,759
And it writes these for every

248
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:34,519
prospect.

249
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,819
So if you've got a hundred

250
00:06:35,829 --> 00:06:37,649
prospects, it will write, uh, a

251
00:06:37,649 --> 00:06:39,379
hundred of these emails and update

252
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:42,540
the, uh, CSV with those hundred

253
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:43,160
emails.

254
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,740
So that is essentially, uh, oh

255
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:46,459
yeah.

256
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,689
Finally, when it's done doing

257
00:06:47,689 --> 00:06:49,009
that, it will notify you in Slack

258
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:50,370
telling you, Hey, uh, these are

259
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:51,180
all finished.

260
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:52,319
Uh, go check it out and a link to

261
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:53,139
the document.

262
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,290
So that's basically how this works

263
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:56,860
again, when you want to use this,

264
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:58,439
you're going to get this, uh,

265
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:00,120
NNJSON, you're going to copy it.

266
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,660
You're going to paste it into

267
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,699
your, uh, own NN, uh, workspace,

268
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:05,329
or you're going to do the three

269
00:07:05,389 --> 00:07:07,069
dots and import from the file and

270
00:07:07,069 --> 00:07:08,540
import the JSON file.

271
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,639
Uh, it will look like this.

272
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,439
You will get a red, uh, error on

273
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:17,009
Google docs, on, uh, Slack, uh,

274
00:07:17,009 --> 00:07:19,939
perplexity and open writer.

275
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,290
So you have to set all those up,

276
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:22,360
just your accounts.

277
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:24,370
And then, uh, you will have to,

278
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,399
once they're all set up, they're

279
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:27,220
good to go.

280
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,000
Uh, you will set the workflow live

281
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:30,639
and you will do a test by putting

282
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,180
in probably a CSV of maybe just,

283
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:33,920
you know, one contact entity to

284
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,660
test it.

285
00:07:34,819 --> 00:07:36,180
Upload it through the form to get

286
00:07:36,259 --> 00:07:37,579
the form URL, you'll go here and

287
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,120
you'll go to production URL and

288
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:39,639
copy that.

289
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,839
And then paste that into a new

290
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,180
browser window.

291
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,139
It'll look like this.

292
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,819
You'll fill that out, uh, submit

293
00:07:45,939 --> 00:07:47,720
it, and then watch it run through

294
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:48,959
and make sure that it is working

295
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:50,560
appropriately.

296
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,639
So that's the basics of how this

297
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,980
workflow works.

298
00:07:54,019 --> 00:07:55,610
Again, as I said, if you are just

299
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:56,779
wanting to write one email

300
00:07:56,949 --> 00:07:58,470
template to be used with a number

301
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,620
of prospects with no

302
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,389
personalization, then use the CA

303
00:08:01,389 --> 00:08:02,980
AI dashboard and watch the video

304
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:04,060
from Christian, how to do that.

305
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,579
But if you want to process a large

306
00:08:05,579 --> 00:08:06,860
number of prospects and write

307
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:08,360
personalized emails for them,

308
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,160
then, uh, you will run it through

309
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:10,629
this.

310
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,439
This is one of those things that

311
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:11,899
you can test.

312
00:08:11,939 --> 00:08:12,839
You can run two campaigns.

313
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:13,680
You can try one with no

314
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,660
personalization, one with

315
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:16,000
personalization, see which

316
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,019
performs better.

317
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,949
Um, but this will, uh, help you

318
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:20,819
definitely to mass personalize

319
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,810
those emails on a, uh, you know,

320
00:08:22,899 --> 00:08:23,800
major basis.

321
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:25,500
So hope this is helpful and I will

322
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,399
see you guys in the next one.

323
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:28,100
Peace.
