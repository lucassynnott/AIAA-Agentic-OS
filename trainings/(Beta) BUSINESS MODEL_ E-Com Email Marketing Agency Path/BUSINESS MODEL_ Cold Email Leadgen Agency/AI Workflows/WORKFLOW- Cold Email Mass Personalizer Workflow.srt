1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,449
What's up guys Lucas here.

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:02,940
So in this video I'm going to be

3
00:00:03,009 --> 00:00:04,820
showing you our detailed cold

4
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:05,040
email

5
00:00:05,209 --> 00:00:05,910
mass personalizer.

6
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:06,919
Now this works a little bit

7
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:08,259
different to our cold email script

8
00:00:08,259 --> 00:00:08,570
writer

9
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:10,019
workflow which writes the entire

10
00:00:10,509 --> 00:00:11,960
script for each prospect.

11
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:13,660
What this does is if you have an

12
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:14,080
existing

13
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:15,490
script that you're happy with that

14
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:16,780
you've gotten likely from the

15
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:18,199
client ascension AI dashboard

16
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:19,839
but you want to personalize the

17
00:00:20,089 --> 00:00:21,609
first line for each prospect that

18
00:00:21,609 --> 00:00:23,300
you have then you will run

19
00:00:23,469 --> 00:00:24,710
this script instead.

20
00:00:24,859 --> 00:00:26,829
So how this works essentially is

21
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,140
that we've got a form submission

22
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:31,390
then we will research the

23
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:33,759
prospects of the form write a

24
00:00:33,799 --> 00:00:35,859
first line for them and then

25
00:00:35,859 --> 00:00:36,299
format the

26
00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:37,179
final email and store it in a

27
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:37,710
Google Sheet.

28
00:00:37,899 --> 00:00:38,729
Now as usual I'm going to walk

29
00:00:38,729 --> 00:00:39,539
through what you need to

30
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:40,950
have set up for this to work and

31
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:42,630
what different nodes there are and

32
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:43,369
what they do.

33
00:00:43,369 --> 00:00:44,219
So you're going

34
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,630
to need to have Google Sheets set

35
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:47,039
up you will need to have your open

36
00:00:47,049 --> 00:00:48,399
router set up as we do with all

37
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:51,270
of the other workflows perplexity

38
00:00:51,369 --> 00:00:54,179
for the research and then Slack to

39
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:56,409
notify you at the end that

40
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:57,420
everything is finished.

41
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,649
So the way that this works is that

42
00:00:59,649 --> 00:01:02,299
we've got a campaign request form

43
00:01:02,299 --> 00:01:03,579
that we submit

44
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,980
and this here you can add your

45
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:08,890
sender name your sender title your

46
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:10,739
existing cold email

47
00:01:10,909 --> 00:01:12,120
script body and you upload your

48
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:12,739
lead list.

49
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:15,939
So I've got a written a cold email

50
00:01:15,939 --> 00:01:16,739
script here that

51
00:01:16,909 --> 00:01:18,150
for the and offer that I'm running

52
00:01:18,329 --> 00:01:19,780
and then I'm going to upload my

53
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:20,709
lead list CSV.

54
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:21,780
Now this is just a

55
00:01:22,219 --> 00:01:23,430
temporary lead list CSV where I

56
00:01:23,609 --> 00:01:25,010
put my own details as the first

57
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:26,500
lead so that it runs properly.

58
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:28,599
Then we're going to process the

59
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:29,030
CSV.

60
00:01:29,109 --> 00:01:31,090
We're going to normalize the data

61
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:32,900
so we get out the information

62
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:33,900
here.

63
00:01:34,069 --> 00:01:35,299
Then we're going to create a blank

64
00:01:35,299 --> 00:01:36,060
spreadsheet.

65
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,719
This just creates a regular blank

66
00:01:37,719 --> 00:01:39,060
spreadsheet to be named cold email

67
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,060
campaigns and the date.

68
00:01:41,219 --> 00:01:43,060
And then our prospect research

69
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:45,439
agent performs a detailed research

70
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,060
on us.

71
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:48,060
So it looks for all information

72
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:51,060
about the lead me in particular.

73
00:01:51,109 --> 00:01:52,150
We've got another system prompt

74
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:53,150
down here that gives it kind of

75
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:54,349
information on how it should be

76
00:01:54,349 --> 00:01:55,819
looking for information, what

77
00:01:55,819 --> 00:01:57,219
information to look for.

78
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:58,620
Then afterwards we get a detailed

79
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:00,040
report out of that that we send to

80
00:02:00,049 --> 00:02:01,189
our icebreaker writer.

81
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:02,530
So this tells it that it's, you

82
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:03,980
know, an icebreaker writer.

83
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:05,680
Then it also tells it the name of

84
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,650
the prospect, the company, the

85
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:10,599
research analysis, and the cold

86
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:12,400
email body.

87
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,250
So you give the cold email body to

88
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:15,949
give an idea of what icebreaker

89
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,060
should write that'll flow properly

90
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,819
into the cold email body.

91
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:22,479
Then after that, we get our, our,

92
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:24,349
our first icebreaker out for the

93
00:02:24,419 --> 00:02:25,710
first, uh, user.

94
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,219
Then we format the final email.

95
00:02:28,219 --> 00:02:29,050
Now this way is going to be

96
00:02:29,189 --> 00:02:30,439
formatting Google, uh, sheets is

97
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:31,810
going to have the prospect name,

98
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,159
the prospect email, the company

99
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:34,830
name, the icebreaker, the email

100
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:35,909
body, and the formatted

101
00:02:36,009 --> 00:02:37,180
personalized email.

102
00:02:37,509 --> 00:02:39,020
And the way that looks, if I go to

103
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,150
Google sheets is prospect name, my

104
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:43,020
name, prospect email, my email

105
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:45,030
company name, uh, the icebreaker

106
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:46,659
on its own, just got your latest

107
00:02:46,659 --> 00:02:47,919
episode on the sauce podcast with

108
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:49,199
scaling agencies that ATK MRT in

109
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:50,469
six months blueprint is seriously

110
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:50,860
gold.

111
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,120
Then the email body that we

112
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,490
submitted at the start of the

113
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:54,180
campaign.

114
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,659
And then both of them combined.

115
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,590
So we can see what the full email

116
00:02:56,629 --> 00:02:57,099
looks like.

117
00:02:57,139 --> 00:02:58,120
Hi, Lucas, just got your latest

118
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:59,199
episode on the sauce podcast with

119
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:00,310
scaling agencies, struggle with

120
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,349
slow content production.

121
00:03:01,419 --> 00:03:02,599
It's the full email kind of

122
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:03,719
written out, right?

123
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,289
So the way you would use this is

124
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,069
when you run this, uh, if you go

125
00:03:08,069 --> 00:03:09,569
back here, actually, we've got a

126
00:03:09,569 --> 00:03:10,129
loop here.

127
00:03:10,139 --> 00:03:12,000
So this loops over the items.

128
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,439
It does it for every, uh, uh,

129
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:15,580
prospect that we have, then, uh,

130
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:17,400
we will, when it's finally done,

131
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,580
it notifies us in Slack.

132
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:19,569
It says it's done with the link to

133
00:03:19,569 --> 00:03:20,229
the Google sheet.

134
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:22,550
But, uh, essentially what you

135
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,680
would do once you have this is

136
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,800
save it as a CSV by going to just

137
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:29,680
file and download and, uh, CSV, we

138
00:03:29,689 --> 00:03:31,210
would upload this to smart lead as

139
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,520
part of your campaign.

140
00:03:32,669 --> 00:03:33,689
And you would map the columns

141
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:34,520
appropriately.

142
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,699
So you would set icebreaker as a

143
00:03:36,699 --> 00:03:37,849
custom input.

144
00:03:37,979 --> 00:03:40,159
And then in your, uh, cold email

145
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,520
body, you would have custom input

146
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:45,159
as a high lead name, custom input,

147
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,580
and then your email body.

148
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,400
And that'd be your campaign pretty

149
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:50,110
much good to go with personalized

150
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,610
first lines for each of your

151
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:52,500
prospects.

152
00:03:53,229 --> 00:03:54,439
So that's just a quick rundown of

153
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:54,810
that one.

154
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:55,979
This is a pretty straightforward

155
00:03:55,979 --> 00:03:56,419
sort of one.

156
00:03:56,419 --> 00:03:57,860
Again, all you need to input on

157
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:59,180
this is going to be the center

158
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:00,439
name, center title, your cold

159
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:01,840
email script, and your lead list.

160
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:03,780
After that, everything pretty much

161
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,370
runs smoothly and, uh, should

162
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,139
create some pretty solid, uh,

163
00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:09,080
personalized email campaigns.

164
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,389
So let me know if you've got any

165
00:04:10,389 --> 00:04:11,710
issues with this one and I will

166
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:12,900
see you in the next one.

167
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:13,500
Peace.
