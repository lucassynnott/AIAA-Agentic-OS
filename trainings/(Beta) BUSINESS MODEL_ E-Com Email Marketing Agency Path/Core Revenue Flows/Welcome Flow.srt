1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:01,530
Let's do this we have the email

2
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:03,259
welcome flow this is probably the

3
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:04,639
most important flow that you are

4
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:06,530
going to have so really breaking

5
00:00:06,549 --> 00:00:08,369
this down this is going to be very

6
00:00:08,439 --> 00:00:09,759
compact with a ton of

7
00:00:09,779 --> 00:00:11,150
information so i'm going to try to

8
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:12,460
move through it fast just so the

9
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:13,730
video isn't too long but you'll

10
00:00:13,859 --> 00:00:15,859
have the document um so you can go

11
00:00:15,859 --> 00:00:17,820
through it yourself um but yeah

12
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,320
welcome flow let's freaking

13
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:21,239
do this thing so let's talk about

14
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:22,820
the purpose of the welcome flow

15
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:24,239
and what it is so this is going

16
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:25,629
to be the sequence of emails that

17
00:00:25,629 --> 00:00:26,940
is sent towards people who join

18
00:00:27,059 --> 00:00:28,219
the email list and emails are

19
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:29,929
going to be sent over a period of

20
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:31,969
7 to 14 days so dialed in welcome

21
00:00:32,039 --> 00:00:33,520
flow is going to allow you to

22
00:00:33,539 --> 00:00:35,170
automate and then predictably

23
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:36,759
convert your customers in the

24
00:00:36,759 --> 00:00:38,560
pre-purchase decision journey

25
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:39,950
so the welcome flow is going to

26
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,179
leave us with two possible

27
00:00:41,189 --> 00:00:42,799
outcomes these are the two goals

28
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:43,039
one of

29
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:44,539
these outcome a we're going to

30
00:00:44,539 --> 00:00:46,100
convert customers who are just

31
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:47,840
curious and otherwise would have

32
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:48,000
left

33
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:49,820
your site so we're converting

34
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:51,729
people we're getting more sales

35
00:00:51,799 --> 00:00:53,840
and then b we want to prime future

36
00:00:53,859 --> 00:00:55,469
customers for purchases now that

37
00:00:55,469 --> 00:00:57,219
all objections have been addressed

38
00:00:57,219 --> 00:00:58,710
so those are the two outcomes

39
00:00:58,740 --> 00:00:59,810
of a welcome flow and having a

40
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:01,090
good welcome flow you're going to

41
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:02,159
get some purchases and then

42
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:02,450
anybody

43
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:03,969
who doesn't purchase you've at

44
00:01:03,969 --> 00:01:05,159
least overcome all their

45
00:01:05,299 --> 00:01:06,750
objections and they're ready to

46
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:07,280
buy in the

47
00:01:07,299 --> 00:01:08,489
future and we don't have to worry

48
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:09,980
about overcoming objections in the

49
00:01:10,099 --> 00:01:12,480
future so that is the welcome

50
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,060
flow so overcoming objections to

51
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:15,500
lead to a purchase so we have all

52
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,879
sorts of objections we want to

53
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:17,379
overcome

54
00:01:17,459 --> 00:01:19,099
things like who is this brand are

55
00:01:19,099 --> 00:01:20,700
they real are they going to scam

56
00:01:20,709 --> 00:01:22,239
me does their product work is

57
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:23,290
the product any good is this

58
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:24,549
product worth the price yada yada

59
00:01:24,549 --> 00:01:25,870
yada bottom line you need to prove

60
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,159
to the

61
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:27,510
customer that you can handle all

62
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:28,859
these objections and that's not

63
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:30,239
going to be a problem for them you

64
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:31,799
need to address these one by one

65
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:33,359
and it's not like you can go up to

66
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:35,040
their door give them a sales pitch

67
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:36,719
person a person that's just not

68
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:38,590
scalable and it would be extremely

69
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:40,640
expensive to do that so we have

70
00:01:40,739 --> 00:01:42,709
to send content we have to send

71
00:01:42,709 --> 00:01:44,879
content we have to send emails to

72
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:47,280
get people to purchase to convince

73
00:01:47,299 --> 00:01:48,590
these people these people are wary

74
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:49,739
they've probably been scammed

75
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,000
online buying before and so we

76
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,250
need to

77
00:01:51,379 --> 00:01:52,829
send them content we can't go to

78
00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:54,359
them in person so let's send them

79
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:55,680
content how do we send them

80
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,260
content

81
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:57,599
email because email is the

82
00:01:57,609 --> 00:01:59,260
cheapest ads are expensive let's

83
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:00,950
send them emails so how to level

84
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:01,120
up your

85
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:02,709
prospects so essentially no matter

86
00:02:02,709 --> 00:02:04,239
what everybody's coming in a level

87
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:05,599
one i do not know or trust this

88
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:07,640
brand you you're able to send them

89
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,490
content show up proving that

90
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:11,080
you're a real brand they then

91
00:02:11,379 --> 00:02:11,669
become

92
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:13,370
intrigued oh yeah i've seen this

93
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:15,000
brand before they seem legit if

94
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:16,719
you come up in conversation that's

95
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:16,719
what

96
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:18,330
they say the more content you send

97
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:19,889
maybe they get to the interested

98
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:21,520
level i like this brand but i'm

99
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:21,840
not

100
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:23,879
fully there yet maybe they don't

101
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,819
have a huge need for the product

102
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:27,860
right now that they realize and

103
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:28,009
then

104
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:29,319
keep sending them more content

105
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:30,419
eventually you're gonna get a

106
00:02:30,419 --> 00:02:31,680
buyer where they where they like

107
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,000
you

108
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:34,250
they trust you and they're ready

109
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:36,150
to buy so right here they you

110
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:38,080
don't address any of them right

111
00:02:38,389 --> 00:02:38,560
here

112
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:40,169
they like you right here they like

113
00:02:40,169 --> 00:02:41,650
you and trust you and then right

114
00:02:41,659 --> 00:02:43,360
here they're also ready to buy

115
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:44,960
and the only way we get that we

116
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,620
get to that point is by sending

117
00:02:46,629 --> 00:02:48,240
content and emails just like the

118
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:48,479
cheapest

119
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,560
way to do that and doing that

120
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,800
through the welcome flow is the

121
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,069
best way to do that and so that's

122
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:52,879
why we send

123
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,419
eight to 12 emails rather than

124
00:02:54,419 --> 00:02:55,569
just like two to three emails

125
00:02:55,699 --> 00:02:57,280
because we need to have multiple

126
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,889
touch points with the customer so

127
00:02:58,889 --> 00:03:00,500
that we earn their trust over time

128
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,840
because you just send somebody

129
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:02,840
one email with a ton of

130
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,460
information we can see here that's

131
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:05,800
not what anybody wants so the

132
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,560
modern customer

133
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:08,229
has a fried attention span and

134
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:09,960
they're just not going to read a

135
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,000
bunch of junk everybody scrolling

136
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,479
tiktok

137
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,969
instagram all day every day

138
00:03:13,969 --> 00:03:15,469
attention spans are cooked

139
00:03:15,469 --> 00:03:18,460
everybody's cooked um even me i

140
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:19,409
will not read

141
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:20,460
anything i will not read any

142
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:21,719
advertisement you better hand it

143
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:22,879
to me on a silver platter or else

144
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,360
i'm not reading it so you need to

145
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,789
give short bite-sized bits of

146
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:27,439
information spread out over a

147
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:29,330
time frame because the issue with

148
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,419
many welcome flows is that they're

149
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,199
way too short in length and way

150
00:03:33,229 --> 00:03:33,439
too

151
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:34,969
dense in information so you're

152
00:03:34,969 --> 00:03:36,449
trying to do all this stuff and

153
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:38,240
you accomplish nothing as a result

154
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:38,400
like

155
00:03:38,419 --> 00:03:39,560
some brands will try to throw all

156
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,819
their brand information into like

157
00:03:40,819 --> 00:03:41,990
two to three emails each being

158
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,240
super

159
00:03:42,259 --> 00:03:43,569
dense like this example you try to

160
00:03:43,569 --> 00:03:44,669
do something like this like

161
00:03:44,669 --> 00:03:46,219
welcome to the brand yada yada

162
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:47,110
yada yada

163
00:03:47,139 --> 00:03:48,439
here's everything about our brand

164
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:49,569
then customers gonna open the

165
00:03:49,569 --> 00:03:50,759
email and then leave and just be

166
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:52,400
like screw this and they're just

167
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,080
gonna be overwhelmed whereas like

168
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,280
the customer if you can

169
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,169
cater to their needs and spread

170
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,259
things out like email one you just

171
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,860
say like welcome in here's your

172
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,330
discount email two here's a brief

173
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:03,789
history about that about us email

174
00:04:03,789 --> 00:04:05,120
three here's your number one

175
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:05,599
bestseller

176
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,280
and then you just go one by one

177
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,169
you send short quick emails then

178
00:04:09,169 --> 00:04:11,080
that's more up their alley and it

179
00:04:11,349 --> 00:04:11,689
converts

180
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:13,449
better so that's part of the

181
00:04:13,449 --> 00:04:15,289
reason we have our strategy so

182
00:04:15,289 --> 00:04:17,120
let's talk again about what

183
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:17,319
happens

184
00:04:17,379 --> 00:04:19,379
to non-buyers in the welcome flow

185
00:04:19,379 --> 00:04:21,339
so many recipients just won't buy

186
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:22,839
and that is okay not a lot of

187
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:23,120
people

188
00:04:23,139 --> 00:04:24,670
will most people won't they just

189
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:26,089
don't have a huge need for your

190
00:04:26,089 --> 00:04:27,519
product right this second

191
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,040
um but that why that's why it's so

192
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,730
important that you're constantly

193
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:32,319
reminding them of your products

194
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:32,399
and

195
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:34,089
staying top of mind by sending

196
00:04:34,089 --> 00:04:35,439
campaigns and having uh

197
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:37,350
abandonment emails so say somebody

198
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:37,759
doesn't buy in the

199
00:04:37,779 --> 00:04:39,139
welcome flow your email funnel

200
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:40,459
should have the following you

201
00:04:40,579 --> 00:04:42,160
should be sending three to four

202
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:43,730
educational email campaigns a week

203
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:44,980
so you stay top of mind you're

204
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,079
staying relevant and you're

205
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,529
getting consistent traffic to your

206
00:04:47,529 --> 00:04:48,699
site and then you'll also have

207
00:04:48,709 --> 00:04:50,060
abandonment flows so say somebody

208
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,550
goes to a campaign and then they

209
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,139
like abandon a product they click

210
00:04:53,139 --> 00:04:54,560
on a campaign about a product

211
00:04:54,579 --> 00:04:55,730
they add it to car and then they

212
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:57,089
leave you have your card abandoned

213
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,189
flows and so even if somebody

214
00:04:58,259 --> 00:04:59,750
doesn't purchase from the welcome

215
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,139
flow we've primed them to be able

216
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:02,220
to purchase down the line

217
00:05:02,339 --> 00:05:03,769
and then we're sending campaigns

218
00:05:03,769 --> 00:05:05,019
to get traffic eventually they

219
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:06,639
might buy something or abandon

220
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:07,990
something and we have emails for

221
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:09,259
that as well so even if somebody

222
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:11,439
doesn't buy we have responses for

223
00:05:11,459 --> 00:05:13,250
them so now we're moving fast i

224
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,290
know but let's break down the flow

225
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:17,199
of emails that we're sending

226
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,870
so this is what we have trigger

227
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:20,730
this is exactly how it should look

228
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:22,240
like in klaviyo somebody joins

229
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:22,389
your

230
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,029
email list so anytime somebody

231
00:05:24,029 --> 00:05:25,839
joins like newsletter that's what

232
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:27,319
the trigger is um and then the

233
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:27,839
filter

234
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,459
which essentially before somebody

235
00:05:29,459 --> 00:05:30,899
receives any one of these emails

236
00:05:30,899 --> 00:05:32,160
they're going to be ran through

237
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:33,360
this filter and klaviyo is going

238
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:34,680
to determine does this person meet

239
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,480
these requirements

240
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:37,079
um if they don't we're not going

241
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:38,639
to send the email to them if they

242
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:39,920
do meet the requirements we're

243
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,000
going

244
00:05:40,019 --> 00:05:41,610
to send it so the filter is made a

245
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:43,370
purchase zero times over all time

246
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:44,879
we only want people to receive

247
00:05:44,899 --> 00:05:46,500
emails if they haven't purchased

248
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,000
before and say somebody hasn't

249
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,600
purchased before they receive

250
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:49,829
email

251
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:52,089
one but they buy after email one

252
00:05:52,089 --> 00:05:54,490
then after one to two days klaviyo

253
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,399
is going to run through this

254
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:58,160
filter and be like has this person

255
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,860
placed an order before they have

256
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,069
placed an order so they're not

257
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:02,800
going to receive this email

258
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,629
they're not going to receive the

259
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:04,480
rest of these and so that's the

260
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:04,610
point

261
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,029
of the filter but let's break down

262
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,240
the flow a little bit and then

263
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,560
we're going to go over each

264
00:06:08,579 --> 00:06:10,029
email so email one we just want to

265
00:06:10,029 --> 00:06:11,509
give a strong introduction most

266
00:06:11,509 --> 00:06:12,879
people are just going to be there

267
00:06:12,899 --> 00:06:14,399
for the discount if you're giving

268
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:15,879
a discount on your cube on uh like

269
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:17,680
your pop-up or something so we

270
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:17,839
just

271
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:18,990
want to do that deliver the

272
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:20,459
discount introduce briefly like

273
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:22,079
your unique selling propositions

274
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:22,399

275
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:23,620
you diff what makes you different

276
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:24,860
have a little bit of social proof

277
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,240
and then show some bestsellers if

278
00:06:26,259 --> 00:06:27,930
people need to be pointed in the

279
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:29,750
right direction so we want to keep

280
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,600
that nice and simple for you

281
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:32,899
uh and then we wait one to two

282
00:06:32,899 --> 00:06:34,300
days so all of the distances in

283
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:35,839
here are one to two days i

284
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:36,319

285
00:06:36,339 --> 00:06:38,360
wouldn't go too far over um i kind

286
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,300
of like to send one day apart the

287
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:42,319

288
00:06:42,339 --> 00:06:43,889

brand story people haven't made a

371
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:47,879

372
00:08:48,019 --> 00:08:49,299
you're faceless brand and they

373
00:08:49,299 --> 00:08:50,700

00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,480
because it's really just actually

543
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,179
telling them like hey this isn't

548
00:13:11,299 --> 00:13:13,070
there then email five is going to

549
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:15,100
be kind of similar to email three

550
00:13:15,139 --> 00:13:17,360
we're just going to show us versus

551
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,450
them directly it's just an easy

552
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:21,039
way to show your benefits is

553
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:21,200
compare

554
00:13:21,379 --> 00:13:23,120
you to competitors so the elephant

555
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,809
in the room is your competitors so

556
00:13:24,809 --> 00:13:26,159
why should somebody go with

557
00:13:26,179 --> 00:13:27,549
you over someone else people just

558
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,690
love pros and cons they like

559
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,129
comparing and contrasting it's how

560
00:13:30,259 --> 00:13:31,870
the brain likes to work um so we

561
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:33,620
want to give that to them and make

562
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,039
it obvious that like we're the

563
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:35,279
best

564
00:13:35,299 --> 00:13:36,480
choice but make it seem like

565
00:13:36,539 --> 00:13:37,899
they've made the decision for

566
00:13:37,899 --> 00:13:39,440
themselves um so that's what we're

567
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:40,850
providing them so address it up

568
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:42,139
front and lay out the facts for

569
00:13:42,259 --> 00:13:43,600
the customer so they can see the

570
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:44,649
full story so address the

571
00:13:44,649 --> 00:13:46,049
competitors outline your unique

572
00:13:46,049 --> 00:13:47,440
selling propositions and

573
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:49,100
distinguish your brand from others

574
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,429
so some subject line ideas us

575
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:52,919
versus them here are the facts why

576
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:55,149
we shine the nike difference

577
00:13:55,149 --> 00:13:57,539
whatever your uh whatever it is

578
00:13:57,539 --> 00:13:59,750
and then yeah so here's like the

579
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:00,159
simple

580
00:14:00,179 --> 00:14:01,529
outline that we use here this

581
00:14:01,539 --> 00:14:03,039
header section is super cool um

582
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:04,720
you can just like list out a quick

583
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,360
feature

584
00:14:05,379 --> 00:14:07,220
um of specifically what you do

585
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:09,539
like maybe you say 20 donated and

586
00:14:09,539 --> 00:14:11,360
then this brand it's like they

587
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:14,600
20 of revenue donated or something

588
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,490
then you could say only donate the

589
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:18,039
profit which is a lower amount

590
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,970
or like they cap their donations

591
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:21,919
at x amount we use this material

592
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:23,659
they use this they use this and

593
00:14:23,669 --> 00:14:23,750
you

594
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:24,889
don't need to say who the

595
00:14:24,889 --> 00:14:26,460
competitors are you can just like

596
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:28,000
hint at it and then remind of the

597
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:28,389
discount

598
00:14:28,419 --> 00:14:29,600
again and then outline some

599
00:14:29,669 --> 00:14:31,230
products as well talking about how

600
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:32,799
they're how they're different how

601
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:33,039
they're

602
00:14:33,059 --> 00:14:34,840
special so that's what we like to

603
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,500
do in this email just to really

604
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,919
clearly lay it out for people

605
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:39,799
again to reinforce to them why

606
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,500
we're different email six

607
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,840
testimonials again proving that we

608
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:43,919
are

609
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:45,600
a real brand people buy from us

610
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,129
and they like us so we want to

611
00:14:47,129 --> 00:14:49,120
like just make sure no matter what

612
00:14:49,129 --> 00:14:49,200
that

613
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,980
the customer knows our product and

614
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:52,570
brand is great so maybe eat it's

615
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:54,149
fine if they don't have a strong

616
00:14:54,179 --> 00:14:55,659
need for our product right now

617
00:14:55,659 --> 00:14:57,100
like if you sell t-shirts for

618
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,799
example like lululemon maybe i

619
00:14:58,799 --> 00:14:59,120
have a ton

620
00:14:59,139 --> 00:15:00,419
of t-shirts in my closet and i

621
00:15:00,419 --> 00:15:01,950
don't want to buy right now that's

622
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:03,279
okay i just want to make sure that

623
00:15:03,299 --> 00:15:04,549
they fully trust our brand to

624
00:15:04,549 --> 00:15:05,809
where if they do have a need in

625
00:15:05,809 --> 00:15:07,440
the future they will come back to

626
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:07,519
us

627
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:09,340
so by creating a whole email out

628
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:11,220
of this it just proves that we're

629
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:12,960
confident in our product and

630
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,320
we'll stand by it and even that

631
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,649
alone just having a full email

632
00:15:15,779 --> 00:15:17,240
dedicated to this will go a long

633
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:17,519
ways

634
00:15:17,539 --> 00:15:19,250
so that's the purpose prove our

635
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:20,779
brand is reputable that our

636
00:15:20,779 --> 00:15:22,879

637
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:23,100

prove that we're real so as for

641
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:28,879
subject lines

642
00:15:28,899 --> 00:15:30,269
you can literally just have like a

643
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,580
testimonial as your subject line

644
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,039
um you can say like don't believe

646
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,169

00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:39,259
the fans say our customers have

649
00:15:39,259 --> 00:15:40,940
spoken things like that then

650
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,919
here's the outline simple again as

651
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:43,509

00:17:05,588 --> 00:17:06,940
absolute last chance we can't hold

709
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:07,950

711
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:11,730
and super easy for somebody to

00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:13,500
click and start shopping

713
00:17:13,539 --> 00:17:15,880
that always has great click rates

714
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,160
and then this is the last email in

715
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,078
the welcome flow so the customer

716
00:17:20,098 --> 00:17:22,119
didn't purchase right off the bat

717
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,940
so what that's okay most won't

718
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:25,920
maybe they just weren't ready

719
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:27,740
but we might still be able to get

720
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:29,420
a few over the line with a nice

721
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:31,200
personal text-based email which

722
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:33,059
these perform super well across no

723
00:17:33,059 --> 00:17:34,819
matter what account we work on um

724
00:17:34,819 --> 00:17:36,319
so this is also going to prime

725
00:17:36,339 --> 00:17:37,559
the customer for future purchases

726
00:17:37,579 --> 00:17:38,710
knowing that the brand owner is

727
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:39,839
willing to reach out if you can

728
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:40,000
make it

729
00:17:40,019 --> 00:17:41,640
from the brand owner um and then

730
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,019
also they might have a real

731
00:17:43,019 --> 00:17:44,559
objection that hasn't been

732
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:45,039
