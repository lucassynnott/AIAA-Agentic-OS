1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:03,529
Okay last but of course not least

2
00:00:03,669 --> 00:00:06,710
we have the win back flow which is

3
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:08,028
going to do kind of how it

4
00:00:08,108 --> 00:00:09,789
sounds when people back it's very

5
00:00:09,789 --> 00:00:11,490
straightforward we just want to

6
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:13,349
encourage people to make another

7
00:00:13,449 --> 00:00:15,550
purchase these are past customers

8
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:17,410
and we want them to come back so

9
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:19,140
do not overthink this flow

10
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:20,769
the thing is like your customers

11
00:00:20,769 --> 00:00:22,530
are still receiving your campaign

12
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:23,719
emails they're still

13
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:25,219
receiving like your sales and

14
00:00:25,219 --> 00:00:26,899
whatever else you're blasting to

15
00:00:26,899 --> 00:00:28,519
your list and if you're like us

16
00:00:28,629 --> 00:00:30,379
and you have an optimized email

17
00:00:30,379 --> 00:00:32,270
channel you're sending three to

18
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:34,179
four email campaigns a week so

19
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:35,829
somebody made a purchase three

20
00:00:35,829 --> 00:00:37,659
four months ago and you're sending

21
00:00:37,659 --> 00:00:39,399
three to four email campaigns a

22
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:39,750
week

23
00:00:39,829 --> 00:00:41,259
that's going to handle a lot of

24
00:00:41,259 --> 00:00:43,130
your repeat purchases 99 of your

25
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:44,560
attention in repeat purchases

26
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:46,310
will come from your campaigns so

27
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:47,850
for this reason we keep the win

28
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:49,600
back flow nice and simple and it's

29
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:51,170
more for like customer experience

30
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:52,549
and to at least automate a part of

31
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:54,259
the customer journey just to

32
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:55,460
be like hey we notice you haven't

33
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,539
bought in a while it's you don't

34
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,789
really get too many sales i

35
00:00:57,929 --> 00:00:58,179
haven't

36
00:00:58,250 --> 00:00:59,770
seen a win back flow like generate

37
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:01,289
crazy money for every brand that

38
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:02,799
i've looked in and even like me

39
00:01:02,869 --> 00:01:04,010
trying to like optimize the heck

40
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:05,030
out of it it's just not how it

41
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:06,239
works a lot of people will just

42
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:07,579
convert from your campaigns so

43
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:08,650
it's more for the customer

44
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:10,250
experience um so let's break down

45
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:10,760
the flow

46
00:01:10,829 --> 00:01:12,060
really simple just three emails

47
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:13,200
the trigger we're just doing a

48
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:14,599
placed order trigger then we're

49
00:01:14,599 --> 00:01:14,739
adding

50
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:16,200
a filter made a purchase zero

51
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,780
times to start in this flow then

52
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:19,959
we have a 90 to 120 day time delay

53
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:22,189
so you could do that um what you

54
00:01:22,189 --> 00:01:24,400
could also do is you could have a

55
00:01:24,489 --> 00:01:27,480
segment based trigger so what you

56
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:27,739
do

57
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:29,530
is you create a segment inside of

58
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:30,959
klaviyo and what you say is

59
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:33,500
somebody placed an order um is at

60
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,579
least is

61
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:36,950
90 days ago or is at least is

62
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:39,519
after 90 days and so then anytime

63
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,040
somebody enters that flow you or

64
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:42,260
anybody

65
00:01:42,349 --> 00:01:43,530
enters that segment you have a

66
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:44,689
flow set up so you create a flow

67
00:01:44,829 --> 00:01:46,260
and then you have the trigger beat

68
00:01:46,329 --> 00:01:47,930
somebody joins a segment and then

69
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:49,459
you set that as the segment for

70
00:01:49,459 --> 00:01:51,439
the person's last purchase was 90

71
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:53,629
days ago um so that's my ideal way

72
00:01:53,629 --> 00:01:55,659
of doing it but for simplicity

73
00:01:55,659 --> 00:01:58,760
sake i just did this so with email

74
00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:00,519
one email two email three email

75
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:02,280
one just a quick it's been a while

76
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:04,069
remind them of the brand encourage

77
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:05,340
them to come back for another

78
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:06,379
purchase just be like hey it's

79
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:07,239
been a while since your last

80
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:07,870
purchase we

81
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:09,340
miss you yada yada more for

82
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:11,090
customer experience and then we

83
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:12,750
wait seven days and then this is

84
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:13,159
where we can

85
00:02:13,289 --> 00:02:14,919
introduce a discount make them

86
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:16,349
feel special with a unique

87
00:02:16,349 --> 00:02:17,909
discount um to try to get them

88
00:02:17,909 --> 00:02:18,530
back wait

89
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:19,919
seven days and then you can do a

90
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:21,169
text-based last chance from the

91
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,520
founder and reminding them of it

92
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:24,340
you can set whatever time delay

93
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:26,050
you want if you're like a hot tub

94
00:02:26,189 --> 00:02:27,830
company you probably have a very

95
00:02:28,169 --> 00:02:29,810
long time period between purchases

96
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:31,159
so you could set this to like a

97
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:34,000
year um but um for stuff like

98
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:36,050
supplements or something it might

99
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:38,000
be helpful to do like 120 day win

100
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,159
back uh flow um because usually

101
00:02:40,259 --> 00:02:40,460
the

102
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:42,289
purchase periods are a lot shorter

103
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:44,340
so email one which is going to be

104
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,830
let's say 120 days um it's

105
00:02:47,909 --> 00:02:48,800
been a while this email is purely

106
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,669
for client experience let them

107
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:50,639
know we're thinking about

108
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:51,909
them we want to give them the

109
00:02:51,909 --> 00:02:53,289
sense that we're not just a big

110
00:02:53,289 --> 00:02:54,900
company and this goes a long ways

111
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:55,020
being

112
00:02:55,169 --> 00:02:56,689
able to customize things like this

113
00:02:56,689 --> 00:02:58,000
i don't know why that's opening

114
00:02:58,129 --> 00:02:59,379
but it goes a very long ways

115
00:02:59,449 --> 00:03:01,789
so just keep it simple so the

116
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:05,099
purpose make them feel special and

117
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:07,680
like they're missed for a repeat

118
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,379
purchase so our subject lines are

119
00:03:09,379 --> 00:03:11,069
just addressing that saying it's

120
00:03:11,069 --> 00:03:12,479

await something like that and so

124
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:17,400

125
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,060

releasing new products something

137
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:34,919
like that or you could do like

138
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:36,120
some social proof in this section

139
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:36,280
if

140
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:37,620
you want uh whatever you want to

141
00:03:37,659 --> 00:03:38,849
do and then you can have some

142
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:40,310
products here so this is a cool

143
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:40,500
little

144
00:03:40,569 --> 00:03:42,169
product section you just say shop

something like that and this is

147
00:03:45,789 --> 00:03:46,719
going to work really well just for

148
00:03:46,979 --> 00:03:47,550
customer experience it usually

149
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:48,629
gets pretty good engagement

150
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,139
and then if you want to run a

151
00:03:50,139 --> 00:03:51,879
discount for win back people to

152
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:53,460
try to get them back after a

153
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:53,490
certain

154
00:03:53,669 --> 00:03:54,789
amount of time you can set

155
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,340
whatever time delay you want but

156
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,939
email to discount open even if you

157
00:03:57,939 --> 00:03:58,199
ran

158
00:03:58,270 --> 00:03:59,400
sales since customers last

159
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:00,789
purchase they may have just been

160
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:02,199
at the wrong time and then adding

161
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:02,289
a

162
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:03,629
discount that's specific to the

163
00:04:03,629 --> 00:04:05,009
customer makes it clear that we're

164
00:04:05,009 --> 00:04:06,939
trying to get them back and that

165
00:04:07,009 --> 00:04:08,610
could get them over the edge it's

166
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,300
a custom discount it's not there

167
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:12,250
it's not like a generic spring 20

168
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:12,740
for

169
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:14,430
like a spring sale type of thing

170
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:16,199
um so some winning subject lines

171
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:17,860

i just did miss you a 10 um what i

180
00:04:31,709 --> 00:04:33,519
would recommend for a lot of the

181
00:04:33,589 --> 00:04:35,350
discount codes is use one that

182
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:37,339
looks random so you can say like

183
00:04:37,339 --> 00:04:39,259
miss you a dash seven x seven x

184
00:04:39,259 --> 00:04:40,040
four z

185
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:41,399
and then have that as a static

186
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:42,720
code in shopify but it looks

187
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,560
custom to the person they can have

188
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:44,699
just

189
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,160
a product image or lifestyle image

190
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,360
and then just a couple of your

be handled by campaigns so don't

242
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:58,689
overthink this like your big your

243
00:05:58,689 --> 00:05:59,779
sales that you're running for

244
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:01,839
memorial day labor day a lot of

245
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:02,579
that is going to get

246
00:06:02,689 --> 00:06:04,079
people so uh don't try to get too

247
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:05,519
crazy with this because you'll

248
00:06:05,649 --> 00:06:07,279
just spend a lot of time for flow

249
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:08,810
that not a lot of people will

250
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:10,480
convert from so that is the win

251
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,089
back flow and yeah there we go

252
00:06:12,269 --> 00:06:16,240
okay last but of course not least

253
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:19,569
we have the win back flow which is

254
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,480
going to do kind of how it

255
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:23,180
sounds win people back it's very

256
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,910
straightforward we just want to

257
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:26,790
encourage people to make another

258
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:28,430
purchase um these are past

259
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,529
customers and we want them to come

260
00:06:30,529 --> 00:06:32,540
back so do not overthink this flow

261
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:33,740
um the thing is like your

262
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,430
customers are still receiving your

263
00:06:35,569 --> 00:06:37,139
campaign emails they're still

264
00:06:37,209 --> 00:06:38,670
uh receiving like your sales and

265
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,279
whatever else you're blasting to

266
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:41,939
your list and if you're like us

267
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:43,870
and you have an optimized email um

268
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:45,769
channel you're sending three to

269
00:06:45,769 --> 00:06:47,579
four email campaigns a week so

270
00:06:47,649 --> 00:06:49,230
somebody made a purchase three

271
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:51,060
four months ago and you're sending

272
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,800
three to four email campaigns a

273
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:52,889
week

274
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:54,720
that's going to handle a lot of

275
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,670
your repeat purchases 99 of your

276
00:06:56,689 --> 00:06:57,990
attention and repeat purchases

277
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:58,500
will come

278
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:00,199
from your campaigns so for this

279
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:01,779
reason we keep the win back flow

280
00:07:01,779 --> 00:07:03,420
nice and simple and it's more for

281
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:03,589
like

282
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:04,939
customer experience and to at

283
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:06,240
least automate a part of the

284
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,620
customer journey uh just to be

285
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:08,220
like hey we

286
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:09,410
noticed you haven't bought in a

287
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,610
while it's you don't really get

288
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:11,750
too many sales i haven't seen a

289
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:11,980
win

290
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:13,370
back flow like generate crazy

291
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:14,819
money for every brand that i've

292
00:07:14,819 --> 00:07:16,350
looked in and even like me trying

293
00:07:16,449 --> 00:07:16,639
to like

294
00:07:16,709 --> 00:07:17,850
optimize the heck out of it it's

295
00:07:17,899 --> 00:07:18,910
just not how it works a lot of

296
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:20,339
people will just convert from your

297
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:21,699
campaigns so it's more for the

298
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,209
customer experience um so let's

299
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:24,180
break down the flow

300
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,430
really simple just three emails

301
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:26,569
the trigger we're just doing a

302
00:07:26,569 --> 00:07:28,000
placed order trigger then we're

303
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,139
adding

304
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:29,600
a filter made a purchase zero

305
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,029
times to start in this flow then

306
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:33,449
we have a 90 to 120 day time delay

307
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:34,040
so

308
00:07:34,149 --> 00:07:35,910
you could do that um what you

309
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,389
could also do is you could have a

310
00:07:38,389 --> 00:07:40,860
segment based trigger so what you

311
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:41,120
do

312
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,970
is you create a segment inside of

313
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:44,399
klaviyo and what you say is

314
00:07:44,449 --> 00:07:47,399
somebody placed an order um is at

315
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:48,019
least is

316
00:07:48,209 --> 00:07:50,279
90 days ago or is at least is

317
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:52,850
after 90 days and so then anytime

318
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:55,500
somebody enters that flow you or

319
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:55,680
anybody

320
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:56,970
enters that segment you have a

321
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,129
flow set up so you create a flow

322
00:07:58,269 --> 00:07:59,680
and then you have the trigger beat

323
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,350
somebody joins a segment and then

324
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:02,860
you set that as the segment for

325
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:04,860
the person's last purchase was 90

326
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:04,990
days

327
00:08:05,149 --> 00:08:07,019
ago um so that's my ideal way of

328
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:09,430
doing it but for simplicity's sake

329
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:12,540
i just did this so with email one

330
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:14,300
email two email three email one

331
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,899
just a quick it's been a while

332
00:08:15,899 --> 00:08:17,759
remind them of the brand encourage

333
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:18,750
them to come back for another

334
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:19,750
purchase just be like hey it's

335
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:20,819
been a while since your last

336
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:21,310
purchase we

337
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:22,899
miss you yada yada yada more for

338
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:24,569
customer experience and then we

339
00:08:24,569 --> 00:08:26,170
wait seven days and then this is

340
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:26,399
where

341
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:28,139
we can introduce a discount make

342
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:29,819
them feel special with a unique

343
00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:31,420
discount um to try to get them

344
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:31,709
back

345
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:32,940
wait seven days and then you can

346
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,129
do a text-based last chance from

347
00:08:34,269 --> 00:08:35,809
the founder and reminding them of

348
00:08:35,889 --> 00:08:37,590
it you can set whatever time delay

349
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:39,220
you want if you're like a hot tub

350
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:41,538
company you probably have a very

351
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:43,250
long time period between purchases

352
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:44,600
so you could set this to like a

353
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,440
year um but um for stuff like

354
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:49,490
supplements or something it might

355
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,980
be helpful to do like 120 day win

356
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,559
back uh flow um because usually

357
00:08:53,789 --> 00:08:55,899
the purchase periods are a lot

358
00:08:55,899 --> 00:08:58,000
shorter so email one which is

359
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,759
going to be let's say 120 days um

360
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:01,259
it's

361
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:02,220
been a while this email is purely

362
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,090
for client experience let them

363
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:04,480
know we're thinking about them we

364
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:04,700
want to

365
00:09:04,769 --> 00:09:06,190
give them the sense that we're not

366
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:07,610
just a big company and this goes a

367
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:08,730
long ways being able to

368
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:10,379
customize things like this i don't

369
00:09:10,379 --> 00:09:11,690
know why that's opening but it

370
00:09:11,809 --> 00:09:12,799
goes a very long ways

371
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:15,210
so just keep it simple so the

372
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:18,519
purpose make them feel special and

373
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:21,110
like they're missed for a repeat

374
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:22,789
purchase so our subject lines are

375
00:09:22,789 --> 00:09:24,490
just addressing that saying it's

376
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:25,919
been a while hey how's it been

377
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:27,440
let's catch up we miss you it's a

378
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,809
time for restock new memories

looks random so you can say like

438
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:54,299
missya dash 7x7x4z and then have

439
00:10:54,389 --> 00:10:55,679
that as a static code in shopify

440
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,110
but it looks custom to the person

441
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:58,340

00:10:58,409 --> 00:10:59,870
