1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,189
Okay, let's talk about the site

2
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:02,660
abandoned flow, probably one of my

3
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:04,200
favorite flows because not a lot

4
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,540
of people have it and it is very,

5
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:06,519
very underrated.

6
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,099
So, let's talk about it briefly.

7
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:10,560
So, the purpose, this is going to

8
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:11,970
be sent to people who visited your

9
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:13,320
site but they didn't browse any of

10
00:00:13,369 --> 00:00:14,630
your products or go any further

11
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:15,619
down the funnel.

12
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:17,170
Now, there are two reasons that

13
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:18,449
people will enter this flow

14
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:20,000
because they go to the website but

15
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:21,510
they don't go any farther, they

16
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:22,769
don't look at any products.

17
00:00:23,059 --> 00:00:24,730
So, two reasons, they didn't find

18
00:00:24,789 --> 00:00:26,329
a product that they liked or two,

19
00:00:26,329 --> 00:00:28,059
they got distracted while browsing

20
00:00:28,059 --> 00:00:28,800
your site.

21
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,149
Those are literally the only two

22
00:00:30,149 --> 00:00:30,660
options.

23
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:31,789
They didn't find something they

24
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:32,840
like enough to click onto it or

25
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:33,780
they got distracted.

26
00:00:33,799 --> 00:00:35,280
So, either way, we want to be sure

27
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,750
that we remind them and then nudge

28
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:38,299
them to keep browsing, to find a

29
00:00:38,299 --> 00:00:39,609
product that they like or to go

30
00:00:39,609 --> 00:00:40,890
back to our site in case they got

31
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:41,640
distracted.

32
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,950
So, this is the flow, just one

33
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:44,679
email.

34
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,090
This is the trigger active on site

35
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:47,560
and these are all the filters.

36
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:48,960
So, essentially, any further down

37
00:00:48,969 --> 00:00:50,179
the funnel, we need to make sure

38
00:00:50,179 --> 00:00:51,429
that they've done that zero times

39
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:52,679
since starting this flow.

40
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,579
So, visit product zero times, add

41
00:00:54,579 --> 00:00:56,020
to cart zero times, start at

42
00:00:56,149 --> 00:00:57,929
checkout zero times, place order

43
00:00:57,969 --> 00:00:59,189
zero times because if somebody

44
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,420
goes down to that point, like say

45
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,619
they go to checkout and then they

46
00:01:02,909 --> 00:01:04,120
abandon, we want them to receive

47
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:05,299
the checkout abandoned flow.

48
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:06,629
Not the site abandoned, browse

49
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:07,900
abandoned, cart abandoned, and

50
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:08,799
checkout abandoned.

51
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:10,060
We only want them to receive this.

52
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:11,750
So, the last one, someone's banned

53
00:01:11,849 --> 00:01:13,290
this flow zero times in the past

54
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:15,060
30 days just because some people

55
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,609
will go to your site like multiple

56
00:01:16,939 --> 00:01:17,719
times in one week.

57
00:01:17,859 --> 00:01:19,379
So, we just want to wait two to

58
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:20,950
four hours is typically what I

59
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:21,819
recommend.

60
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,260
Any earlier, I don't really like

61
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:24,939
that.

62
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:26,459
Just because somebody didn't find

63
00:01:26,459 --> 00:01:27,909
a product they like, we just want

64
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,290
to get them with like a fresh mind

65
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:30,409
because if we send this to

66
00:01:30,409 --> 00:01:31,980
somebody like 30 minutes after

67
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:33,269
they just browsed the site and

68
00:01:33,269 --> 00:01:35,069
they didn't find a product, that's

69
00:01:35,129 --> 00:01:36,340
a little bit too early.

70
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:37,469
We want to get them with a fresh

71
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:38,760
mind where it's like, eh, I'll

72
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,049
take another look rather than we

73
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:41,579
send it 15 minutes after they left

74
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:42,170
the site.

75
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:42,930
They're going to be like, I

76
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:43,739
literally just looked and didn't

77
00:01:43,739 --> 00:01:44,239
find anything.

78
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:45,689
So, two to four hours, just need

79
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:46,739
some help, remind them to keep

80
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:47,829
shopping, and then show some of

81
00:01:47,829 --> 00:01:48,719
your best sellers.

82
00:01:48,739 --> 00:01:50,930
So, this is just the simple email.

83
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:52,480
Email one, just need some help.

84
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,980
So, we don't want to waste any

85
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:54,939
time with this.

86
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:56,079
No need for any more than one

87
00:01:56,109 --> 00:01:57,450
email because this user is still

88
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:58,540
going to be receiving your

89
00:01:58,579 --> 00:01:59,930
campaigns, which you should be

90
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:01,129
sending three to four times a

91
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:01,500
week.

92
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:02,700
Make sure you are.

93
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,000
But, essentially, we just want to

94
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,079
get them back on the site.

95
00:02:05,099 --> 00:02:06,400
So, simply remind them to come

96
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,760
back, show them more products to

97
00:02:07,859 --> 00:02:08,669
keep browsing.

98
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:09,270
That's it.

99
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:11,120
So, purpose, get them back on the

100
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:11,610
site.

101
00:02:11,669 --> 00:02:13,860
Content, address their interest.

102
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:15,430
So, you want to tell them straight

103
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:16,539
up, like you were on our site.

104
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,870
You want to show them best sellers

105
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:19,360
and then offer further browsing.

106
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:20,870
So, here's some subject line

107
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:21,340
ideas.

108
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:22,300
Just like, need some help.

109
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:23,409
Did you find something you like?

110
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:24,300
Let us point you in the right

111
00:02:24,389 --> 00:02:24,840
direction.

112
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,000
We're waiting for you.

113
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:27,000
Here's what you missed.

114
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:27,879
Did you check these out?

115
00:02:27,979 --> 00:02:29,870
And then, just a super simple

116
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:30,639
outline.

117
00:02:30,699 --> 00:02:31,400
Lost in choices.

118
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:32,680
Let us point you in the right

119
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,360
direction.

120
00:02:33,379 --> 00:02:35,280
So, then you just take them to

121
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,099
your best sellers page and then

122
00:02:37,099 --> 00:02:38,340
you just list some best sellers

123
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,340
here and then shop all.

124
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,680
That's literally all you need.

125
00:02:40,699 --> 00:02:41,909
The subject line will pique their

126
00:02:41,909 --> 00:02:42,479
attention.

127
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,360
They might just be like, eh, you

128
00:02:43,449 --> 00:02:43,780
know what?

129
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,560
I'll keep browsing.

130
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:45,590
And then, they'll click your

131
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:46,020
button.

132
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:47,379
So, it's literally that simple.

133
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,259
That's all you need for the

134
00:02:48,349 --> 00:02:49,360
website abandoned flow.

135
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,919
And this is going to pick up some

136
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:52,530
extra revenue and re-engage some

137
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:54,340
people who maybe got distracted or

138
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,180
didn't find a product that they

139
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:55,460
like.

140
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:55,639
Okay.
