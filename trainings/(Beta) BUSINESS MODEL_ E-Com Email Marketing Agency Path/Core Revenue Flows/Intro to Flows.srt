1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,220
Okay, email marketing flows.

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:03,980
This is the intro to flows.

3
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:05,440
This is a big part of your email

4
00:00:05,559 --> 00:00:07,230
strategy, but let us get into it.

5
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:08,619
So when we're looking at the

6
00:00:08,619 --> 00:00:10,679
funnel, this is the flows that

7
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:11,869
we're talking about right down

8
00:00:11,949 --> 00:00:12,240
here.

9
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:13,560
Of course, we have the signups,

10
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,199
website, and then signup

11
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,390
forms to get people onto the email

12
00:00:16,469 --> 00:00:16,760
list.

13
00:00:16,769 --> 00:00:17,920
We have two types of emails that

14
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:18,719
we're sending.

15
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:19,100
We have

16
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:20,660
flow emails, and then we have

17
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:21,410
campaigns.

18
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:23,039
And what we're talking about is

19
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:23,539
flows.

20
00:00:23,539 --> 00:00:24,379
So let's talk about

21
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:25,989
flows, automated emails that get

22
00:00:25,989 --> 00:00:27,440
sent to the customer after they

23
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,989
complete a specified action.

24
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:30,050
These are automated.

25
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:31,320
You set them up, you turn them

26
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,840
live, and then they're going to

27
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:33,030
fire

28
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,579
once a customer does a specific

29
00:00:34,579 --> 00:00:34,960
action.

30
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:36,450
Things like joining the email

31
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:38,020
list, abandoning an item

32
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:39,390
that they added to cart, or making

33
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:40,829
a purchase, something like that.

34
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:41,960
That's going to fire some

35
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:43,280
follow-up emails for them.

36
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,710
So flows allow us to automate the

37
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:46,340
customer journey and send high

38
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:47,780
converting reminders, cross-sales,

39
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:48,929
and relevant information to the

40
00:00:48,929 --> 00:00:50,119
customer, depending on where

41
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:50,729
they are.

42
00:00:50,869 --> 00:00:53,149
So they should make up around 50%

43
00:00:53,149 --> 00:00:55,070
of your total email revenue.

44
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:56,719
With around 50% coming

45
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,880
from campaigns, you can do 60%,

46
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,810
40%, 40%, 60%.

47
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:02,579
Generally, you want to be within

48
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:02,859
that range.

49
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:04,989
If you're only generating like 10%

50
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:06,310
of your email revenue from flows,

51
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:08,000
that tells you you have

52
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,079
a lot of extra revenue that you

53
00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:09,590
can pick up.

54
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:10,540
That tells you that you can

55
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:11,280
automate more of

56
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:12,109
your revenue, because who doesn't

57
00:01:12,109 --> 00:01:12,859
like automated revenue?

58
00:01:12,859 --> 00:01:14,829
So you can see for this example

59
00:01:14,859 --> 00:01:14,859
brand,

60
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:18,079
every 30 days, $237,000 is coming

61
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:19,340
in automatically.

62
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:21,000
And that's just on flows.

63
00:01:21,109 --> 00:01:22,189
So again, why use flows?

64
00:01:22,269 --> 00:01:23,269
Automated revenue.

65
00:01:23,269 --> 00:01:24,519
Who doesn't like automated

66
00:01:24,519 --> 00:01:25,090
revenue?

67
00:01:25,129 --> 00:01:26,189
It takes pressure

68
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:27,140
off your campaigns.

69
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:28,530
So if you have really good flows

70
00:01:28,579 --> 00:01:30,709
set up that are always firing, say

71
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:31,340
you only send

72
00:01:31,459 --> 00:01:32,530
one campaign to your email list on

73
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:33,670
a given week, when you usually

74
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:34,939
send like three, because like

75
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:35,219
somebody

76
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:36,219
was sick on your team, you're

77
00:01:36,219 --> 00:01:37,180
still going to be generating

78
00:01:37,189 --> 00:01:38,340
revenue, because you have the

79
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:38,569
flows

80
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:39,680
going on in the background.

81
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:41,709
Three, it's going to convert your

82
00:01:41,709 --> 00:01:43,180
high intent traffic.

83
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:44,620
So rather than having people who

84
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:45,019
abandon

85
00:01:45,129 --> 00:01:46,439
an item in their cart, and then

86
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:48,019
they would otherwise just leave,

87
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:49,280
just letting them leave,

88
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:50,250
we can send high converting

89
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:51,500
emails, because they're so warm,

90
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,629
and we can get more revenue.

91
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,120
Kind of bouncing off on top of

92
00:01:54,189 --> 00:01:56,180
that, abandonment flows, recover

93
00:01:56,329 --> 00:01:57,900
lost sales that you would have

94
00:01:58,019 --> 00:01:58,680
otherwise lost.

95
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,150
Somebody added an item to their

96
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:01,790
cart, and then their kid spilled a

97
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:02,420
glass of milk,

98
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:03,280
they had to go clean it up, and

99
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,170
they forgot what they were doing

100
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:05,379
before, we send an email

101
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:06,450
to remind them, they finished the

102
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:06,739
sale.

103
00:02:06,739 --> 00:02:08,639
And then a personalized customer,

104
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:09,879
personalized the

105
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,879
customer experience.

106
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:12,139
So if you're telling somebody,

107
00:02:12,139 --> 00:02:13,400
hey, you bought this item, you

108
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,139
would also like

109
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:15,330
this item, and we automate that,

110
00:02:15,419 --> 00:02:16,180
then people are going to

111
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:16,889
appreciate that.

112
00:02:16,889 --> 00:02:17,840
Part of their journey,

113
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,849
they're in the welcome flow.

114
00:02:18,849 --> 00:02:19,789
They just found out about our

115
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:20,090
brand.

116
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:21,180
We're giving them information,

117
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,590
being like, hey, thank you so much

118
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:23,550
for being a part of like our

119
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,039
community, our family, yada,

120
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:25,650
yada, yada.

121
00:02:25,789 --> 00:02:27,370
Personalizes it, makes people feel

122
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:28,020
special.

123
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,520
So that's the other thing.

124
00:02:30,379 --> 00:02:31,379
And so these are the main flows

125
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:32,360
that we have set up here.

126
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,689
We have like the welcome flow.

127
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:34,240
So

128
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,560
somebody joins the list.

129
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,099
We have the abandonment flows,

130
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:38,580
which we'll talk about here in a

131
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:39,199
second.

132
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:40,979
Somebody somehow abandons, they

133
00:02:40,979 --> 00:02:42,520
were in a shopping, they were

134
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,080
doing a shopping activity,

135
00:02:44,219 --> 00:02:44,939
and then they leave.

136
00:02:44,939 --> 00:02:46,310
These are your abandonment flows.

137
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:47,069
And then we have like

138
00:02:47,069 --> 00:02:48,039
post-purchase flows,

139
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:49,229
which you can add a lot more, but

140
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:50,509
these are just like the base ones

141
00:02:50,509 --> 00:02:51,460
that I'd recommend.

142
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:52,000
And so

143
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,330
these are the flows.

144
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:55,289
Now let's break down like each one

145
00:02:55,289 --> 00:02:57,210
of them, what the Klaviyo trigger

146
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:57,490
is,

147
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:58,349
and what the filter is.

148
00:02:58,349 --> 00:02:59,349
And again, we'll be talking a

149
00:02:59,469 --> 00:03:00,219
little bit more in depth

150
00:03:00,379 --> 00:03:02,020
here on these, each one of these.

151
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,680
So we have the welcome flow, which

152
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,229
is the trigger,

153
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,430
somebody joins your list.

154
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,319
Filter, somebody makes a purchase.

155
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:08,849
So essentially a filter is before

156
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,650
anybody receives any further email

157
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:12,340
in your flow, they're going to be,

158
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,599
Klaviyo is going to run them

159
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:15,400
through this filter and make sure

160
00:03:15,569 --> 00:03:17,439
that they don't, they don't check

161
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:18,750
any of these boxes.

162
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:19,120
They haven't

163
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,050
done any of these things.

164
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:21,270
So Klaviyo filter, someone makes a

165
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:21,719
purchase.

166
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:22,490
So if somebody makes

167
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,110
a purchase, we want them to be

168
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:24,750
removed.

169
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,590
Same thing, same sort of thing for

170
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:27,639
site abandoned,

171
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:28,770
browse abandoned, cart abandoned,

172
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:29,639
and checkout abandoned.

173
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:30,520
These are all the abandonment

174
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:30,919
flows.

175
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:32,659
And again, I'll be showing and

176
00:03:32,659 --> 00:03:34,139
going over this in a bit.

177
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:36,180
So this is just like everything in

178
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:36,439
a table

179
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,520
view and then post-purchase and

180
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,449
win back, somebody makes a

181
00:03:38,449 --> 00:03:39,560
purchase, win back, somebody

182
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:39,979
hasn't purchased

183
00:03:40,219 --> 00:03:41,569
in 60 plus days and we want them

184
00:03:41,569 --> 00:03:42,280
to come back.

185
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,219
So that's a brief intro on flows

186
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:45,229
and let's get into

187
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,419
the specifics.
