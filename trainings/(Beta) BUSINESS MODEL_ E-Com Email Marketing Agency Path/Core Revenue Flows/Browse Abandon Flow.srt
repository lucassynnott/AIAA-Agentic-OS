1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,149
Browse abandon flow let us get

2
00:00:02,149 --> 00:00:04,459
into it moving right along so the

3
00:00:04,469 --> 00:00:06,320
purpose so this flow the

4
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:07,660
browse band and flow is going to

5
00:00:07,669 --> 00:00:09,109
fire when somebody views a product

6
00:00:09,109 --> 00:00:09,849
but they don't add

7
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,300
anything to cart they don't go to

8
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:12,759
checkout they don't do any of that

9
00:00:12,759 --> 00:00:14,140
and they don't end up buying

10
00:00:14,199 --> 00:00:15,820
so that's the lowest they get in

11
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,570
the funnel is they view an actual

12
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:19,120
product page they clicked

13
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:20,820
on a product they looked at it saw

14
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,410
the price all that good stuff so

15
00:00:22,469 --> 00:00:24,019
now there are a number of

16
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:26,160
possible reasons why somebody left

17
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,870
behind but in most cases it's

18
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:29,449
because they weren't fully

19
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:30,870
bought in on the brand or the

20
00:00:31,059 --> 00:00:32,509
product that's the most common and

21
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:34,340
so our purpose of this flow is to

22
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:35,950
get someone farther down the

23
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:37,750
funnel go from viewing a product

24
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:39,280
to adding it to cart going to

25
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:39,640
check out

26
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,719
purchasing so another thing is

27
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:43,560
just to kind of get them to go

28
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,740
back to that item it might be that

29
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:46,020
item

30
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,420
that they want maybe they didn't

31
00:00:47,479 --> 00:00:48,770
like that item so we also want to

32
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:50,280
show them different products in

33
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,049
their in our store to try to get

34
00:00:52,049 --> 00:00:53,890
them like maybe they like those

35
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:55,710
ones more so at the end of the day

36
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,030
we want them to get we want them

37
00:00:57,049 --> 00:00:58,469
to view their product and we also

38
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:00,000
want them to go back to browsing

39
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,090
the store to maybe finding one

40
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:03,969
that they like more so let us

41
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:06,260
break down the flow simple five

42
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:06,750
emails

43
00:01:06,819 --> 00:01:08,900
here so this is the trigger view

44
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:11,290
to product filters someone adds to

45
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:13,680
cart zero times started checkout

46
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:13,980
zero

47
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,430
times placed order zero times they

48
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,730
haven't been in this flow in the

49
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:18,349
last 30 days so that they're not

50
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:19,890
getting like spammed a ton they're

51
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:21,269
getting the same thing over and

52
00:01:21,269 --> 00:01:22,730
over again so typically from the

53
00:01:22,819 --> 00:01:23,939
beginning i like to wait 45

54
00:01:24,069 --> 00:01:25,180
minutes but again this is just

55
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:27,000
like a starting point we've seen

56
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,819
some stores

57
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:30,000
have like a four hour time delay

58
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:32,400
be the best typically the higher

59
00:01:32,489 --> 00:01:34,200
the aov the longer you want

60
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,079
your time delay to be uh whoa that

61
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:37,909
rhymed um but typically that's

62
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,629
what you want to do and so for

63
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:41,840
typically we find like 45 minutes

64
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:43,909
to an hour two hours is typically

65
00:01:43,909 --> 00:01:45,840
the best so after that time period

66
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:45,959
we

67
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:47,750
just want to send a simple simple

68
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:49,489
reminder just reminding them of

69
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:51,219
the product and show the dynamic

70
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,489
abandoned content that's literally

71
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:53,560
it because maybe they just got

72
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,549
distracted while viewing

73
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,030
and it's just like a nice subtle

74
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:57,450
reminder to go back and shop on

75
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:58,980
the store so that's all we need

76
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,409
for this first email wait one to

77
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:01,670
two days brand info and risk

78
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:03,950
reversals um try to get that trust

79
00:02:03,989 --> 00:02:04,409
email

80
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,650
three testimonials trust again and

81
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:08,669
then we enter a discount for these

82
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:10,639
last two so let's go down into

83
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:12,909
each email in a breakdown of each

84
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,180
one so email one sometimes all we

85
00:02:15,189 --> 00:02:17,080
need to get them to get them to

86
00:02:17,139 --> 00:02:17,960
convert it's just a simple

87
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,960
reminder they could have just

88
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,789
gotten distracted um or maybe they

89
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:21,199
were on the

90
00:02:21,259 --> 00:02:22,379
edge of i adding to cart but

91
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,750
they're just waiting for a sign

92
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:25,169
from the universe to have them

93
00:02:25,189 --> 00:02:25,569
pull the

94
00:02:25,659 --> 00:02:27,099
trigger i know sometimes like a

95
00:02:27,099 --> 00:02:28,530
lot of people they just like to

96
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:29,800
shop around they they like

97
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,560

98
00:02:30,659 --> 00:02:31,939

they shouldn't get it and they're

101
00:02:34,659 --> 00:02:34,800
just

102
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,270
waiting for a sign from the

103
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,979
universe to help them justify

104
00:02:37,979 --> 00:02:39,870
making the purchase and sending a

105
00:02:39,969 --> 00:02:40,590

clavio dynamic abandoned product

124
00:03:06,509 --> 00:03:08,099
section which is literally just

125
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:09,830
whatever clavio gives you as a

126
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:10,180
base

127
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,860
for that flow just use that and

128
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,240
then we just have a couple

129
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,240
different images uh just lifestyle

130
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:15,610
images

131
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,349
to bring it to life because it is

132
00:03:17,349 --> 00:03:19,110
very plain we want this to be very

133
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:21,050
plain because that's what converts

134
00:03:21,139 --> 00:03:22,400
the best we don't want it we just

135
00:03:22,539 --> 00:03:23,740
want to show them the item that

136
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,400
they left behind and then if

137
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:25,580
people

138
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:27,400
want to shop other items then we

139
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,289
have these buttons in the footer

140
00:03:29,289 --> 00:03:31,009
as always so simple info right

141
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:31,419
there

142
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:32,689
simple reminder so now we want to

143
00:03:32,689 --> 00:03:33,870
talk about some brand info and

144
00:03:33,889 --> 00:03:34,909
risk reversals so

145
00:03:34,979 --> 00:03:36,400
customer didn't buy just looking

146
00:03:36,409 --> 00:03:37,669
at the item could be that they

147
00:03:37,669 --> 00:03:38,919
just don't trust you enough

148
00:03:38,979 --> 00:03:40,270
and so risk reversals in any form

149
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:41,580
of social proof can help to get

150
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:42,409
them over the edge

151
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,060
um so risk reversals are anything

152
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,729
that remove risk for the customer

153
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,620
um in like their purchase so

154
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:49,449
things like shipping info

155
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,879
guarantees like refund guarantees

156
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:52,490
um

157
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:54,719
uh refund information social proof

158
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,509
all this it's really good to

159
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:57,969
include in this email

160
00:03:58,039 --> 00:03:59,150
email um even then maybe the

161
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:00,620
product they browsed isn't the one

162
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:02,139

163
00:04:02,139 --> 00:04:02,310

00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,379
to introduce a little bit more

210
00:05:08,389 --> 00:05:09,980
social proof and then email three

211
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:10,110
we're

212
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:11,459
going a little bit harder on

213
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,910
social proof so testimonials

214
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:14,459
that's what we're doing for this

215
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:15,910
email so the customer still may

216
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:17,230
not trust us so we're going to

217
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:18,379
nudge them even more and

218
00:05:18,379 --> 00:05:19,019
testimonials

219
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:20,319
are the best way to get people to

220
00:05:20,329 --> 00:05:21,569
cross the edge and purchase as

221
00:05:21,569 --> 00:05:23,500
long as you pick good testimonials

222
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,769
um so find a few good ones that

223
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:26,449
overcome objections in the process

224
00:05:26,449 --> 00:05:27,339
and it's just like

225
00:05:27,389 --> 00:05:29,000
i like this shirt no if i was gym

226
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,810
shark i wouldn't just want i like

227
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:32,220
the shirt i would like

228
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:33,540
one to talk about like the price

229
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,220
and the quality and like this one

230
00:05:35,259 --> 00:05:36,540
this is so worth the price

231
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,860
because this reason this reason

232
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,240
this reason um those are going to

233
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,620
be a lot more effective reviews

234
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,389
rather than just nice shirt um so

235
00:05:42,389 --> 00:05:43,680
purpose build trust and

236
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,660
credibility um so we just want the

237
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,360
testimonials and abandoned content

238
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,660
again very simple so winning

239
00:05:48,699 --> 00:05:50,220
subject line ideas we can see we

240
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:50,540
see these

241
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,100
like all emoji subject lines work

242
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,540
pretty well sometimes um so you

243
00:05:53,579 --> 00:05:54,910
could say you could do something

244
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:55,339
like that

245
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:57,029
uh the people have spoken your

246
00:05:57,029 --> 00:05:58,910
item is a fan favorite here's what

247
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:00,540
others are saying customer

248
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:00,779
approved

249
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:02,370
anything like this you can add an

250
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,569
emoji to any one of these um and

251
00:06:03,649 --> 00:06:04,860
then you could have a subject line

252
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,329
where it's literally just like the

253
00:06:06,329 --> 00:06:07,629
testimonial and that's just the

254
00:06:07,689 --> 00:06:09,180
whole subject line uh we see that

255
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,790
work well as well so you can see

256
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:12,600
here um we just have a testimonial

257
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,220
right at the top of the email

258
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:15,639
just so someone can immediately

259
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,180
see it the dynamic product section

260
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,699
and then a few more testimonials

261
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:19,970
and a little bit more of a fun

262
00:06:20,009 --> 00:06:21,589
layout and then shop all products

263
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:23,019
that's all you really need for

264
00:06:23,019 --> 00:06:23,180
this

265
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,519
email we go with that one now this

266
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:27,850
is optional you can do discounts

267
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:29,670
so a quick discount at the end of

268
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,399
the flow for anybody who hasn't

269
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:33,009

270
00:06:33,009 --> 00:06:34,620
well it's optional of course

271
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,939
uh but the customer at this point

272
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:37,389
they have all the necessary social

273
00:06:37,449 --> 00:06:38,779

277
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:43,579
