42
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:21,689
for johnnyives by the way

43
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,370
like his his story is actually

44
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:27,219

45
00:01:27,219 --> 00:01:29,840

because no it's okay i love this

47
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:33,870
shit bro johnnyives is like a pure

48
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:35,959
creative right so when he was

49
00:01:36,219 --> 00:01:37,430
early on in his career he was

50
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,510
getting recruited by microsoft and

51
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:42,900
apple and pretty much the deciding

52
00:01:42,939 --> 00:01:45,459
factor was that microsoft denied

53
00:01:45,459 --> 00:01:47,739
his request to have a shower in

54
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:50,239
his office and apple steve jobs

55
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:50,599
said

56
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,219
he could have it and the reason he

57
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:53,780
wanted a shower in his office is

58
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,719
because he'd get his ideas in the

59
00:01:56,859 --> 00:01:59,629
shower so steve jobs was like i

60
00:01:59,629 --> 00:02:01,900
get it and i i love that and so

61
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:04,079

00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,170
we're gonna put a shower in your

63
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:07,689
office and so yeah i fucking love

64
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:10,139

general so again clod chat gpt uh

347
00:10:33,539 --> 00:10:35,389
probably most likely clod to have

348
00:10:35,389 --> 00:10:37,080
made have this happen and then

349
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,779
poppy is basically the tool that

350
00:10:38,779 --> 00:10:39,500
we use

351
00:10:39,539 --> 00:10:41,240
uh that we built about a year ago

352
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,850
and the reason we built it and

353
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,289
this is i kind of want to give you

354
00:10:44,289 --> 00:10:44,299

355
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,549
a little bit of background is

00:10:46,549 --> 00:10:49,169
because i don't know about you but

357
00:10:49,169 --> 00:10:51,500
i hate using chat gpt and i hate

358
00:10:51,539 --> 00:10:53,460
using clod the reason why it feels

359
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:55,779
like 1980s it feels like using

360
00:10:55,779 --> 00:10:57,580

it is and how easy it is to use

365
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:07,009
okay um on the side of poppy we

366
00:11:07,009 --> 00:11:09,179
built it because we want to make

367
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:10,710
it very easy to create things like

368
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:12,039
in chat gpt you throw different

369
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:13,529
things on the board or you throw

370
00:11:13,529 --> 00:11:13,590
the

371
00:11:13,779 --> 00:11:14,990
thing into the chat and it's like

372
00:11:15,429 --> 00:11:16,509
just a chat back and forth you

373
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,059
don't know when where any of your

374
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,730
content is you don't know where

375
00:11:19,769 --> 00:11:21,519

an ass ass to one million a month

439
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:18,059
dude i got a epic idea what's up

440
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,179
bro i think we should take our

441
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:21,710
whole thing to thailand bro bro

442
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:24,299
that would be sick right guess

443
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,279
what we did it

444
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:27,960
we literally packed up the whole

445
00:13:28,409 --> 00:13:29,580
poppy team and moved them to this

446
00:13:29,799 --> 00:13:31,120
ridiculous mansion in thailand

447
00:13:31,539 --> 00:13:32,750
literally this is me coding on the

448
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,360
pool like what the but anyways

449
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,580
right now we're at two hundred

450
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:37,340
thousand dollars this month and we

451
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:39,019
still got two weeks left and today

452
00:13:39,019 --> 00:13:40,700
we got this weird not found

453
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,250
error that's driving us insane at

454
00:13:42,409 --> 00:13:43,799
first we thought it was just a few

455
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:45,899
users but now we got like 22 users

456
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:47,129
hitting us up about it so after

457
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:49,240
digging through the code for hours

458
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,700
coppy finally figured out

459
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:52,710
we found that it might be this

460
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:55,049
barometrics thing we just added

461
00:13:55,139 --> 00:13:56,769
turns out barometrics was messing

462
00:13:56,809 --> 00:13:58,690
with our dom components literally

463
00:13:58,809 --> 00:13:59,340
removing

464
00:13:59,379 --> 00:14:00,730
shit it wasn't supposed to we

465
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:02,460
removed that part and boom problem

466
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:04,129
solved so this is day one in

467
00:14:04,129 --> 00:14:04,740
thailand

468
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:05,889
if you want to see if we can

469
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:07,590
actually hit a million follow for

470
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:12,220
day two yo let's go

471
00:14:12,259 --> 00:14:13,259
so that's a little bit kind of

472
00:14:13,259 --> 00:14:16,970

00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:17,820

00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:21,710
yeah we do these videos um like

475
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:23,490
almost on a daily basis literally

476
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:24,940
our editor is like right here

477
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:27,159

future that'd be awesome

484
00:14:39,059 --> 00:14:40,850

486
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,899

493
00:15:01,889 --> 00:15:03,700
that board is basically like

494
00:15:03,779 --> 00:15:05,629
our storyline creator so basically

495
00:15:05,629 --> 00:15:07,190
what our editor does is like he

496
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:08,690
puts together all the footage

497
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:09,419
inside

498
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:10,629
and then says hey this is what

499
00:15:11,129 --> 00:15:12,279
happened on day on this specific

500
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:13,830
day put together the entire script

501
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:14,210
and

502
00:15:14,259 --> 00:15:15,330
then poppy spits out the entire

503
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:16,919
script of like there's a these are

504
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:18,299
the stuff that you need to talk

505
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:20,090

00:17:11,529 --> 00:17:11,818
side we'll

567
00:17:11,859 --> 00:17:14,019
learn how to write amazing scripts

568
00:17:14,019 --> 00:17:15,910
i don't know about you guys but

569
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:18,338
it's also really amazing i know as

570
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:18,460
a

571
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,480
winning content and this is

572
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,619
something that a lot of people i

573
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:22,088
feel like don't do uh they don't

574
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:22,539
maybe have

575
00:17:22,578 --> 00:17:24,490
the capacity to do that it's like

576
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:26,318
one of the biggest use cases of

577
00:17:26,318 --> 00:17:28,380
the overall that i think is missed

578
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:28,640
out on

579
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,480
it's amazing and making great

580
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,509
content if you prompt it right and

581
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:35,019
if you use it right that's

582
00:17:35,059 --> 00:17:37,440
the key factor here so the thing

583
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,940
is you write a script usually for

584
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,059
for content it takes you five

585
00:17:42,099 --> 00:17:43,170
hours or whatever you write it

586
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:44,490
with ai it's gonna take you 30

587
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:45,599
minutes and this could be for

588
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:46,140
emails this

589
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:48,890
could be for lindy be lindy peach

590
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:51,650
copy you name it perfect so chgpt

591
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:54,140
everybody knows about chgpt

592
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,099
however

593
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:56,519
what we have found and this is

594
00:17:56,809 --> 00:17:57,960
something as content creators

595
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,490
found and you know a lot of our

596
00:17:59,490 --> 00:17:59,519
content

597
00:17:59,859 --> 00:18:02,029
creators do this is we actually

598
00:18:02,029 --> 00:18:04,230
don't use chgpt so much uh what's

599
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:06,329
actually better for copying

600
00:18:06,509 --> 00:18:07,019
overall

601
00:18:07,059 --> 00:18:08,890

00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,720
this is what will actually get you

624
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,509

there's a key prompt that you have

629
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,630
to actually make and there's this

630
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:06,329
magical formula there's no magic

631
00:19:06,329 --> 00:19:07,900
behind it you just have to speak

632
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:10,269
like a normal human being for the

633
00:19:10,269 --> 00:19:12,529
love of god um instead talk to ai

634
00:19:12,529 --> 00:19:14,859
like it's a five-year-old and

635
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,069
this is huge guys how do i like

636
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:17,750
it's a five-year-old what do i

637
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,500
mean with that when you talk to a

638
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:19,740
kid

639
00:19:19,779 --> 00:19:21,059
what do you say you don't say hey

640
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:22,789
you're you've got 10 years of

641
00:19:22,839 --> 00:19:25,140
experience in script writing you

642
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:25,829
need to

643
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:27,720
give me the full hook you need to

644
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,470
give me the full cta give me the

645
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:30,940
full script make sure it

646
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:31,299
approaches

647
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,579
this make sure that this make sure

648
00:19:33,579 --> 00:19:35,690
does this good luck trying to get

649
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:37,430
a good uh script out or something

650
00:19:37,539 --> 00:19:39,170
that's valuable enough right so

651
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:40,710
what i've done instead is i've

652
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:42,619
created something called a simple

653
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:44,170
framework simple prompting

654
00:19:44,329 --> 00:19:46,000
framework because why i feel like

655
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,009
it's simple um so what does it

656
00:19:48,069 --> 00:19:48,539
stand for

657
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:51,609
simple is for just use simple

658
00:19:51,609 --> 00:19:54,269
language two instructions one at a

659
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:55,509
time one at a time

660
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:58,079
instructions three mark it define

661
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:00,009
who the script is for because

662
00:20:00,009 --> 00:20:01,759
again our goal here is to teach

663
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:02,140
you how

664
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:04,650
to make content patterns always

665
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:07,339
teach it good patterns because for

666
00:20:07,349 --> 00:20:10,140
example overall ai is amazing in

667
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:12,380
knowing a lot of different things

668
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:14,529
however however um ai doesn't know

669
00:20:14,529 --> 00:20:16,240
a specific way of how to make

670
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:17,509
content it doesn't know

671
00:20:18,089 --> 00:20:19,809
specifically how to sound like you

672
00:20:19,809 --> 00:20:22,059
and so by giving it a way like

673
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:22,480
here's what

674
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:24,579
good looks like here's what a good

675
00:20:24,579 --> 00:20:26,329
email looks like here's what a

676
00:20:26,329 --> 00:20:28,460
good script looks like this is

677
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:28,700
some

678
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:31,339
some said the simp way yeah that's

679
00:20:31,339 --> 00:20:33,910
funny so here's what a good video

680
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:36,579
looks like it will learn that to

681
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:36,859
be

682
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:39,309
and take and take that to be a lot

683
00:20:39,309 --> 00:20:41,970
of your priority compared to just

684
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,980
you know uh using its general

685
00:20:44,019 --> 00:20:45,089
knowledge on script writing so

686
00:20:45,109 --> 00:20:46,210
this is huge amanda you guys see

687
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:50,519
something no okay great language

688
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:50,779
and

689
00:20:50,819 --> 00:20:51,839
tone of voice define your tone of

690
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:52,769
voice this is huge and i'll go

691
00:20:52,769 --> 00:20:53,980
over all these different all these

692
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:56,250
different things in a second here

693
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,359
and define any external resources

694
00:20:58,359 --> 00:21:00,380
that the ai might use to make

695
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:02,390
the script or the copy better okay

696
00:21:02,549 --> 00:21:04,509
so one simple language what do i

697
00:21:04,509 --> 00:21:06,859
mean by that um here it is

698
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,400
first a lot of people might do

699
00:21:08,569 --> 00:21:09,990
this i don't know has any any of

700
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,579
you guys have done this for your

701
00:21:11,619 --> 00:21:12,869
defining you say hey you're a

702
00:21:13,289 --> 00:21:14,440
professional script writer 10

703
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,950
years of experience and content

704
00:21:16,099 --> 00:21:18,349
creation i need to do this yes

705
00:21:18,349 --> 00:21:22,380
exactly like okay what does it

706
00:21:22,519 --> 00:21:24,220
fucking mean to have 10 years of

707
00:21:24,259 --> 00:21:25,720
experience defined for me the

708
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:27,839
difference between 10 years eight

709
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,500
years nine years seven years

710
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,220
experience

711
00:21:30,259 --> 00:21:31,400
what is the difference here like

712
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,910
if i'm talking to you as a person

713
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:36,059
right like it does not matter

714
00:21:36,099 --> 00:21:38,119
honestly what more so matters

715
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:40,390
because ai by default has all the

716
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:42,779
experience it knows the content it

717
00:21:42,779 --> 00:21:43,180
knows

718
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:45,240
how to write all you have to do is

719
00:21:45,349 --> 00:21:47,269
just talk to it so here's a for

720
00:21:47,269 --> 00:21:49,309
example you know what i call a bad

721
00:21:49,619 --> 00:21:51,180
prompt and here's a result you

722
00:21:51,289 --> 00:21:52,910
might get with a bad prompt um for

723
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:55,099
example here your professional

724
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,210
script writer with 10 years

725
00:21:56,759 --> 00:21:57,559
experience and content creation

726
00:21:57,559 --> 00:21:58,609
write a script about five

727
00:21:58,619 --> 00:21:59,450
productivity hacks for

728
00:21:59,539 --> 00:22:01,390
content creators great so then you

729
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:03,279
might get something like this does

730
00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:04,619
this sound familiar it's

731
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:06,359
2 p.m you've been working all day

732
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:07,950
but somehow you're you're you've

733
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:09,660
only finished half a blog post and

734
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,960
responded to three comments okay

735
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,910
not too bad sounds okay right

736
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:16,539
however here's what my good good

737
00:22:16,579 --> 00:22:17,759
problem might sound like a good

738
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:19,309
problem might be like write a

739
00:22:19,309 --> 00:22:20,859
script about five productivity

740
00:22:20,859 --> 00:22:21,180
hacks for

741
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:23,609
content creators done like it's a

742
00:22:23,609 --> 00:22:25,569
simple guys just and then the

743
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,220
result with that becomes well here

744
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:28,380
it

745
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:29,490
is write a script about five

746
00:22:30,089 --> 00:22:31,240
productivity hacks for content

747
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,799
creators and this is the result we

748
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:33,259
get

749
00:22:33,299 --> 00:22:34,369
are you spending more time

750
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:35,980
managing your content that

751
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,269
actually created if you're

752
00:22:37,329 --> 00:22:38,210
drowning in endless

753
00:22:38,259 --> 00:22:39,960
to-do lists struggling to stay

754
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,829
consistent or feeling like there

755
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,740
aren't enough hours in the day

756
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:43,890
this

757
00:22:44,019 --> 00:22:45,869
video is for you it's about a it's

758
00:22:45,869 --> 00:22:47,759
about to shoot i'm about to share

759
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:49,500
five game changing productivity

760
00:22:49,539 --> 00:22:51,119
hacks that will transform how you

761
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:52,509
create content these aren't

762
00:22:52,599 --> 00:22:53,890
generic tips you've heard a

763
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:53,920
million

764
00:22:54,339 --> 00:22:55,410
times these are specific

765
00:22:56,009 --> 00:22:57,160
strategies i've tested and the

766
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:00,140
successful creators swear by which

767
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:00,819
one is better

768
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:03,329
like just from the sound of it

769
00:23:03,329 --> 00:23:06,099
this already sounds better it got

770
00:23:06,099 --> 00:23:09,259
me hooked a lot more so why

771
00:23:09,259 --> 00:23:09,500
because

772
00:23:09,539 --> 00:23:10,630
i just use very simple language

773
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:12,359
and there's no need to over

774
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:14,220
complicate it okay so hopefully so

775
00:23:14,619 --> 00:23:14,619
far

776
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:16,630
that makes sense any questions so

777
00:23:16,789 --> 00:23:18,410
far guys are we all good yes so

778
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,700
far good great and one more thing

779
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:23,559
i'll add to that is like there's

780
00:23:23,799 --> 00:23:26,640
one of the reasons why we also go

781
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,819
away from the hey do you like

782
00:23:29,819 --> 00:23:30,059
think

783
00:23:30,099 --> 00:23:31,190
like you have a 10 year experience

784
00:23:31,769 --> 00:23:33,839
script writer is like not say what

785
00:23:33,839 --> 00:23:36,140
does it mean but also here's the

786
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:37,269
thing you could be a shitty

787
00:23:37,849 --> 00:23:39,430
copywriter or a shitty script

788
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:41,750
writer with 10 years of experience

789
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:42,059
or you

790
00:23:42,099 --> 00:23:44,400
could be a complete god with just

791
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,410
two years of experience so it

792
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:48,779
doesn't actually really add a lot

793
00:23:48,819 --> 00:23:50,000
of value to the prompt what

794
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:52,250
instead you could do is like say

795
00:23:52,279 --> 00:23:55,980
hey use this copywriting framework

796
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:56,619
or use

797
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:58,799
this specific script writing

798
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:01,029
framework that actually adds more

799
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:04,140
value to the prompt than like oh

800
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:04,460
do it

801
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,569
with like 10 years of experience

802
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:07,829
yeah good and they just use the

803
00:24:07,829 --> 00:24:10,140
knowledge it has anyways yeah

804
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:10,460
great

805
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:13,200
next one step two instructions one

806
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,660
at a time what i mean with that is

807
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:18,059
if you try to be like hey create

808
00:24:18,099 --> 00:24:19,420
for me a full script with a five

809
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:20,920
with an attention grabbing hook

810
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,470
five productivity hacks examples

811
00:24:22,819 --> 00:24:24,529
anecdotes call to action etc it

812
00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:26,279
might give you okay results but

813
00:24:26,289 --> 00:24:28,180
it's not going to give you amazing

814
00:24:28,259 --> 00:24:30,430
results instead if you talk to it

815
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:32,230
the one thing at a time so for

816
00:24:32,279 --> 00:24:34,309
example if i'm like lucas for

817
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:34,740
example

818
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:37,140
hey can you give me the structure

819
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:39,269
for the presentation of what we

820
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:40,950
need to cover in the workshop

821
00:24:41,549 --> 00:24:42,460
right

822
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,059
she versus like hey lucas give me

823
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:45,670
the full presentation we need to

824
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:48,460
do right a structure might be a

825
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:48,559
lot

826
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:50,140
easier to start with but once we

827
00:24:50,309 --> 00:24:51,819
get the structure we can go deeper

828
00:24:51,819 --> 00:24:52,490
into the actual

829
00:24:52,579 --> 00:24:53,650
structure and make the

830
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:55,400
presentation make sense so same

831
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,950
thing goes for cold email same

832
00:24:56,950 --> 00:24:57,940
thing goes for

833
00:24:58,019 --> 00:24:59,900
making content right give the

834
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,970
structure for the content first

835
00:25:02,049 --> 00:25:03,819
and then from there we can go

836
00:25:03,819 --> 00:25:04,069
about

837
00:25:04,259 --> 00:25:05,440
making the actual script so for

838
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:06,940
example a good problem i sound

839
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:08,460
like stop recruiting a simple

840
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:08,619
outline

841
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,869
with an intro five main points and

842
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,859
a conclusion i get the structure

843
00:25:12,859 --> 00:25:14,700
first and then i get the script

844
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:17,000
after make sense awesome step

845
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,460
three specify the market who are

846
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:21,579
you targeting so a lot of you guys

847
00:25:21,589 --> 00:25:21,740
they

848
00:25:21,779 --> 00:25:23,380
have you have a specific target

849
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:24,970
market you guys are talking to

850
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:27,099
right um this might be you know

851
00:25:27,099 --> 00:25:27,339
other

852
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:29,349
agencies other content creators

853
00:25:29,509 --> 00:25:31,420
might be someone who is a younger

854
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:33,819
more more beginner or someone who

855
00:25:33,819 --> 00:25:33,859
is

856
00:25:34,019 --> 00:25:35,740
more advanced depending on that

857
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:37,450
you can specify your prompt so if

858
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,019
you say something like make a

859
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:39,259
script

860
00:25:39,299 --> 00:25:40,309
that will resonate with my

861
00:25:40,309 --> 00:25:41,269
audience you might specify

862
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:43,500
something like this this is for a

863
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:43,650
seven

864
00:25:43,859 --> 00:25:45,480
minute youtube video targeting new

865
00:25:45,529 --> 00:25:46,630
content creators who are

866
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:48,210
struggling with time management

867
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:49,500
while working full-time

868
00:25:49,539 --> 00:25:51,869
jobs okay so i'm defining who it's

869
00:25:51,869 --> 00:25:53,880
for and then the ai will will a

870
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:57,019
lot better understand how what's

871
00:25:57,019 --> 00:25:57,180
up

872
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:58,990
oh sorry because he just like

873
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:01,180
literally walked out they will

874
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:03,660
understand how to better uh you

875
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:04,299
know uh

876
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:06,289
what kind of work is to use

877
00:26:06,869 --> 00:26:08,039
because for simple for categories

878
00:26:08,279 --> 00:26:10,059
for beginners it will use words

879
00:26:10,299 --> 00:26:10,539
that are a

880
00:26:10,579 --> 00:26:12,230
lot you know easier or simpler to

881
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:14,039
understand for someone who's more

882
00:26:14,049 --> 00:26:15,740
advanced it will use more advanced

883
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:16,380
uh

884
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:18,230
wordage or words i guess you could

885
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:20,140
say that's step three step four

886
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:22,460
hadn't show what good looks like

887
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,119
and i think this is honestly the

888
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:25,789
biggest way to get good scripts

889
00:26:25,789 --> 00:26:27,660
and good emails landing page copy

890
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:27,980
overall

891
00:26:28,579 --> 00:26:30,960
is actually tell it what a good

892
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,779
framework is actually give it okay

893
00:26:33,779 --> 00:26:36,299
here's maybe lucas framework for

894
00:26:36,339 --> 00:26:38,309
making a good landing page copy

895
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:40,539
here is for example a you know ali

896
00:26:40,539 --> 00:26:42,619
abdahl's framework for making a

897
00:26:42,759 --> 00:26:43,339
good script

898
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:45,349
right it will be able to actually

899
00:26:45,509 --> 00:26:47,490
understand it a lot more than just

900
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:50,220
just a generic generic way of hey

901
00:26:50,259 --> 00:26:51,329
let me just make some right some

902
00:26:51,509 --> 00:26:53,359
kind of a script so start doing

903
00:26:53,369 --> 00:26:55,259
this just like this here are

904
00:26:55,359 --> 00:26:55,819
examples of

905
00:26:55,859 --> 00:26:57,589
amazing hooks and scripts from

906
00:26:57,589 --> 00:26:59,019
creators i love model the

907
00:26:59,019 --> 00:27:01,099
structure and then you just define

908
00:27:01,099 --> 00:27:02,700
them you define what

909
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:05,440
those look like okay um and then

910
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,069
it will also a good thing about

911
00:27:08,069 --> 00:27:11,259
this is like ai itself is trained

912
00:27:11,259 --> 00:27:11,579
on

913
00:27:11,619 --> 00:27:13,589
examples right like ai itself is

914
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:15,670
like identify dogs and they feed

915
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:17,660
like hundreds of thousands of

916
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:18,539
images

917
00:27:18,579 --> 00:27:20,490
and that's how ai gets trained is

918
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:22,329
like based on examples so if you

919
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:25,079
want good output instead of just

920
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:25,740
like

921
00:27:25,779 --> 00:27:28,150
you know giving generic stuff say

922
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:30,089
hey here's five really good

923
00:27:30,089 --> 00:27:31,869
scripts or here's like five really

924
00:27:32,099 --> 00:27:34,279
good hooks from videos that i like

925
00:27:34,279 --> 00:27:36,259
what are the good things about

926
00:27:36,259 --> 00:27:37,900
this hook take that and model it

927
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:38,140
for

928
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:40,599
my video exactly exactly sha asked

929
00:27:40,599 --> 00:27:42,509
the question says do you feed

930
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:45,099
pattern for supervised learning

931
00:27:45,099 --> 00:27:45,420
map

932
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:47,339
inputs to outputs and provide

933
00:27:47,339 --> 00:27:49,049
reasoning no i do not i do not

934
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:51,420
provide any reasoning whatsoever

935
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:52,299
um

936
00:27:52,339 --> 00:27:54,119
all i do is i say here are

937
00:27:54,119 --> 00:27:56,329
examples of great hooks and

938
00:27:56,329 --> 00:28:00,180
scripts i love that's it i keep it

939
00:28:00,259 --> 00:28:00,619
stupid

940
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:03,480
simple the kiss method um and from

941
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:06,420
there a guy will figure it out on

942
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:09,180
its own honestly it will do a good

943
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:10,289
enough job just from providing

944
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:12,059
good scripts lucas will lucas

945
00:28:12,279 --> 00:28:13,869
probably knows this because he

946
00:28:14,299 --> 00:28:14,779
uses popular

947
00:28:14,819 --> 00:28:16,069
time and he will like where you

948
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:17,460
can bring in all these different

949
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:19,019
types of content you just provide

950
00:28:19,019 --> 00:28:19,160
a

951
00:28:19,299 --> 00:28:21,009
different content you say that

952
00:28:21,009 --> 00:28:22,680
it's good you say what you like

953
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,539
and then from there it's able to

954
00:28:24,539 --> 00:28:24,930
actually

955
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:26,059
you know understand it a lot

956
00:28:26,569 --> 00:28:27,680
better just like for example if

957
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,259
you go to your mom and your mom is

958
00:28:29,259 --> 00:28:29,579
like and

959
00:28:29,619 --> 00:28:30,759
you're like hey mom can you can

960
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,380
you i love this casserole can you

961
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:33,740
make sure you make me this

962
00:28:33,779 --> 00:28:35,529
consistently she'll make you more

963
00:28:35,529 --> 00:28:36,140
casserole

964
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:41,940
there you go um awesome step five

965
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:44,109
language and tone of voice this is

966
00:28:44,109 --> 00:28:45,819
i love to define this as well

967
00:28:45,859 --> 00:28:47,319
if you want to sound a little bit

968
00:28:47,529 --> 00:28:49,069
different or if you want to sound

969
00:28:49,069 --> 00:28:50,940
more like you and don't want to

970
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:53,450
sound like ai or chat tpt define

971
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:56,170
your tone of voice okay instead of

972
00:28:56,170 --> 00:28:58,619
saying hey use engaging style of

973
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:00,220
writing use energetic style of

974
00:29:00,329 --> 00:29:02,000
writing to try and understand what

975
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,130
your voice sounds like have the ai

976
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:06,980
define what your voice sounds like

977
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:08,970
so what i mean by that is say this

978
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:11,579
please use my voice of tone and

979
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:12,380
words

980
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:15,660
and give it examples of the actual

981
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:18,349
words and scripts and videos that

982
00:29:18,349 --> 00:29:20,539
you've done so what that might

983
00:29:20,539 --> 00:29:20,779
look

984
00:29:20,819 --> 00:29:23,400
like is you upload a script that

985
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:26,109
maybe you have done you upload an

986
00:29:26,109 --> 00:29:28,619
email that you have done yourself

987
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:30,299
um you upload i'm i don't know

988
00:29:30,329 --> 00:29:32,250
what else you upload a newsletter

989
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:34,460
maybe you've you've written right

990
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,140
maybe a text message you wrote you

991
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:37,319
wrote to a girl i don't know

992
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:40,460
anything right so you upload that

993
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:40,559
and

994
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:42,309
ai will learn from there as well

995
00:29:42,410 --> 00:29:43,559
and i don't need to give my

996
00:29:43,799 --> 00:29:45,109
reasoning i don't need to specify

997
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:46,299
anything

998
00:29:46,339 --> 00:29:48,049
i just let the ai do the work for

999
00:29:48,049 --> 00:29:49,880
me that's why examples and what

1000
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,390
good looks like are so so so huge

1001
00:29:52,579 --> 00:29:54,240
and finally six um that's an

1002
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:56,460
optional one external knowledge so

1003
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:57,740
any external knowledge that will

1004
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:57,900
be

1005
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:59,269
helpful for example instead of

1006
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:00,759
saying something like talk about

1007
00:30:00,759 --> 00:30:02,059
waking up early morning and

1008
00:30:02,099 --> 00:30:04,069
filling multiple videos at once i

1009
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:06,460
might say something like use

1010
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,259
content about productivity hacks i

1011
00:30:09,299 --> 00:30:10,759
provide it as a knowledge feel

1012
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:12,119
free to talk about filming

1013
00:30:12,359 --> 00:30:14,460
multiple videos at once so give it

1014
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:14,660
any

1015
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:16,079
type of data that you feel it

1016
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:17,559
could be helpful right and so a

1017
00:30:17,569 --> 00:30:19,069
lot of times i'll feed it maybe

1018
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:19,500
data

1019
00:30:19,539 --> 00:30:20,680
from different websites i might

1020
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,230
feed the data from different

1021
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:23,660
youtube videos and it will use

1022
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:23,849
that

1023
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:25,630
knowledge to make new content for

1024
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:27,299
me and that's also super crucial

1025
00:30:27,299 --> 00:30:29,569
as well and so that is what i call

1026
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:31,869
the simple framework guys um now

1027
00:30:31,869 --> 00:30:33,890
but before we go and i show you

1028
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:36,380
kind of how i do this with claude

1029
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:36,539
are

1030
00:30:36,579 --> 00:30:38,730
there any questions so far are we

1031
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:40,920
all understood i'm really curious

1032
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:44,140
any questions so far no guys can

1033
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:45,730
unmute or you can post in chat oh

1034
00:30:45,849 --> 00:30:48,549
post and chat what any questions

1035
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:51,180
yes he said the questions oh okay

1036
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:53,900
okay okay okay yeah okay but if i

1037
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:55,970
was good okay if i was good we'll

1038
00:30:56,299 --> 00:30:59,019
just continue on okay so let me go

1039
00:30:59,059 --> 00:31:00,730
ahead and move on to using cloud

1040
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:02,240
for this and i can we can also

1041
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,980
give you guys this framework that

1042
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:04,299
we have

1043
00:31:04,339 --> 00:31:06,519
built um as well and this should

1044
00:31:06,519 --> 00:31:08,569
be helpful to you as well um so

1045
00:31:08,569 --> 00:31:11,099
i'll go here all right so this is

1046
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:13,079
cloud everybody knows cloud yes or

1047
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:14,890
some people do know cloud um a lot

1048
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:16,619
has something called cloud

1049
00:31:16,619 --> 00:31:17,019
projects

1050
00:31:17,059 --> 00:31:18,269
which is right here okay right

1051
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:20,039
here on the left side you go to

1052
00:31:20,119 --> 00:31:21,369
here and when you make a new

1053
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:21,980
project you can

1054
00:31:22,019 --> 00:31:24,200
define something called a project

1055
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,329
knowledge and we're going to find

1056
00:31:26,329 --> 00:31:28,700
the knowledge so some someone

1057
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:30,450
say do you do six different

1058
00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:32,329
prompts of all six in one ah so

1059
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:34,539
great questions shaw said do you

1060
00:31:34,539 --> 00:31:34,829
do six

1061
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:37,720
different prompts of all six and

1062
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:40,420
one i actually do this one prompt

1063
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:43,099
as the whole prompt so that simple

1064
00:31:43,099 --> 00:31:43,500
method

1065
00:31:44,099 --> 00:31:46,769
is going to be as one whole prompt

1066
00:31:46,769 --> 00:31:49,589
but sometimes i do also define the

1067
00:31:49,589 --> 00:31:51,500
voice of tone separately so let

1068
00:31:51,539 --> 00:31:52,609
me show you and you'll understand

1069
00:31:53,109 --> 00:31:54,970
what i'm talking about okay so in

1070
00:31:55,049 --> 00:31:57,589
terms of for example providing

1071
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:59,670
external knowledge the voice of

1072
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:01,529
tone providing it you know um a

1073
00:32:01,529 --> 00:32:03,789
framework for building something i

1074
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:04,859
to

1075
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,819
cloud give this right here so here

1076
00:32:06,819 --> 00:32:08,490
we have this thing called the

1077
00:32:08,569 --> 00:32:10,859
ultimate video um ultimate youtube

1078
00:32:10,859 --> 00:32:10,960
video

1079
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,309
framework i have uh this something

1080
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:14,440
called the ultimate youtube title

1081
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,569
writing framework and

1082
00:32:15,779 --> 00:32:16,849
i will send you guys these as well

1083
00:32:17,099 --> 00:32:18,460
so you guys can use for yourselves

1084
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:20,109
yeah i've already linked them

1085
00:32:20,259 --> 00:32:21,920
in the chat amazing the ultimate

1086
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:23,440
youtube thumbnail creation

1087
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,890
framework and the ultimate youtube

1088
00:32:26,009 --> 00:32:26,140
script

1089
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:27,829
writing framework and we actually

1090
00:32:27,849 --> 00:32:29,309
made this using poppy as well to

1091
00:32:29,309 --> 00:32:31,380
to build this remember how i

1092
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:31,660
talked

1093
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,670
about the simple method provide

1094
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:35,680
examples of what good looks like

1095
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:37,660
this is what good looks like and

1096
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:37,980
so we

1097
00:32:38,019 --> 00:32:39,880
provided examples of what good

1098
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,859
actually looks like first then i

1099
00:32:41,859 --> 00:32:44,380
provided the voice of tone so all

1100
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:44,859
i did

1101
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,500
when i'm going to come to my voice

1102
00:32:46,569 --> 00:32:48,200
of tone right here i did something

1103
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,650
very simple i just went to a

1104
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:49,900
youtube

1105
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:51,910
video i had which was this one

1106
00:32:52,069 --> 00:32:54,190
okay i got a transcript for this

1107
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:56,700
youtube video using like a simple

1108
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:57,339
youtube

1109
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:58,589

1110
00:32:59,049 --> 00:33:00,140

1111
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:01,259
there just type in youtube

1112
00:33:01,259 --> 00:33:01,759
transcript generator

1113
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:05,759
then from there i copied this put

1114
00:33:05,839 --> 00:33:09,339
it into cloud hit plus like here

1115
00:33:09,339 --> 00:33:12,210
add text as content and say my

1116
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:13,250
voice of tone

1117
00:33:13,299 --> 00:33:15,269
okay and that is it and i just hit

1118
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:17,349
add content and then that's it

1119
00:33:17,349 --> 00:33:19,359
that's how i got this right here

1120
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:19,980
okay

1121
00:33:20,019 --> 00:33:21,940
and then these ones this is my

1122
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:24,319
external knowledge because i want

1123
00:33:24,319 --> 00:33:26,500
to create a piece of content on

1124
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:27,819
you know content uh

1125
00:33:27,859 --> 00:33:28,920
hacks for content creators

1126
00:33:29,529 --> 00:33:30,680
productivity has got the creators

1127
00:33:30,690 --> 00:33:31,980
i provided other external

1128
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:32,230

more content

1133
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:39,730
and actually actually no this one

1134
00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:40,680
is from ali abdahl the best

1135
00:33:40,789 --> 00:33:42,940
productivity hacks for of all time

1136
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:43,339
from ali

1137
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:44,450
abdahl and this is a different

1138
00:33:45,049 --> 00:33:46,200
video that i got which i think

1139
00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:48,220
it's this one yeah this one right

1140
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:48,740
here

1141
00:33:48,819 --> 00:33:49,890
five particularly hacks to create

1142
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:51,259
more content and i just got it

1143
00:33:51,259 --> 00:33:54,299
from him the goal here is to model

1144
00:33:54,299 --> 00:33:54,779
not to

1145
00:33:54,819 --> 00:33:56,599
copy but just to model to model

1146
00:33:56,599 --> 00:33:58,569
the structure to model what they

1147
00:33:58,569 --> 00:34:01,220
talk about etc because at the end

1148
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:01,259
of

1149
00:34:01,299 --> 00:34:03,240
the day all ideas come from

1150
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,579
somewhere and so we want to kind

1151
00:34:05,579 --> 00:34:07,359
of see okay what is the structure

1152
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:08,539
that made

1153
00:34:08,579 --> 00:34:10,849
them go viral or made their video

1154
00:34:10,849 --> 00:34:12,949
good or made their email good and

1155
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:14,940
again all this stuff can be

1156
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:15,260
applied

1157
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:17,269
not just to content creation but

1158
00:34:17,429 --> 00:34:19,579
to emails and newsletters right

1159
00:34:19,579 --> 00:34:20,860
what is the reason why this email

1160
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:21,349
is so good

1161
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:23,380
what is the structure of that you

1162
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:25,199
can put all that into ai and say

1163
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:26,940
hey this is a good email so if i

1164
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:28,739
were you i would actually specify

1165
00:34:28,739 --> 00:34:30,539
this i'll be like hey add contents

1166
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:32,340
add text content and i'll be like

1167
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:34,789
amazing email to model right and i

1168
00:34:34,789 --> 00:34:37,219
just put that email inside here or

1169
00:34:37,519 --> 00:34:39,340
maybe that that might be your own

1170
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:41,269
email or someone else's email um

1171
00:34:41,269 --> 00:34:43,260
that you might get for example and

1172
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:45,010
that's it once i got all these

1173
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:47,429
boldies like one what is it one

1174
00:34:47,610 --> 00:34:48,760
two three four five six seven

1175
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,380
eight things i go into i might

1176
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:52,780
just start

1177
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:53,960
making the content so the first

1178
00:34:54,489 --> 00:34:55,500
thing i do and a shot asked me

1179
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,940
this question like you know what

1180
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:57,170
does the

1181
00:34:57,219 --> 00:34:59,860
process usually take to actually

1182
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:02,250
um write it and the process is i

1183
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,380
want to define my voice of tone

1184
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:06,929
first so what do i do is i say hey

1185
00:35:06,929 --> 00:35:09,699
based on my tone of voice which is

1186
00:35:09,699 --> 00:35:12,219
the the text i provided how do i

1187
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:14,230
speak and what is my voice of tone

1188
00:35:14,389 --> 00:35:16,349
and then once i have this i always

1189
00:35:16,349 --> 00:35:18,059
provide it to the ai the ai

1190
00:35:18,099 --> 00:35:20,340
will that itself understand the

1191
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:22,360
content and will tell me how i

1192
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,780
speak so it will tell me something

1193
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:24,940
like

1194
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:27,519
i'm very straightforward and

1195
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:28,909
action-oriented i'm very

1196
00:35:28,909 --> 00:35:30,710
conversational and engaging value

1197
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:31,900
focused

1198
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:33,079
authority by approach and they

1199
00:35:33,289 --> 00:35:34,690
will tell it will learn what kind

1200
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:36,219
of words i use at the same time

1201
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:38,570
right so i will define that to the

1202
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:40,920
ai first that's step one okay and

1203
00:35:41,269 --> 00:35:43,099
then once i got that let's do

1204
00:35:43,139 --> 00:35:44,760
let's use a simple framework to

1205
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:46,630
actually make the piece of content

1206
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:48,219
right simple framework simple

1207
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:50,230
language i want to create a script

1208
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,369
for youtube for five productivity

1209
00:35:52,369 --> 00:35:54,139
hacks for creators very simple

1210
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:56,559
market who are we doing it for my

1211
00:35:56,650 --> 00:35:58,239
goal is to help for help creators

1212
00:35:58,239 --> 00:35:59,349
who have a full-time job

1213
00:35:59,619 --> 00:36:01,269
and don't have the time to create

1214
00:36:01,289 --> 00:36:02,969
content we define the market i

1215
00:36:02,969 --> 00:36:05,679
want to talk about the uh the one

1216
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:07,829
take wonder fill the video in one

1217
00:36:07,829 --> 00:36:09,929
go just continue to talk to camera

1218
00:36:09,929 --> 00:36:11,340
don't stop i just gave it some

1219
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:13,260
external context like external

1220
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:14,889
knowledge right um general

1221
00:36:14,889 --> 00:36:16,699
knowledge about like what are some

1222
00:36:16,699 --> 00:36:17,420
things uh

1223
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:19,429
to talk about okay next use the

1224
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:21,769
frameworks or for writing a script

1225
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,219
where is this coming from i give

1226
00:36:24,219 --> 00:36:24,300
it

1227
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:26,480
the i give it the framework which

1228
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,710
came from here right the ultimate

1229
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,179
script writing framework

1230
00:36:31,219 --> 00:36:33,190
that is what good looks like okay

1231
00:36:33,349 --> 00:36:35,340
so we define that part let me go

1232
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:35,590
to here

1233
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:39,889
and then i say give the structure

1234
00:36:39,889 --> 00:36:41,989
for my video based on the

1235
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:44,219
structure of other winning content

1236
00:36:44,219 --> 00:36:44,570
i

1237
00:36:44,659 --> 00:36:47,000
connected okay and so what i did

1238
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,920
here is i said hey give the

1239
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,719
structure first and then give the

1240
00:36:51,079 --> 00:36:51,500
script

1241
00:36:51,539 --> 00:36:53,510
second okay and the other winning

1242
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:55,349
content i connected is the ali

1243
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:57,500
abdahl video and that's the other

1244
00:36:57,539 --> 00:36:59,250
productivity hacker video so

1245
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:01,110
that's what i did from there okay

1246
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:03,420
then from there it went about now

1247
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:03,590
sometimes

1248
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:05,030
you'll get the structure and

1249
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:06,679
sometimes this time ai cloud

1250
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,460
actually decided to give me the

1251
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:09,420
full script

1252
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:12,079
and here's the script and this is

1253
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:14,739
not the best script but i'll tell

1254
00:37:14,739 --> 00:37:16,619
you how you can improve it because

1255
00:37:16,659 --> 00:37:18,170
at least the script sounds like me

1256
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:19,500
so for example let's watch this

1257
00:37:19,719 --> 00:37:21,659
video real quickly i'm gonna show

1258
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:21,739

1279
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:04,550
youtube videos last year while

1280
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:06,280
working a demanding full-time job

1281
00:38:06,449 --> 00:38:07,579
by the end of this video you'll

1282
00:38:07,579 --> 00:38:07,739
have

1283
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:08,949
five productivity hacks that will

1284
00:38:09,429 --> 00:38:10,599
10x your content creation output

1285
00:38:10,829 --> 00:38:12,059
help you feel less overwhelmed and

1286
00:38:12,099 --> 00:38:13,269
finally let you build your creator

1287
00:38:13,769 --> 00:38:15,159
business without quitting my day

1288
00:38:15,159 --> 00:38:16,699
job these aren't just theory these

1289
00:38:16,739 --> 00:38:18,409
are exact methods i use every

1290
00:38:18,409 --> 00:38:20,329
single day to balance both let's

1291
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,460
dive in right and so remember that

1292
00:38:22,489 --> 00:38:22,619
i

1293
00:38:22,659 --> 00:38:23,880
want to show you it kind of tried

1294
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:25,739
to model me and what i do with the

1295
00:38:25,739 --> 00:38:26,940
structure of for example

1296
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:28,190
ali abdahl and so it did talk

1297
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:29,820
about example i said hey talk

1298
00:38:30,039 --> 00:38:31,659
about the one take wonder and

1299
00:38:31,659 --> 00:38:32,539
here's this

1300
00:38:32,579 --> 00:38:33,670
here's the one take wonder method

1301
00:38:33,909 --> 00:38:35,400
you hit record and you do not stop

1302
00:38:35,639 --> 00:38:36,889
until you've covered your entire

1303
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:38,949
topic no matter what mistakes you

1304
00:38:38,949 --> 00:38:40,889
make you keep going why does this

1305
00:38:40,889 --> 00:38:43,739
work two reasons right so it give

1306
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:45,800
your full script that's really

1307
00:38:45,909 --> 00:38:47,820
good and now this might be good

1308
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:49,869
enough honestly to already at this

1309
00:38:50,099 --> 00:38:51,679
point make an amazing video but i

1310
00:38:51,769 --> 00:38:53,300
feel like hey naz i actually want

1311
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:55,730
to improve the intro now how do i

1312
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:57,300
improve the intro if i want to

1313
00:38:57,530 --> 00:38:58,969
intro even make it either make it

1314
00:38:58,969 --> 00:39:01,489
more punchy or just change your

1315
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:01,820
overall

1316
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:02,929
to sound like someone else what

1317

let's be good boys come on any

1328
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:28,289
ideas could you repeat the the

1329
00:39:28,409 --> 00:39:30,300
last part of the question i had an

1330
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:30,500
audio

1331
00:39:30,579 --> 00:39:33,059
glitch yeah so basically what i

1332
00:39:33,059 --> 00:39:35,570
said was like hey if i was to make

1333
00:39:35,679 --> 00:39:37,260
this hook a little bit better

1334
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:38,809
right what would i do like how

1335
00:39:38,969 --> 00:39:40,530
would i improve this hook or how

1336
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:41,679
would i improve this script

1337
00:39:42,179 --> 00:39:43,250
hold on

1338
00:39:43,619 --> 00:39:50,539
i'll probably give it like a video

1339
00:39:50,539 --> 00:39:52,820
transcript of callaway where he

1340
00:39:52,869 --> 00:39:54,860
explains how do you write a viral

1341
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:57,500
hook and then just ask him like

1342
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,889
ask claude to rewrite the book and

1343
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,980
use the same framework by callaway

1344
00:40:02,019 --> 00:40:04,460
there we go yeah or you say what

1345
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:06,010
jacob says and you just you tell

1346
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:07,820
like you dumb can't try harder

1347
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:13,059
that's what i did or sometimes i

1348
00:40:13,059 --> 00:40:15,019
will do something like this

1349
00:40:15,619 --> 00:40:16,840
that's this is this actually works

1350
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:20,460
sometimes make it more viral no

1351
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:23,019
make it more viral that's me

1352
00:40:23,059 --> 00:40:24,110
there's all the capitals

1353
00:40:24,179 --> 00:40:29,599
make it more about and i've i've

1354
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:31,139
honestly had it where it does a

1355
00:40:31,139 --> 00:40:32,460
pretty pretty damn good job

1356
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:32,940
honestly

1357
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:34,840
do my favorite one is uh i i tell

1358
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,519
it that i've kidnapped his

1359
00:40:36,639 --> 00:40:38,139
grandmother and if it doesn't do

1360
00:40:38,179 --> 00:40:40,320
what i say it's gonna be executed

1361
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,480
uh but also if it succeeds it gets

1362
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,230
paid eight billion dollars

1363
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:46,969
and that actually has resulted in

1364
00:40:46,969 --> 00:40:48,170
better inputs i swear to god i

1365
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:50,300
swear to god that's so funny i

1366
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:51,530
mean this is pretty good look at

1367
00:40:51,719 --> 00:40:52,750
this this one had to be a hundred

1368
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:54,219
thousand dollars in revenue while

1369
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:55,719
working a soul crush nine-to-five

1370
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:57,000
job i want to show you the five

1371
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,460
productivity secrets that top

1372
00:40:58,500 --> 00:40:59,570
creators don't want you to know

1373
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:00,960
including the forbidden method

1374
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,219
that lets you create three days

1375
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:04,110
of content in just three hours oh

1376
00:41:04,110 --> 00:41:08,219
so good so there we go the word of

1377
00:41:08,219 --> 00:41:09,739
just making mobile made it even

1378
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:14,869

1381
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:17,739
the

1382
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:19,989
problem i still face with like

1383
00:41:19,989 --> 00:41:22,130
claw is still that you know like

1384
00:41:22,130 --> 00:41:24,380
like this hook is good because it

1385
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:24,619
has

1386
00:41:24,659 --> 00:41:26,519
hundred thousand dollars revenue

1387
00:41:26,519 --> 00:41:28,119
in it and like i'm about to show

1388
00:41:28,130 --> 00:41:29,980
like five productivity secrets

1389
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:30,010
that

1390
00:41:30,099 --> 00:41:31,699
let's you create 30 days worth of

1391
00:41:31,769 --> 00:41:32,949
content in just three hours like

1392
00:41:33,159 --> 00:41:35,019
it still needs to be sort of true

1393
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:36,639
to put put that in your video

1394
00:41:36,730 --> 00:41:38,809
right so like how do you like that

1395
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,260
that's one of my questions as well

1396
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:41,500
that

1397
00:41:41,539 --> 00:41:43,230
how do you make sure that it it

1398
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:45,289
doesn't hallucinate and make this

1399
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:47,340
crazy information on its own just

1400
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:47,500
to

1401
00:41:47,539 --> 00:41:49,159
make it viral and it's like still

1402
00:41:49,210 --> 00:41:50,929
yeah a little bit authentic to you

1403
00:41:50,929 --> 00:41:52,860
yeah that's a great question

1404
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:54,920
that's a great question and it's a

1405
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:57,269
the answer is fairly simple and it

1406
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,860
comes down to providing it

1407
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:02,579
your voice and who you are and the

1408
00:42:02,579 --> 00:42:04,320
content you wanted to talk about

1409
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:06,530
so what i would do all the time

1410
00:42:06,659 --> 00:42:08,150
and this is something i do with

1411
00:42:08,329 --> 00:42:09,750
poppy you can do with claude as

1412
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:11,659
well pretty much on youtube what i

1413
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:11,820
would

1414
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:13,809
do is out honestly here's me and

1415
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:15,769
this is what i tell everybody to

1416
00:42:15,889 --> 00:42:17,659
do i go to voiceline was app

1417
00:42:17,699 --> 00:42:19,099
hopefully you guys know how to

1418
00:42:19,369 --> 00:42:20,550
record uh you know record your own

1419
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:24,860
voice i go to here and i just

1420
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:25,179
start

1421
00:42:25,219 --> 00:42:27,500
recording literally my voice and i

1422
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:29,530
start recording my own thoughts

1423
00:42:30,059 --> 00:42:31,579
about what it means to do a

1424
00:42:31,869 --> 00:42:32,699
productivity

1425
00:42:32,739 --> 00:42:33,809
hacks then you know productivity

1426
00:42:34,409 --> 00:42:36,059
hacks for content creators i would

1427
00:42:36,059 --> 00:42:37,579
just say it with my own words i

1428
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:37,820
would

1429
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:38,929
blabber it doesn't matter

1430
00:42:39,530 --> 00:42:40,650
necessarily you know what the

1431
00:42:40,650 --> 00:42:42,190
structure is i don't care about

1432
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:42,860
any of that

1433
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:46,110
i speak the content then what i do

1434
00:42:46,110 --> 00:42:48,880
is i let the ai structure the

1435
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:51,420
content in a way that is more

1436
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:51,980
viral

1437
00:42:52,019 --> 00:42:53,809
based on these other videos does

1438
00:42:53,809 --> 00:42:56,000
it make sense so yeah if you speak

1439
00:42:56,050 --> 00:42:58,070
the actual content like you define

1440
00:42:58,380 --> 00:42:58,380
it

1441
00:42:58,420 --> 00:43:00,780
you're like here here's who i am

1442
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:02,800
here's what i do here's the things

1443
00:43:03,449 --> 00:43:05,340
i want to talk about and you

1444
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:06,449
actually speak those things

1445
00:43:06,969 --> 00:43:07,900
because there might be a lot of

1446
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:10,380
different you know uh things that

1447
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:10,460
you

1448
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:11,639
have in your mind when it comes to

1449
00:43:12,110 --> 00:43:12,900
creating some kind of a copy it

1450
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:13,969
could be an email so forth

1451
00:43:14,019 --> 00:43:16,659
and as long as you provide that

1452
00:43:16,659 --> 00:43:19,440
data it will use that um you know

1453
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,260
it will use that to create the

1454
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:23,130
actual content and that's at that

1455
00:43:23,130 --> 00:43:24,389
point i don't find that

1456
00:43:24,389 --> 00:43:26,050
hallucinates too much it will

1457
00:43:26,389 --> 00:43:27,349
hallucinate if

1458
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:29,409
you don't provide any knowledge

1459
00:43:29,409 --> 00:43:31,210
about what you do or about your

1460
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,940
type of content make sense

1461
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:34,480
and i think that would be that

1462
00:43:34,650 --> 00:43:36,159
that would be your answer right

1463
00:43:36,159 --> 00:43:38,219
yeah and hopefully that's that's

1464
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:40,079
pretty much it but i do this all

1465
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:42,010
the time i will when i ask people

1466
00:43:42,010 --> 00:43:43,500
like hey i want to make some

1467
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:43,889
content

1468
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:45,159
for you guys for example let's

1469
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:46,260
just say i get in a call with

1470
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:48,059
somebody and i say uh hey let's

1471
00:43:48,059 --> 00:43:48,219
make

1472
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:50,719
some content together i do one

1473
00:43:50,719 --> 00:43:53,019
simple thing i have them hit

1474
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:55,000
record in pop ai and i'll show you

1475
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:55,099
that

1476
00:43:55,139 --> 00:43:56,780
kind of later on and i ask them

1477
00:43:56,809 --> 00:43:58,539
three to four questions first

1478
00:43:58,539 --> 00:44:02,219
question is what do you do second

1479
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:04,590
question is why did you second

1480
00:44:04,590 --> 00:44:06,869
question is is why do you do it

1481
00:44:07,349 --> 00:44:09,579
third question is what do you hate

1482
00:44:09,579 --> 00:44:10,219
about

1483
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:12,969
about the current industry another

1484
00:44:12,969 --> 00:44:15,260
question is is what do you wish

1485
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:17,739
people knew about the industry

1486
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:19,239
right so i'm kind of it's

1487
00:44:19,449 --> 00:44:21,369
providing the pain points and i'm

1488
00:44:21,449 --> 00:44:23,139
providing kind of like the thing

1489
00:44:23,190 --> 00:44:23,409
that you

1490
00:44:23,539 --> 00:44:25,480
that you've done and that

1491
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:27,869
knowledge is enough to not only

1492
00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:31,110
provide a story for claude or for

1493
00:44:31,110 --> 00:44:31,900
ai to be

1494
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:33,789
inputted into your script but it

1495
00:44:33,789 --> 00:44:35,610
also provides a little bit more

1496
00:44:35,610 --> 00:44:37,289
context on how to actually write

1497
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:38,590
the script make sense and that

1498
00:44:39,050 --> 00:44:40,380
usually comes out to like to

1499
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:42,380
actually have really good content

1500
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:44,190
so yeah but that kind of hopefully

1501
00:44:44,190 --> 00:44:45,849
that answers your question and

1502
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:47,019
then of course having a good

1503
00:44:47,059 --> 00:44:49,670
framework that also helps a lot so

1504
00:44:49,670 --> 00:44:51,710
um yes and that exactly and that's

1505
00:44:52,139 --> 00:44:53,099
pretty much it guys that's kind

1506
00:44:53,139 --> 00:44:54,969
kind of how i we go about writing

1507
00:44:54,969 --> 00:44:56,889
content but of course this is not

1508
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,380
the only way um the other way

1509
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:00,079
that i we currently do is we we

1510
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:01,989
decide to make this a lot simpler

1511
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:03,900
for us and at this point what we

1512
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:04,300
did

1513
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:06,230
is we built poppy to make this

1514
00:45:06,230 --> 00:45:08,510
whole process simpler and easier

1515
00:45:08,510 --> 00:45:10,539
and faster and so with you guys's

1516
00:45:10,579 --> 00:45:12,300
permission i kind of want to show

1517
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:13,909
you or if you guys are open to it

1518
00:45:13,909 --> 00:45:15,579
would i be able to show you kind

1519
00:45:15,619 --> 00:45:17,190
of what it does and how you guys

1520
00:45:17,289 --> 00:45:19,000
can make some dope-ass content uh

1521
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,500
with poppy and if you'd say yes if

1522
00:45:21,539 --> 00:45:22,719
you say yes in the chat i'll make

1523
00:45:22,869 --> 00:45:24,380
it happen if you're like no don't

1524
00:45:24,550 --> 00:45:25,889
do it i don't have to either

1525
00:45:26,179 --> 00:45:27,889
they've been forced by me to uh to

1526
00:45:27,889 --> 00:45:29,699
look extensively at poppy under a

1527
00:45:29,699 --> 00:45:30,860
dress for the past while i'll

1528
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:31,900
definitely show them for someone

1529
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:32,869

1530
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:33,420

1589
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:29,760
i'm going to do is i'm going to

1590
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,159
take the the youtube framework

1591
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:33,250
stuff that i created that was used

1592
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:36,030
inside um clon and i'm going to

1593
00:47:36,030 --> 00:47:39,139
clone that template real quick so

1594
00:47:39,139 --> 00:47:41,139
i can use it and then also let me

1595
00:47:41,219 --> 00:47:41,340
show

1596
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:43,530
you guys how i actually did it

1597
00:47:43,530 --> 00:47:45,530
with poppy um it's youtube

1598
00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:47,440
brainstorming where is it

1599
00:47:49,219 --> 00:47:50,670
yep youtube research and

1600
00:47:50,889 --> 00:47:52,809
brainstorming this one so here's

1601
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:55,269
how i put that framework together

1602
00:47:55,460 --> 00:47:57,650
what i did framework for the

1603
00:47:57,650 --> 00:48:00,260
framework for that we sent to you

1604
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:03,099
guys for writing uh writing uh

1605
00:48:03,099 --> 00:48:03,500
copy

1606
00:48:03,539 --> 00:48:05,210
and writing scripts writing

1607
00:48:05,210 --> 00:48:07,059
scripts exactly so here's how i

1608
00:48:07,059 --> 00:48:08,699
did it um in terms of youtube

1609
00:48:08,710 --> 00:48:09,019
videos

1610
00:48:09,059 --> 00:48:10,570
there's like four parts right so

1611
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:11,769
we have the titles the the

1612
00:48:11,769 --> 00:48:13,389
thumbnails we have the intro and

1613
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:14,380
then the entire

1614
00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:15,989
script so what i did is i went

1615
00:48:16,090 --> 00:48:17,739
inside youtube and then i just

1616
00:48:17,739 --> 00:48:19,579
like looked up videos on how to

1617
00:48:19,590 --> 00:48:19,739
write

1618
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:22,599
good titles so and here's how this

1619
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:25,659
it's this simple right so i go to

1620
00:48:25,659 --> 00:48:28,780
youtube um and then i just say

1621
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:31,929
youtube titles there you go and

1622
00:48:31,929 --> 00:48:34,599
then all i have to do is just

1623
00:48:34,599 --> 00:48:38,289
right click uh copy link address

1624
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:38,880
come inside

1625
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:40,949
poppy and all i have to do is just

1626
00:48:41,110 --> 00:48:42,550
do command v boom and it

1627
00:48:42,639 --> 00:48:44,860
transcribes the entire thing and

1628
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:46,500
everything is there like if you

1629
00:48:46,570 --> 00:48:47,730
want to see proof i can just

1630
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:50,539
connect this to a chat and say um

1631
00:48:50,650 --> 00:48:50,940
what's

1632
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:52,619
inside this video give me a

1633
00:48:52,650 --> 00:48:54,730
comprehensive breakdown of what

1634
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:56,610
this video talks about in terms of

1635
00:48:56,730 --> 00:48:57,019
writing

1636
00:48:57,059 --> 00:48:59,260
titles let's see what it does

1637
00:49:06,659 --> 00:49:09,360
yeah there you go it transcribe

1638
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:12,110
the video in seconds yeah so the

1639
00:49:12,110 --> 00:49:15,179
the the overall goal is think of

1640
00:49:15,219 --> 00:49:16,599
like if chat tpt is only for

1641
00:49:16,889 --> 00:49:18,420
writing only for writing and just

1642
00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:20,059
talking back and forth the whole

1643
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:20,380
goal is

1644
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:22,599
to be like how can i import

1645
00:49:22,599 --> 00:49:25,449
anything i possibly uh have that

1646
00:49:25,519 --> 00:49:28,219
can be used to model or to teach

1647
00:49:28,219 --> 00:49:28,860
right which

1648
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:30,360
could be youtube videos could be

1649
00:49:30,570 --> 00:49:31,900
instagram videos could be tiktok

1650
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:33,239
videos all that content gets

1651
00:49:33,550 --> 00:49:33,980
transcribed and

1652
00:49:34,019 --> 00:49:35,789
analyzed by poppy directly um and

1653
00:49:35,789 --> 00:49:37,400
then for you to go to create new

1654
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:38,929
content and that will include

1655
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:40,050

00:50:22,530 --> 00:50:23,820
my intern who's going to be

1686
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:24,090
helping

1687
00:50:24,179 --> 00:50:25,269
me package my youtube videos

1688
00:50:25,849 --> 00:50:27,010
here's the resources i've given

1689
00:50:27,239 --> 00:50:28,929
you which i expect advice from

1690
00:50:29,269 --> 00:50:29,340
experts

1691
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:31,710
in the youtube space and created

1692
00:50:31,710 --> 00:50:33,610
for me um and then um it went

1693
00:50:33,610 --> 00:50:35,739
through the videos and then put

1694
00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:37,269
together all the frameworks like

1695
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:38,599
hey these are the cool emotions

1696
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:40,150
that you need to tap into here's

1697
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:40,300
the

1698
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:42,639
title writing guideline here's how

1699
00:50:42,639 --> 00:50:44,650
the elements should be here are

1700
00:50:44,650 --> 00:50:46,780
examples blah blah and so forth

1701
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:48,280
and then i said you know what be

1702
00:50:48,489 --> 00:50:49,960
more specific give more examples

1703
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:51,980
so it's easier for for the person

1704
00:50:51,989 --> 00:50:52,139
who's

1705
00:50:52,179 --> 00:50:53,559
who's reading to understand so i

1706
00:50:53,769 --> 00:50:54,820
came up with like hey here are

1707
00:50:54,820 --> 00:50:56,380
examples for curiosity and fear

1708
00:50:56,380 --> 00:50:57,099
here's

1709
00:50:57,139 --> 00:50:58,980
curiosity and desire problem

1710
00:50:58,980 --> 00:51:01,019
solution format so it broke down

1711
00:51:01,019 --> 00:51:02,769
the entire video into very

1712
00:51:02,889 --> 00:51:03,190
specific

1713
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:05,429
examples and then i was like all

1714
00:51:05,590 --> 00:51:07,539
right this is great now combine

1715
00:51:07,539 --> 00:51:09,260
this both and put something

1716
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:12,000
comprehensive for me um and wait

1717
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,849
some what happened oh i don't know

1718
00:51:14,849 --> 00:51:16,860
something weird happened for a

1719
00:51:16,860 --> 00:51:17,110
second

1720
00:51:17,219 --> 00:51:19,500
but that's good um but yeah and

1721
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:21,579
then it put together the entire

1722
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:24,039
framework for me and then all i

1723
00:51:24,039 --> 00:51:25,019
had to do

1724
00:51:25,059 --> 00:51:27,320
is now uh do the same thing with

1725
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:29,730
thumbnails and then intros and

1726
00:51:30,099 --> 00:51:32,380
then script writing and then these

1727
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:32,860
are all those

1728
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:34,760
frameworks and now to recreate

1729
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:36,780
what naz did here's what i'm going

1730
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:38,699
to do i'm going to go to youtube

1731
00:51:38,739 --> 00:51:40,710
and bring in some of naz's old

1732
00:51:40,869 --> 00:51:42,460
videos from years ago

1733
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:45,579
might go naz damansky

1734
00:51:45,619 --> 00:51:50,539
oh look at that hey do the one

1735
00:51:50,719 --> 00:51:53,139
where it's how i learn 84k how i

1736
00:51:53,139 --> 00:51:55,090
learn 84k cs client for example

1737
00:51:55,860 --> 00:51:57,880
that one paste this put it inside

1738
00:51:57,989 --> 00:52:00,139
the group what else do you want me

1739
00:52:00,139 --> 00:52:03,179
to bring naz uh do the one

1740
00:52:03,219 --> 00:52:05,019
where to do the one where day in

1741
00:52:05,019 --> 00:52:07,179
the life the day in the life one

1742
00:52:07,179 --> 00:52:10,460
day in the life oh yeah that one

1743
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:11,840
that was such a long time ago oh

1744
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:13,579
my god dude holy shit that was

1745
00:52:13,579 --> 00:52:15,179
like 22 years old that was a

1746
00:52:15,219 --> 00:52:16,929
major game detroit how old were

1747
00:52:16,929 --> 00:52:19,329
you 22 years old yeah i think so

1748
00:52:19,329 --> 00:52:21,179
or 21 and that's it i think that

1749
00:52:21,219 --> 00:52:22,289
you don't need any more than that

1750
00:52:22,469 --> 00:52:23,820
by the way i think two is fine um

1751
00:52:23,820 --> 00:52:26,699
awesome so we got that two

1752
00:52:26,739 --> 00:52:28,250
videos and then let's do

1753
00:52:28,409 --> 00:52:30,329
productivity videos yeah so

1754
00:52:30,409 --> 00:52:33,219
there's three three pillars one of

1755
00:52:33,380 --> 00:52:34,300
the frameworks

1756
00:52:34,340 --> 00:52:35,699
second is going to be like my

1757
00:52:36,010 --> 00:52:37,159
voice of tone and like my videos

1758
00:52:37,389 --> 00:52:37,900
my content

1759
00:52:39,059 --> 00:52:40,130
and then third will be like other

1760
00:52:40,199 --> 00:52:41,579
people's content you want to model

1761
00:52:41,579 --> 00:52:43,340
all right so let's say we need

1762
00:52:43,380 --> 00:52:45,679
to model this video well not sure

1763
00:52:45,679 --> 00:52:47,739
control copy like address copy

1764
00:52:47,739 --> 00:52:50,539
link address paste this video link

1765
00:52:50,579 --> 00:52:52,789
here and then what else did you

1766
00:52:52,789 --> 00:52:55,940
take naz there's uh there's ali

1767
00:52:55,989 --> 00:52:57,579
ali abdahl productivity hacks go

1768
00:52:57,579 --> 00:52:57,659
to

1769
00:52:57,699 --> 00:52:59,719
all the property hacks for example

1770
00:52:59,829 --> 00:53:03,530
ali abdahl productivity hacks all

1771
00:53:03,530 --> 00:53:08,699
right this one yep oh nice perfect

1772
00:53:08,739 --> 00:53:10,710
so i'm gonna copy link address

1773
00:53:10,869 --> 00:53:13,050
paste that boom all right now what

1774
00:53:13,050 --> 00:53:14,619
i'm gonna do is

1775
00:53:14,659 --> 00:53:17,260
what can you see actually you know

1776
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:19,610
i'm just gonna do this what can

1777
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:22,780
you see and tell this is like my

1778
00:53:22,820 --> 00:53:24,400
starter prompt that i like to use

1779
00:53:24,489 --> 00:53:26,019
um it's just like hey you know can

1780
00:53:26,019 --> 00:53:27,500
you just go through it see what

1781
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:27,659
you

1782
00:53:27,699 --> 00:53:29,550
can see um so it's gonna take a

1783
00:53:29,550 --> 00:53:31,599
second to go through all of them

1784
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:33,329
and then tell us what we have

1785
00:53:34,659 --> 00:53:36,510
yeah yeah because i think there's

1786
00:53:36,510 --> 00:53:38,090
yeah it's quite a lot in here i

1787
00:53:38,119 --> 00:53:38,989
think i believe

1788
00:53:39,139 --> 00:53:41,880
once it once it what's up should

1789
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:44,769
be fine yeah yeah yeah there we go

1790
00:53:48,179 --> 00:53:49,679
and then go into full screen go

1791
00:53:49,849 --> 00:53:51,409
into full screen quickly there we

1792
00:53:51,409 --> 00:53:54,940
go yep there we go all right

1793
00:53:54,980 --> 00:53:56,829
perfect so now what i'm gonna do

1794
00:53:56,829 --> 00:53:58,789
all right great so now what i want

1795
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:01,980
you to do is in the group that has

1796
00:54:02,019 --> 00:54:04,409
like my youtube videos what i want

1797
00:54:04,409 --> 00:54:06,400
you to do is use those videos to

1798
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:08,780
understand my style of talking

1799
00:54:08,789 --> 00:54:09,260
like

1800
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:11,079
the words that i use my tonality

1801
00:54:11,079 --> 00:54:13,050
my style and everything and then

1802
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:15,179
use the videos uh by ali

1803
00:54:15,219 --> 00:54:17,110
abdahl and another video that i've

1804
00:54:17,110 --> 00:54:18,969
given you about productivity to

1805
00:54:19,039 --> 00:54:20,579
kind of come up with the structure

1806
00:54:20,659 --> 00:54:21,829
for the video that i'm trying to

1807
00:54:21,829 --> 00:54:23,110
make so basically the video that

1808
00:54:23,110 --> 00:54:24,780
i'm trying to make is a video

1809
00:54:24,780 --> 00:54:25,000
around

1810
00:54:26,179 --> 00:54:27,989
five productivity hacks for

1811
00:54:27,989 --> 00:54:30,059
content creators but i want to do

1812
00:54:30,059 --> 00:54:32,860
it from my perspective now um you

1813
00:54:32,860 --> 00:54:33,019
could

1814
00:54:33,059 --> 00:54:34,909
use examples from you know those

1815
00:54:34,909 --> 00:54:36,579
videos that i've given you as

1816
00:54:36,579 --> 00:54:38,380
examples but a crucial one that i

1817
00:54:38,380 --> 00:54:38,539
want

1818
00:54:38,579 --> 00:54:40,550
to cover in as a hack for content

1819
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:42,630
creators is i want to talk about

1820
00:54:42,630 --> 00:54:45,019
my concept called one take wonder

1821
00:54:45,019 --> 00:54:45,260
which

1822
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:46,949
basically is like you know you

1823
00:54:46,969 --> 00:54:48,840
just sit down click record on your

1824
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:50,860
camera and then you don't turn off

1825
00:54:50,860 --> 00:54:50,940
the

1826
00:54:50,980 --> 00:54:52,940
recording and you just sit down

1827
00:54:52,940 --> 00:54:55,000
and then record until you finish

1828
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,619
shooting the video and then

1829
00:54:56,730 --> 00:54:56,860
whatever

1830
00:54:56,900 --> 00:54:57,969
mistakes you make whatever

1831
00:54:58,570 --> 00:54:59,719
everything you make you cut them

1832
00:54:59,719 --> 00:55:01,269
down blah blah and then do it now

1833
00:55:01,269 --> 00:55:01,820
what i

1834
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:02,949
want you to do is that's basically

1835
00:55:03,530 --> 00:55:04,710
the video that i want to make and

1836
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:06,230
what i want you to do is use the

1837
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:08,210
frameworks that i've given you

1838
00:55:08,210 --> 00:55:10,010
first come up with like three to

1839
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:12,219
five different alternative titles

1840
00:55:12,219 --> 00:55:12,380
that

1841
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:14,309
i can use for the video using the

1842
00:55:14,309 --> 00:55:16,409
title running framework and then

1843
00:55:16,449 --> 00:55:17,900
let's create three to five

1844
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:18,469
different

1845
00:55:18,659 --> 00:55:20,969
options for intros that i can do

1846
00:55:20,969 --> 00:55:23,030
and then let's also come up with

1847
00:55:23,030 --> 00:55:26,139
an outline for the entire script

1848
00:55:26,179 --> 00:55:27,250
all right so let's see what you

1849
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:30,139
can do hey i don't know what holy

1850
00:55:30,210 --> 00:55:32,230
shit i want to talk you know

1851
00:55:32,340 --> 00:55:34,150
usually what i like to do

1852
00:55:34,150 --> 00:55:36,469
personally i'd like to say hey

1853
00:55:36,469 --> 00:55:38,619
give me the titles first and then

1854
00:55:38,659 --> 00:55:38,820
i'll pick

1855
00:55:38,980 --> 00:55:40,550
a title and then i'll say yeah uh

1856
00:55:40,650 --> 00:55:42,119
from the titles now give me the

1857
00:55:42,119 --> 00:55:43,900
outline he just went all out and

1858
00:55:44,059 --> 00:55:44,059
just

1859
00:55:44,099 --> 00:55:45,559
said the full thing i'm not the

1860
00:55:45,769 --> 00:55:47,190
personal biggest fan of that but

1861
00:55:47,190 --> 00:55:48,429
that works sometimes too

1862
00:55:48,579 --> 00:55:51,849
take wonder method oh my god it

1863
00:55:51,849 --> 00:55:54,059
was one take wonder

1864
00:55:54,099 --> 00:55:58,360
but there you go why most content

1865
00:55:58,360 --> 00:56:01,079
creators failed and five

1866
00:56:01,079 --> 00:56:02,699
productivity hacks to avoid it

1867
00:56:02,699 --> 00:56:03,099
that's pretty

1868
00:56:03,139 --> 00:56:04,210
good i tested these five

1869
00:56:04,809 --> 00:56:05,969
productivity hacks for 30 days

1870
00:56:06,199 --> 00:56:08,079
here's what actually works that's

1871
00:56:08,239 --> 00:56:08,769
pretty good

1872
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:12,760
uh and then let's see what it came

1873
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:16,139
up with so problem solution

1874
00:56:16,179 --> 00:56:17,920
hook creating content consistently

1875
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:19,400
is probably the hardest part of

1876
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:20,929
being a content creator i used to

1877
00:56:20,980 --> 00:56:22,139
spend hours trying to make the

1878
00:56:22,650 --> 00:56:24,099
perfect video blah blah blah this

1879
00:56:24,099 --> 00:56:26,860
is how i used to create content

1880
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:28,670
overthinking over planning and

1881
00:56:29,130 --> 00:56:30,219
barely publishing anything and

1882
00:56:30,219 --> 00:56:31,739
this is how i create content now

1883
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:32,869
what if i told you the most

1884
00:56:33,449 --> 00:56:35,150
productive content creators don't

1885
00:56:35,150 --> 00:56:36,159
actually try to be perfect

1886
00:56:36,739 --> 00:56:38,929
discovered this when i take wonder

1887
00:56:38,929 --> 00:56:42,690
myth jesus uh big wonder you could

1888
00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:43,500
tell it'd be like the one

1889
00:56:43,539 --> 00:56:45,230
the one is like is that you could

1890
00:56:45,230 --> 00:56:46,969
actually tell it it's actually

1891
00:56:46,969 --> 00:56:48,619
it's actually a one tick take

1892
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:49,590
wonder wonder

1893
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:53,530
not wonder oh all right let's see

1894
00:56:53,530 --> 00:56:54,860
what it does now

1895
00:56:54,900 --> 00:57:06,190
all right there we go the one take

1896
00:57:06,190 --> 00:57:08,260
wonder method how i create three x

1897
00:57:08,260 --> 00:57:09,769
more content without burning out

1898
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:11,380
so yeah there you go it came up

1899
00:57:11,610 --> 00:57:13,320
with all the different titles and

1900
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:15,289
then these are titles that are

1901
00:57:15,349 --> 00:57:15,820
based on

1902
00:57:15,860 --> 00:57:17,599
frameworks that are proven right

1903
00:57:17,599 --> 00:57:19,289
so it's like you can test out like

1904
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:20,230
five different titles

1905
00:57:20,659 --> 00:57:23,010
and then you can select whichever

1906
00:57:23,010 --> 00:57:25,030
intro sounds the best for you and

1907
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:27,820
or if if you hate all these intros

1908
00:57:27,860 --> 00:57:30,050
you can say hey i absolutely hate

1909
00:57:30,050 --> 00:57:32,159
these intros um make it viral or

1910
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:34,619
like stop being a cunt or like

1911
00:57:34,659 --> 00:57:35,730
i don't know something say

1912
00:57:35,780 --> 00:57:37,269
something violent and like get it

1913
00:57:37,269 --> 00:57:39,900
to do something better uh but you

1914
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:40,219
know

1915
00:57:40,260 --> 00:57:41,900
this is like the faster way to do

1916
00:57:41,929 --> 00:57:43,690
it because like you didn't have to

1917
00:57:43,719 --> 00:57:45,420
transcribe the the videos

1918
00:57:45,460 --> 00:57:47,090
all of that is just done for you

1919
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:48,619

1920
00:57:48,619 --> 00:57:50,380

sounds exactly like him and here's

1969
00:59:22,349 --> 00:59:22,860
a funny thing

1970
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:23,960

1973
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:27,809

00:59:31,989 --> 00:59:33,489
what did you what did you do to

1977
00:59:33,619 --> 00:59:34,659
actually write like what did you

1978
00:59:34,659 --> 00:59:35,639
bring in to actually write this

1979
00:59:35,750 --> 00:59:36,889
write this newsletter like what's

1980
00:59:36,889 --> 00:59:36,940
the

1981
00:59:36,980 --> 00:59:38,150
stuff we just i'm curious we just

1982
00:59:38,309 --> 00:59:39,670
we just had to only bring in his

1983
00:59:39,670 --> 00:59:40,940
like previously written

1984
00:59:41,010 --> 00:59:41,349
newsletters

1985
00:59:41,539 --> 00:59:42,800
that's all we had to do right and

1986
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:44,139
so you all you do is that command

1987
00:59:44,139 --> 00:59:45,289
you just all you do is just

1988
00:59:45,380 --> 00:59:46,559
pasting his letter that you've

1989
00:59:46,730 --> 00:59:48,199
done before and then and then yeah

1990
00:59:48,199 --> 00:59:49,500
and then there's one more thing

1991
00:59:49,539 --> 00:59:51,219
yes connected in there and then

1992
00:59:51,219 --> 00:59:52,969
underneath it what else is there

1993
00:59:52,989 --> 00:59:54,860
um and then we have this it's a

1994
00:59:54,860 --> 00:59:55,500
it's

1995
00:59:55,539 --> 00:59:56,750
his upcoming book about lean

1996
00:59:57,210 --> 00:59:58,739
learning um that we were covering

1997
00:59:58,739 --> 01:00:01,019
in one of the newsletters there we

1998
01:00:01,019 --> 01:00:01,340
go

1999
01:00:01,380 --> 01:00:02,989
so basically again bring in

2000
01:00:03,050 --> 01:00:04,849
different elements of writing

2001
01:00:04,849 --> 01:00:06,739
bring in a different knowledge

2002
01:00:06,789 --> 01:00:07,179
between

2003
01:00:07,219 --> 01:00:09,050
your pdf documents to your um uh

2004
01:00:09,050 --> 01:00:11,170
structure the frameworks and from

2005
01:00:11,179 --> 01:00:13,260
there you can just write either

2006
01:00:13,300 --> 01:00:14,409
emails and you've got a cold

2007
01:00:14,969 --> 01:00:16,119
emails just like your just like

2008
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:17,900
yours and then after that that's

2009
01:00:17,900 --> 01:00:18,139
that's

2010
01:00:18,179 --> 01:00:19,530
pretty much all good uh that's

2011
01:00:19,750 --> 01:00:20,980
just my example for you and then

2012
01:00:20,980 --> 01:00:23,420
oh there we go and then uh

2013
01:00:23,420 --> 01:00:23,809

01:03:02,530 --> 01:03:05,820
rewrote it again and then you know

2090
01:03:05,860 --> 01:03:07,059
i just went back and forth a

2091
01:03:07,059 --> 01:03:08,360
couple of times here are the

2092
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:09,769
things that i like here are the

2093
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:10,460
things that i

2094
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:12,300
don't like and also by the way

2095
01:03:12,300 --> 01:03:14,460
what was horrible about this time

2096
01:03:14,530 --> 01:03:16,550
was back then we didn't have voice

2097
01:03:16,659 --> 01:03:18,630
prompting so i had to type all of

2098
01:03:18,789 --> 01:03:20,860
this instead of talking so it was

2099
01:03:20,860 --> 01:03:23,579
such a bad experience compared

2100
01:03:23,619 --> 01:03:25,099
to now which is now i just can

2101
01:03:25,289 --> 01:03:26,989
like hit record and then like talk

2102
01:03:26,989 --> 01:03:29,320
and give my feedback but yeah i

2103
01:03:29,369 --> 01:03:29,659
wrote

2104
01:03:29,699 --> 01:03:32,250
all of it and then it gave me the

2105
01:03:32,250 --> 01:03:34,739
entire email so uh let me just

2106
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:38,300
keep going um that's a long one

2107
01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:38,539
holy

2108
01:03:38,579 --> 01:03:40,380
shit oh yeah i mean it's a six

2109
01:03:40,380 --> 01:03:42,480
page email so it is a really long

2110
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:44,539
one but yeah this is how i use

2111
01:03:44,539 --> 01:03:45,019
poppy

2112
01:03:45,059 --> 01:03:46,789
and then this is one email we

2113
01:03:46,789 --> 01:03:48,969
wrote like five more emails after

2114
01:03:48,969 --> 01:03:50,690
this and like if i were to write

2115
01:03:50,809 --> 01:03:50,940
this

2116
01:03:50,980 --> 01:03:52,119
email all by myself it would have

2117
01:03:52,590 --> 01:03:53,670
taken me like i don't know three

2118
01:03:53,670 --> 01:03:55,019
to four hours because like i have

2119
01:03:55,019 --> 01:03:55,099
to

2120
01:03:55,139 --> 01:03:56,210
go through the video and

2121
01:03:56,809 --> 01:03:57,949
understand everything and then

2122
01:03:57,949 --> 01:03:59,449
write it versus poppy i was able

2123
01:03:59,449 --> 01:04:00,139
to like go

2124
01:04:00,179 --> 01:04:01,639
back and forth and write the

2125
01:04:01,849 --> 01:04:03,659
entire email in like five minutes

2126
01:04:03,659 --> 01:04:05,659
yeah yeah i think overall where

2127
01:04:05,659 --> 01:04:05,809
the where

2128
01:04:05,940 --> 01:04:07,500
it becomes like beautiful is like

2129
01:04:07,610 --> 01:04:09,030
your store gibberish in and then

2130
01:04:09,039 --> 01:04:10,309
amazing stuff comes out basically

2131
01:04:10,940 --> 01:04:10,940
um

2132
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:12,199
that's that's kind of the goal as

2133
01:04:12,389 --> 01:04:13,369
long as you're like you're not

2134
01:04:13,369 --> 01:04:14,570

2138
01:04:18,530 --> 01:04:20,449
understand that okay there's some

2139
01:04:20,500 --> 01:04:22,170
knowledge space needs to be

2140
01:04:22,170 --> 01:04:23,670
provided our goal is okay how can

2141
01:04:23,670 --> 01:04:24,780
provide you with that knowledge

2142
01:04:24,780 --> 01:04:24,869
right

2143
01:04:25,980 --> 01:04:26,579
and so and then i keep part as

2144
01:04:26,579 --> 01:04:28,340
well that i'm going to show like

2145
01:04:28,340 --> 01:04:29,980
tell you guys like the cool

2146
01:04:30,019 --> 01:04:31,639
thing as well that we did which is

2147
01:04:31,690 --> 01:04:33,300
some a lot of people have asked us

2148
01:04:33,300 --> 01:04:34,400
for is you know a lot of people

2149
01:04:34,900 --> 01:04:36,250
have tiktoks for example or

2150
01:04:36,570 --> 01:04:38,030
instagram videos and maybe you can

2151
01:04:38,030 --> 01:04:39,539
show like a tiktok board here a

2152
01:04:39,980 --> 01:04:39,980
model

2153
01:04:40,019 --> 01:04:42,039
too where there's no there's no

2154
01:04:42,150 --> 01:04:44,210
audio being said right it's all

2155
01:04:44,210 --> 01:04:46,110
visual and so when you paste in

2156
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:46,940
content

2157
01:04:46,980 --> 01:04:48,829
from tiktok from instagram from

2158
01:04:48,829 --> 01:04:50,650
linkedin from facebook ads for

2159
01:04:50,650 --> 01:04:52,260
example poppy will not only

2160
01:04:52,260 --> 01:04:53,980
understand the audio aspect

2161
01:04:54,019 --> 01:04:55,090
and this transcript but it will

2162
01:04:55,230 --> 01:04:56,630
also understand the visual aspect

2163
01:04:56,630 --> 01:04:58,360
it will actually watch the video

2164
01:04:58,659 --> 01:05:00,239
it will understand the text on

2165
01:05:00,329 --> 01:05:01,860
screen it will understand the

2166
01:05:01,860 --> 01:05:03,039
visual hooks it will understand

2167
01:05:03,460 --> 01:05:05,389
like we actually had this one girl

2168
01:05:05,389 --> 01:05:07,210
who where all she does is visual

2169
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:10,219
hooks and we trained poppy on

2170
01:05:10,260 --> 01:05:11,489
visual hooks and then from there

2171
01:05:11,929 --> 01:05:13,030
she was able to come up with

2172
01:05:13,030 --> 01:05:14,570
amazing new visual hooks for her

2173
01:05:14,570 --> 01:05:14,639
own

2174
01:05:14,980 --> 01:05:16,260
tiktok and instagram and that was

2175
01:05:16,650 --> 01:05:17,800
super sick and she was like what

2176
01:05:17,809 --> 01:05:18,940
no way i could do this that is

2177
01:05:18,980 --> 01:05:22,190
that is amazing oh and then it can

2178
01:05:22,190 --> 01:05:25,949
also analyze um carousels yeah

2179
01:05:25,949 --> 01:05:27,900
exactly this is a carousel right

2180
01:05:27,900 --> 01:05:28,369
so if i

2181
01:05:28,420 --> 01:05:31,190
go in here and i just paste this

2182
01:05:31,190 --> 01:05:33,769
and then if i go and say find i

2183
01:05:33,769 --> 01:05:37,579
think it was this one is it is he

2184
01:05:37,579 --> 01:05:37,579
talking

2185
01:05:37,619 --> 01:05:40,949
he doesn't talk so that's good i'm

2186
01:05:40,949 --> 01:05:44,739
gonna bring bring these two in and

2187
01:05:44,739 --> 01:05:46,980
then i'm gonna give it a second

2188
01:05:47,059 --> 01:05:49,469
so it can analyze but if i create

2189
01:05:49,469 --> 01:05:53,519
a chat connect these two and say

2190
01:05:53,710 --> 01:05:56,530
and then again this also works

2191
01:05:56,619 --> 01:05:56,909
with

2192
01:05:56,980 --> 01:05:59,659
uh facebook ads as well yes yes

2193
01:05:59,659 --> 01:06:01,800
yes yes so those of you guys who

2194
01:06:01,969 --> 01:06:02,940
make ads that'd be super helpful

2195
01:06:02,940 --> 01:06:03,039
unless

2196
01:06:03,219 --> 01:06:04,289
you love to make ads just for

2197
01:06:04,869 --> 01:06:05,960
yourself then this is completely

2198
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:07,500
useless to you um you know you

2199
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:07,590
don't

2200
01:06:07,699 --> 01:06:09,409
need to you don't need to use it

2201
01:06:09,409 --> 01:06:11,230
at all um all right so yeah what i

2202
01:06:11,230 --> 01:06:13,500
want you to do is um give me a

2203
01:06:13,539 --> 01:06:14,610
breakdown of the two instagram

2204
01:06:15,210 --> 01:06:16,860
posts that i've given you one is a

2205
01:06:16,860 --> 01:06:18,619
carousel and then one is a video

2206
01:06:18,659 --> 01:06:19,920
um for the carousel give me a

2207
01:06:20,329 --> 01:06:21,469
breakdown of what's there in the

2208
01:06:21,469 --> 01:06:22,989
visuals and then for the video

2209
01:06:23,260 --> 01:06:23,260
give

2210
01:06:23,300 --> 01:06:24,760
me a breakdown of like what's been

2211
01:06:24,969 --> 01:06:26,590
taught what's been shown and be

2212
01:06:26,590 --> 01:06:29,739
very comprehensive so let's see

2213
01:06:29,739 --> 01:06:32,300
what it does

2214
01:06:33,219 --> 01:06:37,380
um but yeah i think after this

2215
01:06:37,380 --> 01:06:39,679

01:06:41,300 --> 01:06:43,320
and then we'll go from there

2218
01:06:43,460 --> 01:06:47,179
so let's see if it actually does

2219
01:06:47,179 --> 01:06:50,119
talk about something called

2220
01:06:50,119 --> 01:06:50,539

to streamline their their tasks or

2237
01:07:30,780 --> 01:07:33,659
um basically help their employees

2238
01:07:33,699 --> 01:07:35,670
because i'm just thinking you know

2239
01:07:35,829 --> 01:07:38,699
because right now there aren't any

2240
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:40,460
really big solutions out there

2241
01:07:40,460 --> 01:07:40,699
that

2242
01:07:40,739 --> 01:07:44,329
are um that are there for a

2243
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:47,599
purpose like this so i just wanted

2244
01:07:47,599 --> 01:07:49,739
to pick you guys's brain on if

2245
01:07:49,739 --> 01:07:50,699
you've thought about something

2246
01:07:50,699 --> 01:07:50,699
like this

2247
01:07:50,739 --> 01:07:53,280
has this been in discussions or i

2248
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:55,110
mean i could send some research

2249
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:57,659
that i've done your way

2250
01:07:57,699 --> 01:07:59,349
yeah i mean for local models if

2251
01:07:59,369 --> 01:08:01,039
you're trying to build a local

2252
01:08:01,039 --> 01:08:03,019
model for like that's a whole

2253
01:08:03,019 --> 01:08:03,579
different use

2254
01:08:03,619 --> 01:08:04,889
case than like a poppy made for

2255
01:08:05,289 --> 01:08:06,800
necessarily right um we don't want

2256
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:08,780
to bring local models yet because

2257
01:08:08,789 --> 01:08:09,099
for

2258
01:08:09,139 --> 01:08:10,699
us we just want to use the best

2259
01:08:10,809 --> 01:08:12,389
model to create content um and

2260
01:08:12,389 --> 01:08:14,219
that's what 99 of our content

2261
01:08:14,239 --> 01:08:14,460
creators

2262
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:16,979
really genuinely actually just

2263
01:08:16,979 --> 01:08:19,460
care about um and also naz just to

2264
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:21,420
uh add to that it's like when you

2265
01:08:21,460 --> 01:08:23,380
say also we use content creators a

2266
01:08:23,380 --> 01:08:25,340
lot because it's like almost like

2267
01:08:25,340 --> 01:08:27,260
what our user base is 50 of our

2268
01:08:27,300 --> 01:08:29,460
user base but we also have like a

2269
01:08:29,460 --> 01:08:31,630
lot of founders i mean lucas yeah

2270
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:33,979
uh you know agency owners and like

2271
01:08:34,020 --> 01:08:35,109
we have like different audiences

2272
01:08:35,689 --> 01:08:37,560
that use poppy as well exactly but

2273
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:39,579
the answer to answer your question

2274
01:08:39,619 --> 01:08:41,079
shot like you don't need poppy for

2275
01:08:41,289 --> 01:08:42,529
that like you could just use a

2276
01:08:42,680 --> 01:08:44,369
normal llm like like a chat gpt or

2277
01:08:44,420 --> 01:08:45,489
cloud to figure out how to build

2278
01:08:45,489 --> 01:08:46,989
that right if you want to do the

2279
01:08:46,989 --> 01:08:48,539
research because you know it is

2280
01:08:48,539 --> 01:08:48,699
really

2281
01:08:48,739 --> 01:08:49,810
good with research stuff so like

2282
01:08:50,130 --> 01:08:51,039
you can bring in different

2283
01:08:51,039 --> 01:08:52,460
research points um and then have

2284
01:08:52,460 --> 01:08:52,779
it kind

2285
01:08:52,819 --> 01:08:54,239
of tell you kind of what to do at

2286
01:08:54,430 --> 01:08:55,640
the end of the day we use cloud

2287
01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:57,500
under the hood and chat gpt and

2288
01:08:57,500 --> 01:08:57,569
then

2289
01:08:57,619 --> 01:08:59,399
we allow it to use gemini and jgt

2290
01:08:59,399 --> 01:09:01,850
4.1 and all different ai models um

2291
01:09:01,850 --> 01:09:04,060
but you don't need to use it like

2292
01:09:04,100 --> 01:09:05,510
at the end of the day like if

2293
01:09:05,770 --> 01:09:07,260
that's not the primary use case

2294
01:09:07,260 --> 01:09:08,859
what poppy is made for you can

2295
01:09:08,899 --> 01:09:10,319
just use it like a normal chat gpt

2296
01:09:10,569 --> 01:09:11,720
cloud unless you really really

2297
01:09:11,949 --> 01:09:13,739
love the visual workspace which is

2298
01:09:13,779 --> 01:09:15,369
what a lot of content creators do

2299
01:09:15,449 --> 01:09:16,989
love then that's you know that's

2300
01:09:16,989 --> 01:09:18,779
where it might be somewhat useful

2301
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:18,939
to

2302
01:09:18,979 --> 01:09:20,640
you yeah see where i'm coming from

2303
01:09:20,649 --> 01:09:22,329
is some of the companies that i've

2304
01:09:22,329 --> 01:09:24,300
like personally worked at

2305
01:09:24,340 --> 01:09:25,409
that are medium-sized enterprises

2306
01:09:26,010 --> 01:09:27,500
thousand two thousand employees

2307
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:30,390
those companies yeah for the use

2308
01:09:30,699 --> 01:09:30,699
of

2309
01:09:30,739 --> 01:09:33,140
something like chat gpt or claude

2310
01:09:33,140 --> 01:09:35,090
to you know analyze a data set

2311
01:09:35,579 --> 01:09:37,659
that you input so i was thinking

2312
01:09:37,699 --> 01:09:39,970
if poppy has the ability to create

2313
01:09:39,970 --> 01:09:41,850
something local in in like a

2314
01:09:41,850 --> 01:09:43,750
company's intranet or something

2315
01:09:43,979 --> 01:09:43,979
like

2316
01:09:44,020 --> 01:09:46,189
that or put it on their sharepoint

2317
01:09:46,189 --> 01:09:48,100
um you know add or append it to

2318
01:09:48,100 --> 01:09:50,520
their sharepoint perhaps i was i

2319
01:09:50,659 --> 01:09:50,779
was

2320
01:09:50,819 --> 01:09:52,010
just trying to think out loud if

2321
01:09:52,199 --> 01:09:53,239
that's something you guys have

2322
01:09:53,239 --> 01:09:55,170
thought about or or not yeah

2323
01:09:55,909 --> 01:09:56,449
haven't

2324
01:09:56,579 --> 01:09:59,390
thought about it yet um we do have

2325
01:09:59,390 --> 01:10:02,140
a few um businesses who do use us

2326
01:10:02,140 --> 01:10:03,500
um and you know

2327
01:10:03,539 --> 01:10:05,199
consistently um we haven't had

2328
01:10:05,210 --> 01:10:07,079
enterprise companies who are like

2329
01:10:07,090 --> 01:10:08,699
oh we need to be like where it's a

2330
01:10:08,739 --> 01:10:10,149
local alarm maybe at some point in

2331
01:10:10,310 --> 01:10:11,489
the future yet again we're only

2332
01:10:11,489 --> 01:10:12,699
one year old right so like

2333
01:10:12,739 --> 01:10:14,180
we started literally about like a

2334
01:10:14,390 --> 01:10:15,560
year ago and we're just trying to

2335
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:17,979
grow um you know year a little by

2336
01:10:18,020 --> 01:10:20,390
little and so for us it's not so

2337
01:10:20,390 --> 01:10:22,390
much of not so much of a priority

2338
01:10:23,119 --> 01:10:25,180
just yet uh in the near future

2339
01:10:25,220 --> 01:10:27,079
maybe yes fair thank you okay

2340
01:10:27,079 --> 01:10:29,199
there's one question in the chat

2341
01:10:29,250 --> 01:10:31,100
here i just wanted to to bring up

2342
01:10:31,100 --> 01:10:31,260
super

2343
01:10:31,300 --> 01:10:32,989
quickly from uh srav because uh i

2344
01:10:32,989 --> 01:10:34,590
think that nazi i've actually

2345
01:10:34,590 --> 01:10:36,380
mentioned this to you before i

2346
01:10:36,399 --> 01:10:36,619
think

2347
01:10:36,659 --> 01:10:37,729
and you had a really good answer

2348
01:10:37,930 --> 01:10:39,270
for it uh he says respectfully is

2349
01:10:39,270 --> 01:10:40,380
the benefit of the visual

2350
01:10:40,380 --> 01:10:40,859
whiteboard

2351
01:10:40,899 --> 01:10:41,960
saw where you can have a visual

2352
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,300
workspace just getting the video

2353
01:10:43,300 --> 01:10:44,779
transcriptions and submitting off

2354
01:10:44,779 --> 01:10:44,810
the

2355
01:10:44,899 --> 01:10:45,970
info to a cloud project would that

2356
01:10:46,140 --> 01:10:47,329
yield the same results so like

2357
01:10:47,329 --> 01:10:48,649
what's the difference between

2358
01:10:48,739 --> 01:10:49,810
what we did earlier where we

2359
01:10:49,850 --> 01:10:51,130
uploaded all that content of a

2360
01:10:51,130 --> 01:10:52,460
cloud project and then putting it

2361
01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:53,909
in poppy i think personally the

2362
01:10:54,170 --> 01:10:55,300
outputs are better i think you

2363
01:10:55,300 --> 01:10:57,979
guys are doing some magic but yeah

2364
01:10:57,979 --> 01:10:58,300
i mean

2365
01:10:58,340 --> 01:11:00,310
if you if you have fun copying

2366
01:11:00,470 --> 01:11:02,590
transcripts and and you have fun

2367
01:11:02,590 --> 01:11:04,380
spending a bunch of time

2368
01:11:04,420 --> 01:11:06,390
copying transcripts and taking

2369
01:11:06,550 --> 01:11:08,329
that and i don't know how you get

2370
01:11:08,329 --> 01:11:09,979
a transcript even from like

2371
01:11:10,020 --> 01:11:11,989
tick tock or instagram or how you

2372
01:11:12,149 --> 01:11:14,000
would visually analyze it if you

2373
01:11:14,050 --> 01:11:15,649
have fun with that and then

2374
01:11:15,779 --> 01:11:17,430
like you you can definitely bring

2375
01:11:17,449 --> 01:11:19,239
that into clod no problem like i'm

2376
01:11:19,289 --> 01:11:21,260
honestly to be completely honestly

2377
01:11:21,300 --> 01:11:22,369
it might be somewhat similar

2378
01:11:22,970 --> 01:11:24,140
because at the end of the day we

2379
01:11:24,319 --> 01:11:26,619
do use clod right but where we add

2380
01:11:26,619 --> 01:11:27,779
i think

2381
01:11:27,939 --> 01:11:29,250
or what we're trying to get to is

2382
01:11:29,250 --> 01:11:30,489
like we're trying to be it's a

2383
01:11:30,489 --> 01:11:31,979
most like a workspace and all one

2384
01:11:31,979 --> 01:11:32,289
workspace

2385
01:11:32,500 --> 01:11:33,859
we can do anything right so for

2386
01:11:34,170 --> 01:11:35,319
example another big thing is like

2387
01:11:35,550 --> 01:11:37,340
you can add directly upload mp4

2388
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:37,739
content

2389
01:11:37,779 --> 01:11:39,489
so if you have direct mp4 content

2390
01:11:39,489 --> 01:11:41,170
you filmed yourself that is not on

2391
01:11:41,180 --> 01:11:42,529
youtube or anywhere else

2392
01:11:42,579 --> 01:11:44,479
you just directly throw that in

2393
01:11:44,479 --> 01:11:46,170
there so um to be completely

2394
01:11:46,250 --> 01:11:49,079
honest to you might not see a huge

2395
01:11:49,140 --> 01:11:50,819
difference uh but i think if you

2396
01:11:50,819 --> 01:11:52,380
love to save time then that's

2397
01:11:52,380 --> 01:11:53,510
where poppy will be a huge

2398
01:11:54,239 --> 01:11:54,619
difference for

2399
01:11:54,659 --> 01:11:56,550
you yes and also it's like hey if

2400
01:11:56,550 --> 01:11:58,720
you want to bring in say like 10

2401
01:11:58,720 --> 01:12:01,100
videos uh from like multiple

2402
01:12:01,100 --> 01:12:01,500
different

2403
01:12:01,539 --> 01:12:03,159
creators at the same time to

2404
01:12:03,210 --> 01:12:05,090
analyze and like kind of do it you

2405
01:12:05,199 --> 01:12:06,699
have to do if you were to do that

2406
01:12:06,710 --> 01:12:06,859
with

2407
01:12:06,899 --> 01:12:08,479
cloud you'll have to like do one

2408
01:12:08,569 --> 01:12:09,720
by one by one by one and like

2409
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:11,579
spend like hours to like set that

2410
01:12:11,619 --> 01:12:13,539
entire thing up versus with poppy

2411
01:12:13,539 --> 01:12:15,500
you just like boom boom boom paste

2412
01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:17,250
the links and then when you group

2413
01:12:17,380 --> 01:12:17,420
it

2414
01:12:17,460 --> 01:12:18,529
and like you can give it context

2415
01:12:19,060 --> 01:12:20,579
with like notes and stuff yeah you

2416
01:12:20,579 --> 01:12:23,100
would give them a better context

2417
01:12:23,220 --> 01:12:25,069
in terms of like how to use that

2418
01:12:25,069 --> 01:12:27,020
specific data or information

2419
01:12:27,039 --> 01:12:28,850
versus like hey these are all the

2420
01:12:28,970 --> 01:12:29,270
context

2421
01:12:29,460 --> 01:12:31,020
that you have um and then like do

2422
01:12:31,130 --> 01:12:33,260
whatever you want with it also

2423
01:12:33,260 --> 01:12:36,699
yeah jp sorry kind of jp just said

2424
01:12:36,739 --> 01:12:38,149
just said there uh the ifm

2425
01:12:38,409 --> 01:12:39,800
personally being i'm able to

2426
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:41,739
upload far more content to poppy

2427
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:42,300
than to a

2428
01:12:42,340 --> 01:12:44,220
cloud project yeah yeah that that

2429
01:12:44,220 --> 01:12:46,220
is true actually too i think we

2430
01:12:46,220 --> 01:12:48,220
have a lot more limits so like

2431
01:12:48,260 --> 01:12:49,329
as you're chatting back and forth

2432
01:12:49,529 --> 01:12:50,779
to cloud it will start to tell you

2433
01:12:50,779 --> 01:12:51,850
hey you need to create a new

2434
01:12:51,939 --> 01:12:53,960
chat at this point we kind of we

2435
01:12:54,069 --> 01:12:56,140
try to push as much as possible

2436
01:12:56,140 --> 01:12:58,020
into cloud we kind of we kind of

2437
01:12:58,359 --> 01:12:58,699
uh

2438
01:12:58,739 --> 01:13:00,710
we push it to its maximum um and

2439
01:13:00,869 --> 01:13:02,840
so we have had people who find

2440
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:04,789
that that to be a huge use case

2441
01:13:04,899 --> 01:13:06,569
too but honestly the biggest use

2442
01:13:06,569 --> 01:13:08,180
case i feel like it's just a time

2443
01:13:08,180 --> 01:13:09,819
saver like being able to upload

2444
01:13:09,859 --> 01:13:11,989
anything and see it visually i

2445
01:13:11,989 --> 01:13:14,159
personally because i we built

2446
01:13:14,159 --> 01:13:15,920
poppy for for for me and my

2447
01:13:16,060 --> 01:13:16,359
co-founder

2448
01:13:16,420 --> 01:13:17,600
like i initially built it we

2449
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:19,270
didn't build it for anybody else i

2450
01:13:19,430 --> 01:13:20,789
it was like i just wanted to build

2451
01:13:20,979 --> 01:13:22,949
something that like i love to use

2452
01:13:23,109 --> 01:13:24,909
um and i i love miro so and i love

2453
01:13:24,920 --> 01:13:27,060
seeing something visually and like

2454
01:13:27,220 --> 01:13:28,930
being to and i was like i didn't

2455
01:13:28,930 --> 01:13:30,649
see you just add ai like why can

2456
01:13:30,680 --> 01:13:32,060
they just if i have all this

2457
01:13:32,319 --> 01:13:32,460
content

2458
01:13:32,500 --> 01:13:34,250
on there it's fucking useless it's

2459
01:13:34,250 --> 01:13:35,670
like i can look at it but it's

2460
01:13:35,670 --> 01:13:37,739
fucking useless you know like like

2461
01:13:37,779 --> 01:13:39,109
what's the point of adding on

2462
01:13:39,399 --> 01:13:40,600
there if i can't do anything with

2463
01:13:40,770 --> 01:13:42,119
it so i was like why can we just

2464
01:13:42,260 --> 01:13:44,119
take that and then just combine it

2465
01:13:44,119 --> 01:13:45,810
with ai which is it does all the

2466
01:13:45,930 --> 01:13:48,300
brainstorming for us and that's

2467
01:13:48,340 --> 01:13:49,550
where i found like okay that's

2468
01:13:49,949 --> 01:13:50,800
actually a huge time saver and

2469
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:52,090
then luckily we did have a lot of

2470
01:13:52,159 --> 01:13:52,380
people

2471
01:13:52,420 --> 01:13:54,390
who found that to be very very

2472
01:13:54,550 --> 01:13:56,649
helpful um so yeah that that is

2473
01:13:56,649 --> 01:13:58,920
where i feel like would be a

2474
01:13:59,069 --> 01:13:59,819
benefit

2475
01:13:59,859 --> 01:14:00,930
more so but so maybe the visual

2476
01:14:01,100 --> 01:14:02,390
and then the the time saver is

2477
01:14:02,390 --> 01:14:03,899
where the benefit would come would

2478
01:14:03,899 --> 01:14:04,229
come from

2479
01:14:07,619 --> 01:14:08,829
yeah you got it absolutely and i

2480
01:14:09,289 --> 01:14:12,710
think you have your hand uh what's

2481
01:14:12,720 --> 01:14:16,619
up bro yeah guys when are you guys

2482
01:14:16,659 --> 01:14:19,050
increasing the limit on how much

2483
01:14:19,050 --> 01:14:20,970
content we can upload like

2484
01:14:20,970 --> 01:14:23,340
whenever i try to upload like is

2485
01:14:23,340 --> 01:14:23,979
there a hack

2486
01:14:24,020 --> 01:14:26,039
for it like is there a file

2487
01:14:26,149 --> 01:14:28,970
preference because whenever i try

2488
01:14:29,119 --> 01:14:31,260
to so the way i work is like you

2489
01:14:31,260 --> 01:14:32,060
know i would

2490
01:14:32,100 --> 01:14:33,939
so let so i i run a content agency

2491
01:14:33,939 --> 01:14:35,689
right so let's suppose i have a

2492
01:14:35,770 --> 01:14:38,149
client okay um he's a financial

2493
01:14:38,260 --> 01:14:40,789
expert he has like let's say 500

2494
01:14:40,789 --> 01:14:42,609
videos on youtube i would probably

2495
01:14:43,310 --> 01:14:45,579
scrape like 50 of his youtube

2496
01:14:45,579 --> 01:14:45,819
video

2497
01:14:45,859 --> 01:14:47,260
transcripts i would upload it and

2498
01:14:47,470 --> 01:14:48,439
like bobby would not give me

2499
01:14:48,439 --> 01:14:51,420
anything question i'm gonna break

2500
01:14:51,420 --> 01:14:51,819
you real

2501
01:14:51,859 --> 01:14:53,810
quick yeah why are you bringing in

2502
01:14:53,819 --> 01:14:56,109
50 transcripts what's the reason

2503
01:14:56,109 --> 01:14:58,699
behind it so the reason behind

2504
01:14:58,710 --> 01:14:59,260
this to like

2505
01:14:59,300 --> 01:15:01,270
grab anecdotes from what he has

2506
01:15:01,430 --> 01:15:03,500
spoken in like what he has spoken

2507
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:05,350
about in the youtube videos itself

2508
01:15:05,579 --> 01:15:05,579
so

2509
01:15:05,619 --> 01:15:08,329
like take like like basically like

2510
01:15:08,329 --> 01:15:10,689
um so it acts like a brain right

2511
01:15:10,720 --> 01:15:12,859
so like the way i also set up my

2512
01:15:12,899 --> 01:15:14,189
poppy board is like there's a

2513
01:15:14,470 --> 01:15:15,479
brain which has like all the

2514
01:15:15,479 --> 01:15:17,100
information which is basically

2515
01:15:17,100 --> 01:15:18,529
what i need to

2516
01:15:18,659 --> 01:15:20,380
write the script about like the

2517
01:15:20,380 --> 01:15:22,199
topic and then you have the voice

2518
01:15:22,319 --> 01:15:24,220
then you have um how to write the

2519
01:15:24,220 --> 01:15:24,460
script

2520
01:15:24,500 --> 01:15:25,569
so like scripting frameworks

2521
01:15:26,170 --> 01:15:27,829
youtube videos hooks videos and

2522
01:15:27,829 --> 01:15:30,539
all that shit i you you probably

2523
01:15:30,539 --> 01:15:30,590
know

2524
01:15:30,819 --> 01:15:33,100
it as well so yeah yeah yeah yeah

2525
01:15:33,100 --> 01:15:35,130
so what how do i bypass that like

2526
01:15:35,130 --> 01:15:36,869
if i want to build that brain

2527
01:15:36,979 --> 01:15:39,000
sort of a thing on poppy yeah if i

2528
01:15:39,109 --> 01:15:41,869
were you so like that we are still

2529
01:15:42,079 --> 01:15:43,659
working within the limits of like

2530
01:15:43,699 --> 01:15:46,399
ai unfortunately right and and you

2531
01:15:46,399 --> 01:15:49,329
know claude has a 200k limit uh

2532
01:15:49,449 --> 01:15:50,859
gpd 4.1 could be super helpful

2533
01:15:50,899 --> 01:15:51,970
more because it has like a 1

2534
01:15:52,489 --> 01:15:53,529
million limit so we have that now

2535
01:15:53,529 --> 01:15:55,020
added what i would suggest if i

2536
01:15:55,020 --> 01:15:55,020
were

2537
01:15:55,060 --> 01:15:56,119
you because i have a few clients

2538
01:15:56,210 --> 01:15:57,399
who i work with and they're like

2539
01:15:57,399 --> 01:15:58,449
hey how did i do it where it's

2540
01:15:58,500 --> 01:16:00,939
like i have one big brain um what

2541
01:16:00,939 --> 01:16:02,869
i would do is i'll kind of put

2542
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:04,859
together let's just say i let's

2543
01:16:04,859 --> 01:16:04,859
just

2544
01:16:04,899 --> 01:16:05,970
say i do 10 videos at a time okay

2545
01:16:06,130 --> 01:16:07,329
i'll bring in 10 videos and i'm

2546
01:16:07,329 --> 01:16:08,380
like hey give me the all the

2547
01:16:08,420 --> 01:16:09,479
anecdotes the most important

2548
01:16:09,479 --> 01:16:10,939
information from these 10 videos

2549
01:16:10,939 --> 01:16:12,010
and i'll put the other framework

2550
01:16:12,079 --> 01:16:12,300
from

2551
01:16:12,340 --> 01:16:13,979
that from those videos right first

2552
01:16:14,010 --> 01:16:15,529
right so i basically kind of like

2553
01:16:15,529 --> 01:16:16,710
would summarize or what

2554
01:16:16,899 --> 01:16:18,039
kind of summarize or get the key

2555
01:16:18,270 --> 01:16:20,130
parts out of those 10 videos first

2556
01:16:20,130 --> 01:16:22,140
and get those then then i'll bring

2557
01:16:22,180 --> 01:16:23,789
another 10 videos into a group and

2558
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:25,020
i'm like hey now could maybe give

2559
01:16:25,239 --> 01:16:26,460
me now anecdotes from there

2560
01:16:26,500 --> 01:16:28,369
uh exactly and then give the

2561
01:16:28,369 --> 01:16:30,539
structures the most important

2562
01:16:30,539 --> 01:16:32,140
things the most important quotes

2563
01:16:32,260 --> 01:16:32,539
from that

2564
01:16:32,579 --> 01:16:34,920
video okay then i do another 10

2565
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:37,529
videos another 10 so that is where

2566
01:16:37,680 --> 01:16:39,659
how you can go around it um

2567
01:16:40,260 --> 01:16:42,739
the issue with bringing 50 videos

2568
01:16:42,739 --> 01:16:44,630
is that you're going to hit a huge

2569
01:16:45,340 --> 01:16:46,619
limit where it's normal to

2570
01:16:46,659 --> 01:16:48,029
bring is 20 hours of content you

2571
01:16:48,229 --> 01:16:49,479
can connect it all to one ih at 20

2572
01:16:49,720 --> 01:16:51,010
hours of content that's usually

2573
01:16:51,460 --> 01:16:53,239
that's usually kind of what you

2574
01:16:53,239 --> 01:16:55,130
start to hit the limit of content

2575
01:16:55,130 --> 01:16:58,939
um yeah exactly but but the reason

2576
01:16:58,939 --> 01:16:59,500
why

2577
01:16:59,539 --> 01:17:00,590
it's done like that is because

2578
01:17:00,630 --> 01:17:01,899
like if you were to let's just say

2579
01:17:01,899 --> 01:17:04,289
if we were doing a way where like

2580
01:17:04,340 --> 01:17:06,050
the opposite 50 hours of content

2581
01:17:06,050 --> 01:17:07,850
or you know 100 hours of content

2582
01:17:07,850 --> 01:17:08,720
then we would have to somehow

2583
01:17:09,140 --> 01:17:10,630
like be more efficient and try to

2584
01:17:10,810 --> 01:17:11,989
figure out what's important and

2585
01:17:12,199 --> 01:17:13,510
that's something called uh

2586
01:17:13,779 --> 01:17:14,850
in in programmatic space it's

2587
01:17:14,909 --> 01:17:16,250
called using something called uh

2588
01:17:16,250 --> 01:17:17,529
what is it called like a vector

2589
01:17:17,579 --> 01:17:18,130
database

2590
01:17:18,579 --> 01:17:20,359
and exactly you start to kind of

2591
01:17:20,359 --> 01:17:22,109
pinpoint and search and it becomes

2592
01:17:22,109 --> 01:17:23,489
nasty you actually get very nasty

2593
01:17:23,539 --> 01:17:26,069
results most of the times um and

2594
01:17:26,069 --> 01:17:28,439
so right now we have a limit of

2595
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:29,600
with just ai overall

2596
01:17:29,939 --> 01:17:31,529
some point in the future i'm sure

2597
01:17:31,609 --> 01:17:33,220
we'll have like two million three

2598
01:17:33,220 --> 01:17:34,300
million four million five million

2599
01:17:34,340 --> 01:17:36,649
million just came out so no no no

2600
01:17:36,649 --> 01:17:38,979
that's still 200k there's still

2601
01:17:38,979 --> 01:17:40,140
200k lemon unfortunately

2602
01:17:40,180 --> 01:17:43,270
yeah yeah yeah yeah jacob always

01:18:28,500 --> 01:18:30,329
one of the customers recently and

2624
01:18:30,390 --> 01:18:31,260
they really have a bunch of

2625
01:18:31,300 --> 01:18:32,800
content um that's kind of what we

2626
01:18:32,970 --> 01:18:34,539
have to work with for now honestly

2627
01:18:34,539 --> 01:18:37,800
yeah try gpt try gpt try gpt 4.1

2628
01:18:37,859 --> 01:18:39,119
and try the limits of that it has

2629
01:18:39,170 --> 01:18:41,409
a million token limit try the gpt

2630
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:43,909
that's what i was coming to

2631
01:18:44,100 --> 01:18:46,609
so what i did instead so do you

2632
01:18:46,609 --> 01:18:49,270
mind if i just quickly share my

2633
01:18:49,270 --> 01:18:50,159
screen of course

2634
01:18:51,859 --> 01:18:53,720
so so this is like the poppy board

2635
01:18:53,720 --> 01:18:55,989
okay that i was talking about okay

2636
01:18:55,989 --> 01:18:57,909
so it has those kind of videos

2637
01:18:58,100 --> 01:19:04,550
okay so these are like scripting

2638
01:19:04,750 --> 01:19:05,909
frameworks hooks resources and

2639
01:19:06,010 --> 01:19:07,460
everything then it's like project

2640
01:19:07,539 --> 01:19:08,609
purpose instructions all that

2641
01:19:09,210 --> 01:19:10,359
bullshit so like i tried uploading

2642
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:11,909
this there but it didn't happen

2643
01:19:12,260 --> 01:19:14,149
but when i did it here like when i

2644
01:19:14,149 --> 01:19:16,319
uploaded the same document here it

2645
01:19:16,319 --> 01:19:17,899
actually processed it like

2646
01:19:17,939 --> 01:19:21,100
i tried processing it in gpt 4.0

2647
01:19:21,100 --> 01:19:23,800
uh in poppy but it didn't process

2648
01:19:23,800 --> 01:19:25,500
like so these were the documents

2649
01:19:25,539 --> 01:19:27,510
here like this was the data set of

2650
01:19:27,510 --> 01:19:29,449
your transcripts it did process it

2651
01:19:29,569 --> 01:19:31,170
here though but it didn't process

2652
01:19:31,220 --> 01:19:32,890
it in poppy when i uploaded it

2653
01:19:32,890 --> 01:19:35,210
like and i tried gpt 4.0 here like

2654
01:19:35,250 --> 01:19:38,060
i did not try uh no gpt 4.1 did

2655
01:19:38,069 --> 01:19:38,220
you

2656
01:19:38,260 --> 01:19:42,590
try 4.1 not 4.1 yeah try gpt 4.1

2657
01:19:43,170 --> 01:19:45,739
that one has a much bigger limit

2658
01:19:45,739 --> 01:19:46,779
i'll take a look at that

2659
01:19:46,819 --> 01:19:48,329
actually send me send me send me

2660
01:19:48,489 --> 01:19:49,840
your text and i'd love to take a

2661
01:19:49,880 --> 01:19:51,130
look at why that that was not

2662
01:19:51,220 --> 01:19:52,390
the case because it could be a

2663
01:19:52,390 --> 01:19:53,800
thing where maybe it's taking up a

2664
01:19:53,800 --> 01:19:55,100
lot of empty space that could be

2665
01:19:55,140 --> 01:19:56,789
a thing sometimes too but send me

2666
01:19:56,810 --> 01:19:58,289

01:19:58,289 --> 01:19:59,890
eight eight nine zero eight nine

2668
01:19:59,939 --> 01:20:01,760
