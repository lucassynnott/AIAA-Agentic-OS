1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,080
What's up, boys?

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:03,609
I want to make the topic of this

3
00:00:03,669 --> 00:00:05,710
video, exert shit out into the

4
00:00:05,719 --> 00:00:06,740
world, right?

5
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:08,509
This is basically about building a

6
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:09,960
social following and why you

7
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:10,759
should do it.

8
00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:11,259
Just listen

9
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,160
to what I'm saying here, right?

10
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,150
So the person actively, the person

11
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:16,550
on the journey actively

12
00:00:16,629 --> 00:00:18,030
narrating it is as interesting as

13
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:19,210
a person who has already

14
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:20,589
accomplished it, right?

15
00:00:20,589 --> 00:00:21,300
Building a

16
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,690
social following is infinite,

17
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:23,100
right?

18
00:00:23,149 --> 00:00:24,210
I'm going to get to this in a

19
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:25,379
second, but you need to chase

20
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:27,589
the infinite over the fast, right?

21
00:00:27,589 --> 00:00:29,269
So building a social following is

22
00:00:29,339 --> 00:00:30,739
about making relationships

23
00:00:30,789 --> 00:00:31,800
with people, right?

24
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,119
If you have a service or you're

25
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:34,670
selling a particular thing, what

26
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:34,840
you're

27
00:00:35,149 --> 00:00:36,549
doing with the social following is

28
00:00:36,689 --> 00:00:38,240
permanently associating your name

29
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,560
with what you do, right?

30
00:00:39,619 --> 00:00:41,009
So cold email, you think of cold

31
00:00:41,149 --> 00:00:42,469
email wizard, SEO, I think of

32
00:00:42,619 --> 00:00:44,159
Caval on Twitter, Google ads,

33
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:45,509
I think of Colin Schmelbeck,

34
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:45,939
right?

35
00:00:45,939 --> 00:00:47,460
VSL, I think of Steven Trister,

36
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:47,890
right?

37
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:48,740
It doesn't matter

38
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:50,149
if there's competition.

39
00:00:50,329 --> 00:00:51,869
What you're trying to work, your

40
00:00:51,869 --> 00:00:53,159
audience, the people by

41
00:00:53,229 --> 00:00:54,000
happenstance,

42
00:00:54,049 --> 00:00:55,799
you have found to follow you or

43
00:00:55,859 --> 00:00:57,869
engage with, or they're just in

44
00:00:57,869 --> 00:00:59,850
your sphere in some capacity,

45
00:00:59,909 --> 00:01:02,289
you're trying to work them, right?

46
00:01:02,289 --> 00:01:04,069
There is infinite shit here,

47
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:04,780
right?

48
00:01:04,859 --> 00:01:06,040
It's not about like,

49
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,959
there's no market of like, oh,

50
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:09,760
this is just the SEO market.

51
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,319
There's who you have.

52
00:01:11,319 --> 00:01:12,359
It's who you have.

53
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:15,650
You need to take those people and

54
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:19,129
over time, just associate who you

55
00:01:19,129 --> 00:01:21,730
are with that thing permanently

56
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,719
inside their head.

57
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:24,140
Where they think of that, they

58
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:25,609
think of you, just automatic,

59
00:01:25,609 --> 00:01:25,939
right?

60
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:27,640
So I want to

61
00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:28,969
talk about this real quick.

62
00:01:28,969 --> 00:01:30,239
Fast, cheap, infinite.

63
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:30,859
Ads, fast.

64
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:31,700
They're not cheap.

65
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:32,950
They're not infinite,

66
00:01:33,069 --> 00:01:33,489
right?

67
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:35,159
Cold outreach, fast and cheap,

68
00:01:35,349 --> 00:01:35,650
right?

69
00:01:35,739 --> 00:01:36,859
Not infinite though.

70
00:01:36,859 --> 00:01:38,540
You stop doing outreach, you stop

71
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:39,790
getting leads for that.

72
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:41,170
Social following is cheap and

73
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:42,879
infinite, but it's slow, but it's

74
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:43,599
infinite.

75
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:44,180
It's the

76
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:45,879
only one that is infinite.

77
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:46,659
You own it.

78
00:01:46,659 --> 00:01:48,000
It's there forever.

79
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,200
Like you've, there's a category of

80
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:50,500
people

81
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:52,430
who you've permanently associated

82
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:53,650
your thing, right?

83
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:55,319
So there's a group of people.

84
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:56,140
I'm going to talk

85
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,030
about this.

86
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,790
It's a group of people who like

87
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:00,930
over time, you offer some service

88
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:02,000
and some percent of

89
00:02:02,049 --> 00:02:03,810
them will eventually need it at

90
00:02:03,829 --> 00:02:05,599
some point and you become the de

91
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:07,219
facto option, right?

92
00:02:07,219 --> 00:02:09,080
There's no reason

93
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:10,110
on earth why any, any person

94
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:10,930
shouldn't be building and

95
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,620
following you.

96
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:12,759
This is, I want to express to you

97
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:13,199
guys.

98
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:15,139
You just need to be doing Twitter.

99
00:02:15,139 --> 00:02:16,789
You need to be doing LinkedIn.

100
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:18,340
You need to build something

101
00:02:18,349 --> 00:02:19,419
infinite, right?

102
00:02:19,419 --> 00:02:20,479
It needs to be there.

103
00:02:20,669 --> 00:02:22,180
And this is the function of why,

104
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:23,659
but kind of sensitive is so

105
00:02:23,729 --> 00:02:23,939
long.

106
00:02:24,069 --> 00:02:25,270
Why want you guys to be in here

107
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:25,819
for so long?

108
00:02:26,009 --> 00:02:27,009
Cause you need to build the

109
00:02:27,009 --> 00:02:28,180
infinite, right?

110
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:28,560
You're

111
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:30,479
here cause you knew Cody, my

112
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:32,599
wizard, or you knew Andre and you

113
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:34,560
were in our, you were in our

114
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,479
infinite.

115
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:36,789
You need to make your own

116
00:02:37,069 --> 00:02:37,520
infinite.

117
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,360
You need to have something with an

118
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,039
infinite return that's there

119
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:42,120
permanently, right?

120
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,389
It's so important, right?

121
00:02:43,389 --> 00:02:44,360
There's no ad spend.

122
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,580
There's no, there's no,

123
00:02:45,909 --> 00:02:47,629
there's no, it's just there

124
00:02:47,629 --> 00:02:48,360
forever.

125
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,669
You own it, right?

126
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,539
And if we were, if we were to look

127
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:51,879
at like

128
00:02:51,939 --> 00:02:53,080
how this kind of works out, where

129
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,270
it's like, first thing I did with

130
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:55,620
Cody and the wizard was sell Cody

131
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,280
on mastery.

132
00:02:56,449 --> 00:02:57,759
And this is how this worked out,

133
00:02:57,949 --> 00:02:58,229
right?

134
00:02:58,229 --> 00:02:59,060
Look at nothing.

135
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:00,780
Three months, like basically,

136
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:02,199
basically nothing, right?

137
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:04,020
Three months, like total of like

138
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:04,740
four grand.

139
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:06,020
You're going to do something

140
00:03:06,069 --> 00:03:08,050
for three straight months and make

141
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:09,939
like a total of, this isn't even

142
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:10,819
four grand.

143
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:13,949
It's like, you're going to do

144
00:03:13,949 --> 00:03:14,949
something for that long.

145
00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:17,870
And then just to get here, that's

146
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:18,969
what you're looking for.

147
00:03:18,969 --> 00:03:20,300
You're just trying to get there,

148
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:20,680
right?

149
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,719
You need to do this for

150
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:22,229
so long.

151
00:03:22,259 --> 00:03:23,860
Cause it's, it's the compounding

152
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:24,349
effect.

153
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:25,770
Nothing happens for so long.

154
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:26,639
And then it all

155
00:03:26,689 --> 00:03:27,949
happens at once.

156
00:03:28,229 --> 00:03:30,169
Like this is look at that fucking

157
00:03:30,169 --> 00:03:31,469
growth, right?

158
00:03:31,469 --> 00:03:32,860
This is nothing.

159
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:33,860
This seems like

160
00:03:33,909 --> 00:03:34,159
nothing.

161
00:03:34,189 --> 00:03:34,960
When you look at it from the

162
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,000
outside, Oh, three months, that

163
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,699
isn't that long until

164
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,780
you're inside of the three months

165
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:40,500
and you give up, right?

166
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,360
You need to keep going.

167
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,120
You need to,

168
00:03:44,169 --> 00:03:45,919
you need to fucking get past that.

169
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:47,729
You need to achieve the infinite.

170
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,039
You need to chase that,

171
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:49,550
right?

172
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:51,120
It's so important, right?

173
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,939
And here's what I did on Twitter.

174
00:03:52,939 --> 00:03:53,879
It's so easy.

175
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:54,949
This is what I did

176
00:03:55,009 --> 00:03:56,789
just consecutively forever.

177
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,610
Like I just did all seven of these

178
00:03:58,629 --> 00:03:59,039
months.

179
00:03:59,449 --> 00:04:00,460
This is what I did,

180
00:04:00,629 --> 00:04:01,229
right?

181
00:04:01,229 --> 00:04:03,250
It was at least three tweets, at

182
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:05,500
least 10 comments, outbound

183
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,349
comments.

184
00:04:06,349 --> 00:04:07,280
You find someone,

185
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:08,479
someone else's shit.

186
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:09,909
You comment on it, right?

187
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,479
Reply to every single comment you

188
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:12,500
get in your post.

189
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:14,400
You reply to every single DM,

190
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,009
right?

191
00:04:15,009 --> 00:04:16,439
This is, that's it.

192
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:18,579
Like, it doesn't seem so simple

193
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:19,220
until

194
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,339
you're in like week six and you're

195
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:21,300
like, Oh, this isn't doing

196
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:21,740
anything.

197
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:22,550
And then you give up.

198
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:23,829
It's because you didn't wait.

199
00:04:23,829 --> 00:04:25,050
You didn't do it long enough.

200
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:25,939
You didn't get here.

201
00:04:25,939 --> 00:04:26,839
You gave up.

202
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:28,709
So you can't do that.

203
00:04:28,709 --> 00:04:30,329
It's consecutive.

204
00:04:30,329 --> 00:04:32,850
It needs to be every single day.

205
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:35,480
Every consecutive day you do

206
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:35,800
it.

207
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,980
You pull the goal forward seven

208
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:37,500
days.

209
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,709
Every day you skip, you just

210
00:04:38,709 --> 00:04:39,639
pushed it back seven,

211
00:04:39,829 --> 00:04:40,420
right?

212
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:41,620
It's amplified.

213
00:04:41,689 --> 00:04:43,639
It's amplified on either end.

214
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:45,439
You need to do it every single

215
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:45,980
day.

216
00:04:46,029 --> 00:04:48,120
Actually zero off days, right?

217
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:50,019
You just need to get here.

218
00:04:50,139 --> 00:04:52,899
You just need to get to 120 days.

219
00:04:52,899 --> 00:04:53,220
Like you,

220
00:04:53,389 --> 00:04:55,089
you need to get the infinite,

221
00:04:55,089 --> 00:04:55,480
right?

222
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,370
And this is so easy if you really

223
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:58,839
just think about it.

224
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,720
30 minute block every single day,

225
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,180
right?

226
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:02,550
Writing content, right?

227
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:04,160
45 minute block every day,

228
00:05:04,189 --> 00:05:05,480
responding to all the comments,

229
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,959
making outbound comments, replying

230
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:07,750
to DMs, right?

231
00:05:07,769 --> 00:05:08,680
Nothing happens

232
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:09,930
for so long that you went all at

233
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:10,629
once, right?

234
00:05:10,629 --> 00:05:11,600
And do you have the mental

235
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,459
fortitude to withstand this work

236
00:05:13,509 --> 00:05:14,910
while absolutely nothing happens

237
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:16,290
while you're in month one, in

238
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:17,500
month two, in month three,

239
00:05:17,689 --> 00:05:18,610
where fucking nothing has

240
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:19,389
happened, right?

241
00:05:19,389 --> 00:05:20,589
Will you make it to month four?

242
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:22,899
Will you keep doing this in the

243
00:05:22,899 --> 00:05:23,220
face,

244
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:25,240
of it seeming completely fucking

245
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,529
pointless, right?

246
00:05:26,529 --> 00:05:27,399
Can you do that?

247
00:05:27,829 --> 00:05:29,230
Right?

248
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:31,790
How much effort will you exert to

249
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:34,360
achieve the infinite, right?

250
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,180
But you just need to stick with

251
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:36,439
it.

252
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,560
You need, in this concept, you

253
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,050
need to exist so hard.

254
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:41,759
And what I mean by that is you

255
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,230
start

256
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:42,939
building an audience.

257
00:05:43,089 --> 00:05:44,769
Is when you send a comment on

258
00:05:44,769 --> 00:05:46,660
Twitter, it shows up on your

259
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:48,220
followers timeline,

260
00:05:48,459 --> 00:05:49,769
bam, reminder that you exist,

261
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:50,180
right?

262
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,600
When you reply to comments, they

263
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,139
leave, it shows up as a

264
00:05:53,189 --> 00:05:54,420
notification for them and on the

265
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:55,560
timeline for everybody that

266
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,019
follows you, bam, reminder that

267
00:05:57,079 --> 00:05:58,089
you exist to them and everybody

268
00:05:58,089 --> 00:05:58,629
else, right?

269
00:05:58,670 --> 00:05:59,800
When you send a tweet, it shows up

270
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,459
on your followers

271
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:02,160
timeline, bam, reminder that you

272
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:03,009
exist, right?

273
00:06:03,009 --> 00:06:04,360
When somebody DMs you and you

274
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,410
reply, bam, reminder

275
00:06:05,529 --> 00:06:06,629
that you exist, right?

276
00:06:06,629 --> 00:06:08,000
You need to permanently exist

277
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,160
every single day.

278
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,550
Your followers need to get on

279
00:06:12,569 --> 00:06:13,220
Twitter.

280
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:15,069
You need to see something from you

281
00:06:15,069 --> 00:06:16,319
every fucking time.

282
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,879
Like your frequency is like they

283
00:06:18,009 --> 00:06:18,060
see

284
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:20,399
you like at least twice a day,

285
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:20,970
right?

286
00:06:21,149 --> 00:06:23,699
You just need to exist so hard for

287
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:24,370
so long.

288
00:06:24,649 --> 00:06:26,459
You just need to do

289
00:06:26,509 --> 00:06:27,319
that, right?

290
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,850
You need to always be there.

291
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:30,449
And then we start talking about

292
00:06:30,449 --> 00:06:31,779
conversion windows.

293
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:32,399
Every person

294
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:33,660
has their own conversion window,

295
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:34,009
right?

296
00:06:34,009 --> 00:06:35,149
You offer as an example, video

297
00:06:35,149 --> 00:06:36,360
editing services, right?

298
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,139
Not

299
00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:39,269
everybody is making videos right

300
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:41,209
now, but by existing so hard for

301
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,029
so long, the moment they

302
00:06:43,089 --> 00:06:44,470
need video services, they're going

303
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:45,490
to think of you, right?

304
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:46,839
Because you, you've existed so

305
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:47,240
hard for so

306
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:47,920
long, right?

307
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,970
So 1% of the people are buying

308
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:49,420
right now.

309
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:50,920
Assume you have 10,000 followers

310
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:51,430
over the course

311
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:53,000
of a year, 15% of them are going

312
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:54,449
to fall within the category of

313
00:06:54,449 --> 00:06:56,120
possibly needing video services in

314
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:56,199
the

315
00:06:56,209 --> 00:06:57,389
future, right?

316
00:06:57,389 --> 00:07:00,240
So 20, 15% of them, it's 1500

317
00:07:00,689 --> 00:07:01,120
people.

318
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,129
1% of those people are going to

319
00:07:03,129 --> 00:07:03,819
need any,

320
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:04,930
any given month.

321
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:06,939
That's 15% of people per month

322
00:07:06,939 --> 00:07:08,899
that need video editing services

323
00:07:08,899 --> 00:07:09,709
over a rolling

324
00:07:09,769 --> 00:07:10,459
period, right?

325
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:11,759
Because you're not acquiring all

326
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,160
10,000 immediately.

327
00:07:13,209 --> 00:07:14,160
It's a rolling period.

328
00:07:14,209 --> 00:07:14,639
It's up,

329
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:16,819
up, up, up, up, up, up, up.

330
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,250
It just keeps going.

331
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:20,259
And it, you never hit that if you

332
00:07:20,259 --> 00:07:22,209
don't exist so hard

333
00:07:22,269 --> 00:07:23,360
for so long, right?

334
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,040
This is how this works, right?

335
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,779
You need to talk about longevity,

336
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:27,259
right?

337
00:07:27,259 --> 00:07:27,819
You need to

338
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:28,879
be doing the same thing

339
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:30,230
consistently for so long.

340
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:31,759
It's through the persistent and

341
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:32,920
constant existence

342
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:34,879
of yourself associating with the

343
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:36,959
thing that you do, results follow,

344
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:37,639
right?

345
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:39,259
You just need to do it,

346
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:41,480
like just always, right?

347
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:43,970
You need to exert shit out into

348
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:45,050
the world.

349
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:48,069
Post on Twitter, engage.

350
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:48,639
Post on

351
00:07:48,649 --> 00:07:49,680
LinkedIn, engage.

352
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,000
Post on YouTube when you have

353
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,250
audiences here, right?

354
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,519
Cross-post to Twitter and

355
00:07:53,529 --> 00:07:54,779
LinkedIn, engage with the

356
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:55,319
comments.

357
00:07:55,379 --> 00:07:56,430
Give people attention.

358
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:58,180
As much attention as is feasibly

359
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:58,660
possible,

360
00:07:59,389 --> 00:07:59,990
right?

361
00:08:00,009 --> 00:08:01,910
Make people like you and be who

362
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:03,399
you are hard, right?

363
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:05,120
So like you don't emulate

364
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:05,459
somebody,

365
00:08:05,509 --> 00:08:06,709
you become you.

366
00:08:06,709 --> 00:08:09,360
You become you intimately, right?

367
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,670
You might, you might like the way

368
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:12,410
I speak.

369
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:12,759
You

370
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:13,680
might like the way Sam Owens,

371
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,639
Russell Brunson, Alex Becker

372
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:14,899
talks.

373
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:15,980
You need to find your voice

374
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:17,870
and figure out what your voice is

375
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:19,480
and do it so hard, right?

376
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,019
There's no way I can kind of

377
00:08:21,019 --> 00:08:21,829
describe what

378
00:08:21,899 --> 00:08:22,850
that's like until you just start

379
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:23,790
doing it and you start getting

380
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:24,300
used to it.

381
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,300
But so I can't, I can't

382
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:28,199
actually express to you like how

383
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:30,240
important this is to, to do this,

384
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:30,800
right?

385
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,080
Like you need to have

386
00:08:32,129 --> 00:08:33,779
something that is infinite.

387
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:35,629
And this, this is like, you think

388
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,639
it's so simple and you're like, it

389
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:37,899
can't

390
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,840
be that simple.

391
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,899
This is all you do.

392
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:41,720
This is literally the only fucking

393
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,529
thing you do.

394
00:08:42,529 --> 00:08:43,179
There's,

395
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,980
there's no secret, but there's no

396
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:46,100
secret behind this.

397
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,220
This is what you do.

398
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,029
I did it.

399
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:49,779
I'm not some,

400
00:08:49,789 --> 00:08:51,850
there's not some magic shit I did

401
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:53,700
to like grow my Twitter, but

402
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,600
there's no thing I did that.

403
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:55,830
It was

404
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:57,820
like, Oh, I did that.

405
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:58,759
That's it.

406
00:08:58,899 --> 00:09:01,149
But if you just do that for four

407
00:09:01,289 --> 00:09:04,320
months, it's fucking impossible.

408
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:05,809
You're not just having an

409
00:09:06,009 --> 00:09:07,799
astronomical amount of inbound.

410
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:09,659
There's literally no way this,

411
00:09:09,659 --> 00:09:10,000
this,

412
00:09:10,009 --> 00:09:12,529
there's no way this doesn't work.

413
00:09:12,529 --> 00:09:13,970
It's impossible.

414
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,220
So you guys need to do this, but

415
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:17,159
you just need to

416
00:09:17,179 --> 00:09:19,299
have a sit, you need to be doing,

417
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:21,200
you need to do LinkedIn or Twitter

418
00:09:21,649 --> 00:09:22,370
or both.

419
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:23,470
You need to do

420
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:24,299
one of these.

421
00:09:24,419 --> 00:09:26,039
You need to have something that's

422
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:27,129
infinite, right?

423
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,809
Some stuff fucking around.

424
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:29,159
Like

425
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:30,899
we need some real shit here.

426
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:32,769
Comment below this and like, let

427
00:09:32,769 --> 00:09:34,529

428
00:09:34,669 --> 00:09:34,779
Cause

429
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:36,919
