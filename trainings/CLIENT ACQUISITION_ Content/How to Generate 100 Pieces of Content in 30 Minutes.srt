1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:01,990
So when Andre asked me to come up

2
00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:04,940
and talk, I basically had two

3
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:05,400
options.

4
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:07,120
And I went with this one, give you

5
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,359
a dead simple system, generate 100

6
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:11,140
organic content ideas in 15

7
00:00:11,169 --> 00:00:11,839
minutes.

8
00:00:11,929 --> 00:00:13,509
So instead of coming up here and

9
00:00:13,509 --> 00:00:15,480
saying, you know, be authentic,

10
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,589
share your story,

11
00:00:16,649 --> 00:00:17,660
I figured let's make this

12
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:19,050
actionable, something you'll

13
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:20,649
actually put into use, so let's

14
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:21,940
get right into it.

15
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:23,690
Just a quick question so I know

16
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,359
who here is already creating

17
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:26,600
organic content.

18
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:28,359
What's the breakdown?

19
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:31,050
It could be Twitter, LinkedIn,

20
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:33,740
TikTok, YouTube, maybe OnlyFans, a

21
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:34,920
few of y'all.

22
00:00:35,009 --> 00:00:36,240
All right, good.

23
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:38,070
So like 50-50, hopefully by the

24
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:39,560
end of this, that's everyone,

25
00:00:39,579 --> 00:00:40,770
you'll be organic content

26
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:41,409
machines.

27
00:00:41,509 --> 00:00:43,609
All right, quick 30 seconds on why

28
00:00:43,609 --> 00:00:45,000
you should listen to me on

29
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:45,750
organic.

30
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:47,729
July 2018, I started working at

31
00:00:47,729 --> 00:00:49,079
BlackRock after graduating

32
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:49,719
college.

33
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:51,880
I immediately began plotting my

34
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,420
escape because the 40-year-old I

35
00:00:54,439 --> 00:00:56,679
sat next to asked for permission

36
00:00:56,759 --> 00:00:57,780
to go to his son's Little League

37
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:58,119
game.

38
00:00:58,850 --> 00:00:59,590
His boss said no.

39
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:01,429
I saw that happen and I knew my

40
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:03,369
time as a corporate worker was

41
00:01:03,369 --> 00:01:04,260
limited.

42
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:06,349
Immediately got on Twitter in July

43
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:08,760
2018, started learning.

44
00:01:08,849 --> 00:01:10,519
Finally made an account in July

45
00:01:10,519 --> 00:01:12,540
2020 to start posting.

46
00:01:12,629 --> 00:01:14,060
Built up a small audience, posting

47
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:14,980
every single day.

48
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:17,659
That let me start Ship 30, which,

49
00:01:17,659 --> 00:01:18,760
as Andre was saying, is a

50
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,359
cohort-based writing course.

51
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:22,120
Helps people start writing online.

52
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:25,099
And then I built that on the side,

53
00:01:25,099 --> 00:01:26,909
working remotely at BlackRock for

54
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:29,299
that entire year, 2021, mostly

55
00:01:29,299 --> 00:01:30,200
pretending to work.

56
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:31,629
Most finance work is pretty made

57
00:01:31,629 --> 00:01:33,480
up, especially when you're remote.

58
00:01:33,569 --> 00:01:35,109
So I was able to scale that until

59
00:01:35,109 --> 00:01:36,299
March of this year.

60
00:01:36,349 --> 00:01:37,920
I left BlackRock, finally able to,

61
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,269
or it didn't make sense for me to

62
00:01:39,269 --> 00:01:40,590
work for someone else for much

63
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:41,239
longer.

64
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:43,000
Gave Ship 30 my full attention.

65
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:45,239
Which brings us to today, sitting

66
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:47,219
280-count Twitter, we do about

67
00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:49,379
300K a month between Ship 30 and

68
00:01:49,379 --> 00:01:50,870
TypeShare at 90% margin.

69
00:01:50,989 --> 00:01:52,109
100% organic.

70
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:54,250
So I'm pretty naive.

71
00:01:54,349 --> 00:01:58,450
So I'm naive on quite a few things

72
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:02,950
on business, which is why I'm here

73
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:06,019
to learn from y'all.

74
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:07,689
But I can help you on the organic

75
00:02:07,689 --> 00:02:08,139
side.

76
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:09,639
So let's get right into it.

77
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:10,750
Like I said, how to make this a

78
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:11,539
useful keynote.

79
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:13,210
Actually do the exercise.

80
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:14,439
We're going to go through three

81
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:14,860
steps.

82
00:02:14,949 --> 00:02:15,840
You're going to be able to

83
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,189
actually generate ideas that you

84
00:02:17,189 --> 00:02:18,310
can go and create right after

85
00:02:18,349 --> 00:02:18,789
this.

86
00:02:18,909 --> 00:02:20,340
Okay.

87
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:21,759
Let's start with the single goal

88
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:23,020
of your organic content.

89
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:24,539
Daniel, you put this perfectly

90
00:02:24,539 --> 00:02:26,319
right at the very initial keynote.

91
00:02:26,409 --> 00:02:27,650
All it is is to get people to

92
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:28,370
trust you.

93
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:29,099
That's it.

94
00:02:29,189 --> 00:02:30,330
When you have something to sell,

95
00:02:30,349 --> 00:02:31,509
people are going to come to your

96
00:02:31,509 --> 00:02:32,620
profile right away and say,

97
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:34,120
is this a real person?

98
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:35,949
Do they have something useful to

99
00:02:35,949 --> 00:02:36,780
put out there?

100
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:39,180
How do we get people to trust us?

101
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:40,469
This is a great quote from

102
00:02:40,469 --> 00:02:41,180
Hormuzzi.

103
00:02:41,289 --> 00:02:43,000
Consistently provide valuable free

104
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,430
shit that is better than other

105
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:45,639
people's paid shit.

106
00:02:45,729 --> 00:02:47,199
If you take that to heart, you'll

107
00:02:47,219 --> 00:02:48,810
win the organic content game.

108
00:02:48,909 --> 00:02:50,180
But that's where most people go

109
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:50,639
wrong.

110
00:02:50,729 --> 00:02:52,530
Because right away they go, but

111
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:54,659
wait, if I give away all my free

112
00:02:54,659 --> 00:02:56,629
stuff, no one is going to buy my

113
00:02:56,629 --> 00:02:57,189
paid stuff.

114
00:02:57,289 --> 00:02:58,550
And that pulls them back because

115
00:02:58,550 --> 00:02:59,990
it's like, oh, I got all this good

116
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,159
stuff behind a paywall.

117
00:03:01,889 --> 00:03:03,750
But then they put out, you know,

118
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:05,710
non-valuable free shit, shitty

119
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:07,280
free shit, if you will.

120
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:09,199
And no one ends up buying it.

121
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:10,430
So that's the first belief to

122
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:11,750
break if you're going to win the

123
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:12,979
organic content game.

124
00:03:13,069 --> 00:03:14,800
It's realizing people do not pay

125
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,039
for information.

126
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:17,479
They pay for accountability,

127
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:19,379
implementation, packaging, speed,

128
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:20,219
and outcomes.

129
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:22,560
So if you're sitting on valuable

130
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,280
paid shit, start giving it away

131
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:24,919
for free.

132
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:26,400
Because what that's going to do is

133
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,789
immediately generate trust with

134
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,419
people who will eventually buy it.

135
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:31,900
So how do we get people to trust

136
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:32,419
us?

137
00:03:32,509 --> 00:03:33,319
We need ideas.

138
00:03:33,409 --> 00:03:35,139
And this is the system I use to

139
00:03:35,139 --> 00:03:37,099
generate my content ideas.

140
00:03:37,189 --> 00:03:38,580
It's the system we teach in Ship

141
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:39,150
30.

142
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,319
It usually takes us an hour, so

143
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:41,469
I'm going to run through it very

144
00:03:41,469 --> 00:03:41,949
quickly.

145
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:43,060
But you should be able to kind of

146
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:43,520
keep up.

147
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:44,539
It's got three parts.

148
00:03:44,949 --> 00:03:46,500
First, the two-year test.

149
00:03:46,569 --> 00:03:47,389
We're going to find topics to

150
00:03:47,389 --> 00:03:47,919
write about.

151
00:03:48,009 --> 00:03:49,150
You're going to ask yourself a

152
00:03:49,169 --> 00:03:50,370
bunch of questions of all the

153
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:51,699
things you've done over the last

154
00:03:51,699 --> 00:03:52,139
two years.

155
00:03:52,229 --> 00:03:53,080
And then you're going to get

156
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,150
specific where you're the only

157
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:55,819
person on earth who's qualified to

158
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:57,349
talk about those topics.

159
00:03:58,710 --> 00:03:59,610
Then you're going to find your

160
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:00,259
Scroll Stopper.

161
00:04:00,349 --> 00:04:01,629
That's a one-sentence line of

162
00:04:01,629 --> 00:04:03,189
credibility that you're going to

163
00:04:03,189 --> 00:04:04,550
reuse hundreds and hundreds and

164
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:06,169
hundreds of times to generate a

165
00:04:06,169 --> 00:04:07,710
ton of content ideas based on

166
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:08,180
that.

167
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:09,800
Then you're going to run your

168
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,620
Scroll Stopper through the 4A

169
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:13,259
framework, which are all these

170
00:04:13,259 --> 00:04:14,490
proven paths and approaches to

171
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:15,740
generate organic content.

172
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:17,189
Once you have this system, you'll

173
00:04:17,189 --> 00:04:18,259
never run out of ideas.

174
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:19,920
It'll be much harder to actually

175
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,680
not create content than to create

176
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:23,519
content because of how many things

177
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:24,379
you have up.

178
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:25,870
And I know people who are taking

179
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:27,069
pictures, I'll distribute all

180
00:04:27,069 --> 00:04:27,980
these slides after.

181
00:04:28,069 --> 00:04:29,620
So you can make sure.

182
00:04:29,709 --> 00:04:31,290
This will all make more sense at

183
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:32,259
the end, too.

184
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:33,490
There's a lot on one slide.

185
00:04:33,589 --> 00:04:35,019
But this slide, if you have, you

186
00:04:35,019 --> 00:04:37,110
can create 100 ideas in 15 minutes

187
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:37,699
or less.

188
00:04:37,779 --> 00:04:37,990
All right.

189
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:38,620
Y'all ready?

190
00:04:38,709 --> 00:04:40,079
All right.

191
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:40,500
Let's do it.

192
00:04:40,589 --> 00:04:41,959
Part one, the topic.

193
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:43,040
Let's figure out what you're going

194
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:43,949
to create content about.

195
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,189
So what topic are you going to

196
00:04:45,189 --> 00:04:46,529
write about, create videos,

197
00:04:46,529 --> 00:04:47,560
whatever it is, or what

198
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,439
specifically.

199
00:04:48,529 --> 00:04:50,459
The P here is specificity is a

200
00:04:50,459 --> 00:04:51,259
secret.

201
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:52,029
I'm going to show you all how to

202
00:04:52,029 --> 00:04:52,529
get specific.

203
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:54,339
But the very first thing is the

204
00:04:54,339 --> 00:04:55,009
two-year test.

205
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:56,720
So the goal of the two-year test

206
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,360
is to find all of the ideas that

207
00:04:58,379 --> 00:05:00,420
are now extremely obvious to you

208
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:01,860
but are incredibly valuable to

209
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:02,389
others.

210
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:04,019
And the reason it's two years is

211
00:05:04,019 --> 00:05:05,660
because all the things you have

212
00:05:05,689 --> 00:05:07,620
done in the last two years are now

213
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,629
extremely obvious to you

214
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:10,949
but would have been incredibly

215
00:05:10,949 --> 00:05:12,389
valuable to have two years ago.

216
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:13,680
So you're going to brainstorm

217
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,110
skills you've built, struggles

218
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:16,420
you've faced, hobbies you've

219
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:17,839
picked up, problems you've

220
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:18,399
overcome,

221
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:19,850
life transitions, stories, all of

222
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:20,259
those.

223
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:21,790
That is all the raw material that

224
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:23,360
you create organic content about.

225
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:24,589
And the way to think about it is

226
00:05:24,629 --> 00:05:25,949
what are all the things you know

227
00:05:25,949 --> 00:05:27,379
now that you'd do anything to have

228
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:28,540
known two years ago?

229
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:30,279
That is all the raw material.

230
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,199
So you start with that.

231
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:32,259
You do the two-year test.

232
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:33,750
And then once you figure out those

233
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,230
ideas, then you're just going to

234
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:36,459
start repeating them.

235
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:38,629
So throughout this, I'm going to

236
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:39,910
use some examples from the start

237
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:40,600
of the show.

238
00:05:40,689 --> 00:05:41,699
Cold email wizard.

239
00:05:41,779 --> 00:05:42,779
So if you were doing this, Dan,

240
00:05:42,779 --> 00:05:44,129
you could go, okay, I moved to

241
00:05:44,129 --> 00:05:45,959
Miami, then moved back to Tampa,

242
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:47,269
learned cold email,

243
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:49,139
grew to 100 count Twitter, started

244
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:50,730
a YouTube channel, right, started

245
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:52,060
a group coaching business,

246
00:05:52,149 --> 00:05:53,160
scaled an input product to a

247
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,300
million dollars a year.

248
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:55,410
These are all things you could

249
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:56,000
write about.

250
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:57,560
Potentially my favorite, though,

251
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,930
most importantly, scaled and

252
00:05:58,939 --> 00:06:00,699
optimized, a high-converting hinge

253
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,259
funnel.

254
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:02,649
I think if you made a YouTube

255
00:06:02,649 --> 00:06:04,279
video on that or gave a keynote on

256
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:05,839
it, I think we'd all be taking a

257
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:06,759
lot of notes.

258
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:08,399
So just some content ideas for

259
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:08,810
you.

260
00:06:08,899 --> 00:06:10,089
So this would be Daniel's, right?

261
00:06:10,209 --> 00:06:11,339
He's got a bunch of broad topics

262
00:06:11,339 --> 00:06:12,660
he could write about, and that's

263
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:13,339
number one.

264
00:06:13,509 --> 00:06:14,839
So everyone sitting here has a ton

265
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:16,199
of unique experiences that they

266
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:17,649
could generate ideas about, and

267
00:06:17,649 --> 00:06:18,610
that's where you start with.

268
00:06:18,709 --> 00:06:21,550
So part two, adding specificity.

269
00:06:21,649 --> 00:06:22,720
This is the most important part

270
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,000
and where most people go wrong.

271
00:06:24,089 --> 00:06:25,420
So what you have to do from here

272
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:26,920
is generate three to four broad

273
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,509
topics like we talked about,

274
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:29,930
but now you're going to add

275
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:31,800
specificity until you are the only

276
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:33,629
person on earth qualified to talk

277
00:06:33,629 --> 00:06:34,879
about that thing.

278
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:36,500
How do you do that?

279
00:06:36,589 --> 00:06:37,579
Well, this is where most people go

280
00:06:37,579 --> 00:06:37,939
wrong.

281
00:06:38,019 --> 00:06:38,899
So I'm going to use Daniel's

282
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:40,170
example of scaling an info product

283
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:41,279
to a million bucks a year.

284
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:43,930
There's a big, as, you know, we're

285
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:45,519
inundated with this, but that's a

286
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,750
broad topic, right?

287
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:47,949
No specificity, tons of

288
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:49,709
competition, plenty of people have

289
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:50,420
done this.

290
00:06:50,509 --> 00:06:51,649
So if you just came out and said,

291
00:06:51,689 --> 00:06:53,040
hey, I did this, there's going to

292
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,300
be a lot of competition.

293
00:06:54,389 --> 00:06:55,300
So what you have to do is get

294
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:55,860
specific.

295
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:56,519
How do you do that?

296
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:58,470
Seven specificity levers.

297
00:06:58,569 --> 00:06:59,930
Price, problem, industry,

298
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:01,769
location, situation, experience,

299
00:07:01,769 --> 00:07:02,769
and demographic.

300
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:04,339
You've dialed those up and down

301
00:07:04,339 --> 00:07:05,949
until you were the only person on

302
00:07:06,019 --> 00:07:07,290
earth who's done this.

303
00:07:07,389 --> 00:07:08,519
So some examples.

304
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:10,550
Seven ways to niche down.

305
00:07:10,629 --> 00:07:12,459
I'm going to take the same $1

306
00:07:12,459 --> 00:07:14,379
million a year product idea or

307
00:07:14,379 --> 00:07:16,250
product scaling and run it through

308
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:16,600
each of them.

309
00:07:16,689 --> 00:07:18,420
And what you'll see here is each

310
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:20,379
of these, how the content changes

311
00:07:20,379 --> 00:07:21,670
based on that one little

312
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:23,300
differentiator, right?

313
00:07:23,389 --> 00:07:24,769
One word completely changes the

314
00:07:24,769 --> 00:07:26,230
type of content you would create

315
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:26,860
based on.

316
00:07:26,949 --> 00:07:28,579
So niche down by price.

317
00:07:29,089 --> 00:07:31,399
A $299 product versus $4,000.

318
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:32,500
Much different.

319
00:07:32,589 --> 00:07:34,040
The tactics, everything you would

320
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,540
share would be much different.

321
00:07:35,629 --> 00:07:36,529
The type of person you would

322
00:07:36,529 --> 00:07:37,879
attract would be much different.

323
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:39,410
My problem, so a cold email

324
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:41,069
product or an organic content

325
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,779
product, way different.

326
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:43,930
And this is also, if you're

327
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:45,459
creating a business yourself, you

328
00:07:45,459 --> 00:07:46,610
can think about doing these

329
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:47,180
things.

330
00:07:47,389 --> 00:07:48,790
You can apply this seven ways to

331
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:50,410
niche down where you specify your

332
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:51,740
offer so it differentiates

333
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:52,490
yourself.

334
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:53,639
Industry.

335
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:55,779
So B2B SaaS, small group fitness.

336
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:56,680
Location.

337
00:07:56,769 --> 00:07:58,600
LA film agency or New York City

338
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,240
restaurant, right?

339
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:01,079
Situation.

340
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:02,709
For personal trainers or recently

341
00:08:02,709 --> 00:08:03,829
laid off employees.

342
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:05,389
Experience.

343
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:06,819
Beginner versus a 10-year veteran

344
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:07,699
cold email product.

345
00:08:08,069 --> 00:08:09,180
Again, much, much different.

346
00:08:09,269 --> 00:08:10,699
And then lastly, demographics.

347
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,329
So for Gen Z entrepreneurs or for

348
00:08:12,329 --> 00:08:13,829
up-and-coming money Twitter

349
00:08:13,829 --> 00:08:15,680
hustlers, which is exactly what

350
00:08:15,769 --> 00:08:16,240
Daniel did again.

351
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:17,910
So you can dial all of these up

352
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:19,879
and down until you take your broad

353
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:21,649
topics and you get extremely

354
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:22,439
specific with them.

355
00:08:22,529 --> 00:08:24,100
So back to Daniel's example.

356
00:08:24,189 --> 00:08:25,290
Scaling an info product to a

357
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:26,500
million dollars a year.

358
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:27,860
Not very specific.

359
00:08:27,949 --> 00:08:29,740
Scaling a beginner cold email

360
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:31,189
video info product for

361
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,080
up-and-coming money Twitter

362
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,500
hustlers on gumroad

363
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:35,870
to a million dollars a year using

364
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:37,399
only organic content in just 12

365
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:37,918
months.

366
00:08:38,418 --> 00:08:38,538
Right?

367
00:08:38,629 --> 00:08:40,460
You're the only person on Earth

368
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:41,658
who has done it.

369
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,220
Which means every single thing you

370
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,480
have to say about that will be

371
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,549
100% unique.

372
00:08:45,649 --> 00:08:47,299
No one will compare you to anyone.

373
00:08:47,389 --> 00:08:48,950
You're going to actually generate

374
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:50,529
true fans where, like you said,

375
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:51,700
people buy from you.

376
00:08:51,789 --> 00:08:52,460
They don't buy that thing.

377
00:08:52,549 --> 00:08:54,740
That make sense so far?

378
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:55,299
You guys with me?

379
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:56,379
Cool.

380
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:56,759
All right.

381
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:57,720
So by now, you should have three

382
00:08:57,730 --> 00:08:58,789
to five kind of topics, right?

383
00:08:58,889 --> 00:08:59,779
Things that are ruining your head

384
00:08:59,779 --> 00:09:00,299
a little bit.

385
00:09:00,389 --> 00:09:01,299
All right.

386
00:09:01,389 --> 00:09:01,840
Deep breath.

387
00:09:01,929 --> 00:09:03,070
Because I know that was a lot.

388
00:09:03,169 --> 00:09:04,200
That's part one.

389
00:09:04,289 --> 00:09:05,340
Part one.

390
00:09:05,429 --> 00:09:07,059
Now you have ideas to write about.

391
00:09:07,149 --> 00:09:07,740
What do we do from here?

392
00:09:08,419 --> 00:09:09,370
Now you need to find your scroll

393
00:09:09,389 --> 00:09:10,059
stopper.

394
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:10,889
This one's simple.

395
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:12,129
You need a one-sentence line of

396
00:09:12,169 --> 00:09:13,570
credibility for why people should

397
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:14,809
trust you that you're going to

398
00:09:14,809 --> 00:09:16,039
reuse it time and time and time

399
00:09:16,049 --> 00:09:16,899
and time again.

400
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,899
And everything you have to say

401
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:21,179
after that is going to be, okay, I

402
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:22,200
trust you.

403
00:09:22,289 --> 00:09:23,500
You can go in 100 different

404
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,120
directions.

405
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,169
If you need a template for this,

406
00:09:26,179 --> 00:09:27,440
extremely easy.

407
00:09:27,529 --> 00:09:28,590
But once you have one, you can

408
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:29,080
reuse it.

409
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:31,570
So over the last X time period, I

410
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:34,269
achieved X outcome without common

411
00:09:34,269 --> 00:09:37,179
obstacle to achieving X outcome.

412
00:09:37,269 --> 00:09:39,210
Every person in this room can make

413
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:41,200
up a scroll stopper based on their

414
00:09:41,299 --> 00:09:43,139
topic with that exact one.

415
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:45,120
And right away, once you have

416
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,759
that, everything you create after

417
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:48,240
it is going to resonate with that

418
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,500
reader who says, oh, I'm

419
00:09:49,529 --> 00:09:50,600
interested in that.

420
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:52,039
Or I can trust you on that.

421
00:09:52,129 --> 00:09:52,830
Now I'll listen to what you have

422
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:53,120
to say.

423
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:55,539
So again, for Daniel, I actually

424
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:57,120
went and wrote these tweets.

425
00:09:57,159 --> 00:09:58,539
I made a cold email whiz account.

426
00:09:58,580 --> 00:09:59,700
I'm surprised it wasn't taken.

427
00:09:59,789 --> 00:10:02,039
So over the last 12 months, I

428
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:04,389
scaled my cold email info product

429
00:10:04,389 --> 00:10:06,500
to a million dollars per year

430
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,139
without spending a cent on paid

431
00:10:08,139 --> 00:10:08,559
ads.

432
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:09,440
100% organic.

433
00:10:09,889 --> 00:10:11,230
You could see that if that was the

434
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:12,769
intro to any Twitter thread, what

435
00:10:12,769 --> 00:10:14,149
he could put after that would be

436
00:10:14,149 --> 00:10:14,879
valuable.

437
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:15,799
People are going to listen because

438
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:16,799
they're going to go, oh, shit.

439
00:10:16,889 --> 00:10:18,090
You could write almost anything

440
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:18,720
after that.

441
00:10:18,809 --> 00:10:19,740
Same with this.

442
00:10:19,789 --> 00:10:21,200
I built a group coaching biz from

443
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,779
zero to 300K in three months

444
00:10:22,779 --> 00:10:24,240
without taking my margins below

445
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:24,889
75%.

446
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:27,259
Enter just about anything.

447
00:10:27,309 --> 00:10:28,720
I started three SaaS companies,

448
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,269
scaled them to 50K a month in six

449
00:10:30,269 --> 00:10:31,779
months without a single full-time

450
00:10:31,779 --> 00:10:32,480
employee.

451
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:34,039
You have these lines, and then you

452
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:35,690
can drop anything underneath, and

453
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:37,169
people are going to need it.

454
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:39,659
And then my personal favorite, my

455
00:10:39,659 --> 00:10:41,220
Hinch profile brings me 25

456
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,149
qualified leads per day with a 50%

457
00:10:43,149 --> 00:10:43,919
close rate,

458
00:10:44,009 --> 00:10:46,179
and my clients are submitting rate

459
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:47,419
testimonials.

460
00:10:47,549 --> 00:10:50,120
Right?

461
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:51,200
True?

462
00:10:51,289 --> 00:10:51,899
True?

463
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,700
I think that close rate's a little

464
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:54,120
low.

465
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:54,940
I almost bumped it up.

466
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:55,980
I almost bumped it to 90, but I

467
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,120
was like, okay, let's be real.

468
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:57,480
Let's do it.

469
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:59,539
All right, so with that, right,

470
00:10:59,549 --> 00:11:01,539
you can say just about anything on

471
00:11:01,549 --> 00:11:02,960
that topic, and people are going

472
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:03,360
to read it.

473
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:04,919
So that's your scroll stopper.

474
00:11:05,029 --> 00:11:06,929
Scroll stopper makes sense.

475
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:07,879
So we've got topic, we've got

476
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:08,519
scroll stopper.

477
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:10,500
Part three, we're flying through

478
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,039
this.

479
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:12,330
The 4A framework.

480
00:11:12,429 --> 00:11:13,750
So now you're going to take that

481
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,340
scroll stopper and squeeze as much

482
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:16,820
juice out of it as you possibly

483
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:17,120
can.

484
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:18,240
How do you do that?

485
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:19,220
The 4A framework.

486
00:11:19,309 --> 00:11:20,850
The 4A framework says there's only

487
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:22,009
four types of content.

488
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:24,419
Actionable content, analytical

489
00:11:24,419 --> 00:11:25,279
content.

490
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:27,110
So actionable is here's how.

491
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:28,899
Analytical is here's a breakdown.

492
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:31,200
Aspirational is yes, you can, like

493
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,659
sharing your story.

494
00:11:33,309 --> 00:11:35,070
Anthropological is human nature,

495
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:35,679
the why.

496
00:11:35,769 --> 00:11:37,179
And so all of these are, every

497
00:11:37,179 --> 00:11:38,850
piece of content falls into one of

498
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:40,059
these four buckets.

499
00:11:40,149 --> 00:11:42,519
An example to drive this home.

500
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:44,259
Anyone here read personal finance

501
00:11:44,259 --> 00:11:44,779
books?

502
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:45,620
Right?

503
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:46,960
This is Money Twitter.

504
00:11:47,049 --> 00:11:47,879
We all do.

505
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:48,370
Right?

506
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:49,659
Can you name a couple?

507
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:50,440
What are the couple that come to

508
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:50,679
mind?

509
00:11:50,769 --> 00:11:52,500
Rich, dad, more dad.

510
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:53,840
Rich, dad, more dad.

511
00:11:53,929 --> 00:11:54,919
Who said one?

512
00:11:55,009 --> 00:11:55,559
Right?

513
00:11:55,669 --> 00:11:57,210
Okay.

514
00:11:57,429 --> 00:11:58,639
So what's cool about personal

515
00:11:58,639 --> 00:11:59,929
finance is a big, big, broad

516
00:11:59,929 --> 00:12:00,440
topic.

517
00:12:00,529 --> 00:12:01,960
But within that, once you see the

518
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,629
4A buckets, you're never going to

519
00:12:03,649 --> 00:12:04,860
look at content the same

520
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:05,080
again.

521
00:12:05,169 --> 00:12:07,259
Because we have Ramit Sethi, who's

522
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:09,100
built an entire career around

523
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,700
actionable content.

524
00:12:10,789 --> 00:12:12,429
His book is I Will Teach You to Be

525
00:12:12,429 --> 00:12:12,960
Rich.

526
00:12:13,049 --> 00:12:14,190
If you've read that, it's

527
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,909
literally got scripts to negotiate

528
00:12:15,909 --> 00:12:17,600
with your cable company or your

529
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,019
airline.

530
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:19,580
Like, straight up actionable.

531
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:22,159
And you have Ray Dalio, right?

532
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,440
I studied a thousand economies for

533
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,529
thousands of years, and I put it

534
00:12:26,529 --> 00:12:28,120
all together into this

535
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:28,440
breakdown.

536
00:12:28,529 --> 00:12:30,440
So this is extremely innovative.

537
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:33,129
And you have aspirational.

538
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:34,429
Rich, dad, poor dad.

539
00:12:34,529 --> 00:12:35,019
Right?

540
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:36,210
If you came from a poor money

541
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:37,759
background, then here's how to get

542
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:38,320
over it.

543
00:12:38,409 --> 00:12:39,059
Here's my story.

544
00:12:39,149 --> 00:12:40,230
You read that, you resonate with

545
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:40,980
it, or you don't.

546
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:43,259
And then lastly, psychology money.

547
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:45,350
Anthropological, totally human

548
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:46,559
nature, right?

549
00:12:46,649 --> 00:12:46,919
The water.

550
00:12:47,289 --> 00:12:48,840
Here's one big, broad topic,

551
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,580
money, with four examples.

552
00:12:50,669 --> 00:12:52,080
And so as you take your scroll

553
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,809
stopper, you can dig and go up and

554
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:54,960
down all of these and

555
00:12:55,049 --> 00:12:56,460
say, I want to share actionable,

556
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:57,919
analytical, aspirational, or

557
00:12:57,919 --> 00:12:58,919
anthropological.

558
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:00,610
So, some examples.

559
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:02,429
Actionable content, this is how

560
00:13:02,429 --> 00:13:02,779
to.

561
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:04,610
Anything like tips, tools, hacks,

562
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,409
advice, resources, frameworks,

563
00:13:06,409 --> 00:13:07,480
ultimate guides.

564
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:08,960
Let the reader go from point A to

565
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,529
point B, and you're going to show

566
00:13:10,529 --> 00:13:11,769
them how to get there.

567
00:13:11,889 --> 00:13:14,700
Some examples.

568
00:13:14,789 --> 00:13:15,929
And so, how I'm going to show you

569
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:17,169
with this is taking your scroll

570
00:13:17,169 --> 00:13:18,149
stopper, your single

571
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:20,120
line of credibility, and combining

572
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,779
it with the 4A framework.

573
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:23,450
Because once you have it, you can

574
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:24,950
reuse it in infinite number of

575
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:25,799
ways, right?

576
00:13:25,899 --> 00:13:26,419
So, here's Danny.

577
00:13:26,509 --> 00:13:28,490
Over the last 12 months, scaled my

578
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:30,190
cold email to a million bucks per

579
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:31,419
year without a cent on

580
00:13:31,509 --> 00:13:31,889
paid ads.

581
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:33,269
Here's six software tools that

582
00:13:33,269 --> 00:13:33,990
made it easy.

583
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:35,559
Or, here are three tips if you're

584
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:37,039
stuck at 10K a month.

585
00:13:37,129 --> 00:13:38,720
Or, here are three resources to

586
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,000
help you do the same.

587
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:41,799
Or, here's the four-step system

588
00:13:41,799 --> 00:13:43,149
you can follow to scale your info

589
00:13:43,149 --> 00:13:43,559
front.

590
00:13:43,649 --> 00:13:44,179
Right?

591
00:13:44,269 --> 00:13:45,740
Any single thing actionable, he

592
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,389
could follow up his scroll stopper

593
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:48,639
with, just like that.

594
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:49,750
You can do that time and time and

595
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:50,960
time again, especially when you

596
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,860
find one that works.

597
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:53,500
Which of this one would work very

598
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:53,970
well?

599
00:13:54,019 --> 00:13:55,360
I mean, it's YouTube videos, it's

600
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,690
LinkedIn, it's everything.

601
00:13:56,789 --> 00:13:58,340
You can use it just like that.

602
00:13:58,429 --> 00:13:58,940
Right?

603
00:13:58,990 --> 00:13:59,620
So, that's actionable.

604
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:01,240
Then there's analytical.

605
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:02,440
These are breakdowns.

606
00:14:02,529 --> 00:14:03,779
Think of examples, things of doing

607
00:14:03,779 --> 00:14:04,299
research.

608
00:14:04,889 --> 00:14:06,269
Anything, you save the reader a

609
00:14:06,269 --> 00:14:07,809
lot of time and say, hey, I looked

610
00:14:07,809 --> 00:14:08,639
at a thousand different

611
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:09,159
landing pages.

612
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,159
Here's what's working.

613
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:12,350
Trends, numbers, reasons, swipe

614
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:13,679
files, examples.

615
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:15,299
Helps your reader see a new way of

616
00:14:15,299 --> 00:14:16,000
thinking.

617
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:17,230
Or, watch her.

618
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:18,340
This is usually written content,

619
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,190
but it can be anything.

620
00:14:19,289 --> 00:14:21,230
So, some more examples.

621
00:14:21,299 --> 00:14:22,909
I started three SaaS companies,

622
00:14:22,909 --> 00:14:24,690
scaled them at 50K a month in six

623
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:25,259
months.

624
00:14:25,389 --> 00:14:27,039
Here's a slide-by-slide teardown

625
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:27,940
of the funnel.

626
00:14:28,029 --> 00:14:29,529
Or, here's a breakdown of each

627
00:14:29,539 --> 00:14:31,519
landing page and why they convert.

628
00:14:32,129 --> 00:14:33,549
Or, here's the exact numbers we do

629
00:14:33,549 --> 00:14:34,990
each month and where we're going

630
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:35,659
from here.

631
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,440
Or, here's what I think B2B SaaS

632
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,940
is heading in the future.

633
00:14:39,029 --> 00:14:40,450
So, these are analytical, looking

634
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:41,629
at trends of where things are

635
00:14:41,629 --> 00:14:43,200
going or breakdowns of why

636
00:14:43,289 --> 00:14:43,690
things are working.

637
00:14:43,809 --> 00:14:46,679
Third, anthropological.

638
00:14:46,769 --> 00:14:47,799
We're flying here.

639
00:14:47,889 --> 00:14:49,419
These are anything to do with

640
00:14:49,419 --> 00:14:50,409
human nature.

641
00:14:50,509 --> 00:14:51,690
So, it digs a level deeper.

642
00:14:51,809 --> 00:14:52,279
It's a why.

643
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:52,980
It's a psychology.

644
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:55,059
So, fears, failures, struggles,

645
00:14:55,059 --> 00:14:57,269
paradoxes, comparisons, red pills,

646
00:14:57,269 --> 00:14:57,860
right?

647
00:14:57,950 --> 00:14:58,740
Why others are wrong.

648
00:14:58,830 --> 00:14:59,639
Why you've been misled.

649
00:15:00,049 --> 00:15:01,559
Anything to do with the human

650
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:03,190
nature that says, okay, maybe

651
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:04,340
here's how to do something.

652
00:15:04,429 --> 00:15:06,309
Let's dig a level deeper and look

653
00:15:06,309 --> 00:15:07,399
at here's why.

654
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:10,220
So, even more examples.

655
00:15:10,269 --> 00:15:11,580
I built a group coaching biz from

656
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:13,149
zero to 300K in six months.

657
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:14,700
Here are four brutal mistakes that

658
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,090
almost cost me everything.

659
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:17,629
Or, here are three beliefs I had a

660
00:15:17,629 --> 00:15:18,519
break to get to.

661
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:20,440
Here's why everyone else struggles

662
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:22,139
to keep their margins high.

663
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:23,700
Or, here are three observations

664
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,100
that surprise me, right?

665
00:15:25,389 --> 00:15:26,710
This is all human nature, the

666
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:27,720
psychology of it.

667
00:15:27,809 --> 00:15:29,379
And, I think this is one of the

668
00:15:29,379 --> 00:15:31,360
most interesting content buckets

669
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,799
you can have because everyone

670
00:15:32,889 --> 00:15:34,360
has a unique understanding of why

671
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:35,899
things are working for them.

672
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:37,230
If you can help a reader or viewer

673
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:38,639
understand that, you're going to

674
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:39,590
really develop a deep

675
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:40,429
relationship.

676
00:15:40,549 --> 00:15:42,450
Lastly, on the four A's,

677
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:43,889
aspirational.

678
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:45,909
So, this is anything sharing your

679
00:15:45,909 --> 00:15:46,299
story.

680
00:15:46,389 --> 00:15:47,460
Every single person here can share

681
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:48,019
their story.

682
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:49,379
That's the easiest one to do.

683
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:50,919
Whatever your two-year test was

684
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:52,460
for the journey you took over the

685
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:54,100
last two years, you can share

686
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:54,320
them.

687
00:15:54,409 --> 00:15:55,870
So, these are stories, lessons

688
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:57,649
from stage reflections, underrated

689
00:15:57,679 --> 00:15:58,889
traits, advice to your past

690
00:15:58,889 --> 00:15:59,070
seller.

691
00:15:59,169 --> 00:16:01,190
My favorite, here.

692
00:16:01,289 --> 00:16:02,820
If you were sharing, how do you

693
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:04,409
scale and optimize your hinge

694
00:16:04,539 --> 00:16:05,100
profile?

695
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,179
Here's what my clients have to

696
00:16:07,179 --> 00:16:07,519
say.

697
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,899
So, you're sharing testimonials.

698
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:10,169
I'd like to read that one.

699
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:11,850
Here's how you can create a funnel

700
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:12,830
like this, too.

701
00:16:12,929 --> 00:16:14,379
Here's my story.

702
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:15,549
Or, here's what I had to change to

703
00:16:15,549 --> 00:16:16,370
make this happen.

704
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:17,690
So, this is all just sharing your

705
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:19,200
story and giving someone a resume.

706
00:16:19,289 --> 00:16:21,080
All right.

707
00:16:21,169 --> 00:16:22,519
That was the entire NLS idea

708
00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:23,320
generator.

709
00:16:23,409 --> 00:16:24,080
That was a lot.

710
00:16:24,169 --> 00:16:25,279
We usually take about an hour for

711
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:25,620
that.

712
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:26,600
So, let's do a quick recap.

713
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:28,379
The goal of this keynote, I said,

714
00:16:28,379 --> 00:16:30,419
give you a system to generate 100

715
00:16:30,419 --> 00:16:30,980
ideas.

716
00:16:31,029 --> 00:16:32,429
I hope the ideas are flowing, that

717
00:16:32,429 --> 00:16:33,529
you can go and put this into

718
00:16:33,529 --> 00:16:34,659
practice right away.

719
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:35,860
Hopefully, you were doing it while

720
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:36,320
we were going.

721
00:16:36,409 --> 00:16:37,870
The single goal of your organic

722
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:39,769
content, get people to trust you.

723
00:16:39,889 --> 00:16:40,289
That's it.

724
00:16:40,389 --> 00:16:41,330
How do you get people to trust

725
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:41,639
you?

726
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:43,500
Consistently provide valuable free

727
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,240
share that is better than everyone

728
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,039
else's page.

729
00:16:46,129 --> 00:16:47,190
If you do that, you will win the

730
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:48,149
organic content game.

731
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:48,740
We'll stop.

732
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:50,539
Started with the topic.

733
00:16:50,629 --> 00:16:51,679
What are you going to write about?

734
00:16:51,769 --> 00:16:52,629
How are you going to be specific

735
00:16:52,649 --> 00:16:53,000
with it?

736
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:54,360
We did the two-year test.

737
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:55,700
Look back on your last two years.

738
00:16:55,789 --> 00:16:56,899
Every person in this room has

739
00:16:56,899 --> 00:16:58,309
unique things they can talk about

740
00:16:58,309 --> 00:16:59,750
over the last two years that

741
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:00,139
they've learned.

742
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:01,419
You just have to get comfortable

743
00:17:01,419 --> 00:17:02,480
sharing those things.

744
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:04,098
Seven ways to niche down.

745
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,279
One, I love this slide.

746
00:17:05,348 --> 00:17:07,109
I think this slide applies far

747
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,869
more than just content, but

748
00:17:08,869 --> 00:17:10,220
business as well.

749
00:17:10,309 --> 00:17:12,470
Then you create your scroll

750
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:13,480
stopper.

751
00:17:13,568 --> 00:17:14,309
Use this template.

752
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:15,828
Over the last X time period, I

753
00:17:15,828 --> 00:17:17,609
achieved X outcome without common

754
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:18,338
obstacles.

755
00:17:18,529 --> 00:17:19,220
You have that.

756
00:17:19,309 --> 00:17:20,318
You have infinite number of

757
00:17:20,318 --> 00:17:21,440
organic content ideas.

758
00:17:21,529 --> 00:17:23,700
Then you look at the 4A paths.

759
00:17:23,789 --> 00:17:25,190
Hopefully, you start to look at

760
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:26,230
content in a new way,

761
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:27,740
which is every single thing you

762
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:28,920
read or come across is one of

763
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,519
these buckets.

764
00:17:29,609 --> 00:17:30,940
What's the type of content that

765
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:31,960
you resonate with?

766
00:17:32,049 --> 00:17:33,059
What's the type of content that

767
00:17:33,059 --> 00:17:34,359
your reader is resonating with?

768
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:36,019
Then I showed you this example to

769
00:17:36,019 --> 00:17:37,750
drive it home with four different

770
00:17:37,809 --> 00:17:38,650
4A buckets.

771
00:17:38,769 --> 00:17:40,640
There it is all in one slide

772
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,430
again.

773
00:17:41,529 --> 00:17:43,759
If you download that slide, take

774
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:45,319
it home, print it out, do this

775
00:17:45,319 --> 00:17:46,009
exercise.

776
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:47,369
And if you take 15 minutes, it's

777
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:48,640
going to be very hard not to

778
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,099
create organic content from there.

779
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:51,480
So, boom.

780
00:17:51,569 --> 00:17:52,380
Any questions?

781
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:53,920
Let's do it.

782
00:17:54,049 --> 00:18:11,759
I have one thing.

783
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:12,960
I have one thing to sell you.

784
00:18:13,049 --> 00:18:14,190
