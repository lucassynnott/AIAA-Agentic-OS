1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:01,659
- What's up guys, Lucas here.

2
00:00:01,889 --> 00:00:02,640
Today I'm gonna be showing you

3
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:05,059
the RSS auto feed to content

4
00:00:05,059 --> 00:00:06,190
pipeline.

5
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:08,720
So this is a very interesting one.

6
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:09,640
I'm gonna be showing you a few

7
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:10,519
elements of this as well.

8
00:00:10,609 --> 00:00:11,480
Not only am I gonna be showing you

9
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:12,880
how this workflow works,

10
00:00:12,919 --> 00:00:14,039
I'm gonna show you how to create

11
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:16,350
your own curated RSS feeds

12
00:00:16,489 --> 00:00:18,329
of YouTube channels, Twitter

13
00:00:18,329 --> 00:00:19,120
accounts,

14
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:20,550
just trends and mentions in the

15
00:00:20,899 --> 00:00:21,039
media,

16
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:21,870
anything you wanna follow

17
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:23,109
and you wanna talk about in your

18
00:00:23,109 --> 00:00:23,219
content

19
00:00:23,579 --> 00:00:24,230
so that you can create

20
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:24,850
personalized feeds

21
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:27,079
and then feed this in order to

22
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:27,530
create

23
00:00:27,969 --> 00:00:30,489
perfect LinkedIn posts for you.

24
00:00:30,609 --> 00:00:31,890
So let's take a look at this first

25
00:00:32,298 --> 00:00:33,140
and see what we've got.

26
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:34,710
So the first thing I've set up as

27
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:35,200
usual,

28
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:37,000
all you need here is Slack.

29
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:38,329
You'd open router set up.

30
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:40,159
I have perplexity out of, not

31
00:00:40,189 --> 00:00:41,520
necessary really,

32
00:00:41,649 --> 00:00:42,859
but I like having perplexity for

33
00:00:43,229 --> 00:00:43,719
extra research.

34
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,869
And then we have bloatato for

35
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:46,799
scheduling,

36
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,640
which we went over in one of the

37
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,359
previous scheduling

38
00:00:49,509 --> 00:00:51,469
was a multi-content platform

39
00:00:51,469 --> 00:00:52,119
factory,

40
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:53,369
multi-platform content factory

41
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:53,799
video.

42
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:56,719
But it's pretty simple.

43
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:57,820
bloatato kind of just gives you an

44
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,609
API key from bloatato

45
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:01,009
and you paste it in there.

46
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,390
Slack as usual is just gonna be

47
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:05,280
the connect to Slack button.

48
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:07,620
And then open writer is your API

49
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:08,719
key for open writer.

50
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:12,640
So what this does essentially is

51
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,870
every, I think it's four hours.

52
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:16,290
Yeah, every four hours, what this

53
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,159
does is it runs

54
00:01:18,409 --> 00:01:20,790
and it pulls content from these

55
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,840
different RSS feeds.

56
00:01:22,969 --> 00:01:24,879
Now I've got TechCrunch in here.

57
00:01:24,939 --> 00:01:26,219
I've got Hacker News.

58
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:27,359
I've got Crunchbase.

59
00:01:27,489 --> 00:01:30,760
I've got AI trends and I've got a

60
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:31,989
wired and their AI business

61
00:01:31,989 --> 00:01:32,400
section.

62
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:34,290
So this was gets the latest news

63
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:35,950
from these outlets, right?

64
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,420
This one up here, rss.app, this is

65
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:40,719
my custom one.

66
00:01:40,849 --> 00:01:42,099
So if you actually go to the

67
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,189
website, rss.app and log in,

68
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:46,379
you can create feeds from pretty

69
00:01:46,379 --> 00:01:48,560
much any social media platform.

70
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:51,069
So if I click add feed here, see,

71
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:52,400
you can choose our web page,

72
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:54,680
an Instagram feed, Twitter page,

73
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,959
TikTok, Reddit, literally

74
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:57,280
anything.

75
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,530
There's loads of options down

76
00:01:58,599 --> 00:01:59,400
here, right?

77
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:01,480
Then you can also just use topics.

78
00:02:01,569 --> 00:02:03,040
So you can just take a topic and

79
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,359
it'll find the best place to get

80
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:04,799
like that.

81
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,939
So like, you know, e-commerce, if

82
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:06,950
you're about e-com a lot,

83
00:02:07,019 --> 00:02:08,288
or you're running an e-com agency,

84
00:02:08,569 --> 00:02:10,330
there's a ton of different ones in

85
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:10,930
there.

86
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:13,539
And once you've added all of them,

87
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,479
I've added some stuff from Fazio,

88
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:16,729
some other kind of marketing

89
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:17,860
accounts and people I follow on

90
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:18,199
Twitter,

91
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:20,280
you can then create a bundle.

92
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,530
A bundle, what it does is it

93
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:23,169
combines all of these feeds into

94
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:23,830
one feed.

95
00:02:24,009 --> 00:02:25,210
So I'll go to bundle.

96
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,580
I click add bundle.

97
00:02:26,889 --> 00:02:28,590
You can just select everyone and

98
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:29,560
I've already done this.

99
00:02:29,689 --> 00:02:31,270
And now I've got a feed here that

100
00:02:31,349 --> 00:02:32,599
has all the content

101
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:34,379
from all those accounts all in

102
00:02:34,389 --> 00:02:34,919
here.

103
00:02:35,129 --> 00:02:38,120
So once you have that, then all

104
00:02:38,219 --> 00:02:39,879
you do is you copy this,

105
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:43,840
your bundle URL up here and in and

106
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,210
then you're just going to paste it

107
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:46,039
in here.

108
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,389
And the next thing we have here is

109
00:02:48,389 --> 00:02:49,960
a keyword filter.

110
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:51,300
This filters for your particular

111
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:52,099
topic.

112
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:53,080
So you're going to want to change

113
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,129
this depending on what topic you

114
00:02:55,129 --> 00:02:56,080
want to talk about.

115
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:58,939
For me, it has to contain the word

116
00:02:58,939 --> 00:02:59,159
AI.

117
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,400
If it doesn't contain AI, it

118
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,719
doesn't continue through.

119
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:03,710
That's cause I talk mainly about

120
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:04,120
AI.

121
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:05,449
So as you can see here from this

122
00:03:05,469 --> 00:03:06,840
one, we got two items.

123
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:08,090
We got five from here.

124
00:03:09,449 --> 00:03:11,319
We got a known from here.

125
00:03:11,449 --> 00:03:13,370
We got four from here, 10 items

126
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:14,520
here, six items here.

127
00:03:14,729 --> 00:03:16,259
Then this aggregates it all

128
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:18,800
together and we merge it all into

129
00:03:19,009 --> 00:03:20,039
one item.

130
00:03:20,189 --> 00:03:21,379
Then we just wait to make sure

131
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:22,439
that that's done.

132
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:24,789
And then we take aggregate again,

133
00:03:24,789 --> 00:03:26,520
all the information and we send it

134
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,280
to our AI agent.

135
00:03:28,409 --> 00:03:29,639
Now you will have to edit this as

136
00:03:29,699 --> 00:03:30,120
well.

137
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:30,969
I'm going to show you how we set

138
00:03:30,969 --> 00:03:32,120
up this AI agent prompt.

139
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:33,039
Cause this is actually very

140
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:33,500
interesting.

141
00:03:34,569 --> 00:03:36,580
So the user prompt is fine.

142
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:37,800
It just tells it that it's make it

143
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,569
1500, 2000 character LinkedIn

144
00:03:39,669 --> 00:03:40,120
post.

145
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,449
And then it has all of our

146
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,590
different information from the RSS

147
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:44,430
feeds here.

148
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:44,819
Right.

149
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:48,310
But if we go to the system

150
00:03:48,389 --> 00:03:50,120
message, this is where things get

151
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:50,680
kind of important.

152
00:03:50,849 --> 00:03:51,639
You have to change this.

153
00:03:51,849 --> 00:03:53,719
Look for this reference document

154
00:03:53,719 --> 00:03:54,039
one.

155
00:03:54,169 --> 00:03:55,949
And if you scroll down, you'll see

156
00:03:55,949 --> 00:03:57,159
there's reference document two.

157
00:03:57,289 --> 00:03:59,009
You're going to want to change all

158
00:03:59,009 --> 00:03:59,639
of this.

159
00:03:59,849 --> 00:04:00,969
Cause this is about you.

160
00:04:01,129 --> 00:04:02,680
This is about all my information.

161
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:04,060
This is where it is given the AI

162
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:05,569
context in who I am, what I want

163
00:04:05,669 --> 00:04:06,919
to talk about, like the

164
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:08,900
kind of different, uh, uh, you

165
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,319
know, topics that I cover, things

166
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:10,879
like that.

167
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:12,789
So what I would suggest doing is

168
00:04:12,789 --> 00:04:14,879
copy all this, go to chat GBT,

169
00:04:15,009 --> 00:04:16,589
paste it in and say,

170
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,029
I want to rewrite this for me

171
00:04:18,389 --> 00:04:19,209
specifically.

172
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:21,319
I am whoever, you know, I run it

173
00:04:21,319 --> 00:04:23,399
as this I'm from this place.

174
00:04:23,459 --> 00:04:24,769
Uh, here's what I, I, you know, I

175
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:25,319
do.

176
00:04:25,379 --> 00:04:27,290
I have my background, uh, my

177
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:27,930
offer.

178
00:04:28,089 --> 00:04:29,300
And if you're using chat GBT a lot

179
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:31,069
already, it will should have some,

180
00:04:31,069 --> 00:04:31,879
uh, memory about who

181
00:04:32,009 --> 00:04:33,129
you are like to kind of start

182
00:04:33,129 --> 00:04:33,560
from.

183
00:04:33,689 --> 00:04:34,899
And we'll rewrite this for you and

184
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,170
just paste that in there.

185
00:04:36,329 --> 00:04:37,449
You of course can just fill it out

186
00:04:37,449 --> 00:04:38,350
manually yourself.

187
00:04:38,649 --> 00:04:40,689
Just the, um, uh, name, location,

188
00:04:40,689 --> 00:04:43,360
roles, background, uh, your offer,

189
00:04:43,389 --> 00:04:44,110
all that sort of stuff.

190
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:46,060
The second reference document

191
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:46,990
tells it how to write high

192
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:48,040
converting LinkedIn posts.

193
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:48,839
So don't change that.

194
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:50,629
But after we do that, we get a

195
00:04:50,629 --> 00:04:52,040
LinkedIn post out.

196
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:52,920
That is really good.

197
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:54,810
And then we're going to send this

198
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:56,360
to ourselves in Slack.

199
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:59,449
So, uh, the way this works is that

200
00:04:59,449 --> 00:05:00,759
it sends it to you and wait for

201
00:05:00,779 --> 00:05:01,959
you to approve it or

202
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:03,079
disapprove of it.

203
00:05:03,139 --> 00:05:04,240
So you can see what the post looks

204
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:04,449
like.

205
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:05,589
Um, this is actually a really good

206
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:05,930
one.

207
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:06,939
Someone Hacker News has pointed

208
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:08,100
out that the current AI boom looks

209
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:09,000
eerily similar to

210
00:05:09,129 --> 00:05:10,250
the automobile boom in Detroit

211
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:11,319
circa 1910.

212
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:12,569
After Ford's Model T success,

213
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,319
nearly 2000 car companies were

214
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:14,790
founded.

215
00:05:15,209 --> 00:05:16,120
99% failed.

216
00:05:16,269 --> 00:05:17,370
Only Ford, GM, and Chrysler

217
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:17,959
survived.

218
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:18,920
Sound familiar?

219
00:05:19,129 --> 00:05:20,290
Today, Anthropic just raised $13

220
00:05:20,709 --> 00:05:23,220
billion at $183 billion valuation.

221
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:24,310
Their revenue exploded from $1

222
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:25,459
billion to $5 billion in just

223
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,120
eight months.

224
00:05:26,329 --> 00:05:27,319
Meanwhile, open AI is dealing with

225
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:28,670
safety concerns, rolling out new

226
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:29,240
protections.

227
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,230
The industry is consolidating

228
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:31,720
around giants with massive capital

229
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,129
requirements

230
00:05:32,449 --> 00:05:33,449
creating nearly insurmountable

231
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:34,350
barriers to entry.

232
00:05:34,529 --> 00:05:35,220
But here's where it gets

233
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:36,439
interesting for agency owners.

234
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,579
In the early auto days, the real

235
00:05:37,579 --> 00:05:38,470
winners weren't just the

236
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:39,240
manufacturers.

237
00:05:39,329 --> 00:05:40,019
They were the businesses that

238
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,009
figured out how to leverage the

239
00:05:41,029 --> 00:05:41,800
technology to transform

240
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,759
their operations.

241
00:05:42,889 --> 00:05:43,959
The same is happening now.

242
00:05:44,019 --> 00:05:45,160
As an agency owner, you don't need

243
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,279
to build the next cloud or GBT.

244
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:47,529
You need systems that turn these

245
00:05:47,579 --> 00:05:48,839
tools into revenue engines.

246
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:50,019
The agencies thriving right now

247
00:05:50,019 --> 00:05:50,920
aren't just using AI.

248
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:52,019
They're fundamentally rebuilding

249
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:53,240
their operations around automation

250
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,360
and AI-native workflows.

251
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:55,350
I'm seeing it firsthand.

252
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:56,389
Agencies that treat AI as just

253
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,560
another tool are struggling.

254
00:05:57,689 --> 00:05:58,699
While those building proprietary

255
00:05:58,699 --> 00:05:59,709
systems and workflows around these

256
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,600
platforms are scaling

257
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:01,850
rapidly and profitably.

258
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:03,000
The opportunity isn't competing

259
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,029
with Anthropic or open AI.

260
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:05,230
It's building your business to

261
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:06,730
harness their capabilities in ways

262
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:07,560
your competitors haven't

263
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:08,439
figured out yet.

264
00:06:08,569 --> 00:06:09,769
What's your agency's AI strategy?

265
00:06:09,889 --> 00:06:10,720
Are you using the tools or your

266
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:12,120
architecting systems to transform

267
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,000
how you deliver value?

268
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:14,339
Great post.

269
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:15,319
Really good, right?

270
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:17,370
Now, when this runs, I will get a

271
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:18,120
message in Slack.

272
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:18,839
So you're going to have to change

273
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:19,970
your, obviously, connection with

274
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:20,360
your Slack.

275
00:06:20,449 --> 00:06:21,350
And then you got to send it to a

276
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:22,279
channel or to yourself.

277
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,160
And it will send it here.

278
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:26,500
You see, then we have a response

279
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:27,930
type is approval, approve, and

280
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:28,360
disapprove.

281
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:30,500
You'll see two buttons in Slack.

282
00:06:30,649 --> 00:06:32,290
You can change, let's say, approve

283
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:33,079
or decline.

284
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,069
You can change the labels there.

285
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:35,810
And then I decline this because I

286
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:37,319
just want to post on LinkedIn

287
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:37,949
right now.

288
00:06:38,089 --> 00:06:39,290
But if you approve it, it will

289
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:41,319
take the post and it will post it

290
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:43,480
to, it'll schedule it

291
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:44,579
in Botato to post to your

292
00:06:44,579 --> 00:06:45,240
LinkedIn.

293
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:46,399
Obviously in Botato, you'll have

294
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:47,389
to have your LinkedIn connected

295
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:47,720
up.

296
00:06:48,089 --> 00:06:50,470
And if not, if you say no, it just

297
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:51,550
finishes the workflow.

298
00:06:51,689 --> 00:06:53,959
So that's basically it.

299
00:06:54,089 --> 00:06:54,949
When you send this to active, this

300
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,040
will just roll in automatically

301
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,000
every four hours.

302
00:06:57,149 --> 00:06:59,139
And every four hours or so, you

303
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,759
will get a message in Slack with,

304
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:02,759
"Hey, here's your new post.

305
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:03,480
Do you want to post it?"

306
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:04,810
And you say yes or no.

307
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,589
Really simple way to run your

308
00:07:06,629 --> 00:07:07,959
content pipeline.

309
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:09,079
And obviously you can customize

310
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:11,480
this as well for your clients.

311
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:12,459
If you're running a content

312
00:07:12,459 --> 00:07:14,509
agency, just, you know, obviously

313
00:07:14,509 --> 00:07:16,120
get the feeds of and create

314
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:17,490
feeds of the topics that they talk

315
00:07:17,899 --> 00:07:19,180
about or the people that they kind

316
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:19,959
of want to emulate.

317
00:07:20,209 --> 00:07:22,110
Give it your own kind of maybe

318
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:24,050
tweaks on their voice and style in

319
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:25,560
the AI agent prompt and you

320
00:07:25,649 --> 00:07:26,100
are good to go.

321
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:28,959
So I think it's going to be a

322
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:31,850
super useful one, very easy, very

323
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:32,680
simple to run.

324
00:07:32,829 --> 00:07:33,930
Automate your LinkedIn for you

325
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:34,519
pretty much.

326
00:07:34,889 --> 00:07:36,990
And yeah, I think it's very cool

327
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,079
that you can customize your own

328
00:07:38,149 --> 00:07:38,480
RSS feeds.

329
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:39,560
Make sure to check that out,

330
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,519
rss.app.

331
00:07:40,649 --> 00:07:41,300
Just sign up.

332
00:07:41,449 --> 00:07:43,079
And again, new feed, add the stuff

333
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:44,680
from wherever you want to add it

334
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,399
from, and then create a bundle

335
00:07:46,569 --> 00:07:47,689
and add all those feeds to a

336
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,910
bundle that you will then take the

337
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:51,879
URL of up here and send,

338
00:07:52,089 --> 00:07:54,610
put it pasted into your RSS node

339
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:57,209
here and you're good to go.

340
00:07:57,449 --> 00:07:59,620
Also make sure to remember to edit

341
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:00,790
the keyword filter for whatever

342
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:01,959
topic you want to talk about.

343
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:03,329
Hope this is helpful and I will

344
00:08:03,709 --> 00:08:05,160
see you guys in the next one.

345
00:08:05,529 --> 00:08:05,879
Peace.
