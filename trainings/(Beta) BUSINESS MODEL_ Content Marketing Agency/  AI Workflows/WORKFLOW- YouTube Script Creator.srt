00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,209
What's up guys, Lucas here.

2
00:00:01,459 --> 00:00:02,310
Today I'm going to be showing you

3
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:04,219
guys a detailed YouTube script

4
00:00:04,219 --> 00:00:05,410
creator, a automation.

5
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:06,910
And essentially what this does is

6
00:00:07,059 --> 00:00:08,500
you submit client information, it

7
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:09,640
researches the client,

8
00:00:09,769 --> 00:00:11,189
it does a ton of different AI

9
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,099
agents to craft a perfect YouTube

10
00:00:13,099 --> 00:00:15,199
video, then it will create

11
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:16,920
a Google Doc, it'll put it into

12
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,739
your client's folder, and it will

13
00:00:18,739 --> 00:00:20,019
send you an email with

14
00:00:20,179 --> 00:00:21,179
the flow or you can email it

15
00:00:21,179 --> 00:00:22,769
directly to the client, whichever

16
00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:23,969
you'd prefer, and alert

17
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,460
you in Slack that the script is

18
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:26,079
created.

19
00:00:26,329 --> 00:00:27,510
So I'm going to start by walking

20
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:29,329
you through step-by-step what this

21
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:30,179
flow looks like and

22
00:00:30,489 --> 00:00:31,929
what it does, and then show you

23
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:33,280
the elements that you will

24
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:35,049
probably have to authenticate

25
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,130
when you add it to your own

26
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:36,700
account.

27
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:37,990
You shouldn't have to actually

28
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:39,929
edit really anything here, so

29
00:00:39,979 --> 00:00:41,460
maybe one element I'll show

30
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,750
you, but you will have to connect

31
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:44,880
up your accounts and authenticate

32
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,469
them as I showed you in previous

33
00:00:46,759 --> 00:00:47,810
videos in the N8N section.

34
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:49,729
So let's start off by zooming in

35
00:00:49,729 --> 00:00:51,659
on the first part, what you call

36
00:00:51,659 --> 00:00:53,299
the client intake system

37
00:00:53,429 --> 00:00:54,350
and what this does and what it

38
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:54,960
looks like.

39
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:56,780
So the first part is a form, on

40
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:57,939
form submission.

41
00:00:57,939 --> 00:00:59,140
So N8N's got a very basic form

42
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:00,600
builder that works really well.

43
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,159
So we've created a form and I've

44
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,829
got pinned information here.

45
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:05,099
This just means that I've already

46
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:06,079
run this and I've pinned the

47
00:01:06,109 --> 00:01:06,849
results here.

48
00:01:06,989 --> 00:01:08,159
So I submitted this form.

49
00:01:08,379 --> 00:01:09,670
As you can see here, the questions

50
00:01:10,019 --> 00:01:11,379
we ask are the name of the client,

51
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:12,340
the email, the niche

52
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:13,730
that they're in, their channel

53
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:15,560
URL, are they a returning client?

54
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,390
Have you been making scripts for

55
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:16,849
them already?

56
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,760
What is their social media

57
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,719
profiles?

58
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:21,010
Additional context about the

59
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:22,459
client, and then these are done

60
00:01:22,459 --> 00:01:23,329
automatically.

61
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:25,549
So as you can see, I put myself

62
00:01:25,769 --> 00:01:27,260
in, Lucas sent it, my email, I'm

63
00:01:27,269 --> 00:01:28,379
in the business agency

64
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:29,430
and AI automation space.

65
00:01:29,709 --> 00:01:30,530
There's my channel URL.

66
00:01:30,579 --> 00:01:31,400
Am I a returning client?

67
00:01:31,629 --> 00:01:31,920
Yes.

68
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,640
I put my LinkedIn and social media

69
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,930
profiles to give you more

70
00:01:34,939 --> 00:01:36,340
information about me.

71
00:01:36,469 --> 00:01:37,530
Now, the other thing you have to

72
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:38,680
do is set up a Google Drive with a

73
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,500
clients folder.

74
00:01:39,609 --> 00:01:40,510
You should have this anyway, but

75
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:41,500
just go to Google Drive, create a

76
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:42,459
folder called clients.

77
00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:43,750
That's all you need.

78
00:01:44,829 --> 00:01:46,340
You can see in here, I've got the

79
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,049
folder name clients and I've got

80
00:01:48,049 --> 00:01:49,299
myself already in here

81
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:50,879
along with their test client.

82
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,939
So that's why when it came to

83
00:01:52,939 --> 00:01:55,019
returning client, I set it to

84
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:55,840
true.

85
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,950
I just said, yes, they're a

86
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:57,810
returning client.

87
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,299
So that information then goes to

88
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:01,390
the parser.

89
00:02:01,609 --> 00:02:03,230
And then there's three different

90
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,959
sections that runs through.

91
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:07,420
This one decides that if they are

92
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:10,280
a returning client, sorry, no, if

93
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,460
they have a YouTube channel

94
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:13,419
input, because not all of your

95
00:02:13,419 --> 00:02:14,300
clients will have a YouTube

96
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,259
channel, but if they have a

97
00:02:15,259 --> 00:02:15,400
YouTube

98
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:17,110
channel, it scrapes some of their

99
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:18,879
most recent videos using Apefy.

100
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:20,539
Then it sends that data to the

101
00:02:20,539 --> 00:02:21,199
merge node.

102
00:02:21,409 --> 00:02:23,090
The other if statement says that

103
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:24,979
if they are a returning client,

104
00:02:24,979 --> 00:02:26,719
then it searches your client's

105
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,449
folder for the client's name,

106
00:02:28,449 --> 00:02:30,259
finds their last created script

107
00:02:30,289 --> 00:02:31,840
and sends that to the merge

108
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:32,319
node too.

109
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:34,280
And then this agent looks for more

110
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,240
information on the client, does

111
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,919
deep research using perplexity

112
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:39,379
to get a ton of information about

113
00:02:39,379 --> 00:02:40,539
the client and context.

114
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:42,759
You can see here, we got a big

115
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:45,629
comprehensive market intelligence

116
00:02:45,629 --> 00:02:47,439
report on me just using

117
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:48,020
perplexity.

118
00:02:48,449 --> 00:02:49,680
There is the prompt you can see in

119
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:50,879
here what it looks for.

120
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:52,169
It looks for the creator business

121
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,069
profile analysis, their YouTube

122
00:02:54,069 --> 00:02:55,400
channel deep dive, content

123
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:55,900
strategy,

124
00:02:56,139 --> 00:02:56,870
competitive landscape, all this

125
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:57,180
stuff.

126
00:02:57,409 --> 00:02:58,599
Just goes to a full deep dive on

127
00:02:58,770 --> 00:02:59,379
the client.

128
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:00,659
Actually, if I go back here again,

129
00:03:00,849 --> 00:03:01,620
you'll see it says you're

130
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:02,990
conducting a market intelligence

131
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,289
research on me, monitoring

132
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,409
research me, my channel, and other

133
00:03:06,409 --> 00:03:07,800
people, and then just more

134
00:03:08,389 --> 00:03:10,039
information we got from the form.

135
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:11,330
So after that, all that

136
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:13,560
information is taken and put

137
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,520
together.

138
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,090
So we have my YouTube videos, we

139
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:19,460
have my client research, and we

140
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,419
have previous videos that

141
00:03:21,689 --> 00:03:22,770
this AI has created that are in

142
00:03:22,979 --> 00:03:23,840
the client folder.

143
00:03:24,569 --> 00:03:25,629
This goes to a data intelligence

144
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:26,379
agent.

145
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:29,030
And this basically does another

146
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:31,860
structured analysis of the client

147
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:34,080
researching information

148
00:03:34,349 --> 00:03:35,449
and looking for things like

149
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,620
content opportunities, competitor

150
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,460
insights, audience behavior,

151
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:39,689
things

152
00:03:39,849 --> 00:03:40,120
like that.

153
00:03:40,349 --> 00:03:41,409
That thing goes to a YouTube

154
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,479
category agent.

155
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:43,909
And all this does determine what

156
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,639
YouTube category the video should

157
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:46,520
be created in.

158
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,770
So we can see here, it says the

159
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:49,060
category should be business and

160
00:03:49,139 --> 00:03:50,469
entrepreneurship with a confidence

161
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:52,020
level 95 and explains why it

162
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:52,800
thinks that.

163
00:03:53,789 --> 00:03:55,259
Then we go to the audience persona

164
00:03:55,259 --> 00:03:57,080
agent, and this creates a detailed

165
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,080
audience persona.

166
00:03:58,189 --> 00:03:59,650
So based on the information we got

167
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:01,270
from all the other parts, the data

168
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:02,879
intelligence agent, the client

169
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:05,719
research agent, it will create a

170
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:06,620
basic audience persona.

171
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:08,270
Demographics are people aged 30 to

172
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,919
45, male, location, primarily

173
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:11,240
developed English-speaking

174
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:14,219
markets, education, income, all

175
00:04:14,219 --> 00:04:14,819
these sort of things.

176
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:16,110
Basically, you're coming up with

177
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:17,670
who your likely audience viewers

178
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:18,000
are.

179
00:04:18,949 --> 00:04:20,029
Then we create a content strategy

180
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:21,660
from all of this information.

181
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,079
This creates content pillars,

182
00:04:23,339 --> 00:04:24,329
content types and formats,

183
00:04:24,329 --> 00:04:25,620
publishing schedule, video

184
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:27,240
concept, SEO strategy, all that

185
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,399
sort of stuff there.

186
00:04:28,629 --> 00:04:29,550
Again, based on our previous

187
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:31,079
information from the other agents.

188
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,370
The whole time here, we're passing

189
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:33,620
through the data collected by

190
00:04:33,699 --> 00:04:34,500
other agents.

191
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:35,790
Finally, we get to the script

192
00:04:36,139 --> 00:04:36,620
writer agent.

193
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,589
This script writer will do a few

194
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:39,339
things.

195
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:41,069
It will obviously write the

196
00:04:41,069 --> 00:04:43,290
script, but using the information

197
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:45,259
from previous agents, it gets the

198
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:46,339
content strategy, the target

199
00:04:46,339 --> 00:04:47,550
audience, the market intelligence

200
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:47,879
report.

201
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:49,829
It also looks for our previous

202
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,740
AI-generated YouTube script.

203
00:04:51,889 --> 00:04:52,579
This is so that we don't keep

204
00:04:52,579 --> 00:04:53,649
making the same script each time,

205
00:04:53,649 --> 00:04:54,600
because if we're doing the same

206
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,129
research, get the same information

207
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,519
for the client over and over, it

208
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:58,829
could very likely produce the same

209
00:04:58,970 --> 00:04:59,759
videos each time.

210
00:04:59,819 --> 00:05:00,959
So then it sends it the most

211
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:02,439
recent YouTube script generated

212
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:03,920
and says, don't make this script

213
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,120
again, essentially.

214
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:06,699
Then it gives it examples of other

215
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,060
clients' other scripts.

216
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:08,990
Again, if they don't have other

217
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:09,879
scripts from YouTube for their

218
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:10,850
YouTube videos, that's totally

219
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:11,199
fine.

220
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,250
It'll just use all the other

221
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:12,939
information.

222
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:15,310
Then it writes the script, as you

223
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:16,800
can see over here.

224
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:18,389
Now, we could be done there, but

225
00:05:18,389 --> 00:05:18,899
we're not.

226
00:05:19,009 --> 00:05:20,189
So the next thing we do is we make

227
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:21,889
an SEO package based on this.

228
00:05:22,339 --> 00:05:23,449
And we come up with a pretty

229
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:24,949
detailed breakdown of how we

230
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:26,310
should be covered with video

231
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,129
titles and descriptions and tags

232
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:29,740
and all that sort of stuff.

233
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:31,029
Then we send it to a quality

234
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:32,060
review agent.

235
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,600
This reviews the script and then

236
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:34,740
makes suggestions.

237
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,029
So the revision recommended strong

238
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:37,459
foundation and broken ready for

239
00:05:37,459 --> 00:05:38,639
several high-impact edits to

240
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:39,980
materially improve retention,

241
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:41,259
walkthrough in CTR with a 78%

242
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:42,420
level of confidence.

243
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:44,069
So it comes up with suggestions on

244
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,639
how to improve the script based on

245
00:05:45,699 --> 00:05:47,220
information we've gathered from

246
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,750
professional YouTubers and

247
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,560
professional script writers.

248
00:05:51,689 --> 00:05:53,430
Then it sends those edits to the

249
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:55,790
script improver agent, which takes

250
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:57,930
the original script and improves

251
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:00,000
it based on the suggestions given

252
00:06:00,069 --> 00:06:02,209
by the previous quality reviewer

253
00:06:02,209 --> 00:06:03,000
agent.

254
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,300
Then we send that over here to our

255
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,699
final results aggregator, just

256
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:11,100
sorts things properly in the right

257
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:13,660
kind of string names and things.

258
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,670
Then we convert the script to

259
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:19,269
markdown, so it just converts the

260
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,790
information we need to a correct

261
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:23,449
markdown format.

262
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,470
And then we send that to a service

263
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:27,600
that turns markdown into formatted

264
00:06:27,779 --> 00:06:28,759
Google Docs.

265
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:30,579
The final thing we do is we check

266
00:06:30,579 --> 00:06:32,370
it again if they are a returning

267
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:32,899
client.

268
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,100
It will search for the client

269
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,420
folder and move the script to the

270
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:36,540
existing client folder.

271
00:06:36,939 --> 00:06:38,360
If they're not a returning client,

272
00:06:38,449 --> 00:06:39,689
it will create a folder with their

273
00:06:39,689 --> 00:06:41,069
name and move the file there.

274
00:06:41,509 --> 00:06:42,370
Finally, we make a very nice

275
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:44,310
looking email that just tells them

276
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,879
the script is done with links to

277
00:06:46,019 --> 00:06:46,660
the script.

278
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:47,829
And we send that email.

279
00:06:48,019 --> 00:06:49,189
Now, here's where you can edit it.

280
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:51,779
You can decide if you want this to

281
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:54,230
go to you or you can just get the

282
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:56,529
client's email from the data

283
00:06:56,529 --> 00:06:58,639
validator and parser.

284
00:06:58,829 --> 00:06:59,829
Just get client email and drag

285
00:06:59,829 --> 00:07:01,050
that in there if you want to send

286
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:01,870
it to the client.

287
00:07:02,029 --> 00:07:03,089
But otherwise, you can send it to

288
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,290
yourself or to a test account like

289
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:04,740
I have.

290
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:06,670
And then finally, we have a Slack

291
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,079
notification set up.

292
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:09,370
From here, you'll authenticate

293
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:10,720
your Slack and you will just

294
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,120
choose your name from the list.

295
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,410
Or you can send it to a channel if

296
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:14,850
you want to have a channel as the

297
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:16,079
right place this goes.

298
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,660
And it will just say, hey, the

299
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,579
script's done.

300
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:19,800
Here's the link to the script.

301
00:07:20,029 --> 00:07:22,819
So that's primarily it.

302
00:07:23,069 --> 00:07:24,120
Again, the only thing you have to

303
00:07:24,449 --> 00:07:25,379
change for most of these is going

304
00:07:25,459 --> 00:07:27,160
to be authenticating your account.

305
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,209
So you have to get your OpenRouter

306
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:29,540
account authenticated in there.

307
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,230
You have to get your Apify account

308
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:32,680
authenticated in there.

309
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,120
Your Google Drive authenticated,

310
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,620
your Google Docs authenticated,

311
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:37,470
and your Gmail and Slack

312
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:39,120
authenticated.

313
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:40,410
Aside from that, that is pretty

314
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,660
much everything.

315
00:07:41,829 --> 00:07:43,019
To do that, again, you'll just

316
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:44,930
copy and paste this whole workflow

317
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:46,139
into your own N8N.

318
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:47,329
Then you'll see some of these will

319
00:07:47,329 --> 00:07:48,350
be red because you'll need to

320
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:49,160
authenticate them.

321
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:50,529
And you will just go in and either

322
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,459
create or connect your existing

323
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:53,899
Google Drive account.

324
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:55,889
You may have to change the

325
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:57,769
folders, give it the folder that

326
00:07:57,769 --> 00:07:58,750
you need it in.

327
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,670
So, for example, in search for

328
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:02,490
client folder, you'll want to

329
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:03,759
change this here.

330
00:08:03,949 --> 00:08:05,050
Just click from this and just type

331
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,240
in clients, which is what you

332
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,589
should name your folder, and

333
00:08:07,589 --> 00:08:08,100
select it.

334
00:08:08,209 --> 00:08:09,389
So it knows to search your clients

335
00:08:09,779 --> 00:08:10,160
folder.

336
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:12,410
That is pretty much everything.

337
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,540
This produces really good scripts.

338
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:17,329
So I'll show you an example now of

339
00:08:17,329 --> 00:08:18,930
this is the email that you're

340
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:23,759
going to get from the AI when it's

341
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,480
done.

342
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,759
So this is what you or your client

343
00:08:27,029 --> 00:08:27,379
could see.

344
00:08:27,509 --> 00:08:28,670
It's got a link to the script

345
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:29,600
folders.

346
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,699
It's got a direct script link.

347
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,379
And it gives it some next steps

348
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:34,190
and suggestions.

349
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:35,418
I think you can obviously change

350
00:08:35,418 --> 00:08:36,700
the name to your name down here.

351
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:38,830
To do that, you would just edit

352
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:40,879
this composed client delivery

353
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:41,538
email.

354
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:44,870
Email body, you would just change

355
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:47,850
the best regards, and then your

356
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:49,379
name in here.

357
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:52,019
And then when they click this

358
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:54,769
link, it'll bring them to the

359
00:08:54,769 --> 00:08:58,350
drive that contains their scripts.

360
00:08:58,509 --> 00:08:59,610
And if you click this link, it

361
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:00,759
brings them directly to the

362
00:09:00,759 --> 00:09:02,320
script, which will look like this.

363
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:03,250
So you can see we've got the

364
00:09:03,289 --> 00:09:04,360
client name, their email, the

365
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,600
timestamp when this is created,

366
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,100
the script, the title, the hook.

367
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,039
It's the intro and value

368
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:10,779
proposition.

369
00:09:10,779 --> 00:09:12,080
A full thing, fully laid out, full

370
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,259
script, ready to go.

371
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:15,529
It includes emphasis and visual

372
00:09:15,529 --> 00:09:17,259
suggestions for them to go

373
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:18,100
through.

374
00:09:18,419 --> 00:09:19,679
And then if you go down here,

375
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:21,470
there's the SEO package, which has

376
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,409
some video title suggestions, the

377
00:09:23,409 --> 00:09:27,039
description, the hashtags,

378
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,240
thumbnail text suggestions.

379
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:30,269
End screen elements, community

380
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:32,320
posts, pre-launch engagement, SEO

381
00:09:32,429 --> 00:09:34,779
keywords, and optimization notes.

382
00:09:34,899 --> 00:09:36,070
So this creates really, really

383
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:37,759
good YouTube scripts.

384
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:39,720
This should be all you need to run

385
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,480
your YouTube script writing

386
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,320
process.

387
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:44,039
Again, you simply just input the

388
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:45,700
information into the form, and

389
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,070
then this does pretty much

390
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:48,200
everything else.

391
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,669
Any problems, feel free to hit me

392
00:09:49,769 --> 00:09:50,000
up.

393
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:51,000
We'll take a look.

394
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:52,759
But once you authenticate your

395
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,080
accounts, it should be pretty much

396
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:54,769
ready to go.

397
00:09:54,909 --> 00:09:56,090
So I hope this is helpful, and

398
00:09:56,379 --> 00:09:57,580
look forward to seeing what you

399
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:58,580
guys do with this.

400
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,259
Peace.
