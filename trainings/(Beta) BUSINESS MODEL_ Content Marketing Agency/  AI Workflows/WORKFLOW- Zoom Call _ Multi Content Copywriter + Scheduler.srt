1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,209
What's up guys, so today I'm going

2
00:00:01,209 --> 00:00:01,770
to be showing you the

3
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:03,399
multi-platform content factory.

4
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:04,650
I'm going to be breaking down just

5
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:05,799
some of the nodes we're going to

6
00:00:05,799 --> 00:00:06,099
see,

7
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,339
some of the things we're going to

8
00:00:07,339 --> 00:00:08,230
have to set up briefly,

9
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:09,550
and telling you kind of just

10
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:10,740
overall how it works.

11
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,789
So what does this do?

12
00:00:12,939 --> 00:00:14,140
This takes any call transcript

13
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:14,929
that you have,

14
00:00:15,169 --> 00:00:17,199
either automatically from any Zoom

15
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:18,199
call you make,

16
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,760
or by pasting a transcript into

17
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:20,699
the automation,

18
00:00:20,839 --> 00:00:22,410
and it turns it into a YouTube

19
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:24,160
script, a LinkedIn post, a Twitter

20
00:00:24,219 --> 00:00:25,679
post, and an email newsletter.

21
00:00:25,809 --> 00:00:27,250
So I'm going to start by going

22
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:28,879
over the first nodes here.

23
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:29,660
We've got two here.

24
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:30,789
We've got webhook, and we've got

25
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:32,090
when chat message received.

26
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,320
When chat message is pretty

27
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,359
self-explanatory.

28
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:35,590
You'll notice down here, it

29
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:37,109
probably looks like this, at the

30
00:00:37,109 --> 00:00:37,859
bottom of N8N,

31
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:40,340
you will see chat over here.

32
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:41,590
And if you click this, you can

33
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:42,789
talk to this like you would to

34
00:00:42,789 --> 00:00:43,299
chat GPT,

35
00:00:43,429 --> 00:00:44,429
but what we're going to do here is

36
00:00:44,429 --> 00:00:45,429
we're just going to paste in a

37
00:00:45,429 --> 00:00:46,280
call transcript.

38
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:48,090
Now, for all our call recordings,

39
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:49,759
you might be using read.ai, you

40
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:50,700
might be using otter.

41
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:51,689
We use fathom.

42
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,079
Now, fathom's great, but fathom,

43
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:53,939
unfortunately,

44
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:55,990
doesn't allow us to directly send

45
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:57,490
call transcripts out.

46
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:02,320
What it does do, though, is it

47
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,859
works with Zapier.

48
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,680
So we have a Zapier setup that is

49
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,069
just simply two steps.

50
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:08,030
So if you want this to happen

51
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:09,090
automatically, you'll have to set

52
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:09,680
up this zap.

53
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:11,590
And the zap essentially says when

54
00:01:11,659 --> 00:01:13,390
a new transcript is created in

55
00:01:13,459 --> 00:01:13,980
fathom,

56
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,310
it sends it to a webhook by

57
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:17,180
Zapier.

58
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:19,090
What that does is it gives you a

59
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:21,659
URL, or it allows you to input a

60
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:22,340
URL.

61
00:01:22,819 --> 00:01:24,730
So you will go back to NNN, and up

62
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:27,120
here you'll see the webhook, and

63
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,739
this is your URL.

64
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:30,000
Use a production URL one, but

65
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,120
that's your URL there.

66
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:33,140
So you copy that, and you paste it

67
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:34,599
into Zapier on the URL.

68
00:01:34,859 --> 00:01:36,060
You choose post for the method.

69
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:37,459
And then here, like you go to any

70
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:38,650
other Zapier, you want to send

71
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:39,099
information,

72
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:40,620
you add the information that you

73
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:41,420
want to be sent.

74
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:42,340
The main thing we want is the

75
00:01:42,409 --> 00:01:43,530
transcript, but you can add all

76
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:44,620
this other stuff too.

77
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:46,400
So now this means that every time

78
00:01:46,459 --> 00:01:47,930
a new call is created, so when

79
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:49,540
fathom is on a call of mine,

80
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:51,040
it will send the call transcript

81
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,680
afterwards to this automation.

82
00:01:52,819 --> 00:01:53,650
But if you don't want to go

83
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:55,079
through all that hassle, and you

84
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:56,159
don't want to pay for Zapier as

85
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:57,120
well as N8N,

86
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:58,930
then you can simply take your call

87
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:00,599
transcript and just paste it in

88
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:01,790
here, and it will trigger the

89
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:02,310
automation.

90
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:03,659
It just means it's not fully

91
00:02:03,739 --> 00:02:04,500
automated.

92
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,989
Whereas for me, every time I do a

93
00:02:05,989 --> 00:02:07,480
call, I get a Slack message

94
00:02:07,569 --> 00:02:08,979
showing me the most recent content

95
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,280
made from what I talked about on

96
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:10,729
that call.

97
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:13,270
So let's go over this.

98
00:02:13,419 --> 00:02:14,219
We'll start off by looking at the

99
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,000
YouTube script agent.

100
00:02:15,139 --> 00:02:16,479
Very simply, when you paste the

101
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:17,909
transcript in here, or you do a

102
00:02:17,909 --> 00:02:19,349
call on the webhook, it receives

103
00:02:19,349 --> 00:02:19,919
the transcript.

104
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:21,830
This writes a YouTube script based

105
00:02:21,909 --> 00:02:23,719
on some of the information we have

106
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,580
from other YouTube experts on how

107
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:26,840
to write scripts.

108
00:02:27,069 --> 00:02:30,879
Then this creates a title for it.

109
00:02:30,969 --> 00:02:32,030
To walk you through just the AIs

110
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,139
we're using for this one, we're

111
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,430
using Claude to actually write the

112
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:35,000
script.

113
00:02:35,139 --> 00:02:36,300
Again, you have to set up Open

114
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,810
Router for this, which you should

115
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,080
have set up with all the other

116
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:39,860
workflows.

117
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,449
And as you can see, it's using

118
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:43,069
Claude 3.7 Sonnet.

119
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,389
And over here for this one,

120
00:02:44,419 --> 00:02:45,680
because this is only just making a

121
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:47,039
title, it's not a very, you know,

122
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,780
intensive sort of process, we're

123
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:51,469
just using DeepSeq R1 free.

124
00:02:51,659 --> 00:02:52,659
So it's a free AI.

125
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:53,750
So we're just using that to create

126
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:54,219
the title.

127
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:56,580
After that is created, the

128
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:58,379
script's created, we use this

129
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,550
node, which I'll explain to other

130
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:02,310
ones, but it's a service called

131
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:04,979
MD2Doc to create our Google Doc.

132
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:06,770
It's nicely formatted, it looks

133
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:07,110
good.

134
00:03:07,259 --> 00:03:08,870
So once it's created, then it

135
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:10,599
moves the file into a folder I've

136
00:03:11,009 --> 00:03:12,509
created for it, you have some

137
00:03:12,509 --> 00:03:14,500
Google Drive as well, called

138
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,099
YouTube Scripts.

139
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:17,280
So in your Google Drive, just make

140
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,580
a folder called YouTube Scripts.

141
00:03:19,219 --> 00:03:21,599
Then this one is LinkedIn Posts.

142
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,729
Then this one is called Twitter

143
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:24,409
Posts.

144
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:26,289
And then this one is just called

145
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:27,340
Newsletters.

146
00:03:27,469 --> 00:03:29,090
So once you have those created,

147
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:30,819
you can then, these will move the

148
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,830
files appropriately into the right

149
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:33,509
folder.

150
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:34,759
I made a folder that's called

151
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:35,319
Content.

152
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:36,659
And then if we go back here, say I

153
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:38,129
want to use a different folder, I

154
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:39,930
would simply choose the parent

155
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:41,800
folder here, type in the name of

156
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,169
it, but I've got YouTube Scripts

157
00:03:43,169 --> 00:03:44,090
created, so it's going to go in

158
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:44,360
there.

159
00:03:44,469 --> 00:03:45,389
But from here, you can choose what

160
00:03:45,419 --> 00:03:46,240
folder you want the YouTube

161
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:46,969
Scripts to go into.

162
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,500
Then when that's done, it will

163
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,099
send me a message in Slack to edit

164
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:52,789
this.

165
00:03:52,979 --> 00:03:54,530
Again, obviously connect Slack,

166
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:56,229
send message to user, and then me,

167
00:03:56,229 --> 00:03:57,689
or you can send it to a channel if

168
00:03:57,689 --> 00:03:58,939
you want to have all of your

169
00:03:58,939 --> 00:04:00,229
content in one channel.

170
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:02,240
And then over here, we prepared

171
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,240
the YouTube content for Q1.

172
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:05,990
It just basically takes it and

173
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:07,900
gets the content type, the text,

174
00:04:08,129 --> 00:04:10,280
the document URL, stuff like that.

175
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:13,360
And it sends it to a Google Sheet

176
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,819
we've created.

177
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,009
So we're going to create a Google

178
00:04:17,009 --> 00:04:19,430
Sheet, call it Content Calendar,

179
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:21,449
and add these titles to it.

180
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:22,589
So if I show you the sheet, it

181
00:04:22,589 --> 00:04:24,000
looks like this, Platform, Date,

182
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,480
and Link.

183
00:04:24,699 --> 00:04:26,819
So that way, when this is done,

184
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,620
this will now just log the

185
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:31,060
information of the posts here.

186
00:04:31,149 --> 00:04:32,230
So it's our YouTube Script, the

187
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,459
date was created, and the link to

188
00:04:33,459 --> 00:04:33,939
it here.

189
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,230
Obviously, because you have to

190
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:36,470
record the YouTube Script, we're

191
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:37,920
not going to schedule that.

192
00:04:38,019 --> 00:04:38,649
That's obviously something we're

193
00:04:38,649 --> 00:04:39,420
just going to come back to later.

194
00:04:39,569 --> 00:04:40,189
We'll just get a notification

195
00:04:40,209 --> 00:04:40,860
saying it's finished.

196
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:41,860
But for the others, we're actually

197
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:42,660
going to schedule them.

198
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,790
So when you send the transcript,

199
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,569
after the YouTube Script is

200
00:04:46,569 --> 00:04:48,829
created, it will create a LinkedIn

201
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:49,470
post.

202
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:50,930
Then make a title for that, make a

203
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:52,420
Google Doc, move it to the correct

204
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:53,939
folder, and it will then send you

205
00:04:53,939 --> 00:04:55,019
a message and wait for your

206
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:55,709
response.

207
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,410
And basically, it will give you a

208
00:04:57,410 --> 00:04:58,860
preview of the post, and you

209
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,370
decide if you want to post it or

210
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:00,879
not.

211
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:01,910
If you don't want to post it, it

212
00:05:01,939 --> 00:05:02,459
just stops.

213
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,629
But if you say you do want to post

214
00:05:04,689 --> 00:05:06,980
it, then it sends it to the queue,

215
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:09,509
and we use Blotato for scheduling.

216
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:12,019
Blotato is a tool.

217
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,550
They have a free version, but for

218
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:14,829
the API, it's actually very

219
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:16,339
affordable, and it allows us to

220
00:05:16,339 --> 00:05:17,930
schedule all of our content across

221
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:19,240
different platforms.

222
00:05:20,379 --> 00:05:21,790
You can create all sorts of posts

223
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:22,259
on it.

224
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:23,560
It's got an API.

225
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:25,029
You can see if you can connect to

226
00:05:25,029 --> 00:05:26,680
Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook,

227
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,259
TikTok, Instagram, threads,

228
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:29,500
everything, right?

229
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:31,740
So we're going to set this up by

230
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,569
going to the plus button here, or

231
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:35,490
actually, this will already be on

232
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:37,399
your workflow, but you'll have to

233
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:38,779
install this node.

234
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:40,079
So if you type in Blotato, when

235
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:41,480
you first click it, it'll ask you

236
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,579
if you want to install this

237
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:43,930
community node, and just click

238
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:45,399
install, and then it'll work.

239
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:47,449
So this then creates the LinkedIn

240
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:49,670
post posted for you, and then this

241
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:51,930
prepares the content to be logged,

242
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:53,509
and it adds it to the Google

243
00:05:53,589 --> 00:05:54,300
Sheet.

244
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,000
They all work the exact same way.

245
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:56,949
So now the Twitter post is the

246
00:05:56,949 --> 00:05:57,439
same thing.

247
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:58,980
Twitter post agent makes the

248
00:05:58,980 --> 00:05:59,490
posts.

249
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,180
Then creates a title, creates a

250
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:02,430
Google Doc, moves it to the

251
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:03,730
correct folder, sends you a

252
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,360
message, you approve it, and then

253
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,779
it gets posted to Blotato, and

254
00:06:06,779 --> 00:06:08,120
then logged to the sheet.

255
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,480
And finally, we have the

256
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,269
newsletter.

257
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:11,610
Now, for the newsletter, we're

258
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:12,829
using ConvertKit, because they

259
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:14,240
have the most available API.

260
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,889
So this writes the newsletter,

261
00:06:15,889 --> 00:06:17,449
gives it a title, makes the post

262
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:19,230
in a Google Drive, moves it to the

263
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:20,959
correct folder, then sends you a

264
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:22,899
message, asks you to approve it,

265
00:06:22,899 --> 00:06:24,430
and if you approve it, it'll add

266
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:25,269
it to your queue.

267
00:06:25,529 --> 00:06:26,509
It won't send the newsletter

268
00:06:26,509 --> 00:06:27,670
directly, it'll add it to your

269
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:28,649
drafts in ConvertKit.

270
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,490
And you'll have to modify this

271
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:31,389
slightly yourself.

272
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,180
So if you click over here, you

273
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,310
will be asked to authenticate, and

274
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:37,069
basically just put your API in

275
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:37,720
here.

276
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,060
Under API secret, go to

277
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,319
ConvertKit, sign up for

278
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,129
ConvertKit, go to settings, go to

279
00:06:42,129 --> 00:06:43,819
API, create an API key, and just

280
00:06:43,819 --> 00:06:45,230
paste the API key in here.

281
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,879
And now, when you're done, it will

282
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:52,339
send that newsletter text to your

283
00:06:52,339 --> 00:06:55,980
queue, your drafts in ConvertKit,

284
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:58,750
and then it will log it in the

285
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,899
Google Calendar.

286
00:07:01,449 --> 00:07:02,290
And that's basically the whole

287
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:02,620
thing.

288
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,449
The only thing you're going to

289
00:07:03,449 --> 00:07:04,120
need to set up again, as I

290
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:04,879
mentioned before, make sure

291
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:06,050
OpenRouter is authenticated.

292
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:08,189
Make sure that your Google Docs

293
00:07:08,209 --> 00:07:09,670
are authenticated.

294
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:11,149
Make sure that Slack is

295
00:07:11,149 --> 00:07:12,319
authenticated.

296
00:07:12,459 --> 00:07:14,170
And to do that again, you click in

297
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:15,779
here, and you just log in with

298
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:17,680
Google, and it should work.

299
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:18,709
I go over this in another video as

300
00:07:18,709 --> 00:07:19,000
well.

301
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,110
I had to do it on self-hosted as

302
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:20,459
well.

303
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,610
And then same for Slack, you'll

304
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:24,060
click here, you'll just log in

305
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,660
with Slack, and you'll be good to

306
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:26,060
go.

307
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:27,860
Potato, you're going to get your

308
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:28,480
API key.

309
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:31,370
You're going to get that from the

310
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:33,360
Potato dashboard.

311
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,000
Or, yeah, just have a login.

312
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,000
You'll use the credentials and use

313
00:07:39,089 --> 00:07:41,750
your Potato login, and then it

314
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:44,420
will be posted to your LinkedIn

315
00:07:44,529 --> 00:07:45,980
account after you've also

316
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:47,240
authenticated it in Potato.

317
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,540
You'll have to go to Potato's

318
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:49,949
thing here, log in with LinkedIn,

319
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,300
log in with whatever platform you

320
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:53,410
want, and then you'll get your API

321
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:54,360
key over here.

322
00:07:54,579 --> 00:07:56,600
Just copy it, and you just paste

323
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,740
it in, and you are good to go.

324
00:07:58,819 --> 00:07:59,860
So, again, the prerequisite is

325
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:00,459
what you need.

326
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,459
You need folders for all of these.

327
00:08:02,589 --> 00:08:04,189
So, you need a YouTube scripts

328
00:08:04,189 --> 00:08:06,120
folder, LinkedIn posts folder,

329
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:08,129
Twitter posts folder, newsletter

330
00:08:08,139 --> 00:08:09,740
folder on Google Drive.

331
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:11,649
And then you need to log in to all

332
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,220
the various accounts.

333
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,259
And you need to create a Google

334
00:08:15,269 --> 00:08:16,639
Sheet just called Content

335
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:18,899
Calendar, and select that in here.

336
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,639
And once you do that, then, and

337
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,379
you paste the transcript in here,

338
00:08:22,699 --> 00:08:24,050
you will have a ton of content

339
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:24,920
ready to go.

340
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,259
Now, this, again, works, if you

341
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:27,100
want to have this work

342
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,550
automatically, you will need to

343
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,870
use Zapier to create a webhook

344
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:31,240
from Fathom to send the most

345
00:08:31,269 --> 00:08:32,970
recent call transcripts to your

346
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:34,080
N8N workflow.

347
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,559
Again, to do that, it's a two-step

348
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,029
Zapier, new transcript from

349
00:08:38,029 --> 00:08:39,690
Fathom, webhooks by Zapier, you

350
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:41,149
paste in your webhook from the

351
00:08:41,168 --> 00:08:44,429
first step here, and then you test

352
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:45,259
it.

353
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:46,460
It'll receive the transcript, and

354
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,519
then you can just set it live, and

355
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:48,620
you're good to go, and that'll

356
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:49,519
work automatically.

357
00:08:49,659 --> 00:08:53,759
So, yeah, that's basically it.

358
00:08:53,899 --> 00:08:55,100
Any issues, feel free to hit me

359
00:08:55,179 --> 00:08:56,299
up, and I will go over it with

360
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:56,740
you.

361
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,610
But hopefully that kind of

362
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:00,370
explains the whole thing, and I

363
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:02,049
think you guys are going to get a

364
00:09:02,049 --> 00:09:03,700
lot of use out of this one.

365
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:05,139
It makes it super easy to create

366
00:09:05,139 --> 00:09:06,799
content pretty much on autopilot,

367
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:08,460
and, yeah, works across multiple

368
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:09,220
platforms.

369
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,960
So, hit me up with any problems,

370
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,580
and see you in the next one.

371
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,139
Peace.
