1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,199
Okay guys so today we're going to

2
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:02,419
talk about how to make content

3
00:00:02,419 --> 00:00:05,719
that gets clients so you guys all

4
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:06,919
need to be posting content at the

5
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:08,060
same time as you're doing your

6
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:09,279
outreach because what happens

7
00:00:09,449 --> 00:00:10,259
when you outreach people is

8
00:00:10,259 --> 00:00:11,289
they're going to click into your

9
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:12,500
profile before responding to you

10
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:14,740
and you know you probably already

11
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:16,519
have no social proof maybe a

12
00:00:16,649 --> 00:00:18,579
little bit so having content is

13
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:19,839
like literally it can be the

14
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:21,339
difference between you signing a

15
00:00:21,339 --> 00:00:23,039
client in 21 days versus like four

16
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:24,559
months so just make sure you're

17
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:25,989
posting ideally you're posting

18
00:00:25,989 --> 00:00:27,339
four youtube videos a month

19
00:00:27,969 --> 00:00:29,750
ideally eight but four is fine um

20
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:31,699
starting out and then because you

21
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:33,219
have to manage your time and

22
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:34,700
stuff right um try and pick

23
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,210
another platform as well like

24
00:00:36,219 --> 00:00:37,759
twitter or linkedin if you have

25
00:00:37,789 --> 00:00:38,439
some extra

26
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:39,640
time um but really focus on

27
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:41,270
posting youtube videos for sure

28
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:42,820
you can also do instagram reels i

29
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:43,399
found it

30
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,770
pretty difficult to get done for

31
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:46,049
you agency clients through ig

32
00:00:46,049 --> 00:00:47,420
reels though so i recommend just

33
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:47,799
making

34
00:00:47,909 --> 00:00:48,950
one pinned reel just so when

35
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:50,250
people visit your profile they

36
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,640
have something to see about your

37
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:53,070
offer your social proof etc but

38
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:54,179
for the most part you'll be

39
00:00:54,229 --> 00:00:55,799
focusing on your youtube content

40
00:00:55,799 --> 00:00:56,039
that's

41
00:00:56,149 --> 00:00:57,740
where the highest roi is for

42
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:00,070
yourselves and for your clients um

43
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:02,579
as most of you i assume will be

44
00:01:02,689 --> 00:01:03,939
offering a youtube service so i'm

45
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:04,959
going to cut into a video i

46
00:01:04,969 --> 00:01:06,420
recorded talking about how to sign

47
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:07,810
clients from youtube or more

48
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:09,329
specifically how to make content

49
00:01:09,329 --> 00:01:10,879
that gets clients look i'm going

50
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:11,170
to be

51
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:12,230
straight with you there's a

52
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:13,359
specific way to create youtube

53
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:14,719
videos that consistently attract

54
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:15,400
high paying

55
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:17,000
clients and most people are doing

56
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,310
it completely wrong we use this

57
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,920
exact system to help one of our

58
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:19,939
clients

59
00:01:20,409 --> 00:01:22,260
go from 30k to 75k per month in

60
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:24,150
just 120 days and no it wasn't

61
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:26,060
because he went viral or had some

62
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:26,310
crazy

63
00:01:26,469 --> 00:01:27,680
expensive setup we even have other

64
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,799
case studies like simone just

65
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,200
booked 250 sales calls in the

66
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:30,700
first two

67
00:01:30,819 --> 00:01:32,049
weeks of the month you heard that

68
00:01:32,049 --> 00:01:33,840
right 250 sales calls in 14 days

69
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:35,109
didn't go viral no expensive setup

70
00:01:35,469 --> 00:01:36,959
nothing like that the youtube game

71
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:38,239
is about creating videos that

72
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:39,760
actually work and get clients

73
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:40,180
knowing

74
00:01:40,299 --> 00:01:41,340
what topics to cover how to

75
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,659
structure them so people keep

76
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:44,219
watching and how to package them

77
00:01:44,269 --> 00:01:44,629
so your ideal

78
00:01:45,069 --> 00:01:46,379
clients can't help but click i'm

79
00:01:46,379 --> 00:01:47,689
going to break down that entire

80
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:49,120
system so you can steal it and

81
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:49,359
start booking

82
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,140
calls with qualified prospects

83
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:52,819
consistently step one is coming up

84
00:01:52,819 --> 00:01:54,760
with video ideas that actually get

85
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:56,140
you clients and this is where most

86
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:57,239
people mess up right from the

87
00:01:57,370 --> 00:01:58,599
start they create content that

88
00:01:58,849 --> 00:01:58,920
gets

89
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,359
views but doesn't get clients and

90
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:01,650
there's a humongous difference

91
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:03,180
okay so here's content that gets

92
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:04,530
views day in the life of a seven

93
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:06,030
figure entrepreneur moving from

94
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:07,480
vancouver to dubai something like

95
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:07,579
that

96
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:09,069
now content that gets clients is

97
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:10,400
like how i scaled my consulting

98
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:12,000
business to 50k a month in nine

99
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,080
months

100
00:02:12,379 --> 00:02:13,740
using youtube for example you see

101
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:14,689
the difference one is

102
00:02:14,689 --> 00:02:16,300
entertainment attracting peewee

103
00:02:16,349 --> 00:02:16,659
brain people

104
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:17,949
who want this lifestyle but don't

105
00:02:17,949 --> 00:02:18,770
want to work for it the other

106
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:20,210
one's education that positions you

107
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:20,400
as

108
00:02:20,509 --> 00:02:21,469
the expert and who's going to

109
00:02:21,469 --> 00:02:22,780
watch this right someone who wants

116
00:02:29,789 --> 00:02:30,830
so here's what i did for my

00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:32,099
coaching program which is my

118
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:32,189

step-by-step tutorials people are

121
00:02:34,789 --> 00:02:36,129
literally typing these phrases

122
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:36,539

converts the key is being specific

128
00:02:43,969 --> 00:02:45,180
don't just say how to get

129
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,530
clients say how to get your first

130
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:48,069
5k client in 30 days without cold

131
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,400
calling whatever it might be

132
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,919

135
00:02:53,949 --> 00:02:55,280
suggestions you can turn them into

136
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,680
video ideas now your middle funnel

137
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,180
is going to be educational why

138
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,110
videos so this is one i did

139
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:00,139
targeting agency clients and

140
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,479
talking about the real reason

141
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:01,900
prospects

142
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,250
ghost you after sales calls i was

143
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,620
educating the viewer i'm telling

144
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:05,900
them hey you need to make youtube

145
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:06,979
videos because then people are

146
00:03:06,979 --> 00:03:08,060
going to trust you more and like

147
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,250
you more and they're not going to

148
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:10,479
no show you that's the premise of

149
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:11,909
the video so these videos position

150
00:03:11,909 --> 00:03:12,930
you as an authority who

151
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:14,129
understands the industry better

152
00:03:14,129 --> 00:03:15,240
than everyone else so you could

153
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,330
say why most coaches fail to scale

154
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:16,699
past

155
00:03:16,819 --> 00:03:18,120
10k a month and what to do instead

156
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,180
why cold outreach doesn't work

157
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:20,800
anymore use this instead why i

158
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,000
stopped

159
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,379
taking clients under 5k and you

160
00:03:22,409 --> 00:03:23,840
should too these aren't tutorials

161
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,280
but they're insight pieces that

162
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:25,400
show

163
00:03:25,699 --> 00:03:26,680
your unique expertise and

164
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,979
methodology and then the final

165
00:03:27,979 --> 00:03:29,330
category is going to be bottom of

166
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:29,699
funnel

167
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:31,039
social proof content so this is

168
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:32,449
where you separate yourself from

169
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:33,879
every other coach talking about

170
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:34,099
strategy

171
00:03:34,409 --> 00:03:35,680
you show actual results so you're

172
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:37,000
going to do this through client

173
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,599
interviews so you can film a 15

174
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:39,770
minute call with a successful

175
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:40,780
client and ask about their

176
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,150
transformation their results and

177
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:42,620
what it was

178
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,080
like working with you you can use

179
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,530
riverside.fm to record this and

180
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,020
the next is going to be a case

181
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:47,030
study

182
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,479
breakdown so for this one you're

183
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:49,669
not actually going to have the

184
00:03:49,669 --> 00:03:51,039
client in the video it's going to

185
00:03:51,229 --> 00:03:51,599
be just you

186
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:53,080
breaking down step by step how you

187
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:54,430
got in this result now if you want

188
00:03:54,449 --> 00:03:55,509
to know how to research what your

189
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:56,840
market actually wants here's how

190
00:03:56,909 --> 00:03:57,930
you find out because you don't

191
00:03:57,930 --> 00:03:59,219
want to be guessing okay you're

192
00:03:59,280 --> 00:03:59,819
going to check your

193
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:01,289
dms and emails what questions do

194
00:04:01,289 --> 00:04:02,650
people ask you most often each

195
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:04,229
question is a potential video so

196
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:04,580
for

197
00:04:04,689 --> 00:04:05,939
example if a lot of people ask me

198
00:04:05,939 --> 00:04:07,060
hey amen is it worth it to do

199
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:08,680
youtube shorts i should probably

200
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:08,979
go

201
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:10,150
and make a youtube video about

202
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,310
that because if one person has

203
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:12,530
that question anywhere from a

204
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:12,840
thousand

205
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:14,129
to a hundred thousand people plus

206
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:15,319
have that exact same question but

207
00:04:15,419 --> 00:04:16,680
they're just too scared to ask

208
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:17,800
or they haven't asked yet now next

209
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,800
you're going to want to look at

210
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,839
your sales calls and see what

211
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:20,959
objections are coming up

212
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,240
repeatedly what do people get

213
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,420
confused about make videos

214
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:24,339
addressing those exact

215
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:26,139
points spy on your competition

216
00:04:26,139 --> 00:04:27,569
what videos are getting the most

217
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:28,879
engagement in your space

218
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,310
make better versions with your

219
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,730
unique angle and finally you'll

220
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,279
use actual search data you can use

221
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,509
tools like vidiq so you can see

222
00:04:34,509 --> 00:04:35,839
what people are actually searching

223
00:04:35,939 --> 00:04:37,180
for but honestly nowadays you

224
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,660
just have to type in the youtube

225
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:39,930
search bar and see what auto

226
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,439
completes or just look at the

227
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:41,579
videos

228
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,879
that come up when you search on

229
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,329
youtube you don't even need to use

230
00:04:44,329 --> 00:04:45,720
a tool now step two is the script

231
00:04:45,829 --> 00:04:46,810
structure that keeps people

232
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:48,029
watching so here's the thing you

233
00:04:48,029 --> 00:04:49,279
don't want to script everything

234
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:49,699
word for

235
00:04:49,819 --> 00:04:51,370
word or you'll sound like a robot

236
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:53,060
but you do need structure okay so

237
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:54,480
the hook is anywhere from zero to

238
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,019
30 seconds this makes or breaks

239
00:04:56,019 --> 00:04:57,329
your video so you literally have

240
00:04:57,639 --> 00:04:58,800
30 seconds max to convince

241
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,149
someone to keep watching keep it

242
00:05:00,149 --> 00:05:01,639
short especially if you're selling

243
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:02,939
a b2b service the last thing you

244
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,240
want to do is some elaborate two

245
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,639
minute intro now pay off the click

246
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:06,980
if your title says how to get your

247
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,089
first 5k client immediately

248
00:05:08,089 --> 00:05:09,170
confirm that that's what you're

249
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,370
going to show them and then you're

250
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:10,720
going to

251
00:05:10,829 --> 00:05:11,470
want to add quick social proof

252
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:12,279
mention a result or case study to

253
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:14,899
establish credibility so here's an

254
00:05:15,009 --> 00:05:16,379
example look i'm about to show you

255
00:05:16,379 --> 00:05:17,750
how to land your first 5k client

256
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:19,779
in the next 30 days this is the

257
00:05:19,899 --> 00:05:21,110
same system i use to help my

258
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:22,930
client sarah go from 0 to 15k a

259
00:05:22,939 --> 00:05:24,899
month in 90 days and by the end of

260
00:05:24,899 --> 00:05:24,980
this

261
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,279
video you'll have the complete

262
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:27,629
roadmap now for the body which is

263
00:05:27,629 --> 00:05:28,980
the bulk of the video the middle

264
00:05:29,069 --> 00:05:29,139
part

265
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:30,329
you're going to want to use bullet

266
00:05:30,329 --> 00:05:31,550
points and not full scripts write

267
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:32,529
down your main points then

268
00:05:32,689 --> 00:05:34,089
elaborate naturally when recording

269
00:05:34,089 --> 00:05:35,040
this keeps you sound and

270
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,579
conversational you'll also want to

271
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:36,980
weave in

272
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,360
social proof naturally throughout

273
00:05:38,389 --> 00:05:39,360
so don't save all your case

274
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:40,740
studies for the end or that little

275
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:40,810
piece

276
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:41,959
in the hook just sprinkle it in

277
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:43,180
throughout the video you'll also

278
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:44,259
want to sell them on the next

279
00:05:44,259 --> 00:05:44,899
section so at

280
00:05:45,009 --> 00:05:46,500
the end of each point tease what's

281
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,060
coming up next so like but knowing

282
00:05:48,129 --> 00:05:49,310
how to price is only half the

283
00:05:49,579 --> 00:05:50,660
battle in a minute i'll show you

284
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:52,149
the exact script that gets clients

285
00:05:52,149 --> 00:05:53,540
to say yes immediately that's an

286
00:05:53,649 --> 00:05:54,920
example and then you're going to

287
00:05:54,949 --> 00:05:56,259
do your mid video cta around the

288
00:05:56,259 --> 00:05:57,939
30 to 50 mark this is where most

289
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:58,410
people

290
00:05:58,529 --> 00:05:59,860
completely miss the boat they

291
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,269
either have no cta or wait until

292
00:06:01,269 --> 00:06:02,819
the end when 80 of their viewers

293
00:06:03,379 --> 00:06:03,379
have

294
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:04,730
already clicked off the video

295
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:06,100
place it strategically around

296
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:07,670
one-third to halfway through your

297
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:07,779
video

298
00:06:08,139 --> 00:06:09,389
make it feel natural don't just

299
00:06:09,389 --> 00:06:10,870
randomly interrupt your content

300
00:06:11,129 --> 00:06:12,420
and transition into it smoothly so

301
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:12,899
here's a quick

302
00:06:13,009 --> 00:06:14,259
example by the way if you're an

303
00:06:14,259 --> 00:06:15,629
online coach or agency owner or

304
00:06:15,699 --> 00:06:17,459
consultant making over 30k a month

305
00:06:17,569 --> 00:06:18,649
and you want me to make you videos

306
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:19,939
completely done for you just hit

307
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:20,980
the first link down in the

308
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:22,519
description i'll do everything

309
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:23,829
ideas scripts editing thumbnails

310
00:06:24,209 --> 00:06:25,540
seo posting you just have to

311
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:26,100
record for

312
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,730
two to three hours per month but

313
00:06:27,769 --> 00:06:29,370
that's it back to the video that

314
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:31,060
was my mid body cta so if you're

315
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:32,519
a coach consultant agency owner do

316
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:33,790
that but the outro here which is

317
00:06:33,819 --> 00:06:35,139
the final 30 seconds you're going

318
00:06:35,149 --> 00:06:35,379
to

319
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,579
sell them on watching more of your

320
00:06:36,649 --> 00:06:37,860
content you're going to recommend

321
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:39,540
them a specific related video so

322
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:40,610
don't just say like check out my

323
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:41,680
other videos you can if you want

324
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,389
if you don't have anything

325
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:43,100
specific

326
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,240
to point them to but it's better

327
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,329
if you tell them a specific video

328
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:46,720
also reinforce your main call to

329
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:47,720
action from earlier in the video

330
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,620
and then if you're going to ask

331
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:49,610
them to subscribe like just do it

332
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:49,860
very

333
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,060
quickly you know don't dwell on it

334
00:06:51,129 --> 00:06:52,199
too much you know hey make sure

335
00:06:52,209 --> 00:06:53,209
here what i'm saying is like

336
00:06:53,339 --> 00:06:54,569
push them to book a call join your

337
00:06:54,569 --> 00:06:55,949
webinar or free group whatever it

338
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:56,980
might be now step three is

339
00:06:57,089 --> 00:06:58,480
creating thumbnails that actually

340
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,819
get clicks your thumbnail is the

341
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:01,139
first thing people see and it

342
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:02,449
determines whether they click or

343
00:07:02,449 --> 00:07:03,519
scroll past and here's what

344
00:07:03,529 --> 00:07:04,970
actually works the psychology of

345
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:06,660
click-worthy thumbnails is very

346
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,189
simple people process images in

347
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,459
three seconds or less actually

348
00:07:09,819 --> 00:07:10,740
much quicker than that to be

349
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:11,980
honest if they can't understand

350
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,089
what your video is about they

351
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:13,540
instantly

352
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:15,139
won't click so if you look at this

353
00:07:15,139 --> 00:07:16,470
okay the top video which is the

354
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,019
one we made when you type growth

355
00:07:18,129 --> 00:07:19,209
operator is a nice green cool

356
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:20,500
thumbnail has like big text on it

357
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,100
like you can look at the thumbnail

358
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:22,259
know

359
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:23,120
what the video is about but when

360
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:23,779
you look at the two other

361
00:07:23,779 --> 00:07:24,730
thumbnails like you're kind of

362
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:25,170
like i

363
00:07:25,329 --> 00:07:26,279
don't know what this is about

364
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,519
necessarily not to say that these

365
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:29,050
videos performed well or this guy

366
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:29,540
doesn't know what

367
00:07:29,629 --> 00:07:30,649
he's doing you know the videos

368
00:07:30,649 --> 00:07:31,980
performed great but ours performed

369
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,100
really good it's because we have a

370
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:33,300
good

371
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:34,490
thumbnail good title good hook

372
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:35,779
good everything bright thumbnails

373
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:37,139
stand out okay most people browse

374
00:07:37,389 --> 00:07:37,540
youtube

375
00:07:37,649 --> 00:07:39,100
in dark mode as you can see here

376
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,899
so brighter thumbnails naturally

377
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,100
catch more attention as

378
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:43,180
you can see here you know i'm

379
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:44,220
wearing a red hoodie here i'm not

380
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:45,459
actually wearing a red hoodie my

381
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:45,620
hoodie

382
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:46,819
was black we just turned it red

383
00:07:46,889 --> 00:07:48,069
you know i got like big phones

384
00:07:48,069 --> 00:07:49,170
here i got like blue white

385
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:49,620
everything

386
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:51,079
is very bright numbers get more

387
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:52,490
clicks okay so write five thousand

388
00:07:52,779 --> 00:07:54,019
dollars instead of five thousand

389
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,240
dollars use three steps instead of

390
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,129
three steps like use the number

391
00:07:56,199 --> 00:07:57,339
that's what i'm trying to say

392
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,759
show your face in your thumbnails

393
00:07:58,790 --> 00:07:59,860
okay thumbnails with faces

394
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:01,220
generally perform better because

395
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:01,540
people

396
00:08:01,649 --> 00:08:03,100
connect with people and also over

397
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,379
time as you build like brand

398
00:08:04,379 --> 00:08:05,699
equity like for me i'm like the

399
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:05,939
content

400
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,040
agency guy or the youtube guy

401
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,129
people see my face they know my

402
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:09,519
face so they're gonna click it but

403
00:08:09,579 --> 00:08:09,779
if the

404
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:11,230
thumbnail had no face on it they

405
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:12,620
might not clock it that that's

406
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:14,180
actually my video so here's the

407
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:14,230
formula

408
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:16,050
that works four words or less the

409
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:17,410
more text you add the less like

410
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:18,889
people are to click just keep it

411
00:08:18,889 --> 00:08:18,990
simple

412
00:08:19,579 --> 00:08:20,959
high contrast text is needed to

413
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:22,310
use thick outlines thick text

414
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:23,779
thick drop shadows so you can

415
00:08:23,779 --> 00:08:24,500
easily read it

416
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:25,819
even on small screens just always

417
00:08:25,819 --> 00:08:26,980
remember to optimize for iphone

418
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:28,180
because that's going to be where

419
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:28,949
most of the traffic is

420
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:30,779
the thumbnails aren't huge on an

421
00:08:30,779 --> 00:08:32,210
iphone they're pretty small so if

422
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:33,700
you have some little text no

423
00:08:33,798 --> 00:08:34,548
one's going to see that right a

424
00:08:34,548 --> 00:08:35,470
lot of the times when we're doing

425
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:36,418
revisions with our thumbnail

426
00:08:36,538 --> 00:08:37,740
designer we're constantly telling

427
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:38,798
him like hey keep in mind that

428
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:39,809
like you know this is for iphone

429
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:40,100
and

430
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,288
then he quickly tweaks it right

431
00:08:41,288 --> 00:08:42,580
show the transformation so if you

432
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:43,940
can obviously depend on the topic

433
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:44,179
of the

434
00:08:44,299 --> 00:08:45,759
video use before and after images

435
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:47,340
or show the end result they'll get

436
00:08:47,409 --> 00:08:48,740
also use familiar icons so if

437
00:08:49,009 --> 00:08:50,059
you're talking about email

438
00:08:50,059 --> 00:08:51,490
marketing include an envelope or

439
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:52,659
like a gmail icon or like a

440
00:08:52,659 --> 00:08:53,309
klaviyo icon if

441
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:54,659
it's about youtube include the

442
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:55,940
youtube play button so on and so

443
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:57,379
forth now step four here's how all

444
00:08:57,490 --> 00:08:57,519
your

445
00:08:57,659 --> 00:08:58,730
videos work together as a client

446
00:08:58,809 --> 00:08:59,950
acquisition system this is the

447
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:01,320
secret sauce okay your videos

448
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:02,960
shouldn't exist in isolation they

449
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,230
should work together as a complete

450
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:05,700
system that moves people

451
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,299
from stranger to paying client the

452
00:09:07,299 --> 00:09:08,549
strategic content calendar

453
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:09,759
approach week one do an

454
00:09:09,789 --> 00:09:10,580
action-based how-to

455
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:11,909
video this is gonna get new people

456
00:09:11,909 --> 00:09:13,059
in week two do an educational why

457
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:14,649
video which builds your authority

458
00:09:14,769 --> 00:09:16,139
and unique perspective week three

459
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:17,460
do a social proof content like a

460
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:18,980
client interview or a case study

461
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:19,059
and

462
00:09:19,169 --> 00:09:20,210
then week four just like repeats

463
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:21,220
cycle consistently and then

464
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:22,419
eventually over time maybe week

465
00:09:22,419 --> 00:09:23,299
five week six

466
00:09:23,409 --> 00:09:24,330
you can drop that free course

467
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:25,480
video once the channel is warmed

468
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,580
up and then just keep cycling

469
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:27,899
through action-based educational

470
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:29,210
social proof this rotation ensures

471
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:30,580
you're constantly attracting new

472
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:31,950
people building authority and

473
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,429
providing proof that your method

474
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,980
actually works now here's how your

475
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:35,029
videos

476
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:36,850
pre-qualify prospects when someone

477
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:38,029
watches three to four of your

478
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:39,539
videos before booking a call they

479
00:09:39,659 --> 00:09:40,590
already understand your

480
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:42,019
methodology trust your expertise

481
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,539
know your pricing philosophy align

482
00:09:43,629 --> 00:09:43,860
with your

483
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:45,210
approach your sales calls become

484
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:46,340
less about convincing and more

485
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,820
about qualifying whether they're a

486
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:48,269
good fit now

487
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,500
on top of this obviously you want

488
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,340
to add like a type form and

489
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,769
different qualification metrics so

490
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:51,940
we can

491
00:09:52,059 --> 00:09:53,139
reject the unqualified leads and

492
00:09:53,139 --> 00:09:54,409
prevent them from slipping through

493
00:09:54,419 --> 00:09:55,620
the cracks but naturally youtube

494
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:55,700
is

495
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,179
just such a high iq platform where

496
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:58,590
just smart people are using it and

497
00:09:58,769 --> 00:10:00,100
if they consume so much of your

498
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,480
content they just get so pre-sold

499
00:10:01,509 --> 00:10:02,799
but like if someone's just doom

500
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:04,100
scrolling on ig reels you can get

501
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,159
very low iq people on your

502
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:06,460
calendar which is what we don't

503
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:07,779
want so example right instead of

504
00:10:07,789 --> 00:10:08,100
explaining

505
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,470
your entire process on a call you

506
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:10,690
can say like i mentioned in my

507
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:12,409
video about scaling 50k a month or

508
00:10:12,539 --> 00:10:13,500
whatever the title is the first

509
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,539
thing we need to do is blah blah

510
00:10:14,539 --> 00:10:15,700
blah if they told you before that

511
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:15,809
they came

512
00:10:16,139 --> 00:10:17,179
from your youtube channel so we

513
00:10:17,179 --> 00:10:18,200
want to create your content

514
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,409
ecosystem so think of each video

515
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:19,860
as serving

516
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:21,090
a specific purpose in your funnel

517
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:22,230
so you're going to have discovery

518
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:23,490
videos which is the how-to content

519
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:24,620
and then the authority videos

520
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:25,740
which is educational and then the

521
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:26,899
conversion videos which is social

522
00:10:26,899 --> 00:10:27,159
proof

523
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:28,289
and then you also have the free

524
00:10:28,289 --> 00:10:29,389
course in here as well so try and

525
00:10:29,389 --> 00:10:30,110
link between your videos

526
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:31,379
strategically at the end at the

527
00:10:31,379 --> 00:10:32,299
end of a how to get clients video

528
00:10:32,409 --> 00:10:33,250
you can make a video that's

529
00:10:33,419 --> 00:10:34,389
like how to fulfill for your

530
00:10:34,389 --> 00:10:35,629
clients right they kind of lead

531
00:10:35,629 --> 00:10:36,690
nicely into each other so

532
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,169
create a pathway that keeps people

533
00:10:38,169 --> 00:10:39,289
in your ecosystem now on the

534
00:10:39,299 --> 00:10:40,500
production side keep it simple

535
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:41,629
but professional here's the

536
00:10:41,629 --> 00:10:42,980
equipment you actually need your

537
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,899
phone is completely good to record

538
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:45,460
with okay

539
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:46,840
seriously most people can't tell

540
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:48,179
the difference between iphone

541
00:10:48,179 --> 00:10:49,620
footage and a 2k camera as long

542
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,990
as the lighting is good and then

543
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:52,370
for audio this matters a lot more

544
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:53,779
than video quality because you

545
00:10:53,889 --> 00:10:54,980
can have bad video quality but if

546
00:10:55,049 --> 00:10:56,120
like you're actually saying

547
00:10:56,129 --> 00:10:57,539
something important and the audio

548
00:10:57,539 --> 00:10:57,620
is

549
00:10:57,730 --> 00:10:58,769
good people will still watch but

550
00:10:58,769 --> 00:10:59,809
not vice versa you can get a good

551
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:01,460
microphone for like 100 to 300

552
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:01,620
bucks

553
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:03,360
on amazon i like the sure mv7 plus

554
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,970
for lighting try and sit facing a

555
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:06,500
window like i am right now

556
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:07,830
natural light is free and looks

557
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:09,230
great now for the background just

558
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:10,340
keep it clean and simple

559
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:11,799
a plain wall or a simple office

560
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:13,269
setup works perfectly now quick

561
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:14,580
recording tips that actually do

562
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:14,820
make a

563
00:11:15,009 --> 00:11:16,320
difference record in segments so

564
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,629
don't try and nail a 15 minute

565
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:19,059
video in one take record each

566
00:11:19,059 --> 00:11:19,299
section

567
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:20,649
separately and then edit them

568
00:11:20,649 --> 00:11:21,919
together also it's okay to pause

569
00:11:21,929 --> 00:11:23,299
and check your notes you can edit

570
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:23,460
out

571
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:24,929
the pauses don't try and memorize

572
00:11:24,929 --> 00:11:26,299
everything by any means you can

573
00:11:26,299 --> 00:11:27,860
also record multiple hook options

574
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:27,870
so

575
00:11:28,129 --> 00:11:29,169
you can try two to three different

576
00:11:29,169 --> 00:11:30,340
versions of your opening and then

577
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:31,700
have the editor or your team or

578
00:11:31,809 --> 00:11:33,200
yourself pick the best one and

579
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,419
energy matters more than

580
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,100
perfection a passionate slightly

581
00:11:36,659 --> 00:11:36,659
imperfect

582
00:11:36,769 --> 00:11:38,039
delivery beats a perfect boring

583
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:39,379
one every time now here's your

584
00:11:39,379 --> 00:11:41,059
implementation plan okay start

585
00:11:41,059 --> 00:11:41,070
this

586
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:42,230
week okay stop pushing it off

587
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:43,360
because i know you have been for a

588
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,610
while pick your first video topic

589
00:11:44,779 --> 00:11:45,740
okay choose the most common

590
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,000
problem your ideal clients have

591
00:11:47,009 --> 00:11:48,240
that's your sweet spot write a

592
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:48,659
simple

593
00:11:48,769 --> 00:11:50,500
outline hook three main points mid

594
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,240
video cta and a conclusion film it

595
00:11:52,299 --> 00:11:53,940
don't overthink the setup good

596
00:11:54,059 --> 00:11:55,230
enough is better than perfect

597
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:56,659
create a basic thumbnail in canva

598
00:11:56,669 --> 00:11:57,940
or photoshop keep it simple

599
00:11:58,029 --> 00:11:58,659
include your face

600
00:11:58,769 --> 00:12:00,090
in clear text and then post and

601
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:01,409
move on don't obsess over the

602
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,070
first video plan your next one now

603
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:03,220
you

604
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:04,539
don't need to go viral to actually

605
00:12:04,539 --> 00:12:05,570
get clients from youtube funny

606
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:06,740
enough we have clients who get

607
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:07,620
anywhere from 300 to

608
00:12:07,669 --> 00:12:08,730
a thousand views per video

609
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:10,100
including my youtube channel and

610
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,460
we still get clients from the

611
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:11,860
videos

612
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:12,789
it's actually pretty crazy

613
00:12:12,789 --> 00:12:13,820
compared to an ig real you have to

614
00:12:13,879 --> 00:12:15,620
get like 5 000 10 000 views it's

615
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:15,700
like

616
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,139
pretty annoying youtube 300 to a

617
00:12:17,139 --> 00:12:18,389
thousand views you're good and i'm

618
00:12:18,389 --> 00:12:19,779

619
00:12:19,789 --> 00:12:20,019
thousand

620
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:21,320
views on a day in the life video

621
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,720
i'm talking about on like my type

622
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,090
of video like this one you're

623
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:24,419

clients and everything will change

627

most

628
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:29,879
people are trying to be the next

629
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:30,980
mr beast when really they should

630
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:32,210
be trying to be the obvious choice

631
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:32,399
for

632
00:12:32,539 --> 00:12:33,899
their ideal clients so what's next

633
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:35,269
the difference between business

634
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:36,820
owners who struggle to book calls

635
00:12:36,929 --> 00:12:38,200
and those who consistently get

636
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:39,730
those 5k clients isn't talent or

637
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:41,220
luck it's having a systematic

638
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:41,269
approach

639
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:42,899
to content that positions you as

640
00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:44,289
the authority in your space so you

641
00:12:44,309 --> 00:12:45,700
could spend the next six months

642
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,009
trying to figure this out through

643
00:12:47,009 --> 00:12:48,070
trial and error watching my

644
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,460
youtube videos or you could have a

description but honestly again i

657

try and make my videos super

658
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,779
valuable so you can just rip what

659
00:13:07,809 --> 00:13:07,940
i'm

660
00:13:08,059 --> 00:13:09,100
saying and go try it yourself of

662
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:11,269
slower you might not even get

00:13:11,269 --> 00:13:11,690
results
