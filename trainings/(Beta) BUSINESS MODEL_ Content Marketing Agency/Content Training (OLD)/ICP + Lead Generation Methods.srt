1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,199
All right guys, so today we're

2
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:02,540
going to be going over the ICP and

3
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:03,720
also the lead generation method.

4
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:05,250
So ICP means your ideal client

5
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:05,889
profile.

6
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:07,000
So before you reach out to anyone,

7
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:07,620
you need to know

8
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:08,689
exactly who you want to sign as

9
00:00:08,689 --> 00:00:09,130
clients.

10
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:10,289
And I'm going to walk through all

11
00:00:10,289 --> 00:00:10,900
that today.

12
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:11,320
I've worked

13
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:13,080
with many, many different people

14
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:14,640
and I know exactly like who's

15
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,199
good, who's bad to work with,

16
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:16,609
et cetera.

17
00:00:16,649 --> 00:00:17,429
There's many niches.

18
00:00:17,469 --> 00:00:18,640
There's coaches, consultants,

19
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,789
agency owners, info product

20
00:00:19,789 --> 00:00:20,199
sellers,

21
00:00:20,309 --> 00:00:21,350
software companies.

22
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:22,940
There's like roofers, brick and

23
00:00:22,969 --> 00:00:24,440
mortar, lawyers, financial

24
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:25,070
advisors.

25
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:25,480
There's

26
00:00:25,699 --> 00:00:26,410
like so, so many niches.

27
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:27,339
So I'm going to break it all down

28
00:00:27,399 --> 00:00:28,050
for you today.

29
00:00:28,059 --> 00:00:29,480
The ICP is so important

30
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,039
and you need to like develop the

31
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:32,479
skill of being able to tell if

32
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,159
somebody is qualified or not,

33
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:36,119
because otherwise you're going to

34
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:37,770
be like wasting a lot of time on

35
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:38,799
your outreach.

36
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:39,880
So let's get right

37
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:40,359
into it.

38
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:41,700
So this should be your ICP.

39
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:43,039
Just listen to what I say.

40
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:44,460
Don't challenge me and it will

41
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:45,000
work.

42
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:45,829
This is the best ICP.

43
00:00:45,829 --> 00:00:47,070
If you really want, you can throw

44
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:48,340
in software companies too, but

45
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:48,859
they tend to

46
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,219
take longer to make decisions.

47
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:51,539
And as a beginner, you're pretty

48
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:51,869
poor.

49
00:00:51,869 --> 00:00:53,250
Like you need to like make money

50
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:54,950
quicker and software companies are

51
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,229
slow and we want to work with

52
00:00:56,229 --> 00:00:57,320
people who are fast.

53
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:57,880
These people

54
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:00,170
make the decision maker.

55
00:01:00,189 --> 00:01:01,689
If two at maximum, they don't have

56
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:03,020
to run the decision up to the

57
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:03,479
board of

58
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,189
investors and some stupid BS.

59
00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:06,950
So make sure they're selling high

60
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:07,519
ticket.

61
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:09,219
So high ticket means a product

62
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:11,650
or service above $3,000 or like at

63
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:13,299
least the LTV lifetime value is

64
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:14,730
over 3,000.

65
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:15,769
Meaning over the

66
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:17,010
lifetime of working with a certain

67
00:01:17,049 --> 00:01:18,200
customer, they would have made

68
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:18,930
3,000.

69
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:19,980
Who you don't want to work

70
00:01:20,099 --> 00:01:21,590
with is somebody who's running a

71
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:23,219
school group for $27 a month

72
00:01:23,219 --> 00:01:25,129
because their churn is 70% and

73
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:25,719
people leave

74
00:01:25,829 --> 00:01:27,750
after two months and per customer,

75
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:29,299
they're making $60.

76
00:01:29,299 --> 00:01:31,439
It's much, much easier for someone

77
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:32,579
to get an ROI

78
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,730
on your service or return on

79
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:34,340
investment.

80
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,930
If you know, they're paying you 3k

81
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:36,870
a month for their content

82
00:01:37,019 --> 00:01:37,900
service and they just have to

83
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:38,599
close one person.

84
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:38,890
Okay.

85
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:39,890
They're break even close two

86
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:40,260
people.

87
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:40,650
Now they're

88
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:41,760
two X profitable.

89
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,200
So you need to approach this

90
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,969
business and every business with

91
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,040
the mindset of, Hey,

92
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,170
I need an ROI for my customers.

93
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:48,250
That's how I'm going to keep them

94
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:48,790
long-term.

95
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:49,689
Of course you need good

96
00:01:49,849 --> 00:01:51,560
customer service and other things.

97
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:53,140
I'm sure Andre will cover that or

98
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:54,439
somebody else in a different

99
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,230
part of the course.

100
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:56,390
I'm also going to cover it later

101
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:56,879
on as well.

102
00:01:56,879 --> 00:01:57,859
But going back to this,

103
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:59,269
if somebody is selling low ticket,

104
00:01:59,269 --> 00:02:00,540
but they're ascending them into

105
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:01,840
high ticket, that's fine.

106
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:03,500
So what that means is, give me one

107
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,010
second.

108
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,310
So if somebody is selling a

109
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:06,760
product for like $20,

110
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:08,038
but then after they buy the $20

111
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:09,389
product, they're calling them and

112
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:11,008
selling them a $3,000 thing,

113
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:11,830
that's fine too.

114
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:13,150
No, no worries at all with that.

115
00:02:13,169 --> 00:02:14,580
So coaches, consultants, people

116
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:15,280
selling coaching

117
00:02:15,389 --> 00:02:16,580
programs, courses, et cetera,

118
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:17,919
agency owners, you guys are agency

119
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:19,139
owners, but you want to make sure

120
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,819
you're selling to people that make

121
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:22,490
above like 20 K months because

122
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:24,099
anybody below that, they're going

123
00:02:24,189 --> 00:02:25,300
to be a pain in the ass client.

124
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:26,550
They can't afford your service

125
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:28,060
after expenses, taxes, food,

126
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:28,750
apartment,

127
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:30,199
giving money to people like

128
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:32,080
family, whatever they're poor.

129
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,860
So you don't really want to close

130
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:34,039
them.

131
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:35,270
But the unfortunate truth is when

132
00:02:35,289 --> 00:02:36,500
you're a beginner agency owner,

133
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,080
naturally you're going to get more

134
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:39,280
bottom of the barrel clients.

135
00:02:39,289 --> 00:02:40,490
And then as you progress, as you

136
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:41,689
get more social proof, you can

137
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:43,139
be more picky with who you work

138
00:02:43,139 --> 00:02:44,099
with, et cetera.

139
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:45,629
So don't like turn down things,

140
00:02:45,629 --> 00:02:46,569
but I'm just warning

141
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:47,879
you, like if you work with someone

142
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:49,250
who makes 5K months, it's going to

143
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:50,189
be the worst thing ever

144
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:51,780
because they're going to negotiate

145
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:52,370
your price.

146
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,810
They're going to like really need

147
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:54,539
your content

148
00:02:54,659 --> 00:02:55,199
service to work.

149
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:56,219
And it's going to be brutal.

150
00:02:56,219 --> 00:02:57,430
Make sure these people are selling

151
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:58,150
online because

152
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,210
if you're working with a like

153
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:02,419
cheeseburger spot in freaking

154
00:03:02,419 --> 00:03:04,710
Atlanta, like it's not going to

155
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:04,979
work

156
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:06,330
because it's a food joint, but

157
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:07,650
also like their TAM, the total

158
00:03:07,669 --> 00:03:09,349
adjustable market, it's only in

159
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:09,599
like

160
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:10,080
Atlanta.

161
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:11,550
I mean, it's actually like just

162
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:13,020
that little part of Atlanta where

163
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:14,189
like the cheeseburger

164
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:15,139
factory is.

165
00:03:15,139 --> 00:03:16,860
So it's a funny example.

166
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,840
But if you work with people who

167
00:03:18,849 --> 00:03:20,419
sell online, let's say you get

168
00:03:20,539 --> 00:03:21,360
them a hundred K views on a

169
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,590
YouTube video or a million views

170
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:23,580
on a reel, they can sell to

171
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:24,030
freaking

172
00:03:24,189 --> 00:03:26,080
Canada, Switzerland, Germany,

173
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,610
Dubai, like you name it.

174
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:28,129
Right.

175
00:03:28,139 --> 00:03:29,740
And then this like, make sure they

176
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:29,960
value

177
00:03:30,069 --> 00:03:30,370
attention.

178
00:03:30,409 --> 00:03:31,340
I mean, pretty much everyone

179
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:32,009
values attention.

180
00:03:32,009 --> 00:03:33,240
Make sure they can afford like two

181
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:33,710
to 5K

182
00:03:33,849 --> 00:03:34,550
retainers.

183
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:36,210
So my personal general rule of

184
00:03:36,219 --> 00:03:37,349
thumb is 10%.

185
00:03:37,419 --> 00:03:39,020
So what that means is if someone

186
00:03:39,139 --> 00:03:40,080
makes 20K a

187
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:41,210
month, you can charge them 2K a

188
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:42,020
month for marketing.

189
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,240
If they make 30, you can charge

190
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,219
340, you can charge

191
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,409
four, so on and so forth.

192
00:03:45,409 --> 00:03:46,879
Your goal is to only target people

193
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,180
in this ICP, not random small

194
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,069
businesses that

195
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:50,530
can't pay or like passion projects

196
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:51,729
that don't care about ROI.

197
00:03:51,729 --> 00:03:53,099
You can work with someone if they

198
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:53,240
don't

199
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,289
care about like a cash ROI and

200
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,310
they want just like views and

201
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:56,759
subscribers, just make sure to set

202
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,099
proper expectations.

203
00:03:58,099 --> 00:03:58,520
Cool.

204
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:00,419
So that's the ICP now in terms of

205
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:02,039
the dream 100 outreach.

206
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:03,099
So this is the

207
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:04,800
number one free client acquisition

208
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,099
method for content use.

209
00:04:06,099 --> 00:04:07,240
It's free meaning like you're not

210
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:07,879
really paying

211
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,289
for these customers with money.

212
00:04:09,289 --> 00:04:10,520
You're paying for it with your

213
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:10,860
time.

214
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,090
So what you're doing is reaching

215
00:04:12,219 --> 00:04:14,009
out manually to your top 100 dream

216
00:04:14,009 --> 00:04:15,250
prospects with extremely

217
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,470
personalized outreach.

218
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:17,100
You're not spamming a

219
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:18,579
thousand copy paste DMs.

220
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:20,319
You're not blasting cold emails

221
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:20,959
with VAs.

222
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:22,379
Instead, you're giving upfront

223
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:22,779
free

224
00:04:22,899 --> 00:04:24,300
value to five to 10 people every

225
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:24,850
single day.

226
00:04:24,899 --> 00:04:26,279
So this strategy worked for me in

227
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:27,730
2022, worked for me in

228
00:04:27,899 --> 00:04:29,850
2023, worked for me in 2024.

229
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:31,329
It still works in 2025.

230
00:04:31,329 --> 00:04:32,829
Although transparently, I do less

231
00:04:32,829 --> 00:04:33,480
this year because

232
00:04:33,529 --> 00:04:34,980
I have other means of acquisition,

233
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,529
but we still sling them sometimes.

234
00:04:36,529 --> 00:04:37,850
Like I literally did a loom like

235
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:38,449
three days ago.

236
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:39,620
I closed a client for 5K a month.

237
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:40,660
It'll work for years because it's

238
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:41,310
evergreen.

239
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:41,800
At the end of

240
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:42,790
the day, it's human psychology

241
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:43,790
where we're doing a piece of free

242
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:44,480
work for someone.

243
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:45,139
They feel

244
00:04:45,259 --> 00:04:45,850
indebted to you.

245
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:47,189
They feel like they need to reply.

246
00:04:47,189 --> 00:04:48,610
They need to check what you sent.

247
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:49,199
I scaled

248
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,250
zero to 15K in 82 days using dream

249
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,410
100 outreach.

250
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:53,220
So this works.

251
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,779
So first you need to build your

252
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:55,139
list.

253
00:04:55,259 --> 00:04:56,290
Step one is finding your ICP.

254
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:57,209
Where do they hang out?

255
00:04:57,209 --> 00:04:58,199
Is it going to be Twitter,

256
00:04:58,199 --> 00:04:59,139
Instagram, YouTube,

257
00:04:59,259 --> 00:04:59,529
TikTok?

258
00:04:59,589 --> 00:05:00,860
I mean, to be honest with you, if

259
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,129
you want the answer, it's all of

260
00:05:02,129 --> 00:05:02,459
them.

261
00:05:02,459 --> 00:05:03,509
They're everywhere.

262
00:05:03,699 --> 00:05:04,600
They're on Twitter.

263
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,730
They're on Instagram.

264
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:06,750
They're on YouTube.

265
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,230
They're on LinkedIn as well.

266
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:08,639
Those are the

267
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:09,839
main four sort of spots.

268
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:11,529
Of course, they're on TikTok too.

269
00:05:11,529 --> 00:05:13,180
I don't really personally use that

270
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:13,490
to find

271
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:13,860
leads.

272
00:05:13,949 --> 00:05:15,259
They're also in Discord groups,

273
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:16,699
Telegrams, Masterminds, paid

274
00:05:16,699 --> 00:05:17,709
coaching programs.

275
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,240
I've used

276
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,410
this a lot where I joined programs

277
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:20,399
and I started signing people

278
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:21,759
inside of them, but obviously that

279
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:22,670
costs money.

280
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:24,209
What you want to do on these

281
00:05:24,209 --> 00:05:26,110
platforms is you want to find one

282
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:27,439
person that's qualified,

283
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,430
which is pretty easy to do.

284
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:29,459
For example, you can just go on

285
00:05:29,509 --> 00:05:30,800
YouTube, search how to drop ship,

286
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,500
and then you'll see someone named

287
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,709
Samir, for example.

288
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:34,970
And then you go to Samir's

289
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:35,899
Instagram and

290
00:05:36,019 --> 00:05:36,920
then look at who he follows.

291
00:05:36,949 --> 00:05:38,389
So he'll have like 100,000

292
00:05:38,389 --> 00:05:39,680
followers, whatever, but he'll

293
00:05:39,779 --> 00:05:39,949
follow

294
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:41,060
like 700 people.

295
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,680
You click that 700, rich people

296
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:44,180
will follow all the rich people.

297
00:05:44,189 --> 00:05:44,860
So then now you

298
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,209
have a ton of leads in there that

299
00:05:46,209 --> 00:05:47,209
you can reach out to.

300
00:05:47,209 --> 00:05:48,720
Once you exhaust that list, you go

301
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:49,220
through

302
00:05:49,329 --> 00:05:50,449
manually qualify everyone.

303
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:51,680
Then you're going to go on to the

304
00:05:51,689 --> 00:05:52,310
next person.

305
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,560
So you're going to be like,

306
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,730
okay, inside of the 700 following,

307
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,480
there's one guy named Wiz of Ecom.

308
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:57,889
Cool.

309
00:05:57,889 --> 00:05:59,110
Let me click Wiz of Ecom.

310
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,709
Now he follows 2000 people.

311
00:06:00,709 --> 00:06:01,930
Now I'm going to go through that

312
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:03,279
whole list and then, okay, now I'm

313
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:03,329
going to

314
00:06:03,459 --> 00:06:03,930
pick one person.

315
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:04,189
Boom.

316
00:06:04,189 --> 00:06:05,220
And you kind of keep going, going

317
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:06,269
and going and going forever.

318
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:06,949
This is how

319
00:06:07,129 --> 00:06:07,949
you're going to find leads.

320
00:06:07,949 --> 00:06:08,920
Another way to find leads is you

321
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,240
just search things up, like how to

322
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,439
scale an agency, SMMA tips, or

323
00:06:11,449 --> 00:06:12,560
maybe you want a drop shipping

324
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:12,949
client.

325
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:14,100
You're going to search how to

326
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:15,860
drop ship, how to find a product.

327
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,199
Maybe you want an AI agency

328
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:17,709
person.

329
00:06:17,779 --> 00:06:19,360
You're going to search up like

330
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,589
how to use AI for XYZ.

331
00:06:20,629 --> 00:06:21,069
Boom.

332
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:22,970
You're going to find AI clients.

333
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,889
And for Twitter, you're going to

334
00:06:24,889 --> 00:06:25,389
use that

335
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:26,920
same method I said earlier.

336
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,300
So what I'm going to do is I'm

337
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,709
going to cut to a prerecorded

338
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:30,339
video I've

339
00:06:30,449 --> 00:06:32,300
already made that just like shows

340
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,389
me like actually doing this live.

341
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:36,290
And then I'll cut back to this

342
00:06:36,339 --> 00:06:36,560
video.

343
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:38,019
I'm going to do that in a second

344
00:06:38,019 --> 00:06:38,379
though.

345
00:06:38,379 --> 00:06:39,379
So yeah, I just want to finish

346
00:06:39,379 --> 00:06:40,490
running through what I wrote

347
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:40,779
here.

348
00:06:40,779 --> 00:06:41,779
And then I'll cut to that video

349
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:42,670
just so you guys get the actual

350
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,579
visual example.

351
00:06:43,579 --> 00:06:43,920
So

352
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:45,069
ideally they have more than a

353
00:06:45,069 --> 00:06:46,009
thousand followers.

354
00:06:46,069 --> 00:06:47,180
Guys, this isn't like a rigid

355
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:47,509
rule.

356
00:06:47,509 --> 00:06:48,149
There's people

357
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:49,920
with 200 followers who make like a

358
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,480
billion dollars a month, but like

359
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,699
it's usually like a decent

360
00:06:52,699 --> 00:06:53,110
telltale

361
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:53,529
sign.

362
00:06:53,529 --> 00:06:54,839
Ideally, they have an active

363
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:56,259
posting history and they're not

364
00:06:56,269 --> 00:06:57,379
like dead on socials.

365
00:06:57,389 --> 00:06:57,920
Ideally,

366
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,250
they have social proof as well.

367
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:00,379
Social proof is a great way to

368
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:01,740
tell if somebody makes more than

369
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,129
20k

370
00:07:02,259 --> 00:07:02,620
months.

371
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:04,110
Also just kind of their lifestyle

372
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:05,839
or like where they're living, what

373
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:07,500
their camera setup looks like,

374
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:08,449
these types of things.

375
00:07:08,449 --> 00:07:09,579
Like you need to just pick up like

376
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:10,709
little cues, right?

377
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,240
Because there's no way to

378
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:13,459
actually like look at someone's

379
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:14,730
Instagram and be like, oh, this

380
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:16,240
guy makes 73k a month and this guy

381
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,370
makes 82k a month.

382
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:18,899
It's like, no, you have to guess

383
00:07:18,899 --> 00:07:20,250
based on what you can see, how

384
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:21,120
much social proof

385
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,310
they have, how many customers

386
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:23,680
they've worked with, what comes up

387
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,829
when you search them up and how

388
00:07:24,829 --> 00:07:25,100
many

389
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,209
YouTube videos they have, et

390
00:07:26,209 --> 00:07:27,269
cetera, how many views they're

391
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:27,829
getting.

392
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:29,100
Also, they need to have a clear

393
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:29,990
positioning.

394
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:31,750
Like if you ever see someone who's

395
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,470
like, oh, I help like people with

396
00:07:33,579 --> 00:07:34,199
like life

397
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,379
coaching or they're just very

398
00:07:35,379 --> 00:07:36,370
broad and it's like a stupid

399
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,920
offer, like they're probably not

400
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,180
making

401
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:38,899
money, right?

402
00:07:38,899 --> 00:07:40,639
So like don't work with them.

403
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,439
You can kind of like tell how good

404
00:07:42,459 --> 00:07:43,720
someone is at business

405
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,279
and then based on that, you can

406
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:46,680
guess how much money they're

407
00:07:46,689 --> 00:07:48,300
making, factoring in how much

408
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:48,620
traffic

409
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:49,370
they're getting.

410
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:50,610
This might sound complicated.

411
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:51,709
The video I cut to will explain

412
00:07:51,709 --> 00:07:52,660
it, but this is a skill

413
00:07:52,779 --> 00:07:54,209
you're going to develop over time.

414
00:07:54,209 --> 00:07:55,509
And then again, just make sure

415
00:07:55,509 --> 00:07:56,709
they have social proof.

416
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,120
From there,

417
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:57,860
you're just going to build a

418
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:58,319
spreadsheet.

419
00:07:58,329 --> 00:07:59,129
You're going to put everyone's

420
00:07:59,170 --> 00:07:59,899
name on there and then

421
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,810
you're going to put their Twitter

422
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:01,899
link, Instagram, LinkedIn, email,

423
00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:02,569
and their website.

424
00:08:02,569 --> 00:08:03,060
You're not going

425
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:04,430
to find this for everybody.

426
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:06,029
Some people will only find Twitter

427
00:08:06,029 --> 00:08:06,459
and IG.

428
00:08:06,459 --> 00:08:07,980
Some people only LinkedIn and

429
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:08,329
email.

430
00:08:08,339 --> 00:08:09,509
Everybody's like a little bit

431
00:08:09,509 --> 00:08:10,860
different, but all the platforms

432
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,199
you can find, you put them here

433
00:08:12,339 --> 00:08:13,339
because what's going to happen is

434
00:08:13,339 --> 00:08:14,290
when we're actually doing the

435
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:15,439
outreach, you're going to be

436
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:15,829
reaching out

437
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:17,550
on all four platforms at the same

438
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:17,990
time.

439
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:19,470
So just copy pasting the same

440
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,019
message across all platforms.

441
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,189
In terms of finding their email,

442
00:08:22,189 --> 00:08:23,009
you can use list kit.

443
00:08:23,009 --> 00:08:23,899
But yeah, just fill this

444
00:08:23,899 --> 00:08:24,959
spreadsheet with

445
00:08:25,019 --> 00:08:26,060
a hundred people.

446
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,680
So I'm going to cut to that video

447
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:29,300
showing you how to find these

448
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:29,779
leads.

449
00:08:29,779 --> 00:08:30,000
And

450
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:30,920
then I'm going to come back and

451
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,339
continue.

452
00:08:31,339 --> 00:08:31,970
All right, guys.

453
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:33,158
So this is how you get high ticket

454
00:08:33,269 --> 00:08:34,750
clients for your content agency.

455
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,019
And these are recurring high

456
00:08:36,019 --> 00:08:37,860
ticket clients anywhere from 3k a

457
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:38,110
month to

458
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:38,830
8k a month.

459
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:40,269
I use the same method to scale my

460
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:41,970
content agency from zero to 93k a

461
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,490
month.

462
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,870
So let's get right

463
00:08:44,019 --> 00:08:44,289
into it.

464
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:45,600
Basically search process.

465
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,799
So we use social media to find

466
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:48,120
these clients, specifically

467
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:48,850
Instagram and

468
00:08:49,019 --> 00:08:49,779
Twitter and YouTube.

469
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:50,720
Those are my favorites.

470
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:52,000
There's also LinkedIn that works

471
00:08:52,009 --> 00:08:52,399
as well.

472
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:53,129
And I'm going to do a

473
00:08:53,259 --> 00:08:54,370
live walkthrough of how this

474
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:54,820
works.

475
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:55,970
So basically, number one is you

476
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:56,889
can use keywords, right?

477
00:08:57,029 --> 00:08:58,600
So let's say you go to Twitter and

478
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,090
then you put in the search bar

479
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:02,200
like coach or helping or founder

480
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,519
or CEO or

481
00:09:03,659 --> 00:09:04,230
stuff like that.

482
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:05,620
Helping is usually a good keyword.

483
00:09:05,659 --> 00:09:07,120
And then you switch to the people

484
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:07,460
tab.

485
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:08,389
Then from there, you

486
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:09,830
can find people who have those

487
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:11,029
keywords in their bio.

488
00:09:11,029 --> 00:09:12,690
Those keywords I gave, that's if

489
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:13,460
you're targeting like

490
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:14,690
coaches, like they typically have

491
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:15,419
that in their bio.

492
00:09:15,419 --> 00:09:16,480
Maybe you're targeting like

493
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,519
someone who's like a fitness

494
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:17,840
guy.

495
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,320
You just want to think, okay, what

496
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,169
do all these guys have in their

497
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,740
bio or like in their name?

498
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:23,970
What do they have in common?

499
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:24,970
You put that in the search bar and

500
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:25,899
then you can find them.

501
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:26,620
And then once

502
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,440
you find one prospect, right?

503
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,029
Then what you do is you go into

504
00:09:30,029 --> 00:09:31,740
that prospect's following.

505
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:32,360
So you see

506
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,179
who they follow.

507
00:09:33,179 --> 00:09:34,350
So let's say like you want to

508
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:35,690
target health and like fitness

509
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:36,840
coaches like those guys.

510
00:09:36,929 --> 00:09:37,809
So let me show you guys real

511
00:09:37,809 --> 00:09:38,179
quick.

512
00:09:38,179 --> 00:09:39,259
I searched up like health and

513
00:09:39,259 --> 00:09:40,450
wellness on Instagram or just

514
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:40,820
health.

515
00:09:40,929 --> 00:09:41,940
And then I found this guy and then

516
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,000
you want to go to his following,

517
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:43,379
right?

518
00:09:43,379 --> 00:09:44,429
So in this case, he only

519
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:45,559
follows himself on like his

520
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:46,429
personal account.

521
00:09:46,429 --> 00:09:47,559
So then if we go to his personal

522
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,750
account, this is what it

523
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:49,269
looks like.

524
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,600
He follows 800 people.

525
00:09:50,659 --> 00:09:51,879
So now, you know, one health and

526
00:09:51,909 --> 00:09:53,320
wellness guy, he probably

527
00:09:53,429 --> 00:09:54,690
follows other health and wellness

528
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:55,070
dudes.

529
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:56,320
So now I'm going to go through his

530
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,279
following and I'm going to

531
00:09:57,399 --> 00:09:58,860
find all the other people that

532
00:09:58,860 --> 00:09:59,669
match my ICP.

533
00:09:59,669 --> 00:10:01,230
So I'm going to one by one click

534
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:02,379
through every single

535
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:03,279
profile manually.

536
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:04,730
Yes, you heard that correctly.

537
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:05,879
And you're going to find the

538
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:07,330
profiles in here that you

539
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,100
like, or like the ones that are in

540
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:09,710
your ICP.

541
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:11,389
And then you're going to add them

542
00:10:11,389 --> 00:10:12,639
to a spreadsheet or

543
00:10:12,789 --> 00:10:14,210
whatever sort of tracker you use,

544
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:14,639
right?

545
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:15,779
So that's how you do it.

546
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:16,700
The reason why we're doing this

547
00:10:16,809 --> 00:10:17,899
manually instead of automated or

548
00:10:17,899 --> 00:10:19,090
something like that is because we

549
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:20,080
want to make sure that the

550
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,460
people we're collecting, like

551
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:22,799
these leads, they're actually

552
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:24,220
people we want to work with.

553
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:24,450
If you

554
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:25,730
automatically scrape a list,

555
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:26,909
you're going to get a ton of weird

556
00:10:26,909 --> 00:10:28,299
people who would never get results

557
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:28,899
on content.

558
00:10:28,899 --> 00:10:30,299
So that's one thing with a content

559
00:10:30,299 --> 00:10:30,750
agency.

560
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,049
You want to be specific with the

561
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:32,480
type of

562
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,480
people you work with.

563
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,649
And you really just want to work

564
00:10:34,779 --> 00:10:36,230
with people who you actually think

565
00:10:36,289 --> 00:10:36,659
will get

566
00:10:36,779 --> 00:10:37,070
results.

567
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:38,370
I mean, I think this goes without

568
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:39,629
saying for every type of agency,

569
00:10:39,629 --> 00:10:40,840
but specifically content

570
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:42,120
agencies, some people just aren't

571
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,159
built for being on camera.

572
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:44,259
You're going to keep repeating

573
00:10:44,299 --> 00:10:44,659
this to

574
00:10:44,779 --> 00:10:45,070
build a list.

575
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:45,990
Eventually you're going to go

576
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:46,740
through someone's entire

577
00:10:46,789 --> 00:10:47,279
following.

578
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,019
So in this case,

579
00:10:48,139 --> 00:10:49,419
that dude's following was what,

580
00:10:49,419 --> 00:10:50,500
like 800 people.

581
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:52,019
So then, you know, you're going to

582
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:52,759
go through 800

583
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:53,549
people pretty quick.

584
00:10:53,549 --> 00:10:54,679
You know, maybe you'll get like a

585
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:56,039
hundred people, 200 people from

586
00:10:56,039 --> 00:10:56,340
that.

587
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:56,700
So

588
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:57,889
you're going to want to go to the

589
00:10:57,889 --> 00:10:59,029
next person and just build up a

590
00:10:59,029 --> 00:10:59,350
list.

591
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:00,620
So typically I build up a list

592
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:02,169
of like a hundred people and I

593
00:11:02,169 --> 00:11:03,860
just reach out to them because I

594
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:05,659
know for every hundred people I

595
00:11:05,659 --> 00:11:05,860
reach

596
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:07,440
out to using the dream 100 method,

597
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,659
which is something I talk about a

598
00:11:08,659 --> 00:11:10,149
lot, I'm going to close one to two

599
00:11:10,299 --> 00:11:10,509
people.

600
00:11:10,509 --> 00:11:10,909
All right.

601
00:11:10,909 --> 00:11:11,730
I know what you're probably

602
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:12,649
wondering, like, what is the

603
00:11:12,659 --> 00:11:13,340
evaluation process

604
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:13,980
for these leads?

605
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:14,970
Like, how do we even know that

606
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:16,179
they're, you know, qualified?

607
00:11:16,179 --> 00:11:16,950
Like, obviously we

608
00:11:17,049 --> 00:11:18,259
go through this guy's following,

609
00:11:18,269 --> 00:11:19,299
you know, we find all these

610
00:11:19,299 --> 00:11:19,690
people.

611
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,139
How do we know like which ones to

612
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:21,629
go through?

613
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,669
Like, okay, this dude whiz of

614
00:11:22,669 --> 00:11:22,960
e-com.

615
00:11:23,019 --> 00:11:24,149
How do I know like, okay, this guy

616
00:11:24,149 --> 00:11:25,100
is a good fit or,

617
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,330
you know, what is the evaluation

618
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:26,789
process?

619
00:11:26,789 --> 00:11:28,090
So basically like number one, you

620
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:28,960
just want to look at their

621
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,000
social media profile, right?

622
00:11:30,029 --> 00:11:30,980
You want to see like, okay, do

623
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:32,059
they have a lot of followers?

624
00:11:32,059 --> 00:11:32,899
Do they look like

625
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:34,129
a noob in business?

626
00:11:34,169 --> 00:11:36,120
We're trying to assess if they can

627
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,379
afford our services, if they need

628
00:11:38,379 --> 00:11:38,759
them

629
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:39,940
and like, if they're a good fit,

630
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:40,289
right?

631
00:11:40,289 --> 00:11:41,299
So let's do a live analysis,

632
00:11:41,299 --> 00:11:41,649
right?

633
00:11:41,649 --> 00:11:42,480
I just went through

634
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,879
Oscar's following and I also just

635
00:11:43,879 --> 00:11:45,179
clicked around Instagram and I

636
00:11:45,179 --> 00:11:46,090
found this person.

637
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:46,850
So Colin,

638
00:11:47,019 --> 00:11:48,090
shout out Colin, great guy.

639
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:49,080
He's my friend's client.

640
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,309
So I'm not going to try and reach

641
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:50,899
out to him or

642
00:11:51,009 --> 00:11:52,259
anything like that, but let's do a

643
00:11:52,259 --> 00:11:53,740
live profile analysis on this guy.

644
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:55,059
So number one, we're going to

645
00:11:55,179 --> 00:11:56,159
check and see, okay, how many

646
00:11:56,159 --> 00:11:57,230
followers does this dude have?

647
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:57,659
Okay.

648
00:11:57,659 --> 00:11:58,919
He has 700,000.

649
00:11:58,940 --> 00:11:59,620
That's a lot of

650
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:00,110
followers.

651
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:00,529
Okay.

652
00:12:00,529 --> 00:12:00,950
Next up.

653
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:01,279
Okay.

654
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:01,789
Let's see.

655
00:12:01,789 --> 00:12:02,100
Okay.

656
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,049
He's posting a Lambo.

657
00:12:03,049 --> 00:12:03,830
He's out on like

658
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:04,639
yachts in Miami.

659
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:04,990
Okay.

660
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:05,340
Okay.

661
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:06,639
He's like, he's traveling.

662
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:07,840
He's flexing the watches.

663
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,210
Okay.

664
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:08,399
This

665
00:12:08,509 --> 00:12:09,600
guy clearly, you know, he has some

666
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,159
money, right?

667
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:11,370
Obviously some people are going to

668
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:12,009
be like flexing

669
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,409
on the internet and like they're

670
00:12:13,409 --> 00:12:14,690
fake, but you can tell by like

671
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:16,059
looking at their profile or

672
00:12:16,059 --> 00:12:16,240
digging

673
00:12:16,379 --> 00:12:16,850
deeper into them.

674
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:17,809
You'll, you'll be able to tell,

675
00:12:17,809 --> 00:12:18,730
but this guy, Colin, he's been

676
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:19,480
around for a while,

677
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:20,929
posting content, always posting ID

678
00:12:20,929 --> 00:12:21,399
stories.

679
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:22,720
He's got multiple businesses.

680
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,720
Like he's probably legit.

681
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:25,019
By the way, guys, I know Colin is

682
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:25,399
legit.

683
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:26,629
I'm just like putting myself in

684
00:12:26,629 --> 00:12:27,659
the shoes of like

685
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:29,200
I'm analyzing someone.

686
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,269
So basically I found the profile.

687
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:32,360
I analyze them.

688
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,200
So first thing I look

689
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:34,440
at the followers, I see, do we

690
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:35,379
have a ton of mutuals?

691
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:36,759
I'm looking at their lifestyle.

692
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:37,200
I'm just

693
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,320
trying to see, you know, if

694
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,370
they're a good fit other than

695
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,799
lifestyle and like how much money

696
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:41,179
they

697
00:12:41,299 --> 00:12:41,440
have.

698
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,460
You want to see if they're already

699
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:43,360
creating content, right?

700
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:44,500
So like this guy, he's creating a

701
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:45,210
ton of content.

702
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:45,519
Okay.

703
00:12:45,549 --> 00:12:46,809
He's probably a good fit to run up

704
00:12:46,809 --> 00:12:48,360
YouTube, or maybe you want to sell

705
00:12:48,379 --> 00:12:48,710
him short

706
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,110
for him.

707
00:12:49,169 --> 00:12:49,789
Same thing.

708
00:12:49,789 --> 00:12:50,789
He's making content.

709
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,149
So he probably makes money from

710
00:12:52,179 --> 00:12:53,460
his content so we can help him

711
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:54,759
make more money from his content.

712
00:12:54,759 --> 00:12:55,799
So next up, you'd also want to

713
00:12:55,799 --> 00:12:57,070
just look at his YouTube channel

714
00:12:57,139 --> 00:12:57,240
and

715
00:12:57,379 --> 00:12:58,090
his other socials.

716
00:12:58,090 --> 00:12:59,139
See if like his following is

717
00:12:59,149 --> 00:12:59,990
universal, right?

718
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:01,320
Cause some people, maybe they

719
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:02,570
buy followers on one social media

720
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:03,730
account and they have nothing

721
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:04,409
anywhere else.

722
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:05,200
So Colin, he's got

723
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:06,740
followers on Twitter and he's like

724
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:07,149
known.

725
00:13:07,149 --> 00:13:08,490
So I'm not going to do that, but

726
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:09,590
you just want to look at

727
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,929
someone's profiles because you can

728
00:13:10,929 --> 00:13:11,990
buy Instagram followers.

729
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:13,019
So you always just want to be

730
00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:13,559
careful.

731
00:13:13,649 --> 00:13:14,860
So going through here, I looked at

732
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:15,169
this.

733
00:13:15,179 --> 00:13:15,490
Okay.

734
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:16,500
He had a lot of followers.

735
00:13:16,509 --> 00:13:17,500
He doesn't look like a

736
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:17,850
noob.

737
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:19,210
So we didn't disqualify him.

738
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:19,649
Right.

739
00:13:19,649 --> 00:13:20,850
So now I'm going to show you a

740
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:22,620
profile who probably deserves

741
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:23,279
to be disqualified.

742
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:23,639
All right.

743
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:24,379
So let's say you just went

744
00:13:24,379 --> 00:13:25,250
through, you know, that guy

745
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:25,620
Oscar's

746
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:26,559
following and you find this guy

747
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:27,100
Cyrus, right?

748
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,000
You're looking through it.

749
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,250
Okay.

750
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:29,440
He has only 800 followers.

751
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:30,539
Like he doesn't have like a

752
00:13:30,539 --> 00:13:31,610
business in his bio or like

753
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,190
anything explaining what he does.

754
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:33,809
Like, okay.

755
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:34,940
It looks like, you know, he's

756
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:35,440
having fun.

757
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,559
He's like a, some sort of college

758
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:37,240
kid or something,

759
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,690
but there's no like business stuff

760
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:39,720
going on here, right?

761
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:40,960
It's just nothing like this

762
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:41,529
wouldn't be a good

763
00:13:41,659 --> 00:13:41,799
fit.

764
00:13:41,799 --> 00:13:42,990
We disqualify him right away.

765
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:44,100
And then like, you know, the

766
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,289
lifestyle doesn't check out,

767
00:13:45,419 --> 00:13:46,500
doesn't have followers.

768
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,470
He looks like a noob.

769
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:48,769
And then also like we check his

770
00:13:48,779 --> 00:13:49,659
funnel quality.

771
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:50,580
We'd look at this person's

772
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:51,299
website, right?

773
00:13:51,309 --> 00:13:52,590
So obviously this guy, Cyrus, you

774
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:53,379
know, shout out

775
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,970
Cyrus, but he doesn't have any

776
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:56,750
like website or funnel or anything

777
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:57,419
in his bio.

778
00:13:57,419 --> 00:13:58,600
So like, let's go back to

779
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,129
Oscar, for example, he's running

780
00:14:00,129 --> 00:14:01,210
like a DME word funnel.

781
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:02,490
So we can't really like look at

782
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:02,860
his,

783
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,419
you know, his website and see case

784
00:14:04,419 --> 00:14:05,990
studies and stuff, but he's saying

785
00:14:06,019 --> 00:14:07,960
he has 300 plus client results,

786
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,029
which is very, very good.

787
00:14:09,029 --> 00:14:10,129
Most people have zero also just

788
00:14:10,259 --> 00:14:11,299
scrolling through here.

789
00:14:11,299 --> 00:14:12,120
We can see he has a

790
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,669
good business because he's saying,

791
00:14:13,669 --> 00:14:15,169
Hey, lifetime of digestion issues

792
00:14:15,169 --> 00:14:15,960
fixed in weeks.

793
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,350
You know,

794
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,379
he he's saying, Oh, my hair is

795
00:14:17,409 --> 00:14:17,799
thicker.

796
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:18,070
Okay.

797
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:18,360
Okay.

798
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:18,529
Cool.

799
00:14:18,659 --> 00:14:18,919
Cool.

800
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:19,200
Cool.

801
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:19,970
So this guy has a ton of

802
00:14:20,139 --> 00:14:21,120
social proof, right?

803
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:21,779
So he's legit.

804
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,120
He has like another case study

805
00:14:23,149 --> 00:14:24,389
right here, right here.

806
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:24,669
He's

807
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:25,820
also saying he has like a ton of

808
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:26,500
testosterone.

809
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,389
So this guy's legit.

810
00:14:27,389 --> 00:14:28,639
That's what we're doing in this

811
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:29,759
funnel step is we're really just

812
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:30,809
checking like, okay, does this

813
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:32,139
person have a good business?

814
00:14:32,259 --> 00:14:32,480
Right?

815
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,610
Cause the last thing you want to

816
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:34,940
do is take on a client who has a

817
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,320
bad business and they

818
00:14:36,429 --> 00:14:37,450
don't get their clients results.

819
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:38,309
And they're maybe even just

820
00:14:38,309 --> 00:14:38,840
scammers.

821
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:39,860
So this is one good

822
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,039
way to check because if someone

823
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:42,350
has social proof, they typically

824
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:43,210
make money as well.

825
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,669
So next up, we're going to look at

826
00:14:44,669 --> 00:14:46,220
their content success level.

827
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:48,009
Even if someone has like bad

828
00:14:48,139 --> 00:14:49,210
views on their content, we can

829
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:49,940
still sign them.

830
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:50,190
Right.

831
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,350
But this is just good to get a

832
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:51,629
pulse

833
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:53,309
on like, where are they at and

834
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,960
where could they want to be?

835
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,720
It just gives you ammo for your

836
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,039
pitch.

837
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:58,789
So like here, I know I said, Hey,

838
00:14:58,789 --> 00:15:00,320
if it says no, like disqualify

839
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,370
them, but that's not actually

840
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:01,590
true.

841
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:02,340
So I'm going to delete that.

842
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:02,659
All right.

843
00:15:02,669 --> 00:15:03,389
So everything looks good.

844
00:15:03,389 --> 00:15:03,899
So now we're moving

845
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:04,590
on to the pitch.

846
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:05,720
So before we pitch, we want to

847
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:06,500
just add them all to a

848
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,190
spreadsheet,

849
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,029
keep it organized.

850
00:15:08,029 --> 00:15:09,379
Like, Hey, here's all the leads.

851
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,620
You also want to have a tab that

852
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:10,809
says

853
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:12,059
like follow-up number one,

854
00:15:12,059 --> 00:15:13,350
follow-up number two, or like

855
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,779
first message sent rejected sales

856
00:15:15,899 --> 00:15:16,169
call book.

857
00:15:16,179 --> 00:15:17,129
This is basically going to be a

858
00:15:17,129 --> 00:15:17,340
CRM.

859
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:18,230
You want to keep it simple.

860
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:18,950
You could use a

861
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:19,450
spreadsheet.

862
00:15:19,539 --> 00:15:20,669
You can use Trello notion to click

863
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:21,960
up all those types of softwares.

864
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,389
And we're

865
00:15:22,529 --> 00:15:24,179
going to do custom high quality

866
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,009
outreach.

867
00:15:25,009 --> 00:15:26,789
So let me repeat that custom high

868
00:15:26,899 --> 00:15:27,779
quality outreach.

869
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:29,639
We are not going to do copy paste,

870
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,759
stupid, cool DMS, like those email

871
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:32,940
people who are like,

872
00:15:33,389 --> 00:15:34,120
Hey, do you, are you doing

873
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,159
anything with email right now?

874
00:15:35,169 --> 00:15:36,279
You know, we don't want to be a

875
00:15:36,279 --> 00:15:36,440
short

876
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:37,259
form content, bro.

877
00:15:37,259 --> 00:15:38,519
Who's like, Hey, do you need short

878
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:39,139
form content?

879
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:39,720
Like, no.

880
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,279
So we're going to do

881
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:41,629
custom high quality outreach.

882
00:15:41,629 --> 00:15:42,899
So what this means is we're going

883
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:44,100
to send them free short form

884
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:44,340
videos

885
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:44,830
upfront.

886
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:46,100
We're going to send them content

887
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,039
strategy documents.

888
00:15:47,049 --> 00:15:48,700
We're going to send them fricking

889
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:49,190
like

890
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,129
just stuff like looms, you know,

891
00:15:51,129 --> 00:15:52,950
scripts, content ideas, a loom

892
00:15:53,009 --> 00:15:54,740
analysis of their content.

893
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:54,940
Like

894
00:15:55,139 --> 00:15:56,039
really just going to send them

895
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:56,840
free stuff upfront.

896
00:15:56,899 --> 00:15:57,820
This is custom high quality

897
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:58,360
outreach.

898
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,080
And this works so

899
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:00,509
well, because if you invest like

900
00:16:00,509 --> 00:16:02,070
30 minutes to an hour and a single

901
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:03,679
outreach, and the person sees

902
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:05,110
that, which they will after the

903
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:06,590
enormous amount of follow-ups,

904
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,049
they're going to almost feel bad

905
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:08,279
for

906
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:09,580
not answering you because you're

907
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:10,730
putting so much time into it,

908
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:11,100
right?

909
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,259
This is what we want to do.

910
00:16:12,379 --> 00:16:13,279
When you just text someone, Hey,

911
00:16:13,309 --> 00:16:14,289
do you need short form content?

912
00:16:14,289 --> 00:16:15,279
Hey, do you need a YouTube?

913
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:16,309
Like it's

914
00:16:16,429 --> 00:16:17,679
so easy to leave you on open.

915
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:19,309
Cause like, you're just like every

916
00:16:19,309 --> 00:16:20,690
other person, number one.

917
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:21,419
And number

918
00:16:21,539 --> 00:16:22,559
two, why should I respond to

919
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:23,799
someone if they're not putting

920
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:24,850
enough effort, right?

921
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:25,580
I already have

922
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,009
enough people reaching out to me.

923
00:16:27,009 --> 00:16:28,220
So that's sort of how you want to

924
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,480
do your outreach in terms of

925
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,080
follow-ups.

926
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,399
You want to just keep following up

927
00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:32,580
until they say yes, or they say

928
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:32,950
no.

929
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,399
So the follow-ups

930
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:35,850
like you typically want to do one,

931
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:37,250
two days later, one, like a week

932
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,740
later, one, like two weeks later,

933
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:40,200
and you just keep going and going

934
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,480
with the follow-ups like for

935
00:16:41,509 --> 00:16:42,100
eternity.

936
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,590
At one point, you'll reduce

937
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,570
the frequency until it's like one

938
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:47,210
follow-up like per month.

939
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:49,139
So it'll be like super low effort

940
00:16:49,269 --> 00:16:49,549
on your

941
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:50,759
end, but we're just going to

942
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:52,240
continuously touch base with this

943
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:52,710
person.

944
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:53,929
And eventually it will work.

945
00:16:54,269 --> 00:16:55,529
Obviously there's going to be like

946
00:16:55,529 --> 00:16:56,830
a couple people where like, they

947
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:57,909
just never open the DM,

948
00:16:58,059 --> 00:16:58,669
but that's fine.

949
00:16:58,669 --> 00:16:59,899
We also want to reach out to these

950
00:16:59,899 --> 00:17:01,440
people in an omni-channel manner.

951
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:01,960
So that means

952
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,320
like hit them up on Instagram,

953
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,109
fricking Twitter, email, LinkedIn,

954
00:17:05,109 --> 00:17:05,799
everywhere.

955
00:17:05,799 --> 00:17:06,809
And then eventually

956
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:08,029
this is going to lead up to a

957
00:17:08,049 --> 00:17:08,730
sales call.

958
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:10,190
So one thing I want to mention as

959
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:11,380
well is another way of

960
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,470
finding people like other than

961
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:13,380
Instagram and Twitter and

962
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,480
LinkedIn, which is the method I

963
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:14,940
was talking

964
00:17:15,059 --> 00:17:15,259
about.

965
00:17:15,259 --> 00:17:16,269
You can do YouTube, right?

966
00:17:16,269 --> 00:17:17,440
So on YouTube, you could search up

967
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,549
like how to make money online

968
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,119
and you'll find like those gurus

969
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:21,588
or you'll search up how to get in

970
00:17:21,588 --> 00:17:22,500
better shape.

971
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,180
You'll find like the

972
00:17:23,289 --> 00:17:23,970
fitness coaches.

973
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:25,150
And then you can go to the about

974
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:26,328
section and you can grab their

975
00:17:26,328 --> 00:17:26,789
email.

976
00:17:26,859 --> 00:17:27,220
They also

977
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:28,430
usually have their social media

978
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:29,400
accounts listed there.

979
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:30,569
So that's a good way of finding

980
00:17:30,569 --> 00:17:31,140
someone.

981
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:32,440
So yeah, guys, that's the whole

982
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:33,680
thing on how to find high paying

983
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,079
clients for your content agency.

984
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,380
Today, I just signed someone for

985
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:37,859
like 4.5K a month, also closed

986
00:17:37,859 --> 00:17:39,440
like a one-off project and

987
00:17:39,549 --> 00:17:40,940
things are going good with the

988
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:41,480
agency.

989
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,259
So I still use this method today.

990
00:17:43,259 --> 00:17:44,980
Is this the only method I use?

991
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:46,000
No, this is half.

992
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,609
The other method I use is personal

993
00:17:47,609 --> 00:17:48,900
branding and inbound,

994
00:17:49,019 --> 00:17:50,509
but like I use this to go from 0

995
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:52,460
to 15K a month in four months.

996
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:54,180
And then I use this method

997
00:17:54,299 --> 00:17:54,900
combined

998
00:17:55,019 --> 00:17:56,660
with the inbound personal branding

999
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,640
method to go from 0 to 93K a month

1000
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,750
in 15 months.

1001
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:00,220
All right,

1002
00:18:00,339 --> 00:18:01,390
guys, that's everything for this

1003
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:02,390
video, but I want you to watch

1004
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:03,720
this video on screen because I

1005
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:03,829
went

1006
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:06,160
over how I scale from 0 to 93.5K a

1007
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,029
month in 15 months as a content

1008
00:18:08,029 --> 00:18:08,609
agency.

1009
00:18:08,609 --> 00:18:10,089
So I'm not a freelancer,

1010
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:10,960
I'm a content agency.

1011
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,140
But if you're a freelancer right

1012
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:13,519
now, you could easily transition

1013
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:14,240
into a content

1014
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:14,630
agency.

1015
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:15,259
So that's it.

1016
00:18:15,289 --> 00:18:16,410
Hope you enjoyed that video.

1017
00:18:16,539 --> 00:18:17,180
And that's it.

1018
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:17,849
Peace out.

1019
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,019
All right,

1020
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:18,869
guys, welcome back.

1021
00:18:18,869 --> 00:18:20,109
So once you have your spreadsheet,

1022
00:18:20,109 --> 00:18:21,039
you can like move them into

1023
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:21,440
Trello,

1024
00:18:21,549 --> 00:18:23,069
which is like a free CRM.

1025
00:18:23,069 --> 00:18:25,029
So I'm going to cut into another

1026
00:18:25,029 --> 00:18:26,539
video now, just walking through

1027
00:18:26,539 --> 00:18:27,140
how to

1028
00:18:27,259 --> 00:18:28,599
keep your Trello board organized.

1029
00:18:28,599 --> 00:18:29,690
Hey, what's up, everybody?

1030
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:30,920
So today I'm going to show you how

1031
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:31,140
to

1032
00:18:31,259 --> 00:18:32,440
stay organized while you're

1033
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:33,759
outreaching a hundred dream

1034
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:35,509
prospects, because a hundred dream

1035
00:18:35,619 --> 00:18:35,930
prospects,

1036
00:18:36,059 --> 00:18:36,940
like that's a lot of people.

1037
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:38,119
I don't think you guys understand.

1038
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,500
You know, you could fill up like,

1039
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:41,099
I don't know, three classrooms or

1040
00:18:41,099 --> 00:18:41,890
something, right?

1041
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:43,220
So three high school classrooms.

1042
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:43,680
So

1043
00:18:43,809 --> 00:18:45,230
basically real quick, I'm going to

1044
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:46,490
show you how to stay organized

1045
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:47,240
with a free CRM.

1046
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:47,759
You know,

1047
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,250
most CRMs cost money.

1048
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:50,730
Trello.com is free.

1049
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:53,000
Um, yeah, let's get right into it.

1050
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:53,900
I was about to

1051
00:18:54,009 --> 00:18:55,329
mention an affiliate link, but I

1052
00:18:55,329 --> 00:18:56,740
don't even think Trello has any,

1053
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:57,940
and it's free anyways.

1054
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:58,980
So basically

1055
00:18:59,099 --> 00:19:00,740
you're going to go to Trello.com.

1056
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:02,130
You're going to make a Trello

1057
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:03,930
board, call it dream 100 lead

1058
00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:04,269
list,

1059
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:05,529
and then you're going to make a

1060
00:19:05,569 --> 00:19:05,900
list.

1061
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,359
So whenever I see the word list,

1062
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:08,859
this is what I'm referring to,

1063
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,470
like a column, right?

1064
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,559
So you're going to make lists.

1065
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:14,150
Each list is a cat is like a

1066
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,089
status that

1067
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,200
the person, the prospect is in.

1068
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:19,410
And whenever I say card, you know,

1069
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:20,859
like it's a prospect,

1070
00:19:21,019 --> 00:19:22,099
like this is a card.

1071
00:19:22,099 --> 00:19:23,710
So let me just delete this.

1072
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:25,269
So basically lead in, this is

1073
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,049
where we're going to

1074
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:27,970
import those 100 leads.

1075
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:29,670
Next up, we have first message

1076
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:30,190
sent.

1077
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:32,000
So whenever you send the first

1078
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:32,380
message,

1079
00:19:32,579 --> 00:19:35,170
you take Johnny, put him in here.

1080
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:36,210
All right.

1081
00:19:36,339 --> 00:19:39,900
Two days pass, you know, you set a

1082
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:40,720
thing here so you

1083
00:19:40,839 --> 00:19:42,750
can go here and then you go dates.

1084
00:19:42,789 --> 00:19:44,470
You could set a due date for two

1085
00:19:44,599 --> 00:19:45,480
days from now.

1086
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,470
So today's March

1087
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:46,980
9th.

1088
00:19:47,079 --> 00:19:49,200
So two days from now by 9 30 PM,

1089
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,059
you're going to do a followup.

1090
00:19:51,059 --> 00:19:53,019
So now here he's chilling in first

1091
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:53,640
message sent.

1092
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,059
And then March 11th, that's going

1093
00:19:55,059 --> 00:19:56,109
to say, Oh, this card is due

1094
00:19:56,119 --> 00:19:56,440
today.

1095
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,390
You're going to know

1096
00:19:57,519 --> 00:19:58,960
that you have to send your first

1097
00:19:58,960 --> 00:19:59,569
followup.

1098
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,009
So boom, you sent your first

1099
00:20:01,079 --> 00:20:01,690
followup.

1100
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02,460
And then next

1101
00:20:02,579 --> 00:20:04,539
up, you're changed the due date.

1102
00:20:04,579 --> 00:20:06,319
So you go here, change the due

1103
00:20:06,339 --> 00:20:09,420
date to like two days again, save.

1104
00:20:09,539 --> 00:20:11,170
Now, you know, okay, March 13th,

1105
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:12,579
whenever that day comes up, it's

1106
00:20:12,579 --> 00:20:14,240
going to say, Oh, due today, then

1107
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:14,369
boom,

1108
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:15,569
you have to send the second

1109
00:20:15,569 --> 00:20:16,130
followup.

1110
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:17,519
And then the best part is you have

1111
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:18,349
a calendar here.

1112
00:20:18,349 --> 00:20:19,039
So right there,

1113
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:20,420
it said March 13th.

1114
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:21,210
So let me see.

1115
00:20:21,339 --> 00:20:22,779
Oh, I don't think I can see the

1116
00:20:22,849 --> 00:20:24,319
calendar because you need to

1117
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:26,509
pay, but basically Trello premium,

1118
00:20:26,509 --> 00:20:28,220
super cheap, but you could just

1119
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,980
see your whole calendar.

1120
00:20:30,109 --> 00:20:30,190
You're

1121
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:31,539
going to see, Oh, I have to do

1122
00:20:31,539 --> 00:20:32,940
this many followups here, this

1123
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,400
many followups on Tuesday, so on

1124
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:34,799
and so

1125
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,160
forth.

1126
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,559
But I have the free version, so I

1127
00:20:36,619 --> 00:20:37,900
can't do it, but you don't need

1128
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:38,160
it.

1129
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,359
You just look at the dates

1130
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:40,079
on the card.

1131
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:41,529
So first message sent, first

1132
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:43,259
followup sent, second followup

1133
00:20:43,259 --> 00:20:44,400
sent, and it just keeps

1134
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:45,779
going and going and going.

1135
00:20:45,779 --> 00:20:47,490
And then after fifth followup, you

1136
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,900
have the elder statuses.

1137
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:49,349
So you have

1138
00:20:49,509 --> 00:20:51,380
meeting booked, deal lost, and

1139
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:52,130
pipeline.

1140
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:53,769
So meeting booked, this is

1141
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,539
basically once you put them in for

1142
00:20:55,589 --> 00:20:57,049
a meeting, you put them here, deal

1143
00:20:57,049 --> 00:20:57,359
lost.

1144
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:58,700
This is, you know, you had the

1145
00:20:58,700 --> 00:20:59,910
sales call with them and they

1146
00:21:00,099 --> 00:21:01,390
told you, Hey, I don't want to

1147
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:02,150
work with you.

1148
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:03,069
Boom, deal lost.

1149
00:21:03,079 --> 00:21:04,710
And pipeline is, you know, you had

1150
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:04,930
the

1151
00:21:05,109 --> 00:21:06,230
meeting, but then you kind of

1152
00:21:06,269 --> 00:21:07,359
fumbled it a little bit.

1153
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:08,430
You know, you didn't get a

1154
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:09,599
decision on the call.

1155
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:10,450
You know, they're still kind of

1156
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:11,019
thinking about it.

1157
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:11,769
Maybe you have a second meeting

1158
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:12,220
booked.

1159
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:12,920
Maybe you're

1160
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:13,890
working on getting a second

1161
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:15,079
meeting book, all those types of

1162
00:21:15,079 --> 00:21:16,519
things where it's kind of messy a

1163
00:21:16,519 --> 00:21:16,619
little

1164
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:18,380
bit just goes in pipeline.

1165
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,630
So that's how everything looks in

1166
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:22,720
terms of importing the leads.

1167
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,460
We got the

1168
00:21:23,569 --> 00:21:24,130
spreadsheet.

1169
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:25,200
So what you're going to do is

1170
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,430
you're going to click the first

1171
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:27,480
person you're going to

1172
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:28,970
hold shift, and then you're going

1173
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:30,579
to hit the last 100th person.

1174
00:21:30,619 --> 00:21:31,710
And then you're going to do

1175
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,599
command C

1176
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:33,420
or control C.

1177
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:35,309
If you're on windows, you're going

1178
00:21:35,309 --> 00:21:36,619
to hit add card and then do

1179
00:21:36,619 --> 00:21:37,880
command V hit add card

1180
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:39,190
and then create five cards.

1181
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:40,549
And that's going to create five

1182
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:40,960
cards.

1183
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,319
And then next, so you got to do

1184
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:42,460
this

1185
00:21:42,569 --> 00:21:43,549
manually, you can get a VA for

1186
00:21:43,549 --> 00:21:44,839
this, but probably best to just do

1187
00:21:44,839 --> 00:21:45,480
it manually.

1188
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,619
You could just go

1189
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,039
here, click Andre, go to the

1190
00:21:48,039 --> 00:21:49,819
Google sheet, grab his Instagram,

1191
00:21:49,819 --> 00:21:50,990
you can go like boom.

1192
00:21:51,099 --> 00:21:51,900
Next, you're

1193
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:53,000
going to type Instagram.

1194
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:53,660
Boom.

1195
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:56,519
You're going to grab the freaking

1196
00:21:56,519 --> 00:21:58,980
email, which you know, I didn't

1197
00:21:58,980 --> 00:21:59,140
want

1198
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:00,339
to show his email just for

1199
00:22:00,339 --> 00:22:02,039
transparency purposes, because

1200
00:22:02,039 --> 00:22:02,750
he's a homie.

1201
00:22:02,819 --> 00:22:04,220
But next up, what did I just

1202
00:22:04,339 --> 00:22:04,920
grab Twitter?

1203
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,170
So you're going to say you just

1204
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:07,160
put his Twitter link.

1205
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:08,279
And then next, we're going to grab

1206
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,180
LinkedIn.

1207
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:10,690
You can go like this.

1208
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:12,180
Boom, boom, boom.

1209
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,539
And then, you know, that's how you

1210
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:14,910
do it.

1211
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:15,140
You just

1212
00:22:15,259 --> 00:22:16,569
put all his social media links

1213
00:22:16,569 --> 00:22:17,019
there.

1214
00:22:17,029 --> 00:22:17,769
You hit save.

1215
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:18,960
And then so we hit save.

1216
00:22:19,019 --> 00:22:19,349
Boom.

1217
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:21,480
So now lead in, we see

1218
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:22,690
all of his socials there.

1219
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:23,809
Feel free to add any other

1220
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:25,339
comments, anything else you want

1221
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:25,849
to put in the

1222
00:22:26,049 --> 00:22:26,660
description.

1223
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:27,880
You're just going to go and do

1224
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,470
this for all 100 people manual

1225
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:29,980
process.

1226
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:31,000
But trust me, this is

1227
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:31,829
how you make money.

1228
00:22:31,829 --> 00:22:33,079
And this is also where most people

1229
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:33,430
quit.

1230
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:34,069
They get lazy.

1231
00:22:34,069 --> 00:22:34,819
So don't quit.

1232
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:36,779
Once you get all the leads in

1233
00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:38,200
here, you filled up all their

1234
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:39,700
info, you know, you put all their

1235
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:40,180
social

1236
00:22:40,299 --> 00:22:40,900
media pages.

1237
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,349
By the way, feel free to skip the

1238
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,130
spreadsheet.

1239
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:44,549
I just like doing that for some

1240
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:45,079
reason.

1241
00:22:45,079 --> 00:22:46,299
But basically, once you get

1242
00:22:46,299 --> 00:22:47,819
everybody in here, that's when you

1243
00:22:47,819 --> 00:22:48,230
start.

1244
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:49,059
So you're going to

1245
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,200
go through the process.

1246
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,130
First message sent.

1247
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:51,539
Boom.

1248
00:22:51,539 --> 00:22:52,579
First follow up sent.

1249
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:52,920
Boom.

1250
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:54,160
Second follow up sent and

1251
00:22:54,279 --> 00:22:55,160
keeps going and going.

1252
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,230
I know you guys are probably

1253
00:22:56,289 --> 00:22:57,630
wondering, bro, what message do I

1254
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:57,970
send?

1255
00:22:57,970 --> 00:22:58,500
What's the

1256
00:22:58,619 --> 00:22:59,220
follow ups look like?

1257
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:00,180
All that stuff that's going to be

1258
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:00,789
in the next video.

1259
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:01,750
I'm just showing you how to

1260
00:23:01,869 --> 00:23:02,970
organize everything.

1261
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:04,170
So that's what you do.

1262
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:05,779
And then once the person once the

1263
00:23:05,779 --> 00:23:06,319
prospect

1264
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:08,380
reaches like meeting booked, and

1265
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:09,920
then right after you do the

1266
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,599
meeting, you want to add some

1267
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,339
notes in

1268
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:13,700
the you can add a comment right

1269
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:14,079
here.

1270
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:15,490
You're going to say, hey, you

1271
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:16,900
know, I did the meeting with

1272
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:17,200
Andre.

1273
00:23:17,299 --> 00:23:17,690
He was a G.

1274
00:23:17,779 --> 00:23:19,019
He was super nice, but he didn't

1275
00:23:19,079 --> 00:23:20,099
fuck with the pricing.

1276
00:23:20,099 --> 00:23:21,410
You know, you could just write

1277
00:23:21,529 --> 00:23:22,730
whatever you want here.

1278
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:24,150
And then this is going to like

1279
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:25,559
make sure that you know what

1280
00:23:25,559 --> 00:23:26,359
happened on the

1281
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,230
meeting, because trust me, you're

1282
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:27,970
going to forget you're going to

1283
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:28,759
get so many meetings from

1284
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:29,130
this.

1285
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:30,519
You're just going to forget what

1286
00:23:30,579 --> 00:23:31,160
happened.

1287
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,660
So you need all that info just in

1288
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:33,019
one

1289
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:33,819
place.

1290
00:23:33,819 --> 00:23:36,460
This is like your sales brain.

1291
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,319
So after the meetings book, you

1292
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:39,630
didn't close them.

1293
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:39,960
He goes

1294
00:23:40,069 --> 00:23:40,630
pipeline.

1295
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:42,130
There's also one more deal one,

1296
00:23:42,259 --> 00:23:43,450
which is the best one.

1297
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:45,039
So once you close the deal, it

1298
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:45,200
goes

1299
00:23:45,319 --> 00:23:45,519
here.

1300
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:46,609
If you lose the deal, it goes

1301
00:23:46,609 --> 00:23:46,920
here.

1302
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:48,150
Pipeline, you want to make sure

1303
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,200
you keep adding notes,

1304
00:23:49,319 --> 00:23:50,619
keep adding due dates for more

1305
00:23:50,619 --> 00:23:52,190
follow ups, so on and so forth.

1306
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:53,700
You can even add more lists for

1307
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:53,920
more

1308
00:23:54,039 --> 00:23:55,509
follow ups for this sort of stage.

1309
00:23:55,509 --> 00:23:57,029
You know, the post meeting follow

1310
00:23:57,059 --> 00:23:57,670
up stage.

1311
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,380
You know,

1312
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,779
the best part about Trello is it's

1313
00:23:59,779 --> 00:24:01,079
so flexible and it's so easy.

1314
00:24:01,079 --> 00:24:02,619
You could just edit this however

1315
00:24:02,619 --> 00:24:02,750
you

1316
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:03,170
want.

1317
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:04,839
So yeah, guys, that's how you set

1318
00:24:04,839 --> 00:24:06,369
up a free CRM and how you organize

1319
00:24:06,369 --> 00:24:07,170
everything.

1320
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,339
And that's it.

1321
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:09,650
I'll see you in the next video.

1322
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:10,599
I'm going to break down the

1323
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,480
message templates, first messages

1324
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:12,789
and

1325
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:13,299
follow ups.

1326
00:24:13,299 --> 00:24:13,779
Peace.

1327
00:24:13,779 --> 00:24:14,200
Okay.

1328
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:14,769
Welcome back.

1329
00:24:14,769 --> 00:24:15,849
Next, we're going to talk about

1330
00:24:15,849 --> 00:24:17,029
what to send in your outreach to

1331
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,390
the free work so that you can send

1332
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:19,869
free video scripts, whether it's

1333
00:24:19,869 --> 00:24:21,099
short form or long form.

1334
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:22,630
And next, you can send free short

1335
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:23,269
form videos.

1336
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,839
You have to look at their podcasts

1337
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:25,599
and their YouTube

1338
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:27,210
videos and like repurpose their

1339
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:28,839
content into a reel and send them

1340
00:24:28,839 --> 00:24:30,339
the reel up front in the first

1341
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:30,819
message.

1342
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,240
Don't worry, the next part I'm

1343
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,690
showing the outreach script.

1344
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:34,700
Next is thumbnails.

1345
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:35,289
You can like

1346
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:36,730
make a new thumbnail from their

1347
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:37,650
current content.

1348
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:39,390
This is a YouTube video thumbnail.

1349
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,420
You can also do

1350
00:24:40,529 --> 00:24:42,329
video ideas and like a content

1351
00:24:42,329 --> 00:24:43,410
strategy doc.

1352
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:45,549
And you can also do a free audit.

1353
00:24:45,549 --> 00:24:46,579
I forgot to write this

1354
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:46,970
one down.

1355
00:24:47,029 --> 00:24:48,119
But the video ideas and content

1356
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:49,140
strategy one, this is like a

1357
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:50,319
document that says like, hey,

1358
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,509
here's like 12 video ideas.

1359
00:24:51,509 --> 00:24:52,650
Here's why I think these will work

1360
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:53,420
for your channel.

1361
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:54,609
Let me know if you

1362
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:56,380
want to like turn these videos

1363
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:57,539
into reality.

1364
00:24:57,539 --> 00:24:59,400
You CTA into booking a call.

1365
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,839
Free audit is like a loom.

1366
00:25:01,029 --> 00:25:01,650
You're like, hey, this is

1367
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:02,529
everything you're doing wrong on

1368
00:25:02,529 --> 00:25:03,380
your channel and what you should

1369
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:03,680
be doing

1370
00:25:03,809 --> 00:25:04,180
instead.

1371
00:25:04,279 --> 00:25:06,000
Remember, guys, the main thing to

1372
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,609
keep in mind in the content agency

1373
00:25:07,609 --> 00:25:08,400
space is like

1374
00:25:08,509 --> 00:25:09,759
everybody's like pitching editing,

1375
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:10,849
but it's like no one cares about

1376
00:25:10,849 --> 00:25:11,279
editing.

1377
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:11,650
We care.

1378
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:12,460
The prospects care

1379
00:25:12,619 --> 00:25:13,839
about making more money and the

1380
00:25:13,839 --> 00:25:15,230
editing isn't going to do that.

1381
00:25:15,269 --> 00:25:16,200
Like I can make more

1382
00:25:16,309 --> 00:25:18,079
money off an unedited video than

1383
00:25:18,089 --> 00:25:19,069
an edited one.

1384
00:25:19,069 --> 00:25:21,029
Not to say that not editing videos

1385
00:25:21,029 --> 00:25:21,380
is better.

1386
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:21,480
But

1387
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,990
what I'm trying to say is editing

1388
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:24,299
isn't actually what makes or

1389
00:25:24,299 --> 00:25:25,269
breaks the video.

1390
00:25:25,319 --> 00:25:26,140
What makes or breaks

1391
00:25:26,259 --> 00:25:27,900
the video is the idea, the title,

1392
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,750
the script, the speaking skills,

1393
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:31,019
the CTA, et cetera.

1394
00:25:31,019 --> 00:25:32,359
So you need

1395
00:25:32,509 --> 00:25:33,589
to always make sure you're not

1396
00:25:33,589 --> 00:25:34,950
positioning yourself as an editor

1397
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:36,279
and you're making it super clear

1398
00:25:36,299 --> 00:25:36,440
that

1399
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:37,519
you're not an editor.

1400
00:25:37,519 --> 00:25:38,779
So that's why I like sending

1401
00:25:38,779 --> 00:25:39,329
scripts.

1402
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:40,809
I like sending content strategy

1403
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:41,579
docs and doing

1404
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,529
loom audits as well.

1405
00:25:42,529 --> 00:25:43,730
Free work is going to make you

1406
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:44,480
guys stand out.

1407
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,559
So just make sure you actually do

1408
00:25:45,559 --> 00:25:45,640
it.

1409
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:47,150
And before anybody asks, you're

1410
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:48,529
sending the free work up front.

1411
00:25:48,539 --> 00:25:50,079
Basically, we're going to write an

1412
00:25:50,099 --> 00:25:50,769
outreach script

1413
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:51,130
live.

1414
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:53,140
So you need to make sure it's

1415
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:53,480
personalized.

1416
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,410
Naturally, it's personalized

1417
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,750
because we have the

1418
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,710
free value in there.

1419
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:57,930
And then you're going to give the

1420
00:25:58,059 --> 00:25:59,480
link to the value and then you're

1421
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,049
going to kind of push

1422
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,509
them into doing what's next.

1423
00:26:01,509 --> 00:26:03,009
So in terms of what this actually

1424
00:26:03,009 --> 00:26:04,579
looks like, instead of just a ton

1425
00:26:04,579 --> 00:26:04,700
of

1426
00:26:04,819 --> 00:26:05,900
yeah, I'm going to show you a

1427
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,440
script, but like, it's actually in

1428
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:08,880
your best benefit to tweak this

1429
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,069
script

1430
00:26:09,259 --> 00:26:10,150
because there's going to be some

1431
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:11,200
people in this course who are just

1432
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,339
like, well, I'm just going to

1433
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:14,410
copy this, but you should actually

1434
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:16,329
try and learn how I'm doing it.

1435
00:26:16,329 --> 00:26:18,089
So you can craft your own slightly

1436
00:26:18,269 --> 00:26:18,839
different one.

1437
00:26:18,839 --> 00:26:19,359
Okay.

1438
00:26:19,359 --> 00:26:21,559
So first things first, you need to

1439
00:26:21,559 --> 00:26:22,990
like get your way in.

1440
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:24,299
So you're going to be

1441
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:27,150
like, Hey, first name, I made this

1442
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:30,019
free value for you, depending on

1443
00:26:30,019 --> 00:26:31,910
what it is, it's going to tweak

1444
00:26:32,099 --> 00:26:32,740
the next part.

1445
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:34,259
So let's say it's, Hey Johnny, I

1446
00:26:34,279 --> 00:26:35,789
made this free YouTube script for

1447
00:26:35,789 --> 00:26:36,180
you.

1448
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:37,259
And then from

1449
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:39,059
there, I like even pitching a free

1450
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:39,900
video on top.

1451
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,430
So I go like, if you're down to

1452
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:43,240
record it, I'll do the

1453
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:47,099
editing, thumbnail, SEO, and even

1454
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:49,410
the posting for you.

1455
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:52,539
Let me know if you're up for it,

1456
00:26:52,539 --> 00:26:53,789
or if you want

1457
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:54,869
to jump on a call.

1458
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,690
So you'd obviously like changes

1459
00:26:56,690 --> 00:26:58,190
for whatever free value.

1460
00:26:58,299 --> 00:26:59,539
But in this case, I'm talking

1461
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:01,359
about scripts, free scripts for

1462
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:01,710
you.

1463
00:27:01,839 --> 00:27:03,289
Hey Johnny, I made this free

1464
00:27:03,349 --> 00:27:04,259
script for you.

1465
00:27:04,259 --> 00:27:05,259
If you're down to

1466
00:27:05,369 --> 00:27:06,819
record, I'll do the editing,

1467
00:27:06,819 --> 00:27:08,359
thumbnail, SEO, and even the

1468
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:10,049
posting for you, all for free for

1469
00:27:10,069 --> 00:27:10,740
the first

1470
00:27:10,849 --> 00:27:12,420
video, or you could say first

1471
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:13,630
video on the house.

1472
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:15,430
So what we're doing here is we're

1473
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:16,660
saying, Hey, first

1474
00:27:16,779 --> 00:27:18,420
name, what have, like, what have

1475
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,240
we done here?

1476
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,910
I made this free script for you.

1477
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:21,900
And then we say like,

1478
00:27:22,019 --> 00:27:23,440
what is kind of like the next step

1479
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,150
that they have to take from there.

1480
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,680
So the next step is they have

1481
00:27:26,769 --> 00:27:27,279
to record it.

1482
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:28,430
And then we're kind of helping

1483
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:29,339
them know what to say.

1484
00:27:29,339 --> 00:27:30,619
So we're also keeping the message

1485
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:31,289
very concise.

1486
00:27:31,289 --> 00:27:32,380
I was reviewing some outreach

1487
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,869
scripts the other day from content

1488
00:27:33,869 --> 00:27:34,619
agencies in my

1489
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:35,220
program.

1490
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,599
And they're just so long and

1491
00:27:36,599 --> 00:27:37,079
stuff.

1492
00:27:37,079 --> 00:27:38,460
This is like before we do our

1493
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,579
onboarding call where I

1494
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,400
like fixed it.

1495
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,119
But it's like, sometimes they come

1496
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:43,559
into working with me with like

1497
00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:44,549
these stupid long

1498
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:45,569
outreach scripts.

1499
00:27:45,569 --> 00:27:46,910
And I'm just like, no, we need

1500
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:47,819
like three lines.

1501
00:27:47,819 --> 00:27:49,299
This is roughly what it should

1502
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:49,960
look like.

1503
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,730
Of course, again, guys, please

1504
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:52,910
make sure to tweak it.

1505
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:54,579
Don't rip this word for word.

1506
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:55,779
And I'm

1507
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:57,359
saying this in your best interest,

1508
00:27:57,359 --> 00:27:58,799
because if everybody is sending

1509
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:00,150
the same script, it's not really

1510
00:28:00,369 --> 00:28:01,230
going to work.

1511
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:03,349
So keep it short, keep it concise,

1512
00:28:03,349 --> 00:28:05,329
say, always keep the prospect in

1513
00:28:05,329 --> 00:28:05,809
mind.

1514
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:06,440
Don't be

1515
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,420
like, I, I, I, I, I, I, I be like

1516
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:09,789
you, you, you, you.

1517
00:28:09,789 --> 00:28:11,619
So it's like, obviously, here I

1518
00:28:11,619 --> 00:28:12,579
have to say I

1519
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:14,039
sometimes, but I'm like, I made

1520
00:28:14,039 --> 00:28:15,259
this free script for you.

1521
00:28:15,259 --> 00:28:16,940
If you're down to record it, like,

1522
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:18,059
sure, I said,

1523
00:28:18,109 --> 00:28:19,660
I, but it's like, I'll do this.

1524
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:20,670
This is not for you.

1525
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:22,230
You know, let me know if you're up

1526
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:22,799
for it.

1527
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:23,180
Or if

1528
00:28:23,289 --> 00:28:23,970
you want to jump on a call.

1529
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:25,000
It's like, I'm focusing on them.

1530
00:28:25,059 --> 00:28:26,109
I'm not reaching out with like,

1531
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,750
hey, I can make a YouTube video

1532
00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:28,289
for you.

1533
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:29,140
I'm the best.

1534
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,819
I've been working with Daniel

1535
00:28:30,819 --> 00:28:31,400
Fazio for two

1536
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:33,599
years, which is a true fact.

1537
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,890
No, instead, I'm like, boom.

1538
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,470
You know what I mean?

1539
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:39,000
So that's roughly how

1540
00:28:39,089 --> 00:28:39,720
you should think about your

1541
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,049
outreach.

1542
00:28:40,059 --> 00:28:40,819
Now, in terms of the follow-up

1543
00:28:40,859 --> 00:28:41,730
strategy, the money is in the

1544
00:28:41,859 --> 00:28:42,369
follow-up.

1545
00:28:42,369 --> 00:28:43,740
So most deals don't close on the

1546
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:44,549
first message.

1547
00:28:44,549 --> 00:28:44,910
Okay.

1548
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:46,109
You need to bump people up.

1549
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:46,589
You need

1550
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,460
to send case studies.

1551
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:48,640
If you have them, you need to send

1552
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:48,930
GIFs.

1553
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:49,869
You need to send emojis.

1554
00:28:49,869 --> 00:28:50,380
You need to

1555
00:28:50,519 --> 00:28:51,750
send quick looms as well.

1556
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:53,390
So the follow-up cadence you want

1557
00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:55,140
to go with is like, okay, you send

1558
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:55,299
the

1559
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:56,130
first message.

1560
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:57,740
And then let's say August 1st.

1561
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:59,059
Then on August 3rd, you do

1562
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,000
follow-up one.

1563
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,819
August 6th,

1564
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:01,420
follow-up two.

1565
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:02,420
Let's take a three-day gap.

1566
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:03,460
And then like a four-day gap.

1567
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:04,430
Then like a five-day gap.

1568
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:05,940
Then like a 10-day gap.

1569
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:06,960
Then like 15.

1570
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:07,980
Then like 20.

1571
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,720
Then like once 30 days later.

1572
00:29:09,799 --> 00:29:10,640
And then quarterly

1573
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:11,119
forever.

1574
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:12,339
And you want to like constantly

1575
00:29:12,339 --> 00:29:13,680
reach out until somebody says yes

1576
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,420
or they say no.

1577
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:14,980
This is a

1578
00:29:15,099 --> 00:29:16,180
game of who can send the best

1579
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:17,460
quality outreach and who can

1580
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,039
follow up for the longest and post

1581
00:29:19,099 --> 00:29:19,349
the best

1582
00:29:19,559 --> 00:29:19,829
content.

1583
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:21,099
Basically, that's the whole goal

1584
00:29:21,099 --> 00:29:21,400
here.

1585
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,539
How you're scaling the agency is

1586
00:29:22,569 --> 00:29:23,490
posting content doing

1587
00:29:23,609 --> 00:29:23,980
outreach.

1588
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:25,190
But you want to follow up until

1589
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:26,309
they say yes or they say no.

1590
00:29:26,309 --> 00:29:27,750
You can just don't overthink it.

1591
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:28,640
Don't be cringy with your

1592
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,200
follow-ups.

1593
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,339
You can also send GIFs as well.

1594
00:29:30,339 --> 00:29:31,819
Like if you go to the GIF tab and

1595
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,369
you search up the word alone, you

1596
00:29:33,369 --> 00:29:34,839
can find GIFs of people just like

1597
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:36,210
being sad and like alone.

1598
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:36,519
You can

1599
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,150
send those.

1600
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:38,589
You can send a detective emoji.

1601
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:40,220
Shout out Christian for that one.

1602
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:41,259
I'll close some deals

1603
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:41,740
from that.

1604
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:43,269
So just never stop following up.

1605
00:29:43,269 --> 00:29:44,619
And you need to follow up on every

1606
00:29:44,619 --> 00:29:45,190
platform.

1607
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:45,819
Just the same

1608
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:47,180
follow-up across every platform.

1609
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:48,380
In terms of KPIs.

1610
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:50,410
So do five pieces of free work per

1611
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:50,940
day.

1612
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:52,000
And then anything you can do

1613
00:29:52,119 --> 00:29:52,900
extra, that's great.

1614
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,079
But make sure you're also posting

1615
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:54,849
content, right?

1616
00:29:54,849 --> 00:29:56,369
So leave some time for that.

1617
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:58,549
I closed my first client in 24

1618
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:01,019
days or 23 days for 6k paid in

1619
00:30:01,019 --> 00:30:02,839
full from this method.

1620
00:30:02,839 --> 00:30:04,440
So I'm not saying

1621
00:30:04,549 --> 00:30:05,920
it's going to take 23 days to work

1622
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,130
for you, but you need to give it

1623
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:08,700
at least three weeks of consistent

1624
00:30:08,809 --> 00:30:10,190
outreach and posting content.

1625
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:11,509
And it can take a bit longer.

1626
00:30:11,509 --> 00:30:12,559
It can take one month.

1627
00:30:12,579 --> 00:30:13,299
It can take two

1628
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:13,759
months.

1629
00:30:13,759 --> 00:30:15,269
It really just depends on you, how

1630
00:30:15,269 --> 00:30:16,829
well you're doing things, how good

1631
00:30:16,829 --> 00:30:17,670
is the leads you're

1632
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:19,539
selecting and different other

1633
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:20,500
variables.

1634
00:30:20,509 --> 00:30:22,299
Don't quit after like a week or

1635
00:30:22,299 --> 00:30:23,799
else you are just stupid.

1636
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,160
But yeah, that's pretty much it

1637
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:25,869
for this video.

1638
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,380
And if you have any questions, let

1639
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:27,819
me know.
