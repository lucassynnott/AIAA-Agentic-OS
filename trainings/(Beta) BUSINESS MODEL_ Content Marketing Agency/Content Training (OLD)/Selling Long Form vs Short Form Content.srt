1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,270
So in this video we'll talk about

2
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:02,450
long-form versus short-form

3
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:02,980
content.

4
00:00:03,109 --> 00:00:03,930
What should you sell?

5
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:05,980
So personally I prefer selling

6
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:07,919
long-form but I still sell both

7
00:00:08,028 --> 00:00:10,109
and that's what you guys should

8
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:10,359
do.

9
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:12,099
You should sell both but pick one

10
00:00:12,099 --> 00:00:13,070
as your primary.

11
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:14,449
The other one is just like an

12
00:00:14,449 --> 00:00:14,919
upsell

13
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,320
or just if people ask you for it

14
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:17,809
but you're not really actively

15
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:18,550
promoting it.

16
00:00:18,679 --> 00:00:19,460
But the truth is

17
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,070
both models can work really well

18
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:22,760
and it's personal preference.

19
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,329
I'll tell you what I think and all

20
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:25,640
that though.

21
00:00:25,649 --> 00:00:28,109
So basically for short-form a lot

22
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:30,239
of lower level people in the

23
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:32,118
market value short-form

24
00:00:32,298 --> 00:00:33,530
content and think that that's

25
00:00:33,539 --> 00:00:34,659
where the money is at.

26
00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:36,079
So you can kind of sign clients

27
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:36,780
like decently

28
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,109
quick on short-form offers because

29
00:00:39,109 --> 00:00:40,759
everyone everyone consumes

30
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,600
Instagram reels so people

31
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:43,979
understand the value of it

32
00:00:43,979 --> 00:00:44,689
inherently.

33
00:00:44,689 --> 00:00:46,119
But with YouTube sometimes you

34
00:00:46,119 --> 00:00:47,479
have to sell them on YouTube

35
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,740
and why it works etc.

36
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:50,350
But with reels everyone just

37
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:52,159
freaking spam consumes reels so

38
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:53,200
they already know

39
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,759
it's important so they're kind of

40
00:00:54,759 --> 00:00:55,549
easier to sell.

41
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:57,109
Honestly converting views from

42
00:00:57,109 --> 00:00:57,859
short-form into

43
00:00:58,039 --> 00:00:59,359
money is pretty difficult.

44
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:00,840
You also have to manage a lot of

45
00:01:00,969 --> 00:01:02,789
content like you're doing like 20,

46
00:01:03,109 --> 00:01:03,670
30, 60

47
00:01:03,859 --> 00:01:04,579
shorts a month.

48
00:01:04,579 --> 00:01:06,230
It's a lot of quality checking and

49
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:07,459
project management.

50
00:01:07,459 --> 00:01:09,069
So many spelling mistakes on the

51
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:10,730
captions and margins can get

52
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:12,519
pretty squeezed especially as a

53
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,500
beginner because people will try

54
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,200
and get you to

55
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:17,209
negotiate down to like 50, 60

56
00:01:17,209 --> 00:01:18,829
dollars per reel but your cost per

57
00:01:18,909 --> 00:01:20,939
reel is like 20 to 30 bucks.

58
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:21,659
So like

59
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:22,900
your margin is like a little bit

60
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:24,209
cooked compared to YouTube.

61
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:25,560
It's like much much better.

62
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,909
YouTube I find

63
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:28,260
it much easier to get a direct

64
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:28,530
ROI.

65
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:29,900
It's also just a lot easier to

66
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:31,260
pitch where it's like hey we're

67
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:31,480
making

68
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:33,000
these 10 to 15 minute videos.

69
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,230
They watch so much of your content

70
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:35,469
so much value they get they want

71
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:35,829
to book

72
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,170
in.

73
00:01:36,349 --> 00:01:37,709
With short-form you know someone's

74
00:01:37,709 --> 00:01:39,209
watching a 30 second video they

75
00:01:39,209 --> 00:01:40,480
barely even get the chance to

76
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:41,560
remember your name.

77
00:01:41,569 --> 00:01:43,159
But with a YouTube video it's like

78
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:44,760
they're consuming so much of your

79
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:46,079
content like you can

80
00:01:46,469 --> 00:01:47,680
freaking make bank off of them.

81
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,060
The fulfillment is infinitely

82
00:01:49,189 --> 00:01:50,379
easier because you're just

83
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:50,950
managing like

84
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:53,000
four videos a month instead of 30

85
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,689
to 60.

86
00:01:53,689 --> 00:01:55,030
Easier quality check because

87
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:56,939
there's less caption errors.

88
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:57,269
It's a

89
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:58,780
cleaner editing process.

90
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,510
There isn't editing every second

91
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:02,109
of the video and higher pricing

92
00:02:02,109 --> 00:02:02,819
power too.

93
00:02:02,819 --> 00:02:03,980
This is

94
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:04,900
debatable.

95
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,719
Technically you can like I've

96
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,889
closed people on 8k a month for 60

97
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,719
shorts a month editing only

98
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,659
right that's $136 per reel.

99
00:02:12,659 --> 00:02:14,159
My cost per reel is 20.

100
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:16,150
But the thing is I find it easier

101
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:17,240
to sell people on like

102
00:02:17,419 --> 00:02:18,349
YouTube for like higher price

103
00:02:18,349 --> 00:02:18,840
packages.

104
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,990
But I know people who are closing

105
00:02:20,069 --> 00:02:21,490
10k retainers on short-form so

106
00:02:21,539 --> 00:02:22,879
this one is like debatable

107
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:23,650
basically.

108
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:25,289
I would say YouTube is like a bit

109
00:02:25,289 --> 00:02:27,080
harder to sell at first if you

110
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:27,219
don't

111
00:02:27,259 --> 00:02:28,539
have any like proof or case

112
00:02:28,539 --> 00:02:29,150
studies.

113
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,659
And you have to put more effort

114
00:02:30,659 --> 00:02:32,340
into like the strategy scripting

115
00:02:32,729 --> 00:02:32,939
packaging.

116
00:02:33,009 --> 00:02:34,349
Like with short-form you can kind

117
00:02:34,349 --> 00:02:35,500
of just like throw up a ton of

118
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,699
reels and like see what works.

119
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,270
So you have a lot more bullets to

120
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:39,000
shoot with.

121
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,680
But YouTube you got four videos

122
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,360
you know you gotta like

123
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,509
make sure those cook.

124
00:02:42,509 --> 00:02:43,909
But as long as you're doing free

125
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,349
work up front and you're posting

126
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:46,229
content online

127
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,439
you can still sell on the YouTube

128
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:49,020
offer.

129
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:50,819
But yeah it's long form is just

130
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,349
simple.

131
00:02:51,729 --> 00:02:52,699
That's why I picked it.

132
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,110
The margins are better.

133
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,930
Like our cost per video varies but

134
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:57,569
like our margin right now is like

135
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,520
65%

136
00:02:58,819 --> 00:03:00,000
across 100k a month.

137
00:03:00,009 --> 00:03:01,550
And that's before taxes but after

138
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:02,569
everything else.

139
00:03:02,569 --> 00:03:04,020
Well I'm in Dubai now so I don't

140
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,430
have to worry about that.

141
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:07,000
But I also personally just get

142
00:03:07,129 --> 00:03:08,699
better results on YouTube for my

143
00:03:08,699 --> 00:03:09,370
clients.

144
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:09,479
So

145
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,680
that's why I like it more.

146
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,229
I like getting my clients results.

147
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:13,469
And I actually enjoy the creative

148
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:14,300
process

149
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:15,150
with YouTube more.

150
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:16,210
And I'm sure with a lot of you

151
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:17,490
guys watching this you probably

152
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:18,280
want to be YouTube

153
00:03:18,689 --> 00:03:20,159
YouTube big YouTube channels

154
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,280
owners or sorry content creators I

155
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:24,020
guess when you're a kid.

156
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:25,479
So it's kind of

157
00:03:25,669 --> 00:03:27,740
like cool like doing it basically.

158
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,490
But I still sell short form.

159
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:31,389
Like last month we hit like a 10k

160
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:31,759
paid in

161
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,310
full for some reels for three

162
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:33,889
months.

163
00:03:33,889 --> 00:03:34,930
So still sell it.

164
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:36,259
Like take the money.

165
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,419
But you need to pick one

166
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:39,879
thing to focus on basically.

167
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:41,169
So if you want me to like just

168
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:42,590
tell you what to do I prefer the

169
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:43,099
YouTube

170
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:43,439
offer.

171
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:44,240
That's what I think.

172
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,310
And then you can still sell the

173
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:46,439
short form on the back end.

174
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:47,259
So that's pretty

175
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,169
much it for this video.

176
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,580
And I'll see you in the next one.
