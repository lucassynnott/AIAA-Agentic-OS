1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,100
All right, so in this video, I'm

2
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:02,049
going to walk through the service

3
00:00:02,049 --> 00:00:02,960
delivery workflow.

4
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,799
It all starts from the contract

5
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:06,400
and the payment, and then it's

6
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,039
going to go down to what gets

7
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,830
triggered, the onboarding funnel,

8
00:00:09,859 --> 00:00:11,310
the onboarding call, what gets

9
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,279
done on that call, the first

10
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,619
video cycle, like, okay, we've got

11
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:15,970
the ideas approved, now we're

12
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:16,899
going to do the script,

13
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:17,719
and then you've got to edit.

14
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:19,239
You're going to see that whole

15
00:00:19,239 --> 00:00:20,870
flow and how it repeats itself.

16
00:00:21,059 --> 00:00:22,320
So I'm going to cut into a

17
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,219
pre-recorded video showing exactly

18
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:24,920
this.

19
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:25,800
I'm about to walk through

20
00:00:25,989 --> 00:00:27,000
exactly how you should be

21
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,719
onboarding your new content agency

22
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:30,059
clients step-by-step.

23
00:00:30,059 --> 00:00:30,469
I've used

24
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:32,030
this for over 100 clients, so let

25
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:33,109
me break it down right now.

26
00:00:33,109 --> 00:00:34,740
So first things first, once they

27
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:35,060
sign

28
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,369
the contract, this is what

29
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:37,740
triggers the onboarding.

30
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:39,320
I use Pandadoc as the software for

31
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,200
our contract,

32
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,469
and if you're using Stripe as a

33
00:00:41,469 --> 00:00:42,899
payment processor, you can even

34
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:44,109
connect your Stripe to your

35
00:00:44,119 --> 00:00:44,780
Pandadoc,

36
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:45,759
so as soon as they sign the

37
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:47,170
contract, then they pay the Stripe

38
00:00:47,189 --> 00:00:48,109
right then and there.

39
00:00:48,219 --> 00:00:48,640
It's much

40
00:00:48,829 --> 00:00:49,979
better if you can do that, and

41
00:00:50,119 --> 00:00:51,579
then that triggers the onboarding

42
00:00:51,579 --> 00:00:52,390
within Zapier.

43
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:53,310
So you do have to do

44
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:54,659
the Slack channel invite manually.

45
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:55,710
Once they sign and pay, it

46
00:00:55,729 --> 00:00:56,859
triggers the automation.

47
00:00:56,859 --> 00:00:57,500
So the Slack

48
00:00:57,689 --> 00:00:58,840
channel gets created, the Google

49
00:00:58,979 --> 00:01:00,119
Drive folders get created, the

50
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:01,469
Frame.io folders get created,

51
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,859
a welcome email gets sent, and

52
00:01:02,859 --> 00:01:04,109
then you just manually have to

53
00:01:04,109 --> 00:01:05,319
send a Slack connect invite

54
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:06,609
because unfortunately you can't

55
00:01:06,609 --> 00:01:07,890
automatically do it, or at least

56
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:09,099
there's no easy way to do so.

57
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:10,989
And then what the welcome email is

58
00:01:10,989 --> 00:01:12,799
going to include is a link to this

59
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,590
onboarding funnel that I'm about

60
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,579
to show you right now.

61
00:01:15,579 --> 00:01:16,950
So basically the first step of the

62
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:18,280
funnel, this is done within Go

63
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:18,569
High Level,

64
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:19,909
it says welcome onboard.

65
00:01:19,909 --> 00:01:21,150
So this is a simple five minute

66
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:23,129
welcome video that kind of resets

67
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:24,719
expectations again, talks about

68
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:26,129
why YouTube is so amazing, and

69
00:01:26,129 --> 00:01:27,680
also just walks through the next

70
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:27,920
step

71
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:29,209
and the timeline that they should

72
00:01:29,209 --> 00:01:29,859
be expecting.

73
00:01:29,859 --> 00:01:30,950
And then the next step is that

74
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:31,620
they fill out an

75
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:32,400
onboarding form.

76
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:33,790
And I also make sure to include a

77
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:35,219
video that talks about how to fill

78
00:01:35,219 --> 00:01:35,980
out the onboarding

79
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,569
form properly, because if they

80
00:01:37,569 --> 00:01:38,989
don't do so, it's going to make

81
00:01:38,989 --> 00:01:40,049
our job a lot harder.

82
00:01:40,219 --> 00:01:40,750
After they fill

83
00:01:40,819 --> 00:01:41,909
up the onboarding form, they can

84
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:43,010
schedule their onboarding call

85
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:43,480
right here.

86
00:01:43,609 --> 00:01:44,659
And then after they schedule the

87
00:01:44,849 --> 00:01:46,000
onboarding call, I tell them, make

88
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,349
sure to check your email for the

89
00:01:47,349 --> 00:01:48,379
Slack invitation.

90
00:01:48,379 --> 00:01:49,260
And then this

91
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:50,239
step, I'm basically just telling

92
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:51,230
them what's going to happen next.

93
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:52,319
First things first, they have to

94
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:53,659
grant us access to their YouTube

95
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:54,170
channel.

96
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:55,390
And then next up, I show them how

97
00:01:55,459 --> 00:01:56,219
to set up OBS.

98
00:01:56,219 --> 00:01:56,739
So this is

99
00:01:56,859 --> 00:01:58,159
the screen recording software that

100
00:01:58,299 --> 00:01:59,150
most of our clients use.

101
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:00,439
And then next, I show them how to

102
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:00,980
take high

103
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:02,310
quality thumbnail pictures,

104
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,530
because we need HD thumbnail

105
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:05,159
pictures to make good thumbnails.

106
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:06,239
And then next up,

107
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,379
I show them how to upload into

108
00:02:07,379 --> 00:02:08,030
Google Drive.

109
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:09,310
And then next, I show them how to

110
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:10,819
approve or disapprove videos

111
00:02:11,008 --> 00:02:11,710
within frame.io.

112
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:13,020
And then finally, I just have one

113
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,090
last video here that just tells

114
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:14,789
them what they

115
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:16,199
should expect next and thanking

116
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,360
them for trusting us.

117
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,830
So once all of this gets done, we

118
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,740
can start our

119
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,900
side of the work, which is

120
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,349
prepping the first 12 YouTube

121
00:02:22,349 --> 00:02:22,870
video ideas.

122
00:02:22,979 --> 00:02:24,020
After that, we have our

123
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:24,800
onboarding call.

124
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,069
And what happens on the onboarding

125
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:27,250
call is we basically just present

126
00:02:27,539 --> 00:02:28,439
these 12 content

127
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,639
ideas, get the green light on

128
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:29,969
them.

129
00:02:29,969 --> 00:02:31,050
And then if we need any other

130
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:32,430
information, like maybe their

131
00:02:32,629 --> 00:02:33,780
onboarding form is lacking a bit,

132
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:34,909
and we need more info, this is

133
00:02:34,909 --> 00:02:36,020
where I would ask them a couple

134
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:36,219
more

135
00:02:36,409 --> 00:02:37,189
questions to get to know them

136
00:02:37,189 --> 00:02:37,560
better.

137
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,520
And then I also just make sure

138
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,800
they understand everything in

139
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,189
terms of the

140
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:41,580
timeline, what to expect guys

141
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:43,310
setting expectations is extremely

142
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:44,080
important.

143
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:44,840
And then that's pretty much

144
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:45,120
it.

145
00:02:45,229 --> 00:02:46,430
So after the onboarding call,

146
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:47,780
that's where we start scripting

147
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:49,240
the first two videos, and we send

148
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,490
them to the client, and then they

149
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:50,889
record.

150
00:02:50,889 --> 00:02:52,099
And then at this point, like the

151
00:02:52,099 --> 00:02:53,500
onboarding is technically done,

152
00:02:53,539 --> 00:02:54,740
like after the onboarding call,

153
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:55,930
but I'm going to keep walking you

154
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:57,180
guys through this up until the

155
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:57,409
point

156
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:58,909
that the first video goes live.

157
00:02:58,909 --> 00:03:00,370
So once they record, they send us

158
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:00,960
the video.

159
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,020
And then after that,

160
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,030
we do the editing and the

161
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:04,430
thumbnail, and then we send them

162
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:05,780
the video via frame.io.

163
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:06,379
So there they can

164
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,780
leave their revisions, approve or

165
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:08,689
disapprove the video.

166
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:10,060
And then we schedule the video for

167
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:10,219
them.

168
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,439
And then the cycle just repeats

169
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:11,909
forever.

170
00:03:11,909 --> 00:03:12,919
So we constantly give them

171
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:14,039
performance updates along

172
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,349
the way through Slack and updates

173
00:03:15,349 --> 00:03:16,090
on the strategy.

174
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:17,330
So that's the entire onboarding

175
00:03:17,539 --> 00:03:17,620
flow.

176
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:18,009
Very, very

177
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:18,430
simple.

178
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:19,169
Of course, there's like

179
00:03:19,169 --> 00:03:20,199
automations on the backend, like,

180
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:21,319
you know, the Google drive folders

181
00:03:21,539 --> 00:03:22,439
I was showing you guys and a

182
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:23,580
couple other things, but that's

183
00:03:23,689 --> 00:03:24,699
what it looks like from the client

184
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:25,099
side.

185
00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:26,199
And a little bit about what it

186
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:27,479
looks like internally as well.

187
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:29,069
As soon as the onboarding form is

188
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:29,460
done,

189
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,800
it zaps our copywriter and our

190
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,159
strategist right away to start

191
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,080
mapping out those first 12 video

192
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:34,580
ideas.

193
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:35,550
But other than that, I've pretty

194
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:36,539
much showed you everything.

195
00:03:36,539 --> 00:03:37,650
Once you take clients through

196
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:38,039
this,

197
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,139
it just blows them away because

198
00:03:39,139 --> 00:03:40,319
they're going to be like, wow,

199
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:41,330
this guy has such an in-depth

200
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:41,949
onboarding.

201
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,020
I've never seen this before.

202
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:44,340
And they're just very, very happy.

203
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,259
Usually right when people

204
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,599
pay you, they're still a bit

205
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:47,219
hesitant.

206
00:03:47,219 --> 00:03:48,550
So just having such a clean and

207
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,360
nice onboarding helps out a lot

208
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,180
with LTV and trust.

209
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,219
So now that you've got some

210
00:03:52,219 --> 00:03:53,560
clients onboarded, if you want to

211
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,199
know how to get

212
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,370
them results, just watch some of

213
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:56,520
the other videos on my channel.

214
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,780
Or if you need help getting more

215
00:03:57,969 --> 00:03:58,889
clients and actually putting more

216
00:03:58,889 --> 00:04:00,090
people through this onboarding, I

217
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:01,259
have videos for that as well.

218
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,250
And if you want to work with me

219
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,189
one-to-one to scale up your

220
00:04:03,189 --> 00:04:04,530
content agency, just hit the first

221
00:04:04,659 --> 00:04:05,629
link in the description, but

222
00:04:05,629 --> 00:04:05,960
that's it.

223
00:04:06,099 --> 00:04:07,020
I'll see you in the next one.
