00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:01,850
Welcome everybody to the content

2
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:03,000
agency crash course

3
00:00:03,089 --> 00:00:04,559
as part of Client Ascension.

4
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:05,719
So basically, just to give you a

5
00:00:05,719 --> 00:00:06,860
rundown, who am I?

6
00:00:06,919 --> 00:00:08,740
I started my content agency at 17

7
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:09,230
years old

8
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:10,900
on November 25th, 2022.

9
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,789
And 24 months later, we hit

10
00:00:12,789 --> 00:00:14,980
$132,000 a month.

11
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:16,839
15 months after launching, we hit

12
00:00:16,839 --> 00:00:17,980
93.5K a month.

13
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:19,670
And 82 days after launching, we

14
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:20,699
hit 15K a month.

15
00:00:20,809 --> 00:00:22,129
And I'm gonna walk through exactly

16
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,469
how I did all of that.

17
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:25,010
And I joined Client Ascension on

18
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:26,820
December 26th, 2022.

19
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:28,300
And I'm still in there today,

20
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:29,289
coming up on three years at the

21
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:30,030
end of this year.

22
00:00:30,129 --> 00:00:32,100
So great guys, great program.

23
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:33,490
Glad to have you guys on board.

24
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:34,549
But now I'm gonna talk about

25
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,359
the specific content agency sauce.

26
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:37,299
Because the thing with running an

27
00:00:37,299 --> 00:00:37,539
agency

28
00:00:37,609 --> 00:00:38,899
and content agencies, trust me,

29
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:40,119
I coach like 100 plus content

30
00:00:40,119 --> 00:00:40,859
agencies myself.

31
00:00:40,929 --> 00:00:42,340
It's a very specific model.

32
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:43,420
Okay, there's like little

33
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:43,979
intricacies

34
00:00:44,049 --> 00:00:44,880
and stuff you need to learn,

35
00:00:44,939 --> 00:00:46,219
which I'm gonna cover inside of

36
00:00:46,219 --> 00:00:46,920
this course.

37
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:48,399
And yeah, I'm super excited to

38
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:49,649
help you guys scale up.

39
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:51,560
And yeah, I'm 20 years old now.

40
00:00:51,619 --> 00:00:53,289
This freaking business model

41
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:54,630
granted me a life

42
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:55,840
I'm very, very grateful for.

43
00:00:55,899 --> 00:00:57,570
And I'm super excited to share

44
00:00:57,659 --> 00:00:57,880
that

45
00:00:57,950 --> 00:00:59,310
and all the sauce with you guys

46
00:00:59,310 --> 00:00:59,820
today.

47
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:01,039
So without further ado, this is

48
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:01,530
the outline

49
00:01:01,609 --> 00:01:02,659
and we're gonna jump right into

50
00:01:02,659 --> 00:01:02,899
it.
