1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,120
All right guys, so let's talk

2
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:02,419
about what makes a good YouTube

3
00:00:02,419 --> 00:00:02,940
video.

4
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:04,160
So not all videos are created

5
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:04,620
equal.

6
00:00:04,639 --> 00:00:06,070
Some get views, but no clients.

7
00:00:06,099 --> 00:00:07,559
Others bring in qualified leads

8
00:00:07,559 --> 00:00:09,310
that close at 30 to 50% on sales

9
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:09,830
calls.

10
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:12,380
One of my clients booked 250 sales

11
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:14,650
calls in the first 14 days of the

12
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:15,320
month.

13
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,320
So it's safe to say I know what

14
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,089
I'm talking about.

15
00:00:17,089 --> 00:00:18,190
And in this video, I'm going to

16
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:19,179
run through all of it.

17
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:20,510
So first things first is the

18
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:21,010
script.

19
00:00:21,089 --> 00:00:22,440
You need to make sure you have a

20
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,460
good video script.

21
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,039
I know I skipped over the ideation

22
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:26,559
part, but I'll get into that in a

23
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:27,059
sec.

24
00:00:27,059 --> 00:00:28,510
But the script is very important,

25
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:28,910
right?

26
00:00:29,019 --> 00:00:29,859
So there's three parts to a

27
00:00:29,859 --> 00:00:31,039
script, hook, body, outro.

28
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:32,789
The hook, typically we script

29
00:00:32,789 --> 00:00:34,759
these word for word for clients,

30
00:00:34,759 --> 00:00:35,780
but you want to try to relate to

31
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:36,359
the viewer.

32
00:00:36,409 --> 00:00:38,060
So when I started my agency, I had

33
00:00:38,109 --> 00:00:40,159
no social proof, blah, blah, blah,

34
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:41,670
but I still managed to sign my

35
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:43,630
first client in 21 days for 6K up

36
00:00:43,689 --> 00:00:44,359
front.

37
00:00:44,469 --> 00:00:45,750
The person's going to relate to

38
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,109
the fact that I was a beginner, I

39
00:00:47,109 --> 00:00:48,520
had no social proof, and they're

40
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:49,899
going to want the end result that

41
00:00:49,899 --> 00:00:50,679
I just said.

42
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,079
I signed a client for 6K up front

43
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:52,829
in 23 days.

44
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:54,130
So then they're going to want to

45
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:54,530
tune in.

46
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:55,659
But now they're going to want to

47
00:00:55,659 --> 00:00:56,799
know what they're tuning into.

48
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:57,929
So then I'm going to say, so in

49
00:00:57,929 --> 00:00:59,060
this video, I'm going to walk

50
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,310
through exactly how you can sign

51
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,820
your first client by sending free

52
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:04,000
work up front in no less than four

53
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,939
weeks or no more than four weeks.

54
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:08,390
You want to show credibility and

55
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:09,079
social proof.

56
00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:10,239
So as you can see from that hook

57
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,469
that I just came up with using my

58
00:01:11,469 --> 00:01:12,590
brain on the fly that I didn't

59
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:13,739
script beforehand.

60
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:14,939
When you've been doing this for a

61
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:16,239
while, you're kind of just like,

62
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:17,590
you're kind of just automatic.

63
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,700
What was I going to say though?

64
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,109
Now I'm losing my train of

65
00:01:21,109 --> 00:01:21,859
thought.

66
00:01:21,909 --> 00:01:23,549
But yeah, the social proof, like I

67
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:25,069
said it there, subliminally or

68
00:01:25,069 --> 00:01:26,519
like just nice and smooth.

69
00:01:26,569 --> 00:01:27,629
That was like, oh yeah, I got my

70
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:28,810
first client for 6K up front.

71
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,799
Tease what they'll learn.

72
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,079
So like, hey, you'll learn this

73
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:33,629
outreach mechanism or whatever.

74
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,599
Keep it short.

75
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:36,230
Trim all the fluff, especially for

76
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,439
B2B clients, guys.

77
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,140
Like you really don't want to make

78
00:01:39,189 --> 00:01:41,030
long, long, long hooks for a B2C

79
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:41,680
client.

80
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:42,540
They can be a bit longer.

81
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:43,760
You can do a bit more like mental

82
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,260
gymnastics with the viewer because

83
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:46,870
they're a bit more brain dead

84
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:48,219
goldfish memory.

85
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:49,829
But yeah, for the body guys, you

86
00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:50,849
don't want to script word for

87
00:01:50,849 --> 00:01:51,219
word.

88
00:01:51,269 --> 00:01:52,480
The main thing with the bodies is

89
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,379
like just no fluff.

90
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:54,579
As long as it's no fluff and it's

91
00:01:54,579 --> 00:01:55,920
super, super, super valuable,

92
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:56,799
that's awesome.

93
00:01:56,849 --> 00:01:58,340
And that is a good YouTube video.

94
00:01:58,390 --> 00:01:59,890
On top of that, if you have like

95
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:01,400
nice transitionary sentences

96
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,200
between points, that's great.

97
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:05,189
I also typically like splitting up

98
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,049
our bodies into like three main

99
00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:09,210
sections or five just because like

100
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:10,979
the human brain likes sections and

101
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:11,629
chapters.

102
00:02:11,729 --> 00:02:13,090
It just helps things easier to

103
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:13,639
digest.

104
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,629
Like, for example, if you look at

105
00:02:15,689 --> 00:02:17,150
a phone number, it's like

106
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:19,650
604-604-6004.

107
00:02:19,699 --> 00:02:20,620
It's like in three parts.

108
00:02:20,789 --> 00:02:22,699
It's like easier to remember than

109
00:02:22,699 --> 00:02:26,219
if it was just like 604-604-6004.

110
00:02:26,259 --> 00:02:27,669
It's like, no, when it's broken up

111
00:02:27,669 --> 00:02:29,009
into three parts, it's easier to

112
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,509
consume and easier to remember,

113
00:02:30,509 --> 00:02:31,849
which is what you want with your

114
00:02:31,909 --> 00:02:32,419
content.

115
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:35,090
So yeah, good analogy for you

116
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:35,860
guys.

117
00:02:35,909 --> 00:02:37,060
Make sure you're adding like

118
00:02:37,069 --> 00:02:38,639
stories as well, pre-answering any

119
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:39,409
objections.

120
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:41,210
And just overall, the whole time

121
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:42,879
you're creating a YouTube video,

122
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,479
whether it's for yourself or for a

123
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:45,849
client, you need to just put

124
00:02:45,849 --> 00:02:47,129
yourself in the shoes of the

125
00:02:47,219 --> 00:02:47,960
viewer.

126
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:51,599
Ask yourself, what do they want to

127
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:52,400
see?

128
00:02:52,449 --> 00:02:53,629
So if I make a YouTube video

129
00:02:53,629 --> 00:02:54,990
called how to script a YouTube

130
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:56,620
video, I can imagine somebody is

131
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:58,139
going to want to see an example of

132
00:02:58,139 --> 00:02:58,860
a script.

133
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:00,560
Somebody is going to want to know

134
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,500
what's the sections of the video,

135
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,699
so on and so forth.

136
00:03:03,849 --> 00:03:05,129
So just put yourself in the

137
00:03:05,129 --> 00:03:06,699
viewer's shoes and make sure to

138
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:07,419
deliver.

139
00:03:07,469 --> 00:03:08,789
And then for the outro, you're

140
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,360
going to transition smoothly into

141
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,580
it and then just do a clear,

142
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:12,360
simple CTA.

143
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,699
So I just want to show you guys an

144
00:03:13,699 --> 00:03:14,259
example.

145
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:17,680
So this is one of our clients.

146
00:03:17,729 --> 00:03:18,780
Don't try and steal him.

147
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:20,539
So title, how I use LinkedIn DMs

148
00:03:20,569 --> 00:03:22,389
to book four plus sales calls per

149
00:03:22,389 --> 00:03:22,879
day.

150
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:24,680
We like to add a little thing at

151
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,159
the top that just says like what

152
00:03:26,169 --> 00:03:27,729
the length of this video is.

153
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,729
Also, I know in the program there

154
00:03:29,789 --> 00:03:31,520
are going to be, I think Lucas

155
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,460
made some like AI script writing

156
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:35,270
tools and stuff like that.

157
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,250
So your scripts might look

158
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,520
slightly different, but roughly

159
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,520
it'll be like the same.

160
00:03:38,569 --> 00:03:40,020
So the hook is up here.

161
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:41,340
I'll let you like pause and read.

162
00:03:41,389 --> 00:03:42,599
And then the body, this is how we

163
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:43,330
structure it.

164
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:44,879
We do a mid-body CTA as well.

165
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:46,259
But overall, it's just bullet

166
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:47,580
points and we let the clients slip

167
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:48,719
in their own knowledge.

168
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:50,270
Whenever we're selling clients on

169
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:51,759
this, we tell them, hey, if I did

170
00:03:51,819 --> 00:03:53,520
word for word, you'd be a puppet.

171
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,479
It wouldn't be a personal brand

172
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:55,780
and the video wouldn't perform.

173
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:57,389
So this is in your best interest

174
00:03:57,389 --> 00:03:59,219
and they're always down for it.

175
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:01,509
Yeah, just think of the video like

176
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:02,479
a funnel.

177
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:03,729
You're hooking them in, delivering

178
00:04:03,729 --> 00:04:04,770
value, then guide them to the next

179
00:04:04,909 --> 00:04:05,259
step.

180
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:07,550
In terms of your delivery style,

181
00:04:07,689 --> 00:04:09,699
don't read robotically.

182
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:11,099
In fact, it's better if you don't

183
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:12,349
read at all and you like kind of

184
00:04:12,349 --> 00:04:13,919
memorize the script a little bit.

185
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:14,960
Obviously, guys, this same

186
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,290
feedback applies to your clients.

187
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:17,899
Make sure you use bullet points

188
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:19,620
and don't script word for word.

189
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:20,779
It's just if you script word for

190
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:22,029
word, naturally, you'll end up

191
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:22,600
reading.

192
00:04:22,649 --> 00:04:24,079
Mistakes are fine.

193
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,310
Editors can cut out pauses and

194
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:25,779
errors.

195
00:04:25,829 --> 00:04:28,779
And energy is more important than

196
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:30,220
perfection.

197
00:04:30,269 --> 00:04:32,509
So like one thing to keep in mind

198
00:04:32,649 --> 00:04:34,939
is the whole purpose of YouTube

199
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:35,959
and how YouTube works as a

200
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:36,160
platform

201
00:04:36,269 --> 00:04:37,480
and what makes a YouTube video

202
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,819
good is like how good is the value

203
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:39,680
you're providing?

204
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:41,660
And also, are you boring or not?

205
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:43,480
And I don't mean you need to crack

206
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,350
jokes 24-7.

207
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:45,699
But what I mean is you don't want

208
00:04:45,709 --> 00:04:47,279
to be like, hey, my name is Eamon.

209
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:48,430
I'm going to show you how to land

210
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:49,160
three clients.

211
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,089
So the first thing you want to do

212
00:04:52,089 --> 00:04:53,160
is this.

213
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:54,310
And then you're going to do this

214
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:54,740
button.

215
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:55,699
And then you're going to send this

216
00:04:55,819 --> 00:04:56,139
script.

217
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:58,310
It's so boring, ums and ahs, no

218
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:59,279
pauses cut out.

219
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:00,139
Like you're going to want to click

220
00:05:00,139 --> 00:05:00,259
off.

221
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:02,079
So you need to make sure it's like

222
00:05:02,139 --> 00:05:03,889
watchable and the value needs to

223
00:05:03,889 --> 00:05:04,889
be really good.

224
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:06,220
That's our strategy.

225
00:05:06,269 --> 00:05:07,689
Please do not create videos for

226
00:05:07,689 --> 00:05:09,279
yourselves or your clients with no

227
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:09,819
value.

228
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:11,069
And what I mean by that is like

229
00:05:11,069 --> 00:05:12,649
there's certain creators where you

230
00:05:12,649 --> 00:05:14,110
click into their YouTube video

231
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:15,149
and they're just seriously

232
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:16,189
gatekeeping everything.

233
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:17,850
And it's actually the worst

234
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:19,879
experience ever from like a client

235
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:21,800
or potential client perspective

236
00:05:21,899 --> 00:05:22,819
because they want to be like,

237
00:05:22,939 --> 00:05:24,050
okay, let me see if this guy knows

238
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:24,579
his stuff.

239
00:05:24,629 --> 00:05:25,769
And then they watch the video and

240
00:05:25,769 --> 00:05:27,050
they just wasted 20 minutes of

241
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:27,629
their life.

242
00:05:27,689 --> 00:05:28,800
They're never going to pay you 8k

243
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,540
for your program.

244
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:30,209
You know what I mean?

245
00:05:30,259 --> 00:05:31,620
So just make sure you're pushing

246
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:32,980
value and not gatekeeping.

247
00:05:33,029 --> 00:05:33,939
You can gatekeep little bits and

248
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:34,480
things.

249
00:05:34,519 --> 00:05:35,819
So for example, my YouTube videos,

250
00:05:35,819 --> 00:05:37,199
I don't talk about my outreach

251
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:37,740
script.

252
00:05:38,019 --> 00:05:39,519
I don't show my air table or my

253
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:40,269
automation.

254
00:05:40,459 --> 00:05:41,379
It's like there's just like little

255
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,399
things that you can gatekeep.

256
00:05:42,449 --> 00:05:43,709
But for the most part, you want to

257
00:05:43,709 --> 00:05:44,680
be kind of an open book.

258
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,639
Because at the end of the day,

259
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:46,829
people will pay you for your high

260
00:05:46,829 --> 00:05:47,740
ticket programs and stuff

261
00:05:47,819 --> 00:05:49,709
like that and services for you to

262
00:05:49,709 --> 00:05:51,120
if it's done for you.

263
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,240
It's like the best selling

264
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,589
proposition of all time because

265
00:05:53,589 --> 00:05:54,779
like, hey, it's literally done

266
00:05:54,829 --> 00:05:56,149
for you for coaching.

267
00:05:56,209 --> 00:05:57,339
You know, they'll want to just be

268
00:05:57,339 --> 00:05:58,449
able to speak to you and stuff in

269
00:05:58,449 --> 00:05:59,300
terms of editing.

270
00:05:59,339 --> 00:06:00,600
I know I'm going to get asked, oh,

271
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,889
yeah, you know, can we just do raw

272
00:06:01,889 --> 00:06:02,689
videos or something?

273
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,170
But the reality is, if you look at

274
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:05,759
practically every YouTube channel

275
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,959
ever that's scaled up

276
00:06:07,009 --> 00:06:08,230
within the last decade or two

277
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:09,800
decades, if YouTube's been around

278
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,759
that long, like they

279
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:12,290
all scaled up through like edited

280
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:13,990
videos, basically, especially if

281
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:14,839
we look at like the

282
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:16,540
last decade, it's been edited

283
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,129
videos.

284
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:18,649
Sure, there's like the minority of

285
00:06:18,649 --> 00:06:19,839
like more unedited stuff.

286
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:21,649
But like if you look at the 70,

287
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:24,100
80, 90 percent, it's edited.

288
00:06:24,139 --> 00:06:25,300
So just edit your videos.

289
00:06:25,339 --> 00:06:26,550
There's a difference between

290
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:28,000
editing a video nicely and editing

291
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,100
a video and doing like this

292
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,389
crazy ADHD editing crap.

293
00:06:31,449 --> 00:06:33,629
So don't get caught up in the mix

294
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:36,240
of this whole raw content trend.

295
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:37,569
In terms of your thumbnails

296
00:06:37,569 --> 00:06:39,060
overall, you want to make sure

297
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:41,079
that they have let's go here.

298
00:06:41,129 --> 00:06:42,389
You want to make sure that they

299
00:06:42,389 --> 00:06:43,870
have about like four words or less

300
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,360
in the thumbnail, ideally,

301
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:46,709
and like use like bright

302
00:06:46,709 --> 00:06:48,829
thumbnails, like white background

303
00:06:48,829 --> 00:06:50,819
like this, like this would perform

304
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:51,889
better if the whole thing was in

305
00:06:51,899 --> 00:06:52,519
like dark mode.

306
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:54,180
And the reason why is most people

307
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,759
like myself are in dark mode.

308
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:57,910
So if you have a white thumbnail,

309
00:06:57,910 --> 00:06:59,829
it sticks out more and then try

310
00:06:59,829 --> 00:07:01,639
and use things that people

311
00:07:02,069 --> 00:07:02,199
understand.

312
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:03,670
So for like my content agency

313
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:05,149
program, I know people will

314
00:07:05,149 --> 00:07:06,339
recognize Zapier.

315
00:07:06,379 --> 00:07:07,459
I know they're going to recognize

316
00:07:07,459 --> 00:07:07,860
Stripe.

317
00:07:07,899 --> 00:07:09,790
But let's say if my client was

318
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:12,040
selling to like how to create like

319
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:13,759
a how to do like Facebook

320
00:07:14,129 --> 00:07:15,089
flipping business or something,

321
00:07:15,089 --> 00:07:16,300
you know, I'd probably put like

322
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,360
cash app here because they're

323
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:18,319
not going to know what Stripe is.

324
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:19,800
So make sure you're actually like

325
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,050
keeping the viewer in mind and

326
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:22,100
putting things they're

327
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:22,579
familiar with.

328
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,040
So here I'm putting a YouTube logo

329
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,089
to try and catch people's

330
00:07:25,089 --> 00:07:26,279
attention with that as

331
00:07:26,329 --> 00:07:26,500
well.

332
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:27,970
Bright, big text, make it easily

333
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:28,579
readable.

334
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,529
You need to keep in mind that with

335
00:07:30,529 --> 00:07:33,000
thumbnails, people are like 97% of

336
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,339
traffic is going to be

337
00:07:34,389 --> 00:07:36,129
on mobile and mobile screens are

338
00:07:36,209 --> 00:07:36,629
small.

339
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,250
So make sure that your text is

340
00:07:38,259 --> 00:07:39,759
actually legible on a small

341
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,449
screen.

342
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,470
And always just put your face on

343
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:46,040
there because people over time,

344
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,620
you'll build like brand equity

345
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:49,790
and people recognize your face and

346
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:50,519
click your stuff.

347
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,220
But also it's just it's just

348
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:53,519
better that way.

349
00:07:53,589 --> 00:07:54,240
So just do it.

350
00:07:54,389 --> 00:07:55,430
And that's that's pretty much it

351
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:56,129
for the most part.

352
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:57,290
The best way to learn how to make

353
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:58,360
good thumbnails is just go and

354
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,579
look at other YouTube channels

355
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,560
and just see what they're actually

356
00:08:01,629 --> 00:08:03,290
doing and what is working and

357
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:04,639
what's not working.

358
00:08:04,699 --> 00:08:05,810
I know some of you guys may be

359
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:07,259
wondering, wow, Ayman only gets

360
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,819
this many views, but you don't

361
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:10,180
actually need that much money to

362
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,360
get views and make money from

363
00:08:11,389 --> 00:08:11,959
YouTube.

364
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,850
Like we have clients with like 300

365
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:15,139
views per video and they're

366
00:08:15,139 --> 00:08:16,670
signing clients for 5k a pop.

367
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,680
So don't think you need a million

368
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,180
views to get money.

369
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:21,660
Now, in terms of content types

370
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,480
that works, I mean, sorry, content

371
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,470
types that work.

372
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,740
There's two types talking head

373
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,220
videos and screen share videos.

374
00:08:27,269 --> 00:08:27,839
Both are good.

375
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,769
Screen shares are pretty great for

376
00:08:29,769 --> 00:08:31,470
B2B talking head is a bit more

377
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:33,679
B2C, but like you're still

378
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:34,639
going to want to do both, whether

379
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:35,860
you are B2B or B2C, just if you're

380
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:36,820
B2B, you'll probably

381
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:37,519
have more screen shares.

382
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:38,490
And if you're B2C, you'll have

383
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:39,179
more talking heads.

384
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:41,360
Now, in terms of actual content

385
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,690
types, like action based video or

386
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,179
sorry, like the ideation

387
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:47,820
categories, there's like action

388
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,409
based content, educational and

389
00:08:49,409 --> 00:08:50,690
another type of content.

390
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:52,299
So what I'll do is I'll cut into

391
00:08:52,299 --> 00:08:54,139
another video I recorded, which is

392
00:08:54,139 --> 00:08:55,090
a tier list of like

393
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:56,360
the different content types,

394
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:57,620
client interviews, case study

395
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,000
breakdowns, action based videos,

396
00:08:59,039 --> 00:08:59,379
et cetera.

397
00:08:59,429 --> 00:09:00,919
So that will give you a good

398
00:09:00,919 --> 00:09:02,440
understanding of that.

399
00:09:02,529 --> 00:09:03,690
But let me just keep ripping

400
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:05,019
through this and finish up.

401
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:06,740
So YouTube rewards videos that

402
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:08,570
keep viewers watching and also

403
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,580
keeps viewers on the platform.

404
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:11,279
So that's what I was saying

405
00:09:11,379 --> 00:09:11,720
earlier.

406
00:09:11,769 --> 00:09:13,419
You need to edit the video because

407
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:15,090
like look at any freaking edited

408
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:15,570
video.

409
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,970
it'll almost always have better

410
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:18,419
retention than an unedited one.

411
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:20,120
If all other variables are the

412
00:09:20,169 --> 00:09:22,529
same, speaking skills, et cetera.

413
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:24,009
There's one metric that's like not

414
00:09:24,009 --> 00:09:25,659
even trackable on YouTube studio.

415
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:26,360
That's very important.

416
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,809
It's called like session duration.

417
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:29,389
Everybody has a different term for

418
00:09:29,389 --> 00:09:31,009
an average view duration, session

419
00:09:31,009 --> 00:09:32,220
duration, whatever.

420
00:09:32,259 --> 00:09:33,179
Who cares?

421
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,529
It's basically just how long

422
00:09:34,529 --> 00:09:35,820
somebody stays watching your

423
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:36,320
stuff.

424
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:37,899
So if somebody watches three of my

425
00:09:37,899 --> 00:09:39,779
videos and they're 10 minutes long

426
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:41,039
each, their session duration

427
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:42,549
was 30 minutes and YouTube really,

428
00:09:42,549 --> 00:09:43,799
really likes that statistic.

429
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:45,759
So try and CTA between videos and

430
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:47,659
make sure one video leads into the

431
00:09:47,789 --> 00:09:48,820
next as well.

432
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,669
Next thing is in general, we're

433
00:09:51,669 --> 00:09:54,440
optimizing for search when we come

434
00:09:54,509 --> 00:09:55,919
up with video ideas,

435
00:09:56,379 --> 00:09:58,159
because if we optimize for search,

436
00:09:58,169 --> 00:10:00,120
usually it's optimized for the

437
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,460
home feed as well.

438
00:10:01,509 --> 00:10:02,419
But if you optimize for the home

439
00:10:02,539 --> 00:10:03,720
feed, it won't be for search.

440
00:10:03,789 --> 00:10:05,620
So we just always go search first.

441
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:07,129
That's also where the highest

442
00:10:07,129 --> 00:10:08,570
intent leads and traffic come

443
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:09,039
from.

444
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:10,740
So we want to optimize for that.

445
00:10:10,779 --> 00:10:12,000
We want to make our clients money.

446
00:10:12,049 --> 00:10:13,509
But yeah, also keep in mind, like

447
00:10:13,509 --> 00:10:14,820
the more watch time you get on a

448
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:15,840
channel, the more money

449
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:16,320
it's going to make.

450
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,940
This is just a random thing, but

451
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,320
it could be one hour equals a

452
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:20,019
thousand.

453
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:21,690
It could be less, it could be a

454
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:23,230
bit more, but it's a direct

455
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:24,309
correlation.

456
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:25,289
Okay.

457
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:26,980
Make sure you're posting a ton of

458
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,590
social proof on your channel or

459
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:29,809
your client's channels

460
00:10:30,289 --> 00:10:30,620
whenever you can.

461
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:31,870
This is where a lot of your

462
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:33,379
conversions will come from.

463
00:10:33,419 --> 00:10:34,700
More on this in a second.

464
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:36,639
In terms of frequency, two videos

465
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:38,490
a week actually is the sweet spot.

466
00:10:38,539 --> 00:10:39,460
Like one video a week is

467
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:41,000
completely fine and you can still

468
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,539
scale clients on that amount.

469
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:44,330
Our top performing accounts are on

470
00:10:44,409 --> 00:10:46,389
two videos a week, but most of our

471
00:10:46,529 --> 00:10:48,019
clients are on one video

472
00:10:48,059 --> 00:10:48,379
per week.

473
00:10:48,419 --> 00:10:49,740
So we usually try and get people

474
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:50,980
in on one video a week and then

475
00:10:51,019 --> 00:10:51,889
upsell into two.

476
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:53,600
And over time, the videos stack

477
00:10:53,649 --> 00:10:55,059
into like a library of like

478
00:10:55,059 --> 00:10:56,679
digital real estate that just

479
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:57,639
generates leads daily.

480
00:10:57,789 --> 00:10:59,370
And that's why it's important to

481
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:01,080
just keep making videos, making

482
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,580
videos, making videos.

483
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:03,429
Eventually you have so many

484
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:04,340
freaking videos that are just

485
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:04,870
working for you.

486
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,220
These like digital sales reps.

487
00:11:06,259 --> 00:11:07,159
It's like pretty crazy.

488
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:08,860
Focus on being consistent, not

489
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:09,759
going viral.

490
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:12,149
So what I'm going to do now is I'm

491
00:11:12,149 --> 00:11:14,029
going to cut into one video that

492
00:11:14,169 --> 00:11:15,440
goes over the different

493
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:16,980
content types like action-based,

494
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,669
how-to videos, educational videos,

495
00:11:18,669 --> 00:11:19,289
et cetera.

496
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:20,669
And then I'll also cut into

497
00:11:20,669 --> 00:11:22,470
another video that talks about how

498
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:24,019
to come up with YouTube video

499
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,320
ideas too.

500
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:26,690
So that's it for this video and

501
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:27,809
I'll see you in the next one.

502
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:29,340
This is the YouTube content tier

503
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:29,779
list.

504
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:30,690
So in this video, I'm going to

505
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:31,720
break down what videos actually

506
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,299
make money.

507
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:33,419
I'm going to rank them for you

508
00:11:33,419 --> 00:11:33,879
today.

509
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:35,029
So by the way, if you want to

510
00:11:35,029 --> 00:11:36,580
download this document, it's going

511
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:37,610
to be the first link in

512
00:11:37,659 --> 00:11:38,059
the description.

513
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,250
So here's how this tier list

514
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:39,700
works.

515
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:40,809
S tier is going to be your money

516
00:11:40,809 --> 00:11:41,240
makers.

517
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:42,700
These content types get you high

518
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,360
paying clients like clockwork.

519
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,029
A tier is also super, super strong

520
00:11:46,029 --> 00:11:47,820
and I wouldn't sleep on it at all.

521
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:49,120
It's just slightly worse than S

522
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:49,480
tier.

523
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:50,779
Great for building trust.

524
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,039
Great for getting clients.

525
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:53,850
B tier is decent for traffic, good

526
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:55,269
for building an audience, but it's

527
00:11:55,269 --> 00:11:56,230
harder to make money

528
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:56,659
directly.

529
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,360
C tier is like vanity metrics and

530
00:11:58,409 --> 00:12:00,000
get views, but it rarely makes

531
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:00,509
money.

532
00:12:00,669 --> 00:12:01,740
And then D tier, I would just

533
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:02,850
avoid this at all costs.

534
00:12:02,899 --> 00:12:03,559
It's not worth the time

535
00:12:03,659 --> 00:12:04,259
investment.

536
00:12:04,309 --> 00:12:05,799
So S tier, first things first,

537
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:06,960
client interviews.

538
00:12:07,009 --> 00:12:08,570
The money potential here is super

539
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:08,950
high.

540
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:09,700
So here's an example.

541
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,409
This is one of our clients, Eddie,

542
00:12:11,409 --> 00:12:13,039
who we helped go from 54k a month

543
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:14,220
to over 420k a month

544
00:12:14,259 --> 00:12:14,919
in four months.

545
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:16,429
So here's why client interviews

546
00:12:16,429 --> 00:12:16,860
work.

547
00:12:16,909 --> 00:12:18,309
It shows real changes with real

548
00:12:18,309 --> 00:12:18,919
numbers.

549
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:20,220
It builds trust.

550
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:21,929
And it also attracts prospects who

551
00:12:21,929 --> 00:12:23,200
want to get the same result.

552
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:24,720
So for example, if I make a video

553
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,320
and then the starting position of

554
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,659
my client is 54k a month,

555
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,019
most likely a lot of the people

556
00:12:29,019 --> 00:12:30,559
that watch this video are going to

557
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:31,700
be around that revenue

558
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:32,960
level or slightly below or

559
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,919
slightly above.

560
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,269
It's also very easy to make these

561
00:12:35,269 --> 00:12:36,620
videos because you can just show

562
00:12:36,629 --> 00:12:37,700
up to the call and ask the

563
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:38,889
client a set of predetermined

564
00:12:38,889 --> 00:12:39,490
questions.

565
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:40,759
And you can run through these in

566
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:42,200
about 15, 20 minutes.

567
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:42,899
Very, very simple.

568
00:12:43,009 --> 00:12:44,139
The other thing is client

569
00:12:44,139 --> 00:12:45,879
interviews are very hard to fake.

570
00:12:45,929 --> 00:12:47,100
And that's why they're so, so

571
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:47,669
powerful.

572
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,570
Anybody nowadays can Photoshop a

573
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:50,929
Slack screenshot or Photoshop a

574
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,429
Stripe screenshot, stuff like

575
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:52,659
that.

576
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:53,960
And then the other problem with

577
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,470
those iPhone testimonials, if any

578
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:56,460
of you have ever asked

579
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:57,779
your clients to make one, you know

580
00:12:57,779 --> 00:12:59,059
exactly what I'm about to say.

581
00:12:59,509 --> 00:13:00,320
Sometimes your client will just

582
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,389
hit record on their iPhone and

583
00:13:01,529 --> 00:13:02,740
just completely ramble about

584
00:13:02,779 --> 00:13:03,679
things that are completely

585
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:04,820
irrelevant or they're not saying

586
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:05,740
the exact right words.

587
00:13:05,809 --> 00:13:06,950
But at the same time, you don't

588
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:08,049
want to ask them to record again

589
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:09,360
because already it's a big

590
00:13:09,409 --> 00:13:10,620
ask for a testimonial.

591
00:13:10,669 --> 00:13:11,570
And then you end up with this

592
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:12,500
garbage testimonial.

593
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:13,500
But when you do a client

594
00:13:13,509 --> 00:13:14,850
interview, you can control the

595
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:16,110
interview, not in a way where

596
00:13:16,169 --> 00:13:17,519
you're telling the client what to

597
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:18,769
say, but in a way where almost

598
00:13:18,769 --> 00:13:19,970
like the client is AI and

599
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:20,980
you're prompting them with the

600
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:21,620
right questions.

601
00:13:21,669 --> 00:13:22,929
Next up here, we got case study

602
00:13:22,929 --> 00:13:23,610
breakdowns.

603
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:25,110
So this is kind of similar to a

604
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:26,639
client interview in a sense of

605
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,169
you're showing the before and

606
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:28,759
the after.

607
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:29,980
But in a case study breakdown,

608
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,019
it's not an interview.

609
00:13:31,059 --> 00:13:32,419
So the client isn't in the video,

610
00:13:32,419 --> 00:13:33,769
but rather you're either doing a

611
00:13:33,769 --> 00:13:34,840
screen recording of a

612
00:13:34,889 --> 00:13:35,799
document or it's just a talking

613
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:36,240
head.

614
00:13:36,389 --> 00:13:37,299
And you're breaking down the

615
00:13:37,419 --> 00:13:38,629
starting position that your client

616
00:13:38,769 --> 00:13:39,730
was in and the after, and

617
00:13:39,789 --> 00:13:41,070
you're breaking down the exact

618
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,460
steps that they took to reach the

619
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:43,250
new position.

620
00:13:43,299 --> 00:13:44,429
So for example, in this video, I

621
00:13:44,429 --> 00:13:45,639
went like, okay, first we have to

622
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:46,539
come up with the right

623
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:46,919
ideas.

624
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:47,740
Here's how we did that.

625
00:13:47,789 --> 00:13:49,039
Next, we had to script the videos.

626
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:50,139
Here's how we formatted them.

627
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:51,240
Next, we had to edit the videos

628
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,429
and we had to do the thumbnails.

629
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:53,240
Here's what we did for the

630
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,330
thumbnails, so on and so forth.

631
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,100
I'm just breaking down exactly

632
00:13:56,149 --> 00:13:57,700
what we did step by step.

633
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:58,559
And here's why they work.

634
00:13:58,610 --> 00:13:59,789
You're doing a deep dive into how

635
00:13:59,789 --> 00:14:00,259
you work.

636
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:01,710
It shows how complex what you do

637
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:03,220
really is, makes you look like an

638
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,700
expert, and it makes prospects

639
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:05,940
realize they need professional

640
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:06,299
help.

641
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:07,440
Going back into this first point

642
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,590
here, it's super, super important

643
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:10,000
because prospects, before

644
00:14:10,039 --> 00:14:11,090
signing up for a done-for-you

645
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:12,289
service, they want to understand

646
00:14:12,429 --> 00:14:13,000
how you work.

647
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:13,970
They want to know what it's like

648
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:14,980
to work with you, the behind the

649
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,220
scenes, what's your process,

650
00:14:16,259 --> 00:14:17,039
so on and so forth.

651
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:18,190
This is almost like letting

652
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,559
clients try before they buy.

653
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,519
Similar to practically any

654
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:21,850
software nowadays, they always

655
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:22,620
have a free trial.

656
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:23,740
So with these YouTube videos,

657
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:24,950
you're essentially kind of letting

658
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:26,120
your client get a free trial,

659
00:14:26,169 --> 00:14:27,080
but without actually doing any

660
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:27,379
work.

661
00:14:27,419 --> 00:14:28,740
So the structure is very basic.

662
00:14:28,789 --> 00:14:30,059
Hook, client background, and then

663
00:14:30,059 --> 00:14:31,200
a step-by-step breakdown of the

664
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:31,700
process.

665
00:14:31,909 --> 00:14:32,980
Talk about any tools you use,

666
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:34,340
systems, processes, tricks, et

667
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:34,820
cetera.

668
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:35,779
Go over the key lessons and

669
00:14:35,899 --> 00:14:37,110
results, and then do a clear call

670
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:37,779
to action.

671
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:38,740
Well, this should be in like every

672
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:39,360
single video.

673
00:14:39,409 --> 00:14:40,320
Next up, we have the free course

674
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:40,700
video.

675
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:41,759
So this is one we did for one of

676
00:14:41,779 --> 00:14:42,789
our clients, and the money

677
00:14:42,789 --> 00:14:44,139
potential is super, super high

678
00:14:44,179 --> 00:14:44,429
on these.

679
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:45,620
Like these can literally rip.

680
00:14:45,659 --> 00:14:46,820
We've done free course videos with

681
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:48,440
like over 100 or 200K views.

682
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:49,899
This one has 71K views at the time

683
00:14:49,899 --> 00:14:50,669
of recording.

684
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,559
And these freaking print.

685
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:53,519
Like we've had a single free

686
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:54,820
course video drive over seven

687
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,799
figures in revenue.

688
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:56,909
And when I say revenue, I mean

689
00:14:56,909 --> 00:14:57,980
cash collected, okay?

690
00:14:58,110 --> 00:14:59,019
But here's the framework.

691
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:00,490
Basically, we're giving away

692
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:01,850
everything for free in a video

693
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:03,200
that's about one to two hours

694
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:03,460
long.

695
00:15:03,509 --> 00:15:05,000
We found that videos crossing the

696
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,460
two-hour mark have diminishing

697
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:07,100
returns.

698
00:15:07,149 --> 00:15:08,230
They take a lot of time to prep, a

699
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:09,320
lot of time to record, and it's

700
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,279
just really not worth

701
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:10,860
it, to be honest.

702
00:15:10,909 --> 00:15:12,299
But that one to two-hour mark is

703
00:15:12,299 --> 00:15:13,149
the sweet spot.

704
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:14,250
Now, in this video, you want to

705
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:15,429
give away your complete method.

706
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:16,500
And the reason why this works is

707
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:17,649
because you're building massive

708
00:15:17,649 --> 00:15:18,039
trust.

709
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:19,019
You're letting people see how you

710
00:15:19,139 --> 00:15:19,379
work.

711
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:20,289
But also, they're thinking to

712
00:15:20,289 --> 00:15:21,480
themselves, damn, if this is what

713
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,679
I'm getting for free, imagine

714
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:23,639
what I'm going to get if I pay

715
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:24,000
him.

716
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:25,350
But also, when people pay you for

717
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:26,779
your coaching program, they're not

718
00:15:26,779 --> 00:15:27,779
only paying you for the

719
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:28,950
information, but they're also

720
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:29,919
paying you just to be able to

721
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:31,179
communicate with you, ask you

722
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,350
questions, and also just get

723
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:33,779
permission to do certain things.

724
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,980
So maybe in the course video,

725
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:36,090
it'll literally say, pick a

726
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:37,039
cosmetic product.

727
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:38,230
But then a student in your program

728
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:39,299
is still going to want to pay you

729
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,279
just to join the program

730
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:41,590
and ask you, hey, should I do a

731
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:42,970
cosmetic product or should I do a

732
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:43,620
face mask?

733
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:45,049
It sounds very stupid, but people

734
00:15:45,049 --> 00:15:46,340
pay you in order to just have you

735
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:47,480
hold their hand, ask

736
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:48,440
you for permission, et cetera.

737
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:49,379
But one thing that's super

738
00:15:49,379 --> 00:15:50,200
important is you do want to

739
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,259
gatekeep certain things.

740
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:52,500
So for example, on my own YouTube

741
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,559
channel, I never give away our

742
00:15:53,559 --> 00:15:54,360
outreach script.

743
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:55,909
I never give away our AI systems.

744
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:56,870
I never give away our project

745
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
management system, Airtable,

746
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,179
automations, all that stuff.

747
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:00,320
I like to gatekeep those things.

748
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,610
So we're essentially giving the

749
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:03,299
97%, but we're gatekeeping that 3%

750
00:16:03,419 --> 00:16:04,480
that is very interesting

751
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:04,980
and appealing.

752
00:16:05,029 --> 00:16:06,070
And this is also going to push

753
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:07,269
people into working with you.

754
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:08,169
Now, if you're selling a

755
00:16:08,169 --> 00:16:09,309
done-for-you service, you can give

756
00:16:09,309 --> 00:16:10,659
away even more stuff because the

757
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:12,129
number one value proposition of a

758
00:16:12,129 --> 00:16:13,620
done-for-you service is that it's

759
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:14,509
done for you and that

760
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:15,480
people don't have to do it.

761
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,659
So even if you tell them exactly

762
00:16:16,659 --> 00:16:17,970
how to do everything step-by-step,

763
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:18,929
you're still going to get

764
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:20,100
done-for-you clients through those

765
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,100
YouTube videos because people

766
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:21,940
don't want to do things

767
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:22,320
themselves.

768
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:23,460
Now, the thing with these is you

769
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:24,610
have to embrace the do-it-yourself

770
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:25,320
mentality.

771
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,279
A lot of business owners like

772
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:27,309
doing things themselves or

773
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:28,379
understanding things.

774
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,559
So they're searching things up on

775
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:30,690
YouTube, like how to run Facebook

776
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:31,580
ads, how to come up

777
00:16:31,629 --> 00:16:32,480
with a YouTube video idea, how to

778
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,039
write scripts.

779
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:34,480
They're searching these things up.

780
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:35,759
So we want to have our videos up

781
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:36,179
there.

782
00:16:36,259 --> 00:16:37,360
A free course video is going to

783
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,509
show a business owner exactly how

784
00:16:38,649 --> 00:16:39,860
to do the thing themselves,

785
00:16:39,909 --> 00:16:41,360
but they're still going to pay

786
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:41,759
you.

787
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:43,139
Usually for the template, you just

788
00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:44,370
want to say like full dropshipping

789
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:45,019
course, a hundred

790
00:16:45,059 --> 00:16:46,220
percent free, or there's actually

791
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:47,309
a couple other templates you can

792
00:16:47,309 --> 00:16:47,620
use.

793
00:16:47,669 --> 00:16:48,580
You can just search up free course

794
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:49,610
on YouTube, type in different

795
00:16:49,669 --> 00:16:50,679
niches, and you're going to

796
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:51,659
see all the different ways of

797
00:16:51,779 --> 00:16:52,490
doing your titles.

798
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:53,990
One thing that's super important

799
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:55,370
with these free course videos is

800
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:56,309
the CTA at the end.

801
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,159
So you want to give them an

802
00:16:57,159 --> 00:16:57,659
ultimatum.

803
00:16:57,710 --> 00:16:58,860
You want to say option one, you

804
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:00,100
can watch this video and treat it

805
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,120
like every other YouTube

806
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:02,320
video ever, where you just watch a

807
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:03,350
little bit or don't watch it at

808
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:04,119
all, throw it in the

809
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:05,078
watch later and never watch it

810
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:05,460
again.

811
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,769
Or B, you can try and implement

812
00:17:06,769 --> 00:17:07,359
yourself.

813
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:08,470
You'll get decently far because

814
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:09,348
this is a great video, but

815
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:10,559
naturally you're going to hit

816
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:11,220
roadblocks and you're

817
00:17:11,309 --> 00:17:12,710
to have nobody to ask for help or

818
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:14,259
option three, you work with us,

819
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:15,769
join my program or sign up for my

820
00:17:15,859 --> 00:17:16,779
service, and then you get this

821
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:17,279
result.

822
00:17:17,318 --> 00:17:17,950
So it's very important.

823
00:17:18,009 --> 00:17:19,098
You have that type of CTA towards

824
00:17:19,098 --> 00:17:19,509
the end.

825
00:17:19,568 --> 00:17:20,769
And then you also want to have a

826
00:17:20,769 --> 00:17:22,059
CTA around the two minute mark,

827
00:17:22,088 --> 00:17:23,369
four minute mark, somewhere in

828
00:17:23,369 --> 00:17:23,559
that

829
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:24,759
range, just because there's going

830
00:17:24,759 --> 00:17:25,640
to be a lot of drop off after

831
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,039
eight minutes, 30 minutes, et

832
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:27,210
cetera.

833
00:17:27,259 --> 00:17:28,619
Next category, A tier.

834
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:30,170
This is very strong for lead gen,

835
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:31,750
and this should be the majority of

836
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,130
the videos on your channel.

837
00:17:33,269 --> 00:17:34,519
This is going to be content that

838
00:17:34,519 --> 00:17:35,509
builds trust and gets good

839
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:37,059
prospects in through the door.

840
00:17:37,099 --> 00:17:38,640
So with action-based videos, we're

841
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,960
basically just telling people

842
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:41,000
exactly how to do something,

843
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:41,579
step-by-step.

844
00:17:41,619 --> 00:17:42,539
Similar to what I was saying

845
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:43,740
earlier, we want to embrace that

846
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,430
do-it-yourself mentality and show

847
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,309
people how to do things

848
00:17:46,309 --> 00:17:46,940
themselves.

849
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:48,309
So this video is a smart lead AI

850
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:49,440
beginner tutorial.

851
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,700
If anybody searches up on Google

852
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,119
or ask ChatGPT, they say, hey, you

853
00:17:52,119 --> 00:17:53,539
know, what's the best cold email

854
00:17:53,579 --> 00:17:54,210
software or something?

855
00:17:54,269 --> 00:17:55,420
They're going to find smart lead

856
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:56,509
as one of the options, if not the

857
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:57,819
number one option, since it's

858
00:17:57,869 --> 00:17:58,440
the best one.

859
00:17:58,490 --> 00:17:59,559
And they're going to want to watch

860
00:17:59,559 --> 00:18:00,680
this video to understand how to do

861
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:01,640
the thing themselves.

862
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:02,750
But as they watch it, they're

863
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:03,930
going to learn that like, okay,

864
00:18:04,069 --> 00:18:05,660
this dude, Matt Lucero, he's very

865
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:05,930
smart.

866
00:18:06,029 --> 00:18:06,940
Maybe I should watch some of his

867
00:18:07,059 --> 00:18:08,099
other videos, or maybe I should

868
00:18:08,099 --> 00:18:09,279
just pay him to do the thing for

869
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:09,420
me.

870
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:10,599
So one example of an action-based

871
00:18:10,599 --> 00:18:11,680
video is how to create a YouTube

872
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,119
sales funnel that books 20 plus

873
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:13,700
calls per month.

874
00:18:14,069 --> 00:18:15,250
Usually action-based videos start

875
00:18:15,259 --> 00:18:16,539
with the word how to most of the

876
00:18:16,539 --> 00:18:18,210
time, not necessarily, but that's

877
00:18:18,309 --> 00:18:19,500
just a very basic way to do it.

878
00:18:19,539 --> 00:18:20,400
So again, this works because

879
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,420
you're showing your expertise in

880
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:21,789
action.

881
00:18:21,869 --> 00:18:23,109
You're attracting people that are

882
00:18:23,109 --> 00:18:24,079
actively looking for your

883
00:18:24,099 --> 00:18:24,640
solution.

884
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:25,950
And you're also showing how

885
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:27,819
complex proper implementation is.

886
00:18:27,859 --> 00:18:29,309
So a couple of templates here, how

887
00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:30,359
to get specific result in

888
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:31,680
timeframe or the new way to do

889
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:32,759
thing in 2025.

890
00:18:32,849 --> 00:18:33,950
The next category we have is

891
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:35,000
educational videos.

892
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:36,269
So the money potential again is

893
00:18:36,269 --> 00:18:36,619
high.

894
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:37,900
So here's an example why YouTube

895
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,119
is the best way to get clients in

896
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:40,470
2025 or the three best

897
00:18:40,579 --> 00:18:41,960
online businesses to make 1K a day

898
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,359
with online in 2025.

899
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,640
This is Nathan Nazareth.

900
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,039
So usually the format starts with

901
00:18:46,039 --> 00:18:46,720
the word why.

902
00:18:46,769 --> 00:18:48,049
This video, just to explain it a

903
00:18:48,049 --> 00:18:49,160
little bit better, you're

904
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,569
essentially educating them on

905
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:51,809
something, but you're not telling

906
00:18:51,809 --> 00:18:52,970
them exactly step-by-step how to

907
00:18:53,009 --> 00:18:53,359
do it.

908
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,269
So if I made a video like this,

909
00:18:54,269 --> 00:18:55,269
you know, one of the businesses

910
00:18:55,269 --> 00:18:56,259
would be a content agency.

911
00:18:56,309 --> 00:18:56,930
Then it would be like drop

912
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:57,220
shipping.

913
00:18:57,369 --> 00:18:58,440
And then maybe it's like, I don't

914
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,440
know, clipping or something

915
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,559
random, even though clipping is

916
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:00,900
terrible,

917
00:19:01,029 --> 00:19:02,130
even though clipping is far worse

918
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:03,109
than a content agency in this

919
00:19:03,109 --> 00:19:04,349
video, I'm going to educate them

920
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,579
on what each business model is and

921
00:19:05,579 --> 00:19:06,619
the pros and cons, but I'm not

922
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,960
going to tell them step-by-step

923
00:19:08,009 --> 00:19:09,039
how to get their first client, how

924
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:09,920
to do this, how to launch the

925
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,019
store, whatever it is, because

926
00:19:11,089 --> 00:19:11,740
then it would become an

927
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:12,740
action-based video, but this is

928
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:13,329
educational.

929
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,750
I'm just kind of staying a little

930
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,099
bit on top of the ice, not really

931
00:19:16,099 --> 00:19:17,480
telling them exactly what to do,

932
00:19:17,529 --> 00:19:18,640
but I'm still educating them and

933
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,769
it's still a valuable video.

934
00:19:19,869 --> 00:19:20,640
Educational videos and

935
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,789
action-based are going to be your

936
00:19:21,789 --> 00:19:23,160
top of funnel, just bringing more

937
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:23,369
and more

938
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:24,859
people into the channel with the

939
00:19:24,859 --> 00:19:26,339
goal of getting them to watch the

940
00:19:26,339 --> 00:19:27,180
S tier videos.

941
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:28,279
Next up, we have B tier.

942
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,559
So this is decent for traffic, but

943
00:19:29,559 --> 00:19:30,420
it's harder to make money

944
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:30,960
directly.

945
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:32,150
First things first, we got

946
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:33,700
industry commentary, also known as

947
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:34,529
opinion videos.

948
00:19:34,579 --> 00:19:35,500
So this is like medium, you know,

949
00:19:35,619 --> 00:19:36,509
you're not really going to make

950
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:37,359
money from this video.

951
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:38,829
This is an example, is the content

952
00:19:38,829 --> 00:19:40,779
agency space saturated in 2025?

953
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,480
Another one, why 89% of marketing

954
00:19:42,569 --> 00:19:44,309
agencies fail, the brutal truth.

955
00:19:44,369 --> 00:19:45,279
You're just telling them your

956
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:45,819
opinion.

957
00:19:45,859 --> 00:19:47,339
There's not really any actionable

958
00:19:47,339 --> 00:19:48,109
advice going on.

959
00:19:48,259 --> 00:19:49,180
So overall, you're just making

960
00:19:49,299 --> 00:19:49,920
less money from it.

961
00:19:50,019 --> 00:19:50,680
It's good because it builds

962
00:19:50,779 --> 00:19:51,480
thought leadership.

963
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:52,799
It shows industry knowledge.

964
00:19:52,839 --> 00:19:54,000
It attracts prospects and it's

965
00:19:54,009 --> 00:19:55,619
good for engagement, but it's hard

966
00:19:55,619 --> 00:19:57,059
to directly convert people

967
00:19:57,099 --> 00:19:58,609
into sales calls from a video like

968
00:19:58,609 --> 00:19:59,039
this.

969
00:19:59,079 --> 00:19:59,980
So I'm not saying you shouldn't

970
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:00,660
make these at all.

971
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:01,799
You know, these should just be

972
00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:02,890
sprinkled in as I'm doing on my

973
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:03,710
own main channel.

974
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:04,680
Next up, you have tools and

975
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:05,660
software reviews.

976
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:06,809
So you could say, I tested 10

977
00:20:06,809 --> 00:20:07,779
email marketing tools.

978
00:20:07,829 --> 00:20:09,009
Here's the best one or every tool

979
00:20:09,009 --> 00:20:10,039
you need to run a successful

980
00:20:10,059 --> 00:20:11,509
content agency in 2025.

981
00:20:11,569 --> 00:20:13,000
This would fall under the software

982
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:13,809
review category.

983
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,039
It's good because you're abusing

984
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:16,180
high search volume and you're also

985
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,339
showing practical expertise.

986
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:18,299
And there's going to be people

987
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,329
searching up like Airtable

988
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:19,920
tutorial.

989
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,170
Or if I go back up here to this,

990
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:22,519
like a smart lead tutorial.

991
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:23,660
Now, this one specifically is a

992
00:20:23,779 --> 00:20:24,140
tutorial.

993
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:25,099
It's not a review.

994
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,119
So it's two different things.

995
00:20:26,269 --> 00:20:27,569
But here we're captivating search

996
00:20:27,569 --> 00:20:28,759
traffic from the keyword smart

997
00:20:28,789 --> 00:20:29,400
lead.ai.

998
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,099
Same concept.

999
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,119
I find that the viewers of these

1000
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,019
videos have too much of a

1001
00:20:32,029 --> 00:20:33,079
do-it-yourself mindset.

1002
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:33,920
They really just want to know,

1003
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:34,779
hey, is this software good and go

1004
00:20:34,829 --> 00:20:35,369
do it themselves.

1005
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,420
It's hard to get done for you

1006
00:20:36,539 --> 00:20:37,599
buyers or even like coaching

1007
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:38,400
program buyers.

1008
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:40,099
Now, C tier, vanity metrics.

1009
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:41,259
These get views, but they rarely

1010
00:20:41,259 --> 00:20:41,759
make money.

1011
00:20:41,809 --> 00:20:42,859
Reaction videos.

1012
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:43,819
I really wouldn't waste my time

1013
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:44,920
with this, to be honest.

1014
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,160
It's purely entertainment value.

1015
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,019
No authority building.

1016
00:20:47,059 --> 00:20:47,980
Gets the wrong audience.

1017
00:20:48,069 --> 00:20:49,440
And it's also like lazy content

1018
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,079
creation.

1019
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:51,279
A viewer's going to watch this and

1020
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,309
know you kind of just want to make

1021
00:20:52,369 --> 00:20:53,000
a quick and easy,

1022
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:53,700
lazy video.

1023
00:20:53,799 --> 00:20:54,690
Now, with behind the scenes and

1024
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:55,750
day-in-the-life type of videos,

1025
00:20:55,809 --> 00:20:56,900
these are cool for building

1026
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,380
a bit of an audience with your

1027
00:20:58,380 --> 00:20:59,859
prospects and audience.

1028
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:01,230
But honestly, it's going to waste

1029
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:02,519
your entire day because you have

1030
00:21:02,519 --> 00:21:03,710
to put so much mental bandwidth

1031
00:21:03,789 --> 00:21:04,680
into making sure the camera's

1032
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,890
always recording, entertaining the

1033
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:06,900
camera, so on and so forth.

1034
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:07,859
But these just won't really make

1035
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:08,400
you money.

1036
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:09,650
They attract the wrong type of

1037
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:11,150
person, which is typically people

1038
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:12,460
who don't have money to buy

1039
00:21:12,509 --> 00:21:13,339
your done-for-you service or your

1040
00:21:13,339 --> 00:21:13,980
coaching program.

1041
00:21:14,019 --> 00:21:15,230
If you're targeting B2B, you

1042
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:16,480
should completely avoid these

1043
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,490
videos completely.

1044
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:18,589
But if you have a B2C coaching

1045
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,630
program, you know, you can

1046
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:20,640
sprinkle some of these in,

1047
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,500
you know, see how they do.

1048
00:21:21,549 --> 00:21:22,920
But it's really just for views.

1049
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:23,740
You're not going to get direct

1050
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:24,500
conversions from this.

1051
00:21:24,539 --> 00:21:25,920
It does build your personal brand,

1052
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,099
show lifestyle outcomes.

1053
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,440
It makes you feel more human as

1054
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:28,819
well.

1055
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:30,160
And it's good for engagement, but

1056
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,299
it's more entertainment than

1057
00:21:31,299 --> 00:21:31,910
education.

1058
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:32,789
Now, D tier.

1059
00:21:32,849 --> 00:21:33,930
You need to avoid these at all

1060
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:34,380
costs.

1061
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:35,309
These are time wasters that

1062
00:21:35,309 --> 00:21:36,539
typically hurt your business.

1063
00:21:36,579 --> 00:21:37,490
So first up, we have personal

1064
00:21:37,619 --> 00:21:37,960
vlogs.

1065
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,059
So we have a vlog here on the

1066
00:21:39,059 --> 00:21:39,660
right side.

1067
00:21:39,769 --> 00:21:41,400
They went to go watch a Euro 2024.

1068
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,099
Shout out Farouk.

1069
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:43,140
We made this video on the left and

1070
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:44,440
it performed super, super well.

1071
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:45,779
We got 12K views and I know he

1072
00:21:45,779 --> 00:21:46,809
made a lot of money from that

1073
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:47,339
video.

1074
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:48,529
However, the video on the right

1075
00:21:48,529 --> 00:21:49,630
was only 1.3K views.

1076
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:50,660
I know it attracted the wrong

1077
00:21:50,779 --> 00:21:51,160
audience.

1078
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:52,289
They didn't get conversion, so on

1079
00:21:52,289 --> 00:21:52,839
and so forth.

1080
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,309
Every single info seller I speak

1081
00:21:54,309 --> 00:21:56,119
to who's spamming these vlogs, the

1082
00:21:56,119 --> 00:21:57,859
vlogs don't get qualified

1083
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:59,000
prospects in through the door.

1084
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:00,230
These videos on the left are the

1085
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:00,980
money makers.

1086
00:22:01,029 --> 00:22:02,329
Now, usually these are typically

1087
00:22:02,329 --> 00:22:03,519
flipped where the vlog has a lot

1088
00:22:03,549 --> 00:22:04,980
of views and then the educational

1089
00:22:05,019 --> 00:22:06,519
videos don't have that many views.

1090
00:22:06,569 --> 00:22:08,049
In this specific case, it's not

1091
00:22:08,049 --> 00:22:09,710
like that, but usually you need to

1092
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:11,009
get 10 million views

1093
00:22:11,089 --> 00:22:12,589
on a vlog to get the same amount

1094
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:14,289
of leads as you'd get from a video

1095
00:22:14,289 --> 00:22:15,440
with 2K views on an

1096
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:16,079
action-based video.

1097
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:17,519
Now, that's an exaggeration.

1098
00:22:17,559 --> 00:22:18,630
Those are random numbers, but I

1099
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:19,779
think you understand the concept

1100
00:22:19,799 --> 00:22:20,940
that I'm trying to put you on.

1101
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:22,059
Now, these were posted on the

1102
00:22:22,059 --> 00:22:23,230
exact same channel and you can see

1103
00:22:23,369 --> 00:22:24,539
how the audience really liked

1104
00:22:24,589 --> 00:22:25,349
this video on the left, but they

1105
00:22:25,349 --> 00:22:26,170
didn't really like this video on

1106
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:26,619
the right.

1107
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:27,869
So again, we only made this video

1108
00:22:27,869 --> 00:22:28,410
on the left.

1109
00:22:28,509 --> 00:22:30,150
The money potential is very low,

1110
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:31,769
so just avoid these weekend trip

1111
00:22:31,769 --> 00:22:33,099
to Las Vegas or I just bought

1112
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:34,890
this new XYZ, whatever it is.

1113
00:22:35,009 --> 00:22:35,920
There's no business value.

1114
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,140
It confuses your positioning.

1115
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,420
It also wastes your subscriber

1116
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:38,930
quality.

1117
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:40,099
This is also why you see a lot of

1118
00:22:40,099 --> 00:22:40,859
big channels.

1119
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,440
They split their vlog channel from

1120
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,730
their main channel, which I

1121
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:45,029
actually really recommend

1122
00:22:45,079 --> 00:22:46,000
because if you do everything on

1123
00:22:46,119 --> 00:22:47,039
the same channel, you're really

1124
00:22:47,089 --> 00:22:48,380
going to make the audience dirty

1125
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,519
in a sense where you're going to

1126
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:50,690
have all these low-value people

1127
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:51,799
mixed in with the high-value

1128
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:52,960
people and then when you put out a

1129
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:53,789
video, it's going to get

1130
00:22:53,849 --> 00:22:55,220
recommended to everyone and then

1131
00:22:55,269 --> 00:22:56,180
the low-value people aren't going

1132
00:22:56,299 --> 00:22:57,210
to watch it and it's just going to

1133
00:22:57,269 --> 00:22:57,920
ruin everything.

1134
00:22:57,970 --> 00:22:59,519
Now, you can sprinkle these in if

1135
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:01,099
you're a B2C dude or if it's just

1136
00:23:01,099 --> 00:23:02,210
for personal reasons,

1137
00:23:02,309 --> 00:23:03,660
but if you're B2B, I would also

1138
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:04,859
especially avoid these.

1139
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,190
Random entertainment content

1140
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:07,779
number 11, trying random food or

1141
00:23:07,789 --> 00:23:09,279
just doing random things, kind

1142
00:23:09,319 --> 00:23:10,480
of similar to vlogs, just avoid

1143
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:10,880
these.

1144
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,019
It's completely off-brand.

1145
00:23:12,069 --> 00:23:13,220
You're going to get entertainment

1146
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:14,230
seekers and it destroys your

1147
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:15,359
credibility, zero business

1148
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:15,670
relevance.

1149
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:16,900
It's just a waste of time.

1150
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:18,140
So now here's some common mistakes

1151
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:19,160
that kill conversions.

1152
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,529
Mistake number one is chasing

1153
00:23:20,529 --> 00:23:21,450
views over value.

1154
00:23:21,559 --> 00:23:22,700
So instead of chasing that next

1155
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,019
million-view YouTube video, you

1156
00:23:24,019 --> 00:23:25,099
should be chasing a video

1157
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:26,890
that has anywhere from 300 views

1158
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:28,680
to 10K views that actually gives

1159
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,390
good value.

1160
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:30,920
It needs to be specific content

1161
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,160
tailored to your ICP.

1162
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,660
Next up is weak call to action.

1163
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:34,859
So you actually need to like tell

1164
00:23:34,869 --> 00:23:36,170
them what to do, like book a call,

1165
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:36,880
first link in the

1166
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:37,160
description.

1167
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:38,420
Don't be like, oh, subscribe or

1168
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:39,700
just magically think they'll find

1169
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:40,210
the link.

1170
00:23:40,269 --> 00:23:40,920
That's not going to work.

1171
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:42,539
Mistake number three is holding

1172
00:23:42,539 --> 00:23:44,200
back your best content and keeping

1173
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,279
all the good stuff for

1174
00:23:45,329 --> 00:23:45,940
your paid clients.

1175
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:46,630
You don't want to do that.

1176
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,829
Of course, you want to get keep

1177
00:23:47,829 --> 00:23:49,109
some things from your YouTube and

1178
00:23:49,109 --> 00:23:50,009
only give that to your

1179
00:23:50,059 --> 00:23:51,490
paid people, but you can't just

1180
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:53,059
make videos with no value in it.

1181
00:23:53,109 --> 00:23:54,160
You can't make a video titled how

1182
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,140
to come up with YouTube video

1183
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:55,559
ideas.

1184
00:23:55,609 --> 00:23:56,690
But then when you click on the

1185
00:23:56,690 --> 00:23:57,849
video, I'm just flexing social

1186
00:23:57,990 --> 00:23:58,900
proof and I don't tell

1187
00:23:58,950 --> 00:23:59,859
you how to come up with ideas.

1188
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:01,000
And I tell you to book a call to

1189
00:24:01,019 --> 00:24:02,109
learn how to come up with ideas

1190
00:24:02,109 --> 00:24:03,160
because then that person

1191
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,059
is going to feel click baited.

1192
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:04,920
They're going to be like, man,

1193
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:05,579
Eamon is terrible.

1194
00:24:05,609 --> 00:24:06,680
I don't want to sign up with him.

1195
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,519
So on and so forth.

1196
00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:08,720
Finally, we have mistake number

1197
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:09,960
four, which is trying to appeal to

1198
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:10,559
everyone.

1199
00:24:10,599 --> 00:24:11,700
Generic content that doesn't

1200
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,849
connect isn't going to make you

1201
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:13,339
money.

1202
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:14,430
Instead, like I was saying

1203
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:15,630
earlier, you need to make super

1204
00:24:15,769 --> 00:24:17,180
specific content that attracts

1205
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:18,359
your ideal client.

1206
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:19,319
The long-term vision here is that

1207
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:20,150
we're not building a YouTube

1208
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:20,650
channel.

1209
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,259
We're building a 24 seven sales

1210
00:24:22,259 --> 00:24:23,630
team that qualifies prospects

1211
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:24,940
while you sleep a trust

1212
00:24:25,329 --> 00:24:26,390
building machine where every video

1213
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:27,730
shows expertise, a competitive

1214
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:29,180
moat through consistent value

1215
00:24:29,619 --> 00:24:30,769
delivery, a scalable lead source

1216
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:32,130
that compounds over time and a

1217
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:33,470
premium positioning tool where

1218
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:35,109
high value content justifies high

1219
00:24:35,109 --> 00:24:35,980
ticket prices.

1220
00:24:36,019 --> 00:24:37,049
In terms of what to do next in

1221
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:38,500
your 30 day action plan, try and

1222
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:39,700
pump out a client interview

1223
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:40,819
first, because these are super

1224
00:24:40,819 --> 00:24:41,299
easy to do.

1225
00:24:41,349 --> 00:24:42,500
You can also integrate these into

1226
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:43,589
your funnel, send them out to your

1227
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:44,740
email list, send them to

1228
00:24:44,789 --> 00:24:46,140
old prospects, so on and so forth.

1229
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:47,740
Get some cash in through the door.

1230
00:24:47,789 --> 00:24:48,970
Next up, you want to create an

1231
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:50,029
action based video about your

1232
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:51,289
industry, how to come up

1233
00:24:51,349 --> 00:24:52,380
with YouTube video ideas, how to

1234
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:53,460
make a dropshipping store, so on

1235
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:54,059
and so forth.

1236
00:24:54,109 --> 00:24:55,430
Next, film a case study breakdown

1237
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:56,240
of your methods.

1238
00:24:56,289 --> 00:24:57,740
So take one of your best students

1239
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:59,450
or clients, show step-by-step how

1240
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:00,529
they got the result that

1241
00:25:00,609 --> 00:25:01,869
they got to, and then week four,

1242
00:25:01,869 --> 00:25:02,849
just do another action based

1243
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:03,420
video.

1244
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:04,849
Continuously loop this and then

1245
00:25:04,849 --> 00:25:06,210
around month two or three, if

1246
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:07,269
you're ready, try and pump

1247
00:25:07,349 --> 00:25:08,420
out that free course video.

1248
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:09,740
Make sure you're optimizing based

1249
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:10,869
on results, so double down on

1250
00:25:10,869 --> 00:25:12,019
content types that generate

1251
00:25:12,059 --> 00:25:13,640
calls, stop making content that

1252
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,240
only gets you views, and focus on

1253
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,180
S tier and A tier

1254
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,099
content 99% of the time.

1255
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:19,240
Now, if you want us to handle all

1256
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,309
of this done for you and you're

1257
00:25:20,309 --> 00:25:21,630
making over 50K a month,

1258
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,930
we'll do strategy, scripting,

1259
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:24,230
editing, thumbnails, SEO, and

1260
00:25:24,279 --> 00:25:25,099
posting for you.

1261
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:26,349
You just have to record for two

1262
00:25:26,349 --> 00:25:27,160
hours per month.

1263
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,119
Just apply here.

1264
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,119
Either click this document if

1265
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,150
you're on the doc or if you're in

1266
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:30,940
the YouTube video, it's

1267
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:31,640
going to be linked in the

1268
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:32,279
description.

1269
00:25:32,329 --> 00:25:33,240
But that's all for this video.

1270
00:25:33,329 --> 00:25:34,109
Thank you so much for watching,

1271
00:25:34,109 --> 00:25:34,980
and I'll see you in the next one.
