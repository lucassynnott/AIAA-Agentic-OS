1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:00,820
All right, so in this video, I'm

2
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:01,919
going to walk through all of the

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,299
tools and platforms that

4
00:00:03,399 --> 00:00:04,379
you're going to be using, like

5
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:05,339
which software is a payment

6
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:06,629
processor, project management

7
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:07,000
tool,

8
00:00:07,099 --> 00:00:08,390
which automation software, all

9
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:09,869
this stuff, everything we use to

10
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,330
run our 100k month plus

11
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:12,220
content agency.

12
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:13,589
So I've tried like every software.

13
00:00:13,589 --> 00:00:14,699
So I'm just gonna like cut the

14
00:00:14,699 --> 00:00:15,400
fluff and tell you

15
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:16,519
exactly what you need.

16
00:00:16,519 --> 00:00:18,039
So yeah, I'm actually gonna cut to

17
00:00:18,129 --> 00:00:19,500
another video I recorded that

18
00:00:19,589 --> 00:00:20,239
covers this

19
00:00:20,339 --> 00:00:21,379
exact topic already.

20
00:00:21,379 --> 00:00:22,559
So I'll see you there.

21
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:24,429
I scaled my content agency to over

22
00:00:24,429 --> 00:00:25,300
seven figures

23
00:00:25,399 --> 00:00:27,160
per year using this exact tech

24
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,230
stack and you guys can steal it.

25
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:30,690
I've ran through a ton of

26
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:31,300
softwares

27
00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:32,189
and I'm just gonna reveal

28
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:32,689
everything.

29
00:00:32,789 --> 00:00:33,729
So let's get right into it.

30
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:34,740
First things first on the

31
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:34,960
marketing

32
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:35,460
side.

33
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,250
Very, very, very simple.

34
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:38,020
Hypefury.

35
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:40,070
This is a tweet scheduling tool.

36
00:00:40,179 --> 00:00:41,479
I get a lot of clients

37
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:42,539
through Twitter.

38
00:00:42,539 --> 00:00:44,109
So I schedule my tweets through

39
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:44,799
Hypefury.

40
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:46,280
I also do auto DMs on there.

41
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:46,719
So I give

42
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:47,500
away lead magnets.

43
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:48,640
I made another YouTube video all

44
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:49,340
about Twitter.

45
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:50,619
So if you guys want to watch that,

46
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,179
it's going to be somewhere on my

47
00:00:52,179 --> 00:00:53,200
YouTube channel.

48
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,700
And then next I pay like I think

49
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:55,719
$11 a month or

50
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,070
something for a checkmark on

51
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:57,630
Twitter.

52
00:00:57,630 --> 00:00:59,270
And I also pay around 20 bucks a

53
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:00,520
month or something for a

54
00:01:00,619 --> 00:01:01,579
checkmark on Instagram.

55
00:01:01,579 --> 00:01:02,729
Gives you added authority.

56
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:03,909
I think also on Twitter, if you

57
00:01:03,909 --> 00:01:04,840
don't have a checkmark,

58
00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:06,159
you can't outreach to a good

59
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:07,709
amount of people like qualified

60
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,709
leads on Twitter.

61
00:01:08,709 --> 00:01:09,909
So it's important you

62
00:01:10,019 --> 00:01:11,659
have it so you don't look like a

63
00:01:11,659 --> 00:01:13,200
bot and it's very cheap.

64
00:01:13,209 --> 00:01:14,530
And then next is card.

65
00:01:14,629 --> 00:01:15,569
C-A-R-R-D.

66
00:01:15,579 --> 00:01:16,219
This is what

67
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:17,250
we use for websites.

68
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,650
I'm currently on Webflow, but

69
00:01:18,739 --> 00:01:20,019
before for the longest time up

70
00:01:20,019 --> 00:01:20,599
until like,

71
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:21,280
what was it?

72
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,650
90 or 60K a month.

73
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:24,140
Actually, I was using card.

74
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:26,239
It's literally like $60 per year

75
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:26,329
or

76
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:27,459
something like that.

77
00:01:27,459 --> 00:01:29,010
Very good, simple website builder

78
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:29,879
gets the job done.

79
00:01:29,879 --> 00:01:30,390
Amazing.

80
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:31,480
Now on the sales side,

81
00:01:31,579 --> 00:01:32,629
very, very simple.

82
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:34,349
So PandaDoc is what we use for

83
00:01:34,349 --> 00:01:35,170
contracts.

84
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:37,129
So you need a contract with every

85
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:38,480
content agency client you guys

86
00:01:38,489 --> 00:01:38,849
sign.

87
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:40,010
If you guys want my contract

88
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,340
template, just join the free

89
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:41,709
group.

90
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:43,230
And if enough people post in there

91
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:44,510
saying they want it, I'll put it

92
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:45,099
in there.

93
00:01:45,099 --> 00:01:46,180
Next is Calendly.

94
00:01:46,359 --> 00:01:47,409
So we use this for meeting

95
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:48,030
booking.

96
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:49,409
So people book in sales calls

97
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:50,290
through there.

98
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:51,359
And then next is

99
00:01:51,459 --> 00:01:51,870
fanbases.

100
00:01:51,969 --> 00:01:53,079
So I know a lot of you guys

101
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:54,719
probably have never seen fanbases

102
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:55,230
before.

103
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:55,980
It's a payment

104
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:56,670
processor.

105
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:57,939
So it's like the same thing as

106
00:01:58,019 --> 00:01:58,409
Stripe.

107
00:01:58,420 --> 00:01:59,900
If you guys want to use fanbases,

108
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:00,900
there's going to be

109
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:02,269
a link in the description.

110
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:03,959
So people who go through me get a

111
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:05,000
discounted rate.

112
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:06,290
And basically I don't use

113
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:07,969
Stripe anymore because I moved to

114
00:02:07,969 --> 00:02:09,469
Dubai and Dubai Stripe is very,

115
00:02:09,469 --> 00:02:10,020
very bad.

116
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,280
Another good alternative,

117
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,580
you know, WAP can work as well.

118
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:15,699
Stripe, if you're in Canada, USA,

119
00:02:15,699 --> 00:02:17,560
UK, you know, Stripe typically

120
00:02:17,629 --> 00:02:17,810
gets

121
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:18,599
the job done.

122
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:20,389
But fanbases is very, very good as

123
00:02:20,389 --> 00:02:20,689
well.

124
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:22,039
No complaints at all.

125
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:23,159
Very simple UI as well,

126
00:02:23,259 --> 00:02:24,740
like no funky business.

127
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:26,580
Next, I use Google Meets for my

128
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:27,370
meetings.

129
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:29,120
So like I don't use Zoom just

130
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:29,419
because

131
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,300
Google Meets gets the job done and

132
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,030
it's free.

133
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,680
And then next is the operations

134
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,120
section, which is the

135
00:02:35,219 --> 00:02:36,069
biggest one.

136
00:02:36,069 --> 00:02:38,169
So our tech stack for operations,

137
00:02:38,169 --> 00:02:39,699
we use Zapier and Make.

138
00:02:39,699 --> 00:02:41,599
So these, they do the same thing,

139
00:02:41,699 --> 00:02:42,750
like it's an automation tool.

140
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:43,949
If you're not already familiar

141
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,159
with them, they just connect

142
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:45,840
different apps

143
00:02:45,939 --> 00:02:46,990
and they set up automation.

144
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:48,479
So whenever a new video is ready,

145
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:49,699
it like, and we approve it on

146
00:02:49,699 --> 00:02:50,159
frame and

147
00:02:50,259 --> 00:02:51,710
automatically sends to the client,

148
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:53,030
like all that stuff is in Make.

149
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:54,219
But typically for like more

150
00:02:54,219 --> 00:02:54,490
simpler

151
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:56,009
automations, we have a lot of them

152
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,129
running through Zapier.

153
00:02:57,229 --> 00:02:58,590
So it's basically just the glue

154
00:02:58,590 --> 00:02:59,599
between all of

155
00:02:59,699 --> 00:03:00,990
our different softwares and the

156
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:01,789
whole agency.

157
00:03:01,789 --> 00:03:03,020
And then next is our project

158
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,159
management system.

159
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:04,599
So we

160
00:03:04,699 --> 00:03:05,750
currently use Airtable.

161
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:07,469
At about 50k a month or 60k, we

162
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,199
switched from Trello to Airtable.

163
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,919
Because what happened with Trello

164
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:12,199
is we just had too many clients

165
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:13,360
and we didn't want to just keep,

166
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,849
like the editors didn't want to

167
00:03:14,849 --> 00:03:16,229
click through the individual

168
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,969
client boards to figure out what's

169
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,110
assigned to them, et cetera.

170
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:20,280
And I don't blame them at all.

171
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,969
So we switched to Airtable because

172
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:22,780
it's like

173
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:24,110
a master knowledge base.

174
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:25,550
And then the editors each have

175
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:26,710
their own interface.

176
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:27,840
It's super, super cool.

177
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:28,939
Let me know if you guys want a

178
00:03:28,939 --> 00:03:30,129
dedicated video on our Airtable

179
00:03:30,129 --> 00:03:30,560
setup.

180
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:32,270
But basically editors can log

181
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:33,479
into their interface.

182
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:34,960
They see what videos they have.

183
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,580
And then on the backend, like me,

184
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:37,319
the ops manager,

185
00:03:37,419 --> 00:03:38,830
the team, we have like this really

186
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,189
big interface where we can assign

187
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:40,800
videos.

188
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,590
We can see all the

189
00:03:41,719 --> 00:03:43,009
client information, so on and so

190
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:43,400
forth.

191
00:03:43,419 --> 00:03:44,729
It's really good once you start

192
00:03:44,729 --> 00:03:45,719
making more money.

193
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:46,580
But to be

194
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,639
honest, everybody below like 20,

195
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:50,800
10, 15k a month, keep it simple

196
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,689
and use Trello.

197
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,000
Next is Slack.

198
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,719
So we

199
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:54,539
use Slack for all of our

200
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,270
communication.

201
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:56,150
We don't use WhatsApp.

202
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,110
We don't use iMessage.

203
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:57,680
We don't use

204
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:58,969
Discord or anything.

205
00:03:58,969 --> 00:04:00,689
We do all of our comms on Slack.

206
00:04:00,689 --> 00:04:02,240
The reason why we use Slack is

207
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,300
because number one,

208
00:04:03,389 --> 00:04:04,150
it's professional.

209
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:05,219
Number two, the people in our

210
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:05,849
space use it.

211
00:04:05,849 --> 00:04:06,979
Since I'm using a tool that

212
00:04:06,979 --> 00:04:07,259
everybody

213
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,620
uses, we just get quicker client

214
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:09,250
responses.

215
00:04:09,259 --> 00:04:10,560
But let's say you're selling to

216
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,370
like roofers or something

217
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:13,229
for some reason.

218
00:04:13,229 --> 00:04:14,289
They don't use Slack.

219
00:04:14,289 --> 00:04:15,699
They use like iMessage if you're

220
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:16,920
selling to Americans.

221
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:18,069
So you need to adapt to sort of

222
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:19,290
what the market wants.

223
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:20,860
But the good thing with Slack is

224
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:21,639
it integrates

225
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:23,550
with all of the tools here pretty

226
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:25,430
much like Zapier, Make, like

227
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:27,750
Airtable works super well with it.

228
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:28,180
But if

229
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,300
we're using WhatsApp, we would

230
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,139
have some limitations.

231
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:31,180
And also I don't want to leak my

232
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:31,829
phone number to

233
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:32,839
everyone.

234
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:34,470
So Slack is the best.

235
00:04:34,569 --> 00:04:35,170
Next.

236
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:37,790
So for AI tools, we use ChatGPT.

237
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:39,560
We also use Claude and we

238
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:40,930
have a custom built AI tool as

239
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:41,319
well.

240
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:42,649
But these are super good.

241
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:44,180
I usually use ChatGPT for like

242
00:04:44,269 --> 00:04:44,519
more

243
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,069
basic tasks and stuff.

244
00:04:46,069 --> 00:04:47,839
Claude is better for writing

245
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:48,500
things.

246
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,129
And then next is Envato.

247
00:04:50,129 --> 00:04:51,420
Envato is a,

248
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:53,410
it has like no copyright music.

249
00:04:53,449 --> 00:04:55,519
And then it also has transitions,

250
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:57,879
effects, kind of stuff like that,

251
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:58,819
text presets.

252
00:04:58,819 --> 00:05:00,670
So our editors use Envato a lot.

253
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:02,639
We have a yearly plan with them.

254
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,180
And then Frame.io.

255
00:05:04,339 --> 00:05:05,870
So this one is super, super key

256
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:07,509
because we used to not use Frame

257
00:05:07,509 --> 00:05:09,350
and we were doing revisions on

258
00:05:09,459 --> 00:05:10,079
Google Drive.

259
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:11,269
It was very annoying because

260
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,720
basically like the editor would

261
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,709
send something to Google

262
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,319
Drive and then we would send a

263
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:17,139
Slack message with the timestamp

264
00:05:17,139 --> 00:05:19,149
saying, hey, at five seconds in,

265
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:20,310
change this word to that.

266
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:21,939
At two seconds in, change this to

267
00:05:21,939 --> 00:05:22,310
that.

268
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:23,879
And it was, it was very stupid.

269
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,230
To be honest with us, we should

270
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:26,329
have switched to Frame a lot

271
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:26,769
sooner.

272
00:05:26,899 --> 00:05:28,480
But on Frame, you can leave

273
00:05:28,579 --> 00:05:30,540
notes directly on the video.

274
00:05:30,629 --> 00:05:32,579
So it just works a lot better.

275
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:34,899
And then we use Frame for ready to

276
00:05:34,899 --> 00:05:35,170
post

277
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:36,730
videos, meaning when they're going

278
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:37,980
to get sent to clients and also

279
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:39,029
after they're edited.

280
00:05:39,029 --> 00:05:39,509
But for the

281
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,769
raw footage, we store that in

282
00:05:40,899 --> 00:05:42,259
Google Drive just because I have a

283
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:43,699
ton of storage for super, super

284
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,069
cheap.

285
00:05:44,069 --> 00:05:45,089
Yeah, it's just kind of more

286
00:05:45,189 --> 00:05:46,129
organized a little bit.

287
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,180
So we put our raw footage in

288
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:47,540
Google

289
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:47,899
Drive.

290
00:05:47,899 --> 00:05:49,120
That's where the clients upload

291
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:49,319
to.

292
00:05:49,329 --> 00:05:50,410
It's also just easier for the

293
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:52,100
clients to upload into a Google

294
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:53,180
Drive rather than a Frame.

295
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:53,930
It starts to get a bit

296
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:54,529
complicated.

297
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,759
And as soon as something is

298
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:56,040
uploaded

299
00:05:56,139 --> 00:05:57,410
into Google Drive, you know, the

300
00:05:57,529 --> 00:05:58,579
Zapier notifies us and then it

301
00:05:58,579 --> 00:06:00,139
gets assigned to a video editor by

302
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:00,410
our

303
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:01,339
project manager.

304
00:06:01,339 --> 00:06:02,600
So everything is super well

305
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,259
connected.

306
00:06:03,259 --> 00:06:04,790
Next, we use Google Docs just to

307
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:05,740
write our video

308
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:07,610
scripts on it and random notes.

309
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:09,209
And then we do use Discord.

310
00:06:09,209 --> 00:06:11,339
We literally just implemented this

311
00:06:11,339 --> 00:06:11,600
like

312
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:12,420
yesterday.

313
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:14,230
We're using Discord for editor

314
00:06:14,329 --> 00:06:16,149
trials because we used to manage

315
00:06:16,149 --> 00:06:17,879
them in Twitter DMs and then

316
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:19,240
we'd manage them on like Instagram

317
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:20,629
DMs and then we had Airtable.

318
00:06:20,629 --> 00:06:21,920
Things were kind of messy.

319
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,490
So now the

320
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,730
flow is like someone applies on

321
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:24,639
our Airtable form.

322
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:25,600
And then if we like their

323
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,899
portfolio, we send them a

324
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,399
one-time invite link into our

325
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:28,949
Discord.

326
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:30,560
And then they submit a ticket to

327
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,009
pick which type of editor they

328
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:32,290
are.

329
00:06:32,389 --> 00:06:33,629
And if they click the long form

330
00:06:33,629 --> 00:06:35,029
editor button, then it creates a

331
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:35,529
channel.

332
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:36,430
It'll have like first

333
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,370
name, last name, dash LF for long

334
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:38,819
form.

335
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:40,360
And then it'll have the trial

336
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,100
information in there to say,

337
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:43,730
hey, do XYZ, you know, edit this

338
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:44,699
one minute trial.

339
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:45,779
Here's the footage.

340
00:06:45,779 --> 00:06:46,920
Here's the script.

341
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,459
Here's all this

342
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:47,670
stuff.

343
00:06:47,769 --> 00:06:48,360
Let us know if you have any

344
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:48,740
questions.

345
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:49,529
And then from there, we have a

346
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:50,220
direct line of

347
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:51,319
communication with them.

348
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:52,459
The thing with editors is they

349
00:06:52,459 --> 00:06:53,329
like using Discord.

350
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:54,279
They're used to it.

351
00:06:54,379 --> 00:06:55,670
You know, we found that kind of

352
00:06:55,769 --> 00:06:57,100
putting them into Slack for the

353
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,550
trial process is kind of annoying.

354
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:00,170
And then we start to mix up like

355
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:02,029
trial editors and our real editors

356
00:07:02,029 --> 00:07:03,670
and the Slack keeps pinging.

357
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:04,879
So we just wanted to keep it

358
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:05,939
completely separate.

359
00:07:05,939 --> 00:07:07,360
I'll let you know how this goes,

360
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:07,870
but we literally

361
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,250
just implemented it like

362
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:10,069
yesterday.

363
00:07:10,069 --> 00:07:11,850
And then finally, we use Loom as

364
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:12,230
well.

365
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:13,560
So we use Loom for a lot of

366
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:14,120
things.

367
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,339
So I'm using Loom right now to

368
00:07:15,339 --> 00:07:16,259
record this video.

369
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:17,879
We use Loom for our internal SOPs.

370
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,939
We use Loom to request missing

371
00:07:19,949 --> 00:07:21,389
assets from clients.

372
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:23,589
It's basically a screen sharing

373
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:24,240
software,

374
00:07:24,339 --> 00:07:25,389
exactly as you're seeing right

375
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:25,610
now.

376
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:26,790
You can also connect to your

377
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:28,000
microphone and connect to your

378
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:28,519
camera.

379
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:29,689
So it's very good.

380
00:07:29,689 --> 00:07:31,189
We also use this to minimize

381
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,110
meetings because at the agency,

382
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,160
like we run with very, very, very

383
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:37,490
minimal meetings, even prospects.

384
00:07:37,579 --> 00:07:38,870
Like a lot of the times we just

385
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,350
close them in the DMs and just go

386
00:07:40,449 --> 00:07:41,740
back and forth with them.

387
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:43,569
So yeah, that's everything

388
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:44,699
software-wise.

389
00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:45,970
There might've been like one I

390
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,480
forgot, but I dig through my whole

391
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,050
thing, how we run all of our

392
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,269
operations, all our SOPs.

393
00:07:50,389 --> 00:07:51,759
We pretty much only use these.

394
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,069
So that's everything for this

395
00:07:53,069 --> 00:07:53,579
video.

396
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,730
If you want to know what my team

397
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:56,180
structure is like, or maybe you

398
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,279
want to learn about client

399
00:07:57,379 --> 00:07:58,889
acquisition, I have a ton of other

400
00:07:58,889 --> 00:08:00,149
videos on my channel that just

401
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:01,610
break down my seven figure

402
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,370
content agency.

403
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:03,620
I also have a free group linked in

404
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:04,850
the description with some free

405
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:05,680
resources for you

406
00:08:05,779 --> 00:08:06,000
guys.

407
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,589
So that's it.

408
00:08:06,589 --> 00:08:07,730
And I'll see you guys in the next

409
00:08:07,829 --> 00:08:08,110
video.

410
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:08,550
Peace.

411
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:09,600
Thank you.
