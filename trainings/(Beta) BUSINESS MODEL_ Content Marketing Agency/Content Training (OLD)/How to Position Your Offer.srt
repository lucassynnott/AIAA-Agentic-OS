1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:00,140
All right.

2
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:01,560
So the next video is going to be

3
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:03,390
about positioning your offers.

4
00:00:03,509 --> 00:00:04,040
There's multiple

5
00:00:04,089 --> 00:00:05,440
different types of offers you can

6
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,839
make as a content agency owner.

7
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:07,919
But the main thing to keep

8
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:09,419
in mind is just the ROI that we're

9
00:00:09,419 --> 00:00:10,039
pitching.

10
00:00:10,039 --> 00:00:11,539
So I actually already recorded a

11
00:00:11,539 --> 00:00:12,380
video on this,

12
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:13,400
so I'm going to cut to it.

13
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,529
But before I cut to it, I just

14
00:00:14,529 --> 00:00:15,960
want to give you guys some extra

15
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:17,399
context and information.

16
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:18,890
So the current offer we run with

17
00:00:19,059 --> 00:00:20,769
is we basically guarantee sales

18
00:00:20,769 --> 00:00:21,440
calls.

19
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:23,320
So there's a results triangle.

20
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:25,000
I mean, I know this isn't a

21
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:26,699
triangle in here, but you can like

22
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:28,370
imagine it being a triangle and

23
00:00:28,379 --> 00:00:29,660
guaranteeing money is the

24
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:31,399
strongest form of an offer.

25
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:31,949
Guaranteeing

26
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:33,140
clients is next and then sales

27
00:00:33,219 --> 00:00:34,670
calls after that and then leads.

28
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:35,820
It just gets weaker as you go

29
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:36,299
down.

30
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:37,340
We don't want to be as a content

31
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:38,520
agency saying, I'm going to make

32
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,899
you five videos or something like

33
00:00:39,929 --> 00:00:40,939
that or per month or four YouTube

34
00:00:40,939 --> 00:00:41,509
videos a month.

35
00:00:41,509 --> 00:00:42,579
No, you need to say, I'm going to

36
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,560
get you five

37
00:00:43,609 --> 00:00:44,159
clients a month.

38
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:45,329
I'm going to get you 10 to 30

39
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:45,859
calls a month.

40
00:00:45,859 --> 00:00:46,950
I'm going to make you 50K,

41
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:47,359
whatever

42
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:47,850
it might be.

43
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:48,820
I know you probably have some

44
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:49,880
predetermined thoughts about

45
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:50,539
having a guarantee

46
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:51,369
like you're scared you're not

47
00:00:51,369 --> 00:00:52,149
going to get results because

48
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:52,759
you're a beginner.

49
00:00:52,759 --> 00:00:53,340
Well, guess what?

50
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:53,439
You

51
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:54,439
have no social proof.

52
00:00:54,439 --> 00:00:55,740
So either you put on a guarantee

53
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:57,039
or you're going to outreach for

54
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:57,280
like

55
00:00:57,329 --> 00:00:58,759
12 months or something and not

56
00:00:58,759 --> 00:00:59,469
sign someone.

57
00:00:59,469 --> 00:01:00,939
Yes, you can sign someone without

58
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:01,630
a guarantee,

59
00:01:01,689 --> 00:01:02,700
but why would you want to make it

60
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:03,700
so much harder on yourself?

61
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:04,579
The reality is if you have a

62
00:01:04,579 --> 00:01:05,060
guarantee,

63
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:06,599
it's the difference between

64
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:08,769
signing 100 clients and refunding

65
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:10,579
one or two and signing only 20

66
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:10,950
clients.

67
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:12,299
You would have made an extra

68
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:13,290
million dollars.

69
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:14,760
So it's like you might as well do

70
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,180
it.

71
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:16,000
Who cares if

72
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:17,819
you refunded like a little $3,000?

73
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:19,239
It's worth the extra million.

74
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:21,340
So yeah, I'm going to cut to the

75
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:22,400
video now that goes over it.

76
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,159
And if you guys have any

77
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:24,459
questions, just let me know.

78
00:01:24,489 --> 00:01:25,370
What's up guys today.

79
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:26,569
We're going to be talking about

80
00:01:26,569 --> 00:01:26,989
offers.

81
00:01:26,989 --> 00:01:28,049
So when I started my content

82
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:28,519
agency,

83
00:01:28,549 --> 00:01:30,219
I had an offer where I was like,

84
00:01:30,219 --> 00:01:31,909
I'm going to repurpose your long

85
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:33,640
form videos into short form

86
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:34,129
videos.

87
00:01:34,129 --> 00:01:35,430
Now this was cool and it got my

88
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:36,879
foot in the door, but what ended

89
00:01:36,969 --> 00:01:38,150
up happening with the first

90
00:01:38,269 --> 00:01:39,750
person I closed is that I didn't

91
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,290
even close them necessarily on

92
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:41,989
that offer.

93
00:01:41,989 --> 00:01:43,120
I ended up closing them

94
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:44,689
on something else, but we'll get

95
00:01:44,709 --> 00:01:45,659
into that in a bit.

96
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:47,400
This exact offer strategy is how I

97
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,140
closed my first

98
00:01:48,189 --> 00:01:49,680
client within 23 days.

99
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,200
And it's also how I scaled it to

100
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:53,430
15 K a month within 90 days and

101
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:54,260
how I hit

102
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:56,840
93.5 K a month in 15 months.

103
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:59,180
And I hit 132 K a month in 25

104
00:01:59,269 --> 00:02:00,980
months from launching.

105
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:02,680
So today I'm

106
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:04,140
going to reveal everything related

107
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:04,810
to your offer.

108
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:06,040
The number one mistake that you

109
00:02:06,049 --> 00:02:07,120
are probably making

110
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:08,800
right now with your offer as a

111
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,689
video agency owner is you're not

112
00:02:10,689 --> 00:02:12,289
pitching an end result.

113
00:02:12,289 --> 00:02:14,629
So when you pitch

114
00:02:14,729 --> 00:02:17,129
people, they don't care about 30

115
00:02:17,129 --> 00:02:19,389
short form videos, they don't care

116
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:21,300
about freaking four long

117
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:21,830
form videos.

118
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:22,949
They don't care about your

119
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,090
repurposing their reels.

120
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:25,580
No, they care about what they're

121
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:25,800
going

122
00:02:25,849 --> 00:02:27,030
to get out of the videos.

123
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,490
Even if they're paying you for a

124
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,110
simple, simple service, such as

125
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:30,699
editing,

126
00:02:30,729 --> 00:02:32,330
you need to think to yourself, why

127
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,919
is this person giving me money?

128
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:35,360
And they're giving you money

129
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,819
because they want to make more

130
00:02:36,819 --> 00:02:37,960
money out of it, right?

131
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,729
They're thinking of your service

132
00:02:39,789 --> 00:02:40,259
as an

133
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:40,789
investment.

134
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,050
So if you're not pitching it that

135
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:43,379
way, you're not pitching straight

136
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:44,349
to their desires.

137
00:02:44,389 --> 00:02:46,039
And if you're not pitching to what

138
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:47,719
somebody wants, you're going to

139
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:48,710
make less money.

140
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:49,560
Because imagine

141
00:02:49,629 --> 00:02:51,729
somebody wants to buy carrots, and

142
00:02:51,729 --> 00:02:53,719
then you start talking about like

143
00:02:53,719 --> 00:02:55,509
the green leaf part on the top

144
00:02:55,569 --> 00:02:56,719
of the carrot, right?

145
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,409
You're not pitching them what they

146
00:02:58,409 --> 00:03:00,039
want, but rather you need to pitch

147
00:03:00,129 --> 00:03:00,819
what they want,

148
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:01,900
which is the carrots.

149
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,229
That was a really funny random

150
00:03:03,229 --> 00:03:04,610
example that I just came up with

151
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:05,319
on the fly.

152
00:03:05,969 --> 00:03:07,099
But I digress.

153
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:09,530
So the main thing people want is

154
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:10,250
money.

155
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:13,030
If you're pitching a service-based

156
00:03:13,099 --> 00:03:13,360
business

157
00:03:13,389 --> 00:03:14,689
or an online coach, you know,

158
00:03:14,689 --> 00:03:15,719
people want clients.

159
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:17,139
So you can guarantee, hey, I'll

160
00:03:17,139 --> 00:03:18,069
get you this amount

161
00:03:18,129 --> 00:03:19,219
of clients per month.

162
00:03:19,229 --> 00:03:20,590
Or you can say you'll get them

163
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:22,000
this amount of sales calls.

164
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,719
Or you can say

165
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:25,150
you'll get them this many views as

166
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:25,639
well.

167
00:03:25,819 --> 00:03:28,009
There's basically a ranking,

168
00:03:28,009 --> 00:03:28,699
right?

169
00:03:28,699 --> 00:03:30,319
The higher up you go on

170
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:31,770
the circle, which is more

171
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:33,659
aggressive of a claim, or I should

172
00:03:33,669 --> 00:03:34,800
say the triangle.

173
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,979
The higher up you go on

174
00:03:36,009 --> 00:03:37,169
the triangle, the easier it's

175
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,180
going to be to sign clients

176
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:39,219
because you're making a more

177
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:39,840
aggressive

178
00:03:39,889 --> 00:03:40,370
claim.

179
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,639
So all the way at the top, we have

180
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,550
pitching clients and are just

181
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:46,599
guaranteeing money, actually.

182
00:03:46,629 --> 00:03:47,680
Like you say, hey, I'm going to

183
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,340
make you $50,000 basically, or you

184
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:50,159
don't pay, right?

185
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:51,310
That's going to

186
00:03:51,409 --> 00:03:52,879
be the easiest thing to sell

187
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,620
because you're pitching as close

188
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:56,039
as you can to the person's

189
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:56,819
desires.

190
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:57,080
They want

191
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:57,789
to make money.

192
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,439
And the next one level down, which

193
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:00,990
is pretty much equal to money, to

194
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:02,000
be honest, is you

195
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:03,419
say, hey, I'm going to give you

196
00:04:03,419 --> 00:04:04,789
this amount of clients through

197
00:04:04,789 --> 00:04:06,319
Instagram, through YouTube,

198
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:06,530
through

199
00:04:06,629 --> 00:04:08,150
whatever, through whatever type of

200
00:04:08,169 --> 00:04:08,620
system.

201
00:04:08,669 --> 00:04:09,960
And then one level down from that

202
00:04:09,969 --> 00:04:11,240
is you're going to get them

203
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:12,729
qualified sales calls.

204
00:04:12,729 --> 00:04:14,159
And then one level down from

205
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:16,160
qualified sales calls is leads.

206
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:17,019
I don't ever

207
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:19,199
recommend anybody guarantees

208
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:19,870
leads.

209
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:22,120
And then one level below leads is

210
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:22,790
views.

211
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:25,019
So with views, I'm not a big

212
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:26,189
fan anymore of like telling

213
00:04:26,189 --> 00:04:27,600
people, hey, you're going to get

214
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,779
this amount of views.

215
00:04:28,779 --> 00:04:29,860
It's just a

216
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:30,860
personal preference thing.

217
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:31,779
Because at the end of the day,

218
00:04:31,949 --> 00:04:32,779
there are people who want views.

219
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:33,250
There's

220
00:04:33,329 --> 00:04:34,399
people who are like, hey, I just

221
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:35,639
want to make, I want to get 100

222
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:36,819
million views a month, or I want

223
00:04:36,819 --> 00:04:36,879
to

224
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:38,660
get 50 million views a month or

225
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:39,329
whatever.

226
00:04:39,329 --> 00:04:40,779
And we have clients who we've

227
00:04:40,779 --> 00:04:42,360
gotten millions of views for

228
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:43,740
before, and they're really happy

229
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:44,449
with the views.

230
00:04:44,449 --> 00:04:45,699
Also, as a result of the views,

231
00:04:45,709 --> 00:04:46,560
though, they're making

232
00:04:46,629 --> 00:04:47,110
money.

233
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,079
And the real thing they wanted to

234
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:51,209
get by getting the views is money.

235
00:04:51,209 --> 00:04:52,839
So I prefer just pitching

236
00:04:52,889 --> 00:04:54,259
closer to money, if that makes

237
00:04:54,259 --> 00:04:54,660
sense.

238
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,230
So you can definitely pitch views,

239
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:57,459
nothing wrong with it.

240
00:04:57,459 --> 00:04:57,550
I

241
00:04:57,649 --> 00:04:58,889
just like going a bit higher up

242
00:04:58,889 --> 00:04:59,420
than that.

243
00:04:59,689 --> 00:05:00,819
Because why do they want views to

244
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:01,759
make more money?

245
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:02,529
And then

246
00:05:02,649 --> 00:05:04,769
next, underneath views, we have

247
00:05:04,769 --> 00:05:06,339
just pitching the actual

248
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:08,569
deliverable, meaning, hey, I'm

249
00:05:08,569 --> 00:05:09,279
going to get

250
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:11,100
you 30 videos a month, I'm going

251
00:05:11,329 --> 00:05:12,949
to give you four videos a month.

252
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:14,639
The problem with pitching the

253
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:16,209
deliverable is now you're like a

254
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:17,980
really cheap commodity, you don't

255
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:19,350
know how to make money from

256
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:19,779
videos,

257
00:05:19,829 --> 00:05:22,110
and you're going to get lowball

258
00:05:22,129 --> 00:05:23,540
down to shreds.

259
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:24,290
It's much, much better to go

260
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:25,819
higher up on the

261
00:05:25,889 --> 00:05:26,449
triangle.

262
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:28,759
So when you apply this principle,

263
00:05:28,939 --> 00:05:30,930
and you figure out what you're

264
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,459
going to offer people,

265
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:33,470
you need to put it into a

266
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:34,060
sentence.

267
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,379
And what this sentence typically

268
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,339
looks like is I'm going to get

269
00:05:37,389 --> 00:05:39,160
you XYZ end result in ABC

270
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:41,839
timeframe, or you don't pay.

271
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:44,660
So essentially, it's like, I'm

272
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:45,639
going to give you

273
00:05:45,689 --> 00:05:47,160
this result, you put the result

274
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,560
there, you can also say through

275
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:50,079
the name of the mechanism.

276
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:50,740
So

277
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:52,560
let's put this into into an actual

278
00:05:52,829 --> 00:05:53,300
sentence.

279
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:55,350
So it'd be like, we'll get you 10

280
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:56,959
to 30 qualified sales

281
00:05:57,009 --> 00:05:58,639
calls per month, through YouTube

282
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,199
sales funnel, or you don't pay.

283
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:02,000
The YouTube sales funnel part is

284
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,139
like

285
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:03,079
the unique mechanism.

286
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:04,100
Try and come up with your own

287
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:04,449
thing.

288
00:06:04,449 --> 00:06:05,699
Don't just rip other people.

289
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:06,800
I don't use this

290
00:06:06,889 --> 00:06:07,560
offer anymore.

291
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,069
I went like even higher up on the

292
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:09,670
triangle.

293
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:11,339
So I'm just using this as example

294
00:06:11,339 --> 00:06:11,759
purposes

295
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:12,980
for the video.

296
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:15,579
And you can apply the same concept

297
00:06:15,579 --> 00:06:17,509
to any business, right?

298
00:06:17,509 --> 00:06:18,660
It's just we'll get you this

299
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:19,649
end result and you have to

300
00:06:19,649 --> 00:06:20,269
guarantee it.

301
00:06:20,269 --> 00:06:21,240
Now I know you're probably

302
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,620
thinking, oh, Eamon, why do I have

303
00:06:22,709 --> 00:06:24,079
to do a guarantee?

304
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:26,379
You know, it's scary or all these

305
00:06:26,389 --> 00:06:27,720
types of things.

306
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,019
So if you have no social proof or

307
00:06:30,019 --> 00:06:30,160
a

308
00:06:30,209 --> 00:06:32,290
very low amount of social proof or

309
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:34,360
you're new in the scene, you need

310
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:36,439
a guarantee and or I don't want to

311
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:37,600
use the word you need it because

312
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,850
frankly, you don't you can still

313
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:40,110
get by without a guarantee.

314
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:40,920
But it just

315
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:42,129
comes down to how much money you

316
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,379
want to make and how quickly you

317
00:06:43,379 --> 00:06:44,160
want to make it.

318
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:44,819
Because if you have

319
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:46,329
a guarantee, it's five times

320
00:06:46,329 --> 00:06:47,949
easier to get people on the phone

321
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:49,480
and getting people on the phone

322
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:49,839
with

323
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:50,970
you on a sales call is the hardest

324
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:51,279
part.

325
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:52,300
And then once you get them on a

326
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,459
sales call, you just have to

327
00:06:53,509 --> 00:06:55,610
close them and the guarantee will

328
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:56,680
help you a lot.

329
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,660
And your refund rate will be low

330
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:00,000
because with content

331
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:01,170
nowadays, if you know what you're

332
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,259
doing and you know how to make the

333
00:07:02,259 --> 00:07:03,579
right videos and come up with good

334
00:07:03,629 --> 00:07:06,129
ideas and structure videos, you

335
00:07:06,139 --> 00:07:08,089
can get people results.

336
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:10,689
And as long as you're doing a good

337
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:11,040
service

338
00:07:11,069 --> 00:07:12,430
for people, your refund rate is

339
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:13,620
going to be extremely low.

340
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:14,889
And when you look at it, like

341
00:07:14,889 --> 00:07:15,459
let's say you

342
00:07:15,509 --> 00:07:17,569
have a guarantee, you sign 100

343
00:07:17,569 --> 00:07:19,360
agency clients and you refund one

344
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:21,310
versus if you had no guarantee,

345
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:23,139
but you would have only signed 10

346
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:24,970
clients, you refunded zero, but

347
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,230
you missed out on the other 90

348
00:07:27,259 --> 00:07:27,740
clients

349
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:28,279
or so.

350
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:29,889
So that's sort of the visual I

351
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:31,629
want you to paint in your head,

352
00:07:31,629 --> 00:07:33,560
even if your refund rate was as

353
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,100
high as

354
00:07:34,129 --> 00:07:35,920
you know, you sign 100 clients and

355
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,180
you refunded 30, like you still

356
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,800
would have made more.

357
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,420
And yeah, you would

358
00:07:41,449 --> 00:07:42,279
have made more than that.

359
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:43,240
I know some people in the comments

360
00:07:43,449 --> 00:07:44,250
can be like, Oh, but you have

361
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:44,810
higher costs

362
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:46,339
because you still fulfilled for

363
00:07:46,339 --> 00:07:47,810
those people refunded for you'll

364
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:49,220
still have made more than the

365
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:49,920
people who had

366
00:07:49,949 --> 00:07:50,769
no guarantee.

367
00:07:50,769 --> 00:07:52,500
It's literally such a no brainer.

368
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,129
Way later on, like once you you

369
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,879
get more money, like sure, maybe

370
00:07:55,879 --> 00:07:55,959
you

371
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:57,980
can remove it, but it's best to

372
00:07:58,089 --> 00:07:59,819
just put all the cards in your

373
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:02,850
favor and actually do like what's

374
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:02,860
going

375
00:08:03,009 --> 00:08:05,769
to make you the most money now.

376
00:08:05,769 --> 00:08:07,750
So that's most of the stuff I

377
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,610
wanted to say about offers.

378
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:10,160
Let me just

379
00:08:10,209 --> 00:08:11,480
think if there's anything I

380
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:11,980
missed.

381
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:13,500
One other thing is the language

382
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,079
you use in your offer should be

383
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:15,360
easy

384
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:17,199
to understand by your target

385
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:18,529
demographic.

386
00:08:18,529 --> 00:08:20,759
So let's say you're working with

387
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:23,610
like personal injury lawyers,

388
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:24,149
right?

389
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:26,199
They don't use the word clients,

390
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,279
like rather they use cases like,

391
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:29,860
Oh, how many new cases do we

392
00:08:29,889 --> 00:08:30,930
get per month or whatever?

393
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:32,038
So you want to make sure you're

394
00:08:32,038 --> 00:08:33,250
using specific language that your

395
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:33,740
target

396
00:08:33,769 --> 00:08:35,460
demographic would understand

397
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:36,658
inside of your offer.

398
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,559
If financial advisors have this

399
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,779
specific term, like

400
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:41,580
they say accounts or something, or

401
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:43,168
they say there's a specific term

402
00:08:43,288 --> 00:08:43,798
for them.

403
00:08:43,798 --> 00:08:44,710
It's like AUM.

404
00:08:44,789 --> 00:08:45,690
It means

405
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,470
like how much total money they're

406
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:48,169
managing.

407
00:08:48,169 --> 00:08:49,370
You use those terms.

408
00:08:49,419 --> 00:08:50,620
So whatever your target

409
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:51,139
demographic

410
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:52,470
cares about in the specific

411
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:54,070
vocabulary as well, you use it and

412
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,269
do the same thing in your

413
00:08:55,269 --> 00:08:56,059
marketing as

414
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:56,559
well.

415
00:08:56,559 --> 00:08:57,960
You need to use the language that

416
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:59,809
your prospects will understand

417
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,480
because this is instantly going to

418
00:09:01,509 --> 00:09:02,750
make you look like, you know how

419
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:03,840
to work with their niche.

420
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,210
Like if you're pitching financial

421
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:05,679
advisors

422
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:06,549
and you're, you're using the

423
00:09:06,549 --> 00:09:07,460
language they use on a day-to-day

424
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:08,580
basis, they're going to be like,

425
00:09:08,669 --> 00:09:10,409
okay, this guy, he's in the world

426
00:09:10,409 --> 00:09:11,539
of financial advisors.

427
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,059
He's not just some random Joe

428
00:09:13,059 --> 00:09:13,659
Schmo.

429
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:15,220
Let me go and work with him.

430
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:16,460
Make sure you're pitching an end

431
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:17,840
result because nobody buys videos

432
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:19,059
to buy videos unless it's a

433
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,080
passion project.

434
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,389
And those are just one-offs

435
00:09:21,389 --> 00:09:23,649
anyways, but nobody buys

436
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:24,970
videos just to buy videos.

437
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:26,389
They buy videos to make money or

438
00:09:26,389 --> 00:09:28,320
at least 99.9% of your customers

439
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:28,759
will

440
00:09:28,809 --> 00:09:29,889
have that intention.

441
00:09:29,899 --> 00:09:31,080
So you might as well speak

442
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,659
directly to their desires because

443
00:09:32,769 --> 00:09:33,419
you will make

444
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:34,720
more money doing so.

445
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,019
I have a free group in the

446
00:09:36,139 --> 00:09:37,919
description with a free course as

447
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:38,559
well that I'm

448
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:39,049
cooking up.

449
00:09:39,049 --> 00:09:40,059
There's a ton of free videos in

450
00:09:40,059 --> 00:09:41,240
there already, but I'm cooking up

451
00:09:41,259 --> 00:09:42,139
a free course right now.

452
00:09:42,169 --> 00:09:43,440
And then if you want to work with

453
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,940

454
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,480

455

Peace out.
