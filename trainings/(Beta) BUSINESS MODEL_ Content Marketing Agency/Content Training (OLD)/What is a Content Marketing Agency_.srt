1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:00,250
All right, guys.

2
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:01,110
So in this video, we're going to

3
00:00:01,189 --> 00:00:02,140
talk about what is a content

4
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:02,529
agency.

5
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:02,759
If you

6
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:03,620
already know what this is, feel

7
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:04,089
free to skip it.

8
00:00:04,089 --> 00:00:04,910
But I mean, this video is going to

9
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:05,480
be like six

10
00:00:05,509 --> 00:00:06,240
minutes long.

11
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,629
I actually already have a video

12
00:00:07,669 --> 00:00:09,070
recorded that goes exactly over

13
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:09,500
this.

14
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:10,070
I recorded

15
00:00:10,119 --> 00:00:10,919
it in a podcast studio.

16
00:00:10,919 --> 00:00:11,839
It's super, super nice.

17
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:12,919
So I'm actually just going to cut

18
00:00:12,919 --> 00:00:13,509
to that instead

19
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:14,650
of just repeating myself, it's

20
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:15,910
going to be a lot more efficient.

21
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:17,079
I made sure to go super in-depth.

22
00:00:17,109 --> 00:00:18,280
So here it is.

23
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,699
A content agency can generate

24
00:00:19,699 --> 00:00:22,670
$30,000 to $40,000 per month with

25
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:23,320
just a handful

26
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:24,100
of clients.

27
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:26,410
In fact, I went from zero to 93.5K

28
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:28,260
a month in 15 months with my own

29
00:00:28,329 --> 00:00:29,519
content agency.

30
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:30,719
But here's the thing.

31
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:32,219
Most people have no idea what a

32
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:34,140
content agency actually is or how

33
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:34,539
it works.

34
00:00:34,579 --> 00:00:35,820
So in this video, I'm going to

35
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,270
break down exactly what a content

36
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:38,820
agency does, how it makes money,

37
00:00:38,859 --> 00:00:39,909
and why it's the perfect online

38
00:00:40,009 --> 00:00:41,179
business model for beginners in

39
00:00:41,179 --> 00:00:41,909
2025.

40
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,359
So to start a content agency,

41
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:44,530
most people think this is just a

42
00:00:44,549 --> 00:00:45,789
video editing business, but that

43
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:46,789
couldn't be further from

44
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:47,420
the truth.

45
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:48,859
I know many content agency owners

46
00:00:48,869 --> 00:00:50,200
who don't know how to edit at all

47
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:50,939
themselves,

48
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:52,229
but what they do know how to do is

49
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,670
hire video editors to handle that

50
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:54,960
segment of the workload.

51
00:00:55,009 --> 00:00:56,340
But you never want to only offer

52
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:57,130
video editing.

53
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:58,340
You always want to add other

54
00:00:58,340 --> 00:00:59,000
things on top

55
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:00,439
so you can promise an ROI to your

56
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:00,979
clients.

57
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:02,079
ROI stands for return on

58
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:02,840
investment.

59
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:03,140
Because if

60
00:01:03,179 --> 00:01:04,109
you're only doing the video

61
00:01:04,109 --> 00:01:05,250
editing, you can't go up to your

62
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:06,459
client and say, I'm going to get

63
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:07,469
you 30 sales calls a month.

64
00:01:07,469 --> 00:01:08,519
You're going to close five clients

65
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:09,299
every single month.

66
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:10,459
You can't do that.

67
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,700
So what you need to add on top of

68
00:01:11,709 --> 00:01:12,870
the editing is strategy.

69
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:14,420
Now this applies if you're selling

70
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:15,969
Instagram reels, YouTube videos,

71
00:01:15,969 --> 00:01:17,040
but you need to be the one who

72
00:01:17,129 --> 00:01:18,400
comes up with the ideas and the

73
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:19,500
strategy for your clients.

74
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:20,829
And you need to write the scripts.

75
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:21,959
On top of that, you should be

76
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:22,120
doing

77
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:23,430
the thumbnail, the SEO, and the

78
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:23,920
posting.

79
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,189
So this way you control all of the

80
00:01:25,189 --> 00:01:25,920
variables.

81
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,530
So you'll be

82
00:01:26,569 --> 00:01:27,819
able to promise an ROI for your

83
00:01:27,829 --> 00:01:28,349
clients.

84
00:01:28,349 --> 00:01:29,760
So just to recap, you're not only

85
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:30,959
video editing, you're

86
00:01:30,989 --> 00:01:32,459
basically a content strategist.

87
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:33,709
In a nutshell, what you'll be

88
00:01:33,709 --> 00:01:35,079
doing is selling videos to other

89
00:01:35,109 --> 00:01:35,620
businesses.

90
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:36,599
You'll be able to get them on a

91
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:37,879
monthly retainer, meaning they'll

92
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:38,780
pay you anywhere from

93
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:41,090
2000 to $6,000 every single month.

94
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:42,359
And in return, you'll make them

95
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:43,459
four videos a month.

96
00:01:43,459 --> 00:01:43,719
You'll make

97
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:45,109
them four YouTube videos, 30

98
00:01:45,109 --> 00:01:46,500
reels, whatever you structure the

99
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:46,980
deal as.

100
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:48,319
The way that I run my content

101
00:01:48,349 --> 00:01:49,620
agency TickScale is that I've

102
00:01:49,629 --> 00:01:51,159
never ever done an in-person shoot

103
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:51,849
for a client.

104
00:01:51,849 --> 00:01:52,819
Whenever I sign a

105
00:01:52,849 --> 00:01:54,219
client, I send them a video that

106
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:55,650
tells them exactly how to record

107
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:57,159
from the comfort of their own home

108
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,459
using just their iPhone and a

109
00:01:58,459 --> 00:01:58,810
laptop.

110
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,109
I know a couple guys that run

111
00:02:00,109 --> 00:02:01,349
content agencies where they're

112
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:02,159
shooting in person.

113
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:02,969
Every other week on their

114
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:04,310
Instagram story, they're flying to

115
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:04,810
this place,

116
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:05,760
flying to that place.

117
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,909
And that's not the type of life I

118
00:02:06,909 --> 00:02:07,480
want to have.

119
00:02:07,569 --> 00:02:08,699
Not that I don't like travel,

120
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:09,750
but I don't want to be forced to

121
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:10,288
go somewhere.

122
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,419
I want to go there by choice.

123
00:02:11,419 --> 00:02:12,289
It's also just going to

124
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:13,150
ruin your schedule.

125
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:14,310
So just to make it super clear,

126
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:15,240
you don't need expensive

127
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:15,819
equipment.

128
00:02:15,819 --> 00:02:16,419
In fact,

129
00:02:16,449 --> 00:02:17,699
your clients will be covering any

130
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:18,500
equipment costs.

131
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,949
Now with a content agency, there's

132
00:02:19,949 --> 00:02:20,139
many

133
00:02:20,169 --> 00:02:21,169
directions you can go in.

134
00:02:21,169 --> 00:02:22,300
You can sell YouTube videos.

135
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:23,659
You can sell Instagram reels.

136
00:02:23,659 --> 00:02:24,280
You can

137
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,560
sell video sales letters.

138
00:02:25,569 --> 00:02:26,840
You can sell ad creatives.

139
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,879
The list goes on and on.

140
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:28,860
A lot of beginners get

141
00:02:28,889 --> 00:02:29,949
hung up on which type of video

142
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,020
they should be offering.

143
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:32,270
But instead of having analysis

144
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:32,860
paralysis,

145
00:02:32,889 --> 00:02:34,449
what you should understand is that

146
00:02:34,449 --> 00:02:35,870
people aren't paying you for an

147
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:37,479
Instagram reel or a YouTube video

148
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,259
or an ad creative.

149
00:02:38,259 --> 00:02:39,419
They're paying you for a result

150
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:40,729
and they don't actually care what

151
00:02:40,729 --> 00:02:41,300
type of video

152
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:42,520
gets them that result as long as

153
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,080
they get it.

154
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,389
Now that you guys understand what

155
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,430
a content agency is,

156
00:02:45,569 --> 00:02:46,780
I'm going to go into how you can

157
00:02:46,789 --> 00:02:48,159
get your first or next client.

158
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,289
So there's two tiers of

159
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:50,370
clients you can work with.

160
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:51,439
The first tier is composed of

161
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:52,729
business owners who pretty much

162
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:52,879
have

163
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:53,650
no content online.

164
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:54,770
They're coming to you starting

165
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:55,879
from scratch and they need help

166
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:56,620
building from the

167
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:57,139
ground up.

168
00:02:57,139 --> 00:02:58,210
We'll call that section of the

169
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,050
market tier one.

170
00:02:59,129 --> 00:03:00,639
They're easier to sign, but they

171
00:03:00,659 --> 00:03:00,939
typically

172
00:03:00,969 --> 00:03:02,340
pay less and stick around for less

173
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:02,689
time.

174
00:03:02,689 --> 00:03:03,990
On the other hand, we have tier

175
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:04,289
two.

176
00:03:04,289 --> 00:03:05,229
This is composed of

177
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:06,409
business owners who already have a

178
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:07,060
personal brand.

179
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,259
They're already posting and they

180
00:03:08,259 --> 00:03:08,340
don't

181
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:09,680
necessarily have to be famous, but

182
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,969
they already have that momentum.

183
00:03:10,969 --> 00:03:11,819
And then when they start

184
00:03:11,849 --> 00:03:12,919
working with you, it's like

185
00:03:13,009 --> 00:03:13,969
pouring oil on the fire.

186
00:03:13,969 --> 00:03:15,360
Tier two clients will pay you more

187
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:15,639
and they'll

188
00:03:15,669 --> 00:03:16,669
stick around for longer because

189
00:03:16,669 --> 00:03:17,710
you'll be able to get them results

190
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:18,159
quicker.

191
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:19,000
So if you're more of a

192
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,060
beginner, you want to start

193
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,159
pushing towards those tier one

194
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,379
people and then work your way up

195
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:22,770
towards

196
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:23,180
tier two.

197
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:24,229
But if you're watching this and

198
00:03:24,229 --> 00:03:25,400
you're already experienced, you

199
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:26,370
should try and focus as

200
00:03:26,469 --> 00:03:27,530
much of your attention towards

201
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:28,449
those tier two clients.

202
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:29,479
Now, in terms of how much you

203
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:29,960
should be

204
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:31,060
charging, when you're starting

205
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:32,110
out, you want to go on the lower

206
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,219
end of the spectrum, which is

207
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:33,389
usually

208
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:35,620
1.5K a month, 2K a month, 2.5,

209
00:03:35,699 --> 00:03:36,979
somewhere in that range.

210
00:03:36,979 --> 00:03:38,400
And then over time, as you get

211
00:03:38,469 --> 00:03:38,580
more

212
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:39,819
experience, you can add more and

213
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:40,979
more money to your retainer.

214
00:03:40,979 --> 00:03:42,099
What I did is for every two

215
00:03:42,099 --> 00:03:42,419
clients

216
00:03:42,449 --> 00:03:44,009
I closed, I added an extra 250

217
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,770
bucks to 500 bucks a month to my

218
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:46,349
retainer.

219
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,319
Now, on average,

220
00:03:47,349 --> 00:03:49,090
our clients pay us $3,500 every

221
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:49,750
single month.

222
00:03:49,819 --> 00:03:51,000
We've had clients pay us up to

223
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,199
$8,000, $9,000 a month,

224
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,189
but those are just a couple of

225
00:03:54,189 --> 00:03:55,129
needles in the haystack.

226
00:03:55,129 --> 00:03:57,039
For the most part, we make 3,500 a

227
00:03:57,039 --> 00:03:57,439
month per

228
00:03:57,469 --> 00:03:57,860
client.

229
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:59,310
So basically, since we're charging

230
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:00,530
such a high ticket price point,

231
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:01,780
all you need is three or four

232
00:04:01,849 --> 00:04:03,099
clients and you'll be making 10K a

233
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:03,409
month.

234
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:04,439
In terms of the profit margin,

235
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:05,699
you're typically looking at

236
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,530
anywhere from 75% to 80% when

237
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:09,110
you're at those revenue levels,

238
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:10,819
but as you scale, it'll start to

239
00:04:10,819 --> 00:04:10,919
dip

240
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:13,069
towards 75%, 70%, and 65%.

241
00:04:13,069 --> 00:04:14,590
The good thing with this business

242
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:16,120
model is that similarly to your

243
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:16,540
clients,

244
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:17,779
you don't actually need that much

245
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:18,689
equipment yourself.

246
00:04:18,689 --> 00:04:19,889
All you need is your phone, your

247
00:04:19,889 --> 00:04:20,339
laptop,

248
00:04:20,379 --> 00:04:21,310
and a Wi-Fi connection.

249
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:22,420
You can run this business from

250
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:23,350
anywhere in the world.

251
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:24,360
In fact, I just moved to

252
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:25,810
Dubai at 19 years old and clients

253
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:26,949
were paying me while I was on my

254
00:04:26,949 --> 00:04:27,970
business class flight.

255
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:28,720
The one thing

256
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,310
that most people don't know about

257
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,730
this business model is that you

258
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,120
can use AI to do most of the work.

259
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,029
It can help you with client

260
00:04:34,029 --> 00:04:35,079
acquisition and it'll help you

261
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:35,920
with fulfillment.

262
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,319
I developed a custom AI

263
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:38,819
tool that we use to come up with

264
00:04:38,819 --> 00:04:40,579
video ideas, content strategies,

265
00:04:40,629 --> 00:04:42,029
and write video scripts for

266
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:42,639
our clients.

267
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:43,850
We've been using it for over four

268
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:45,149
months now and client results have

269
00:04:45,149 --> 00:04:45,899
never been better.

270
00:04:45,899 --> 00:04:46,180
On

271
00:04:46,209 --> 00:04:47,439
top of that, it just gives us more

272
00:04:47,449 --> 00:04:48,779
bandwidth to bring on more clients

273
00:04:48,779 --> 00:04:50,360
without having to hire more people

274
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:51,560
and bring down our profit margin.

275
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,670
I don't know about you guys, but I

276
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,720
don't want to run a business

277
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,860
that has 50 employees, 30% profit

278
00:04:55,959 --> 00:04:56,480
margin.

279
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,980
I want to run a lean machine.

280
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:59,339
The next thing I want to talk

281
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:00,310
about is how far you can scale

282
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:01,470
this because there's two types of

283
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:02,129
people, right?

284
00:05:02,129 --> 00:05:02,550
Some people

285
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:04,310
only want to make 5k a month, 10k

286
00:05:04,339 --> 00:05:05,730
a month, replace their income,

287
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:06,660
maybe 3k a month.

288
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,480
But then there's

289
00:05:07,509 --> 00:05:09,069
other people like me who just push

290
00:05:09,069 --> 00:05:09,910
this to the max.

291
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:12,040
So I scaled to 93.5k a month in 15

292
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:12,620
months,

293
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:13,589
and I did this as a complete

294
00:05:13,589 --> 00:05:14,079
beginner.

295
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:15,339
In fact, as I'm recording this,

296
00:05:15,339 --> 00:05:16,550
there's still eight more days

297
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,850
to go for this month, and we're

298
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,459
already at 86k cash collected.

299
00:05:19,459 --> 00:05:20,970
Inshallah, this will be our first

300
00:05:21,019 --> 00:05:22,189
six-figure month from the agency

301
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:22,540
alone.

302
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:23,500
As you scale up to my level,

303
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:24,579
you're going to need to get an

304
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:26,230
operations manager, a copywriter,

305
00:05:26,339 --> 00:05:27,540
and a video quality checker.

306
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:28,459
On top of that, you're going

307
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,569
to need systems and automations to

308
00:05:29,649 --> 00:05:30,800
keep track of everything, or else

309
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,670
you're going to get lost

310
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:32,910
because there's so many videos.

311
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:33,949
But I have it so dialed in to the

312
00:05:33,949 --> 00:05:35,129
point where I don't even have to

313
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,259
be there and my business is still

314
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:36,769
going to run.

315
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:37,910
It's always good to keep your eyes

316
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:38,579
peeled and still

317
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:39,180
stay involved.

318
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:39,889
So that's what I do.

319
00:05:39,899 --> 00:05:40,939
But it's a good feeling knowing

320
00:05:40,939 --> 00:05:42,170
that you could disappear for two

321
00:05:42,269 --> 00:05:43,310
weeks and your business is still

322
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:44,399
running and still making money and

323
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,420
your clients are happy.

324
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:45,839
Now let's

325
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:46,639
backtrack a little bit.

326
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:47,519
Let's talk about what type of

327
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:48,439
clients you should be working

328
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:48,800
with.

329
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,439
So in theory,

330
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:50,800
you could actually work with any

331
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,319
type of business, but I personally

332
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:53,579
prefer working with online

333
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:54,000
businesses.

334
00:05:54,029 --> 00:05:55,439
This is because no matter what

335
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:57,209
country my video ends up reaching,

336
00:05:57,279 --> 00:05:58,899
they can sell to people in that

337
00:05:58,930 --> 00:05:59,430
country.

338
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:00,790
However, if my client was a car

339
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:02,310
dealership, if I make them a video

340
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:03,810
and it gets 2 million views,

341
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:05,889
maybe only 20,000 of those views

342
00:06:05,889 --> 00:06:07,139
were in their local area.

343
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:08,620
So really this is maxing out the

344
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:08,980
potential

345
00:06:09,009 --> 00:06:10,189
result that our clients can get,

346
00:06:10,189 --> 00:06:11,410
meaning they'll stick around for

347
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:11,800
longer.

348
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,569
And in terms of how we

349
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:13,879
actually land these clients, we

350
00:06:13,889 --> 00:06:15,069
use the golden bullet method.

351
00:06:15,149 --> 00:06:16,339
This is basically where you send

352
00:06:16,339 --> 00:06:16,480
out

353
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:17,439
five messages a day.

354
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:18,810
You heard that right, just five

355
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:19,569
messages a day.

356
00:06:19,569 --> 00:06:20,620
And in each message,

357
00:06:20,649 --> 00:06:21,980
you send a piece of free work and

358
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,399
you only reach out to businesses

359
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:24,800
that you actually want to work

360
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:25,060
with.

361
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,209
Like these need to be your dream

362
00:06:26,209 --> 00:06:26,639
clients.

363
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:27,879
For the piece of free work, you

364
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:28,699
can use AI to help

365
00:06:28,779 --> 00:06:29,129
you out.

366
00:06:29,129 --> 00:06:30,329
So it's not that time consuming.

367
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:31,720
The reason why this works so well,

368
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,670
and it allowed me to scale

369
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,399
up to 90 grand a month at just 19

370
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:36,029
years old in 15 months is because

371
00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:37,379
you're going to stand out from

372
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:38,019
the crowd.

373
00:06:38,029 --> 00:06:39,790
Everybody's just copy pasting DMS

374
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:41,160
using crazy mass cold email

375
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:42,480
sending software and

376
00:06:42,509 --> 00:06:43,589
overall nothing's personalized.

377
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:44,829
But with the golden bullet method,

378
00:06:44,829 --> 00:06:46,250
you want to think of yourself as a

379
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:46,579
sniper.

380
00:06:46,769 --> 00:06:48,069
You're picking your dream client

381
00:06:48,069 --> 00:06:49,529
and sniping them and signing them.

382
00:06:49,529 --> 00:06:50,800
Sounds a bit cringe, but you get

383
00:06:50,829 --> 00:06:51,370
what I mean.

384
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:52,660
Typically you can sign one to two

385
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:54,350
clients for every 100 messages you

386
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:54,680
send.

387
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,240
Of course,

388
00:06:55,269 --> 00:06:56,259
this is going to vary depending on

389
00:06:56,259 --> 00:06:56,819
your industry.

390
00:06:56,819 --> 00:06:57,670
And if you actually know what

391
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:58,300
you're doing.

392
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:58,500
Now,

393
00:06:58,569 --> 00:06:59,829
one thing with me is that I'm not

394
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:00,639
a one hit wonder.

395
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:01,970
I've also helped dozens of people

396
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:02,649
scale up.

397
00:07:02,649 --> 00:07:02,779
Take

398
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:04,370
Yaroslav and David, for example,

399
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:05,870
who scaled to 14k a month in four

400
00:07:05,949 --> 00:07:06,370
months.

401
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:07,490
And actually I have to

402
00:07:07,569 --> 00:07:08,639
update the interview I did with

403
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:08,970
them.

404
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,160
That's on my channel because after

405
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:11,279
nine months of being in my

406
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:13,009
program, they hit 30k a month.

407
00:07:13,009 --> 00:07:14,480
Next up, we have Chris and Amrit

408
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,160
who hit 35k a month within four

409
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:16,339
months

410
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:17,189
program.

411
00:07:17,189 --> 00:07:18,519
And eight months later, they're at

412
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:19,170
50k a month.

413
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:20,170
This is Steven Batarina.

414
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:21,079
And within a four

415
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:22,829
month period, he scaled to 30k a

416
00:07:22,839 --> 00:07:23,259
month.

417
00:07:23,259 --> 00:07:24,569
This is recurring income.

418
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:25,980
But I got to update that one as

419
00:07:26,009 --> 00:07:27,209
well, because after nine months of

420
00:07:27,209 --> 00:07:28,560
being in the program, he's hit 50k

421
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,170
a month as well.

422
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:29,699
I have more

423
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:30,689
interviews on my channel, so I'm

424
00:07:30,689 --> 00:07:31,589
not going to list them out, but

425
00:07:31,589 --> 00:07:32,319
you get what I mean.

426
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:32,959
So there you have

427
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:33,199
it.

428
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:34,339
That's exactly what a content

429
00:07:34,339 --> 00:07:35,389
agency is and why it's such a

430
00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:37,259
powerful business model in 2025.

431
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,660
You've heard this before, but we

432
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:40,029
live in an attention economy and

433
00:07:40,029 --> 00:07:41,600
pretty much everybody needs to be

434
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:41,759
on

435
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:42,589
social media or else their

436
00:07:42,589 --> 00:07:43,519
business is going to dry up.

437
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:44,980
Now you might be thinking, okay,

438
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,600
this sounds

439
00:07:45,629 --> 00:07:46,930
great, but what exactly should I

440
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:47,399
do first?

441
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:48,990
Well, I actually made a 100% free

442
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:49,620
training.

443
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:49,939
That's going

444
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,800
to be the first link in the

445
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,360
description.

446
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:52,480
You should definitely check that

447
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:52,730
out.

448
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:53,560
On top of that, make sure

449
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:54,509
you subscribe so you never miss

450
00:07:54,509 --> 00:07:55,040
another video.

451
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:55,759
All right, that's it.

452
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:56,810
Catch you guys in the next one.
