1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,120
What's up guys, Lucas here.

2
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:02,799
So in this video, I'm going to be

3
00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:03,759
showing you how to use Poppy

4
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:05,980
to script a YouTube video.

5
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:07,299
Now for this, we're going to be

6
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:08,480
using a template you'll find in

7
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:08,630
the

8
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:10,130
template section called Brian ng

9
00:00:10,269 --> 00:00:11,839
YouTube script writing template.

10
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:13,679
This is by far the best one

11
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:14,730
I've found here so far.

12
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:15,830
So as you can see, this is a

13
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:17,039
template board view only.

14
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:17,440
So what I'm going

15
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:18,910
to do is going to click use

16
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:20,870
template, and we'll create a copy

17
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:23,039
of this in my own Poppy account.

18
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:26,989
So now we're in here.

19
00:00:26,989 --> 00:00:28,640
First thing I'm going to do is I'm

20
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,519
going to read instructions for

21
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:32,479
users.

22
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:32,710
So

23
00:00:32,979 --> 00:00:34,619
before you begin, have your final

24
00:00:34,729 --> 00:00:36,530
video concept and title ready.

25
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:38,149
Gather these resources to provide

26
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:39,320
context to AI, your target video

27
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,380
length, transcripts of two to

28
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:41,570
three high performing videos in

29
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:41,590
your

30
00:00:41,869 --> 00:00:42,539
niche with similar content

31
00:00:42,539 --> 00:00:43,399
structure, key points you

32
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:44,479
absolutely must include in your

33
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:45,350
video, and your

34
00:00:45,619 --> 00:00:46,460
research data or sources you plan

35
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:47,560
to reference your hook ideas have

36
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,560
already developed as specific

37
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:49,750
retention tags that have worked

38
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:51,259
for your channel before it's for

39
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:52,630
best results crucial almost to add

40
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:53,829
your own PDFs, YouTube videos,

41
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:55,520
webinars, website, creative brief.

42
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,399
I think it's a document for

43
00:00:56,659 --> 00:00:57,520
creating a creative brief.

44
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,619
You also find a tutorial on

45
00:00:59,619 --> 00:01:01,590
creating your creative brief in

46
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:01,920
the client

47
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,109
ascension course from Nick Verge.

48
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:04,750
The golden rule of script

49
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:05,650
development.

50
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:06,879
Every 30 seconds ask yourself,

51
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:08,060
would I keep watching this and why

52
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:08,769
were the viewer?

53
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:09,969
The answer is an immediate yes,

54
00:01:09,969 --> 00:01:10,549
stress in that section

55
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,480
by adding a surprise fact,

56
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,780
inserting a mini story, including

57
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:14,230
compelling example, creating a

58
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:15,040
curiosity gap,

59
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,230
or using a pattern interruption

60
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:16,939
technique.

61
00:01:17,049 --> 00:01:19,340
So let's start with getting our

62
00:01:19,549 --> 00:01:20,319
information in here.

63
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:21,510
This is group one who I am now.

64
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:22,920
Brian's got his information in

65
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:23,359
here.

66
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:24,620
So we're just going to remove

67
00:01:24,829 --> 00:01:24,959
this.

68
00:01:25,219 --> 00:01:32,400
Boom, all gone.

69
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,010
And I'm going to grab some of my

70
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,750
own YouTube videos.

71
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:36,319
So we're going to go to

72
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:37,120
youtube.com.

73
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:40,719
I'm going to go view your channel.

74
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:45,849
We're going to copy all these

75
00:01:45,849 --> 00:01:46,640
over.

76
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:50,629
Let's go back to poppy, paste.

77
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:58,319
Copy, paste.

78
00:01:58,579 --> 00:02:03,180
So we're going to copy a few more

79
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,060
of these in.

80
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:07,280
We want as many as we can.

81
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,879
Copy, paste.

82
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:17,729
That should be one or two more of

83
00:02:17,729 --> 00:02:18,879
these.

84
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:22,310
And then we're going to do is

85
00:02:22,469 --> 00:02:26,550
we're going to put my website.

86
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:28,000
We're going to hit W for website.

87
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,280
We're going to type in my website

88
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,639
name.

89
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:34,800
Put that in there.

90
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,849
I'm going to get my creative

91
00:02:35,849 --> 00:02:36,219
brief.

92
00:02:36,219 --> 00:02:37,389
I'm just going to find this on my

93
00:02:37,389 --> 00:02:38,000
computer.

94
00:02:38,259 --> 00:02:41,169
Okay, so I'm uploading my creative

95
00:02:41,169 --> 00:02:42,069
brief.

96
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,960
We're going to put that in there.

97
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,400
And that should be pretty much all

98
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:49,699
we're going to need is wait for

99
00:02:49,699 --> 00:02:50,870
that to extract the text.

100
00:02:51,099 --> 00:02:53,759
So let's see what else Brian had.

101
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:56,680
Our target video length,

102
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,060
transcripts.

103
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:01,280
I'm also going to go and grab from

104
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,400
one of my previous boards,

105
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,930
if I can find it, my tone of voice

106
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:09,919
clone that we did before.

107
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:11,759
So you remember in a previous

108
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:12,770
video, we created this.

109
00:03:12,889 --> 00:03:14,689
This was our brand voice and

110
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:15,280
speaking style.

111
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,469
We can copy this whole group and

112
00:03:16,909 --> 00:03:20,319
we can go back here and we can

113
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:21,759
paste this in.

114
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:23,509
We can add this actually as

115
00:03:23,509 --> 00:03:26,879
another whole group to connect.

116
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:35,120
And yeah, we should be good to go.

117
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,840
So let's see what else.

118
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:39,680
Now we're going to go down here.

119
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,699
So Brian has a prompt written for

120
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:43,680
us already.

121
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:44,759
There's someone's going to link

122
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:46,099
this because we don't need that

123
00:03:46,099 --> 00:03:46,719
right now.

124
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:47,759
This is a flow chart.

125
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,919
Let's go down here.

126
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:51,599
I think this is a bigger, right?

127
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:55,280
Oh, copy.

128
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,960
Group one is who I am, my content,

129
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,789
analyze the content, give me a

130
00:03:57,789 --> 00:03:58,159
summary of my

131
00:03:58,370 --> 00:03:59,349
brown voice, signals to the tone,

132
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:00,469
speak words I use, group two's

133
00:04:00,469 --> 00:04:02,000
guides, how to write viral videos.

134
00:04:02,259 --> 00:04:03,680
Group three is a prompt chain for

135
00:04:03,689 --> 00:04:05,199
writing the outline and we're

136
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:05,919
going to actually modify

137
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,280
this a little bit because we now

138
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,599
have a group four.

139
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:16,639
Voice, profile, tone and style.

140
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,350
I'm going to say group four is my

141
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:30,720
voice, tone and style prompt.

142
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,050
Follow this to write like

143
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:40,120
to write scripts in my voice and

144
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:43,439
speaking style.

145
00:04:43,699 --> 00:04:46,540
Now we're going to say, I want to

146
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:49,829
write a YouTube video about, let's

147
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:50,160
say,

148
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:55,490
AI automations that you need to

149
00:04:55,509 --> 00:04:59,269
have in 2025.

150
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:01,129
Now, one of the things you can do

151
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:02,000
as part of this

152
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,180
is we can take existing videos

153
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,560
that we know are high performing

154
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:10,079
and we can include those as

155
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:11,360
examples.

156
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,790
So let's see, what's one of the,

157
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,319
what's a good automations.

158
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:19,920
So this is a good one.

159
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,329
This is eight sales automations,

160
00:05:21,329 --> 00:05:23,040
fairly cheating from Liam oddly.

161
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:24,060
Now we can actually get the

162
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,360
information from this by copying

163
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:25,600
this.

164
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,759
And let's make a new group and

165
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,410
call it group five.

166
00:05:29,459 --> 00:05:31,339
We're going to name it

167
00:05:36,579 --> 00:05:41,600
topic information and education.

168
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:45,550
So then we place that video in

169
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:48,149
there and we're going to describe

170
00:05:48,149 --> 00:05:50,879
this as well to our, in our

171
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:51,360
prompt.

172
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,680
So let's grab this right.

173
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,220
Let's up here and connect it if we

174
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:56,560
can.

175
00:05:58,879 --> 00:05:59,759
And then we're going to add to

176
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:00,319
this prompt.

177
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:01,040
We're going to say.

178
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:06,149
Group five contains information

179
00:06:06,149 --> 00:06:09,839
about the topic I am speaking

180
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:10,399
about.

181
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:16,120
Use this group for research on the

182
00:06:16,529 --> 00:06:18,319
topic of the video.

183
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,189
Now we're going to copy this and

184
00:06:21,629 --> 00:06:25,189
we are going to paste it into our

185
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:25,759
chat.

186
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:27,980
So let's zoom in a little bit.

187
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:30,220
So I want you to script a YouTube

188
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:31,620
video about AI automations you

189
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:32,720
need to have in 2025.

190
00:06:32,949 --> 00:06:33,600
Group one is who I am.

191
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,040
My content is the content can be

192
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:35,839
sorry, our voice.

193
00:06:36,089 --> 00:06:37,040
Take note of the tone of the

194
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:38,240
speakers I use.

195
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,040
Group two is guys that headwrite

196
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,379
viral videos refer to the

197
00:06:41,379 --> 00:06:42,000
documents that understand

198
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,639
headwrite hooks,

199
00:06:42,899 --> 00:06:43,970
bodies, open lips, ETAs, et

200
00:06:44,259 --> 00:06:44,480
cetera.

201
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,759
Group three is a prompt chain for

202
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,240
the outline.

203
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:46,910
If I should get the script.

204
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:47,769
When I tell you to call these

205
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:48,720
prompt chains, call them.

206
00:06:48,949 --> 00:06:49,860
Group four is my voice tone and

207
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,040
saw prompt for the story scripts

208
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,079
in my voice and speaking style.

209
00:06:52,259 --> 00:06:53,100
Group five contains information

210
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:53,959
about the topic I'm speaking

211
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:54,300
about.

212
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,959
So we might actually need to say,

213
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:57,680
analyze the content.

214
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,240
We can just say.

215
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:04,720
Use this to tailor the scripts.

216
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:09,439
To me specifically.

217
00:07:09,699 --> 00:07:11,439
To me.

218
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,800
Lucas Senate specifically.

219
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:24,000
And pulling information.

220
00:07:24,269 --> 00:07:27,040
Or stories.

221
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,319
Pulling information.

222
00:07:28,579 --> 00:07:32,079
From my personal stories.

223
00:07:32,339 --> 00:07:34,399
And experience to.

224
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:38,639
Include if necessary.

225
00:07:38,899 --> 00:07:42,000
I can't spell.

226
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,120
Necessary.

227
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:44,240
There we go.

228
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,120
All right.

229
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,720
I'm going to hit enter.

230
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,360
Let's see what we get.

231
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:50,399
Let's make this a bit bigger.

232
00:07:50,670 --> 00:08:04,480
Okay.

233
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:08,449
It's running through our prompt

234
00:08:08,449 --> 00:08:09,670
chain.

235
00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:14,319
So.

236
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,040
You can see it says.

237
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:15,990
I'll be creating YouTube script.

238
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,639
By automation.

239
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:17,829
With your knowledge base.

240
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:18,639
You can see who you are.

241
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:19,839
Let me start using our prompt

242
00:08:20,269 --> 00:08:20,290
chain.

243
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:21,269
I'll choose your outline for this

244
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:21,509
video.

245
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,480
I'll call the first prompt to use

246
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,490
your outline development chain.

247
00:08:23,779 --> 00:08:25,360
Great.

248
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:25,600
So.

249
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:27,439
We're getting this here.

250
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:28,000
Blah, blah, blah.

251
00:08:29,689 --> 00:08:31,660
And this is writing to these over

252
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:32,320
here.

253
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,000
These ones here.

254
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,798
The prompt chain here.

255
00:08:34,798 --> 00:08:35,360
So that's the.

256
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:37,759
Crafts TGQ script outlines.

257
00:08:38,019 --> 00:08:38,950
And then.

258
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:39,440
Uh.

259
00:08:39,658 --> 00:08:41,120
We're going to.

260
00:08:41,379 --> 00:08:44,000
Say that's all good.

261
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,320
I'm just going to say continue.

262
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,269
So it's going to outline the

263
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:54,799
script now.

264
00:08:55,059 --> 00:09:04,159
So we're getting the outline.

265
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:04,639
So we're going to say.

266
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:05,039
You know.

267
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:05,919
Main section structure.

268
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:06,870
The hook and authority building.

269
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:07,919
Open with contrasting reality.

270
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:08,529
When most people are still

271
00:09:08,529 --> 00:09:08,879
figuring out.

272
00:09:09,139 --> 00:09:09,759
ChatTBT.

273
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:10,639
It's average credibility.

274
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,309
Through client extension.

275
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:12,309
Innovative experience.

276
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:13,120
Uh.

277
00:09:13,379 --> 00:09:14,080
Promise specific automation.

278
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,000
It's every winner's release in

279
00:09:15,029 --> 00:09:15,679
2025.

280
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:16,360
Uh.

281
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:18,240
Why most AI implementations fail.

282
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,419
The difference between AI toys.

283
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:20,559
Versus AI tools make money.

284
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:21,679
So the automation hierarchy

285
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:22,159
concept.

286
00:09:22,419 --> 00:09:23,340
Uh.

287
00:09:23,509 --> 00:09:24,309
Lead response automation.

288
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:24,960
Proposal generation.

289
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,600
Client boarding sequence.

290
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,000
So Chris.

291
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,039
We've got some of the actual.

292
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:27,440
Uh.

293
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:28,330
Automations we're going to talk

294
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:28,629
about.

295
00:09:28,809 --> 00:09:30,480
Involvation reality.

296
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:31,360
Here's the thing.

297
00:09:31,509 --> 00:09:32,549
Why most people will do this.

298
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,039
Uh.

299
00:09:33,299 --> 00:09:34,230
Direct CTA to work with you.

300
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:35,190
Key dependencies.

301
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,320
We'll establish AI credibility.

302
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:38,399
Lead response will come first.

303
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:39,070
Revenue fact.

304
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:40,000
Recovery last.

305
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,639
Nested loops.

306
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:41,279
We'll own automation.

307
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:42,559
That's already 295 weeks.

308
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:43,440
We'll be at the seven minute mark.

309
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:44,080
Uh.

310
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:44,879
The mistake that kills everything.

311
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:46,399
Involvation scope is section two.

312
00:09:46,659 --> 00:09:47,580
Uh.

313
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:48,789
Right.

314
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:51,679
Okay.

315
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:53,580
Range movement is detailed section

316
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:55,039
by section blueprint.

317
00:09:55,299 --> 00:09:56,720
Yes.

318
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:57,399
Continue.

319
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:59,789
So we're going to make the section

320
00:09:59,789 --> 00:10:01,570
by section blueprint.

321
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:11,759
So this is all giving the AI.

322
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:12,870
And this is from Brian's prompt

323
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:13,279
chain.

324
00:10:13,539 --> 00:10:13,919
Giving the AI.

325
00:10:14,139 --> 00:10:14,480
Uh.

326
00:10:14,659 --> 00:10:16,100
You know specific structures to

327
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:16,480
follow.

328
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,669
And instructions on how it's going

329
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:18,320
to do this.

330
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:21,279
I'm just going to tell.

331
00:10:21,539 --> 00:10:22,080
Continue again.

332
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:32,480
So here we go.

333
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:32,799
So.

334
00:10:33,059 --> 00:10:35,220
Detail section by section

335
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:36,559
blueprint.

336
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:37,679
We've got hook approach one.

337
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:38,320
And hook approach two.

338
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,509
We've got two to go from.

339
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:40,190
And three actually.

340
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,600
So let's see.

341
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,480
Let's start off with this.

342
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,279
So one of them is.

343
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:47,120
I recently surveyed over 100,000

344
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,000
AI agency owners.

345
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,919
To find out what's actually

346
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,889
working in 2025.

347
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:51,179
Most people are still playing

348
00:10:51,179 --> 00:10:52,159
around with chat GPT.

349
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:52,960
Asking to write emails.

350
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,159
The smart money is already living

351
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:56,320
in a completely different reality.

352
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,509
We found a property developer

353
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:58,000
using AI.

354
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,620
To turn missed Sunday calls into

355
00:10:59,629 --> 00:11:00,799
$2 million deals.

356
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,990
And an agency helping cosmetic

357
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:03,279
clinics started $100,000.

358
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:04,470
In just three days.

359
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,120
In this video.

360
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,220
I'm going to show you the exact

361
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,279
eight AI automations.

362
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:08,639
You need to have in 2025.

363
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:09,830
If you want to stay competitive.

364
00:11:10,139 --> 00:11:10,870
First, let me show you why most

365
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:12,000
people are doing AI completely

366
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,399
wrong.

367
00:11:12,659 --> 00:11:14,159
Second one is.

368
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:14,720
Here's the thing.

369
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:15,629
While you're manually responding

370
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:16,559
to leads at 2:00 a.m.

371
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:17,240
And spending hours writing

372
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:17,679
proposals.

373
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:19,179
Your competitors are using AI

374
00:11:19,309 --> 00:11:20,639
systems that never sleep.

375
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:21,590
Never miss a follow up.

376
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:22,799
And are generating hundreds of

377
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:24,559
thousands in additional revenue.

378
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:25,039
I know this.

379
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:25,919
Because I just finished surveying

380
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:27,519
100,000 plus agency owners.

381
00:11:27,669 --> 00:11:28,679
And that's what I found will

382
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:30,000
either motivate you or terrify

383
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,399
you.

384
00:11:30,549 --> 00:11:30,639
Sorry.

385
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:31,399
And what I found will either

386
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:32,240
motivate or terrify you.

387
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,440
I'm Lucas Sinnott.

388
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:34,480
Head expert coach.

389
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,120
Client Ascension.

390
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,000
And why I help people scale the

391
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,399
agencies.

392
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:37,590
And co-founder of Innovative.

393
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,480
I've seen what works and what

394
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:38,789
doesn't.

395
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,080
This eight automations aren't

396
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:40,639
theory.

397
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:41,659
They're bottle tested systems

398
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:42,860
generating real money right now.

399
00:11:43,139 --> 00:11:44,639
Third one.

400
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:45,830
An AI system just booked 200 sales

401
00:11:46,269 --> 00:11:46,480
appointments.

402
00:11:46,649 --> 00:11:48,490
And generated $220,000 in

403
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:49,440
additional revenue.

404
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,039
In five weeks with zero human

405
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,080
intervention.

406
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:53,110
Another one helped the cosmetic

407
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:54,750
clinic make $100,000 in three

408
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:55,200
days.

409
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,240
These aren't future predictions.

410
00:11:56,429 --> 00:11:57,429
This is happening right now.

411
00:11:57,769 --> 00:11:58,669
While most people are still

412
00:11:58,669 --> 00:12:00,879
figuring out basic .gbt prompts.

413
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:02,070
I'm going to break down the exact

414
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,360
eight AI automations.

415
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:04,549
Behind results like these.

416
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:05,830
But there's one mistake that kills

417
00:12:06,269 --> 00:12:06,960
90% of implementations.

418
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,629
For the even start.

419
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:08,870
Great.

420
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:11,100
So then keeps going.

421
00:12:11,309 --> 00:12:13,679
It gives us our full outline.

422
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:15,840
Great.

423
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,029
So ready to do the retention

424
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,480
engine and strategic optimization.

425
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:18,960
Yes.

426
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:19,519
Continue.

427
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:21,639
As you can see this goes through a

428
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:22,559
multi-step process.

429
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:23,570
I'm just going to output a full

430
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:24,240
script for you.

431
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,759
It breaks it down step by step.

432
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:26,559
To get you to get it.

433
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,320
So AI understands what it should

434
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:28,639
be doing.

435
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:29,830
And how to break the best script

436
00:12:30,259 --> 00:12:30,320
possible.

437
00:12:30,509 --> 00:12:31,360
Based on Brian's frameworks.

438
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:34,860
So we've got retention wave

439
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:35,440
mapping.

440
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,600
Audience retention checkpoints.

441
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:38,879
Strategic content reveal pasting.

442
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:40,070
Psychological mental builders.

443
00:12:40,419 --> 00:12:42,320
Keep going.

444
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:43,500
Continue.

445
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:45,279
Most of this is typing continue.

446
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,230
After you do the initial prompt.

447
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:46,909
And you get everything set up.

448
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,149
You got your information in there.

449
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,279
It's really solid.

450
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:49,899
So now it's actually going to give

451
00:12:49,899 --> 00:12:50,480
us the high points.

452
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:51,149
Where we're going to do these

453
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:52,000
retention wave mapping.

454
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,759
It's just going to tell us where

455
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:55,679
to say these things in the script.

456
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,909
In order to, you know, increase

457
00:12:57,990 --> 00:12:59,279
retention.

458
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:01,039
And to bring people back to maybe

459
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:02,240
not paying attention anymore.

460
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:02,909
Or losing interest.

461
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,950
So yeah.

462
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,149
We've got pattern interrupt.

463
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,360
Insert mini cliffhanger.

464
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,480
Add explanation subversion.

465
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:11,759
Strategic content reveal pasting.

466
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:12,440
The review of the survey

467
00:13:12,509 --> 00:13:12,950
credibility.

468
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,600
The mindset shift.

469
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:14,639
But AI versus tools.

470
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:15,759
The conversion stat.

471
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:17,600
Personal adaptability story.

472
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:20,000
Psychological mental builders.

473
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:20,320
This is great.

474
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,429
So this is like all, you know,

475
00:13:21,429 --> 00:13:22,539
super, super psychologically

476
00:13:22,629 --> 00:13:22,879
focused.

477
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:23,899
And kind of detailed based on

478
00:13:23,899 --> 00:13:24,240
YouTube.

479
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,080
Because Brian's study of YouTube.

480
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,269
The different kind of retention

481
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:27,759
tactics.

482
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:28,429
And things that work to keep

483
00:13:28,509 --> 00:13:28,950
people watching.

484
00:13:29,539 --> 00:13:37,200
Yes, continuous.

485
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:37,870
Now we're going to do the full

486
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:38,639
script development.

487
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:39,830
Using these retention optimized

488
00:13:40,259 --> 00:13:40,480
elements.

489
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:47,230
So now it's developing a powerful

490
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:48,960
hook.

491
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:56,960
An intro.

492
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:09,649
And we're going to say continue

493
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:12,850
again.

494
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:13,789
So now it has the outline on the

495
00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:14,960
instructions for what it should

496
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:15,200
do.

497
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:20,909
So now we've got our hooks.

498
00:14:21,379 --> 00:14:25,120
And we've got delivery guidance.

499
00:14:25,379 --> 00:14:34,850
So now we're in the value prop

500
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:38,929
section.

501
00:14:39,159 --> 00:14:40,720
The engagement foundation.

502
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:45,019
Introduction overview.

503
00:14:45,309 --> 00:14:52,960
Strategic open loops embedded.

504
00:14:53,169 --> 00:14:54,080
Plugin drops built in.

505
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:56,639
There we go.

506
00:14:56,679 --> 00:14:58,320
So that's our hook section on

507
00:14:58,330 --> 00:14:59,200
intro done.

508
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:01,440
So let's see what this looks like.

509
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,659
So after we, I read the hooks

510
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:04,669
already, but let's go into the

511
00:15:04,669 --> 00:15:05,570
next section of the value prop.

512
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,789
My name is Lucas Sinnott.

513
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,879
I'm the head expert coach at

514
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:08,720
client Ascension.

515
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,639
One of the leading programs that

516
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,940
teaches people how to launch and

517
00:15:11,029 --> 00:15:11,840
scale agencies.

518
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,759
And I'm also co-founder of

519
00:15:12,789 --> 00:15:13,440
innovative.

520
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,629
A full service e-commerce

521
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:15,919
optimization agency.

522
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:16,870
I've helped hundreds of agency

523
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:18,000
owners scale their businesses.

524
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:19,429
And I've seen what separates the

525
00:15:19,629 --> 00:15:20,720
winners from the losers.

526
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,759
The winners aren't smarter.

527
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:22,710
They don't have bigger budgets.

528
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:23,909
They definitely don't work harder.

529
00:15:24,139 --> 00:15:25,440
They just understand one thing.

530
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:26,389
While everyone else is doing

531
00:15:26,389 --> 00:15:26,960
things manually.

532
00:15:27,169 --> 00:15:28,159
They're using AI to create unfair

533
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:29,179
advantages.

534
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,049
In this video, I'm going to show

535
00:15:30,049 --> 00:15:31,120
you the exact eight, uh,

536
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,250
AI automations that are generating

537
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:33,009
these kinds of results.

538
00:15:33,159 --> 00:15:34,159
Not theory, not fluff.

539
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:35,220
The actual systems are the tech

540
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,350
stocks, the pricing, and the real

541
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:36,960
numbers behind them.

542
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:38,529
Here's what I found out for

543
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:40,240
talking to all these agency

544
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:40,480
owners.

545
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:41,399
There are two types of businesses

546
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:41,840
right now.

547
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:45,759
Yeah, perfect.

548
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,480
So he actually mentions one of my

549
00:15:49,629 --> 00:15:50,799
personal stories there.

550
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:51,360
Here's the thing.

551
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,200
And this connects to everything I

552
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,250
learned going from screening and

553
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:54,960
metal buyers to scaling agencies.

554
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:56,149
Success isn't about having perfect

555
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:56,799
conditions.

556
00:15:56,799 --> 00:15:57,990
It's about adapting faster than

557
00:15:58,429 --> 00:15:58,960
everyone else.

558
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:00,549
The same adaptability, the same

559
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:01,919
adaptability that took me from

560
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:03,029
death metal to tech journalism

561
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:03,940
to running agencies is what's

562
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:04,929
going to separate the winners from

563
00:16:04,929 --> 00:16:06,080
the losers in the AI revolution.

564
00:16:06,279 --> 00:16:07,600
Here's what we're going to cover.

565
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,509
I'm going to break down the eight

566
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:09,649
specific AI automations in order

567
00:16:09,649 --> 00:16:10,480
of importance.

568
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,509
We'll start with the foundation,

569
00:16:11,509 --> 00:16:12,379
the systems that every business

570
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:13,840
needs to have in place first.

571
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:14,730
Then we'll move to the growth

572
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:15,679
layer, the automations that

573
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:16,000
separate

574
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:17,200
good agencies from great ones.

575
00:16:17,539 --> 00:16:18,879
And finally, the revenue layer,

576
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:20,789
including the $220,000 system I

577
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:21,600
mentioned.

578
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,799
For each automation, I'll show you

579
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,399
exactly how it works, what tools

580
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:24,960
are using,

581
00:16:25,149 --> 00:16:26,149
what it costs to implement, and

582
00:16:26,379 --> 00:16:27,840
the real results it's generating.

583
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,210
No theory, no maybes, just the

584
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:30,549
systems that are working right

585
00:16:30,549 --> 00:16:30,960
now.

586
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:31,840
But I'm also going to tell you

587
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,850
something at the end that most

588
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:34,399
people don't want to hear.

589
00:16:34,659 --> 00:16:35,309
Because knowing about these

590
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,480
systems and actually implementing

591
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,669
them are two completely different

592
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:38,240
things.

593
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:39,669
And there's one reason why 90% of

594
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:41,039
people who watch this video won't

595
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:42,370
do anything with this information.

596
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:43,070
Let's check it out.

597
00:16:43,379 --> 00:16:44,039
Great.

598
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,129
So we're going to do the core

599
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:45,980
content sections.

600
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:46,879
We're going to say continue.

601
00:16:47,059 --> 00:16:48,549
And again, we're talking about a

602
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:50,309
complicated topic here as well.

603
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:51,250
I could have done this on, you

604
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:52,289
know, general, anything kind of

605
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:54,210
overall, but agency development or

606
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:55,440
growth or whatever.

607
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,629
But like, this is a very specific

608
00:16:57,059 --> 00:16:58,480
topic of these specific AI

609
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,570
automations, you know?

610
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,220
So we're giving it kind of the,

611
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,639
uh, a pretty big task here.

612
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:03,830
And if we can pull this off pretty

613
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:04,720
well, using the information from

614
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,119
the video

615
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,220
we provided that contains that

616
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:06,720
information.

617
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,779
Uh, and you can add multiple

618
00:17:07,779 --> 00:17:08,240
videos.

619
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,109
It doesn't have to be one that

620
00:17:09,109 --> 00:17:10,140
you're kind of, you know, copying

621
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:11,039
from being put a bunch

622
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:11,809
in there that are similar to what

623
00:17:11,809 --> 00:17:12,640
the topic you want to talk about.

624
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,470
It'll kind of take from all of

625
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:13,759
them.

626
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:15,568
But, uh, let's keep telling this

627
00:17:15,568 --> 00:17:16,480
to continue.

628
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:22,000
These are good.

629
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,430
So we have our main points set up.

630
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,640
Uh, we have our, sorry, smooth

631
00:17:25,068 --> 00:17:25,328
transition.

632
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,259
We have our main points set up and

633
00:17:27,369 --> 00:17:28,559
then we have why this matters.

634
00:17:28,599 --> 00:17:29,470
Look, if you're still manually

635
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:30,460
responding to every lead, writing

636
00:17:30,569 --> 00:17:31,759
every proposal from scratch

637
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:32,680
and handling client onboarding

638
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,599
spreadsheets, you're not just

639
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:34,240
inefficient.

640
00:17:34,279 --> 00:17:35,430
You're about to get destroyed by

641
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,720
your competition because while

642
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,910
you're burning out doing a $10

643
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,099
an hour task, they're using AI to

644
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:40,140
handle the heavy lifting and

645
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:41,349
focusing on closing deals.

646
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,349
Getting this wrong means you'll

647
00:17:42,349 --> 00:17:43,599
spend the next year working harder

648
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:44,799
while making less money.

649
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,410
But nailed this mindset shift and

650
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:47,190
suddenly you're operating in a

651
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:48,079
completely different league.

652
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:49,619
It all comes down to what I call

653
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:51,039
the automation hierarchy.

654
00:17:51,299 --> 00:17:52,230
Foundation first, complexity

655
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:52,799
later.

656
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:53,730
You don't start with the fancy

657
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:53,990
stuff.

658
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:54,859
You start with the systems that

659
00:17:54,859 --> 00:17:56,140
handle your biggest time dreads

660
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:57,200
and revenue leaks.

661
00:17:57,369 --> 00:17:58,000
Think about it like this.

662
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,019
When I was scaling my agency to

663
00:17:59,019 --> 00:18:00,059
20K a month, I didn't try to

664
00:18:00,059 --> 00:18:00,880
automate everything at once.

665
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,980
I started with lead response, then

666
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,039
moves to proposals, then client

667
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:03,440
management.

668
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:04,640
Each layer built to the previous

669
00:18:05,059 --> 00:18:05,279
one.

670
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:06,400
The agencies in my survey that are

671
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,440
crushing it all follow the same

672
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:07,920
pattern.

673
00:18:08,099 --> 00:18:09,099
They don't just jump straight to

674
00:18:09,099 --> 00:18:10,079
complex AI workflows.

675
00:18:10,119 --> 00:18:10,950
They started with automation

676
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:11,970
number one, mastered it, then

677
00:18:12,089 --> 00:18:13,039
moved to number two.

678
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:13,839
For example, the property

679
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:15,079
developer making $2 million from

680
00:18:15,079 --> 00:18:15,759
Sunday calls.

681
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:16,710
He didn't start there.

682
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,670
He started with basic lead

683
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,119
response automation, then added

684
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:20,480
qualification, then booking.

685
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:22,180
Each step made the next one more

686
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:22,960
powerful.

687
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,630
Here's the thing though.

688
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:24,599
Following this hierarchy and

689
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,160
actually following it, or knowing

690
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:26,950
this hierarchy and actually

691
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:27,279
following

692
00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:28,470
it are two different things.

693
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:29,670
Most people want to skip the sexy

694
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:30,160
stuff.

695
00:18:30,339 --> 00:18:31,349
Don't be most people.

696
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:32,480
Let's start with the foundation.

697
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:33,670
Automation number one is something

698
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:34,799
that every single successful

699
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:35,359
agency has.

700
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:36,150
If you don't have this, something

701
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:36,549
else matters.

702
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:39,079
These first three automations

703
00:18:39,079 --> 00:18:41,319
aren't the most exciting, but

704
00:18:41,319 --> 00:18:42,240
they're the most important.

705
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:43,089
Think of them as the foundation of

706
00:18:43,089 --> 00:18:43,430
your house.

707
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:44,450
It's boring, but everything else

708
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:45,279
collapses without them.

709
00:18:45,539 --> 00:18:46,970
Automation number one, lead

710
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:48,160
response system.

711
00:18:48,339 --> 00:18:49,349
Here's a stat that will blow your

712
00:18:49,549 --> 00:18:49,759
mind.

713
00:18:50,009 --> 00:18:50,950
These contactives in the first

714
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:53,519
minute of inquiry have a 391%

715
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:54,630
higher conversion rate compared to

716
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,000
slower responses.

717
00:18:56,259 --> 00:18:58,609
391%, and get this 78% of buyers

718
00:18:58,619 --> 00:19:00,000
choose the first company that

719
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,119
responds regardless of price.

720
00:19:01,289 --> 00:19:02,309
But here's the kicker.

721
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,759
The average lead response time

722
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:05,750
across all industries is 42 hours.

723
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:06,940
By the time most people respond,

724
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,170
their lead is already bought from

725
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:09,430
someone else, forgotten they were

726
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:10,640
interested or moved on with their

727
00:19:11,059 --> 00:19:11,279
life.

728
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:12,480
This is where the AI lead response

729
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:13,359
comes in.

730
00:19:13,359 --> 00:19:14,549
We're talking about a system that

731
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:16,970
responds within 60 seconds, 24/7,

732
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:18,230
365 days a year.

733
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:19,509
No sick days, no vacation.

734
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:21,279
No, I'll get to it tomorrow.

735
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:22,480
The system I'm talking about uses

736
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:23,839
tools like Vapi for voice,

737
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:25,200
make.com for workflow automation,

738
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,390
and voice flow over conversation

739
00:19:26,779 --> 00:19:26,960
logic.

740
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,380
It picks up the phone, has a real

741
00:19:28,589 --> 00:19:30,079
conversation, qualifies lead, and

742
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:31,099
books meetings for your sales

743
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:31,680
team.

744
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,799
So yeah, this is great.

745
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:33,829
So we're going through all the

746
00:19:33,829 --> 00:19:34,480
automations.

747
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,019
Uh, now we're on to four to six

748
00:19:36,109 --> 00:19:39,250
growth layer, and then we should

749
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:42,799
have, uh, four to six.

750
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:46,059
So we've covered the foundation

751
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:47,920
growth layers.

752
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,720
We even though these six

753
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,819
automations are operating levels

754
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:50,720
agency will never reach.

755
00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:51,500
These are where things get really

756
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:51,900
interesting.

757
00:19:52,099 --> 00:19:52,849
These next two automations are

758
00:19:52,869 --> 00:19:53,839
where I've seen the biggest ROI.

759
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:54,680
We're talking about systems that

760
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,339
will save time, improve

761
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:56,319
efficiency, blah, blah, blah.

762
00:19:56,519 --> 00:19:56,640
Great.

763
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:59,599
And then let's do continue.

764
00:19:59,859 --> 00:20:02,940
We're going to do, uh, section

765
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:03,900
seven to eight under the

766
00:20:04,109 --> 00:20:05,279
implementation reality section.

767
00:20:05,539 --> 00:20:15,119
Forms reporting and then.

768
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,500
Revenue recovery system is a big

769
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,480
reveal.

770
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:25,660
All right.

771
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,500
Here's what we've been waiting

772
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:26,720
for.

773
00:20:26,869 --> 00:20:27,910
The automation that generated

774
00:20:28,099 --> 00:20:30,150
$220,000 in five weeks with zero

775
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:31,279
human intervention.

776
00:20:31,539 --> 00:20:32,470
Before I reveal it, let me ask you

777
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:33,039
something.

778
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,089
What's the biggest waste of money

779
00:20:34,089 --> 00:20:34,799
in your business?

780
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:35,599
It's not your tools.

781
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:36,269
It's not your team.

782
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:37,150
It's not even your failed

783
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:38,000
marketing campaigns.

784
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:39,519
It's your dead leads.

785
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:40,549
All those people who showed

786
00:20:40,549 --> 00:20:41,740
interest, maybe even gotten a call

787
00:20:41,829 --> 00:20:42,950
with you, but never bought.

788
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,150
They're sitting in your CRM like

789
00:20:44,579 --> 00:20:45,180
buried treasure.

790
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,390
This is where the revenue recovery

791
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:47,599
becomes pure gold.

792
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:48,519
I'm talking about AI systems that

793
00:20:48,599 --> 00:20:49,680
automatically segment your old

794
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,720
leads, craft personalized

795
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,910
reactivation campaigns and turn

796
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,170
cold prospects into paying

797
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:53,839
customers.

798
00:20:54,099 --> 00:20:56,279
So yeah, this is pretty much

799
00:20:56,279 --> 00:20:57,200
perfect.

800
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:59,269
So then we got the impatient

801
00:20:59,269 --> 00:21:00,480
reality and CTA.

802
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:02,680
This takes back to everything I

803
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,750
learned going from screaming about

804
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:04,880
scaling agencies.

805
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:06,069
Knowledge action is worthless.

806
00:21:06,339 --> 00:21:07,259
Success doesn't care how you feel

807
00:21:07,259 --> 00:21:08,160
about these systems.

808
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:08,980
I'm going to tell you something

809
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:10,049
that might make you uncomfortable.

810
00:21:10,329 --> 00:21:11,269
90% of people who watch this video

811
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:12,400
will do absolutely nothing with

812
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,200
this information.

813
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:14,289
They'll get excited, maybe

814
00:21:14,289 --> 00:21:15,519
bookmark it, tell themselves to

815
00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:16,630
implement it when they have

816
00:21:16,839 --> 00:21:17,829
time, and then go back to doing

817
00:21:18,269 --> 00:21:19,039
everything manually.

818
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:19,599
You know why?

819
00:21:19,829 --> 00:21:20,509
Because implementing AI systems

820
00:21:20,509 --> 00:21:21,200
requires the same thing.

821
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:23,420
So it repeats some things a bit

822
00:21:23,509 --> 00:21:24,480
too much.

823
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,410
So you can always obviously edit

824
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,079
this as it goes on.

825
00:21:26,339 --> 00:21:28,960
Let's see.

826
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:30,079
Here's what I've learned code

827
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:30,799
coders of HCRs.

828
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:31,470
It's not by the technology.

829
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:32,000
The tools are there.

830
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:32,640
The systems work.

831
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,279
The results are proven.

832
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:34,470
The problem is psychological.

833
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:35,470
If you want the results, that's

834
00:21:35,559 --> 00:21:36,160
learning curve.

835
00:21:36,309 --> 00:21:37,359
They want the $220,000 automation

836
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:38,559
without understanding lead

837
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:39,279
qualification.

838
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:40,470
They want the $100,000 revenue

839
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:41,599
recovery without setting up proper

840
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:42,240
data tracking

841
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:42,880
first.

842
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,069
But success doesn't work that way.

843
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,069
You can't skip to foundation and

844
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,049
jump to the advanced stuff.

845
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:47,200
Remember the automation hierarchy

846
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:47,680
I mentioned?

847
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:48,869
Foundation first, complexity

848
00:21:49,109 --> 00:21:49,279
later.

849
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:50,079
So here's your choice.

850
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:51,269
You can be like 90% who watch

851
00:21:51,269 --> 00:21:52,400
this, get inspired for five

852
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:52,720
minutes,

853
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,349
and go back to minding and

854
00:21:53,349 --> 00:21:54,200
handling every lead and want to

855
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:54,319
worry

856
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,269
your competitors are scaling

857
00:21:55,319 --> 00:21:55,680
faster.

858
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,859
Or you can be like the 10% who

859
00:21:56,859 --> 00:21:58,400
understand the adaptability.

860
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,450
That adaptability is the ultimate

861
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:00,079
business skill.

862
00:22:04,339 --> 00:22:05,980
direct CTA final challenge.

863
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,890
So if you want to help embedding

864
00:22:08,009 --> 00:22:08,799
these systems, I've got a few

865
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:09,279
options for you.

866
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:09,950
First, if you're serious about

867
00:22:10,029 --> 00:22:10,799
scaling an agency, check out

868
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:11,359
client extension.

869
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:12,240
Links in the description.

870
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:12,900
That's where I learned the

871
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:13,279
fundamentals.

872
00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:13,779
It's allowed me to build

873
00:22:13,779 --> 00:22:14,230
everything else.

874
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,420
And of course, this will be

875
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:16,950
optimized for whatever your offer

876
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:17,279
is.

877
00:22:17,509 --> 00:22:19,119
That's the final element of there.

878
00:22:19,119 --> 00:22:20,190
So now we've got everything

879
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:20,720
included.

880
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,670
We've got a full script.

881
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,339
We can make any refinements or

882
00:22:23,369 --> 00:22:24,319
adjustments.

883
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:25,269
So I can say to her, for instance,

884
00:22:25,319 --> 00:22:26,220
like I want to remove the

885
00:22:26,329 --> 00:22:27,119
mentioning,

886
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:28,720
you know, from one of my videos.

887
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:29,619
Something like going from being a

888
00:22:29,619 --> 00:22:31,039
death metal vocalist to running

889
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:31,519
agencies.

890
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:32,710
And you can kind of change

891
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:33,839
wherever you want.

892
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:34,920
But overall, we can get all this

893
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,160
copy now into a Google Doc.

894
00:22:36,329 --> 00:22:37,349
And you've got a full script

895
00:22:37,779 --> 00:22:38,799
pretty much ready to go.

896
00:22:39,059 --> 00:22:40,599
This is optimized based on

897
00:22:40,599 --> 00:22:43,039
Brian's, you know, his templates

898
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:44,400
and his formatting.

899
00:22:44,579 --> 00:22:46,160
And he's got incredible results,

900
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,440
you know, running a YouTube

901
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:47,839
agency.

902
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:49,029
So he knows what he's talking

903
00:22:49,329 --> 00:22:49,519
about.

904
00:22:49,559 --> 00:22:51,359
So this is the easiest way to,

905
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:52,640
without any previous experience,

906
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:53,829
write YouTube scripts that are

907
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:55,039
going to get results.

908
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:56,220
If you do this for, you know, the

909
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,920
next, you know, 10 videos,

910
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,000
I guarantee you're going to book

911
00:22:59,000 --> 00:22:59,680
leads off these.

912
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:01,839
So hopefully this is helpful.

913
00:23:02,039 --> 00:23:03,029
This is kind of a long video.

914
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:03,799
I'm going to cut it down a little

915
00:23:03,869 --> 00:23:04,160
bit, maybe.

916
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:07,119
But it gives the idea of how you

917
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:08,460
can use Poppy to create content on

918
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:09,680
autopilot.

919
00:23:09,859 --> 00:23:10,859
This is really, as you saw, most

920
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:11,900
of what I did here was just typing

921
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:12,000
in

922
00:23:12,259 --> 00:23:13,099
continue after giving up my

923
00:23:13,099 --> 00:23:13,680
information.

924
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,559
And then I'll do some quick

925
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:15,680
editing afterwards to kind of, you

926
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:15,839
know,

927
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:17,029
make it exactly how I want it to

928
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:18,960
sound a bit more like me.

929
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:19,630
And we're good to go.

930
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:21,900
So highly suggest using Poppy for

931
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:22,559
this.

932
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:23,480
Highly suggest using Brian's

933
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:23,839
template,

934
00:23:24,089 --> 00:23:25,029
which you can find the template

935
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:27,119
section on Poppy and let

936
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:27,759
Let me know how it goes for you

937
00:23:27,759 --> 00:23:28,279
guys, right?

938
00:23:28,279 --> 00:23:29,480
So see you in the next one.

939
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:30,319
Peace.
