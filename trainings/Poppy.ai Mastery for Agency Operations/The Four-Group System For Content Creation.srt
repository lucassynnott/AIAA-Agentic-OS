1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,990
Okay.

2
00:00:01,139 --> 00:00:02,339
So in this video, I'm going to

3
00:00:02,339 --> 00:00:03,700
show you guys how to create

4
00:00:03,879 --> 00:00:05,599
content in Poppy AI that is in

5
00:00:05,599 --> 00:00:07,910
your particular voice and style.

6
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:09,080
This is obviously one of the

7
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:10,640
hardest parts of AI, you know,

8
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,000
that very kind of common AI

9
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,470
speaking style is like super

10
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:15,240
awkward and stilted and weird.

11
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,989
This is going to show you how to

12
00:00:16,989 --> 00:00:18,879
use Poppy to train the AI to speak

13
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:20,170
exactly like you do.

14
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,239
And the way we're going to do that

15
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:24,410
is there's an existing template in

16
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:25,809
the Poppy AI template section

17
00:00:25,809 --> 00:00:27,019
called voice clone template.

18
00:00:27,019 --> 00:00:28,760
And this creates essentially a

19
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:29,980
prompt that tells the AI

20
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:31,640
how you how you speak and how it

21
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,350
should write all content going

22
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:34,009
forward.

23
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:35,500
And it's very simple how this

24
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:35,939
works.

25
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:37,479
So you've got a section here is

26
00:00:37,479 --> 00:00:39,340
called voice cloner, my content.

27
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:40,929
And then we've got instructions

28
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:41,619
over here.

29
00:00:41,619 --> 00:00:43,060
So all we need to do is get some

30
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:44,420
of our existing content.

31
00:00:44,509 --> 00:00:45,759
This does only need to have

32
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:47,200
examples of you speaking.

33
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,000
So if that's, you know, you're you

34
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,679
can add some audio notes, you can

35
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:52,420
add some videos recorded anything

36
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:53,520
of you speaking.

37
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,229
So if I go over here to my YouTube

38
00:00:55,299 --> 00:00:57,210
channel, I'm going to grab some of

39
00:00:57,549 --> 00:00:58,179
these here.

40
00:00:58,179 --> 00:00:59,960
And we're going to put these in

41
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,469
into the box here into the box

42
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:01,960
here.

43
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,819
Just grab this.

44
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:07,640
Then we'll grab this one.

45
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,159
And we're looking for here is just

46
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:12,180
examples of how you sound and talk

47
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:12,849
and the kind of, you know,

48
00:01:12,849 --> 00:01:14,010
language you use and things like

49
00:01:14,099 --> 00:01:14,400
that.

50
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,959
Just to help personalize your

51
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:19,209
other types of content.

52
00:01:19,299 --> 00:01:21,959
So let's grab all of these.

53
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:24,719
And I got some of the shorts I've

54
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:25,650
done too.

55
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:28,629
The more you have, the better it

56
00:01:28,739 --> 00:01:29,870
will work.

57
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:31,620
So I'm going to put about six

58
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:32,959
videos in here.

59
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:40,870
So with all of our content in

60
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:48,250
there, what we're going to do is

61
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:54,959
we're going to copy the prompts

62
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:55,959
from here and put these in.

63
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:58,730
Let's take both of these and drop

64
00:01:58,730 --> 00:01:59,959
down here.

65
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:04,950
And then we send it in.

66
00:02:04,989 --> 00:02:06,569
And this should now create our

67
00:02:06,569 --> 00:02:07,959
voice clone template.

68
00:02:08,788 --> 00:02:17,960
So this is a quick context.

69
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,960
This is normal.

70
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,469
Uh, in smaller focus chunks, we

71
00:02:21,509 --> 00:02:22,400
really build a little larger

72
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:22,870
section.

73
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:23,960
So now some of the tone of mood to

74
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:23,960
get section three locked in.

75
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,639
It's very direct cut to BS energy

76
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:26,889
and scale of one cent.

77
00:02:26,979 --> 00:02:28,419
How important is maintaining the

78
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:28,960
bulldogs here.

79
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,919
Sometimes being more diplomatic.

80
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,960
Uh, so we'll say for number one,

81
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:36,050
uh, say seven, you can be

82
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:39,900
diplomatic sometimes, but we like

83
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:40,960
to be direct.

84
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,949
Two.

85
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,319
I noticed these phrases like

86
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:44,960
something to visit good for us.

87
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,500
It's a tough approach.

88
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,150
It's something you want to

89
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,960
maintain across all content types,

90
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:51,960
not across all content types.

91
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,960
Only when appropriate.

92
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,960
It's teaching tactical skills.

93
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,599
It's just to be more

94
00:02:56,599 --> 00:02:57,919
instructional, but still casual.

95
00:02:58,009 --> 00:02:58,960
Do you want to maintain different

96
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,889
modes for different content type?

97
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,580
Yes, I would like to maintain

98
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:05,310
different modes for different

99
00:03:05,389 --> 00:03:06,960
content types.

100
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,900
How do you want to handle those

101
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,370
who need you more empathetic or

102
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:10,909
sensitive while still maintaining

103
00:03:11,009 --> 00:03:11,960
your authentic voice?

104
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,889
Um, do you want to empathetic?

105
00:03:14,969 --> 00:03:18,159
Uh, I would just say speak in a

106
00:03:18,169 --> 00:03:22,909
clear, direct, but understanding

107
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:26,960
way.

108
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:31,960
I'm going to send that.

109
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,280
So it's going to keep going.

110
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:36,960
Language style and preferences.

111
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,050
I noticed you use casual language,

112
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:39,199
like peace, a sign off and phrases

113
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:39,960
like, let's check it out.

114
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,050
Do you want to maintain that

115
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:42,349
conversational style across all

116
00:03:42,409 --> 00:03:42,889
content?

117
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,960
Yes.

118
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,960
So I do.

119
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,389
And use shorter, punchy sentences

120
00:03:47,389 --> 00:03:48,889
makes it longer explanatory ones.

121
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:50,080
Is this rhythm intentional for

122
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:50,960
keeping attention?

123
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,960
Yes, I do that.

124
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,180
Uh, I see probably use you when

125
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:55,419
addressing your audience and I

126
00:03:55,419 --> 00:03:56,659
when sharing personal experience

127
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:57,960
just to be consistent.

128
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,960
Yes, it should.

129
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,710
Are there any specific words or

130
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:02,460
phrases you absolutely want to

131
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:03,960
avoid in your content?

132
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:12,110
Uh, game changer or let's dive in,

133
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:15,960
uh, or any corporate jargon.

134
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,879
What's your preference on

135
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:18,889
profanity?

136
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:19,910
You know, just keep it clean in

137
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:21,040
tutorials with stronger language,

138
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:21,920
motivational contents.

139
00:04:22,009 --> 00:04:24,839
Profanity is okay, but used

140
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:25,959
sparingly.

141
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:36,040
So signature expression questions.

142
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:36,910
Those existing and views of peace.

143
00:04:37,009 --> 00:04:37,620
Is this preferred sign of across

144
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:37,959
all content?

145
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:38,959
It actually is.

146
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:39,620
Yes.

147
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:40,959
Yes, it is.

148
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:41,500
You often use less.

149
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:41,959
Check it out.

150
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:42,459
And here's the thing is

151
00:04:42,459 --> 00:04:42,839
transitions.

152
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:44,689
Are these core phrases you want to

153
00:04:44,829 --> 00:04:45,209
maintain?

154
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:45,509
Yes.

155
00:04:45,509 --> 00:04:46,959
Do you have any other go to phrase

156
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:47,959
for opening content?

157
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:52,949
Uh, no go to phrases vary as you

158
00:04:52,949 --> 00:04:53,920
see fit.

159
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:54,860
Any specific ways like to

160
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:55,920
introduce tutorials versus

161
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,889
motivational content?

162
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:57,959
No specific way.

163
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:00,110
Size P.

164
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:01,339
See if other probates drop up

165
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:02,560
different, uh, thing.

166
00:05:02,569 --> 00:05:02,959
Yeah.

167
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:05,870
Uh, see you in the next one.

168
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:05,959
Bye.

169
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:08,740
You guys will notice some of these

170
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:11,399
in the, uh, tutorials that I'm

171
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:11,959
doing.

172
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:12,949
Okay.

173
00:05:13,089 --> 00:05:14,829
So now we're into storytelling and

174
00:05:14,829 --> 00:05:15,959
style questions.

175
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:17,519
You frequently share personal

176
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:18,629
stories to make points.

177
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:19,870
How important is being personal

178
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,959
experience to your content?

179
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:22,439
Yes.

180
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:26,189
This is important, especially on

181
00:05:26,189 --> 00:05:29,199
social content, but not all the

182
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:29,959
time.

183
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:30,600
Any specific examples and case

184
00:05:30,769 --> 00:05:32,019
studies should concrete results

185
00:05:32,019 --> 00:05:33,959
always be included and possible

186
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:37,610
when possible and the facts are

187
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:41,959
provided or verifiable.

188
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:43,310
Here seems dry in situation rather

189
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:43,959
for us jokes.

190
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:46,620
Uh, yes, that is the right

191
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:47,920
approach.

192
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:48,949
For emphasis.

193
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:50,009
I see you use things like C and

194
00:05:50,009 --> 00:05:50,889
direct statements.

195
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:52,639
You afraid this over all caps or

196
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:53,959
excessive punctuation.

197
00:05:54,829 --> 00:05:58,220
Uh, yes, but a, but all caps is

198
00:05:58,259 --> 00:05:58,959
okay.

199
00:05:58,959 --> 00:05:59,959
Sometimes too.

200
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:01,379
You often structure content with

201
00:06:01,379 --> 00:06:02,889
clear step-by-step breakdowns.

202
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:04,959
Is this a sort of approach?

203
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:07,870
Uh, some, some points too.

204
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,959
Uh, portrait teaching style.

205
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:15,959
Yes, it is.

206
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:16,430
Okay.

207
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:17,959
So grammar formatting.

208
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:19,959
Those use contractions naturally.

209
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:21,230
Should this casual grammar style

210
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:21,920
be maintained?

211
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:21,959
Yes.

212
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:23,959
What's actually pretty standard?

213
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:24,889
Is this your preference?

214
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,959
Yes.

215
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:27,220
Can you describe clear headers,

216
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,329
bullet points over the list of

217
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:28,889
tutorials?

218
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:29,959
Uh, yes.

219
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:30,970
Do you have any specific

220
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:32,189
preferences for how you want

221
00:06:32,189 --> 00:06:33,959
headings formatted or capitalized?

222
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:34,959
No.

223
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:35,860
Any grammar rules you

224
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:36,920
intentionally break for

225
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,589
conversational flow, like starting

226
00:06:38,589 --> 00:06:39,959
sentences with an and or but?

227
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:40,949
Uh, yes.

228
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:42,889
Sometimes use but to start a

229
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:43,959
sentence.

230
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,959
Almost there.

231
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:52,959
Okay.

232
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:54,959
Uh, final questions.

233
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:56,029
We need to shift from casual

234
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,199
social motivational to a more

235
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:57,889
serious topic.

236
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:58,959
Any specific guidelines?

237
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:01,959
No specific guidelines.

238
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:03,430
Are there any topics that

239
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:05,540
absolutely won't cover any special

240
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:06,959
handling handling?

241
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:08,959
Um, no.

242
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:10,480
Any interesting disclaimers you

243
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:10,959
need?

244
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:12,959
No.

245
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:12,959
Uh, not really.

246
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:13,949
Uh, not really.

247
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:13,959
No.

248
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:15,079
What's your stance on giving

249
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:16,439
direct business financial advice

250
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:17,959
for sharing personal experience?

251
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:19,209
I prefer to share personal

252
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:22,319
experience, but I'm happy to

253
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,259
explain, uh, insights or

254
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:27,959
information.

255
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:30,879
I have seen work for myself and

256
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:31,959
others.

257
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:35,660
Uh, any cultural reference to

258
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:37,670
industry terms?

259
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:40,939
Uh, no, not particularly.

260
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:41,949
Uh, no.

261
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:43,959
I am from Ireland though.

262
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:45,959
So consider that.

263
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:48,889
Also, my name is Lucas Synod.

264
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:49,949
It's pulling my name wrong.

265
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:49,959
There we go.

266
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:49,959
So I got the full thing all done.

267
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:49,959
Great.

268
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:49,959
So I'm ready to share with chat

269
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:49,959
too.

270
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:50,949
So how does this work?

271
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:51,949
Now we're going to take this.

272
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:52,949
And one of the prompts below.

273
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:53,949
We're going to take this.

274
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:54,949
And one of the prompts below.

275
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:55,639
And we are going to give this to a

276
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:55,949
new chat.

277
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:56,689
So I'm just going to open a new

278
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:56,949
chat.

279
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:56,959
Okay.

280
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:57,689
So I'm just going to open a new

281
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:57,949
chat.

282
00:07:57,959 --> 00:07:58,949
So I'm going to open a new chat.

283
00:07:58,959 --> 00:07:59,949
Okay.

284
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:00,949
Okay.

285
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:07,959
Uh, a new poppy window for this.

286
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:08,949
Okay.

287
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:09,949
Okay.

288
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:10,949
Okay.

289
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:11,949
Okay.

290
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:12,949
Okay.

291
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:13,949
Great.

292
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:15,959
So ready to share with chat too.

293
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:16,949
So how does this work?

294
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:18,959
Now we're going to take this.

295
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:21,889
And one of the prompts below.

296
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:23,370
And we are going to give this to a

297
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:23,959
new chat.

298
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:25,959
So I'm just going to open a new,

299
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:29,959
uh, a new poppy window for this.

300
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:31,980
And we are going to go to the

301
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:32,889
example.

302
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,320
We just showed it a few moments

303
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,889
ago, writing email sequences.

304
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,230
So now we're going to add a fourth

305
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:38,889
group.

306
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:42,269
And the fourth group is for brand

307
00:08:42,298 --> 00:08:42,960
voice.

308
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:47,730
Lucas Sennett's brand voice and

309
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:49,960
speaking style.

310
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,950
Okay.

311
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,490
Now we're going to open a text

312
00:08:52,549 --> 00:08:52,960
box.

313
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,330
We're going to paste in that

314
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:56,960
prompt we just got.

315
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,950
Put that there.

316
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,240
Let's make this bigger because

317
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,960
we're ready to put another one in.

318
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,950
There.

319
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,889
Let's go back to our first one.

320
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:10,909
Now we're going to include this as

321
00:09:10,909 --> 00:09:11,960
well.

322
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:17,960
another text box.

323
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:18,960
Based.

324
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,889
Put that in there.

325
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,960
And connect this up.

326
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:28,960
Now, our original thing was good.

327
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,110
So we're going to copy this, but

328
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:31,330
we're going to change this up a

329
00:09:31,409 --> 00:09:31,889
little bit.

330
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,580
We're going to say same thing, use

331
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:39,870
the brand voice profile in your

332
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:43,960
knowledge base to write

333
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:48,960
all content in the style of Lucas

334
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,919
Sennett.

335
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,220
And now the versions of the emails

336
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:54,320
we get should match closer to my

337
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,960
general speaking style and tone of

338
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:02,960
voice.

339
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,950
Yeah.

340
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,950
These are more like me.

341
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,960
So, hey, Lucas here.

342
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,000
Just had a call with a homeware

343
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:07,960
brand owner yesterday.

344
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,289
Guy was frustrated because email

345
00:10:09,289 --> 00:10:10,480
marketing was basically dead

346
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:10,889
weight.

347
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,490
15% open rates, barely any clicks

348
00:10:12,549 --> 00:10:13,889
and his automated flow is bringing

349
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:14,960
in maybe 2k a month.

350
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,950
Here's the thing.

351
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,049
Most income brands treat email

352
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:17,960
like an afterthought.

353
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,460
They set up some basic welcome

354
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:20,500
series, throw in a few product

355
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,389
pushes and wonder why they're not

356
00:10:21,389 --> 00:10:21,960
seeing results.

357
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,220
Here's what we did for this brand

358
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:23,960
in 30 days.

359
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,950
The difference.

360
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,000
We stopped sending generic buyer

361
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:27,049
stuff emails and started sending

362
00:10:27,049 --> 00:10:27,960
emails that actually help people.

363
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,480
Look, your customers aren't

364
00:10:29,549 --> 00:10:30,370
sitting around waiting for your

365
00:10:30,409 --> 00:10:30,889
next sales pitch.

366
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:31,740
They're dealing with real

367
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:32,960
problems, making tough decisions,

368
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,889
trying to figure out if your

369
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:35,620
product is actually worth their

370
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:35,960
money.

371
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,210
When you answer those questions

372
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:38,580
before they ask them, everything

373
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:38,960
changes.

374
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,840
Tomorrow, I'll show you the

375
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:40,960
biggest mistakes I see brands make

376
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,070
with their subject lines and why

377
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:42,960
it's killing your open rates.

378
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,259
If you haven't booked a call yet,

379
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:44,960
here's the link.

380
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,570
Peace, Lucas Center from

381
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:45,950
Innovative.

382
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,970
That homeware brand, they're now

383
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:47,960
one of our best case studies.

384
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,419
Book a call if you want to be

385
00:10:49,419 --> 00:10:49,960
next.

386
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,960
This sounds much more like me.

387
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,480
This is like, that's an email, but

388
00:10:53,549 --> 00:10:54,889
I could read that as like a script

389
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:55,960
or a voice note or something like

390
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:55,960
that.

391
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,159
And it would sound much closer to

392
00:10:58,169 --> 00:10:59,960
how I speak generally.

393
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,009
So I suggest you always, if you're

394
00:11:02,009 --> 00:11:04,120
using poppy to write content, go

395
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,919
create your brand voice profile.

396
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,129
It'll save you a ton of time in

397
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,590
terms of prompting and trying to

398
00:11:08,649 --> 00:11:10,220
alter stuff to match more how you

399
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:10,960
want it to sound.

400
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,350
You do that process once and then

401
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:13,529
you can copy and paste those

402
00:11:13,529 --> 00:11:15,710
prompts into any other content

403
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:16,960
creation board that you have.

404
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,960
Super, super useful.

405
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,600
I think that the this system as

406
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,429
well that I have here is something

407
00:11:22,429 --> 00:11:24,200
that I think you guys should take

408
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:24,919
note of.

409
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:28,220
I generally always try and do four

410
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,960
groups email.

411
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,309
So the first one will be whatever

412
00:11:31,309 --> 00:11:32,559
it is you want poppy to know how

413
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:32,889
to do.

414
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,950
This was a VSL writer.

415
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,759
We would have VSL writing content

416
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:36,889
in the first group.

417
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,950
This is an email sequence writers.

418
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,960
We've got email sequence content.

419
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,470
Essentially YouTube is now your

420
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:42,889
open source knowledge base.

421
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,259
You can get any videos from people

422
00:11:44,269 --> 00:11:45,440
that are trusted that know what

423
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,659
they're doing that explain

424
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:47,960
everything in detail.

425
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,399
And you can now have an AI know

426
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:50,889
everything that they know.

427
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,259
You can take a ton of Alex from

428
00:11:52,259 --> 00:11:53,889
those videos and put them in here.

429
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,220
And now you've got an AI Alex from

430
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:56,500
those you can talk to anytime you

431
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:56,889
want.

432
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,480
So the first group is everything

433
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,889
that you wanted to know how to do

434
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:00,960
the actual skill.

435
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,490
The second one is details about

436
00:12:02,549 --> 00:12:02,960
you.

437
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,480
So here you could include

438
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,440
everything from your website to

439
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,960
some of your content.

440
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,460
I highly suggest doing a creative

441
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:10,740
brief for your company in the

442
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:11,960
client ascension course.

443
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,960
You will see under the VSL section

444
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,269
a video from Nick Burge explaining

445
00:12:15,269 --> 00:12:15,960
how to do that.

446
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:16,950
Definitely do that.

447
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,769
Then you will have your brand

448
00:12:18,769 --> 00:12:19,889
voice profile.

449
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:20,950
That should be the same.

450
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,470
Once you do it once you have the

451
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:23,830
same thing over and over again

452
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:24,960
across all your content boards.

453
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,259
And then finally your output

454
00:12:26,269 --> 00:12:27,889
instructions where you use this to

455
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:30,250
tweak the outputs you get, maybe

456
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,539
make them longer, shorter, more

457
00:12:31,539 --> 00:12:31,960
complex, whatever you want.

458
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,309
These are the rules that you give

459
00:12:33,309 --> 00:12:34,730
the AI to follow every single time

460
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:35,960
that it writes content.

461
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:39,110
That's the four group method that

462
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:40,960
I tend to follow.

463
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:41,889
And I find that it works really

464
00:12:41,889 --> 00:12:42,710
well no matter what type of

465
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:43,590
content that you're trying to

466
00:12:43,649 --> 00:12:44,960
make.

467
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,960
Hope this is useful.

468
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,970
I think that Poppy is the most

469
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,110
powerful tool out there to write

470
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:50,419
content in your voice and style

471
00:12:50,419 --> 00:12:51,960
that actually gets results.

472
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,779
And it's the easiest way to take

473
00:12:53,779 --> 00:12:55,649
people that are already doing well

474
00:12:55,809 --> 00:12:57,320
with their content and figure out

475
00:12:57,389 --> 00:12:57,960
how they're doing it.

476
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,320
And, you know, jack their whole

477
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,889
kind of, you know, flow and style.

478
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,990
And that's, you know, best way to

479
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,970
get ahead and best way to generate

480
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:05,960
more views.

481
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,330
So hopefully this was helpful for

482
00:13:08,409 --> 00:13:08,889
you.

483
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,490
And I will see you in the next

484
00:13:10,549 --> 00:13:10,960
one.

485
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:11,950
Peace.
