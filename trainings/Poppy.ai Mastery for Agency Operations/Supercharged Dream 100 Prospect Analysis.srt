1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01,080
What's up guys, Lucas here.

2
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:03,160
So one of the outreach methods

3
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:03,859
you're going to be learning in

4
00:00:03,859 --> 00:00:03,960
this

5
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:05,790
program is called dream 100.

6
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:06,990
Now there'll be a detailed

7
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:08,779
explanation of this further down.

8
00:00:08,779 --> 00:00:09,970
But a

9
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:11,419
quick summary is essentially you

10
00:00:11,509 --> 00:00:12,839
make a list of your 100 dream

11
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,460
prospects, and then you reach out

12
00:00:14,589 --> 00:00:16,329
to them manually, usually via DM,

13
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:17,940
and you offer them a finished

14
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:19,780
deliverable that is relevant to

15
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:20,160
them.

16
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,420
So one of the most important

17
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:22,789
things about this is going to be

18
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:24,260
researching your prospects

19
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:26,210
and, you know, making sure that

20
00:00:26,219 --> 00:00:28,179
your outreach doesn't seem, you

21
00:00:28,179 --> 00:00:30,070
know, too automated or awkward

22
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:31,480
or anything like that.

23
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,109
So I'm going to show you a basic

24
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:35,219
dream 100 ICP first line writer

25
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:35,710
here in

26
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:36,170
Poppy.

27
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:37,689
And essentially what this will do

28
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,229
is you will give some information

29
00:00:39,229 --> 00:00:40,270
on your prospect links

30
00:00:40,429 --> 00:00:41,429
to their social profile, if

31
00:00:41,429 --> 00:00:42,549
they've got YouTube videos,

32
00:00:42,549 --> 00:00:43,350
anything like that.

33
00:00:43,409 --> 00:00:44,189
And this will help

34
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,310
you write really good first lines

35
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:48,159
for your opening DM to them.

36
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,979
So let's take a look here.

37
00:00:49,979 --> 00:00:51,009
As I've

38
00:00:51,219 --> 00:00:52,009
set this up with this board

39
00:00:52,009 --> 00:00:53,149
already, I'm just going to walk

40
00:00:53,149 --> 00:00:54,140
through what we have here.

41
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:54,359
And

42
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:55,479
then I'm going to show you how

43
00:00:55,659 --> 00:00:56,899
we're going to make this work.

44
00:00:56,909 --> 00:00:58,890
So we have three groups, the dream

45
00:00:59,009 --> 00:00:59,250
100

46
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:00,280
prospects group, this is where

47
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,100
we'll put the social media

48
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:02,270
profiles, the people you want to

49
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:02,719
contact

50
00:01:02,859 --> 00:01:04,069
the system prompt, where I just

51
00:01:04,209 --> 00:01:05,370
put the system prompt, I'll go

52
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:06,340
over now in a second.

53
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:06,920
And then

54
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:08,049
there'll be information about me.

55
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,159
And this is so that it will have

56
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:10,219
an idea of your offer and what you

57
00:01:10,359 --> 00:01:10,579
do.

58
00:01:10,579 --> 00:01:12,450
So let's take a look first at the

59
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:13,549
system prompt.

60
00:01:13,549 --> 00:01:15,540
The system prompt says you are a

61
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:16,560
detailed ICP

62
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:18,359
researcher and first line writer,

63
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:20,159
you find key information, details

64
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:21,659
and updates about people in

65
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:23,260
dream 100 prospects and write a

66
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:24,500
personalized first line DM,

67
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,120
mentioning something about them in

68
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:26,209
a

69
00:01:26,359 --> 00:01:27,340
positive manner before pitching

70
00:01:27,609 --> 00:01:28,719
your services, then follow up with

71
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:29,920
a relevant piece of work created

72
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:31,379
specifically for them.

73
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,140
Like I made you this because I saw

74
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:34,250
x on your profile.

75
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:35,400
That's a very basic,

76
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:37,390
you know, first line kind of

77
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:38,140
format.

78
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,290
You're going to be getting some

79
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:42,060
details later on about kind of,

80
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:42,909
you know, the ultimate way to

81
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:43,620
dream 100.

82
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:44,579
So you might want to modify this

83
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:45,400
system prompt a little

84
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:45,760
bit.

85
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,409
But this is the basic one that I'm

86
00:01:47,409 --> 00:01:48,700
going to go with today.

87
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,750
So first, we need to get our ICP

88
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:51,879
social profiles.

89
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:53,459
Now, I am going to go with our

90
00:01:53,459 --> 00:01:55,290
good friend and client ascension

91
00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:56,569
Mario Lanzarotti.

92
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:57,930
And I'm just going to copy his

93
00:01:58,090 --> 00:01:58,780
LinkedIn here.

94
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,349
Now, for now, I'm just gonna use

95
00:02:00,349 --> 00:02:01,109
his LinkedIn,

96
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:02,989
but I could go and grab YouTube

97
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:04,950
videos of speeches he's done.

98
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,579
I could grab his YouTube

99
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:07,700
account in general, grab his

100
00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:08,710
Twitter and like that.

101
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:09,949
But we're just going to start off

102
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:10,439
with his

103
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:11,409
LinkedIn because Mario is very

104
00:02:11,409 --> 00:02:12,389
active on LinkedIn and post a lot

105
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:12,740
on there.

106
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,610
So there's some content

107
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:14,289
to work with.

108
00:02:14,289 --> 00:02:15,469
Then we're going to get some

109
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:16,560
information about me.

110
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,800
And for this, I'm just going to

111
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:17,939
choose

112
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:18,750
two things.

113
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,360
This one video that I've used

114
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,050
across nearly all other poppy

115
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:22,759
boards.

116
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:24,400
And we're going to paste

117
00:02:24,539 --> 00:02:25,530
this in here.

118
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:28,800
And then my website shows the idea

119
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,520
about my offer.

120
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,599
So we're going to type that in

121
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:33,129
there.

122
00:02:33,129 --> 00:02:34,710
We're gonna let that load.

123
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:36,360
Now, as you can see, Mario's

124
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,810
profile is loaded here.

125
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:38,550
And my website

126
00:02:38,699 --> 00:02:41,129
should load here momentarily.

127
00:02:41,129 --> 00:02:42,219
There we go.

128
00:02:42,219 --> 00:02:44,509
So now what we're going to say is

129
00:02:44,689 --> 00:02:46,169
follow your system

130
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:49,349
instructions and write a

131
00:02:49,349 --> 00:02:53,659
personalized first line or a DM to

132
00:02:53,659 --> 00:02:57,460
the person in the dream 100

133
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:58,599
prospects

134
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:00,580
group.

135
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:05,099
Write the message from me, Lucas

136
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:08,879
Sennett tailored to my offer.

137
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:09,819
Now, if you have already

138
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,939
decided what deliverables you're

139
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:12,099
going to be giving, you'll still

140
00:03:12,099 --> 00:03:13,020
mention that you'll say,

141
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:14,560
write the message from me, your

142
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:16,219
name, offering them whatever the

143
00:03:16,219 --> 00:03:17,199
deliverable is.

144
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:17,740
But for now,

145
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:18,509
I'm just going to let it create a

146
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,379
deliverable that I'm supposedly

147
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:20,199
going to deliver to Mario.

148
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:21,599
So we're going to hit enter.

149
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,180
Based information from your

150
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:24,610
knowledge base, here's a

151
00:03:24,669 --> 00:03:26,439
personalized first line DM from

152
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:27,210
Mario Lanzarotti.

153
00:03:27,389 --> 00:03:28,389
Hey, Mario, just saw your article

154
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:29,750
series, how I overcame self-dead

155
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,159
and created the life of my dreams.

156
00:03:31,289 --> 00:03:32,289
The journey from corporate success

157
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:33,310
to finding truthful and

158
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:34,580
re-presonated with me, especially

159
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:34,740
your

160
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:35,810
insight that most finders get

161
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:36,789
stuck, not because of a bad

162
00:03:36,789 --> 00:03:37,860
strategy, because of deeper

163
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:38,360
blocks.

164
00:03:38,389 --> 00:03:39,389
I'm Lucas from Innovative, and I

165
00:03:39,389 --> 00:03:40,400
specialize in helping coaching

166
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,370
consultants like yourself

167
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:42,349
and more of their audience through

168
00:03:42,349 --> 00:03:43,259
high converting landing pages,

169
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:43,919
email marketing.

170
00:03:43,949 --> 00:03:44,770
I noticed you're building your

171
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,629
coaching practice around the

172
00:03:45,629 --> 00:03:46,639
Zenpreneur method, and I actually

173
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:47,759
created a custom landing page

174
00:03:48,139 --> 00:03:49,090
welcome specifically for your

175
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:50,430
work-life cohesion approach,

176
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:50,819
because

177
00:03:50,849 --> 00:03:51,669
I saw how you're positioning

178
00:03:51,699 --> 00:03:52,689
yourself differently from just

179
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:53,659
typical business coaches.

180
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,830
But you'd be able to be sending it

181
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:55,180
over.

182
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:56,090
I think you'd find the conversion

183
00:03:56,099 --> 00:03:56,909
psychology behind it pretty

184
00:03:56,909 --> 00:03:58,060
interesting, especially if you're

185
00:03:58,199 --> 00:03:59,020
someone who understands the

186
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:00,139
mindset side as well as you do.

187
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:00,979
Best, Lucas.

188
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:01,919
This is actually solid.

189
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,039
It's a little bit too formal.

190
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:06,430
So I might say, write it more

191
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:10,259
direct and casual, emulating my

192
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,319
speaking style from the YouTube

193
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:16,970
transcript in what I call this

194
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,879
group.

195
00:04:19,939 --> 00:04:20,779
And this one.

196
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:26,980
So.

197
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,410
Hey Mario, sorry for yourself in

198
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,990
overcoming self-doubt and creating

199
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:30,939
the life of your dreams.

200
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:31,959
A whole dream corporate defining

201
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:32,889
actual fulfillment hits different

202
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:33,939
when you've been there yourself.

203
00:04:34,019 --> 00:04:34,790
I'm Lucas.

204
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:35,689
I run Innovative, where we build

205
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:36,629
high converting landing pages to

206
00:04:36,629 --> 00:04:37,490
email systems for coaches.

207
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:38,449
Notice you're doing the Zenpreneur

208
00:04:38,449 --> 00:04:39,389
thing, which is pretty cool.

209
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:40,370
Most business coaches just for

210
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:41,269
gird shape, the same hustle

211
00:04:41,269 --> 00:04:41,699
nonsense.

212
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:42,829
Look, I made you a landing page

213
00:04:42,829 --> 00:04:43,939
mock-up because I saw how you're

214
00:04:43,939 --> 00:04:44,910
positioning the work-life

215
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:45,860
cohesion angle of thought you'd

216
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:46,800
want to see how to convert more of

217
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:47,120
your audience

218
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:47,639
to that message.

219
00:04:47,769 --> 00:04:48,339
Want me to send it over?

220
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:48,800
Lucas.

221
00:04:48,939 --> 00:04:49,899
That's pretty solid.

222
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,300
Again, I could use my brand voice

223
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:52,600
profile to be created in some of

224
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,439
the other previous

225
00:04:53,579 --> 00:04:55,560
modules in order to make this even

226
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,279
better.

227
00:04:56,439 --> 00:04:57,839
But for now, this is pretty solid.

228
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:59,329
And this is to show you kind of

229
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,000
how you would set up this board in

230
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,560
order to do this at scale.

231
00:05:02,649 --> 00:05:03,610
So you could put a ton of Dream

232
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:05,069
100 Prospects in there and get it

233
00:05:05,069 --> 00:05:05,839
to run through the whole

234
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:06,160
list.

235
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,600
But this is the basic idea behind

236
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,100
it.

237
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,519
Again, you will put three groups,

238
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:11,939
Dream 100 Prospects, System

239
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,540
Prompt, and Information About

240
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:13,920
You.

241
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:16,459
Then Dream 100 Prospects will

242
00:05:16,459 --> 00:05:17,829
include the links to the social

243
00:05:17,889 --> 00:05:18,980
media of the people that

244
00:05:19,089 --> 00:05:19,720
you want to contact.

245
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:20,850
System Prompt is a system prompt

246
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:21,939
similar to this.

247
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:23,069
You're a detailed ICP researcher

248
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:24,439
and first-line writer.

249
00:05:24,569 --> 00:05:25,870
You find key information, details,

250
00:05:25,949 --> 00:05:27,100
and updates about people in Dream

251
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:28,360
100 Prospects and write

252
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:29,370
a personalized first-line DM

253
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:30,569
mentioning something about them in

254
00:05:30,569 --> 00:05:31,800
a positive manner before pitching

255
00:05:31,939 --> 00:05:32,339
your services.

256
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,279
Then follow up with a relevant

257
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:34,420
piece of work created specifically

258
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:35,259
for them, like I made you

259
00:05:35,389 --> 00:05:35,980
this because I saw X in your

260
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:36,360
profile.

261
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,740
Then some information about you,

262
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,269
your website, some YouTube videos,

263
00:05:39,269 --> 00:05:40,319
whatever you got on you.

264
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:41,610
If you've got a creative brief,

265
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:42,850
which hopefully you will, then

266
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:44,120
I'll throw that in there too.

267
00:05:44,259 --> 00:05:45,240
And then the prompt we give the

268
00:05:45,589 --> 00:05:46,629
system is just follow your system

269
00:05:46,629 --> 00:05:47,879
instructions and write a

270
00:05:48,019 --> 00:05:49,009
personalized first-line for a DM

271
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,370
to the person in the Dream 100

272
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:51,579
Prospects group with a message

273
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,620
from me that will send it to my

274
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:53,019
offer.

275
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,399
Then we just told her to be a bit

276
00:05:54,529 --> 00:05:55,980
more direct and casually editing

277
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:56,980
my speaking style.

278
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:58,889
So that's the basic idea behind

279
00:05:59,269 --> 00:05:59,560
this.

280
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,550
I think that this is a super

281
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:01,769
powerful way to, at scale, get

282
00:06:01,769 --> 00:06:02,959
your first lines written.

283
00:06:03,009 --> 00:06:04,079
I will put all of those in a

284
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,500
spreadsheet or something like

285
00:06:05,509 --> 00:06:07,060
that, and then just start manually

286
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,040
sending these out one by one.

287
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,620
But again, follow the training.

288
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,209
You'll see later on about Dream

289
00:06:11,209 --> 00:06:12,930
100 and how to do that whole

290
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:13,579
process.

291
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,240
And you'll be pretty much set.

292
00:06:15,339 --> 00:06:16,649
So this will speed up things a bit

293
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:17,110
for you.

294
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:18,180
But this is another example of how

295
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:18,759
great Poppy is.

296
00:06:18,899 --> 00:06:21,189
You can use it for content, for

297
00:06:21,189 --> 00:06:23,709
analysis, for situations like

298
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:24,459
this.

299
00:06:24,569 --> 00:06:25,870
We've got to mass create a bunch

300
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:27,470
of personalized information.

301
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,069
So Poppy is really, you know,

302
00:06:29,069 --> 00:06:31,000
limited by your own imagination.

303
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:32,769
And I highly suggest using it for,

304
00:06:32,769 --> 00:06:34,350
you know, other kind of things

305
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:35,720
like this as well as, you

306
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:36,850
know, writing your YouTube scripts

307
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:37,839
and things like that.

308
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:38,959
So hope this is helpful.

309
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,399
And I will see you in the next

310
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:40,819
one.

311
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:41,399
Peace.
