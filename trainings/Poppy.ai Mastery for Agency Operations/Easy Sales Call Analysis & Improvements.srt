1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,090
So guys, it's going to be a quick

2
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:01,439
one.

3
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:02,730
So this is just going to be

4
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:03,419
showing you

5
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:05,259
how you can use Poppy to analyze

6
00:00:05,259 --> 00:00:06,459
your sales calls.

7
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:07,450
This is going to be an important

8
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:07,589
part

9
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:08,609
of running an agency.

10
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:09,839
You'll want to be analyzing your

11
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:11,560
sales calls, figuring out why you

12
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:11,810
didn't

13
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:13,330
close or why you did close, what

14
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:14,650
you can do better for next time

15
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:16,070
and overall improve your sales

16
00:00:16,429 --> 00:00:16,890
abilities.

17
00:00:16,929 --> 00:00:18,440
So the easy way to do that is

18
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:20,429
using, again, an existing Poppy

19
00:00:20,429 --> 00:00:21,839
template called sales

20
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:22,510
call analysis.

21
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:23,760
This is in the template section in

22
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,809
Poppy, as I showed you in the

23
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:25,640
previous videos.

24
00:00:26,179 --> 00:00:27,219
So it's very simple.

25
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,600
The way this one works is use a

26
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,609
blow to your sales call

27
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:30,329
transcripts

28
00:00:30,379 --> 00:00:30,679
here.

29
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:31,780
These are already created and

30
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:32,560
linked up for you.

31
00:00:32,609 --> 00:00:34,969
You can also put in your offer

32
00:00:35,049 --> 00:00:35,299
down

33
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:36,539
here and give some information

34
00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:37,340
about your offer.

35
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:39,270
So what I'm just going to do

36
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:40,500
instead is just

37
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:42,159
link up, make a new group.

38
00:00:42,179 --> 00:00:43,929
I'm going to call it my offer and

39
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:45,880
I'm just going to put my website

40
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:48,960
to make it as easy as possible.

41
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,350
So we're going to add this in

42
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:54,659
here.

43
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,609
We'll connect it up.

44
00:00:56,609 --> 00:00:57,179
Of course, you have more

45
00:00:57,179 --> 00:00:57,539
information

46
00:00:57,770 --> 00:00:58,750
about your offer, but for now I'm

47
00:00:58,789 --> 00:00:59,880
just going to put that so it gets

48
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:00,880
an idea of what I do.

49
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:03,609
So all we have to do is just add

50
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:05,799
in our sales call transcripts.

51
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,099
So if I go here and I take

52
00:01:08,099 --> 00:01:09,400
an existing transcript that I

53
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,959
have, I'll just drag it in here.

54
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:11,530
It'll upload.

55
00:01:11,849 --> 00:01:13,260
We're going to drag

56
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:16,689
this over here and do this group.

57
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:19,010
And now the prompt is pre-written

58
00:01:19,019 --> 00:01:19,340
for us.

59
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:19,719
All we're going

60
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,489
to do is copy this and paste this

61
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:23,599
in here.

62
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:24,599
I might edit a little bit.

63
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:26,340
So, uh, you know,

64
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:28,500
series sales call with closer.

65
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,010
It's going to say Lucas and the

66
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:34,780
prospect, Travis, give me a

67
00:01:35,109 --> 00:01:39,569
contemplation why Lucas didn't

68
00:01:39,569 --> 00:01:40,939
close.

69
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:41,780
And there we go.

70
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:42,439
Right.

71
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:44,239
So we send that in and

72
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:45,450
now we're going to get a full

73
00:01:45,489 --> 00:01:46,939
detailed analysis of our sales

74
00:01:46,939 --> 00:01:48,219
call, uh, that will help us

75
00:01:48,219 --> 00:01:48,599
improve

76
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:50,579
for future, uh, calls.

77
00:01:50,689 --> 00:01:53,519
So there's actually a discovery

78
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:55,900
call, not a sales call.

79
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:56,200
So I would

80
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:57,340
explain it.

81
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:00,000
Um, uh, while pain point W is the

82
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,599
sale.

83
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:05,790
Uh, yeah, so good breakdown on

84
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:06,060
what we

85
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:07,319
could have done instead.

86
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:09,030
We should have done, um, goal

87
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:12,340
setting, all this sort of stuff.

88
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:12,659
This

89
00:02:12,659 --> 00:02:14,009
is a, a, uh, a super easy way to,

90
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:15,389
uh, again, this is, you know, not

91
00:02:15,449 --> 00:02:16,400
a good example because

92
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,860
this is not a sales call, but, uh,

93
00:02:17,969 --> 00:02:19,300
it's a pretty good, um, way of

94
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,280
analyzing your calls

95
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,539
and getting good feedback on what

96
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,400
you should do next.

97
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,259
So for any of you that are going

98
00:02:24,259 --> 00:02:24,340
to

99
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:25,379
be as part of this course, you are

100
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:26,460
obviously going to be signing

101
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:27,360
clients and taking sales

102
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:27,740
calls.

103
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:28,949
The first few you get, it'll be

104
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:30,280
very important for you to analyze

105
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:30,789
your first few

106
00:02:30,979 --> 00:02:31,900
and figure out where you're going

107
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:32,189
wrong.

108
00:02:32,229 --> 00:02:33,550
That is after you watch all of the

109
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:34,159
sales module

110
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:36,090
training and, uh, you know, see

111
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:37,590
where you can improve on your

112
00:02:37,909 --> 00:02:39,080
overall sales skills.

113
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:40,659
So, uh, this was showing that, you

114
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:42,250
know, Poppy isn't just for content

115
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:42,900
creation.

116
00:02:42,949 --> 00:02:43,060
It can

117
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:44,479
be used for analysis as well of

118
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:45,919
your existing, uh, sort of

119
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:46,340
processes.

120
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,650
I can help you improve in other

121
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:48,379
areas as well.

122
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:49,780
Uh, in the next video, I'm just

123
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:50,060
going to show

124
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:51,379
you guys how to learn anything

125
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:52,770
with Poppy in order to, uh, and

126
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:54,210
get through this course quicker

127
00:02:54,219 --> 00:02:55,830
and improve, you know, your, uh,

128
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:57,139
uh, launch of your agency and

129
00:02:57,139 --> 00:02:58,610
develop this, all the skills

130
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,229
you're going to need, um, to, uh,

131
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,699
run a successful business.

132
00:03:01,699 --> 00:03:03,289
So hope it's helpful and see you

133
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:03,439
guys

134
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:03,840
in the next one.

135
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,379
Peace.
