1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:01,929
All right so the goal of this

2
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:04,080
video is for me to give you kind

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,719
of like a poppy 101 crash course

4
00:00:06,809 --> 00:00:08,189
whatever you want to call it i'm

5
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:09,789
not going to really dive deep into

6
00:00:09,789 --> 00:00:11,400
specific use cases or how

7
00:00:11,529 --> 00:00:13,509
to come up with scripts for your

8
00:00:13,509 --> 00:00:15,169
videos or get a sales call

9
00:00:15,169 --> 00:00:16,899
analysis or write an email

10
00:00:16,899 --> 00:00:18,079
newsletter or

11
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:19,460
an entire sequence the goal of

12
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:20,789
this video is it's going to be

13
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:22,399
pretty short and sweet maybe not

14
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:22,449
too

15
00:00:22,649 --> 00:00:24,289
short but um but the goal is to

16
00:00:24,339 --> 00:00:26,359
walk you through from step one to

17
00:00:26,429 --> 00:00:28,329
show you what the product looks

18
00:00:28,489 --> 00:00:30,399
and feels like and then also how

19
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:31,929
you can use it in the best

20
00:00:31,929 --> 00:00:34,000
possible way right so with that

21
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:34,170
being

22
00:00:34,329 --> 00:00:35,909
said this is kind of how it looks

23
00:00:35,909 --> 00:00:37,570
currently currently for my use

24
00:00:37,609 --> 00:00:39,439
case now my use case my account

25
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:39,840
right

26
00:00:39,929 --> 00:00:41,710
what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna

27
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:43,759
click new board and i am going to

28
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:45,840
be taken into this board so when

29
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,000
you

30
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:47,979
create a new board this is where

31
00:00:47,979 --> 00:00:49,869
you would land now we do a lot of

32
00:00:49,899 --> 00:00:52,189
updates to the product very often

33
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:52,560
so

34
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:53,899
there might be a little bit of

35
00:00:53,899 --> 00:00:55,380
changes here and there but like

36
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:57,039
the core design and everything is

37
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:58,420
going to still stay the same so

38
00:00:58,420 --> 00:00:59,520
maybe like an icon is in a

39
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,039
different place now right with

40
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:01,719
that said

41
00:01:01,929 --> 00:01:03,570
um you can start off with like a

42
00:01:03,579 --> 00:01:05,409
template if your main goal is to

43
00:01:05,409 --> 00:01:07,519
come up with youtube video scripts

44
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:08,890
you can just click this and it

45
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:10,430
will give you a script a template

46
00:01:10,469 --> 00:01:11,890
where you can get started with

47
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:14,030
that if not you can do whatever

48
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:15,810
you want so let me give you a

49
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:18,879
quick brief on what this ui is and

50
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:19,200
what

51
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:21,170
each button or whatever this means

52
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:22,719
right so this is the starter

53
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:24,640
screen which disappears right

54
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,359
after you

55
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:28,239
create something like if i create

56
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:31,079
a chat window boom it's gone right

57
00:01:31,129 --> 00:01:33,090
so if i delete it the starter

58
00:01:33,209 --> 00:01:35,219
window comes back now this is your

59
00:01:35,219 --> 00:01:37,159
toolbar on the left and then you

60
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:38,719
also have a couple of other

61
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:40,359
different buttons over here and

62
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:41,859
then you have all of this now to

63
00:01:41,859 --> 00:01:43,840
explain what the toolbar has this

64
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,079
is

65
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:45,810
the ai chat now if you are a

66
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:47,810
shortcut fan like instead of

67
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:50,079
having to click this to create a

68
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:50,560
chat

69
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:52,010
what you can do is you can just

70
00:01:52,019 --> 00:01:53,739
click c on your keyboard and we'll

71
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:55,519
still do the same and then what

72
00:01:55,609 --> 00:01:57,010
you can do is you can bring in

73
00:01:57,079 --> 00:01:58,909
youtube videos instagram videos

74
00:01:58,909 --> 00:02:00,799
tick tock videos linkedin posts

75
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:02,810
and facebook ads as well now the

76
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:04,959
cool thing about poppy is when you

77
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:06,879
bring in say an instagram video

78
00:02:06,969 --> 00:02:09,319
tick tock video a linkedin post or

79
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:11,560
facebook ad not only does it take

80
00:02:11,729 --> 00:02:14,599
the video and transcribe it but

81
00:02:14,889 --> 00:02:16,949
you can it also visually analyzes

82
00:02:16,949 --> 00:02:18,669
what's in the video which is

83
00:02:18,699 --> 00:02:20,719
pretty damn sick if you tell me

84
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:20,879
does

85
00:02:20,969 --> 00:02:22,610
not have that same capability with

86
00:02:22,659 --> 00:02:24,210
youtube yet but with youtube it

87
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:25,759
gets the transcription of the

88
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:26,240
video so

89
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:28,069
it understands what the hell is

90
00:02:28,069 --> 00:02:29,969
going on right now you can either

91
00:02:29,969 --> 00:02:31,919
do this where you paste the link

92
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:32,430
here

93
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:34,150
oh let me show you a shortcut

94
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:35,810
right so let me just go to our

95
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:38,159
youtube channel right and then i

96
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:38,960
just i just

97
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:40,939
want to bring in this video i just

98
00:02:40,939 --> 00:02:43,069
right click copy link address come

99
00:02:43,069 --> 00:02:45,150
in here command c command v boom

100
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:45,360
the

101
00:02:45,449 --> 00:02:47,530
video is here the video is already

102
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:49,159
here now i can create a chat

103
00:02:49,229 --> 00:02:51,759
connected to this and i can say

104
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:52,240
give me

105
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:54,319
a breakdown of what's happening in

106
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:55,949
this video now as you can see

107
00:02:55,949 --> 00:02:57,919
because i'm making this video i

108
00:02:57,919 --> 00:02:58,960
love to talk

109
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:00,969
so instead of typing that i just

110
00:03:00,969 --> 00:03:03,050
spoke to the chat and it's giving

111
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:04,560
me an entire breakdown of what's

112
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:06,430
happening boom right so that is

113
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:08,360
great now here are a couple other

114
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:10,719
different things that you can do

115
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:12,800
you can switch between different

116
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,960
ai models personally i love claude

117
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,909
because they are the best when it

118
00:03:17,069 --> 00:03:17,360
comes

119
00:03:17,449 --> 00:03:19,280
to creativity right it's if you're

120
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,060
writing a vsl if you're writing a

121
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,879
youtube video script if you're

122
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:23,080
putting

123
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:25,150
together a short form video script

124
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:27,250
whatever that involves creativity

125
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,840
claude is the best but then

126
00:03:28,969 --> 00:03:32,280
we also have gpd5 gpd 4.0 gemini

127
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,780
2.5 pro grok gpd5 mini now gemini

128
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:39,039
2.5 pro and gpd5 they both

129
00:03:39,129 --> 00:03:40,740
have a million token limit now

130
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:42,349
with claude 4 if i remember

131
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,960
correctly they have a 300 000

132
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,560
token limit what

133
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:48,560
that means is it's the limit of

134
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,800
how much knowledge or context you

135
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,280
can feed in now if you were to

136
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:52,560
bring

137
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:54,719
in say like five or ten different

138
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:56,930
two hour long podcasts the context

139
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:59,039
limit or the window of claude

140
00:03:59,129 --> 00:04:00,889
4 is going to be over that limit

141
00:04:00,889 --> 00:04:02,740
and won't be able to work with you

142
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,319
like it will just give you an

143
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:04,639
error

144
00:04:04,729 --> 00:04:06,879
saying like too much connector now

145
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,870
if you still keep the same thing

146
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:11,199
in that window or whatever is the

147
00:04:11,289 --> 00:04:12,939
same chat but just switch to

148
00:04:12,979 --> 00:04:15,439
gemini 2.5 pro or gpd5 it would

149
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,389
work because it has a almost three

150
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:17,680
and a

151
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:19,699
half times more context limit so

152
00:04:19,699 --> 00:04:21,800
that's the benefit of like having

153
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,600
multiple different models

154
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,240
depending on

155
00:04:24,329 --> 00:04:25,730
what you're trying to work with

156
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,240
right so with that being said

157
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,920
that's kind of like the basic work

158
00:04:29,089 --> 00:04:29,360
um and

159
00:04:29,449 --> 00:04:30,850
then let's say you know you want

160
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,550
to bring in a facebook ad what you

161
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:34,000
would do is you go to something

162
00:04:34,089 --> 00:04:35,730
called the ad library so it's

163
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:37,899
facebook.com's ad slash library

164
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:39,769
let's see if i can find some ads

165
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:40,000
you

166
00:04:40,089 --> 00:04:42,060
know what i'm just going to bring

167
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,959
in hyros let's look up hyros um

168
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:46,079
hyros there we go so let's say

169
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:47,350
for example let's see if i can

170
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:48,610
find a video ad yes there we go

171
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:50,000
there's a video ad i'm just going

172
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,079
to

173
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:51,750
copy the link and then come into

174
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,560
poppy and then just paste the link

175
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,279
right and then what's going to

176
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:56,329
what it's going to do is it's

177
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:57,519
going to take everything in that

178
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:58,720
ad i'm just going to delete

179
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:00,209
this for now and then i'm also

180
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:01,930
going to bring in an image ad in

181
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:04,160
this example it's a carousel right

182
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:05,610
let's see if there's anything else

183
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,819
i can find you know what let's

184
00:05:06,819 --> 00:05:08,529
just bring this to let's see if it

185
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:09,040
can

186
00:05:09,129 --> 00:05:10,730
give us a complete breakdown of

187
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:12,490
all of these all right great so it

188
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:14,160
has extracted everything in

189
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,189
these images right so this is a

190
00:05:16,189 --> 00:05:18,449
carousel right um this is another

what it has right now you can

222
00:06:12,449 --> 00:06:14,639
bring in facebook ads now this is

223
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:14,810
just

224
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:16,560
still scratching the surface the

225
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,209
other things that you can bring in

226
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,879
is you can record voice memos now

227
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:22,610
let's say you have an idea for an

228
00:06:22,689 --> 00:06:24,579
offer or maybe you have an idea of

229
00:06:24,579 --> 00:06:26,240
what the copy needs to be for

230
00:06:26,329 --> 00:06:27,970
sales page that you're trying to

231
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:29,639
work on but instead of typing

232
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,680
everything you can just hit record

233
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,240
and then

234
00:06:32,329 --> 00:06:33,930
talk like hey you know my offer is

235
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:35,550
x y and z this is the pricing that

236
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:37,360
i'm thinking this is kind of like

237
00:06:37,449 --> 00:06:39,220
the icp you know blah blah blah

238
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:40,990
i've done this x y and z this is

239
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:42,800
my like this is what my offer

240
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,519
contains

241
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:44,930
all of that look you can talk for

242
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:46,680
like 10 minutes what however long

243
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,480
you want and then do that now

244
00:06:48,569 --> 00:06:50,519
also here's another hack let's say

245
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:52,290
you have a voice memo you want to

246
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:54,399
bring what i can do is i can just

247
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:56,750
go here do command c come here do

248
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,279
command v i would still bring that

249
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:01,279
in as well which is pretty damn

250
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:01,920
sick

251
00:07:02,009 --> 00:07:03,519
right like let's say you are doing

252
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:04,990
an in-person meeting with your

253
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:06,560
team or you're just like brain

254
00:07:06,649 --> 00:07:07,779
dumping and you're like hey i'm

255
00:07:07,779 --> 00:07:08,920
just going to talk through my

256
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,319
ideas and then you just talk while

257
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:10,560
you're

258
00:07:10,649 --> 00:07:12,230
on a walk and then you come back

259
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:13,829
you come to poppy and then you

260
00:07:13,829 --> 00:07:15,600
just copy paste it and boom it's

261
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,000
there

262
00:07:16,089 --> 00:07:17,730
and then you can bring in images

263
00:07:17,779 --> 00:07:19,439
um text nodes text nodes could

264
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,579
literally contain like a book or a

265
00:07:21,579 --> 00:07:22,189
pdf

266
00:07:22,329 --> 00:07:23,910
or like something from somewhere

267
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:25,420
you just copy just pasted it or

268
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:26,920
you can bring in websites you can

269
00:07:27,089 --> 00:07:27,360
create

270
00:07:27,449 --> 00:07:29,529
mind maps documents again you can

271
00:07:29,529 --> 00:07:31,360
bring in pdfs excel files csv

272
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,550
files literally anything and then

273
00:07:33,709 --> 00:07:33,839
here's

274
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:35,870
another cool thing about context

275
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:37,610
engineering right is you can

276
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:39,439
create groups so if you click

277
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:40,560
group and

278
00:07:40,649 --> 00:07:42,470
let's say for example instead of

279
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:44,230
these ads um you just wanted to

280
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:45,839
bring in like a bunch of your

281
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:46,240
youtube

282
00:07:46,329 --> 00:07:48,480
videos you can say something like

283
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,480
my youtube videos and then i'm

284
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,430
just going to go to youtube and

285
00:07:52,589 --> 00:07:53,439
then let's

286
00:07:53,529 --> 00:07:55,319
find a channel let's go to alex

287
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:57,360
and rosie's channel right what i

288
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,629
can do is i can just copy a bunch

289
00:07:59,790 --> 00:07:59,839
of

290
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:02,040
these links paste paste paste

291
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,389
paste paste now this is why poppy

292
00:08:04,389 --> 00:08:06,480
is super cool because you can

293
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:06,879
bring in

294
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:08,980
videos like this you can also

295
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:11,240
break down like your style your

296
00:08:11,379 --> 00:08:13,759
verbiage how you talk in youtube

297
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:14,209
videos

298
00:08:14,329 --> 00:08:16,089

303
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,720
memo feature you can come up with

304
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,040
a video

305
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:26,769
idea while you're talking and then

306
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:28,370
put that and say hey based on this

307
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:30,000
voice message around the video

308
00:08:30,089 --> 00:08:31,430
idea that i have and then my

309
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:32,889
youtube videos help me put

310
00:08:32,889 --> 00:08:34,639
together a script that sounds

311
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:35,360
exactly like

312
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:37,019
me and it will be able to do that

313
00:08:37,019 --> 00:08:38,830
for you not only that you can take

314
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:40,559
it to the next level by bringing

315
00:08:40,649 --> 00:08:42,690
in youtube videos on how to write

316
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:44,669
good scripts from for example

317
00:08:44,669 --> 00:08:46,480

318
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:46,750
videos

319
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:48,919

00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:51,509
callaway um you can just like copy

321
00:08:51,509 --> 00:08:53,620

322
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:54,000
in here

323
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:55,590
saying like youtube resources or

324
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:57,240
youtube script writing resources

325
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,679
connect all of them and say hey

with banger scripts for you and

329
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:03,929
then the mind map feature is

330
00:09:03,929 --> 00:09:04,480
actually a

331
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:05,889
really good one you can use this

332
00:09:05,889 --> 00:09:07,529
when you're brainstorming or let's

333
00:09:07,529 --> 00:09:09,149
say you're talking to someone

334
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:12,000
and you're like okay you know this

335
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,500
is a sales call with lucas sales

336
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,009
call lucas um his problems his

337
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:19,830
objections um his next steps right

338
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:22,149
you're like on the call you're

339
00:09:22,149 --> 00:09:24,720
talking to him while you're like

340
00:09:24,809 --> 00:09:26,960
jotting these things down and then

341
00:09:27,059 --> 00:09:29,000
you're like hey this is what we

342
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,799
decided to do on lucas call

343
00:09:30,889 --> 00:09:32,250
and then you can bring in like the

344
00:09:32,259 --> 00:09:33,840
recording of the sales call again

345
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,360
um even though you cannot see it

346
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,320
here you can just like drag and

347
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,500
drop mp4 files and it would work

348
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,440
so like if i just drag and drop

349
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:41,549
this

350
00:09:41,769 --> 00:09:43,350
video boom there you go so it's

351
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:45,159
like it's a video on bro reach the

352
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:47,399
final stage of growth um but it's

353
00:09:47,529 --> 00:09:48,830
going to analyze it it's going to

354
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:49,929
also visually see what is

355
00:09:49,929 --> 00:09:51,519
happening in the video that's why

356
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:51,809
it's taking

357
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:53,389
a few a bit of time to give you

358
00:09:53,389 --> 00:09:55,190
everything but then you can bring

359
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:57,120
in the sales call recording say

360
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:57,639

00:09:57,769 --> 00:09:58,970
based on x y and z what am i

362
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:00,669
supposed to do next like help me

363
00:10:00,669 --> 00:10:02,240
put together an agreement

364
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:03,840
like let's say the the decision on

365
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,269
that call was like hey i need to

366
00:10:05,269 --> 00:10:06,480
send you an agreement

367
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:08,190
you can put together an agreement

368
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:09,929
um by bringing in examples of like

369
00:10:09,929 --> 00:10:11,519
previous agreements and say

370
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:12,750
based on these agreements that i

371
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,019
put together and what happened on

372
00:10:14,019 --> 00:10:15,840
the sales call and the objections

373
00:10:15,929 --> 00:10:17,460
deliverables all of this put

374
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:19,429
together a proposal put together a

375
00:10:19,429 --> 00:10:21,200
an agreement whatever you want to

00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:21,559
do

377
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:23,759
so that is the power of poppy ai

378
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:25,750
now let's take it to the next

379
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,759

384
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:36,269

385
00:10:36,309 --> 00:10:38,029

386
00:10:38,169 --> 00:10:39,690
