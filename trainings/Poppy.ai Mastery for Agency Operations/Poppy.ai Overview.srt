1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,859
So guys, so in this module, we're

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:03,879
just going to be talking a little

3
00:00:03,879 --> 00:00:05,139
bit about Poppy AI.

4
00:00:05,429 --> 00:00:07,019
This module is going to explain

5
00:00:07,019 --> 00:00:08,890
what it is, what it can do, and

6
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:09,630
then some of the later

7
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:10,800
ones, we're going to show you how

8
00:00:10,919 --> 00:00:11,919
you can use this specifically for

9
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:12,759
your agency journey.

10
00:00:12,759 --> 00:00:15,869
So Poppy AI is very simply an AI

11
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:17,469
whiteboard.

12
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:19,350
It is a digital whiteboard where

13
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:21,019
you can add any sort of media or

14
00:00:21,019 --> 00:00:22,010
content, everything

15
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:24,300
from YouTube videos to ads, to

16
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,550
documents, to images, text,

17
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,609
whatever you want, and you

18
00:00:28,699 --> 00:00:30,440
can connect it up to an AI chat.

19
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,380
Now, the reason this is so useful

20
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:34,390
is because you can essentially

21
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:35,759
speed up your process of

22
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:37,369
say, writing your VSL or creating

23
00:00:37,479 --> 00:00:39,070
social media content or writing

24
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:41,100
your YouTube videos by using

25
00:00:41,509 --> 00:00:42,689
Poppy and using pre-trained

26
00:00:42,689 --> 00:00:43,479
materials.

27
00:00:43,479 --> 00:00:45,420
So what I mean by this, if you

28
00:00:45,549 --> 00:00:47,679
look at the page here, this is our

29
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:49,500
digital whiteboard.

30
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,219
So let's start off by very simply

31
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:53,880
adding the chat.

32
00:00:53,899 --> 00:00:55,229
If I press C on the keyboard,

33
00:00:55,229 --> 00:00:56,420
we've got a chat here.

34
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,509
You can just talk to this

35
00:00:57,509 --> 00:00:58,429
normally, like you would chat GPT

36
00:00:58,429 --> 00:00:58,960
or something.

37
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,259
You see down here, we've got

38
00:01:00,259 --> 00:01:01,770
different AI models we can choose

39
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:02,240
from.

40
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:05,200
ForSonna, 3.7, O3 mini, all the

41
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,060
way down.

42
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:06,829
You know, we've got a bunch in

43
00:01:06,829 --> 00:01:07,120
here.

44
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,709
Let's make this a little bigger.

45
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:11,290
But the key part that comes into

46
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,989
this is when we start actually

47
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:14,409
connecting things to it.

48
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,579
So let's say we want to add a

49
00:01:16,579 --> 00:01:18,079
YouTube video.

50
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:20,629
Say we want to know how to write

51
00:01:20,629 --> 00:01:22,540
an email sequence.

52
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:24,980
Let's go over here to YouTube and

53
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:27,250
let's look up Jeremy Haynes and

54
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:29,920
his Hammer Them Strategy videos.

55
00:01:30,939 --> 00:01:33,189
So this is a really good one,

56
00:01:33,189 --> 00:01:33,980
right?

57
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:35,239
So this is where he kind of

58
00:01:35,269 --> 00:01:36,870
explains this a little bit and he

59
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:38,599
goes into the email sequence kind

60
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:39,200
of process.

61
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,459
So we're going to copy this.

62
00:01:40,459 --> 00:01:41,879
I just right clicked and copy the

63
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:42,659
link address.

64
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:44,000
We're going to go back to Poppy.

65
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,939
We're going to paste this in here.

66
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:47,299
I just did paste.

67
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:48,379
You can also add this by just

68
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:49,439
going over here and choosing a

69
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:50,549
social media and putting the link

70
00:01:50,629 --> 00:01:51,099
in here.

71
00:01:51,099 --> 00:01:53,340
But for now, let's put that there.

72
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:54,730
Now, the other key thing about

73
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:56,299
Poppy is the grouping system.

74
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:57,849
Groups help the AI to understand

75
00:01:57,849 --> 00:01:59,290
what the content inside is and

76
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:00,159
what it does.

77
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:02,099
So if I go over here and click

78
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:04,120
group, we're just going to drag

79
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,739
this here and we're going to name

80
00:02:05,739 --> 00:02:06,060
it.

81
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:11,340
Email sequence writing training.

82
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,189
And then we can drag Jeremy's

83
00:02:13,189 --> 00:02:14,360
video in here.

84
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,330
Now, Jeremy, I actually have a few

85
00:02:15,539 --> 00:02:15,919
videos on this.

86
00:02:15,979 --> 00:02:18,319
So if I go back here, let's do is

87
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,139
a follow-up one here.

88
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,780
Paste this in here.

89
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:27,150
And let's grab this one as well.

90
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,250
This is a good video.

91
00:02:28,259 --> 00:02:30,099
So grab here and paste this in

92
00:02:30,099 --> 00:02:31,139
here as well.

93
00:02:31,139 --> 00:02:32,240
So there we go.

94
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,120
So these are all in a group now.

95
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,060
Now, the whiteboard element comes

96
00:02:35,189 --> 00:02:36,740
in similar to, as you may have

97
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:37,979
seen in the N8N videos,

98
00:02:37,979 --> 00:02:39,550
when we're connecting things, just

99
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:40,719
click and drag to connect it

100
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:41,330
together.

101
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,610
Now, the next thing we need to

102
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:43,960
know is the AI needs to know about

103
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,300
you.

104
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:45,830
What does it need to know about

105
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:46,830
you to write these email

106
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:47,449
sequences?

107
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,370
It needs to know, like, you know,

108
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:49,199
obviously like your name.

109
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:50,650
It needs to know your, about your

110
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:51,300
business.

111
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,550
So we're going to use obviously me

112
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:53,219
as an example.

113
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,620
So if I do a group and I name it

114
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:02,060
details about Lucas Senate, put

115
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:06,900
that there and let's grab my

116
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:07,189
website.

117
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:08,129
That's the only thing you can do.

118
00:03:08,139 --> 00:03:09,460
So if I go over here to the

119
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:11,759
website icon, I type in my

120
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:14,560
agency's website.

121
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,699
Paste that there, put that in

122
00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:18,599
here.

123
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:19,560
It's like a second for it to load.

124
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,810
You can also add notes for the AI

125
00:03:20,849 --> 00:03:22,039
to kind of understand what's in,

126
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:23,150
what the, you know, the item is a

127
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:23,520
bit better.

128
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:24,870
Usually not really needed once I

129
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:26,270
think it's in a group, but yeah,

130
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:27,000
it can be helpful.

131
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:31,189
And let's also add some stuff from

132
00:03:31,189 --> 00:03:33,550
my YouTube channel.

133
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,069
So if I go here and I search like

134
00:03:36,069 --> 00:03:38,840
killer, let's grab this one.

135
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,120
Let's copy this.

136
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,879
I took my background in this one.

137
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:44,030
So if I go back to poppy paste

138
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:48,879
this in here, up there, uh, I also

139
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:50,310
could go to like chat GBT and use

140
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:51,419
this memory to like write stuff

141
00:03:51,419 --> 00:03:51,719
about me.

142
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:52,830
But for now, this is probably

143
00:03:52,969 --> 00:03:53,280
enough.

144
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,150
I give enough information

145
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,120
throughout these videos.

146
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,639
So let's connect that up there

147
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:59,610
and, uh, let's see, we're going to

148
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:03,120
add a third group, but we're not

149
00:04:03,169 --> 00:04:04,159
going to put anything in here yet.

150
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,969
We're just going to name this, uh,

151
00:04:07,009 --> 00:04:09,039
output instructions.

152
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:09,810
I'm going to show you how we're

153
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:10,620
going to use this in a second for

154
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:10,919
now.

155
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:11,639
We'll keep that blank.

156
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:14,990
So here we're going to say, uh,

157
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:19,170
using the, let's see better using

158
00:04:19,689 --> 00:04:22,439
the information in your knowledge

159
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:27,790
base, write a high converting

160
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:33,199
email sequence following Jeremy

161
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:39,360
Haynes strategy for, uh, Lucas

162
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,759
Senate from.

163
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,800
Innovative.

164
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,259
We'll hit enter.

165
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:47,240
It's a bit bigger.

166
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:53,220
So it'll think.

167
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:54,600
Based on Jeremy Haynes, value

168
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,730
dense email strategy and

169
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:57,259
information at Lucas Senate.

170
00:04:57,259 --> 00:04:58,019
Innovative business.

171
00:04:58,019 --> 00:04:58,850
Here's a high converting email

172
00:04:58,850 --> 00:04:59,240
sequence.

173
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:00,949
Just put calls to boost your

174
00:05:00,949 --> 00:05:02,500
e-commerce revenue.

175
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:03,509
Uh, before we talk, I want to

176
00:05:03,509 --> 00:05:04,350
share something that happened the

177
00:05:04,459 --> 00:05:04,699
last week.

178
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:05,100
Homer Brown.

179
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,360
And I kept us doing 30 K a month

180
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:07,689
frustrated stocks and familiar in

181
00:05:07,689 --> 00:05:09,290
three days, 95 K a month, it's 57

182
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:10,379
K extra per month, but here's what

183
00:05:10,379 --> 00:05:11,160
most people miss.

184
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:11,879
It wasn't about changing our

185
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:12,230
products.

186
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,310
It wasn't running their ads.

187
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:14,910
It was about fixing three things.

188
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,160
I control a conversion rate.

189
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:16,970
You're both the fall, your side

190
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:17,980
speed, your offer positioning.

191
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:20,250
So these are all right.

192
00:05:20,259 --> 00:05:21,329
It's going to run a whole sequence

193
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:21,819
from here.

194
00:05:21,819 --> 00:05:23,199
It's doing a great job on this.

195
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,139
So far, uh, you can get it to, you

196
00:05:25,269 --> 00:05:27,329
know, uh, follow your, your kind

197
00:05:27,329 --> 00:05:28,959
of brand voice a little bit more.

198
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:29,850
Uh, there's a ton of stuff you can

199
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:30,519
do, but it's adding more

200
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:31,079
information.

201
00:05:31,339 --> 00:05:32,930
Now the third group I put in here

202
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,689
is the output instructions.

203
00:05:34,699 --> 00:05:36,069
And the way it reads, I did that

204
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:37,430
is because we sometimes want to

205
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:38,779
get the same kind of similar

206
00:05:38,779 --> 00:05:39,189
output each time.

207
00:05:39,259 --> 00:05:39,860
We have rules.

208
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,250
We want it to follow, uh, for

209
00:05:41,259 --> 00:05:42,970
instance, with most stuff that you

210
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:44,300
write online, you want it to be

211
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,740
written at like a, you know,

212
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:47,180
fourth grade reading level or

213
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:47,379
something.

214
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:47,639
Right.

215
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:50,639
So you hit T here to create text,

216
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,639
double click or clickers say, I

217
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:57,470
just write, write all content at

218
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:00,230
a, say an eighth grade reading

219
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:00,819
level.

220
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:05,279
That's one instruction.

221
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:07,500
We're going to put this over here,

222
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:12,639
smaller, and then we'll do another

223
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,699
and say, uh, you know,

224
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:20,000
always sign off any emails, uh,

225
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,920
Lucas Senate from innovative and

226
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:28,180
remind the prospect to book a

227
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:28,720
call.

228
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,470
If they have not yet, this is a

229
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:31,829
follow-up sequence.

230
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:33,000
So it's really, you know, make a

231
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:33,470
ton of sense.

232
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:34,930
But, uh, for now, I just want to

233
00:06:34,939 --> 00:06:36,139
show you guys that it follows

234
00:06:36,139 --> 00:06:38,800
these instructions and let's start

235
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:43,050
with, uh, start every email with a

236
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:45,339
Lucas here.

237
00:06:46,579 --> 00:06:49,720
And put that in there too, small.

238
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:54,550
So now when I connect this up,

239
00:06:54,550 --> 00:07:00,170
we're going to say, uh, let's just

240
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:03,279
do same thing again.

241
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,670
Copy this prompts, new

242
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:07,470
conversation.

243
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:12,220
And we're going to add follow all

244
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:14,399
instructions in your knowledge

245
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:15,040
base.

246
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,000
Hit enter.

247
00:07:16,379 --> 00:07:21,329
So you go now starting with, Hey

248
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:23,540
Lucas here.

249
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:27,300
It should end with, uh, the, uh,

250
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,180
watch out the ending.

251
00:07:29,379 --> 00:07:30,279
We gave it as well.

252
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:34,149
You can see like how this would

253
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:37,509
take you, if you're writing an

254
00:07:37,529 --> 00:07:40,000
email sequence, it might take you,

255
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
if you're to watch each of

256
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,019
Jeremy's videos, these are, you

257
00:07:42,019 --> 00:07:43,389
know, pretty long videos.

258
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:45,279
Uh, it could take a few hours.

259
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:46,139
You've got to kind of, you know,

260
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:46,959
write and test to make sure it's

261
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:47,220
okay.

262
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,579
We did this in literally like

263
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,899
what, like we're eight minutes in

264
00:07:49,899 --> 00:07:50,540
this video.

265
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:51,379
I think they're actually writing.

266
00:07:51,379 --> 00:07:52,970
It took like maybe a total of

267
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:55,170
four, five minutes, uh, to write a

268
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:57,259
ton of emails for our sequence.

269
00:07:57,639 --> 00:07:59,970
Um, so that's just a quick example

270
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:01,160
of what we can do.

271
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,259
As you can see, you can import any

272
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:03,439
type of content you want into it.

273
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:04,759
You can even do voice notes.

274
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:06,139
So you can put in images and

275
00:08:06,139 --> 00:08:08,079
texts, uh, websites, and you want

276
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:09,800
and connect it all up together

277
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,709
and, uh, you can write, uh, you

278
00:08:11,709 --> 00:08:13,550
know, content way quicker than you

279
00:08:13,709 --> 00:08:14,699
could if you were trying to do it

280
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:15,240
manually.

281
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,829
And another cool thing is poppy is

282
00:08:16,889 --> 00:08:17,959
a ton of templates.

283
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:19,579
So if you go to the template

284
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:21,810
section here, uh, here's a ton of

285
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:23,720
items they offer for free.

286
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,920
So, uh, if we look at like, let's

287
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,920
see what's a really cool one that

288
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,120
I like, uh, the second brain is

289
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:30,899
pretty cool.

290
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,509
So the second brain is made for,

291
00:08:32,509 --> 00:08:34,070
uh, people that want to use poppy

292
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:35,490
just to, uh, organize their

293
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:36,639
general life and thoughts.

294
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:37,840
They've got details here and how

295
00:08:37,889 --> 00:08:38,580
to use the board.

296
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:40,139
Um, basically you put ideas you

297
00:08:40,139 --> 00:08:40,899
have in here.

298
00:08:40,899 --> 00:08:41,740
It's gonna be voice notes, it's

299
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:42,399
gonna be texts, it can be

300
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:42,840
whatever.

301
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:44,470
And then you just tell the AI to

302
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:45,990
run prompt five and it will

303
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:47,919
actually run through this prompt

304
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:49,899
here and help you categorize your

305
00:08:49,899 --> 00:08:51,580
thoughts, uh, give you like, uh,

306
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:52,799
workflow suggestions, give you

307
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:55,220
action plans, uh, super, super

308
00:08:55,299 --> 00:08:55,629
useful.

309
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,019
And then if we go back to

310
00:08:58,019 --> 00:09:00,539
templates again, uh, the few other

311
00:09:00,539 --> 00:09:03,429
really good ones on here, Brian's

312
00:09:03,429 --> 00:09:04,840
YouTube script writing template is

313
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,480
phenomenal.

314
00:09:05,809 --> 00:09:07,330
Brian's got all of his training on

315
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:09,169
writing YouTube scripts, a ton of

316
00:09:09,169 --> 00:09:10,360
documents of writing YouTube

317
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:10,809
scripts.

318
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,379
Uh, actually this is all the

319
00:09:12,379 --> 00:09:13,519
content on Brian.

320
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:14,779
So you just replace this with your

321
00:09:14,809 --> 00:09:16,090
information about who you are.

322
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:17,809
And then down here, he's got all

323
00:09:17,809 --> 00:09:19,299
his training on how to write viral

324
00:09:19,299 --> 00:09:20,730
videos and then a prompt chain,

325
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:22,159
uh, then it will automatically

326
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:23,789
write your YouTube scripts for

327
00:09:23,789 --> 00:09:23,990
you.

328
00:09:24,139 --> 00:09:25,700
Uh, really, really good.

329
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,070
Brian's super successful with, uh,

330
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:28,210
running his content agency and

331
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:29,360
writing YouTube scripts for

332
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:29,600
people.

333
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,960
So, you know, the output is going

334
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,250
to be good and, uh, you know, it

335
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:33,659
makes it really easy for you just

336
00:09:33,659 --> 00:09:34,629
to spin up new YouTube videos

337
00:09:34,629 --> 00:09:35,419
whenever you want.

338
00:09:35,419 --> 00:09:37,009
Uh, so I think poppy is a super

339
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,120
powerful tool.

340
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,330
Uh, the guys are poppy are also

341
00:09:39,409 --> 00:09:40,600
great to work with, really nice

342
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,019
guys, and they are creating some

343
00:09:42,019 --> 00:09:43,850
exclusive content for us here in,

344
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:45,059
uh, in the course.

345
00:09:45,059 --> 00:09:46,539
So you guys get to hear directly

346
00:09:46,539 --> 00:09:48,169
from them, the most powerful ways

347
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:48,970
to use poppy.

348
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:50,080
Uh, but I'm going to show you a

349
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,240
few other ways I've been using it

350
00:09:51,309 --> 00:09:52,220
in the next videos.

351
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:53,789
So check those out and, uh, would

352
00:09:53,789 --> 00:09:55,330
highly suggest using this for your

353
00:09:55,409 --> 00:09:56,240
agency set up.

354
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,480
This will speed up your VSL

355
00:09:57,529 --> 00:09:59,190
writing, your landing page, copy

356
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:00,730
creation, your, um, uh, email

357
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,899
sequence writing, your cold email

358
00:10:02,899 --> 00:10:04,559
writing, anything to do with

359
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:06,000
creating content is going to be 10

360
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,039
times easier using poppy.

361
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:09,419
Um, so, uh, yeah, that's a bit

362
00:10:09,419 --> 00:10:10,360
about it.

363
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,610
And, uh, let's go to the next

364
00:10:11,649 --> 00:10:11,950
video.

365
00:10:12,059 --> 00:10:13,450
We're going to show you guys some

366
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,850
of the kind of other systems that

367
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:16,169
I use inside of poppy in order to

368
00:10:16,169 --> 00:10:17,710
always get solid outputs and, uh,

369
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:19,169
make this an integral part of your

370
00:10:19,169 --> 00:10:19,659
workflow.

371
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:21,139
See you next one.

372
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:21,679
Peace.

373
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,240
Thank you.
