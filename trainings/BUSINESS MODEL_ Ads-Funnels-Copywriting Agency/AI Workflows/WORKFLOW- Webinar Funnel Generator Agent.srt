1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,279
- So guys, Lucas here.

2
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:03,169
So today I'm gonna be running

3
00:00:03,379 --> 00:00:03,600
through

4
00:00:03,649 --> 00:00:05,450
the webinar funnel generator

5
00:00:06,009 --> 00:00:06,480
workflow.

6
00:00:06,519 --> 00:00:07,799
I'll start off as usual by telling

7
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:08,359
you the prerequisites

8
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:10,320
you need to have set up, how each

9
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:11,640
of these nodes works

10
00:00:11,689 --> 00:00:13,839
and the overall run of the flow.

11
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:16,120
So you will need open writer set

12
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:17,640
up as usual

13
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:19,120
for all AI agents.

14
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:21,000
You will need your Google Drive

15
00:00:21,489 --> 00:00:21,760
set up

16
00:00:21,809 --> 00:00:23,559
and you will need your Google Docs

17
00:00:23,559 --> 00:00:24,120
set up.

18
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:24,910
We've talked about how to set

19
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:26,320
these up in previous videos,

20
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:28,679
but most of them for Google Drive

21
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:30,320
is just going to be logging into

22
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:32,399
your Google Drive account

23
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:33,880
with the OS redirect URL and stuff

24
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:34,280
as we went over

25
00:00:34,609 --> 00:00:36,439
in one of the previous N8N videos

26
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,299
and same for Google Docs.

27
00:00:39,369 --> 00:00:40,920
So that's all you're gonna need

28
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:41,600
for this one.

29
00:00:41,649 --> 00:00:42,880
Nothing else too complicated.

30
00:00:42,929 --> 00:00:44,759
So let's go over exactly what this

31
00:00:44,929 --> 00:00:45,439
does.

32
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:47,310
First of all, we have a form

33
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:48,880
submission as usual.

34
00:00:48,929 --> 00:00:50,229
We get information such as the

35
00:00:50,229 --> 00:00:50,799
client name,

36
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,659
the Google Doc URL, the webinar

37
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:53,840
type, date and time,

38
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:55,710
the platform, the duration, the

39
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:57,159
fast action bonus,

40
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:58,299
the replay availability, the

41
00:00:58,380 --> 00:00:59,039
teaching style,

42
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:00,600
the pitch intensity, special guest

43
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,200
or interview,

44
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:03,030
and then we have to submit it out

45
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:03,880
and stuff as usual.

46
00:01:03,929 --> 00:01:09,359
So then if this is a existing,

47
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:09,680
sorry,

48
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:11,560
if we provide the Google Doc URL

49
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,200
of our funnel strategy document,

50
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:14,590
which we've gone over in the

51
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:15,680
previous methods,

52
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:18,420
then we will get that document and

53
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:19,799
get the information from it.

54
00:01:19,849 --> 00:01:21,260
Now, if we don't have that

55
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:22,640
information, that's fine.

56
00:01:22,689 --> 00:01:23,540
Let's go directly to our code

57
00:01:23,739 --> 00:01:25,200
node, which just cleans things up

58
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:27,519
and gives us a session ID for us

59
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:28,819
for our memory for some of our

60
00:01:28,819 --> 00:01:29,469
other agents.

61
00:01:29,569 --> 00:01:32,030
So basically, again, if you've

62
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:32,950
created a funnel strategy document

63
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:33,519
for this client,

64
00:01:33,569 --> 00:01:34,769
it will search for it in your

65
00:01:34,769 --> 00:01:35,719
client's folder.

66
00:01:35,769 --> 00:01:37,780
Then we'll get the contents of

67
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,640
that document and send it on over

68
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,439
to our webinar copywriter agent.

69
00:01:42,489 --> 00:01:44,269
This is a detailed webinar

70
00:01:44,269 --> 00:01:45,760
copywriter agent that takes our

71
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:46,760
strategic blueprint.

72
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:48,379
Again, it doesn't have it, not a

73
00:01:48,379 --> 00:01:48,629
problem,

74
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:49,260
but it'll take all the other

75
00:01:49,379 --> 00:01:50,519
information we got from the form

76
00:01:51,049 --> 00:01:52,430
and then details to it,

77
00:01:52,489 --> 00:01:54,890
how it should write the initial

78
00:01:54,909 --> 00:01:56,439
webinar script.

79
00:01:56,489 --> 00:01:58,310
We started off by actually writing

80
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:00,159
the full on script of the webinar

81
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:00,519
first.

82
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,719
After that, we're then going to go

83
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,670
on and have an agent write the

84
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:05,319
slide deck.

85
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:07,560
So the slide deck is all of the

86
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:10,270
information on screen and the

87
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:11,319
slide deck will be shown during

88
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:11,800
the webinar.

89
00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:14,199
This means your life way easier.

90
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:15,069
You don't have to make it from the

91
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:15,349
script.

92
00:02:15,449 --> 00:02:16,939
It just does it automatically for

93
00:02:16,939 --> 00:02:17,270
you.

94
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:18,639
Then we are going to write a

95
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:19,800
registration page.

96
00:02:19,849 --> 00:02:21,650
So we create a high converting

97
00:02:22,219 --> 00:02:24,759
registration page copy for this

98
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:26,360
webinar.

99
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:28,310
It does everything you need to,

100
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:28,759
you know,

101
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:30,629
create a kind of landing page that

102
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:31,960
gets people hyped and ready for

103
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,000
the webinar ahead of time,

104
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:34,319
including the information they're

105
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:35,639
going to find out on the webinar.

106
00:02:35,689 --> 00:02:38,330
Then we write a detailed email

107
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:39,560
sequence.

108
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:41,080
So we're telling the agent here to

109
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,199
create a complete pre and post

110
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:42,879
webinar email sequence

111
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:44,120
from the inputs below.

112
00:02:44,169 --> 00:02:44,969
Again, you've got all the same

113
00:02:45,219 --> 00:02:46,189
stuff again, all the details of

114
00:02:46,189 --> 00:02:46,599
the webinar.

115
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:48,050
We're including the script here as

116
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:48,280
well.

117
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:50,099
And this gives all the context it

118
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:52,550
needs in order to write two sets

119
00:02:52,689 --> 00:02:53,400
of email sequences,

120
00:02:53,449 --> 00:02:54,680
the pre and post webinar

121
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,280
sequences.

122
00:02:56,169 --> 00:02:57,250
Finally, we have the thank you

123
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:58,000
page copywriter.

124
00:02:58,090 --> 00:02:59,289
This is what's shown after the

125
00:02:59,289 --> 00:02:59,800
webinar.

126
00:03:00,229 --> 00:03:01,680
Again, the same information goes

127
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,990
in again, but this tells it how to

128
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:05,539
write a super detailed

129
00:03:05,689 --> 00:03:07,270
thank you page that gets people

130
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,879
hyped and gets them even more

131
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,919
likely to purchase post webinar.

132
00:03:10,969 --> 00:03:12,800
After all this, we just organize

133
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,599
all this content here.

134
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:16,479
And then each of these creates a

135
00:03:17,009 --> 00:03:17,560
Google doc.

136
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:18,680
As you can see, create webinar

137
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,939
script doc, create thank you page

138
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:20,199
doc.

139
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,599
Oh yeah, you will need MD2 docs as

140
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:23,229
well.

141
00:03:23,289 --> 00:03:24,319
To do that, all you have to do is

142
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,270
set your Google docs API here.

143
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:27,919
Exactly the same API that you will

144
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:29,330
have over here for the get

145
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:30,280
document node here.

146
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:32,159
After that set up, it will

147
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:34,949
automatically create the different

148
00:03:34,949 --> 00:03:36,270
documents.

149
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:37,430
Then it was going to collect all

150
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,759
those documents again.

151
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:40,389
Then the code node here

152
00:03:40,419 --> 00:03:42,699
essentially just splits up our

153
00:03:42,699 --> 00:03:45,080
outputs of each of the URLs.

154
00:03:45,129 --> 00:03:46,830
Then it searches for the existing

155
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:47,800
client folder.

156
00:03:47,849 --> 00:03:49,030
If we have an existing client

157
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,650
folder, it moves all of those

158
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:52,039
documents to the correct folder.

159
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:53,280
If not, it'll create a new client

160
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:53,680
folder.

161
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:55,349
As usual, as we've talked in other

162
00:03:55,349 --> 00:03:56,439
videos, you have to have a Google

163
00:03:56,439 --> 00:03:57,550
drive folder named clients

164
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:59,099
where you will be creating all the

165
00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:00,840
documentation for your clients.

166
00:04:00,889 --> 00:04:03,909
If that client exists based on the

167
00:04:03,909 --> 00:04:06,240
name you input on the form at the

168
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,639
beginning over here,

169
00:04:07,689 --> 00:04:09,060
then we will move those documents

170
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,199
to the correct folder.

171
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,349
If not, we'll create the folder

172
00:04:11,419 --> 00:04:12,409
and move the documents to the

173
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:12,840
folder.

174
00:04:12,889 --> 00:04:14,719
And then finally, we create a nice

175
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:18,560
Slack notification that tells you

176
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:18,850
what documents

177
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,629
have been created and includes a

178
00:04:20,629 --> 00:04:22,240
link to the folder where you can

179
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,720
find all of those documents.

180
00:04:23,769 --> 00:04:25,189
Now to see what these documents

181
00:04:25,189 --> 00:04:26,600
look like, I'm just going to grab

182
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,319
it from here.

183
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:28,209
So we'll see what the webinar

184
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:29,079
scripts looks like.

185
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:30,920
Open this.

186
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:35,430
As you can see, it's a super

187
00:04:35,459 --> 00:04:37,680
detailed script goes on for 42

188
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:39,319
pages in total.

189
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:41,189
This is, you know, a fake company

190
00:04:41,339 --> 00:04:43,079
that I've made to give us some

191
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:45,639
detail on just a test

192
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,389
information that we can use, but

193
00:04:47,389 --> 00:04:48,959
it goes over everything that is

194
00:04:49,089 --> 00:04:49,959
needed for the webinar.

195
00:04:50,009 --> 00:04:52,680
Super long, super, super detailed.

196
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:54,899
And if we go back here again to

197
00:04:55,149 --> 00:04:59,250
the email sequence one, let's copy

198
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:00,519
this and open this.

199
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:03,420
Then you can see there's a pretty

200
00:05:03,459 --> 00:05:04,600
webinar sequence for registrants.

201
00:05:04,649 --> 00:05:08,759
Writes the full webinar, you know,

202
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:09,720
registration thing here.

203
00:05:09,769 --> 00:05:10,930
So you can put, you have to edit a

204
00:05:10,939 --> 00:05:12,079
bit with your own links and

205
00:05:12,189 --> 00:05:12,839
information,

206
00:05:12,889 --> 00:05:14,980
but it does 99% of the work for

207
00:05:15,149 --> 00:05:15,480
you.

208
00:05:15,529 --> 00:05:19,060
And then if we go to the slide

209
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:20,680
deck document, we'll take a look

210
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,800
at the slide deck docs.

211
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:23,439
Let's see what this looks like.

212
00:05:23,529 --> 00:05:25,800
This tells you, again, the, the,

213
00:05:25,949 --> 00:05:26,800
there you go.

214
00:05:26,889 --> 00:05:27,600
So we've got the different

215
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,480
information we should have on

216
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,399
different slide decks.

217
00:05:29,449 --> 00:05:30,540
Welcome title and slide, et

218
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:31,040
cetera.

219
00:05:31,689 --> 00:05:33,060
Promise slide, all that stuff, all

220
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:33,529
the way down.

221
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,800
Then the thank you page.

222
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:39,480
Let's take a look at this one.

223
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:43,079
There you go.

224
00:05:43,129 --> 00:05:44,740
You're officially registered after

225
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:47,009
they, you know, sign up for the

226
00:05:47,009 --> 00:05:47,560
webinar.

227
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:49,420
They put in all this information

228
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:50,759
here, get a nice thank you page

229
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:51,160
telling them,

230
00:05:51,209 --> 00:05:52,089
you know, thanks for signing up

231
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:52,779
and what they're going to get

232
00:05:52,779 --> 00:05:54,189
ahead of the call.

233
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:55,079
Obviously you're going to have to

234
00:05:55,209 --> 00:05:56,259
edit this sort of stuff, but it's

235
00:05:56,259 --> 00:05:56,939
good to go.

236
00:05:57,610 --> 00:05:58,939
And then finally we have the

237
00:05:58,939 --> 00:06:00,519
registration page, the page they

238
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:01,829
see before they register for the

239
00:06:02,009 --> 00:06:02,680
webinar.

240
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:03,610
Let me get this in here.

241
00:06:03,689 --> 00:06:04,790
There we go.

242
00:06:04,889 --> 00:06:05,959
We've got a full sales page.

243
00:06:06,009 --> 00:06:07,839
I got a webinar registration page

244
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,879
kind of set up and ready to go.

245
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:11,550
So as you can see this creates

246
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:12,819
pretty much everything you need to

247
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:13,560
get the funnel going.

248
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:14,660
This is 10 times you have to do

249
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:15,980
this individually yourself or, you

250
00:06:16,029 --> 00:06:16,920
know, write it from scratch.

251
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:19,370
So super helpful if you are making

252
00:06:19,389 --> 00:06:21,399
webinar funnels for clients, which

253
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:22,399
you will be if you're running a

254
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:24,040
funnel agency, most likely.

255
00:06:24,569 --> 00:06:25,670
So this is definitely a very

256
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:26,399
detailed one.

257
00:06:26,569 --> 00:06:27,779
You know, we've got about five AI

258
00:06:27,779 --> 00:06:29,050
agents running here that are all

259
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:30,680
kind of doing deep research and

260
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,639
going really in depth.

261
00:06:31,689 --> 00:06:33,170
It gets better outputs if you use

262
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:34,839
the funnel strategy document.

263
00:06:34,889 --> 00:06:36,709
So highly suggest you do that and

264
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,410
input the URL to that here at the

265
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:39,879
beginning of your form.

266
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:42,360
So that it can get that document

267
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,500
and do a really good job of

268
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,019
writing all that information for

269
00:06:45,019 --> 00:06:45,360
you.

270
00:06:45,449 --> 00:06:47,959
So that's how this works.

271
00:06:48,009 --> 00:06:49,459
Hope this was useful and I will

272
00:06:49,459 --> 00:06:50,990
see you guys in the next one.

273
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:52,120
Peace.
