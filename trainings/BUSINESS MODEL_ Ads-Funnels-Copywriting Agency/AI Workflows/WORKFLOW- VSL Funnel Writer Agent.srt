1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:01,790
What's up guys, Lucas here.

2
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:02,680
So today I'm going to be running

3
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:04,509
you guys through the VSL Funnel

4
00:00:04,509 --> 00:00:05,440
Writer Automation.

5
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:07,599
Very simply, what this does is it

6
00:00:07,599 --> 00:00:09,679
writes absolutely banger VSLs.

7
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:11,480
And the way it does that, as with

8
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:13,199
most of these nodes so far,

9
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:14,730
we're going to start with a VSL

10
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:15,830
form submission.

11
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,480
So we get the client name, product

12
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,219
and service name, the price point,

13
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:19,429
payment

14
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,800
options, target audience, main

15
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,120
pain points, huge mechanism,

16
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:22,719
transformation,

17
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:24,359
promise, client results, core

18
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,329
offer details, bonus stack, total

19
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:27,199
value, VSL

20
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:28,500
style, VSL length, urgency

21
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,980
element, and the guarantee.

22
00:00:30,059 --> 00:00:31,399
Now, some of these are dropdowns

23
00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:32,240
and some of these you have to

24
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:32,750
input manually.

25
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,299
For instance, VSL style is a

26
00:00:34,299 --> 00:00:36,320
dropdown as is VSL length, but

27
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:36,929
obviously the course

28
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:38,469
price and some of these are things

29
00:00:38,469 --> 00:00:39,439
like target audience.

30
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,039
You will have to input manually

31
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:43,280
after that, we will do a search

32
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,000
for the strategy

33
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:45,509
documents that you are going to be

34
00:00:45,509 --> 00:00:47,020
basing a lot of your funnels off

35
00:00:47,149 --> 00:00:47,200
of.

36
00:00:47,259 --> 00:00:48,740
As you mentioned for the, the, uh,

37
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,600
strategy, uh, sorry, funnel

38
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,000
strategy

39
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,850
creation workflow, that'll be the

40
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:54,799
basis for a lot of your, uh, other

41
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:55,399
funnel,

42
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:57,210
uh, kind of documents and, uh, uh,

43
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:59,200
uh, other elements going forward.

44
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:01,670
So after that, we go to the code

45
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:02,219
node.

46
00:01:02,299 --> 00:01:03,670
What this does really is just, it

47
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:06,879
sets, uh, the document ID so that

48
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:07,519
our Google docs

49
00:01:07,579 --> 00:01:09,359
can get the, uh, funnel strategy

50
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:10,200
document.

51
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,200
Then we prepare the context, uh,

52
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,959
just a code node here as well.

53
00:01:15,019 --> 00:01:16,040
It's kind of formulates things in

54
00:01:16,069 --> 00:01:17,840
the strategy context here and gets

55
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:18,400
us a session

56
00:01:18,459 --> 00:01:20,150
ID so that our AI agents will have

57
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:21,829
access to their memory modules.

58
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:25,280
Then this agent creates VSL hooks.

59
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:26,920
It looks at everything from the

60
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:29,159
research doc, as well as the form

61
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:30,120
input submissions.

62
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:32,849
And it creates three, uh, opening

63
00:01:32,849 --> 00:01:33,640
hooks.

64
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,489
After that, we have our story

65
00:01:35,769 --> 00:01:37,040
architecture agent.

66
00:01:37,099 --> 00:01:38,859
And what this does is very simply

67
00:01:38,859 --> 00:01:40,799
is it takes again, the hooks as

68
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:41,560
well as a research

69
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:43,409
document on the details from the

70
00:01:43,689 --> 00:01:45,680
form in order to create, uh, kind

71
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,359
of a story

72
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:47,689
around the VSL, uh, that will

73
00:01:47,689 --> 00:01:48,769
really pull on kind of the

74
00:01:48,769 --> 00:01:50,269
emotional elements that, uh,

75
00:01:50,349 --> 00:01:50,519
trigger

76
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:51,560
people to purchase.

77
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:52,980
Once it creates the story

78
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:54,530
elements, then we have the

79
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:55,959
objection handling agents.

80
00:01:56,019 --> 00:01:58,040
Later on in the VSL script, we'll

81
00:01:58,090 --> 00:01:59,400
be handling the objections.

82
00:01:59,459 --> 00:02:00,549
We will potentially have and

83
00:02:00,549 --> 00:02:01,920
alleviating those concerns.

84
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,519
So that's what this does here.

85
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,480
It's just a detailed agent that

86
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:06,859
helps to, uh, go over the

87
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,400
different, uh, you know, elements

88
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:09,460
that people will be kind of maybe,

89
00:02:09,508 --> 00:02:10,800
you know, question of the price or

90
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,960
the time investment,

91
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:12,599
things like that.

92
00:02:12,659 --> 00:02:14,449
And this handles all of those.

93
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:16,129
And then finally, we have a

94
00:02:16,129 --> 00:02:17,979
closing CTA agent that again, does

95
00:02:17,979 --> 00:02:19,240
the same thing, takes all the

96
00:02:19,979 --> 00:02:21,340
information and it creates a, uh,

97
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:23,120
perfect kind of CTA and ending

98
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,319
section of our VSL in total.

99
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:27,169
Finally, this code node will take

100
00:02:27,449 --> 00:02:29,099
all of this information and we'll

101
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:29,879
put it together into this

102
00:02:29,939 --> 00:02:31,479
VSL script over here, along with

103
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:33,069
the client name and the product

104
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:35,280
name, uh, that we can then feed

105
00:02:35,419 --> 00:02:37,189
into our, uh, Google docs

106
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:38,110
creation.

107
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,969
So we end up with a Google doc

108
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:42,599
with the full VSL script, as well

109
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:44,120
as the file name here with the

110
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:45,550
client name and the date.

111
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,340
And then as you've seen in some of

112
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,669
our other nodes, it's going to

113
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:49,960
search for the existing,

114
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,500
uh, folder for the client in our

115
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,520
clients folder.

116
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:53,949
If it's not there, it'll create a

117
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:55,360
new client folder and then move

118
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,919
the Google doc into that folder.

119
00:02:56,979 --> 00:02:58,039
If it is there, it'll move the

120
00:02:58,039 --> 00:02:59,199
Google doc to that folder.

121
00:02:59,259 --> 00:03:00,430
But we're finally creating a

122
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:01,639
summary and setting a Slack

123
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:02,319
notification.

124
00:03:02,379 --> 00:03:04,169
As usual, you will need to have

125
00:03:04,449 --> 00:03:06,400
your Google docs authentication

126
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,439
set up your, uh, Google drive

127
00:03:09,129 --> 00:03:09,780
authentication set up, which is

128
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,199
your Google docs, your open router

129
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:12,159
authentication.

130
00:03:12,219 --> 00:03:13,990
And then for MD2 docs, you will

131
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:15,560
just need your Google docs.

132
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:17,219
Uh, authentication to get that

133
00:03:17,219 --> 00:03:17,719
working.

134
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,300
So let's take a look at the VSL

135
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,000
script that this creates.

136
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,849
If I copy this here and paste this

137
00:03:23,129 --> 00:03:24,909
here, you're going to see that it

138
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:27,000
is a very, very large script,

139
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:30,020
a total of 44 pages in total, but

140
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:31,169
it gives us a bit of information

141
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:31,479
as well.

142
00:03:31,539 --> 00:03:32,620
We're explaining kind of why these

143
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:33,129
things work.

144
00:03:33,219 --> 00:03:35,020
So we get three hook variations,

145
00:03:35,259 --> 00:03:37,240
uh, for going into the main story

146
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,159
section, uh, part one, part two,

147
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,189
part three, four, part five, then

148
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:41,449
it goes with the objection

149
00:03:41,449 --> 00:03:42,120
handling.

150
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,520
And you can see there's also these

151
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,400
tone indicators here as well that

152
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,030
help with the kind of the

153
00:03:46,099 --> 00:03:47,469
performance of the script and to

154
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,939
help whoever, uh, you know,

155
00:03:48,939 --> 00:03:50,520
delivering the VSL to, uh,

156
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:50,840
understand

157
00:03:50,979 --> 00:03:51,909
kind of how they should be

158
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:53,240
speaking at certain stages and

159
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,530
kind of emphasizing certain words

160
00:03:54,659 --> 00:03:55,319
and things like that.

161
00:03:55,379 --> 00:03:57,979
So this, uh, when it's done, we

162
00:03:57,979 --> 00:04:00,439
moved into the folder along with

163
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:01,680
your other previous funnel

164
00:04:01,729 --> 00:04:02,360
documents.

165
00:04:02,419 --> 00:04:03,379
So you'll end up with the full

166
00:04:03,469 --> 00:04:04,580
outline, your slide deck, copy

167
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:06,199
your thank you page, copy your VSL

168
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:06,520
script,

169
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,360
your webinar email, uh, sequence

170
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:09,960
and your webinar script.

171
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,219
So as, as well as your

172
00:04:11,219 --> 00:04:12,590
registration page.

173
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:14,210
So you will have a full funnel

174
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:15,620
build that, including a webinar

175
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:18,199
and a BSL all set up in there yet.

176
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:19,399
That's basically it.

177
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:21,000
That's, uh, kind of how it works.

178
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,240
Uh, see anything else here.

179
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,889
Uh, the flow again, overall is

180
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:26,639
just the form submission with the

181
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:27,149
data.

182
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,509
We're going to get that strategy

183
00:04:28,509 --> 00:04:30,120
document to provide context to

184
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,199
our, uh, VSL writers on what

185
00:04:32,259 --> 00:04:32,920
the offer is.

186
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,939
Then we write the hook followed by

187
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:36,680
the story architecture, followed

188
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,279
by the objection handling,

189
00:04:38,339 --> 00:04:40,040
followed by the closing CTA.

190
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:41,939
And then finally we compile that

191
00:04:41,939 --> 00:04:43,519
into one script and then add it to

192
00:04:43,529 --> 00:04:44,269
a Google doc.

193
00:04:44,339 --> 00:04:45,439
And then we either create a new

194
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,949
client folder or move it into the

195
00:04:46,949 --> 00:04:48,439
existing client folder

196
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,540
before sending you a nice

197
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:51,420
notification in Slack that just

198
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:52,759
says VSL is generated.

199
00:04:52,819 --> 00:04:54,120
Here's the link to it, et cetera.

200
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,720
Um, so yeah.

201
00:04:55,779 --> 00:04:57,569
Overall, if you follow through all

202
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,990
of these, uh, as we've been laid

203
00:04:58,990 --> 00:04:59,639
out in the course,

204
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:01,389
you will be making absolutely fire

205
00:05:01,389 --> 00:05:03,000
funnels that are ready to go.

206
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,579
All you got to do is put together

207
00:05:04,579 --> 00:05:06,610
kind of the ClickFunnels pages and

208
00:05:06,689 --> 00:05:07,560
get whoever's going to be,

209
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:08,709
you know, performing these sort

210
00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:10,189
of, uh, scripts to actually record

211
00:05:10,189 --> 00:05:11,160
the videos.

212
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:12,220
And then you're pretty much good

213
00:05:12,269 --> 00:05:12,519
to go.

214
00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:14,899
So, uh, any questions feel free to

215
00:05:14,899 --> 00:05:16,129
hit me up and I will see you guys

216
00:05:16,209 --> 00:05:17,000
in the next one.

217
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:18,360
Peace.
