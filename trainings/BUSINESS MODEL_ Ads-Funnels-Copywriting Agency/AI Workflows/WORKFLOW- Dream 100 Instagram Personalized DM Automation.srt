1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:02,930
What's up guys Lucas here again.

2
00:00:03,049 --> 00:00:04,379
So today I'm going to be showing

3
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:05,440
you what I think is actually

4
00:00:05,509 --> 00:00:07,379
a super interesting and useful

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,419
flow for basically every agency

6
00:00:09,419 --> 00:00:10,000
type.

7
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,279
It doesn't matter if you're

8
00:00:11,349 --> 00:00:13,109
running a funnel agency, an

9
00:00:13,109 --> 00:00:15,220
e-commerce email agency, a lead

10
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:17,339
gen agency, any sort of agency,

11
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:18,730
this is going to work both for you

12
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:20,149
personally and for your clients on

13
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:20,809
outreach.

14
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:22,640
So let's take a look

15
00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:23,420
at what it does.

16
00:00:23,829 --> 00:00:24,789
Essentially I'm going to start off

17
00:00:24,789 --> 00:00:26,010
by as usual by breaking down the

18
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:26,739
prerequisites

19
00:00:26,809 --> 00:00:28,149
you're going to need, what each

20
00:00:28,149 --> 00:00:29,519
node does and how the flow works

21
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:30,070
overall.

22
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:32,219
So what it does is it

23
00:00:32,289 --> 00:00:33,770
essentially takes a list of

24
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:35,020
Instagram accounts.

25
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:36,859
Now this is why it's perfect for

26
00:00:36,859 --> 00:00:38,320
Dream 100 outreach

27
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:39,079
specifically.

28
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:40,670
You're going to input a list of a

29
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:42,409
hundred creators that you directly

30
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,070
want to work

31
00:00:43,189 --> 00:00:43,469
with.

32
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:44,710
Then what it does is after these

33
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,219
are added to a Google sheet, which

34
00:00:46,219 --> 00:00:47,340
I'll show you in a moment,

35
00:00:47,409 --> 00:00:49,509
it gets the Instagram account

36
00:00:49,509 --> 00:00:50,119
data.

37
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,369
It gets the recent post data.

38
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:54,079
If it is an image post,

39
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:55,829
it sends it to ChatGPT to analyze

40
00:00:55,829 --> 00:00:57,420
the image, to make a comment on

41
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:57,920
it.

42
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,369
And if it's not an image

43
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:01,399
post, if it's a video, it simply

44
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:03,100
takes the caption and makes a

45
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:04,980
personalized DM based on the

46
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:05,299
caption.

47
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:06,799
Then it stores that message back

48
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:08,030
in the sheet for you to send

49
00:01:08,349 --> 00:01:08,629
manually.

50
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:10,780
So starting off, we're going to

51
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:12,390
need the Google sheet.

52
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:13,840
Now over here, you'll see I've got

53
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,019
a little

54
00:01:14,629 --> 00:01:15,510
explaining a lot of this and

55
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,730
there's actually a link here, make

56
00:01:16,769 --> 00:01:18,319
a copy of this Google sheet and

57
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:19,040
I've made this available.

58
00:01:19,109 --> 00:01:20,290
So this is what the sheet looks

59
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:20,629
like.

60
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23,450
It has just the account, the full

61
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:25,280
name, the biography, and the

62
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:25,780
message.

63
00:01:25,849 --> 00:01:27,519
So you're going to want to do

64
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:29,620
file, make a copy and copy this to

65
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:31,349
your own Google Drive.

66
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:34,159
And then you will set that in

67
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:34,159
here.

68
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:35,659
If you double click on this node,

69
00:01:35,659 --> 00:01:37,629
just connect your Google sheets

70
00:01:37,689 --> 00:01:39,640
account and set up your, make sure

71
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,090
the document is selected with the

72
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:42,260
right sheet name.

73
00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:44,400
Then what it does is either when

74
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,799
you click execute workflow or on a

75
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,319
schedule, which currently we've

76
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:50,000
got set to every 24 hours, but you

77
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,840
can change that to wherever you

78
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,180
want.

79
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:52,599
Or as I said, just do it manually,

80
00:01:52,659 --> 00:01:53,680
just disconnect that schedule

81
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:54,250
trigger.

82
00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:56,280
It will fetch the Instagram

83
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,560
account data.

84
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,670
Now, as I said, you have to fill

85
00:01:58,670 --> 00:01:59,700
this sheet out manually.

86
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:00,390
This is on purpose.

87
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:01,409
This is for Dream 100.

88
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,799
This should all be people that you

89
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,159
specifically want to work with,

90
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:05,609
you've already created

91
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:06,739
deliverables for, et cetera.

92
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:08,819
So we'll get that account data.

93
00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:11,099
All this does is it runs the Apify

94
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:12,310
actor, you're going to have to set

95
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:13,330
up Apify with this, as we talked

96
00:02:13,409 --> 00:02:14,490
about in previous ones before.

97
00:02:14,629 --> 00:02:16,400
Just connect your Apify account.

98
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,569
All these settings will be the

99
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:17,780
same.

100
00:02:18,509 --> 00:02:20,379
And then it will get the Instagram

101
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:22,169
profile of get the data of that

102
00:02:22,169 --> 00:02:23,400
Apify actor run.

103
00:02:23,469 --> 00:02:25,340
Then we will get there was recent

104
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,409
post data and we'll get that post

105
00:02:27,409 --> 00:02:28,150
data run.

106
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:29,759
Then we'll aggregate all of it

107
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:30,500
together.

108
00:02:30,569 --> 00:02:32,669
Now, if it is an image post, we

109
00:02:32,689 --> 00:02:35,060
will fetch the latest image post.

110
00:02:35,129 --> 00:02:36,199
We'll get download the actual

111
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:37,860
photo itself and we will send it

112
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,650
to ChatGPT, which will create an

113
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:40,879
analysis of that image.

114
00:02:40,949 --> 00:02:42,770
As you can see here, I used a

115
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:46,860
photo of a one of my own, my own

116
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:47,719
Instagram photo of me and my

117
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:48,289
girlfriend.

118
00:02:48,509 --> 00:02:49,919
And it explains in detail what is

119
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:50,680
in the photo.

120
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,479
Then it sends that to our

121
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:54,599
personalized DM writer.

122
00:02:54,669 --> 00:02:55,719
There's some things you're going

123
00:02:55,719 --> 00:02:56,680
to have to edit in here ever so

124
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,180
slightly.

125
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:00,430
So this is done in JSON format for

126
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,439
the best output.

127
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:04,270
If you scroll down, the things

128
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:05,400
you're going to have to change

129
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:07,500
here are going to be your booking

130
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,500
link, your primary service.

131
00:03:09,569 --> 00:03:10,930
So change that to whatever your

132
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:12,469
primary service is, your booking

133
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:14,199
link, which you will change here,

134
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:16,020
just your calendar in there.

135
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:17,360
Obviously, it's a basic cal.com

136
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,060
placeholder.

137
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:20,479
And then your sign-off name.

138
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:21,629
Everything else here you can go

139
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:22,879
through and see yourself, you can

140
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:23,979
change it to true or false.

141
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:25,509
But I would suggest keeping

142
00:03:25,509 --> 00:03:27,580
everything pretty much the same.

143
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:29,949
Then if we go down to the system

144
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,699
message here, you will see it

145
00:03:32,699 --> 00:03:35,490
explains how this works and what

146
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:36,560
it does.

147
00:03:36,629 --> 00:03:38,120
Just give it rules for exactly how

148
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,610
it should operate when writing a

149
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:39,889
DM.

150
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:42,969
So once that is done, you've got

151
00:03:42,969 --> 00:03:44,960
to change actually here as well.

152
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:46,409
Just change your, in sentence

153
00:03:46,409 --> 00:03:47,969
five, you're going to change the

154
00:03:48,009 --> 00:03:49,050
sign-off name here.

155
00:03:49,169 --> 00:03:50,099
Mine's set to Lucas, obviously.

156
00:03:50,189 --> 00:03:51,099
Change that to your name.

157
00:03:51,229 --> 00:03:53,310
So then when you run that, it will

158
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:55,250
create a personalized DM and it

159
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:57,069
will add that message to the

160
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:57,939
account.

161
00:03:58,009 --> 00:03:59,300
If we go back here, you'll see

162
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,909
it's added to this message here.

163
00:04:01,009 --> 00:04:02,379
Let me make this a little bit

164
00:04:02,379 --> 00:04:02,879
wider.

165
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:07,159
So it gives us a perfect kind of

166
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:08,039
DM.

167
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:23,509
So that's what it does.

168
00:04:23,649 --> 00:04:25,899
It creates personalized DMs for

169
00:04:25,899 --> 00:04:28,540
your Dream 100 prospects.

170
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:30,079
So again, you're going to need to

171
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,699
set up Apify, as we've had to set

172
00:04:31,699 --> 00:04:33,439
up in a bunch of other workflows.

173
00:04:33,509 --> 00:04:34,800
You will need to connect your,

174
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,050
copy the Google Sheet and make

175
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:37,459
sure it's connected up in the

176
00:04:37,459 --> 00:04:37,980
Google Sheet.

177
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:40,410
And you will need to modify the AI

178
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,160
agent with your name and booking

179
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,680
link and business type in order to

180
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,500
get the output that you want.

181
00:04:47,569 --> 00:04:50,600
So that's how the flow works.

182
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:52,139
Super useful, again, for any type

183
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:52,759
of agency.

184
00:04:52,829 --> 00:04:53,959
You could use this without doing

185
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:55,129
lead gen for your own clients.

186
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:56,829
And I think it's going to be very,

187
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:58,560
very useful for all you guys.

188
00:04:58,629 --> 00:04:59,540
So I hope you enjoy this one and

189
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,500
see you in the next one.

190
00:05:00,629 --> 00:05:01,060
Peace.
