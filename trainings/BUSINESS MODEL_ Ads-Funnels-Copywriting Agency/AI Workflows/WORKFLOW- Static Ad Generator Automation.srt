1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,200
What's up guys, Lucas here.

2
00:00:02,319 --> 00:00:03,649
So I'm going to be running you

3
00:00:03,649 --> 00:00:06,459
through the Static Ad Generator

4
00:00:06,459 --> 00:00:07,219
workflow.

5
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:09,400
So essentially what this one looks

6
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,470
like is we have, as usual, a form

7
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:12,179
input.

8
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:13,859
In here we put the client's

9
00:00:13,859 --> 00:00:15,480
business name, service

10
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,850
description, the website, target

11
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:19,410
audience, key benefits, brand

12
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:20,960
style, primary brand colors.

13
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,469
They can do, you can actually do

14
00:00:22,469 --> 00:00:23,760
like the hex codes for this or

15
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:25,320
just like the actual names of the

16
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:25,920
colors.

17
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:28,449
Returning client, yes or no.

18
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:31,239
And then we send that information

19
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:33,429
to an AI agent that creates ad

20
00:00:33,429 --> 00:00:34,539
concepts.

21
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,070
So you can see here, we put the

22
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:37,979
information from the business, put

23
00:00:37,979 --> 00:00:39,719
their website in here, their

24
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:41,399
target audience, all the

25
00:00:41,429 --> 00:00:42,659
information we got from the form.

26
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:44,799
And we have given this agent

27
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:47,469
specifically access to SERP API,

28
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:50,079
which as we talked about before in

29
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:51,539
a previous one,

30
00:00:51,579 --> 00:00:54,619
we go to SERP API.com is Google

31
00:00:54,619 --> 00:00:56,079
search API.

32
00:00:56,119 --> 00:00:58,810
So you register there and then add

33
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:01,429
your API key there and we're good

34
00:01:01,429 --> 00:01:02,259
to go.

35
00:01:02,299 --> 00:01:04,079
Then we split those prompts for

36
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:05,060
processing.

37
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:06,799
So we'll get out a basic JSON with

38
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:08,620
a ton of information in here about

39
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:10,359
all the different prompts.

40
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,599
And if you go to here, you can see

41
00:01:11,689 --> 00:01:11,879
it.

42
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,390
These are all three different

43
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:15,140
prompts and the information we've

44
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:16,420
got from the AI agent.

45
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,459
So over here, we split these out.

46
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:19,379
As you can see, there's three

47
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:19,730
items.

48
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:20,959
What we've got for each of them,

49
00:01:21,049 --> 00:01:21,959
we'll have the psychology

50
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:23,049
framework, the headline,

51
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:24,450
subheadline, body copy, CTA, all

52
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:25,340
that stuff there.

53
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:26,849
We aggregate that and then we send

54
00:01:26,849 --> 00:01:28,150
it to, we want to create three

55
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:29,069
different ads.

56
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,390
So we just have three different

57
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:31,719
ones here that I'll create.

58
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,950
This one creates from JSON image

59
00:01:34,209 --> 00:01:35,219
prompt zero.

60
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:37,150
Then this one creates one from

61
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:38,500
image prompt one and this one

62
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,010
creates from image prompt two,

63
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:41,359
just to make variations.

64
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:42,629
So if you look here, I've actually

65
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,599
done this one already.

66
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,760
And you see if the output, if you

67
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,680
go to the binary node and go to

68
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,680
view, here is what we see.

69
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:51,209
So this is what the ad we've

70
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:53,370
created for my company Innovative.

71
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:56,049
And then we run through the usual

72
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:57,780
final setup, check, are they

73
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,079
returning client?

74
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,230
This information comes from the

75
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:01,159
form at the beginning.

76
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,579
You'll have selected yes or no.

77
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:03,730
And then we search the client

78
00:02:03,939 --> 00:02:05,120
folder, upload to Google Drive,

79
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,340
not create the client folder,

80
00:02:06,489 --> 00:02:07,620
upload to Google Drive.

81
00:02:07,659 --> 00:02:09,849
And then success response.

82
00:02:10,379 --> 00:02:12,319
And then we can throw at the end a

83
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,580
Slack message or, you know, we can

84
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,729
just have that set to create that

85
00:02:16,729 --> 00:02:18,750
and put that in the Google Drive

86
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:19,659
for us.

87
00:02:19,699 --> 00:02:21,090
So that's what we're looking at

88
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:22,860
there for the static ad generator.

89
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,719
This is obviously super useful if

90
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:26,520
you are making ads for clients at

91
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,449
scale, if you're running funnels

92
00:02:28,449 --> 00:02:29,909
for them, if you want to just

93
00:02:29,909 --> 00:02:31,300
create a bunch of ad concepts.

94
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:32,500
You can do a few different things.

95
00:02:32,539 --> 00:02:34,669
Like, for instance, in here, you

96
00:02:34,669 --> 00:02:36,650
can change the resolution of the

97
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:37,539
ad itself.

98
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:39,020
So you can do kind of horizontal

99
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:40,280
or vertical or square.

100
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,000
We're using the GPT Image 1 model

101
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,969
for this.

102
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:45,060
So far, this does seem to be the

103
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:45,520
best one.

104
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,979
It may be a case that the new

105
00:02:46,979 --> 00:02:48,539
Google Nano Banana might be

106
00:02:48,539 --> 00:02:49,210
better.

107
00:02:49,259 --> 00:02:50,919
But for now, GPT Image 1 is kind

108
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:52,639
of best of following, you know,

109
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:54,560
prompted variants, it seems, with

110
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,180
text and things like that.

111
00:02:56,219 --> 00:02:57,150
So it's probably what we're going

112
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:57,879
to stick with for now.

113
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,840
But, yeah, super useful one for

114
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,650
just making ads, static ads at

115
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:03,199
scale.

116
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,520
As you can see, this is a much

117
00:03:04,669 --> 00:03:05,759
shorter flow than some of the

118
00:03:05,789 --> 00:03:07,250
other ones we've done because it's

119
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:08,460
a very simple process.

120
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,620
But this is pretty much ready to

121
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:12,860
go and should get you some really

122
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,009
good results for your first few

123
00:03:15,009 --> 00:03:16,110
static ads.

124
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:17,960
And you can always modify, you

125
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,810
know, kind of the prompt and kind

126
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:22,080
of what you're looking for by just

127
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,159
messing around with the, you know,

128
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:26,199
information we have here in the AI

129
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:26,819
agent.

130
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,240
All this is pretty detailed as it

131
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,039
currently is.

132
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,180
But feel free to, you know, modify

133
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:33,090
this and see if you can, maybe if

134
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:34,639
you want to change up how it

135
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,500
operates or what it does or kind

136
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,360
of the type of ads you're looking

137
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:39,080
for.

138
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,050
But a lot of that should be

139
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,050
affected by simply just the

140
00:03:41,139 --> 00:03:42,430
different things like the target

141
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:43,740
audience, the brand style, the

142
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,139
primary brand colors, things like

143
00:03:45,139 --> 00:03:45,599
that.

144
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:47,810
So, yeah, that's the static ad

145
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:48,879
generator.

146
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:50,460
And let me know if you have any

147
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:51,080
issues.

148
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:51,909
And I will see you guys in the

149
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:52,300
next one.

150
00:03:52,419 --> 00:03:52,800
Peace.
