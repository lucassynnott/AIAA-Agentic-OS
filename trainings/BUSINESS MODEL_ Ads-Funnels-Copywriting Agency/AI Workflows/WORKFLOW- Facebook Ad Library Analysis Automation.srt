1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,260
What's up guys, Lucas here.

2
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:01,980
So today we're going to be looking

3
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:03,169
at the Facebook ad analysis

4
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:03,819
workflow.

5
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:05,650
Essentially what this does is it

6
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:08,699
lets you input a keyword for an ad

7
00:00:08,779 --> 00:00:09,509
that you're creating

8
00:00:09,769 --> 00:00:10,960
and it will then search the

9
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:12,689
Facebook ads library for any ads

10
00:00:12,689 --> 00:00:14,380
that match those keywords.

11
00:00:14,589 --> 00:00:17,320
It will analyze them and then help

12
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:20,199
you rewrite the copy to what kind

13
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:21,089
of personalize it for

14
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:22,829
your product or for your funnel

15
00:00:22,829 --> 00:00:24,250
and then it will save it to a

16
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:25,640
Google Sheet for you.

17
00:00:26,469 --> 00:00:28,089
This is very helpful for getting

18
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:29,980
ads in bulk and rewriting a bulk

19
00:00:30,019 --> 00:00:30,760
and, you know, kind

20
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:32,390
of modifying it for your own sort

21
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:34,009
of use case for your, either for

22
00:00:34,009 --> 00:00:35,240
your clients or for your

23
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,079
own ads and content.

24
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:39,670
So let's take a look at what we

25
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:40,439
have here.

26
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:41,670
As usual, I'm going to run through

27
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:42,899
the prerequisites you're going to

28
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:43,570
need for this.

29
00:00:43,619 --> 00:00:45,140
I'm going to run through what each

30
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:46,539
node does and how it works.

31
00:00:46,659 --> 00:00:48,130
So first of all, very simply,

32
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:49,840
you're going to need an account on

33
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,600
apify.com, apify.com.

34
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:53,030
This is the scraper we're going to

35
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:54,340
be using and I'll be giving you a

36
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:55,119
link to this.

37
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:56,530
I'll explain a little bit later

38
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:58,109
why you should take a look at this

39
00:00:58,109 --> 00:00:58,950
page, but you will need

40
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,649
an apify account to sign up and

41
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:05,060
you are, it's connected over here

42
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:06,879
by just using apify account.

43
00:01:07,019 --> 00:01:08,739
It's just a quick single sign in

44
00:01:08,739 --> 00:01:10,709
button and you'll be good to go.

45
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:11,879
The next thing you're going to

46
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:12,879
need is a Google Sheet.

47
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:14,040
And I would suggest that again,

48
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,030
I'll be sharing this sheet as

49
00:01:15,129 --> 00:01:15,780
well, but it's just

50
00:01:15,969 --> 00:01:17,530
you just name it the exact same or

51
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:19,019
just copy this Facebook ads

52
00:01:19,019 --> 00:01:20,599
library analyzer db.

53
00:01:21,069 --> 00:01:22,129
And we're going to need all these

54
00:01:22,129 --> 00:01:22,819
headers here.

55
00:01:22,819 --> 00:01:24,700
I'll go through these later on and

56
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:27,079
explain why, but, uh, probably

57
00:01:27,209 --> 00:01:27,780
just, I will make the

58
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:29,069
sheet available for copy and you

59
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:30,480
can just copy it to yours and then

60
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,280
just modify it.

61
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,959
Uh, I mean, you need to, so let's

62
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:34,480
start by going through each of the

63
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:34,819
nodes.

64
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:36,500
As usual, we have an on-form

65
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:37,439
submission.

66
00:01:37,579 --> 00:01:38,319
This is a pretty basic one.

67
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:39,609
We're just using it for keywords.

68
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,099
Uh, that's all we need at the

69
00:01:41,099 --> 00:01:41,700
moment.

70
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,409
So as you can see here, I already

71
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:44,569
have some data pinned.

72
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:46,060
I just searched athletic greens.

73
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:47,519
Cause I know that it's a popular,

74
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:49,040
uh, brand that runs many ads.

75
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:51,400
So then our apify ad library

76
00:01:51,469 --> 00:01:54,099
scraper is going to search the

77
00:01:54,099 --> 00:01:55,840
Facebook ad library for athletic

78
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:56,359
greens.

79
00:01:56,609 --> 00:01:58,719
Now, if we go here, we've got, we

80
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,189
call the input J S O N.

81
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:01,790
And this is why I'm going to give

82
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:03,250
you a link to the apify ad scraper

83
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:03,700
page.

84
00:02:03,819 --> 00:02:05,260
If you go back here, you can see

85
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:07,239
all these different, uh, settings

86
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:07,359
here.

87
00:02:07,489 --> 00:02:09,270
So keywords, uh, the max results

88
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:10,860
per page, you can choose the

89
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,710
target countries, the language,

90
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:14,319
the publisher platforms, the

91
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,060
status filter, like active ads or

92
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:18,599
inactive ads, uh, the category

93
00:02:18,849 --> 00:02:20,210
media, media type, the from date,

94
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:21,699
a ton of different stuff here.

95
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,849
So what I would suggest that you

96
00:02:23,949 --> 00:02:25,949
do here is modify this for your

97
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:27,139
own use case.

98
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:29,189
The moment you have it just set to

99
00:02:29,189 --> 00:02:30,819
look in all countries for a

100
00:02:30,819 --> 00:02:33,080
maximum number of 100 ads

101
00:02:33,379 --> 00:02:35,050
and just our search query.

102
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,340
So our keyword.

103
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,379
So maybe you want to set it to

104
00:02:38,409 --> 00:02:39,740
only United States.

105
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:41,550
So maybe you want to get 500 ads,

106
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:42,439
not 100.

107
00:02:42,689 --> 00:02:44,590
And, uh, maybe you want only

108
00:02:44,689 --> 00:02:46,250
active ads or in specific

109
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:47,180
category.

110
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:49,330
Once you've set all these in here.

111
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,310
So let's say you do, uh, United

112
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,169
States.

113
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,360
And then let's say you only want

114
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,900
active ads, uh, say media types.

115
00:02:58,219 --> 00:03:00,900
You only want, uh, video ads.

116
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,509
Once you do that, if you go up

117
00:03:03,509 --> 00:03:05,159
here to this manual at J S O N,

118
00:03:05,289 --> 00:03:06,360
click J S O N.

119
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:08,860
You can copy and paste this into

120
00:03:08,909 --> 00:03:11,939
our API input JSON here like this.

121
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:13,189
Now, one thing we're going to

122
00:03:13,189 --> 00:03:14,729
change here is after you do that.

123
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,289
So as you see, we drew over the

124
00:03:16,289 --> 00:03:18,240
active status ads, the country,

125
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,919
the Microsoft is still a hundred

126
00:03:19,969 --> 00:03:22,259
videos, but let's just under

127
00:03:22,259 --> 00:03:23,740
search queries, remove this

128
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:26,599
keyword here and drag and drop

129
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:28,180
over our Facebook ad library

130
00:03:28,259 --> 00:03:28,620
keyword.

131
00:03:28,789 --> 00:03:29,909
And now you can see we're on a

132
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:31,500
search for athletic greens.

133
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:33,319
So I would consider making that

134
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:34,830
change or just using this to

135
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:37,199
basically, you know, determine the

136
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:38,740
different, uh, kind of, uh,

137
00:03:38,889 --> 00:03:40,400
filters you want to set when

138
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,500
you're searching the ad library.

139
00:03:41,689 --> 00:03:44,490
So with that done, then, uh, you,

140
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:46,900
we run this and it will scrape a

141
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,740
number of ads for us.

142
00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:50,560
Then very simply, this is a wait

143
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,030
node.

144
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,569
It waits for about 10 seconds,

145
00:03:52,629 --> 00:03:53,819
just to make sure that the data

146
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:54,909
set has been saved to API.

147
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,819
And then we get the data set just

148
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:58,639
there and you can see we got 50

149
00:03:58,699 --> 00:04:00,080
items in, in total.

150
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:02,090
Now these are a ton of different

151
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:04,169
ads, including the ad URL, the

152
00:04:04,259 --> 00:04:06,560
text, uh, the image, uh, of the

153
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,319
ads, stuff like that.

154
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:09,569
Then we filter it for likes.

155
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,400
We don't want to pull in every ad.

156
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,860
You know, there's a lot of ads by

157
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:14,419
many smaller Facebook pages.

158
00:04:14,539 --> 00:04:16,040
It's very simply we just filter

159
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,910
that if the Facebook page has, uh,

160
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:19,759
more than a thousand likes on the

161
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,839
page, then we send those ads

162
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:22,160
through.

163
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:24,480
And then we go down from 50 to 13.

164
00:04:24,699 --> 00:04:26,279
Now here's where it decides if

165
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:28,000
it's video image or text.

166
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:29,560
Let's start by going through

167
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:29,990
image.

168
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,990
So if it is in, actually I'll

169
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,800
start with video.

170
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,680
So we go through video.

171
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:34,680
If it's a video ad, it will send

172
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,420
it up here where we will download

173
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:38,000
the video from Facebook and upload

174
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,720
that video to Google drive.

175
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,819
After that, we will begin our

176
00:04:41,819 --> 00:04:43,550
Gemini upload session.

177
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:45,089
Now, essentially the way this

178
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,670
works is that with Google Gemini,

179
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:47,839
you don't directly upload the

180
00:04:47,899 --> 00:04:48,120
video.

181
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,269
You start a upload session to tell

182
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:52,360
the AI to prepare for something

183
00:04:52,509 --> 00:04:53,720
being uploaded.

184
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,959
So one thing you're going to need

185
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:56,220
to set in here is your API key.

186
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:57,920
So by clicking here, you'll see

187
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,019
right here, the first query

188
00:04:59,089 --> 00:05:00,490
parameter we have is key and your

189
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,759
API key goes here to get that.

190
00:05:02,949 --> 00:05:04,629
You're going to go to just Google,

191
00:05:04,629 --> 00:05:05,759
Google AI studio.

192
00:05:06,009 --> 00:05:07,629
Once you find the Google AI studio

193
00:05:07,629 --> 00:05:09,319
page, you will log in with your

194
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:10,540
Google account.

195
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,850
Then you'll go to dashboard API

196
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:15,100
keys, click create API key, and it

197
00:05:15,329 --> 00:05:17,040
will ask you to either create or

198
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,980
choose from a previous project

199
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,040
that you had.

200
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,509
So you just do it there and create

201
00:05:21,509 --> 00:05:23,079
an API key in existing project.

202
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,160
You'll get your API key, paste it

203
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,910
in here, and then this node will

204
00:05:27,139 --> 00:05:28,220
work perfectly.

205
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:30,259
It will simply start a Gemini

206
00:05:30,259 --> 00:05:32,269
upload session after the session

207
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:33,439
is uploaded.

208
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:34,589
It's now waiting for us to upload

209
00:05:34,589 --> 00:05:35,139
the video.

210
00:05:35,259 --> 00:05:36,819
So we're going to re-download the

211
00:05:36,819 --> 00:05:38,470
video from Google drive and then

212
00:05:38,569 --> 00:05:40,319
upload the video to Gemini for

213
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:41,339
processing.

214
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,490
Again, you'll need to put your API

215
00:05:43,589 --> 00:05:44,240
key in here.

216
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,089
Then we wait till that's done, and

217
00:05:47,089 --> 00:05:49,209
then we analyze the video with

218
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:51,610
Gemini, also need to put your API

219
00:05:51,769 --> 00:05:52,620
key in here.

220
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,250
Gemini will analyze the video,

221
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:55,149
break it down.

222
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,540
We've got a prompt in here telling

223
00:05:56,569 --> 00:05:57,819
it what we're looking for.

224
00:05:57,819 --> 00:05:58,980
It's just going to describe the

225
00:05:58,980 --> 00:05:59,720
video in detail.

226
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:02,360
Then when that's done, we output

227
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,689
the video summary to our AI over

228
00:06:04,949 --> 00:06:05,600
here.

229
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,509
Now, this is the, uh, the

230
00:06:08,509 --> 00:06:10,300
parenting about what it modifies.

231
00:06:10,449 --> 00:06:12,300
So this is the one that says your

232
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,029
task is take an input as a script

233
00:06:14,029 --> 00:06:14,970
JavaScript object from an

234
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:16,000
advertisement of the Facebook ad

235
00:06:16,089 --> 00:06:17,540
library and then summarize it and

236
00:06:17,689 --> 00:06:19,459
spin, repurpose, re-write the ad

237
00:06:19,459 --> 00:06:19,720
copy.

238
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:20,699
You're doing this for Siege

239
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:22,079
Intelligence, we're always looking

240
00:06:22,149 --> 00:06:23,279
at what our competitor advertisers

241
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:23,879
are doing.

242
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,250
Then we have some rules that we

243
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:26,779
tell it to follow, but we might

244
00:06:26,779 --> 00:06:28,410
want to modify this or add more to

245
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:29,819
this to, you know, give details

246
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:30,420
about your, your,

247
00:06:30,689 --> 00:06:32,259
uh, product or your service,

248
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:34,069
whatever it is that you're trying

249
00:06:34,069 --> 00:06:35,699
to advertise in order for it to

250
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:37,449
rewrite the winning ads for your

251
00:06:37,449 --> 00:06:39,079
brand or, uh, service.

252
00:06:39,389 --> 00:06:40,990
Then after that is added to our

253
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,269
Google sheet and then simply waits

254
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:45,019
and then does this again for

255
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:47,310
however many videos have been sent

256
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:49,519
through image works very

257
00:06:49,589 --> 00:06:50,600
similarly, but it's a bit more

258
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,199
straightforward.

259
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,350
If it's an image ad, then it will

260
00:06:53,449 --> 00:06:55,879
download the image from Facebook,

261
00:06:55,879 --> 00:06:57,879
then it will send that image

262
00:06:57,879 --> 00:06:59,660
directly to chat GPT.

263
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,129
And while we'll ask it is what is

264
00:07:02,129 --> 00:07:03,889
in the image be comprehensive.

265
00:07:04,129 --> 00:07:05,829
And then here is where we again,

266
00:07:05,889 --> 00:07:07,649
have a similar prompt where we

267
00:07:07,649 --> 00:07:09,379
break down, uh, tell it to break

268
00:07:09,379 --> 00:07:09,620
it down.

269
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:11,560
And rewrite the, uh, copy for what

270
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,509
we're, uh, uh, our own products.

271
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:17,199
And then we output this to our,

272
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:19,779
uh, Google sheet here.

273
00:07:19,779 --> 00:07:20,740
You can see we have the page type

274
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:21,060
and ID.

275
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:23,379
We've got the page name, the URL,

276
00:07:23,379 --> 00:07:24,910
the summary of the ad, the

277
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:26,680
rewritten ad copy.

278
00:07:27,189 --> 00:07:28,870
Uh, the image prompt time is what

279
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:30,389
it was in the image, then the

280
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,199
image URL.

281
00:07:31,449 --> 00:07:33,560
And then finally, if it's just a

282
00:07:33,629 --> 00:07:36,240
text ad, uh, which is unlikely,

283
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,160
but possible, then it just does

284
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:38,720
the same thing.

285
00:07:38,899 --> 00:07:41,170
We just send it to the, uh, AI to

286
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:43,720
analyze the copy, uh, to, uh,

287
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,180
output it into the ad library,

288
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:47,839
along with all of the other, uh,

289
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:49,560
details of page ID, type, added

290
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,629
page name, all sorts of stuff.

291
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:52,870
So, uh, yeah, this is super

292
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:54,399
useful, you know, if you're

293
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:56,160
looking to write ads at scale and

294
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,509
you want to kind of copy your

295
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:58,819
competitors' ads or people in the

296
00:07:58,819 --> 00:08:00,480
industry who are doing well, uh,

297
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,439
basically you can see, you know,

298
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:02,449
if an ad has been running for a

299
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:03,819
long period of time and it is

300
00:08:03,819 --> 00:08:05,279
still active, it's likely a

301
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:07,319
winning ad in that keyword search.

302
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:08,620
So it's probably going to get to

303
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:09,800
try a variation of it or some

304
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,120
similar sort of copy to it.

305
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,680
So this is an easy way to get that

306
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,269
in bulk.

307
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:14,529
You should end up with a Google

308
00:08:14,529 --> 00:08:16,019
sheet that is filled with, uh, you

309
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:17,480
know, ad information that you can

310
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:18,980
analyze yourself or just review.

311
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:20,500
As long with rewritten, uh, copy

312
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,759
that, you know, you can use for

313
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,970
your, your own ads and your own

314
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:23,720
content.

315
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:25,410
So hope this one is useful and see

316
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:26,579
you in the next one.

317
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:27,180
Peace.
