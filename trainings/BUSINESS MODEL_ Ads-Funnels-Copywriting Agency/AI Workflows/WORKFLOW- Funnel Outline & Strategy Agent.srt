1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,000
What's up guys?

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,089
Lucas here.

3
00:00:02,229 --> 00:00:03,500
So I'm going to be breaking down

4
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:04,950
for you the funnel outline and

5
00:00:05,059 --> 00:00:06,299
strategy builder workflow.

6
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:07,700
As usual in these videos, I'll be

7
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:09,080
going over the different nodes

8
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:11,150
that we're using, how they work,

9
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:13,199
the end result we're going to get,

10
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:14,699
and we'll go into a bit of

11
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:15,839
detail in the preview because

12
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:17,019
you're going to need to run this

13
00:00:17,019 --> 00:00:17,519
workflow.

14
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:18,620
Luckily, there's not too

15
00:00:18,679 --> 00:00:19,850
many for this one.

16
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:21,589
You need open writer setup as

17
00:00:21,589 --> 00:00:23,820
usual as with the other workflows.

18
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:24,679
You will need

19
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:26,199
your Google Drive set up with a

20
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:27,420
folder named clients.

21
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:28,809
You will always need a folder

22
00:00:28,809 --> 00:00:29,239
named

23
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:30,730
clients as we're storing all of

24
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:32,320
our information on our clients,

25
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:34,030
and you will need Slack connected

26
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:34,479
to do

27
00:00:34,539 --> 00:00:34,829
that.

28
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:36,200
Again, you will just connect with

29
00:00:36,409 --> 00:00:37,820
Slack normally, and that's to send

30
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:38,659
you a notification

31
00:00:38,829 --> 00:00:41,520
about the workflow completion.

32
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,969
So let's see how this starts.

33
00:00:43,969 --> 00:00:45,090
It's a form.

34
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,829
Very simply, it's a

35
00:00:46,909 --> 00:00:48,460
detailed form that goes over the

36
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:49,950
client's details about their

37
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:50,500
funnel.

38
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:51,869
So the business and product

39
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,170
name, what type of business they

40
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:54,509
are, the industry and niche, the

41
00:00:54,509 --> 00:00:56,060
ideal customer, the primary funnel

42
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:57,740
objective, the core offer price,

43
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:59,250
the stage their business is at,

44
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:00,600
their top three to five customer

45
00:01:00,659 --> 00:01:01,850
pain points, what makes them

46
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:03,090
different, primary traffic

47
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:04,540
sources, what funnel elements do

48
00:01:04,549 --> 00:01:04,780
they

49
00:01:04,859 --> 00:01:05,549
already have?

50
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:07,000
If they have none, that's fine,

51
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:08,329
but if they have any, put them in

52
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:08,980
there.

53
00:01:09,129 --> 00:01:10,239
Successful

54
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:11,609
competitors, their preferred

55
00:01:11,609 --> 00:01:12,870
funnel type, if known, when do

56
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:14,340
they need the funnel live by,

57
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:14,480
their

58
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:15,879
implementation budget, how have we

59
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:16,680
built a funnel for them

60
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,099
previously, and anything else we

61
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:18,540
should know.

62
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:20,590
After that's done, we send it to a

63
00:01:20,629 --> 00:01:22,219
research agent that uses

64
00:01:22,219 --> 00:01:23,480
perplexity to perform

65
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:25,969
deep, deep research on the client

66
00:01:25,969 --> 00:01:28,019
and the funnel based on this

67
00:01:28,019 --> 00:01:28,760
outline here.

68
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,180
So we look for their

69
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:31,079
funnel architecture

70
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:32,670
recommendation, the competitor and

71
00:01:32,709 --> 00:01:34,129
market analysis, psychological

72
00:01:34,189 --> 00:01:34,769
triggers and

73
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,280
persuasion tactics, detailed

74
00:01:36,349 --> 00:01:37,739
funnel stages, the content

75
00:01:37,739 --> 00:01:39,560
strategy by funnel stage, pricing

76
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:39,819
and offer

77
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:41,519
architecture, technology stack and

78
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:43,010
tools, conversion benchmark and

79
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:44,260
KPIs, quick wins and advanced

80
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:45,290
tactics, and a 90-day

81
00:01:45,349 --> 00:01:46,500
implementation roadmap.

82
00:01:46,519 --> 00:01:48,609
Now, again, this is not actually

83
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:49,560
going to write

84
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:51,269
every single piece of the funnel.

85
00:01:51,269 --> 00:01:53,040
We have other workflows for that.

86
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,099
What this is doing is it's

87
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:56,349
creating a detailed strategy

88
00:01:56,349 --> 00:01:57,750
document, and I'll show you what

89
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,000
that looks like near the end of

90
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,049
the

91
00:01:59,140 --> 00:01:59,500
video.

92
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,760
Next thing we have the funnel

93
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,650
outline builder.

94
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:02,870
So this actually builds the

95
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:03,480
outline.

96
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:03,939
What we do

97
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,400
here is we take the research along

98
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,819
with the other information about

99
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:08,280
the client, and we create a funnel

100
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,560
strategy overview, funnel

101
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,900
architecture map, audience

102
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,680
psychology profile, offer strategy

103
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,539
framework, content

104
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:14,710
strategy matrix, conversion

105
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:16,139
optimization strategy, traffic and

106
00:02:16,139 --> 00:02:18,039
scaling roadmap, metrics and KPI

107
00:02:18,099 --> 00:02:19,180
framework, implementation roadmap,

108
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,240
and strategic recommendations.

109
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:23,780
From there, we simply convert the

110
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,259
output from our funnel builder to

111
00:02:25,259 --> 00:02:26,419
markdown formatting.

112
00:02:26,419 --> 00:02:27,960
That's just a very simple markdown

113
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,349
formatter.

114
00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:28,500
It just

115
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,710
tells it to turn that text into a

116
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:32,930
markdown format so that then we

117
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:34,870
can use MD2 docs, which as

118
00:02:34,939 --> 00:02:35,219
mentioned

119
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,650
before, you will need to use your

120
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:38,900
Google Docs OAuth 2 API setup for

121
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:39,400
this.

122
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:41,460
It just creates way nicer

123
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,180
looking Google Docs than using the

124
00:02:43,689 --> 00:02:44,979
Google Docs node directly.

125
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,500
Then we check to see if they're a

126
00:02:46,569 --> 00:02:46,900
returning

127
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,280
client, which we are getting that

128
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,469
information from our form.

129
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:50,599
Simply we said if they were or

130
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:51,620
they were not.

131
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,340
And if they are, then we look for

132
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:54,909
their existing client folder and

133
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:56,659
we move it to the Google Doc to

134
00:02:56,659 --> 00:02:56,659
the

135
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,379
correct folder.

136
00:02:57,379 --> 00:02:58,979
If they're not, we create a new

137
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,599
client folder and then move the

138
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:01,610
doc to that folder

139
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,129
before finally sending you a nice

140
00:03:03,129 --> 00:03:04,699
notification telling you that the

141
00:03:04,729 --> 00:03:06,020
funnel has been created with

142
00:03:06,069 --> 00:03:07,300
a link to the document.

143
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,590
Now let's take a look at that

144
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:10,150
document and see what the actual

145
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:10,810
output of this

146
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:11,219
looks like.

147
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:13,349
I made up a company for this

148
00:03:13,349 --> 00:03:15,849
called Scale with Confidence

149
00:03:15,849 --> 00:03:16,490
Coaching.

150
00:03:16,509 --> 00:03:17,060
As you can see here,

151
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,560
we get the full funnel strategy

152
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,159
overview.

153
00:03:19,289 --> 00:03:20,879
We go through the different stages

154
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,180
of the customer journey.

155
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,610
Then we go into competitive

156
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:25,469
positioning strategy, the funnel

157
00:03:25,469 --> 00:03:26,500
architecture map.

158
00:03:26,509 --> 00:03:28,090
The page types are going

159
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:29,460
to be required for this, the

160
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,280
conversion mechanisms, technology

161
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,969
stack requirements, integration

162
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:34,580
points and automation triggers,

163
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,090
the core emotional drivers, the

164
00:03:36,129 --> 00:03:37,849
sophistication level analysis.

165
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:38,889
It's super detailed.

166
00:03:38,949 --> 00:03:40,349
This is 15 pages straight of

167
00:03:40,349 --> 00:03:41,699
funnel strategies, everything you

168
00:03:41,699 --> 00:03:42,259
possibly need,

169
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:43,610
including an outline of what the

170
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:45,139
email sequence should look like,

171
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:46,740
the story arc development,

172
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,849
authority building elements,

173
00:03:47,849 --> 00:03:49,219
conversion optimization strategy,

174
00:03:49,219 --> 00:03:51,300
the traffic and scaling roadmap.

175
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,020
Super, super detailed.

176
00:03:53,229 --> 00:03:54,340
And the real benefit of this is

177
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:55,250
going to be feeding this to some

178
00:03:55,289 --> 00:03:55,490
of our

179
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:57,159
other funnel builders later on.

180
00:03:57,159 --> 00:03:58,650
So for the funnel copywriter and

181
00:03:58,689 --> 00:04:01,539
for the webinar generator funnel,

182
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:02,740
this is super useful.

183
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,240
And there's a way to add this to

184
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,889
there with that workflow.

185
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,969
So hopefully this is

186
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:10,120
going to be one of the first

187
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:10,900
things you use.

188
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,289
If you're creating a funnel for a

189
00:04:12,289 --> 00:04:13,460
client, it gives you

190
00:04:13,509 --> 00:04:14,969
a great output that you can then

191
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,519
use as the basis for your other

192
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:17,220
elements.

193
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:18,500
And also you can give it to

194
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,389
the client directly to show them

195
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,220
kind of what the strategy is going

196
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:21,139
to look like and what's going to

197
00:04:21,139 --> 00:04:21,300
be

198
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:21,819
involved.

199
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:22,980
It's super detailed as you've

200
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:23,279
seen.

201
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:24,379
It's very impressive and is

202
00:04:24,379 --> 00:04:25,699
actually super useful for

203
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:26,949
you later on when you're writing

204
00:04:26,949 --> 00:04:28,230
the rest of your copy and creating

205
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:30,180
the other elements of the funnel.

206
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,579
So I hope this was helpful.

207
00:04:32,579 --> 00:04:34,899
Any issues, feel free to hit me up

208
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:35,800
and I will see you guys in the

209
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,420
next one.

210
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:37,139
Peace.
