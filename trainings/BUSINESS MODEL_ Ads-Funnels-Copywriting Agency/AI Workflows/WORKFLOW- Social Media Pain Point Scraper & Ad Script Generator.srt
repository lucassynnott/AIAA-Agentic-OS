1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:01,750
- What's up guys, Lucas here.

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:02,839
So today I'm gonna be running you

3
00:00:02,839 --> 00:00:03,229
through

4
00:00:03,319 --> 00:00:05,459
the Reddit to add scripts

5
00:00:05,459 --> 00:00:06,639
workflow.

6
00:00:06,679 --> 00:00:08,240
What this essentially does is you

7
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:08,949
input information

8
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,640
about your product, your client's

9
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:11,080
product,

10
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:13,130
and a subreddit where there's

11
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:14,119
likely users

12
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,329
for that product gonna be talking

13
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:17,480
about it in there.

14
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:19,510
And then what we do here is we

15
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:20,760
research the subreddit.

16
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,160
We get the most common pain points

17
00:00:22,179 --> 00:00:22,809
and issues.

18
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:24,539
We analyze that and we write three

19
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:25,350
ad scripts with it

20
00:00:25,399 --> 00:00:26,760
and move it into Google Drive.

21
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,120
So as usual, we're walking you

22
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,600
through each node,

23
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,199
what it does, and then explaining

24
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:31,920
any prerequisites

25
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:32,880
you might have to have for this.

26
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,039
There is one slightly kind of

27
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:35,560
different setup

28
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,399
we're gonna have to do for this,

29
00:00:36,509 --> 00:00:37,320
but it's not hard to do.

30
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:38,789
It's just to do with the Reddit

31
00:00:38,859 --> 00:00:39,280
API.

32
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,640
So as usual, it comes from a form.

33
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:43,009
You put in these details, the

34
00:00:43,009 --> 00:00:44,439
topic or product name,

35
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:46,479
the client name, returning client,

36
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,640
business product description,

37
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,399
target audience,

38
00:00:48,439 --> 00:00:49,799
content source, drop the URL here.

39
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:50,820
And so like, you know, anything

40
00:00:50,859 --> 00:00:52,399
that is kind of,

41
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:53,240
the more detail you give it,

42
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,079
the better out what you're gonna

43
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:54,320
get.

44
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:55,079
We just kind of put some basic

45
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:55,560
information here

46
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,159
to get started.

47
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,670
Then that's just, this is kind of

48
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:01,390
sets things up properly.

49
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:02,799
Then we send that to a code node

50
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:04,599
that just creates a session ID

51
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,629
for our agent memory here.

52
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,280
As you can see in our agent here,

53
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:09,980
we have a few more nodes connected

54
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:11,519
than we usually do.

55
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:13,260
So we have a chat node selected

56
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:13,680
here.

57
00:01:13,719 --> 00:01:15,000
As usual, it's open writer.

58
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,519
And we're using GPT-03 Pro for

59
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:18,719
this one.

60
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,390
But sometimes we get so much

61
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:21,799
information from Reddit

62
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,480
that it has a problem with the

63
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,430
token limit.

64
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,890
So in case of that, we have

65
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:27,079
enabled a fallback model.

66
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,760
To do that in an agent, you just

67
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,680
go to settings.

68
00:01:29,719 --> 00:01:32,120
And you, sorry, just further down

69
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:32,480
actually,

70
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:34,530
you click the enable fallback

71
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:35,879
model button here.

72
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,519
And then you can set another model

73
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:38,120
to be used

74
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:39,200
if this one doesn't work.

75
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:40,900
So we've just set the Google

76
00:01:41,069 --> 00:01:42,359
Gemini 2.5 Pro,

77
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,609
which has a slightly larger

78
00:01:43,609 --> 00:01:44,359
context window.

79
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,060
So that if this one fails, it'll

80
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:48,000
run this one for it instead.

81
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,000
Then we have a simple memory set

82
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,239
there,

83
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,810
just so it remembers, I think the

84
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:52,000
five most recent kind of chats.

85
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,370
And this is just helpful because

86
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:54,439
we'll get information from here.

87
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,909
They'll talk back to each other.

88
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:58,280
Then we have perplexity over here

89
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,079
as a tool.

90
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,760
Just use your perplexity account.

91
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,349
And we let the model define the

92
00:02:04,349 --> 00:02:05,840
input for it.

93
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:06,819
To do that in some of these,

94
00:02:06,819 --> 00:02:07,480
you'll see these little,

95
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:09,080
this little kind of star icon here

96
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:09,960
besides some of the inputs.

97
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,960
And you can let the model actually

98
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:11,430
determine

99
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,639
what you wanted to put in there

100
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:13,990
and questions you wanted to ask.

101
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:15,120
That's helpful because this is our

102
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:15,699
research agent

103
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,080
that will be creating questions

104
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,000
and ideas to research.

105
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:20,560
And we can send those ideas and

106
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,759
prompts directly perplexity.

107
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,400
Now, here is where the extra setup

108
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,199
is going to come in.

109
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,460
We're using a Reddit tool to

110
00:02:25,509 --> 00:02:26,280
search Reddit.

111
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:27,750
As you can see here, the tool

112
00:02:27,819 --> 00:02:29,120
description is automatically.

113
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:31,169
We're using a Reddit account.

114
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,610
The resource is searching for

115
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:34,400
posts.

116
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:35,870
It's going to search through them

117
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:37,000
all and all of Reddit.

118
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:37,750
Now, we could put that to a

119
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,560
particular subreddit.

120
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:40,030
We could do it for the inputs of

121
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:40,800
Reddit specifically.

122
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,270
But for now, we're going to do all

123
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:42,500
of Reddit

124
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,460
to get as much information as

125
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:43,919
possible.

126
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,900
The keyword is going to be defined

127
00:02:46,069 --> 00:02:47,080
automatically by the model.

128
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,879
And we've limited it to 10, but it

129
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:51,000
can sometimes go

130
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:53,280
like a bunch of really long posts.

131
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:54,180
And that's what affects the

132
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:54,840
context length.

133
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,280
But in order to connect Reddit

134
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:56,539
here,

135
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:57,870
you're going to need to use your

136
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:58,840
Reddit OAuth 2 API.

137
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,759
So if I click the edit here,

138
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:02,280
you'll see the usual kind of OAuth

139
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:02,800
2 setup

140
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,639
that we have where you need a

141
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:04,800
client ID and a client secret.

142
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,930
And it gives you the OAuth

143
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:06,719
redirect URL.

144
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:08,180
To set this up, you're going to go

145
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:08,759
to Reddit.

146
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,080
You'll need an account on Reddit.

147
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,580
So sign up on Reddit and then go

148
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:13,919
to preferences.

149
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,389
You'll see this in the top right

150
00:03:16,389 --> 00:03:17,400
over here.

151
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:18,659
If I just click preferences here,

152
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:19,479
we'll see the page.

153
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,659
And then we're going to go to

154
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:21,080
apps.

155
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,780
When you go to apps, scroll all

156
00:03:22,949 --> 00:03:23,960
the way down to the bottom.

157
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,879
And under developed applications,

158
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:27,430
click create an app or create

159
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:27,960
another app.

160
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,090
And this will give you all the

161
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:30,159
information you need.

162
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:31,159
If I do create another app now,

163
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:32,139
you're going to see it's going to

164
00:03:32,139 --> 00:03:32,919
ask you to put in the name.

165
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,620
Choose web app for the type of

166
00:03:34,789 --> 00:03:35,120
app.

167
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:35,939
You can put it in a description,

168
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:36,819
but it doesn't really matter.

169
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:37,539
The name also doesn't really

170
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:37,840
matter.

171
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:38,319
I just called it.

172
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,110
This will make N8N.

173
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:40,060
You're going to be using it

174
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:40,680
personally.

175
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:41,379
It's linked to your account.

176
00:03:41,419 --> 00:03:41,780
It's fine.

177
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:43,650
So it's whatever name, web app,

178
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:45,180
then the description.

179
00:03:45,219 --> 00:03:46,650
You don't have to put it in an

180
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:47,419
about URL.

181
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,120
But for the redirect URL, you're

182
00:03:49,289 --> 00:03:50,960
going to grab that from the OAuth

183
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,259
redirect URL here.

184
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,129
So you just copy that.

185
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:54,610
And you'll just paste that in.

186
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:56,150
Then you click I'm not a robot and

187
00:03:56,219 --> 00:03:56,990
create app.

188
00:03:57,039 --> 00:03:58,250
I can't do it because it only lets

189
00:03:58,259 --> 00:03:59,680
you create one app per account.

190
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:00,840
But once you do that, it'll give

191
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,699
you your client ID.

192
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:02,750
And it'll give you the client

193
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:04,210
secret after you click create app.

194
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,020
So you just paste those back in

195
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,449
here and it'll connect and you're

196
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:08,300
good to go.

197
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:10,000
So what this does then is it

198
00:04:10,169 --> 00:04:12,430
creates a, we've got it outputting

199
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,199
in JSON.

200
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,460
So it's got a kind of a, you can

201
00:04:14,509 --> 00:04:15,650
see here it's doing sample

202
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:17,329
metadata, total engagement, the

203
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,000
subreddits.

204
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,649
It searched through the past three

205
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:21,410
months, the primary pain, the pain

206
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:23,040
frequency, top emotional triggers,

207
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,379
wallet rate anxiety, solution

208
00:04:24,379 --> 00:04:25,639
must-haves, all these sort of

209
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:26,160
things.

210
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:27,860
It sends that information to our

211
00:04:28,029 --> 00:04:28,959
analysis agent.

212
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,329
And this creates a detailed

213
00:04:31,329 --> 00:04:33,310
analysis and executive summary of

214
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:35,139
the information we got from the

215
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:35,500
research.

216
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:36,620
So this kind of formulates things

217
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:37,709
in a more kind of understandable

218
00:04:37,709 --> 00:04:38,259
sort of way.

219
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,209
And then we send that to our ad

220
00:04:40,209 --> 00:04:41,660
scripting agent.

221
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:43,629
And this will create a three ads

222
00:04:43,629 --> 00:04:46,139
for us using different frameworks.

223
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:47,600
So you'll see the framework listed

224
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,100
up here.

225
00:04:48,139 --> 00:04:49,170
So we've got the villain hero

226
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:50,439
framework, followed by the past

227
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:51,980
framework, followed by the BAB

228
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:53,259
framework just there.

229
00:04:53,899 --> 00:04:55,560
So when it creates that, we

230
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:57,779
finally want to send that to our

231
00:04:57,779 --> 00:04:59,470
Google Docs creator.

232
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,949
As usual, MD2 Docs uses Google

233
00:05:01,019 --> 00:05:02,670
Docs OAuth 2, which we've talked

234
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:03,560
about before.

235
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,110
I should have set that up in

236
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:06,360
previous videos.

237
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:09,439
And it will create our ad scripts.

238
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,680
So if I open these now, let's see

239
00:05:10,689 --> 00:05:11,740
what these look like.

240
00:05:11,779 --> 00:05:12,899
These are actually ready to go.

241
00:05:12,939 --> 00:05:14,269
So again, it's for an app that's

242
00:05:14,269 --> 00:05:15,600
an alternative to Claude.

243
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:17,290
This is part of the description of

244
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:18,259
the chat model.

245
00:05:18,459 --> 00:05:19,629
It's for people who find Claude

246
00:05:19,629 --> 00:05:20,399
Max expensive.

247
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:23,079
And then it gives our ad scripts.

248
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,199
So the first one is the villain

249
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:24,980
hero framework.

250
00:05:25,019 --> 00:05:26,529
The hook is AI models that charge

251
00:05:26,529 --> 00:05:28,160
with token are silently draining

252
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,040
your wallet.

253
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:30,509
Big AI companies got greedy.

254
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:31,600
They've designed pricing models

255
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:32,480
that punish developers who

256
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,560
actually use their products.

257
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,899
Every prompt, every iteration,

258
00:05:34,899 --> 00:05:36,290
every debugging session comes with

259
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:37,639
a hidden tax that adds up fast.

260
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,649
Have you noticed how quickly those

261
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:39,339
credits disappear?

262
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:40,199
That's not an accident.

263
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,290
It's a trap designed to hook you

264
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:42,470
with free tiers for forcing you to

265
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,720
expensive enterprise plans.

266
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:44,829
Meanwhile, your development slows

267
00:05:44,829 --> 00:05:45,769
down because you're constantly

268
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:46,529
worried about costs.

269
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,720
This is where Open Dev AI changes

270
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,259
everything.

271
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:49,540
We've built a developer-first,

272
00:05:49,579 --> 00:05:50,560
open-source AI solution that

273
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,139
eliminates usage caps completely.

274
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,290
To play locally or use our cloud,

275
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:54,139
the choice is yours.

276
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:55,269
While they charge you for every

277
00:05:55,269 --> 00:05:56,189
token, we offer unlimited

278
00:05:56,259 --> 00:05:57,379
interactions at a fraction of the

279
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:57,839
cost.

280
00:05:57,879 --> 00:05:59,040
Our models deliver cloud-quality

281
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,079
outputs without cloud-level

282
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:00,560
pricing.

283
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,500
Join thousands of developers

284
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:02,579
who've taken back control of their

285
00:06:02,579 --> 00:06:03,759
AI workflows and their budgets.

286
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,889
Hit the link below to start your

287
00:06:04,889 --> 00:06:06,139
unlimited 14-day trial.

288
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,009
Your wallet will thank you.

289
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:08,279
We have some visual cues in here

290
00:06:08,329 --> 00:06:09,579
as well that you can add in.

291
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:12,680
So that is how that works.

292
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,899
And then finally, we go through

293
00:06:13,899 --> 00:06:14,730
the usual process.

294
00:06:14,779 --> 00:06:16,209
Are they an existing client?

295
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,540
If you selected yes, then it will

296
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,819
search the files and folders for

297
00:06:18,819 --> 00:06:19,980
that client name and move the

298
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:20,600
Google Doc there.

299
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,170
If not, it'll create that folder

300
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:23,629
for the client and move the file

301
00:06:23,629 --> 00:06:24,879
there before waiting.

302
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,709
And then finally, sending you a

303
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,600
message in Slack telling you that

304
00:06:28,699 --> 00:06:30,259
it's ready to view with a link to

305
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:31,579
the ad scripts.

306
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,819
So that's how that one works.

307
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,379
The most complicated part of this

308
00:06:35,379 --> 00:06:36,889
is going to be getting the Reddit

309
00:06:36,889 --> 00:06:37,680
thing set up.

310
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,449
That shouldn't be super hard

311
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:38,920
again.

312
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:40,069
As I said, create a Reddit

313
00:06:40,069 --> 00:06:41,720
account, preferences, apps, create

314
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:43,379
a new app, give it the name, give

315
00:06:43,379 --> 00:06:44,709
it the OAuth redirect URL, get the

316
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:46,660
client ID and client secret, paste

317
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:47,740
it in, good to go.

318
00:06:48,339 --> 00:06:50,339
The other things here as well, as

319
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:52,540
usual, open writer for all of our

320
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:54,370
AI models, then SERP API for

321
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:56,589
searching the web for the analysis

322
00:06:56,589 --> 00:06:57,439
content.

323
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:00,629
And that's pretty much exactly how

324
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:01,740
it works.

325
00:07:01,779 --> 00:07:02,709
I think this is going to be a

326
00:07:02,709 --> 00:07:03,730
super useful one for anyone

327
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:04,740
running the funnels and ads

328
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:05,220
agency.

329
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:07,199
You can just automatically create

330
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,180
highly detailed research ads from

331
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:10,250
just a few inputs.

332
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:12,160
So hopefully this is helpful, and

333
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,410
I will see you guys in the next

334
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:13,610
one.

335
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,199
Peace.
