00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:01,620
- What's up guys, Lucas here.

2
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:03,129
So in this video, I'm going over

3
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:04,240
the landing page

4
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,200
CRO analyzer workflow.

5
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,519
And what this does is allows you

6
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:08,759
to submit some details

7
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,699
about your client along with a

8
00:00:10,699 --> 00:00:11,800
link to the landing page

9
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:13,599
that you want to analyze.

10
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:16,039
And then we actually download the

11
00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:16,679
webpage,

12
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:18,190
send it to our AI agent and create

13
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:19,800
a full detailed document

14
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:21,690
with a full analysis, breakdown of

15
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:22,359
what to change

16
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:24,760
and what to test, suggestions for

17
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,000
what to improve upon,

18
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:27,469
and even some tracking details

19
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:29,440
for your Google analytics

20
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:30,199
dashboard.

21
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:32,140
Before finally moving that to as

22
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:33,560
usual, our client folder

23
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,539
and then notifying you in Slack.

24
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:36,780
So starting off with what you need

25
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:37,560
to have set up for this,

26
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,750
as usual, you need your Google

27
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,439
docs OAuth to set up

28
00:00:41,479 --> 00:00:43,399
for the MD2 docs to convert the

29
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:44,380
markdown properly

30
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:45,829
to a Google doc format.

31
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:48,539
We will need a Google drive set up

32
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:49,140
up here

33
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,899
and we will need Slack set up as

34
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:52,579
always.

35
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:54,500
Aside from that, just open router,

36
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:55,340
which you should have set up

37
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:56,710
for all of your other AI agent

38
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:57,039
tools.

39
00:00:57,079 --> 00:00:58,770
And if you want to use perplexity

40
00:00:58,859 --> 00:00:59,939
model for research,

41
00:00:59,979 --> 00:01:01,530
which I suggest you do, set up

42
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:03,479
your perplexity account.

43
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,900
So let's have a look at what this

44
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:05,340
does.

45
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:07,349
So the form we just have client

46
00:01:07,349 --> 00:01:08,859
name, existing client,

47
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,310
landing page URL, funnel type,

48
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:11,260
industry niche,

49
00:01:11,299 --> 00:01:12,680
and the current funnel metrics.

50
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:13,750
So if you're testing an existing

51
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:14,060
funnel,

52
00:01:14,099 --> 00:01:15,090
you can just put it in the current

53
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:15,840
metrics that you know there.

54
00:01:15,879 --> 00:01:17,989
If not, just type unknown or leave

55
00:01:17,989 --> 00:01:18,640
a blank.

56
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,769
Obviously, put your landing page

57
00:01:19,769 --> 00:01:20,040
URL.

58
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:21,329
The funnel type, it's a BSL

59
00:01:21,329 --> 00:01:21,909
funnel.

60
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:22,980
Niche is online business.

61
00:01:23,019 --> 00:01:24,099
And we're using alexromozzi and

62
00:01:24,099 --> 00:01:25,439
acquisition.com as an example

63
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:25,879
here.

64
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,239
I'm sure that our funnel is top

65
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:27,879
tier already,

66
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,329
but you know, it's a good example.

67
00:01:29,459 --> 00:01:32,560
So what this does is it actually

68
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,819
downloads the full webpage of the

69
00:01:34,819 --> 00:01:35,079
URL.

70
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:35,579
You input.

71
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:36,719
So it downloads the full website

72
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:37,769
in HTML.

73
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,959
We convert the HTML to markdown to

74
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:42,390
get easier for our AI agent to

75
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:42,859
analyze.

76
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,340
And then the AI agent analyzes

77
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:44,959
this.

78
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,280
Now, it's a very detailed system

79
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,150
problem we have here.

80
00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:48,030
First of all, up here, we've got

81
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:49,480
the client name, the sales funnel,

82
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:50,609
system type, industry niche, all

83
00:01:50,609 --> 00:01:51,950
the information we just got from

84
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:52,640
our form.

85
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,840
They have an extremely detailed

86
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:57,120
system message here, as you can

87
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:57,599
see.

88
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,650
And as I mentioned, we do have

89
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:01,439
perplexity set up and we're

90
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:02,540
actually letting the model

91
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:04,049
itself to find the messages on the

92
00:02:04,299 --> 00:02:06,040
output that we're using for this.

93
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:07,629
So to do that, you'll see a

94
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:08,990
little, this, this little icon

95
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:10,038
here is like three stars.

96
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:10,939
You'll see that over here.

97
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:12,129
That's what we click for that.

98
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,729
And so this is allows our agent to

99
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,639
actually set, come up with the

100
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:16,599
message that it sends to

101
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:17,379
perplexity.

102
00:02:17,419 --> 00:02:18,729
Again, you want to connect your

103
00:02:18,729 --> 00:02:20,409
perplexity account, just get your

104
00:02:20,409 --> 00:02:23,090
API key and put that in there.

105
00:02:23,219 --> 00:02:25,520
And then we're using sonar deep

106
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,620
research to do the research.

107
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:30,099
After that, we get our output and

108
00:02:30,099 --> 00:02:31,520
we convert it to markdowns using a

109
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,879
basic markdown converter agent.

110
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:34,889
And then we send it to md2docs to

111
00:02:34,889 --> 00:02:37,020
create our document before finally

112
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,879
checking is an existing client.

113
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:40,180
If they are, we'll move the

114
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:41,719
document to the existing client

115
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:42,280
folder.

116
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:43,560
And if they're not, we'll create a

117
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,569
new folder and move the doc in

118
00:02:44,569 --> 00:02:45,960
there before notifying you in

119
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,719
Slack.

120
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:48,189
So if we take a look at what the

121
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:50,180
document actually looks like,

122
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:51,520
here's the full breakdown.

123
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,520
We get an executive summary,

124
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,620
critical insight, market context,

125
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:55,949
top five highest impact

126
00:02:55,949 --> 00:02:57,240
improvements, rewrite the

127
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:00,020
headline, optimize the primary CTA

128
00:03:00,069 --> 00:03:00,439
button,

129
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,449
inject scarcity timer and badge,

130
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:03,919
restructure social proof

131
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:06,240
placement, and consent and privacy

132
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:07,620
text in form.

133
00:03:07,659 --> 00:03:09,569
Then implementation roadmap, the

134
00:03:09,569 --> 00:03:11,120
risk factors we can see with this,

135
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,849
post implementation monitoring,

136
00:03:12,849 --> 00:03:14,439
and the final notes to look out

137
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:15,020
for.

138
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,759
So that's essentially what we're

139
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:17,819
looking at this.

140
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:19,580
It's a very, very quick and easy

141
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:20,960
way for you to get some

142
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,449
suggestions on improving your

143
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,460
existing funnels you've already

144
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:23,819
created.

145
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,900
And as you can see, it's pretty

146
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:26,789
powerful.

147
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,270
It goes pretty in detail, provides

148
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,860
rewrites and copy suggestions and

149
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:30,819
things like that.

150
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:32,289
And overall is going to be super

151
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:33,990
useful for any of you guys that

152
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,330
are creating funnels regularly for

153
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:35,819
clients.

154
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:36,939
I want to test them and see any

155
00:03:36,939 --> 00:03:38,009
suggestions or areas you can

156
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:38,789
improve upon.

157
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,669
So hope this one helps you and I

158
00:03:40,669 --> 00:03:42,620
will see you in the next one.

159
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:42,620
Peace.

160
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:42,960
Peace.
