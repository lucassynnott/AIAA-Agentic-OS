1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,040
What's up guys, Lucas here.

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:03,520
So today I'm going to be walking

3
00:00:03,589 --> 00:00:05,879
you through the funnel copywriter

4
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:06,519
automation.

5
00:00:06,559 --> 00:00:09,460
What this does very simply is from

6
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:11,640
a form input, it processes the

7
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:12,080
data,

8
00:00:12,119 --> 00:00:14,070
does some market research using

9
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:17,000
ChatGPT5, as well as the SERP API,

10
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:18,670
which allows for internet search.

11
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:20,350
The funnel strategist agent

12
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:22,239
creates a whole funnel strategy

13
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:24,559
around the market

14
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,329
research on the inputted user

15
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:27,399
information.

16
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,649
Then it writes a sales page and

17
00:00:29,739 --> 00:00:31,640
writes all the email flows.

18
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,000
Then it creates a Google doc.

19
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:34,880
If they are an existing customer,

20
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,560
it puts the file in the correct

21
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,479
Google drive folder.

22
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,710
And if they are not, then it

23
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:42,890
creates the folder and moves the

24
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:43,640
file into it.

25
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:45,000
And then finally sends us a Slack

26
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:45,560
message.

27
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,979
So it's running through just very

28
00:00:46,979 --> 00:00:48,159
quickly how this works.

29
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,520
If we look here, I've got some

30
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,149
data pinned.

31
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,270
So I made up a fake company, a

32
00:00:52,299 --> 00:00:54,320
SaaS called Productivity Flow Pro.

33
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:56,280
It's for busy entrepreneurs while

34
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,479
business owners.

35
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,829
The primary full type is the

36
00:00:58,869 --> 00:01:00,079
landing page to a free trial.

37
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:02,070
The goal is to increase signups.

38
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:03,590
Basically, we have all here the

39
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:05,219
top three product benefits, top

40
00:01:05,219 --> 00:01:06,140
three pain points we saw,

41
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:07,870
unique value propositions, special

42
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:09,519
offers, existing copy sample,

43
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:10,879
success metrics to track,

44
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:11,939
and if they're a returning client.

45
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:13,290
So this is just the information

46
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:14,519
you need to give it in order to

47
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:15,799
write about your client.

48
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,629
So you will need to do a little

49
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:17,640
bit of information yourself.

50
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,629
So like look at the benefits of

51
00:01:19,629 --> 00:01:21,640
the client's product or their

52
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,719
brand voice, things like that.

53
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,090
But you should know most of this

54
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:26,500
if you've already spoken to your

55
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:28,049
client and get that information

56
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:28,719
from them.

57
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,319
So then our market research agent,

58
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:33,319
I've got some very detailed

59
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:35,879
prompts here, but essentially it

60
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:37,159
creates an executive summary.

61
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:37,989
It is a snapshot.

62
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,379
It creates audience personas.

63
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:40,519
It does all these things.

64
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,510
Again, using ChatGPT 5 along with

65
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,719
the SERP API.

66
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,189
Now, you will have to set up your

67
00:01:45,269 --> 00:01:46,349
open editor account, as we've

68
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:47,739
discussed in previous videos.

69
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:48,549
Open editor is the key

70
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:49,730
authentication that you'll need

71
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:50,390
for all AI.

72
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:52,390
SERP API is one you won't probably

73
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:53,670
want to set up.

74
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:54,400
It's very simple.

75
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:56,640
To set it up, you simply have to

76
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:57,849
get an API key.

77
00:01:57,959 --> 00:01:59,900
To do that, you just go to

78
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:03,060
SERPAPI.com, sign in or register,

79
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,400
and it will give you an API key

80
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:05,780
immediately that you copy and

81
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:06,189
paste in.

82
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:08,288
And now your AI has internet

83
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:09,280
access.

84
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:11,280
So let's go back here.

85
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,939
The sales page agent, after the

86
00:02:13,939 --> 00:02:15,530
funnel strategy agent, creates a

87
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:17,180
full detailed funnel strategy,

88
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,750
including the foundation, the

89
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:19,990
architecture, the confirmation

90
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:21,090
page strategy, email sequence

91
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:21,939
architecture, all this

92
00:02:21,939 --> 00:02:22,560
information.

93
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:24,460
Once that's all created, it sends

94
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:26,159
that here along with the market

95
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:28,159
research to the sales page agent,

96
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:30,210
which then writes a fully detailed

97
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:32,250
sales page based on best practices

98
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,159
from a number of experts on sales

99
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:35,360
page creation.

100
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:37,729
Then the email flow agent creates

101
00:02:37,819 --> 00:02:39,750
detailed email flows again, taking

102
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:41,330
all the information from the

103
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:43,139
previous agents and outlines the

104
00:02:43,139 --> 00:02:44,750
whole email strategy as well as

105
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,419
actually writes the emails you

106
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:47,500
need to write.

107
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:49,819
Then it compiles all this into a

108
00:02:49,819 --> 00:02:51,349
success package very simply just

109
00:02:51,349 --> 00:02:52,719
puts it all together here.

110
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:54,389
And then we create a Google doc

111
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,280
here from the markdown to create a

112
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,229
nicely formatted Google doc.

113
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:00,159
When that's done, then it will

114
00:03:00,229 --> 00:03:01,800
check if it's a returning client

115
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,509
or not, which you will have marked

116
00:03:03,509 --> 00:03:04,740
in the initial form.

117
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:06,090
If it is, it will search for that

118
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:07,389
client's name in your client's

119
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:08,780
folder in Google Drive, which as

120
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:10,300
mentioned before, you need to have

121
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,599
a client's folder set up.

122
00:03:12,139 --> 00:03:13,229
And then it will move the file

123
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:14,419
into the correct folder.

124
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:15,629
If you don't have a folder for

125
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:16,889
that client, if they're not a

126
00:03:16,909 --> 00:03:18,449
returning client, it will create a

127
00:03:18,449 --> 00:03:19,879
folder with the client's name

128
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,370
based on what you put in the form

129
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,800
and then move the completed Google

130
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,860
doc into the folder for finally

131
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:27,060
sending you a message in Slack.

132
00:03:27,099 --> 00:03:28,530
And your output will look

133
00:03:28,539 --> 00:03:30,439
something like this, where you

134
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:32,490
will have the full funnel strategy

135
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:33,180
up top.

136
00:03:33,259 --> 00:03:34,030
As you can see, this is super

137
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:34,419
detailed.

138
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,310
This is nearly 20,000 words in

139
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,800
total for this whole document.

140
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,250
It'll go over all the information

141
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:40,939
here.

142
00:03:40,979 --> 00:03:42,400
I've actually scrolled in here.

143
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:44,129
We'll get to the sales page copy

144
00:03:44,219 --> 00:03:45,969
where you'll see here is a full

145
00:03:45,969 --> 00:03:47,740
sales page written for you.

146
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:51,050
Again, based on the best practices

147
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:54,199
from existing funnel experts.

148
00:03:54,259 --> 00:03:55,699
What Holly's just giving as much

149
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:57,349
information as possible about the

150
00:03:57,349 --> 00:03:58,870
product or the client in order to

151
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:00,099
get the most accurate text

152
00:04:00,099 --> 00:04:00,699
possible.

153
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,240
You will still obviously have to

154
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:03,620
edit things slightly depending on

155
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:04,800
what your client's doing.

156
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:07,409
But this is a really, really good

157
00:04:07,409 --> 00:04:09,150
base to start from.

158
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:11,150
And then finally, it will create

159
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:13,199
our email flows where it goes over

160
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,039
the details of the strategy,

161
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:16,579
themes, et cetera.

162
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,569
And then the actual emails are

163
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:19,740
here below.

164
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:20,839
You have to do a bit of formatting

165
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:22,050
or just, you know, line breaks and

166
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,139
stuff, but everything there is

167
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,069
pretty much ready to go.

168
00:04:24,279 --> 00:04:26,110
And then finally, as I said, you

169
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:27,639
will get the message of Slack

170
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:29,680
telling you that it is done, ready

171
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:30,980
to go, ready for you to build it.

172
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:32,720
So this turns, you know, what

173
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,439
would be hours maybe of research

174
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:36,189
and learning how to write sales

175
00:04:36,189 --> 00:04:37,879
pages and stuff into probably a

176
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,709
total five-minute process maybe

177
00:04:39,709 --> 00:04:41,079
for this flow to run.

178
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,060
You simply just input the details

179
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:44,829
into the form, and then you are

180
00:04:44,889 --> 00:04:45,759
good to go.

181
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,110
You will get a Slack message with

182
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:48,610
the Google Drive link saying, here

183
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:49,079
you go.

184
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,290
Here's all the information on this

185
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:51,069
client ready to go.

186
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,759
So, yeah, this will save you

187
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:53,959
having to hire a copywriter.

188
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,870
It will save you having to learn

189
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:55,819
how to write copy yourself.

190
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,810
It will save you the majority of

191
00:04:57,810 --> 00:04:59,860
what's involved in the research

192
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:01,899
and copywriting part of funnel

193
00:05:01,899 --> 00:05:03,060
development.

194
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,509
Any problems with this, feel free

195
00:05:04,509 --> 00:05:05,050
to hit me up.

196
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,139
Again, the only things you need to

197
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:07,000
set up, you will need to set up

198
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,160
your Google Drive authentication.

199
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,170
Again, to do that, you'll just add

200
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:11,439
a Google Drive account.

201
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,360
It's just log in with Google.

202
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:14,379
Same for Slack.

203
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:15,360
You'll have to set up your Slack

204
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:15,939
authentication.

205
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:16,959
It's just log in with Slack.

206
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,819
And you will have to set up your

207
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:20,290
OpenWriter and SERP API

208
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:21,699
authentication.

209
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:23,540
All done very easily.

210
00:05:23,579 --> 00:05:25,439
Again, credential to connect with.

211
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,839
You'll just search for SERP and

212
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:28,189
then, or SERP will already be

213
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:28,660
here.

214
00:05:28,699 --> 00:05:30,019
Just create a new credential and

215
00:05:30,019 --> 00:05:31,310
put in your API key, and you're

216
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:31,959
good to go.

217
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,800
So, any issues, feel free to hit

218
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,319
me up.

219
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,339
And let me know how it goes.

220
00:05:36,379 --> 00:05:37,170
See you in the next one.

221
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:37,759
Peace.
