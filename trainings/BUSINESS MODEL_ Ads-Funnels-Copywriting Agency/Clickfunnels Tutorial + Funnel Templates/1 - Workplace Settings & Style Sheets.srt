1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:05,200
All right all right what's up guys

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,280
so first off this is going to be

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,880
probably the most in-depth

4
00:00:08,929 --> 00:00:11,470
click funnels tutorial that many

5
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:13,970
of you guys have really ever gone

6
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:16,440
through so at the same time we're

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,179
gonna be talking about you know a

8
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:19,789
lot of best practices as well for

9
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:21,559
building funnels in general

10
00:00:21,609 --> 00:00:23,129
landing pages and stuff like that

11
00:00:23,129 --> 00:00:24,469
plus you guys of course are going

12
00:00:24,679 --> 00:00:25,940
to get some of our templates

13
00:00:25,989 --> 00:00:27,760
that you can plug and play into

14
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,949
click funnels 2.0 and just go

15
00:00:29,949 --> 00:00:32,618
ahead and utilize so if you don't

16
00:00:32,618 --> 00:00:32,780
know

17
00:00:32,829 --> 00:00:35,689
click funnels has essentially 1.0

18
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,729
as it stands right now it is

19
00:00:37,729 --> 00:00:41,020
august 28th 2025 and we have click

20
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:43,460
funnels 1.0 and we also have click

21
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,770
funnels 2.0 this is 2.0 so

22
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:48,159
personally i like building on 2.0

23
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:48,439
you

24
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:50,299
can still build on 1.0 a lot of

25
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,049
the stuff looks kind of similar on

26
00:00:52,049 --> 00:00:53,659
the back end but there are some

27
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:54,880
some key major differences

28
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,310
especially on this dashboard here

29
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:57,090
and everything but

30
00:00:57,189 --> 00:00:58,670
honestly they're starting to

31
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:00,710
support 2.0 obviously a lot more

32
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:02,359
that's what they're trying to push

33
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:02,619
they

34
00:01:02,659 --> 00:01:04,480
say they're still they say that

35
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,019
they're still maintaining 1.0 but

36
00:01:07,019 --> 00:01:08,359
at the end of the day it's

37
00:01:08,599 --> 00:01:10,659
a legacy product so a lot of the

38
00:01:10,659 --> 00:01:12,939
new features are getting rolled

39
00:01:13,189 --> 00:01:15,879
out on 2.0 and overall the coding

40
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:18,140
language react that click funnels

41
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:20,530
2.0 uses is just very very user

42
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,260
responsive very clean looks great

43
00:01:23,299 --> 00:01:25,219
and overall this is our choice for

44
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,379
funnel building um at our agency

45
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,640
so without further ado we're just

46
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:31,069
going to go over in this first

47
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:32,569
video just this overall like setup

48
00:01:32,769 --> 00:01:34,459
here what it what what happens

49
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,459
when you first land um on this in

50
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,540
click funnel so first off this is

um mainly what you're going to be

82
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:29,599
doing is either hitting create a

funnel if you want to create

84
00:02:31,419 --> 00:02:31,620
something

85
00:02:31,659 --> 00:02:33,319
from total scratch or you're going

86
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:35,110
to take one of the share links

87
00:02:35,129 --> 00:02:36,840
from one of our funnels that we

88
00:02:36,979 --> 00:02:37,159
have

89
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:38,689
whether you're doing a call funnel

90
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,060
webinar low ticket challenge

91
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,460
whatever it is you're going to

92
00:02:41,509 --> 00:02:43,250
take that template paste it up

93
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:45,039
here in the search bar hit enter

94
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:47,169
and it's going to populate that

95
00:02:47,409 --> 00:02:48,830
template right inside of your

96
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:50,199
account and then you will go

97
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:51,729
inside of funnels here which is

98
00:02:51,729 --> 00:02:52,219
our next

99
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:54,490
section and you'll be able to see

100
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:56,860
that funnel right there so this is

101
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,639
all of our funnels we do have

102
00:02:58,819 --> 00:03:00,189
some that we keep for our clients

103
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:01,610
in our account we have other ones

104
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:02,590
that we share to them

105
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:04,560
and basically run them from their

106
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,590
account but essentially here this

107
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:08,000
is where you see all of

108
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:09,680
your funnels you can see archived

109
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,300
ones you can see imported ones so

110
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,800
again the imported ones are the

111
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,409
ones that you essentially imported

112
00:03:14,409 --> 00:03:15,969
from another account which will be

113
00:03:15,969 --> 00:03:17,780
the ones that you uh you see that

114
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:17,979
we

115
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:20,400
share to you and right here let's

116
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,849
just go into one of our funnels so

117
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,219
if you look at the actual line

118
00:03:25,259 --> 00:03:26,229
here you'll be able to see the

119
00:03:26,229 --> 00:03:27,250
amount of steps the amount of

120
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,150
pages in the funnel unique

121
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:30,659
visitors page views

122
00:03:30,699 --> 00:03:32,770
opt-ins sales orders and then

123
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:35,060
you'll be able to see analytics

124
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,659
open it in a new window so you can

125
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:39,300
actually just open the page itself

126
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:41,150
then you'll also be able to

127
00:03:41,169 --> 00:03:43,319
duplicate that funnel so say

128
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:43,840
you're an

129
00:03:43,889 --> 00:03:45,669
agency and you just run the same

130
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,590
sort of VSL call funnel structure

131
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:49,539
over and over and over again you

132
00:03:49,539 --> 00:03:49,580
just

133
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:51,340
go here and hit duplicate funnel

134
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,020
and that'll duplicate it and then

135
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:55,419
you can also click here and edit

136
00:03:55,449 --> 00:03:55,879
the master

137
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:57,460
settings for this funnel now this

138
00:03:57,479 --> 00:03:58,780
is very key i did show this in

139
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,020
another video but um you want to

140
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:01,099
of

141
00:04:01,229 --> 00:04:02,520
course make sure that your domain

142
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,689
is connected and we'll go over

143
00:04:03,699 --> 00:04:05,199
that in a second i'm going to open

144
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,819
this tab but you want to make sure

145
00:04:06,819 --> 00:04:08,409
the respective domain is connected

146
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:10,180
to that actual funnel itself

147
00:04:10,219 --> 00:04:12,000
into your click funnel account

148
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:13,530
overall i like to switch the

149
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:15,680
favicon image favicon i don't know

150
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:15,819
how to

151
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:17,310
pronounce it but favicon image

152
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:18,730
here and i'm just going to slap

153
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:20,209
that logo there so in the corner

154
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:20,579
it'll

155
00:04:20,629 --> 00:04:22,019
actually look like this and not

156
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:23,420
the click funnels logo that's

157
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:24,759
where you solve that there

158
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,480
you could also set up style sheets

159
00:04:26,779 --> 00:04:28,110
which we'll go over later that's

160
00:04:28,129 --> 00:04:29,939
going to be universal style sheets

161
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:31,639
for a certain client and then

162
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:33,519
whenever you want to go and paste

163
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:35,649
your meta pixel code this is where

164
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:37,670
you're going to paste it in the

165
00:04:37,939 --> 00:04:39,560
head code the main pixel code you

166
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,060
grab when you create your pixel on

167
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:42,319
meta

168
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:44,259
will go in here it's not going to

169
00:04:44,339 --> 00:04:46,199
go in the header section of each

170
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:48,939
and every page it will go in here

171
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:50,470
okay and you have your footer code

172
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:51,850
there if you do want to put stuff

173
00:04:51,889 --> 00:04:53,720
there i always toggle this off i

174
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:53,810
don't

175
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:55,160
want to have the click funnels

176
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,480
badge showing up on things and

177
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:57,920
then if you want to share your

178
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,139
funnel

179
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,540

180
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,949

00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,800
want and then hit generate a share

184
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,220
or generate a funnel share link

185
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:09,420

00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,060
link that it gives you after that

188
00:05:12,069 --> 00:05:13,399

any changes and click update

191
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,819
funnel and you'll be good to go so

192
00:05:16,819 --> 00:05:18,550
that is the funnel settings now

193
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:24,089
let's go over to domains so

194
00:05:24,089 --> 00:05:26,310
domains is very easy right i have

195
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:28,699
done their whole free domain thing

196
00:05:28,699 --> 00:05:28,779
so

197
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,490
their whole get a free domain

198
00:05:30,949 --> 00:05:32,290
through ionos.com i think it is

199
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,170
whatever registrar that they use

200
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:34,180
for

201
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:36,569
domains i've noticed that it's

202
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:38,649
very annoying to log in again

203
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
after that so personally i just

204
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,740
use godaddy

205
00:05:41,779 --> 00:05:43,420
that's it it's very easy just grab

206
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:44,990
your domain on godaddy or if you

207
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:46,310
have a different registrar where

208
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:48,180
your domain is at or a different

209
00:05:48,339 --> 00:05:50,240
provider you know totally cool um

210
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,019
i just like to do add existing

211
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,800
domain after i've purchased that

212
00:05:54,139 --> 00:05:55,050
domain enter it here and then

213
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,879
follow their setup wizard it's

214
00:05:56,879 --> 00:05:57,660
very very

215
00:05:57,699 --> 00:05:59,199
very easy very straightforward

216
00:05:59,209 --> 00:06:00,569
they tell you what to copy and

217
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:01,800
paste what to do for the dns

218
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:02,480
records and

219
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:03,889
everything like that um if you

220
00:06:03,899 --> 00:06:05,389
can't figure it out it's they have

221
00:06:05,529 --> 00:06:07,100
a ton of different things on their

222
00:06:07,149 --> 00:06:09,360
their site too for you know just

223
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,319
type in like click funnels 2.0

224
00:06:12,459 --> 00:06:15,959
godaddy domain setup right

225
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,649
and it's going to tell you right

226
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:19,310
there so very easy straight and

227
00:06:19,329 --> 00:06:21,519
straightforward on that front so

228
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,220
now going back into just the

229
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:26,730
overall general builder and

230
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:28,839
everything here if you want to

231
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:30,139
essentially create a funnel from

232
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:31,209
scratch you can go to create

233
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:31,540
funnel

234
00:06:31,579 --> 00:06:33,540
and you can do a squeeze funnel

235
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,860
which is essentially like a normal

236
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:37,779
lead funnel a summit funnel

237
00:06:37,819 --> 00:06:39,470
book funnel cart funnel challenge

238
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,709

application funnel and all these

241
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,589
other funnels right so if you want

242
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:46,920
to pick a template of theirs

243
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:48,240
you can do so or you can just

244
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,819
start from complete scratch up

245
00:06:49,819 --> 00:06:52,120
here if you do want to say you

246
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:52,139
want

247
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,879
to take one of their vsl funnels

248
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:55,569
here they got a nice little video

249
00:06:55,569 --> 00:06:57,040
here with uh good old russell

250
00:06:57,089 --> 00:06:58,829
telling you what it is telling you

251
00:06:59,029 --> 00:07:00,389
the actual whole steps of it and

252
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:02,000
everything and then you could

253
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:04,240
preview a few of the templates and

254
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,319
then click here to select it and

255
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,399
import it but again we give you

256
00:07:08,449 --> 00:07:10,449
proven templates for a reason but

257
00:07:10,449 --> 00:07:12,329
if you're like hey i just want to

258
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,100
experiment on my own and try

259
00:07:14,139 --> 00:07:16,040
something you know else or new

260
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,209
whatever you can go here and click

261
00:07:18,209 --> 00:07:20,459
that just know that uh if you're

262
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,670
selling to a lot of internet

263
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:22,839
marketers i've seen these

264
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,110
templates all the time i know

265
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,180
exactly what they look

266
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,550
like and i immediately i'm like

267
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:27,709
yep that's a click funnels

268
00:07:27,709 --> 00:07:29,579
template uh so it just doesn't

269
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:30,040
show any

270
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:31,829
originality and creativity so just

271
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:34,300
keep that in mind if you do that

272
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,459
i'm just setting a note too

273
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:38,180
their support is halfway decent

274
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,829
it's okay i click this chat bubble

275
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,420
in the bottom and you'll be able

276
00:07:41,459 --> 00:07:43,310
to get support from them but um

277
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:44,920
yep and then if we go over to

278
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:48,610
analytics you can see again if

279
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:48,930
you're doing

280
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:50,519
actual like sales through a funnel

281
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:51,769
you'll be able to see that here

282
00:07:51,769 --> 00:07:53,279
you can toggle by date up here

283
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:55,329
and you can see by each page step

284
00:07:55,329 --> 00:07:58,139
all these different metrics here

285
00:07:58,139 --> 00:07:59,699
like opt-ins if you have

286
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:01,980
opt-ins so opt-ins will show if

287
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:04,399
you're using a click funnels form

288
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:07,180
a click funnels embedded input

289
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:07,860
form so

290
00:08:07,899 --> 00:08:09,319
where you put name phone number

291
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:10,660
and email you pull it from the

292
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:12,279
actual click funnels widget bar

293
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:13,079
and toolbar

294
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:15,100
so using their in-app stuff not if

295
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,990
you're like embedding a hubspot

296
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:18,850
form or an active campaign form

297
00:08:19,019 --> 00:08:20,870
or whatever it is it will not show

298
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,709
up here so most of the time when

299
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,439
we're doing analysis for our

300
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:25,850
clients we're going to pull just

301
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,470
unique page views right here from

302
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:30,860
these sheets or from the from this

303
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:32,759
section here that's what we go off

304
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,629
of so that essentially is the

305
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:35,929
funnels tab very straightforward

306
00:08:36,019 --> 00:08:37,360
and easy if we go to products

307
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,889
you'll be able to see all products

308
00:08:39,048 --> 00:08:41,500
collections and inventory so this

309
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:41,639
is

310
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:43,279
where if you actually want to make

311
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:44,710
a product you can so you can go

312
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:46,320
there and create a product here

313
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:46,580
you can

314
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,049
also click here to set up payments

315
00:08:48,049 --> 00:08:49,490
and that's going to again have

316
00:08:49,649 --> 00:08:52,940
their gateway payments ai set up

317
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:53,240
it'll

318
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:54,110
pop up the whole wizard and

319
00:08:54,149 --> 00:08:55,330
everything and you'll connect that

320
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:56,990
to your stripe account for direct

321
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,440
payment processing so if you do

322
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,649
want to run like a low ticket

323
00:08:59,649 --> 00:09:01,100
product funnel or a challenge

324
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:01,519
funnel you

325
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:03,200
want to sell directly through this

326
00:09:03,539 --> 00:09:04,639
totally good just click set up

327
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:06,389
payments and then when you go to

328
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,080
create product you can do physical

329
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,570
if it's like a book funnel book or

330
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:10,769
something like that or you're

331
00:09:10,809 --> 00:09:10,990
sending

332
00:09:11,049 --> 00:09:12,750
something physical have it you

333
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:14,269
know be there if it's a digital

334
00:09:14,389 --> 00:09:16,159
just do that we'll do like test

335
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:17,659
test

336
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:19,720
great product you can do if it's a

337
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,110
payment plan one-time subscription

338
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:24,320
one-time product sorry or a

339
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,139
subscription so let's just say

340
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:28,100
it's a one-time thing for you know

341
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,740
hundred bucks do you set price you

342
00:09:30,889 --> 00:09:30,919
can

343
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,159
add an image to it you can add

344
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,639
another price variant you can do

345
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:35,360
some tags for it if you'd like so

346
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:35,720
if I want

347
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:38,389
to do like I don't know you know

348
00:09:38,389 --> 00:09:41,419
low ticket funnel ads something I

349
00:09:41,419 --> 00:09:43,960
can make a tag there I can add it

350
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,039
to

351
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:46,299
collections and then you can add a

352
00:09:46,299 --> 00:09:48,700
skew if you want just keep track

353
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:50,879
of things that's if you have

354
00:09:50,929 --> 00:09:52,809
like a ton of products and then if

355
00:09:52,899 --> 00:09:54,230
you do want to host different

356
00:09:54,509 --> 00:09:56,539
courses and stuff like that on

357
00:09:56,539 --> 00:09:57,309
here

358
00:09:57,419 --> 00:09:59,350
in different digital assets you

359
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:01,240
can you just click that and then

360
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,080
add the asset I personally never

361
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:03,120
do

362
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,059
that so I usually just use kajabi

363
00:10:05,269 --> 00:10:06,889
for courses and stuff or whatever

364
00:10:06,929 --> 00:10:08,500
I noticed that click funnels

365
00:10:08,659 --> 00:10:10,740
essentially their whole course

366
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,830
section and all that and they're

367
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:15,049
you know they're basically their

368
00:10:15,169 --> 00:10:16,980
education portal is not too hot so

369
00:10:17,059 --> 00:10:18,799
I personally don't do that but if

370
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:20,240
you want to do that you can

371
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:22,399
click there on whatever hit create

372
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,330
course and begin doing that and

373
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:25,940
you can also edit the SEO

374
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,730
so if you want to like label it

375
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,200
differently if it is shared there

376
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,200
you go and always make sure as

377
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:33,440
well

378
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,590
to toggle it on online store and

379
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:37,990
customer center for some reason if

380
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,220
those aren't toggled on it won't

381
00:10:40,269 --> 00:10:42,590
show up properly inside of the

382
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:44,769
actual inside of the actual

383
00:10:44,899 --> 00:10:47,720
checkout page I don't know why but

384
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,159
anyways

385
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,940
then if you go to customers over

386
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:51,549
here you have a bunch of different

387
00:10:51,769 --> 00:10:53,360
things you can see all your

388
00:10:53,409 --> 00:10:55,519
individual contacts and you're

389
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,159
able to go here and just filter

390
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:00,860
out by all these different things

391
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:02,370
so you can filter out by different

392
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:03,669
contact attributes contact

393
00:11:03,669 --> 00:11:07,289
activity products broadcasts and

394
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:08,100
some

395
00:11:08,139 --> 00:11:09,889
custom stuff so I always like to

396
00:11:10,049 --> 00:11:11,889
do like opting in on funnel step

397
00:11:11,909 --> 00:11:13,779
and I'll pick you know a certain

398
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:15,799
funnel step for example you know

399
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:17,750
pick like that whatever funnel

400
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:21,279
step here apply more it'd probably

401
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:21,580
be like

402
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:24,000
like our our webinar one right you

403
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,000
can pick that and pretty much the

404
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,080
funnel step is the actual page

405
00:11:29,129 --> 00:11:30,659
itself so if you have like one

406
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,019
funnel with multiple different

407
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:34,289
opt-in pages and you want to see

408
00:11:34,299 --> 00:11:34,759
okay

409
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:36,519
who opted in through page one I

410
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,419
want to export that list you go to

411
00:11:38,419 --> 00:11:39,980
opt in on funnel step and just

412
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:40,460
pick that

413
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,409
up that page essentially but very

414
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,220
self-explanatory in this part too

415
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:46,700
nothing too crazy a bunch of

416
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:46,879
different

417
00:11:47,009 --> 00:11:48,929
options for you if you do want to

418
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:51,360
filter through through there and

419
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:52,889
then you'll be able to see all

420
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:55,120
your orders subscriptions all that

421
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,850
fun stuff on this side as well

422
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:58,639
this is their you know learn and

423
00:11:59,059 --> 00:11:59,059
connect

424
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,549
kind of section with different

425
00:12:00,549 --> 00:12:02,269
courses and training materials and

426
00:12:02,269 --> 00:12:04,269
their community all that fun stuff

427
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:04,460
you want

428
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,860
to dive through it I haven't been

429
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:07,100
through it I just get my hands

430
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,389
dirty in this and start building

431
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,190
stuff a couple other things too is

432
00:12:10,419 --> 00:12:12,000
they do a great referral program I

433
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,500
can lie so if you are an agency

434
00:12:13,539 --> 00:12:14,860
like myself like we don't make a

435
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,330
ton of money off this but whatever

436
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:18,299
it pays for half my car I have a

437
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,700
fun car so it's dope just like

438
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,210
send it to clients and stuff have

439
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,039
them sign up they're gonna sign up

440
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:25,279
anyways site and blog this here is

441
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,590
if you're having like a full-blown

442
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,440
website this is where you'll go

443
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:29,679
not

444
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,899
funnels so you know you do want to

445
00:12:31,899 --> 00:12:33,980
play with that go for it but just

446
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:35,299
like a different building area

447
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:37,269
analytics is where you'll be able

448
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,230
to see overall analytics and some

449
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:42,080
more deeper reporting stuff like

450
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,610
that so you can do all funnels you

451
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:45,009
get click different funnels and

452
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,179
all that fun stuff sort by date

453
00:12:47,179 --> 00:12:47,639
range

454
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:50,059
automations is we'll do a couple

455
00:12:50,139 --> 00:12:52,090
workflows now some of the

456
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,720
automations here are very bare

457
00:12:54,769 --> 00:12:55,580
bones so like

458
00:12:55,669 --> 00:12:57,620
most of the time we're just doing

459
00:12:57,639 --> 00:12:59,740
hey if we have this person that

460
00:12:59,769 --> 00:13:03,129
opts in on this page here so event

461
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:03,500
type

462
00:13:03,539 --> 00:13:06,409
opt-in on this funnel on this page

463
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:09,740
we toggle it on I want them to you

464
00:13:09,799 --> 00:13:12,080
know get a tag added or something

465
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,820
and other times especially if

466
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,429
we're using like hubspot or

467
00:13:15,429 --> 00:13:17,779
something we'll go over to here

468
00:13:17,809 --> 00:13:18,320
it's just a normal

469
00:13:18,409 --> 00:13:20,149
workflow builder it doesn't have a

470
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:21,710
lot of functionality most of the

471
00:13:21,799 --> 00:13:23,580
time like 99% of the time we have

472
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,100
to use a beer

473
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:25,649
for stuff but sometimes you'll be

474
00:13:25,649 --> 00:13:26,659
able to just go here click

475
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:29,120
third-party integration and they

476
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:29,600
do have

477
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:30,789
a lot of integrations here but

478
00:13:30,789 --> 00:13:32,019
I've noticed that there's not a

479
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:33,580
lot of capabilities like even if I

480
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:33,679
go

481
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,210
to hubspot there's not a lot of

482
00:13:35,299 --> 00:13:36,590
things that I can do essentially

483
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:39,379
probably not going to go and won't

484
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:41,000
won't do that one now but anyway

485
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,350
so there's like a couple things

486
00:13:42,549 --> 00:13:44,289
you can like add to list or add a

487
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:44,600
tag

488
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,110
in hubspot or create the contact

489
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:47,500
in hubspot there's not a lot of

490
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,240
functionality so I default to

491
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:50,769
if I need to create some sort of

492
00:13:51,259 --> 00:13:53,580
automation between you know click

493
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:55,559
funnels if I'm doing an opt-in on

494
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:57,899
click funnels to my CRM then what

495
00:13:57,899 --> 00:14:00,230
I'll just simply do is use Zapier

496
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,980
just to connect the two so it's a

497
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:03,070
lot

498
00:14:03,149 --> 00:14:05,470
easier from what I've noticed and

499
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:07,600
community no idea what that is

500
00:14:07,779 --> 00:14:10,600
honestly landing pages here I

501
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,039
honestly

502
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,610
have not ever dove into this here

503
00:14:12,629 --> 00:14:13,990
but it looks like it's just simply

504
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:16,779
the individual pages for each

505
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,580
one of our funnels something that

506
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:20,200
you can do that I'm actually just

507
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,720
realized now that I need to have

508
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:23,190
our team do is just go in here and

509
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:24,629
like relabel these individual

510
00:14:24,679 --> 00:14:26,399
landing pages because sometimes

511
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,929
when you're doing zaps like this

512
00:14:27,929 --> 00:14:29,340
is what's going to show up like if

513
00:14:29,539 --> 00:14:31,159
you have hey if they opted on this

514
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:32,919
landing page or this funnel step

515
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:34,730
you know send them basically like

516
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:36,860
pull that information off and fire

517
00:14:37,159 --> 00:14:37,159
them

518
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:38,940
through the into the CRM and it'll

519
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:40,509
show up like this when you go for

520
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:42,169
your selection you'll know

521
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:43,679
what I mean when when this when

522
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:45,110
you actually go to do this if you

523
00:14:45,299 --> 00:14:46,820
do so you know you can go in here

524
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,299
and just change up the actual name

525
00:14:48,299 --> 00:14:49,509
of the landing page which is

526
00:14:49,509 --> 00:14:51,100
pretty cool so that's an overview

527
00:14:51,139 --> 00:14:52,860
of everything and really just

528
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,590
other than that I mean you have

529
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,720
workspaces or sorry the workspace

530
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:56,820
settings

531
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,740
here so a bunch of other things

532
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,370
this is where you like add people

533
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:01,960
to it under collaborators

534
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,299
you can add different

535
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,309
administrators and users this is

536
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:08,690
where you connect your domains and

537
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:09,279
all that fun

538
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:11,350
stuff email settings email

539
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:13,690
templates if you do want to send

540
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:17,100
out emails with them I personally

541
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:17,860
don't like

542
00:15:17,899 --> 00:15:19,830
i said i use like hubspot ghl

543
00:15:19,879 --> 00:15:22,840
pretty much anything else so um i

544
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:25,769
don't really default to that and

545
00:15:25,779 --> 00:15:26,019
um

546
00:15:26,059 --> 00:15:27,450
yeah other than that we'll get

547
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:28,929
into more of this later but this

548
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:30,570
is where you can create

549
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:32,539
actual style sheets so if you have

550
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,759
a client for example like we have

551
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:37,379
this client here uh adfluent

552
00:15:39,259 --> 00:15:40,799
we can name the actual style sheet

553
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:46,409
there but what's really cool is if

554
00:15:46,429 --> 00:15:49,860
we go to customize design so this

555
00:15:49,899 --> 00:15:52,450
is where like say for example you

556
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:55,080
want to essentially keep a client

557
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:58,179
all their pages looking really

558
00:15:58,289 --> 00:15:58,570
like

559
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,320
well branded and almost exactly

560
00:16:00,509 --> 00:16:01,929
the the same in terms of like the

561
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:03,779
font that's used the color codes

562
00:16:03,779 --> 00:16:04,100
that's

563
00:16:04,139 --> 00:16:06,169
used and all that stuff you can

564
00:16:06,169 --> 00:16:08,379
make what's called a style sheet

565
00:16:08,379 --> 00:16:10,340
um right in here so this is where

566
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:10,500
you

567
00:16:10,539 --> 00:16:11,870
go and you say all right for this

568
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:13,250

570
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,889
the vsl page any additional pages

571
00:16:16,919 --> 00:16:18,710
that i do whatever this is what i

572
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,610
want the headline font to be this

573
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:20,820
is

574
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:22,710
what i want the sub headline to be

575
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,529
this is what i want the base font

576
00:16:24,529 --> 00:16:26,259
to be and stuff like that this is

577
00:16:26,299 --> 00:16:27,840
what i want the colors to be for

578
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,169
light background lightest

579
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:31,379
background colored background dark

580
00:16:31,379 --> 00:16:31,970
background darkest

581
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:33,820
background it's just setting

582
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,539
universal style sheets and then

583
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:37,399
you can go to shadows and set that

584
00:16:37,539 --> 00:16:37,620
there

585
00:16:37,659 --> 00:16:39,269
so sometimes we'll do this

586
00:16:39,639 --> 00:16:41,350
whenever we're like hey we want to

587
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,299
make this like super easy for a

588
00:16:43,299 --> 00:16:44,049
designer

589
00:16:44,139 --> 00:16:46,080
or one of our page developers to

590
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,980
essentially just make all the

591
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,809
pages look very congruent and

592
00:16:50,139 --> 00:16:50,340
styled

593
00:16:50,379 --> 00:16:51,809
the same we'll go through and make

594
00:16:51,809 --> 00:16:53,169
a style sheet like this and i'll

595
00:16:53,169 --> 00:16:54,659
show you guys where in the builder

596
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,169
that we actually use these style

597
00:16:56,169 --> 00:16:57,600
sheets to just automatically make

598
00:16:57,789 --> 00:16:59,529
all the headlines and you know

599
00:16:59,580 --> 00:16:59,879
fonts and

600
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:01,690
everything and all the colors look

601
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:02,929
exactly the same so that's

602
00:17:02,929 --> 00:17:04,740
essentially the quick overview of

603
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:04,980
the

604
00:17:05,029 --> 00:17:06,750
initial stuff here inside of good

605
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:08,338
old click funnels and let's dive

606
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:09,990
into an actual page and i'll show

607
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:10,180

608
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:12,160

609
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,838
that you need to know inside of

610
00:17:13,838 --> 00:17:15,619
the page builder to know how to

611
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:15,859
make

612
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,539
some high converting funnels and

613
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,578
