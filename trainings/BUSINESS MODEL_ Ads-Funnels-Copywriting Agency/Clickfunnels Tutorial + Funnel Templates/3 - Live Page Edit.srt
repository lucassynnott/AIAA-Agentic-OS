1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:03,490
All right guys so I have a page

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:06,030
open here this is video number

3
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:06,639
three and I'm

4
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:08,339
literally gonna go over every

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,369
single button inside of the editor

6
00:00:10,369 --> 00:00:10,949
for you guys

7
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:12,880
so first off again we have

8
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:15,619
sections the hierarchy of elements

9
00:00:15,619 --> 00:00:16,559
inside of click

10
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,510
funnels is sections and then rows

11
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:20,550
are essentially contained inside

12
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:21,120
of sections

13
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,429
and then elements aren't contained

14
00:00:23,449 --> 00:00:25,390
inside of rows and there's all

15
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:25,879
different

16
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,539
elements that you can have there's

17
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:29,260
headline sub headline bullet list

18
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:30,359
paragraph

19
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:33,000
links all this stuff right images

20
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,310
video audio all these different

21
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:35,950
things are

22
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,030
elements that you can place inside

23
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:40,609
of rows okay now inside of the

24
00:00:40,609 --> 00:00:42,039
section say for

25
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,130
example I want to go and add a

26
00:00:44,469 --> 00:00:46,149
section right here I go to add

27
00:00:46,229 --> 00:00:48,140
section and I

28
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:50,259
basically can pick blank section

29
00:00:50,469 --> 00:00:51,899
flex or I can do some sort of

30
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:53,090
template that they

31
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,090
have on the section level or I can

32
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:56,799
pick the saved or universal

33
00:00:56,799 --> 00:00:57,880
essentially

34
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,479
flex I don't really use it too

35
00:00:59,479 --> 00:01:01,149
much but it's just a little bit

36
00:01:01,149 --> 00:01:02,020
more of like a

37
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:03,679
flexible section that you can move

38
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:04,959
it and adjust it some more I

39
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,219
always like to just

40
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:08,670
go here blank section by default

41
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:10,780
and then rows is where you can do

42
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:11,609
one column two

43
00:01:11,689 --> 00:01:15,010
three four five six or flex so if

44
00:01:15,109 --> 00:01:18,370
I pick six rows here or six

45
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:19,840
columns in the row

46
00:01:19,909 --> 00:01:21,500
essentially you create you know a

47
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,159
bunch of different ones this is if

48
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:23,730
you want to do

49
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:25,170
like an icon list or like a bunch

50
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:26,379
of bullet point sections or

51
00:01:26,469 --> 00:01:27,230
something like

52
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:28,849
that you can essentially just

53
00:01:28,859 --> 00:01:31,049
build that out there most the time

54
00:01:31,099 --> 00:01:32,079
though I'm doing

55
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:33,849
like one or two maybe three you

56
00:01:33,909 --> 00:01:35,909
know if we're doing something like

57
00:01:36,019 --> 00:01:36,659
I don't know if

58
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:39,939
this page has one but right this

59
00:01:39,939 --> 00:01:42,579
is like a three row right here

60
00:01:42,579 --> 00:01:43,659
with elements

61
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,599
inside of it an image element a

62
00:01:45,989 --> 00:01:47,640
headline element sub headline

63
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,900
element and then a

64
00:01:48,939 --> 00:01:50,900
bullet point element right and

65
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:54,950
then this is a row here and then

66
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:56,200
this section is

67
00:01:56,260 --> 00:02:01,629
contained around it so if we go to

68
00:02:01,709 --> 00:02:04,659
let's just say add a row it's

69
00:02:04,659 --> 00:02:05,310
going to add a row

70
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:06,799
there and then we can pick an

71
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,419
element let's say we want to just

72
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:09,270
do you know this

73
00:02:09,349 --> 00:02:12,379
right here and when I add a

74
00:02:12,379 --> 00:02:17,860
headline so let's do a headline so

75
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:19,360
this page does

76
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,610
have a style sheet by the way I'm

77
00:02:21,689 --> 00:02:23,599
just kind of keep that in mind it

78
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:24,159
does have an

79
00:02:24,259 --> 00:02:25,789
overall style sheet already

80
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:28,199
selected onto it whoops I don't

81
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:29,139
know what was going on

82
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:33,060
there anyways settings if I click

83
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:35,599
here on this headline element and

84
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:36,219
go to settings

85
00:02:36,259 --> 00:02:37,349
this is going to open up

86
00:02:37,349 --> 00:02:39,099
essentially my just editor wizard

87
00:02:39,099 --> 00:02:40,659
there's so many things

88
00:02:40,699 --> 00:02:43,199
that you can do within 2.0 on this

89
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:45,370
I'm starting with you know adding

90
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:46,180
some custom

91
00:02:46,219 --> 00:02:47,550
code to this headline element if

92
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:48,699
you want to do that you can do

93
00:02:48,699 --> 00:02:49,539
that click here and

94
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:51,659
it's going to open this for you

95
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:53,830
but essentially if you want to

96
00:02:53,969 --> 00:02:55,180
just edit real

97
00:02:55,219 --> 00:02:56,840
quick you can go highlight and

98
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,569
then on this toolbar that pops up

99
00:02:58,669 --> 00:02:59,300
on any text

100
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,310
element you can do bold you can go

101
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:03,259
italics you can go underlined

102
00:03:03,259 --> 00:03:04,819
strike through move

103
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,860
it to the side move it to that

104
00:03:07,139 --> 00:03:08,969
side move it to the middle or you

105
00:03:08,969 --> 00:03:10,250
can hyperlink it add your

106
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,719
hyperlink you can also change the

107
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:13,949
color of the hyperlink here and if

108
00:03:13,949 --> 00:03:15,479
you want to do

109
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,430
like telephone so it's a click the

110
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,740
call right you do something like

111
00:03:19,909 --> 00:03:25,419
that big mail to is that if you

112
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:29,680
want to do mail like an email and

113
00:03:29,849 --> 00:03:31,900
then other than that we go over

114
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:34,050
here to settings and if I

115
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:35,759
want to add some top margin

116
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:37,879
basically move that whole element

117
00:03:37,939 --> 00:03:39,449
down as you can see right here

118
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:39,939
like

119
00:03:39,979 --> 00:03:42,490
watch this okay it moves the whole

120
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:46,550
element down okay padding if I add

121
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:48,930
padding it's going to add padding

122
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,210
within that element okay if I want

123
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:57,560
to add padding to the bottom or

124
00:03:57,669 --> 00:04:00,280
remove it I do that if I want to

125
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,379
add padding to the left and right

126
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:04,539
sides I do this that's what I want

127
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:06,360
to make this element you know

128
00:04:06,469 --> 00:04:08,969
tighter or smaller so if I want to

129
00:04:08,969 --> 00:04:11,060
for example make like this

130
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:13,699
headline here you know tighter I

131
00:04:13,699 --> 00:04:14,860
can like

132
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,170
add that if I want to like stack

133
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:17,500
it in the middle for some reason

134
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:23,490
right so let's go back to here and

135
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,000
look at some more settings on the

136
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,509
actual headlines and text so again

137
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,879
if I want to override the actual

138
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,519
style sheet that I have I can hit

139
00:04:33,579 --> 00:04:36,189
override and do that now again

140
00:04:36,189 --> 00:04:38,560
this funnel is set to the style

141
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:38,920

142
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:41,000

can

150
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,750
click there and edit the style

151
00:04:53,769 --> 00:04:55,750

all of the headlines that have

162
00:05:12,459 --> 00:05:14,220
this style sheet applied to it if

163
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,819

slack I'll be able to help you out

166
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:21,100
but it's pretty pretty simple

167
00:05:21,139 --> 00:05:22,970
default or pretty simple there so

168
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:24,689
if I want to override it and say I

169
00:05:24,689 --> 00:05:26,920
just want to edit this L this

170
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,180

like let's make it for photo let's

174
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:36,699
make

175
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,290
it big right and this is on

176
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:40,319
desktop keep in mind we're on the

177
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:42,120
desktop editing so we're only

178
00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:42,779
editing

179
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:45,470
desktop here if I want to add

180
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,420
letter spacing I can do that if I

181
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:51,100
want to add line height so say I

182
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:51,579
have two

183
00:05:51,649 --> 00:05:55,680
lines let's type punch stuff words

184
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,930
words words words misspelled words

185
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:04,350
but hey it's all good it always

186
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:06,569
defaults like 125 percent or so or

187
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:08,410
135 I don't know why I think it

188
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:10,060
looks kind of weird I usually go

189
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:10,139
to

190
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:12,560
like 110 or like 105 and it'll

191
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,379
shrink that there as you guys can

192
00:06:14,379 --> 00:06:16,220
see so we'll keep it there for you

193
00:06:16,339 --> 00:06:18,519
for now if I want to change the

194
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:20,930
color now this is the color if it

195
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:22,759
is not bolded so as you can see

196
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,259
right now it is actually

197
00:06:24,269 --> 00:06:25,769
hyperlinked so I need to

198
00:06:25,769 --> 00:06:27,699
unhyperlink it and the way to do

199
00:06:27,699 --> 00:06:28,579
that is just

200
00:06:28,649 --> 00:06:30,879
basically exit out of it or

201
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:34,139
basically on whoops there you go

202
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:38,019
right here you can unhyperlink it

203
00:06:38,029 --> 00:06:38,379
like that

204
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:40,470
now there's a couple different

205
00:06:40,709 --> 00:06:42,639
color settings on the font so you

206
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:44,680
have your default color if it is

207
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:44,899
not

208
00:06:44,939 --> 00:06:46,579
bolded and you have your bold

209
00:06:46,579 --> 00:06:48,290
color right there then you have

210
00:06:48,389 --> 00:06:49,949
your hyperlink color so if it is

211
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,360
hyperlinked you can edit it there

212
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,000
so right now this is not bolded

213
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,600
right if I go to bold it I can

214
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:55,810
click

215
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:58,209
there and I'll be able to change

216
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:00,769
the color now if it's bolded and

217
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:05,129
you can also do the actual font

218
00:07:05,209 --> 00:07:08,060
weight so you can make it thin

219
00:07:08,069 --> 00:07:12,529
make it super dark medium regular

220
00:07:12,529 --> 00:07:15,360
headlines I usually like to do

221
00:07:15,389 --> 00:07:15,540
like

222
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:17,000
semi bold or bold I think it looks

223
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,220
pretty good so we'll keep it a

224
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:20,519
nice semi bold there but let's do

225
00:07:20,579 --> 00:07:25,910
like this is a headline let's go

226
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:31,350
let's go bold cool and as you can

227
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:35,220
see it is not on bold right here

228
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:35,339
so

229
00:07:35,379 --> 00:07:36,569
what I like to do sometimes like

230
00:07:36,569 --> 00:07:37,610
say I want to make headline

231
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:40,560
something different I'll hit bold

232
00:07:40,689 --> 00:07:45,410
and I'll change the color of the

233
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:48,160
bold element so it's like

234
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:52,079
emphasizes a word it's pretty cool

235
00:07:52,699 --> 00:07:54,480
next

236
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:56,149
some other things you can do the

237
00:07:56,149 --> 00:07:57,970
text casing if you want everything

238
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,639
to be capitals you could do that

239
00:07:59,639 --> 00:07:59,810
if

240
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:02,060
you want it to be mixed you can do

241
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:04,769
that lowercase only the first

242
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:07,560
letter capitalize you can do that

243
00:08:07,629 --> 00:08:11,819
decoration underline strikethrough

244
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:14,279
you got that I've never used that

245
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:16,910
before so I don't know what

246
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:18,920
that is but never used it

247
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,720
positioning positioning here you

248
00:08:21,829 --> 00:08:23,709
can make it the opacity you can

249
00:08:23,709 --> 00:08:24,240
change that

250
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:28,180
right and if you want to add to

251
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:32,798
this element the full box element

252
00:08:32,798 --> 00:08:36,779
here okay so all of this not just

253
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:39,309
this okay if you want to add a

254
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:42,210
background to that element what

255
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:44,639
you can do is you can do the image

256
00:08:44,679 --> 00:08:46,500
here you can select you can select

257
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,029
the image style there like we

258
00:08:48,129 --> 00:08:49,919
talked about before I can go here

259
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,029
and

260
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,789
make this whole element red right

261
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:53,360
see how the whole element does

262
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,200
this again the hierarchy sections

263
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:55,470
rows

264
00:08:55,559 --> 00:08:57,490
elements now if I go here say for

265
00:08:57,830 --> 00:08:59,490
example I just want to have like

266
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:01,429
the red extended here for whatever

267
00:09:01,509 --> 00:09:04,190
reason I just go left to right I

268
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:06,860
can drag this you know a little

269
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:09,480
bit more there or another thing

270
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:09,649
that I

271
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:14,860
like to do is there you go I'll

272
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:19,309
basically make the width of the

273
00:09:19,429 --> 00:09:23,159
row smaller if you want to like

274
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,190
condense the amount of red

275
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:25,529
highlight if you're putting some

276
00:09:25,529 --> 00:09:26,809
background in an element that's

277
00:09:26,809 --> 00:09:27,360
the way to do

278
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:30,500
do to do with the undo button and

279
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,779
go back let's get rid of this ugly

280
00:09:33,779 --> 00:09:39,840
as heck background there toggle it

281
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:39,919
off

282
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,850
if I want to do a text shadow you

283
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:43,850
can do that and make it glow kind

284
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:46,500
of like how we have up here in the

285
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:49,059
eyebrow so it looks like that

286
00:09:49,059 --> 00:09:52,159
looks pretty cool and if I want to

287
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:55,960
remove it you go there if I want

288
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,039
to

289
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,460
I add an icon before the headline

290
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:58,669
you can do that and they have

291
00:09:58,669 --> 00:10:00,179
their icon library there you can

292
00:10:00,179 --> 00:10:00,500
select

293
00:10:00,539 --> 00:10:02,419
from you can change the size of

294
00:10:02,429 --> 00:10:04,269
the icon you could change the

295
00:10:04,309 --> 00:10:06,350
color of the icon you can add some

296
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:06,720
margin

297
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:08,389
to the left of it you can add some

298
00:10:08,389 --> 00:10:10,070
margin to the right of it delete

299
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:12,460
and then same thing for icon after

300
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,659
now something to note is the

301
00:10:14,789 --> 00:10:17,250
visibility settings so if you only

302
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,720
want something to basically be

303
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,320
shown on

304
00:10:20,389 --> 00:10:22,740
desktop you have to go here and

305
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:25,289
click desktop only if you want it

306
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:28,059
to be visible on both desktop and

307
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,159
mobile you'll click all if you

308
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,039
want it to be visible on only

309
00:10:32,039 --> 00:10:34,580
mobile you'll click mobile only if

310
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:34,779
you want

311
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:36,730
to hide it from all devices you'll

312
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:38,539
click this eye here if you want to

313
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:40,340
remove it from all devices and

314
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:40,460
just

315
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,039
delete the thing you'll click

316
00:10:42,049 --> 00:10:42,460
remove

317
00:10:42,529 --> 00:10:45,570
right there so

318
00:10:45,649 --> 00:10:47,470
Sometimes as you're developing

319
00:10:47,899 --> 00:10:49,580
right like this this just looked

320
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:51,570
terrible on mobile there is no way

321
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:51,799
to

322
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:54,659
You know make this like compressed

323
00:10:54,659 --> 00:10:56,019
and make it look good on mobile

324
00:10:56,059 --> 00:10:58,570
So what we did was we went and we

325
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:00,580
just designed a mobile only

326
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:01,409
version

327
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,559
Which you're gonna have to do

328
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:03,580
sometimes when you develop

329
00:11:03,789 --> 00:11:04,850
something first on desktop and

330
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:06,240
that's what we do by the way

331
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:07,809
So we will develop the page

332
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:09,919
initially and build it initially

333
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,279
on desktop view on the desktop

334
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:13,940
version, so we'll create that and

335
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:17,389
After that is done then we'll look

336
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:18,799
at mobile we'll go over here and

337
00:11:18,889 --> 00:11:20,250
toggle over and we'll start to

338
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:21,419
optimize mobile

339
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:22,419
So, you know

340
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:24,279
We'll go here and we'll change the

341
00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:25,970
font size on mobile a little bit.

342
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:27,149
We'll change the line height on

343
00:11:27,149 --> 00:11:27,429
mobile

344
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,190
We'll start just tweaking things,

345
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:30,799
you know add some more margin on

346
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:32,250
mobile because look once you

347
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,360
design something on desktop

348
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:35,720
And you try to optimize it on

349
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,360
mobile or you just open the mobile

350
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:37,649
view

351
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,980
It looks terrible most of the time

352
00:11:40,009 --> 00:11:41,860
like you need to kind of develop

353
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:42,179
them

354
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,240
independently from each other so

355
00:11:45,309 --> 00:11:47,580
sometimes we'll do

356
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,860
Like the whole page pretty much

357
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:51,070
we'll go to each section and

358
00:11:51,179 --> 00:11:52,960
Duplicate it out.

359
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,470
So like hey for example, I wanted

360
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:56,090
this section to be only on mobile

361
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,259
I would duplicate it out and I

362
00:11:58,529 --> 00:11:59,080
would make

363
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,190
one section desktop only

364
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,679
this main one and

365
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,970
Then I would go here and make this

366
00:12:07,009 --> 00:12:09,179
section mobile only and I would

367
00:12:09,179 --> 00:12:10,759
edit them irrespectively of each

368
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,600
other if I choose to do so

369
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,070
Um, but most of the time we'll

370
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,889
just develop it on desktop first

371
00:12:17,029 --> 00:12:18,679
entirely build the full page on

372
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:19,320
desktop

373
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,450
Entirely first and just worry

374
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:23,139
about desktop optimization

375
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,580
Once that is complete then I will

376
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:26,879
go over here to the mobile view

377
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:27,960
and be like, okay, cool

378
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,460
Uh, you know this logo is a little

379
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:31,799
too close to the top.

380
00:12:31,879 --> 00:12:33,429
Let's just add like a little bit

381
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,279
of margin there

382
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:34,730
Cool.

383
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:35,799
That looks better.

384
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:36,279
All right.

385
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,639
This is lining up really well

386
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:39,279
And this headline could be a

387
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:39,960
little bit

388
00:12:40,029 --> 00:12:42,519
Smaller so let's go here and like

389
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:43,720
tweak it down a little bit

390
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,840
Right, you're just going step by

391
00:12:45,889 --> 00:12:46,120
step

392
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:47,720
You're going section by section

393
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,500
element by element row by row and

394
00:12:49,509 --> 00:12:51,059
just trying to adjust things

395
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,580
So they look clean on mobile and

396
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:54,399
if there's anything where like for

397
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,000
example

398
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:57,159
Let me just show you guys like

399
00:12:57,330 --> 00:12:57,919
what this

400
00:12:58,029 --> 00:13:00,759
Looked like, right

401
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:03,710
So i'm going to clone this

402
00:13:06,039 --> 00:13:07,080
Settings

403
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:07,919
I'm going to show you what it

404
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,090
looked like initially when we

405
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:10,190
developed this on desktop

406
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,450
And i'll show you why we made an

407
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:12,779
independent one for mobile.

408
00:13:12,779 --> 00:13:13,559
Okay, so look at this

409
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:15,370
And this i'm just going to change

410
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:15,590
it.

411
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,029
So we know

412
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,110
mobile

413
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,279
Or look at me

414
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,610
Right, it just didn't look clean.

415
00:13:25,629 --> 00:13:27,080
I'd wanted to like center this and

416
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,240
stuff to be fair

417
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,629
It didn't look too too bad, but I

418
00:13:29,629 --> 00:13:30,750
wanted to really center this and

419
00:13:30,759 --> 00:13:31,669
if I centered it here

420
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:33,799
It would also center it on

421
00:13:34,049 --> 00:13:34,360
desktop.

422
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:35,399
So it just didn't look good.

423
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:36,940
So all we did very simple

424
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:39,570
Was we duplicated out this

425
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:40,190
section.

426
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:41,259
We made one for desktop.

427
00:13:41,429 --> 00:13:42,590
We made one for mobile

428
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,159
And we just had the mobile one

429
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:46,269
right here that we

430
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:48,840
Simply centered the the headline

431
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,570
and just developed it like that

432
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,120
So sometimes you'll have to do

433
00:13:52,149 --> 00:13:53,409
that sometimes you'll have to make

434
00:13:53,409 --> 00:13:55,080
some sections and elements desktop

435
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,429
only and mobile only

436
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,870
And in and basically edit them

437
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,250
independent of each other.

438
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,870
So if I were to edit, you know

439
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:02,200
this

440
00:14:02,269 --> 00:14:04,899
section right here

441
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,919
Right say I change this word

442
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,350
It's only going to change it on

443
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:11,799
the mobile only version

444
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:13,750
Okay, because this is the only

445
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:14,039
thing

446
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:17,720
multifamily because this is the

447
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:19,840
Mobile only version of this

448
00:14:20,049 --> 00:14:21,879
element just keeping that very

449
00:14:21,879 --> 00:14:22,500
clear.

450
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:22,669
So

451
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:25,559
You know if that confused you guys

452
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:27,600
like I said just know that there

453
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,679
are ways to edit

454
00:14:29,629 --> 00:14:31,799
elements on desktop as well as

455
00:14:31,889 --> 00:14:32,509
mobile

456
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:35,159
And you just have to know like

457
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:35,559
okay

458
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,399
First i'm sitting down i'm

459
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:38,879
developing the desktop version and

460
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:40,019
then if there's anything that I

461
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:41,240
see once I switch to mobile

462
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:43,649
That I need to optimize around and

463
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:45,000
I can't really just get it

464
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:47,039
Without kind of screwing up how it

465
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:47,879
looks on desktop

466
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:50,279
I duplicate out the section the

467
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:52,070
element or the row make one

468
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:53,149
desktop only

469
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,809
Optimize it for desktop and I make

470
00:14:54,809 --> 00:14:56,419
another one mobile only and

471
00:14:56,419 --> 00:14:57,399
optimize it for

472
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:58,679
mobile

473
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:58,909
Okay

474
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:02,179
So that's pretty much all the

475
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:03,889
sections or the settings for the

476
00:15:03,929 --> 00:15:05,240
actual like text elements

477
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,700
You know, there's a lot of other

478
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:07,639
things that we like to do

479
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:10,070
On click funnels like obviously we

480
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:11,559
have video as something that we

481
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,690
Really push all the time.

482
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:14,950
So we'll embed like wistia or

483
00:15:15,049 --> 00:15:16,759
youtube traditionally wistia is

484
00:15:16,759 --> 00:15:17,480
what we're going to do

485
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:20,460
And we always have auto play off.

486
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,490
I don't really like adding auto

487
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:22,039
play on

488
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,559
I think it's very annoying when

489
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:24,679
you land on the page and it's just

490
00:15:24,769 --> 00:15:24,919
bam

491
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,600
There's a video starting to play

492
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,440
the audio is on.

493
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,029
I don't like that

494
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:30,090
Lazy loading if we're having

495
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,919
trouble getting this to load fast.

496
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:33,399
We'll turn on lazy loading

497
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,879
We don't do the block pause and

498
00:15:35,879 --> 00:15:37,990
here you can add you know padding

499
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:39,559
on the video itself, right?

500
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:42,919
padding there

501
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,019
Can add some padding left and

502
00:15:44,019 --> 00:15:45,120
right if you want to shrink it

503
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:45,870
within that frame

504
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:48,169
And then I was like adding a

505
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:49,769
border so as you can see is a

506
00:15:49,769 --> 00:15:51,730
little thin line of blue around

507
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:52,360
that video

508
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:53,649
I think it looks very clean and

509
00:15:53,649 --> 00:15:54,360
custom branded

510
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,830
So I always add a border and if

511
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:57,850
you want to change the settings of

512
00:15:57,919 --> 00:15:58,279
the border

513
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,279
You can do that here

514
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,500
You know if you don't want it to

515
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,029
be at the top

516
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,529
You just take that off see how it

517
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:04,629
got rid of this blue border up

518
00:16:04,629 --> 00:16:05,220
here at the top

519
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:07,120
I want to add it back on i'll do

520
00:16:07,129 --> 00:16:07,399
that

521
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,779
If I don't remove it from the

522
00:16:08,779 --> 00:16:10,039
bottom for whatever reason I can

523
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:10,440
do that

524
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,940
If I want to add the stroke size

525
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:13,799
and make it bigger I can do that

526
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,870
I like to add a nice little thin

527
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:16,600
one there

528
00:16:16,669 --> 00:16:18,919
Nothing too big if I want to have

529
00:16:18,929 --> 00:16:20,090
it like dotted I can do that

530
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:21,220
I want to have it look like a

531
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,200
bunch of little dots there

532
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,419
You know whatever you want to do

533
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:26,440
shadow if you want to add a shadow

534
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,809
This is how we do it so it looks

535
00:16:30,809 --> 00:16:31,070
cool

536
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:31,919
You know

537
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:36,039
And corners if I want to

538
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:39,320
Make the corners like super super

539
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:39,720
round

540
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:42,139
You can do that want to make them

541
00:16:42,139 --> 00:16:43,730
blocky just get rid of them there

542
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:49,559
And something I like to do as well

543
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:51,370
on some pages have a background

544
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:51,879
image

545
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:54,919
So we'll toggle on background

546
00:16:54,919 --> 00:16:56,139
unless this is where you're using

547
00:16:56,139 --> 00:16:56,679
the style sheet

548
00:16:56,799 --> 00:16:58,169
So if you're using like universal

549
00:16:58,169 --> 00:16:58,509
styles

550
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,279
On that you can select these

551
00:17:00,279 --> 00:17:01,879
whichever background you want

552
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:03,470
If you want to override that

553
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:05,450
You just go here toggle on

554
00:17:05,809 --> 00:17:06,119
background

555
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,029
And you could pick you know your

556
00:17:08,039 --> 00:17:09,068
color if you want a different

557
00:17:09,068 --> 00:17:09,299
color

558
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,759
You can choose your image

559
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:11,950
So we have an image of the car

560
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:13,000
wash in the background

561
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:14,000
Which is the thing they're trying

562
00:17:14,049 --> 00:17:15,000
to get people to invest into

563
00:17:15,068 --> 00:17:17,640
And I have the foreground set

564
00:17:17,779 --> 00:17:21,210
Basically at 93% on the alpha

565
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:22,400
Because I don't want it to look

566
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,529
like this because it's hard to

567
00:17:23,568 --> 00:17:23,710
read

568
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:25,160
It's very hard to read so

569
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:28,200
I go all black and I crank that up

570
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,640
so it's a nice fade that we have

571
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,109
in the background

572
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,549
So it still looks really clean

573
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:32,599
But in the background it's like

574
00:17:32,609 --> 00:17:33,420
hey, I see it.

575
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,130
There's a car wash very

576
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:34,599
interesting

577
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:37,319
so

578
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:39,519
This is an faq section where it's

579
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:41,240
two rows essentially that we have

580
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,039
and then these are

581
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:44,519
a bunch of little just flex boxes

582
00:17:44,519 --> 00:17:44,680
so

583
00:17:44,819 --> 00:17:48,910
This one was you know pretty

584
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:50,079
simple to make we're going to have

585
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:51,319
this in the template for you guys

586
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:53,210
But basically if you want to add

587
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:53,799
some new ones

588
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:54,799
All you got to do is just

589
00:17:54,859 --> 00:17:55,880
duplicate out these

590
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,579
And you could add some of them and

591
00:17:57,589 --> 00:17:59,150
then these are just text box that

592
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:01,960
are inside of the faq

593
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,640
drop down element so

594
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:07,029
Let's go element here

595
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:08,890
You could also like add an image

596
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:10,430
inside of these boxes if you'd

597
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:10,680
like

598
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,380
You know click funnels really at

599
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:13,220
the end of the day.

600
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:14,359
It's just a big old

601
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:17,160
drag and drop builder, okay

602
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,000
You're gonna have to get your

603
00:18:18,099 --> 00:18:19,109
hands dirty a little bit just

604
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,549
editing these things our templates

605
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:21,170
again make it

606
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:24,440
Super easy to use very simple to

607
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,980
to just plug and play slap into an

608
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:29,960
account and and go from but um

609
00:18:30,019 --> 00:18:31,549
overall, you know

610
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:33,019
You're able to like do a lot of

611
00:18:33,019 --> 00:18:34,480
cool stuff like dragging these

612
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,799
accordion features into there

613
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,619
Which are just drop downs

614
00:18:37,619 --> 00:18:39,390
essentially for faqs and you just

615
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:41,150
have to like visualize it a little

616
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:42,680
bit in your mind of what you want

617
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,519
And then from there

618
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,630
It's just like dragging and

619
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:45,769
dropping different blocks and

620
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:46,279
elements.

621
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:46,900
That's really it.

622
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:47,000
So

623
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,019
Button styles is something i'll go

624
00:18:49,019 --> 00:18:50,069
over real quick to you.

625
00:18:50,069 --> 00:18:50,769
So button text

626
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:52,950
That's what you're gonna put there

627
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:53,799
if you want to have like a sub

628
00:18:54,289 --> 00:18:54,660
button

629
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:57,960
You know text

630
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,960
You can have that there

631
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,910
Keep that there because i'll show

632
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:02,599
you guys how to edit

633
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,960
Now the button actions

634
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,710
This is pretty key

635
00:19:07,759 --> 00:19:10,200
So if you want to go to a website

636
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,640
after they click that or some

637
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,299
other page after they click this

638
00:19:13,299 --> 00:19:13,640
button

639
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,210
Do go to and then put the actual

640
00:19:16,289 --> 00:19:17,569
don't worry about this too.

641
00:19:17,569 --> 00:19:18,690
This is uh, something we're

642
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:19,240
testing, but

643
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:21,849
Um, you can click that and from

644
00:19:21,849 --> 00:19:22,119
there

645
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,119
It'll go to a page, right?

646
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,119
So if I wanted to do google.com

647
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,299
whatever that's a stupid thing

648
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:28,490
But if you want to like drive it

649
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:29,880
to a scheduler page or something

650
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:30,269
like that

651
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:31,519
You would just put the scheduler

652
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:32,119
page url there

653
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,710
You can select if you want it to

654
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,160
be opened in a new window or not

655
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,670
and then some other things you can

656
00:19:36,789 --> 00:19:36,839
do

657
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:39,109
Is I don't know why anyone would

658
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:40,200
put nothing happens, but hey

659
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,420
You know if you have a use case

660
00:19:42,529 --> 00:19:43,309
for it go for it

661
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:46,539
Submit order or form so this is

662
00:19:46,539 --> 00:19:49,390
where if I for example would have

663
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:51,720
a bunch of click funnels inputs

664
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:55,339
So if I had the input elements

665
00:19:55,339 --> 00:19:56,539
here like

666
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:59,980
You know full name

667
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,690
Which I'll show you guys how to

668
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:02,440
add these in a sec

669
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:06,549
Phone number

670
00:20:09,079 --> 00:20:10,769
Email I could have it as submit

671
00:20:10,789 --> 00:20:12,359
form and it will submit whatever

672
00:20:12,359 --> 00:20:12,839
information

673
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,269
Has been placed into these fields

674
00:20:15,269 --> 00:20:17,210
here and then it will move on to

675
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:18,799
the next step.

676
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:19,160
So

677
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,109
The next step in the actual funnel

678
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:25,230
And I can hit this thing here that

679
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:26,759
says enable redirect override

680
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:28,039
because here's the thing

681
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,920
If I were to have this checked off

682
00:20:31,009 --> 00:20:32,680
and I basically had a page that

683
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:34,359
collected name phone number email

684
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:35,710
and it had submit form as the

685
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,039
button

686
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:38,529
It would drive me to the next page

687
00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:39,960
in the funnel automatically

688
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,119
If I want to send them somewhere

689
00:20:42,289 --> 00:20:43,579
else after they submitted that

690
00:20:43,579 --> 00:20:43,720
form

691
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:45,700
I would click here and I would put

692
00:20:46,039 --> 00:20:47,480
whatever url that is right here

693
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:49,450
And that will send them over after

694
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:50,759
they submit the form and after

695
00:20:50,759 --> 00:20:51,490
they click this button

696
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:52,880
Basically after they've entered

697
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,890
their information and click this

698
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:55,220
button will send them to that page

699
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,160
that I select or put right here

700
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,140
And you can also have something

701
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,890
where once they click on the the

702
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:02,440
button here and it's starting to

703
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,240
you know submit their stuff

704
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,160
Like there's that little loading

705
00:21:04,269 --> 00:21:06,119
time in between whenever they

706
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:07,910
submitted the actual thing click

707
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:09,000
the button and when they land on

708
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:09,400
the next page

709
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:11,339
You can just have a message pull

710
00:21:11,339 --> 00:21:11,880
up there

711
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,049
Size and spacing very simple

712
00:21:14,049 --> 00:21:15,650
stuff, but if you want it to be

713
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:16,279
full width

714
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:18,380
Which means full width of the

715
00:21:18,609 --> 00:21:20,730
actual row it's contained in you

716
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:22,759
can have it there if not

717
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:25,799
You just do disabled and

718
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:28,680
You can from there

719
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,940
You know kind of like pad the

720
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:30,839
sides of it and stuff

721
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:33,319
I usually like to do

722
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:35,099
Enable for the most part and if I

723
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:37,329
want to shrink this section, I'll

724
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:39,400
just shrink the whole row here

725
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:43,160
And something fancy I like to do

726
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,430
too is say for example

727
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:46,940
I wanted this button for whatever

728
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:48,539
reason to be you know half the

729
00:21:48,609 --> 00:21:50,549
size of these input fields what I

730
00:21:50,549 --> 00:21:51,960
could do is go add a row

731
00:21:52,029 --> 00:21:55,069
knowing that you know my hierarchy

732
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:58,849
Is sections rows elements and then

733
00:21:58,930 --> 00:21:59,559
I can go here

734
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,079
Kill the padding at the top kill

735
00:22:03,079 --> 00:22:04,529
the padding at the bottom and then

736
00:22:04,539 --> 00:22:05,690
I'll shrink this

737
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:07,720
You know to whatever it is there

738
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:09,109
obviously I'll need to go in and

739
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:11,960
go over to here override my

740
00:22:14,279 --> 00:22:15,079
button style

741
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:18,440
Looks like shrink this

742
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,440
And there you go looks ugly, but

743
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,029
yeah, if I wanted to do that, you

744
00:22:24,039 --> 00:22:25,319
can do that so

745
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:29,009
If you want to delete some just go

746
00:22:29,009 --> 00:22:30,839
there delete it

747
00:22:31,339 --> 00:22:32,519
But anyways

748
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:33,359
Let's keep going on here

749
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:34,920
So again, if I wanted to override

750
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,720
the button style

751
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:36,970
So if I want to override what it

752
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:38,319
looks like on hover what it looks

753
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:39,319
like when it's pressed

754
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:40,329
So hover is just when you're

755
00:22:40,339 --> 00:22:41,509
hovering over it like this with

756
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:41,960
your mouse

757
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,049
You can change that

758
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:44,450
I mean you could have a different

759
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:45,869
color you can have the text change

760
00:22:45,869 --> 00:22:47,240
colors different font so you can

761
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,029
go crazy with it

762
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:50,099
I'll usually change the the hover

763
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:52,049
hover color of the actual button

764
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:53,970
itself so the background of the

765
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:54,519
button

766
00:22:55,279 --> 00:22:56,480
And also with press I'll have like

767
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,650
three different you know shades of

768
00:22:57,650 --> 00:22:59,000
blue or something in this case

769
00:22:59,000 --> 00:22:59,799
when this one's blue

770
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:02,000
So maybe like a darker one on

771
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:03,480
hover when it's pressed

772
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:04,910
I'll like change it to I don't

773
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:06,059
know like a really dark blue or

774
00:23:06,059 --> 00:23:07,480
something or a super light blue

775
00:23:07,549 --> 00:23:08,759
Something like that.

776
00:23:08,759 --> 00:23:09,259
It's just kind of fun.

777
00:23:09,269 --> 00:23:10,119
I don't really overthink it

778
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:10,589
honestly

779
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,880
And button font right here.

780
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:13,960
You can change the button font

781
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,230
You can make the font on the

782
00:23:16,289 --> 00:23:17,720
button extra bold.

783
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:18,910
We can make it medium

784
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,109
Semi-bold whatever it is you

785
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:23,839
change the font size here again.

786
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:24,599
This is desktop.

787
00:23:24,599 --> 00:23:25,420
I switched to mobile.

788
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:26,880
I can then change it on mobile

789
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,019
Uh letter spacing if I want to

790
00:23:30,019 --> 00:23:31,710
change the spacing of the letters

791
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,599
there you go

792
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,059
And if I have multiple lines, I

793
00:23:34,059 --> 00:23:35,480
could change the line height

794
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:37,910
So text casing we already covered

795
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:38,859
that earlier

796
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:40,980
Primary text shadow if I want to

797
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:42,309
add a shadow behind this text I

798
00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:43,160
can do so there

799
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,220
And then subtext if I do have

800
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:46,650
subtext right here this little sub

801
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,430
headline thing I can increase the

802
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:49,960
margin I can change the uh

803
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,309
There's increase the margin.

804
00:23:51,309 --> 00:23:52,970
I could change the button font the

805
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:53,710
weight

806
00:23:55,759 --> 00:23:56,519
font size

807
00:23:56,589 --> 00:23:59,000
Letter spacing

808
00:23:59,069 --> 00:24:01,319
Crazy, right?

809
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:02,880
Yeah, that's that's wild usually

810
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,640
like invert it

811
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:06,119
line height

812
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:06,920
text casing

813
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,920
Decoration so just adding some

814
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:10,200
different things to it and if I

815
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,720
want to add like a subtext shadow

816
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,440
I can do that too

817
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,170
If I want to add a border that's

818
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:16,750
more, you know

819
00:24:16,829 --> 00:24:18,809
aggressive or something like that

820
00:24:18,809 --> 00:24:19,640
to the actual

821
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:23,900
Button itself I can do so there

822
00:24:25,789 --> 00:24:29,069
Corners I can pick to change it

823
00:24:29,069 --> 00:24:29,480
here

824
00:24:29,549 --> 00:24:33,140
Separate edges if I want to like

825
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:34,269
make the top left like

826
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:36,440
You know cornered I can do that

827
00:24:36,609 --> 00:24:36,680
there

828
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,759
Maybe only the bottom left and

829
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:39,670
like the top left.

830
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:40,680
I want to do something like that

831
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,160
Don't know why but there you go

832
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,240
And then if I want to have an icon

833
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:47,170
before so here's one before and

834
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:48,490
after which we will do a lot of

835
00:24:48,519 --> 00:24:49,079
the times honestly

836
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:50,369
It looks pretty cool.

837
00:24:50,369 --> 00:24:52,019
Um, we'll just go here and uh

838
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:53,839
select

839
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:55,880
whichever one we want

840
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,670
And we'll just make sure the sizes

841
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,500
match make sure the margin matches

842
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,079
and you are good to roll on that

843
00:25:01,079 --> 00:25:01,880
so

844
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:04,119
Now a couple things on the input

845
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:04,920
fields, right?

846
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,789
So we have multiple different

847
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:07,559
input types

848
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:08,849
So an input field is essentially

849
00:25:08,849 --> 00:25:09,920
just like a form field.

850
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,160
That's really that's literally it

851
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,740
Okay, it's a form field on click

852
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:13,069
funnels

853
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:15,309
So we have you know full name

854
00:25:15,309 --> 00:25:16,869
first name last name email phone

855
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:18,430
shipping address shipping city

856
00:25:18,509 --> 00:25:21,619
State country zip and custom type

857
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:23,940
So usually we're doing like full

858
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:25,259
name or we're doing first name and

859
00:25:25,259 --> 00:25:25,640
last name

860
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,509
Then email and phone and maybe

861
00:25:27,509 --> 00:25:29,130
we'll do custom type to ask like

862
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,579
one other thing from them

863
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,460
But basically if you go full name

864
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:34,609
for example, you can change the

865
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:35,400
label here.

866
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:35,950
So like full

867
00:25:38,279 --> 00:25:38,680
name

868
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:40,150
You can have the label be on the

869
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,670
border up here plus in there.

870
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:43,240
You can have it just be default

871
00:25:43,309 --> 00:25:45,720
within there for you

872
00:25:45,789 --> 00:25:48,599
And you can also

873
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,470
change the actual like font of the

874
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:51,240
label itself

875
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:54,500
By clicking there the letter

876
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:54,990
spacing

877
00:25:55,059 --> 00:26:02,950
Like label there change the actual

878
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:04,650
font too like I said

879
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:09,359
And we got to change the color to

880
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:10,329
actually see it.

881
00:26:10,329 --> 00:26:10,940
There we go.

882
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:12,210
See now we can see it.

883
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:13,319
I saw the wondering where it went

884
00:26:13,359 --> 00:26:16,359
You change there you can make it

885
00:26:16,359 --> 00:26:17,339
bold and we're looking at this

886
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:17,799
thing here

887
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:21,240
Full name, right

888
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:22,680
Make it all caps

889
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,599
Shade it up a little bit

890
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,190
That text shadow

891
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,269
You guys see how it's all the same

892
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:30,519
stuff over and over again really

893
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:32,819
And you know you can change the

894
00:26:32,849 --> 00:26:34,200
the width of the actual input

895
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,000
fields itself

896
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:36,910
You can add more padding

897
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,670
There you can add more padding

898
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:40,099
here

899
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,750
You can put the input in the

900
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:43,480
middle

901
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,750
Alignment within its actual

902
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:48,759
You know container itself

903
00:26:48,829 --> 00:26:53,240
Add some corners to it

904
00:26:53,309 --> 00:26:56,279
Add a border if you want

905
00:26:56,319 --> 00:26:58,119
All these different things

906
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,029
Then from here just make sure that

907
00:27:00,039 --> 00:27:01,160
you know if you want to toggle it

908
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,359
on as required or not required you

909
00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:02,910
do so here

910
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,349
And then if you do have like a

911
00:27:04,349 --> 00:27:05,960
full name first name last name

912
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,160
email phone number input or

913
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:07,480
whatever

914
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:09,359
I'm just like the right one here,

915
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:09,720
right

916
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:12,339
And one that we'll do like I said

917
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:13,539
is a custom type.

918
00:27:13,539 --> 00:27:15,720
So we'll go here custom type

919
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:17,539
And say I want to know if they're

920
00:27:17,539 --> 00:27:19,069
a business owner or not.

921
00:27:19,069 --> 00:27:21,799
So like business owner

922
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,000
required

923
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:26,440
So

924
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:29,140
We could do

925
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:31,799
Are you a business

926
00:27:31,859 --> 00:27:33,710
owner

927
00:27:36,039 --> 00:27:42,819
And that could be you know they

928
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:44,230
essentially like type it in but

929
00:27:44,359 --> 00:27:44,750
let's do

930
00:27:44,819 --> 00:27:50,839
This would be again an input one

931
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,299
is where they type in stuff so

932
00:27:52,309 --> 00:27:54,099
they would type in yes here

933
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,609
If you want to add something like

934
00:27:55,609 --> 00:27:57,690
a drop down you would go to

935
00:28:00,039 --> 00:28:00,200
Form

936
00:28:00,269 --> 00:28:03,359
And you could have like a big old

937
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:04,900
text area by the way too you can

938
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:05,400
do that

939
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:07,240
I never really do that

940
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:09,559
You could have a freaking survey

941
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:10,650
As well

942
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:13,240
Which is super in-depth

943
00:28:13,309 --> 00:28:15,640
Just individualized fields here

944
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,390
Which I again have never done

945
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:21,960
You can go

946
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,599
To checkbox input so if it's like

947
00:28:26,599 --> 00:28:28,660
sometimes the ATP stuff will be

948
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:30,279
like you do like ATP

949
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:31,640
required

950
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:36,440
You know you go here and then you

951
00:28:36,529 --> 00:28:37,559
can edit this and be like

952
00:28:37,619 --> 00:28:40,200
Check here

953
00:28:42,519 --> 00:28:45,789
The box here to subscribe to SMS

954
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:47,799
notifications

955
00:28:47,869 --> 00:28:49,500
Sometimes you have to have like

956
00:28:49,509 --> 00:28:50,119
the ATP stuff

957
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,000
Then you can change like the check

958
00:28:52,349 --> 00:28:53,000
color if you want

959
00:28:53,069 --> 00:28:56,299
You could change you could keep it

960
00:28:56,299 --> 00:28:57,410
start checked if you'd like so

961
00:28:57,430 --> 00:28:58,680
whenever they land an actual page

962
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,519
It's already checked off

963
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,799
And stuff along those lines

964
00:29:04,119 --> 00:29:06,599
And some other ones that we can do

965
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:07,230
and the forms

966
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,319
Is a select box

967
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:12,920
So if you want to do

968
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:16,690
Countries you can do that but I

969
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:19,000
usually do custom options here so

970
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,019
are you a business owner

971
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,380
And I put it like this because you

972
00:29:26,529 --> 00:29:28,119
can't it this is the string and

973
00:29:28,119 --> 00:29:28,759
the output

974
00:29:28,829 --> 00:29:31,400
That it shows this will show up in

975
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,039
like automation

976
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:33,210
So if you're doing automations,

977
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:34,200
it's you just have to know that

978
00:29:34,359 --> 00:29:35,309
like they can't there can't be

979
00:29:35,309 --> 00:29:36,200
spaces here basically

980
00:29:36,269 --> 00:29:37,789
So yes

981
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:39,299
Yes

982
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:41,319
No

983
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:42,839
I am not

984
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,029
No, I am not you also make it

985
00:29:46,289 --> 00:29:46,759
required or not

986
00:29:46,819 --> 00:29:50,940
Change the whole background of the

987
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:52,089
input and

988
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:54,589
You know if we were to go to

989
00:29:54,589 --> 00:29:54,920
preview

990
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,390
See if it shows it or if I have to

991
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,200
make it live or not

992
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,400
Yeah, I'll have to make it live

993
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,730
But definitely don't want to make

994
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:01,869
it live just a live page for a

995
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:02,279
client

996
00:30:02,319 --> 00:30:03,690
But anyways you essentially would

997
00:30:03,690 --> 00:30:04,750
click here and it would drop down

998
00:30:04,759 --> 00:30:05,319
yes or no

999
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:07,450
And from there you could also

1000
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:09,079
again make it required or not

1001
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:12,269
So that is pretty much overall all

1002
00:30:12,289 --> 00:30:12,910
of the uh

1003
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,200
elements within an actual

1004
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,359
You know click funnels page itself

1005
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,380
and if you don't want to save any

1006
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:18,509
of the things that you just did

1007
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:20,789
Guess what you got to do click

1008
00:30:20,849 --> 00:30:21,160
over here

1009
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:23,480
It shows you everything will be

1010
00:30:23,569 --> 00:30:25,000
lost hit okay and you're good to

1011
00:30:25,069 --> 00:30:27,640
roll so that guys is an overview

1012
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:27,960
of

1013
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,640
Literally every single button

1014
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,349
within click funnels and now it's

1015
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:32,680
up to you to take the templates

1016
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,369
And essentially just build and

1017
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,319
combine these elements and makes a

1018
00:30:36,319 --> 00:30:37,390
match and really you're just going

1019
00:30:37,390 --> 00:30:38,920
to get super good at click funnels

1020
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:39,640
just by playing around

1021
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,420
Honestly, that's at the end of the

1022
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:41,880
day what

1023
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,559
What it is playing around and

1024
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:44,700
trying different elements and

1025
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:45,809
looking through their library and

1026
00:30:45,809 --> 00:30:46,680
being like oh this thing could

1027
00:30:46,759 --> 00:30:47,470
look kind of cool

1028
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:48,809
What if I like made the padding a

1029
00:30:48,819 --> 00:30:50,579
little bit bigger here change this

1030
00:30:50,579 --> 00:30:51,960
font or bolded this one here?

1031
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,009
Or you know added a strike through

1032
00:30:54,009 --> 00:30:54,910
here and stuff like that

1033
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,529
Maybe if I broke this into two

1034
00:30:56,529 --> 00:30:56,829
rows

1035
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,259
So let's add two rows instead of

1036
00:30:58,259 --> 00:30:59,920
one row in the section and see how

1037
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,130
that looks a lot of different cool

1038
00:31:01,269 --> 00:31:01,809
things you can do

1039
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,069
Let me know if you have any

1040
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:04,200
questions peace
