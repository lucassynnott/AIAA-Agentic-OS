1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:06,580
All right guys so this is part two

2
00:00:06,629 --> 00:00:08,759
i'm going to go into an actual

3
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:10,699
live client funnel right now and

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:11,699
we're just going to break down

5
00:00:11,699 --> 00:00:12,750
everything from a to z i'm going

6
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:13,980
to click around show you guys all

7
00:00:14,019 --> 00:00:15,310
these different buttons show you

8
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:16,379
guys hey if i had a blank page

9
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:17,649
this is exactly what i would do

10
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:20,179
to basically start developing from

11
00:00:20,179 --> 00:00:22,339
top to bottom and also of course

12
00:00:22,339 --> 00:00:24,239
make sure that it's mobile

13
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:26,100
responsive that's super key a lot

14
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,780
of people forget and just don't

15
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:29,879
simply do so let's dive

16
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,920
into it right now so we'll go to

17
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,140
funnels we're going to pick this

18
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:35,479
client right here

19
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,179
so i typically like to because

20
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:40,750
we're an agency keep there's

21
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:43,799
probably a better way to do it but

22
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,280
look i like to do it this way we

23
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,149
have 12 pages in this funnel now

24
00:00:47,179 --> 00:00:48,950
we have multiple different funnel

25
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,619
types we're running for them we're

26
00:00:50,619 --> 00:00:52,119
running a high velocity opt-in

27
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:53,700
funnel for them which is literally

28
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:54,920
just an opt-in we're also running

29
00:00:54,939 --> 00:00:56,140
a free training funnel for them

30
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:57,469
which is basically a lead magnet

31
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,570
plus a call funnel so i keep

32
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:02,060
everything here inside of this

33
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:04,760
whole entire funnel that's just

34
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:05,810
personally how i like it like

35
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:07,120
right here is the free training

36
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,510
funnel here's the replay page for

37
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:08,659
it

38
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:09,890
here's the qualified and

39
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,540
unqualified confirmation page

40
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:13,549
after they actually booked through

41
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,019
that

42
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,959
respective funnel here's the high

43
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:17,750
velocity opt-in page here is the

44
00:01:17,769 --> 00:01:19,409
beginning of the call funnel and

45
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,750
everything like that so i like to

46
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,959
keep it all just in one funnel

47
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:26,430
right this is what they call a

48
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:26,840
funnel

49
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:28,799
this right here all the pages

50
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,829
right and then you have funnel

51
00:01:30,829 --> 00:01:33,140
steps that's what they refer to it

52
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:33,299
as

53
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:34,879
which funnel steps are essentially

54
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:36,250
just individual landing pages

55
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:39,250
within a full funnel okay so and i

56
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:39,859
just

57
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:40,879
want to let you guys know that

58
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:41,989
because like sometimes their

59
00:01:41,989 --> 00:01:43,310
support will ask you these things

60
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:44,790
and you're like i don't i don't

61
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:46,459
know what the difference is like i

62
00:01:46,629 --> 00:01:47,799
thought a landing page was

63
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,400
a funnel it's not but like the

64
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,230
funnel is the full thing landing

65
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:52,840
pages are here within it so

66
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:55,519
don't mind my coffee too we're

67
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:59,099
ripping y'all know it anyways so

68
00:01:59,099 --> 00:02:02,159
uh basically just make sure that

69
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:02,579
you go to

70
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,640
the actual settings of the funnel

71
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,430
initially select your domain

72
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:09,479
change name now this one here just

73
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:09,800
note

74
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,500
this is your master url now the

75
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:15,330
master url is going to begin the

76
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:16,919
first step so when you look at

77
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:17,469
this funnel

78
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:19,620
technically it's like step one

79
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,930
step two step three step four step

80
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:23,780
five step six that's how they

81
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,430
really

82
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:26,039
like processed it and made it um

83
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:27,759
again we don't really follow that

84
00:02:27,819 --> 00:02:28,360
logic but

85
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:30,789
basically like this all you need

86
00:02:30,789 --> 00:02:32,319
to know is this is your master url

87
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,750
so if you're running some sort of

88
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,020
split test between these two pages

89
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:38,020
like we were here you would need

90
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:39,879
to use this url here because

91
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:41,449
it's going to go depending on what

92
00:02:41,449 --> 00:02:42,889
you set this percentage to be on

93
00:02:42,909 --> 00:02:44,360
the split test it's going to

94
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,030
divvy up the traffic between these

95
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:47,439
two pages right now it's set to

96
00:02:47,659 --> 00:02:49,400
100 going to this page but if i

97
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:49,560
was

98
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:50,750
doing you know if i clicked on

99
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,259
this and dragged it to 50 50

100
00:02:52,259 --> 00:02:53,879
essentially it would drive 50 of

101
00:02:53,939 --> 00:02:54,280
the traffic

102
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:55,650
here 50 of the traffic here and

103
00:02:55,659 --> 00:02:56,569
that's how i did a that's

104
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:57,949
basically how i do a split test

105
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,080
right and you

106
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:00,469
essentially would just click here

107
00:03:00,469 --> 00:03:02,319
and this is your master url and it

108
00:03:02,389 --> 00:03:05,159
would split the traffic between

109
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:06,979
these two so if you're going to

110
00:03:06,979 --> 00:03:08,860
run ads use this url up here okay

111
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:10,680
if you're doing like some sort of

112
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:12,280
split test if for whatever reason

113
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,710
you just want to drive traffic

114
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:15,400
only to this page just click there

115
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:17,009
and you'll be able to copy that

116
00:03:17,009 --> 00:03:19,169
individual landing pages url put

117
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:21,800
it into your ads manager and run

118
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,280
it so

119
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,550
other things too i always turn

120
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:27,539
this to uh to live once we launch

121
00:03:27,539 --> 00:03:29,719
even if we're not doing payments

122
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:32,300
this is the overall funnel path

123
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,610
right so this one up here

124
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:37,439
make sure you hide this make sure

125
00:03:37,449 --> 00:03:40,039
the head code is good if you do

126
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:42,439
want to select that style sheet

127
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:43,400
that's where you're going to

128
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,479
select it right here you can

129
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:46,189
override it on the actual landing

130
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:47,379
page level like

131
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:48,449
if you have the style sheet you

132
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,909
can change the font still but this

133
00:03:49,909 --> 00:03:51,400
will just make sure everything is

134
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:53,189
just by default fitting that style

135
00:03:53,189 --> 00:03:54,719
sheet which we went over in the

136
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:56,199
first video a little bit and i

137
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,759
showed you guys what it looks like

138
00:03:57,759 --> 00:03:59,189
then if you want to tag it you can

139
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:01,599
tag it but there we go so

140
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,069
let's dive into the page itself

141
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:15,150
cool so a couple things to note

142
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:18,259
all right first off at the the top

143
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:20,980
here so what you're going to see

144
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,370
is over here so drag and drop or

145
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:23,709
sorry not drag and drop you can

146
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,319
move to different funnel steps if

147
00:04:25,379 --> 00:04:25,399
you

148
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:27,379
want to over here or different

149
00:04:27,379 --> 00:04:29,399
landing pages but essentially

150
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:31,560
let's go from left to right here

151
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:31,879
so this

152
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,680
is help if you need it this will

153
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,649
show you any errors and warnings

154
00:04:36,259 --> 00:04:40,529
this is essentially just a

155
00:04:40,529 --> 00:04:42,939
overview of all the different

156
00:04:42,939 --> 00:04:44,680
sections rows columns because

157
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,079
sometimes

158
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,620
you might like have something

159
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,360
that's uh basically like you just

160
00:04:48,459 --> 00:04:49,959
can't pull it up or you can't move

161
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:50,439
it

162
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,009
for whatever reason um you know

163
00:04:52,009 --> 00:04:53,699
sometimes there's just glitches

164
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:54,920
within click funnels so if you

165
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,160
want to

166
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,670
like move a headline around or a

167
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:58,339
row or something you can basically

168
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:00,439
just drag that and move it uh this

169
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:00,759
way if

170
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,399
you uh if you care care to then

171
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:06,160
from there this is where you can

172
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:08,839
start to add sections so they have

173
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:09,000
a

174
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,019
ton of different you know

175
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:13,240
universal sections so ton of

176
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,680
different headers ton of different

177
00:05:15,709 --> 00:05:16,120
you know

178
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,769
stacks and product stacks and all

179
00:05:17,769 --> 00:05:19,850
that ton of different templates so

180
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,639
we have used like some of these as

181
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,139
inspiration but uh most of the

182
00:05:23,139 --> 00:05:24,819
time we're still developing from

183
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:26,279
like scratch or using one of our

184
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:27,699
templates like i said we're going

185
00:05:27,699 --> 00:05:28,990
to share with you guys but if you

186
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,439
do find something you're like okay

187
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,629
cool this product stack could be

188
00:05:31,629 --> 00:05:32,839
pretty interesting let me go and

189
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:35,240
do that you can just grab this and

190
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:35,389
just

191
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:37,360
slap it into the uh slap it into

192
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,399
the funnel so other than that you

193
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:45,110
also have your saved sections

194
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:45,560
which

195
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,230
most of the time if we have some

196
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:49,060
sort of like value stack section

197
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:50,920
or features section that we like

198
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,079
to

199
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,019
do and transfer across clients

200
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,790
we'll just save it and you can

201
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,480
just go and basically you know pop

202
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:57,709
it here

203
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,259
if you want to save a section very

204
00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:00,689
simple you just hover over the

205
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:03,319
section because essentially when

206
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:03,399
you

207
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:05,629
think about click funnels it's

208
00:06:05,629 --> 00:06:07,860
built in sections then you go to

209
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:10,759
row right there and then you have

210
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:11,350
the element

211
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:13,209
within the row okay so you have to

212
00:06:13,209 --> 00:06:14,949
make sure you hover and it's the

213
00:06:14,949 --> 00:06:17,560
green section here hit save and

214
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:17,689
then

215
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,050
you can basically save it and if

216
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:20,339
you want to save it under like a

217
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:21,879
folder or something like you know

218
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,100
this would be like estimate

219
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:25,759
mastery all right our our client

220
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,439
there you can save that if you

221
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:28,569
want to

222
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,480
have like different sections and

223
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,019
rows and stuff like that and

224
00:06:32,019 --> 00:06:34,199
elements saved to different uh

225
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:34,430
different

226
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,040
clients you can do that different

227
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,370
folders so you can save like i

228
00:06:37,389 --> 00:06:39,160
said a headline here or an element

229
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:41,990
all right you can save a video

230
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:43,839
element you could save a row you

231
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:45,560
could save a section whatever you

232
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,170
want to do you just got to do that

233
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:48,740
and click save if you delete it

234
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,509
you can click delete there if you

235
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,920
want to use some custom code which

236
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,220
that's beyond the scope of what

237
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,519
we're going to go over here you

238
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:54,920
can

239
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:57,670
click there clone settings which

240
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,329
we'll get into in a sec that's all

241
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:02,430
the settings on that you know

242
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:04,040
respective section and if you want

243
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,350
to move it you can just grab it

244
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:06,839
and start moving it or of course

245
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:08,519
you can go

246
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,740
here and just move things around

247
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:12,519
so if you want to do a pop-up

248
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:15,959
hover here click show pop-up make

249
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:16,120
sure

250
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,000
when you when you actually go to

251
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,850
uh you know edit pop-ups that you

252
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:21,800
also edit on a mobile by the way

253
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:23,660
big mistake i've made before make

254
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:25,790
sure to do that then from there

255
00:07:25,949 --> 00:07:27,959
you can do the edit the settings

256
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:28,089
of

257
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,649
the pop-up so which will get into

258
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:31,110
a bunch of the settings here but

259
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,620
this is where you can basically

260
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,000
toggle

261
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,769
with the margin at the top the

262
00:07:34,779 --> 00:07:36,709
margin at the bottom you can you

263
00:07:36,709 --> 00:07:38,600
know have it to where it triggers

264
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:38,750
on

265
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,060
exit or not you can have it to

266
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,589
where it triggers on page load or

267
00:07:41,589 --> 00:07:43,160
not i hate i hate that i hate both

268
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:44,790
them honestly um you can have the

269
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:46,550
backdrop color you can change that

270
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:48,439
around which essentially is this

271
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:50,449
backdrop over here so you'll see

272
00:07:50,449 --> 00:07:52,600
like it can make it darker lighter

273
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:56,110
all that fun stuff left and right

274
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:58,540
padding so you can make it smaller

275
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:00,779
and bigger you can make it wider

276
00:08:00,779 --> 00:08:03,879
even more too you can add some

277
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,100
more padding so padding

278
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:06,670
essentially will add like

279
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:08,379
basically just that padding to

280
00:08:08,379 --> 00:08:09,959
whatever you know

281
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:11,560
whatever element or row or section

282
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,029
you're essentially trying to uh

283
00:08:13,029 --> 00:08:14,759
you're essentially toggling it on

284
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:14,910
so

285
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:16,939
by the way too whenever you see

286
00:08:16,939 --> 00:08:19,230
this computer icon that means you

287
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,550
are editing that element in its

288
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,589
desktop

289
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,180
view in format if you want to

290
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:25,899
switch to mobile you can click

291
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,639
here or you can go into mobile

292
00:08:27,769 --> 00:08:28,120
only view

293
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,490
and then click the element there

294
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:32,580
but go back here bottom we'll

295
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,418
change padding there padding there

296
00:08:34,509 --> 00:08:34,519
left

297
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,340
and right we'll change padding

298
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:38,129
there then if you want to change

299
00:08:38,179 --> 00:08:39,918
background for example on the

300
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:40,440
pop-up

301
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,960
you go here you can do an image

302
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,048
with your image library and you

303
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,049
just upload a new image there

304
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:49,379
you can do image style so we

305
00:08:49,379 --> 00:08:51,519
usually do you know essentially

306
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:52,990
like full center we just kind of

307
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,159
like

308
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:55,610
toggle it till it looks good image

309
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:57,659
fit if you want it to be placed

310
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,720
this way that way this way that

311
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,039
way

312
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,639
we always do mainly center just

313
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:03,049
leave it blank don't really

314
00:09:03,049 --> 00:09:05,320
overthink that part and then if

315
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:05,440
you want

316
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,299
to change the background you can

317
00:09:07,299 --> 00:09:08,980
do that here you could also use

318
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:10,879
style guide which style guide by

319
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,309
the way

320
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:13,870
is from the style sheets so for

321
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:15,620
this client style sheet in the

322
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:17,639
settings from section one we set

323
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:17,870
up

324
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:19,100
all these different colors that

325
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,370
these are their brand colors so i

326
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:22,600
can just easily go here and say oh

327
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:22,830
i know

328
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:24,850
that this blue is their respective

329
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:26,590
blue for their their this client

330
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:28,360
right i can go there and make it

331
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:28,669
blue if

332
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,289
i want you know border this

333
00:09:32,289 --> 00:09:35,080
essentially just the the border

334
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,429
here shadow if i want to add a

335
00:09:37,429 --> 00:09:38,600
shadow it'll add

336
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:40,710
that there corner if i want to

337
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:43,889
basically add a corner it's right

338
00:09:43,889 --> 00:09:46,440
there now again these are the

339
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,080
styles from

340
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,070
your style sheet okay so in the

341
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,320
style sheet in that main settings

342
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,159
we went and started to toggle

343
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:53,379
around

344
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,789
some things so if i have like

345
00:09:54,789 --> 00:09:56,570
three types of corners basically i

346
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:58,120
can set them there if i want to

347
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:58,509
edit it

348
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,269
further i just click this button

349
00:10:00,269 --> 00:10:01,870
here and it allows me to custom

350
00:10:01,899 --> 00:10:04,100
override that style sheet that's

351
00:10:04,529 --> 00:10:04,679
pretty

352
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,230
universal for any element in any

353
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:08,950
section if you go to advance um i

354
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:11,960
really never touch this stuff

355
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,529
not gonna lie like ever touch this

356
00:10:14,529 --> 00:10:17,070
stuff so not even gonna go over it

357
00:10:17,129 --> 00:10:18,639
and we built a lot of pages

358
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,029
uh let me just make sure i didn't

359
00:10:20,029 --> 00:10:23,320
have some crazy stuff that i added

360
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:28,360
no cool so uh another

361
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,139
thing too with click funnels just

362
00:10:30,139 --> 00:10:31,879
because it was on my mind make

363
00:10:31,879 --> 00:10:33,879
sure you save your stuff

364
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:34,759
frequently

365
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:36,309
okay make sure you click this

366
00:10:36,309 --> 00:10:38,190
little save button over here quite

367
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:39,960
frequently because it is a

368
00:10:40,769 --> 00:10:41,389
nightmare

369
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,740
at times especially like if you

370
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:44,159
get a little blip in your internet

371
00:10:44,179 --> 00:10:46,509
or whatever like i've edited page

372
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:48,039
while pages while i'm traveling

373
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:49,389
and you know on a plane and you

374
00:10:49,389 --> 00:10:50,759
get like a little blip on the

375
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:51,320
internet

376
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,490
and it dies out and unfortunately

377
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:55,600
unlike some other page builders

378
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,720
click funnels does not save your

379
00:10:58,259 --> 00:10:59,700
progress even if it's offline for

380
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,960
a little bit of time so

381
00:11:01,029 --> 00:11:02,929
essentially it just wipes out all

382
00:11:02,929 --> 00:11:03,320

397
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,830

00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:33,080
of this

401
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,120
stuff here's custom code sometimes

402
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,830
if we want to make like right here

403
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:38,600
a uh you know we want to highlight

404
00:11:39,139 --> 00:11:40,529
something if we do a strikethrough

405
00:11:40,529 --> 00:11:42,179
like we want to make this one to

406
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:43,879
do the strikethrough element

407
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:45,840
we'll uh we'll do that with custom

408
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,649
code so it's very easy with chat

409
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:47,879
gpt

410
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:50,570
right there basically just ask

411
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:53,370

412
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,799
in click funnels 2.0

413
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,629
i want to make it to where it is

414
00:11:57,629 --> 00:11:59,799
this color if i do a strikethrough

415
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:02,279
um how do i basically do that

416
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,649
and it will tell you exactly how

417
00:12:03,649 --> 00:12:05,169
to do that and then by the way

418
00:12:05,169 --> 00:12:07,480
again with the actual pixel or the

419
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,250
sorry the standard event code not

420
00:12:09,259 --> 00:12:10,769
the pixel um for meta you will

421
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,279
have to place that in the footer

422
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:12,429
for

423
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,330
click funnels 2.0 not the header

424
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:15,750
like a lot of people tried to do

425
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,320
it does not work in the header

426
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,139
just the footer so i'll see you

00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:21,049
