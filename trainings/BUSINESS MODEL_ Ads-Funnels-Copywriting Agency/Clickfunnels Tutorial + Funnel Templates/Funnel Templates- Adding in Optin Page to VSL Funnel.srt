1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,109
All right, what's up guys, so just

2
00:00:03,109 --> 00:00:04,750
going to do a quick overview of

3
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:06,000
the opt-in page.

4
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:07,769
So this is basically at your

5
00:00:08,259 --> 00:00:09,710
disposal if you want to have an

6
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:12,000
opt-in page where people submit,

7
00:00:12,109 --> 00:00:13,490
typically just name, phone number,

8
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:14,710
and email, sometimes one qualifier

9
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:17,000
question before the

10
00:00:17,109 --> 00:00:19,089
actual VSL page where they have

11
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:21,690
the application, the calendar, all

12
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:23,000
that fun stuff.

13
00:00:23,109 --> 00:00:25,000
So I did leave some copy on here.

14
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:27,579
This is for a cold email kind of

15
00:00:27,649 --> 00:00:29,000
setup offer.

16
00:00:29,109 --> 00:00:31,079
You guys probably all know that

17
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:32,000
type of offer.

18
00:00:32,109 --> 00:00:33,270
And I left a copy on there in this

19
00:00:33,289 --> 00:00:34,850
section mainly, as well as this

20
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:37,000
section that we like to have,

21
00:00:37,109 --> 00:00:38,600
just to again, give you guys some

22
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,219
like context on everything and

23
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,000
what you should be essentially

24
00:00:42,109 --> 00:00:44,000
putting in these sections.

25
00:00:44,109 --> 00:00:45,899
And other than that, I love having

26
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:48,219
the get pricing and details as the

27
00:00:48,219 --> 00:00:50,000
actual CTA and the button.

28
00:00:50,109 --> 00:00:51,509
And these, we have a pop-up that

29
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:53,090
goes, so you can change the color

30
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:54,000
of the pop-up.

31
00:00:54,109 --> 00:00:55,689
Remember if you go here, you can

32
00:00:55,689 --> 00:00:57,000
change the backdrop.

33
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,329
So the opacity there, you can

34
00:00:58,329 --> 00:01:00,000
change the color of the backdrop.

35
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:01,929
I usually just do like kind of

36
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,000
this faded out black there.

37
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:05,000
I toggle these off.

38
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:05,780
So trigger on exit, trigger on

39
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:08,000
load, I toggle that garbage off.

40
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:09,159
And you know, you can change the

41
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:10,000
width of the pop-up.

42
00:01:10,109 --> 00:01:11,469
You can change the background of

43
00:01:11,469 --> 00:01:12,000
it here.

44
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:13,090
So if you go to background, you

45
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:14,000
want to make it black.

46
00:01:14,109 --> 00:01:15,000
You can do that.

47
00:01:15,109 --> 00:01:17,019
Just make sure that you also have

48
00:01:17,129 --> 00:01:19,099
to change the rows and the section

49
00:01:19,099 --> 00:01:20,000
backgrounds.

50
00:01:20,109 --> 00:01:21,260
If you are to do a different

51
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:22,760
background, just make sure to

52
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,000
match them, right?

53
00:01:24,109 --> 00:01:25,000
Let's go here.

54
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:26,000
It's going to change that.

55
00:01:26,069 --> 00:01:26,719
So you kind of got like two

56
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:27,750
sections to change the background

57
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:30,000
color if you choose to do so.

58
00:01:30,109 --> 00:01:31,349
And of course, if you want to

59
00:01:31,349 --> 00:01:33,000
change up any of the font styles,

60
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,250
you can go here, swap them up to

61
00:01:35,329 --> 00:01:36,000
whatever you really deem fit.

62
00:01:36,109 --> 00:01:37,540
Just make sure it's congruent

63
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:39,000
across the whole funnel.

64
00:01:39,109 --> 00:01:40,629
You know, make sure that like

65
00:01:40,629 --> 00:01:42,420
you're not switching fonts from

66
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:43,609
the VSL page over to the

67
00:01:43,659 --> 00:01:45,290
confirmation page, the opt-in

68
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:45,989
page, all that stuff.

69
00:01:46,109 --> 00:01:48,000
So just going to exit out here.

70
00:01:48,109 --> 00:01:49,659
And if you do want to add in some

71
00:01:49,659 --> 00:01:51,469
more form fields, again, you go

72
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:53,000
there, clone it out.

73
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:54,209
Of course, make sure that looks

74
00:01:54,209 --> 00:01:55,370
clean on mobile and everything

75
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:56,469
looks good, especially with

76
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:57,000
pop-ups.

77
00:01:57,109 --> 00:01:58,760
You're going to want to actually

78
00:01:58,769 --> 00:02:00,000
test on your phone.

79
00:02:00,049 --> 00:02:01,409
I don't know why people don't do

80
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:02,939
that, but go on your actual phone

81
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:04,420
and test to see how the pop-up

82
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:05,000
looks.

83
00:02:05,109 --> 00:02:06,189
Test to see how all these sections

84
00:02:06,189 --> 00:02:07,379
look, like make sure the spacing

85
00:02:07,379 --> 00:02:08,000
is good here.

86
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:10,000
All those sorts of things, right?

87
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:13,000
So this is the opt-in page.

88
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:14,629
I love to put case studies down

89
00:02:14,629 --> 00:02:16,250
here as well and just a bunch of

90
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:18,090
CTAs to get pricing and details of

91
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:19,000
the pop-up.

92
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:20,889
This section also, whenever I heat

93
00:02:20,889 --> 00:02:23,000
map these pages, stops the scroll.

94
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,000
It's a pattern interrupt, right?

95
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:25,139
You have this nice black

96
00:02:25,139 --> 00:02:26,680
background everywhere and then

97
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,550
bam, you get exactly what you get

98
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:28,000
with the system.

99
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:29,500
You could also talk about benefits

100
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,000
from here, like the outcomes.

101
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:32,180
You can talk about features,

102
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,490
really whatever you're trying to

103
00:02:33,509 --> 00:02:34,000
convey.

104
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:35,620
You can split test different

105
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:37,000
pieces of copy there.

106
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:39,000
So yeah, this is the page.

107
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:41,490
And then after they hit submit,

108
00:02:41,509 --> 00:02:43,990
you want to route them over to the

109
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:45,000
VSL page.

110
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:46,550
So if you do have this as the

111
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,259
first step in your form and or the

112
00:02:48,259 --> 00:02:49,379
first step in your funnel and they

113
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:50,000
click this,

114
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:51,539
they're going to automatically go

115
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:53,710
over to, uh, to that next page

116
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:55,000
right there.

117
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,310
So you can also do a redirect

118
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:57,000
override.

119
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,199
If you want to send them to a

120
00:02:58,199 --> 00:02:59,860
different URL, you just go there

121
00:02:59,889 --> 00:03:01,000
and paste that URL.

122
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:02,750
And if not, again, if this is step

123
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,439
one in my funnel here, once I

124
00:03:04,449 --> 00:03:07,979
click submit form, I'm going to go

125
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,949
over to the next step in the

126
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,000
funnel.

127
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:12,169
Basically in my click funnels log

128
00:03:12,259 --> 00:03:13,000
machine.

129
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:14,569
So, uh, yeah, let me know if you

130
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:16,000
guys have any questions.

131
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:17,460
And of course, if you want to like

132
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,000
drop the spacing there, you can do

133
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
so all this fun jazz and just

134
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,000
very, uh, very easy.

135
00:03:21,099 --> 00:03:22,360
It's really just at the end of the

136
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,580
day, making these funnels is

137
00:03:23,659 --> 00:03:25,370
testing different things, seeing

138
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:27,759
how it looks or Hey, going onto

139
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:29,169
your phone and looking and seeing

140
00:03:29,169 --> 00:03:29,960
how it looks on your phone, trying

141
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,969
it on desktop, trying it on

142
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,000
mobile, all that stuff.

143
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:35,189
So, uh, this is a structure there

144
00:03:35,189 --> 00:03:37,000
for a opt in page.

145
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:37,639
And let me know if you have any

146
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:38,000
questions.

147
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:39,000
Peace.

148
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:41,000
All right.

149
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:43,039
So real quick, I forgot to also

150
00:03:43,259 --> 00:03:45,280
mention that something we like to

151
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,319
do sometimes on the opt in pages

152
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:48,530
above the fold is we'll

153
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:49,960
essentially do a gift.

154
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:51,879
So I know this is like a video

155
00:03:52,259 --> 00:03:53,469
thumbnail of a VSL, but

156
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:55,770
essentially we'll do a gift of the

157
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:58,060
VSL sometimes where if they click

158
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:59,699
that gift, so we'll embed it

159
00:03:59,699 --> 00:04:01,069
usually right around here under

160
00:04:01,069 --> 00:04:02,000
the sub headline.

161
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:03,240
Um, sometimes we'll also put the

162
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,000
button above it.

163
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,539
So we'll have it like right

164
00:04:05,539 --> 00:04:07,469
between this section, this main

165
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,250
fold section and this content

166
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:12,039
section, but we'll basically have

167
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:14,330
a gift of like a section of the

168
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:17,000
VSL and a little play button.

169
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:19,000
And we'll click on that and it'll

170
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,000
have a popup.

171
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:21,649
Um, so it basically would be kind

172
00:04:21,649 --> 00:04:23,220
of like a, this and gift version

173
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:24,730
and you click this and it would

174
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:26,000
have the, the popup.

175
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:27,209
So that whole image would

176
00:04:27,209 --> 00:04:29,000
essentially be clicked to pop up.

177
00:04:29,089 --> 00:04:30,199
So just a little trick we like to

178
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:31,439
do if you're like, I can't get

179
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,000
this thing looking too clean.

180
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:34,240
I want to like split test an

181
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,029
element, uh, like a visual element

182
00:04:36,029 --> 00:04:37,000
above the fold.

183
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,680
You can pull out again, a gift of

184
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,000
a section of your VSL.

185
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:42,000
That's pretty attractive and cool.

186
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:43,209
And you can just slap it up there

187
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,000
above the fold.

188
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:45,250
That does work pretty well

189
00:04:45,259 --> 00:04:46,000
sometimes.

190
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:47,000
So peace.

191
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:50,000
All right guys.

192
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:50,750
And just something real quick to

193
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:51,000
note.

194
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:53,550
If you are using the, uh, VSL call

195
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:55,029
funnel template at the bottom here

196
00:04:55,029 --> 00:04:56,000
is the opt-in page.

197
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:58,000
So all you're going to want to do,

198
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,470
if you're going to essentially

199
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:01,250
want to use the opt-in page is

200
00:05:01,339 --> 00:05:04,430
just grab it here, pull it up to

201
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:06,420
the top and put it as the first

202
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:06,980
step.

203
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:09,439
If you do not want it, you can

204
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,250
either go here, remove it, or if

205
00:05:12,329 --> 00:05:14,129
you just want to keep it in the

206
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:16,000
template or essentially in your

207
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,000
funnel,

208
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:19,029
simply grab it here and place it

209
00:05:19,029 --> 00:05:20,000
there.

210
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:21,000
Good to roll.

211
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:21,459
Good to roll.
