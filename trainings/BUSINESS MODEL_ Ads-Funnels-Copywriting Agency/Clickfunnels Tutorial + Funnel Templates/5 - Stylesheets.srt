00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:03,229
Hey guys i just wanted to clear up

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:04,690
style sheets a little bit more for

3
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:05,690
you so what you're going to

4
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:08,449
want to do if you're on the main

5
00:00:08,449 --> 00:00:11,099
dashboard is go to workspace

6
00:00:11,109 --> 00:00:13,679
settings styles and then here's

7
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:13,900
where

8
00:00:13,939 --> 00:00:15,710
you can make a style sheet so you

9
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:17,539
can make a new one here i'm going

10
00:00:17,539 --> 00:00:19,079
to go into an existing one

11
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,829
and typically what we do is once

12
00:00:20,829 --> 00:00:22,309
we have one style sheet we like

13
00:00:22,519 --> 00:00:23,949
then we're going to just

14
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:25,559
duplicate it out change some

15
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:27,250
colors and fonts per client or per

16
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,870
you know funnel that we're trying

17
00:00:29,019 --> 00:00:29,120
to

18
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,600
make so for example let's click on

19
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,250
this company's style sheet here so

20
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:36,820
a style sheet is essentially a

21
00:00:36,859 --> 00:00:38,500
universal style that you can

22
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,250
essentially just place onto a

23
00:00:40,259 --> 00:00:41,929
funnel so if you have a client

24
00:00:41,929 --> 00:00:42,600
that their

25
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,679
color schemes are these colors

26
00:00:44,679 --> 00:00:46,460
here their backgrounds are

27
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,859
typically these backgrounds here

28
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:51,390
their fonts are typically these

29
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:53,929
fonts here with these sizes you

30
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:56,799
can essentially do that you can

31
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:57,539
also set

32
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:02,310
all right i want the colors for

33
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:06,079
this page to look like this based

34
00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:08,189
upon their branding i want the

35
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:10,459
fonts to look like this based upon

36
00:01:10,459 --> 00:01:12,659
their branding and essentially

37
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:14,799
what you can do once you designate

38
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:19,030
the fonts the colors the shadows

39
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:22,629
the border style even the button

40
00:01:23,239 --> 00:01:26,230
style this helps a lot honestly in

41
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:27,269
the corner

42
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,519
style for different elements on

43
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:31,689
one particular style sheet then

44
00:01:31,689 --> 00:01:35,060
what you want to do is go

45
00:01:35,099 --> 00:01:38,280
over to the funnel so once i have

46
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,530
that style sheet created right

47
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:40,659
like i made this one here

48
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,599
for this client i go into funnels

49
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:48,719
i find their designated funnel i

50
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:51,430
click settings and then i can

51
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,099
select the style sheet so now

52
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:55,319
whenever i go to make the

53
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:57,489
the funnel by default the colors

54
00:01:57,489 --> 00:01:59,379
will match what i put in the style

55
00:01:59,379 --> 00:02:01,120
sheet so it'll match the branding

56
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:01,780
the fonts

57
00:02:01,819 --> 00:02:03,670
will match what i put in the style

58
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:05,430
sheet so it's a lot easier just to

59
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:07,780
start building from you know

60
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:08,280
square one

61
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:09,560
essentially on these funnels so

62
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,310
that's style sheets and you know

63
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:13,780
very simple it's a universal style

64
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:14,020
sheet for

65
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:16,770
or whatever funnel you essentially

66
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:17,879
just selected on.
