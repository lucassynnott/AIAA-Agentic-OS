1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:03,060
All right guys so real quick we're

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:04,360
just going to go in to click

3
00:00:04,469 --> 00:00:05,240
funnels and I'm

4
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:06,650
just going to make a new funnel

5
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:08,130
from scratch it's pretty pretty

6
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:08,759
easy and

7
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,000
everything so we're going to go to

8
00:00:11,009 --> 00:00:14,039
funnels right here create funnel

9
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:14,500
I'm

10
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:15,539
just going to create one from

11
00:00:15,539 --> 00:00:16,500
totally scratch I'm not going to

12
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:16,859
use their

13
00:00:16,899 --> 00:00:20,359
templates and let's do test funnel

14
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:23,370
make sure if you want to change

15
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:24,210
the URL you

16
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:29,359
can there so now we're going to

17
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,840
add our first step so we're going

18
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:33,179
to go here

19
00:00:33,219 --> 00:00:35,109
we're going to create a page you

20
00:00:35,429 --> 00:00:37,210
could also create a split test and

21
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:37,899
also have

22
00:00:37,939 --> 00:00:40,950
conditional logic based upon these

23
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:45,250
right there so let's just go to do

24
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:46,500
see if they

25
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:52,280
have a new page test test and this

26
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:55,090
is again where you can select the

27
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:55,460
style

28
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,939
sheet I'm just going to use

29
00:00:57,939 --> 00:01:00,490
default but if I wanted to use a

30
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,200
style sheet I created

31
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,700
you know over here for a client or

32
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:07,280
a certain funnel type that's right

33
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:07,670
there

34
00:01:07,719 --> 00:01:09,359
you could have selected it now

35
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:11,609
let's go to edit and we're just

36
00:01:11,709 --> 00:01:12,180
going to build a

37
00:01:12,219 --> 00:01:15,180
quick like headline sub headline

38
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:17,469
and slap a VSL so initially you're

39
00:01:17,469 --> 00:01:18,060
going to have

40
00:01:18,099 --> 00:01:19,959
to add a section so we're going to

41
00:01:19,959 --> 00:01:21,579
go blank section we could pick a

42
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:22,090
template if

43
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:23,650
we want but we're just going to go

44
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:26,150
blank section we're going to add a

45
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:27,859
row and let's

46
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,569
say we want to put a sub headline

47
00:01:29,569 --> 00:01:32,760
here so let's do you know eyebrow

48
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,500
fine technically an

49
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:37,040
eyebrow headline then what I want

50
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,859
to do is I'm going to add a let's

51
00:01:38,969 --> 00:01:39,480
add a little

52
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:45,239
headline right there this is our

53
00:01:45,409 --> 00:01:49,680
big line and I don't like that

54
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,920
font so let's

55
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:53,980
override everything with these

56
00:01:54,269 --> 00:01:59,569
three dots let's do pick something

57
00:01:59,569 --> 00:02:01,409
random poppins

58
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:03,650
yeah there you go I want to make

59
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:05,250
it extra bold to make it a big

60
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:06,659
headline I also

61
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,669
don't like this spacing here so

62
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:10,590
I'm going to shrink that spacing

63
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,039
on the headline and

64
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:12,960
I think there's a little too

65
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,919
spacing with the eye too much

66
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:14,539
spacing with the

67
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,020
eyebrow too so I'm going to pull

68
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:19,250
that there pull that there cool I

69
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:19,800
don't like the

70
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,530
spacing at the bottom too so a lot

71
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:22,699
of times you're going to be

72
00:02:22,789 --> 00:02:23,479
playing with like

73
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,979
padding and stuff like that as you

74
00:02:24,979 --> 00:02:27,360
add elements but you'll get you'll

75
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,280
get used to

76
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,389
toggle in between that let's do

77
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:34,490
this is a sub headline that

78
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:40,719
supports the big design above

79
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:48,110
all right let's toggle that up a

80
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:51,189
bit hmm looks a little too close

81
00:02:51,229 --> 00:02:52,099
so you know I made everything a

82
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:55,349
little too close so let's go five

83
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:01,479
below to a five above five and

84
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:02,719
that looks pretty

85
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:04,780
clean there we go so a nice even

86
00:03:04,969 --> 00:03:07,469
spacing with the padding on the

87
00:03:07,469 --> 00:03:08,469
headline looks

88
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,400
pretty good now what I'm going to

89
00:03:10,409 --> 00:03:12,740
do is I'm going to add a VSL so

90
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:14,229
let's go video

91
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,400
here tons of spacing at the top of

92
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,280
it I don't like that let's pull

93
00:03:18,289 --> 00:03:19,159
that up some

94
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,919
more and I also want to make the

95
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:24,319
VSL smaller the actual video

96
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:25,400
itself so what I'm

97
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:27,280
going to do is I can't change it

98
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,590
on this level but I can shrink the

99
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:30,560
entire row this

100
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:33,319
is why I made the row essentially

101
00:03:33,389 --> 00:03:37,060
its own element that's why I did

102
00:03:37,189 --> 00:03:38,759
not sorry that's why I did not put

103
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:39,020
the video

104
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,430
here within this row I made a new

105
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:44,050
row for this video because then on

106
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:45,240
the row column

107
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,810
or in the row settings I can sit

108
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:48,449
here and shrink the width of the

109
00:03:48,449 --> 00:03:50,060
entire row and change the actual

110
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:53,330
sizing of the video so let's do

111
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:58,460
that there and we can add a

112
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:03,819
another row toss a button here

113
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:07,340
so much padding on it by default I

114
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:11,169
don't like that we also have some

115
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,210
weird margin on the actual button

116
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:16,439
element itself there we go looking

117
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:19,060
good now this is obviously a very

118
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:21,699
ugly page guys but I'm showing

119
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:23,660
you you know how quick and easy it

120
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,529
is to uh you know spin something

121
00:04:25,529 --> 00:04:27,209
up even like all right we have

122
00:04:27,259 --> 00:04:29,620
a lot of kind of spacing between

123
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:31,910
the actual video and the

124
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:34,930
sub-headline so let's find out

125
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:35,680
where

126
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,639
there's some padding we can shrink

127
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:39,600
all right we can shrink that there

128
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:41,639
shrink that there

129
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,410
there we go and let's say we just

130
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:48,300
want to change the background for

131
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,350
whatever reason here

132
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:52,139
let's say we want to add a

133
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:55,800
gradient let's do that so let's do

134
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,579
this side of the gradient

135
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,899
feel like red or something see

136
00:05:00,899 --> 00:05:04,250
this side of white looks terrible

137
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,600
but that's how fast you can spin

138
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,139
something up right um so yeah

139
00:05:08,149 --> 00:05:09,930
that's essentially I just want to

140
00:05:09,949 --> 00:05:11,730
make a quick video five ten

141
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:12,360
minutes

142
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,209
going over just literally the

143
00:05:14,769 --> 00:05:16,149
hierarchy of everything and it's a

144
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,699
lot of just playing around with

145
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:18,220
spacing too

146
00:05:18,259 --> 00:05:19,720
like even here like all right you

147
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,110
know it's a little bit too much

148
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:22,569
padding at the top so let's

149
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,310
like try to shrink this a little

150
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:25,819
bit to like ten there we go we

151
00:05:25,819 --> 00:05:27,459
pulled it above the fold a little

152
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,910
bit and then let's go to mobile so

153
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:32,680
mobile we want to obviously shrink

154
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,860
so if you want to change the

155
00:05:35,899 --> 00:05:38,089
text you go to button style here

156
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:40,410
oh actually sorry mobile you just

157
00:05:40,529 --> 00:05:42,579
go down here button styles on

158
00:05:42,579 --> 00:05:42,920
desktop

159
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,740
all right let's shrink that there

160
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,339
a little bit let's make the big

161
00:05:46,339 --> 00:05:48,879
headline bigger on mobile so we'll

162
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:48,980
go

163
00:05:49,019 --> 00:05:51,000
there make sure you're toggling on

164
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:54,399
this big headline let's shrink the

165
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:56,680
line spacing a little bit

166
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:02,810
and there you go uh so if you want

167
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:05,970
to go and edit a pop-up you click

168
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:08,480
show pop-up you can see it on

169
00:06:08,819 --> 00:06:11,120
mobile and desktop so you go here

170
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,399
column add a headline right enter

171
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:18,879
your info below and then from

172
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:19,149
there just

173
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,550
like i showed you guys in another

174
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:22,079
step we start to just layer on our

175
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:24,399
input fields and everything and

176
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:28,319
slap another button on down there

177
00:06:28,569 --> 00:06:31,750
but i would have to make sure that

178
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:34,319
i change this to open pop-up

179
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,480
if i were to do a pop-up so that

180
00:06:36,569 --> 00:06:38,680
is just a quick one quick build

181
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:41,100
obviously again it's very ugly but

182
00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:42,040
if you want to start from scratch,

183
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:42,860
that's what you got to do.

184
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:43,300
Peace.
