1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:02,790
All right what's up everybody so

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:05,549
real quick i just wanted to go

3
00:00:05,559 --> 00:00:08,019
over some of the templates here

4
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:09,789
so i'm just gonna do like a quick

5
00:00:09,789 --> 00:00:11,640
sweep of them but again these are

6
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,560
in 2.0 um so starting with

7
00:00:14,609 --> 00:00:15,810
the call funnel here so we have

8
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:17,219
our confirmation page and then we

9
00:00:17,219 --> 00:00:18,469
have our vsl page i'll open up

10
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:20,350
these individually uh just make

11
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:22,019
sure you know you go in here and

12
00:00:22,019 --> 00:00:23,690
you know rename stuff change

13
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,359
the urls whenever you go live hit

14
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:26,920
live and then hide the uh lovely

15
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,399
click funnels badge you can

16
00:00:28,449 --> 00:00:30,289
add your tracking code there for

17
00:00:30,289 --> 00:00:32,310
whatever ad platform you choose to

18
00:00:32,368 --> 00:00:33,570
do so um to utilize this

19
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,409
on but yeah basically here

20
00:00:35,409 --> 00:00:37,509
anything can be edited okay now

21
00:00:37,509 --> 00:00:39,179
this is just like our best

22
00:00:39,189 --> 00:00:40,219
practices on

23
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:41,909
these templates and the ones that

24
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,469
we've seen work the best so a lot

25
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:45,240
of the spacing is very strong now

26
00:00:45,289 --> 00:00:46,359
obviously as you add more words

27
00:00:46,509 --> 00:00:47,380
and stuff or you start to add

28
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:48,630
images and different elements

29
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:49,240
you're

30
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:50,390
going to want to test live on

31
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:51,700
different devices like i don't

32
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:53,340
know why people sometimes whenever

33
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:55,020
they're launching a funnel uh and

34
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:56,700
they're editing mobile they only

35
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,479
use like the mobile editor here

36
00:00:58,539 --> 00:00:59,899
and they don't actually like look

37
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:01,229
at the freaking link on their

38
00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:02,340
phone and see like oh that

39
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:02,880
actually

40
00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:04,280
looks good or that looks bad right

41
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,689
so like make sure you're actually

42
00:01:05,689 --> 00:01:07,359
like looking at these pages live

43
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:09,760
especially before they go live um

44
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,069
as you edit them right so each one

45
00:01:12,069 --> 00:01:14,000
here is uh you know very very

46
00:01:14,049 --> 00:01:15,370
simple right so some of the stuff

47
00:01:15,739 --> 00:01:16,769
here i tell you what to

48
00:01:16,769 --> 00:01:18,370
essentially like write and you

49
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:18,890
know like

50
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:20,299
here's a section talking about

51
00:01:20,299 --> 00:01:21,760
like articulating the problems

52
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,299
that your customer experiences

53
00:01:23,349 --> 00:01:24,920
articulating how you solve the

54
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,680
problem why your system works and

55
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,060
stuff like that break down your

56
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:29,599
deliverables add some case studies

57
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:31,030
so if you see these these are like

58
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:32,540
videos that you can add

59
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:34,340
and um if sorry if some of mine

60
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:36,189
are in here uh you could just go

61
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:38,599
there and delete them um basically

62
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:40,170
yeah yeah so some of them will

63
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:42,099
potentially have some of our case

64
00:01:42,099 --> 00:01:43,739
study videos there so you can

65
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:46,540
delete all this stuff like this

66
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:49,430
and add your own but um anyways so

67
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:51,790
also have some faqs things like

68
00:01:51,989 --> 00:01:54,000
that and then um also most of

69
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,159
these like this one here has a

70
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,709
pop-up for example so you'll want

71
00:01:58,719 --> 00:01:58,980
to go

72
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:01,269
here and embed your own type form

73
00:02:01,269 --> 00:02:03,469
if you if you're utilizing type

74
00:02:03,469 --> 00:02:05,640
form there and then just like

75
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:05,879
delete

76
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:07,069
stuff here like some things as

77
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:08,288
well as you edit you'll see like

78
00:02:08,288 --> 00:02:09,520
you know delete this element

79
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:09,740
before

80
00:02:09,788 --> 00:02:11,159
publishing right so uh just make

81
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:12,979
sure to follow those instructions

82
00:02:12,979 --> 00:02:15,039
and then our confirmation page

83
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:16,860
right here too same structure i

84
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,610
tell you you know here's these

85
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:20,509
video topics and faqs you want to

86
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:20,740
add

87
00:02:20,789 --> 00:02:22,409
in down here if you choose to do

88
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:24,310
so that on your confirmation page

89
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,229
and then the other one that i want

90
00:02:26,289 --> 00:02:26,979
to go over

91
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:29,580
is the low ticket and challenge

92
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:32,280
funnel so this is definitely the

93
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:36,300
most intense funnel that we have

94
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:36,659
in here

95
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:38,740
the most intense template so this

96
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:40,879
is one that we launched for one of

97
00:02:40,939 --> 00:02:43,000
our clients and this performs

98
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:45,599
super super super well um so i did

99
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,439
leave on this template some of the

100
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:50,620
images that we utilize so if

101
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,039
you want to have like a graphic

102
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,740
designer replicate them like this

103
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,379
product box matrix and this stuff

104
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:55,680
like

105
00:02:55,729 --> 00:02:57,729
that you can do so um and then i

106
00:02:57,729 --> 00:02:59,860
also left some of the copy down

107
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:01,879
here for you guys to look at

108
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:03,629
and uh same with some stuff like

109
00:03:03,629 --> 00:03:05,520
this some of these little images

110
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,979
and whatnot now like i said this

111
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:08,180
one

112
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:09,969
is no no joke like a challenge

113
00:03:09,969 --> 00:03:11,750
funnel of this scale and a low

114
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,860
ticket product funnel this can be

115
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:14,060
utilized

116
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:15,770
for both is a beast right there's

117
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:17,319
a lot of stuff a lot of copy a lot

118
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:19,139
of sections and feel free to add

119
00:03:19,189 --> 00:03:20,680
and take away some but i left a

120
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:22,289
lot of the copy here so you guys

121
00:03:22,289 --> 00:03:24,180
can read through and see like what

122
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:24,479
i did

123
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:26,240
for each section so that is you

124
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,939
know intentional there and a

125
00:03:27,939 --> 00:03:29,949
couple things too if you see this

126
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:32,250
uh this highlight this is actually

127
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:33,990
a custom uh code so i'm gonna show

128
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:35,360
you guys what to do for that but

129
00:03:35,409 --> 00:03:36,479
basically it's a strikethrough

130
00:03:36,629 --> 00:03:38,990
that turns gold it's pretty cool

131
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:41,240
um not a lot of people you know

132
00:03:41,409 --> 00:03:42,639
do a lot of custom stuff with

133
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,219
click funnels we love doing it so

134
00:03:44,219 --> 00:03:45,919
what you guys can do for that

135
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:48,009
is go to show code here and

136
00:03:48,009 --> 00:03:50,020
basically all i did was i just

137
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:52,300
asked gbt i'm like hey i'm using

138
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:52,520
click

139
00:03:52,569 --> 00:03:54,900
funnels 2.0 i want to make this

140
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,080
strikethrough a highlight can you

141
00:03:57,139 --> 00:03:59,500
give me the css code for that so

142
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:01,229
all you want to do if you want to

143
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,139
change like the gold to something

144
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,900
else just find the color code you

145
00:04:04,949 --> 00:04:06,710
want to do here and just change

146
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:08,550
this this background color and

147
00:04:08,699 --> 00:04:11,080
that's really it so then if again

148
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:11,300
if you

149
00:04:11,349 --> 00:04:13,219
want to add some sort of uh code

150
00:04:13,219 --> 00:04:14,939
some of these will by default

151
00:04:15,099 --> 00:04:17,740
already have uh some standard

152
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:18,000
event

153
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:20,490
code on there like uh let's see if

154
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:22,769
the footer code has any i don't

155
00:04:22,899 --> 00:04:25,139
think so no but like this one here

156
00:04:25,189 --> 00:04:27,029
we made like a glowing button um i

157
00:04:27,029 --> 00:04:28,709
don't even think it's active

158
00:04:28,709 --> 00:04:30,310
though to be honest but um you

159
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:30,819
want to

160
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:31,790
use uh utilize some of that code

161
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:32,670
you can go for it it's a little

162
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:33,860
bit more advanced if you have any

163
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:35,600
questions on custom code just like

164
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,220
let me know um transparently i am

165
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:38,629
not a coder i just use chat gbt

166
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:40,420
and it tells you exactly what to

167
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,100
do so uh you just like paste it in

168
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,470
there and it's good to go

169
00:04:43,529 --> 00:04:45,189
so yeah the low ticket one will be

170
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:46,819
a beast um you know there's some

171
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:48,579
elements here like we have to do

172
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,329
a lot of custom like formatting

173
00:04:50,329 --> 00:04:52,089
like even this image behind you

174
00:04:52,089 --> 00:04:54,000
right you have to like try to find

175
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,220
it

176
00:04:54,269 --> 00:04:55,370
right right there if you want to

177
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:56,480
edit the image you have to play

178
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,740
with the padding to make sure it

179
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:57,870
looks

180
00:04:57,949 --> 00:04:59,980
good and we like edited these

181
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,350
sections out here um so yeah it's

182
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:04,839
a beast but it converts very well

183
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:05,149
so

184
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:07,310
um yeah then we have the checkout

185
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:09,310
page for that one too an oto page

186
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,519
here for you guys

187
00:05:10,569 --> 00:05:12,790
and a scheduler page and then for

188
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:15,079
the webinar one right here very

189
00:05:15,139 --> 00:05:17,329
similar to the call funnel one

190
00:05:17,339 --> 00:05:17,500
there

191
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:18,560
