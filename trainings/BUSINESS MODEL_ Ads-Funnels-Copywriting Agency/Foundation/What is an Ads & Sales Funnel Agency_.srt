1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:01,320
What's up, guys?

2
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:02,370
My name is Evan Siech.

3
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:04,059
I run an agency called Sell More

4
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:04,839
Online, where

5
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,320
we focus on basically helping

6
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:07,780
people make more money online

7
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:09,099
through advertising.

8
00:00:09,099 --> 00:00:09,550
So

9
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:11,240
we focus on paid ads and funnels,

10
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:12,679
and that's our main bread and

11
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:13,339
butter.

12
00:00:13,339 --> 00:00:15,000
So in this whole

13
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:16,420
course here, we're just going to

14
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:17,679
be going over from A to Z, what

15
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:18,559
it's like to run an

16
00:00:18,739 --> 00:00:19,640
advertising agency, how to

17
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:20,969
actually do it successfully, what

18
00:00:20,989 --> 00:00:21,940
clients you should look

19
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,699
for, what different types of

20
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:25,739
funnels are, what some different

21
00:00:25,739 --> 00:00:27,359
types of ad examples are,

22
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:28,710
how to make winning ads, make

23
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,269
winning funnels, all this stuff

24
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:30,969
from A to Z, we're

25
00:00:31,219 --> 00:00:32,250
going to be diving into it.

26
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:33,490
And of course, we got to start

27
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:34,979
right now with what the heck

28
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:36,859
is an advertising agency that

29
00:00:36,859 --> 00:00:38,590
focuses on ads and funnels to

30
00:00:38,689 --> 00:00:39,640
begin with.

31
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:40,979
So, you know, the

32
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:42,939
whole like digital marketing

33
00:00:42,939 --> 00:00:44,789
agency or SMMA like sphere is

34
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:46,689
essentially just very, very

35
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:47,679
broad, right?

36
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:48,780
It's a very broad term.

37
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:50,159
I do social media marketing.

38
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:50,960
What we focus on

39
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:52,890
primarily is the paid ad side.

40
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:54,969
So really, we honestly just focus

41
00:00:54,969 --> 00:00:56,560
on like YouTube and

42
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:57,549
meta ads right now.

43
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:58,960
We will touch like Google, TikTok,

44
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,320
you know, different platforms.

45
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:00,460
We

46
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,969
even do like LinkedIn and Snapchat

47
00:01:01,969 --> 00:01:03,359
at times, but primarily we make

48
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:04,359
the most money for our

49
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:05,930
clients and us off of Facebook

50
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:06,340
ads.

51
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:08,140
So Facebook and Instagram as well.

52
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:09,540
So meta and YouTube.

53
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:11,689
But primarily what we focus on is

54
00:01:11,689 --> 00:01:13,980
just driving leads, driving book

55
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:15,640
calls, driving purchases,

56
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:17,109
you know, depending on what type

57
00:01:17,109 --> 00:01:18,579
of funnel we're doing through paid

58
00:01:18,629 --> 00:01:18,950
ads.

59
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:20,030
That's our main thing.

60
00:01:20,219 --> 00:01:21,950
And for us, you know, you'll

61
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:24,040
basically look at a lot of people

62
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,760
who are just like media buyers,

63
00:01:26,019 --> 00:01:26,459
right?

64
00:01:26,689 --> 00:01:28,480
The whole old school like media

65
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,620
buyer is dead.

66
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:31,560
Now, what media buyers essentially

67
00:01:31,969 --> 00:01:32,310
are just

68
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:33,909
people that click buttons and buy

69
00:01:33,909 --> 00:01:34,359
media.

70
00:01:34,359 --> 00:01:35,480
So they buy space on these

71
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:37,049
different social platforms and

72
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,519
everything like that.

73
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:40,340
And that skill is just not needed

74
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:41,019
anymore.

75
00:01:41,019 --> 00:01:42,680
What you need to do if you're

76
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:42,760
going

77
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,010
to run a advertising agency like I

78
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:47,250
do that focuses on ads and funnels

79
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:49,359
is to really become an expert

80
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:50,920
marketer from A to Z.

81
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,840
You have to be able to make good

82
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,069
ads, make good funnels, come up

83
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:55,500
with different

84
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,079
messaging buckets and ideas to

85
00:01:57,079 --> 00:01:58,709
craft those ads around and craft

86
00:01:58,709 --> 00:02:00,079
those funnels around.

87
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:00,980
You have to make

88
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:02,750
actual good offers on the front

89
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:03,219
end.

90
00:02:03,219 --> 00:02:05,180
So people who don't know you don't

91
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:06,700
like you and don't trust you

92
00:02:06,969 --> 00:02:08,020
yet see your ad and are like,

93
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:08,669
okay, cool.

94
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:10,008
That's an offer that I would like

95
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:10,860
to learn more about.

96
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:12,479
And of course you need to be able

97
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:14,199
to actually warm those leads up

98
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:15,379
through different marketing

99
00:02:15,379 --> 00:02:15,759
methods

100
00:02:15,939 --> 00:02:16,840
before they actually show up to a

101
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,319
sales call.

102
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:18,219
So you can actually sell them

103
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:18,800
properly.

104
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,099
So

105
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,080
that's essentially what it is.

106
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,960
So from A to Z, what you're going

107
00:02:22,979 --> 00:02:24,370
to be doing on, you know,

108
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:25,830
a day to day basis, we're going to

109
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:27,189
get into it much more detail in a

110
00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:28,979
little bit here, but essentially

111
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:30,080
you're helping people run ads

112
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:30,659
profitably.

113
00:02:30,659 --> 00:02:31,900
You're going to be making landing

114
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,300
pages, making funnels.

115
00:02:33,449 --> 00:02:34,629
You're going to be helping with

116
00:02:34,629 --> 00:02:35,759
emails on the backend too.

117
00:02:35,849 --> 00:02:37,479
Pretty much everything in the paid

118
00:02:37,669 --> 00:02:39,169
acquisition system from click to

119
00:02:39,169 --> 00:02:41,030
close besides taking sales calls.

120
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:42,379
If you actually want to do

121
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,020
this right, you should be focusing

122
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:45,449
on, you should be helping your

123
00:02:45,449 --> 00:02:47,259
clients with, it shouldn't just be

124
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:48,960
you sitting down, looking at the

125
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,550
ads manager for a couple hours a

126
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:52,520
freaking day, clicking buttons and

127
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,300
all that stuff.

128
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,979
No, you're directing the creative.

129
00:02:55,069 --> 00:02:56,520
You're directing the angles of the

130
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:56,830
ads.

131
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:57,580
You're directing

132
00:02:57,729 --> 00:02:58,889
the copy on the landing page.

133
00:02:58,889 --> 00:03:00,150
You're directing what type of

134
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,599
funnel, what the funnel looks

135
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:01,969
like.

136
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:03,750
You're making landing pages.

137
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,990
You're building backend email

138
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:06,280
flows and everything like that.

139
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:07,370
And you're seeing where the

140
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:08,689
bottlenecks are in the funnel and

141
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:10,080
in the paid acquisition system.

142
00:03:10,259 --> 00:03:11,860
And you're going all hell bent on

143
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,000
that to fix that.

144
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,699
So that's what an advertising

145
00:03:14,699 --> 00:03:15,500
agency is

146
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:17,139
in the modern day that focuses on

147
00:03:17,139 --> 00:03:18,639
ads and funnels like we do.

148
00:03:18,689 --> 00:03:19,909
So without further ado,

149
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:20,960
let's dive into some more modules.
