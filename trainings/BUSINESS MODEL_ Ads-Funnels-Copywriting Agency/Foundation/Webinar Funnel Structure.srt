1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,870
All right.

2
00:00:01,889 --> 00:00:04,000
So we're just going to dive into a

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,960
webinar funnel that we're running

4
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:06,820
right now for

5
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:09,050
a client just so you guys can kind

6
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:11,179
of see what exactly we got going

7
00:00:11,189 --> 00:00:12,339
on with that.

8
00:00:12,339 --> 00:00:13,859
So let me sift

9
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:15,160
through all of the fun, fun

10
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:16,190
campaigns we have.

11
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:17,719
So right here is a webinar funnel

12
00:00:17,719 --> 00:00:18,579
we're running.

13
00:00:18,809 --> 00:00:20,760
We have basically these campaigns.

14
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,510
We have some that we turned off,

15
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:23,739
some we turned back on.

16
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:25,039
And this set here is a new set

17
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:25,719
that we did.

18
00:00:25,719 --> 00:00:27,140
We did launch it with some more

19
00:00:27,149 --> 00:00:28,280
rigid messaging.

20
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:28,780
So

21
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:30,960
basically they're selling a TikTok

22
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,890
shop offer and we're trying to go

23
00:00:32,909 --> 00:00:34,820
instead of helping people start

24
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:36,100
TikTok shop, they're trying to

25
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,350
help people just do it better.

26
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:38,609
So that's essentially this set

27
00:00:38,609 --> 00:00:39,000
here,

28
00:00:39,159 --> 00:00:40,170
same with these statics that we're

29
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:40,579
running.

30
00:00:40,659 --> 00:00:41,509
So this is a static ad set.

31
00:00:41,509 --> 00:00:42,159
As you can see,

32
00:00:42,289 --> 00:00:43,579
it's doing really well.

33
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:45,380
And we're going to be scaling this

34
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:47,259
up here pretty aggressively here

35
00:00:47,259 --> 00:00:47,520
soon.

36
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:47,820
But

37
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:49,850
anyways, if we look at the ad

38
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:52,399
campaign, we have our traditional

39
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:54,820
CBO set up here and we have

40
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:55,170
dynamic

41
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:57,479
creative on the ad level.

42
00:00:57,479 --> 00:00:59,899
And if we go into here, we have

43
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,359
six videos with a couple of

44
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:03,420
different

45
00:01:03,619 --> 00:01:04,450
pieces of ad copy.

46
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:05,719
Whenever it's like a free

47
00:01:05,719 --> 00:01:07,560
masterclass or something, first

48
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,340
off a webinar,

49
00:01:08,469 --> 00:01:10,060
we'd like to frame it like it's a

50
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:11,730
masterclass or a workshop or a

51
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:12,739
virtual event.

52
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:14,140
We don't call it a,

53
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:14,980
you know, we don't call it a

54
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:16,030
webinar like, Hey, show up to our

55
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:16,430
webinar.

56
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:16,909
Right.

57
00:01:17,489 --> 00:01:18,650
Um, so we have one text, a piece

58
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:19,260
of body copy.

59
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:20,159
That's more selling me

60
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:21,000
opportunity.

61
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:21,519
Some more,

62
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,129
we have another one, uh, that

63
00:01:23,239 --> 00:01:24,689
really just like slams what's

64
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:26,200
going, you know, going to be

65
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:26,459
covered

66
00:01:26,569 --> 00:01:28,209
on the actual masterclass itself.

67
00:01:28,209 --> 00:01:29,640
And usually I do like to do a call

68
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,569
out here on these.

69
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,140
I see these

70
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:32,430
types of copies do much better.

71
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:33,769
Whenever in the headline, you're

72
00:01:33,769 --> 00:01:35,079
actually calling out like, Hey,

73
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:35,870
it's a free class.

74
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:37,129
Sign up, uh, headlines, same

75
00:01:37,129 --> 00:01:37,510
thing.

76
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:39,379
Pretty step-by-step, uh, or pretty

77
00:01:39,579 --> 00:01:40,920
straightforward on these.

78
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,150
So free live TikTok shop

79
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,069
masterclass, learn TikTok shop for

80
00:01:44,069 --> 00:01:44,519
free,

81
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:45,099
right?

82
00:01:45,099 --> 00:01:46,260
Stuff like that.

83
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:47,840
And then if we go over to the

84
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,019
actual page itself, we love having

85
00:01:50,019 --> 00:01:50,579
again,

86
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:51,890
free TikTok shop masterclass.

87
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:53,099
We have a pretty catchy headline

88
00:01:53,099 --> 00:01:53,400
here.

89
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,579
We've been rotating between

90
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,689
and we have the time and date.

91
00:01:56,689 --> 00:01:58,069
We have a nice VSL.

92
00:01:58,069 --> 00:02:00,019
Sometimes we'll have a VSL on

93
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:01,219
these pages.

94
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:02,219
Sometimes we won't.

95
00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:03,689
And then about the masterclass,

96
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:05,420
here's what you're going to learn.

97
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:05,939
So we tell them

98
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:07,390
what they're going to learn.

99
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:08,780
We flex the instructor a bit or

100
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:10,240
who's actually teaching it.

101
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:10,659
Then we of

102
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:11,909
course go into some case studies

103
00:02:11,909 --> 00:02:13,030
of like, Hey, people actually

104
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:13,729
using the system.

105
00:02:13,729 --> 00:02:14,539
We're going to talk

106
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:15,789
about on the webinar and teach

107
00:02:15,789 --> 00:02:16,990
you, um, here's some of the

108
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:17,490
results.

109
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:18,900
And then here's actually where he

110
00:02:19,099 --> 00:02:20,430
taught his, uh, his grandma how to

111
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:21,870
run TikTok shop, which is kind of

112
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:22,229
cool.

113
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:23,120
Then I like to have a

114
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:24,949
session, a section of, you know,

115
00:02:24,949 --> 00:02:26,300
what is the class again?

116
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:26,969
When is it?

117
00:02:26,969 --> 00:02:28,379
Why should you attend?

118
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:29,729
And then some FAQs.

119
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:31,680
Then from there, we just have a

120
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,360
pop-up.

121
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,020
If you secure the spot,

122
00:02:34,219 --> 00:02:35,650
then we have our confirmation

123
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:37,460
page, which these are just there

124
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,159
to essentially pre-frame some

125
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:39,699
more.

126
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:41,460
So they're there to, uh, break

127
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:43,389
down like, Hey, who you are, uh,

128
00:02:43,389 --> 00:02:45,539
how much can I realistically make

129
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:46,639
with TikTok shop?

130
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:48,259
Do I have to make content or do I

131
00:02:48,259 --> 00:02:49,340
use UGC creators?

132
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:50,699
I have no idea what TikTok

133
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,310
job is right.

134
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:52,590
That's if somebody obviously on

135
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:53,810
the front end of the ads, we're

136
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:54,710
not really targeting

137
00:02:54,939 --> 00:02:56,240
this type of person, but if they

138
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:57,759
do slip through here, we at least

139
00:02:57,819 --> 00:02:59,340
have a resource in a video for

140
00:02:59,539 --> 00:03:00,030
them there.

141
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,110
So love this one too.

142
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:01,719
It's free.

143
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,210
So am I seriously going to learn

144
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:03,979
anything?

145
00:03:03,979 --> 00:03:04,639
Uh,

146
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:05,699
what are you going to teach?

147
00:03:05,699 --> 00:03:06,900
We also break that down there.

148
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,810
And then how fast can you see

149
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:09,319
results?

150
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:10,729
Is TikTok shop a quick fad or is

151
00:03:10,729 --> 00:03:11,240
it dead?

152
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,430
And I love this one too.

153
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:14,039
This is why we made it super big,

154
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,240
but will you be pitching anything?

155
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,580
So I love having that.

156
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:19,370
I love framing people, right?

157
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:19,979
Be like, Hey,

158
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:21,479
we're going to give you a ton of

159
00:03:21,699 --> 00:03:23,099
value, but to be transparent in

160
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:24,900
turn and, you know, in return for

161
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:26,210
this free value I'm giving you and

162
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:27,330
everything we're going to be

163
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:28,840
covering on the masterclass here,

164
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,569
I am going to have a pitch for

165
00:03:30,569 --> 00:03:32,280
some of you that want to move

166
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:34,020
forward, uh, with just

167
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:34,520
accelerating

168
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:35,889
your results here and really

169
00:03:36,229 --> 00:03:37,439
taking this thing seriously.

170
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:39,080
So, uh, then of course we got more

171
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,770
case studies and some FAQs on

172
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,330
there.

173
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:43,080
And then I like to have a button

174
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,879
here that actually confirms

175
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,740
the event on their Gmail, uh,

176
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:48,840
calendar if they do have Google.

177
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,080
So that is our confirmation page,

178
00:03:51,219 --> 00:03:53,250
uh, there for the webinar series.

179
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,189
And on the backend for a webinar,

180
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:56,879
what we typically like to do

181
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:58,080
is we'll of course run them

182
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,349
through an email series.

183
00:03:59,349 --> 00:04:01,169
Now, typically this is seven to 10

184
00:04:01,169 --> 00:04:01,599
emails.

185
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:03,500
We also do some more that's manual

186
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,360
as we get closer to the webinar.

187
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,150
So about three days out,

188
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:09,469
we're going to start to send

189
00:04:09,819 --> 00:04:11,129
manual newsletters and manual SMS

190
00:04:11,139 --> 00:04:12,639
blasts, just reminding people,

191
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,150
giving value, like pre-framing

192
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,610
them a little bit more, talking

193
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,360
more about what's actually coming

194
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:17,519
up.

195
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,660
And, um, I also like doing a text

196
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,730
that is a little bit more on the,

197
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:23,279
uh, the interesting and kind of

198
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,009
cheeky side, but I like to send

199
00:04:25,009 --> 00:04:26,939
out a text that says, Hey, this is

200
00:04:26,939 --> 00:04:27,389
Kate.

201
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:28,639
Like for these guys,

202
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:29,540
his name's Cade.

203
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:31,290
So we did, Hey, this is Kate here.

204
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:33,600
Um, just finishing up the deck for

205
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,240
the master

206
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:35,379
class on Wednesday.

207
00:04:35,379 --> 00:04:36,939
Just wanted to see if you had any

208
00:04:36,939 --> 00:04:38,639
questions or anything you wanted

209
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:39,279
me to weave in

210
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,819
there, shoot me a reply back and

211
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:41,500
let me know.

212
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,829
That's super effective.

213
00:04:42,829 --> 00:04:44,000
We get a lot of replies,

214
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,199
a lot of engagement, and it makes

215
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:46,160
it feel more personal.

216
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,379
And then also the high quality

217
00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:48,959
leads too.

218
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:50,750
I love to have them, uh, dial some

219
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:51,750
of these leads.

220
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:52,980
If they have a great sales team or

221
00:04:53,069 --> 00:04:53,689
a setting team,

222
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,100
I'll have the client dial the

223
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,610
opt-ins for the webinar, try to

224
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:58,480
make a connection with them.

225
00:04:58,610 --> 00:04:59,480
And, um, that's if you got a

226
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,560
hungry sales team and one that

227
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,920
actually likes to do their,

228
00:05:02,019 --> 00:05:03,240
do some dirty work and do their,

229
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,300
do their job properly.

230
00:05:04,329 --> 00:05:05,920
So that's the webinar structure.

231
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,160
Um,

232
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,339
like I said, it's opt-in to

233
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:08,339
confirmation page.

234
00:05:08,339 --> 00:05:09,839
We have backend email flows.

235
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:10,170
We also

236
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:11,439
will hit them with content

237
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:12,959
remarketing as well to pre-frame

238
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:14,370
them before the actual webinar

239
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:14,800
occurs.

240
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:15,670
And we try to get a lot of

241
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:16,319
questions.

242
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:18,199
They need answered about the

243
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:18,959
opportunity,

244
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,430
about the system, build up that

245
00:05:20,649 --> 00:05:21,899
know, like, and trust build up

246
00:05:21,899 --> 00:05:23,360
credibility before the actual

247
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,189
webinar occurs.

248
00:05:24,189 --> 00:05:25,480
So when they show up, they're

249
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,040
essentially ready to get value,

250
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:28,300
but they're more primed for a

251
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,519
pitch and more prime to move

252
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:30,160
forward.

253
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,600
And then on the webinar,

254
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,910
we'll either go direct to

255
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:34,810
checkout, or we'll try to book

256
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:36,240
sales calls from the actual

257
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:36,639
webinar.

258
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:37,889
Usually if it's a higher price

259
00:05:37,889 --> 00:05:39,300
product or service, we'll book

260
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:39,939
calls.

261
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:41,370
If it's like one,

262
00:05:41,579 --> 00:05:43,430
two, three, $4,000, we'll

263
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:44,800
sometimes try a direct checkout,

264
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,839
especially if it's like a thousand

265
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,420
dollars or $500, we'll go straight

266
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:50,079
into a direct checkout.

267
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:51,899
And then we'll stay on there for

268
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:52,000
the

269
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:53,910
webinar, um, for about 30 minutes,

270
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,399
you know, towards the end, he's

271
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:56,480
like, Hey, the link is

272
00:05:56,649 --> 00:05:58,850
in the description or the chat and

273
00:05:58,850 --> 00:05:59,779
zoom here.

274
00:05:59,779 --> 00:06:02,240
So if you have any questions now,

275
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,279
you know, let me know,

276
00:06:03,449 --> 00:06:04,509
like, let's, let's answer these

277
00:06:04,509 --> 00:06:04,810
live.

278
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:06,069
I'll pull you up on stage here.

279
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,279
You can ask your question live

280
00:06:07,459 --> 00:06:08,839
and we'll break things down.

281
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:10,589
Um, you know, the opportunity is

282
00:06:10,589 --> 00:06:12,399
limited to whatever, 10 spots,

283
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,100
15 spots.

284
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,250
And you know, we have a fast

285
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,420
action bonus where you get an

286
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,879
extra one-on-one call with me if

287
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:18,379
you buy here on the webinar.

288
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,879
So again, I'm going to stay on

289
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,980
here for 30 to 45 minutes with you

290
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:22,240
guys.

291
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:23,500
And we're just going to

292
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:25,259
essentially sit and I'll answer

293
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:26,720
your questions right there.

294
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,199
So

295
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,129
that's the structure of the

296
00:06:28,129 --> 00:06:28,790
webinar funnel.

297
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:29,790
And let me know if you guys have

298
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:30,399
any questions.
