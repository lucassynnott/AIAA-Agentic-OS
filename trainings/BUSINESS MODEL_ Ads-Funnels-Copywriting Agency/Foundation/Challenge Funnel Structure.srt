1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,120
All right.

2
00:00:02,209 --> 00:00:04,190
So going to break down a challenge

3
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,330
funnel that we had for a client.

4
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:07,400
So this is a paid

5
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:08,910
challenge funnel that we're

6
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:10,720
running and they essentially are

7
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:12,259
in the real estate niche.

8
00:00:12,259 --> 00:00:12,699
So

9
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:14,169
they basically teach people to

10
00:00:14,439 --> 00:00:15,890
invest in multifamily real estate

11
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:17,160
and this is a paid challenge.

12
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:17,440
So we're

13
00:00:17,579 --> 00:00:18,929
selling tickets to a virtual

14
00:00:19,179 --> 00:00:19,440
event.

15
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,370
This is a three-day virtual event.

16
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:23,370
These guys are super

17
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:24,039
hungry.

18
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:25,629
So they actually run these

19
00:00:25,629 --> 00:00:26,440
bi-weekly.

20
00:00:26,539 --> 00:00:28,370
Now that is very, I have really

21
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:29,239
never worked

22
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:30,960
with any other client running paid

23
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:32,579
challenges that runs them at this

24
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:33,359
frequency.

25
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:34,060
It's actually

26
00:00:34,179 --> 00:00:35,210
crazy how they do this thing and

27
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,409
how they orchestrate it, but it

28
00:00:36,409 --> 00:00:37,070
works for them.

29
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:37,840
It gets the ROAS.

30
00:00:37,979 --> 00:00:39,520
Usually you run these on a, you

31
00:00:39,579 --> 00:00:41,490
know, every other month cadence or

32
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:43,920
once a quarter even, but yeah,

33
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:45,200
this is absolutely crazy.

34
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,530
These guys are, these guys are

35
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:47,020
killers.

36
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:48,590
So anyways, we have our campaign

37
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,460
with our two ad sets here.

38
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,539
So we have been running, by the

39
00:00:52,539 --> 00:00:54,030
way, on challenges.

40
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:55,380
We've been seeing

41
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:56,850
statics work really, really well

42
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:58,310
for challenge funnels across the

43
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:58,810
board.

44
00:00:58,960 --> 00:00:59,969
This is currently in August of

45
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:00,679
2025.

46
00:01:00,679 --> 00:01:02,689
So obviously things could change

47
00:01:02,689 --> 00:01:04,120
tomorrow, but

48
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,650
on the majority of our accounts,

49
00:01:05,859 --> 00:01:07,069
just keep in mind, statics are

50
00:01:07,069 --> 00:01:08,200
doing really well for challenge

51
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:08,700
funnels.

52
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,150
It's very interesting, driving a

53
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:11,400
lot more clicks of the page and

54
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,239
our longer form

55
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:12,640
pages.

56
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,780
I'm going to show you in a sec

57
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:15,129
here is doing more of the selling

58
00:01:15,129 --> 00:01:15,560
work.

59
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,219
So we have

60
00:01:16,359 --> 00:01:18,230
tested videos, but statics have

61
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:20,400
been consistently driving a really

62
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,939
good cost per result for us.

63
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:23,099
They do burn quicker.

64
00:01:23,099 --> 00:01:23,829
So we do have to spin them out

65
00:01:23,829 --> 00:01:25,760
more, but just keep that in mind.

66
00:01:25,859 --> 00:01:26,420
So we have

67
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:27,780
our CBO with our two interest

68
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:28,290
stacks.

69
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:29,829
If you are running statics right

70
00:01:29,829 --> 00:01:32,200
now in August of 2025 too,

71
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:34,769
I would suggest, you know, this

72
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:37,599
one here is a individual ad set.

73
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,109
So, or sorry, we have individual

74
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:44,579
ads as not dynamic creative.

75
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:44,579
Meta has been doing some very

76
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:44,579
weird stuff with, um, dynamic

77
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:44,579
creative

78
00:01:44,709 --> 00:01:47,079
sets with statics in particular.

79
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:49,129
Uh, just seeing a lot of weird

80
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:50,900
activity, a lot of things that are

81
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,629
getting like cut off and all this

82
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,450
weird stuff.

83
00:01:53,459 --> 00:01:55,040
You, if you're using dynamic

84
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,579
creative, even with the AI

85
00:01:56,709 --> 00:01:57,909
optimizations off.

86
00:01:57,909 --> 00:01:59,590
So what we do if we're running

87
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:02,650
statics, um, for, uh, basically

88
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,019
statics heavily on an ad

89
00:02:04,219 --> 00:02:05,099
set, uh, we will just do

90
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:06,450
individual ads like this instead

91
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:07,530
of dynamic creative.

92
00:02:07,609 --> 00:02:08,979
So, uh, and then of

93
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,900
course, if you go into the ad

94
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,169
itself, just make sure to turn off

95
00:02:13,259 --> 00:02:15,219
like this browser out on stuff,

96
00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:15,620
turn off

97
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:17,340
all the site links and things like

98
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:17,740
that.

99
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:19,360
So we're doing an early bird.

100
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,900
This set was for an early bird

101
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:21,909
discount for them.

102
00:02:21,909 --> 00:02:23,300
So we did make that apparent up

103
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:23,750
there.

104
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,379
If it's like a last minute deal,

105
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:25,939
we'll put last

106
00:02:26,069 --> 00:02:27,550
minute or put challenge starting

107
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,500
Thursday event, starting Thursday.

108
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,819
I don't always like to call

109
00:02:30,939 --> 00:02:31,849
this a challenge.

110
00:02:31,849 --> 00:02:33,389
We usually call it a live virtual

111
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:34,139
workshop.

112
00:02:34,139 --> 00:02:36,229
We call it a live event, um, stuff

113
00:02:36,379 --> 00:02:36,500
like

114
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:36,930
that.

115
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:38,569
And if we're doing a sale, we'll

116
00:02:38,569 --> 00:02:39,419
put this here.

117
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:40,770
If you're doing a sale for a

118
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:41,780
challenge funnel,

119
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:42,750
stay firm to it.

120
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:43,639
Don't flex it.

121
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:45,889
Like, don't just be, you know,

122
00:02:45,889 --> 00:02:48,259
have a dead, I have a timeframe

123
00:02:48,259 --> 00:02:48,580
for it.

124
00:02:48,699 --> 00:02:49,960
Like if you're going to be running

125
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,430
70% off for an early bird until

126
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:53,539
Friday, jack the price up then

127
00:02:53,539 --> 00:02:53,860
punish

128
00:02:53,979 --> 00:02:55,039
people that don't take action

129
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,289
because people will see that ad

130
00:02:56,289 --> 00:02:56,740
again.

131
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,180
And they think that your brand

132
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:58,740
is just flimsy.

133
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:00,280
They think your pricing is just

134
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,569
flimsy and that you're not

135
00:03:01,569 --> 00:03:02,580
truthful to your word

136
00:03:02,689 --> 00:03:03,379
in that sense.

137
00:03:03,379 --> 00:03:04,699
So that's what we like to do.

138
00:03:04,789 --> 00:03:06,259
Uh, we stick firm to that.

139
00:03:06,259 --> 00:03:08,490
So yeah, we have, you know,

140
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:09,639
even like all of these things, I

141
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:10,740
like to turn all these off.

142
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:12,500
I honestly didn't even see that

143
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:12,689
these

144
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:13,939
were hot in this set.

145
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,800
So meta still gets you sometimes,

146
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,539
but I like to turn most of these

147
00:03:17,539 --> 00:03:17,699
off.

148
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,310
Sometimes I'll keep overlays on.

149
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:20,569
Sometimes I'll keep visual

150
00:03:20,569 --> 00:03:21,780
touch-ups on.

151
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:22,740
Um, I usually turn ad

152
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,400
music off and I turn all this junk

153
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:25,979
off, but they always try to get

154
00:03:25,979 --> 00:03:27,930
you to, to basically, you know,

155
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,219
turn on their AI enhancements.

156
00:03:29,219 --> 00:03:30,259
Same with this thing, this

157
00:03:30,259 --> 00:03:31,139
suggested event.

158
00:03:31,139 --> 00:03:32,259
I turned this thing off as

159
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:32,659
well.

160
00:03:32,659 --> 00:03:34,129
And this is, of course they're

161
00:03:34,129 --> 00:03:34,830
using Hyros.

162
00:03:34,979 --> 00:03:37,860
So we have that in there, but, uh,

163
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:38,330
that's essentially

164
00:03:38,539 --> 00:03:39,930
what we're doing for the, the ad

165
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:40,500
itself.

166
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,960
So now if we go over here into the

167
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,490
funnel, so this is actually

168
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:46,139
starting, uh, tomorrow.

169
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,930
So we have our countdown timer.

170
00:03:48,009 --> 00:03:50,099
We have starting tomorrow, last

171
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:50,819
chance.

172
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:52,689
We typically do a VSL and this is

173
00:03:52,689 --> 00:03:54,020
with Fidelytics.

174
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,620
So I love, uh, I've been loving

175
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,139
Fidelytics lately.

176
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,849
These guys have a money back

177
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,180
guarantee on their actual, um, on

178
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:03,139
their actual funnel itself too,

179
00:04:03,259 --> 00:04:04,819
or sorry, on their paid event.

180
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,180
So we stress that there.

181
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,139
And then it's pretty much like

182
00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:07,689
long form

183
00:04:07,819 --> 00:04:08,789
copy for the rest of it, for the

184
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:09,229
page.

185
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,270
We do of course explain what

186
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,620
they're going to get each day.

187
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:12,969
We talked about the schedule.

188
00:04:12,969 --> 00:04:14,189
We say, what's including your

189
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:15,620
ticket, why you need to do this

190
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:16,110
right now.

191
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:17,279
Like they're talking about the

192
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,610
big, beautiful bill that Trump

193
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:19,360
passed and everything.

194
00:04:19,449 --> 00:04:20,290
So they're really leaning into

195
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:20,569
that.

196
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,779
We heat map these pages.

197
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:22,980
This is actually getting consumed

198
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:24,810
a lot, which is quite interesting.

199
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:26,410
And then we have, you know, start

200
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:27,060
tomorrow,

201
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,300
secure your discounted pricing.

202
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,459
We have general mission.

203
00:04:31,459 --> 00:04:32,660
We always like to do a VIP

204
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,069
money back guarantee, meet your

205
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:35,379
host.

206
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,250
And just a lot like on these

207
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,850
challenge pages to cold traffic,

208
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:41,170
we have a lot of content on it.

209
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:42,740
We have a lot of different things,

210
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:43,779
explaining what they're getting,

211
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,079
explaining the methodology, what

212
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:46,350
they're going to be learning, the

213
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:48,019
expected results, the payoff,

214
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:48,819
everything like that.

215
00:04:48,819 --> 00:04:50,370
Um, some things that, you know, I

216
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:51,699
definitely, as I scroll here, want

217
00:04:51,699 --> 00:04:52,019
to change,

218
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:52,970
like, I don't really like this

219
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:53,110
red.

220
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,339
So just kind of keep that in mind.

221
00:04:54,339 --> 00:04:55,220
It's a little jarring.

222
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,339
We're definitely going to change

223
00:04:56,439 --> 00:04:57,699
that later, even up here, right?

224
00:04:57,699 --> 00:04:58,420
Super jarring.

225
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:58,819
I don't know,

226
00:04:58,939 --> 00:04:59,389
like that.

227
00:04:59,389 --> 00:05:00,470
It's contrast up here.

228
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,879
So I'm very critical of our pages,

229
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:02,980
but you know, this one's

230
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,449
converting super well.

231
00:05:04,459 --> 00:05:06,279
So might not change it too much,

232
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:08,389
but, um, you know, we're gonna,

233
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:08,740
we're gonna

234
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:10,709
keep it, keep it running.

235
00:05:10,709 --> 00:05:12,850
So click here to get your ticket

236
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:15,009
now and have another countdown

237
00:05:15,009 --> 00:05:15,540
timer

238
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:16,910
goes right to a checkout.

239
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:18,720
They can click here to order bump.

240
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,620
This is on GHL.

241
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:20,730
I prefer

242
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:22,100
building on click funnels, but

243
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:23,139
Hey, totally cool.

244
00:05:23,139 --> 00:05:25,639
Um, right here you can upgrade

245
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:26,740
into that.

246
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:27,459
So this is a,

247
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,629
um, basically we split test two

248
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,139
different checkout pages by the

249
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:31,529
way.

250
00:05:31,529 --> 00:05:32,899
And, uh, this is just one of the

251
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:33,470
dead ones.

252
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:34,540
It's not actually live at the

253
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,750
current moment, whatever dead

254
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,939
funnels, but anyways, um,

255
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,259
what you would do is have your

256
00:05:39,259 --> 00:05:40,509
nice order bump down here.

257
00:05:40,699 --> 00:05:42,100
You'd go name, phone number,

258
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:42,819
email.

259
00:05:42,939 --> 00:05:44,290
This also does submit it.

260
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,009
So if they fill this out and they

261
00:05:46,009 --> 00:05:48,980
do not, um, go ahead and purchase,

262
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:50,019
we can actually dial them there,

263
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:50,819
which is pretty cool.

264
00:05:50,819 --> 00:05:53,060
Have the dates up top and some

265
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:53,610
reiterations

266
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,529
of what they get.

267
00:05:54,529 --> 00:05:55,629
Talk about some of the VIP

268
00:05:55,629 --> 00:05:56,740
exclusives on there.

269
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:57,699
So we can get a nice take

270
00:05:57,819 --> 00:05:59,529
rate on the VIP upgrades, have

271
00:05:59,529 --> 00:06:01,439
some social proof and some FAQs,

272
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:02,660
um, down here.

273
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:03,300
This one actually

274
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:04,420
gets opened a lot, which is quite

275
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:04,990
interesting.

276
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,160
The house is different from Nate's

277
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:06,730
free training

278
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:07,660
or online content.

279
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,029
Nate's the person holding it.

280
00:06:09,029 --> 00:06:10,459
Then after this, after you would

281
00:06:10,459 --> 00:06:11,860
purchase your ticket,

282
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,939
you get hit with a series of, uh,

283
00:06:13,939 --> 00:06:14,430
OTOs.

284
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:16,500
So one-time orders, and those are

285
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,769
basically just, uh,

286
00:06:17,899 --> 00:06:19,649
one-time upsells trying to raise

287
00:06:19,649 --> 00:06:20,350
our AOV up.

288
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:22,180
And at the end of the funnel,

289
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,899
we have a calendar for them to

290
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,680
book on in.

291
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,810
Now, after they actually purchase

292
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,139
their,

293
00:06:27,259 --> 00:06:28,600
their ticket and they're in the

294
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:30,310
system and everything, we hit them

295
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:31,220
with backend email

296
00:06:31,339 --> 00:06:31,629
flows.

297
00:06:31,629 --> 00:06:33,050
We hit them with organic content

298
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:34,379
remarketing as well, just to

299
00:06:34,379 --> 00:06:34,959
pre-frame them

300
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:35,920
before the challenge.

301
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,079
Plus we like to pair them up with

302
00:06:37,089 --> 00:06:37,550
a closer.

303
00:06:37,709 --> 00:06:39,170
We call them an advisor sometimes.

304
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:40,750
And, uh, we don't call them a

305
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:41,089
closer.

306
00:06:41,089 --> 00:06:42,019
We call them an advisor.

307
00:06:42,019 --> 00:06:44,410
And from there, uh,

308
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:45,600
what we do is basically the

309
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,850
advisor and the prospect will

310
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:48,100
build a connection with each

311
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:48,819
other.

312
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:50,180
So the advisor can basically be

313
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:51,689
like, Hey, you didn't show up to

314
00:06:51,689 --> 00:06:52,100
day one.

315
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:52,680
What's up?

316
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:52,819
Like,

317
00:06:52,939 --> 00:06:54,740
here's the replay, like, you know,

318
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,569
or 15 minutes into day one, they

319
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:57,459
text them, Hey,

320
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:58,889
showing up, showing up, showing

321
00:06:58,889 --> 00:07:00,089
up, um, stuff like that.

322
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,279
So they're really, we're really

323
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:01,730
leaning

324
00:07:01,899 --> 00:07:03,740
on those salespeople to pull them

325
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:05,779
through the challenge and get them

326
00:07:05,779 --> 00:07:07,220
to show up more pre-framed,

327
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:08,060
ready to buy.

328
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,670
Um, and then also get them the

329
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:11,589
necessary resources they need to

330
00:07:11,589 --> 00:07:12,259
prioritize

331
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:13,579
showing up the challenge in the

332
00:07:13,579 --> 00:07:14,230
first place.

333
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:15,639
And, uh, of course booking that

334
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:16,899
sales call with them on day

335
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,439
two, day three, whatever the

336
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,410
pitches and, uh, roll from there.

337
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:21,860
So that's the challenge funnel

338
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,439
structure from a high level and

339
00:07:23,579 --> 00:07:23,980
let me know if you have any

340
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:24,240
questions.
