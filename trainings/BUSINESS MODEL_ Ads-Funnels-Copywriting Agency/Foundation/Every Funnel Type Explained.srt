1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:00,890
All right, so I'm super excited

2
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:01,379
for this one.

3
00:00:01,510 --> 00:00:02,990
This is going to be a little bit

4
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:04,120
lengthier of a video,

5
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:05,059
but we're going to talk about

6
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:06,940
every single funnel structure

7
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:09,839
that you can run for your clients

8
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:11,380
and what they look like and some

9
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:12,580
best practices on them.

10
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:16,050
So first off is our trusty VSL

11
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:19,420
call funnel, all right?

12
00:00:19,589 --> 00:00:21,649
So the objective of a VSL call

13
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:23,739
funnel is, guess what?

14
00:00:23,809 --> 00:00:24,800
If you're smart, you'll be able to

15
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,760
get this, ready?

16
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:26,899
To book calls.

17
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:28,750
So there's two different

18
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:30,260
structures you could run with a

19
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:30,960
VSL call funnel.

20
00:00:31,089 --> 00:00:34,409
You can run it with an opt-in and

21
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:38,039
you can run it without an opt-in.

22
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:40,859
And what these look like are this.

23
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:43,560
You have, of course, the ad and

24
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,920
you drive with the opt-in.

25
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,280
We're on the with the opt-in side.

26
00:00:47,409 --> 00:00:50,219
You drive traffic to a landing

27
00:00:50,229 --> 00:00:52,020
page that basically you collect

28
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:52,340
name,

29
00:00:52,609 --> 00:00:54,390
phone number, and email before

30
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:57,200
they go to this page over here.

31
00:00:57,409 --> 00:01:03,210
With the VSL, the CTA, and, you

32
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:05,359
know, any other copy or FAQ

33
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:05,590
sections

34
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,079
or case study sections that you

35
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:07,400
have.

36
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:09,750
And then from there, they have

37
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,420
the, you know, application, right?

38
00:01:13,549 --> 00:01:15,219
And they go after they schedule a

39
00:01:15,219 --> 00:01:17,069
call through the application to a

40
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:18,099
confirm page.

41
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:20,450
And that's what it looks like with

42
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:21,680
an opt-in.

43
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:24,079
Now, without an opt-in, you

44
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:28,219
basically just bypass this page.

45
00:01:28,489 --> 00:01:30,060
You basically just drive them

46
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:33,379
straight to a page right here.

47
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:36,250
That has a VSL, the CTA, copy, all

48
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:37,769
that fun stuff.

49
00:01:37,909 --> 00:01:40,340
The scheduler and the application,

50
00:01:40,379 --> 00:01:42,459
you know, embedded there.

51
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:44,359
And then the confirm page.

52
00:01:44,489 --> 00:01:46,560
And real quick, we'll just talk

53
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:49,099
about the actual landing page best

54
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:51,290
practices for, you know, these

55
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:51,900
pages here.

56
00:01:53,689 --> 00:01:57,060
Now, what we like to do on our

57
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,540
landers for a VSL call funnel is

58
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:02,319
we have our nice headline here.

59
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:04,670
Nice, concise, snappy.

60
00:02:04,969 --> 00:02:06,879
We like to have our sub-headline.

61
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:09,000
Then, of course, we'll have our

62
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,419
VSL here, our video sales letter.

63
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:13,979
Then we'll have our call to action

64
00:02:13,979 --> 00:02:14,650
right here.

65
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:16,629
Then below that call to action,

66
00:02:16,629 --> 00:02:18,389
we'll have a couple different

67
00:02:18,389 --> 00:02:19,680
sections of copy.

68
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:21,840
So, we'll basically sometimes

69
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,680
articulate in a section the

70
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,659
problem people are having,

71
00:02:25,789 --> 00:02:28,430
our solution to that problem,

72
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:30,719
basically our service.

73
00:02:30,949 --> 00:02:33,710
Then we'll have below that a bunch

74
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:36,379
of proof, so case studies.

75
00:02:36,509 --> 00:02:38,539
And then we'll have a bunch of

76
00:02:38,539 --> 00:02:39,580
text FAQs.

77
00:02:40,419 --> 00:02:41,629
So, there's a big old bunch of

78
00:02:41,629 --> 00:02:42,509
drop-down FAQs.

79
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:43,780
So, that's what we'll follow.

80
00:02:43,909 --> 00:02:45,430
Sometimes we'll split test

81
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:46,900
removing this stuff.

82
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:49,020
Other times we'll actually expand.

83
00:02:49,129 --> 00:02:50,539
So, we'll pick some parts of the

84
00:02:50,539 --> 00:02:51,719
VSL that we want people to

85
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:53,560
consume, like different sections,

86
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,759
topics, stuff like that.

87
00:02:54,889 --> 00:02:56,139
And we'll break them out as

88
00:02:56,139 --> 00:02:57,990
sections further down the landing

89
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:59,340
page and everything.

90
00:02:59,469 --> 00:03:00,949
But what you want to know at all

91
00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:02,889
times is to, again, make sure it's

92
00:03:02,889 --> 00:03:05,139
mobile optimized, the entire page.

93
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:07,990
But above the fold, so when you

94
00:03:08,389 --> 00:03:10,409
first land on the page, all of

95
00:03:10,409 --> 00:03:13,180
this here should be within view.

96
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:15,800
The CTA should be within view.

97
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:17,030
The VSL, the headline, the

98
00:03:17,069 --> 00:03:18,580
sub-headline should all be nice,

99
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:20,120
clean, positioned above the fold

100
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,800
right when you land on the page.

101
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:23,580
So, just a quick blurb about, you

102
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,439
know, actually designing landing

103
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:27,039
pages and the structure of them

104
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:28,389
and what to put on them that

105
00:03:28,389 --> 00:03:29,659
actually convert.

106
00:03:29,789 --> 00:03:30,599
That's what we like to do.

107
00:03:30,729 --> 00:03:34,419
So, that is a VSL call funnel.

108
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:36,430
And we usually run these pretty

109
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:38,039
much and usually run these about

110
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:40,240
80% of the time, 90% of the time

111
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,889
sometimes for our clients.

112
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,250
This is the funnel structure we

113
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:44,810
typically default to because we're

114
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:46,270
working with a lot of high-ticket

115
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:47,789
businesses that are trying to book

116
00:03:47,789 --> 00:03:48,460
in calls.

117
00:03:50,409 --> 00:03:52,030
Now, the key part is all the stuff

118
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:53,710
that happens after they book in a

119
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:54,219
call.

120
00:03:54,349 --> 00:03:55,449
That's outside of the scope of

121
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:56,120
this video.

122
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,650
But, you know, hitting them with

123
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:59,240
the right value-based follow-up,

124
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,409
hitting them with content

125
00:04:00,409 --> 00:04:02,159
remarketing, emails on the back

126
00:04:02,419 --> 00:04:04,250
end, manual, actual good manual

127
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,360
sales processes and everything.

128
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:07,659
Like, good reach outs, good

129
00:04:07,659 --> 00:04:09,300
engagement bait, you know, sending

130
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:10,669
them different assets and all

131
00:04:10,669 --> 00:04:11,099
that.

132
00:04:11,289 --> 00:04:12,319
That's going to get people to show

133
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,349
up to that actual sales call and

134
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,580
convert in the first place.

135
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:16,329
But, this right here is just a

136
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:18,220
front-end funnel structure and

137
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:19,819
what it would look like.

138
00:04:19,949 --> 00:04:21,889
And from there, of course, you

139
00:04:21,889 --> 00:04:23,810
make sure that you have proper

140
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:25,860
pixel conditioning in place.

141
00:04:26,129 --> 00:04:27,910
So, if I have the page here with

142
00:04:27,949 --> 00:04:30,290
the BSL and the application, and I

143
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:33,089
have the CTA here, and I click

144
00:04:33,089 --> 00:04:36,019
that button, it pops up and has

145
00:04:36,019 --> 00:04:39,399
the, you know, whole type form.

146
00:04:39,689 --> 00:04:41,709
We ask them a bunch of questions,

147
00:04:41,709 --> 00:04:43,800
and then they have the scheduler

148
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,519
there.

149
00:04:44,649 --> 00:04:46,870
Based upon their questions, we

150
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:49,060
could send them down one of two

151
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:49,839
paths.

152
00:04:49,939 --> 00:04:51,189
If they are qualified, we send

153
00:04:51,189 --> 00:04:52,189
them down this path.

154
00:04:52,339 --> 00:04:53,699
If they are disqualified, we send

155
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:54,670
them down this path.

156
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:56,209
So, essentially, if they just

157
00:04:56,209 --> 00:04:57,560
don't meet a certain revenue

158
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,439
threshold, or don't meet some sort

159
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,060
of qualification set of questions

160
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,519
that you have on that application,

161
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:04,360
you want to send them down this DQ

162
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,259
path here.

163
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:08,300
And these both go to confirmation

164
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:11,220
pages, unless you just totally DQ

165
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,569
the disqualified leads in the

166
00:05:14,029 --> 00:05:15,420
form, and, you know, just end the

167
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:16,899
type form or application there.

168
00:05:17,029 --> 00:05:18,180
But, if you send them to a

169
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:20,050
confirmation page, make sure that

170
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:21,589
this one has no standard event

171
00:05:21,589 --> 00:05:22,379
code on it.

172
00:05:23,009 --> 00:05:24,790
So, it does not report back to the

173
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:26,720
ad platform, and just make sure

174
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:28,899
that the qualified side, you know,

175
00:05:28,899 --> 00:05:30,860
has, like, the schedule code on

176
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:34,199
there, or the submit app.

177
00:05:34,329 --> 00:05:36,110
So, it reports back to the ad

178
00:05:36,149 --> 00:05:38,639
platform, we only want to optimize

179
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,639
and protect that pixel.

180
00:05:40,769 --> 00:05:42,550
We only want to optimize around

181
00:05:42,589 --> 00:05:44,889
qualified prospects, so we protect

182
00:05:44,889 --> 00:05:47,290
that pixel, and only, again,

183
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:49,240
feedback qualified people into the

184
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,019
ad platform.

185
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:51,930
Because meta is a big AI machine,

186
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:53,800
so the data you put into it, and

187
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,689
the conversions you send back to

188
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:57,230
it, is exactly what you're going

189
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:58,329
to get out in the future.

190
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:05,750
So, the next type of funnel

191
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:07,639
structure is a low ticket

192
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:11,220
Ascension funnel.

193
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:14,000
So, what this looks like is you

194
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
have the ad here, you're driving

195
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,029
them over to a page that

196
00:06:19,029 --> 00:06:21,810
essentially is trying to sell a

197
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:24,050
low ticket product.

198
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:25,399
Usually, we'll put a video on here

199
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:26,420
explaining the product, sometimes

200
00:06:26,769 --> 00:06:28,029
we'll split test without it, but

201
00:06:28,029 --> 00:06:29,779
then the rest of the copy on the

202
00:06:29,779 --> 00:06:31,680
page is just explaining what the

203
00:06:31,689 --> 00:06:33,199
product is, the benefits, what

204
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,709
they're getting, everything like

205
00:06:34,709 --> 00:06:35,100
that.

206
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:36,810
And usually, this will be a

207
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:38,819
product anywhere from I've seen

208
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:41,120
stuff work at, like, $7, all the

209
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,439
way up to about $97, and on the

210
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:47,439
checkout page that you drive them

211
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:48,939
to, you can have different order

212
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:49,279
bumps.

213
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:51,170
So, you can have an order bump

214
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:52,750
here to add on some sort of

215
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:55,019
product or service for, you know,

216
00:06:55,019 --> 00:06:57,600
like $100, $47, whatever pricing

217
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:00,620
strategy you want to use, $27.

218
00:07:01,389 --> 00:07:02,730
But it can be a checkbox for them

219
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:04,259
that they can add this thing on to

220
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:05,750
increase the AOV, which is the

221
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,079
average order value of this

222
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:07,819
funnel.

223
00:07:07,949 --> 00:07:09,569
But essentially, you have page

224
00:07:09,569 --> 00:07:11,500
one, which is the sales page, page

225
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,560
two, which is the checkout page.

226
00:07:13,689 --> 00:07:15,459
And then sometimes, we'll put a

227
00:07:15,459 --> 00:07:17,149
series of OTOs, so one-time

228
00:07:17,149 --> 00:07:19,290
orders, which are pages basically

229
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:21,560
pitching an additional product.

230
00:07:21,689 --> 00:07:23,259
Like, hey, you bought this thing,

231
00:07:23,259 --> 00:07:24,699
this thing is going to be a great

232
00:07:24,699 --> 00:07:25,970
fit to essentially help you

233
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:27,850
amplify your results, whether it's

234
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,620
like an additional swipe file, an

235
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:31,240
additional, I don't know,

236
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:33,060
a software package, a community

237
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,870
access, a physical product, an

238
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:36,959
extra book, something like that.

239
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:38,970
You can have a series of OTOs,

240
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:41,220
which sometimes we'll do like one

241
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:44,589
to three OTOs, pages here.

242
00:07:45,829 --> 00:07:48,050
And then after that sequence, and

243
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:50,629
on these pages too, they can click

244
00:07:50,629 --> 00:07:52,910
a button that says, yes, I want

245
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:53,459
it.

246
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:54,610
Or they can click another button

247
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:55,810
that says, no, I don't want it.

248
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:57,769
And that just drives them to the

249
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,839
next OTO page.

250
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,939
Or you can select it to where,

251
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:03,500
hey, if they say no to the first

252
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,120
two, like just drive them to the

253
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,399
confirmation page.

254
00:08:06,529 --> 00:08:08,230
But basically, after that whole

255
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:10,040
sequence, whether you do OTOs or

256
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,459
not, that's up to you.

257
00:08:11,649 --> 00:08:14,500
You essentially have a page here

258
00:08:14,509 --> 00:08:17,560
that is the confirm page, but also

259
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:20,120
allows them to book in an

260
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:22,480
implementation call,

261
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:23,870
which is essentially a back-end

262
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,269
sales call for your high-ticket

263
00:08:25,269 --> 00:08:26,319
product or service.

264
00:08:26,569 --> 00:08:29,040
And after that, they go to the

265
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,910
final confirmation page, which you

266
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:33,279
can put the schedule code if you

267
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,279
want to on there.

268
00:08:34,408 --> 00:08:36,279
So that's what a low-ticket or

269
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:38,500
high-ticket attention does.

270
00:08:38,629 --> 00:08:40,690
And then the key to making these

271
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:42,970
work is you need to get the people

272
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:45,340
to actually consume and use the

273
00:08:45,379 --> 00:08:47,299
low-ticket product.

274
00:08:47,889 --> 00:08:48,889
So that's why we like to drive

275
00:08:48,889 --> 00:08:49,990
them into communities, for

276
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:51,549
example, there, or also have

277
00:08:51,549 --> 00:08:53,730
setters or salespeople just reach

278
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:54,620
out to them,

279
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:55,929
making sure they're implementing

280
00:08:55,929 --> 00:08:57,100
and using the product that they

281
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:57,870
just purchased.

282
00:08:58,049 --> 00:08:59,659
And like I said, these products

283
00:08:59,659 --> 00:09:01,600
can be swipe files, mini courses,

284
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,919
physical products.

285
00:09:03,049 --> 00:09:04,500
You know, a book funnel is another

286
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,909
funnel here, which basically

287
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:07,320
you're just selling a physical

288
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,909
book here instead of, you know, a

289
00:09:08,909 --> 00:09:09,740
digital product.

290
00:09:09,929 --> 00:09:11,159
But it's helping them solve a

291
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:11,990
narrow problem.

292
00:09:12,269 --> 00:09:14,049
And essentially, like, for

293
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:16,190
example, if I sell ads, it might

294
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:18,200
be, hey, here's a swipe file of

295
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,440
all of our top-performing static

296
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:20,480
ads

297
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:22,330
that you can just mix and match

298
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:23,860
and, like, replace with your

299
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:25,460
product or service or change the

300
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,809
copy around and stuff that'll help

301
00:09:26,809 --> 00:09:27,480
you get some results.

302
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:29,000
You know, it's solving that narrow

303
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,559
problem.

304
00:09:29,929 --> 00:09:31,200
And essentially from there, I'm

305
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,379
going to try to sell them.

306
00:09:32,429 --> 00:09:33,779
I've done a few ad services or my,

307
00:09:33,779 --> 00:09:35,279
you know, coaching program for ads

308
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:36,669
or something like that on the back

309
00:09:36,669 --> 00:09:37,360
end, right?

310
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:39,779
But the key is to get them to

311
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:42,980
actually consume the low-ticket

312
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,629
product and use it and then try to

313
00:09:45,629 --> 00:09:47,480
build a relationship with them

314
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:49,669
to get them on a back-end sales

315
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:52,220
call if they do not, of course,

316
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:54,409
book it here to sell them your

317
00:09:54,429 --> 00:09:56,320
high-ticket thing.

318
00:09:56,419 --> 00:09:57,549
So you get them to consume that

319
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:59,100
low-ticket product and then ascend

320
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,570
into that high-ticket thing.

321
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:01,750
And usually we like to try to do

322
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,159
that within 7 to 14 days.

323
00:10:03,289 --> 00:10:04,570
But honestly, you'll see some

324
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:06,029
people that buy your low-ticket

325
00:10:06,029 --> 00:10:08,419
product and they ascend in 4, 5,

326
00:10:08,419 --> 00:10:09,799
6-plus months.

327
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:10,500
It's pretty crazy.

328
00:10:10,629 --> 00:10:12,320
So that's a funnel structure we

329
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,100
like to do.

330
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:14,679
It's a little bit more complex.

331
00:10:14,809 --> 00:10:17,309
But we will run that sometimes in

332
00:10:17,309 --> 00:10:20,039
tandem with a VSL call funnel.

333
00:10:20,169 --> 00:10:22,139
But usually we just default to a

334
00:10:22,139 --> 00:10:23,210
call funnel.

335
00:10:24,379 --> 00:10:25,529
In certain scenarios, though, it

336
00:10:25,529 --> 00:10:26,289
does make sense to get a

337
00:10:26,289 --> 00:10:26,899
low-ticket.

338
00:10:27,019 --> 00:10:28,110
But like I said, typically, this

339
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:28,970
is a little bit higher of a

340
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:29,799
friction funnel.

341
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:31,090
This is where we're already, you

342
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:32,429
know, scaling and kind of hitting

343
00:10:32,429 --> 00:10:33,440
a wall with a call funnel

344
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:34,789
and we'll layer this low-ticket

345
00:10:34,789 --> 00:10:35,100
on.

346
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:40,470
Cool.

347
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:46,629
Now, the next one is a webinar

348
00:10:46,629 --> 00:10:47,360
funnel.

349
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:49,789
You can do these evergreen or

350
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,600
live.

351
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:52,440
I like to use live webinar

352
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,340
funnels.

353
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:55,070
Evergreens are doing absolutely

354
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:56,269
terrible right now.

355
00:10:56,379 --> 00:10:57,240
We're in 2025.

356
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:58,879
They are not performing well.

357
00:10:58,980 --> 00:10:59,980
So I would not recommend an

358
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:01,230
evergreen webinar funnel.

359
00:11:01,389 --> 00:11:02,960
An evergreen webinar is basically

360
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,529
where you just drive somebody to a

361
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:06,279
prerecorded webinar saying,

362
00:11:06,409 --> 00:11:07,669
hey, it starts in 10 minutes and

363
00:11:07,669 --> 00:11:08,700
they watch a recording.

364
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,460
It doesn't work nearly as well.

365
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:12,809
So webinar funnels, we like to do

366
00:11:13,049 --> 00:11:13,480
live.

367
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:15,250
And this is essentially where you

368
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:16,320
have the ad here.

369
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:18,509
You drive them over to a page with

370
00:11:18,659 --> 00:11:19,480
an opt-in.

371
00:11:19,549 --> 00:11:20,600
So usually we'll click name, phone

372
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,279
number, email.

373
00:11:21,409 --> 00:11:22,779
Potentially one other question

374
00:11:22,779 --> 00:11:24,159
here if we want to determine if

375
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:25,340
they're an MQL or not.

376
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:26,940
If they're an MQL, we'll pass them

377
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:27,690
down one side.

378
00:11:27,929 --> 00:11:28,519
Right?

379
00:11:28,629 --> 00:11:30,090
If they're not an MQL, we'll pass

380
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:31,399
them down another side.

381
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:32,750
Usually we'll let them still

382
00:11:32,789 --> 00:11:34,259
attend the webinar and sign up and

383
00:11:34,259 --> 00:11:35,690
register and all that stuff.

384
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:37,240
But if you want to protect the

385
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,940
pixel, that's what you can do.

386
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,210
You can have a qualifier question

387
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:40,539
here.

388
00:11:40,669 --> 00:11:44,019
But after that, we drive them over

389
00:11:44,019 --> 00:11:46,559
to the confirmation page.

390
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:48,039
And we're hitting them with a

391
00:11:48,049 --> 00:11:49,490
bunch of email flows and hype

392
00:11:49,529 --> 00:11:50,799
around the webinar.

393
00:11:52,309 --> 00:11:54,799
And then we hold a live webinar

394
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:57,629
for them where we try to pitch our

395
00:11:57,629 --> 00:11:59,740
product or service.

396
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:01,259
And if you're doing kind of like a

397
00:12:01,269 --> 00:12:02,840
done for you agency service, I

398
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,320
like to give a ton of value

399
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:05,570
inside of these.

400
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:06,639
So much value to where they're

401
00:12:06,649 --> 00:12:07,789
like, yeah, I'm just going to pay

402
00:12:07,909 --> 00:12:08,740
this guy to do this.

403
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,940
He knows what he's doing.

404
00:12:10,049 --> 00:12:11,460
If you're selling like a coaching

405
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:12,639
program type thing, you

406
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:14,100
essentially still want to give

407
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:14,820
good value,

408
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:15,710
but you want to sell the

409
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:17,009
opportunity some more, especially

410
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,059
if it's like a biz off.

411
00:12:18,309 --> 00:12:18,899
That's a big thing.

412
00:12:22,309 --> 00:12:24,799
So that's a live webinar funnel

413
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:27,580
and we'll run these bi-weekly,

414
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,259
sometimes weekly.

415
00:12:30,389 --> 00:12:32,120
Even, honestly, we have some

416
00:12:32,129 --> 00:12:33,899
clients that are doing it two

417
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:35,320
times a week, which is pretty

418
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:35,590
sick.

419
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:36,899
Obviously, it depends on your

420
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:38,200
spend level and how fast you can

421
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,320
fill up these webinars.

422
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:41,360
But we love doing these.

423
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:43,029
Love doing them for different

424
00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:44,289
offers that need a lot of

425
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:46,309
education before the actual sales

426
00:12:46,309 --> 00:12:46,980
call occurs.

427
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:48,039
Or if you just have like a

428
00:12:48,039 --> 00:12:49,330
straight week sales team, these

429
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:50,440
are great to do.

430
00:12:51,909 --> 00:12:53,690
And typically, we're going to be

431
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:55,500
booking calls off of these.

432
00:12:55,629 --> 00:12:57,350
Sometimes we'll do direct to

433
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:59,299
checkout if the actual ticket

434
00:12:59,299 --> 00:13:01,799
price of the product is like 3K or

435
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:02,149
less.

436
00:13:02,309 --> 00:13:05,259
But usually, I would default to

437
00:13:05,259 --> 00:13:07,720
booking calls on this.

438
00:13:12,909 --> 00:13:15,559
Then from there, another one we

439
00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:18,320
have is a lead magnet funnel.

440
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:23,940
This is very simple.

441
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:25,320
This is where we have the ad.

442
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:27,929
We get them to opt in to receive

443
00:13:27,929 --> 00:13:29,750
something for free.

444
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:30,990
So we usually do name, phone

445
00:13:31,029 --> 00:13:31,919
number, email.

446
00:13:32,049 --> 00:13:33,129
Sometimes that other qualifier

447
00:13:33,129 --> 00:13:33,779
question too.

448
00:13:33,929 --> 00:13:35,799
They get something for free.

449
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:40,059
And from there, we have setters

450
00:13:40,059 --> 00:13:41,549
typically calling the people that

451
00:13:41,549 --> 00:13:42,019
opted in.

452
00:13:42,149 --> 00:13:45,600
Trying to set them for a back-end

453
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,240
sales call.

454
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:48,909
But again, this lead magnet, just

455
00:13:48,909 --> 00:13:50,490
like the low-ticket product, has

456
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:51,960
to be something good.

457
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:53,330
And it has to solve a narrow

458
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:55,129
problem that essentially unlocks

459
00:13:55,139 --> 00:13:56,980
further problems to the prospect

460
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,769
that your core offer or your

461
00:13:58,769 --> 00:14:00,279
high-ticket service or product

462
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:01,360
solves.

463
00:14:01,809 --> 00:14:02,559
That's the key thing.

464
00:14:02,659 --> 00:14:03,509
And it has to be actually good.

465
00:14:03,629 --> 00:14:04,700
If it's a bad lead magnet, it's

466
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,730
just fluff and garbage.

467
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:07,110
People are going to look at you

468
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:08,360
like, yeah, this guy just gives

469
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,279
out fluff and garbage.

470
00:14:09,409 --> 00:14:10,720
His free stuff sucks.

471
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:12,340
So why would his paid be any good?

472
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:13,289
You want it to be the other way

473
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:13,740
around.

474
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:15,370
If you're like, damn, this guy's

475
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:16,860
free stuff is so good, his paid

476
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:18,210
stuff must be insane.

477
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:19,840
Same with the low-ticket thing.

478
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:23,009
If this $27 product here is

479
00:14:23,019 --> 00:14:25,379
insane, then they're like, wow,

480
00:14:25,379 --> 00:14:27,129
his high-ticket stuff must be even

481
00:14:27,129 --> 00:14:27,779
better.

482
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:28,389
That's insane.

483
00:14:29,309 --> 00:14:31,370
So that's a lead magnet funnel.

484
00:14:31,509 --> 00:14:33,110
We usually don't default to this

485
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:34,720
one just because it does take a

486
00:14:34,779 --> 00:14:36,200
really good sales team.

487
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:37,409
Right now, we'll run this if we

488
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:38,759
need to create some top-of-funnel

489
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:39,370
traffic.

490
00:14:39,509 --> 00:14:41,389
And we're reaching some spend

491
00:14:41,389 --> 00:14:42,000
caps.

492
00:14:42,129 --> 00:14:44,190
And basically, we're just reaching

493
00:14:44,259 --> 00:14:46,200
a wall on the amount of scale we

494
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,419
can have on some other funnels.

495
00:14:48,529 --> 00:14:49,820
We'll weave this in there.

496
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:55,429
And then another one that you can

497
00:14:55,429 --> 00:14:57,379
run is a challenge funnel.

498
00:15:02,029 --> 00:15:03,789
Now, these are really, really

499
00:15:03,789 --> 00:15:04,830
complex to run.

500
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:08,000
You can do in-person or you can do

501
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,269
virtual.

502
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:11,399
Most of the time, we do virtual.

503
00:15:11,529 --> 00:15:14,639
But essentially here, a challenge

504
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:17,220
funnel is you have the ad.

505
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:20,240
You're getting people to purchase

506
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,539
tickets, right?

507
00:15:21,669 --> 00:15:22,940
You have a sales page, just like

508
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:24,470
the low-ticket product funnel.

509
00:15:24,649 --> 00:15:26,490
Checkout page.

510
00:15:26,629 --> 00:15:28,409
You can have some order bumps on

511
00:15:28,409 --> 00:15:30,620
there, too, where they plug a box

512
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:31,779
and it upgrades their order.

513
00:15:31,879 --> 00:15:33,009
It's like a VIP ticket or just

514
00:15:33,009 --> 00:15:34,470
adds on some bonuses or something

515
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:35,029
like that.

516
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:37,779
Sometimes, we'll have OTOs here as

517
00:15:37,779 --> 00:15:38,240
well.

518
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:43,620
And then after that string, we'll

519
00:15:43,629 --> 00:15:47,149
still have them book an

520
00:15:47,149 --> 00:15:51,200
implementation call, which is

521
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:52,509
essentially a back-end sales call.

522
00:15:52,649 --> 00:15:54,029
And sometimes, we're able to

523
00:15:54,029 --> 00:15:55,769
actually get people to ascend into

524
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,580
a high-ticket product or service

525
00:15:57,730 --> 00:15:59,620
before actually consuming the

526
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:01,559
challenge just on these sales

527
00:16:01,559 --> 00:16:02,240
calls.

528
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:03,590
So, you'll find a lot of people

529
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:05,000
who are super in-market for that

530
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,470
thing will just ascend right then

531
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:07,679
and there, which is pretty cool.

532
00:16:07,809 --> 00:16:09,450
Not a high volume, but definitely

533
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:10,299
cool to have.

534
00:16:10,429 --> 00:16:11,419
That's why we have that scheduler

535
00:16:11,419 --> 00:16:12,159
instead of just a blank

536
00:16:12,169 --> 00:16:13,000
confirmation page.

537
00:16:13,129 --> 00:16:14,740
Also, on this one, if they're not

538
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,250
essentially ready to ascend or

539
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:18,570
they're not qualified, we'll mark

540
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:20,789
them down as that on the CRM if

541
00:16:20,789 --> 00:16:21,309
they're not qualified.

542
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:22,960
But if they are qualified and

543
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,970
they're essentially just not ready

544
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:26,870
to fully ascend at that point, we

545
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:28,289
just hype them up for the event

546
00:16:28,429 --> 00:16:29,460
and make sure that they're super

547
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:30,500
ready for the event that's coming

548
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:30,980
up.

549
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:32,789
So, usually we'll do like a

550
00:16:32,789 --> 00:16:36,029
three-day or a five-day workshop

551
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:38,299
where each day is a different

552
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:39,960
topic, helping them get started

553
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,370
doing the thing that you're

554
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:42,440
teaching, right?

555
00:16:42,539 --> 00:16:43,840
So, if it's teaching them how to

556
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,289
start investing in multifamily

557
00:16:45,289 --> 00:16:46,450
real estate like one of our

558
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:48,970
clients, day one is teaching them

559
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:51,440
the tactics, day two is helping

560
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:52,960
them implement more.

561
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:54,570
And then day three is essentially

562
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:56,200
helping them actually get started

563
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,899
on sourcing a property, reaching

564
00:16:57,899 --> 00:16:59,759
out to sellers, stuff like that.

565
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:01,419
So, it's getting them in motion

566
00:17:01,419 --> 00:17:03,049
doing the thing, and day two, we

567
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,838
have a pitch, day three, we have a

568
00:17:04,838 --> 00:17:05,740
bigger pitch.

569
00:17:05,869 --> 00:17:07,859
That's all it is.

570
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:09,029
You're just getting someone to

571
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:10,190
spend multiple days with you,

572
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:11,660
teaching them the process and all

573
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:13,078
this stuff before sending them

574
00:17:13,078 --> 00:17:14,400
into your high-ticket product or

575
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:14,940
service.

576
00:17:15,068 --> 00:17:17,130
So, we like to do these usually

577
00:17:17,529 --> 00:17:20,299
like bimonthly as like big old

578
00:17:20,299 --> 00:17:23,250
cash grabs and sweeps.

579
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:24,609
So, we'll like also hit the

580
00:17:24,609 --> 00:17:26,059
organic audience with these two,

581
00:17:26,059 --> 00:17:27,259
hit the email list, all that

582
00:17:27,259 --> 00:17:31,289
stuff, or we'll do them quarterly

583
00:17:31,289 --> 00:17:32,460
too.

584
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,660
So, not a too frequent of a

585
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,440
cadence, but these are like big,

586
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,380
big, big, big, big cash plays.
