1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:00,360
All right.

2
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,179
So the tech stack is pretty

3
00:00:01,330 --> 00:00:03,180
straightforward for what we use on

4
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:03,560
a day-to-day

5
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:04,089
basis.

6
00:00:04,089 --> 00:00:05,269
It's very lean too.

7
00:00:05,269 --> 00:00:06,839
We don't have a ton of tech.

8
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:09,000
We leverage AI a ton now in our ad

9
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:10,560
creation process, editing,

10
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:11,820
everything like that.

11
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,560
But essentially here, the funnel

12
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:14,080
building

13
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:15,550
platforms that we like to use is

14
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:16,390
ClickFunnels.

15
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:18,309
So you can use 1.0 or 2.0.

16
00:00:18,309 --> 00:00:19,699
We like 2.0 personally.

17
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:21,500
You can use Webflow if you'd like

18
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:21,899
to.

19
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:22,989
You can use GHL.

20
00:00:22,989 --> 00:00:25,300
That's pretty much like 1.0.

21
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:26,100
ClickFunnels,

22
00:00:26,329 --> 00:00:26,850
very similar.

23
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:28,030
Or you can use Framer.

24
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:29,679
Those are all the ones we've used.

25
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:30,739
I know Perspectives,

26
00:00:30,969 --> 00:00:32,340
like another one that people are

27
00:00:32,359 --> 00:00:33,310
using right now.

28
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:34,880
Just don't use something like a

29
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:35,740
weird HubSpot

30
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:37,469
builder where you can't actually

31
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:39,149
edit mobile independently from

32
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:39,759
desktop.

33
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:40,600
It's terrible.

34
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:42,530
So make sure you're using a decent

35
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:44,390
funnel building platform if you

36
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:45,880
want to have a nice responsive

37
00:00:46,109 --> 00:00:47,659
funnel across multiple different

38
00:00:47,659 --> 00:00:48,270
devices.

39
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:49,780
And it actually looks good and

40
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:50,750
performs well.

41
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:51,880
So those

42
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,670
are what you can use for that.

43
00:00:53,799 --> 00:00:55,799
The CRMs, you can use HubSpot,

44
00:00:55,799 --> 00:00:58,640
GHL, Close, Kit, if you're only

45
00:00:58,869 --> 00:01:00,130
trying to use it for sending out

46
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:00,649
emails.

47
00:01:00,649 --> 00:01:02,200
So if you have like another sales

48
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,010
specific CRM, like I see some

49
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:06,370
people who use Close, use Kit for

50
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:08,560
the kind of CRM and like that for

51
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,799
the backend, like marketing

52
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:12,590
automations, like emails and stuff

53
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:14,010
like that and newsletters.

54
00:01:14,019 --> 00:01:15,590
And they use Close for just like

55
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:15,739
the

56
00:01:15,969 --> 00:01:16,310
sales side.

57
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:17,519
So like this is a good combo.

58
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:19,640
These two, if you want everything

59
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,420
in one spot,

60
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:22,079
HubSpot is solid and GHL is solid

61
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:22,590
as well.

62
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,400
Just to make sure again, they have

63
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,659
the ability to create

64
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:27,450
pipelines and everything like that

65
00:01:27,579 --> 00:01:29,019
to keep the sales side very nice

66
00:01:29,019 --> 00:01:30,599
and concise and trackable.

67
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:32,549
And also just make sure that they

68
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:34,560
have backend email flows that you

69
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,540
can install.

70
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:36,750
And like I said,

71
00:01:36,939 --> 00:01:38,590
if you want to keep everything

72
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:40,680
kind of in one spot, GHL is good.

73
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,950
HubSpot is pretty expensive and

74
00:01:43,189 --> 00:01:44,140
their funnel builder sucks.

75
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:45,489
So don't try to build landing

76
00:01:45,489 --> 00:01:47,480
pages and funnels on HubSpot.

77
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:47,879
It's terrible.

78
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,430
Now the different funnel elements.

79
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:52,019
So other softwares will use inside

80
00:01:52,019 --> 00:01:54,700
of the funnel is Typeform for the

81
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:55,390
application.

82
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:56,769
I know there's like you form and

83
00:01:56,769 --> 00:01:58,400
stuff like that, but to be honest,

84
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,760
Typeform is the best.

85
00:01:59,829 --> 00:02:00,909
We use Typeform all the time

86
00:02:00,909 --> 00:02:02,159
across all of our accounts.

87
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,519
We see the best cost per result,

88
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:04,269
best user

89
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:06,030
experience with Typeform.

90
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:07,569
And then also Calendly.

91
00:02:07,569 --> 00:02:09,250
I know you can use like the GHL

92
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:10,430
calendar, HubSpot

93
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:12,099
calendar, all that stuff.

94
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:13,909
Again, Calendly gets us the best

95
00:02:13,909 --> 00:02:15,039
cost per result.

96
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:17,360
So we like to use

97
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,229
Calendly there.

98
00:02:18,229 --> 00:02:19,560
And we'd like to do the Typeform

99
00:02:19,659 --> 00:02:21,300
and Calendly combo where the last

100
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,439
question after

101
00:02:22,669 --> 00:02:24,039
somebody fills out the application

102
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:25,409
on Typeform is the Calendly.

103
00:02:25,409 --> 00:02:27,000
Calendly, you can also use partial

104
00:02:27,229 --> 00:02:28,060
submit too, which is huge.

105
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:29,560
And then from there, in terms of

106
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,370
attribution and tracking, we'd

107
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:31,919
like to

108
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:32,490
use Hyros.

109
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,729
If you're using a, if you're

110
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,150
working with like an e-commerce

111
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,460
company or something like

112
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:38,159
that, Triple Whale is fantastic

113
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:39,610
for companies that are in the

114
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:41,150
e-commerce space for proper

115
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:41,830
attribution

116
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:43,860
and tracking through your ads.

117
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,210
So for most of the, most of our

118
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:46,560
clients that we use Hyros.

119
00:02:46,789 --> 00:02:49,780
And Wicked Reports is also another

120
00:02:49,789 --> 00:02:52,789
one that you could use instead of

121
00:02:52,789 --> 00:02:53,780
Hyros.

122
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:54,979
But again, personally,

123
00:02:55,129 --> 00:02:57,000
Hyros to me is the easiest to work

124
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,389
with, the best support, best team,

125
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,210
and is the most accurate.

126
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:01,419
So

127
00:03:01,659 --> 00:03:02,360
that's why we use that.

128
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,409
And then finally, for research,

129
00:03:04,409 --> 00:03:05,960
you could use an app called

130
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,759
Foreplay,

131
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:07,699
which is really cool.

132
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:08,860
It's just basically the ad

133
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:10,340
library, but more organized and on

134
00:03:10,419 --> 00:03:10,919
steroids.

135
00:03:10,979 --> 00:03:11,120
You

136
00:03:11,349 --> 00:03:12,719
could search by different topics,

137
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:14,199
competitors, stuff like that,

138
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:15,599
industries, niches to find

139
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:15,879
different

140
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:16,819
ads that are running.

141
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:17,960
And also some ads that are not

142
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,780
running anymore.

143
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,159
You'd save them to a nice folder

144
00:03:20,379 --> 00:03:22,159
for yourself for ad ideation and

145
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:22,900
all that.

146
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,009
It's very cool.

147
00:03:24,009 --> 00:03:25,789
Or you can just use the meta ad

148
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:26,389
library

149
00:03:26,469 --> 00:03:27,770
to see what your competitors are

150
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:29,189
running and get some inspiration

151
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:29,800
that way.

152
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,090
I also just like to go

153
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:32,699
through Instagram and Facebook and

154
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:33,270
save ads.

155
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:34,800
I screen, I screen record them,

156
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,759
screenshot them,

157
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:37,439
save them to a little folder.

158
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:38,789
I'll DM them to people.

159
00:03:38,789 --> 00:03:40,330
And you know, if I see an ad or

160
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:40,900
some sort

161
00:03:40,969 --> 00:03:42,280
of messaging that I really like

162
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,870
that grabs my attention, I'll take

163
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:45,719
note of it, save it, ideate for

164
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:45,900
later.
