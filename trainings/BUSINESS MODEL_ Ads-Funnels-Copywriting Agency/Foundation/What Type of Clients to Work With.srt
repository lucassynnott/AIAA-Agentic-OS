1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,220
So as an advertising agency you

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:04,469
have to be able to pick the right

3
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:06,799
clients to go after the right

4
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:08,390
types of clients the right niche

5
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:09,919
the right vertical and of course

6
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:11,089
like the right actual

7
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:12,640
characteristics of the actual

8
00:00:12,669 --> 00:00:14,289
client itself you have to be able

9
00:00:14,289 --> 00:00:15,570
to identify the right one

10
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,219
uh if not trust me it's going to

11
00:00:17,269 --> 00:00:18,620
be a mess you're going to be

12
00:00:18,739 --> 00:00:20,679
working with very broke people

13
00:00:21,089 --> 00:00:22,359
poor people who don't have enough

14
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:23,760
money to spend on advertising so

15
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,960
you're sitting there like trying

16
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:26,949
to pull a rabbit out of a hat

17
00:00:26,949 --> 00:00:28,149
every single month and trying to

18
00:00:28,149 --> 00:00:29,449
make something work with a small

19
00:00:29,739 --> 00:00:31,140
budget and you're taking meetings

20
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:32,670
all day long they're facetiming

21
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:33,929
you at midnight and all this

22
00:00:34,229 --> 00:00:35,759
stuff and you don't want that okay

23
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:37,369
so we're going to talk about in

24
00:00:37,369 --> 00:00:39,420
this quick video here what types

25
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,380
of clients what verticals niches

26
00:00:41,469 --> 00:00:43,210
and characteristics of good

27
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:45,030
clients you should go after so

28
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:45,560
first off

29
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:47,460
the actual niches let's talk about

30
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,159
that because everyone loves that

31
00:00:49,159 --> 00:00:50,689
okay um personally I like to

32
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,820
go after high ticket businesses so

33
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,719
that could be b2b that could be

34
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:56,799
you know different like agencies

35
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,359
that could be even sas companies

36
00:00:58,359 --> 00:00:59,829
that have a high ticket front end

37
00:00:59,829 --> 00:01:01,380
offer that could be info products

38
00:01:01,609 --> 00:01:02,990
that could be coaches we even have

39
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:04,459
some like real estate funds and

40
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:06,120
syndications that we work with

41
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,590
too but anything on the front end

42
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:09,140
where they're selling something

43
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:10,590
expensive so usually like five

44
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:12,359
thousand dollars plus that they

45
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:14,060
get in their pocket per sale is

46
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:17,040
what we like to focus on now you

47
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:17,340
can

48
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:18,519
make it work with you know like

49
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:19,819
local businesses and stuff like

50
00:01:19,819 --> 00:01:21,049
that there's a lot of people I

51
00:01:21,049 --> 00:01:21,590
know that do

52
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:23,340
that um just make sure that it's

53
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,200
more of like a higher ticket local

54
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,640
business where it's something

55
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:28,120
like roofing or it's something

56
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,659
like HVAC where they're actually

57
00:01:29,719 --> 00:01:31,109
like getting a higher ticket

58
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:32,670
thing it's not working with like

59
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:34,159
coffee shops or restaurants or

60
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,519
stuff as much as I would love to

61
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:35,609
tell

62
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,769
you to work with restaurants

63
00:01:36,769 --> 00:01:38,129
because that was actually my first

64
00:01:38,129 --> 00:01:39,219
you know client my parents

65
00:01:39,219 --> 00:01:39,599
restaurant

66
00:01:39,829 --> 00:01:41,079
when I started out advertising

67
00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:42,510
that was the first one but look

68
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:44,180
their margins are too low their

69
00:01:44,269 --> 00:01:44,519
average

70
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:45,579
ticket size is too low and you

71
00:01:45,579 --> 00:01:46,840
just don't want to be working with

72
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,469
people like that so pretty much I

73
00:01:49,469 --> 00:01:50,099
would focus on

74
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,349
something especially when you're

75
00:01:52,349 --> 00:01:54,280
just starting out targeting a

76
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,700
niche or business that has high

77
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:57,019
ticket

78
00:01:57,299 --> 00:01:58,840
prices and they're pocketing again

79
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,420
five thousand dollars plus and

80
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,459
ideally a ten thousand dollar plus

81
00:02:02,469 --> 00:02:03,040
LTV

82
00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:05,489
per sale per customer per client

83
00:02:05,489 --> 00:02:07,739
that I get that's going to make

84
00:02:07,739 --> 00:02:10,538
your life so much easier now in

85
00:02:10,538 --> 00:02:11,219
terms of

86
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:13,039
the characteristics of a good

87
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:14,629
client I don't like to take

88
00:02:14,629 --> 00:02:16,659
anybody on personally that can't

89
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:17,500
spend less than

90
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:19,460
two hundred fifty dollars per day

91
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:21,090
in ads why is that well if they

92
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:23,280
have less than two fifty they

93
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:23,580
usually

94
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,930
don't have a like decent marketing

95
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:28,069
budget and they're really in that

96
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:30,219
case and they're really at that

97
00:02:30,219 --> 00:02:30,389
time

98
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,430
like pretty cash strapped so what

99
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:34,050
I mean by that is like if they

100
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:36,000
only have three thousand dollars

101
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:36,340
to spend

102
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:38,060
on ads and on a super tight budget

103
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,680
it's probably not a good idea for

104
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,319
you to take them on it's probably

105
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:41,479
not

106
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,229
even a good idea for them to run

107
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:45,080
ads right now because ads do take

108
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:47,080
a little bit of time to crack

109
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,310
it's not that whole thing where

110
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:49,479
it's like oh I gotta season the

111
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:51,860
pixel for 30 days no but look you

112
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:52,000
might

113
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,139
run ads you might launch a few ads

114
00:02:54,139 --> 00:02:56,830
and not get any sales in for 14 21

115
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:58,789
days sometimes even look it could

116
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,780
be 30 days and stuff like that and

117
00:03:00,789 --> 00:03:02,439
you need a business that ideally

118
00:03:02,509 --> 00:03:04,099
is already running ads that you

119
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:04,460
can help

120
00:03:04,729 --> 00:03:06,080
them do it better or they've

121
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,050
experimented with ads or they've

122
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:09,740
scaled to a point where they're at

123
00:03:10,009 --> 00:03:12,419
like 30k 40k 50k plus per month

124
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:14,419
they have the good LTV they have

125
00:03:14,419 --> 00:03:15,580
the good average ticket price

126
00:03:15,849 --> 00:03:18,259
and from there you can just help

127
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:20,680
them say hey you're crushing it on

128
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:22,539
organic you're crushing it on cold

129
00:03:22,819 --> 00:03:23,759
outreach you're crushing it on

130
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:25,210
whatever other channel um you can

131
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,009
take some of that budget now

132
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,639
you can now move what should I say

133
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:33,409
this you can now essentially just

134
00:03:33,409 --> 00:03:35,550
run ads because you have that

135
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:37,189
fifty thousand dollar a month

136
00:03:37,189 --> 00:03:38,800
revenue coming in you can put a

137
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,180
healthy 5 10k budget into ads

138
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:41,580
right now and

139
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,000
it's not your last dollar you're

140
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,469
not really they're not going to be

141
00:03:44,469 --> 00:03:45,580
too worried right if you're

142
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:45,819
working

143
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,650
with a business that is doing 10

144
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:49,599
20k a month and you're asking them

145
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,419
to put 250 a day in the ads

146
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:53,580
even 200 or 150 they're probably

147
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,020
going to be super worried about

148
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:56,219
that budget and it's just gonna be

149
00:03:56,219 --> 00:03:56,300
a

150
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:58,039
total nightmare working with them

151
00:03:58,039 --> 00:03:59,479
and yet it's not what you want

152
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:01,900
whatsoever so uh at the same time

153
00:04:02,129 --> 00:04:04,039
too i've seen some people go after

154
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:06,199
businesses that are you know very

155
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:09,259
low ticket size low LTV and they

156
00:04:09,469 --> 00:04:10,939
don't have a big budget it's a

157
00:04:10,939 --> 00:04:12,689
super easy sell but they churn

158
00:04:12,689 --> 00:04:14,360
after a month or two and it's the

159
00:04:14,669 --> 00:04:15,360
absolute

160
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:17,930
worst nightmare working with them

161
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:19,920
so again pick a niche that has

162
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,839
some sort of high LTV some sort of

163
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,269
offer that has a higher ticket

164
00:04:23,269 --> 00:04:24,660
price and of course it's something

165
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:25,740
that people actually

166
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:27,509
want at this current point you get

167
00:04:27,509 --> 00:04:29,160
bonus points if you're working

168
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,019
with a company that's in like a

169
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:32,639
space that the grand narrative is

170
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:34,379
really flowing with you like right

171
00:04:34,379 --> 00:04:36,100
now ai right ai is everywhere

172
00:04:36,379 --> 00:04:37,689
so if you're working with a high

173
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,069
ticket business that has a good

174
00:04:39,129 --> 00:04:40,379
LTV and a good ticket price

175
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:42,339
and it's in the ai space and it's

176
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:44,089
in the ai space i mean that's

177
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:46,060
fantastic that's an absolute

178
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,019
recipe

179
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:48,639
for a winning offer for a winning

180
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,019
product and for winning ads

181
00:04:50,019 --> 00:04:51,819
because a lot of people want that

182
00:04:52,089 --> 00:04:53,439
thing you know if you're selling

183
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:55,000
like newspaper ads right now or

184
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,399
placements on magazines or

185
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:56,899
something

186
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,550
it's probably gonna be a little

187
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:00,040
tough even if your LTV is high and

188
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,569
even if your average ticket price

189
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:01,680
is

190
00:05:02,009 --> 00:05:03,420
high you're gonna want to find

191
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:05,329
something that again people want

192
00:05:05,329 --> 00:05:07,180
or morph it or morph that offer

193
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:07,579
into

194
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,319
something that or morph that offer

195
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:11,100
into something that people want so

196
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,660
those are the characteristics and

197
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:12,779
of

198
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,529
course i always like to vet the

199
00:05:14,529 --> 00:05:16,379
actual clients that we work with

200
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:18,300
where i say hey is this person

201
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,829
you always selling something

202
00:05:19,829 --> 00:05:21,170
ethical of course are they

203
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:23,339
actually nice to talk to because a

204
00:05:23,339 --> 00:05:23,899
lot of this

205
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,350
time because a lot of times i've

206
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:26,860
worked with clients and i'm like

207
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,620
yeah this person just does not

208
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:29,920
like i don't really vibe with them

209
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,699
too much they seem pretty like

210
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,709
schizo all the time they're

211
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:35,589
bouncing around ideas and stuff

212
00:05:35,589 --> 00:05:37,250
they can't just fixate on one

213
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:38,459
thing and you don't want to work

214
00:05:38,459 --> 00:05:38,689
with that

215
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:39,689
you want to work with level-headed

216
00:05:39,689 --> 00:05:40,629
people in this space especially

217
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:41,720
when you're handling their paid

218
00:05:42,019 --> 00:05:43,170
traffic and you want to pre-frame

219
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:44,410
them to that hey this is not going

220
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,060
to be all rainbows and sunshine

221
00:05:46,209 --> 00:05:47,279
all day long so you know we're

222
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:48,750
very good at analyzing bottlenecks

223
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,220
and fixing things when they go

224
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:50,860
wrong

225
00:05:51,009 --> 00:05:51,910
but um you know you have to

226
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:53,329
understand that paid ads is a game

227
00:05:53,329 --> 00:05:54,540
that you start right now and

228
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:54,689
you're

229
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:56,519
never going to end right so those

230
00:05:56,519 --> 00:05:58,389
are the characteristics of what i

231
00:05:58,389 --> 00:06:00,209
would look for in a client

232
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,839
make sure that they are easy to

233
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:03,540
work with they're very you know

234
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:05,300
for lack of better terms very

235
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:05,740
chill

236
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,550
um of course they have the healthy

237
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:09,259
budget to be able to spend on ads

238
00:06:09,259 --> 00:06:09,980
and they're in that

239
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,910
sort of high ticket space that's

240
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,180
what i would go after
