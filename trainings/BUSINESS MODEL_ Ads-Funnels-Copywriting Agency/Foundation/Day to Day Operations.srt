1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:01,510
So what are the day-to-day

2
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:03,509
operations and just the day-to-day

3
00:00:03,509 --> 00:00:05,400
look like running a advertising

4
00:00:05,769 --> 00:00:06,400
agency like I do?

5
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,490
So pretty much all as it is, is

6
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:10,980
you're either ideating new ads.

7
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:11,500
So you're

8
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:13,130
basically scripting some ads,

9
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:14,929
you're making tweaks to a funnel.

10
00:00:14,929 --> 00:00:16,109
How'd you run that?

11
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,469
So we'll

12
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:18,710
kind of start it where, so we'll

13
00:00:18,789 --> 00:00:20,010
kind of start at the beginning,

14
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:20,379
right?

15
00:00:20,379 --> 00:00:21,480
So if you just bring on a

16
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,000
client, what are you going to have

17
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:23,280
to do?

18
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:24,769
Now, usually there's one of two

19
00:00:24,769 --> 00:00:25,250
things.

20
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:25,739
One is if

21
00:00:25,739 --> 00:00:27,149
they've never run ads before,

22
00:00:27,149 --> 00:00:28,829
they're not currently running ads,

23
00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:30,399
nothing like that, you're

24
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:32,359
essentially setting everything up

25
00:00:32,359 --> 00:00:33,270
from scratch.

26
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:34,920
So we're not that type of agency

27
00:00:34,979 --> 00:00:35,320
that's going

28
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,899
to be like, yeah, we only work on

29
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:37,409
the ads.

30
00:00:37,409 --> 00:00:38,030
That's it.

31
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:39,049
We only run the ads.

32
00:00:39,049 --> 00:00:39,840
We only touch

33
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:40,539
the ads manager.

34
00:00:40,539 --> 00:00:41,500
We don't touch the funnel.

35
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,619
That's not how you're going to get

36
00:00:42,619 --> 00:00:43,140
good results

37
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:43,619
for clients.

38
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:44,909
It's not how you're going to have

39
00:00:44,909 --> 00:00:45,340
good LTV.

40
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:46,759
That's not how you can charge high

41
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:48,170
prices for what you do.

42
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:49,979
So we essentially sit down and we

43
00:00:49,979 --> 00:00:51,880
will make the entire funnel for

44
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:52,200
them.

45
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:53,530
So that's all the landing pages.

46
00:00:53,549 --> 00:00:54,789
We'll ideate the funnel for them

47
00:00:54,789 --> 00:00:55,070
too.

48
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:55,649
Like, are we

49
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:56,820
doing a webinar funnel, a call

50
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:57,899
funnel, a low ticket product

51
00:00:57,899 --> 00:00:59,149
funnel, a challenge funnel?

52
00:00:59,159 --> 00:00:59,340
Like,

53
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:00,840
what are we doing for you exactly?

54
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:01,439
Depending.

55
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:02,640
And that all depends on their

56
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,850
offer, their current

57
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,659
situation, their budget too, is a

58
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:06,329
big thing.

59
00:01:06,329 --> 00:01:08,069
So we'll sit down, make the funnel

60
00:01:08,069 --> 00:01:08,780
for them.

61
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:08,959
That

62
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:10,609
means we're designing all the

63
00:01:10,629 --> 00:01:12,609
landing pages totally bespoke to,

64
00:01:12,609 --> 00:01:13,790
you know, we build on

65
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:14,819
ClickFunnels,

66
00:01:14,819 --> 00:01:17,430
Webflow, GHL, whatever platform

67
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:19,769
really we do frame or two, but we

68
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:22,359
like to have our preferred list.

69
00:01:22,359 --> 00:01:23,480
So we like to, so we like to

70
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,540
basically bias towards

71
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,400
ClickFunnels 2.0 initially.

72
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,099
That's just like what

73
00:01:27,099 --> 00:01:28,290
we use and what we see good

74
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:29,090
results on.

75
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:30,870
But anyways, we'll sit down, build

76
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:32,049
their full funnel,

77
00:01:32,489 --> 00:01:33,879
design all their landing pages,

78
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:35,310
write all of the copy.

79
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:37,030
And from there, we're going to

80
00:01:37,069 --> 00:01:38,200
make their VSL

81
00:01:38,609 --> 00:01:39,299
typically too, if it's a VSL

82
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:39,719
funnel.

83
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:40,810
So we're going to script it or

84
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:42,290
outline it for them, send it back

85
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:42,480
to

86
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:42,829
them.

87
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:44,280
And we handle all the editing too.

88
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:45,680
That's again, another thing we

89
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,739
like to be this full stack

90
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:48,819
in-house on the paid media side,

91
00:01:48,819 --> 00:01:50,000
full stack team.

92
00:01:50,019 --> 00:01:51,950
So we don't want them to have to

93
00:01:51,989 --> 00:01:52,980
essentially like

94
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,290
look for other partners for video

95
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:55,719
editing, for funnel building, for

96
00:01:55,719 --> 00:01:56,659
landing page design,

97
00:01:56,659 --> 00:01:58,019
for copywriting, none of that.

98
00:01:58,019 --> 00:01:59,349
We want to bring it all in-house.

99
00:01:59,349 --> 00:02:01,170
So we know one, the messaging and

100
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:01,290
the

101
00:02:01,299 --> 00:02:02,500
style is congruent through the

102
00:02:02,569 --> 00:02:03,739
entire funnel so we can get them

103
00:02:03,739 --> 00:02:04,540
the best results.

104
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:05,200
But then two,

105
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,849
it also makes our service way more

106
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:08,449
sticky because we're handling

107
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:09,719
everything, right?

108
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:10,849
If they churned or

109
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,469
they cancel, they're losing the

110
00:02:12,469 --> 00:02:13,969
video editing team for the paid

111
00:02:13,969 --> 00:02:15,860
media, their ad team, their funnel

112
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,430
team, their landing page team, all

113
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:18,909
this stuff, their copywriters,

114
00:02:18,909 --> 00:02:20,490
even all the backend email flows,

115
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:20,860
right?

116
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:21,979
They're losing all of that.

117
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:23,270
So that's how we really like build

118
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:24,659
the hooks into their business.

119
00:02:24,659 --> 00:02:26,009
And we can have such low churn.

120
00:02:26,009 --> 00:02:27,270
Like we don't have, we have way

121
00:02:27,349 --> 00:02:28,539
less than 10% churn.

122
00:02:28,539 --> 00:02:29,740
We've had

123
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,490
actually one client all of 2025 so

124
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:32,949
far.

125
00:02:32,949 --> 00:02:35,449
I'm filming this on August 10th.

126
00:02:35,449 --> 00:02:38,259
We had one client churn and we

127
00:02:38,669 --> 00:02:39,650
actually refunded them.

128
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:40,849
So he was a nightmare.

129
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,349
I didn't follow any of the best

130
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,340
practices that I

131
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,129
talked about of finding a good

132
00:02:45,229 --> 00:02:46,900
client in the past module.

133
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,240
So we refunded him and yeah, so

134
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,120
you have

135
00:02:50,389 --> 00:02:51,860
very low churn when you have all

136
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:53,680
this stuff that you can take care

137
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,009
of.

138
00:02:54,009 --> 00:02:55,780
And I'll talk about team in a

139
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,580
sec here and what it looks like,

140
00:02:57,669 --> 00:02:59,550
but you can still have a very lean

141
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:00,960
team with all of this.

142
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,659
So again,

143
00:03:01,659 --> 00:03:02,939
new client, they had never run ads

144
00:03:02,939 --> 00:03:03,330
before.

145
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,490
We're going to build their full

146
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:05,280
funnel for them.

147
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,960
We're also going to sit down and

148
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,219
ideate the actual ads.

149
00:03:08,219 --> 00:03:09,800
So we're going to go through and

150
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:09,919
say,

151
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:10,680
okay, cool.

152
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,139
Here are a bunch of different ad

153
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,860
angles that we want to go after.

154
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:14,889
And we think

155
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,509
could work with your, and we think

156
00:03:16,509 --> 00:03:17,949
it'd work with your offer could

157
00:03:17,949 --> 00:03:19,180
resonate with your target

158
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:19,919
audience.

159
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:21,569
And also we'll look at their sales

160
00:03:21,569 --> 00:03:22,030
calls.

161
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:23,689
If they have them ideally, even if

162
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:24,439
it's through like

163
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:26,020
cold outreach or something, if

164
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:27,520
they have sales calls or client

165
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,180
feedback forums, we'll look at

166
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:29,419
those

167
00:03:29,419 --> 00:03:30,469
and say, okay, cool.

168
00:03:30,469 --> 00:03:31,379
Why did people buy?

169
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:32,479
Why did they book a call?

170
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:33,840
Why were they interested?

171
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,120
What problems were they dealing

172
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:35,449
with?

173
00:03:35,449 --> 00:03:36,530
What things do they want?

174
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:37,840
What dream states do they want?

175
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,539
And we'll reverse engineer those

176
00:03:39,539 --> 00:03:40,629
into the ad script.

177
00:03:40,629 --> 00:03:42,300
So we'll make the ad scripts.

178
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,050
Then we'll send it

179
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:45,080
back to them and they'll send it

180
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:45,599
to us.

181
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:46,840
We'll edit them.

182
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,919
And then from there, now we have

183
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:49,520
the ads

184
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:50,689
completed on the front end.

185
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:52,129
We have the full funnel completed.

186
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:53,449
And then after that, we're going

187
00:03:53,449 --> 00:03:53,840
to start

188
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,550
to ideate some things like backend

189
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:56,740
email flows and content

190
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,580
remarketing and things along those

191
00:03:58,580 --> 00:03:58,939
nature,

192
00:03:59,909 --> 00:04:01,039
depending on the client itself.

193
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:02,560
If they have those in place, we'll

194
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,199
CRO them.

195
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:04,419
If they do not have them

196
00:04:04,419 --> 00:04:05,550
in place, then we'll build them

197
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:06,110
out for them.

198
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:07,340
So yes, we're like writing emails

199
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:08,340
for them and stuff too,

200
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,129
because our job again, to make us

201
00:04:10,129 --> 00:04:11,789
very valuable as an agency, we

202
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,469
don't just sit there in the ads

203
00:04:13,889 --> 00:04:14,159
manager.

204
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:15,969
We get people to book in calls and

205
00:04:15,969 --> 00:04:17,699
we really want to put in, and we

206
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:18,800
really want to put

207
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,990
marketing systems and automations

208
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:22,790
in place to help them get those

209
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:24,740
people to show up to the call and

210
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:25,110
buy

211
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:25,569
as well.

212
00:04:25,569 --> 00:04:26,910
So we'll also consult on like the

213
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,670
sales process.

214
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:28,889
That's another thing too.

215
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:29,819
If I see the

216
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,209
sales team is just being super

217
00:04:31,209 --> 00:04:32,529
lazy, they're sending very

218
00:04:32,529 --> 00:04:34,019
generic, one-sided, selfish

219
00:04:34,019 --> 00:04:34,759
follow-up.

220
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:35,860
They're not actually even

221
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,310
following up with leads or calling

222
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:38,509
them before the sales call in

223
00:04:38,509 --> 00:04:38,879
general,

224
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:40,569
or sending them assets before the

225
00:04:40,569 --> 00:04:40,990
call.

226
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:42,649
Then I will, you know, more than

227
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:43,149
happy.

228
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:44,000
I will sit down with

229
00:04:44,269 --> 00:04:45,800
that sales team, light a fire in

230
00:04:45,889 --> 00:04:47,750
their ass, or I'll tell the actual

231
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,680
client itself and say, Hey, look,

232
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,540
your sales process really needs

233
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:52,139
some help.

234
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:53,680
Here's some things that we should

235
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,649
work on over the next

236
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:55,439
few weeks.

237
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:57,589
So that right there, again, makes

238
00:04:57,589 --> 00:04:59,300
us more valuable as an agency

239
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:00,759
because we're not just

240
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:02,139
pushing buttons in the ads

241
00:05:02,139 --> 00:05:02,769
manager.

242
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:04,389
If you see anything, any theme

243
00:05:04,389 --> 00:05:05,939
that I have in this course so

244
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:07,540
far, it's telling you to succeed

245
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,279
as an advertising agency, running

246
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:11,220
ads and making funnels for people.

247
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,019
It's to see other areas that you

248
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:14,899
can basically plug holes in the

249
00:05:14,899 --> 00:05:16,860
business and give value to them

250
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,269
because that allows you to charge

251
00:05:18,269 --> 00:05:19,019
higher prices.

252
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:20,620
Like we're charging 15 K a month

253
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,639
with a 10% net rev share component

254
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:23,959
on top of that as well.

255
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:25,500
Sometimes on top of it, sometimes

256
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:27,189
either or, but we're able to

257
00:05:27,189 --> 00:05:29,180
charge those high prices because

258
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:31,100
again, we're coming in as this

259
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:31,439
almost

260
00:05:31,709 --> 00:05:33,350
like fractional CMO ish on the, on

261
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:34,689
the actual paid side.

262
00:05:34,689 --> 00:05:36,560
Like we're handling so much stuff

263
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:36,959
from

264
00:05:37,269 --> 00:05:37,889
click to close.

265
00:05:37,889 --> 00:05:39,519
We're just not taking the sales

266
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:40,019
calls.

267
00:05:40,019 --> 00:05:41,819
So that's what I would do if you,

268
00:05:41,819 --> 00:05:42,259
so that's

269
00:05:42,569 --> 00:05:43,339
pretty much what we do.

270
00:05:43,339 --> 00:05:44,660
If you have a new client that has

271
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:46,029
never run ads before, if you have

272
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:46,319
a client

273
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:48,230
who has ran ads or is currently

274
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:50,290
running ads, we'll sit there,

275
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:52,259
basically look at all the data

276
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:52,439
that

277
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:53,939
they have for the past seven days,

278
00:05:53,939 --> 00:05:55,850
14 days, 30 days, plus we'll find

279
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:57,180
where the bottlenecks are.

280
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,750
Maybe we'll have to completely

281
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,370
change up the front end offer.

282
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:01,879
Maybe we'll just have to change

283
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:02,040
the

284
00:06:02,339 --> 00:06:03,089
funnel up a little bit.

285
00:06:03,089 --> 00:06:04,399
The funnel structure will make

286
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:05,250
them a new funnel.

287
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,389
Sometimes it's more just

288
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:08,050
like seeing what's wrong in that

289
00:06:08,069 --> 00:06:09,519
sense and plugging holes.

290
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:11,279
So you can unlock scale there.

291
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:12,759
So we use data,

292
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:14,110
of course, to see like where the

293
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:15,149
actual bottleneck is.

294
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,439
So we'll look at all the key.

295
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:18,420
So we'll look at all the key KPIs

296
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,209
across the entire funnel,

297
00:06:20,209 --> 00:06:22,680
everything from like click-through

298
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,139
rate

299
00:06:23,139 --> 00:06:25,250
to CPMs to unique page visitors,

300
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,370
the application rate, book call

301
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:29,879
rate, cost per call, show rate,

302
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:31,649
close rate, AOV, ROAS, all this

303
00:06:31,649 --> 00:06:32,139
stuff.

304
00:06:32,139 --> 00:06:33,850
We'll see where the bottleneck is

305
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:35,259
and we'll, that's the,

306
00:06:35,259 --> 00:06:36,620
and then that's the first thing

307
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:37,839
that we attack, right?

308
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:39,509
So that's, if you have a client

309
00:06:39,509 --> 00:06:39,779
that's

310
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:40,920
already running ads, it's just a

311
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,209
little bit different positioning.

312
00:06:42,209 --> 00:06:43,360
You're essentially still

313
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,269
installing your best practices

314
00:06:45,269 --> 00:06:46,959
into their paid advertising

315
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:48,560
system, but it's not just

316
00:06:48,579 --> 00:06:50,029
like totally building everything

317
00:06:50,029 --> 00:06:50,709
from scratch.

318
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:52,079
They might have some things that

319
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:52,600
you just need

320
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,300
to optimize to unlock scale and

321
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,319
unlock growth.

322
00:07:00,259 --> 00:07:01,449
But what does the day-to-day

323
00:07:01,529 --> 00:07:02,540
actually look like?

324
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:04,259
So first off, you shouldn't be in

325
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:04,769
the heads of

326
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:06,230
manager for hours every single

327
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:06,569
day.

328
00:07:06,579 --> 00:07:08,079
You, or if you have a media buyer

329
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:09,680
on your team, you should not be

330
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,259
doing that whatsoever.

331
00:07:11,259 --> 00:07:13,259
Max, I spend on a given week about

332
00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:14,829
five hours inside of the ad

333
00:07:14,829 --> 00:07:15,819
accounts.

334
00:07:15,819 --> 00:07:16,439
And we

335
00:07:16,819 --> 00:07:18,509
manage like 20 plus accounts right

336
00:07:18,509 --> 00:07:19,819
now on a done fee basis.

337
00:07:19,819 --> 00:07:21,759
And I have eyes into about 30 plus

338
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:22,120
more

339
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,060
on top of that, uh, on our done

340
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:25,379
with you program.

341
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:27,759
So I don't spend more than five

342
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:28,930
hours inside of

343
00:07:29,019 --> 00:07:30,000
the ad accounts.

344
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,459
So really your day-to-day is

345
00:07:31,459 --> 00:07:33,189
looking at the performance of the

346
00:07:33,189 --> 00:07:34,379
marketing system

347
00:07:34,379 --> 00:07:35,579
as a whole.

348
00:07:35,649 --> 00:07:37,160
So from a to Z.

349
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:40,079
So from click to close, I like to

350
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:42,879
gather metrics across all of our

351
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:43,220
client

352
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:43,680
accounts.

353
00:07:43,699 --> 00:07:44,720
And then from there, I'm just

354
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,959
sitting down every day and saying,

355
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:46,759
all right, cool.

356
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,420
Where's the bottleneck on this

357
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:48,870
funnel?

358
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:50,329
Oh, the application rates low.

359
00:07:50,329 --> 00:07:50,889
Okay, cool.

360
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:51,730
How are we

361
00:07:52,009 --> 00:07:53,410
going to fix the application rate?

362
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:53,800
Okay.

363
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,250
We're going to do X, Y, and Z.

364
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:55,790
Awesome.

365
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:56,800
Then we go and do X,

366
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,709
Y, and Z, right?

367
00:07:57,709 --> 00:07:59,180
Sometimes we'll need to make new

368
00:07:59,180 --> 00:07:59,500
ads.

369
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,170
If we're hitting like ad fatigue,

370
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:01,740
for example,

371
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,870
that means if our current cost per

372
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:05,930
result that we see in the results

373
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:08,550
column on meta is increasing

374
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,180
and our result volume is

375
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:12,269
decreasing, that means we have ad

376
00:08:12,269 --> 00:08:12,990
fatigue.

377
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:14,879
So therefore now we have to make

378
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:15,389
new ads.

379
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,889
So we'll either pull some that we

380
00:08:16,889 --> 00:08:18,500
have from the vault that's sitting

381
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,459
like a Google drive

382
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,899
for one of our clients, or we'll

383
00:08:20,899 --> 00:08:22,420
hit the client up and say, Hey, we

384
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:24,000
need you to film these ads for us.

385
00:08:24,019 --> 00:08:24,980
When can you get them done for

386
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:25,519
eight hours?

387
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:25,800
Cool.

388
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,209
Awesome.

389
00:08:26,209 --> 00:08:26,730
Send it back.

390
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:27,790
And we'll send it off to an

391
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:28,350
editor.

392
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:30,120
They edit, we relaunch the ads.

393
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,610
But the whole thing is running

394
00:08:31,699 --> 00:08:32,840
this type of agency.

395
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,360
Again,

396
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,990
you're acting like a marketer.

397
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:35,399
Okay.

398
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:37,120
You're not sitting there just like

399
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,798
a media buyer working inside of

400
00:08:38,798 --> 00:08:40,000
meta ads manager or whatever

401
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:41,340
platform you're working on.

402
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:42,570
You're not just like pushing

403
00:08:42,658 --> 00:08:43,320
buttons in there all

404
00:08:43,379 --> 00:08:43,710
day.

405
00:08:43,788 --> 00:08:45,029
You're looking at these full

406
00:08:45,049 --> 00:08:46,360
funnels and seeing where the

407
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:47,730
bottleneck is on the entire

408
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:48,059
funnel.

409
00:08:48,059 --> 00:08:49,539
Is the click through rate super

410
00:08:49,539 --> 00:08:49,860
high?

411
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:51,029
Is the show rate low?

412
00:08:51,029 --> 00:08:52,279
Is the close rate low?

413
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:53,639
Is the application

414
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:54,159
rate low?

415
00:08:54,269 --> 00:08:55,840
Like what's the actual bottleneck?

416
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,090
And then you need to be able to

417
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:59,159
identify what you need to do

418
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:00,230
to solve that bottleneck.

419
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:00,720
That's it.

420
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,769
That's all we do on a day to day

421
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:02,129
basis.

422
00:09:02,129 --> 00:09:03,679
And from there, maybe I'm

423
00:09:04,129 --> 00:09:05,429
managing like our video editors.

424
00:09:05,429 --> 00:09:06,779
I'm seeing, okay, cool.

425
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:08,360
Why are you taking forever on this

426
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:08,820
one?

427
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:09,320
Hey,

428
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,100
can you quality check this one?

429
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,000
You know, I'm looking at different

430
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,529
funnel performances and I'm

431
00:09:14,539 --> 00:09:15,580
like, okay, cool.

432
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:17,110
The application rates low on this

433
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:17,429
one.

434
00:09:17,429 --> 00:09:19,059
So let's check the congruency with

435
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:19,639
the ads in

436
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:20,330
the funnel.

437
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:20,950
Oh, okay.

438
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:22,480
The ad is saying, we're going to

439
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,090
help you fix your show rates where

440
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:25,129
the funnel is

441
00:09:25,139 --> 00:09:26,669
then saying, we're going to help

442
00:09:26,669 --> 00:09:27,909
you fix your close rates.

443
00:09:27,909 --> 00:09:29,320
There's pure incongruency.

444
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,179
Let's change up

445
00:09:30,179 --> 00:09:31,110
the headline, right?

446
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:32,450
So it's just making minor tweaks.

447
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:33,570
Once you have the full system

448
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:34,159
installed,

449
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:35,899
and that's how you unlock scale.

450
00:09:35,899 --> 00:09:37,409
It's analyzing data on a day to

451
00:09:37,409 --> 00:09:39,159
day basis and then saying, cool,

452
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:40,860
this is the one thing that I need

453
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,710
to change in this funnel to unlock

454
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:44,340
scale and unlock growth.

455
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:45,970
And then you make a plan and you

456
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:47,600
go execute and attack that.

457
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,620
But again, it's coming from a full

458
00:09:49,929 --> 00:09:51,169
level, high level marketing

459
00:09:51,169 --> 00:09:51,980
standpoint.

460
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:53,620
You're not just saying, Ooh, I

461
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:55,019
need to get my click-through rate

462
00:09:55,019 --> 00:09:55,289
up.

463
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:56,799
Ooh, I need to get my CPMs down.

464
00:09:56,799 --> 00:09:58,379
Like none of that stuff, right?

465
00:09:58,379 --> 00:09:59,820
You might have to do that at a

466
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:01,009
certain time if that's the

467
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,769
bottleneck, but you need it to be,

468
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:04,340
but in this position and in this

469
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:04,759
job and

470
00:10:05,139 --> 00:10:06,289
running this agency, you need to

471
00:10:06,289 --> 00:10:07,659
be able to take a step back from

472
00:10:07,659 --> 00:10:09,559
the entire system, look at the

473
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:09,840
entire

474
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:11,639
system as a whole and say, okay,

475
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:12,100
cool.

476
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,720
These are the bottlenecks.

477
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,620
I need to go attack this one thing

478
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:16,340
this week.

479
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:17,980
Do I need to get the client to do

480
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,500
something like film ads?

481
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,139
Yes or no.

482
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,059
If no, cool.

483
00:10:21,059 --> 00:10:22,139
I need to direct my team to do

484
00:10:22,139 --> 00:10:22,710
something.

485
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:24,000
We need to change up this landing

486
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,320
page.

487
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:25,220
We need to redesign

488
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:26,700
this landing page, change up the

489
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:27,970
copy on this landing page.

490
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:29,509
We need to add some backend email

491
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:30,710
flows because the show rates low,

492
00:10:30,789 --> 00:10:31,129
right?

493
00:10:31,129 --> 00:10:31,820
Stuff like that.

494
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:32,909
So that's what your day-to-day

495
00:10:32,909 --> 00:10:33,519
looks like.

496
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:35,309
There's no like set sort of things

497
00:10:35,409 --> 00:10:36,700
that I personally do on a

498
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:37,870
day-to-day basis.

499
00:10:37,879 --> 00:10:38,919
I still block off

500
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:40,460
half the day for us to actually be

501
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:41,779
able to focus on growing our

502
00:10:41,779 --> 00:10:42,419
agency.

503
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,330
Then the other half is looking at

504
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:46,320
the current client campaigns,

505
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,720
current client data.

506
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,860
Like we have one

507
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:50,529
spec, like we have one team member

508
00:10:50,549 --> 00:10:52,129
on, like we have one member on our

509
00:10:52,129 --> 00:10:53,490
team that we call the data

510
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:54,309
scientist.

511
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:55,870
So all is she does is she sits

512
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:57,850
there and updates these metrics in

513
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:59,320
these spreadsheets for

514
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,389
our client campaigns and the

515
00:11:00,389 --> 00:11:01,120
performance of it.

516
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:02,419
So I can look at a spreadsheet and

517
00:11:02,419 --> 00:11:03,720
say, ah, okay,

518
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,240
the show rates low on this

519
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:05,960
account.

520
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,460
Cool.

521
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:07,679
What are we doing?

522
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:09,690
Oh, we don't have backend email

523
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:10,240
flows in

524
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:10,649
place.

525
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:11,519
All right, cool.

526
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:12,190
Copywriter.

527
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:13,570
Can you go write these in the next

528
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:14,289
72 hours?

529
00:11:14,289 --> 00:11:15,440
And then we'll install

530
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:16,600
them into our HubSpot.

531
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,070
So they have automated workflows

532
00:11:18,139 --> 00:11:19,519
and automated emails that are

533
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:20,179
firing up the

534
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:21,659
prospects before the call that

535
00:11:21,659 --> 00:11:23,360
should raise our show rate or, oh,

536
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,039
okay, let me like go audit this,

537
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:26,519
this client sales process and see

538
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:27,909
what their setters are doing or

539
00:11:27,909 --> 00:11:29,279
see what their closers are doing

540
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:29,500
pre

541
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:29,870
call.

542
00:11:29,909 --> 00:11:31,299
Oh, they didn't even hit me up.

543
00:11:31,389 --> 00:11:32,320
They just had Calendly

544
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,019
notifications getting sent out.

545
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:34,620
Cool.

546
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:36,059
I'm going to set up a call with

547
00:11:36,059 --> 00:11:37,600
the sales team with this client

548
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:39,090
for next week, or I'm going to

549
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:39,320
send

550
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,279
them this document.

551
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:41,690
That's like a checklist of what to

552
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:42,960
do before the call to actually

553
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,720
rate show rates.

554
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,340
Like, Hey, you got to double dial

555
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:47,169
them, you know, twice a day for 72

556
00:11:47,169 --> 00:11:48,850
hours, send them selfie videos,

557
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,049
send them different trust assets

558
00:11:50,129 --> 00:11:51,470
and sales assets before the call.

559
00:11:51,549 --> 00:11:53,559
Like all that stuff is what I'll

560
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:54,570
look in and do.

561
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:56,500
But again, it's more of a, it's

562
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,169
more of a gathering data and

563
00:11:58,169 --> 00:11:59,789
analyzing data type role

564
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:01,379
that we do on a day-to-day basis.

565
00:12:01,379 --> 00:12:02,490
And then seeing what the

566
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:04,049
bottleneck is and then directing

567
00:12:04,049 --> 00:12:04,559
the team

568
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:05,919
from there or directing the client

569
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:07,000
from there on what to do.
