1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,409
So let's talk about what makes a

2
00:00:01,409 --> 00:00:02,779
good ad in the first place.

3
00:00:02,779 --> 00:00:06,419
So the first thing is, of course,

4
00:00:06,629 --> 00:00:08,339
the messaging in the ad.

5
00:00:08,339 --> 00:00:10,570
So what should your ad actually

6
00:00:10,859 --> 00:00:11,539
talk about?

7
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:15,000
Your ad should be calling out

8
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:19,949
the real-time pain points,

9
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:25,230
desires, situations, and

10
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:28,629
circumstances

11
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:31,379
that your target prospect is

12
00:00:31,379 --> 00:00:33,770
experiencing right now.

13
00:00:33,979 --> 00:00:37,060
It has to be hyper-contextual to

14
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:37,359
what they're

15
00:00:37,609 --> 00:00:38,490
experiencing right now.

16
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,759
It should be something like if

17
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:41,109
you're talking about wanting an

18
00:00:41,109 --> 00:00:41,420
iPad,

19
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:43,659
that's where you want essentially

20
00:00:43,659 --> 00:00:44,890
you to get served an ad with an

21
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:45,399
iPad.

22
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:46,719
So it's like you want

23
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,369
to be in that position.

24
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:50,060
We can run back that.

25
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:52,310
Your ads need to be

26
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,799
hyper-contextual to what the

27
00:00:56,049 --> 00:00:58,280
prospect is dealing with right now

28
00:00:58,369 --> 00:00:59,270
in real time.

29
00:00:59,409 --> 00:01:01,439
So what I mean by that is, for

30
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:02,280
example,

31
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:03,829
if they're struggling with show

32
00:01:03,829 --> 00:01:05,500
rates, you want to call that out.

33
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,900
You want to articulate that

34
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:07,269
problem

35
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:08,269
better than they can.

36
00:01:08,269 --> 00:01:09,560
You want to call out, hey, are you

37
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:10,790
struggling with show rates?

38
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:11,489
Not stuff where

39
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,269
it's like, hey, are you struggling

40
00:01:13,269 --> 00:01:13,879
with sales?

41
00:01:13,969 --> 00:01:14,859
It's way too broad.

42
00:01:14,859 --> 00:01:16,579
You want to get very specific

43
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:18,060
to these pain points in your copy

44
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:19,200
and in your messaging.

45
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,560
That's what's going to get ads

46
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,079
that hit.

47
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,609
So it's very crucial that in your

48
00:01:22,609 --> 00:01:24,269
copy and when you're writing these

49
00:01:24,269 --> 00:01:26,319
ads, you need to get very,

50
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:27,609
again, granular with these

51
00:01:27,709 --> 00:01:29,379
problems people are experiencing

52
00:01:29,379 --> 00:01:30,859
and these dream states that they

53
00:01:31,069 --> 00:01:32,510
want to be in, these desires that

54
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:33,200
they have.

55
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,659
Nothing is too specific.

56
00:01:34,659 --> 00:01:36,939
Not nothing.

57
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:39,219
You don't want to go

58
00:01:39,469 --> 00:01:39,969
super broad.

59
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,780
You don't want to be very generic

60
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:43,390
like coaches, agencies, and

61
00:01:43,659 --> 00:01:44,340
consultants.

62
00:01:44,459 --> 00:01:44,939
I'm going to

63
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:46,680
help you four to five X your lead

64
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,280
flow by fixing your sales.

65
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:49,920
That doesn't work anymore.

66
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,219
The call

67
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:52,859
outs don't work anymore.

68
00:01:52,859 --> 00:01:54,689
You need to articulate the pain

69
00:01:54,829 --> 00:01:56,609
points, the desires, the real

70
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:57,700
situations that

71
00:01:57,930 --> 00:01:59,129
your prospects are in right now

72
00:01:59,129 --> 00:02:00,549
and the circumstances that they

73
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:02,689
find themselves in in your ads.

74
00:02:02,829 --> 00:02:04,040
So the flow of a

75
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,280
good ad that I like to follow is

76
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:08,990
you have the hook, of course, hit

77
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:12,539
the body and you have the CTA.

78
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:13,280
Now

79
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:15,020
the hook is articulating that

80
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:15,699
problem.

81
00:02:15,699 --> 00:02:17,629
So calling out the problem like,

82
00:02:17,719 --> 00:02:19,419
hey, are you struggling to get

83
00:02:19,629 --> 00:02:22,250
your show rates above 75% or, hey,

84
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,139
are you struggling to get

85
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:26,599
prospects to show up to your sales

86
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:27,210
calls actually

87
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:28,539
warm and ready to buy?

88
00:02:28,539 --> 00:02:30,169
Because every time they show up,

89
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,060
shoot, if they do at all, they're

90
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,759
super cold guarded and just

91
00:02:33,969 --> 00:02:34,879
thrown out objections.

92
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,569
You see how more specific that

93
00:02:36,569 --> 00:02:38,680
hook is than something like, hey,

94
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,639
are you struggling to actually get

95
00:02:40,689 --> 00:02:40,979
sales

96
00:02:41,229 --> 00:02:41,979
through ads?

97
00:02:41,979 --> 00:02:43,360
Terrible, right?

98
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,150
So the hook will call out the pain

99
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:52,229
points, the problem, or the desire

100
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:52,979
someone has.

101
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:55,409
Or it could also call out proof to

102
00:02:55,409 --> 00:02:57,750
like one of the ones that we shot

103
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,840
over with list kit, or like one of

104
00:03:00,979 --> 00:03:01,900
the ones we shot with

105
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:03,780
Christian over at list kit was, we

106
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:06,060
sent, you know, 150,000 cold

107
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:08,060
emails or something crazy like

108
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:10,650
that, generated x appointments, x

109
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,219
revenue, x sales

110
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:12,969
calls, all that stuff.

111
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:14,250
It was super proof led.

112
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:16,180
Also, some like case study ads do

113
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:18,460
really well with this logic too,

114
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:19,020
where you

115
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:20,310
basically call out, hey, we got

116
00:03:20,419 --> 00:03:21,759
this person, this result, here's

117
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:22,360
how we did it.

118
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,900
And then the body supports that

119
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:24,740
and talks more about

120
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:25,949
that, right?

121
00:03:25,949 --> 00:03:28,099
So then the body, what we like to

122
00:03:28,099 --> 00:03:31,120
do is essentially give support to

123
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,650
the hook.

124
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:34,129
So if you talk about a pain

125
00:03:34,389 --> 00:03:36,379
point, you want to talk about, you

126
00:03:36,469 --> 00:03:38,599
know, why that occurs, like why

127
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:40,539
that pain point or problem is

128
00:03:40,539 --> 00:03:40,939
occurring.

129
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:42,949
The solutions to it, which

130
00:03:42,949 --> 00:03:45,409
essentially is guess what, your

131
00:03:45,409 --> 00:03:47,400
product or service.

132
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,500
And then the outcome slash proof,

133
00:03:53,389 --> 00:03:54,610
which is where you can weave in

134
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:56,139
some CTAs and also talk about the

135
00:03:56,139 --> 00:03:58,060
outcome they're going to get of,

136
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,699
you know, using your product or

137
00:03:59,699 --> 00:04:01,180
service as the solution.

138
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:03,189
And then we go into the CTA, which

139
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:03,409
the

140
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:05,060
CTA, we just want to be very

141
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:07,289
direct and tell people what to do

142
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:07,969
next.

143
00:04:07,969 --> 00:04:10,210
And also what's on the next page.

144
00:04:10,259 --> 00:04:11,759
So what I like to do for our CTA

145
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:13,050
is not click the learn more button

146
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:14,539
down below and you'll, you know,

147
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:15,819
go to a page and you book a call.

148
00:04:15,819 --> 00:04:17,740
I like to say, click the, you

149
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:18,709
know, if this is interesting to

150
00:04:18,939 --> 00:04:18,939
you

151
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:20,230
and you want to fix your show

152
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:21,939
rates, click the learn more button

153
00:04:21,939 --> 00:04:22,689
down below.

154
00:04:22,699 --> 00:04:23,110
You're going to be taken

155
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,860
to a quick page that has a five to

156
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,600
10 minute video on there that

157
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,230
explains everything about our

158
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:28,860
offer in

159
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:30,490
detail and how we can help you.

160
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:32,170
And then on that page too, you can

161
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:33,819
click a button, fill out a quick

162
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:35,769
application, schedule a call, and

163
00:04:35,769 --> 00:04:37,120
you'll hop on a call with me to

164
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,620
see if this is a fit for you,

165
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:38,860
right?

166
00:04:38,899 --> 00:04:40,149
I like to be very direct and tell

167
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:41,339
them what's going to be on the

168
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:43,660
next page and just make sure that

169
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:43,839
they're not

170
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,139
jarred when they get to there.

171
00:04:45,139 --> 00:04:46,220
We want to pre-frame them before

172
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:46,860
they get to there.

173
00:04:47,069 --> 00:04:49,339
And sometimes in the body too, if

174
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:51,839
you look at some of the ones with,

175
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,579
uh, Christian and Liskit,

176
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:54,649
like we just go right into the

177
00:04:54,649 --> 00:04:55,000
offer.

178
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,250
So we love doing like the, here's

179
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,740
our offer to you, right?

180
00:04:58,029 --> 00:04:59,110
That's a good one too.

181
00:04:59,209 --> 00:05:00,860
Those are just more direct.

182
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:03,339
Um, I am defaulting lately to

183
00:05:03,529 --> 00:05:04,389
having longer ads

184
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:06,290
that have more context and more, a

185
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:08,540
little bit more education in them,

186
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:10,220
but these do work pretty good

187
00:05:10,389 --> 00:05:10,560
too.

188
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,750
Just a very direct one.

189
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,230
So that's essentially what you

190
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,209
want to follow.

191
00:05:14,209 --> 00:05:15,180
Uh, when you're writing

192
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:17,500
ads is the hook needs to be very

193
00:05:17,589 --> 00:05:19,759
articulate and needs to hit on

194
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,899
their pain points, their problems,

195
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:24,009
their desires, or show some really

196
00:05:24,069 --> 00:05:24,810
hard proof.

197
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,139
And then the body should

198
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,129
essentially support

199
00:05:27,829 --> 00:05:29,579
whatever you say in the hook and

200
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:30,920
expand upon that.

201
00:05:30,939 --> 00:05:32,540
Or of course you can try the very

202
00:05:32,689 --> 00:05:34,060
direct route as well.

203
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:35,790
And then the CTA should just be

204
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,480
very direct to tell them what's on

205
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:38,300
the next page,

206
00:05:38,589 --> 00:05:39,579
what they got to do next.

207
00:05:39,579 --> 00:05:40,870
And you'll be good to go on that

208
00:05:40,949 --> 00:05:41,259
front.

209
00:05:41,509 --> 00:05:46,970
And then number two of making good

210
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,339
ads are the visuals.

211
00:05:49,589 --> 00:05:53,420
Now in terms of your visuals, your

212
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,310
environment

213
00:05:55,269 --> 00:05:59,569
should match who you are and what

214
00:05:59,569 --> 00:06:00,779
you sell.

215
00:06:00,939 --> 00:06:02,819
And what I mean by that is, for

216
00:06:02,899 --> 00:06:04,129
example, I look like

217
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:05,329
an info marketer right now.

218
00:06:05,329 --> 00:06:06,350
I have a traditional book

219
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:07,579
background and all that.

220
00:06:07,579 --> 00:06:08,540
I got these wood panels.

221
00:06:08,579 --> 00:06:09,949
I have an all same shirt on like,

222
00:06:09,949 --> 00:06:11,370
this is the whole info marketer

223
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,709
thing right here, right?

224
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:14,970
I look like somebody that runs ads

225
00:06:15,029 --> 00:06:16,139
for info guys.

226
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:18,839
You know, if I was targeting real

227
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:19,509
estate funds and

228
00:06:19,769 --> 00:06:21,040
syndications, guess what I'm doing

229
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:21,500
in my ads.

230
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,699
I'm wearing a polo shirt.

231
00:06:22,699 --> 00:06:23,819
I'm slapping the watch on.

232
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:24,889
I'm looking a little bit more

233
00:06:24,889 --> 00:06:26,420
professional, maybe changed up the

234
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,660
background a little bit and what's

235
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:27,970
behind

236
00:06:28,019 --> 00:06:28,290
me.

237
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:29,610
But you need to match your

238
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:31,449
environment to what you're selling

239
00:06:31,589 --> 00:06:32,459
essentially.

240
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:33,339
Another great example.

241
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,300
This is one of our clients.

242
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,730
He sells Google ads to

243
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:36,810
contractors.

244
00:06:36,949 --> 00:06:40,620
So instead of sitting inside of a

245
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:42,360
studio like this with, you know,

246
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,040
wood panel background, looking

247
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,180
like an info marketer,

248
00:06:45,329 --> 00:06:46,990
he put on a polo shirt with his

249
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:49,259
logo, went outside of a Home Depot

250
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:52,459
and had his big Chevy truck in the

251
00:06:52,709 --> 00:06:54,040
background and shot at selfie

252
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,430
video or a selfie style.

253
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:56,550
So he had a truck in the

254
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:57,579
background, Home

255
00:06:57,910 --> 00:06:59,620
Depot in the background, polo,

256
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:01,509
collared shirt on, looked very

257
00:07:01,509 --> 00:07:02,560
professional.

258
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,899
And that resonated with

259
00:07:04,149 --> 00:07:05,449
people more than him sitting in a

260
00:07:05,449 --> 00:07:07,120
studio like this, looking like an

261
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,540
info marketer because all the

262
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:08,779
other

263
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:10,430
marketing agencies look like that,

264
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,579
rip them off, right?

265
00:07:11,579 --> 00:07:13,740
So he's meeting the prospect where

266
00:07:13,889 --> 00:07:14,860
they're at

267
00:07:15,029 --> 00:07:16,509
and essentially fitting into that

268
00:07:16,589 --> 00:07:18,040
mold of somebody that does what

269
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,449
they say they do.

270
00:07:19,449 --> 00:07:20,860
And the environment

271
00:07:21,009 --> 00:07:22,509
is key for that, right?

272
00:07:22,589 --> 00:07:24,779
So if you're a CPA, for example,

273
00:07:24,779 --> 00:07:25,800
you probably want to be in a

274
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:25,980
studio

275
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:27,790
that's nice and professional.

276
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:29,439
You don't want to be outside of a

277
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:31,019
Lambo or something like that,

278
00:07:31,069 --> 00:07:33,170
or in a Miami, you know, penthouse

279
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:34,490
type thing, right?

280
00:07:34,629 --> 00:07:36,149
So just make sure your environment

281
00:07:36,939 --> 00:07:37,509
matches your

282
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:38,889
offer and who you're selling to

283
00:07:38,889 --> 00:07:40,220
and will resonate with the people

284
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:41,259
that you're selling to.

285
00:07:41,509 --> 00:07:44,379
And then also make sure you have

286
00:07:44,379 --> 00:07:47,740
good camera quality, right?

287
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,110
That's a key, that's a key thing.

288
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,060
You know, if you have like an

289
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:51,189
Android, a lot of those things

290
00:07:51,189 --> 00:07:52,379
look like garbage, you know,

291
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:53,899
we can film on the iPhone.

292
00:07:53,899 --> 00:07:55,149
They do look pretty good, but if

293
00:07:55,149 --> 00:07:56,379
you can get a camera,

294
00:07:56,589 --> 00:07:56,810
awesome.

295
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,029
Just make sure the camera quality

296
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:59,339
is solid.

297
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:01,829
And same with the audio quality,

298
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:04,139
invest in a mic, like make sure

299
00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:05,339
that when you're shooting ads,

300
00:08:05,589 --> 00:08:07,560
people can actually hear you very

301
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,139
well.

302
00:08:08,139 --> 00:08:10,220
The audio quality honestly is

303
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:11,819
almost more important than the

304
00:08:11,939 --> 00:08:12,779
the camera quality.

305
00:08:12,779 --> 00:08:14,089
Cause if you have an amazing

306
00:08:14,089 --> 00:08:15,779
looking video, but the audio is a

307
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:16,699
little bit off

308
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,939
or the audio is like hard to hear,

309
00:08:19,029 --> 00:08:21,420
or it's really grainy and cloudy,

310
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:22,379
people are going to swipe.

311
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:22,699
So just

312
00:08:22,949 --> 00:08:25,100
make sure that that is dialed in.

313
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,949
And then also with the visuals,

314
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:29,899
just make sure that you're

315
00:08:29,899 --> 00:08:30,500
presenting the

316
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:34,529
in a confident manner.

317
00:08:34,529 --> 00:08:36,059
And also you can add some

318
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:37,500
different props.

319
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,720
Like we love using the whiteboard

320
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:41,309
in the, uh, the flip chart with

321
00:08:41,309 --> 00:08:42,700
Christian and the ads for let's

322
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:43,740
get love them.

323
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,019
That visual aid does so

324
00:08:45,309 --> 00:08:45,549
well.

325
00:08:45,549 --> 00:08:46,750
It grabs attention.

326
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:47,820
It's different.

327
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,259
It's not just a direct talking

328
00:08:49,539 --> 00:08:49,980
head.

329
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,580
So add some props in there

330
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,100
and some visual aids and some

331
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,960
visual disruptors, especially for

332
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,539
your hooks, that'll help you so

333
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,350
much to make your ads just pop out

334
00:08:58,350 --> 00:08:59,879
and get that hook rate up.

335
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:01,870
So people stop scrolling and watch

336
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:02,059
what

337
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,710
you're essentially, uh, trying to

338
00:09:03,789 --> 00:09:05,409
convey to them.

339
00:09:05,409 --> 00:09:14,320
Trying to do anything else.

340
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,070
Yep.

341
00:09:18,049 --> 00:09:20,289
So those are really

342
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:21,580
the best practices when filming

343
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:21,950
ads.

344
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:23,129
And of course we'd like to make

345
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,779
sure it's native to the platform.

346
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:26,690
So if we're running ads on meta,

347
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:28,830
we'll make them, you know, nine by

348
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:29,580
16.

349
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:30,779
So they look like reels

350
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,429
or we'll do, you know, four by

351
00:09:32,509 --> 00:09:34,210
five sometimes too, but we just

352
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:35,899
like to make it very native to the

353
00:09:35,899 --> 00:09:36,460
platform.

354
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:38,440
If we're doing YouTube, we'll do

355
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,570
16 by nines.

356
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:41,429
So we'll film it landscape, not

357
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:42,169
vertical.

358
00:09:42,379 --> 00:09:43,580
Um, some people

359
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,210
I've seen run YouTube ads where

360
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:47,059
it's like, you know, the 16 by

361
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:48,710
nine and they filmed it nine by

362
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:49,259
16.

363
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:51,289
So the videos here and they just

364
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:52,590
add this like weird grainy

365
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:53,659
background over there.

366
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,740
I don't like doing that film

367
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:55,889
native to your platform that

368
00:09:55,889 --> 00:09:57,019
you're running the ads on.

369
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:59,009
But that's really the main things

370
00:09:59,009 --> 00:10:00,490
you need to look at whenever

371
00:10:00,629 --> 00:10:01,970
you're actually making ads that

372
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:02,139
are

373
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:04,610
good is make sure the visuals are

374
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:07,179
strong and the environment's good.

375
00:10:07,179 --> 00:10:08,460
The quality is good.

376
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:09,940
You're speaking very confidently

377
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:10,490
on camera.

378
00:10:10,549 --> 00:10:11,620
Sometimes you can weave in some

379
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:12,379
awesome props,

380
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:14,019
make sure you're filming in an

381
00:10:14,019 --> 00:10:15,759
aspect ratio or format that's

382
00:10:15,769 --> 00:10:18,539
native to the platform and make

383
00:10:18,539 --> 00:10:18,860
sure your

384
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:20,549

00:10:20,549 --> 00:10:22,120
their real time pain points,

386
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,740
desires, situations, and

387
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:24,779
circumstances.

388

prospects because you're

390
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,500
articulating something that

391
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:29,740
they're

392
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:31,700
experiencing right now better than

393
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:32,399
