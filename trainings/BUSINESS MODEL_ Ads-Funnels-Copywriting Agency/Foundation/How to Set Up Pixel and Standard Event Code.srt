00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:01,899
All right in this video real quick

2
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:04,049
i'm going to show you guys how to

3
00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:05,639
place the pixel and standard

4
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:07,530
event code on your funnel so very

5
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:09,500
easy but basically we're going to

6
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:10,640
open up the events

7
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:11,769
manager just make sure you're in

8
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:12,890
you know the right ad account and

9
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:14,039
everything like that right

10
00:00:14,109 --> 00:00:15,859
bm basically going to go to this

11
00:00:15,859 --> 00:00:17,750
events manager you can also find

12
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,359
it under all tools if you click

13
00:00:19,469 --> 00:00:24,550
that but events manager open it up

14
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:27,710
you could go to data sources pick

15
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,980
the pixel you're using

16
00:00:30,089 --> 00:00:32,289
now if you have to create a new

17
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:34,899
pixel you do connect data and you

18
00:00:34,899 --> 00:00:37,460
follow the setup wizard you

19
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:38,829
click web next and you can

20
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:41,000
essentially just create a new data

21
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,039
set and follow that whole wizard

22
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:43,979
to create

23
00:00:44,049 --> 00:00:45,729
a new pixel but what you want to

24
00:00:45,729 --> 00:00:47,539
do if you have an existing one is

25
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:49,520
click here or if you step into an

26
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:51,399
account with an existing one to

27
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:53,380
find the code you're just going to

28
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:57,000
go to add events add events and

29
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,119
new

30
00:00:57,229 --> 00:01:00,600
integration metapixel setup

31
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,240
manually add code to your website

32
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:07,930
copy this code continue i always

33
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:11,090
like to turn on advanced matching

34
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:13,239
not sure actually why they don't

35
00:01:13,349 --> 00:01:15,400
have country on there we go now

36
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:21,090
that you have this code copied

37
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:23,319
you're going to go to your funnel

38
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:23,560
building

39
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:25,319
platform go to settings and you're

40
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:26,760
going to paste it in the whole

41
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,959
head code of the website okay

42
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:30,280
you're just

43
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:31,650
going to paste it right there hit

44
00:01:31,769 --> 00:01:33,219
update funnel

45
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:36,239
and ghl it's a very similar spot

46
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:39,260
to it's the full funnel level so

47
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:41,620
you don't have to go into each

48
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:42,060
page

49
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:43,769
and click header code and paste it

50
00:01:43,769 --> 00:01:45,150
you just go on the full funnel

51
00:01:45,219 --> 00:01:47,500
level funnel level usually it's in

52
00:01:47,609 --> 00:01:48,870
you know settings or something

53
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:50,590
like that on the entire funnel and

54
00:01:50,659 --> 00:01:52,799
you just paste it in there now

55
00:01:52,909 --> 00:01:54,609
what you need to do to grab the

56
00:01:55,219 --> 00:01:55,890
standard event code

57
00:01:56,069 --> 00:01:59,629
and the standard event code will

58
00:01:59,629 --> 00:02:03,709
fire off whatever conversion event

59
00:02:03,709 --> 00:02:05,239
right so if you're trying to book

60
00:02:05,409 --> 00:02:07,599
calls and do schedule the standard

61
00:02:07,739 --> 00:02:10,659
event code will be schedule let me

62
00:02:10,659 --> 00:02:13,000
go this is the unconfirmed

63
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:19,750
here we go we have two pages one

64
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:21,330
for qualified and one for

65
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,509
unqualified the qualified one is

66
00:02:23,509 --> 00:02:23,990
the only

67
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:25,370
one here that has the standard

68
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:26,750
event code but basically all

69
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:29,360
you're going to do is paste the

70
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:29,669
code

71
00:02:29,789 --> 00:02:31,409
like this the fbq track and then

72
00:02:31,409 --> 00:02:33,389
whatever standard event code here

73
00:02:33,389 --> 00:02:35,259
so this could be lead this could

74
00:02:35,259 --> 00:02:35,389
be

75
00:02:35,509 --> 00:02:36,770
complete registration this could

76
00:02:36,889 --> 00:02:38,360
be submit application you can find

77
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,960
these on metas website too or just

78
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,199
ask

79
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:41,949
chat gbt hey can you give me the

80
00:02:41,979 --> 00:02:44,400
standard event code for meta for

81
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,150
schedule event and the script

82
00:02:47,389 --> 00:02:47,610
codes

83
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,169
um the script brackets as well in

84
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,729
between there and just give me the

85
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,909
simplified one because if not

86
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:52,340
it'll give you

87
00:02:52,469 --> 00:02:53,990
this really long crazy one uh you

88
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:55,610
just want to give you this simple

89
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,960
one and all you do if you're using

90
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,189
click

91
00:02:58,310 --> 00:02:59,569
funnels 2.0 you have to put this

92
00:02:59,689 --> 00:03:00,909
in the footer the header does not

93
00:03:00,909 --> 00:03:03,060
work all other platforms though

94
00:03:03,189 --> 00:03:05,439
you put it in the header now this

95
00:03:05,509 --> 00:03:07,340
is the header on the actual

96
00:03:07,469 --> 00:03:08,909
confirmation page

97
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:10,900
after somebody purchases after

98
00:03:11,349 --> 00:03:12,939
somebody fills out a form submits

99
00:03:12,939 --> 00:03:14,750
an application or schedules a call

100
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:15,000
you

101
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:16,530
don't put this on the entire

102
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,330
website and you don't put this on

103
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:20,439
the initial landing page people

104
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:20,849
fill out

105
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,659
an application and schedule a call

106
00:03:22,659 --> 00:03:23,669
then they land on this

107
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,479
confirmation page here that's why

108
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:25,780
i have

109
00:03:25,909 --> 00:03:27,949
this code on here right because

110
00:03:28,229 --> 00:03:30,069
when somebody lands here i want

111
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:32,030
them to report back to meta

112
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:33,259
as a scheduled call.

113
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,620
So that's why I put that there.

114
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:35,599
So that's all you got to do for

115
00:03:35,629 --> 00:03:36,000
this.
