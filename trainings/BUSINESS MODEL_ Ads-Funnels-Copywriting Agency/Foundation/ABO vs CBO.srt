1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,060
All right so let me break down the

2
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:02,359
difference real quick between an

3
00:00:02,439 --> 00:00:04,080
abo or a cbo and which

4
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,950
one you should choose so an abo

5
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:12,080
is essentially called ad set

6
00:00:12,199 --> 00:00:14,560
budget

7
00:00:14,679 --> 00:00:18,000
optimization and these have

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,879
different names inside of the ads

9
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:21,629
manager but this is what

10
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,910
you're going to hear it referred

11
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:26,039
to all the time as and then cbo is

12
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:26,800
campaign

13
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,560
budget optimization

14
00:00:32,679 --> 00:00:35,700
so if you're going to choose a cbo

15
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,960
which sometimes inside of the ad

16
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,399
manager it'll just say campaign

17
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:41,960
budget other times it'll say

18
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,450
advantage campaign budget

19
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,409
basically what you're telling meta

20
00:00:45,409 --> 00:00:45,759
to do

21
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:49,109
is you know in any ad campaign

22
00:00:49,109 --> 00:00:51,320
you're going to have the campaign

23
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:51,450
level

24
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,759
the ad set level where you choose

25
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:56,090
targeting and different placements

26
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:57,359
and stuff like that

27
00:00:58,039 --> 00:00:59,409
and then the creative level or the

28
00:00:59,409 --> 00:01:01,289
ad level right three different

29
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:03,840
levels okay with a cbo

30
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,450
you're placing your budget so

31
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:08,989
you're saying all right meta on

32
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:11,260
this campaign i want to spend

33
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:14,420
a hundred dollars per day on a cbo

34
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:16,959
you're placing your budget on the

35
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:19,439
campaign level and let's say you

36
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,489
have two different ad sets you

37
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:24,530
have ad set one you have ad set

38
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:27,760
two and then inside of these ad

39
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,150
sets you

40
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,019
have five ads here and you have

41
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:32,799
the same five ads here with cbo

42
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:37,349
meta will initially spend a little

43
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:37,840
bit

44
00:01:37,959 --> 00:01:39,700
equal to both of these ad sets but

45
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:41,280
it's going to quickly bias

46
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,840
typically towards one so in the

47
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:44,239
first

48
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:45,859
hour it might spend equally

49
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:47,709
towards ad set one and ad set two

50
00:01:47,709 --> 00:01:49,930
and then it's like all right cool

51
00:01:50,019 --> 00:01:50,370
we know

52
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:52,219
that ad set one based upon all of

53
00:01:52,219 --> 00:01:53,980
our data points on every single

54
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,840
user and by analyzing the ads and

55
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:57,459
the messaging and the placements

56
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,290
and the targeting options on this

57
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:00,959
ad set in this set of creatives

58
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,459
we know that ad set one is going

59
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:04,019
to win so we're going to start to

60
00:02:04,019 --> 00:02:05,650
push the majority of spend towards

61
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:08,270
ad set one and not much towards ad

62
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:10,750
set two that's all cbo is is it's

63
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:13,680
basically you saying hey meta

64
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,110
here's my hundred dollars a day

65
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,550
budget i want you to allocate it

66
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:18,319
between these ad sets that you see

67
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,259
fit and you think and sit and

68
00:02:20,259 --> 00:02:21,669
spend money on the one that you

69
00:02:21,669 --> 00:02:23,039
think is going to get the most

70
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:23,360
results

71
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:25,219
for me as an advertiser so very

72
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:27,210
simple on that front you know

73
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:29,050
after five days you might see

74
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:32,340
literally 450 spent on ad set one

75
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,889
and 50 on ad set two you just have

76
00:02:34,979 --> 00:02:36,800
to trust meta in that case

77
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:38,370
that's making the right decision i

78
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:39,740
personally like to default to

79
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:41,199
cbo's typically unless i'm trying

80
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:41,360
to

81
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:43,099
force spend on one ad set and one

82
00:02:43,099 --> 00:02:44,909
set of you know creatives one set

83
00:02:44,909 --> 00:02:46,240
of targeting options

84
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:48,659
again that's where an abo comes

85
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:50,319
into play but i usually default

86
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:51,520
towards cbo especially if i'm

87
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:53,129
testing different audiences and

88
00:02:53,129 --> 00:02:54,590
i'm testing the same ads within

89
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:56,000
those ad sets so if i'm trying to

90
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,039
quickly test okay does this set of

91
00:02:58,039 --> 00:03:00,009
messaging or these ads work well

92
00:03:00,009 --> 00:03:01,689
with these different audiences

93
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,699
like which audience is the best

94
00:03:03,819 --> 00:03:05,590
that's when i'll run a cbo now an

95
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,530
abo is

96
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,409
you do now with an abo you do not

97
00:03:14,409 --> 00:03:16,849
place the budget on the campaign

98
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:19,370
level you place it on the ad set

99
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:23,419
level so say you have these same

100
00:03:23,419 --> 00:03:26,580
two ad sets you then put fifty

101
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:29,599
dollars a day here fifty dollars a

102
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:30,909
day here and meta is going to

103
00:03:30,909 --> 00:03:32,449
spend fifty dollars on ad set one

104
00:03:32,449 --> 00:03:34,080
and spend fifty dollars on ad set

105
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:34,289
two

106
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:35,849
right so it's going to spend it

107
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:37,379
equally depending on how much

108
00:03:37,389 --> 00:03:38,879
money you put here if you put

109
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:39,120
seventy

110
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,500
five dollars on ad set one it's

111
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,400
going to spend 75 bucks if you put

112
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,919
150 on ad set two it's going to

113
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:45,780
spend 150 on ad set two it's not

114
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,159
like cbo where it's going to

115
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:49,039
distribute it depending on how it

116
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:49,520
sees

117
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:50,889
fit on these ad sets you're

118
00:03:50,889 --> 00:03:52,659
essentially telling it hey meta i

119
00:03:52,659 --> 00:03:54,400
want you to spend this amount of

120
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,039
money

121
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:57,599
on these ad sets so this is what i

122
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,439
will do typically if i want to run

123
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:01,840
some sort of split

124
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,090
test on an account like if i'm

125
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:04,629
seeing weird behavior with the cbo

126
00:04:04,629 --> 00:04:06,080
i'll test out an abo structure

127
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:07,810
um or if i have this proven set of

128
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:09,439
messaging this proven set of

129
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,110
creatives with this proven

130
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:11,770
audience

131
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,979
i would just ram spend onto that

132
00:04:13,979 --> 00:04:15,889
and just ensure that you know

133
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:17,759
essentially this ad set gets the

134
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:19,519
right spend amount that i want

135
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:22,730
versus doing a cbo so all it is is

136
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:25,230
literally abo gives you more

137
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:26,579
control

138
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:28,959
and cbo gives you less control cbo

139
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:31,790
you're leaning more on meta abo

140
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:33,040
you're leaning more on yourself

141
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,279
that's

142
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:35,420
really it but overall doesn't

143
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:37,720
really matter um to be honest the

144
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:41,990
creative is going to win in either

145
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,829
setup or either structure if you

146
00:04:43,829 --> 00:04:45,509
have good ads and a good funnel

147
00:04:45,509 --> 00:04:46,959
and a good offer and a good

148
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:47,600
messaging

149
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,839
doesn't really matter if you're on

150
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:49,920
cbo or abo i just want to show you

151
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,800
guys the difference

152
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:52,269
if you have good ads good funnels

153
00:04:52,269 --> 00:04:53,750
good offer you're going to win in

154
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,199
either setup so it doesn't really

155
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,399
matter
