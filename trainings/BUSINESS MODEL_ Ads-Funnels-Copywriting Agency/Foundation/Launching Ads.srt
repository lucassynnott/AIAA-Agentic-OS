1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,209
All right hey guys so i just

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:05,309
wanted to go over a quick video on

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:07,450
like how we actually build up the

4
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:09,029
campaigns got some of you guys

5
00:00:09,029 --> 00:00:10,589
asking me about this um so let's

6
00:00:10,589 --> 00:00:12,560
go we're going to be building

7
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,539
this campaign for one of our

8
00:00:14,779 --> 00:00:17,210
clients here and right now um it's

9
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:20,550
august 9th or august 8th 2025

10
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:24,289
and we are defaulting to our

11
00:00:24,289 --> 00:00:28,699
typical cbo uh setup but we might

12
00:00:28,789 --> 00:00:32,000
be changing this up um but anyways

13
00:00:32,109 --> 00:00:33,460
we're going to build it up now and

14
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:34,880
it's just going to be like minor

15
00:00:34,979 --> 00:00:35,770
tweaks like an abo with

16
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:37,750
individual ads potentially later

17
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,299
versus the cbo especially for

18
00:00:39,299 --> 00:00:40,770
statics we're running statics

19
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:41,039
we're

20
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,679
probably going to be doing that

21
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,380
but anyways uh i'm just going to

22
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:45,759
start one from i'm not going to

23
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:45,810
start

24
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:47,049
one from like complete scratch i'm

25
00:00:47,049 --> 00:00:48,149
just going to duplicate one out so

26
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:49,119
i'm going to duplicate this

27
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,710
one out here but i'll show you

28
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:52,390
guys what to do whenever we're

29
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:54,799
essentially making one so what we

30
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:56,390
do is if we're stepping into a

31
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:58,070
agency relationship with the

32
00:00:58,070 --> 00:00:59,880
client we're going to do smo so we

33
00:01:00,049 --> 00:01:00,079
just

34
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,090
want to tag our campaigns the

35
00:01:02,299 --> 00:01:04,290
actual um campaign strategy so

36
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:06,000
we're doing cbo the event we're

37
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,680
optimizing around and then dct103

38
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,430
so what we do is we have these

39
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:12,319
tracking spreadsheets it's called

40
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:12,400
a

41
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,319
creative roadmap that basically

42
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:16,129
says okay cool this is going to be

43
00:01:16,129 --> 00:01:17,920
the these set of ads inside of

44
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:18,239
this

45
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:19,969
dct this dynamic creative test so

46
00:01:20,459 --> 00:01:21,980
essentially we're on test 103 so

47
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:24,000
batch 103 of ads for them

48
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:25,219
if you're just starting out it's

49
00:01:25,489 --> 00:01:27,200
going to be batch 101 right and i

50
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,579
don't do batch number one two

51
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:29,760
three

52
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,489
because it doesn't like look as

53
00:01:31,489 --> 00:01:33,340
clean so uh anyways we're going to

54
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:35,120
set the budget on their campaigns

55
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,209
so for these guys we're going to

56
00:01:36,209 --> 00:01:37,579
launch this one at 500 bucks for

57
00:01:37,579 --> 00:01:40,560
the day or per day and then we're

58
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:41,819
going to split between on interest

59
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,930
stack and broad for these guys in

60
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:46,079
particular we might do a lookalike

61
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:47,299
audience as well um i actually

62
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,090
might duplicate one of these out

63
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:50,680
and do a lookalike but anyways

64
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:50,849
we're

65
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,099
going to do interest stack website

66
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:54,500
max conversions we're going to

67
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,959
pick their pixel and we're going

68
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:57,040
to

69
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,620
choose the conversion event we're

70
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:00,189
doing schedule we're not doing any

71
00:02:00,189 --> 00:02:01,590
cost per goal or anything we're

72
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:01,760
not

73
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,680
touching any of these down here

74
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,980
we're toggling dynamic creative on

75
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:09,490
right now and then in the audience

76
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,719
level we have our interest stack

77
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:11,969
here so this is the interest stack

78
00:02:11,969 --> 00:02:13,250
we're using for them i actually

79
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:13,300
wanted

80
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:16,680
to domestic roof i think there's

81
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,300
like roof there's one other

82
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:22,610
targeting options that i wanted to

83
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:23,080
get on

84
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:28,050
here actually we already had it

85
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:31,680
domestic roof construction um on

86
00:02:31,699 --> 00:02:32,710
this page

87
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:36,330
with interest stacks um i don't

88
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:40,000
really like to get too granular

89
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,439
with it all i literally do is just

90
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:41,750
slap

91
00:02:41,889 --> 00:02:43,580
on as many different interests as

92
00:02:43,669 --> 00:02:45,439
i can think of that will fit their

93
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:47,599
um essentially demographic

94
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:48,710
right i'm just like slapping

95
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,159
roofer building contractor general

96
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:51,340
contractor roofing domestic

97
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:52,599
roof construction roofing

98
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:54,039
contractor website business page

99
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:55,840
admins all right stuff like that

100
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:59,199
i'll be like small business owner

101
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:08,669
right there you go nice little

102
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:10,560
healthy size i usually like to get

103
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,419
this up towards like the seven

104
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,740
million 70 million plus but these

105
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:14,090
guys are only targeting roofing

106
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:15,520
contractors so you know 19 mil

107
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:16,750
is okay for the lower end and then

108
00:03:16,939 --> 00:03:18,310
placements i'm going to go here

109
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:19,759
i'm going to turn off this piece

110
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:21,009
of shit audience network thing

111
00:03:21,289 --> 00:03:22,770
because it just never gets any

112
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:24,530
good placements and then what i'm

113
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:24,719
going

114
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:26,300
to do here for these guys in

115
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:28,250
particular is we're going to add

116
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,030
in some of their new ads that we

117
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:30,479
have

118
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:35,039
for them so i'm actually going to

119
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:37,030
edit these and label them

120
00:03:37,169 --> 00:03:40,560
i want to we basically change the

121
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,590
messaging in their ads to say

122
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:45,560
specifically like if you're using

123
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:47,340
this software called exactimate

124
00:03:47,669 --> 00:03:49,490
so that's why i'm labeling them

125
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,490
just so in the actual library of

126
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:52,289
the ad account

127
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:54,819
and all the media i can see like

128
00:03:54,819 --> 00:03:56,889
exactly what these are it just

129
00:03:56,889 --> 00:03:58,400
keeps us very very uh

130
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:00,819
organized and then actually what

131
00:04:00,969 --> 00:04:03,330
i'm going to do too is i'm going

132
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,319
to do dct one two three

133
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:12,479
all right keeps us super organized

134
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:14,800
it's the biggest thing when you're

135
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,599
launching ads to stay

136
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:16,610
organized because then you know

137
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:18,050
what's working you know it's not

138
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:19,339
working all that fun stuff

139
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,040
especially when you go in to

140
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,240
analyze the account

141
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:24,009
at later dates i've made the

142
00:04:24,459 --> 00:04:25,720
mistake in the past of just

143
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,839
launching ads and not labeling

144
00:04:26,939 --> 00:04:27,439
stuff you're like

145
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,810
like did i launch that one did i

146
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,709
not launch that one right let's be

147
00:04:30,709 --> 00:04:32,399
able to let these upload and

148
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,509
then i'm going to show you guys

149
00:04:33,509 --> 00:04:34,709
what we're doing on the copy side

150
00:04:34,709 --> 00:04:35,759
so always make sure this is

151
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:36,079
checked

152
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,050
on optimize creative for each

153
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,029
person we have three pieces of

154
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:43,759
body copy we're not maxing it out

155
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:44,000
even

156
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,470
though these guys are at 500 a day

157
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:46,540
and spend on this respective

158
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:47,769
campaign we're not maxing out the

159
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:50,399
sets here we have five headlines

160
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:52,509
which honestly we could trim this

161
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:54,319
down i'm actually going to do some

162
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:54,470
right

163
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,759
so if we are going to do some

164
00:04:56,779 --> 00:05:00,000
right now on using exact admit

165
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,720
we can get you paid more

166
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:21,279
for roofers who use exact admit

167
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:38,120
and of course we have our url

168
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,850
there we turned all these browser

169
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:42,319
add-ons on sometimes you're gonna

170
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,540
have like call and all this crap

171
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,509
added we usually just do learn

172
00:05:45,509 --> 00:05:47,839
more this is our hyros code right

173
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:48,000
there

174
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,920
and some utms to pass through into

175
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:51,600
the crm

176
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:55,339
and yeah usually what we do here

177
00:05:55,589 --> 00:05:58,889
is we have dct102 actually this

178
00:05:58,889 --> 00:06:00,480
will be 103 because this is test

179
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,790
number three and then what i'm

180
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:06,279
going to do here once these upload

181
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:08,959
and all the copy is the same

182
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:10,500
what i'm going to do is what i'm

183
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,410
going to do is what i'm going to

184
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:12,399
do is just go into here

185
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,720
and once these are uploaded i'll

186
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,709
have those in there but what i'm

187
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,439
going to do is i'm going to

188
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,009
quick duplicate out this whole ad

189
00:06:19,009 --> 00:06:22,519
set as well and we're going to do

190
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:24,980
the lookalike audience

191
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:29,300
that has performed relatively okay

192
00:06:29,579 --> 00:06:30,160
in the account

193
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:38,899
it's the uh hubspot lookalike us

194
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:58,459
whoops so i don't want to layer on

195
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:01,829
the interest stack with it so i'm

196
00:07:01,829 --> 00:07:03,680
just going to delete all these

197
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:04,920
so i only want to target the

198
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:07,040
lookalike audience with this one

199
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,980
there we go and in the interest

200
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:13,360
stack too we have advantage plus

201
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,800
on so we're using these as

202
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:17,410
suggestions right suggestions

203
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:20,079
because we want it to go beyond

204
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:22,230
these targeting options if we

205
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:22,339
choose

206
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:23,620
to do so you actually can't really

207
00:07:23,829 --> 00:07:24,779
turn this on in most account or

208
00:07:24,779 --> 00:07:26,079
turn this off in most accounts by

209
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:26,139
the

210
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:27,970
way anymore they're trying to push

211
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,600
you to more of a broad targeting

212
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:29,899
approach

213
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,930
we'll let that upload and then we

214
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:37,100
will launch these campaigns

215
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,199
so i'm going to pause it until we

216
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:43,129
launch all right cool now these

217
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,170
are in there we're just going to

218
00:07:44,329 --> 00:07:44,560
select

219
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,279
these videos

220
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,259
if you want to edit the thumbnail

221
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,470
you can uh we don't really do that

222
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:57,279
too too much but if

223
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,220
it's something like this is a

224
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:59,269
thumbnail like obviously we're

225
00:07:59,459 --> 00:08:00,160
going to probably want to switch

226
00:08:00,259 --> 00:08:00,480
it to

227
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,689
something to where you know it's

228
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:03,910
like a human face

229
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:10,850
cool can i publish

230
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:26,029
and sometimes when you're on the

231
00:08:26,029 --> 00:08:27,589
ad set or the ad level and you hit

232
00:08:27,589 --> 00:08:28,480
publish it's only going to

233
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,069
publish like one of the actual ad

234
00:08:30,069 --> 00:08:31,540
sets so you're going to want to go

235
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:31,910
to here

236
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,038
and i need to only do

237
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:41,590
publish a bunch of these but

238
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:48,309
it's bugging out a ton

239
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:52,779
these are all some old ads in

240
00:08:52,779 --> 00:08:54,159
their account just trying to

241
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:55,120
unselect so

242
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:58,860
publish all those and we're going

243
00:08:59,139 --> 00:08:59,360
to go
