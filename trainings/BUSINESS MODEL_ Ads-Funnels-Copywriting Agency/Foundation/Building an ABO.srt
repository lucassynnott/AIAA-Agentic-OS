1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,060
All right so in another video we

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:06,259
launched a cbo campaign which a

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:09,140
cbo is basically you telling meta

4
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:11,039
hey i want you to distribute my

5
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:13,089
budget that i set on the campaign

6
00:00:13,089 --> 00:00:15,050
level between the ad sets that

7
00:00:15,189 --> 00:00:17,070
essentially you deem is the best

8
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:19,050
combination right so if you want

9
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:20,769
to bias towards ad set one

10
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:21,620
and put all the spend there

11
00:00:21,699 --> 00:00:22,609
because you think it's going to

12
00:00:22,629 --> 00:00:24,359
get the best results awesome if

13
00:00:24,379 --> 00:00:24,699
you want

14
00:00:24,789 --> 00:00:26,019
to do a little bit more of an

15
00:00:26,019 --> 00:00:27,760
equal distribution perfect if you

16
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,339
want to bias towards ad set two

17
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:31,260
because you deem it'll get the

18
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:33,509
best results awesome no problem at

19
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,799
all an abo is the opposite so an

20
00:00:35,799 --> 00:00:36,380
abo is

21
00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:38,280
where we place the budget on the

22
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,399
ad set level and we're essentially

23
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:42,460
saying hey meta i have these three

24
00:00:42,549 --> 00:00:45,200
ad sets i'm going to put 50 a day

25
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,539
on each ad set i want all of them

26
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:50,159
to get 50 a day spent on them

27
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,560
in a cbo you would say hey meta i

28
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,979
have these three ad sets i have

29
00:00:54,979 --> 00:00:58,380
that total of 150 per day to spend

30
00:00:58,679 --> 00:00:58,679
on

31
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:00,229
ads on this campaign so i'm going

32
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:02,270
to put the budget on the campaign

33
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:04,200
level and if you want to spend 20

34
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:06,890
dollars on ad set one 30 on ad set

35
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,180
two and a hundred on ad set three

36
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:11,790
totally cool you know best you can

37
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:13,689
bias the spend you can pick which

38
00:01:13,689 --> 00:01:15,500
ad sets get the most spend based

39
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,400
upon what you deem is going to be

40
00:01:18,049 --> 00:01:20,019
the best for me to get results

41
00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:22,319
basically so an abo in this video

42
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:24,840
is what we're going to build um so

43
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:26,290
again if you're trying to get

44
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:27,969
leads do leads if you're trying to

45
00:01:27,969 --> 00:01:29,319
get sales do sales so if you're

46
00:01:29,409 --> 00:01:30,870
doing like a challenge funnel or

47
00:01:31,129 --> 00:01:32,200
something like that or a low

48
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,719
ticket funnel we do sales the

49
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:34,200
majority of the

50
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:35,530
time i don't really touch any of

51
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:36,980
these other ones unless it's some

52
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:38,519
sort of like content remarketing

53
00:01:38,609 --> 00:01:40,849
sequence that we do but let's go

54
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,680
leads i do manual leads campaign

55
00:01:44,769 --> 00:01:47,310
then from here if we're in an

56
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:50,590
account i'll usually do like smo

57
00:01:50,659 --> 00:01:52,760
uh that's our agency sell more

58
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:52,900
online

59
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:55,140
just so i know like what campaigns

60
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:57,079
are running i'll do cbo and i'll

61
00:01:57,079 --> 00:01:58,989
do the objective of the campaign

62
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:00,280
let's just say we're optimizing

63
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,799
around the schedule standard event

64
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:04,670
and then i'll do i don't know um

65
00:02:05,409 --> 00:02:06,870
you know fund one right the offer

66
00:02:07,129 --> 00:02:08,560
whatever it is so i'm inside of an

67
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:09,479
account right now

68
00:02:09,569 --> 00:02:11,069
where these guys raise money for

69
00:02:11,289 --> 00:02:12,830
their different funds so you know

70
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,360
i'm saying say hey we're raising

71
00:02:14,449 --> 00:02:16,810
for fund one right now on the

72
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:18,280
campaign level

73
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:23,520
we are going to go here and what

74
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,159
you'll see sometimes is you'll see

75
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:28,719
advantage campaign budget

76
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:30,080
you can turn it on or off now

77
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,699
advantage campaign budget and it

78
00:02:31,729 --> 00:02:33,400
might look different in some other

79
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:34,659
accounts like let me go into

80
00:02:34,659 --> 00:02:36,259
another account real fast here and

81
00:02:36,259 --> 00:02:36,919
show you guys

82
00:02:37,009 --> 00:02:39,409
especially if you if you do the

83
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,900
sales objective it's going to look

84
00:02:41,949 --> 00:02:42,830
a lot different

85
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:49,020
similar verbiage but we'll go here

86
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:51,530
into the one of our accounts that

87
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:52,199
is running

88
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,319
a sales objective

89
00:02:55,409 --> 00:03:00,009
so if you choose for example

90
00:03:00,009 --> 00:03:04,789
create campaign sales continue

91
00:03:05,169 --> 00:03:08,590
you'll see on the campaign level

92
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:12,280
campaign budget and ad set budget

93
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,960
campaign budget is cbo ad set

94
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:15,460
budget is abo right so it's going

95
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:17,020
to look different honestly on some

96
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,469
different ad accounts it looks

97
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:20,580
totally different too uh just know

98
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:23,030
that campaign budget or this

99
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:25,400
advantage campaign budget thing is

100
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:27,819
a cbo if you turn this off or on

101
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:30,000
the flip side you select ad set

102
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,960
budget that's an abo right so

103
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,120
we're

104
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:33,530
going to leave this toggled off

105
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:35,620
here we're going to make sure our

106
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,400
objective again is leads we're

107
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:37,719
doing

108
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:39,780
buying type auction i don't touch

109
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:41,810
any of these unless of course

110
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:44,120
you're in a special ad category

111
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:46,360
which you'll know if you are and

112
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,599
you can also just read here about

113
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:49,789
special i categories and see if

114
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:50,030
any

115
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:52,080
of these are fit for you then here

116
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,919
we'll do the audience so if we're

117
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:56,840
going broad we'll just do broad

118
00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:01,629
and if you're doing instant forms

119
00:04:01,629 --> 00:04:03,099
you click there most of the time

120
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:04,039
we're doing this though

121
00:04:04,129 --> 00:04:05,599
website which is basically going

122
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,400
to pull the conversions from your

123
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:08,120
landing page

124
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:10,199
maximum number of conversions we

125
00:04:10,349 --> 00:04:12,530
typically always select that then

126
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:14,199
we're going to pick the actual

127
00:04:15,969 --> 00:04:18,129
pixel the conversion event that we

128
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:19,879
placed on the landing page

129
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:22,660
then sometimes we'll turn on

130
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:25,790
dynamic creative other times we

131
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:27,879
won't in the last video i showed

132
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:29,300
you dynamic creative in this case

133
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,540
we're going to leave it off so i

134
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,120
can show you individual ads as

135
00:04:32,209 --> 00:04:33,480
well and then like i said we're

136
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,839
doing an abo so this is where we

137
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:36,629
place the budget on the ad set so

138
00:04:36,769 --> 00:04:38,139
if we put a hundred dollars here

139
00:04:38,139 --> 00:04:39,660
this ad set this broad ad set will

140
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,189
get a hundred dollars in spend

141
00:04:43,089 --> 00:04:44,560
then we could schedule it then of

142
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,410
course if you want to switch your

143
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:50,360
audiences and you want to start

144
00:04:50,449 --> 00:04:51,920
doing intro stacks and stuff like

145
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:53,290
that or put exclusions in or

146
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:54,870
custom audience you click this

147
00:04:55,009 --> 00:04:57,329
here switch to original audience

148
00:04:57,589 --> 00:05:00,060
options if you're doing broad you

149
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:03,139
can fiddle with the age here or

150
00:05:03,329 --> 00:05:06,170
exclude custom audiences or change

151
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:08,699
the locations and then i always

152
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:11,319
like to turn this off i do manual

153
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:13,620
placements and i uncheck audience

154
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,720
network a little tip for y'all

155
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:19,199
then here is where we'll label our

156
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:22,579
dynamic creative test if we're

157
00:05:22,579 --> 00:05:26,360
doing a dct but in this case we're

158
00:05:26,449 --> 00:05:28,420
doing actual individual ads so

159
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:30,439
what we're going to do is maybe

160
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:32,269
we'll do you know batch one

161
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:36,949
add you know we'll do like hook

162
00:05:36,949 --> 00:05:39,480
one body one right whatever

163
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,620
whatever that ad is you know if

164
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:42,110
it's batch

165
00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:43,420
one we're launching for this

166
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:44,889
client with hook one and body one

167
00:05:44,889 --> 00:05:46,600
we'll label it like that just so i

168
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:46,839
know

169
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,379
exactly you know what we're

170
00:05:48,379 --> 00:05:50,259
launching right inside of this ad

171
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:51,949
then from here manual upload

172
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:53,720
single image

173
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:54,920
unless you're doing a carousel or

174
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,209
something like that we'll put the

175
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:58,120
actual landing page here make sure

176
00:05:58,209 --> 00:05:59,699
to turn these browser add-ons off

177
00:05:59,889 --> 00:06:01,879
and now this whole thing where

178
00:06:01,889 --> 00:06:04,040
they do the setup creative now

179
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,800
this might change it changes quite

180
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:05,879
a

181
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:07,800
bit but make sure you turn off

182
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,939
these site links

183
00:06:09,089 --> 00:06:12,060
let's just go into here and pick

184
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,649
you know a random image say you're

185
00:06:13,649 --> 00:06:14,360
running an image ad

186
00:06:17,139 --> 00:06:18,600
i usually do original on these

187
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,019
because you know if you click

188
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,870
something like this 9 by 16

189
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:25,879
unless you upload a actual 9 by 16

190

and it'll add some like nice

197
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,160
buffer up here so it wasn't like

198
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:39,480
all cut

199
00:06:39,569 --> 00:06:42,649
off and weird text we're gonna do

200
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:48,120
you know body copy headline body

201
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,600
copy or sorry headline knows put

202
00:06:50,689 --> 00:06:53,009
some random stuff description

203
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,189
click usually do learn more next i

204
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:01,240
like to turn all this junk off

205
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,120
personally

206
00:07:02,209 --> 00:07:04,110
so i will turn all of these

207
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:06,839
sometimes i will leave this one on

208
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:09,240
i'll leave add overlays on because

209
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:09,399
that's

210
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:11,639
actually looking relatively okay

211
00:07:11,689 --> 00:07:13,639
usually i'll turn this off too

212
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:16,439
i'll keep enhanced cta on

213
00:07:16,529 --> 00:07:17,990
too sometimes but i'll turn off

214
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,720
text improvements so usually like

215
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,550
these are the only two that i

216
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:24,120
typically will turn on um but most

217
00:07:24,269 --> 00:07:26,519
of the time i'll even like turn

218
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:28,199
this one off but other than that

219
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:30,259
all the other stuff like the music

220
00:07:30,259 --> 00:07:32,009
the visual touch-ups um 3d

221
00:07:32,009 --> 00:07:34,110
animations sometimes i will keep

222
00:07:34,189 --> 00:07:34,199
the

223
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:36,189
visual touch-ups on but honestly

224
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:38,100
like i'll see a lot of times these

225
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,310
things get cropped

226
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:41,399
out and it just looks super super

227
00:07:41,509 --> 00:07:43,600
ugly um like half the image will

228
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,399
be showing on the whole page

229
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:47,459
it's just a mess so keep those on

230
00:07:47,459 --> 00:07:49,480
if you want you turn them all on

231
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,800
or turn them all off if you'd like

232
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:53,620
again we still don't want to max

233
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,370
out all of these so we can put up

234
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:57,800
to five primary texts and five

235
00:07:57,889 --> 00:07:59,879
headlines and five descriptions i

236
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:01,709
only will do about two to three

237
00:08:01,709 --> 00:08:04,040
pieces of primary text two to

238
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:04,199
three

239
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:06,230
headlines one to two descriptions

240
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:08,040
max unless even if i'm at a lower

241
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,639
spend level i'll just do like

242
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:11,629
one to two body copies one to two

243
00:08:11,629 --> 00:08:13,629
headlines one description and

244
00:08:13,629 --> 00:08:15,310
that's it so tracking if you're

245
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:16,870
using hyros or something you'll

246
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:18,379
put your url parameters here and

247
00:08:18,379 --> 00:08:20,110
then if you want to duplicate out

248
00:08:20,769 --> 00:08:23,100
the ad inside of the same ad set

249
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,629
do click duplicate and then all

250
00:08:25,629 --> 00:08:27,480
right maybe we'll put

251
00:08:27,569 --> 00:08:30,540
hook two body one right we'll go

252
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:33,029
in and again see it always tries

253
00:08:33,029 --> 00:08:35,000
to get you to turn these browser

254
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:36,580
add-ons on make sure you click no

255
00:08:36,809 --> 00:08:37,980
make sure every time you do a

256
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,720
thing sometimes it'll also turn on

257
00:08:39,809 --> 00:08:41,548
these stupid site links you want

258
00:08:41,548 --> 00:08:43,350
to turn that off too so then we'll

259
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:45,159
go in here we'll do edit media

260
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,399
pick another one go through the

261
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:48,840
whole wizard again

262
00:08:48,929 --> 00:08:51,309
right even sometimes it for this

263
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:54,279
particular image uh yeah sometimes

264
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:55,639
it'll like turn random stuff on

265
00:08:55,639 --> 00:08:55,799
just

266
00:08:55,889 --> 00:08:57,240
like be careful with all that

267
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,740
stuff you could also go here and

268
00:08:58,769 --> 00:09:01,799
look at the um previews of these

269
00:09:01,889 --> 00:09:03,230
enhancements and you could turn

270
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:04,659
them off you think they look like

271
00:09:04,659 --> 00:09:05,799
garbage so it's up to you

272
00:09:07,889 --> 00:09:09,350
sometimes different images will

273
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:11,419
look worse in the previews uh so i

274
00:09:11,419 --> 00:09:14,279
keep that in mind but meta is

275
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:15,840
really trying to push all their

276
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:17,830
whole their whole ai optimization

277
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,639
stuff and all these weird things

278
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:21,139
right and it's just odd so like

279
00:09:21,139 --> 00:09:22,580
even this one here has like the

280
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:23,879
click to learn more like

281
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:26,120
for some reason there i don't know

282
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:28,179
why but i would you know get rid

283
00:09:28,179 --> 00:09:29,480
of that so

284
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:31,779
then you put your url parameters

285
00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:34,210
there again if you're using hyros

286
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:35,149
or something

287
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:39,889
quick duplicate same thing right

288
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:42,360
hook three and then if you want to

289
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:46,679
run a new ad set we'll do quick

290
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:48,519
duplicate of the ad set

291
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:50,779
and let's say we're doing like an

292
00:09:50,809 --> 00:09:52,360
interest stack right

293
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:57,149
or we label the ad set

294
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,220
if we're building an interest

295
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:01,750
stack we'll go here use original

296
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:02,600
audience

297
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:06,169
and then we'll just start layering

298
00:10:06,169 --> 00:10:09,840
on a bunch of different bunch of

299
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:10,759
different interests right

300
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:12,190
make sure that this is nice and

301
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:14,299
broad over here and you're good to

302
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,720
go but that's an abo
