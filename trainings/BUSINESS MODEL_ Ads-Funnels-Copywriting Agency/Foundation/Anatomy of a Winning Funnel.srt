1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:01,250
All right, let's talk about what

2
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:03,180
actually makes a good winning

3
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:05,559
funnel and really what separates a

4
00:00:05,719 --> 00:00:06,559
winning funnel from a losing

5
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:06,980
funnel.

6
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:08,108
So first off, I just want to make

7
00:00:08,108 --> 00:00:09,199
it very clear when I talk

8
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:10,939
about what a funnel is, is I talk

9
00:00:10,939 --> 00:00:12,529
about everything from click to

10
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:13,119
close.

11
00:00:13,449 --> 00:00:16,480
So most people look at funnels

12
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,609
like it's just a landing page.

13
00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:18,730
You know, you'll talk to a client

14
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:19,940
like, yeah, we have a funnel.

15
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:21,160
And you know, they just pull up

16
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,449
like their main landing page and

17
00:00:22,449 --> 00:00:23,210
stuff like that.

18
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:23,359
So

19
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,500
I look at a funnel as the entire

20
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,359
experience, pre-click and

21
00:00:27,469 --> 00:00:29,699
post-click that somebody goes

22
00:00:29,859 --> 00:00:30,679
through, right?

23
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:32,270
So from click to close, they see

24
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:33,990
your ad, then what happens next on

25
00:00:34,119 --> 00:00:34,500
the funnel,

26
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:35,829
the landing page, all that stuff,

27
00:00:35,829 --> 00:00:37,159
what happens in the sales process,

28
00:00:37,159 --> 00:00:38,420
what happens after they book in

29
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:40,299
a call, everything from click to

30
00:00:40,299 --> 00:00:40,840
close.

31
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,350
So that's what I look at in terms

32
00:00:42,549 --> 00:00:43,810
of being a funnel.

33
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:44,780
So and

34
00:00:44,939 --> 00:00:46,659
again, by being able to have eyes

35
00:00:46,659 --> 00:00:48,479
on that entire thing and input on

36
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:50,500
that entire thing and influence

37
00:00:50,659 --> 00:00:52,020
over that entire process from

38
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,649
click to close, you become more

39
00:00:53,649 --> 00:00:55,109
valuable to your clients.

40
00:00:55,109 --> 00:00:55,700
And you can

41
00:00:55,859 --> 00:00:56,700
also get them better results

42
00:00:56,789 --> 00:00:57,880
because you can find different

43
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,320
bottlenecks throughout that entire

44
00:00:59,560 --> 00:00:59,789
funnel.

45
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:01,149
And you can actually get them

46
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,840
again, good results because you're

47
00:01:03,009 --> 00:01:04,040
acting like a marketer.

48
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:05,219
You're not just some low level

49
00:01:05,219 --> 00:01:06,659
media buyer who's pressing buttons

50
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:07,620
in the ads manager.

51
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:08,620
So anyways,

52
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:11,370
what makes a good funnel, right?

53
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:13,569
So from click to close, we have

54
00:01:13,569 --> 00:01:15,400
the ad, then we have the landing

55
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,269
pages that we drive them to, which

56
00:01:17,269 --> 00:01:19,150
essentially, you know, is quote

57
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:20,980
unquote, the funnel that a lot of

58
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:22,329
people refer to.

59
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:24,900
Then we have the backend systems.

60
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:27,430
So like think email flows, think

61
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:29,099
content remarketing,

62
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:30,099
stuff like that.

63
00:01:30,099 --> 00:01:34,299
Then we have the sales process.

64
00:01:34,379 --> 00:01:38,230
And then we got where you collect

65
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,340
that cash, that cheddar right on

66
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:41,319
the backend.

67
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:44,239
But pretty much from there, what

68
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:45,890
makes an actual

69
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:47,659
good funnel from a bad funnel?

70
00:01:47,739 --> 00:01:50,859
So the first is congruency with

71
00:01:50,859 --> 00:01:52,319
messaging.

72
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:58,799
So think about it this way.

73
00:01:58,799 --> 00:01:58,799
If I

74
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:00,150
had an ad that said, Hey, I'm

75
00:02:00,189 --> 00:02:01,510
going to help you fix your show

76
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:02,060
rates.

77
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:04,500
And then the landing page,

78
00:02:04,579 --> 00:02:06,609
I drive you to says, Hey, we're

79
00:02:06,609 --> 00:02:08,750
going to help you fix your close

80
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:11,090
rates in your sales process.

81
00:02:11,259 --> 00:02:14,659
That's not too congruent, is it?

82
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:15,050
Right?

83
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:16,439
Let's even think of another

84
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:16,979
example.

85
00:02:16,979 --> 00:02:18,099
Say you run an offer that

86
00:02:18,259 --> 00:02:19,849
helps people stop smoking and say

87
00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:21,520
the ad says something along the

88
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:23,539
lines of, Hey, look, you know,

89
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,240
you might just have some family

90
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,900
history of, you know, smoking

91
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,650
addictions and stuff like that.

92
00:02:28,669 --> 00:02:28,960
But

93
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,500
you know, right now you're just

94
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,099
maybe enjoying one or two cigars a

95
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:32,560
month.

96
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:34,039
And you're like, I just want

97
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:35,509
to get a grip on this and ensure

98
00:02:35,509 --> 00:02:37,069
that this doesn't turn into a big

99
00:02:37,069 --> 00:02:38,599
nicotine addiction and a big

100
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:39,000
problem,

101
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:39,560
right?

102
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,520
Something very light like that on

103
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,419
the ad level.

104
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:44,449
And then say, you know, it drives

105
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:45,419
you over to

106
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:47,319
a landing page that has something

107
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:49,229
like, yeah, you're a chronic

108
00:02:49,229 --> 00:02:50,800
smoker, you're a chain smoker,

109
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:51,629
you're going to die.

110
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:52,840
You have really terrible family

111
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,060
history and stuff like that,

112
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:54,379
right?

113
00:02:54,409 --> 00:02:54,560
It's

114
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:56,310
too jarring and it's not congruent

115
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:57,060
messaging.

116
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,500
So you want to make sure that your

117
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,569
ad says one thing,

118
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:01,460
your landing page says the same

119
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:02,030
thing.

120
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:04,060
Then your backend systems, like

121
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,580
all your emails says the

122
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:06,280
same thing.

123
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,830
Then your sales process and what

124
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:09,509
the actual, you know, setters and

125
00:03:09,629 --> 00:03:10,590
closers reach out

126
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:11,969
with in terms of messaging and

127
00:03:12,009 --> 00:03:13,569
different trust assets and sales

128
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:14,879
assets says the same thing.

129
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:15,240
It's

130
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,560
fully congruent.

131
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,659
And then ideally on the sales call

132
00:03:18,849 --> 00:03:20,990
to the initial discovery is about

133
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:21,750
that same thing

134
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:22,080
too.

135
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,530
And then from there, of course you

136
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:24,930
can branch off into other aspects

137
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:27,259
if it deems fit, but congruency

138
00:03:27,419 --> 00:03:28,219
is huge.

139
00:03:28,219 --> 00:03:29,810
I re I see some people's funnels

140
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:31,199
where the ads say one thing and

141
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:32,740
then the landing page says

142
00:03:32,909 --> 00:03:34,430
another thing and they try to like

143
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:36,060
fit too many characteristics in

144
00:03:36,069 --> 00:03:37,580
the copy on the landing page.

145
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:37,629
And

146
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,349
the VSL is like this whole big

147
00:03:39,349 --> 00:03:40,370
thing, right?

148
00:03:40,509 --> 00:03:41,629
It's the power of one.

149
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:43,819
That's a big thing that I like to

150
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:46,060
really focus on when we're writing

151
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:48,139
copy, making ads and funnels is

152
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,479
the power of one.

153
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,150
So what exactly is

154
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,360
that now the power of one means

155
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,659
I'm writing for one avatar.

156
00:03:55,659 --> 00:04:01,259
I'm focusing on one message I'm

157
00:04:01,259 --> 00:04:01,650
focusing on

158
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:05,030
one pain point and I'm focusing on

159
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:07,120
one solution.

160
00:04:07,169 --> 00:04:09,849
I'll give you another example of

161
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:10,080
this.

162
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,319
So we had a client

163
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,259
who is running challenge funnels.

164
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:14,919
So they're selling three day

165
00:04:14,969 --> 00:04:16,899
tickets to a live virtual workshop

166
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:17,379
where they teach

167
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:18,769
people how to invest in

168
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:20,490
multifamily real estate.

169
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:22,319
So initially when we brought them

170
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:24,180
on, they had a

171
00:04:24,339 --> 00:04:25,779
offer where it was basically like

172
00:04:25,779 --> 00:04:27,339
they're selling a ticket to this

173
00:04:27,339 --> 00:04:29,060
workshop in this challenge where

174
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,290
they're going to help you invest

175
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:33,680
in multifamily real estate, plus

176
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,279
help you like drop your taxes with

177
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:37,449
those properties and everything

178
00:04:37,449 --> 00:04:38,449
like that and show you some tax

179
00:04:38,449 --> 00:04:38,990
strategies.

180
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:40,160
And it was just really like

181
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:42,240
convoluted, confusing and weird,

182
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:42,779
right?

183
00:04:42,779 --> 00:04:44,639
It was like, Hey, we're going to

184
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:45,540
show you how to

185
00:04:45,699 --> 00:04:47,230
find these multifamily buildings

186
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:48,720
and then use them to offset your

187
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,360
taxes and then show you these tax

188
00:04:50,529 --> 00:04:51,660
strategies in the back half.

189
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:52,860
It's like too many things.

190
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:53,959
There's too many ideas.

191
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:54,620
There's not one

192
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:56,310
central through line, not one

193
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:57,220
central idea.

194
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:58,949
So what we did was we just slashed

195
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,000
the tax end because we

196
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,350
looked at their sales call

197
00:05:01,389 --> 00:05:03,029
recordings and we looked at why

198
00:05:03,029 --> 00:05:04,939
people were joining their program

199
00:05:04,939 --> 00:05:05,389
in the first

200
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,040
place and ascending and why people

201
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,490
would show up to the event in the

202
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:09,220
first place.

203
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:09,959
And it was just

204
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,170
because they wanted to find their

205
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:12,350
first multifamily property.

206
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:12,939
That was it.

207
00:05:12,939 --> 00:05:13,889
So all the messaging

208
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:16,279
was centered around this one idea

209
00:05:16,389 --> 00:05:18,300
of saying, Hey, during this three

210
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:20,120
day workshop, we're going to

211
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:21,629
help you find your first

212
00:05:21,629 --> 00:05:23,839
multifamily property that you can

213
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:26,250
get cash out that you can, that

214
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,060
you can

215
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,769
invest in and get passive monthly

216
00:05:28,769 --> 00:05:29,550
cashflow on.

217
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:30,269
That was it.

218
00:05:30,269 --> 00:05:31,920
That's the power of one, right?

219
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,269
It wasn't

220
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,480
this weird convoluted, double

221
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,250
ended sort of offer and messaging

222
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,759
and this confusing thing.

223
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:39,579
It was just

224
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,480
centered around one idea and now

225
00:05:41,589 --> 00:05:43,509
it's just, it's just now centered

226
00:05:43,829 --> 00:05:45,589
around one idea of helping you

227
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,040
find your first multifamily

228
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,360
property that you can buy and

229
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:50,300
invest in with little cash down.

230
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,079
So way easier

231
00:05:52,209 --> 00:05:53,959
to write all the copy, the through

232
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:54,829
lines easier.

233
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:56,410
The ads say the same thing.

234
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,829
The landing page says the

235
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:58,420
same thing.

236
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,560
It just goes more in depth into it

237
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,660
and how they're going to help you

238
00:06:00,769 --> 00:06:01,620
do it on the challenge.

239
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:03,889
The backend systems, same thing.

240
00:06:03,889 --> 00:06:05,740
The sales process, same thing.

241
00:06:06,019 --> 00:06:07,180
The workshop itself,

242
00:06:07,339 --> 00:06:07,939
same thing.

243
00:06:07,939 --> 00:06:09,839
They're not talking about taxes.

244
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:10,790
It's one thing.

245
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:12,389
It's going to help you a lot with

246
00:06:12,459 --> 00:06:12,579
your

247
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:14,709
copy and making funnels win.

248
00:06:14,709 --> 00:06:16,540
Because if you try to throw too

249
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:19,060
many things in there and too many

250
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:19,290
things

251
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:20,550
in your headline, your copy, your

252
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:21,740
VSL, your ads, all that, you're

253
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:22,980
just going to confuse a prospect

254
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:23,220
and

255
00:06:23,339 --> 00:06:23,819
they're going to bounce.

256
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:25,779
Plus, if you have both of these

257
00:06:25,779 --> 00:06:27,980
things here, if I'm talking about

258
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:28,439
taxes

259
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,370
and multifamily real estate, I

260
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:32,379
need to find somebody that wants

261
00:06:32,379 --> 00:06:34,689
both of these things at the same

262
00:06:34,689 --> 00:06:34,959
time

263
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,519
for them to convert, right?

264
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:38,029
They have to want to drop their

265
00:06:38,029 --> 00:06:39,779
taxes and resonate with that.

266
00:06:39,779 --> 00:06:40,300
And at the

267
00:06:40,459 --> 00:06:41,800
same time, want to buy multifamily

268
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,449
real estate.

269
00:06:42,449 --> 00:06:43,500
So my pool is smaller.

270
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:50,040
So that's the first thing is

271
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:50,990
congruency.

272
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:52,680
And the second thing is just

273
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,860
overall design.

274
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,680
I don't know why a lot of people

275
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,779
just don't put

276
00:06:56,939 --> 00:06:58,660
effort into making their funnels

277
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:00,069
look and function well,

278
00:07:00,069 --> 00:07:01,980
especially, you know, being

279
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,079
responsive on

280
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:03,839
mobile.

281
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:05,430
That's a huge thing.

282
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:07,449
And just making them nice and

283
00:07:07,529 --> 00:07:08,819
custom branded.

284
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:11,350
Like most of the time I land

285
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:12,779
on some and I'm like, this

286
00:07:12,779 --> 00:07:14,610
literally looks like I'm going to

287
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:15,300
get scammed.

288
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:17,110
I feel like, like you guys know

289
00:07:17,339 --> 00:07:19,209
when you go on those weird, like

290
00:07:19,209 --> 00:07:21,379
webs, how weird websites, let's

291
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:22,500
back it up here.

292
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,660
I'm not like that.

293
00:07:23,829 --> 00:07:25,689
Anyways, those websites on like,

294
00:07:25,689 --> 00:07:27,449
like stream East trying to like

295
00:07:27,449 --> 00:07:29,959
find different, like UFC fights

296
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:30,959
for free and all that.

297
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:32,550
And I always pay for the fights.

298
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:33,879
I never, never pirate them.

299
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:34,740
But anyways,

300
00:07:34,899 --> 00:07:36,240
you know, when you click on like

301
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,930
those videos, and it keeps popping

302
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:39,220
up with all this stuff.

303
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:40,040
And it's

304
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:42,139
like, Oh, you know, this near you

305
00:07:42,139 --> 00:07:43,959
this gambling thing or this offer

306
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,000
for this app and all this stuff,

307
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,509
like most people's funnels in

308
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:49,079
landing pages, like look like

309
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:49,319
that.

310
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:51,939
So put the time and effort into

311
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,810
making it custom branded and also

312
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:55,269
making sure that it's mobile

313
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:56,220
optimized.

314
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,600
That's a huge thing.

315
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,149
The majority of traffic is going

316
00:07:59,149 --> 00:07:59,839
to be mobile.

317
00:07:59,939 --> 00:08:00,930
So ensure that is mobile

318
00:08:01,209 --> 00:08:01,589
optimized.

319
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:02,740
Does everything

320
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:03,329
load nice?

321
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:04,899
Is all of the, on your landing

322
00:08:04,899 --> 00:08:06,410
page, are you following best

323
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:07,639
practices, right?

324
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:08,699
Is your headline

325
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:09,089
here?

326
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:11,149
If you have a VSL here, you know,

327
00:08:11,149 --> 00:08:13,120
your sub headline, is it clean to

328
00:08:13,149 --> 00:08:13,709
read?

329
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,079
Is your button

330
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,149
above the fold, your CTA above the

331
00:08:17,149 --> 00:08:18,149
fold, right?

332
00:08:18,149 --> 00:08:19,870
You want to make sure all this

333
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:21,220
stuff on mobile is above

334
00:08:21,379 --> 00:08:22,970
the fold, all the key elements,

335
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:24,639
and just make sure it doesn't look

336
00:08:24,829 --> 00:08:27,620
again, scammy, confusing, blocky,

337
00:08:27,779 --> 00:08:28,579
all this stuff.

338
00:08:28,579 --> 00:08:30,329
You want to ensure that design is

339
00:08:30,329 --> 00:08:31,540
very crisp and clean.

340
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,259
So that's something that a lot

341
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,710
of people overlook, but it really

342
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:36,019
can help the conversions a lot.

343
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:38,460
So, and the third thing in

344
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:40,418
making a winning funnel is making

345
00:08:40,529 --> 00:08:42,139
sure that you pair the right

346
00:08:42,139 --> 00:08:43,570
conversion mechanism

347
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:48,340
slash funnel type, which

348
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:51,370
essentially are the same thing

349
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:53,759
with the right offer.

350
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,769
Okay.

351
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:55,539
So if you have an

352
00:08:55,779 --> 00:08:56,929
offer that needs a lot of

353
00:08:56,929 --> 00:08:58,909
educating and it's not necessarily

354
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:00,830
something like super intuitive,

355
00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:01,279
like a

356
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:03,029
staffing company or something like

357
00:09:03,029 --> 00:09:04,509
that, like maybe it's this new

358
00:09:04,509 --> 00:09:06,480
sort of business opportunity that

359
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,200
really not a lot of people have

360
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,059
heard about.

361
00:09:09,059 --> 00:09:10,850
That's where I would do some sort

362
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,559
of funnel, like a webinar

363
00:09:12,779 --> 00:09:14,779
funnel or some sort of funnel,

364
00:09:14,779 --> 00:09:17,159
even like a challenge funnel.

365
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:19,539
Now, obviously challenges you

366
00:09:19,539 --> 00:09:20,379
can't run

367
00:09:20,539 --> 00:09:21,779
too, too continuously.

368
00:09:21,779 --> 00:09:23,480
These are more like bi-monthly or

369
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,379
quarterly events, but that's where

370
00:09:25,379 --> 00:09:26,080
I would pick

371
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,429
some sort of mechanism, like a

372
00:09:27,429 --> 00:09:28,919
webinar funnel to where, Hey, I

373
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:30,539
need to spend more time educating

374
00:09:30,539 --> 00:09:30,779
these

375
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,129
people on my process or this

376
00:09:32,169 --> 00:09:33,799
opportunity in order for them to

377
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:34,409
convert.

378
00:09:34,409 --> 00:09:35,919
And with the call funnel, I just

379
00:09:36,049 --> 00:09:37,269
don't necessarily have that time.

380
00:09:37,309 --> 00:09:38,370
Unless of course you have the

381
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:39,639
backend systems in place, but

382
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:40,019
that's

383
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:40,820
more advanced.

384
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,370
This is where you could experiment

385
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:43,870
with something like a webinar.

386
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:44,840
So I see some people

387
00:09:45,009 --> 00:09:46,190
trying to just jam this

388
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:48,629
convoluted, crazy, confusing offer

389
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:51,059
through a call funnel without any

390
00:09:51,059 --> 00:09:51,500
backend

391
00:09:51,669 --> 00:09:52,750
education or backend sales

392
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:53,399
processes.

393
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:54,679
And if they just switched to a

394
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:56,100
webinar funnel, they would find

395
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:56,360
much

396
00:09:56,519 --> 00:09:58,110
much more, uh, you know, just much

397
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:59,460
better results overall.

398
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:01,259
And on the flip side too, I see

399
00:10:01,259 --> 00:10:01,700
some people

400
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,870
who are trying to run a webinar

401
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:06,409
funnel for a just straightforward

402
00:10:06,409 --> 00:10:08,210
service that they don't

403
00:10:08,289 --> 00:10:08,659
necessarily

404
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:09,649
need to run that type of

405
00:10:09,649 --> 00:10:11,049
conversion mechanism with.

406
00:10:11,049 --> 00:10:12,539
They can just switch to something

407
00:10:12,539 --> 00:10:13,200
more simple,

408
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,960
like a call funnel, and then add

409
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:16,620
some backend processes like

410
00:10:16,809 --> 00:10:18,289
content remarketing, good

411
00:10:18,289 --> 00:10:18,950
education

412
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:20,580
manually in the sales process,

413
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,299
backend email flows to essentially

414
00:10:22,299 --> 00:10:24,049
educate them, to essentially

415
00:10:24,049 --> 00:10:24,789
educate the

416
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,519
prospect and why their specific

417
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:28,220
service in general, why they're

418
00:10:28,409 --> 00:10:30,460
different, their process, why it's

419
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:30,740
different,

420
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:31,740
why they get results.

421
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:33,250
But instead, you know, they're

422
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,639
doing this like longer kind of

423
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:35,940
webinar, which look is

424
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:36,330
cool.

425
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:37,820
You can still make it work, but

426
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,529
sometimes you're, uh, just, but

427
00:10:39,549 --> 00:10:41,500
sometimes you just have the wrong

428
00:10:41,669 --> 00:10:44,110
essentially, but sometimes you're

429
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:46,230
just adding more friction and

430
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:48,529
you're running more of a, uh, more

431
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:49,259
taxing

432
00:10:49,419 --> 00:10:51,009
funnel, like a webinar funnel when

433
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,580
you could just run a call funnel

434
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:53,639
on that point and be

435
00:10:53,809 --> 00:10:54,480
perfectly fine.

436
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:55,750
So simple offers go for a call

437
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,350
funnel or something like that, a

438
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:58,840
much more lower friction

439
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,379
funnel.

440
00:10:59,379 --> 00:11:00,889
And if you need something that

441
00:11:00,889 --> 00:11:02,159
need, and if you have an offer

442
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:03,950
that needs a lot of educating

443
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,309
before the actual conversion

444
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:06,649
point, that's where you can

445
00:11:06,659 --> 00:11:07,909
explore something like a webinar

446
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:08,820
funnel.

447
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,860
And then finally, number four, two

448
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,919
real quick is just having a good

449
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,059
offer and offer that cold traffic

450
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:24,639
once.

451
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:26,559
So that is the main thing.

452
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:27,990
It has to be cold traffic

453
00:11:28,509 --> 00:11:29,980
optimized.

454
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:33,419
And of course, Mr.

455
00:11:33,419 --> 00:11:34,080
Fazio talks

456
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,330
about this all the time.

457
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:36,769
So go through his training for

458
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,340
sure on the offer side, but having

459
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:39,179
a cold traffic

460
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,929
optimized offer, something that

461
00:11:40,929 --> 00:11:42,509
cold traffic actually wants is

462
00:11:42,789 --> 00:11:44,659
going to make your funnels convert

463
00:11:44,659 --> 00:11:45,320
super,

464
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:45,990
super well.

465
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:47,440
So these are four things to keep

466
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,059
in mind when you're building these

467
00:11:49,059 --> 00:11:50,919
funnels and just

468
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:52,370
implementing these four things

469
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:53,679
will get you to a point where you

470
00:11:53,809 --> 00:11:55,399
can get good results through your

471
00:11:55,399 --> 00:11:55,720
ads

472
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:56,519
and through your funnels.
