testing your way to greatness in 2026 and beyond. This is the current set of best practices that are working right now as it relates to Meta Andromeda, what you're going to do on the platform.

At the end of the day, all the old school best practices are obviously invalidated as a result of Meta Andromeda existing. So, we have to update how we test and we have to update our ideologies and our beliefs about when testing is most appropriate and when it doesn't make any sense at all and is technically going to you.

And you also have to just understand campaign structure in general. This relates in its entirety to what we talk about as a central focal point on this channel, which is cracking million-dollar months. Whether it's the first million a month or the next million a month, we just sit here hand down lessons from people that have been there, done that. What I'm talking to

you about tactically today are from the lessons that we use consistently in my marketing agency where we spend a fuckload of money month in and month out very profitably for the deals that we do that we have net profit shares on. These are also lessons that we hand down to our Jeremy and our circle members, our master internet marketing students. We consistently see incredible results

across the board across many different business types, mainly high ticket product and service-based businesses. So, if you're new to the channel, welcome in. It's a pleasure to have you with us. Just quick earnings disclaimer.

I have no idea who the you are and whether you have literally any probability to go out there and make money. I am not saying in any way, shape, or form that you are going to make a million dollars a month or let alone a couple million bucks a month. I don't know if you can turn money into more money. And the odds are extremely low. There is a 0.1% probability

according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics that you ever hit $10 million a year, let alone the even smaller quantity of people that ever crack million-dollar months or the even smaller quantity than that that would ever crack a couple million bucks a month. So again, there's no earnings claims. There's no income potential here. I'm just sitting here handing down

lessons from people that have been there, done that, talking to you from a scaled perspective. Ideally, you're already sitting here doing a couple hundred grand a month or you already surpassed a million a month and are looking to get there for the first time or the next time. So very excited to help you out in this video. Without further ado, let's dive in. The first

thing that we have to talk about is campaign structure. Okay, so the way that we're currently testing is very different compared to how we used to test. So here's how our actual structures work nowadays. We typically run with two campaign types. And I want to be clear, the second type of campaign type, when we look at warm audiences specifically, we'll barely run traffic

to those unless there's a warm audience that's sizable enough to actually make it worth spending some dollars on. You can always run it, but it's going to be a very lowbudget campaign. And we like to obviously do things at scale. There's three adsets within this cold campaign.

We have broad, we have an interest stack, and then we have a lookalike stack. Okay? By stack, I mean we'll take a fuckload of, as an example, the interest stack, interests, behaviors, demographic traits. We'll load them all up into one giant ad set. We will not separate them out. Again, targeting is controlled by messaging. Nowadays, targeting is rarely controlled on the

adset level like it's historically done. That's an example of an archaic outdated belief. Messaging controls targeting nowadays. So again, we throw all these into one big old ad set because the broader usually the better nowadays.

Lookalike stack is the same way. I generally create a bunch of 1% lookalike audiences based on things like highest value customers, customers, leads that showed up to calls, qualified calls that booked in. There's four examples for you in addition to whatever else you may also find valuable. Point I'm trying to make is we just create a big old stack.

These three ad sets then all contain the exact same ads when you go down to the adset level. So on the ad set level, I usually launch with about 25 to 30 unique ads. If you have not yet done so, I have an incredible training on my channel here dedicated to all the Meta Andromeda best practices, how it works, some messaging best practices as it relates to it. We've gone in depth on

this on this channel many times over. And by the way, this started rolling out in November and December of 2024. They were isolated testing it. April of 2025, they started rolling it out to a handful of accounts. by July of 2025, it was ripping across about half the accounts and you're watching this right now, like this with an extremely high degree of certainty has already been rolled out

on your account. And if you're not updated to this set of best practices, you're getting absolutely cooked. Okay, but I digress. I won't make this whole video about all the specifics on Andromeda. I'm trying to keep it centric to creative testing. You can go watch those other two videos if you want more in-depth information, education, and frame on how Andromeda

works from a deeper perspective, and I'll cover it here with you. Back to my point, following the Andromeda best practices, we need messaging diversification. So, we will create 25 to 30 individual reasons that somebody should go and convert on our offer. And we will put those into individual ads.

That's right. We will not take a different hook and attach it to the same body and CTA. We will literally film 25 to 30 total unique through and through creatives with very specific reasons to go and convert. This is a very important best practice as it relates to Andromeda. Okay. Now, onward and upward.

Besides the 25 to 30 unique video and/or image ads, we'll also typically do five pieces of body copy and we'll do five headlines. One thing for all my extremely detailed folks that are tweaking out that I didn't already say it is these are the same five headlines and the same five pieces of body copy for every single one of these 25 to 30 ads. They're written in a way where

they're broad enough to have applicability across the board. Okay? We don't want to have to go and write five headlines and five pieces of body copy for every single individual ad that exists. That would be exhausting. Long story short, we also typically find that about one to three of these ads are going to get all the reach and all the distribution. And so this is the next

most important part that you have to understand in terms of an outdated belief. And that outdated belief I've seen really people in the modern scape with Andromeda. Here's what people with the outdated belief think and how they behave subsequently from holding on to that view. outdated belief is every creative deserves distribution. It doesn't. Okay? You're going to feel like

it's wasted effort when you go launch 25 to 30 ads and one to three of them get all the reach. Okay? That means, just to put it in perspective, let's say that we launch with 30. That means that we are going to have 27 to 29 with little to no reach. Like they'll have spent pennies, maybe if you're lucky, dollars. And you're going to be like, &gt;&gt; "Well, look at the videos. They

didn't get any reach." Like they they No, this is terrible. &gt;&gt; And you're going to get as a result of that belief. Because here's what you're probably going to do next.

What you're probably going to do next is instead of running this simplified structure because they still give a deep about account simplification in case you didn't know. You're going to go and over complicate your ad account, you're going to create an insane level, an insane level of audience overlap.

Okay? And you're also going to try to distribute creatives that the trillion dollar company doesn't think should be distributed against the ones that are more probable to convert and get you the outcomes that you're optimizing your campaigns for. So, what you're going to do is you're going to take one ad set, you're going to put one ad in it, and you're going to duplicate that ad set

25 to 30 times over, and you're going to put one unique ad per ad set. That way, those ads can all get reach and distribution. That's what you're going to do if you hold on to that archaic belief. And I want to be fair and saying, are there instances where that can still work? Yeah. If that starts to work better than what I'm currently saying, will I abandon what

I'm currently saying and start doing that instead? Yeah. Cuz guess what? I don't give a about being right. I give a about making money. Here's what I've seen. Because you have to also understand I mentor literally thousands of people, hundreds intimately and hands-on work with about a dozen different deals at a given time in our marketing agency. And we actively unlike

you, test against what we think is the right thing to do to prove ourselves right in reality rather than just in theory. The structure that I'm telling you here with these three adsets inside the cold campaign optimized for By the way, we'll do for our budgets rather than CBO. That way we can control distribution amongst the adsets a little bit. We'll go down on the ad level. One

more little pro tip and we'll make sure none of that stupid when it comes to the AI advantage creative stuff is turned on. No site links. No site links. None of the little talk. The only one that I like right now to be fair with the AI creative advantage stuff that they're pushing is the one that highlights a positive comment. I do like that one. All the

other ones can get You got to make sure all those are turned off. this specific structure of those three adsets, broad, interest, lookalike stack, the same 25 to 30 unique ads, same five pieces of headlines and body copy paired with each one of those, it just absolutely rips right now. And every time that I get somebody who joins into one of my programs where I

intimately mentor them, like my Jeremy's inner circle offer, links down in the description if you want to check that out, I see inside of their ad accounts and I'm like, "What the are you doing this for?" They share that archaic belief that, well, a bunch of my ads weren't getting reach and distribution.

you know, I followed what you were talking about about loading up 25 to 30, but you know, 27 to 29 of them didn't get reach. And I I felt like how could they be determined a loser if they didn't get any reach? And again, I totally agree with that logic. I don't disagree that that's a logical thought.

I'm just telling you that this structure just beats the out of that other structure where you duplicate an ad set bunch of times over and put one ad in it. It's very important that you understand that because what you think you're doing is you think you're doing creative testing. When you duplicate out that single ad set a bunch of times over and you put one ad inside of each ads

set in order for that ad to get all the distribution. First of all, you're getting artificially inflated costs. That's one thing to really consider. That's what we find time and time again when we test. We just get an artificially inflated cost compared to what this structure would produce. And on top of that, this is the most important thing to understand. We still

do creative testing. It's just a little different. Okay, so let me get back to that point. When we have this structure right here that works, okay, here's what we start to do. We will have an ad set and out of the 25 to 30 ads again 1 to three will be determined as winners.

Okay? And when we get this combination of winners right here, we will start to scale it. Okay? Which most of you never really do. You get stuck in testing your way to poverty. My goal is to test my way out of testing and get to the point where I can scale the out of something. So we start to scale. Okay?

As we scale and time has passed, usually we hit a ceiling. Okay? And with that ceiling, there's just a hard limit where we don't get the opportunity to spend above it. Every single dollar that we spend above that ceiling, the cost per result climbs, the result volume drops.

And so what we do is is we decrease the spend. We push it right back down to that ceiling. The ceiling becomes the key. We then convert this into what we call a foundational campaign. Or if you're running it'd be a foundational ad set. Okay? Now, watch this. Let's use the example that that ad set was one of the three, like my broad, my lookalike stack, my interest stack.

I'm at that point when I've hit the ceiling and I've scaled the out of that ad set and I've got my one to three winners within that ad set. I'm going to duplicate it. Okay, so what I do, okay, this is the if this then that logic.

Okay, so if this happens, okay, then I duplicate the ad set. Okay, and when I duplicate the ad set, what I end up getting is a new ad set that has the same targeting. Okay, and on the ad level, I have those 25 to 30 ads. Keep in mind, a majority of which did not distribute. Okay? So, for the ones that got no reach, those are the ones that we're absolutely going to keep inside of

that newly duplicated ad set. The one to three that did get reach, we're going to pull those out. Okay? So, again, we're going to take these, we're going to get rid of them. And ideally, what we're going to do is we're going to add one to three new ones, too. Okay? And with those new ones, now we're back up. We're fully calibrated again with 25 to 30 ads. We have one to three new ones in

there that replaced our winners. And we have all these other ones that didn't get any reach and distribution. Okay. This then goes back to a test budget. Okay. So, whatever you determine your test budgets to be, that realistically be where you'd want to put this. Okay.

Now, inside of this newly duplicated adset, yes, it's okay that it's in the same campaign. You then repeat the process. So, we get to the point where we then see the exact same thing. Okay.

So, we'll have one to three new winners. Okay? And out of those one to three new winners, if we like who's coming in from them, if we agree that the types of people that are now coming in as a result of those one to three specific ads getting all the reach, if we like that type of person, we're going to then start to scale it. Okay? Now, this is very important because I'm going to lead

you to another set of if this then that logic. If we launch an ad set and the one to three winners within that ad set sucked, okay? Meaning they're technically working like they're bringing in the result you want. They're technically bringing in a cost per result that might be favorable, but you go listen to the calls or you see who shows up to your webinars or you just

look at the leads in general and you hear the feedback from your sales team and they're saying like, "No, these people suck that are coming in." If they suck, okay, and you don't like who's coming in from it, then you duplicate this. You remove the one to three that are getting the reach. You now call those, even though they technically won, you call those losers. You try to stay

away from that types of messaging. And you do that process all over again where you now have a newly duplicated adset. You're going to kill the loser that you just duplicated from in that example because it lost and it has one to three losers running. We don't want to put budget towards losers. And then what we're going to see as a result of this is we're going to add again one to three

new ads. We're going to get to the point where we start to see some victory again. Okay? And we repeat this process. It's just a if this then that scenario. This is how we currently scale. This is how we currently create a test. A lot of you guys tweak the out. just to address a few key beliefs real quick so you guys can thoroughly understand this and like really get to the point where

you're making some serious money with paid ads nowadays in this postandromeda world like you if you are the type of person that just wants to see every single ad get distribution and reach because the logic behind it is I want to see which one actually wins you don't end up actually getting anything other than just an inflated cost per result that's all you actually get from doing

that you're also tweaking out because you're like oh my god I have ads that aren't being used that I spent time filming it's like there's literally no problem with that at all. We think that that's a great thing, not a bad thing.

We want to have ads on the side. So, when ad fatigue occurs, we can relaunch that ad set and we can overcome it. When we have an ad set that has some losers in it and we don't like who's coming in from it and we need to duplicate it and launch some new ads, we'd obviously want to have some ads laying around on the side so we don't have to go and film and start over again. You know, the craziest

part to me, whether it's a Jeremy's Inner Circle member, whether it's a master internet marketing student, it's never with clients because we'll have them, we'll be on their ass about filming and we'll be on their ass about getting us those videos and then we'll edit those videos for them. But to be clear, it's like the speed in which some of you guys take to just film new ads

and then edit those ads is unfucking believably intolerable to me. You guys take forever. Okay? And if that's you sitting here watching this, that's all the more reason you would constantly want to have ads on the side. Even if it takes you only 24 to 48 hours to film ads and turn them around, why would you still justify a wasted 24 to 48 hours?

You would always want to have ads on the side just chilling, waiting for launches. Okay, so this specific structure when it comes to testing your way to greatness, this is how it works literally right now while I'm sitting here telling you this. And I just want to be very direct in telling you this too. There's a lot more to this that I don't share here on YouTube, okay? I

share the real sauce inside of all my paid programs, which you can check out links for down in the description. We have Jeremy's Inner Circle, which is for rich people trying to get a fuckload richer. Twice a month, one-on-one calls.

If you're in the full Jeremy's inner circle, four times a year, we do masterminds here in person in good old Miami, Florida. You're welcome to come to those. If you're in full Jeremy's inner circle, we have the weekly group calls. We have a big old library for of all the historical weekly group calls on all the historical masterminds. We have unlimited access to Jeremy AI, a massive

SOP library full of 35 plus SOPs. There's a really active community and Telegram chat. There's a lot of other stuff that comes with it, too. Check out the link down below. And there's a wellcreated video there that by the way starts off with the price straight away.

So you can see a great example of VSSL's too if you go check that out. And regardless whether that program is for you or not, I would encourage you go check out the master internet marketing program, a 7-week live class, one-time transactional cost, lifetime access to the program. Every year we go back and we update all the material. We look forward to helping you through one or

the other. And whether you're going to do that or not and just check out more of my videos on my channel. Thank you so much for being here. We deeply appreciate it. By the way, one last thing. Came out with a new vlog channel.

It's Jeremy Haynes Vlogs. I'm doing more get to know me content on that channel. Whereas here on this main channel, I do all my talking head content with trainings just like this. So, go subscribe to that channel as well if you haven't checked it out already. Thank you so much for being here. Go get richer.
