one question that comes up quite frequently is can you explain the scaling process of getting to million doll months a lot of people find themselves stuck at low couple hundred grand there's even people who come through our offers nowadays we just had a guy just recently come through that was stuck at about $2 million a month and just could not break the ceiling you

can come across many different ceilings no matter what level you're at and in this specific video I'm going to address how to handle them my name is Jeremy Haynes and if you're unfamiliar with this Channel or are brand new and this is your first time watching first of all welcome in smart of you to be here all we talk about on this channel is hitting million doll months we take all the

lessons from the currently 40 different businesses that we've helped to get there and just hand them down to you inside of these videos we don't make any income claims we just simply take the lessons from these different people and hand them down to you if you're already a subscriber welcome back I've got another Banger for you here today without further Ado let's dive in so

first of all I pulled some inspiration here visually from Mr Ray doia Ray doio has an incredible book called principles and one of the visuals that he has as soon as I saw it just bingo connected with me mentally and I said if that doesn't represent how scaling works I don't know what does so I'm going to walk you through this process this is extremely common you can apply to

yourself if you're already doing low couple hundred grand and you're stuck you can even apply to yourself if you're just shy of 100K a month and potentially get to the point where these lessons are something you can Implement and again even if you are already at the million doll plus month Benchmark and again you're stuck this is likely why so first things first you figured out something

that works you got it row as positive and it's time to start the scaling process surprisingly and this happens to be clear and very transparent with you at almost every level of the game it's one of the most shocking things to me it's as though either people who are at the bottom specifically and have not started scaling yet they get caught in this like I call it tinkering your way

to Poverty you can split test your way into mediocre stagnant positions in business a lot of people will get attached to some Grand Raz that they have in some instances it's the opposite they're row as positive but they're not as row as positive as they think they should be simply put these people at this lower level that don't even start the scaling process typically get

attached to what a roaz expectation should be okay and rather than just being profitable in starting the process and making a whole lot more money they instead split test their way to Poverty okay and they stay stuck as a result of that there's nothing wrong with fixing as you scale but don't let split testing be something that prevent you from scaling in the first place at all

as soon as you get something that's row as positive that's efficient to be able to deliver on and is scalable okay you start spending more money a very tactical way to go about doing this is to make sure you actually set aside a set percentage of your total profit to reinvest back into ad spend okay that's one of the first booby traps that happens at this specific level of the

game before you even technically take off you don't even focus on re investment okay you're making the profit and just pulling it out and doing who knows what with it anything other than scaling with it that's for sure okay and in another instances it's not that you're not willing to spend more money again you just get attached to what some specific row as should be

we've had guys that have like 25x Raz when they're at this specific level and every time they start the scaling process their Raz slips to only like a 15 or an 18x row as and they start flipping the out thinking oh I need to make sure that it goes back up to 25 before God forbid I start spending more money and only turning a dollar into 15 or1 18 instead of a dollar into 25 is

how ridiculous that sounds spend more money we get other people as an example where they'll be at like a 3X row at you know something more conservative and again they start pressing the gas they stay at a 3X but they're like M you know I'd rather this be at like a 5x or a 6X so again they end up scaling it back down and even worse and this is kind of crazy to be

fair but you'll find people that like barely press the gas and then they just kind of get scared I don't generally find that watch my YouTube channel but hey if that's you it's time to put your balls on the table here and there and spend some more money when it's appropriate to do so but I digress let's move on to what happens next after you get something that's row ass

positive and working and you start to press the gas a little bit simple enough you start spending more money okay you start spending more money in scaling and again I can't stress this enough one of the easiest ways to go about doing this is obviously doing Financial modeling being aware of what we consider and I want to give some Cliff Notes on this a good great and intolerable kpi Benchmark

for each statistic in your model okay as an example of this let's say I'm running a call funnel I can be very clear on what my cost per call can go up to that's considered good really good like great and then if it goes above this it's intolerable I can't tolerate anything above that I won't be profitable as long as all my other statistics hold okay being aware of

these three kpis makes a tremendous difference for the certainty and confidence that you'll have as you start scaling same thing with things like show rate in a call funnel example close rate um aov the you're actually cash collecting per sale on average pifs funding Partners can also help give or take what you're selling uh any funnel to be clear can be modeled out if it's a

webinar as an example you've got your clickthrough rate your cpms your opt-in rate your show rate your conversion rate you know cash collected obviously it's all kinds of Statistics that you need to be aware of for those three different categories of good great and intolerable benchmarks for each one of those specific kpis if you go into it blind okay and you are oblivious to what you

can actually spend up to or what that kpi flux up to then you're going to lose a lot of certainty real quick when you start to spend more money okay there's going to be days that are really good there's going to be days that suck ass okay the suck ass days are like booby traps if you judge on extremely short-term time frames you have a much higher probability to pull back the

spend it's not good okay you don't want to be that kind of person you want to be able to judge things on a broader duration of time the contextual broader duration of time that's generally most appropriate to judge things by is your sales cycle okay so if I have an average sales cycle timeline of let's say 7 days I have to endure roughly 10 to 14 days because if I only endure 7 days that

means I'm technically only accounting for day one's spend out of the 7-Day window if I have a full seven days of spend I can technically start to judge it at the end of the 14th day you see what I'm saying you have to have a time frame that you're also aware of and tapped into in addition to the good great and intolerable kpis so you know over a broader window whether you're

still profitable or not okay can't tell you the countless amount of times we're working with businesses at every level of the game that just start freaking out the biggest guys do it and the smallest guys do it you got to know your certainty kpi okay and you got to know the duration and time that you can actually look if you are in doubt just look up the last 30 days worth of buyers

and look at their origination dates okay that'll give you the true average of your sales cycle you'd be impressed of how few businesses actually dig into these statistics and have accuracy on them most people are inherently extremely lazy and even though they don't want to identify as lazy they are and they don't actually look at these statistics for what they can truly be

they barely build any Financial models if any you have to do these things when you're scaling I promise it'll make things so much easier and and just give you a lot more certainty and confidence that's required when you're scaling and reinvesting dollars okay here's the third thing that kind of starts to occur okay something along the way just kind of comes up and there's all kinds of

different things that come up obviously relative to what specific funnels you have okay okay all these different problems I'm about to describe are obviously inherent to specific businesses that we've worked with your specific problems might be similar you might have completely different problems but something generally pops up some very simple examples let's use a call

funnel or a webinar that pushes people to book calls as examples okay so you start the process of scaling up and you might suck ass at recruiting good closers into the business or the closers that you've recruited have sucked AKA you might suck at training development and Sales Management but I let's use the example that the people you hired did actually suck obviously you got to go

through the process of hiring new batches of people and if you just focus on that one problem in itself that can be a very timeconsuming issue that can drag on for upwards of 3 to 4 weeks to get a closer recruited to get a closer trained and onboarded to get a closer officially tag teaming with another closer or yourself to officially get them confident and then to get the

closer on the phone that's generally a good like 3 to four week process okay that's one of the most common things that can typically hold a business back that's why I use this visual here right you start here towards the bottom where things you're in the figure out phase then you move into the window of okay I'm starting to scale and then you hit this phase right here where something

becomes wrong okay and you've specifically got to start paying attention to what is holding it back okay I'll give you another good one as an example one of my inner circle members he had paired up with another Inner Circle member to do his marketing good for him and this guy specifically started scaling and it did really really good for the guy he went from about 100

k a month to a little over 200k a month within the first 30 days working with the guy but as they started their scaling process one thing in particular popped up the guy who is scaling instead of following the scaling principles that I teach and like to talk about which are also some of the best practices out there such as only scaling about 10 to 30% a day sometimes multiple times a day

the cost per result holds within that same period of time while you're scaling up if you do it too aggressively your cost per result can kind of start to spin the wheels you don't get as good of a cost starts to get Out Of Reach really quickly which again if you're oblivious to your good great and intolerable kpis you'll just continue scaling anyway which is what this specific business did

so they were scaling about 50% a day for many days in a row trying to milk existing creatives that were really good in the words of the marketer but they didn't overcome ad fatigue we have a whole video on this channel it's one of the First videos that I posted on the page here that you can go check out on what to do to overcome ad fatigue protocol and of course if you're an

existing student of mine and something like my master internet marketing group or my inner circle program we have an entire PDF sop guide on overcoming ad fatigue titled what is AD fatigue DM me in the instance that you don't have it or tag me in one of the group chats and I'll happily get it to you to be clear ad fatigue is a huge problem and it's one of the most common instances to be

clear this specific example of them scaling up and then having the problem that they had to deal with it was just ad fa all they had to do is just relaunch their creatives with some fresh campaigns some fresh creatives within those campaigns everything would have been all good again and that's a very fast and easy problem to solve there's generally two types of problems that

occur at these different levels one of them is what we call marketing knobs coined by my buddy Josh Troy and another one is the people problems people problems are far longer to solve typically weeks at a time at a minimum marketing knobs are generally things that can be done almost instant taneously as an example overcoming ad fatigue just require some fresh

creatives that at most as long as the person can film or maybe you have somebody that can just make your ads for you can be extremely fast problem to solve typically within the day in other instances again if it's a people problem like the closer example I can drag on for quite a bit of time but what you'll notice is is you eventually although yes you deal with a minor contraction in

that phase specifically start the process of swinging back up again and when you start the process of scaling back up that's the period of time that we consider the make sure it works again phase okay the make sure it works again phase is generally where you want to regain some certainty okay we had a client just recently it was one of our Inner Circle members who had done a

webinar their last month's webinar had done phenomenal they flipped about 43k and a test budget to a little over $248,000 really good for them especially for a test they did a second webinar and they changed in their own words over 80% of what was done in the first webinar they changed the ads they changed the copy in the ads they changed the messaging of the page they changed the

webinar content itself and they didn't do so good the second webinar you know so they started the process of scaling up they got to the point where they executed the second webinar and it just did not go well at all as a matter of fact I'm pretty sure they lost money on the second webinar they get on a call with me to do a debrief and again we dig into it we find out it was very evident

why it didn't work it changed damn near everything instead of just repeating success uccessful actions and scaling it but then they go on to do a third webinar the third webinar is where you're in the phase of make sure it works again okay you don't necessarily have to contract back down that's the one thing I want to make extremely clear about scaling it's like you might think

in that example that they scaled up and it failed technically so then they got to repeat the process all over again but that's not necessarily how it works in reality you might just stay stuck at a specific level for a longer duration of time and then you start the process of scaling back up again until you reach the next new level this can represent the stagnancy that can happen at almost

any level of the game this is what I was inferring at the beginning of the video we've seen people stuck at low couple hundred grand a month we've seen people stuck like the guy who recently came through our funnel that was at about 2 to 3 million a month there's Plateau at all levels of the game it doesn't mean that you contract aggressively back down to the previous levels you were once at

just means you kind of stay stuck so like in that webinar example I just provided they didn't contract back down they just have to stay stuck at that level until they get the confidence again that's what's very key about this next phas to make sure it works again phase they're going to spend about the same 45ish K that they spent the first webinar okay they're going to return

about the same amount they did the first webinar price somewhere in that 250 range once they make sure it works again press the gas and start scaling you feel me that's as simple as it is so again once they get through that part of the phase it's pretty simple right you start scaling again you start pressing the gas and then the cycle repeats itself all of a sudden you got new

issues that popped up and you're just repeating the same same thing again and again and again it's never from my experience from what I've seen anyway just a smooth sailing ride all the way up there's always something and usually the something that it is are generally from three main areas and those three main areas are pretty simple and common in almost all businesses it's either a

sales problem a marketing problem or some kind of operations issue there are instances where it can be something else but these are the big three when it comes to problems that can arise along the way when you look at these windows specifically during these like minor contraction phases okay that's what's key you got to be aware of this specific cycle cuz if you lack the self-awareness

on the fact that this is happening you end up getting distraught and have a much higher probability to contract or just stay stuck there's a specific protocol that you have to do at each level of the game it's generally that simple if you're oblivious to the protocol of what to do like imagine you're driving down the road you pop a tire your little notification pops up on

your dashboard that says hey bro you got a flat and you don't know what the to do so you just keep on driving you damage the vehicle exponentially more if you just keep driving the vehicle and don't know what to do in that example it's the same thing if you have a check engine light some check engine lights are minor like a sensor going out other check engine lights are pretty

major and the whole point is you have some type of signal that you become self-aware of that helps you diagnose the severity of the issue and that can determine literally the need to pull the vehicle over or that you can keep driving take it back home and just service it at a later time every problem that has like little indication lights in your business you got to be aware of

the severity of them and what to do as a result again imagine if you're just oblivious to what those signals are how they work what they mean you're going to have a really bad time when you're trying to scale up to million dollar a months if that's the case cuz you're not going to know what the to do so if that's you or if you are stuck one thing I'd really encourage you to do is
