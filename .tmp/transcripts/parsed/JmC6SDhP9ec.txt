the ultimate follow-up machine one of the best things that you can do inside of your sales and marketing process is know when to deploy what based on where your leads are at in your sales process sometimes you get sales conversations that happen far too early on and your sales people will as a result about that they'll feel like leads are unqualified when in reality they aren't

they're just too early in the sales process and they have to be moved further along when you have salespeople that have those types of conversations instead of just throwing the leadway and saying a this person's un qual I'm not talking to him anymore no no no no you have to learn how to have like a launch control system where your salespeople are well Tred on the CRM and can flick

different toggles press different buttons and have different marketing assets deploy to those leads in that given moment that are most appropriate for them based on where they're at in your sales process my name is Jeremy Haynes I have helped 40 different companies right now hit million doll months okay all I do on my YouTube channel is hand down the lessons from

those companies to you I'm just taking million dooll month lessons packaging them into bite size put you on game videos here on the channel and trying to get you a little bit richer okay welcome in if you're new if you are already a subscriber welcome back I got another Banger for you here today so the first thing that you really have to understand is your sales cycle okay and you have to

be able to successfully map your process from A to Z okay a being awareness and where a lead originates in most instances all the way to the point of the close and if you want well beyond the close you can even take it as far as upsell territory if you want to in between there's a few key things that happen okay there's a certain point where a lead becomes curious enough to

officially take an action with the business they are not sold yet but they're going to be responsive to your direct response ads they're going to enter into your sales process or essentially go through your advertising and marketing process at a certain point they take an action okay book a call opt in for a webinar opt into a challenge funnel DM the business and start going

through a DM ad strategy fill in out an instant form aka the Hydra okay and just again entering into the sales process from here there's a pretty significant amount of education and framing that occurs and that education typically happens from three main things okay short form long form and your sales people okay salespeople always 100% of the time get erratic and pissed when

they talk to leads way too early in the process way too early in the process is somewhere in this phase specifically Al right after the person takes action but before they've consumed any of the content that generally pisses sales people of and makes them say hey all these people are unqualified which we know as sophisticated advertisers and marketers they're not unqualified

they're just early along in the process okay now we have plenty of strategies that we deploy around here in order to warm people up and get them to the point where they're better framed before they talk to a salesperson however the point of this specific video is not to sit here and tell you about things like the hammer them strategy the trust flywheel indoctrination assets trust assets or

really anything that has to do with all of your sophisticated email marketing strategies and your follow-up systems and your content remarketing systems after the persons take the action no no on this specific video what I want to talk about is what a lot of our highlevel clients do after they've already got those things built out what they end up doing when I say at the

beginning of this video they build like these dashboards okay where they train their salespeople on how to actually use the CRM in most instances what ends up happening is the salesperson will have these reasons that they can mark in the CRM like a drop- down field almost every CRM has custom fields and this is where the magic starts with this whole process okay cuz all you're doing after one of

these custom Fields get gets tripped is just if this then that logic okay so as an example if a lead gets on a call with our sales organization okay somebody in the team says this lead is too early and that is one of the reasons in this drop- down box that you put is too early well if that occurs then we want to have an entire marketing automation sequence that fires off to that that deals

with them being too early in the sales process okay what would too early in the sales process looked like it might be that the lead showed up and asked questions that again were just super surface level and you could tell they're at the very top of the sales process questions like hey what is this how's this all work why would I want to do it you know like questions like that that

again just like piss your sales team off from that that perspective okay if that's the case for you currently and you get a lot of that how much better would it be if you had an entire marketing automation process okay now let me just be clear on the definition of what I'm talking about when I say marketing automation okay cuz this this can get quite sophisticated for what

you're capable of doing so marketing automation can be first of all an email sequence which is the obvious option we have texts but in addition to that we have specific content remarketing SE sequences that can go out to people too so it doesn't just have to be our emails and our texts okay here's the key here's what all of this really boils down to is context okay context equals big dollars

okay big time money comes from Context when you treat everybody the same that's going through your sales process you're going to have a bad time simply put you're just not going to maximize every lead that comes through the funnel I want to be very direct when I say this this is so important to understand for why generally this is only deployed by the big dogs is because if the big dogs

can make a difference of like 5% of people showing up or they can make a difference of like 5% extra people closing or if they can make a difference of like an extra $2,000 in their aovs okay their average order values I mean guys it's it is Extreme the amount of money that these companies either leave on the table and lose or that they put in their pockets and make as a result of

just these small improvements in these statistics across these funnels okay so these dissertation re reasons that's the proper term for when I say you need to have a custom field in the CRM that just has dissertation reasons that's like too early okay and I'm going to give you a few examples here I'm not going to give you all the examples that we put our Inner Circle members on to but I will

give you a lot of examples regardless okay some dissertation reasons again too early okay now watch this this is this is one of my favorites needs X okay so what can X be let's use the example that somebody gets onto a call about your offer okay and your offer has like three main components that make people buy after they understand these three specific things okay so let's say that

the person comes through framed quite well on thing number one and on thing number three but on thing number two in this hypothetical example AKA why they just struggled to grasp it so they need more framing around that because when those three things that your company specifically knows with certainty if people know this before they talk with us their probability of buying is

dramatically higher let's just use this hypothetical example there's three key things that somebody just again if they know those things or sold on those things they're buying at a very high rate again we want to make sure we have sequences okay dissertation reasons and marketing automation paired with those sequences that can textually address those specific problems those

needs for framing okay we have a much higher probability to get people to buy during the follow-up stages okay and here's the important thing to understand dissertation reasons can range from things like what we just talked about like too early or needing specific framing things and it can also range over to objections so rather than just being specific to you know some of the

more like we'll call them friend end reasons that people are probable to you know go through some content like need something the objections are also things that we can create sequences for now the followup to this okay how are you going to go about getting this information so I call this part the consumables okay so we have to have a list of different consumables we have to have videos and

this is important to note right we got short videos we got long videos there was a uh recent Inner Circle member that we gave a million dollar a month trophy to Mr Daniel faio okay and Daniel is very smart guy okay we love Daniel in the group I love D after hearing Daniel I was like D I think this guy could be my best friend you know he has the same lingo as me I love Daniel but to be

clear Daniel in his vssl he was given a specific tip talking about his vssl and he was like just like you guys are sitting here on YouTube you have the ability to scrub through the video and you have the ability to see what I'm talking about and when and maybe I'm talking about something that you just don't give a about it's like all you're going to do is go scrub the video

with that little control slider there you're going to go find something that's more applicable to you that you specifically want to know that's tremendous that's great why not do that same thing in your vssl was the point that Daniel made okay it's the same thing in your long form content why not take a long form piece of content and break it out into shorter Clips okay and

give people the opportunity to consume it in three different ways you have the videos you have the the writing okay and then on top of that you have variations of consuming both of these one of my favorites and I can't believe I'm giving this tip out for free to be honest with you we've we've been having a field day with this tool in the Inner Circle right now we've we've been loving

this as a new consumable okay it's called gamma and Gamma can take the same information that we just talked about like videos texts and it turns it into this thing they call a gamma do okay and we we have again we've just been having a field day with this we've been loving it it's so cool to use and test and just try out and see if you get some better results at getting people to just go

through the information that you want them to consume so here's my point with this whole consumables part of the equation okay this is what you need in order to get this part of the equation to work okay so when one of the salespeople triggers a dissertation that says like oh this person's too early or all this person needs XYZ or oh they had this specific objection well from there

you have to have a good set of consumables for the person to then get smashed with in order to increase the probability to buy emails texts videos long videos short videos gamma dos sales people to have the conversation with that are willing to educate them and spend the time with them things like this these are all examples of consumables and again I'm going to add

that to the list as well sales person conversation okay these things matter is my point the consumables make or break whether this works for you and whether you're actually going to be able to create the contextual resources that the people going into your your process crave cuz if not what are you really left with really think about this what are you left with if you don't have

contextual consumables created that are contextual to specific dissertations that your salespeople has said hey this person needs this specific addressed what are they left with otherwise some random sequence that you might not even have by the way that's the craziest part like we find people all the time that are at a good couple hundred grand a month trying to

get to million dooll months that don't even have a post call sequence for email let alone for the content that they should get pivoted to seeing next the text what the salese should be talking about next there's just all there that exists so from that perspective really think about what I'm trying to tell you here okay you're in a position where after one of the most

important things that can happen in your business occurs a sales conversation or a webinar or something where the person could have converted and didn't you don't have proper followup built out that's contextual to why they didn't close and yet you wonder why you're at the amount of Revenue you're at not making more money it's like is it that shocking you know it's not to me

and here's the other thing for why that's probably happening cuz you have zero accountability and eyeballs on your business besides you and if you haven't been able to conclude to this yet as you're this far into the video you not having this means you need somebody's help like mine my eyeballs on your business are extremely valuable okay I would never let you operate without

these kind of things every single highle client we have uses them leverages them and gets pretty significant improvements across all these different stats all as a result of doing these things why aren't you join into my inner circle offer twice a month one-on-one calls weekly group calls we have masterminds four times a year we have a group chat full of rich people trying to get richer

that's very active where they all share things that are very it because we trust each other we don't let losers or value vultures into the group you're not going to join in there and feel like a big dog quite contrary to that almost everybody who joins in even if they're high couple hundred grand a month feels like a small fry cuz it's not necessarily even just about the amount

of Revenue you're at it's about what you know and if you looked at this specific video and you say yeah I don't have any of this and it's obvious that I should that's a perfect example of what I'm talking about you'll go in there and you'll start to create this and you'll share these things in the group chat you'll get my perspective and you'll get plenty of other people's perspectives

too everybody's there to try to get richer everybody's willing to help it's a very give and take kind of relationship that you develop with all these other people in the group besides myself I'd encourage you apply to join in there's a link in the description below and at the very least subscribe to the channel go check out some of my other videos every single video on this
