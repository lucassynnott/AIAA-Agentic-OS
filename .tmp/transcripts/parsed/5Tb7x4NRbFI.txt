I'm pleased to announce that challenge funnels are officially back it's been a long few years where webinars challenge funnels low ticket to high ticket and all kinds of other funnels that over these last couple years specifically have just kind of sucked ass whereas for the years prior to that Dark Age window they were doing phenomenal unfortunately during that last few year Hiatus these

types of funnels just honestly didn't work that well they weren't as effective they were lower on my list of things that got businesses to million dollar months and kept them there and helped them scale but I'll tell you what man they are fully back in today's video I'm going to go through all the best practices from a recent challenge that we did with a client that was about 1.9x

profitable on the front end on just shy 300K in spend so going into the challenge we are profitable and then we cleared about $3.4 million on a $110,000 upsell on the back end I'm going to go through all the best practices of this specific Challenge from this client from the advertising lessons uh the actual challenge lessons some of the marketing automation that helped with our show

rate we had over a 70% show rate for this specific event and we didn't frame it a challenge we framed it as a 3-day event I'll go through all the best practices in this video so excited to talk about this if you're new here all we do on this channel is talk about hit million doll months welcome in we take client lessons from the over 40 different people now that we have helped

get there and keep there and hand down to you in these little bite-sized YouTube videos so welcome and if you're new consider subscribing after you check out today's video and if you're already a subscriber welcome back I got another Banger for you here today so before we officially dive into this let me just pepper this in okay let me just Edge you a little bit we we made a video just

recently on how webinars are back I would really encourage you to go check that out after this because just like in this video me telling you challenge funnels are back live webinars with some very specific modern best practices are working well again there's also going to be some future videos you can anticipate from me that give or take the time that you're watching this might have already

been posted so be sure to check out my channel for those as well on things like low ticket to high ticket DM strategies and a few other strategies that are working really well for us right now so I'm pumped to like I said just Ed you a little bit on that to let you know that we'll be dropping some bangers on those as well okay let's dive in so let's get to the top lessons of this specific

clients challenge funnel let me be clear on what a challenge is first so we're on the same page from a vocabulary perspective challenges are live events that have an extensive amount of content challenges are typically best for sales organizations and teams that only do well with layup deals if you have a real sales team that can go out there and just outbound dial deal with like lead

magnet leads with Setters and successfully put them on a closer calendars and scale the up then you don't necessarily need to do something that's going to take as much time and effort as what a challenge event will challenges are extremely time and effort intensive they are not by any means efficiently executed there's a tremendous amount of content that you

must prepare as the presenter there's a tremendous amount of different ways that you can Tech technically execute it including other guest speakers becoming involved doing it all yourself which would technically make it even harder um the way that you execute it being on like a laptop a DSLR setup or going into a full-blown Studio environment like what this specific client did that I'm

going to tell you about in today's video Simply put we have a client right now is a perfect example they do about $1.6 million a month and literally all of it comes from their Setter dialing lead magnet leads book buyer leads and just very basic hydr traffic that's just raising their hand saying I'm generally interested in what you can talk to me about their Setters and their closers

are so good at taking that type of lead and converting them into a buyer that ultimately they don't have to do things like this so like I said a challenge is very effective to execute when you have a team that requires you to have an extensive long drawn out content process framing window prior to actually get them on to the closers calendars themselves eles most sales agencies as

an example require you to do these types of leads whereas if you have an internal team of real sales people like I said you might not need to execute on this challenges are typically drawn out for as little as 2 days as much as 9 days we had a client back in 20122 during the Hiatus the Dark Ages where challenge funnels really weren't doing that well that still was doing

about $1.5 million off a challenge they'd probably do a lot better on that today they did a 9-day challenge in an industry where they were selling people on buying land it was a real estate info product offer and they had a $40,000 product that they pitched inside of it nine days worth of 3 to four hours of content per day teaching people extensive amounts of information on land

flipping in this particular case in order to upsell them on a $40,000 offer the particular client I'm going to talk to you about here today has a $110,000 offer also in the info product space and uh again we've seen this specific funnel work across High ticket services we've even had a few clients in the high ticket Ecom space that have successfully executed challenge funnels although much

more rare this type of funnel strategy is typically used in the info product world and in some instances just in the high ticket service World in general so without further Ado let's dive into some of the best practices first of all you can do a paid challenge or you can do a free challenge here's some of the pros and cons to both paid challenges will obviously add some friction to the

frontend process you'll typically get far fewer quantities of people that are going to actually register and give or take the specific level of spend that you're going to put towards this thing that's going to dictate the volume of people that you're going to get in and due to the fact that you have a three to potentially upwards of more days than that worth of content to put people

through you're going to have a degrading show rate each following day so what you ultimately have to remember is and it's very simple to conclude to this people who buy the challenge have a much higher probability to show up people who opt in for free to the challenge have a much lower probability to show up that doesn't mean that free is unpr profitable it just typically requires

you to financially model things a little different when you execute these things let me also pepper in a few more best practices and the pros and cons to both paid challenges will typically also increase your show rate for each subsequent day that follows which you're going to want cuz typically you're not pitching on day one of the challenge generally you're pitching on day two of

the challenge which is a very important consideration again with free challenges although yes you might bait people in successfully to show up to the first day due to the fact that they have no skin in the game they generally don't give a to show up for the subsequent days that follow so you see a pretty dramatic drop off when you are doing free traffic again that does not negate the fact that

you can still be extremely profitable on a free challenge but for the case study in particular I'll cover in today's video we did a paid challenge okay in addition to that paid challenges a big Pro is that you have the probability more in your favor obviously to liquidate ads spend on the FR end of the challenge when you do a free challenge you can still have upsells on the back

end of the op op in that increased the overall aov from being free to at least you know tens of dollars or potentially low hundreds of dollars to be able to liquidate that friend and AD spend that you're dropping however very important to note that when I have a paid challenge in my case at a 1.9x profitability on the front end we obviously were already rolling in it

just going into the challenge itself all of the revenue that was generated was free and clear profit minus sales commission so in a free challenge give or take if you're doing it where you have some upsells on the back end of the opt-in itself that's going to dictate ultimately whether you have potential to actually make some frontend cash or not uh but again you get a lot more people

on free you get a lot less people on paid so that's something that's important to consider okay with this specific client like I said we did a paid challenge okay it started off really simple we had early bird pricing okay in terms of the general timeline we marketed this thing about a month and a half out so we gave ourselves about 1 and 1/2 months in toal to be able to

promote this bad boy and at first we ran the early bird for about a full 6 weeks we ended up extending it a little bit because that's when we saw the most purchases it was originally intended to only be marketed for about 4 weeks so it's important to note uh the early bird pricing essentially ran all the way up until literally the last couple days of the actual event starting up we didn't

intend on that we intended for about 4 weeks to be the early bird promotion and then the final two weeks of this 6 week timeline to be you know like a tiered price increase as we got closer um in addition to that we had a general ticket and then we also had a VI ticket uh the differences between the two the general ticket was about $79 all the way up to about $99 and

whereas the VIP was about $249 the differences were just things that you got access to the VIP didn't really include much more than just an additional breakout room session with the host of this specific event in addition to that it included just a few more like intang able info products just digital Goods The Standard General ticket you'll notice I put a range

between $79 and $99 there was a range of that where we still concluded to both being early bird pricing so we so we did technically jack up the early bird pricing just a little bit but we still noticed a huge quantity of buyers would purchase when it was framed as early bird rather than framing it like hey you missed the early bird and now you just need to buy in general the only time

that we officially got rid of the Early Bird like I said in this case was about 4 days out from the actual event starting itself so something to consider when we finally got to the point where we were no longer doing early bird this price went from 79 to 99 to $149 and the price of the VIP went to $3.49 now out of these two different price points there were also upsells on the back end

so in either one of these cases both of them had two not one but two different additional purchases that you could make on the back end the first upsell was $99 and again this is just another digital good it was like a mini course is how we framed it and then we had upsale number two which was actually cheaper believe it or not it was about $29 and that was for a book bundle the book bundle

included the book like a physical copy of the book that we would ship to the individual the digital copy of the book and the audio copy of the book um this in total put our aov at an average of about 140ish at the beginning and then it ended up finishing off in the 160s so what we just put 140 to 160 for our aov total here okay now long story short and this is important to note I mentioned at

the beginning of this our cost per purchase in this case our cost per action CPA was about $ 60-ish it ranged initially as low as about the 50s for the first 40 to 60k in ad spend and then it slowly crept up towards the tail end of that 5we window where we were still milking the out of the early bird pricing um I will say this I actually think that we could have had a lower aov

in the instance that we didn't have this little hiccup in the middle when we initially intended to raise up early bird pricing the standard pricing we did that for about 5 days in total and we saw a dramatic dip in total purchases which drove up our cost per purchase dramatically and then we brought back early bird pricing which lowered it right away but I still got not a

significant amount of spend off but enough to average up my aov a lot in that 5day window where we got rid of early bird pricing in the middle of it as origin intended when we brought back early bird pricing just to be very transparent aov obviously went back down a little bit as well however our cost per purchase did as well okay to be clear uh our cost per action fluxed all

the way up into the 80s so we were in the 60s to 80s throughout this whole thing that resulted in us at the finish of this whole thing being a 1.9x row as on friend end I was able to get off about 292,000 in ad spend so we were doing pretty well we flipped just shot we're just going to call it 600k cuz I don't want to do the mental math right now for what 292 * 2 is 600k in total uh

front end and by the way that was just from paid so all this is just from the paid side of things there were and this was actually quite surprising this is a rather significant organic business we didn't see that many purchases from the organic side of things I'm not sure as to why it'd be a lot of assumptions if I sat here and tried to be conclusive about why that was the case we saw about

a th000 purchases in total retros ECT when you take this math here let me just make sure I do the exact math for you so I don't get some random dip that tries to call me out on YouTube we had um a little over 6,000 purchases in total from this whole thing from the paid advertising and without knowing the exact aov off the top of my head we had a I'm sorry the exact cost per purchase

off the top of my head we uh I want to say we ended off in like the high 4000s or like the very low 5000s um in start of total paid ticket but there was a slight discrepancy in tracking to be fair so we weren't really ultimately sure the exact amount that we got from Paid versus the exact amount that we got from organic we just said roughly High 4,000 or lows 5,000 is what we ended up

getting from the paid side of things we knew that with certainty but again we just didn't know like the exact specific number that we had gotten um there were discrepancies across the board we had done a lot of funnel testing throughout this one of the other mistakes that we made in this whole process generally what we do as a best practice we have one funnel that's specific for our paid

advertising per Channel and then we have another that's specific to just the organic Channel and there was a new staff member that was hired with within this person's business that was responsible for the funnels they had sent us over one of the organic funnel links and we had not caught that issue for about 10 days of the full advertising process over that 6 week

duration of time so a little more than a week almost a week and a half we had an organic funnel technically attributing sales to it that should have been attributed to paid we did have tools like hyos that were able to help pick up on that and help with our attribution issues but due to the fact that we generally follow this like triangulation of Truth tracking model where we have

three different mechanisms for tracking so we can triangulate the truth and try to figure out what was actually accurate I can't give you like a very specific answer unfortunately which I'm sure you'll deal with too so anyway what we did know is we were 1.9x row ass positive and that unfortunately as well just that little tracking discrepancy also prevented us from spending a

fuckload more money as a result so I was only able to get off about $292,000 in spend over that month and a half um you're probably asking yourself just as I was asking myself along the entire way why aren't we getting off a fuckload more spend than this uh the other main thing that was preventing us besides just you know the tracking discrepancies throughout a few days of this whole

thing was the fact that we didn't know it would actually work on the back end cuz the entire intention of a challenge funnel is to upsell the out of people in the challenge itself so due to the fact that this was the first time ever that this specific client was executing on this we had no clue if it would actually work or not now although yes we were turning a dollar

into $1.90 on the back end we unfortunately just didn't feel confident to continue spending an aggressive amount of money cuz we also wanted to maintain that row as we didn't want to work it down to break even I will say this in almost every single challenge that we ever executed in the past and that will continue to set the expectation for for all future

challenges that we execute we tell clients we do not anticipate being friend and profitable is the expectation that you will turn a dollar into $1.90 on the front end the usual going into it no actually quite the opposite for almost all challenges that are executed you're generally losing money on the front end when you do paid challenges especially Nai when you do a free

challenge you're also losing money on the front end so it's important to note like in most instances you're not going to be able to just spend a fuckload more money in perpetuity as you maintain profitability on frontend challenge sales you are most realistically going to set like a hard budget for this thing you're going to have a gambling budget that you want to calculate to determine

whether it's actually worth it or not to go above that budget at a certain point based on what your cost of acquiring a challenge opin or a paid challenge buyer actually comes out to ultimately if you're profitable like I was and you do not want to operate out of a fear-based mindset and you have a lot of confidence that you're actually going to be able to upsell the out of people I would

encourage spending as much money as humanly possible that your credit card will allow you to while paying it off in real time if you are maintaining front-end profitability on a paid or free version of a challenge get as many people as you possibly can the issues that you wanted to deal with like what we dealt with here in this example was we had to call up zoom and we had to

say hey it seems like there's a hard limit of 5,000 people that we can successfully have on this and uh we we were actually working with a zoom engineer for the solution of how to successfully execute this we had a little over 70% show rate the exact amount came out to about 70 point something for the exact show rate on this whole thing and that was phenomenal

but again you can expect that kind of show rate when you do a paid challenge you can typically anticipate webinar show rates for free challenges which can conservatively be as low as like 12 to 15% so just keep that in mind very important to consider this whole thing um okay outside of AD spend and just frontend acquisition I want to be really clear when I say this the show rate to

getting people to be excited about the challenge and to make sure that you have as big of a show rate as you possibly can have you want to follow all the best practices that we've laid out on this channel historically so one of those best challenges when it comes to show rate was the hammer them strategy we milked the living out of the hammer them strategy and we had to do it a

little bit more aggressive than what we would generally do because in this case we had a little over 6,000 different people that we had to hammer and it was broad duration of time typically with the hammer them strategy we have a very shortterm window with a very tight audience okay so for all those unfamiliar or unaware the hammer themm strategy is a Content marketing strategy

that I created uh just over these last about year and a half almost two years now that we've been using mainly for call funnels originally what we noticed with the hammer themm strategy was when somebody would book a call prior to them actually showing up to the call if we could successfully get about $15 to 20 originally short form pieces of content that fell into these four different

quadrants of content categories we had a lot of success with moving the lead that booked the call further down the sales process a lot of the sales feedback were things like hey these leads feel much warmer our goal with content marketing strategies like that is to replicate the organic sales process as close as humanly possible with what we do now with the hammer them strategy outside of

just short form we've also Incorporated long form content into it as well so we have two different campaigns that will successfully run for it one with short form and one with long form so ideally in the context of a call funnel in this example for where it originated prior to the call we would get a lot of content in front of a lead prior to them actually showing up for that call we've

used the hammer themm strategy successfully on things like the Hydra for all those unfamiliar the Hydra is my lead form strategy that we created uh almost 5 years ago at this point and it's just using the instant forms and Lead forms on these social platforms for advertising uh they very direct and they typically cut out the application part of a call funnel um they're really

really effective as a strategy when you have a great team of Setters like that example I provided at the beginning of this video for the client doing 1.6 mil a month off lead magnets and low ticket to high ticket upselling however I digress the hammer them strategy has a lot of Effectiveness there as well because we can take the content as soon as somebody opts in and just start

hammering the out of the person and on average we can gauge how long does it take for the setter to successfully establish a meaningful conversation ation and generally if it's not immediate it still has about a 7-Day window in most instances where we're hammering the out of the person with a lot of content not to digress too much but I want to I want to be really

clear when I say this when you do it for something like a webinar as an example you use the hammer them strategy you typically have a broader duration of time and a bigger audience that you have to hammer so you usually have to spend more money on the hammer them strategy in order to get the desired frequency Target where you actually see effectiveness of running to hammer them

sequence the main thing that I always see from people who just watch my free content don't actually spend any money with me which by the way is a huge mistake I understand obviously you're going to want to go try things that I teach on this channel in order to make yourself some more money and get more results but you have to heed this warning in every video where I teach you

stuff I am very clear on the expectations for what you might actually see as a statistic to have the effectiveness of the result usually people who try my strategy like the hammer them sequence who then later buy my stuff and I officially get to audit it they always fall below the actual frequency Target that you must have to see Effectiveness with the hammer them

strategy okay so to be clear in the original call funnel sequence we ideally have at least a 15 to 20 count frequency on unique pieces of content reaching that person before the call time it's the same exact thing in terms of an expectation that we want to achieve for a webinar so if I get somebody to opt in and I have a two-e promotional timeline I want to have at least a 15 to 20

frequency count over that twoe duration of time but because I have a bigger audience I have to spend more money to achieve that frequency to see the result I'm after with the hammer them strategy within a webinar context that would be getting people to show up and getting people to buy at a higher rate in a challenge funnel I'm typically getting even more people that I have to hammer

so I have to spend even more money on the front end in order to achieve that desired frequency Target so as you know on this channel all we talk about is hitting million dollar months okay one of the biggest gripes I get from the smaller people who watch my pages is like hey Jeremy I don't feel like you're talking to me and I don't know if I can execute this successfully and you're

right okay I'm not talking to you about spending $1,000 a month on ads I'm talking to the big dogs that are going to spend a fuckload of money on the things that I'm talking about and that want to make a fuckload of money with it as well so with the expectation I'm about to set yes it might exceed what you're willing to spend in an entire month on ad spend but in this

context when we make 3.4 million dollars in one month that's the type of person that I'm talking to that wants to achieve that level of result with what I'm handing down in this specific video could you theoretically find a way to execute on these things at a smaller level sure but with smaller levels you typically have a higher probability to fail okay if you're in programs like my

inner circle group as an example where we do twice a month one-on-one calls weekly group calls on topics just like this we go through information at length to ensure that at smaller budgets you have the highest probabilities to succeed but we also recommend very specific strategies both for your advertising Ing and for your conversion mechanisms aka the funnels that you're

going to choose to use to actually see Effectiveness with whatever budget you have if you're just simply sitting here on YouTube watching my stuff for free I can't give you that context so you have to be able to successfully think with what is most appropriate for me to choose to do as an ad strategy or a funnel strategy relative to all the options that I have available you

obviously have to make that conclusion yourself if you're inside of one of my paid offers as I mentioned like my inner circle which also includes our quarterly inperson Mastermind minds and we have a group chat that you can tag me and just ask questions to everybody else in there it's a little over 130 people currently in the group that are all rich people trying to get a hell of a lot richer

doing things similar to you they're offer owners people who are category Kings or to the few girls that we have in there category queens that are attempting to make a fuckload off of their specific Niche and offers that they have the point I'm attempting to make is very simple whether you're in the Inner Circle program or in the master internet Marketing Group you have

the ability obviously paying me money to ask me questions for what's going to be most appropriate for you to execute on okay when we run a challenge we use the hammer them strategy and just to be transparent I spent roughly $227,000 over this entire month and a half to achieve the desired frequency count of getting at least in short form content 15 to 20 total unique pieces of

content in front of the over 6,000 people that purchased this challenge in addition to that with the long form content I had a frequency of 11 for getting long form pieces of content just like what you're watching right now is an example in front of the people who purchased the challenge prior to them showing up in a call funnel do I have to spend nearly that amount on the hammer

them sequence no because it's a far smaller group of people so therefore there's a far smaller amount I need to spend to achieve my desired frequency okay there's not a static answer for Budget on this best practice the answer is spend whatever it takes to achieve the desired frequency if you're going to execute on a strategy that requires a frequency Target to see the op opal

result from it okay that's something very important to remember and consider okay so outside of the hammer them strategy we also had what we consider an education-based email sequence okay outside of that we have some Modern show rate best practices which for us we've talked about this in a few different videos now include due diligence best practices and some trust assets being

sent to people we have specific videos on a few of those things on our channel that we posted most recently be sure to go and check those out okay so to continue on our show rate sequence was very aggressive from the point of the confirmation page after the upsells we started the framing process creating excitement from both the main speaker and the handful of guest speakers that

we had let's break down the actual challenge itself so you can understand how to execute on this thing so in this case we did a 3-day challenge each day has a specific set of best practices in order to make the most money from this thing so the three-day challenge number one one day one we had pure content okay so it is very value dense amounts of information so value dense content it

was about four it ended up being close to 5ish hours of Total content there are strategic breaks worked in throughout the content uh we also had an MC so for all those who just I not know what I'm talking about at higher levels it creates a lot of authority to have somebody else that's doing like the host stuff so as an example soon as the challenge starts and people start

showing up this was a high production event there is a specific company that I believe is in Charlotte um I actually am not familiar with the name of the company to be clear but the uh the two girls are Barry and blue if you're unfamiliar um to be clear these two ladies do an exceptional job with the studio that they have set up for this and they did phenomenal on just creating

that very high production value environment they had those giant screens like you've probably seen this from people like Tony Robbins uh Dean graos has done it in environments like this I believe people across all different major levels of personal branding you've probably seen in environments like this um I think Russell Brunson has an example done an environments like this

and then our client that I'm giving you an example of here also did it within this same environment it has big screens behind them that can be changed to the slides of the presentation it can be changed to showing the zoom people sitting there watching the event uh again it's a very interchangeable very Dynamic immersive experience the content as it's streaming through Zoom is coming

through in exceptional quality it's also being recorded on cameras that are not streaming live that way it can be used later on for evergreen webinars or content or clipped for ads or whatever you want to use it for um and then there's a whole production team behind the scenes that's executing on this you know controlling lighting uh playing music you know to like get People Pumped

up as soon as they join in and in between breaks and like all this stuff and in particular they had an MC they had a host of the event in this particular case it was a guy uh you know this kind of guy is responsible for creating energy getting everything everybody hyped up getting everybody enthused um controlling the frame you know introducing the next speaker that

comes in and then transitions off to the speaker that uh presents next and just you start the process of uh dropping the dropping the value um usually every speaker would talk for about an hour so over the course of this four almost five hours um you had about four speakers in total on the first day and I want to be really clear when I say this obviously the event in most challenges is themed

around a particular outcome due to the fact it was a paid event and all yes the intention in whether it's paid or free is to upsell the out of people you have to keep in mind you are there to deliver a fuckload of value like you have to hook people in to actually saying like yes this was worth it and I'm enthused with the fact I just paid to be here you know so the content has

to be really good you have to genuinely teach people about whatever it is that the theme of The Challenge is centered around so in this particular case this client was teaching about buying businesses and this specific client did a phenomenal job over the toop with executing the value dense content being presented so did every other speaker that presented as well and

they all talked at length about buying businesses and giving people actionable insights okay things that they could go and do but just like here on YouTube like what I do with you right now is I sit here and Edge you I give you roughly 10% of what there is that I could tell you about and I keep the other 90% for my paid programs now as shocking as that might be to some of you who sit here and

say holy this guy's free content is really good and it is value dense and it helps me and there's very little filler information you'll still be pleased to know that when you transition to the point of actually transacting with us and getting into our education company product offers or eventually becoming a potential Hands-On client of ours or a Consulting deal of our marketing agency

you be highly impressed with what you get access to on the other side of that transaction your content has to blow the other people's paid stuff out of the water okay that's the key you sit here and watch this right now and are learning all of these extremely actionable insights meanwhile the people in my paid programs like my inner circle as an example where we do those twice a

month one-on-one calls 30 minutes each booked at your convenience you can message me in real time with things that you want me to review I typically get to it a couple hours after you message in sometimes the next morning depending on the day and the time that you message in you can message me in the group chat in real time you can ask other people questions in the group chat in real time

you can come to our quarterly inperson masterminds hosted in January April July and October right here in good old Miami Florida and in addition to that like I said you get the group chat full of rich people trying to get a hell of a lot richer and our weekly group calls hosted on Saturdays at 11:00 a.m. eastern standard time inside of those programs we talk at an even higher level about

these same things we go through our Sops we Leverage AI Jeremy to exploit these things in real time in addition to real Jeremy of course in order to make more money okay so again my point is the free stuff okay like what you're going to present in the challenge has to be value dense but you're still holding things back but they're also not really thinking to themselves this person's

holding back just like you right now you're like that's good you know there's stuff I can go do with this immediately you get what I'm saying there's still things you could do to get a result But ultimately when it comes down to me saying hey buy this it still makes sense to buy it because you're still going to get more value out of buying it right so in a paid challenge

or a free challenge that's a major key okay back to my points here so outside of value D content outside of the fact that it was about four to 5 hours a day for the first day in particular we also have the MC for a nice Authority Edge okay somebody that comes in and does all the filler stuff that you don't otherwise want to do that way the speakers maintain high levels of

authority okay last thing and this is very important to understand about day one it is all about getting people to show up for day two okay this is what's important to understand if you lose people on day one day two is where you do your pitch so day two is and we'll talk about this at length here in a moment for like what you successfully execute on day two but day two simply

put is where you're going to make your call to actions to actually start the process of making money off this whole thing okay so if you fail on day one if you do an awful job actually giving people a reason to show up for day two you're going to have a bad time you you have a much much lower probability to actually make money off this whole thing at the level that you probably want it

to be especially given all the time and effort it's going to take execute this kind of thing to actually make money off day two okay really important to consider all right so let's go into day two so day two is first of all really fun um I want to give a quick shout out to myON golden uh myON golden is arguably one of my favorite mentors I think I've ever had uh you could pay

myON upwards of like whatever he's charging currently for his uh he calls it million dooll day I think is the name of this specific offer that he has he has two different things in particular that I'm going to talk about briefly um the pream is the main thing that I'm going to sit here and talk to you about that I learned from my okay so first of all without giving away all myON sauce

because again learning it from myON directly is it's just so fun first of all my's an incredible person to learn from if you ever get the opportunity to do so I would I would definitely encourage that you do it but myON is one of U the smarter people that I've ever had the opportunity to learn from and he has such a unique approach and uh one of my favorite things about what the guy

does is this concept he has called pre-framed go into like value dense content you know get people excited and like continue to fulfill on the premise of the challenge but in almost all instances like what prevents people from purchasing things are like very specific mental blocks that have to be addressed prior to you actually making a call to action like as an example here in this

very video as I make call to actions to you to check out the links in the description for our paid offers there's something that's left unaddressed if you don't actually go and take action on it like as an example maybe you've been absolutely by other people that you've bought courses from or maybe just the fact that I live in Miami Florida makes you have some kind of Association

that I'm a piece of or a scammer or something due to the fact that Miami has somewhat of a reputation for people like that living here you know at the end of the day there's something typically left unaddressed right it's like I know you're going to get a fuckload of value out of our paid offers if you're the right person but if I can't successfully without a back and forth conversation

with you actually plant and address the right things in your mind to make you Confident come time that I make the call to action there's a much lower probability that you take action so the concept of pre-f framing that myON teaches is we want to successfully frame before we actually make our pitch that way by the time we make our pitch there's a much higher probability that

people are responsive to it it's not just about dropping the extremely value dense information and then just saying hey by the way if you want the last bit of what I didn't talk about go and buy my stuff like I said if the different mental objections are left unaddressed we will fail to convert a majority of the people there okay so in this particular case we ended up with about a

6.3% conversion of people purchasing that showed up okay so there's a few statistics in between the 70% show rate and the 6.3% quantity of people actually purchasing I'll talk more about that here shortly but I just want to mention that's arguably pretty good for a $10,000 product against like 5,000 is people or high 4,000 is people that actually showed up to this thing but a

lot of it came down to the pre- framing lessons that my help teach and talk about so I'll give you two examples in particular and then I'll leave it at that okay two of my favorite examples that I've actually executed myself you can go to my Instagram at Jeremy and you can look at a few of the examples if you scroll through my page enough you'll eventually see me on stage and I clipped

them and I posted them on my page so you can check them out so one of them in particular myON talks about opportunity cost so again this is straight from myON golden I executed it on stage and it was really fun to do so so I had a $100 bill a $50 bill a $20 bill a $10 bill and a $5 bill so I had five total United States dollar bills in front of me okay and I had each one of them in my hand

and I called up five random people from the audience at this specific event that I was was at and doing this with so I get five people on stage and I have them all stand behind me okay and I have a microphone and I start telling the story about taking advantage of what we call First mover's Advantage so in this particular case the offer that was going to be pitched at this event had a lot to

do with taking action on something that would be considered a risk and you'd be one of the first people doing it so one of the pre-framed had to be instilled prior to making the call to action to buy was that risks are worth taking when there's new opportunities because you typically get the most result compared to the people who later take action okay so long story short I get to the point

where I'm telling a story about a um it was a guy that I had lunch with and this guy told me this is an audacious claim that this guy had made he was like dude I was making upwards of like $160 million a week a week selling shares in companies before they had gone public and I was like excuse me like what you know and anyway the guy essentially reveals to me that you know he had this

company where he was selling shares in defense companies that ended up being like major publicly traded companies but before they had actually ever hit the public market he was essentially buying employees shares which the employees were happy to sell to him because they were able to liquidate their stocks they otherwise would would have been illiquid technically and he would then take those

shares on the private market and he would go and sell them to other people long story short this was one of the first guys who had ever done this you know he wasn't the first but he was one of the first and as a result of being one of the first he made a fuckload more money than the people who try to do it today as an example cuz there's a lot of different people that technically can do

that nowadays it's no longer like a first mover's Advantage one of the most classic examples of this reference would be like gold mining right like way back in the day here in the United States and in different parts of the world you know you had everybody that really settled into the Eastern United States and one of the main drivers for going west outside of just the difference in

environment you know it was a pretty big risk back in the day when you would move across the entire country it wasn't as easy as it is today obviously was Financial motive of course some of it was homesteading like as an example here in the United States we have a state called Montana there's a concept called homesteading which would give you the opportunity to just go claim x amount of

acres of land which could be literally tens of thousands of acres of land and as long as you made it productive which meant like farming or doing agricultural or potentially like logging or all kinds of different things um the land was yours you essentially got it free and clear but you had to make it productive another example would be the gold mining right just going across the entire

country to go and mine for gold for financial gain right and there's tons of different examples that you could use for industries that you might be aware of when you tell these stories right so I'm telling one about the guy who made 160 million a week selling shares in companies before they'd go public buying them from employees I then held up a $100 bill and I said what's interesting

about the first movers Advantage the people who take action first before anybody else is they make the most money the people who take action first they always make the most money and you essentially just sit there and repeat it a few times until one of the five people behind me actually had it click and and two of them in particular just come rushing up and they try to take the $100

out of your hand and you let one of them take it and then everybody in the audience gets it right and it starts sinking in for what the other four have to do next and you hold up the $50 bill next and you continue on with your story and you're like and listen you know the people who came to Montana at a later time to Homestead it's not like they made less it's not like they got that

much less land like hey maybe instead of the 100,000 acres of land maybe they only only had 5,000 acres of land you know and then you hold up the $50 bill the second lowest denomination and you say well I mean the person who technically moves second like they still do pretty good right but they don't make as much as the first person and one of the other four people just comes up and

snatches it from you and then you do it for the remaining three bills for the $20 bill the $10 bill and the $5 bill and the person you know who grabs the lowest Bill the $5 bill in this case they obviously kind of get laughed at by the entire audience and they kind of feel bad a little bit they don't like Rush up to you to take the money and they typically walk a little slow and

like I said they just feel embarrassed overall and then you point out to the crowd you say but you sitting in the crowd as you laugh at that guy who just only got $5 you know the person who technically moved last right sure he didn't make as much as the first guy who got a hundred he didn't even make as much as the second guy who got half as much as the first guy but you know who

got literally nothing here and you do a nice pause and you just look at everybody in the audience you the people who just sat here who just watched on the sidelines who didn't even have the will this to come up on stage and take a risk you laugh at the guy who only got $5 but how much did you make through all this you didn't make anything you only learned lessons they learned lessons and

they got paid and then everybody gets it right and you emphasize the power of first movers Advantage with a lesson like that myON has another one that's really really good and I call it Penny Vision I'm sure that he has a very similar name for it I highly doubt that people actually carry pennies nowadays but I always like to think that myON probably plants somebody in the audience

with a penny or maybe in a backup plan he just carries one around with him but same kind of concept I did this on stage as well you have a penny and a $100 bill and you'll tell the story of how sometimes you have to get people to tell you to move you know something that's blocking your vision preventing you from taking advantage of opportunity to then be willing to take advantage of

opportunity so my starts to tell this story right again it could be any manufactured story or something that's you know obviously real ideally that uh has happened in your life like I'll give you a great example for what I talked about on stage so again this is all posted on my Instagram at Jeremy with another specific clip of me doing this if you want to go check it out so I hold

up a penny in front of my eye okay and I hold up a $100 bill in front of me and I'm telling the story while I keep this in front of me okay and I start to tell the story where I'm like you know one of the worst things that happens in my education company is knowing that I could help somebody but them not knowing I could help them you know they have something that blocks them prevents them

from actually taking action with us and buy from us and it could be as simple as they've just had handy down beliefs you know handy down beliefs could act as the penny that prevents me from seeing what's right in front of me handy down beliefs could be you know I've always heard courses are just a scam or oh everybody who sells courses is just like the male equivalent of an only fans girl

you know or oh you know my buddy bought a course and he got scammed so you know I'm not buying that and uh although yeah I mean there are definitely a lot of people who sell awful courses and don't take their educ a companies seriously and are essentially literal pieces of who don't give a crap in any way re form about you and the results that you're going to generate that

doesn't negate the fact that there's real education companies out there that can help you and provide you a tremendous amount of value and actually help you achieve the results and outcomes that you want but at the same time you know if you let skepticism and just negative stories dictate and shape your entire worldview for how you live your life think about how many

opportunities you're going to miss because of that damn Penny Vision what does it sometimes take you know in order to get somebody to take action well in my world with my education company in most instances one of the very first things that I technically have to do before I can actually help the person with all the Tactical stuff before I can teach them a single strategy that

relates to their business is I typically have to do something that helps them mentally first remove some kind of Roadblock AKA I have to have another person tell me to remove the penny before I can see what's right in front of me as a big opportunity somebody out there tell me to remove that Penny and you start getting the entire crowd move the penny move the penny and you know

you'll remove the penny and then you'll be like oh and then there'll be a $100 bill right in front of you and again it emphasizes this lesson that myON talks about with these pre-framed or even relatively themed for what the challenge is centered around you're just handling these mental objections that are extremely probable to be prevalent and you want to cater

the pre-framed lessons that you provide to specific things that are extremely probable to be blocking your audience from taking action on what you're going to talk to people about you see and it it's it's wide in terms of all the examples that there are that myON talks about and that was only two of I don't know probably 50 that I learned from the guy and it's so fun to be clear

and obviously it's after you understand the concept of it easy to start to you know work through them yourself and start to consider what you could do to help uh your audience you know with pre-framed material so a lot of what is day two starts off especially for the first half of the day with pre-f framing okay so this is essentially the the first half of the day for day two and

then right before lunch so before you actually take a lunch break or if you start it right after after lunch as an example this would essentially be like the first half of the day is executed with what I just articulated in them before you give them their next break that's where you do the pitch okay and that's where you officially drop hey like I have an offer for you you know

drop in the chat if it's okay if I make the offer to you guys and with the pitch itself for this particular client we had a $10,000 offer and what we did is a $22,000 deposit so we pitched it for the full $110,000 of course and we didn't hold anything back and we pitched it as though we were going to do a directed check out but the real intention is to obviously get people on the phone with

salespeople but we didn't want to actually do the call to action for hey like book a call we wanted to tell people so what you're going to do is you're going to literally right now spend $2,000 on a deposit to hold your slot okay and then as soon as you do that you're going to be prompted with an opportunity to book a call with one of our onboarding Specialists and listen

you're going to get all your questions answered and you are both going to be able to iron out if this is actually good for you or not okay and then from there you're going to actually have them purchase you're going to drop a link for them to successfully transact on the $2,000 and then they're going to book a call from there and then obviously those are just straight up layup deals

so the other main thing that happened here is we negotiated down the sales teams Commission because it's not like they're actually closing people you know they're just essentially literally collecting the other $8,000 in this exam they don't need to get paid what they normally get paid which in this case was about 20% altogether we negotiated them down to 10% which

honestly probably more than fair relative to what they could have gotten paid otherwise we likely to be extremely transparent could have just said we're going to sell the $10,000 right then and there we decided it was a much higher probability people were going to transact with the $2,000 and then just have the sales people collect the other 8,000 which ended up being the case uh

in total like IID mentioned we got about 33.4 million off of this specific event and that does not include by the way the revenue that was from the front end where we were doing the ticket sales that is exclusive to what we had gotten here so it was phenomenal in terms of the uh total transactions I also want to disclose we had a $35,000 option as well for a more serious business person that

didn't want to learn how to buy businesses but wanted to learn how to scale their business through Acquisitions so there was also a few people out of this 6.3% that converted on a $35,000 offer same exact process uh pitched everybody right after pitching the 10K $2,000 deposit and then they'd collect the other $33,000 on a sales call to follow so this was extremely

effective okay after you do the pitch you you just take a break so after you officially get back from lunch the whole second half of the day is just straight up content and again it should be value dense uh you want to get back to the theme okay and just kind of get back to normal okay normal meaning whatever the theme of the event is that's what you officially want to start talking about

from that point forward uh you do not want to negate that okay the whole second half of the day should just be back to Value dense content okay now coming into day three day three is a little different as well is also a lot of like kind of objection handling uh Q&amp;A there's a lot of stuff that happens on day three but again it's kind of like it's it's structured but it's not as

structured as day one and day two day three has a lot of freedom like you want to start the day with with just kind of doing an open Q&amp;A helping answer a lot of people's questions and then if you're good enough to be able to do this by the way what you end up have occurring on day three is like kind like a free form set of presentations that are executed based on some of the most common

objections that have held people back or some of the most common questions that are coming up at the beginning of this day um day three is generally also a little shorter it's usually a half day so it's not as long and uh yeah it's really fun um to be clear there's a tremendous amount of additional detail I can share on the challenge model and I would love to do so but to be clear I'm

not going to do it here on YouTube I think I've already given you a tremendous amount of value I would encourage you joining into my inner circle offer you have to be making at least 100K a month in order to just qualify for that to be clear if you're not making more than $100,000 a month then you would be more appropriately fit for my master interet marketing program
