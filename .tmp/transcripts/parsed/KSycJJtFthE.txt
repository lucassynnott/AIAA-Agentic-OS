What does it take to hit million-dollar months? &gt;&gt; So, number one, it obviously all starts with a We had a guy, he was at a $50,000 price point. Spent a little over 25K and he did a little over 2 million in the first 30 days, but he had a $50,000 offer. That was like under 40 buyers.

&gt;&gt; How long can it take to get to million &gt;&gt; It's hard to even put a time frame to it because of how wide the range truly is. In the most extreme case that's happened a literal singular time was a month which again I would never project that expectation onto somebody.

&gt;&gt; What characteristics will prevent founders from ever hitting million dollar months? &gt;&gt; I don't I don't think Welcome back to another episode of Founders Playbook. Today is a good one.

I flew literally to the other side of the planet to get a conversation today with these men. Today's guest has helped over 41 businesses hit million-dollar months. He's arguably one of the best paid advertisers of all time. He's the marketing guru behind some of your favorite personal brands and influencers. He's the founder and CEO of Megalodon Marketing, an 8 figureure

entrepreneur himself. and he's here to share with us today how to scale to million dollar months which let me clarify for him your chances of hitting $10 million a year according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics is.1%.

That means that you have 99.9% of not hitting 10 million per year let alone 12 million per year. But my hope is that today at the end of this conversation, you might be slightly better equipped and increase your chances of hitting million-doll months. Please welcome the legend, the incredible Mr. Jeremy Haynes.

&gt;&gt; Very good, very good earnings disclaimer there. Yeah. And necessary, too. You know, a lot of people think they got it and uh they just don't. You know, people have a wide range of variables that hold them back from ever hitting million-dollar months. And uh I'm happy to go through all those here today and and the top lessons we've seen time and time again

that do help people get there. Where do you want to start? &gt;&gt; Let's just cut straight to the noise. &gt;&gt; What does it take to hit million-dollar &gt;&gt; Yeah. I like to say it takes three things. So number one, it obviously all starts with a great offer. We've seen time and time again like every key statistic that actually matters. I'll give you a great example. cost per call,

cost per webinar registrant, cost per purchase if you're running a low ticket to high ticket offer, uh the subsequent statistics like show rates, uh close rates, you know, second call booking rates if you're running two call closes, like every single individual statistic is influenced by the offer more so than anything else. So when we see somebody that has something that just hits super

hard in that current market and and I'll give you a good example like literally right now while we sit here and talk AI is currently the hot topic. If you go on Google Trends and you compare most of what you think is big against literally just the letters AI you'll see that whatever you currently think is big as a Google trend just gets squashed to like the very bottom of the graph

comparatively. And that level of interest and that level of excitement in a specific niche, as you could imagine, creates a lot of excitement for people when it comes to offers that could potentially help them with things. So, think about, as an example, like opt-in rates or purchase rates, conversion rates, close rates, show rates, etc. for anything AI related. It has in most

instances, give or take who you are, um, a very very strong set of stats. So, it it typically all starts there. That alone can be a huge proponent of something that can get you there quicker. Um, in addition to offer, kind of like a subsequent point of offer is pricing. So, I'll give you a great example. If you had a $100,000 offer, you only need 10 people to buy in order

to hit a million a month. We had a guy, he was at a $50,000 price point. We spent a little over 25K in ad spend in the first 30 days. By the way, it's a hyper unrealistic set of expectations I'm about to set. This happened one time in my decade plus career as an advertiser. just to disclose. He spent a little over 25K. He did a little over 2 million in the first 30 days, but he had

a $50,000 offer. So, as impressive as that sounds, that was like under 40 buyers, right? And when you look at just how math works, obviously, if I sold something that was $100 by comparison, and I wanted to hit a million a month, it becomes that much harder, right? In comparison, if I go bigger on the actual price of whatever it is that I'm selling, just makes it that much easier.

Package that with a great offer, makes a world of a difference. Does that make sense so far? &gt;&gt; Yes, it does. &gt;&gt; Yeah. In addition to that, there's two other points which are the sales and marketing side of things and then the actual staff that are a part of the the the deal itself. So, from a sales and marketing perspective, I believe that

these two are conjoined. I don't separate them out. I don't do the sales versus marketing beef that most people do. I think they're directly correlated to one another. The success of the sales team is largely due to the success of the marketing team to bring in a good financially qualified well-framed lead, which can be done through content first ad strategies or back-end selling

systems or a combination of both. Um, there's a lot of marketers out there who are very negligent to that influence that they have over the sales team's performance. Instead, they just point their finger when a sales team does bad.

&gt;&gt; It's the easiest thing to do, right? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah, it is. It is very easy to blame others. And then, uh, vice versa, you obviously have to have great sales people, too. If you have a super shitty sales team, you're going to have a bad time regardless of how qualified and well-framed those leads are. Everything is um just it all runs together. You know, it

all runs together. Finally, a players in the organization. Without a player a part of the team, you typically run slower. Everything becomes much more political. The bureaucracy within the organization grind you down to a pace where it's very easy for competitors to come in and outspend you. and therefore out earn you. Uh minimize your overall impact within that niche and industry,

reduce your revenue. There's um a lot that I can sit here and attribute towards just a player talent and organizations that can make or break deals. I'll give you a great example. A lot of times people come to us, they're around like a couple hundredk or sometimes they even already hit a million a month. They're looking to hit the next mill. And you look at their

team and the justifications that they make, aka the beliefs that they project onto the business's potential are the limitation. Like I can come in and look at the marketing. I can come in and look at the statistics that the sales team's currently running. I can look at the offer and you don't necessarily always find something that's wrong. You know, sometimes it's just the narrative side

of things which is typically spun up by people, right? Like you don't look at a set of statistics and have it tell you a specific narrative in most instances. You can conclude to a different narrative than what I can about that and then you share that amongst each other and it becomes like a collective belief that alone can limit potential or can vice versa with a great set of players

in the organization. A players specifically drive revenue through the roof by direct comparison. So those are the big three offer, sales and marketing and then having an A players in the team that that in my opinion can make or break a million dollar a month deal straight away. Those three thing that you mention are definitely key and the first one I love which is something that

you talk consistently which is attaching yourself to the grand narrative AI being one of those. We have a client that actually when we first started with him, he was all around e-commerce, Amazon specifically, which is a trend that as you know has been dropping down consistently over the last decade, right? And &gt;&gt; it it it was pushing uphill trying

to basically get him to to make great money out of the content strategy that we were putting together for him. And at some point, we switch to Bitcoin because he's a heavy investor himself. And he's like, "Guys, I don't want to do it.

e-commerce is a nine figure entrepreneur. He doesn't care as much for the money in itself. And then we just switch everything to SMSF Bitcoin which is essentially like the equivalent to the 401k I think as you guys call it.

&gt;&gt; And dude, the growth has been insane just because the grand narrative right now with Bitcoin is insane. Right. &gt;&gt; Oh, it makes a lot of sense. you know, to your point, I mean, we have a few guys that we help inside of the Amazon space that that are in our inner circle program, and they've had a lot more success after they join in and like adapt what they're currently doing or,

you know, attach what they're currently doing to something else that has a higher level of interest. There was a uh there's a guy also in the inner circle. I I he might be coming this weekend, by the way, to the mastermind. His name is Brooke. And you know, Brooke joined into the mastermind, to be fair, already doing more than 2 million a month. So, he was already very well off, but I

can't stress it enough. He joined in teaching e-commerce but he teaches e-commerce and paired it with AI. So like everything that he teaches and talks about is how to leverage AI to make getting into ecom easier. And as a result of that it's like you can take something else arguably like as an example Amazon buy by itself all on its lonesome. Not that appealing anymore but

same exact logic like you attach it to some other grand narrative naturally it's going to perform a lot better. You don't always have to take what you do and completely pivot out of it when you're looking like he doesn't have to completely go away from Amazon. He could arguably still make that work, but he has to attach it to something give a about.

&gt;&gt; Yeah, we had that same thing. Another inner circle member, his um I won't say his name because honestly I think this one would be a little more obvious for people that might be watching. I don't want to air out his business like that.

Long story short, this guy was teaching copywriting and he was around initially at I think his peaks like 600k a month organically and he had seen that get cut in half as AI grew. Because think about it, one of the first real use cases that a lot of people saw evidence for with these LLM that came out was copyrighted.

&gt;&gt; And this guy in particular as a teacher of that, he was selling against using AI. He was like, "No, no, no. You need to learn the skill. like you need to know how to do it. Um, this makes so much more sense to have in your head rather than using as a tool that's going, you know, I told him, he sat down at lunch with me one day and I said, I think this is such a

mistake for you to sell against it. You know, I think this is going to be a new all-time high for your revenue if instead of selling against it, you sell with it and attach what you're doing.

like show people how much easier it is now to be able to have AI work with you and your copywriting organization. Just sell with it rather than against it. And he went home, didn't take him long at all, which which a huge characteristics of success by the way.

He got right back up to 600K within about two months of that time frame. So again, imagine your revenue just getting chopped in half from selling against a trend. And then you flip it and you sell into a trend and your revenue just goes right back to where it was. I last month he had a record month to be clear. That was several months after that lunch that I had with him. I'm not sure the exact

amount of time that had passed, but he had he had gone just shy $800,000 within that next month. &gt;&gt; So &gt;&gt; it was great. But yeah, never sell against a trend. I'll tell you that right now. That'll absolutely you.

&gt;&gt; Go go go towards the trend, right? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; In terms of time frames to hit million dollar months. Yeah. What on your experience, what's the average? Let's say a business already is at a 100k months. How long does it take on average with all those three things that you mentioned previously, if you get them right, how long can it take to get to

million dollar months? Sometimes I've seen people as I mentioned in the in the most extreme case that's happened a literal singular time that I've witnessed was a month which which again I would never project that expectation onto somebody. In most instances it can take a good few years give or take the individual skill set and those other three variables like

where your offer currently sits. Sometimes it's just market centric like you're just in a tiny niche with not a lot of potential. You don't always have any probability. I mean, remember like just like you opened up this specific show with in this case. I mean, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, they run those numbers against every single business that exists and has existed for

how many of them have reported hitting a revenue number greater than 10 mil. And that number at 10 million was 0.1%. Dude, it's like when you use Purll and you have a 99.99% probability of getting rid of those germs and and whatever is on your hands, it's like technically you have a slightly better chance than Purel because it's not 0.01, it's 0.1. But

still, I mean, those are pretty up odds. So anyway, for the ones that do hit it, some some of them do it in like under a year. Um, some of them it takes a good like couple years of just grinding through lessons. The issue is the speed in which you solve problems more so than almost anything else is what dictates the speed in which you grow. So most organizations they really

undermine that specific characteristic and they tolerate problems far longer than they should. Even the ones to be fair that have like a high level of aggression towards attacking problems.

They don't always overcome it fast because look, you don't know what you don't know. So, at the end of the day, you can try everything that you're aware of to overcome a specific plateau, but dude, I mean, you might stay stuck there for a fair bit of time. And depending again, to be clear, on your speed and willingness to like spend some money on figuring out that problem or bringing in

new people to help solve the problem or investing into the awareness that you might lack to help solve the problem and unlock new thinking dictates how long you stay stuck. I've had guys that I I remember one of our longtime inner circle members, his name was Josh. And dude, he when he joined in, he was at 300K a month for just shy of three years. It's like 2 years and like eight

months, I think he told me when he joined in he was stuck at 300k a month. Why? Why was that guy stuck at that range for that long of a period of time? It's just tolerance of a specific set of issues or a main issue that was preventing the additional revenue from rolling in. And if you don't have really strong reasons to hit million-dollar months and like really get your business

up to a big level, I mean, why are you going to give a to solve the problem faster than you otherwise could? You know, you're just going to kind of sit there and be comfortable and complacent with where you're at. He lived in some like random area of the United States, like call it like a tier 2 or tier three city, somewhere that, you know, just didn't really bring your

potential out. you know, he didn't have like a platoon of people around him that tried to like push him and keep him accountable to grow. And and listen to this, when he first joined into that group, he got to 500K a month within a few months because I was immediately up his ass trying to just give him some solid reasons that were believable to him for why he needed the additional

money. And then two, really, and this is one of the most important parts, just making him intolerable of sitting there at that level and trying to push up to that next level. Now, to be fair, that guy never cracked million-dollar months.

You know, sometimes on your on your way there, like I just articulated, you hit these plateaus and not only will you be tolerable of whatever holds you back, you'll enjoy it. You know, cuz your life, let's be honest, improves exponentially between even 300k a month and 500k a month. You could start flying around on little private jets. You might not be

taking the heavy jets like the Gulf Streams and the Bombardi and Falcons and all that, but you know, you're going to be able to fly like on turbo props and light jets and maybe even a midsize here and there, but the um the quality of life that you have, I mean, you're not going to anywhere you could think of and really looking at the price. Uh you can buy most people's dream watches any

given month that you want. Uh depending on your expenses, of course, but you know, this guy's expenses were fairly low in his business. I mean, you could invest a tremendous amount as well. you can invest a pretty life-changing amount of money at a pretty consistent pace at 500k a month and again set yourself up for a really good retirement to where you're easily able to look at your life

at and even to be fair even less than 500k a month and just say what the do I really need the additional money for. So a lot of people unknowingly to themselves like they'll hit these plateaus as they continue to climb the mountain and rather than turning it into a game of expanding on your potential and you know bringing that next version out of yourself and

applying importance to the additional money you do bring in. You just kind of get stuck and you're happy to be there too you know. So it really depends on the individual. you know, there's there's a lot of things that can hold you back. But anyway, long story short, due to those variables, it's really hard to define a time frame. You know, it's really hard to say like, oh yeah, on

average it takes X because at the end of the day, I only have the sample size of the industries that we've actively worked in to consider, too. So, I'm not sure. I mean, I really don't know. I don't I don't think there is an answer to be fair. And if there is, I sure as hell don't know.

You often break down the characteristics of people that will be in the best position to hit million-dollar months, right? I want to flip it now because you you also were breaking down some of those.

founders from ever hitting million-dollar months? &gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean, pretty much do the exact opposite, right? So, characteristics of people who are generally impoverished, number one, they're not resourceful at all. One one of the number one characteristics of success is just being resourceful, being able to take whatever is currently available to you and making

the best of it in order to grow to that next level of opportunity. Speed. So, as I mentioned, if you have willingness to solve problems extremely quickly, you typically have a lot of earning potential in most instances dependent upon the problems that you're solving because you still need to solve revenue-driven problems. People who stay stuck and like don't ever have a

chance to hit million- dollars. They do busy work. um they never take high high impact revenue driven actions. You know, they'll prioritize just a bunch of that doesn't actually make money. Uh you know, feel good about that type of work, too. There's nothing worse than priding yourself on non-revenue driven actions that you solve or take. I think that is um you know, when you're

in a for-profit business, obviously you're there to make a fuckload of money, right? And when you lose that mission and you just like do work to like feel like you got some done, you know, to get that like satisfaction and that dopamine rush of completing cycles.

&gt;&gt; You better make sure they're revenue driven cycles anyway. Go super slow. That'll always you up. Work with a bunch of B and C players. Yeah, just work with a bunch of idiots that like don't care about revenue and don't prioritize revenue and don't really care about making a fuckload more money. Work with people who intentionally try to slow things down. Those are the worst

types of people to have in your organization. And have a willingness, like I said, to just have all the tolerance in the world for these kinds of things. Like, don't have anybody that pushes you to a greater level. Um, justify your current position financially, like act like you have enough money is a great way to stay stuck. I had a guy, sometimes I tell

people, you know, as pretentious as this might sound, I have people that join into things like my inner circle program where I get like one-on-one talks with them. And I had a guy just joined in.

It's my first call with the guy and he's making about 140k a month. He's barely scraping the minimum to even qualify to be in there. And he tells me when we're talking about like why he needs to make some more money. I was like, you know, so what are the reasons like why why do you need more money? Why do you want to hit million dollar months? And he's telling me some reasons. And then he

gets to the point where he he slipped in a random belief where he was like, you know, I just recently uh hit my highest month, my highest income month I've ever had. And I don't know, I just felt like, you know, money didn't really do anything extra for me. You know, it kind of made me question if uh, you know, I needed more money or not. And then he

kind of like glazed over it and like was talking about some other random stuff and I went right back to that and I attacked the out of it. And I was like, "Dude, how in the world do you expect to make more money if you don't have good proper to yourself, highly believable reasons to to get the additional cash?" And, you know, obviously bringing him to that

self-awareness made him kind of rectify that belief and change it on the spot and, you know, come up with new reasons. Like I talked to him, he's 26 years old and I was talking to him about retirement. I was like, "Have you ever even done math and looked at a compound interest calculator of how much you need to invest per month?" And I asked him, I was like, "When do you realistically no

longer want to work for active income?" And he was like, "I don't know, probably sometime in my 40s." And I was like, "All right, let's say you give yourself 20 years. Let's say you wanted to to no longer just just whether you want to work or not at 47. Let's say 20 full years from now, you give yourself a couple months before you turn 27, you give yourself a full 20 years. If you

looked at, we have in the United States this website called investor.gov and there's a compound interest calculator on it that the SEC provides to, you know, investors and people who just want to make sense of how compounded returns work. Um, we have a collection of 500 different companies that interchange give or take their performance called the S&amp;P 500. It's an index fund. And if

you look up the most recent 20 years as an example of the S&amp;P's 500's average annual return, it's about 10%. Right? And if you looked at investing about 10K a month, so if you invest 10K right now and you invested 10K a month for that full 20 years, every month for 20 years in a row, and you and you got an annualized return of 10% and you don't even factor in inflation into this,

okay? You just look at what your portfolio would turn into. 10K a month for 20 years in a row that you invest. If you only gave yourself 20 years, comes out to like a little less than $7 million. It's like six million and some change that you're realistically going to get. And then from there, you don't go live from that point. Like the average person in the United States,

we've actually had a pretty unfortunate trend recently where we die earlier than than the rest of the countries around the world. But, you know, I digress. The uh the point I'm trying to make is like let's say let's say he lived into his 80s. Okay? So, he needed like another full 40 years to be able to live off that money. There's a golden rule inside of finance where it's called the 4%

rule. So, as an example, let's say that he only had that like six something million dollars in his in his late 40s at 47 to be able to live off of the rest of his life. Well, the golden rule that's been handed down by every person who talks seriously about money for ages that I'm aware of is this 4% rule. So, that would mean every year he sells 4% of his portfolio. You then have

long-term capital gains tax here in the United States. Currently sits at about 20%. So that 4% off of that six something million dollars minus 20% of the capital gains taxes every time he sells that 4% leaves him with like maybe thousands of dollars a month. And I asked him, I was like, "How much money do you spend right now each month?" And he was like maybe like 15 to 20k a

month. And I was like, "Dude, you wouldn't even be able to currently afford what you like how you live right now. Like is this is this how you want to live when you're like in your 40s after working for 20 years? like is this is this really all you want your life to be worth? And to be fair to some people who have just a smaller life that they're willing to live like the answer

is yeah. It's like no I'd be I'd be fine. You know, I'm happy to live that way. To others who would as a preference I was like dude are you going to have kids? Like how do you think that looks?

Like do you think you're going to need more money for them between then and now? Uh, do you think that when you're in your 40s and your kids are like just about to maybe have grandchildren or like are just getting out of school realistically like like do you want to go visit them? Do you want to fly economy when you fly? Like do you want to stay in like a shitty hotel or like a

random guest room or on a couch that they might have for you in their apartment at the time? Do do you want to like do anything greater than that? Like do you want to do drive like Toyotas and Hyundai's the rest of your life? You know, do you do you have anything grander than that in terms of ambitions?

And you know very quickly he started to realize he was like yeah I mean my god and I told him I was like you know to be fair if you gave yourself a full another 10 years. So if you invested from 27 until 57 that same 10k a month it turns into about 19.9 million if I remember the math correctly. And long story short it's like that's a substantial difference but that's a full another

decade of investing 10k a month and working which I told him I was like look maybe you'll have willingness to do that maybe you won't. Maybe you'll be out of your earning window. Maybe you won't even have the potential to to earn the way that you currently earn. And you're going to have to adapt a completely different skill set at that later age.

You know, have you ever seen somebody who's older how they behave when they have to adapt to a completely new skill set? It's like there's generally a very very low willingness from those types of people to make serious change to their careers. And I was like, "Dude, you ever heard of like pro athletes that go broke after they've made tens of millions of dollars in their career? It's because

they don't think about their earning window. They don't maximize the potential that they have during this unknown to them period of time where they're probable to make their most money. And during that window, they don't invest a fuckload of it. So come time when they're out of their earning window, it's like they're you know, they

rugged themselves. So, I was telling him, I was like, as an example of, you know, why that belief that he articulated was going to absolutely him. I was like, dude, like, think about that. Like, no, you you'd need so much more money. I was like, "Go into that that compound interest calculator and just throw in some bigger numbers than 10k a month and look at the 4% rule and

look at the amount of time and, you know, determine like how serious you actually need to take just investing alone, you know, and I gave him another example. I had talked to him about recently my uh I I won't say specifically who I don't I don't want to embarrass them, you know, I don't know if they'll feel embarrassed about me talking about it, but a very close

family member to me had come to me recently and they're they're older and they were like, I want to retire um and I want to learn how to trade and you know through through the inner circle.

Do you know Sean? Have you ever met Seawn? No, &gt;&gt; I don't think so. Anyway, we have a long he I think he was literally the first person who ever joined in. His name is Sean. And he had talked to me a long time ago about this this uh it was called Prop Firms. And at first when he talked about it, I thought he was full of He was saying he's making like

400k a month off these uh off these prop firms. And long story short, like just to summarize what it is, you you pay to like show you're a good trader and then they let you trade like fake money technically, but they'll pay you real money on what you earn because of the fact that they're paying you with what all the people who fail pay them. So, like when you fail these accounts, they

have willingness to give you that money because apparently it's like a really low statistic of how many people actually make it to the point where they're going to actually have to pay like people real money. Well, anyway, I was one of those very few people that got paid real money. I got to a point I had between it was April of 2023 and October of 2024, I had invested into

these accounts to like prove I'm a good trader and like failing them hundreds of time. I literally had like I think like 2,000 of these like accounts from how many times I'd failed 20 at a time. So it might sound like a lot, but I actually failed upwards of like 60 maybe like low7s. And anyway, I digress.

Point I'm trying to make is I spent about 80 something,000 and I made just over a million dollar and I got paid the million. It was like a million88,500 I think is what the uh the 1099 that they gave me was. Anyway, the the family member had come to me because they were aware that I had like done a little trading and I was I was telling them I was like, "Yeah, it

really doesn't take that long, you know, wasn't taking me that much time in a day to like do it." And I I'd felt like I'd kind of cracked like a good strategy with these like liquidity strategies that I was using. And anyway, family member comes to me and they were like, "I want to learn how to do that. Like I want to learn how to trade." So I was like, "Yeah, dude. Fly out to Miami.

Like I'll I'll teach you. I'll show you how over a few days and like send you back home. See if you do good with it." Dude, when that person showed up, I had thought they wanted to trade just to make some extra cash, right? Well, well, the real reason that they wanted to learn how to trade was because they were in a financially position in their 60s. In America, we have this this

uh system that we invest into our whole life called the social security system. And it's a it's honestly a very terrible financial return, but like regardless, it's meant to take care of people who make it to like 65 plus. And I think you get a little I honestly I've never even studied how much social security pays you because I've heard my whole life that it's going to run out by the time

that I'm actually 60 and like eligible for it. And I'm under the impression it's like barely any money anyway. But it's like the net, you know? It's like the last financial net that you have before you're just homeless and old. So anyway, he didn't even know how little money it was. It was like he was going to get like 2,000 bucks a month USD in in social security.

And he needed about $3,000ish dollars a month to be able to like just live the way he was currently living. And he wasn't living in a big city. He's living in a very small city here in America in a in like a random state that's like not expensive. And this guy in particular, like he takes care of one of my key family members and he needed a back surgery. So, he had to retire because he

needed a back surgery. Okay. And he just couldn't really work anymore. And if he retired, he was going to be financially because he hadn't invested enough in that 401k thing you were talking about. He only invested about 500k in his lifetime into that 401k. And if you did the 4% rule on 500k, &gt;&gt; I think it's like I think it's only like $1,000 something dollars. I think it's

like $1,600 a month or something like that. So between the social security and between the 4% rule on his 500k 401k balance, he would have been cooked, dude. He would have been So I just want to be fair and saying just so nobody calls me an since I'm rich, I did put the guy on payroll, too. I gave I gave him 5k a month. And again, the point I was trying to make

with this guy I was talking to in the inner circle, I was like, "Look, dude, I did teach this guy how to trade and he's actually done quite well with it to be fair." And let me disclose, I do not teach people how to trade, okay?

I'm not in any way, shape, or form trying to plug trading. I actually think it's it's very unrealistic for most people to make any money trading and it's really stressful, too. But I he is doing good with it to be fair.

Completely separate point though. I tell the guy that I'm on this call within the inner circle, I was like, "Dude, think about that." Like outside of the money that you need to do the math on to retire, think about like if a family member one day that you care about comes to you and says, "I need a surgery that's going to cost money." He takes care of a key family member of mine and

because they would both have have like been down and out because the other one's disabled. One family member is disabled and the one would be disabled after a surgery for about 6 weeks. I called a at-home nurse company in their area.

$20,000 for 18 hours a day for 6 weeks is how much it cost to get a nurse at their home for 18 hours a day to take care of those two while he's disabled for six weeks recovering from his surgery. 5K a month in payroll just to make sure the guy's comfortable taking care of my family member and taking care of himself. And I told I told the guy I'm talking to in the inner circle, I'm

like, "Bro, think about that." It's like, do you think I like financially modeled that out in my life and thought that that was going to be a reason I need to make more money? Or like, dude, like think about this. Like, the guy's 60 now. I'm paying him 5k a month. Let's say he lives another 20 years. Okay?

Like, I'm right now sitting to you, I'm in my early 30s while I'm sitting here talking. I'm 31. It's like, dog, if he lives another 20, let's say even 30 years, that's into my 50s and 60s when I'm now paying that guy 5k a month. It's like, think about that. Imagine me having to go to him one day and be like, "Hey, sorry, dude. Like, not making enough anymore to give you 5 G's a

month." Like, you know, get It's like, dude, that's not how it works. I'll probably have to increase the amount I pay that guy through time due to inflation and how that works out with eroding our buying power. But the emphasis I'm trying to make clear is like most people think it's like you justify making more money from just materialistic Like you go buy like

watches and like cars and like you know, sick pen houses like the things I have. It's like, don't get me wrong, those are cool as too. And you definitely should buy those because they're great. But at the same time, it's like the more serious stuff, like how long are you going to have to work for active income? What's your life going to look like after your earning

window is cooked and you don't have the willingness to adapt to a modern skill set that's in demand? What are you going to do when your family comes to you and is like, "Hey man, I need some help." And it's like a serious situation where you're going to feel like knowing you could have earned more and you could have helped them. and you just say, "Sorry, I'm not in the

position to be able to take care of you." I had um random person, my my fiance called me and told me this one day when she was taking my I have three little wiener dogs. And uh dude, by the way, they'll be at the house when you're there. You'll get to meet them. And anyway, she was taking one of them to the vet. And as soon as she walked into the vet, there's this girl in there just

balling her eyes out. and her and the receptionist lady and a vet that were there were like talking and apparently this lady didn't have a couple grand to be able to like save her dog's life. Like they they needed to resuscitate the dog and I don't remember what other the specific thing they needed to do, but like it was like a life-saving thing that cost a couple

G's. Long story short, this girl didn't have the money and she was sitting there like literally if she couldn't be able to afford that, which she couldn't, her dog was going to die. like, "Dude, thank God my fiance walked in in that exact moment." And she goes, "Don't worry, like we'll take care of it." And it's like, "Dude, in that exact moment, I saved some random dog I never even got

to see or meet from some helpless lady who hadn't factored that kind of situation into her life." You know, financial security goes well beyond just stuff. the stuff is cool and in my in my opinion I also think important but at the same time it's like you know people have these beliefs like oh I made a little bit more money and you know I didn't really like feel any additional

impact it's like no dude you just don't understand the reasons in which you need a fuckload more money beyond what you had just made in your you know record month making barely a 140 grand you know so anyway very important you understand like the wrong people What they do is they omit the power of money in their life and how it controls every single decision that they make. It

determines literally everything. Where they live determines the speed of their internet. Every single device and thing in their home is determined by money. The choices they get to make or not make are determined by money. How you travel. Like dude, I saw you had flexed on your story there. You got to fly business class from Australia over here to Miami. It's like, you know, to

the average viewer watching this, do the math on that for what that cost. You know, it's not that crazy in terms of cost, but it's like, I'll tell you what, imagine flying that amount of time in economy back there. I bet that would have been a a wildly different experience for you, huh?

&gt;&gt; Yeah, dude. It it felt like a life hack, you know, and you know, and you know why I appreciate it way more probably than most people that get to do that? First of all, I was the youngest person in there aside from two babies that were on board. I was the youngest person in there. So that felt pretty good.

&gt;&gt; That's two babies. &gt;&gt; Yeah, there was two babies, but other than that, I was the the third youngest person in the So that felt pretty awesome, right? And the second part of it is that on my on my own experience, I I come from nothing. I come from Venezuela, you know, a third world country, average income family. We I was always told we're poor, we can't

afford things. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, I've been working on my own money beliefs for almost a decade at this point. And now being able to do that, man, it felt freaking awesome.

I'll tell you that. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And like listen, listen to this, right? The the wrong people, I think, stay attached to the wrong identities for too long, too, right? Like now imagine like you were just saying third world country family your entire life projected onto you that you're financially and don't get the power to make choices

relative to the money that you don't have. It's like you've chosen through time whether you're aware of it or not. Some people do this intentionally and some people do this subconsciously.

They will adapt their identity relative to the next level that they want to bring out of themselves and a new set of circumstances that they want to actualize. You have to intentionally create an identity that is beneficial to what types of results you want to pull out of yourself and achieve in life.

Most people they when you talk about like the wrong people who don't ever stand a chance to hit million-dollar months, it's like just like that guy. if he didn't have the ability to overcome that belief that he brought up of like, oh yeah, I made a little extra money and like had my biggest month and I didn't really feel like, you know, it was that great. It's

like, well, no, that's not going to serve you at all. There's there's no benefit to whatever the version of you is saying that. And and a lot of people don't realize it's like your Grand Theft Auto character is how I always frame it to make it easy for people to understand. Like, you can choose every single characteristic that you currently think

is your identity. And every single one of them that's that's not beneficial to your growth, you can strip away and you could change and you could adapt and you could be literally anything and and everything that you could picture in your mind. Uh there's people out there who pretend to be dogs, you know, you seen those crazy videos and it's like they'll do things like wear collars

and eat dog food and some it's like well they're they're choosing to play life like a dog, you know? Some people choose to play life like a person who hits million-dollar months. And and again, the characteristics of that types of individual is wildly different from the guy or girl that only hits, you know, a couple hundred grand a month or tens of thousands a month or or, you

know, just a regular person working a job, you know? So, the wrong people, they don't they don't adapt to that mindset and worldview. Instead, they believe they are who they are and they try to carry that forward with them all the way up. They they try to have a set of characteristics that they believe are their identity and as a result of that attachment, they

stay stuck and plateau and have tremendous friction. It's like driving. It's like driving with a e bra pulled. You know what I mean? It just doesn't work. Slows the car down. Makes it wildly inefficient. the right characteristics adapted to oneself is is truly a determining characteristic of somebody who does make a fuckload of money. You have to have that, you know.

So anyway, yeah, moral of the story, you got you got to have a strong set of reasons that are highly believable to you. That's the thing. It's like a different set of reasons for every individual, right? Like do you do you like cars at all?

&gt;&gt; I do. What what cars to you would you consider like a dream car? Something that if you could It's got What? What do you got there? Is that a G Wagon? Dude, think about that. Like what is that? A G63.

&gt;&gt; It's not even like a Mansuri one or a Brabus one. It's just a G63. &gt;&gt; That's like a 200,000 maybe at most $300,000 car. As a dream car, it's like let's say you needed 20 to 30% down on that. And just to acquire the car, it might cost you like let's say $50,000 down.

&gt;&gt; Okay, that's a measly $50,000 and a couple grand a month to be able to acquire something as your phone background. &gt;&gt; You know, it's like that &gt;&gt; step of actualizing something that you want to have exist and and think about this, having money be what prevents the thing being materialized.

To me, I interpret that as I'm not bigger than stuff. You're telling me like I can't go buy a watch. Like I'm not I'm not able to materialize a watch, you know? I'm not able to materialize like a fleet of cars, you know? I can't I can't I'm not bigger than a house, you know? Like, dude, I'm a living being, you know? Like, you're telling me I'm

smaller than like a bag that my girl wants, you know? It's like to me that's a deeply unsettling mindset to fall victim to this worldview that I'm smaller than stuff, you know, and and as a result to that as an example of a belief, I will I'll never let stuff I I I love going out there and getting those things that to respect to the stuff are sometimes

bigger than where I currently am as a person. And as a result to that, I I just deploy this like relentless drive, you know, from that worldview of like I'm not bigger than a watch, you know, are you me? And it's it's such a deeply unsettling feeling to think otherwise. But think about how many people are smaller than stuff, you know, one car,

you know, one watch, one just sum of money. And the best part is is there's so much money that exists. Most people never go look at the M2 money chart, which here in the United States represents the total amount of dollars that exist that are in circulation. And and here's the even crazier part. If you if you look up Yeah, you you can ask Chad GBT, you can ask Google, how many

dollars exist physically and how many dollars exist digitally. And that's just dollars, right? And then you go look at every other currency that exists. Euro, what what do you guys even use over there in Australia? What do we call &gt;&gt; Australian dollar? So you guys have the Australian dollar. How many of those are in circulation?

&gt;&gt; No idea. &gt;&gt; Yeah. It's like, dude, you don't even know how much money there is on the screen. &gt;&gt; It's like I when I looked up the amount of dollars, just US dollars that existed and I took the amount that I wanted to capture and divided it by the amount of dollars that existed. The fraction of 1% that it was was like point fuckloads of

zeros. and then a one. And again, I just thought to myself, I'm like, are you telling me I can't capture that small of a percentage of dollars? You know, there there there's so many of them.

&gt;&gt; It's too much of them, right? &gt;&gt; Think about it. It's like you all you really got to do is just provide enough of a valuable service or product, something that helps the earth and the people who are buying it. because it's people who have your money, you know, so you got to have something that helps people. And you're telling me you can't capture a measly 12 mil a year, you

know, a million of these dollars in a month when there's so many dollars. It just doesn't make any sense. So from that perspective, right, that's an example of like the right types of beliefs that you start to build. Beliefs and data are what drive behavior. Okay?

So the wrong people, they have all these like up beliefs and up world views and they feed themselves data that inhibits growth rather than easily encourages growth. You understand? So it's like usually the biggest issue when you look at like the wrong people, they're in their own way in all kinds of ways, right? And they have to first unlearn

and like replace. I always Have you ever seen Indiana Jones? &gt;&gt; You remember that movie? One of the first ones I watched when I was younger. I think it was the literal first one I ever watched. There was this scene where where he was in uh like a cave, I think is what it was. And there was this gold trophy. You remember that? Like gold whatever it was. I think it was

like a monkey or something. Like a gold monkey. and he had a bag of sand and he had to fill the sand up and try to like weigh it out to be the exact weight of that like gold little monument thing and he had to swap it out. And if he didn't swap it out with the exact same weight, that giant rock came rolling down the hill and was going to crush him. And he he did actually fail to swap it out with

the right weight. And the big rock did come tumbling down, but thankfully didn't kill him. Anyway, a lot of people may have something when we talk about attachment to a specific worldview or belief system that's not actively benefiting you, they they fail to swap it out with something that's equally as like believable, right? They can hear certain things that

people say and they might think of it as like logically comprehensible to them or sometimes like something that maybe even emotionally resonates. But beliefs like beliefs cause wars, you know, beliefs drive people to quite literally defend life and death. You know, and if you think about it like that, the the the the things that you need to believe in to go make a fuckload

more money have to have such like deeprooted importance to you in order for you to go out there and actually capture that revenue you're after. Otherwise, you're just going to kind of sputter out along the way and end up one of those people that just gets comfortable at a certain revenue milestone and, you know, ends up one of those folks that just hits a couple

hundred grand instead of the big million-dollar months. &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? One thing as well that I understood at some point that we're all like computers and in many cases you have the wrong programming or you have kind of like a virus that you need to get rid of and you you have to do whatever you can &gt;&gt; to make sure that you integrate that new

version of you that you're trying to bring into reality. That's why I always have this and I'm constantly looking. I'm an 8 figureure founder and investor. Vibes Creative makes one million USD per month. I'm the luckiest man alive. I always repeat that to myself. And when things guess what? And somehow I keep getting lucky.

&gt;&gt; I work extremely hard and I do everything to put myself in the best position to win. And every time something happens in my favor, I keep reminding everyone I'm I'm the luckiest man alive. And I remind my team, I pass all these beliefs on on people around me. I I'm being very intentional now curating a team of eight players like you often describe. and making sure that

everyone understands at Vibes Creative where we operate, we operate at a world-class level and we're the luckiest people alive. Anytime something good happens, I always tell them remember who's the luckiest people alive and they they now say it and initially it it took time, you know, to get them to fully integrate it and now they they do it on their own as well.

&gt;&gt; Yeah. Because sometimes it's those like you got to see it to believe it situations. And to your point, like when you initially say that, you just sound like a hippie woo woo spiritual person that's doing the manifestation thing, which not everybody believes in.

I'll tell you a good example of a better way to reinforce that belief for some people that might be on the fence. So, when you have a belief that you think could benefit you, okay? Like that one right there, which you've seen benefit in, and you're wondering like how I can get, in your case, some staff to integrate that same belief system. And you don't want to wait in order for them

to see it to then inherit it as a belief. There's a great book as an example. You got to seek data. There's a great book. It's the 38. It's it's called 38 letters from John D.

Rockefeller. &gt;&gt; I've been reading it. &gt;&gt; Okay. That book is so good. And you know, for everybody who doesn't know, which I'd be shocked if you don't know, John D. Rockefeller is one of the richest people in America's history. He ran a company called Standard Oil, which one was which was was one of the very few companies here in the United States

that had to get broken up under our monopoly laws from how serious that guy was running train on the entire oil industry at the time. And anyway, John D. Rockefeller wrote 38 individual letters to his son. And one of those letters was on creating luck. And there were certain things in that book that I read where I was thinking to myself as I read it, this is profound, that one of

the richest people in America's history way back in the early 1900s and late 1800s believed the exact same things that I currently have as beliefs. It validated my worldviews that much further. And one of those specific letters, I'm sure you read it if you're reading the book, was on luck. and he had talked about the importance of creating our own luck and he had

essentially just in that specific letter to his son reinforced the fact that I believe through a story about Abraham Lincoln if I'm not mistaken and his persistence to uh Abraham Lincoln was one of our presidents here in the United States and he'd tell he told the story about how uh how much failure he had experienced and then eventually he had become the president of the United

States and he had just talked about this relentless pursuit of action and you know resultoriented action at at that eventually creates her own luck. But to be clear, the point I'm attempting to make is is like I deeply believe in listening to people who are in this case, you know, one of the richest people in the world, you know, let alone the United States that earned so much in

a period of time that I view it way harder to have gotten richer. You know, I know I wasn't alive back then, obviously, but it still feels like it would have been a whole lot harder to get rich back then comparatively to what it's like to get rich today with AI and the internet and all the opportunities that that's provided to us. But the point is, he

talked about the power of luck and how to create it. And data can be what reinforces a belief. You see what I mean? Generally, when somebody proposes something as something for you to believe, you don't just immediately inherit it unless there's something that you see. Like, how many times have you heard somebody talk about seeing aliens, right? Or like how many times have you

seen even even here in the US, they they've put out propaganda recently from like our United States military about different UFOs and like visuals that are like always some up distorted video about a spacecraft, you know? And there's always stories from some random crazy looking older guy or girl that's like, "Yeah, I worked in this like facility for the government. Like, I

reverse engineered these spacecrafts and there was a there was an alien inside of it." It's like, how little does anybody actually believe in that It's like the data to be fair of those stories from people who have, you know, actually apparently worked in these facilities that that persuades some people, right? But like why hasn't it persuaded you and I?

&gt;&gt; Because I I haven't seen it myself. &gt;&gt; Well, that that's what it takes for some people. It takes seeing it in order to actually believe it. But it's also important to note there may be a piece of data out there that you and I eventually see that might not be seeing it. That's just a new random piece of data that you and I haven't thought through yet that when it comes across

our senses, we interpret it and we're like, I'm a believer now. You know, and that's the thing. And it's like when you're trying to inherit a belief that is beneficial to you, it's important to seek data until you genuinely believe it. Right? Because there's a lot of people out there who have heard that same concept of like, oh, you know, manifest a great life by like repeating

things and like putting it as your background and like they just think it's hippie you know? But at the same time, there's enough people out there clearly who have watched like The Secret or like certain movies like that that are like that's enough for me, you know, that's that's my belief system.

But my point is is like, dude, that's that's a beneficial worldview to have to believe that you're a lucky individual because how the brain works. You know, we're going to have an opportunity to see things that will inspire and make luck real for us. But if we don't have that worldview, we're not going to see those things. Yeah. You familiar with that lesson from Tony Robbins where he

says, "Look around the room and see anything that's the color red." And then he's like, "All right, now tell me everything that was green." And then the person he asked is like, "Well, I don't know. You told me to look for everything red." And he's like, "All right, now look around the room and tell me everything you see that's green." And you you only see what you're trying to

see. Yes. &gt;&gt; You know, you only hear what you're trying to hear. You reinforce whatever beliefs you have. So, moral of the story is, if you know that there's a specific set of beliefs as somebody who's way richer than you or just getting way better results than you are, regardless of what you think about them, I potentially want to consider like what

data am I lacking that would that would help me inherit that belief system so I can go out there and get a bigger result. That's a big part of million-dollar months. I'll give you an example, right? So, the the 12 mil a year, that's all million-dollar months are. You know, here in the United States, the the the US, we have a lot of different little government entities.

And one of these specific entities, they label any business that makes less than $40 million a year as a small business. So, it's like, think about that as an example of a piece of data. When I when I think to myself, so you're telling me million-dollar months are hard, but yet my government's sitting here telling me, "Yeah, I mean, don't get me wrong, from a perspective of the US

Bureau of Labor Statistics saying that 0.1% of businesses hit it." That's a earnings disclaimer, you know? That's that's me attempting to tell you like I'm not sitting here telling you're going to make buku bucks watching this video. It's a small chance and that chance is that ch. I mean, that's that's the stats right there for you. That's real. That's true. But at

the same time, what's real and true is apparently a small business makes less than $40 million a year. You're telling me I'm going to be a small business forever, right? I was at dinner with a guy the other day doing 42 mil a year. He had an info business doing 42 mil a year. Sales trainer. He was talking about getting to 100 mil. He only has 2.5x to go to get to 100 mil.

Think about that. He's no longer a small business. There's all kinds of examples that you can seek, whether it be like the John D. Rockefeller example where you can see a guy who's one of the richest people on earth when he was alive still to date one of the richest people on earth even though he's dead his money still lives longer than most people point I'm trying to make is like

him validating beliefs right different government statistics can sometimes validate the beliefs sometimes you look at somebody who you just think is a idiot that makes more money than you and you're like dude if that guy can do it you're telling me I can't do it. You know, there's all kinds of data points out there that you need to inherit. And I can't stress it enough.

The wrong people, they never try to do that, man. The people who stay stuck, they they don't they don't they don't have that system, you know? The people who do adapt and solve problems quickly and earn more and maximize who they are and have like these dynamic characteristics and identities. Those people, they all think like that, dude.

They all have that worldview. &gt;&gt; Now, some of the things that you just covered as well were well, you you should be making more money because you're going to have these unexpected expenses as well. Right now let's let's tie that with what are the actual expenses to foresee and profit when you are looking to hit million dollar months in terms of you know sales team ad spend

marketing uh deliver &gt;&gt; that's a lot of them right there &gt;&gt; like what what's the average that you see in terms of percentages to &gt;&gt; it really depends on the model you know like a lot of the info product businesses as an example they can see upwards of like 50 to 70% margins give or take how lean they run. Um, you know, different product based businesses like

we have a guy, he sells hyperbaric chambers. He hit a million a month. His margins are more in like the 20-ish percent range like maybe out good a good month 30%. Um, typically you obviously have cost of ad spend in most instances.

Sometimes you don't like sometimes people get that call that I was on right before we came over here, that's a new inner circle member. He's in the trading niche, but he has a sophisticated demographic he sells to. He's not one of those guys that's like teaching like call outs and and like base level trading courses. He does 2.2 mil a month all organically off of YouTube. He's got

about 250,000 plus subscribers and there's not any paid advertising cost that he's incurring. Although to be fair, he's going to start. So he's going to start incurring that expense. It's mainly sales teams. You got commissions.

You've got ad spend and any other marketing cost. Typically have a good chunk of payroll when you're hitting million- dollar months. Again, depends on how lean you're running and and what your model is. If you have physical products, because we do have a lot of people that watch us as well that are high ticket product businesses and they obviously have like physical goods or

cost of goods sold, their cars. Um, from there, taxes are a huge one, you know, like I spend $115,000 a month currently in taxes, and that's projected to only go up, you know? So, it's like I uh just a just a little there's a little cash cow here for the good old government. Anyway, um I can't stress enough like there's always some random that you could factor in on

top of that, give or take what you do. So, arguably, give or take the business, some insurance cost, but you know, you're just getting kind of into smaller like nickel and dime expenses, softwares, you know, couple hundred, couple thousand bucks a month, give or take the business and what they're paying. But, um I mean, I I can't necessarily think that there's much

bigger ones than that besides lifestyle cost. I mean, most of these guys are obviously siphoning off a big chunk towards just living well. So factor that out of the equation if you want to take it against your margin, but arguably that's more of, you know, not technically taking off your gross margin unless you're expensing it against the business. You know what I mean?

&gt;&gt; You obviously across a decade that you've been doing this, you have experimented dramatically with many different types of pieces of content, right? There's a trend right now with long form content specifically. I'm curious to hear from you. What are the best uses you have seen with podcast content in order to hit million-doll &gt;&gt; Dude, I'll give you a good one. We we

took an hour and 55minut podcast, posted it directly to Facebook, distributed it towards people who don't know us. It on a on a watching a full hour and 55 minute video, 100% video viewer that was retargetable. You could also retarget 95% video viewers. It was costing a $155 to get somebody to watch that full hour and 55 minutes. So, long long story short, you know, for like a a couple

dollars or like under $2 to get somebody What what did I say it cost? Did I to be clear? I think it was like a$120. I might have said $155. Excuse me. I was thinking of the length of the podcast.

So, again, hour and 55 minute podcast. It was like I think like a $1.1720 to get somebody to watch the full hour of it. we could retarget up to 95% of it and then we would retarget those people specifically with direct response ads and we do a lot of content first ad strategies. So moral of the story is we'll take content both on the front end and distribute it to people who don't

know us and we'll retarget thresholds way less than just the 100% threshold. But the point I'm attempting to make is is like sub $2 to get somebody to watch that long of a podcast. I'll spend that any day dozens and hundreds thousands of times over in a day if I can. Um, especially towards people have no idea who I am and I'll retarget people who watch well below that

threshold too. Point being, you can post up to 60-minute videos now direct to Instagram as an example currently. Who knows if they they keep that or not. Point I'm attempting to make is very simple. These podcasts are very beneficial for both front end and they're very beneficial for the back end. So, one of the strategies that we've uh recently been trying to push

and create some propaganda around the hammer them strategy. So, we'll take people who do something like book a call and prior to the call, we'll distribute both short form and long form content in front of that individual and it's a small pocket audience. Depending on the scale that you operate at, you might have to supplement it and make it a little larger. uh people who operate at

scale like they'll typically see as an example let's say you get 150 calls every 72 hours right and your average call time from the time they book to the time the call happens is that 3-day window that 72-hour window we'll take as much long form content as we can ideally about a dozen to two dozen different videos and we'll also take a bunch of short form content ideally like

30 to 50 videos minimum and we put what's called a frequency target on these on these specific people in that window so for short form as an example We typically try to see a frequency of anywhere from about 15 to 20. We want an ideal amount of content to reach these people in that tight time frame. And we'll do that with long form content, too. As a result of this, people

typically show up at a higher rate. They're more excited. They're further along in the sales process. They're more probable to do pay in fulls and just buy period. And sales cycles are also reduced because typically organically like you you'll you'll notice the more people consume your content, especially longer content, the more probable they are to purchase. The downside of the

organic content sales cycle is is that it's long drawn out and generally unknown and unmeasurable. It's hard to tell without asking. And even even when you ask, you don't necessarily get an honest answer, right? Because people aren't necessarily aware of like, oh yeah, dude, I've watched your content for x amount of months or x amount of weeks. You do generally hear it's a long

drawn out duration of time. What we try to do with content ad strategies, whether it's content first ad strategies where we lead with content or strategies like the hammer them strategy where it's more of a they took a key action via direct response and now we're trying to hammer the out of them. We are leveraging content just like podcast as an example to consistently get people to

show up with higher buying intent. Okay? and we are replicating the organic sales cycle but in a substantially shorter duration of time. That's the whole intention of content ad strategies.

Can't stress enough how critical podcasts are specifically in that process. A lot of people really struggle to sit down and just make content by themselves. They have a hard time just looking at a camera and just yapping for however long they can they can sit there and yap. Now, me personally, I'm a D1 yapper. you know, I am I'm a class with just sitting down yapping, whether it's

me or talking to somebody else. However, it's a lot easier. Like, as an example, there's probably even some things that we've talked about here today that I would not have conversed about if I was just sitting down talking to a camera individually. Um, thus the value of podcast. So, podcast can also drive a strong authority bias rel relative to the niche and what podcast it is. But

here's the cool part. Like you have to have a popping podcast that you're on to be able to leverage that content inside of your sales process. I think it's just one of those things. It's kind of like I always say sales is uh the equivalent of breathing in business. As soon as you stop breathing, you die. A lot of people don't put any time and attention onto sales and thus they make very little

money. I don't know why people view I if you mentioned if you remember at the beginning of the video I mentioned the cohesion of sales and marketing. I don't view them as separate. Like I believe marketing in terms of how people interpret it is just one to many sales right I believe it's the modern mechanism to drive attention instead of doing the outdated like cold calls or

doortodoor like all the all the higheffort onetoone super cold mechanisms of sales marketing especially content is just a modern highly efficient sales mechanism that's a one to many sales process and as a result of viewing doing it that way, you'd get on as many podcasts as you could possibly get on. And not only would you do that, you would leverage

those podcasts in your marketing via content ad strategies to help further increase the odds that when people do have that sales conversation, they actually close. So, I think they're really important &gt;&gt; and ultimately is just getting those people to be better framed, right?

Leading to the sales process and ultimately just feeling like they they already sold, right? a lay down deal as you will say and and in fact I I bought from your program and the reason I bought was because of long form content which I will say that you essentially have a podcast. It's just on on a different format but what you're doing is just talking in a long form content

in front of camera with a great microphone. So I I call that podcasting solo style episodes or authority style episodes. So I'm curious to hear as well from you because ultimately that's what sold me on you was just consuming a a bunch of content like enough for me to be like well and I can't keep consuming I need to take some action here right but I'm curious to hear as well because

you you have made a clear big move in the last 12 months in going all in into long form content right so what has been the result of you doing podcast style content &gt;&gt; yeah Great question. So, first of all, my original intention was I had always made content mainly for my education company and towards what I would consider like a lesser financially

qualified individual. I didn't really try to to go out there and vocalize what I simply put, I didn't believe that my clients would actually watch like my content, you know? So, I never actually intentionally made over my decadel long career content for my ideal client. What we had always done to get our ideal client was video pitches. And we did this concept called valuedriven

follow-up as well. So we would just make a video. We'd send it to a person via DMs and email. We would follow up religiously once a week for the people that we really wanted to work with. And we would just consistently put our expertise on display through like SOPs and unlisted videos and um testimonials and just trying to get them onto calls.

And that's how we got damn near every big client that we've got. The uh the process was simple. like and as a result of that I didn't I just didn't believe that they were like on social media watching these these videos. So last July it's literally been one year I had just kind of run a test. I was like you know what it. Like I'm going to make content for my ideal client. I'm

going to talk about hitting million-dollar months. I'm going to talk about the lessons of hitting million- dollar months from all these people that we've helped. And I'm just going to see as a test if this can actually drive some clients into the business.

Let's let's let's run a test. Let's see how it goes. So, really simple for me. Takes about 2 hours a week. Every Sunday, I sit down from generally 2:00 to 4:00 in the afternoon and I'll film two videos. And the videos are always super easy to come up with topics for because all I do is reflect on what's going on in my client's businesses, both good and bad. And I sit down on YouTube

and I just yap about it and I talk about the lessons. And I generally hold back a decent amount of information, but I give out more than enough information for it to be valuable and for people to get results with it. I think that's one of the most important parts is it's like resultoriented communication. I'm trying to help people be able to take an action with what I

talk about, make some money with it ideally, and be able to play with house money when they actually go to hire me or buy some stuff from me. Now, this is actually a very interesting result that we produced. Kind of shocking to be honest with you. Instead of getting my ideal client from all of these videos that I produced, the shocking part was I had gotten far more very highlevel

education company buyers instead. So, I had gotten over the entire last year a handful of like actual ideal clients as a result of putting out this content, which relative to what we charge people to be fair, made it very well worth it just considering it was 2 hours a week.

So, doing it 52 weeks now in a row is 104 hours just for simple math. I'm sure there's probably maybe a dozen or so hours on top of that for an occasional session that took three hours instead of just the even two. But yeah, dollar value per hour-wise, it's been a phenomenal return just to consistently, you know, sit down and do this. I think it's so fun. It's also gotten a profound

network effect, which I I could argue is cooler. I've gotten so many people that have, you know, reached out to me and told me about the impact that just this free content has had on him. And the types of people that watch it, to my shock, were again, it proved my belief system wrong. They were the the right types of people. And there were so many more people than I ever thought that

gave a about this set of lessons that I just consistently hand down. That was the most shocking part. time and time again, every video I get more people that continue to subscribe to the channel and like the network effect grows. Um, it's it's really fun to think more so than anything else like just just yesterday actually I had this reflection. One of

these guys that I became aware of when I very first got into entrepreneurship, his name was Steve, you know, rest in peace to Steve. He had died on Monday. And Steve was a guy. He had written a book.

He had made a a good amount of content in his life. And I had I had connected with Steve a handful of times throughout my career. He was quite a helpful guy. And I thought to myself, I was like, you know, Steve's legacy is in his content now, and it's in what he's documented.

And he's taken these lessons and like contributed it to this just collective knowledge base of like YouTube and everywhere else that he's hosted it. And I thought that was so cool. You know, like when people talk about legacy and leaving an impact, we're like, dude, think about this. Like the John D.

Rockefeller book we were talking about. I I bet with a lot of money that John D. Rockefeller would have filmed content and sat down and like I I really do believe that because it's hard to describe like I'm not trying to virtue signal in any way, shape, or form and and sit here and say like I don't do it for money. I absolutely do do it for money with with like the routine, you

know, and I love doing it for money. I love money so much. But but again like from a legacy view like dude you and I a 100 plus years later are reading letters that John D. Rockefeller wrote his son.

You know, what are people going to do with these videos, you know, that go they're like they're timeless videos, you know what I mean? I'm not teaching lessons that are just for here and now.

There's things in there that I'm teaching that I like genuinely think people 20, 30, you know, who know, maybe even 100 years from now might find value in. And I think that part's really cool.

I also think again when I talk about network effect, the people I've gotten to meet, like it is profound. The people that have bought from me and have not bought from me that are already at million-dollar months looking to tack on the next million a month, doing a couple hundred grand a month, looking to get to a million a month that I've just gotten to meet, have conversations with, get to

know. Uh I don't know what people place as a value on network but to me it is a it is a hard hard sell to sit here and try to justify that that's not hyper valuable in itself cuz how hard is it to just go out there in the world and just randomly meet people who make a fuckload of money and are willing to share those types of lessons. Dude, I get people that when

they meet me, they feel like they already know me and so we skip past the part of like this um you know, like the little like small talk like get to know each other stuff. You just like you already know what I'm about. You know, you already have gotten to know me. You already got like a general perspective of my personality if you watched a few of my long form videos.

And as a result, dude, the network effect is so profound. I've had so many more conversations over the last year about things that I love to talk about, which is really just money and make a fuckload more money and all the cool stuff that money does. And that would never happen if I didn't make a fuckload of content and commit to that routine and that schedule. So, it's

helped me get richer. It's helped me get a whole bunch of other people way richer, which obviously directly correlates to a level of rich that I can get to. It's added tremendous value to my network. I've I've known and become aware of so many more people I never would have gotten the opportunity to meet and connect with. And like again, you get that immediate like good value

connection from people because they watch your channel. And then lastly, you get that effect that truly I never really thought I cared about. like you do get like a legacy component out of it, you know, where if for some godforsaken reason I just died, I'd be like I I feel very satisfied to a degree with what I was able to leave behind in a very like well doumented way that just

like John D. Rockefeller's letters, dude, like really think about that. After you read that book, it just makes you think like this was a real genuine dude who's just super rich and very competitive and very aggressive about making a bunch of money. I I truly believe he would be so happy like genuinely happy to know that you and I sitting here right now over a hundred

year 100 years later are getting value from what he wrote to his son. Dude, that's so cool. You know, I I don't mean legacy in some weird way. Like I just think that's so cool, you know, that that you could have that effect from documented information. You get what I'm saying? I love that &gt;&gt; you based on everything we have covered now.

Yeah. And you work with industry leaders like Cody Sanchez, Tai Lopez, and many others &gt;&gt; that use podcast and long form content right now to pass well over a million dollar months. So based on that, do you believe that business owners, founders that are not using podcasting or long long form style content are leaving money on the table?

&gt;&gt; Oh, for sure. Yeah. It's like the wor the businesses that have the highest friction right now are not leveraging content whether it be short form, long form, but long form especially long form content is where like listen, I think through the COVID era when Tik Tok was really popping and short form content went on the rise and became the dominant preferred

consumable. I think that eroded the amount of value that people were getting from content as a result of being of it being so short and the pendulum swung back to long form content and people having a preference to consume it because they realized that there's a lot more meaning and value from things that are, you know, historically perceived as like long and

drawn out during that short form preferential era. It's not like short form isn't still hitting. Short form still hits. It's great for discovery.

And arguably at the end of the day, whether it be YouTube where shorts exist or Tik Tok or Instagram, wherever else you you're posting short form nowadays, the bias is clear. Like short form is good for discovery. long long form is incredible for nurturing buying intent and that that key like relationship development that's necessary to actually convert people. You know, typically the

people who struggle the most are the people who don't do any type of long form content. The the people who have a hard time, simply put, are the ones who are biasing exclusively towards short form or even worse just not making content at all.

This is uh this or that segment. So, you just choose one or the other. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; Tea or coffee? &gt;&gt; Oh, I don't drink coffee at all. I just do tea.

&gt;&gt; Sushi or steak? &gt;&gt; I eat steak way more than I eat sushi, but sushi is pretty good. &gt;&gt; Expert or jack of all trades? I think you should be good at many things, but you can commit to many things over a long duration of time and still be an expert at a lot of stuff. So, I guess ultimately expert, but you know, if

you're going to be a jack of all trades, at least commit to everything and be great at it. &gt;&gt; Product or service business? &gt;&gt; When you're first getting started, service businesses are much easier and have a lot less friction. And as you scale, I also think service businesses become a little more complex. But at the same time, you know, product businesses,

they have a lot less margin in most instances. So, I don't know. I guess your own preference. I like service businesses. &gt;&gt; CEO or founder.

&gt;&gt; I never I do the I I don't understand why the word founder is like a popular word. I I I mean, I understand the difference, right? Like you can be a founder and staff a CEO, but I always identify as a CEO.

&gt;&gt; CEO or investor? &gt;&gt; Yeah, great question. that one in particular, there's that uh that Robert Kiyosaki quadrant from Rich Dad Poor Dad. I think everybody eventually becomes an investor, but you can do both at the same time. Arguably, you should do both at the same time, you know. You I I know a lot of people make a fuckload of money from small businesses and then

they plow that money from the businesses into investing and generally they still do both, you know, but you inevitably you should ultimately become an investor when you age and no longer want to work for active income. So, I guess it depends on how old you are.

&gt;&gt; Instagram or Tik Tok? &gt;&gt; I'm an Instagram guy, but to be fair, Tik Tok's pretty cool, you know? I I I scroll Tik Tok more than I do on Instagram because I I find funnier stuff on Tik Tok. Like, Tik Tok's a good like entertainment platform for me.

Instagram's cool for uh what I call conditioning. Like, I I've conditioned my feed on Instagram to be the things that I want to see for like, you know, all the rich person stuff I like. I don't know. They're kind of neck and neck. You got to pick one.

&gt;&gt; I would say Instagram. I'd say Instagram. If I had &gt;&gt; Instagram or YouTube? &gt;&gt; I'd go YouTube. &gt;&gt; YouTube or X?

&gt;&gt; It's tough. I go YouTube. &gt;&gt; YouTube or LinkedIn? &gt;&gt; LinkedIn's a hell hole. I think that it's all spam. I think that LinkedIn is dead internet theory. You could nuke LinkedIn off the face of the earth and I think we'd actually be in a better place. I I'm obviously gonna bias towards YouTube.

&gt;&gt; Photos or videos? &gt;&gt; Videos. &gt;&gt; Short form or long form video content? &gt;&gt; Long form. &gt;&gt; Newsletters or podcasting?

&gt;&gt; Podcasts. &gt;&gt; My boy. Organic or paid marketing? &gt;&gt; Big paid marketing guy. But but shout out to the people doing a lot organically, too. They both technically work, but if I had to pick, I'd pick paid. 1 million followers with low conversions or 1K raving fans.

&gt;&gt; 1K raving fans for sure. &gt;&gt; Building a talent or hiring a talent? &gt;&gt; You can't do both. I mean, it depends on where you at financially, but if you can hire A players, then I'd hire them all day. Easier to hire than build them.

&gt;&gt; A talent at a high price stack or multiple cheap C talent? &gt;&gt; Hey, A players at a high price. &gt;&gt; Property investing or shares? I dude, I invest so much more into equities than I do into property. So, I'm definitely gonna say shares.

&gt;&gt; Shares or crypto? &gt;&gt; Shares for sure. &gt;&gt; Shares of Bitcoin. &gt;&gt; I'm still going to go shares. You know, controversial, but I'm going to go shares.

&gt;&gt; Shares or buying businesses? &gt;&gt; I mean, shares. Yeah, I'm still going to say shares. &gt;&gt; Building a business or buying a business? Depends on where you're at financially. Most people, me, I'd build a business. I'd build a business over buying. But again, if you're like super rich or if you're in a good position of leverage, you can buy a

business and have it play out better. But build a business. &gt;&gt; Passion six figure business or stressful eight figureure business. &gt;&gt; How much you netting in the eight figureure business?

&gt;&gt; Not going to answer. I'm just going to let you choose one. I don't think you have to be stressed to make a fuckload of money and I think you can reduce stress. So, I'm going to go with the eight figureure business. I have more money to be able to reduce the stress.

&gt;&gt; The most important question, sales or marketing? &gt;&gt; Well, if I had to bias towards one or the other, I I think they're both, but I'm going to say marketing.

&gt;&gt; Now, Jeremy, specific questions. &gt;&gt; Rolex or PC? &gt;&gt; I don't have a PC. I have I have more Ries than I have PEX. So, I'm I guess I'm going to have to say Rolley, but I mean I don't know. That's tough. I uh I have I have two Richard Mills. I have a bunch of APs. And then there's a guy here in Miami. He said Rolexes are great for

filling the watch box, you know. And I thought that was hilarious. But I I guess I'm going to have to say Rolex just based on what I own. &gt;&gt; Rolex or AP?

&gt;&gt; AP for sure. &gt;&gt; AP or Richard Mill? &gt;&gt; Richard Mill. &gt;&gt; Ferrari or Lambo? &gt;&gt; I can't fit in a Lambo. The windshield's angled too low. And yeah, I've had three Ferrari. So, Ferrari.

&gt;&gt; Ferrari or Porsche. &gt;&gt; Now, I sold my Ferraris and I currently have two Porsches. So, I'm going to say Porsche. &gt;&gt; Porsche or McLaren?

&gt;&gt; Oh, man. It's tough call. They're They're so different. But I'll tell you, there's no car I've loved greater than that 750S. So, I'm going to say the McLaren. But the Pors Porsche is such a good car to be fair. They're there.

That's that's a tough choice. After making millions of dollars, what's the most painful lesson you have learned growing an 8 figureure business? Unless money has meaning, it's tough to sacrifice everything that it takes to make a fuckload of money until you give it meaning.

time and time again, you'll look at what you do, the level of stress you endure, and you'll ask yourself occasionally, is it worth it? And then you'll have all kinds of moments where you realize is way more than worth it. But there are some painful things along the way that you endure, but those painful things arguably make you who you are. And

that's, in my opinion, well worth the character development. But man, some of the challenges you face as a business person are some of the most painful and high stress things that you will ever experience besides physical pain to be fair. But um yeah, I would just say the journey of entrepreneurship can be a can be a drag, you know, but at the same time, a majority of it is

awesome. The highs and lows. What's the biggest difference between making seven and eight figures? &gt;&gt; Options and choices. You have so much more that you can do. Everything goes faster, too. The speed in which you can materialize life and solutions and the next thing is so much greater at 8 figures comparatively to seven figures.

It's so cool. There's such a profound difference, dude. In terms of something tactical, what would you say is the biggest tactic that someone can implement to go from seven figures to &gt;&gt; Potentially some of those first three things that we talked about, either better offers, higher prices, that next channel, that next strategy that you're currently leaving on the table. There's

a lot of things that you could arguably do in order to get there. But moral of the story is it's it's typically what you're not doing that's holding back your revenue more so than what it is that you're doing now.

What are the three most powerful questions that a CEO can ask himself that will help him crack million-dollar &gt;&gt; Who do I need to hire that's not a part of the team? You could also technically ask like, "Do I have the right people in order to get there?" For that same type of question, just rephrase differently.

Um, the math question is is one of my favorites. Like, have you just done the math on what it takes in terms of total customers? uh the math of like reverse engineering funnels that you currently have to see how much you need to spend and how much how much you need to how many people you need to put through it in order to get it to work. That's a big part of it. Just like math related

questions specific to your current conversion mechanisms. And then um an amplification question, something along the lines of um how could I amplify what's already working? How could I repeat a successful action at a greater level than what I'm currently executing it now? Those things typically have profound effect for me every time I ask them.

&gt;&gt; If you're gone tomorrow, all your YouTube videos, podcasts, long form content, everything gets taken away from you. What are the three insights that you will leave behind for your younger self to be able to hit eight figures faster?

get other people richer for you to get richer. It takes the same amount of effort to be small as it does to go big. Solve problems faster. There's always a faster thing that you could do that could take you to that next level. And you're probably not aware of it. You don't know what you don't know. I'd probably just pass down that quote to

simplify it. You don't know what you don't know. And I would point to the CIA talk that the guy gave. The head of the CIA when 9/11 happened here in the United States was asked, "How in the world did we not know this was going to happen?" And he said, "In life, there's known knowns, meaning the things that we know that we know. There's known unknowns, the things that we know that

we do not know. And there's unknown unknowns. The things that we don't know that we don't know. And this was an unknown unknown. Long story short, yeah, you just don't know what you don't know. You know, seek info. Typically, your uh next self is on the other side of something new that you learn.

&gt;&gt; There is a book that you recently recommended that is tied to this thinking in bets. &gt;&gt; Great book. It has rapidly become the second best book I've read this year be behind Mr.

&gt;&gt; Dude, yeah, that book's awesome, too. Thinking in bets is great. What a profound book. Thinking in probabilities, being able to understand when to go all in. I have I have a few videos on my YouTube channel where I talk about gambling and how I believe the advertising is gambling as an example. It's it's a profound way to think. I think it's like a base level of

thinking that every business person has whether they're aware of it or not. But yeah, great book. Absolute must read if you haven't read it yet. &gt;&gt; And it's tied to what you were saying as well that the unknowns, right, that always have to be taken into consideration and ultimately you will never be able to make a decision or take an action having all the information

because there's always the unknowns and and the luck factor. So if I promise you if you go and read those two books that we cover you you will get a ton of value.

&gt;&gt; What's the worst business advice you have ever received? &gt;&gt; You know I can't say I actively think about it. I I hope that I've suppressed it to not to not behave with it.

If I had if I had to come up with one that I've heard over the years, I've heard uh certain people like justify staying at the level they're at. And they claim that if you go bigger, like more problems present themselves. And that's typically not true. Like there's problems whether you stay the same, go smaller, go bigger. And I don't think the problems necessarily grow in size as

you grow bigger. But there's a lot of people I've met throughout my career that consistently try to justify staying at whatever level they're currently at. And I think that is a very problematic worldview to have. You know, I'm I'm not convinced of that, but I've heard many people talk about that.

&gt;&gt; What's the best business advice you have ever received? you know, my very first uh serious boss I had, he was my second marketing job, and he's he's a billionaire now, and he's um you know, profoundly shaped who I am today, cuz he he had recruited me when I was 19 years old. And the worldview that he helped pass down

to me was going bigger is as easy as going small. And I I didn't necessarily understand what he meant at the time because obviously I was just working a job. But time and time again how it would apply even when I worked for him towards the later stages of like when I first started to kind of understand the lesson

and its applicability to life and business. It's very easy. It technically takes the same amount of effort takes the same amount of hours in most instances to just produce a far greater result as it does to produce a little tiny result. And moral of the story is it's profound how much that specific worldview has shaped the level of action that I consistently take and that I

encourage others to take. And uh there are many other great pieces of advice that he handed down to me. But time and time again it all comes down to that. Just go bigger. You know &gt;&gt; we cover as well. You mentioned having very strong reasons as to why you want to hit million dollar months and beyond.

What are your reasons? Great qu. So, first of all, the investment amount. So, what I need to invest month over month, I I deeply believe in have a $100 million target relative to the 4% rule.

200k a month, 20 years in a row, 10% annualized return. Um, I pay a fuckload in taxes to be able to do that and just to earn what I earn in a month and in a year. It's um, it's profound how much taxes alone have actually make me want to earn more money just so I can net more money overall, which in turn makes me pay more taxes, which in turn actually makes me pay make more and earn

more and then pay more. It's an awesome cycle. I initially hated taxes, but surprisingly taxes have actually been a huge incentive driver for making a fuckload more money, taking care of my staff. I love having a business that can that can really make my staff rich. Paid my top sales guy last month, $73,000 and some change. Um, just last month we had a guy, he works with us, he's my

marketing helper. Bought him in Aston Martin. Uh, moved him down from one of the uh, northwestern states here called Washington down here to Miami, Florida. Um, shout out to him. Great, great guy.

And I think it's so cool to be able to have like that spillover effect where like you get rich enough to where everybody around you has a profoundly better life as a result. It is my genuine mission try to help as many people as I can get a fuckload richer.

Not just for my own financial upside cuz again I absolutely love money. Money brings out potential in people. Like the journey of getting richer has been the journey of personal development for me.

And again I absolutely love money. I love the stuff that I get to buy. I love the things I get to do as a result of money. I love jets. I love physical things, you know. I love helping people.

I love philanthropic causes. I love the speed in which I can materialize life. I love the impact I can have. I I love how many options I have when I go to do literally anything. But truly, one of the coolest things time and time again is just how cool it is to see the ripple effect in helping others get richer, too. because I can then kind there's um what's that little fork that like you

can ding and it vibrates. You know what I'm talking about? It's like a it's like a long U and and you have a prong and it's made of metal and you hit it against something and it vibrates and it creates an effect of everything around it as a result. And like when you take one of those same exact things, I can't believe I can't think of the name of this, but it's like this uh like this

prong that you slap and and again it just sits there and vibrates when something else is around it that's not moving that will start moving as a result of this thing just sitting there and vibrating and it creates like a little vibrating effect in this. I I think it's so cool to have that impact on others cuz again, money makes every single choice that we ever have

in life. So being able to help other people get richer and then seeing what they then turn around and do with a fuckload more money so cool, you know? It's so cool to be the causation behind that for a lot of people. I uh I find so much joy in that, you know. But yeah, I just look, I just absolutely love being rich. I absolutely love money. I think it's so fun just buying a bunch of cool

Uh being able to just actualize on potential, you know, being able to help other people get rich as being able to take care of my family, friends, loved ones, random people to the fullest extent. I think it's our responsibility to get rich because I think rich people are some of the most important people on earth due to the speed in which we can make life better for everybody. I think

it is extremely selfish to be impoverished and I do believe it's a choice. I know that everybody starts in different conditions, but you're a perfect example of that. Came from a third world country in an impoverished family and you chose. It wasn't random.

You chose to be the man you are today. You chose to help people the way that you've done. And and again, you've chosen day in and day out, decision by decision to be rich because you understand the benefits that it has in life. And as a result of that, think about how many people you can go and inspire to do the same thing from those same types of conditions. I've helped

people in some of the most bum nations on earth that are way worse off than Venezuela. I'll give you a great example. There was a guy that we had I don't even remember the country name in Africa. I'd never even heard of it before. Didn't even know it was a country. And I'm pretty geographically well-versed. Long story short, this guy, he he was he was

making, listen to this, $4,000 a year and being able to somehow live over there, which I don't understand what kind of life that would afford you, but long story short, this guy ended up getting a handful of clients, switched up, was able to make $40,000 a year. His quality of life for what he was able to do for him and like literally everybody around him was insane. This guy was like

sending me videos and all kinds of stuff that he was showing me he was doing for his community. He was like building wells, feeding like whole villages of people. Um he was doing so much to like improve the conditions of everybody around him. And and how did he do that? By getting other people richer through marketing services. You understand? It's like

money is so cool, you know? I think again I just think being rich is awesome. I I can't imagine being so selfish to not choose to be rich time and time again. And it's the best decisions you could make.

&gt;&gt; I would heavily agree with that. &gt;&gt; Yeah. you. &gt;&gt; What's the best life hack you have found after becoming rich? &gt;&gt; I'd say I'd say that I called it the compound life when I first started coming up with this. So, you can bring everything to you. Like my I have my chiropractors come to me, doctors come to me. My fiance had a dentist come to

us the other day. Uh I didn't know you could do that. I've had X-rays come to us. I've had like again groceries delivered to us. Uh obviously maids are awesome. I I can't even think of I dude there's so much that I have come to us and as a result it's my barber like everything dude. Literally everything comes to us and as a result of that it's bought back tremendous amounts of time

which is awesome because time is as people always say that variable that you don't get back and literally being richer allows you to buy back time as people have always talked about. And the crazy part is you don't always have to just use the extra time to go do stuff to get even richer than that. you could just use the time to like sit around and relax or like spend extra time with your

loved ones and family. Like there's so much cool that just buying back your time affords you, you know? And as a result of that, I think that's probably the coolest hack is through like quote unquote buying back your time. Like I'll give you a good one. I booked a jet the other day. It's a 4-hour flight and it only saves me four and a half hours. Okay. The jet was

$44,000. Okay. And listen to this. That extra four and a half hours that I save from not having to go through the traditional like commercial flight process is literally just going to be spent with my grandfather who's got two different types of cancers currently and could die any day. And literally as soon as I land in that place, I have my

grandfather picking me up jetside. So, I instantly as soon as I land, get to spend time with my grandfather throughout that remaining evening and the entire next day. And dude, I mean, I don't know what that'll be worth one day, you know? Is it worth $44,000 to spend an extra four and a half hours with your grandfather that you wouldn't have otherwise got to

spend? My grandfather for me has had a profound effect on my life. Been one of the only people in my entire family tree that's had like good, genuine, profoundly positive effects on my life.

I value my grandfather tremendously. And uh I think it's worth it. And that's an example where I'm not even using the extra time to make more money, which to be fair, I have many times over when I've done things like that. But yeah, this is one of those examples where just buying back time allows you to afford something like that. It's pretty cool what you can do with money. I'll

tell you that right now. &gt;&gt; What is the most underrated thing about becoming rich? &gt;&gt; I'd I'd say the status. I think status is so cool. A lot of people like to ignore status because they don't have it. But like there there it's it's remarkable what status does for you in terms of I'll give you a good example. I was shopping the other day. I walk into

a store. There's a guy with a $200,000 Richard Mill. There's a guy with a $400,000. We were in Laurel Piana if you're familiar with that. And the guy who was at the cash register. He owns a watch business coincidentally here in Miami. And he was using like I think he said like $100,000 in cash that he had just got from a watch to buy a fuckload of Laura Piana. So like a money printer

is sitting there on the counter. There's three people in the store. Me, this guy, and this other guy, and two of our wives. And long story short, the money counter is just sitting there in the back. Picture of money counter sound in the background. Okay. There's three guys in there with a couple hundred,000 each in watches. And we all look at each other and we all see what each other's

wearing. We don't necessarily look at the outfit. In this case, all we do is look at the watches and each one of us instantly know the level in which each one of us are operating and each one of us instantly feel like it's a great networking opportunity. We all start talking to each other, but we don't talk to each other about Like, we don't talk to each other about like

stupid little small-minded We instantly just start talking at a high level. Like, we're like, "Hey man, what's going on?" Like, "Love your watch." That's the intro to the conversation. And then from there, it immediately moves into businessoriented conversation about what one another's got going on. That's how we find out the one guy owns the watch business. Both

the guy and I who who don't own the watch business know the guy who does. We're like, "Oh you're like so and so." And he's like, "Oh yeah." And then the Laurel Piana sales rep chimes in and she's like, "Oh, you guys would love to know this other guy." And this other guy, he happened to be a billionaire. And and literally we all exchanged phone numbers. I had gone out

to a dinner with those guys about a month later with a handful of other dudes that we knew that we knew mutually. And dude, like it was just so cool. Like like that would never have happened if we all weren't signaling to each other the level that we're operating at through in this case the status of a watch. It's like the status of cars, the status of watches,

the status of where you live, like the status to be fair. This is my daily outfit. Like I just wear the same t-shirt. I same pair of shorts. I swap in and out watches and shoes. But the the point is like even outfits, you know, where you get to go, where you don't get to go. It determines your uh your network and like types of conversations you get to have. And it

doesn't matter to everybody to be fair. I mean, I' i've had still great conversations with all kinds of people that don't give a at all about my status. Not to just make it sound like you're not going to have good convos with people just cuz you don't have a nice watch, but I've had a lot cooler convos and a lot more of those cool convos as a result of status. I think

that's the most undermined characteristic. And most people never talk about because status is generally not something that you speak out loud, you know, it's something that you just signal to people through stuff. You know what I mean? And I completely agree with that because since I bought my Rolex, it has started so many opportunities that otherwise even on my way here, I got two

people, another person wearing a much better watch and a richer male will come and tell me that's a really nice watch. We just started a conversation because of that and and you know, &gt;&gt; that's what most people don't understand. Like they think you're just buying a watch to buy a watch and it's like no, dude, you're buying a watch to like

&gt;&gt; have an opportunity to to &gt;&gt; be like, "Hey, dude, that's nut." You know, it's it's it's a conversation starter. You know what I mean? &gt;&gt; Absolutely. So it it has been game changing. Honestly, I I'll suggest you you get a nice watch because it's that one thing that you can carry everywhere and it will open opportunities. On this &gt;&gt; very well

&gt;&gt; last two minutes I would love to ask you &gt;&gt; what didn't I ask you that could help other CEOs and founders crack million dollar months faster? &gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean pretty easy. There's a there's a few things that I consistently talk about on my channel like, you know, more like strategy oriented things with marketing, back-end selling systems, content first ad strategies, um

front-end selling systems as well, things like messaging lessons, uh funnels and conversion mechanisms, strategies and tactics, um sales lesson. I mean, there's all kinds of stuff that like tactically and strategically we could have talked about, but yeah, they can find all that kind of stuff on my YouTube channel.

&gt;&gt; All the links will be down below as usual. Is there anything else that you would like people to go and inquire or connect with you, Jeremy? &gt;&gt; No, I would just leave you with this. Go get richer. You know, super selfish not to.

&gt;&gt; As usual, everything will be down below. If you do enjoy this podcast, if you got any value out of this conversation, just share it with any other founder, CEO, business owner that could also get value out of it. That's all I ask. Other than that, I'll see you on the next episode.

And thank you, Jeremy, for making the time to share your insights. I'll see you in the next one. &gt;&gt; Thanks, man.
