On the path to improving your show rate, it's really easy to lie to yourself, gaslight yourself into thinking that you did everything you could when in reality there's so much more you can do. Few things on this. You might not be aware of everything you could do. That's where you got to start. Number two, you likely barely did but you can essentially yourself into saying, "Oh no, I did

everything that there is to do. I'm not going to do anything else." And you just give up. Either way, in either situation or whether this is just your very first video you're ever watching from me and you're looking to improve your show rates, whether it's for a callunnel, webinar, your low ticket to high ticket connection rates, your lead forms, no matter what kind of show rate it is,

even for 3-day challenge funnels or virtual events. These tips and best practices are going to help you and give you the certainty you need to take an aggressive level of action to get your show rate up substantially. My name's Jeremy Haynes. All we talk about on this channel is cracking million-dollar months. Whether it's your first million a month or the next million a month,

we're here to help you out. We don't make any income claims though or earning guarantees. We don't know who the you are and whether you have any probability to turn money into more money. These are all just lessons that we're handing down from clients who have been there, done that, putting you on game for free right here on YouTube. So, thank you for joining in. Consider

subscribing if you haven't done so already. And of course, if you're already a subscriber, welcome back. It's always a pleasure to have you. Without further ado, let's dive in. So, first things first, and I've seen this very frequently within the most recent 3 weeks in my Jeremy's Inner Circle group, and these are highle people. They make a minimum of 100K a month. We just gave

out two trophies for for guys that cracked 5 million a month. And it ranges everywhere in between. Most people average around a couple hundredk a month. And usually those are the guys that gaslight themselves into saying things like, &gt;&gt; "Oh, I did everything I could do on show rate and it barely improved." and you go look at what they actually did and it's

like 10% of everything that they could have done. There is an essential perspective that you have to keep when you're attempting to raise any statistic within your organization. It's an evolutionary trait in all of us to buy us towards an inherent energy conservation state. We used to be in a world of limited calories. We didn't have unlimited energy like we do today.

And our bodies have not caught up to modern times. So therefore, our brains, they try to hold us back consistently on gaslighting ourselves or lying to ourselves point blank and trying to justify, oh, we did everything we could do when in reality, you barely did Now, when I call people out for doing that and they miraculously right afterwards go take more action, the stat

improves. So, you got to start with the understanding that when you take any one of these actions that I'm going to sit here and encourage you to do today, don't just stop at those actions until you actually see the substantial lift in your show rate. Sometimes all it takes is one specific key action that improves your show rate upwards of 30%. In other instances, you might see a lift of like

10% doing one action and then a couple more percent taking another action and you've got to take a handful of actions to get that rather substantial lift. Either way, it's very important to note it can be one thing, but rarely is it one thing. In almost all instances, it's a stack and a combination of several things at once. So, let's go through a few of these show rate best practices

together and we'll break down what you should actually go do. So, first of all, we have my now five-part back-end selling system, but the fifth back-end selling system is currently an inner circle exclusive. So, for now, all you know about here on YouTube are the four.

My back-end selling system is made up of currently, as I just mentioned, four things. Number one, we have what we call confirmation page best practices. So, on your confirmation page, you want a few things. Number one, you want what's called breakout videos. Now, this is a great example where people will take a handful of random actions and say, "Oh, well, that didn't work." We have some

clients that have upwards of 19 breakout videos on their page answering a wide range of questions and they'll see a couple percentage points in lift and show rate and then they'll add that one next video and then bam, they see the substantial lift that they were originally after. So, it's important to note with the breakout videos, the concept is rather simple. You go talk to

your sales team and you say, "What are you guys annoyed that you're having to consistently answer? What are people showing up and asking that feels more like an education question they should know prior to the sales call versus what are you guys finding yourselves having to be repetitive about?" That could be a great place to source some initial information. In addition to that, we

have a whole list. We have an entire confirmation page best practices guide that we encourage everybody to go read. that's whether they're in our master internet marketing program or our Jeremy's inner circle group or of course a client of ours that has a wide array of questions and ideas for this specific topic. But I'll give you a few of them.

I talk about this one rather frequently. People want to know how they could get doing a deal with you. Okay? Yeah, they care about the upside for sure. They want to know the outcomes that they could generate working with you, but at the end of the day, what's going to hold them back from doing a deal is you not being transparent about what actually occurs if the deal goes

bad. That's generally what people care about. That's why when they go to review platforms like Trustpilot or go read what real people are saying about you on Reddit or find any platform for that matter that has a doomsday scenario review, they go there first in most instances rather than reading the five stars or the four-st star reviews.

There's a good joke running inside of the consumer world. And you can see these things on Reddit or Twitter as great examples of this where somebody who has a perfect five-star review will still be looked at with high skepticism versus somebody who has like a 4.7 is looked at in a much higher regard.

Again, people want to see how they could get doing a deal with you. So, a great way to demonstrate this, make a video transparently showing your dispute rate within your payment processor. Make a video transparently going through refunds and like why you had to refund and whether you actually did the right thing or not in a refund process. I'll give you a great example

of this. There's a company that we've used recently for some services and we recommended it to our inner circle group and it's specifically a company that helps with some Reddit stuff. Now, long story short, this specific company claims right on their confirmation page cuz they are like you and they follow my channel and they listen to the things that I say and those things work and

they transparently say they have about a 60% success rate in getting something that you pay them to do handled. Now, to be clear, that same company, they'll they'll claim that they have about a 30-day window to accomplish this.

Sometimes, give or take the service you buy from them, it could be as little as 72 hours for their guarantee window. Now, not only do they transparently say those two statistics, those two statistics mean nothing if they can't actually prove it, which is what they then do next. They then show people that signed up for them on a specific date and time and those people not getting

their service fulfilled and getting a refund on a certain date and time later. Okay? There's been one instance out of dozens and dozens of people that we've sent to this organization where I've had to contact the CEO and be like, "Hey, man, this guy's six days beyond his 30-day window, right? And then they process the refund." Now, here's the point that I'm attempting to make even

in that example, saying, you know, we occasionally slip up. We had a guy that we supposed to give a refund to after 30 days. We were in the process of communicating with the guy on trying to tell him that we might be able to take it down another way. Could you tolerate another week? but they were still outside of their refund guarantee window and they refunded it a couple days after

the 30-day window. It's like even being transparent about things like that inside of a little breakout video showcasing that you actually do what you say you're going to do. That way people know how bad the deal could be if it goes south. That's a great example of an extremely powerful breakout video. And by the way, there's dozens and dozens of others of these types of videos that you

can throw right onto a confirmation page. I'll give you one more as a great example of a breakout video. Urgency. People need a reason to actually do something and it has to be a highly believable reason that is aligned with their worldview. Meaning it has to be something that you say that makes them think what this person just said is absolutely the truth and I've now got to

prioritize this as an action I've got to do. Nobody really gives a to do anything at a given time besides the things that they have to do because almost all people that you're likely trying to sell to are busy as and therefore they always have something that's a priority and that's taking their current mind share space. Okay, your job is to have a majority or at

least a sliver of that active mind share things that they're actively thinking about that they need to accomplish and do. We have a client, his name is J. And J has an offer in this real estate info space. It's teaching people how to do what's called co-living. Now, without explaining all of this in an elaborate way, I'll simplify it for you. You can take a single family home and instead of

renting it to one person or instead of flipping it or all the other things you could do with a single family home, what he would encourage you to do with a co-living model is rent each room. It's kind of like a professional roommate situation. All the shared things become amenities like a living room or a kitchen or even a backyard. right now.

Most people like you, a rich person watching this are like, "Oh, the would anybody do that?" You got to remember, we're in a housing crisis. And believe it or not, a lot of people, not only here in America, but around the world, love that situation when they're tight on cash. Anyway, recent major cities in the United States, rolled back housing restrictions that would have

prevented investors from taking advantage of that opportunity. There's news articles that support this. There's the city municipalities themselves on.gov gov websites that show these housing restrictions being repealed and rolled back. And we took all that data, put it into a confirmation page that we smacked right at the top of that confirmation page for a webinar and for

a call funnel. And we told people, look, who do you think has the opportunity to make money and make the most money and literally just have the most opportunity in terms of the power of choice, all of what's available to them to decide on for these homes? the people who take action first right after a housing restriction is repealed and rolled back or the people who wait years and years

and years until it's already proven and something that people are already doing within a market that they may want to also participate in. Who's more probable to make more money and have more choice and have more opportunity? The answer is obvious. It's the person who would take action first rather than later. And that's exactly what we encouraged people to do within this on that confirmation

page. We created urgency by leveraging highly believable real life reasons that somebody would say to themselves, somebody smart, somebody rich, somebody qualified would sit there and watch that and say, "Makes a ton of sense.

Uh, I should definitely go to this guy's webinar if I actually have any base level of interest in doing this." We saw the largest lift in that one video in our show rate for our webinars. It lifted it by about 14%. That was huge.

Little things as an example like other confirmation page videos, breakout videos on this page also help to lift the show rate but only by a few percentage points. Now combine that and we were already over a 20% lift in show rate just between a handful of breakout videos on the confirmation page.

Generally the confirmation page is a great place to test messaging assuming that you have a good play rate on these videos. If you host videos in Wistia or Vidalytics as an example, these platforms will show you the quantity of people that hit the page versus the quantity of people that press play on these videos. In addition to that, of course, it shows things like the

engagement rate, meaning how well did you retain everybody as you sat there and did these. Now, here's the moral of the story. If the confirmation page videos have high play rates, meaning people are seeing it and they have decent engagement rates, meaning people are actually watching the videos to consume that messaging, and you don't see a lift in your show rate, that means

they're the wrong videos. That means it's the wrong messaging. It means you're talking about something that people don't give a about. And this is a very important thing that relates to the very first way I started this video. This is where a lot of people gaslight themselves. They say, "Oh, well, I tried breakout videos, Jeremy, and I didn't get a lift in show rate."

No, you tried a set or a breakout video, and it might have not been the thing that your people actually gave a about. Back to that J example, we had 19 videos. He's that client. 19 videos answering all the questions that the salespeople said came up during the sales process that they felt like would be really helpful for people to know. We reviewed webinar footage and it was the

same type of questions. These were the things that people clearly wanted to know. But here's the point. That didn't lift the show rate more than a couple percentage points when we had 19 total videos answering all these common questions. What raised it 14% was an urgencybased, highly believable reason.

And guess what? We didn't get that video onto the page for like 3 months into the deal. You see? So, it's like sometimes, and the most important thing that I want you to really understand about this whole process is you've got to take a consistent action until you get the result and outcome. You can't just take one action and be like, &gt;&gt; "Well, I tried it. You know, I didn't

get the result I was after. I guess that's it." &gt;&gt; It's like, no, no, that's not what you do. You take the action until you get the result. So, outside of breakout videos, there's a handful of other things that we encourage on confirmation pages, but naturally, we save that for the people who actually pay us. I'll still put you on game throughout this

video and give you a handful of other great things you could do naturally. But if you are one of those people who do want to pay us to get that certainty you're after to get loaded up with all the strategies and the ideas that you need and to be held accountable to actually do it, check out the links down in the description. If you're rich and trying to get a hell of a lot richer,

Jeremy's inner circle is perfect for you. If you're somebody that wants to learn all of these types of lessons in extreme depth, check out my master internet marketing class. There's no income restrictions. We still, to be clear, vet people and make sure that we actually believe in you, that you're actually going to get results with the program when we sell you master internet

marketing. You can't just log in and buy it. But again, my point is in either one of these scenarios, those links are down in the description. And you can also preview week one of my master internet marketing class if you're interested in that. It's a great place to train all your staff as well in a very cost-effective way. Okay, back to a few other things you could do. This is one

of five of my back-end selling systems. Okay, I will talk to you about four of those back-end selling systems. Now, confirmation page best practices are one of them. Value dense email sequences is number two. Now, when you find something that works really well on your confirmation page, that's the testing ground. Again, assuming you have a high play rate and assuming you have a good

engagement rate, you can then take that messaging and roll it out to these other three back-end selling systems. Okay? In this particular instance, I want to be really clear. You ideally take what's working on the confirmation page and then roll it over to the other free back-end selling system, value dense email sequences. So, once we saw that that single urgencybased video worked

really well, well, here's the thing. that video only had a 52% play rate. That 52% play rate resulted in a 14% lift just with that single video on the confirmation page. Why not roll it over to the emails? Our emails typically will see as low as about a 20% open rate. A lot of businesses we work with will see about a 40 to 60% open rate on average.

Now, factor in that Apple has that automatic open thing nowadays inside of their devices when you use that Apple Mail app, okay? But most people, they don't. Most people use the Gmail app or they just use Gmail period. That's a dominant amount of users. So, those are generally accurate open rates. Either way, I digress. The point I'm trying to make is very simple. What works on the

confirmation page as messaging that improves the show rate will also work when you roll it over to value dense email sequences. Most email sequences are absolutely whack. They talk about them in a way where they're just reminder-based communication.

&gt;&gt; Hey, got your call this time, this date, show up. Uh, hey, your webinars this time, this date, show up. Here's the link. Most of you don't even send off calendar invites for these things because you don't have your deliverability dialed in to be able to do so. Either way, my point is what these emails prior to a call or prior to a webinar or prior to any event that you

want people to show up for should actually be are valuable long form written, not just, hey, here's a video, click on it. Because you'll see link clickthrough rates are still super low, typically single digits in most emails.

So, what's that mean? We take the messaging we'd otherwise want somebody to click through to and watch, like in a video, and just break it down into a email. You know how easy this is to do with AI nowadays? You don't even need a copywriter anymore. You can have somebody who just mans these AI LLMs that are available to you. throw your video in there, transcribe it, send a

bunch of emails that you've already written that are in your communication style and say, "Hey, turn this into a email for me that's going to be in my reminder sequence and leave a place for me to put the time, date, and link to be able to join the call or the webinar in there, too." Right? So, it's a combination of a reminder sequence, but it's more so geared towards actually

providing like real life value things that people will read and say, "Wow, you know, I actually gave a to know that." We can send up to six, listen to this crazy six of these a day.

Now, do we encourage you to start with six a day? no. We encourage you to usually start with about three a day, sometimes four a day. Here's what you're looking for. You want to make sure that your open rates stay the same. As soon as you add a fourth email and your open rate drops, sure, test a different subject line, but it also might have dropped because that was one too many

emails. So, you can push up to about six a day. Also, make sure you're following all local regulations. California has the TCBA guidelines and Texas also has recent restrictions they've rolled out.

I know a lot of you are also international. Everybody over in the EU with the GDPR laws, I'm sure you guys all have a bunch of that you've got to be mindful of in terms of what times of day you are able to communicate with people. So, be very mindful of that if you do push up to six. But point I'm trying to make. You are able to send up to that many a day because what you are

sending is things that people actually would give a to know, things that they genuinely would want to be researching prior to talking to you, not a bunch of And this is another huge thing that you have to understand.

This is the part where I tell you again that you will likely gaslight yourself into thinking, &gt;&gt; "Oh, well, I wrote some emails and I thought they were valuable, Jeremy, and you a bunch of people told me to get and now I was sending too many emails." &gt;&gt; And it's like, "Yeah, dude." And then when I go read those emails and I say,

"Well, let me check them out." Every time I read them, to nobody's surprise, they are absolute and they are not things that people would actually want to know. This is what you have to understand about these. You have to be able to successfully craft information that the person you're sending to genuinely gives a about. Okay? It can't be random. It can't be stuff that

you just guess. It has to be things that your customers that are actively researching you, that are actively researching the opportunity, that are actively researching your product and service, genuinely give a about.

So, a great example of this, so many of you sitting here watching this withhold the price until the call. Yet, when they go on Google and they search, what's the price of this person's product? You'll let the AI search overview give a random answer that's not even your price. We had a guy just recently, he's in the inner circle, didn't want to reveal his price before a call. There

are many people where it's totally justified, just to be fair, where it doesn't make sense to have to reveal your price before a call. But his customers gave a deep about knowing that price and he still withheld it.

When you go into Google, this guy had a podcast from like almost 10 years ago where he was talking about a product that he was considering introducing for 5 to 7K. Well, fast forward to late 2025 while I sit here and watch this video and Google's AI search overview exists.

Now, people go on Google, what's this guy's product cost? The AI search overview says this guy's product likely costs somewhere between $5,000 and $7,000. His product costs $17,000 to $26,000.

So, when you look at the discrepancy of somebody who researched your product ahead of time and says, "Oh, that's pretty reasonable." They show up to a call and they're like, "It costs what?" There's a huge anchoring bias discrepancy there that's going to occur.

And instead of that specific business owner saying, "I'm just going to put out information about my price. I'm going to follow that fifth back-end selling system to start manipulating the AI." We'll talk about that in a separate video. I'm not releasing it to you publicly yet. It's an inner circle exclusive for now. But anyway, moral of the story is you have to understand that

answer is clearly something that people genuinely give a about. That'd be great to write a value dense email sequence for. That'd be great to have a confirmation page video for or it'd be great to nuke the internet of anything that could give an answer and an AI search overview or LLM for it.

That way that doesn't you and lower your close rate and show rates artificially. You understand? So again, my point is this is very important you understand this. Value dense emails are meant to be something that's actually valuable, not just a bunch of surface level Okay. One of the other back-end selling systems is what we call setter best practices. Now, setters or

closers, if you don't have setters to fulfill this role, reaching out before they actually have the call or reaching out to tell them about the webinar and confirm that they're going to show up for the webinar, dramatically improve the show rate to calls and the show rate to webinars and the show rates for any other key event that you're going to have. Them reaching out though with a

nice personalized set of information helps to mitigate the education call from occurring and it turns it into an actual sales conversation instead. If you have a team that tries to gaslight you into saying, "Oh, we don't have the capacity to reach out to people prior to the webinar, prior to the call, you tell them to themselves and you're going to replace them until

somebody comes into that organization and actually fulfills this role. This is a mandatory back-end selling system. It's free. It is something that improves the show rate by so much. I've been saying this for years. Have your salespeople send selfie videos prior to the caller, prior to the webinar. That generally improves the show rate a lot.

We sometimes have people who take that action and then say, "Oh, well, I took that action and it didn't work, Jeremy. I guess that's it for me." Huh? It's like, no. It's the same lesson as all these other ones I've talked to you about. Don't gaslight yourself. Change the messaging until you get the outcome.

And by the way, there's a reason that there's more than one back-end selling system. That reason is your specific demographic likely consumes one out of four of these or maybe a handful of four of these in some random combination that you don't know. And this is really important why you do all of them instead of just one or the other. Okay?

Sometimes people get lucky and they take action on just one and they see the improvement. Sometimes you have to take action on all of them across all four of these in this case until you get the outcome that you're after. Okay? So anyway, setter best practices is very simple. Have the education call before the actual call occurs. Have the education call prior to the webinar.

That's what they're there for. Reach out and confirm that somebody's going to show up, but don't just do so in a selfish way. That's what you have to understand about all this. when you just call and say, "Hey, just want to make sure you're going to show up." &gt;&gt; Like, that's not how it works, dude.

Book a five-star hotel, go to the Four Seasons. They'll text you. They'll email you. They may even call you and they'll say, "Hey, what's going on, Mr. Haynes? Wanted to reach out. Extend a warm welcome from the Four Seasons of Wherever. Wanted to see if you had any preferences. Wanted to tell us your arrival time. Want to make sure everything's set up for you." Well, they

don't reach out and selfishly say, "Hey, what's going on, man? Just wanted to make sure you're going to show up." &gt;&gt; The It's like, no, they say, "Hey, Mr. your hands. Wanted to reach out and see if your wife wanted a cozy robe again. And if you guys still aren't drinking, we can have a nice non-alcoholic bottle of champagne in there for you. I know also in these past

days you've had with us in different locations, you've made a note to say that your wife loves chocolate. We'll make sure to have that in the room for you. What time you thinking of arriving and do you need any transportation to the hotel today? It's like assume the show up, right? Hey, what's going on customer? Saw you opted in for our training tomorrow afternoon. It's at 3

Eastern time. Wanted to check, did you get the calendar invite with the link yet? Or did you get any emails with the link to join yet? It's one of the most common things that people ask when they're stuck unable to join in. They just can't find the link. Wanted to make sure you have it. Is there anything else I can help you with or answer for you while I'm on the call here? By the way,

I took a moment to look you up and I found out that you do this. We had a few people like you who have done this, too. I'm going to send you some information on those guys so you can see their outcomes and what their process was. You know, it's like do something other than just the selfish Oh, you got to show up. losers, dude. No wonder you have a shitty show rate.

Okay, last one. My Hammer Them campaign. This is one of the five back-end selling systems that cost money. There's a second one now, the newest one, the fifth, that also costs money, but again, we'll talk about that in another video.

The hammer them strategy is awesome. We found with all the people that we work with, they had a lot of content, both short form and long form. We also found that they were great talking heads and we could have them sit down and film videos that we needed from them on different topics or questions. The same logic as all these previous three back-end selling systems applies to the

hammer them strategy. We take short form content and we take long form content and what we do is we distribute it to people via social media platforms and we shoot for a frequency goal somewhere between about 15 and 20. So what that means simply put is that we're taking anywhere from 30 to 50 pieces of short form content and anywhere from about 15 to 30 long form pieces of content. Long

form like this by the way and we'll take both. will pay to distribute it into the person's news feed on Facebook, Instagram. You could do it on Tik Tok. You could even do it on YouTube, man.

You could do it on LinkedIn. You could do it wherever you can pay to distribute content. And we pay to put it in front of them. And we try to reach them in a high enough frequency between the call time being booked and the call or between the webinar being opted into and the webinar or between the low ticket purchase and the high ticket upsell average sales timeline. And we

pump content in front of those people. But we pick strategic content. the content that we specifically pick. This matters a lot. And this is also important to note back to my original point at hand. You take this action until it works because it works. You don't take it once and then gaslight yourself into saying, &gt;&gt; "Oh, I took the action. It didn't

work, dude. I put some basic videos out there that I guessed on and I didn't get the outcome I was after." &gt;&gt; No, you take these actions aggressively and you pursue them to the extent of what is required to get the lift in the show rate. Now, here's the thing. You seek certainty in videos like this, but you won't pay for the certainty to get the actual examples. You seek certainty

in videos like this, but you won't actually get the SOPs that we have, the training videos on these and put inside of a community with a bunch of people who have already improved their show rates 20, 30, some of them even 40 percent. Right? And so, I want to be extremely direct when I say you now know what you can generally do. But if you choose not to give us money at

this point, I want to be very direct in saying you have to figure it the out. You have to actually take the time to rotate your messaging until you actually get the outcome. Okay? And it's very, very important that you understand this. I tell you this as transparently as I possibly can. I withhold a tremendous amount of data for you here on YouTube. And yet, I still put you on

more game than every other who charges you money. This content and what I just told you to do works extremely well. I just encourage that you check out those links in the description. nut up and actually buy something from us because that's where the real sauce is.

That's where all the examples of this are. That's where me being able to step in and help hold you accountable to actually doing these things and making sure you follow through until you get the outcome you're after and being able to help guide you with your specific business and your specific customer type in mind to master the messaging to actually see a huge result. What's a 20

to 30% lift in your show rate? What's it actually worth? How many dollars would you generate as a result of that lift? that massive improvement in that stat, right? And just know this is one of so many different areas that we can help you with. So, listen, at the very least, check out all the other videos here on my channel. Subscribe to the channel.
