low ticket to high ticket is absolutely awesome. It liquidates a lot of the ad spend or for those of you who do it completely wrong, a very small percentage of the ad spend. In a great scenario, you're profitable before you even make the high ticket sale. In this video, we're going to cover some of the best practices from people who have been there, done that, and liquidate all

their ad spend, and are ideally break even or profitable going into the whole process. We're also going to be covering some of the best practices to take that high ticket sale that you want to have occur and condense the time frame down to something that's more ideal than a couple months or even a couple weeks.

There are a specific set of actions and tactics that you must implement in your low ticket to high ticket process. We're going to cover a majority of them here in today's video. If you're new to the channel, welcome in. All we talk about around here is cracking million-dollar months. Whether it's the first millie or next millie a month, you're in the right place because all we do around here is

hand down lessons for people who have been there, done that, and cracked these big numbers. Let me be very direct in saying though, there are no income claims. You are likely an absolute idiot. A part of the 99.99 plus% of people who never stand a chance in hell to hit these kinds of numbers. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics claims that.1%

of all business owners on Earth ever crack $10 million a year. That's an 8 figure run rate. let alone the even smaller percentage of people that ever crack million-dollar months or the even smaller percentage that ever crack bigger numbers than that. And no, this isn't some weird way of saying, "Oh, well, you still stand a chance." You have the highest probability possible.

Imagine being a germ on somebody's hand and thinking that Purel won't wipe you out when it has a 99.99% chance of doing so. That's what you likely are. It's the germ that thinks that you are not going to get wiped out, but you will get wiped out. So again, these are just lessons for entertainment and education purposes exclusively that we're handing down to you in today's video. So welcome in if

you're new to the channel. That's all we talk about around here. And of course, if you're already a subscriber, welcome back. Always pleasure to have you. Without further ado, let's dive in. The first way that you will likely up your low ticket to high ticket process is in the pricing decision of the main low ticket product. You have to understand the very first thing that you

want to be thinking with to immediately stack your odds of success in the low ticket portion of this funnel. The success in the low ticket portion of the funnel would mean you liquidate the ad spend it took to get the buyer in to then start the upsell process to the high ticket product. That's typically the best scenario. An even better scenario than that would be getting to

the point where you're profitable from the low ticket sale itself. That way, every dollar that you make past that point is just even more profit that reigns in. A majority of you are probable to lose money and liquidate a small percentage of the total spend in that low ticket process. And again, pricing is one of the biggest ways. It's the initial decision that you need to

make. The pricing range that can typically you is somewhere in like a $7 to upwards of $50 range. Most people who really whiff, they're somewhere in like the $7 to $30 range.

This is typically the nogo zone. The illusion of this specific price is you justify to yourself. You're like, &gt;&gt; "Well, I'm going to get a lot more people to buy if whatever the first thing is is really cheap, &gt;&gt; right?" And technically, you're not wrong. Like, you're going to get a higher percentage of people that'll purchase. But the issue is is you're

also going to attract somebody who has a lower probability to purchase the next things because they purchase something too cheap initially. In addition to that, you have to consider that whatever that lowest ticket thing is, like the literal entry point of the funnel in most instances, that specific price, if you acted like nobody else purchased beyond that, that would be what your AOV

essentially rounds out to become. So right away when you consider pricing, the very first step, the very first thing that you're actually going to charge, if whatever you actually charged for that was the only thing that somebody bought and you thought to yourself, well, could I get purchases below that specific cost, you're going to be in a much better place. So as an

example, if I charged $99 for the first thing, and I could get a cost per purchase, okay, below a $99 threshold, I'm in a good spot. Okay. Anything less than $99, I'm break even or profitable.

Now, to be clear, if I had an AOV because the only thing that somebody bought was the first thing and it was like $7 or it was $30 or whatever it is, is my CPA probable, especially this time of year to be less than that specific price, right? And then when you think in terms of probabilities, which one sounds more probable, right? I want to give myself the wiggle room because the lower

that my cost per purchase has to be for me to be break even, the lower my probability is of actually getting to the point where I'm break even or profitable on the low ticket sale. You understand? So why would you set the bar with your AOV to be so low where you're immediately going to shoot yourself in the foot and yourself with your AOV. The price can be whatever you want

it to be. People tell me all the time, they're like, "Oh, I have a BookFunnel as an example, and the BookFunnel is my low ticket product. No one's going to buy a book for more than like $20 with the free plus shipping and handling cost, &gt;&gt; right? And yeah, I mean, again, you're not wrong. And most people who run book funnels, they are going to be running at

a negative burn rate and they're going to have to sustain until people read the book before they have any probability to get the high ticket sale to occur. So again, in terms of low ticket funnels, there's all kinds of lessons we'll talk about. We'll save that here for a moment. Just remember pricing. Ideally, the very first thing that they buy if your AOV was that, okay, it's good

enough to where you can realistically get cost per purchases with a scaled amount of spend behind it, by the way, to sustain profitability or break even, okay? Or at the very least, like at least get it to the point where the AOV is high enough to where it liquidates more than 60% of your total ad spend just in the first purchase alone. Okay, pricing is very important to understand.

Most people also really whiff on the low ticket to high ticket funnel by not having enough upsells. Okay, so when you look at the total amount of upsells that you realistically need, ideally you have three to four altogether. Okay, and these come in strategic forms. Let me give you a great example of this. If I did run a bookfunnel as my low ticket product, the book itself can have a

little bump cell right there in the actual order form. I can add something like the audio version of the book. I can add something that complements immediately the actual purchase occurring. If I go to a nice steakhouse, let's say I go to Morton's, I go to Flemings, whatever it is that you specifically love, your local steakhouse near you. Okay? Let's say we go to

Mastros together. One of the first things that they do when you order your steak is say, "What would you like with the steak, sir? Do you want the black truffle butter? Do you want the bone marrow butter? Do you want the red wine butter? Would you prefer us to load it up with crab and lobster? Like, what do you want on top of it?" That's immediately their version of a bump

sale. It increases their overall AOV. That's the first upsell that you got to think with is what's your version of adding the $17 butter to the stake. Okay? Something that when you look at it, it's just a little check box right there on the order form itself. It doesn't need a whole sales page. It's super obvious that it would make whatever you just bought better. Okay?

Without a lot of explanation needed. That should be the very first upsell is ideally the bumpell. Okay, that little check box on the actual order form itself. Now, the rest of your specific upsells have to be something that complements that low ticket product. One thing that I talk about inside of my inner circle class and that I've also covered inside of Master Internet

Marketing, which are both paid programs, you can check out the links for those down in the description. The high ticket product is what we label the main thing. Okay? And in this high ticket product, it's made up of a bunch of smaller things. And when you draw it out like this, you'll realize that whatever the high ticket thing is, all these little things like whatever it is that makes up

that high ticket thing that you've actually got. This is where your low ticket products and your upsells would ideally come from. You would take realistically like thing number one that makes up your high ticket product and that would become your low ticket product. And then because somebody purchased that, there's typically in most instances some specific things that

kind of make up that as well. And those can be easy upsells. So I'll give you a perfect example of this. I historically have had a low ticket product that was called the perfect cold video pitch bundle. So for over a decade with my marketing agency, we've been doing this thing we call the perfect cold video pitch. I'll sit down, I'll make a video.

And through time, we started just customizing these without me having to sit down and make them myself. My sales team would sit there and do it all day and just blast out these video pitches.

Everybody's super lazy that pitches people. And as I'm sure you can imagine, looking at your DMs every day, you know exactly what I'm talking about. Somebody like me comes along and I give you a custom video where you listen to it and you say, "That strategy this guy's talking about actually makes a whole lot of sense." the probability of you responding is far

greater than just one of these that hits you up with these super selfish messages they send. Almost like they're demanding a response or entitled to a response. But anyway, I digress.

The perfect cold video pitch is a great way to acquire clients with a marketing agency. And for a good few years, I had my entire education company built around helping agencies. Okay, so long story short, the main product that I had, okay, it was called High Ticket Agency.

High ticket Agency was the main thing. It helped with everything that an agency would need to know to start or scale up aggressively. And one of those things that made up high ticket agency was obviously learning how to acquire clients. That is a branch in this example. It'd be like thing number one, how to acquire clients. But there's more than one way to acquire clients. There's

the video pitch strategy, which also incorporates what we call valuedriven follow-up. You can run paid ads. You can go to events. You can have referrals. You can post organically. There's all different kinds of ways. The way that I specifically chose to teach as my low ticket product was, well, let me show them how to do the perfect cold video pitch and let me teach them how to do

valuedriven follow-up. Now, if you cared about that, okay, and you chose to buy that low ticket thing, there's a very high probability that you run a marketing agency and there's a very high probability that you care about getting clients. And so some of the other things that I could easily upsell that complemented the low ticket product was literal examples and conversations that

we've had. I'll give you a great example of this. The little bump cell like the first little checkbox that we talked about could be something as simple as a swipe file. Here's scripts for what to say in the DMs, emails, and it could be as simple as that. just a little bump sale adding let's say another $19 to the total AOV of each one of those individuals who chooses to purchase that

bump sale. Now the very first page that comes after they choose to purchase the main perfect cold video pitch bundle is going to be something that further extends value to them related to what they specifically just purchased. So in this example, let's say that I chose something like actual conversations. So instead of a swipe file, that next page, I could go grab and export, without

exaggeration, hundreds, at a minimum, hundreds of conversations that we've had back and forth with people showing the original video pitch and what we said, the back and forth associated with it until we get to the point of the sales call. That'd be incredibly valuable for that type of person who's wanting to buy that. Now, again, outside of the logic of what to actually upsell, you tie back

into that concept of, well, what should you charge? Okay, you got to realize that roughly 10 to maybe 30% at best in most instances are going to purchase whatever these upcoming upsells are after that first thing was purchased. So ideally, they're high enough that with a low quantity of people buying them, you get your AOV up with a weighted average from having a higher ticket thing on the

back end. By higher ticket, as an example, let's say the perfect code video pitch was $100 or $50. that second purchase, not the bump sale, not the little check box, but the second purchase would ideally be like $100 to $300 somewhere in there. Now, let me be clear in saying this again. You might be like, "Wow, that's way too high." And there's going to be a lower quantity of

people that buy it. But the lower quantity people that buy it, because it's a higher priced product in the hundred, low couple hundred range. It's going to weight my AOV up dramatically higher than if I had 50% of people buy at $10. You understand? So again, it's just math, which you think you're smart enough to be doing when you say, "Well, I should charge less so I get more

people to buy, and so therefore, my AOV is actually higher." But again, if I had less people than you buy, and they buy at a higher price for $100 minimum, I'm still going to have the higher AOV out of those two examples. And the perspective I'm sharing with you is literally just math. You could do it yourself, and you could find out for you specifically and what pricing you're

considering what would actually make the most sense. And obviously, you then need to follow through and make sure that whatever you chose to charge less for is actually being purchased at the percentage rate that you factored into your math for why you justified charging so low. Okay, back to my point. When you're selecting the upsells themselves, okay, as I just mentioned, ideally it

complements whatever the original thing was. Okay, now here's the second upsell in this example. So again, we had the bump cell, we now had the swipe file, which would be the first official upsell. We've got two more that we ideally want to factor in. The second upsell could be sales call recordings.

What would you give a about if you were in the middle of pitching people to become clients of yours for a marketing agency? Bang. You'd obviously care about outside of what to say in the messages in the swipe file that I could send to you. You'd clearly also care about what to say on the sales calls. And again, we have hundreds of sales calls recorded that we could easily bundle together and

sell inside of that low ticket product and put inside of a course. Okay. Now, here's the thing. This is also where most people really mess up. When you get to the point where you're considering other upsells, because you may not have a bunch of stuff like that already created for something that just makes clear as day sense to add to your ascension process, you'd likely want to

add something that is also branched from the main thing. Okay? And now again, this could be completely different. Back to my original point, the main thing in this example I'm providing to you was again called high ticket agency. Okay?

In this high ticket agency product, sales and acquiring clients was only one thing. What would somebody else care about after they actually got the client? all kinds of They'd care about staff. They'd care about who to hire and when. Maybe they just want access to a contractor network of people that can help them fulfill. Maybe they'd want contracts, as an example, or

agreements that they could send out to people. Sometimes in an agency, people will ask you for things like a proposal, right? And I could give a bunch of proposal templates as well. I could also obviously talk about all the specific skills that agencies actually sell. And I could pick a completely different upsell that just relates to any one of those particular things. And again, I'm

ideally going to charge in my case a minimum of 100 all the way up to 300 for each one of these upsells individually. Now, as you can see, when you look at the upsell process, this is where we get a higher AOV that lifts us to the point of profitability. Most people when they do low ticket to high ticket, they it up right away because they don't have enough upsells and the upsells that they

do have are too low price. You got to remember the whole point of the low ticket to high ticket process is to be salesy and liquidate your ad spend. Hey, if you want to be moral in your mind and you want to be Mr. High horse, &gt;&gt; oh, I don't want to have three to four upsells, Jeremy. I don't want to be too salesy.

&gt;&gt; Congratulations, buddy. You're going to be unprofitable. I am not going to be like you. I'm going to be profitable in my low ticket, high ticket ascension. You understand? That's the difference.

Sell people that's actually valuable and you won't have that dumbass thought in the first place. Every single thing that I just gave as an example, if somebody bought it, it would genuinely help them dramatically improve pitching people and getting clients, what to say when pitching people and trying to get clients, what to say on sales calls if they got to the point where they get

clients, and whatever the else I'd choose for the last step. Again, it would also be hypervaluable and worth whatever the I'm going to charge for it. That's the other big way that people really whiff on having enough upsells in the first place. They are not valuable people, okay? And as a result of that, they're not creating value for the people that they're selling to. And

so they feel like pieces of when they try to sell people stuff because again, they're selling absolute junk. Pick great things that are actually probable to help people. And guess what?

If you don't have a whole curriculum of to pull from easily and pick and choose between and you have to create it, no problem. Just choose things that are actually valuable and it'll easily help you overcome that little belief you've got of, well, I don't want to have three to four upsells. That seems way too salesy. What a dumbass belief. But anyway, back to my point.

You have to price these things ideally in a $100 to $300 range. Okay, now let me be clear. If you see that next to nobody's purchasing your upsells, there's two things you can adjust. What you chose to sell and the price of what you chose to sell. The easier thing to pick is the price of what you chose to sell. So, don't be afraid to tinker with it and change the range so you can

increase the overall percentage of people that are actually taking your upsells. Because you need ideally about 5 to 20% of the total quantity of people who hit those pages to ideally say yes.

Which again brings me back to point number one with what you price the first thing at. If you charge a measly $7 to $30, you're going to get a bunch of broke dumb asses that charge back.

You're going to get a bunch of people that don't have a shot in hell of buying something for $100 to $300 right after because again, you charged too little. Okay, if I charge $70 for a New York strip or a filt, whichever one you want, they're $70. I can charge $19 for butter. Okay. If I have my entry-level product be a $7 hot dog and then I try to upsell a $70 steak and $19 butter, I

have the wrong type of customer who's not probable to buy the higher ticket thing in my upsell process that comes right after it in the funnel itself. You understand? I have to have the right type of person there. If I sell the $70 steak at Mastros, the $19 butter is my little checkbox upsell. They're going to probably buy the $30 to $50 sides and they're probably not just going to buy

one. They don't just want creamed spinach. They want my white cheddar mac and cheese. You understand? They want the buttercake at the end of the meal. They would love the delicious lobster bisque. And guess what? They may also want incredible bottle of wine with the meal. You get where I'm going with this?

The right types of people that you attract in the first place with the first thing wildly dictate the upsell rate of everything that comes after it in the funnel itself. So, make sure you pick the right and make sure you charge the right amount for it. Now, when you have whatever it is that you've chosen to sell officially in the hands of your customer that just bought it,

the biggest thing that inhibits them from buying the high ticket thing, the thing that you've actually wanted to sell them this entire time where the true money's made, the main thing that's going to inhibit that sell from occurring and delay it from occurring is the low ticket thing or things that they just bought. Whatever it is that you actually sell has to be consumed and

applied easily. Okay? It has to be something that can have immediate effect. You don't want to sell somebody a book that's this thick or even this thick and just wait for the person to read it. Okay? A low quantity of people even read books that they buy. Okay?

When you sell somebody a book, one of the best things that you could do in this example of using a book to speed up the consumption and the ability to apply the lessons from the book, give them a little video sequence that walks through each chapter and the lessons of the chapter and how to apply the lessons from that chapter. Write an email sequence that has one email per chapter

with the executive summary of what that chapter covers and a specific section in the email that says, "Here's how you go apply this and get this from reading this specific chapter." Make it easy.

Encourage the action. Make the consumption simple. Make it so you have the highest activation rate possible, no matter what the low ticket thing is. If somebody buys something low ticket, they will not buy anything else until the value of the low ticket thing they bought is extracted successfully. There has to be usage and there ideally even more than usage has to be a result. And

sometimes the perceived value solely comes from the consumption. Once the consumption occurs, your probability of that high ticket upsell occurring really fast. Okay? If you have a low activation rate, meaning the total quantity of people that buy your thing, they don't even use it. Whatever it is that you're selling them, they barely log in, they barely use it, they barely consume

it. Naturally, you're going to have a lot of objections about spending a few thousand or tens of thousands of dollars with you right after that occurs. Okay? Comparatively, if you get 80 plus% of people who buy that low ticket thing within days to consume it, use it, apply it, and get some kind of win. Okay? The win has to be fast. Okay, it has to happen quickly. You cannot have a slow,

long, monotonous, drawn out win. It has to be something where as soon as I apply whatever it is that I've just consumed, when I apply it, the the speed to getting the result is very quick. Okay, if I have somebody back to my example where I sold them that perfect cold video pitch, the consumption is as simple as like two videos and an SOP that they can read through with video

examples of what they look like. From there, I have to encourage them to go actually make a few. That's the biggest challenge of that part of the process. The consumption in that example is rather easy. I then have to encourage somebody to actually sit down, make the videos, and send them out. Most people who would buy that specific product. And there's a big reason that we don't sell

that specific product or we don't even try to sell to that type of demographic anymore cuz most of them are poor. When you try to sell to poor people, they don't understand what it takes to be successful. That's why they're poor.

That's why they're in the position that they're in. They don't know all of what it takes. So, what we found, and this is actually really interesting, when we sold somebody that perfect cold video pitch bundle, our biggest issue wasn't consumption. Our biggest issue was them sitting down, making enough of the videos, and actually sending them out.

Most of them had a lot of apprehension about pitching businesses in the first place. Obviously, that's a huge limiting variable that we have to address. So, here's what we started to do. We added a complimentary mindset course. As you can imagine from sitting here watching me, I'm extremely direct, okay? I made a banger, a banger of a series of videos, like three videos that we added

in. If you purchased that perfect cold video pitch bundle, we immediately added in three extra videos that addressed the mindset of getting started with a marketing agency, which in reality was me sitting there just saying in the simplest way of saying it, you have to pitch businesses. You have to pitch a fuckload more businesses than what you think you need to pitch. You need to

pitch them on all channels, not just some channel that you think. You need to optimize whatever pages you're sending from to make it look like you're a legitimate business person and not some sitting in their apartment that makes no money and has no idea what the they're doing. Things like that. As soon as we added that to it, the success rate of people actually going out and

pitching and getting those responses in a tight time frame went up dramatically. So again, to be very clear with you, whatever you're actually going to sit there and sell to people, no matter what it is, no matter what that low ticket thing is, you have to optimize around the consumption being quick and more importantly them actually getting a result quickly. An easy quick result has

to happen. And whatever inhibits them naturally, you'd want to just add that to the main product that they bought. Okay? Add that to that low ticket thing. Don't make it an upsell. just add it so you increase the speed in which they can get a result. Cuz again, that's what inhibits you from successfully getting that high ticket upsell. Now, to be clear, the whole second half of this

equation is you factoring in setters and them strategically knowing when to reach out to these individuals that you're going to sell to. Your setter team ideally needs triggers. This is very simple to create, by the way, with modern-day marketing automation and CRM.

If you track the consumption, things as simple as like, did they open the access email, did they download whatever the low ticket thing was? Did they consume whatever the low ticket thing was?

Whatever the low ticket thing is, did is if it was a physical thing, did they receive it? Right? Cuz your setter doesn't have to reach out and immediately act as a salesperson. They can act as an accountability coach. Now, there's a whole set of best practices that I teach to people who actually pay me money. So, I'm going to withhold all those specific lessons from you from

this point forward. You can join into one of two things that I've got access for you down in the description of this video. Number one is Jeremy's Inner Circle. It's for rich people trying to get a fuckload richer. That's where we include things like one-on-one. That's where we include quarterly in-person masterminds here at our facility in good old Miami, Florida. That's also where we

include our weekly group calls, a massive course vault, unlimited access to Jeremy AI, and an extremely active community of all of those rich people trying to get a fuckload richer. It's an incredibly valuable product, but again, you've got to make a certain amount of money and you've got to commit for a certain amount of time. We have far too many people that would otherwise buy

that product if we didn't add that friction. And we want the right types of people joining into it. We have my flagship education company product, Master Internet Marketing. You can preview week one of that 7-week live class below. It includes lessons extensively on what we just talked about here, taught in a seven-week set of live classes. There are 3 to five hours per

class. If you join in in between our live cohorts, no problem at all. You get access to the most up-to-date information from our most recent cohorts. You have homework libraries to consume in between those live classes, those 3 to 5 hour lessons. Each week is, of course, on a different topic. You have dozens of SOPs that you get access to and also Jeremy AI and a very active

community. Whichever one sounds more appropriate for you, be sure to check out the links for those down in the description of this video. And either way, subscribe, check out all the other videos on my channel. Thank you so much for being here. Go out there and get richer. Toxin.
