Anybody who operates with sales and marketing separate or where those departments like point the finger at each other of blame. Terrible way to operate. Huge limitations. Massive friction. No real progress is made when you do that. The worst thing that can happen is when a sales team just says some super basic like &gt;&gt; oh the leads were unqualified or oh the

leads were like too cold. &gt;&gt; There's nothing to do with any of that in terms of actionable insights. What do you think is the number one dumb thing that people do in their funnels that is costing them millions of dollars and holding them back from scaling to million-dollar months?

&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think everybody's extremely &gt;&gt; Today's guest is the master of scaling to millionoll months and he's even helped over 41 people do it. Jeremy, welcome to the Masters of Lead Generation podcast. Hey, thanks for having me on. I appreciate you.

&gt;&gt; Awesome. Let's let's get into it. When other people work on funnels, because it's often a very misunderstood concept for some reason. I don't know. I think everybody thinks Russell Brunson internet marketer scam. I think funnels not optional. Just every touch point figure out the math for you. How do you explain funnels to people who are like, "Hey, do I even need a funnel? What is a

funnel?" Yeah, fair point. I mean, pretty simple, you know, it's just a it's a modern iteration of a website optimized for a conversion event of some kind. So, whereas websites are traditionally just places to demonstrate what it is you do, how you do it, provide, you know, a whole whole plethora of information about you, your team, your business,

services, products, etc. Um, funnels are more optimized for specific direct response outcomes. So, if we're trying to generate a booked call, it's much better to use a call funnel. If we're trying to run a webinar, we're going to use a webinar funnel. If we're trying to sell a low ticket product and to send somebody to a high ticket product, there's just a specific sequence of

pages that are better suited for that comparatively to a website. So that that's all funnels really are. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Awesome. Today I want to focus on the book a call funnel. That's what we focus on mainly for our clients, like booking in qualified leads for high ticket that actually close. And I love your YouTube. I think you're like the only other person who really talks about

how to master sales and marketing being one comprehensive system. Can you talk a bit more about that and how you make sure that sales and marketing act as one?

&gt;&gt; Yeah, so first of all, anybody who operates with sales and marketing separate or where those departments like point the finger at each other of blame, terrible way to operate, huge limitations, massive friction, no real progress is made when you do that. Um I I give you a great example literally from earlier today. I was on a call with the client's team and they have a total

of 68 total call slots that are available to book into and over the most recent 3 days the cost per call had gone up about 30%. We were dealing with a little bit of ad fatigue and the client, we unfortunately didn't have any additional creatives that were sitting around in our in our surplus ready to relaunch with. So we could reduce our cost per call again by overcoming the

fatigue. And I had to tell I had to tell the sales team, you know, I called them up each individually and I I made sure to express to them the the severity of my role within their organization, the impact that I have on their finances, their earning potential, and and I just let them know. I said, "Listen, take my job super seriously. I fully understand the impact that I have when I fail to

fulfill my obligations to fill up your calendars completely and I take that extremely seriously and and you know by no means am I u am I relenting on the client here and just letting them you know not give me what I need. You know I I I fully accept the responsibility of the situation I've created.

&gt;&gt; And anyway I do that as an example in this case to just demonstrate the the symbiotic relationship that sales and marketing has there. They're in no way shape or form separate. And every great marketer knows that when you when you get truly articulate feedback from a sales team, it's some of the most actionable advice that you can have. The worst thing that can happen is when a

sales team just says some super basic like, "Oh, the leads were unqualified," or, "Oh, the leads were like too cold." There's nothing to do with any of that in terms of actionable insights. Um, I will say this, if if you do have a sales team like that, but you still record the calls, there's a lot of great options nowadays. One of my inner circle members, his name's Daniel Fosio.

He he goes by Cold Email Wizard if you ever heard of that guy. Runs a company with some some of his business partners called List Kit. And Daniel was recently talking about this AI tool called Manis.

Manis is mus.AI. And it's it's kind of it's a it's a um credit based system for an LLM. Whereas the big LLMs like ChattyBT, Claude, even though to be fair, the Manis tool uses these APIs and it's still technically those LLMs, but it's like it's like those same LLMs without guardrails.

Simply put, we we will take all of the of the sales calls that are happening and with the right prompting, we can feed them into a tool like Manis that doesn't have guardrails, that's a credit based LLM, and we can get a tremendous amount of feedback. And the cool part with with what Manis does um and this is an example of what Daniel was talking about and and something that he put us

on to as a mastermind group was he had visualized the data as well into like little pie charts and and bar graphs and showed the the frequency that specific very actionable reasons that can improve the marketing process to help bring in more qualified leads, better framed leads, expose the specific components of back-end selling systems that need fixed and tweaked and optimized further. The

the point being like ideally we get actionable insight from the sales reps where they give us something that we can actually use and and work with and and and therefore make improvement.

&gt;&gt; However, even without that nowadays, even if you have this kind of sales team, it's like just constantly blaming marketing, which which isn't a good frame to be in regardless. We can take all those calls, we can feed them into an AI, we can get all the feedback that we need regardless. Um, but anyway, point being, when you're not in the blame game and you're actually working

together to drive a lot more revenue in to the organization that you're working with, you will typically keep morale a lot higher. You'll reduce the friction, you know, and and both parties truly need to trust each other. When we're in a relationship with a sales team and they don't trust our ability to fill their calendars, they won't perpetually hire and therefore we won't be able to

perpetually scale. Sales teams typically take like three to four weeks to hire somebody, get them onto the calendars, and then give me the opportunity to book into those additional calendar slots to make more money for the organization and therefore make more money for ourselves and the sales team, too. If they just perpetually trusted us with their capacity to fill up the calendars every

time they hire a new rep, we we'd have a consistent scaling process rather than like an every other month scaling process. So simply put, if your sales and marketing team don't trust each other, you could be limited to scaling only six times a year, assuming that you only get to scale every other month, you know, it it really slows everything down when there's a lot of friction between

those two those two departments. You know what I mean? &gt;&gt; Absolutely. And this is the thing, right? Most marketers have never done sales, so they don't actually understand it. Like that's the problem, right? Like they've never I started cold calling, my first job out of like college at uni.

Loved it. loved it. and then did like telco sales, agency sales, whatever. But you don't actually understand what it's like most marketers to have to take a call and then they kind of belittle the sales team. And often the sales team, and I can say it, are dumb and they can't actually give you the feedback. We just brought on a client doing 600K a month. You will love

this. Show up rate 48%, close rate 11%. Like bananas. No good, right? &gt;&gt; But we put all the sales calls through. &gt;&gt; Yeah. like bad bad bad and you change one number in the economics just fix the show up rate and you've added millions of dollars and um so like we were doing our thing with all of the sales calls through AI and literally you can just build an AI prompt sales manager and it

tell tells us straight away your closes are presenting price before they're sold um these leads are not educated and they're like blah blah blah and it's like here's your problem I figured it out in like an hour now let's go and fix it right and build those feedback loops &gt;&gt; what's been your um your favorite campaign or client you've ever worked on?

&gt;&gt; Yeah, great. Dude, I've had a whole bunch, but the there's um there's so many highlevel deals that we've done over the years, but time and time and time again, like arguably my most favorite that I've ever done. I always when people sneeze, I say, "Ty, bless you." You know, it's it's got to be Tai Lopez for sure. There's just there's just too many highlevel lessons that

I've learned wa watching Tai up close over the years. And and it's very interesting how Tai just does deals in general. Like Tai probably has like I don't know 40 marketers at the same time. And uh he he does in most instances like these 90-day deals with people where he'll have them come in for whatever their specific role and function is in his life and business.

And his uh even just his testing strategy alone is it's like remarkable. You know, like I'll give you a great example. Like there was this there was this program that he sold over 400,000 people into. And at that time it was like a lesson of Amazon. He had I don't know 50 different prices for the thing at the same time or like I think he whittleled it down to somewhere in the

30s for the total different price points that were being split test across the board. And &gt;&gt; I just remember thinking I was like, how the are you like why like why I've never seen anybody else more do more than like a basic split test at the same time, you know, &gt;&gt; and the the way that he operates just the uh just the other day it was um

&gt;&gt; I think it was May it was either May or April. Um I'd gone out there to uh to Beverly Hills. I had a wedding I needed to go to and Tai was in town at the time and he was like, "Oh, come over to the new place." And it was like a block over from where he had previously lived and he had this like massive out of respect for the place, it was an actual mansion, you know? It was huge. And I

showed up and there was like nothing in the house other than just desks. It was in the like smack middle of the Beverly Hills flats. And the entire home besides the master room that had a bed and like a traditional closet that he was showing me had like all these books laid on the floor in the master room, but you the rest of the literal entire house was just a work environment for all these

people that he had physically located in Los Angeles. And simply put, nobody's operated at the consistency of scale that Tai has with like how he chooses to operate and and like the polarity that he has in his life. at the same time.

The following month, I had then gone to his farm out in Virginia. And when I showed up to that place, it's like meeting a completely different person. It was hilarious. Like, this is like a family home. He had like his kids height written on the wall. Like his mom lived in the back at one of the other houses on the property. We went into like a three-hour tour and like a farm dog

running around with us chasing deer, you know, and he's like still himself at the core, but it's also it's just extreme polarities and and such a high level of operation and just getting to witness it up close has been the most hands down the most unique deal that I've learned the most from over the years for sure.

&gt;&gt; Just nobody does it like Tai, you know. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And he's one of the OGs that still operate today, right? like a lot of people have come and gone in the DR space and he's one of the ones that are still, you know, and even all the people that hate him. I'm sure they've never actually done one of his courses.

They've just read some Reddit threads of other people who have &gt;&gt; never done their course his courses, right? &gt;&gt; It's a great lesson. It's a great lesson of the propaganda spectrum, which which to your point, like I I I had an old boss that used to say half the country has to hate you to be the president. And it's so true. Like when you reach like a

high level on the spectrum of human awareness, like all you're really doing is just having people generate opinions of you on the fly. And the more awareness that you have, the more attention that you have, typically the better off you are and the better off you end up nowadays. There's all kinds of terrible people that are like actually terrible people that have

gotten a tremendous amount of attention and they launch like an OAF, you know, or then they launch like, you know, some some like crazy product to just money grab and they still make tens of millions of dollars. A a great example of this, this is actually a girl that I met through Tai Tai I' gone over to Tai's house in in Beverly Hills back, I think it was like 20 2017 was this time

frame or maybe 2018 and he had that cash me outside girl that was on Dr. Phil and &gt;&gt; Bad Bobby. &gt;&gt; Yeah, she was she was in his garage uh on the on the uh Orange Aventador at the time like with a wad of cash and I was like what the you doing? Who's why is she here? And he was like I'm just filming an ad with her you know and anyway that girl went on and you know

she has an example launched in OF and she did like what 50s something million dollars and it goes to show like she didn't get attention in like a great way. She got attention on Dr. Phil essentially threatened to beat people up and, you know, acting a little ghetto.

And again, my point being is is uh it's a great thing. And Ty Ty Tai's a great example of that. There's a there's a book that I believe you referenced when I when I've talked to him about that over the years, and it's called The Courage to Be Disliked. It was a phenomenal book, by the way. It's it's it's a great read, a very unique book, too.

&gt;&gt; But yeah, anyway, look, anybody who wants to operate at a serious scale in life, he's also a great example of that in the sense that you're gonna deal with that kind of stuff. like you're naturally going to get more of everything as you continue to scale. And the quantity of people that you have on that side of the spectrum that just absolutely hate hate you is honestly a

direct reflection of the exact opposite, which is imagine the quantity of people that are just diehard Thai people just like me is a great example right now sitting here yapping about them in a positive light. There's there's a lot of people just like me. And then the most important thing is there's a huge unsold demographic in the middle that through the constant awareness that they have

and you know one data one data point another data point another data point coming their way they they grow into either the sold or the unsold demographic as time continues to pass.

&gt;&gt; It's um there's just so many lessons simply put in that deal. It's it's definitely one of my favorites. &gt;&gt; No, it's really cool. It's luckily I've fully brainwashed myself on Dan Kennedy so I don't give a when people &gt;&gt; say something. I I get worried if I put out marketing and there's no hate. I'm like, "Oh, I've I've been like lame. I'm being lame." Like, "I haven't

put out something anywhere good." But I think it's such a mindset thing that I see with so many of my clients and I think it's what holds you back, right? because they're too scared of being disliked and then because all of their like status or their their identity comes externally and it's this like mindset thing that you have to crush cuz if your self-worth comes externally it's

very very hard to grow and I've seen it I've worked with like a thousand clients the ones that get past it they they know who they are which I assume Tai does and he just doesn't give a fk cuz he's printing cash and helping the right people and that mindset isn't isn't holding them back. Is there anything else?

&gt;&gt; They're great opportunities, you know, that whenever I'll give you a great example like I I have a bunch of nice cars and I'll occasionally get some that comments something like, oh, like you don't own those cars like, "Oh, they're just rentals." And it g it gives such a an awesome opportunity just to hard flex and take the unsold middle &gt;&gt; and sell them. And it's it's done in so

many different ways. One of my one of my other favorite deals to reference for that specific point, we have this guy's name is Tom Cruz. Not the not the celebrity Tom Cruz. I mean, technically Tom, to be fair, is like a definitely very well-known guy though. He's a he's a section 8 guy, Tom Cruz. And I love if you go to Tom's profile and you just look at his content, he he is one of the

best people at this and he does it at an extremely frequent rate. I'll give you one of his most hated examples. So Tom will occasionally pepper in what he calls luxury amenities when he talks about section 8 rentals. And you might not know what section 8 is since you're from Australia. Section 8 is just a government subsidized uh uh lower income housing solution. So simply put, if

you're below a certain income threshold, you can apply with the government. They'll pay for your housing to up to 100% of it. And therefore, long story short, Tom will market that he wants to buy houses that fit &gt;&gt; these types of tenants and he wants the government to give him money in order to house these tenants and then it becomes guaranteed rental income paid by the

government, which arguably is the most consistent form of income that you're going to generate unless the government got shut down or something. Long story short, government's typically a little more reliable than tenants is the moral of the story for his main hook. Now Tom again he'll mark he'll market these things he calls them luxury amenities.

So he he'll be like the core things that a section 8 tenant house needs are blank. And what we'll do is if somebody wants these things that don't have to be added into a house. We'll literally rent them to the person on a month-by-month basis. These are things like a ceiling fan. Like he'll call it a luxury amenity and then he'll add like $40 of rent that the person would pay since the

government wouldn't pay it. And I again I don't know the exact list of things but like the ceiling fan is one of the things that I remember like clear I think he rents like screen doors as an example as another luxury amenity. And obviously people get ravagely pissed when they hear that. They're like they're like oh dude you're like a slum lord. And every single hate

comment that Tom ever gets, he'll make a baller response video where he's got like his I think out of respect to Tom, he just upgraded to an $8 million yacht, but at the time of most of these videos was a $5 million yacht or he's standing on like his $20 million house or Tom's got like I have nice car like four nice cars. Tom's got like 12 nice cars, you know? And anyway, moral of the

story is he'll take every single possible hate comment that he gets and he'll make these response videos which just promote his stuff and get more people in the unsold middle to become sold on him just by using all of these examples. So like moral of the story is Ty does this really well. That's why I bring up Tom as an example because like Tai great videos online that you can

look at that are more long form. He'll debate his haters and he'll simply put like there's always going to be that demographic that's unsold. But through debating a hater and like allowing somebody who has an actual criticism of what he's talking about, what he does to retort in real time, it's always so easy to overcome the people who just have these, you know, silly thoughts like,

"Oh, every every course seller is a scam, you know, or like, oh, you're scamming." It's like it's so easy to respond to these kinds of things and they're just layup they're layup deals in terms of the content opportunities that they provide. So, not only quote unquote like do you get to know yourself more and become more certain and more confident, they're

truly some of the best marketing opportunities cuz like what we would do for Tom as an example, we would take some of those hate videos, we would run them as ads and they were some of the highest link click-through rate ads that we've ever had for them. They they've done so well time and time again. And they also generate a huge polarity of comments from people who are obviously

talking poorly about it, talking highly and enthusiastic and excited about it and then are more just like neutral and in the middle ground. It's so good. It's such a good strategy when you use it from from a marketing perspective.

&gt;&gt; Yeah, I love that. I haven't actually done that before. hate ads, but I'm going to run that with a couple of clients. So, good &gt;&gt; cuz I &gt;&gt; Yeah, I know you you talk about this as well, like le like leaning into the objections or the thoughts someone's going to have anyway, right? Like trying to overcome them and showing how many

refund requests or whatever you get in the back end because as you say, people are just looking to see how much they can get And I think gone of the days where you know like whatever 5 10 years ago or more the glory days of direct response or brand response or marketing where you could be like look at all this dream outcome and here we are every single market I work in now is

just just skeptical and they've been burnt by something. Everyone's been buying online for a long time. So what are some other ways that you like besides like leaning into the the hate ads? What are some other ways that people can like overcome this friction before it even comes into somebody's brain?

&gt;&gt; Yeah, so we we call it back-end selling systems. So how we typically articulate this is on the front end people are in scanner mode. So generally generally every human from an evolutionary psychology perspective believes in energy conservation. Like historically we didn't have infinite calories available to us which essentially is infinite energy. We didn't we didn't

have that kind of stuff available to us. We had to go hunt. We had to go gather. We had to accumulate calories. And then we had to be rather conservative with our energy in order to avoid expensing it and having to go out there and risk our lives to gather and hunt. And the moral of the story is like those that same exact evolutionary behavior pattern carries through to modern times. Okay?

And so think about it like this. When somebody's in market and they're considering something or even lower on the interest spectrum than that, somebody's being convinced to potentially buy something, you you have to consider that the main the main objective that they have in their brain is scan for what's potentially a good solution and what's a bad solution. I

just got a new event venue for for our mastermind group for the inner circle and I was dealing with all kinds of contractors like every every type of vendor and contractor you could fathom that you would need at a commercial facility and then some. And one of the ones I needed today was an IT company to come in and run some cat 6 cable for this big 220inch 4K screen that we got

for the presentations. And I needed to just call some IT people. So, I go on Google, I type in IT companies Miami, and all I'm in is just scanner mode. I click the first company. They clearly were bought by private equity. They try to fish every piece of information they possibly can for me. Mainly just not not even things like, "Hey, what are you calling for? Like, what are you what are

you attempting to solve? You know, what's your problem?" They just tried to collect personal information straight away. Then they put me on hold acting like they were potentially going to connect me to somebody. They came back and were like, "Oh, I'm sorry. I couldn't find anybody." And then they just attempted to fish for more information. Hung up. That wasn't for

me. I'm in scanner mode. But I've got like 10 other option. I call company two, no answer. I call company three, no answer. I call company four. This one was called like it of USA or something like that. And they answer the phone.

Guy just goes, "Hello." And I was like, "Oh yeah, this is probably my guy right here." And I go, "Um, hey man, like this is my specific situation. This is like what I'm looking to do. Uh, can can you get somebody out here ASAP?" He's like, "I can have a guy out there in like an hour and a half." I was like, "Perfect.

I'll get somebody to go over there to the uh to the office and uh we'll meet you there and I'm looking to do this ASAP if you can quote me while you're there and I pay for it. Like when can you do it? He's like we can get it done like Thursday, Friday. I was like money.

I send over my fiance to go over to the venue. She opens up the office, you know, guy comes in, take like 30 minutes to quot us like two grand to get all this done that we needed. And they look professional. They look presentable. They did everything that they needed to do. But now here's the thing, okay? On the front end, I'm in scanner mode. Now, as soon as I actually

get the guy to say like, "Yeah, I'm going to come there and I'm gonna I'm gonna do the quote like we're ready." Only then did I click to the guy's website. Okay, I didn't even click on the websites of these people. I was just name, phone number, call, name, phone number, call name, phone number, call.

And when I got to the point where I was like, "All right, this guy's going to go." That's when I clicked to the guy's page. That's when I looked him up on socials. That's when I literally consumed. Like, I got to see like all kinds of random projects that he did.

And only then did I really give a about what projects the guy had done. I don't care to go look at the other companies, I just want to call them and see if they're even going to be able to help me first. And then once I actually conclude like, all right, these are my people here. Then I'm going to go, okay, are is this the right people? You know, are these the right guys? Like what do I

need to consume from here? We did the same thing with the sound guy. We dropped 50 grand on the sickest sound system ever. So, like no matter where you're at in the room, you got perfect audio from the speakers on stage and then in between we switched to music for the networking periods. And anyway, long story short, the guy who I who answered the phone, his name was Lord. And Lord

Lord when he when he answered the phone, I could tell straight away did the same thing, you know, like S commercial sound systems Miami and ripped through like three people. He was the third. Soon as soon as he talked to me, I was like, "This is my guy." And then he tells me on the phone, he go he goes, "Hey man, between me, you know, talking to you now and showing up, I'm gonna

send you a few videos. I want you to watch them." And the videos that he sent, I I watched every one of them. The first one was his background uh like airplane hanger of a facility full of speakers and him like talking to all this they do. He he manufactures. He got so fed up with the quality issues from commercial providers and and and consumer providers of

speakers and sound systems that he started manufacturing his own Guy's been in business 48 years. Every major club here in Miami, this guy did the venues for. He also had a few case study videos where he demonstrated like multi-million dollar sound system projects. What do you think that made me feel in terms of confidence about my little 50k deal? I was like, this guy's

gonna it's like it's like a sleeper deal for this guy. He's going to be able to knock it out in like a millisecond. And anyway, again, I don't give a to consume any of that stuff. None of it at all until I get to the point where I'm technically teed up, ready to actually do the deal. And so what a lot of people mis misconrue like you see this most commonly when people

ask that dumbass question in an application. Oh did you consume the entire video before you booked this call? It's like no they don't. They never will. You know because they're in scanner mode on the front end. Okay. They're just scanning to see is this right for me? Is it not right for me? And it's because it's rooted in this perspective of energy conservation.

Right? It's just energy conservation. Everybody innately has it in them. Everybody does it regardless of your awareness as to whether they do it or not. Everybody does it. So from that perspective, the most important thing to do is put all of the information you actually want people to consume on the back end. That's why I call it back-end selling systems. And we

don't know which specific consumable is the preference of that individual. And so we do four of them specifically. We we write it on the confirmation page. We throw a whole set of best practices at them from breakout videos like the one you referenced as an example, just showing refund rates and dispute rates and like ho how many people have done business with you, how long you've been

in business, and you know, just how many deals you've done and the size of the deals. And to your point, like most people just emphasize the best testimonials they can cherrypick, which isn't even compliant, which a huge thing for literally every deal we do. They all give a about the FTC because they all make a ton of money and and they rightfully so they should. The the moral

of the story is we don't pick just the best testimonials. We pick like we actually try to get people who refund, who dispute to make a video and explain like, "Hey, can you articulate to people why this why this didn't work for you?" And it's a-okay to say whatever you want to say about your experience with us and we'll throw that kind of on a page. And then it

gives people the full spectrum in addition to a bunch of other best practices, of course. And that that's one of them. We do this thing, we call it the hammer them strategy. And so we take short form content, we take long form content, and we take very specific types of of short form and long form content. And in between the time that they do something like book a call in in

the context of a callunnel, but you could do it for webinars before they show up to the web, you could do it for DM ads throughout the duration of the sales process. You could do it for low ticket to high ticket throughout the duration of the sales process and and all kinds of other random funnels. The uh the moral of the story is we'll get a frequency target where we try to put

like let's just say 20 pieces of content in front of a person in that tight time frame and just hammer the out of them with key pieces of information because again we here's the thing like you don't technically know what piece of information might be the one that gets that person to say I I this is my guy right here like I trust you I want to do the deal with you like but here's what

we do know we need to transfer certainty that we can help produce the outcomes they want and we need to articulate that we understand the outcomes they want and we need to give them that certainty and that certainty comes in many different shapes, forms and sizes. So, okay.

Anyway, third thing, value dense email sequences rather than doing the annoying like, hey, you got a call showing up uh make videos at this time and we we we pepper that in to be clear, but we mainly emphasize taking again the information that we actually want people to know that we believe is going to heavily influence the sales process and people making it a

priority. That's the underlying intent. The reason people don't people don't show up, the reason that people show up and treat it like an education call instead of a sales call, the reason people have super long drawn out sales processes is because, simply put, they don't give a enough to do the deal right now. They have a lot of other things that they're prioritizing doing

instead. And as a result of that specific issue, your intention with this back-end selling system is the right information leads to action. The wrong information or no information leads to inaction. And so the goal simply put becomes let me attempt in all these different forms to reach this person with the right information. And by reaching them with that information, I

have a dramatically higher probability to get higher show. I had a guy just this morning, his name is Cole. Cole says I I'll literally read it to you. See? So So I say it word for word. He went he went from a 40% show rate to a 80% show rate. He goes he goes show rate from 40 to 80% with these backend selling systems. nuts. And I asked him, I was like, "Which specific

back-end selling systems did you do?" His his that had the most impact were the hammer them. He he said quote unquote, "I barely did the confirmation page best practices and then I did value dense email sequences." So for him it was mainly the hammer them and the value dense email sequences. We've had other people we've taught the backend selling systems too where they typically do it

in phases like rarely do you just do it all at once. We had a guy well we actually a handful of people do this because the confirmation page is relatively easier to do. It doesn't take as much effort. So again, from an energy energy conservation perspective, you'll usually bias towards the easier things.

So he he does the um he does a confirmation page best practices, throws some breakout videos on there. It's like five six videos and bam, 32% lift in show rate, you know. So so again, it does it doesn't take all of them to get the impact, but we do all of them. So we ensure with a high probability we get the impact. And then the last of which beyond the value dense email sequences

is just what we call SDR best practices. So setter best practices or you can have your closers do this. We believe that the salespeople have a specialized skill in this case, which is personalized outreach, personalized communication. It feels way better when you have a rep that you just got assigned to you. Take the time to actually read your application and look at it and say, "Out

of all the things that I could send this person, these are the things that make the most sense." And it's easy to systematize this by having the business manager, the business owner, the sales manager, whoever you want to have do it that's knowledgeable of all the content that they could send, organize things based on some of the most common patterns that come through applications.

And you could easily, especially in the age of AI nowadays with LLMs, you could take every application you literally ever have had and and feed all of that and say, "Find me the patterns. Uh, just tell me what are the most common pain points. Tell me what are the most common reasons that people are coming through our application and and having willingness to buy. And then again, you

could you could even take that a step further to be clear and with every application have it go through AI, have AI summarize in a natural language and just say this is what this person's most probable to care about. And it just serves the list of the content up to the setter to be able to reach out with. And from there, the setter or the closer, whoever does it, there's just all kinds

of little things. But like an example, you do you do selfie videos, all kinds of other stuff. But main thing being you want to sound like a person. You know, you don't want to sound like a robot. You don't want to sound like it's automated. You want to reach out and and say, "I looked at your application and I saw that there's XYZ that you care about. Out of all the

things that we have, we have a ton of that you could obviously go through. These specific things I've picked for you are going to make the most difference and help you understand whether we're the right fit or not for you. And they'll help you with your problem, too. it'll give you value either way because again preall consumption is what leads to a higher

probability of the call being a sales call instead of an education call. All of this and and really every other content ad strategy I've ever conceptualized, you know, well beyond the hammer them. We we we've been doing content ad strategies for more than a decade now. And long story short, they're all intended to replicate the organic sales process via paid ads. And

so time and time again, what we see is the consumption that happens organically obviously serves up super hot layup deals on calendars all day. And to replicate that with paid leads, we have to be able to instead of trying to get the same amount of consumption to occur, we have to be able to strategically get the right consumption to occur with the information to prioritization and

action. And so you you might have a few iterations, you might hit it on the nose straight away, but that's that's a huge variable for us, you know, to answer your original question that makes all the difference for them. Does that does that make sense?

&gt;&gt; Yeah, it makes sense. It's um it's similar to like what we do, right? But no one thinks about all of these touch points and how you can leverage each one of these things and no one thinks about how the sales starts in the marketing.

Going back to what you were speaking about earlier, it's one system, right? Like we're not the goal is not leads. the goal is qualified leads who turn into buyers. And so often times sales teams are complaining about quality of leads. Sometimes it's fair, sometimes they're lazy and they're just wanting more YouTube leads, right? But like to underline some of the things

&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. They're like, "Oh my YouTube like, yeah, no son." Like they just they probably watch like a 100 hours of stuff. Like they've been brainwashed adequately. But as you're saying, well, cool. If we know that, how do we replicate that essence into paid ads? And there's so many people out there like suff like just dealing with leads from Facebook and trying to

scale scale them on volume instead of trying to scale on quality. And that's what I see with a lot of people and it usually comes back to because they don't understand their customer enough or who's going to buy, right? So they don't know what they've tried before. They don't know what conversation's going on.

They don't know what question is like going on in their brain. So they're not even talking on their frequency. they're just talking at them and then wondering why like nothing works.

&gt;&gt; Yeah. No, it's that's very true. Sales people very commonly will give, you know, a huge comparison bias to the organic leads and and it makes them fail with the paid leads and they need their own systems too from a sales training perspective, which is a huge emphasis that we teach as well are all the best practices as it relates to overcoming that comparison bias and enabling them

to, you know, be able to think, okay, these are these are different, you know, I need to treat them different. I need to have different processes. I need I need to have different systems. And to be fair, you know, in some instances, the organizations that we work with, they'll just have split teams. They'll have one team that specifically deals with the organic leads, and then they

have another team that's just killers. Just it's just just a bunch of hitters that are specifically teed up to close the paid advertising deals because the comparison bias can be very cannibalistic to your probabilities to be able to scale paid advertising system. Um, if you have that level of comparison bias existing inside of your sales people, you know, it can ruin

deals for sure. It's it's ruined a lot of great deals for us. And the other the other very important thing to point out is, you know, over the years, we've had a natural bias to get deeply involved in every everything and anything that's going to hold back revenue because of how we structure our deals on the agency side. We just do we do net profit shares. And so, as a result of that, any

singular thing, which you know, really the biggest singular thing is the sales team. uh when that's interfered with my ability to get, you know, the rev shares that I'm after and hit our income goals, um I got to move anything and everything out of the way in order for that revenue to float. And to your point, that's that's been, you know, a lot of the origination behind most most of these

specific ideas we talked about here today has just been okay, instead of just being full of rage and trying to project anger on the sales team and, you know, putting my finger of blame and saying, "Hey, it's your fault. You guys suck." Um, if I if I had to work with just a bunch of monkeys, you know, a bunch of cashiers that I needed to get layup deals for and that's all they

could ever close, well, what what would I do in order for that to be the case? And that specific line of questioning has led me to, you know, some some very prolific advertising and marketing strategies and systems and and also sales tips and sales strategies that have made a a world of difference in in in the revenue that we've seen for our deals and a lot of people that have

worked with us worked with us over the years. when when you're creating the lead genen offer, so like the thing that somebody's signing up for to become a lead, right?

Because we got to get a lead before we get a sale. How do you think about that? And how much effort do you put into that? &gt;&gt; Great question. Are we are in this in this hypothetical, are we selling to the general public or are we selling to rich people?

&gt;&gt; Let's sell to rich people because the general public's annoying. Let's focus on rich people. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Hell yeah. So, so long story short, anytime you sell to rich people, it's a very direct, &gt;&gt; straightforward, low friction process.

In most instances, the friction generally comes from application questions, the quantity of application questions, the types of application questions.

&gt;&gt; Um, but to be clear, we generally, as an example, for a callunnel, like we don't we don't even use opt-ins. We are very clear in our messaging about what it is that we can do, what the outcomes are that we can help people with. We try to be simply put, as direct as we possibly can. Most Most people virtue signal about a tremendous amount of things.

They aren't actually honest with the true intentions to others, let alone themselves and and eventually they believe their own lies and and at the end of the day we all operate on these very, you know, super base level reasons to do things and they are truly not as sophisticated or complex as what most people will virtue signal and attempt to articulate them as. So, so a great

example of this is like rich people are generally very transactional people, right? They prefer to have very efficient deals with outcomes that don't have to involve a lot of time and effort to produce those outcomes. And they'd rather throw money in order to generate outcomes and again not have that much involvement of their time and effort.

And from that perspective, coupled with that evolutionary psychology idea of, you know, we're all in energy conservation, rich people take it to the max. So, as a result of that, like we can have ads that do a majority of the selling, still see a low play rate on a BSL on a callunnel as an example, and get very qualified people through the door that show up, consume back-end

selling systems after they're out of scanner mode and close with high rates, uh, a lot of pips, short sales cycles, high show rates, and a lot of it has to do with just the best practices. Like I have a whole playlist on my YouTube channel dedicated to offers for rich people, selling to rich people, advertising for rich people. Like I I talk about literally all of it. And the

moral of the story is we we typically simply put will do very like transactionoriented communication, very direct communication, very like short efficient ways to consume the information. And from there, we push people to the action, which in this case would be filling out an application, you know, raising your hand and showing that you're qualified. And you know, some of

the simple things. I don't know if you ever you've ever seen this or not. I don't know if this meme has reached you yet. It's uh it's the meme from Englorious Bastards, which which is a movie about some American soldiers that were in Germany during World War II, and they were Nazi hunting. Okay. And long story short, the Americans at one point in the movie had penetrated like a

German gala uh like like some kind of event that they were having. And this is a bunch of German shoulders. And and again, the Americans were pretending to be German. And one of the Germans, they suspected one of the Americans of of being an American. And so the German soldier asked the American guy goes, "Hold how many of" and and the answer was three. He's like, "How many of this

are there?" And the and the American guy holds up the number three like this. And I don't know how you hold up the number three in Australia, but like apparently Germans don't hold it up like this. So long story short, when the American soldier held it up like this, the German immediately knew. He was like, "You're not a German." Okay. And there's simply put so many individual things that rich

people will look at like that where I'll give you a great example like rich people we don't use the word money &gt;&gt; we rarely use the word cash it's like we have like fancy words for it like liquidity capital dry powder you know and just as a simple thing it's like when you articulate just those words when you're talking about cash instead of actually saying cash and you use

liquidity you know uh uh capital, you know, and you use these different terms, you're signaling to them that like you actually understand them and that you're one of them. There's all kinds of these little like subconscious things that can trigger somebody to be like, "Oh, you know, you're well, you're not you're you're not what you're pretending to be." And vice versa though, if you do

get them all right, there's a very very high response rate from these people that we see. So, as an example, like we we can get people like that, like I'll give you a perfect one that's like this.

If if you ask what's your annual income, you know, it's like they're not gonna tell you your annual income, you know? It's like this it's such a silly question, you know what I mean? It doesn't signal to them that you actually understand. Like they're not going to tell you that. And you we've done polls uh as an example like in my inner circle group where which is just all rich

people. They all make a minimum of 100K. We got 24 guys in there that do more than a mill a month. The average in there is like three 300 to almost 400k a month now. So, you got a lot of people that are that are in the high $100,000 range now that join in. And I asked them in a poll, I was like, if I asked this type of question in an application, like with your income range, how many of you

would tell the truth? How many of you would lie? And 60% of them said, I would lie. You know, and that's the moral of the story. So, we have to get we have to get the right data through the application from a pixel conditioning perspective to be able to send it back to the ad platform and have it help buy us towards more of the right people that we reach. But messaging, have you have

you heard about uh Meta's update? They they technically announced this in late April. It's called Andromeda. It was it was you can look it up on their on their newsroom. Meta Andromeda. And long story short, it was it was something that I believe in April didn't technically roll out. I actually think it rolled out this month in particular in July while we sit here and talk about this. Long story

short, um I think they fully rolled it out now. And it just talks about they they mentioned creative diversification and the need to have a lot of different they called them themes aka environments messaging which obviously relates to hooks and just what you're communicating in general. And then the um they said something else like just like the way you're dressed and like you know the the

character essentially. Moral of the story is they then plug a like kind of testimonial is what you could call it, like a quote from a guy who ran an e-commerce company. And the quote was something along the lines of like we were scaling. We were only at like three to four creatives a week and we went to 50 creatives a week and like that gave us the consistency that we needed as we

scaled aggressively because like they'll never just straight up say as I'm sure you're aware of course and everybody else watching this oh this is exactly what you need to do. you know, they do these like roundabout things to imply what we do without without saying it directly. But again, my point is indirect communication &gt;&gt; for like inferring and saying the right

things is a huge part of being able to communicate to rich people effectively because most rich people don't actively just sit there and signal all day through obvious things. They use inobvious things to signal to one another. And and they do care about status. They do care about signaling.

They do care about letting other people know who are at the same level as them that they're on that key level, right? And they do that strategically because networking has a huge advantage to the amount of revenue that everybody can produce and just our overall value that we can produce from life. Point being, okay, you have to have the right systems and you have to have the right funnels

that are geared towards the ideal demographic you're attempting to convert. So, like webinars still work with rich people, but like you better understand what how to actually execute a webinar for rich people, &gt;&gt; okay? Because they are not the secrets, you know? They're not like you using a bunch of fluff and framing tactics for 30 minutes of a

three-hour presentation. It's like, no, they it's very different. It's very matterof fact and direct and like, you know, you have to actually sell the narrative a lot more. There's there's all kinds of best practices. Even with low ticket to high ticket ascension, it's like that can be a great funnel for a rich demographic, too. But imagine like I was in a room the other day at

this uh this mastermind that one of my clients had invited me to go speak at and the client had sold all these people into the room at $35,000 a piece. And I asked them all a simple question. I was like, there were two people in the room doing $100 million as an example. By the way, one of them was selling cow feed &gt;&gt; to to cattle farm &gt;&gt; and one of them was logistics just just

in case you're wondering if we're doing the right thing or not. And anyway, he she um she you know, she she introduces me to the room and and then she leaves and I was like I was like, "Hey, all you guys spent $35,000. Who here bought something from this client at a lower price before you spent $35,000?" And only one person raised their hand. And I was like, "So that means every single

one of you that are here right now, this was the first thing you've ever bought from this client and it was $35,000." And all of them were like, "Yeah, like this is what just this is what made more sense for me." And I was like, and we had two ways you could have bought this.

We had a challenge funnel and then we had a call funnel. How many How many of you went through and we called it a three-day virtual event. I was like, "How many of you went through the three-day virtual event?" And it was like 20% of them went through that. and the whole other 80% of the room minus one person who bought a low ticket to high ticket ascension product. 80% of

the room is like I bought through a call funnel. And so as an example, it's like what most people also get wrong is they have one specific conversion mechanism that they bias towards that might not be what your ideal demographic bias is towards. I've had plenty of people come to me that are milking like some kind of low ticket to high high ticket product thing and then I tell them I'm like dude

that's going to be a terrible way to convert rich people because typically rich people just buy the higher ticket thing that they feel is more appropriate for them right away. Rich people are biased towards spending more money because they believe that the money is tied to the value in which they're going to get and the outcomes they're probable to produce. They like you know the low

ticket thing's probable to add time and not really get them the outcome they want. just adds friction to the process and there's all kind like opt-ins can add that again low ticket to high ticket can add that uh long drawn out sales processes like some people by default have two call close systems and again that could be another thing that deters the higher ticket more financially

qualified buyer from coming through. So anyway, simply put, when it comes when it comes like just generating a lead, we typically do like a nice diverse like range of funnels that we attempt to get the people we work with to run because they they all have effectiveness, but they all generate different types of buyers. You understand? They all generate different types of leads who

have their own preferences of how they want to purchase from that that entity. Is you understand? &gt;&gt; Yeah. And the the book a core one is usually what we implement for people first cuz there's just people in market like ready to go and they're like can we do this webinar funnel and this low ticket I'm like yeah babe but not yet like there's people who are ready to

give you 20 30k today so let's just get them on on a call and then the way with our funnels we just think of it all as little micro steps right and then usually when we set up our um our lead genen offer it's like it's just ready now or discovery what's like where are they in the stages of awareness Do they need some diagnosis before prescription or do they are they ready to take action

and then that's just how we structure what they get on the call and then all of the the stuff to like beef them up and get pumped to even want to show up, right? Like to build the anticipation and the excitement.

&gt;&gt; Yeah, good idea. That make that makes a ton of sense. There there's also a huge difference in the math of what it takes to get a webinar funnel tested and successful comparatively to a call funnel. Like when you just do basic financial modeling and you look at the amount you can spend on a call funnel to see success with it and it's it's a it's a little more relenting to be fair. It

can be a little more it can be a little more easy on your on your wallet. Um webinars is an example like you might have to spend a minimum of like 15 to $25,000 per webinar on a test budget to get the right quantity of people to opt in show up you know convert on a on a call booking show up to the call close.

You know, the moral of the story is a lot more steps and a lot more dollars that you have to risk. And then on top of that, you have a lot depending on the frequency in which you do the webinars, you have a lot fewer iteration cycles to become successful with it. As even if you commit to a weekly webinar, you get four iteration cycles in a month. If you commit to, let's say, spending $1,000 a

day or $2,000 a day, 30 to 60k budget on a call funnel over the course of a month, well, you get sales calls every day that your sales people take calls. And so you would typically have upwards of let's say at least 20 if they do calls 5 days a week to potentially upwards of 24 to 30 total iteration cycles in which you can improve the process and you also get to spend less

dollars. The the issue is is you know to to to be fair to the people who typically take these types of actions and risks. You know they've probably bought from a handful of agencies that have just been dumpster fire operations churn and burn models terrible at their jobs. And as a result of that, you know, they've tried those same strategies and they chalk it up from a

narrative perspective that they just don't work. And so usually what most people are willing to try comes from some story that they've recently heard from some other guy or girl they look up to that's like, oh well this person just did this, you know, like that's why I want to try it. And so sometimes to be very it's it's important to play into those things because they have some

momentum and enthusiasm with the idea already. But again, from an expectations perspective, that's the most critical thing from a math view that has to be settled in order to determine more so than anything else like what you actually do. We we we had a client who was like, I love webinars. I'm way better at webinars and I'd rather do webinars than call funnels. We we showed

the guy the math. We were like, you have to spend $25,400 with like a worst case scenario set of statistics, which which ended up being true.

&gt;&gt; And moral of the story, the guy was like, I'm happy to spend 100K a month on a test budget. And then we said we say that to other people and they're like I wouldn't spend more than 30 and it's like all right well yeah webinar makes no sense then you know let's do and then also it's important to know you got to look at what's working for them already from other places like the organic

channels. So if we see that somebody works really well with DM ads as an example for their uh for their Instagram pages where they're just telling people to comment a word or like know setters are interacting with all the followers and interaction and trying to teamm up in DMs for set calls. We'll play into that too. We'll just run DM ads instead of doing anything else. we we typically

play play into whatever is currently working because that dramatically increases the probability that they gain, you know, some profit to be able to gamble with. You know, they they need some house money to be able to test some of these other ideas that might be able to work too. That's increased our retention rate and success rate a tremendous amount and it and it also

works really well across everybody that we help uh in the education company side of things too. It's been great. Just playing your strengths, simply put, &gt;&gt; and making sure the math is mapping, right? And especially if you deal with clients as an agency, we we're predominantly profit share or like scaling ads. So we're like a percentage of the ad scale depending on what's the

best way to structure the deal for us and the client. But at least our incentives are aligned and like what you said earlier, I want the sales team to be successful because if they're not going to add more sales team, then I can't scale the ad budget and that's going to be my friction to scale the the account. And yeah, that's awesome. I know you've got things on today. So

before I let you go, what do you think is the number one dumb thing that people do in their funnels that is costing them millions of dollars and holding them back from scaling to million-dollar months?

laxidasical with how they go about doing their analysis. And I can't stress this enough. they they either do too little math or they nerd out and they do way too much tracking on statistics that don't really make that big of an impact. You have to be aware of what specific we call them bottlenecks or choke points within your advertising, marketing, and sales process that have

actual impact. So, as an example, like CPMs can have a huge impact. Link click-through rate can have a huge impact. If you have an opt-in page, optin rates can have a huge impact. If you're just doing a call funnel, like the application uh uh rate and the drop off points within the application, that can be huge. But typically, if we're just optimizing for book calls, we'll

shoot for a specific KPI for just the total quantity of traffic against the total quantity of qualified book calls we got as the KPI to track show rates, uh close rates, AOV, like these are these are some of the bigger stats that we track. And then typically from like a from like an analysis view, whether it's week over week, month over month, whatever time frame against time frame

you want to compare it to, usually, you know, when you're attempting to increase rorowaz, when you're attempting to to just get overall more revenue out of the system, you have to make sure that you have your eyes on all these different steps throughout the process because inevitably one of them starts to contract and then as it contracts, it holds back the revenue for every

subsequent step that follows because it's just it's choked. and and the higher up the funnel that it's choked, the worse every subsequent stat, it's like compounds into every other statistic that follows it. And when you financially model data and you look at like these statistics that actually make an impact, like some of which I've just described, you can then track and

analyze where you need to laser focus attention to open up that specific contraction and let revenue flow through. Most organizations are extremely reactive. They don't have any insight or visibility onto these specific choke points and they attack like a bunch of random at once that might not even be the key choke point that's throttled. And as a result of

that, they never really make improvements and they give up far too quickly. The other big one is is they don't have the endurance. Like advertising, especially when you're first getting started and attempting to scale up to an aggressive amount of revenue, it's an endurance race. Like you have to walk into the casino with a specific gambling budget that's not

going to financially ruin you. And you have to be able to again endure going to the casino again to try to get into profit and leave with house money. And then from there when you pocket the original money you risked, you have to change the risk profile that you use to behave through once you're gambling with house money instead of money that you're actually pulling out of your pocket. So

again, most organizations like the best ones that we've worked with, they'll they'll be like strong in one place. Like let's say they have one specific funnel that's doing really well organically or something like that or even from paid and they're looking to add a new funnel. There has to be a set amount of profit that gets siphoned off from from that specific source to

subsidize the thing that's not currently profitable. A great example of this in real life is like the NBA and the WNBA. The WNBA has never made a dollar. Like it's never made a dollar of profit ever. it always loses money and it's fully subsidized by the cash cow which is the NBA and in the most recent I think it's been two years now there's a key player named Caitlyn Clark who

when she doesn't play the WNBA loses 50% of its viewership overnight she is the current revenue driver for that entire organization and for the first time like there's been little improvements like instead of the girls having to fly commercial they've been starting to fly on PJs now you know team PJs that's a huge improvement the signals they're starting to get paid more and

they they took be fair to the players, they still actually get paid a pretty mediocre amount. But again, they're working in an organization that makes no money and it's fully subsidized by an organization that's profitable out the ass. So again, my point being the the NBA has kept the WNBA around for what I think now is decades. Okay? It's been it's been multi-dead. And they do

that because it will inevitably become profitable or at least it's probable to eventually become profitable, but it's subsidized by the cash cow. Okay? Now, we don't want to subsidize. No, nobody that I ever talk to wants to subsidize something for decades in order for it to eventually become profitable.

We're looking for like, I don't know, 90 to 120day window, as an example, like a quarter of endurance before, yeah, you probably are up and either need a lot more help than what you anticipated or you just, you know, maybe you do need to give up on that specific way of doing it or maybe just didn't try that hard. There's all kinds of things, but like after a good 90 to 120 days,

which which barely anybody makes it to, most people endure for like 30 days or 60 days and then just be like just I'm not doing this anymore, you know, and they'll stop spending the money. And uh anyway, moral of the story is you got to have a gambling budget. You got to have endurance. You got to actually do math.

You have to with a very high rate concentrate on bottlenecks and contractions to open up profitability because it's genuine. It's genuinely that simple. And simply put, you also can't look at old data. I'll say that too. There's a lot of people who I want to be fair in saying this, some old data still stands up extremely well. Like I referenced the book Breakthrough

Advertising by Eugene Schwarzen, an extremely high rate. That book was written in the 1950s and that's that's an endurance of time right there on those lessons. But like I I see people that still follow webinar uh tactics from like 2015 and 2016 and 2025 2026 and it's like they suck and their webinars are ass and they're and they're using outdated tech stacks and

outdated tactics and and again they're seeing terrible performance. The the main thing that everybody technically knows is is like these platforms change all the time. The way that you do things technically has to change all the time.

You can't just grasp on to dear life for what historically worked. You know, you have to be willing to update to the newest, latest, and greatest in order to truly be able to maximize revenue and results. You know, those those would be the big ones I leave your people with.

&gt;&gt; That's awesome. And um it's just principles versus tactics, right? Breakthrough advertising is legit because it's persuasion and how to think about human psychology. Monkey brains haven't changed. Still good. How to do webinars back in 2011. Tactically, not the same. And so people are building their businesses around these tactics that are not based on on principles. So

we'll conclude your interrogation there. That was awesome and I appreciate you coming on today. It's really cool to meet you and again I love I love your YouTube and I I um we share a client and I saw you on Ryan's channel and I just think you're super smart. So thank you for coming here and being super smart.
