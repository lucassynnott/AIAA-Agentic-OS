We have some clients that run webinars that are at million dollars a month exclusively doing webinars. We have other clients that are at million dollars a month that leverage webinars in a chunk method to get to million-dollar months. Meaning the webinars contribute a couple hundred grand of that and something else like a call funnel or low ticket to high ticket

or whatever else it may be like a challenge funnel are worked in there too. Webinars are awesome. Whether it's the strategy that gets you there or the strategy that helps you get there, they're a fundamental part of million-dollar months when you have some type of high ticket product or service business. And I'm going to go through some of the top lessons of how to get

your webinar launched. In this video, we have an entire video already dedicated on this channel to a lot of very in-depth scaling oriented webinar lessons, but in this particular one, we're going to be talking about getting it off the ground and what to do with it. If you're new to the channel, welcome in. My name is Jeremy Haynes.

All we talk about around here is hitting million-dollar months. We don't make any income claims. We just take lessons from the currently 41 different businesses that we've helped, been there, done that, hand them down to you right here on YouTube. Again, no income claims, just lessons. And if you're already a subscriber, welcome back. It's always a pleasure to have you here. Let's jump in

and try to help you get rich. So, launching a webinar, the first thing that you got to do is some research. Okay. Surprisingly, and this one always shocks me, very few people that actually want to launch webinars go and watch webinars from people who are already crushing it with them. As an example, I won't say the revenue amount that this gentleman makes, but I will

say the gentleman's name. Mr. Tom Cruz, the section 8 legend in the info space, does a webinar on a weekly basis. He typically hosts them on Wednesdays. Tom hates sales people. Almost all of his revenue is driven through his education company from these webinars and in addition to that through some DM sales that the man does. Tom has done webinars now for years. Back when I met Tom in I

think it was like 2020 or 2021. I paid him 500 bucks. Did a call with him. He was teaching me about section 8 at the time on a one-on-one call. I don't know. Got all my questions answered. I felt like the first 30 minutes. I spent the following 30 minutes telling Big Money Tom what to do in order to make some big money with his education business. Took Tom 3 days. turned around, you know,

again, made a made a large sum of cash within that first 30-day window and then every month since has been doing extremely well. However, Tom's strength has always been webinars. So, again, the guy's done them for ongoing now, like four plus years on a weekly basis. What kind of lessons do you think somebody like Tom has learned about webinars, doing them weekly for years in a row

that you might be able to learn from attending one of them? I would imagine a lot. How many other people like Tom out there have you heard make a lot of money from a webinar and yet you've never actually attended their webinar and tried to intentionally show up with a perspective of I'm here to learn. I'm going to watch what this guy does and try to pull some lessons from it. It

doesn't even have to be from your niche. It doesn't have to be something that you directly sell. Doesn't have to be a competitor. Some of the best ways to learn lessons are from things that aren't directly from your niche. Not to negate the fact that learning directly from people that do what you do too helps a lot. But again, taking yourself outside of that frame very beneficial

for the learning process. It really all starts by just going to some webinars. Okay, as shocking as this is, I open up with this point because it's such an undermined tactic. Okay, you might think, "Oh, well, I got this guy or I got this girl that's going to go spend the time doing that shit." But it's like if you're the one that's presenting it, okay? Even if they're the one that's

going to help build the deck for you, as an example, you're the one presenting it, you're the one doing it. You've obviously got to know what you're doing. Webinars are an acquired skill.

Some people are great at group selling, some people aren't. Some people are great at public speaking, some people suck ass at it. It is an acquired skill. Even if you go into it feeling like you're the man and you're going to do great, it's still awesome to learn those little tips. I'll give you a perfect example of one of these little tips. If you're doing a cold webinar,

meaning your traffic source is people who have no idea who you are, okay? And you're selling into that demographic and you've just gone back to back to back to back with a bunch of value dense information that's been extremely helpful for them. And you're officially ready to transition to the point of selling. There's this concept that was introduced by one of the info OG

legends, Mr. Russell Brunson. Russell had said this concept called asking for permission to go into the close. It's an incredible tip and it's so simple to do and it works flawlessly. It's it's amazing when you deploy it. But you wouldn't have any idea about that tactic if you didn't do something as simple as just going and watching or learning from somebody like Russell for how he

executes his webinars. What he'll do is all the value dense information when he gets to the point where he's ready to actually transition to the close, he'll say, "Listen guys, I have a lot that I can do to help you, but some of the stuff I can do to help you, I've put together an offer that's a paid offer, and I'd love the opportunity to officially introduce it to you, talk

about it, and see if it makes sense for you to buy. If it's okay if I transition to talking to you guys about that and giving you the opportunity to get that additional help you need, can you just do me a favor? Can you drop a one in the chat?" Just drop a one in the chat or say yes. just give me permission and transition into this opportunity to help you guys more. And then he'll sit there

and he'll look at the chat and he'll be like, "Yeah, a bunch of ones and yeses. Cool. Okay." And then he'll just start pitching. It's amazing that little bridge. And that's one tip of like dozens I can think of that come from SOPs. Like I have a 72page mastering webinars SOP with frameworks for affluent webinars, frameworks for the general public

webinars, examples of affluent webinars, examples of general public webinars. I have an entire section of that SOP dedicated just to objection handling within the webinar. Okay? Let alone the infinite amount of tips that come to the frequency you should do them, how long they should be, and all the other things that are inside of SOPs like that. My point being, it pays a lot and it

shortens the time frame that it takes to get to the point of profitability when you actually start watching some webinars and you start educating yourself from people who are awesome at webinars and you learn from them. Okay, super pro tip. One of the other things that I want to make really clear, okay, we talked about this in another video that I recently had made where I'm going

over how to launch call funnels. And I had said at the beginning of the video, I was like, "Guys, you got to jump into the trenches and like, you got to get on sales calls. That's where you're going to learn the most valuable information to be able to understand what you need to carry over to the front end and the back end and make closing easier and the lessons you can hand down to your sales

team." It's the same thing here. It's like get in the weeds, okay? Watch some webinars, educate yourself, okay? And remember, it doesn't have to be webinars of direct competitors. It doesn't have to even be webinars from people that are within your niche. It just can be from watching webinars period. Okay? And then educate yourself on the flow. There is a very key. Remember, webinars are a

skill. It's like group selling. Okay? You have to know how that flow works. I just recently did a video inside of my inner circle weekly group call library where I talked about the differences in selling to warm audiences versus the differences in selling to cold audiences. And I'll tell you some tips now as it relates to launching a webinar. Okay? Depending on where you're

at, some of these tips are applicable and some of them you need to pay attention to the latter half of what I'm going to say. If you're somebody that's already got a great organic presence and ideally you're trying to launch an offer via paid advertising, something that you can have some predictability and scale with. And maybe you've even done webinars or some kind of like live

selling before on your organic side of things. That indicates that you have what we call a warm audience. Okay, warm audiences, just to be clear, are these retargetable audiences of like website visitors, your email list, all the social interaction you've got, and on top of that, all the video viewers you've got. And you can add all these different audiences into a little

interest stack where you get the opportunity to target these people via your paid ads. Need I not say the people who already know who you are, who already have some familiarity with you, who already have interactions with you, are going to show up a lot differently comparatively to cold audiences. Okay?

Sometimes we come into a business, they've got a proven offer, like it's already sold well with a warm audience via paid ads, but they really suck at transitioning into cold paid advertising, but they want to figure out a way to do it. There is a big difference in how you execute the webinars for your organic audience, even for your warm paid ad audience. There's

still some subtle differences and comparatively it's like an extremely different end of the spectrum when you talk about cold paid audiences from webinars. People who have no idea who you are. They're interested in your message. They're interested in what you have to talk about, what you can help them with, but they don't give a about you at all. They have no idea who

you are. They don't like you at all. They're judging you critically when they're a cold paid audience. These subtle differences in choosing which one of these types of audiences to initially launch into can really dictate how much house money you're going to acquire right away. So, one thing that I want to make really clear is when you promote a webinar, it's a lumpsum funnel. Okay?

It's not a daily lead flow thing. It's a lumpsum funnel. You are ideally going to get enough people there, enough money out of doing it where you're going to get a nice little spike in revenue. That spike drops off rather dramatically fast. However, you're going to get a spike. You're going to get a big lift in overall return from this. But it's going to all be within a handful of days, like

72 hours, sometimes up to like 5 days tops, and then it just all dies back off. And in almost all instances, especially when you're doing cold paid advertising, warm paid advertising, you're obviously fronting cash, okay?

And you're fronting cash for anywhere from about a week to maybe two weeks out from when the webinar is. and all that fronted cash. Obviously, you're going to risk trying to return and then get into profit all at once on the webinar itself. Therefore, this is a little different. We need to focus on what we call house money due to the risks of the webinar. If you have an organic audience

and you've never done any kind of webinar for them, you've, as an example, scaled with call funnels or low ticket to high ticket or challenge funnels, whatever. Introducing a webinar to your organic audience doesn't have any cost to it besides the time and effort to do it. That's a great way to accumulate some house money and give yourself an opportunity with a a very warmed up

audience that's not going to be as critical of you, that's going to give you a shot if you mess up, that's going to, you know, just kind of bear with you a little bit longer compared to what cold paid audiences are going to be like comparatively. Okay, if you got an organic audience and you've never done a webinar to them, that could be a great place to start. Promote it aggressively

enough to get the right amount of people there. That way, you can accumulate some house money. Okay? Because here's the thing, webinars are just math. That's all they are. You have to have enough people that register for it to factor in a relatively low show rate. Like for cold paid advertising, as an example, you could see anywhere between like a 10 to maybe 15% show rate conservatively.

Even if you do everything right, that just might be what it is for your audience. With an organic audience, on the other hand, not warm paid advertising, but a straightup organic audience, you might get upwards of like a 30 or a 40% show rate. And that's a lot more forgiving comparatively to all the dollars you're going to have to spend on cold paid advertising. Let me

just give you an example of what I'm talking about here. And then I'll tie it back to the house money point with the math. Let's say I get a $20 cost per lead. That's my cost per registrant to the webinar. Let's use the example that I have a 10% show rate and let's say that I'm willing to front like $20,000 for my budget in this example. Okay. I'm going to get a,000 registrants. Okay.

Out of those thousand registrants in that example, if I get a 10% show rate, that's a hundred people who show up. Let's use the example that it's a 90inute webinar. Okay? And let's say that around the 60 minute mark where you're actually going to do your pitch.

Let's say that around that time frame, you have roughly 70% of the people that showed up that are still there during the pitch. So you have 70 people during the pitch. Okay. From here, you have your conversion rate. And depending on what you sell, you're either going to do direct to checkout or you're just going to go to book a call. Almost everybody sitting here on this channel who has

something that costs more than about $5,000, which almost all of you do, I would encourage that you do a book a call rather than a direct to checkout. The things that are more costly above $5,000 just typically don't do as well when you do a direct to checkout. There are a lot of very specific like personal questions that relate to somebody's circumstances and their situation that

dictate whether they do or do not buy. Okay? And although yes, because you're in a group setting and you're live, there's an opportunity for you to get those questions answered for those individuals, not everybody's comfortable saying things in front of others, especially if they think that their competitors are present, which a lot of the times for industry specific

webinars, they're going to be, especially if it's a B2B offer of some kind. My point being, a lot of those types of questions only are going to get answered and asked on a one-on-one call, thus why you push them over to book a call instead. So, let's use the example that I have uh 20% total conversion rate on people booking a call. That's going to be 14 calls. Okay? In that example,

let's say that I average a 50% show rate, just to be conservative. And by the way, it should be higher. Most of the time with the webinar call show rates, you're going to see upwards of like 60s at the lowest, sometimes even all the way into the 80s. But again, conservatively, that means you're going to have seven sales calls, okay? And let's say that you actually close, you

know, 20% of those people or 30% of those people. It's like you risked $20,000. If you're not going to get more money than that risk off of the two to three people that close, it's like you can see your statistics here are not going to be in your favor to do a cold paid advertising webinar. You're going to have to make some adjustments. You might have to, as an example, increase

the price. You might have to just do a better job on the webinar to get a higher conversion rate. You might have to fix specific things. As an example, like if your show rate sucked and only was 50%. You need to do a lot more to beef up the confirmation page and the valuedriven email sequence and the hammer them strategy that you're going to deploy there. Fix your salespeople

too to manually send off some stuff. Try to shorten the window of time that it takes for people to get on the call. You see, there's just like little optimization things that can really you. It's a far greater risk to do a cold paid advertising webinar comparatively to doing it to your organic audience andor your warm paid advertising audience. So anyway, point

I'm trying to make now. Let's go back to that second point I was making with the house money point. Okay, your goal when you first launch a webinar, when you very first get it off the ground, is to get enough profit put into your pocket that you can then turn around and use on the riskier webinars that are far more scalable once you actually figure them out and dial it in. I obviously have

huge limitations on the quantity of webinars I can do and the amount of people I can expect to register for them if I just continuously do it for my organic audience. And it's the same thing for your warm paid advertising audiences. I'm going to be limited on frequency. I'm going to see diminishing returns the more often that I do it. And obviously, if my audience size isn't

growing, the the increased scale for every time I try to do it to my limited audiences, organic and warm, as an example, is obviously going to limit the revenue I can pull from it. So, the goal of those first webinars isn't necessarily to try to like immediately scale into those specific audiences.

hold webinars are the most scalable asset you've got in your webinar arsenal strategy. Okay, but it's not necessarily as an example just based on the math I just articulated to you the most efficient way to launch. It is unrelenting how just intolerable the cold paid a audience is going to be towards you. They're highly judgmental.

They don't have they have a very razor thin tolerance for anything that's not super value dense and actually helpful for them to stick around and justify being there. They just don't give a about you yet. And rightfully so. But I digress. The point I'm trying to make is we're trying to accumulate house money to be able to burn money free and clear on that window of time where we figure

everything out, go through the optimization strategy window and just dial everything in for our most scalable audience we have, which is cold. Okay. So, the goal, and again, this is where most people really get it wrong. They have this finite window of time where they eventually dial everything in. But at the very start of it all, this is when it sucks the most. Here at the very

beginning, right, if I accumulate house money, okay, if here I'm just acquiring as much as I can, I'm then going through a period of time where I'm officially spending some of that money on cold.

Okay, and the cold window, again, unrelenting, not going to be fun. Going to take several webinars to dial it in. going to take a lot of tweaks, a lot of changes, a lot of money, a lot of time, a lot of iterations to eventually get to the point where it's dialed in. And if we look at this like anything below this line represents financial loss and anything above that line represents

financial gain. What happens is is usually you go through a period where you're going to burn. Okay? So, you get a little bit of money at the beginning and then you're ideally not losing a lot before you eventually dial it all in and you get to the point of just straight profitability and scale and and potential seven figure months. You know, you're just punching the up doing

big dog numbers. But to get to that point, usually, okay, there's a small window where I'm officially getting some cash, okay? And then there's that window where I start to lose some money, okay, and I even start to burn a little bit.

Then I do another webinar to try to accumulate a little more house money to one of my more forgiving audiences like my warm paid advertising audience or my organic audience. And then I am on my path to profitability and scale where I've officially used my house money to dial in my cold paid advertising audience which is again going to be the most scalable asset that we have out of

all the three of these audience types by far. Now I want to be really clear when I say this, okay? I brought this up at the beginning before I talked about all this. I said, "Hey, maybe you don't have an organic audience. Maybe you don't have a warm paid advertising audience to use. Maybe you're literally just at the start of this whole thing, okay? And you're unfortunately going to have to go

straight into the cold paid advertising audience and you don't really have a choice otherwise. In that example, your timeline's obviously going to look a little bit different. You, my friend, are going to have a much much more significant duration of time where you're burning money before you it's not going to look that bad. You're you're going to burn some money and then

eventually you're going to get to the point where everything plays out well for you. But that little dip of time, oh boy, is it going to suck. And obviously, you're going to go through more of a financial loss comparatively to the people who can subsidize their losses with house money for more warm audiences. So, keep that in mind. You know, we had a client just recently.

They were launching an offer. It was a $70,000 offer. It was a real estate info product. And this guy does extremely well with events. He does extremely well with anything that's live. He does extremely well with group selling. I mean, this guy's a dog, you know, sharp webinar skills. And we did this exact test budget, and these were pretty much the exact statistics to a degree that we

experienced on these first few webinars. $20,000 per webinar, about a $20 cost per lead, which arguably is pretty high. We get a thousand people registered from paid, very few people contributed to it organically. Um, the guy does really well on the first webinar. He did awesome. He showed up. It was about 90 minutes long. It was towards a very financially qualified, sophisticated

audience. We were profitable on the first webinar. We accumulated about $40,000 minus sales commissions of 20%. It wasn't spectacular, you was maybe tens of like thousands of dollars, maybe almost $10,000 that the guy was able to pocket from this whole risk. But that wasn't the point. The point was, okay, great. Let's prove it out. Let's see if it works. Okay, now let's try it again

and see if it works twice. So the second time around was just an utter failure. Same exact statistics on the front end. $20,000 spent, $20 cost per registration, thousand people registered. Pretty similar show rate, about 15%. So we had 150 people show up live to this one. However, the webinar was like totally different. The guy showed up and just kind of on his own

took this initiative to make a totally different slide deck. Instead of making like just subtle iterations to very specific points in the previous webinar, the guy did something totally different like a brand new webinar. The webinar came out to like 3 hours long which is intolerable to a rich and sophisticated demographic. It just doesn't make sense to do them that long.

Okay, so we all get like really frustrated with this. That webinar had one sale from it. Okay, there was like three people that booked calls in there and like out of all these folks that were there during the pitch. It was just brutal. The guy's energy the entire webinar was way off. Like and he even admitted right away, you know, this wasn't like a shock. He was like, "Yeah,

guys, I completely that up." And that's what can happen in webinars. Like it's a live event. You know, a lot of people they ask questions, oh, can this be automated? You know, is this something I can turn evergreen? I mean to be fair like eventually when you get a really really good webinar sure you could risk that but that's not what you're doing at the beginning at the

beginning of all this when you're launching like you are doing them live remember what I talked about trench level involvement you are in the weeds like you are here to get this thing to work and even that as silly as it sounds to just light $20,000 on fire at the expense of that lesson I'll tell you what that guy never did after that he didn't show up with that deck again

he didn't show up and make dramatic changes to the webinar when one of them just worked relatively well. He made minor iterations moving forward and he made sure to show up in the right energy state. Okay, webinars like your state, how you are when you show up, especially to cold audiences. I mean, it's make or break it with funnels and conversion mechanisms like this. It is uh critical

for you to show up in the right frame. Okay? So, he never made that mistake of showing up like And he also never did a three-hour webinar ever again. He made sure to keep it within 90 minutes for all aspects of what he wanted to cover, including Q&amp;A, the pitch, the content, yada yada. Again, just want to be clear, this guy got to about five webinars in of just risking 20K per

webinar before we finally got to the point where we were like, "Okay, presentation seems dialed in. We're like just above break even on all five of these webinars that we've done so far." And it seems like now the best thing to do is officially scale it up. So instead of on the sixth webinar just spending $20,000 again, we immediately justified spending

$80,000. Okay, so from 20 to 80, everything was dialed in at this point. That is a very important distinction of when you officially cross over into when you start to scale. Okay, it's after you dial it in. It's after the leading indicators, the signs of life officially present themselves to you that you figured out all those little things that otherwise would you if you chose to

scale. You figured out the show rate sequences. You figured out the specific variables that dictate whether somebody shows up in the right frame. You figured out the messaging on the front end to get the right people through the webinar in the first place. You figured out the pitch. You figured out the content. You dialed in everything. Okay? Everything.

And you figured out the backend things like backend show rate, close rate, talk tracks for the sales team to leverage. All of it is good to go. That and only then is when you officially press the gas and scale it up and you take a bigger risk. Now, here's the thing. This guy le as I described he wasn't in a position where he had an organic audience or a warm audience to subsidize

the cost of all those risks that were taken. However, and as ridiculous as it might sound to some of the smaller people on this webinar, those $20,000 risks and even the $80,000 risks, those weren't ruining this guy financially.

They were risks worth taking to figure this thing out. Okay? And that's what I want to make clear. When you talk about house money and you look at the math and you just look at what you have to actually spend to get a webinar to work, this does take a little bit more risk comparatively to something like a daily lead flow funnel. Like these are a lot more risky than call funnels. Believe it

or not, these are a lot more risky than DM strategies, low ticket to high ticket, even challenge funnels. Webinars are pretty high risk comparatively to any other strategy you can run due to the fact that you have to have enough people that register assuming show rates and conservative amount of people there during the pitch, conversion rates throughout the pitch, show rates after

the pitch. Like you got to do the math and assume that you spent enough to actually have the numbers play out in your favor. If you spend too little on a webinar, like let's just say you chip a few grand at this thing and you get like low couple hundred people to show up.

That doesn't mean that your statistics that follow are going to be different than the conservative statistics that I've laid out for you here now. Now, as a matter of fact, you're probably experienced similar statistics. So, my point being, it's like this is a higher risk simply because the dollars required to risk in the first place is just a greater amount to have the numbers play

out in your favor. Do not ignore the financial modeling lesson that I just articulated to you there. If you just make up a number, which you're probable to do anyway, that you feel comfortable with, that's not going to put you in the hole, that makes you feel good, great.

Feel free to do that. But just plug whatever that number is that you make up into a financial model with some of these statistics that I've talked about here. And just make sure it plays out in your favor and that the risk is worth taking. Because if you do that math ahead of time, you'll see clear as day in a very conservative fashion what it could turn out like and whether the risk

is worth taking at all. Whether those dollars might be better spent on a different funnel that you could get into motion. This type of funnel is only worth creating and bringing to life when you have the capital to work with, okay, to bring it to life in the first place and in addition to that to when you have the time to go through the iteration process because this isn't something

that just typically works straight away. There are some people who are all star at presenting, all stars at group selling, and just have done webinars in the past that are like, "Oh, I'm just going to roll this out for one of my new offers that I'm not doing it for now." That's great. You have higher odds comparatively to the guy or girl watching this that has all as

experience for webinars and just hasn't done this before and is going to risk like five grand to try to get it off the ground. Okay? Factor in the skill level of you as an individual into all this.

But either way, don't have a hubris to the fact that you should still be in the weeds to get this whole process started. Now, there's many other tips that I love to talk about when it comes to webinars, but I withhold a lot of that for the people who actually give me money. Okay?

There's links down in the description you can check out for offers like my inner circle program where you got to be making at least 100K a month, ideally much more than that. You're trying to get a lot richer if you join into that group twice a month, one-on-one calls, weekly group calls, quarterly inerson masterminds, a group chat full of rich people trying to get a hell of a lot

richer, the ability to DM me whenever you'd like and I'll answer all your questions just like that. And of course, you get unlimited access to AI Jeremy for voice, video, and messaging functions. We also have our master internet marketing program that you can go through. Seven full weeks, 3 to 5 hours per class, super in-depth information. Each week covers a

different topic. We do live cohorts typically on an annual basis or just when enough changes in marketing to justify doing it. We have the next upcoming cohort in late summertime of this year that we will be doing the fifth cohort for that class. If you join in now, you get access to the fourth cohort, which is still really good current information. There's just some

new things that I need to pepper in here this upcoming summer. Enough's changed to go back and update the class, but still lot of information. You get up to like 27, I think there's like 27 or 28 SOPs that are super in-depth things like my mastering webinars SOP as an example.

72 pages of super in-depth information on things just like this. You can check out the links in the description of this video if you want information on either one of those two offers. And of course, either way, subscribe to the channel. I always appreciate you being here. Go check out some of my other videos that you may have missed. That'll ideally help you on your journey of getting

richer.
