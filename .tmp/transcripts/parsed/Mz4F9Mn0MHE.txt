The power of exclusivity is undeniable when you're scaling up. You can take the path of keeping your prices the exact same the entire time that you're pushing up when you are trying to make more money. Or you can take the path of exclusivity where you have limitations on the offer that allow you to drive up the price through time. All the big businesses out there, mainly high ticket

product businesses do this. There's plenty of high ticket service-based businesses that do this exact same thing. And we have a lot of clients over the years that have leveraged this same tactic, the power of exclusivity when scaling. It's a true honor to be able to break down this topic for you here today as it is a powerful one. If you are new to the channel, my name is Jeremy

Haynes. All we talk about around here is scaling up to milliondoll months. We don't make income claims. We just take all the top lessons from the businesses that we've worked with over the years that we've been there, done that with, and scaled up to these million-doll month levels. There is a 0.1% probability that you ever hit $10 million a year, let alone the big 12

million a year. That represents milliondoll months. So again, no income claims, just simply handing down the lessons of the people that have been there, done that to you right here on YouTube for free. So welcome in if you're new, consider subscribing after you watch this. And of course, if you're already a subscriber, welcome back. It's an absolute pleasure to have you as

always. Without further ado, let's dive in. Okay, the power of exclusivity. Let me just start at the base level for how this works and then we'll work our way up to where you officially get the option and have the leverage to really be able to pull this off. We commonly see this the most inside of call funnels. So, let's use the example that you are going to start the path and

launch your call funnel. Okay, once you officially get a callunnel launched, here's where most people really up right away. they immediately have a bunch of brand new salespeople that they'll dispatch onto the offer, which instantaneously up the odds of being able to gain leverage in the process and speed the game along faster.

Most business owners naturally do not want to be in the trenches and doing sales calls. Yet, they need to do that when they are very first launching a callunnel. And here's why. Unless you have extremely articulate salespeople or unless you're smart enough to be leveraging LLMs and AI to be able to analyze sales calls and turn around and give sales manager level feedback and

insights to you as the business owner to then turn around and tweak front-end messaging to attract more qualified people. You are likely just going to need to jump on the phone and take a handful of calls. The reason being, you have the most liability at the very beginning of the game when you're very first starting off and just launching something. So when you first launch,

that's when you are most exposed to getting and lighting your dollars on fire and never seeing them return. So simply put, either have really good articulate feedback that is messaging based feedback into what is missing, who is coming on the phones and whether the front end is aligning you with the right people on the back end who are actually showing up to these calls. There's all

kinds of leverage in your statistics when you very first get started. As an example, if you have very base level assets in place for back-end selling, you have no confirmation page videos like breakout videos, you have no value dense email sequences, you just have some reminder emails and maybe a reminder text, your sales people aren't even doing anything that would be

considered a best practice when it comes to manual outreach and you still have a remarkably high show rate. My friend, that is a phenomenal sign. That means that you likely have a hot offer andor that you have inarket demographics that you are successfully appealing to on the front end that are coming onto these calls where they need to buy whatever it is that you're selling. Whenever you

first launch, if you have a shitty show rate andor you just get people on the phone who seem very entry level in their frame that they have on the interest spectrum, then you have some change that is going to need to occur to enter the later stages of scaling. Okay, so let me be clear when I say this. The interest spectrum is very simple. It starts off with curious. You then move up to

general interest. From there you have a high level of interest. And from there you have convicted aka sold. Okay. Generally when you get leads that are in the more curious phase, these leads are considered early in the sales process.

Your sales people are going to articulate them as cold. They could be qualified. They very likely will be qualified. But due to their interest being so entry level, it's a very low probability that they're going to show up. And if they do show up, it's a very high probability that they're going to be an education call instead of a sales call, which is going to piss your sales

people off. And with most sales people, you're going to get extremely poor feedback as a result of having interested leads at only a curious level of interest. So to be clear, general interest and of course highly interested, these are generally where you see more of your inmarket audiences at or just your well-framed audiences.

Okay? So when you get these two types of people on the phone, these are going to be considered good. These are going to be people that work through the pipeline that actually close. This is what your marketing ideally appeals to either through a combination of front-end selling tactics and back-end selling tactics. But even then, with the right front-end messaging alone, you can

attract very qualified people through the game. Now, I want to be very direct when I say this. The reason that I encourage that at the base level when you first launch something, you get in the trenches and you figure out like who you're attracting andor you leverage the power of the proper sales management or just AI nowadays to be able to get the necessary feedback to you regardless to

be able to turn around and make change with. You get out of this phase faster, okay? Cuz this phase is where most people fail. This phase specifically is where you have again the highest probability to just light your dollars on fire, incinerate them, and never see them again. Now, once you get to the point where you get some good feedback and you've made the necessary changes on

the front end, you've tweaked the messaging a bit and you've started to see what specifically in terms of pain points, buying motives, just reasons people actually give a to prioritize doing a deal with you. Those are the things that you in turn want to leverage both on the front end to attract those people in the first place and then of course you want to follow

all the back-end selling systems that we encourage you to do here on this channel. Okay. Now you get to the point where you officially start getting good people on the phones. Okay? Once you officially start seeing a consistent amount, this is the key, a consistent amount of good people showing up and booking. Okay? And the main thing, again, I can't stress it enough, is that

it's consistent. It's a majority of the time that this is occurring. This is when the game transitions to phase three extremely quickly. Generally in phase two here with this good people officially start showing up at a high rate. This is when you can actually get some salespeople onto the phones. This is when you can generally start the process of taking yourself off the calls

because you now know from being in the trenches what you need to do to actually train your people to represent the business right way. Close people at a high rate and just overall turn dollars into far more dollars. Okay. This is where you officially get rorowaz positive and this becomes where you start the scaling process. Okay, once you get here, this is when the leverage

starts to build to eventually be able to start deploying exclusivity tactics, but you still don't have enough leverage at this phase to actually be capable of doing this. You've got to get to the point where you have damn near a full pipeline and you're close to being maxed out. That's the key. Once you get close to being maxed out, that is when you officially hold the cards. Okay? That's

when you have the leverage. So, I'll give you a great example of this. In our inner circle program that you consistently see me promoting here on my channel that there's a link for down in the description. There are many pieces of qualification criteria that you must pass for us to even consider letting you in there. Number one, we literally will not let you in if you do not prove to us

that you are making $100,000 a month consistently and in the most recent month. We don't give a at all if you've done $100,000 once in your life and you think that makes it so you qualify. Absolutely not. This is a costly, not expensive, costly offer that we don't want you to blink at when that charge comes along to get yourself in the door into the program. We also need

to know that you have enough dollars to actually be able to go out there and deploy and take risks because a lot of the things that we're going to encourage you to do, not all of them, but a lot of them are going to encourage you to put your nuts on the table, take a financial bet, and try to turn dollars into more dollars. Some of those bets aren't going to work out. Some of them are going to

work out handsomely well. You can't get essentially financially in the process. You got to be comfortable when you're making these bets. Okay? We have 17 current people in there that do more than a million dollars a month. Average member joins in around 2 to 300k a month. We have people do extremely well in there. I won't sit here and make any kind of income claims associated with

what you're going to have as an experience when you join in. However, the people that have joined in have done phenomenal and they've done really well and they've been able to pay for what it costs for the entire year in most instances within the first like 30 to 90 days, give or take the person. Now, outside of just having a minimum amount that you have to make, we also have a

minimum time frame that we need a person to commit to. Generally, every single person who joins into that offer wants to make a huge sum of money. Now, to be clear, we don't guarantee they're going to make that sum of money, and we make that extremely well known. However, we understand the game. We're not dumb.

Okay? you want to turn money into more money and you want our help to do it and that's what we do inside of that program and we do it extremely well. However, it's very important to note that in order for us to help actually achieve a big result that you want and that we want for you too. It takes time. So, we have people commit for a minimum a minimum of one year to be inside of that

offer. So, right away, as you can start to see, if you're not making a certain amount, you're not getting in. If you're making a certain amount, but you don't want to commit for that time, again, you're not getting in. We don't want flakes in the program. So, let me be clear when I say this so you understand why I'm articulating this as an example because I'm not just sitting here

pitching you and telling you about the offer. Trying to articulate that once you get close to being maxed out, you get to start to do things that are exclusivity tactics. And these are a few examples of it. So, with the one-year thing, hear me out. We have a reputation to safeguard. We play the game at a big level and are very well known for helping people get a fuckload richer.

Okay? Do you think I do that in a month of working with somebody? It's like, no. Sometimes, yeah, but a lot of the times it can take a longer duration of time, like a year, to really get some serious results out of an individual, right? And that's the type of person that I want being in that group going out there and saying they were in it or a part of it. I want people who get big,

monstrous, juicy results, large sums of money to be able to go out there and say, "Yeah, I was a part of Jeremy's inner circle." Or, "Yeah, I'm in Jeremy's inner circle. It's awesome." you know, I made this out of being in there. That's what I want. So, again, I need time for those people to actually be a part of it to help increase the probability dramatically

that they actually do those things and align with what we want and align with what they want, too. Now, does that sound like something that's unfair? Right? No. Both of these safeguard the product. Okay? They safeguard many things. They safeguard the reputation.

They safeguard the reputation of the program and me. They safeguard the person who's joining in actually having a high probability to achieve what they want to do. Okay? In addition to that, it safeguards the community itself, the product. Okay? We don't want a fuckload of really rich people interacting with brokies. That's not what this is about.

This is a place where people who are extremely rich and rich trying to get a fuckload richer in both scenarios go to openly talk about it. Right? If you have ever been in a situation as a rich person, I'll give you a great example.

Right? Just most recently on my Insta stories, I was posting about traveling home, okay? And how I chose to travel home in this case was on a little Lear 60, which is a midsize private jet, okay? And I was traveling from Virginia where I visited Mr. Tai Lopez and I came back home here to Miami. I didn't sit there and like take a photo on the plane, you know? I didn't post

like a little video of me walking into the jet. I literally filmed two YouTube videos, which were phenomenal, by the way, and likely already posted on the channel by the time you're watching this one, of me just on the jet filming YouTube videos and flying home with the marketing helper and video guy that I have here behind the camera and my fiance. Okay, just pretty base level

stuff. What do I have happen while I'm on the jet? I start to get absolutely blasted by bot followers. Okay, why does that happen? Because poor people and just people who don't like me in general hate to see the boy winning. Okay. So, as an example of that, it's like, how do you think that works inside of a community where you're trying to openly post about, "Hey guys,

I'm spending like $30,000 a day right now and I'm making $3 million a month. Does anybody have any insights on this kind of problem?" You don't want a bunch of base level morons around you that are like, "Oh, dude, like that's insane." Like, no. It's like you want people that are actually going to be at your level or above your level or pretty close to your level that can

lend good, genuine perspective to you to help you with your problem. And you want to know without having to do it yourself that the people that are going to contribute advice to you in that example are already vetted by the people who run the community. You understand? So as an exclusivity tactic, think about that.

It's like sometimes again base level morons who go to places like clubs and they dress like or they go to a nice restaurant and they're dressed like It's like the restaurant doesn't want somebody wearing a Hawaiian shirt, open toed flip flops with the hogs out and a Tommy Bahama cargo shorts, you know, walking into their restaurant when it's a twostar Michelin restaurant

and everybody else is having date night and dressed extremely well. They have a visual standard to upkeep that plays into the vibe and the culture and more importantly the exclusivity of who's going to be there and feel comfortable being there. You understand? It's like when you get to the point where you actually do these things, right? You get to jack up the price. Okay? You get to

jack up the price because it becomes more valuable to the people that are a part of it. And of course, it becomes more valuable to the people who wants to join into it. You understand? And what also more than anything else, when you actually do things like that successfully, when you're also close to being maxed out, which in my case with the inner circle, it's like I do

one-on-one calls in there, right? You can go join into any bum mastermind out there and get to show up however many times a year they do their little group thing and they have a relatively inactive mastermind that they'll let anybody and their cousin into that's a little broky. Not in my world, okay? Not in my world. I want to hold your hand to make a fuckload more money.

You understand? I give a about you making a fuckload more money because I want to go out there and get richer by helping other people get a fuckload richer, too. You understand? And when I do one-on-one, can I do that for a whole bunch of people? No. Right. Okay. At my masterminds, I like to do them where I live. I think the vibe of going to the person that you're learning from, going

to their crib, it's like right here in my penthouse, dude. This is where we currently do our masterminds. the last four places that I've had from the original penthouse I had over on a little island here in Miami to the beach house that we had during CO to the farm mansion that we had out in West Miami to now the penthouse here in Miami, the newest penthouse. We do them in the

crib. It's like downstairs we have a great large venue where we can fit about 150 people. That's why the group is limited to about 150 folks. Now, this is very important to understand. We with those two components alone are already pretty close to capacity on the amount of people I can do one-on-one with and the amount of people that can show up to a mastermind. The scaled

things in that offer are being a part of the community and doing the weekly group calls. Those are obviously scaled things. But what makes the offer have exclusivity tactics beyond the few that I've already peppered into you is the fact that I have limited availability to do to do one-on- ones and limited availability with the quantity of people I can fit and allow into my homes for

the masterminds. Okay, so hear me out. What does that do to the price? Okay. When I get more demand, which we get more demand literally every month, without exaggerating to you, every month we get more people that fit that criteria that we get to be more strict with about who we allow and who we don't allow in. I can't even quantify how many price increases we've had with the inner

circle since its origination. It's been a lot and we continue to drive it up and it continues to make sense to buy into because the people that continue buying into it are more financially qualified, more probable to make the money back because they're more financially qualified. And on top of that, the group becomes more valuable due to that cyclic process I just articulated. You

understand? It is something that I don't need to deploy more closers for. It's something that I can just turn up the price on on a perpetual basis due to the exclusivity components that I just articulated. But again, these things are strategic. They're intentional. Okay. In comparison, I have a very scaled offer.

It's a one-time price. It's called master internet marketing. It's a giant group class. AI Jeremy's included with it with some limitations to be clear since it's a onetime price. And we do live classes typically on an annual basis. sometimes every other year. It depends on how much changes in marketing. We got our next one coming up at the end of summertime. We'll announce

the date soon and everybody in the master internet marketing program, of course, they'll be the first made aware. Now, I want to be extremely direct when I say this that doesn't need to have exclusivity components to it. We still qualify and vet who we allow into there because we still want to allow people who are actually probable to get results into there. We never ever want to put

people into debt to get that program. We don't want to be in a position where somebody's on their last dollars and, you know, making their final bet on joining into that thinking they're going to make all the money in the world after being a part of it.

Although, to be fair, like some people have actually had that happen. But again, that's no way, shape, or form what we want to allow to occur. That's it's not somebody that we'd ideally want to sell. People have done that to us.

They've hid it from us and then they've later revealed their win to us with their extremely highressured scenario. They essentially lie to us. But anyway, that doesn't require us to limit the quantity of people that buy it. Okay, that specific offer, we can sell as much as possible. But let me be extremely clear when I say this. If I did want to jack up the price on that, okay, first

of all, the easiest way to do it is just looking at the results of the people who go through it, seeing that they make a tremendous amount more than what they're paying, which is consistently true, and just starting the process of adding some of these exclusivity components. I can always just raise the price relative to the fact people are getting more results with it. And if that's the case,

regardless of all the other exclusivity components that could be added, literally just based on the fact people are making more than what they've invested, that is the easiest justification to just start increasing price, which is the point I'm trying to make in this entire video. A lot of people, they really struggle to go out there and get new closers. You know,

they struggle with the process of hiring people. They don't really have a lot of desire to go out there and just consistently at the rate in which they're scaling hire, train, manage, fire, and just ongoing manage all these people within a sales organization.

There's also a lot of people that we've worked with over the years that hate salespeople so much. And and rightfully so, I mean, to be fair, like there's a lot of inconsistencies in people, period. Okay? Okay, so when you can add systems and processes and tactics like exclusivity tactics in this case, it is much easier to still make a lot more money by choosing to leverage other

places in the business in comparison to leveraging people as you continue to scale up and just drive up more calls. What if I told you as a result of generating far more calls, you didn't need to hire more salespeople. You needed to increase qualification criteria. And as a result of increasing qualification criteria, just as I did with minor circle offer, you

dramatically change the quality of person that's going to come through as a result, which in turn gets a lot better people in there, which in turn gets a lot better results for the people who join in, which in turn allows you to jack up the price more. You see, and then that cyclic process continues on.

It's like, have you ever heard that if you want to go buy like that new Ferrari that just came out? I don't even know the name of it because I personally hated it, but it's the La Ferrari successor. Okay, that new Ferrari that just came out, there has been word in the streets, okay, in the Ferrari world, and as a as a person who has two Ferraris myself over the years, I can't

stress this enough. Like, this is actually insane to hear out loud, okay? They want you to have bought an F40, which is like a low couple million dollar car. They want you to have a LA Ferrari, which is like give or take the mileage, like $3 to $5 million, and whether it's an Aperta variation or not.

They want you to have a handful of purchases, which means more than two. a handful of purchases from the Ferrari dealer that you ideally want to get this LaFerrari successor from. Okay? And on top of that, they have very strict rules and criteria that they want to see in terms of who they're selling the cars to. And they don't want you to be a reseller. Like, they want you to have a

collection that you're going to maintain. One of the people that I've looked up to over the years passively is a guy that's from a very similar area of mine in Ohio. His name's Rob Deerck. And Rob Deerck, he initially started off as a skateboarder, signed with DC, if you remember that skateboarding company. Rob then got the opportunity to have a TV show with MTV called Rob and Black. Um,

rest in peace to Black. He then got an opportunity to have what's called Fantasy Factory, which was another show with MTV. At that point, he had a la rather large warehouse, a handful of other endorsement deals, was still professionally skateboarding. And with the success of Robin Black, the TV show, this Fantasy Factory show was like his next big bet. Bang, that one worked out,

too. He then had another TV show, which is the one that has been the biggest of them all, which is called Ridiculousness, which I'm sure you've likely seen or heard of. And if not, go look it up. Anyway, Rob at the same time of doing all this was also creating and investing into different companies. And right now today, he identifies as a venture capitalist. Rob's goal is to be

a billionaire. Okay? And he's likely well on his way to do that. I, as an example, when I see Rob do what he does, and again, we're from a very similar city within the same state, and I've seen the level that he's grown to. We use the same hypnotist, Dr. George Pratt, who I originally went to as a result of seeing Rob's testimonial for it. You look at a guy like this and you

think, "Okay, wow, that's impressive, right? The guy's rich as already worth more than 100 mil plus." And what kind of video do you go and see on Rob's profile one day on Instagram? You see Rob standing in a Ferrari dealership and there's a there's a Ferrari in front of him and there's listen to this There are posters on the wall of the handful of Ferraris that this man has

purchased over the years with a like a letter and a number paired with each one of them. and they represented the number in which he purchased it and the letter was just the specific letter that he chose to pair with it. And he's sitting here in this video and I'm like I'm like, "Oh, wow. Maybe Rob did a collab with Ferrari or something like what's this?" No, this man is absolutely

glazing the out of two Ferrari salespeople. Not like managers in Ferrari, not people who work at Ferrari's corporate dealership. Literally just two Ferrari salespeople who worked in one of the local Los Angeles divisions. I'm I'm sure it's very probable to be the Beverly Hills division specifically. Just blazing the out of him, talking about how he's

so grateful for the opportunity to have bought the Ferraris that he has over the years. Talking about and making it extremely clear he's building a collection that he's going to hand down to his children one day. He never intends to sell them. Glazing the out of how amazing the Ferrari heritage and brand is as a whole. And you can tell like in this this the point of what

I'm trying to articulate to you here in this example is here's a man who's worth a hundred plus million dollars that essentially has to get down on his knees and suck off these Ferrari sales guys just for the opportunity to go and buy that Laaf Ferrari successor to be able to have the opportunity to get a car like a Daytona SP3 from Ferrari and who knows what else. I'm sure all

future variations of cars that they come out with you'll have a high probability to be able to purchase. Why? because Ferrari leveraged him into a position through exclusivity tactics of being able to get a great man, a big man just like that to go out and not just do it privately, but to publicly post. Go look it up yourself. Go to his Instagram.

You'll see what I'm talking about. There's a bunch of Ferrari colors and it's Rob standing there, posters on the wall, two guys standing off and like it's so funny, dude. Like the video is cutting from like Rob to like these two guys in the back like smiling and kind of laughing and being like yeah like these guys are loving this It's it's comical to watch. But the

point is is like dude people do this every day as rich people to get things that they want. It's like this is why country clubs have multi00,000 a year initiation fees and then tens of thousands of dollars in annual dues.

This is why, as an example, like even I joined a beach club for, you know, low tens of thousands of dollars with even lower annual dues, just to have the opportunity to go to a somewhat exclusive hotel, hang out with other rich folks, and go to the beach in a nice place. It's like this is why with with even things like watches, like you're not walking into Richard

Mill and buying this watch, okay? You're not. They're going to sell you a ladies watch first. They're going to sell you a more entry- level watch and they're going to make you wait months in between. And then they're going to give you the opportunity to buy the nice watch that you actually want to buy. And even then, the watches that you might actually want to get that are one of

those limited of 50 watches, they're not going to sell to you. Even if you've bought like four or five watches from them, you know who they're going to sell them to? The guys who have bought like 10 or 15, 20, 30 that have already been a part of their game for a long time. Those are the And you're going to get the opportunity to buy from one of those guys secondhand so they can make a

profit. And Richard Mill is going to help facilitate the deal. You understand? It's like these things have existed in both modern society and all historical variations of society for the longest time. I ask you this, why aren't you choosing to leverage some of these exclusivity tactics in your business?

Like you don't think just a just a decade ago if you go and you shop as an example in the Miami Design District or the Bow Harbor shops or some local place where you have a good relationship with some of those designer stores and you ask them like hey do you remember when Hermes like they were just begging you to buy one of those bags like nobody gave a about Hermes like a decade

ago. Okay but like now you're probably sitting here thinking what like nobody gave a about Hermes like what are you talking about? It's like, yeah, as a matter of fact, down here in the design district, there's a Laurel Piana directly across from Hermes. And you might not even know what Laurel Piana is. I'm sure a lot of you who are the right target audience do, but still,

there's probably a few of you have no idea what I'm talking about. Either way, it's a nice designer brand. It's one of those like old money brands is how it currently is framed, but it's pretty sick. Anyway, right across from Laurel Piana in the Miami Design District is an Hermes store. And one of the women who works there, she's one of my sales reps.

She goes, "Uh, yeah, I remember a decade ago like these Hermes people, like they were begging people to take the bags. Like now it's like you can't go in there and beg for a bag, you know?

Like they make you buy all kinds of There are, you can go on Tik Tok is a great example of this or Instagram or even YouTube, dude, where there's women who will and dudes, a lot of gay dudes, but still just dudes and women in general that are going to post strategies to put you on game on what you need to buy first, how to develop a strategic relationship, what location

you might need to fly to to have a higher probability be able to buy a bag, just to be able to buy a bag. You understand? It's like that's all just exclusivity tactics. Again, I ask you as simple as this. Like why do you think Hermes a decade ago wasn't able to have that leverage and why do you think they are now? It all starts with being close to being maxed out. So what Hermes

likely did in that example and what Ferrari does too in this case is they just strategically pull back the amount of production on their products. With services as an example, it's the same kind of concept. We're just going to strategically pull back the quantity of people that we allow ourselves to deliver to and as a result immediately we're going to increase demand. You see,

think about this. It's like I'll give you a great example. I remember I watched this one video, one of those little short form clips that the guy does and he said he was giving tips about the best agency owners to work with. And I thought it was really relatable cuz like I had a lot of these tactics. One of the tactics that I want to highlight is he goes the best

agencies are always maxed out. Like they have like a waiting list. Like when you actively want to work with one of these really good marketing agencies, like they're probably going to tell you to get and just put you on a list and you're going to have to wait, right?

It's like that's leverage, dude. That's leverage, right? That's because they strategically have a limit. It's like, I could work with more clients, but I don't want to work with more clients. I don't like working with a fuckload of clients. I like working with the best possible people I can work with that I can make a fuckload of money with. So, if somebody strategically comes along

and they fit that criteria, absolutely will let them in the door. One of my buddies lives across the street here, Brandon Carter, right? The big BBC. Okay. He says that one of his favorite things to do, right? He has a Richard Mill, I think it's the RM10 if I'm not mistaken. And he's like, "Dude, I think it's so funny. Like, I can go to the Rolex store and if I wear that watch,

they'll go to the back and immediately pull out some heavy hitters for me that somebody else literally right next to me might be begging for the opportunity to buy and they're getting told they're getting put on a wait list." It's like, well, why does Brandon get the opportunity to walk in there and they offer him a watch that somebody else is getting put on a wait list for? It's

because he's the right type of person that they want to have buy and they also know that he's going to be able to buy. It's not going to be a stretch for him and they're going to rep he's going to represent the brand. Well, you get what I mean? It's like my point being, right?

Like I have a limit in the quantity of deals that we do as a marketing agency and due to the fact I'm at capacity. Okay, I have the leverage in that example. It's like what's different in your world? All you really got to do is pull back the amount of people that you're going to give the opportunity to service or give the opportunity to sell to and then bang. You know, you ever

seen one of those like little sixperson omocas sushi experiences? It's like there's one here in Miami. One of my favorite little places to go to a literal closet turned into a restaurant.

Has six seats. It's called Elsie Cretto. It's inside of the Fina in Miami Beach. A literal closet. Like I'm not exaggerating. an actual closet turned into a restaurant. Six people. I don't even remember the price per person that it is to go. But I'm pretty sure it's over $1,000 per person to go and sit there and have sushi and omacas experience. It's like, why do they get

to charge that much? Cuz there's six seats and two serving times a night. You don't even get to choose when you get to go eat. They just say, "Yeah, we got this at 5:30 and we got this at 9:30. Take your pick. It's up to you." You know, get if you want to come another time. You know, it's it really again, think about that. It's like and if they get booked out for like weeks at

a time, like you guys have probably all heard of Carbone, right? Carbone's got a little location over here at Miami Beach. Carbone has enough res like there. Again, there's people strategically pumping out content that tell you, hey, on the first of every month at this specific time, that's when the reservations refresh for the following month. Like, go in there at

that exact time and try to book a reservation. There's people who sell reservations. That's how exclusive those specific reservations are. It's like they themselves could go and just book themselves out, right? It's like it could be a strategy that none of us are even aware of that allow them to be like perceptually so in demand. And then when you get the opportunity to go and eat

there, you feel like blessed, you know, like you're you're like, "Oh my god, I can't believe I get to go to Carbone." There's also an app. It's called Dorsia. Okay, I love Dorsia because then you can get around all the little that they put you through with those kind of things and you can just agree to pay a high dollar value per person and skip that whole process. So essentially from

there what they chose to do through that Dorsia app is get a guaranteed amount per table in revenue. It's like it's unbelievable. I love exclusivity tactics. Products, services, doesn't matter. They are one of my favorite things to do. And yet a majority of the people that I work with, both clients, inner circle members, master internet marketing students, doesn't matter.

Remarkably, a very small quantity of people actually leverage exclusivity tactics. And it's because in most instances, they think that it prevents scale when in reality it makes scale easier. It makes scaling and making more money easier to deliver on because there's far less people that you're delivering for. And you also get to work with far better people every single time

you increase the exclusivity standard that you operate with. A remarkable tactic, very undermined, something you should actively consider when you're in your pursuit to million-dollar months.
