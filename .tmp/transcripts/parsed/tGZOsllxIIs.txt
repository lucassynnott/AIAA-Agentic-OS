Just recently, we had a Jeremy's Inner Circle mastermind right here at the new facility. And we had not one, two, three, four, but five total trophies that we had given out to our award winners. Three of which were $1 million a month trophies. Two of which were $5 million a month trophies. The big silver ones that you see here, those ones are made of pure silver, and those are the

$5 million a month trophies. The ones that you see that are gold, those are the $1 million a month trophies. And in this particular video, I'm going to talk to you about the lessons of each one of these five different trophy winners.

We're going to talk about the commonalities amongst them all. We'll talk about the specific funnels that they use to get there. And I'll lightly talk without revealing too much detail out of respect for the trophy winners privacies of their business model and the fact that they share a lot of intimate lessons with me. I'm not here to sit here and air out their business.

I'm here to give you some common lessons that these people share that you can take away after you watch today's video. So, welcome in if you're new to the channel. That's all we talk about around here is clearing million-dollar months.

We don't make any income claims, though. We have no idea who the you are and whether you literally have any probability to go out there and make money, let alone this amount of money that you see here. It's a very low probability, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, that you ever hit these big dog numbers. To crack 10 million a year, which isn't even a

million dollar a month. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics claims that 0.1% of all businesses ever achieve those numbers, let alone the even smaller quantity of people that hit a million dollars a month and the way way smaller probability that you'd ever clear $5 million a month in the lifetime since 2019 through right now as I sit here and make this video of having Jeremy's inner

circle. I've given out a total of four $5 million a month trophies. One of which has since gone bankrupt. Just to put it in perspective from how crazy that business model was. I just can't stress enough. I'm not sitting here trying to say you're going to make a fuckload of money by watching this video. Just trying to hand down lessons from these people since nobody really

talks about this kind of stuff transparently. So, thanks for being here. And of course, if you're already subscriber, welcome back. Absolute pleasure to have you. Without further ado, let's get started. So, first of all, the $5 million a month trophies are pretty serious winners. And we'll start with those two. Okay, so first of all, I'm not going to say the names of these

particular people because everybody on Earth is currently trying to copy their specific model. It seems like every single agency owner, course, and mentor that existed abandoned trying to teach the traditional agency model and started to attempt to teach an agency AI model where essentially instead of selling traditional digital marketing services and agency services, they're selling

essentially AI service implementation. So that can be as simple as setting up specific make and zap automations and trying to call it AI or to be fair leveraging AI throughout the zaps and make make.com to be clear is what I'm referencing by the way for those who might not know about it. Anyway, long story short, all the way over to like NADN, simple things like, you know, LLM

structures and AI agents, there's all kinds of stuff that an AI service can technically sell. Moral of the story is the first $5 million a month winner. That is what they chose to do. They historically had a model where they taught agency owners and they were one of the first, if not literally the first that chose to pivot into this niche. And it was a great move to do so. I don't

think it's nearly as great of a move, of course, given the total quantity of people that now sell that. It's becoming just like the traditional agency course model where there's arguably without exaggeration probably low tens of thousands or high thousands of people that teach the agency model. Moral of the story is and this is all I'm trying to emphasize with these guys. Earlier

this year in January they were at 500k a month. Okay, they got that $5 million a month trophy. They finished July at $5 million a month which is truly insane. Just to put that in perspective.

Okay, can't stress that enough. The emphasis I want to put on this just to be extremely clear. The probability I don't even know a number. I'm not going to make up a number. You probably don't know a number. I don't know if anybody knows the number of the odds of taking a business from half a million a month to 5 million a month in technically a 7-month period of time.

But again, in terms of probabilities, like it's got to be near impossible. Okay, but they pulled it off and they did it from a few key things that I want to make sure I hand down. Okay, number one was a big thing. They pivoted offers, which surprisingly is something that you don't really want to do because there's a higher probability you're going to reach success by tweaking

everything that's necessary with your current offer, scaling your offer. But there are certain things that when they come around make a lot of sense to try to latch on to if you manage to latch on to one of the trends that actually lasts. The issue is there's a lot of stuff that comes around that's like a flash in the pan. Like imagine, as an example, you created an entire YouTube

channel around Lab Boooos, right? It's like it's going to be a flash in the pan kind of trend. Okay, and there's all kinds a majority of trends are like that, like lab boooos. Okay, there's a minority of trends that come around where they're going to ingrain themselves into society forever. And AI is a great example of that. Google Trends is an example of this. You go

search right now anything in Google Trends. Search AI against it. Like whatever you think the most popular things are possibly on Earth, search AI against it in Google Trends. Take the span of time over a 5year duration and look at it yourself. Right? you attach yourself to that kind of trend, that number all of a sudden becomes far more realistic because simply put, the growth

of the industry as a whole directly determines the growth of your offer, your business itself. There's a guy who came in here to the facility recently. He works out at the gym next door. Shout out to him if he ever happens to be watching this. He is a Roblox streamer.

And first of all, this guy's got crazy assets. His YouTube channels, by the way, he had like seven or eight of these things at a at the lowest had I think about 3 to four million subscribers per channel, dude. It's insane. and he streams Roblox all day. And just to be clear, Roblox apparently is one of the highest and continuing to be the highest level of

interest games that exists for a wide range of demographics, but mainly kids in this case. I want to be really clear when I say this. The growth of Roblox as a game and it becoming more and more and more popular as time continues to go on will directly correlate to his level of growth and revenue that he experiences on his YouTube channels. Okay. soon as Roblox starts to contract, his channel

viewership, his channel subscribers, the rate in which he's continuing to grow and likely his revenue will start to contract. Okay, so that's kind of the big risk of attaching yourself to a trend. You have that probability that you are officially exposed to. Now, in terms of funnels, they did it all through call funnels. They got all the way up there to call funnels. They

started to kind of stall out a bit and they needed to go far larger with other types of funnels and work those in. things like webinars, challenge funnels, low ticket to high ticket ascension. DM ads, as you may have known if you've watched this channel before and heard me talk about DM ads, generally limited if you do them from a paid advertising perspective to a couple hundred grand at

best. So, that's something that could contribute, I guess, but it's not going to get them to 10 mil a month, which is what they're currently focused on. Okay. Point I'm trying to make though, call funnels massive, like multi like over 50 sales reps, okay? Sitting there taking calls all day and they deal with the same problems that everybody deals with.

Okay? They have show rate issues that they need to resolve for. They have, you know, the hiring process of sales people, the training process of those sales people, the stick rate of those sales people, creative testing, every single thing that everybody deals with at much smaller levels are just exacerbated at those greater levels of spend. Okay, now on to our second trophy

winner for $5 million a month. $5 million a month goes to Mr. Ryan Clog. Now, this was kind of an unfortunate trophy to give away, as silly as that might sound, because we had an inner circle member who came in super hot. His name was Seem. Salem joins in all excited like talking about this feud that he had with Ryan clog like a friendly feud to be clear where they

were on the race to who could get to 5 million a month sooner. At the time they were both around 3 million a month but they had sat down and essentially made a bet and said who can get there first.

Okay. Now just to be clear unfortunately Ryan got there first and so we have to give him a trophy as a result of him beating one of our inner circle members who again is still stuck around that like 3-ish million a month mark. Ryan managed to within months dominate the out of that competition and clear substantial numbers. And he did it with the company that he constantly says he

is associated with and actively running as one of the co-founders, warriorbab.com. So if you go check out Warrior Babe, mainly an info niche business specifically to women and transformation of going from wherever they're currently at to a much fitter, healthier, better version of themselves.

A classic triedand-rue niche. Okay. And when you look at a business that does that amount of revenue, one of the first things that you really have to consider is, and I've talked about this extensively on this channel many times over, how many people are within that given demographic that are in market, right? And I've said things like if you sell to the sales demographic, if you

sell like sales is one of the number one niches on earth when it comes to work demographics for the largest industries that exist. Think about it in the context of like the amount of people you could sell sales training to as an example or placement offers, right?

There were guys who have unfortunately since gotten taken down by the FTC as a result of scaling this offer a bit too ambitiously and having issues with the fulfillment side of things, putting a bunch of reps onto offers. However, placement offers, right, those have historically grown massively. Like that specific business had grown to over 20 plus million dollars on an annual basis.

Okay, the point I'm attempting to make is when you are in a niche like health and wellness or like women's transformations in the health and wellness category, even more specific than that, Ryan's probabilities to achieve these numbers naturally as a result of participating in a far larger niche are great. And there's always a trend like think about a period of time

where there's been a trend where being fatter is cooler than being fitter, right? There's always that natural pressure to get fit, stay fit, and if you're not fit to go through a transformative process. Okay? So, as a category, very important to take note.

Both of these guys that hit these $5 million a month levels had that set of lessons. They pivoted and were in a niche that actively was huge, huge trend and then to be clearer, just massive markets, okay, massive markets where the ability for them to spend money successfully at scale and be at a great rise in doing so is just a far greater probability comparatively to thinking by

comparison of like a small geographic market where you only sell to like homeowners, right? Or you only sell to like commercial property owners. You got to have a large market to have higher probabilities to make a fuckload more money when it comes to transacting with a fuckload more people, right? So anyway, down to our 1 million a month winners, which again you'll see are

these gold trophies by comparison. The $1 million a month winners. In this case, we have three. We'll start with Carlton. So Carlton went out of his way and accomplished this. By the way, I just want to be fair to Carlton and saying he does more than a million a month respectfully to him, but we only have two trophies in the inner circle.

We have a million a month and we have 5 million a month. So until you have 5 million, you're kind of stuck in between, right? Anyway, Carlton's model is a service-based model and he also has a course component to it. So an information model as well, depending on which one of his services or offers you choose to purchase from him will determine which one you fall into there.

He is a tax strategist and a really good one at that. Carlton is, you could argue, at the literal top of that specific niche, both in terms of revenue and in terms of his social presence, quality of his content, the consistency of his content, and more importantly, his advertising efforts. He's a combination of both, right? Both of these sources, organic and paid,

contribute to what he does. And most of that revenue, very important to note, comes from what we call the chunk method, which is a combination of a few specific variables. Challenge funnels, webinars, call funnels, it's a mix, right? Though to be fair, give or take the month. There's some significant revenue differences, give or take a specific funnel, like a challenge funnel

as an example happening. And then there's other months where you're just limited to your daily lead flow. That'll naturally create some fluctuations, but he's very consistently above that number. So congratulations to Carlton.

He's getting his first trophy from us being a part of Jeremy's inner circle. We're very proud of what he's accomplished. Done a tremendous job. Service based businesses, especially service-based businesses like Carlton's that sell to rich people, they have the ability to sell to fewer people, but at a much higher price per customer. And as a result, the math becomes really easy

when you're talking about million-dollar months. So his million a month, as an example, is let's say that he sells a $50,000 service, which to be clear, he didn't do in this particular instance.

This is just a math example. You need 20 people to buy at 50K in order to hit the million a month, right? If I sold something at 25K, I just doubled the number. I need 40 people. You see what I'm trying to say? It's like the math becomes far easier when you talk about total customers you need to sell. That can complicate your fulfillment relative to what you sell. Of course, when you

sell for that level of pricing, but that's a completely different lesson for another video. Point I'm trying to make here is Carlton does challenge funnels, webinars, call funnels, combination of all of it. So, he follows the logic of our chunk method strategy where not just one channel makes all the revenue, but several channels make up the total revenue. And we're really excited to be

able to inevitably, it feels like, get him to the 5 million a month level. Very exciting time for him and his business. So, again, congratulations to Carlton and everything he's accomplished. So, that lesson specifically, if you break that one down, they are selling to rich people. Okay? They are selling towards the rich. Okay? And when you sell to rich people, the numbers just become a

little easier typically. Okay? So, these next two, the $1 million a month awards that we have left, one of them in particular, I'm not going to say his name out of respect for the guy so I can be a little more detailed with you. He had been in the inner circle for a relatively good period of time. I want to say he's been in there at least 3 years, maybe getting close to his fourth

year now, but for sure around 3 years. And this guy in particular, he has historically been an organicon business. All of his revenue was coming from info for this specific award that we're sitting here talking about. This particular guy also has other revenue sources, but again, I'm just not factoring those into what we're sitting here communicating. For his info offer

in particular, that's why he joined the inner circle. That's what he wanted to grow and that's what he wanted to scale. Now, initially, he joined in with the intent of I want to learn paid advertising. It took him a little longer than than some people, but he learned it and he learned it at the perfect time.

Okay, when he joined in, he was stuck around give or take the month like call it four to maybe upwards at the best months like 600k a month. Okay, and his organic revenue started to take a hit.

Through time, the algorithm kind of started suppressing his reach. And so, as a result of that, his content was getting less and less views. He really thrived during like the co Tik Tok era.

That's where he grew a tremendous following and had a lot of people watching his stuff. And then as time passed, that content just got suppressed. So, by the time that he comes to me in this particular instance, he'd been in the group for a fair bit of time. You he sits down vulnerably with me at at a lunch in particular, and he was like, you know, I'm just getting

absolutely on over here. I'm at like 300k a month now. You know, I'm really fed up with this. like you know I'm wondering what I need to do and this guy who's teaching an offer copywriting specifically that it just made so much more sense for him to attach himself to the AI trend as to we talked about towards the beginning of this video I didn't in any way shape or form want him

to like sell all these other AI services I was like dude just understand what people want like they want an easy to learn business model essentially there's a business opportunity that you're trying to teach people at the very least like a skill acquisition opportunity that's going to lead to money okay whether they freelance or like become an agency owner regardless you're you're

teaching them something that makes money, okay? They naturally would want that to be easier. He was actively selling against AI. He was trying to say like, "No, you want to learn this skill.

You want to like master these things yourself." And I told him that was silly. I was like, "That's not really what people want. I think you should sell with AI instead." So, he's a man of action. He went back home immediately started doing that. And he right away, just with that change alone, got back up to his baseline in that like 4 to 600K range. Okay. From here, his organic

content was still continuing to get suppressed. And he had to pivot to the paid advertising solution. And he started doing that. And that's how he achieved his million-doll a month trophy that we're giving him here. I can't stress this enough. Like, this is a very interesting lesson. The timing of when to do what matters a lot, right? The pressure of the situation really

increased his willingness to get to the point where paid advertising worked for him. It's an unfortunate thing to have to sit there and try to emphasize the lesson of like sometimes pressure can be great because you ideally don't want to have to be in high pressure situations to be able to achieve great outcomes and great results. I I can't stress it enough though like in this particular

case per usual it worked out tremendously well for this guy. So a majority of that revenue by far now and a minority by far minority organic majority paid advertising revenue which is a phenomenal transition. A lot of people come to us for help on those kinds of things and we do really well with that kind of stuff. Just to be extremely clear on this, his was also

the chunk method call funnels and webinars but mainly call funnels. huge contribution from CallFunnels. Currently though, testing other funnels to try to start working them in to his overall mix to strengthen the amount of revenue he's able to produce. Can't stress this enough. There are a lot of great lessons in this one, but the main one that I want to make really clear is you have to

know when to transition. Okay? And sometimes transitioning can come from like a nice healthy pressure. Sometimes transitioning in this particular instance can come from like stop being attached to the old thing, detach from it and start attaching to the new thing instead. Very important to consider.

Okay, last but not least by any means, it's our final trophy winner. I love this specific story. So, this guy joins into the inner circle. He was around 500k, give or take the month, all the way up to around 800K a month, okay? And this guy in particular has a crypto offer where he's got a crypto mastermind. You join into it. It's extensive course library you get access

to in a community of other people, but it's geared towards rich people. It's geared towards people that already have like a baseline amount of money that they can essentially gamble with in the crypto markets. and he teaches them all kinds of things. He teaches them all the way to like gambling strategies essentially with things like memecoins all the way over to much more

traditional like long-term oriented investing. And it's a very it's a very great mastermind this guy's got. So he joins in. And by the way, this is an Australian that joins in. We're hosted here in Miami, Florida. He didn't give a at all about being able to come to a mastermind, but he'll be flying more than 25 hours to collect his award and come give us a talk on exactly what he

did in these lessons I'm about to sit here and tell you in much more depth, of course. Moral of the story is this Australian man with this crypto mastermind offer sitting around 500 to 800K a month comes in learns webinars from our perspective of how we execute them. We have this large SOP on mastering webinars. We also have several weekly group calls on webinars. We have

mastermind talks dedicated just to webinars. A lot of information simply put on webinars. This guy goes through all of it. Just binges this and he gets enough confidence to set aside a gambling budget for paid advertising for this next webinar he was going to do for $85,000. Okay, this is in his first month, which I can't stress enough. I'm not trying to imply in any way, shape,

or form that you join in and you're about to do what this guy did. Okay, this is extremely rare. I think literally I've seen this happen one time for this exact story that I'm sitting here telling you. This is by no means common. And again, I'm not in any way, shape, or form trying to emphasize that you're going to be able to repeat this level of result if you join into the

inner circle, especially not in the first month. But this guy did, okay? Okay. And this is what he went out and did. Spent $85,000 on a webinar and this guy cranked $800,000 from that webinar. Now you couple that with the revenue that he was already making in a month. Bam. The guy clears more than a million dollar a month.

Okay? And now he gets himself a nice trophy. Flies literally all over the world, but comes over here to Miami, Florida to get his trophy present to us as all of these specific trophy winners are doing. They collect their award.

They give a little 30-minute talk on all the top lessons that they learned to us here in Jeremy's inner circle at our facility in Miami, Florida. We do masterminds four times a year. We do one-on-one calls twice a month that you can book, weekly group calls, Saturdays.

We obviously record them all, put them into a giant training library for you. We record all our historical masterminds. Have a training library with those for you as well. Access to Jeremy AI, a group chat that's extremely active, an SOP library of 30 plus SOPs on all my ad strategies and best practices. Everything in there is meant to help rich people get a fuckload

richer. So, we do things like this. We celebrate big wins. We don't celebrate anything smaller than a million a month. And currently, we celebrate all the way up to 5 million a month. Very excited for the new problem of having to find a trophy supplier for an even larger trophy for our $10 million a month award. Cuz currently these $5 million a month awards, these ones in particular,

are made of actual silver when you hit the 5 million a month. So, pretty cool stuff we got going on here. Thank you so much for watching today's video. I hope you go out there and get richer yourself. And listen, at the very least, whether you check out those links down in the description and consider actually spending some money with me so I can help you further, or whether you just go

watch some of my additional YouTube videos that I have for you here today and every week ongoing, I encourage you to go out there and get richer regardless. Toxin.
