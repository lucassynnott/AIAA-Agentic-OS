Back-end selling is one of the most critical undermined areas currently in all funnels that we're seeing across all high ticket product and service-based businesses. A lot of people have this illusion that all of the selling is going to be done on the front end. So, let me give you a good example of this with call funnels. People always about the fact that somebody doesn't

watch a VSSL and then shows up and talks to their sales team. People do things like, "Oh, I had a webinar and it didn't go that well." But again, after the opt-in occurs, they do nothing prior to the webinar or in the call funnel prior to the call to dramatically increase the probability of conversion at the conversion event. So, what ends up happening is when you only focus on

front-end selling, you end up being put into a position where you fail to have sales calls or sales conversion events. What ends up happening is all those sales conversations turn into education calls, which is not what you want.

That's typically when your sales people about things like, "Oh, these leads are too cold. The leads are too early in the process. You see really long sales cycles. You see really low show rates." All of that, literally, all of those symptoms are signs that you are currently failing with backend selling.

And one thing that I've done tremendously well on this channel is I've documented so much of all of my back-end selling tactics for you to go through. And what I'm going to do in this video here today is I'm going to walk you through at a high level what these things are and what all needs to be in place for you to actually have a fully built extremely effective backend

selling system. For all those unfamiliar, my name is Jeremy Haynes. We're on the jet today. No, this is not my jet. This is just a jet that we brokered to go from this area we were at in Virginia where we were visiting Tai Lopez's farm uh back down to Miami to the motherland. All we talk about on this channel is hitting milliondoll months. So, if you're new, welcome in.

That's all you're in for around here. And if you're already a subscriber, welcome back. It's a pleasure to have you. I've got a banger for you here today. So, without further ado, let's dive into today's topic. So again, back-end selling is essentially a sequence of specific actions that we want to have in place. That way, by the time our sales conversion event occurs,

like a sales call or a webinar or a challenge funnel or a live event or even after somebody buys something low ticket, in between the time that we're trying to ascend them to a high ticket offer, we want to make sure that our back-end selling system is dialed in.

So, let me go through this with you literally step by step. If we use a call funnel as a great example of this, we have a few things that occur. We have the person that goes from an ad over to the VSSL page. They then are in most instances going to apply and then they're going to book a call. Now, right after that occurs, this is where most people really with what they do from

here is they have like a pretty basic email sequence and that's really it. Then the call occurs and then their salespeople and complain when the person who shows up for that call isn't framed well and that call ends up being an education call. What we have to do is essentially in between the call and the call being booked, we got to add several steps. So let me go through what those

steps are. First of all, we have our confirmation page best practices. We have an entire SOP on this inside of both my master internet marketing community and my inner circle program.

And of course, we just do it for all our clients. This is incredible. I have a few videos where I talk about this concept called breakout videos and confirmation page best practices in general, but it all starts here.

Typically, what we'll do is we'll have anywhere from about 5 to 20 of these videos that we call breakout videos. Now, breakout videos, all they do is answer very direct questions. All we like to do with the breakout videos is answer some of the most common questions that the sales people say, "Hey, I'm tired of having to answer these questions on sales calls. This would be

really good if they knew this kind of stuff ahead of time." Some great examples of this, like whatever you talk about in your VSSL that you're tired of people not knowing before the call, reiterate them inside of breakout videos. These are usually about a minute to 3 minutes long. We see some of them like very few come out to about 5 minutes in length. But again, that's

more rare. What happens at a much much more frequent rate is we have these 1 to three minute videos that are essentially just go to the sales team, ask them specifically like, "Guys, what are you frustrated with having to talk about?

What do you wish people knew ahead of time?" And then you as the business owner in this case, you can also guess some of these things too. and you can determine what are the things that I want people to know beyond the things that I think people are are just, you know, talking about on calls. You got to also be able to successfully guess a few. And this is another major key here

with these videos. They have to be effective. Okay? The goal of back-end selling is to be able to make the lead who just booked the call or just opted into the webinar or just bought that low ticket thing or whatever it is that they just did. Our goal is to make them prioritize buying the high ticket thing.

Okay? And prioritization is not something to undermine as a tactic. Prioritization means that the lead genuinely gives a about showing up because they know that this specific result bridge that you're going to take them over is something they must do.

It's something they need. It's something they have to demand of themselves. It's something that they have to prioritize. So simply put, what makes you prioritize something? Information. And not just any information, the right information. As an example, all over the world, specifically mainly in the Middle East, we see bombs go off. We see all kinds of chaos. We see war. But has that inspired

you to actually do anything? I'm sure there might be sub 1% of you who watch this channel that actually took some kind of action on that information. Like maybe you bought some anti-radiation medicine just in case you get nuked or something. Maybe you started becoming a prepper and you started buying a bunch of just in case of some worldaltering event. Maybe an even

smaller quantity of you decided to go and buy a bunker. You see what I'm saying? That kind of information although changes lives and definitely is information that can make you do something. Most of you, 99 plus% of you, I'm sure, maybe even greater than that, didn't do with that information.

Now, what if you went to a skin care doctor like a dermatologist, and they said, "Sir, I noticed you got a little something here, and I want to take a look at it." Okay, I want to be able to drill down further on this. I'm a little concerned about that spot. Okay. I bet you more than half of you immediately would schedule a followup to get that radiologist or whoever is going to take

a look at that spot, to go get whatever scans are going to be done, to go get whatever tests, to go get your blood work. I guarantee you that information is actionable for a majority of you sitting here watching that video. So the difference in what kind of information that we have to get to people is it has to be information that puts them into action. You understand? When we don't

get people information that inspires action, simply put, we got them the wrong information. And it's that simple. So even if you do some of these actions that I sit here and talk about, if you fail in getting the person, if you fa simply put, even more simpler than that, if you fail to influence your statistics, like your show rate, like your close rate, like your sales cycle

shortening, like your AOV going up for more people paying in full. You whiff on what I'm going to sit here and talk to you about right now, and you failed to make it a priority for people. Just cuz you do it doesn't mean you did it right.

and you sitting here watching this on YouTube right now for free. It's obviously important to note I'm not going to drill down and tell you every video you need to make for your business that's going to make people show up at a higher priority. You have to be able to guess that and ideally you have to be able to pay. There's links down in the description for my inner

circle program that's built for the rich people trying to get a hell of a lot richer. There's minimum qualifications you have to meet if you want my one-on-one help, weekly group calls, a fuckload of SOPs that are well organized, unlimited access to AI Jeremy and a bunch of course videos, and plenty of examples of confirmation page videos that had 30 plus% lifts in show rate.

Okay, we had a guy who just joined into the inner circle a week and a half ago, as an example, where all he did was focus on these back-end selling systems. He saw a 39% lift. He was the biggest one yet and he was the newest member to just recently join in. This dude saw 178 grand in a week and a half from that 39% lift in his show rate. You understand how extreme that is? That man absolutely

me on what he paid to be in that program a week and a half into it. And that's great for him. Okay, now that's the whole point of what I'm trying to emphasize. I'm going to tell you what to do, but I'm not going to drill down on it. For those of you who want that drill down information, make sure to check those links down in the description. I digress though. These videos, again, if

they fail to make the impact that you're looking for, make sure you drill, I can't stress it enough, talk to your sales team and see what you whiffed on. Guess better about what people need to know and talk about things that are a little bit uncomfortable to a degree.

For some of the videos, a good example, I'll give you one good video as an example of something that has a really high impact. When we see people make a video going over their dispute rate and their refund rate for whatever high ticket product or service they have, that's one of the most transparent ways that you can increase trust dramatically. That helps make it

trusting. That helps make it something that can escalate the level of trust an individual has with you in your business damn near immediately. When the have you ever seen a video of somebody that you just opted into a funnel for that you're going to spend thousands or tens of thousands of dollars with that immediately says, "Okay, here's my refund rate. Here's my dispute rate."

They don't just say it. They literally log into their payment processor and show it to you. Some of you guys, you have such dispute rates and refund rates. You know, you can't do that tactic cuz you're operating like And so, as an example, you can start to see that from the outside in, like there's probably Reddit threads about you. There's probably people

talking online somewhere chirping about how you suck ass. There's probably people who have never even bought your product somewhere in a better case scenario that just are part a part of that spectrum where from a propaganda view they're a part of the hating class that's never going to believe anything that you say. By the way, for the hating class that I don't know why you're

watching this video, you shouldn't even be here. Jay, show them that we're actually flying in a plane here so we don't get some that says, "Oh, you didn't even take off." Hey, you Shut up. All right. Now, back to talking to the rich people, which is the demographic I'm trying to talk to here. Back to this. Okay, these videos, they are extreme by themselves

for what they do. This is generally one of the first actions that we see people take, but that's the best part about this first specific action in the back-end selling system is this doesn't have a cost to it. So when you take this action, you can generally do it first and it creates a pretty much immediate impact. All right. Now, once you have these videos, what you got to do next is

you got to have what we call valued dense email sequences. And we have an entire video on this channel dedicated to this topic, too. Valuense emails are essentially taking this exact set of videos that you just made and turning them into email sequences. We ideally want to take those same questions. We want to assume that someone's not actually going to watch every video that

we put on that page, but we want to assume that that information is high impact enough to make emails out of them. Okay? We also of course want to pepper in things like testimonials. We of course want to pepper in case studies, but one tip I was recently at Tai Lopez's farm. That's where we're flying out from right now. And he sat down and he asked me, he was like, "You

know, Jeremy, if you could give one piece of advice all these marketers I'm on a call with right now, what would it be?" And I told him straight up, I said, "Stop emphasizing all these audacious testimonials you got that come off as unbelievable to people. You don't want to only highlight." It'd be like, as an example, me saying, "Oh, in my inner circle, uh, let me tell you about the

million-doll a month earners." Like, let me tell you about the guy that joined in that was at $2.5 million a month and added 400k in revenue after a month of being in there. It's like, I don't want to talk about those. A majority of you already been close to $2.5 million a month. You're either on this channel doing a couple hundred grand a month looking to get to your first

million dollar a month or the few of you that are watching this that are at your million-doll months already and you're trying to tack on the next million a month. That result is inspiring to you but it doesn't feel relatable and close.

In comparison, the testimonial is an example that I articulated towards the front end of this video talking about confirmation page sequence videos and breakout videos. That guy, he was doing about 200k a month. Dude, that added $178,000 in revenue in a week and a half of being in the inner circle. Now, most of you sitting there at two to 400K a

month. That's still an unrealistic expectation for you. What's even more realistic are guys who join in where it takes like 2 to 3 months for them to make tens of thousands of dollars, as an example. And not everybody makes that money that fast. It's like I'd rather talk about the people who have more of like a mediocre and realistic result and I want to pepper in results that are on

both end of the spectrums in between. What people are looking for when they look at results is not best case scenarios. Usually they're looking for worst case scenarios about how they can get. Imagine as an example as an email subject line something along the lines of how we make this safe for you and you just have a whole email talking about people who whip with your

offer and what you did to help make it right. Okay? Like that's like I said that's where you could talk about your refund rate. That's where you can talk about your dispute rate. Like if I go as an example and I discuss some of the clients that we've had over the years as an agency. I'll give you a great example right now. We had a guy that we just took on about 2 months ago and all we

did for this guy was come in, launch a callunnel for him via paid ads. He refused to do a webinar. He refused to do low ticket to high ticket. He refused to do challenge funnels. This guy just wanted to do call funnels. And as a result of just wanting to do call funnels, this is a very very hot pressing issue for a lot of businesses that are organic only. They think that

something that works organically, they can just roll over to paid. That's not how it works. You got to roll over the full system to paid. You got to do all of what I'm discussing here, plus more in some instances, especially with very sophisticated demographics. We did our job really well. We brought in 130 qualified applicants who said, "I have $10,000 to invest into this offer." They

also said that they had the extra money that was needed to take action on what was taught in that offer. We had 166 applicants that were qualified in total, 130 of which booked calls. We spent about 40-ish grand in ad spend. The cost per booked call was in the two to 300s give or take the specific campaign and audience that we were testing. We we got great feedback from the sales team on

lead quality. We got great feedback on the fact people were coming through well framed from doing all these things we're discussing. But at the end of the day, their sales team, they only closed two people. Those two people resulted in about $20,000 in total revenue. They spent 40-ish,000 on ad spend. They spent about 15,000 on us. That puts them about 50-ishk in the hole with 20k in a return

minus commissions. They realistically were down about 40ishk. My point is what we did to make that right in that example is first of all, we just fired the client. We just said, "Look, your sales team sucks. We're not in the agency business to do deals with people that need to acclimate and learn to do better. We want to have hitter deals immediately because we get all our money

off revshares when we do an agency deal. So, what we chose to do in that example is we gave that client back their $15,000 and we made sure that we continued to support them without spending additional dollars to help make back that money they were in the whole lawn. In this particular instance, the point I'm trying to emphasize is I could talk about the deals that have spent 50K

in ad spend in the first 30 days and made $2.5 million in the first 30 days, but that happened once out of hundreds of deals I've done in my career. I could talk about the deals that have done millions of dollars a month that started at a couple hundred grand over a handful of months, but again, it's like those are bestase scenarios. What most people are looking for when they go to Yelp or

when they go on to some reviewbased platform like Trustpilot or Google reviews or just the reviews that you have in your business period is how could I get? Okay. So, as an example of a great value dense email sequence that helps build trust and and lifts the prioritization in this individual's mind, they get the right information and they say to themselves,

"That makes a lot of sense for me." and it addresses something that they genuinely give a about knowing, which in this case is safety and how they could get, plus all the other value dense emails that we recommend you make. But again, imagine you send up to six of these a day, which is what we currently recommend. I don't necessarily say you start with six a

day. You want to incrementally work your way up in the quantity of emails you send until you see a diminishing return in open rates. You also want to make sure you follow local applicable regulations and laws. TCPA guidelines, as an example, inhibit you from sending outside of a specific set of hours for the local time zones of individuals.

Same thing with California regulations, as an example. And of course, you Europeans watching this you guys got the GDPR over there and you know how strict that is. So, if you send up to six a day, make sure you work your way up to that and make sure you're following the time constraints that are necessary to not get fined. Okay. Now, at this point, you can imagine there's a

lot of information that you've successfully got off preall. Okay. Some of you guys, you believe in the logic. And this works for those that have monster sales teams that don't give a in the first place about whether people come through frame. Speed to lead, right? If you have a set of setters or closers that dial leads rapidly and are trying to close people

as soon as they come in, well, obviously they're not going to have the opportunity to go through this consumption process for just these two steps alone. Okay? And that's going to that's going to force your salespeople to have more education calls. Now, if you got a great sales team that doesn't give a about people coming through well-framed, then so be it. Go ahead and

try to reach out to them right away. when I have salespeople reach out. So, I want to be clear when I say this. There's kind of two things that happen in congruency at the same damn time as this. We will have the setters or the closers do some manual outreach. And with that manual outreach, there's really one simple goal. With the confirmation page best practices and

with the value dense email sequences and with this other step we'll talk about here in a moment, the hammer them content campaign, we have a disadvantage. With marketing, we're doing a spray and pray, you know? We're just trying our best to get the necessary information in front of people, but we don't actually know what information they actually need that's

going to make it a priority for them. We give them an overload of information. We give them a ton of extra Now, when we do that, again, it's a spray and prey. We're just trying our best to do as many things as we can. That way, we influence the sales process. What setters and closers can do with manual outreach is they can tailor all of this information for the person's needs. They

can look at the application data cuz let's be honest, your marketers, your the people in your business, they might get application data, but what's the probability that they're actually contextually communicating and tailoring information relative to a person's answers? There's a very low probability of that. So as a result, the salespeople pre-all, that's their number one

function and role is I need to get people tailored information. So if somebody says in their application a specific thing and the salesperson can look at that and say, "Well, damn, I got three videos that I think would crush for that person if I got them that information." It's like, great. Go grab those three things and send the person a selfie video. Pull out your

damn phone as a salesperson and say, "Hey, what's going on, man? saw you booked a call with us on Tuesday at 3 PM. I looked at your application data and I saw you said this, dude. I got three killer pieces of information that can help you right now get what you need. I got them in an SOP. I got them in videos and I got a gamma doc. Those are all the sales assets and trust

assets. Your sales people need to have a list of that they can send off to people that is organized. That way they can just go and copy and paste that and shoot it off ideally from an iPhone and or email. Both work great, but we don't want it to look autonomous. That's also why we want to do the videos. They do great at making sure you're not a robot. You understand? So, this happens

simultaneously once the confirmation videos get sent out. In addition to that, the other thing we're going to do at the same time is we are going to run the hammer them campaign. So, the hammer them campaign, for all those unfamiliar, we got plenty of videos on my channel.

You can go to my channel's homepage and I got a whole playlist dedicated to propaganda campaigns. This is an example of a propaganda campaign. We're going to take anywhere from 30 to 50 different pieces of short form and we're going to take anywhere from about 15 to 30 pieces of long form and we are going to hammer the out of somebody prior to them showing up to the call. We're going to

do this via social media retargeting. So, Facebook, Instagram, you can do this on Tik Tok with the vertical videos. You can also do this on YouTube. You could do it on LinkedIn. We typically do it on Facebook and Instagram more than anywhere else.

You're going to create a little pocket audience of people. Depending on the scale that some of you are operating at, you might have to add some supplementary audiences to what I'm about to discuss to have enough people to actually retarget aggressively. I like to do this specifically with an audience of people who just took an action prior to the sales conversion. So, as an example, I

need a 100 people minimum that are in an audience to retarget here. That realistically means I need about 150 people in order to successfully get 100 due to match rate issues. You're rarely ever going to have 100% match rate. So, if you only have 100 people, you likely aren't actually going to have the necessary quantity of people to see these campaigns have any reach at all.

You have to have the minimum quantity of people in here. So, as an example, if you have a call funnel, you need at least 150 people within 72 hours to be able to hammer the out of just those specific people. This is a 72-hour campaign. Our goal is to keep this content in front of them with a minimum frequency, ideally of 15 to 20. This 15 to 20 frequency is meant to have enough

impressions with unique pieces of content to be able to influence the person's psyche precall to get information in front of them that answers questions, frames them well, handles objections before they occur, sets proper expectations, and just again gets people necessary information that helps make it a priority. That's all it really is. So, long story short, with

the right content, with the right value dense email sequences, with sales people doing the right things pre-all, and with the best practices for our confirmation page videos, what we then do is we obviously funnel the person to the conversion event. So, at this point, this is where we want to officially funnel these individuals to the call.

Okay? So, at this stage, this is the best time where you're actually probable to have a sales conversation. Okay? Sales conversations do not occur if education is required. This is typically where people up. They don't give enough information prior to the call that the person consumes that actually makes an impact. So, they end up having education calls. As I said before,

usually what most people will do is they'll have the call booked and they'll jump straight over to the call happening. That's why you have the problems that you have. Treat it like your show rate problems, your closing rate problems, the lack of people willing to piff, your inability to close people in a tight time frame. All these are symptoms of a disease that's

happening in your business right now as a result of your failure to implement backend selling systems. Okay? I've originated this concept. I believe deeply in this concept and I've seen tremendous impact from this concept. I can't stress it enough. These specific things independently of each other can have huge impacts on revenue and these statistics that matter to you in your

current high ticket conversion mechanisms. It works for call funnels. It works for webinars. It works for challenge funnels. It works for low ticket to high ticket. It works for DM ads. Every common funnel that people run, it works tremendously well for. I'd love to see you implement these things.

Check out all the videos on my channel because I have so many videos that go indepth on each one of these topics. I just want to be fair though in saying this. This is really important you understand. I withhold about 90% of the that I actually can sit here and tell you and show you about these things cuz my goal is obviously to get you far enough along where you can see an impact

to be able to easily justify getting into my paid programs which you can find links for down in the description. take action on these with the surface level descriptions and explainers that I've just provided to you and you have a high probability to still get some kind of result that lets you see signs of life.

I understand everybody out there is full of and that you have low belief in people like me telling you that I have such great information and my paid stuff. So, my intention with all these videos on my channel is to bribe you. I want you to get a result with the stuff that I show you for free here on this channel. And I want you to be able to make some cash with it so you buy my

stuff with house money. Or I want these things to come off so obvious to you for the impact that they can create that you can easily justify getting into it even if you haven't got a result with it yet.

You and I both know the that we just talked about here makes sense. Don't be laxidasical or let your people be laxidasical and this up for you. This makes a huge impact in your business and there's a lot of money on the other side of this problem for you.

At the very least, subscribe to my channel, check out some of my other videos, and thank you very much for watching. Wish me a safe flight. I hope to make more of these for you soon. All right, go get red shipping.
