Here's 11 years of brutally honest feedback from what I've seen over my career that has absolutely people and things that have also really helped on the path to million-dollar months.

There are many things that help and there are many things that can harm you and you got to be cognizant of all those. If you're new to the channel, welcome in. That's all we talk about around here, hitting million-dollar months. And of course, if you're already a subscriber, welcome back. Either way, there's no earning potential, no income claims. We don't know who the you

are. We have no idea if you have any potential to go out there and hit million-dollar months. All we know are the lessons from people who have been there, done that that we're handing down to people like you here on YouTube. But again, there's no earnings potential.

There's no income claims. All we're doing is just handing down lessons in these little byite-sized clips on YouTube. So, welcome in. Pleasure to have you. Without further ado, let's dive into it. So, first things first, and this is really important you understand this, okay, you have to know when to adjust your risk profile. Okay, adjusting up is one of the most

important things that actually helps make a lot more money. When to adjust the risk profile can be determined by when you are able to successfully pull the money that you initially risked out and put it back into your pocket and start playing with house money from that point forward. Let's use the example that I have $50,000 in ad spend that I want to put into Facebook, Mr.

Zuckerberg's pockets over the following 30 days. Whether it be a webinar test, call funnel, whatever it is. I give Zuck $50,000 and it's $50,000 of my money. $50,000 that I risk that I pull out of my bank account and throw towards Zuckerberg's bank account instead. Okay, that is technically the highest risk scenario that we're in because it's our money that we're risking. Okay, once we

actually get to the point where the webinar goes well or the call funnel goes well and we simply generate a return on that cash, the most important thing that we need to acknowledge is that with the money that we technically profit it, okay, that is the money that we can more aggressively gamble with moving forward as we should. I'll give you a very simple analogy as an example.

If I invested into technically it's still an alternative asset, but I mean, hey, most of us have money in it. If I invested into something like Bitcoin, okay, that's arguably I don't necessarily know if it's safe or if it's smart for me to say that it's safe, but it's like the biggest one of all the cryptocurrencies that exist. That's technically the safest because that's

where the most money flows. If I got a return, okay, let's say that I invested $10,000 into Bitcoin. I returned $50,000. I sold $10,000 of it and I was able to put that back into my pocket after capital gains taxes. Now I've got $40,000 that I have free and clear. That would be a great time to go take that 40k and invest into butt fuckcoin or whatever else is out there. That's

obviously going to be much much higher risk. The reason I would do that in that example is because I'm technically playing with house money. When you walk into the casino and you bet $5,000 of your own money and you officially get it back on one of those blackjack hands and you put it back in your pocket, you're still left with 10 grand. You aggressively gamble what's left in an

attempt to turn it into far more money. The best part about business and the best part about advertising and having a true ATM profit center of a funnel or ideally set of funnels that are consistently turning your dollars into more dollars is that you have the ability to be in control of it. increase the probability of outcomes and returns being in your favor comparatively to

crypto or literal gambling at casinos in the two examples I provided to you. This is one of the best times and technically the most safe times to reinvest and take more aggressive actions. Okay, that's the part that most people really miss that either helps them a lot if they do do it successfully or that really holds back the revenue potential. It's just disassociating from the idea that the

profit that you initially generate is something that you should go and do something else with. Okay, it shouldn't have another purpose initially. It should be I need to take greater risks.

So, as a great example of that, let's use the example that you're phenomenal with call funnels, okay? And you consistently do extremely well there and you're kicking out tens of thousands or maybe even hundreds of thousands of dollars in profit per month out of your call funnels, right? You don't have to risk literally all of it, but siphoning off a good chunk of that and throwing it

towards webinars, throwing it towards a challenge funnel, throwing it towards low ticket to high ticket, or even just reinvesting it into generating far more calls and maxing out your closing team's calendar availability, hiring more closers, and then doing it again.

There are far greater ways to make far more money in far shorter durations of time by simply adjusting your risk profile. It is a mandatory characteristic and I've seen it play out so well when people do it and I've also seen it just detrimentally people and hold back their potential when they don't. One of the other things that's along the lines of that type of thinking

but a different lesson in itself is you have to avoid split testing your way to poverty. Okay, I get so many people like there was a guy in the inner circle joins in still with us today. He I can't remember a couple months back starts telling me he's at like a 40% margin. He has comparison bias and he's comparing his business to 80% margin businesses and he's like,

&gt;&gt; I don't really want to scale until I hit an 80% margin. &gt;&gt; And it was I was like, what the are you talking about? Like you're netting 40%. That's above average for any traditional business that exists. And &gt;&gt; he's like, yeah, you know, but I'm not really a traditional business, you know?

It's like I I compare myself to like XYZ. &gt;&gt; Comparison bias can you so hard. is a damaging thought to have to participate in comparison bias and prevent scale solely because you want to split test your way to an 80% profit margin and not spend more money to make more money while you're still at profiting 40%. I can't stress that

enough. It's like the other ways that this specific lesson of split testing your way into poverty presents itself is you're in the process of making turning dollars into more dollars. You're profiting. Okay? And I've seen people with phenomenal rorowaz like I've seen this happen to guys without exaggeration that are like 17 to1 rorowaz. Okay? and they do this thing where they're like,

"Oh, well, I started to scale and my rorowaz went from 17 to1 to 14:1, so I'm going to stop scaling. I'm actually going to pull back a little bit and instead what I'm going to do is I'm just going to split test my way back to a 17 rorowaz so I can scale and hold back." And it's like, dude, that's just not how it works. Okay, most people, they never do math. A core lesson is you obviously

have to do math. You just simply put when I say you have to do math, this is really just financially modeling out whatever funnels that you've got. Okay, financially modeling funnels, your ads, your sales process, that reveals to you how truly dumb it is in that specific example to be at a 17 to1 rorowaz, drop to a 14 to1 rorowz, and just stop spending more money. If you did basic

math, you'd reveal that if you spent a fuckload more money, you'd still make a fuckload more money. Likely in that scenario, even if you were at a 10 to one, you'd still make a fuckload more money net if you actually were able to spend and get off a lot more cash. Okay, one of the other big things like brutally honest marketing feedback I've seen that can really help or really hurt

somebody, believe it or not, an alternative lesson you might not be thinking with credit line. Okay, whether it's Facebook invoicing, whether it's literal credit cards, okay, whether it's just having access to more capital in real time when necessary. I have seen businesses where I I'll give you a perfect example. This literally just happened last month. We have a client

who had a million-doll Facebook invoicing credit line, okay? They spend about $500 to $600,000 a month. When you have Facebook invoicing, it operates on a net30. Okay, so they opted to accumulate about $995,000 of debt. Okay, I woke up one day, the ads manager just showed that $0 was being spent. I was like, hm, what's going on? Maybe there's a payment method

verification issue. Something's clearly happening. What could it be? I naturally navigate my way to the billing and payment section of the ads manager, and bang, I'm faced with a $995,000 bill, and it was on a Saturday. Okay.

The only way you can pay that is via wire. Wires won't process and pay until Monday. In addition to that, they generally take, and they claim this themselves, about 2 to 3 days for it to actually post to your invoicing amount.

Something as simple as not paying attention to how much total amount owed going towards Facebook invoicing. The cash was available. There was no issue with being able to pay it to be clear.

But due to the fact that they didn't pay it because it operated on a net 30 and nobody thought about it, now there was no ad spend going out for upwards of five full days. Well, five full days when you're spending5 to $600,000 a month. Do the math. It's a lot of money. It's tens of thousands of dollars in ad spend that's lost and it's literally in that example due to their

rorowaz hundreds of thousands of dollars in revenue loss. The sales people morale goes to near zero cuz they wake up going into Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday with literally zero calls in their calendar. Only followup. Okay. having access to credit lines. Like sometimes you'll get a financial audit from AMX and unless you have like Chase backup cards, City cards, like literally just

whatever credit line cards that you can make available to yourself. If you get financially audited by AMX and you're currently with the no preset spending limits and you get audited and they say, "Oh, now you got a hard credit limit on every single one of your cars that you have access to, you're cooked.

you're either going to have to cycle cash from your account to pay down those AMXs in a much shorter sales cycle or in a much shorter cash velocity cycle which could really harm your cash flow and your scale potential as a as a result of not having other credit available. Okay, so again make sure that you have credit lines, okay, and a lot of them at that credit lines give you the freedom to be

able to scale and expand, especially when you have favorable terms with the people that you have credit lines with. Okay. Time and time again, one of the other things that I see, and you've heard me say this if you've been a repeat viewer of my channel, I try to say it quite often because it's a very central belief of mine that has benefited me tremendously over the years

as a marketer. Okay? I do not want to be right. Okay? I just want to make money. That's it. Okay? I just want to get the results. That's all that I'm here to do. I have opinions. Okay? I have beliefs. I have things that I'll project onto what I'm doing that I believe are going to make things more probable to work. But when they're not working, I will detach from them and do literally anything else

that makes it more probable for me to get a result and an outcome. Okay? I will not stay attached to things that are inhibiting my potential and my expansion. Okay? I will change what I'm thinking in real time. Beliefs cause wars. Okay? Beliefs are what lead to all conflict. And you can have conflicting beliefs that can drive yourself into a terrible position when you stay attached

to specific beliefs. Okay, along that same line of thinking, over the last 11 years, I know this one's more of like a monk lesson, but it is so true when it comes to marketing. You must practice the art of detachment. Okay, when you become attached, and there's all kinds of things. It's like I've seen people that have a very profitable, let's say, webinar funnel and they've automated it

and it's just worked year in and year out and then all of a sudden there's just many months in a row where it's no longer working. Every CRO thing that they've done under the sun isn't having any positive effect on it. Just dies. And instead of rotating away from it, doing something else, becoming profitable elsewhere, they stay attached. And that attachment pulls a

lot of that profit that they've been able to accumulate right back into Zuckerberg's pocket. The art of detachment comes in many ways, shapes, and forms in advertising. It also comes with ad creatives. As an example, I've seen people that have killer ad creatives. So much so that they will never run an ad without that specific creative. And I come in and I'll teach

them something about ad fatigue where I'll say things like, "Look, I think that a great idea for you would be to have completely different creatives than what you've historically had. go out and film videos like this. Go out and make image ads like this. And when you relaunch your campaign, pull out every historical creative that ran and just launch it with these completely new

ones. Let's see what happens. And the people who do that, who practice the art of detachment, they typically see phenomenal results from overcoming ad fatigue in that specific way. It's also what Meta Andromeda, the new step one of the creative recommendation process in their algorithm that we have an entire video on dedicated here on this YouTube channel. That alone requires you to have

creative diversification. If you choose not to have a lot of creative well- diversified creative assets, you just have to increase the quantity exponentially of whatever creatives you currently have. They cite an example of 50 creatives a week as an example. 200 creatives a month. Here's my point. In either scenario, whether it be the ad fatigue protocol, whether it be dealing

with the best practices of Meta Andromeda, if you practice the art of attachment and you just stay latched on to these specific creatives that you are currently running that are inefficiently spending your dollars and driving up your cost per result and artificially lowering your rorowaz, you're self-inflicting financial loss. It doesn't make any sense. Okay. What you

must do when I say you have to practice the art of detachment, it's like you have to let go of the opinions. Okay? Try what you think is probable to work. Sure, I'm all for that. I do it all the time. But when something that I'm attempting to do doesn't work, I detach from it. When I am running something for a long duration of time and it is causing my spend to be

inefficient, I detach from it. When I have a funnel that is losing money for a sustained duration of time with so many different tests and best practices being applied to it and it's still not working, I'm not going to continue losing money. I'm going to detach from it. When I have somebody that was a core part of our business for a long time that all of a sudden is a and no

longer going to help the business drive more revenue and move forward, I'm going to detach from them. Okay. The art of detachment is what enables you to progress at a faster rate. And along that same line of thinking, we'll go into the next one here. The speed in which you solve problems directly dictates success. Okay? It dictates the speed of success. critical

missionritical lesson. So many I I look at it like this, okay, I'll give you a direct example with this literal facility that I'm sitting in right now. We acquired this about 3 weeks ago. We got it for our Jeremy's Inner Circle mastermind venue and we also use it as an office for the other 361 days of the year. It's incredible. Got a big 220in screen. I installed a baller sound

system. I redid the floors. Had to buy 150 chairs. I put up these random wall graphics that you may be able to see. I got a ping pong table, a pool table. I got four branded arcade machines. I got so much furniture for this place, coffee machines. Had to get some permitting issues resolved with the city for some violations as it related to my bathrooms. I had to get the roof redone.

I had to paint I had to paint a We're in Windwood here in good old Miami, Florida, and everything's graffitied and has a bunch of awesome murals. I had to hire a mural guy. I had to repaint the doors. I had to clean up the lot that we have. I'm likely going to have to refence the lot, run power to the gate of the lot. I'm going to have to redo the finish of the lot. I

had to pay for a dumpster. I had to do like so many little little things. Okay? So many things. And now here's the situation. Every single one of those problems was there for me to face either way. It was inevitable for me to come across every single one of these problems, right? And it's a self-determining approach to say what pace I want to deal with those problems.

They're all there no matter what. Okay? I do not want to deal with them over a broader duration of time. I'd rather stack them all up and deal with them in an extremely short duration of time.

Every contractor who was coming in here for repeat work or just their ongoing work that they needed to do. Even my neighbors in these fellow businesses alongside of me were like, "What the is going on over? You guys are going crazy. You guys are there's a rapid like you're just speeding through this Wow.

&gt;&gt; And I'm over here thinking to myself, I could go faster. I could get more things done. I'm pissed that XYZ of a contractor couldn't come on a specific day that I had a bunch of other people over here doing Now, here's the point I'm attempting to make. It's a choice to move at a faster pace. It's a choice to deal with all of the problems in a shorter duration of time and just

blitz through them and solve every one of them so I could get to the other side where it's usable for things like this, where it's usable for workshops I want to have here, where it's usable for my staff and myself to use as a office facility, where it's usable for our Jeremy's inner circle masterminds that we do every quarter that there's links for down in the description. I

can't stress enough in marketing, one of the silliest things is thinking that by choosing to deal with a specific problem at a very slow pace that you're just not going to have the other problems to deal with that follow up right afterwards.

The problems are all there. They're inevitable. Once you solve one, the next one immediately presents itself. The next quest is available to start. Okay? Why not quest stack? Why not just blitz through a bunch of at once? It is what dictates success, speed, and potential. It's why there's kids that are like 20 years old that you're sitting here watching run

circles around you. They solve the bigger problems that you're just choosing to go slow and lolly gag with. Okay? The people who have made so much more than you that continue to sweep you, they've just overcome the things and become aware of the things and problem solved the things that are just currently holding you back that you're tolerating. You got to

shorten your tolerance fuse. Okay, emotion is a tool. When you have whatever it is that you're currently facing and you become intolerable of it, being fed up is an emotion in itself.

It's this feeling of like, I'm better than this. I should be beyond this. This little thing shouldn't be holding me back. I deserve more. &gt;&gt; And that that like almost like disgust, right? That feeling that you can generate and just hold in your chest that drives the action cycle. Okay. the inspiration, the good, the positive emotions, the desire for more and for

better conditions that can be leveraged and held in your chest and used to create more momentum, more energy, more movement, faster cycle speeds. You understand? That's what's critical, okay? Is cycle stacking and rapidly moving through those cycles, okay? It dictates a lot. I will also close out with this and and maybe one or two more, okay? You don't know what you don't

know. There was during the crazy 9/11 attacks here in America a CIA director at the time who gets up in front of a bunch of journalists and the journalist they asked a point blank question. They were like, &gt;&gt; "How in the world did we not know that this was going to happen?" &gt;&gt; And the CIA director, he answered with this. He said, "In life, there's there's

three things. There's known knowns. There's the things that we know that we know. There's known unknowns, the things that we know that we don't know. And then there's unknown unknowns. The things that we literally don't even know that we don't know. And then he goes on to say this was essentially an unknown unknown. Okay. In scaling up a business, okay, treating yourself like a computer,

updating your software, trying to consume more data, okay, and the right data at that unlocks new ways to think, okay, you don't know what you don't know. And it's that simple. Okay? Don't over complicate it further than that.

When you know more stuff, you have a higher probability to think with more solutions, better solutions. You have the ability to go into a group of people and get a perspective. Okay? Try to get a set of views that either validates what you're thinking is accurate, true, and a great decision or give you some additional information and insights that you're just not thinking with currently.

This is a very important distinction. I've seen over the years from all the people that we've worked with that have cracked these million-dollar months and beyond. These people, they relentlessly pursue new data in all shapes, forms, and sizes. Nowadays, a lot of it is through LLMs and AI tools. There's a lot of it that's still consumed in traditional mechanisms like books like

you right here right now on YouTube watching things like this, okay? courses, masterminds, mentors, no matter what it is, even just conversations with great people, industry events, whatever it is, the pursuit of additional information loads you up with new ways to think and it gives you new creative options. The other big hack for this, and this is really important to

understand, this is one thing that I've seen as a great pro tip over the years. Other people have accumulated data for very specific things and compounded it to a point where you likely will never catch up to all of the specific things that they've chosen to learn. Okay? And no matter what you specifically spend in terms of time, you likely just won't catch up to certain people that you can

just bring into your business to provide insights and perspectives. And so one hack that a lot of the bigger people use is they will hire people who are experts who have spent that time who have accumulated that experience doing things that they want to do themselves. And they'll hire these people for the perspective that they can provide. Even if the perspective does something as

simple as validating what they're currently doing or what they currently know. A lot of the times though it's not just that. By by far it's not just that. Most of the time it's all of the things that you don't know. the other person can look, analyze quickly, deploy information that makes very rapid results in a great direction and a solid set of momentum possible for you. That's

why you constantly see me here. If you're new to this channel, this would be your first time hearing this. Of course, if you're a repeat viewer, you're going to hear it again. You constantly hear me talk about how great this channel can be for your growth and for your momentum and for your success potential. You'll also constantly hear me talk about the courses, the

information, the education company offers, the marketing agency offers that we have in the links down in the description. Like Jeremy's inner circle, I do one-on-one calls. I do weekly group calls. I do quarterly in-person masterminds. And you could see how serious I take this. This isn't like some sitting here selling you a side piece course income.

I have an education company, okay? And I take it serious. I invest into my people. I love my group, okay? of a very active community of rich people trying to get a fuckload richer. We have an extensive course library that we consistently update. We have Jeremy AI that gives you real-time access to every single thing I've documented and trained on for you to be able to chat back and

forth with in real time. We have custom AI develop softwares and tools for all kinds of individual use cases that we provide to those members. We have an extensive ongoing updated SOP library that you can feed into LLMs to make things faster for you and obviously read through them yourself and give them to your staff. Also have my programs like my master internet marketing offer. It's

a 7week live class that we teach live once a year. You buy it any other time, you get access to the previous cohorts recording immediately. It's always up-to-date information. That's why we do it every year. When something changes and there's a significant enough amount of things that change, we redo literally the entire client. Okay? It's extensive.

You can preview the first week of that 7-week class down in the description. There should be a link for that if you want to check it out as well. The point I'm trying to make is is the people who have made the most that we've worked with over the years, they don't just necessarily want us to do it. They want to learn how to do it, too. They want to learn what we're doing. They want the

awareness as well because it unlocks new ways for them to creatively think and it helps drive the results of the business to a much greater place. Okay, can't stress this enough. There's a tremendous amount more that I could sit here and go on and on and on about, but I don't want to sit here and consume all of your time. These are very high impact lessons that I've sat here and provided to you,

but again, there's so much more, but I'll leave those for the paid programs that we have. Go check out some of my other YouTube videos on this channel. They're all very welloriented towards you making a lot more, becoming more aware. They're all very specific things that you must know on your journey on trying to crack million-dollar months or add that next million a month to what

you're already doing. So, go get richer and go consume some of those other videos. And when you're ready, check out those links down in the description. Talk soon.
