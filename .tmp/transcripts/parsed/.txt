Welcome back to the series. In this video, we're going to be talking about how to execute the pitch in a challenge funnel or a 3-day virtual event, whichever one you are committing to. The pitch is the exact same in both of these scenarios. The pitch is obviously where you're going to make all the money on the entire risk of this whole thing. This is where it all pays off.

And there are very strategic things that you must do outside of actually executing the pitch itself from pre- pitching, repitching, and also just pitching long enough, having some objection handlers and risk reversals dialed in, not doing stupid things like the super inflated prices and slashing them out and saying you get it all for less. It's all kinds of little things

that you're going to learn in this video about how to properly execute the pitch itself during one of these virtual events. It's an absolute pleasure to have you here. If you're new to the channel, all we do around here is talk about hitting million-dollar months.

Welcome in. There's no income claim. We have no idea who the you are. And although, yeah, everybody that we've worked with has made a buttload of money off of these types of funnels. Who the knows if you're going to make a buttload of money off these types of funnels. So, there's no implied earning claims, earning potentials, or anything like that. It's all for entertainment,

education purposes, you sitting here watching this video right now. And of course, if you're already a subscriber, welcome back. Absolute pleasure to have you. We got another banger. So, without further ado, let's dive in. If you're used to pitching on webinars, you're going to have a good time when you pitch in a virtual event. Keep in mind, ideally, up to this point, you followed

our 3-day format and you had day one, which was just a fuckload of content. You've delivered on the promise of the topic of your virtual event. You've given people a tremendous amount of value. So much so that a very high quantity of those people who showed up on day one also showed up to day two.

You've now for the entire first half of day two given them another amount of tremendous value. Given them content, maybe brought in a guest speaker here and there that endorses whatever you're about to try to pitch people on, and you're getting to the point where you're ready to do the pitch. What's the first thing you ideally do? The pre- pitch.

So, to be clear, pre- pitch material is really important to understand. First of all, on this channel several times over, we've shouted out the legend, the one and only Mr. Myron Golden. Myron, if you've ever had the opportunity to pay him tens of thousands of dollars or maybe more to have the opportunity to learn from him directly, good for you.

I'd encourage everybody who hasn't gets the opportunity to do so. He is true top 1% in terms of people that I've ever learned from and his pre- pitch and rep pitch material, some of which we'll talk about here today. I'll leave the great stuff for Myron, of course, and all our inner circle members and master internet marketing students. But nonetheless, I'll still put you on game in terms of

what it is and how it works. The pre- pitch when I first heard it come out of Myron's mouth made so much sense to me. And rather than just sitting here telling you about every single thing that you could say, I'm going to tell you to go watch a few of Myron's videos.

There's one specifically on YouTube that you can watch. It's about 30 minutes long from him on his channel. It's called The Science of Rapid Wealth Creation. And this is a perfect example, again, free on YouTube for people to go and consume that talks about essentially everything that Myron does before actually pitching people. All pre- pitching really is trying to weave in

specific ways that you want people to strategically be thinking. You're trying to frame people. That way, by the time you get to the pitch, you have all of these specific stories that you can anchor back to that had specific characteristics, identity traits, ways to think, and ways to process all this information. Things like being willing to take risk when it makes sense to take

risks. things like being able to bias towards a willingness to get richer because you deserve to get richer. Little things like the ability to overcome fearful thinking. He'll even go as far as weaving in religious scripture into what he's communicating to people during his pre- pitch. He's doing is very important to understand. He's empowering somebody prior to actually

pitching them. So, they get to the point where they strategically conclude to, &gt;&gt; well, this makes a lot of sense and I'm primed and ready to do something. And then that something is what you immediately pitch afterwards. So again, I just want to be really clear and saying pre- pitch is you being able to successfully frame somebody. You're trying to align the character, okay? The

ways in which you want them to identify and be and behave to the pitch. Okay? And you also want to make sure you understand this is mainly done through storytelling, which you'll see at a masterful level of display inside of that video from Iron on YouTube. And again, if you watch that video with the frame of like you're watching him do something that he would regularly pre-

pitch, you'll get a completely different set of value from it. Everything that he says is also awesome. By the way, all those things in that video are still great to actually think to be clear. But in addition to that, more importantly, you're going to watch it from the perspective of like, all right, I need to do this kind of before I actually pitch somebody. Your pre- pitch

session is generally about a 30 45 minute session. And to the viewer, it comes off as like mentality content, you know, something that you're trying to help people with. They'll still view it as good information. They won't get turned off. They won't have any idea that you're necessarily even sitting there trying to like pre- pitch them.

They just view it as like, "Oh, this is another content session and it's really good." Now, to be clear, once you get over the pre- pitch hump, that's where you actually transition into the pitch.

Now, let me be really clear when I say this. I learned this one from Mr. Russell Brunson. Russell Brunson obviously almost every single one of you know, but for those of you who for some reason do not, Russell is an absolute OG marketer. Highly respect Russell and everything that he does. Shout out to Clickfunnels and everything that they do over there. Specifically 1.0. I love I

love 1.0 a lot more than 2.0 Russell. But anyway, long story short, let me be clear. Okay, Russell has what he calls the ask to pitch transition. Okay, you need some kind of bridge to successfully go from over here where you're doing the pre- pitch, which doesn't come off like you're pitching. It just comes off like content. You need to have that bridge successfully to get to the point in a

non awkward way with low friction. And that's where this transition comes in that Russell teaches. So, he essentially says that you ask for the pitch. You just ask them for the opportunity to start the process of closing them. And it works so well when you deploy it in webinars. It works so well in this use case when you're doing a challenge funnel or a virtual event. The

transition is really simple. All you do is ask. So, I'll put it on display for you here right now. Right? Imagine you just got to the end of your pre- pitch session and you're ready to transition and you say to the audience, "All right, everybody. I'd love the opportunity to sell you something. I have ways to help you far beyond than what I've done here today. And I would love your permission

to do so. I don't want to force anything upon you. I don't want to make it sound like I'm just here to sell this. I want you to give me permission to transition to the point where I can help you further through an offer that I've put together specific to you that I believe is going to take everything that we've sat here and talked about today to that next level and get you that next set of

results that you're looking for in a much faster way in a lot easier way from all the resources, systems, content that I put together. The system, I want the opportunity to actually sell it to you guys. Now, can you guys do me a favor?

Can you say yes in the chat if you're open to the opportunity? And you're ideally just going to see a flood of yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Or you can tell them like, hey, put a one in the chat if you guys want that opportunity. You know, put a two in the chat if you don't. And again, it's always going to be a fuckload of ones if if you've actually executed the event

successfully up to this point. And then it becomes super simple. This what I love about this specific tactic. It becomes so simple to just immediately start transitioning to the slides where you're like, "All right, then let's dive into it." So, let me show you guys what I put together for you. And rather than just immediately saying like this is the price and this is like the offer stack,

like that's not specifically what you do. So once you get to the point where you're in the actual pitch itself, usually what you're going to want to start with, you're not going to use all of your anchoring, okay? But you're going to start with anchoring back to specific things that you've talked about strategically up to this point throughout the day and a half. Because

keep in mind, you're doing this on day two. You're doing the pitch on day two. strategically every single thing that you talked about in day one and everything you talked about in that first like half to 1/3 or sometimes 2/3 of the day on day two that's what you want to anchor back to originally. So, you want to say things like, "So, hey, if you guys remember, like we started

day one by going through this, okay? And I taught you guys how to do this, and if you go do that and this, it's going to roughly take you about this amount of time on average, and about this amount of work for you to go and do those things." And again, you guys are more than enough equipped to be out there doing those things and getting those results and outcomes. But, just keep in

mind, you're going to have to do like all these things, and you want to list them like bullet point style. You don't really want to get too in the weeds when you say these things. What you're trying to do is so you strategically understand what's happening. You're trying to bias towards the things that I've taught you are effective. They're going to work, but they're not necessarily the most

efficient way to get things done because you still don't necessarily know all of what there is to know. And I have this system I could sell you that's either got these done on your own, done with you, done for you components that I just simply haven't covered here or I haven't made available to you and obviously you'd need to pay for. And what those things do is they make things go faster.

They make things more efficient. they increase the probabilities that much more that you get these outcomes and these results. And that's the main thing that you're trying to do when you go through this process. You're like, "Yeah, so you remember these things that I talked to you about about this and and those things to be clear. If you go do those things, like they get you these

kinds of outcomes, okay? And when you go do that, to get those types of outcomes, you just got to keep in mind you have everything you need to be able to go do it, it's just going to take like these expectations." Okay? Now, comparatively, what I'm going to offer you as one of the components, this is how you do your offer step. as one of the components that I've got today in this special

offer for you. And by the way, I'm doing this offer one time. I'm doing it right now for you guys. The cart closes at the end of this whole virtual event that we have. We're going to give you 24 hours after the event concludes. We want decisive people in this. We have a dramatically high probability to get the results and outcomes that we're after here. Okay. So, the first thing I'm

going to do inside of my offer for you is I'm going to give you this and this thing does that at this set of expectations. Now, all you're doing is you're starting to say, "Look, the things I've taught you, they do these expectations, right? These outcomes, the things that I want to sell you now, right, for the upsell, they do these things that you want at these better

expectations." Okay? And that's the whole flow when you're doing the offer stack. So no matter how many things and it's very important you understand like the actual offer itself is really important obviously like the offer is made up of components that get them every ideal outcome they want right and that's all you're actually selling to somebody. So as an example like for our

Jeremy's inner circle program that we have we have masterminds four times a year we have one-on-one calls up to twice a month we have our weekly group call the most recent one we did here in the office it was 2 hours long it was extremely valuable. Okay, I know it sounds biased because I'm the one who taught the class, but it was it was really good. Okay, it's really good.

They're all really good. They're awesome. It's built for rich people trying to get a fuckload richer. We have an extensive course library. We have unlimited access to Jeremy AI for all our inner circle members, which is trained on a bunch of stuff you'd never get access to, like one-on-one calls, like you'll never hear anybody else's one-on-one call, but the topics and the

content that I talk about in one-on-one calls, those are all trained in Jeremy AI. Every consulting call, same thing. Every client call, same thing. Every single thing I've literally ever written down, including like messages with people, all in there. Okay, it's really good in that regard and it's it's not like some little AI thing and it gives you real-time access to my

brain to talk about things that you know you want to talk to, right? The one thing that it's not good at is if you're talking about something, real Jeremy can tell if you actually need to know something else. AI Jeremy will just talk to you about whatever you're talking to it about. It doesn't necessarily know when to say, "Well, you should focus on this instead." Like this is what you

need to pay attention to, right? Because at the end of the day, it's an LLM. But again, all those components, okay, and more. We have like 30 plus SOPs and we continue to develop more of course and no we don't use AI slop to write our SOPs like I write extensive SOPs that are very well good very well documented and we have an extremely active group chat full of rich people

trying to get a fuckload richer. Now we have people in that offer stack. It's very important you understand this right outside of the fact that yes I'm actually trying to tell you about that and pitch you links down in the description. I'm also trying to give you an example. These offer components aren't random. I didn't select them out of thin air and say this is

going to be my offer. No, it's like masterminds have extreme value. Okay, I believe in the power and so do everybody who comes to these masterminds in meeting up with a bunch of other rich people who do like something similar to you or literally what you do or sometimes like far from what you do but they still make a fuckload of money doing it and can give you a counter

perspective. I always look at it like this like if there's a bunch of dots of things you know like masterminds will help you validate certain things that you know and expand them further beyond that little area. But sometimes you meet people at a mastermind with a dot that's like way over here and then you start to build another little dot matrix and eventually like you get a nice little

bridge and you've expanded your overall awareness. That's how I look at what masterminds are are able to do in addition to just like when you're rich you got to you got to pay to have a lot of other rich friends. You know rich people need an opportunity to meet up with some kind of incentive. And rarely do they ever just sit around and hang out and you know have like normal

friends. I'm not saying we don't have normal friends. Like of course we have normal friends, but you don't really see your normal friends as much as you do with like business acquaintances. Like there's a lot of people who arguably come to these masterminds and develop stronger relationships with those people comparatively to people that they've known their whole life and like barely

ever meet because there's no real incentive to meet. You understand what I'm saying? So anyway, long story short, I digress. Masterminds are valuable. And some people are in the group literally just for masterminds. Some people don't go to any masterminds and like they just do one-on-one calls with me because that's a very cost-effective way to get one-on-one time with me. Some people,

they don't even show up to a live weekly group call, but they watch every recording, and they don't even do one-on-one calls unless they know they need something specific that they didn't understand. I have people in there who send upwards of 4 to 5,000 messages a month to Jeremy AI. And like, that's one of the places, that's the only place that we offer unlimited access to it

currently. Okay? And again, my point is is like all these offer components that I'm talking about, they solve specific problems in different speeds of solving them and in different preferred consumption mechanisms of solving them.

So when you make your offer stack and you actually go to pitch it, what you're trying to do is you're trying to say, okay, these are the ideal outcomes that I know people want. And what I've taught in the challenge itself are how to get those ideal outcomes in ways just like I do here on YouTube, guys. Like literally, my entire YouTube channel is a perfect demonstration of this, okay?

I'm giving you things to do. I had a guy just the other day, he tweeted me. He goes, "I made $100,000 a month." He got to 100K a month is what this guy claims. And again, this is unvalidated. We have no idea if this guy's actually telling us the truth or not, just to disclose.

But this is what he says on Twitter. He says, "Dude, I watched Jeremy Hayes YouTube content. I got to 100K a month without ever paying the guy." And like, that is if that's true, of course, that is literally what I attempt to make my content for. So, I attempt to help you guys get richer, but I openly disclose like I hold back a lot of that if you pay me to help you with, I'll get

you there a lot faster. I'll give you way more information and I'll give you a lot of different ways to consume and execute on that information. You understand? Like here on YouTube, it's just in the way that I present it to you because you're not paying any money for it. And with a challenge funnel, with a 3-day virtual event, whichever you choose to do, people are paying ideally

some ticket price, but some people do it for free. And again, it's the exact same logic. It's like you're giving them things that they could do to help get outcomes, but you're openly disclosing just like I am right now that I'm withholding a lot of what I could tell you. So, you pay me, right? And if you literally tell people that and what you gave them for free was good, there's a

high probability that they'll pay you for more, which is exactly what people do all the time here with us on YouTube as an example. Right? So, again, my point is is it's the same thing in the challenge. you're like in full understanding of all the outcomes that people want, okay? And you have an offer stack that helps people achieve those outcomes in a more efficient way and

with a bunch of different ways to achieve those outcomes, right? And then your offer, that's all your offer is, is that right there is taking specific ways that you can help people and get those outcomes and bundling them together in an offer that align to their ideal outcomes. That's it. That's all the offer is. and you're anchoring. Okay, so I taught you guys this, so you can do

this. But in my offer, I've got this that I've put in there, which you would agree, like if that's your preferred way to go about getting this result, like dude, that's going to help a lot. And by the way, it does these expectations and it does them even better than what just this stuff I've already covered with you here is going to do for you. You understand? It's like, guys, as an

example, literally right now, I sit here and film this video. I have a handful of people right now that pay us for consulting deals just on challenges alone, just on just on challenge funnels, just on virtual events. They have one coming up. They want to make sure that they absolutely crank the out of that revenue that comes from it, and they don't want to anything up.

So, they hire us. We come in, we teach them how to do everything. And I'll tell you with 100% certainty that I tell those guys, I tell my inner circle members, I tell even my master internet marketing students 80 to 90% more than what I'm sitting here yapping about with you right now. Because guess what? I'll give you a perfect example. Everything that I'm telling you right now how to

do, I'll give them literal examples of it. I'll say, "Here's a challenge funnel recording that you can go watch of somebody executing this that did like $4 million on a challenge." You understand?

It's like I'll give them an SOP that's 134 pages. I'll give them access to Jeremy AI. I'll give them access to a group chat that has dozens of other people that have done challenges that they can ask questions to in there as well to get more than just my perspective. I'll give them the opportunity to meet with those people in person up to four times a year at a

location with great food and other great people and a bunch of fun things to do that you'll never get the opportunity to use. But hear me out, right? You're still getting value from what you're sitting here consuming. You understand?

You're still understanding like technically what to do. I haven't held back on you and and like not disclosed what you need to technically go do, but I haven't given you a bunch of other things that would make a lot more sense to have. You understand? And that's what gets people to buy. That's what you've got to successfully do when you do the pitch itself. Okay? So, all you're doing

at this point, moral of the story, is you're anchoring. You're saying, "I've gotten you this level of result potential with what I've already sold you that we're sitting here talking about right now. But if you buy this offer, I've put this in that offer that gets you these results in this way." and it does these expectations even better because it's in the offer, right? And

I'm going down my list until I get to the end of the offer. Then I introduce the price and I say, and by the way, just to be clear, I think it's extremely fair to say that with everything that I've got in the offer itself, that I could easily charge a lot more than what I'm going to sit here and charge you guys now. Okay? Because the result potential, because of what we've been

able to successfully do with others that have already gone out there and achieved these results, we definitely know with certainty that we could charge more. But I want to be clear, like I do want to reward you guys. I think it's extremely great to see that you have the discipline to sit here. You clearly have the willingness and the high desire to go out there and get these results. And

look, man, I don't want to you. I want to give you guys a good deal and I want to help you out as much as possible. Our goals when we work with people is to flip the spectrum as fast as we can to get the you're me spectrum in your favor as fast as possible. Okay? And so, long story short, the price that we're going to charge for this is and then you drop the

price. Now, at this point, very important to note, relative to what the price is determines whether you're going to do a direct to checkout or whether you're going to do a book a call. Okay?

And with the opportunity to do a book a call specifically, you're going to do it in layers. Okay? And same thing with the direct to checkout. You're going to do it in layers in terms of how you pitch.

I'm going to explain both for you right now so you can thoroughly understand it. Let's start with the direct to checkout. So if you have a price that for a challenge or a 3-day virtual event is about $7,500 or less, you can get away with direct to checkout. It's going to be a little scary if you go above $6,500. I know it doesn't sound that much of a difference like $6,500 versus

$7,500. Jeremy, you're telling me that's going to me and like lower my overall checkout rate because I went up a,000 bucks. Yeah, it does. It makes a big difference, especially depending on if you're selling to the general public or if you're selling to rich people. So anyway, you start though by just saying, "Look, here's the price. Here's the link. For those of you who are ready, go

buy it now." So again, that's the directed checkout route. And at that point, you're going to sit there and you're going to start doing some objection handling and you're going to start doing some risk reversals. Okay?

Very self-explanatory for objection handling. It's very important that you like frame this properly to understand like truly how easy it is. Okay? When you're in real life and you're selling somebody or when you're on the phone and you're selling somebody, you get the opportunity to have a back and forth and you've heard or observed from monitoring all your salespeople's calls what

specifically comes up as objections. I'm sure you're hyper aware of that if you're the right type of person sitting here watching this channel, right? It's a low probability that you're guessing.

It's a high probability that you're just looking at data and saying, "Well, this is always what comes up." Now, that's what you want to start working through. Okay? All this is when you do this virtual pitch and you don't get the feedback of like back and forth objections like you would in a real life sales process. Your job is to go through every objection that could come up and

riskreverse them. Okay? Either overcome them or riskreverse them. Okay? So moral of the story is you drop the price. You say, "Hey, go check out by the way, let me just cover a few things that commonly come up that hold people back from doing these deals. Objection one, this is how we overcome it. Objection two, this is how we overcome it. By the way, some people view it as risky. We reduce that

risk by doing this instead." Right? and you go through as many as you have to go through. Okay. Now, what you want to do at this point is after you've gone through all those objections, you want to drop the price to whatever is the next option for people to buy, which might be a payment plan option. So, that first link that you would drop, no payment plans, none of that It's

all direct PIFFs, okay? PIFFs only on the first link. Pay in fulls, direct to checkout, nothing else on that page, dude. Okay? And after you go through all those, you want to drop that same link again. You want to be like, "Look, by the way, for all those you ready to move forward again, here's that link." Okay? And again, same pay and full link that you they drop right then

and there. Now, after that, okay, what you're going to do is you are officially going to introduce the payment plans, but you're going to give a little bit of time in between that last PIFF link drop and when you drop the payment plan link.

That way, those people can check out. So, you're going to say, "Okay, now I know a few of you, you just got to make sense of the money." All right? You know, you want it. You know you want the outcomes. You know you want the offers.

you know, this makes sense for you, but the money's holding you back. And so, let me help you make sense of doing a payment plan with us. We got a bunch of different ways to do this. And then you pitch the payment plans. So, whether that's internal payment plans like internal split pays, or whether that's all these softwares and tools and financing companies that offer

payment plan options nowadays, you're going to pitch all of them pretty much. You're going to say, "Look, you can do this financing option. Here's their average interest rates." And and just to be clear, you always when you start talking about interest rates and payment plans, you want to make sure you frame it. You want to be like, "Look, look, some of you guys might be scared to go

into debt, right? Let me tell you about the differences between good debt and bad debt." Okay? And then moral of the story, you go back to pitching how to make sense of the money. And then what you'd obviously want to say is, "Look, guys, you go to car dealership. Do they just gamble everything on one financing company?" Sometimes, you know, if you get approved with the first one, maybe

they don't spam you to like 40 other ones. But here's the thing, guys. We don't have 40 options. We have, you know, three or five or two. What we'd encourage you to do is go apply with each one of these and see what they'd approve you for and just move forward with whichever one has the best option for you. Okay, super pro tip, by the way. If I introduce a price and I leave

the answer to a simple like yes or no, I got a 50/50 shot of getting a yes or a 50/50 shot of getting a no. If I introduce, let's say, the pay in full, the payment plans, and I have like three options for my payment plans. Just when I get to the payment plan portion of the pitch, I've got like the internal payment plan and I've got like the PIFFs that are going to pay me like a little

less but fund that individual and put them on a payment plan with potential clawback clauses depending on which financing party you use. That reduces the no significantly. So if I give them four options as an example, three of which are yes to me and one of which is a no. That reduces my no from 50% to 25% in that example and it gives me a 75% chance for a yes. And that's what we're

looking for here. You understand? So again, make sense of the money. Drop sell it. get to the point where you do the next part which is the rep pitch which again put a pin in that I got to justify the book a call part of this process and then we'll get to that last section which is the rep pitch. So moral of the story once you get to the point again where you're in your pitch you're

ready to officially make the call to action for people to buy but you're going to do a book a call instead of a direct to checkout because your price is higher than the threshold where it makes sense to do a direct to checkout.

There's a few ways you can do this. Okay, I would encourage you follow what I'm going to talk about here. Number one, you do a pitch with the call, but a deposit to book the call. Okay? So, we have clients, they'll sell something for like 9,000 to 20,000 plus dollars, and they'll tell people things like, "Look, guys, you're going to you're going to have the opportunity now to book a call

with their team where we're going to go through any questions that you have. We want to give the opportunities though to the people here with us right now that are the most serious about doing this." Okay? We are going to now give you the opportunity to book a call. However, we are going to allow the serious people to book calls first. Okay? So, if you're serious, here's what we're going to do.

You know this is for you. You know you want to buy it. There's a very high probability you're going to buy it at the very least. So, you lock in this opportunity. Go ahead and book your call time, but you'll notice we're going to request X amount of dollars out of the total amount of dollars that the offer costs. Okay? If for some reason you get on that call and you determine it's not

for you, whatever, we'll refund the deposit to you. It's a deposit after all. We'll also give you the opportunity, by the way, in the instance, this is like a total side note, you don't have to openly pitch this, but you can if you want, just to make sense of the deposit more. Depends on how you want to do it. Again, it's a preference based on the buying

demographic that you have there. By the way, we're going to give you the opportunity where look, if if it if the main offer doesn't make sense for you with that deposit money that you put, we have this dropell offer, which we'll tell you about on the call. I'm not going to sit here and talk about it now.

But look, few options. We'll just refund your money. You walk away. It's a deposit after all. or we can just credit your money towards this other offer instead, which again we'll talk to you about on the call if you're having trouble making sense of the 9K. So, if you want a priority slot on the calendar, you want to be able to talk to us ASAP, like I'm talking like later

today, tomorrow, the next day, like you want a priority slot on the calendar, go book your call time, pay your deposit, that deposit gets credited towards the total amount that you're obviously going to buy for. We'll make sense of the money on the call, whether you're doing a paying full, a funding option, like we've got all those things. We'll talk about it on the call. Just go book your

call now. Go ahead and take action. Here's the link. Bam. And same exact logic. You do the objection handling. You do the risk reversals. And you get to the point where you're like, repitch, go book your call. Here's the deposit link again. Then you start to say, and by the way, for those of you who are having a little trouble either, hey, maybe you need to make sense of the

money, payment plans, financing options, go book your call with the deposit, right? Do that final go book your call with the deposit. And then you want to close it out by saying, "Okay, so for those of you who know you still want to book a call, but you still have too much fear and uncertainty to make you put that deposit down. I'm going to allow you the opportunity to book a call, but

I just want to be fair, right? I I openly disclosed all the people who book with a deposit, they get the opportunity to book first. Those are our priority calendar slots. Those of you who are not ready to put a deposit down yet, but again, you know, this is right for you, but you have some questions that hold you back enough to not even have the willingness to put a deposit down,

right? So therefore, you kind of want to push this out a little further, which I wouldn't encourage. You know, I would absolutely encourage use that link to book a deposit and get your call with the priority. Show yourself you're committed to this, right? Again, it's refundable either way. There's no risk in doing that. We will give you your money back. Look, guys, if you don't

even trust us enough to give you your money back after you make a deposit if it truly doesn't make sense, that way you can get a priority calendar slot. Why are you even still sitting here?

Right? If you don't trust me that that much, don't even sit here, you know, just leave now, right? We want to we want to show you that you are the person that holds you back or moves you forward. And this is great opportunity to show yourself that you're serious about getting these outcomes and results you're after. But again, if you're not right and you and you're still on the

fence and you and you you truly just again don't want to throw the deposit to book the call at a priority rate, we can book you in 5 days from now through like maybe 10 to 15 days from now. Okay? no cost to be able to book those calls.

Here's that link. And then again, all kinds of objections for a more skeptical demographic with risk reversals geared more towards the skeptical demographic. And then repitch both links. Again, for those of you who know you want a priority slot, deposit booking link. For those of you not as serious, you know, you just you just scared, you know, you don't necessarily want to use the

deposit link. Boom. Go book your call anyway. Talk to us. Book your call either way. Right? Those are the two ways that you're going to do your pitch. Now, at this point, it's very important to note you can do there's two things when I say repitch, right? There's the Myron Golden Pitch, which I've talked about in other videos here on the channel when we talk about the outline

of the three days. You're going to start your third day of content with a literal repitch, like a Myron Golden rep pitch. When I say repitch in this context right now, I'm not talking in the context of like the Myin Golden Repitch. I'm literally just talking in the context of like, look, as soon as you get through all that you're going to go back and go repitch the whole thing. Okay?

I've talked about this on this channel a lot. It's like as an example with this iPad here. Okay, you see what you see, okay? And I know what you see right now because I know what an iPad is. So, I'm going to describe it for you, right? You see some little like metal things over here that like maybe you don't know what the that is. You see some writing.

You see an Apple logo in the middle. You see some cameras and a flashlight. Like you see whatever colors you see. Well, on my end, I see something totally different, right? Like I see a screen and I see writing and and it's totally I see a black border, you know, and what looks to be maybe a camera. like my angle compared to your angle are totally different when we look at this thing.

Okay? And so when you very first pitch something, it's very important to note like you're initially pitching this perspective of the thing that you're pitching. Okay? And when you do the rep pitch, your repitch, you're trying to pitch them a totally different angle on the same thing. So when you go back and you do your repitch, by the way, mastery level I'm sitting here putting you

on game two right now. Okay? Mastery level Like for you to this up somehow, you'd have to be pretty close to the IQ of a rock. Okay, these challenge funnels in these 3-day virtual events absolutely rip when it comes to revenue potential. And I can't stress enough. I have examples I can show you this. I have massive SOPs I can sit here and send to you that go indepth on all

of this. And I have so much more information than what I'm even sitting here talking about right now that I can put you on game to. Check out the links in the description. Like especially on something like this. A challenge funnel is insane. 3-day virtual events are insane for the revenue potential they have. There's never been an easier way to justify being able to afford easily

and immediately flip the spectrum. Like, we get it, guys. As soon as you pay us, we're you, okay? We have to get you your money back and we have to make you far more than what you're ideally paying us for you to truly be satisfied.

We understand, right? We're you initially. This, as an example of a funnel type, is one of the easiest possible scenarios for you to immediately flip that spectrum back. And we do so, by the way, with things that don't even require this level of commitment to be able to make your money back. We had a guy join in the other day. His name's Gian. Shout out to Gian

if he's watching this. He joinsed into the inner circle. His cost per call was in the 300s when he joined in. I taught him a bunch of stuff as it related to Meta Andromeda and all the best practices of campaign structure for his callunnel messaging best practices. Bro, this lower, he's an inner circle member. This lowered his cost per call down into the low 200s. Okay, the

math played out to where what he paid for his first month of being a part of the group, he needed like low30s. I think it was like 32 or 37 calls to be able to and again, he's going to get those calls cuz he's spending thousands of dollars a day on call funnels. He needed 30 something calls to happen to be able to make back the money within the first 10 days of being a part of the

group. Okay, that's how fast we're able to flip that spectrum back into your favor. And again, I can't stress enough if there's ever been a funnel type, if you're even remotely close to considering committing to a challenge funnel, a 3-day virtual event, whichever one you chalk it up as there. Again, I just can't stress enough. Go press those links down in the description. Buy some

from me. Get what you need to actually make this work at the highest possible level because it this is the type of funnel that's a lump sum funnel. It's meant to work at the highest possible level. Okay? Don't just swing and miss on this. Make sure that you actually crack. Okay? So, anyway, long story short, back to my point. When you do the rep pitch, okay, you're

repitching people just from a different perspective on the exact same thing, and you follow literally the exact same process I just laid out, but you try to plug things that are just from a slightly different view comparatively to what you previously talked about. Okay, so anyway, hope you enjoyed this video.

Go check out all the other ones in this specific series on mastering challenge funnels, virtual events, whatever you want to call it, and make some money, huh? Go get richer. Talk soon.
