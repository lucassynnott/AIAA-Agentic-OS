You got a problem. If you're only closing, let's say, 25% of the deals that come on your closer calendars, that means 75% of those are not closing and giving you some cash. That issue in itself is worth however much you can quantify it being worth. And in this video here today, I've got a tremendous solution for you. It's worked time and time again across all different

kinds of high ticket product and service-based businesses that we've coached, mentored, and worked with hands-on over the years. And I will talk in depth about it in this video here with you today. This is one of those lessons that helps crack millionoll months or tack on that next million a month, give or take where you're at while you're sitting here watching this

video. Can't stress it enough though. We don't make any income claims around here. There are by no means any implied earning potential or income guarantees as a result of watching this video. Your chance of ever hitting 10 million a year, just shy of million-dollar months, is 0.1% according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. Let alone the even smaller chance that you got to crack

million-dollar months. But that doesn't negate the fact that I sit here and bring the lessons to you of people who have been there, done that, cracked the big million-dollar months and well beyond and just pass down the things that have worked and the things that haven't worked right here on YouTube for you, my friend. So, if you're new to the channel, welcome in. That's all we talk

about. That's what you'll find lessons on on every single video on this channel. Consider subscribing if you haven't done so already. And of course, if you're already a subscriber, welcome back. It's a pleasure to have you. Got another banger for you here today.

Without further ado, let's dive in. So, we call this solution the group closing call. Okay, this group closing call just is an example of how effective this is. Time and time again, it's very simple, right? your sales team throughout the week. Let's use the example that whatever their current closing rate is, the exact opposite of that is what we want to call the

unclosed rate. Okay? And that's obviously going to be taken in most instances in a percentage for both of these. You want to turn that percentage into a number. Okay? And you want to figure out how many people per week are going.

Okay? Because as soon as you figure that out, what you're going to be able to do is you're going to be able to say, "All right, if I took, let's use the example, you're operating at scale or maybe you're just getting started at like, you know, somewhere in the couple hundredk a month range and you're looking to punch up. It's obviously going to wildly dictate how many of these people are

going unclosed per week. It might be dozens. It might be a dozen. It might be hundreds depending on how many salespeople you've got. Okay. The issue is this big problem exists which is it's very simple to understand by the way your salespeople that actually have the blessing of having full calendars they are super busy. Okay? And so as a result of that they do not follow up with damn

near anybody. The only real people they follow up with are the ones who said &gt;&gt; hey man like I got a credit card coming in the mail in a week from now like follow up with me then or like oh I'm in such and such place. I'm traveling you know I'm going to buy later. They'll follow up with those people. I'm not negating the fact that they like follow up somewhat. But again, with all the

people that they don't actually close that don't explicitly say, "Hey, I'm going to buy at a later date." They're not going to follow up with jack Okay? They're just not. Which, by the way, on this YouTube channel, I have, I believe it's like 4 hours long, I put together a sales training course, and somewhere within that 4-hour sales training course, I talk about this role

called the cleaner. This is also an incredible function. And they these these two different types of roles within your sales organization, they definitely go hand in hand. The cleaner, they can follow up with the unconverted people as well. And they can push them to this group sales call. They can also obviously attempt to close them themselves. Simply put, when you have a

lot of unclosed deals that are also not being followed up with these two roles, the cleaner role and the group closing call. Okay, the group closing call is what I really want to focus on because it leverages a specific level of authority that your salespeople generally don't bring. Okay, a lot of businesses nowadays, they're personal brandoriented. They have a charismatic

leader that deals in hope and offers change and promises potential results and outcomes that the buyers want. And then generally all those people, they get funneled to a sales team that's slightly less charismatic. They do a great job at representing or sometimes a good job or sometimes unfortunately a mediocre job at representing your organization. And that is where the

authority level starts to go down a bit. Okay. Soon as they have that experience with you and it gets handed off and diluted into just somebody on your team, the impression of I'm willing to spend a fuckload of money, that can sometimes negate the person's mind and just escape them. And as a result, what they need to do is they need to get back in front of you. And that's where this group closing

call can come in. You on a week- toeek basis, sometimes twice a week, give or take the volume of unclosed deals that you have or give or take how much money you truly give a to make. That's generally what dictates more so than anything else whether it's worth doing once a week or whether it's doing twice a week. I'll tell you this though, I will tell you the two days that are

typically best to do it. A Tuesday and believe it or not, a Friday. Okay, these two days are typically the best days of the week to do the group closing call. And the group closing call is super simple to do. What you're going to do is your salespeople when they don't close a lead. So, if somebody ends the call with, you know, I got to think about it, or whatever little stupid objection they

give that prevents them from buying, the salesperson, all they have to do in real time, because remember, they don't follow up with anybody who's not actually probable to close. They got to tell them in real time, hey man, by the way, I've got an opportunity for you to jump on a call here later this week.

It's actually tomorrow, Tuesday, at this time, and you can get on a call with soando. And what they're going to do, as you know, like they run the business. They'll answer all your questions that I may have failed to answer at a very high level. you can ask them and be very direct with them about what specifically is holding you back. I want to disclose it's a group call. So, generally that

means that there's going to be some other people that pose questions that you also maybe not have thought of, but you're going to get a lot of value from hearing the answers to. And keep in mind, you don't have to unmute yourself and go through all of your questions in front of a bunch of other people. It'll be on Zoom. And Zoom allows you to privately message the host. So, nobody

else will see your question. And you can make sure if you do private message the host, just say, "Hey, don't say who asked the question." And then just ask your question and he'll happily he or she will happily answer it and get you the information you need. And typically on that call, there's an opportunity to close if you end up feeling like it's appropriate, you know, after hearing

from this individual that leads our organization. Are you interested in that? And generally, if they actually have any level of interest after communicating to the sales representative to close at a later time, they'll say, "Yeah, yeah. I'll jump on that call." Right? And then what you're going to do is you're just going to have that salesperson mark in the CRM

so some marketing automation fires off cuz again busy sales people they don't have time to follow up. So they don't they're not going to really care. Although yes you're going to chip them a commission if somebody does get closed on the group call still because they technically pushed them over. You can pay them more like a setter in that example. You don't have to pay them the

full closing commission. Of course you're not going to do that. You're going to you're going to pay them a little less. But again you just need a super simple way through marketing automation to tag the person in the CRM and then have a whole sequence fire off that gets the person registered for it.

gets them a Zoom calendar invite, you know, gets them the whole shebang to get them to show up. Now, listen to this, right? Let's use the example that on a week-over-week basis, you have a hundred people that are going uncloed. That's a lot. Let's use the example that 50 of them say they're willing to show up.

Let's say you get half of them to show up. That's 25 people. Let's say you close 20% of them, right? You close five people out of that. That whatever times the dollar value per individual you're going to close and the AOV you obviously cash collect minus that small commission you're going to pay. That's essentially your dollar value per hour that you're walking home with after your expenses.

Of course, in that example, to be able to close those extra people. And generally, these group closing calls, they don't take longer than an hour. They're kind of like a webinar, but a much more direct webinar because they already had a sales call. So, I'm not going to tell you the specifics of how to execute the group closing call. I leave that for all the people who join

into our paid programs like our inner circle program, which is where we currently teach this specific strategy. There's a link for it down in the description. If you're rich trying to get a fuckload richer, that's the place to be. The minimum to be in there is 100K a month. Average person does two to 300K a month. 22 people in there do more than a mill a month. Some people join

already doing more than a mill a month because they're looking and attempting to tack on that next mill a month. One-on-one coaching calls. We do group coaching as well on a weekly basis. We have our quarterly in-person masterminds right here in Miami, Florida. Very active group chat full of the rich folks trying to get a lot richer. Unlimited access to Jeremy AI. Very, very great

value there alone. And then a very dense valueoriented every individual video in there is intended to be the video that makes fact the money that you pay to be in there through our course library we give inner circle members access to as well. And of course our master internet marketing program. We have our fifth cohort coming up here soon enough. Give or take the time you're watching this

video. Hey, maybe it already happened or maybe it's coming up in the very near future. And we do full revamps of that entire course every time that we do a new cohort which we typically do annually. Sometimes we do it every other year. It just depends on how much change is in marketing. But to be clear, in this newest iteration, we'll also pull information and lessons just like this

into that new cohort, add a tremendous amount of additional SOPs. There's a lot of value inside of that because it is a weekly live class. It's a 7-week total live class. If you join in now, you get access to the recording or you get access to that upcoming live cohort.

Each week covers a different topic. Very in-depth homework library full of video lessons in between, worksheets to help with information retention. There's links for that down in the description as well. You can also preview week one, the specific live class recording that we have from the most recent cohort to get an idea of what it's like and and gauge whether you think it's going to be

for you or not because it is a lot. It's a fire hose of information and we talk at a very high level regardless of where you're at, whether you're completely new or whether you're very deep in the game.

We typically get extremely great feedback from everybody who goes through it. Again, no matter the level that they're at, but I want to reiterate back to this, okay, the group coaching call, this group closing call, it's kind of a mix of both, right? You want to open it up and talk clearly about what it is you're selling. Of course, you also want to pepper in some coaching elements to

it. And then a majority of it's just going to be a big Q&amp;A. Can't stress it enough though. If you do this twice a week, it has that much more effectiveness, especially when you're operating at scale. But even if even if you're at a smaller scale and you only have like maybe a dozen or two dozen or three dozen calls on a week- toeek basis, this still has a lot of

effectiveness. The numbers are just smaller, right? But that's still likely worth the dollar value per hour that it's probable to pay you after you actually get it dialed in. and working cuz let's be honest, right? There's a reason you're at a smaller level. You're probably going to appreciate a smaller amount of money. The big dogs that are doing this, they obviously get a lot

more people to show up and obviously they're more probable to make more just based on the numbers of the whole deal. Okay, so I can't stress enough very great opportunity to crack some additional revenue. We've had one of our newer inner circle members, Pierre and Brez, they did a presentation just recently at our Q3 inner circle mastermind. They had gotten a million

dollar month trophy and they talked about some of the lessons. And interestingly enough, like there's some people in the group, this is more of an anomaly to be fair in terms of how fast they progressed, but you know, it does happen occasionally. They at the Q2 mastermind, which was in April, they only had 3 months between April and July because we do them halfway through the

month for each one of these. So, there's about a three-month period of time in between this. They had pulled a handful of things from the April mastermind. I'd gone through a tremendous amount of best practices for what was working up to that point in the quarter. And I'd seen them implement two of these things. I talked to them about live webinars and I'd also talked to them about the group

closing call. They implemented both. Okay. Again, super low percentage of people that work with us see this level of growth this fast. But again, this is the experience that they had. They were at 500K a month in that April time frame. They doubled it in May. They went to a million a month mainly from the webinar, but the group closing call also, they attested to this during their

presentation at the July Q3 mastermind to how much that also helped them. Because I can't stress this enough, think about this, like a personal brand like BRZ, right? You may have never heard of this guy and it doesn't matter if you have or haven't. He's a very notable individual currently with a very young demographic that's learning from this guy on what he specifically

teaches. And Brez gets a tremendous amount of organic reach. Okay. Now, a lot of these people, they obviously look up to Brez specifically and then you go through Bre's's funnel. Obviously, you're not going to talk to Brett.

You're going to talk to his sales guys. Now, a lot of those people that go unclosed when they then get told, "Hey man, by the way, we can get you on a call with Brez later this week. It's a group call. We can answer all your questions directly. You kind of go back and forth with them on whether this offer is right for you or not." that works tremendously well, especially when

the person who runs the business has some level of authority inside of the niche that you are operating in. It has less effectiveness when you're more unknown or just aren't a charismatic leader, right? If you're not somebody that like aspirationally can be looked up to and you're just like some guy or girl in the business, you know, it doesn't have the same effectiveness.

It's not like it's not like a manager on the sales team can see the same level of result that the person who literally runs the business and is like the face of the business is going to see compare comparatively. That like celebrity authority effect makes a tremendous difference to the volume of people that are probable to close during these weekly group calls or twice a week group

calls that you're going to do for the closing effect. So anyway, great tactic, tremendous to implement and execute on your way to million- dollar months or to crack that next million a month. Again, no income claims, no earning potential, no income guarantees of any way, shape, or form going through these lessons here with you today. Just something we've seen work on the big dog accounts that

we sit here and take up the million-dollar months and crack those next million months with. If you like these types of videos, check out all the other ones on the channel.
