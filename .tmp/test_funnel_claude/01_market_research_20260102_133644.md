# Market Research: Agency Accelerator

# AGENCY ACCELERATOR MARKET RESEARCH DOSSIER

## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: 7 STRATEGIC MOVES

### 1. **Target the "Stuck at Scale" Segment**
Focus on agencies at $15K-35K MRR who've hit operational bottlenecks. This segment has proven demand but lacks systematic growth frameworks.

### 2. **Position as the "CEO Transformation" Solution**
Own the narrative of transforming from "doer" to "leader." This emotional journey resonates more than tactical promises.

### 3. **Lead with Time-Freedom Messaging**
Primary hook: "Get your life back while doubling revenue." Time poverty is the #1 pain point for this audience.

### 4. **Leverage Peer Proof Over Guru Authority**
Feature agency owners who've made the transition, not just business coaches. Peer credibility trumps expert authority.

### 5. **Address the "Hiring Fear" Head-On**
Create content around "How to hire without losing control" - the biggest psychological barrier to scaling.

### 6. **Use Revenue-Multiple Positioning**
Position against "revenue plateau" competitors by promising systematic multiplication, not incremental growth.

### 7. **Build VSL Around "Day in the Life" Contrast**
Show the stark contrast between overwhelmed operator vs. strategic CEO lifestyle.
