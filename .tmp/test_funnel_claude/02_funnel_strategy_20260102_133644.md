## SPECIFIC COPY ANGLES

### VSL OPENING HOOK
*"If you're running a marketing agency doing anywhere from $10,000 to $50,000 a month, but you're still working 50, 60, even 70 hours a week... if you feel like you've built yourself a job instead of a business... and if you're wondering how the hell you're going to scale past this plateau without completely burning out, then this might be the most important message you ever watch."*

### Problem Agitation
*"You started your agency for freedom, but somehow you've become the biggest bottleneck in your own business. You can't take a vacation without revenue dropping. You can't hire good people because nobody cares as much as you do. And every time you try to step back, something breaks. Sound familiar?"*

### Solution Introduction
*"What I'm about to show you is the exact system I used to go from working 65 hours a week in my agency to working 20 hours a week as the CEO, while growing from $23,000 a month to over $180,000 a month. And I've now taught this same system to 127 other agency owners who've made this exact transformation."*

### Mechanism Reveal
*"The secret isn't working harder or hiring more people. The secret is something I call 'The CEO Switch.' It's an invisible switch in your mind that transforms you from an overwhelmed operator into a strategic CEO. And once you flip this switch, everything changes."*

This comprehensive funnel strategy provides the complete roadmap for transforming Agency Accelerator's target audience from overwhelmed operators into strategic CEOs while building a highly profitable, scalable funnel system.
