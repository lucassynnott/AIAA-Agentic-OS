# Market Research: Agency Accelerator

# AGENCY ACCELERATOR MARKET RESEARCH DOSSIER

## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: KEY STRATEGIC MOVES

1. **Position as "The McKinsey of Agency Growth"** - Target the sophisticated 10-50k/month agency owner who views business education as an investment, not an expense. Lead with operational excellence over revenue promises.

2. **Deploy "Founder Liberation" Messaging** - Frame the core promise around time freedom and role evolution rather than just revenue growth. The transition from "Chief Everything Officer" to true CEO resonates deeper than money alone.

3. **Leverage Peer Proof Over Guru Status** - These agency owners are skeptical of "coaches who've never run agencies." Build credibility through case studies of similar-stage transformations and peer testimonials.

4. **Create Urgency Through Opportunity Cost** - Every month stuck at their current level costs them $50-100k in unrealized revenue. The VSL should calculate their specific "plateau penalty."

5. **Address the "Special Snowflake" Objection** - Pre-empt the belief that "my agency is different" by showcasing diverse agency types (performance, creative, SEO, etc.) achieving similar transformations.

6. **Implement Qualification Friction** - These buyers want exclusivity. Position the program as application-only and emphasize the screening process to increase perceived value.

7. **Bundle Implementation Support** - Include done-with-you elements (templates, hiring scorecards, SOPs) to overcome the "I don't have time to implement" objection.
