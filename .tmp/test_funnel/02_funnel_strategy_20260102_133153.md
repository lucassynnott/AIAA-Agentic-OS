# Funnel Strategy: Agency Accelerator

## 1. STRATEGIC FOUNDATION

### Power of One Analysis
- **One Problem**: Agency owners are stuck at a revenue plateau, overwhelmed by operational duties, and unable to transition to strategic leadership.
- **One Desire**: To scale their agency to 7 figures while transforming into a CEO who leads rather than manages.
- **One Method**: A 90-day transformation program that systemizes operations, hires A-players, and empowers owners to focus on strategic growth.
- **One Promise**: Go from overwhelmed operator to CEO in 90 days.

### Primary Conversion Mechanism
- **Video Sales Letter (VSL)**: A compelling VSL that captures attention, addresses pain points, and presents the transformation journey with a strong call-to-action (CTA) to book a strategy session.

### Traffic Temperature Strategy
- **Cold Traffic**: Use targeted ads on LinkedIn and Facebook featuring key pain points and the 90-day transformation promise.
- **Warm Traffic**: Retarget website visitors and social media engagers with testimonials and case studies.
- **Hot Traffic**: Email sequences and retargeting ads focused on urgency and scarcity to push towards booking a strategy session.
