# SKILL BIBLE: Agency Sales Process (Complete System)

## Executive Summary

What works for founders won't work for sales reps. Founders have 10 years of experience, inherent authority, and reputation. Sales reps have none of that. You need a PROCESS (not a script) that makes it easy for average sales reps to succeed. This skill bible provides that complete system.

---

## The Fundamental Truth

> "Instead of the techniques, instead of trying to get better at sales, make your sales process so it's easier to sell."

**Why This Matters:**
- Founders close easily because of authority and experience
- Sales reps don't have that
- System must compensate for what reps lack

---

## The Three Qualities of Great Salespeople

### 1. Empathy

**Definition:** Actually understanding what prospects care about.

**How to Develop:**
- Ask REAL questions (not generic "What are your 12-month goals?")
- Real questions: "What exactly are you trying to solve?" "What have you done about this in the past?"
- When they feel heard → They trust you

### 2. Competence

**Definition:** Actually knowing what you're talking about.

**The Problem:** 
> "I've been on calls where the sales rep was so dumb they talked me OUT of buying."

**Solution: 14-Day Onboarding**
- Treat it like training someone to DO the work
- E-commerce email agency? Train them on email marketing
- Makes objection handling natural
- They come across as expert, not dope

**Formula:** Competence = Confidence

### 3. Indifference

**Definition:** Not being needy.

**The Dating Analogy:**
> "The needier you are, the more you want a girlfriend, people can sniff that instantly."

**How to Create Indifference:**
1. Tons of leads (no shortage)
2. Great results (confidence in product)
3. Competence (know what you're doing)

**Combined Formula:**
- Empathy = Trust
- Competence = Confidence
- Indifference = You are the prize

---

## Congruence: The Secret Weapon

**Definition:** Everything in agreement, harmony, compatible from ad click to onboarding completion.

**The Chain:**
```
Ads → Content → Outreach → Landing Page → VSL → Calendly → Pre-call Flow → First Part of Call → Onboarding
```

**Every link must say the same thing.**

**Why:**
- Incongruence creates uneasy feeling
- They clicked ad for specific message → Why would landing page say something different?
- Made it through all steps → Clearly interested in what you said → Don't change it

---

## Phase 0A: Pre-Framing System

### Purpose

Pre-framing correctly leads to:
- Higher show rate
- Higher quality calls
- Prospects know price ahead of time

### Four Pre-Framing Tools

#### 1. Pre-Call Email Flow

**Trigger:** When they book the call

**Volume:** More than you think (4 emails/day for 3 days)

**Content:**
- Case studies
- Industry insights
- FAQs
- How it works
- Objection handling

#### 2. Retargeting Ads

**Structure:** ~60 one-minute videos (short form)

**Categories (9 ads minimum):**
- 3 case studies (different types/countries)
- 3 objection handlers
- 3 industry insights

**Example for Landing Page Agency:**
- Case study: Different countries (overcomes "won't work for my country")
- Case study: Different products (overcomes "won't work for my niche")
- Objection: "Why are your landing pages better?"
- Industry insight: "Pages must load in under 2 seconds"

#### 3. YouTube Videos

**The 420/7 Rule:**
> Old: "Average person takes 7 touch points to convert"
> New: "20 touch points over 4 channels and 7 hours of time spent"

**What This Means:** More YouTube = More trust = More closes

**Approach:** Give the theory free, sell the implementation

#### 4. Cross-Posting System

**Process:**
1. Create written content for Twitter
2. VA or tool (Repurpose.io) cross-posts to:
   - LinkedIn
   - Facebook
   - Instagram
   - Video reels

**Why:** Be on all platforms. If they've seen your stuff + get served your ads, they're more likely to engage.

---

## Phase 0B: Calendly Questions

### Why More Effort = Better Results

**Data shows:**
- More effort on Calendly = More likely to show up
- Loss aversion: Why put in effort if not going to show?
- Less serious people won't bother

### The 8 Questions

1. **Name** - Basic
2. **Email** - Basic
3. **Phone** - Basic
4. **Website** - Basic
5. **Revenue** (Multiple Choice) - Syncs cleanly to CRM
   - 0-10K, 10-50K, 50-250K, 250K-1M, 1M+
6. **Cost Confirmation** - "Our offer costs between $X and $Y/month. Are you okay with this?"
7. **Source** - "Where did you learn about us?" (gauge what's working, alter approach)
8. **Time Known** - "How long have you known about us?" (gauge warmth, fill cycle)

**What This Gives Your Rep:**
- Prospect knows price
- Rep knows source
- Rep knows how long they've known you
- More confidence, better calls

---

## Phase 0C: Pre-Call Research

> "90% of people don't do anything besides read the Calendly form. That's crazy."

**If you're prepared:**
- Naturally more confident
- More professional
- Close more deals

### Research Checklist

#### Company Overview
- What company does
- Target audience/customers
- Key metrics (revenue, customers served)

#### Team Members
- Who booked (founder? marketing head? assistant?)
- Other stakeholders (CMO? Co-founder?)
- Org structure (30-person marketing team vs solo founder?)

#### Offer Positioning
- How you solve THEIR problem
- What makes your offer unique vs alternatives
- How offer aligns with THEIR goals

#### Relevant Social Proof
- Case studies from similar clients (same niche, same size)
- Testimonials from similar clients
- Other results/credibility

---

## Phase 1: Introduction (First 30 Seconds)

### The Problem to Solve

Sales reps lack inherent authority and credibility of founders.

### The Goal

Make great first impression that:
- Frames them in driver's seat
- Transfers company credibility to rep

**Rule:** The person asking questions is in control.

### The Introduction Script

```
"Hello, my name is [X] from [Company].

I have a background in [their specific problem area].

I've been working closely with [Founder] for [X] years.

I would love to know what resonated with you the most about [Founder]'s YouTube videos / caused you to click on our ads?"
```

**Then they respond...**

```
"The purpose of this call is to see if you qualify for our offer.

Not everyone does, and it's based on [3-5 factors: revenue, time, ambition, business type, etc.].

Mind if I ask you a few questions to see how you compare to our most successful clients?"
```

**They say yes → Phase 2**

---

## Phase 2: The Five Questions

### Purpose

Move the sale FORWARD, not sideways.

**Two Goals:**
1. Get information
2. Get them to ADMIT IT out loud

### Question 1: Why Are We Here Today?

**Purpose:** Most basic - why do they want to talk to you?

**80% will tell you straight.** 20% need prodding.

**Example Answers:**
- "Our lead flow has dried up and we need consistent opportunities"
- "We're looking for a more scalable solution"
- "Our ad spend isn't translating to ROI"

### Question 2: Why Are You Interested in Solving [Problem]?

**Purpose:** Their MOTIVATIONS for doing this.

**Example Answers:**
- "We want to unlock our sales team's potential - not enough quality leads"
- "We have aggressive growth goals this year, just raised money"
- "We're first to market, don't want to waste the opportunity"

### Question 3: Why Is That a Problem?

**Purpose:** The CONSEQUENCES if they don't solve it.

**Subtle Difference:**
- Q2 = Motivations
- Q3 = Consequences

**Example Answers:**
- "If we don't figure this out, we'll keep missing revenue targets"
- "Our competitors are gaining traction and we're losing ground"
- "It's going to burn our sales team out and we'll have to recruit again"
- "Our investors are breathing down our neck, I might get fired as CEO"

### Question 4: Why Now?

**Purpose:** Discover if urgency exists (you can't create it).

> "The goal of marketing and sales is to stay top of mind so when someone is ready to buy, they immediately think of you."

**If Now = Perfect Time:** Closing time. Sales tactics time.
**If Now ≠ Perfect Time:** Ease up to stay in good graces.

**Example Answers:**
- "We just raised funding, now is the time before market gets saturated" (CLOSE)
- "Our board wants results this quarter, can't wait any longer" (CLOSE)
- "We're launching new product, need to figure this out before launch" (CLOSE)

### Question 5: Why Not [Alternatives]?

**Purpose:** Handle objections before they become objections.

**Variations:**
- "Why not do nothing?"
- "Why not do it yourself?"
- "Why not hire someone else?"

**Example Answers:**
- "We've tried doing this ourselves but don't have the expertise"
- "We've looked at other agencies but they don't deliver on promises"
- "We tried with [tool] but it's too slow"

### Transition to Phase 3

```
"Based on these results, it sounds like you're quite similar to our most successful clients.

[Name a couple similar clients]

Do you mind if I show you a few slides with our offer and what we can do for you?"
```

---

## Phase 3: Screen Share Presentation

### Guidelines

- 5-7 minutes (if 30-minute call)
- Prevent objections > Answer objections
- Think of it as "Big FAQ Destroyer"

### The 8-Part Structure

#### 1. Intro/Highlight Reel (First 60 Seconds)
- Examples, Awards, Case Studies, Results
- Read your first 60 seconds out loud with timer
- Goal: Hammer credibility fast

**Example:**
> "We are 1000x Leads, helped 550+ agency owners doing combined $375M/year increase lead flow by 28% within 120 days. We have 600+ client wins on our website and 25+ case studies."

#### 9. Next Steps

> "After this call, within 5 minutes I'll send follow-up email with X, Y, Z..."

---

## Phase 4: Close and Follow-Up

### The Reality

95%+ won't buy on the call or within 5 minutes.

### Follow-Up Flow

**Same structure as welcome and pre-call flows, but:**
- References the call that happened
- Focus on next steps to get started

### Selfie Video System

**When someone fills out form (doesn't book):**
1. Zapier texts you immediately
2. Pick up phone, record selfie video
3. "Hey, I saw you filled out the form. Do you prefer to do this on a call or over text?"

**When someone books call:**
- Same selfie video
- "Looking forward to our call, here's what to expect..."

**Result:** Massive increase in show rate and rapport
