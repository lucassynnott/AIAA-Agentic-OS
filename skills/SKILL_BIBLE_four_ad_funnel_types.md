# SKILL BIBLE: The Four Types of Ad Funnels

> Source: Matthew Larsen (1000x Leads)
> Context: 4 ad funnel types every agency should master - when to use each

---

## Executive Summary

There are four main ad funnel types: VSSL/Webinar, Newsletter, Group, and Paid Product. Each has specific use cases, pros, and cons. The best funnel is the one that gets you the most customers at the lowest CPA - not the one someone else recommends.

---

## Critical Mindset Shift

> "Don't let me or anyone else tell you what the best ad funnel is. The best ad funnel is the one that gets you the most customers at the lowest cost per acquisition."

### The Cold Traffic Reality

> "When you're doing any ad funnel, cold traffic is NOT going to convert like a referral would."

**Referral close rate:** 70%
**Cold traffic close rate:** Significantly lower

**This is normal.** Don't think something is wrong.

**The tradeoff:**
- Con: Lower conversion than warm traffic
- Pro: Can scale infinitely if ads + landing page + offer are good

## Funnel Type 1: VSSL/Webinar Funnel

### How It Works

```
Ad → Lead Magnet → Thank You Page with VSSL/Webinar
         ↓
    Email Flows
         ↓
  Appointment Setter
         ↓
   Book Call → Intro Offer → Recurring Service
```

### The Flow

1. Ad to lead magnet ("Top 5 tips to acquire customers")
2. Sign up for email
3. Redirect to thank you page with VSSL
4. OR redirect to webinar registration
5. Multiple touchpoints push to VSSL:
   - Direct signup
   - Email sequences
   - Appointment setter
   - Content links
   - Retargeting ads
6. VSSL sells intro offer
7. Do good job → Upsell to recurring

### When to Use

> "Best when you have a specific training, case study, or presentation that convinces people to buy from you."

**Good for:**
- People who can make great VSSL/presentations
- Services that need explanation
- Higher-ticket offerings

### Conversion Expectations

> "You don't really want to assume you're going to get more than 20% of booked calls to close. That takes into account no-shows and unqualified leads."

### Example

**Digpal (fashion brands agency):**
- Ad is VSSL-style video
- Landing page has VSSL + Book Call button
- Simple: How cheap can we get calls × close rate?

## Funnel Type 2: Newsletter Funnel

### How It Works

```
Ad → Lead Magnet → Newsletter Signup → Thank You Page
         ↓
  Co-Registration Popup (optional)
         ↓
Newsletter 3-5x/week → Webinar/Call → Intro → Recurring
```

### The Flow

1. Run ads to get newsletter signups (cheap as possible)
2. Optional: Co-registration popup
3. Thank you page makes them aware of offer
4. Newsletter 3-5x per week
5. Get them to webinar or book call
6. Intro offer → recurring

### When to Use

**Two scenarios:**

1. **High-price, long sales cycle:**
   - They need multiple touchpoints
   - Newsletter nurtures over time

2. **Emergency/immediate need services:**
   - Example: Cybersecurity firm
   - They remember you from newsletter when they need you
   - "I remember that from the newsletter, let me call them"

### Critical Requirement

> "The newsletter funnel doesn't work for a lot of people because it only works if you have the ENTIRE funnel built."

**Why:**
- People come in cheap
- They "die" there without full system
- Over time they might:
  - Watch your content
  - Download different lead magnet
  - Get cold email
  - Sign up for webinar

**Reality:**
> "People don't just sign up for your newsletter and then convert on the thank you page."

### The Data Enrichment Hack

> "Take your entire newsletter list and put it inside Apollo or somewhere where you can enrich the data."

**The process:**
1. Get people with company emails
2. Enrich their data
3. Have appointment setters reach out
4. Treat them like CRM leads (not just passive subscribers)

### Example

**Pilot Host / D-to-C Newsletter:**
- Creative agency (higher ticket)
- Owns newsletter in their niche
- Links to Pilot Host throughout newsletter
- Long sales cycle fits newsletter model

## Funnel Type 3: Group Funnel

### How It Works

```
Ad → Email + Phone Capture → Thank You Page (Join Group)
         ↓
  SMS Flow + Email Flow (invite to group)
         ↓
  Group (Content + Appointment Setters + Retargeting)
         ↓
  Intro Offer → Recurring Service
```

### The Flow

1. Run ad to email + phone capture
2. Thank you page promotes group
3. SMS flow inviting to group
4. Email flow inviting to group
5. Inside group:
   - Consistent content
   - Appointment setters
   - Retargeting ads
   - Email flows
6. Convert to intro offer → recurring

### When to Use

> "Great when you sell a service where they need to get some tips or see some results before they fully trust you."

**Examples:**
- Sales training
- Coaching programs
- Anything requiring proof/trust

### The Critical Warning

> "This is the BEST one - but ONLY if you put tremendous amount of effort into it. If you don't have time, it's the WORST."

**Requirements:**
- Hours per day in the group
- Messaging people inside
- Consistent posting
- Email flows set up
- Sync to CRM

**No effort = Dead group = Worst funnel**

### Implementation

1. Opt-in page (email + phone)
2. Thank you page → School/FB group signup
3. Membership questions (enrich data)
4. Sync all members to CRM
5. Active engagement daily

## Funnel Type 4: Paid Product Funnel

### How It Works

```
Ad → Sales Page → Purchase ($10-100) → Upsells
         ↓
  Make Aware of Service → VSSL/Webinar
         ↓
  Appointment Setter → Intro Offer → Recurring
```

### The Flow

1. Run ad to product sales page
2. Get purchase ($10-100)
3. Add upsells to reach $100+ AOV
4. Make them aware of done-for-you service
5. Push to VSSL or webinar
6. Appointment setter follows up
7. Convert to intro offer → recurring

### When to Use

> "This is the BEST for beginners because the other three - you're spending money on ads and hoping it works. When you're a beginner, you're probably going to screw it up."

**The key:**
- Selling $97 product
- Get purchase for ~$90 in ad spend
- **Break even = No risk**
- No delay like other funnels

### What to Sell

> "Usually templates are great."

**Examples:**
| Agency Type | Product |
|-------------|---------|
| Email marketing | Editable email templates |
| YouTube | Thumbnail assets (Canva) |
| Landing page | Page templates |
| Facebook ads | Ad templates/swipes |

### The Math

```
Selling: $97
CPA Target: Under $97
Goal: Break even on front end
Profit: Comes from service upsells
```

**Self-liquidating offer:** If selling $20, hard to get $20 CPA. At $97+, much more room.

### Warning for eCommerce Backgrounds

> "People from eCommerce ads backgrounds really struggle with this because they think it's the same thing."

**Common mistake:** Obsessing over low cost per lead

**Reality:**
> "Capturing the lead is the easy part. It's what comes after - the offer, email flows, appointment setting, ability to close - those contribute to your ads way more than cost per lead itself."
