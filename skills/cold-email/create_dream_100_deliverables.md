# Create Dream 100 Deliverables

## Description
Learn how to create high-impact, plug-and-play deliverables that prove your expertise and open doors with dream prospects. This guide covers 20+ specific deliverable types across different services, with templates, real examples, and step-by-step creation processes.

## When to Use This Skill
- You're executing a Dream 100 campaign
- You need to create free upfront work for prospects
- You want to stand out from generic cold outreach
- You're proving your value before asking for the sale
- You need specific deliverable ideas for your service

## The Philosophy of Dream 100 Deliverables

### Core Principle:
**Your deliverable IS your pitch.** The quality, thoughtfulness, and implementation-readiness of your free work determines whether you get the client.

### What Makes a Great Deliverable:

✅ **Plug-and-Play:** They can use it immediately without extra work
✅ **Custom:** Tailored specifically to their business
✅ **Valuable:** Solves a real problem or opens a real opportunity
✅ **Professional:** Treated like paid work
✅ **Complete:** Not a fragment or partial solution

❌ **Avoid:**
- Generic templates they could find online
- Incomplete work that requires them to finish
- Complicated deliverables that need explanation
- Work that doesn't match their actual needs
- Fragments without full context

## The Two Types of Deliverables

### Type 1: Help Them START Something New

Best for prospects who:
- Aren't on a platform where they should be
- Haven't started a marketing channel
- Are missing an obvious opportunity

**Examples:**
- They're not on YouTube → 30 days of video scripts
- They're not doing Reddit → Month of Reddit posts
- They're not running ads → Ad creative + copy package
- They're not doing email → Email sequence + strategy

### Type 2: Optimize What They're Already Doing

Best for prospects who:
- Are already doing something but doing it poorly
- Have obvious room for improvement
- Need refinement rather than new channels

**Examples:**
- Poor landing page → Redesigned landing page
- Weak ad creative → New ad creative suite
- Bad thumbnails → Redesigned thumbnails
- Low-converting copy → Rewritten copy
- Inefficient funnel → Optimized funnel map

## Deliverable Quality Standards

### Professional Quality Means:

✅ No typos or errors
✅ Properly formatted
✅ Visually appealing
✅ Complete (not rushed)
✅ Clear instructions
✅ Contact info included
✅ Easy to navigate

❌ Rushed or sloppy
❌ Generic templates
❌ Incomplete work
❌ Confusing organization
❌ Missing context

### The "Would I Pay For This?" Test:

Before sending, ask yourself:
- Would I pay for this?
- Would I use this?
- Does this solve a real problem?
- Is this actually valuable?

If the answer to any is "no," improve it before sending.

## Advanced Deliverable Tactics

### Tactic 1: The Implementation Hook

Instead of just sending the deliverable, make implementation require a call:

**Example:**
"I redesigned your landing page in Figma. You can hand this to your developer, OR if you want, I can hop on a quick 15-minute call and build it directly into ClickFunnels for you 100% free."

This gets you on a call where you can build rapport and pitch your services.

### Tactic 2: The Continuation Offer

Create a deliverable that naturally leads to more work:

**Example:**
"Here are 5 ad creative concepts. If you want, I can design 20 more variations and set up your entire campaign this week."

### Tactic 3: The Risk Reversal

Add a guarantee to your free work:

**Example:**
"Here are 10 new ad creatives. I'm so confident these will beat your current ads, I'll pay you $500 if they don't outperform within $500 of ad spend."

### Tactic 4: The Authority Play

Reference your expertise subtly:

**Example:**
"This is the exact funnel structure we used to help [client] go from $50k to $200k/month."

### Tactic 5: The Immediate Win

Create something they can implement in under 10 minutes:

**Example:**
"These 5 ad copy variations are ready to paste into your ads manager right now. Each should take 2 minutes to implement."

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Sending generic templates** - Must be custom to them
❌ **Incomplete deliverables** - Don't send fragments
❌ **No video walkthrough** - Video builds trust
❌ **Too complicated** - Keep it simple
❌ **Missing contact info** - Make it easy to respond
❌ **No clear next step** - Always include a CTA
❌ **Rushed quality** - This is your pitch
❌ **Wrong format** - Match their needs
❌ **No context** - Explain why this matters
❌ **Forgetting the call hook** - Weave in implementation call

The prospects who receive amazing, customized, plug-and-play work from you will remember you. They'll respond. They'll book calls. They'll become clients.
