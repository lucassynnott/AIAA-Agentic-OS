# Execute Dream 100 Strategy

## Description
Master the complete Dream 100 cold outreach process to sign whale clients and fast-track your agency growth without spending money on ads. This strategy focuses on providing insane upfront value to your dream prospects through personalized free work, positioning you as an expert and opening doors to high-value deals.

## When to Use This Skill
- You're under $10k/month and need to sign your first major clients
- You don't have case studies or testimonials yet
- You want to target specific high-value prospects in your niche
- You're looking for a free acquisition channel with high ROI
- You want to build authority by working with industry leaders

## What is Dream 100?

Dream 100 is a cold outreach method where you research and perform free upfront work for someone WITHOUT them asking you to. You give them something of immense value first, proving your expertise and skill before they ever get on a call with you.

**Key Difference from Cold DMs:**
- Cold DMs: "Hey, can I do this for you?"
- Dream 100: *Delivers completed work* "Here's what I made for you."

## The Complete Dream 100 Process

### Step 1: Know Your Industry
Define your target industry precisely:
- Online coaches
- E-commerce brands
- SaaS companies
- Info product companies
- B2B service providers

### Step 2: Find Your Dream 100 Prospects

**Where to Find Them:**
1. **Social Media Search Features**
   - Twitter/X: Search for industry keywords, look at followers of mid-tier influencers
   - Instagram: Search hashtags and location tags
   - LinkedIn: Use Sales Navigator or basic search
   - TikTok: Search for industry creators
   - Facebook: Search in groups and pages

2. **Follow Mid-Tier Influencers**
   - Find someone with 10k-100k followers in your target industry
   - Look through their followers/following
   - Target people engaging with their content

3. **Join Industry Communities** (Use Carefully)
   - Coaching programs in your ICP's space
   - School communities
   - Slack/Discord groups
   - LinkedIn groups
   - **WARNING:** Don't spam! Provide genuine value and elevate yourself as an authority first

4. **Save Profiles While Scrolling**
   - As you consume content, save profiles of qualified prospects
   - Build your list organically over time

### Step 3: Qualify Your Prospects

A qualified Dream 100 prospect has:
- ✅ Consistently posting content online
- ✅ Has an online presence (website, social media)
- ✅ Has a landing page or sales funnel
- ✅ Running paid ads (if applicable to your service)
- ✅ Clearly an established business
- ✅ Has budget signals (hiring, advertising, active business operations)

**Prioritization:**
- **A+ Prospects:** Have all criteria → Target first
- **B Prospects:** Missing 1-2 criteria → Target after A+
- **C Prospects:** Only meet basic criteria → Target last or skip

### Step 4: Deep Research on Each Prospect

Spend 15-30 minutes researching each prospect:

**What to Research:**
1. **Their Offer**
   - What do they sell?
   - Who do they sell to?
   - What's their price point?

2. **Their Marketing**
   - What platforms are they on?
   - What's their content strategy?
   - Are they running ads? (Check Meta Ad Library)
   - What does their funnel look like?

3. **Their Gaps**
   - What are they NOT doing that they should be?
   - What are they doing poorly?
   - Where can you add immediate value?

**Key Question:** What value can I provide that corresponds with MY core offer and skill set?

### Step 5: Create Your Dream 100 Deliverable

## Two Types of Value You Can Provide:

### Option A: Help Them Start Something New
Examples:
- They're not on Reddit → Create 30 days of Reddit posts
- They're not doing short-form content → Chop up their long-form into 30 clips
- They're not doing cold email → Write scripts + full infrastructure setup guide
- They're not running ads → Create ad copy + creative strategy

### Option B: Optimize What They're Currently Doing
Examples:
- Fix their landing page → Redesign in Figma
- Improve their ad creative → Design 5-10 new static ads
- Better thumbnails → Redesign 3 thumbnails focused on CTR
- Improve ad copy → Rewrite their top 5 ads
- Optimize their funnel → Create new funnel map with CRO improvements

## Deliverable Time Investment:

**Money-Making Route** (Under $10k/month):
- **Time per deliverable:** 1-2 hours
- **Volume:** 1-2 deliverables per day
- **Focus:** Speed and volume, still quality

**Case Study Builder Route** ($10k-$30k/month):
- **Time per deliverable:** 3-5+ hours
- **Volume:** 2-3 deliverables per week
- **Focus:** Going after whales, maximum impact

### Step 6: Package Your Deliverable

## Document Structure (Use Gamma.app or Google Docs):

**1. Intro Section**
- Explain the problem you identified
- Why you're reaching out
- What you've created for them

**2. Video Walkthrough**
- Loom or unlisted YouTube video
- 3-5 minutes explaining the deliverable
- Walk through what you created
- Show your face, build trust

**3. The Deliverable**
- The actual work (scripts, designs, strategy doc, etc.)
- Make it plug-and-play
- Easy to implement immediately

**4. Deliverable Breakdown**
- What is it?
- Why should they care?
- How will this help them?

**5. Next Steps (Your CTA)**
- "If you'd like to implement this, let's hop on a quick 15-min call and I'll build it into your platform 100% free"
- OR: "Here are the next steps to implement this yourself..."
- **Weave in a mandatory call to implement the free work**

**6. Brief Bio Section**
- Who you are
- What you do
- Contact info (email, phone number, social links)
- Photo of yourself

## Key Deliverable Principles:

✅ **Make it PLUG AND PLAY** - They should be able to use it immediately
✅ **Custom to THEIR specific needs** - Not generic
✅ **Not salesy** - Focus on value, not pitching yourself
✅ **Easy to consume and implement** - Don't make them work hard
✅ **Treat it like you got paid** - Do quality work

❌ **Don't:** Send fragments (e.g., script without infrastructure)
❌ **Don't:** Make it salesy with tons of CTAs
❌ **Don't:** Send generic templates

## Visual Deliverables:

If your deliverable is visual (thumbnails, landing pages, ad creative), you can send the images directly in your initial outreach message rather than a full document.

**Example:** "Hey [Name], I redesigned 3 thumbnails for you focused on beating your current CTR. Here they are - download and use them immediately if you'd like!"

### Step 7: Send Your Outreach

## Multi-Channel Approach:

Send to as many channels as possible to maximize chances of being seen:

1. **Email** (if you can find it)
2. **Instagram DM**
3. **Twitter/X DM**
4. **LinkedIn DM**
5. **Facebook Messenger**

**Message Template:**

```
Subject: [Specific deliverable] for [Their Company]

Hey [First Name],

I'm [Your Name] - I help [ICP] with [your service].

I was checking out [Their Company] and noticed [specific observation about their business/marketing].

So I went ahead and [what you created for them].

I know this will help you [specific outcome/benefit] because [brief reasoning].

Here's everything: [link to document or attached images]

### Step 8: Follow Up Relentlessly

## Follow-Up Strategy:

**Timeline:**
- Day 1: Send initial outreach
- Day 3: Follow-up #1 ("Just wanted to make sure you saw this")
- Day 7: Follow-up #2 ("Quick bump on this")
- Day 14: Follow-up #3 ("Last follow-up - figured you might be busy")

**Multi-Channel Follow-Ups:**
- If you sent via email, follow up via Instagram DM
- If no response on Instagram, try Twitter
- Try different channels each follow-up

**Follow-Up Message Template:**

```
Hey [Name],

Just wanted to make sure you saw the [deliverable] I sent over.

I spent [time] putting this together specifically for [Their Company] because I noticed [specific gap/opportunity].

Even if you're not interested in working together, I'd love to know what you think of it!

[Your Name]
```

### Step 9: Book the Call

When they respond positively:

**Your Response:**

```
Awesome! Glad you found it valuable.

How does [day] at [time] work for a quick 15-20 min call?

I can show you exactly how to implement this and we can chat about [relevant topic to your service].

Here's my calendar: [calendar link]

Or if you prefer, just pick a time that works and I'll make it happen!
```

**Call Objectives:**
1. Build rapport and trust
2. Show them how to implement the free work
3. Understand their business and goals
4. Naturally transition to how you can help more
5. Pitch your paid service if there's a fit

### Step 10: Close the Deal

**On the Call:**
1. **First 5 minutes:** Get to know them, build rapport
2. **Next 5-7 minutes:** Walk through the deliverable, show implementation
3. **Next 5 minutes:** Ask about their business, goals, challenges
4. **Final 3-5 minutes:** If there's a fit, explain how you can help more

**Transition to Pitch:**
"So I'm curious - beyond [deliverable topic], what's your biggest challenge with [their business area]?"

Then listen, and if your service solves that problem:

"Got it. So we actually help [ICP] with exactly that. Here's how we typically work with clients like you..."

## Organization System

### Use Trello or Notion:

**Columns:**
1. **Prospects to Research** (Your Dream 100 list)
2. **In Research** (Currently researching)
3. **Creating Deliverable** (Actively making free work)
4. **Sent Outreach** (Delivered, awaiting response)
5. **Following Up** (Sent follow-ups)
6. **In Conversation** (They responded)
7. **Call Booked** (Meeting scheduled)
8. **Closed** (Deal signed!)
9. **Dead** (No response after all follow-ups)

**Card Details to Include:**

- Date sent
- Follow-up dates
- Response notes

## Success Metrics

**Good Response Rates:**
- **Money-Making Route:** 5-15% response rate
- **Case Study Route:** 15-30% response rate (because you're spending more time)

**What Success Looks Like:**
- People respond saying "This is awesome!"
- They book calls with you
- They implement your work and come back for more
- You close deals within 1-2 weeks of first outreach

**What Failure Looks Like:**
- No responses after 100 outreaches
- People say "not interested" immediately

If you're experiencing failure signals: Your ICP, research, deliverable quality, or offer needs adjustment.

## Two Paths of Dream 100

### Path 1: Money-Making Route (0-$10k/month)
**Goal:** Sign deals quickly, stack cash, get testimonials

**Strategy:**
- High volume (1-2 deliverables per day)
- 1-2 hours per deliverable
- Target B+ prospects (qualified but not necessarily huge)
- Focus on speed and reps

### Path 2: Case Study Builder Route ($10k-$30k/month)
**Goal:** Sign whale clients, stack authority, build epic case studies

**Strategy:**
- Lower volume (2-3 deliverables per week)
- 3-5+ hours per deliverable
- Target A+ whales only (Gym Launch, big names in your space)
- Focus on maximum impact and wow factor

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Asking permission before doing the work** - This isn't Dream 100, it's just a cold DM
❌ **Sending generic deliverables** - Must be custom to them
❌ **Making it too salesy** - Focus on value first
❌ **Not following up** - Most deals come from follow-ups
❌ **Targeting the wrong people** - Qualify your prospects properly
❌ **Giving up too early** - This strategy takes consistency
❌ **Sending incomplete work** - Make it plug-and-play
❌ **Not including a video** - Video builds trust and explains your work
❌ **Forgetting contact info** - Make it easy for them to reach you
❌ **Saying "you're part of my Dream 100"** - Sounds desperate and salesy

## Advanced Tips

### Tip 1: Leverage Whale Case Studies
Once you sign a big client, leverage them HARD:
- "I work with [Big Name]" opens every door below them
- Create detailed case studies
- Use their logo in your materials
- Ask for video testimonials

### Tip 2: Stay Niched
The more niched you are, the more your Dream 100 case studies compound:
- Work with the top 3 in your niche
- Everyone below them will want to work with you
- You become THE person for that industry

### Tip 3: Speed to Lead
When someone responds, get them on a call WITHIN 24-48 HOURS:
- The faster you move, the higher the close rate
- Strike while the iron is hot
- Have your calendar ready

### Tip 4: No Risk Offers
If you're confident in your deliverable, add a risk reversal:
- "If these ads don't beat your current ones within $500 of spend, I'll pay you $500 for wasted spend"
- "If this landing page doesn't convert better, I'll refund 2x what you paid"

### Tip 5: Create a Follow-Up Email Sequence
Set up automated follow-ups if they don't respond:
- Use tools like Instantly.ai or Smartlead
- 4-5 follow-ups over 2 weeks
- Each follow-up adds more value or context

## Scaling Dream 100

## Final Thoughts

Dream 100 is tough. Most people give up. The work is hard, it takes time, and you won't see results immediately.

But if you commit to this strategy for 60-90 days, sending 30-60 high-quality deliverables to your dream prospects, you WILL sign deals. You WILL build case studies. And you WILL fast-track your agency growth.

Remember: Free work done right = paid work that follows.
