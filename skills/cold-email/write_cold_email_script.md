## Writing Guidelines

### Subject Lines
- **Keep it short** (3-5 words ideal)
- **Make it relevant** (their name, company, pain point)
- **Avoid spam triggers** (no "FREE!", "$$$", "LIMITED TIME")
- **Test variants** (question vs statement vs FName)

**Good Examples:**
- "Quick question [FirstName]"
- "[Company] + lead generation"
- "Thought about [Company]"
- "[Pain point]?"

**Bad Examples:**
- "I can help you make $$$"
- "URGENT: You need to see this"
- "RE: Following up" (when there's no previous thread)

### Email Body Best Practices

✅ **DO:**
- Keep under 75 words
- Use their first name
- Reference something specific about them
- Include social proof (authority + social proof principle)
- Use "because" statements to increase compliance
- One clear CTA
- Make it about THEM not you
- Use line breaks for readability
- Lead with proof before claims
- Tap into existing fears/desires (see Emotional Targeting below)

❌ **DON'T:**
- Write long paragraphs
- Talk only about yourself
- Use generic templates
- Include multiple CTAs
- Be pushy or salesy
- Use buzzwords and jargon
- Attach files (kills deliverability)
- Try to create new desires (identify existing ones)

## Emotional Targeting in Cold Email

Before writing, identify which **pre-existing emotions** your prospect experiences. Don't try to create new desires—channel existing ones toward your solution.

### 10 Common Fears (Target These in Cold Email)
- **Unknown**: "Not knowing if your current approach is working..."
- **Embarrassment**: "Falling behind competitors in [area]..."
- **Failure**: "Missing quota/targets because of [problem]..."
- **Poverty/Loss**: "Leaving revenue on the table..."
- **Dependence**: "Being stuck with [current vendor/approach]..."
- **Betrayal**: "Getting burned by agencies/vendors who overpromise..."

### 8 Common Desires (Tap Into These)
- **Freedom**: "Control over your [pipeline/revenue/process]..."
- **Success**: "Hitting [specific metric] consistently..."
- **Acceptance**: "Getting recognized by leadership for..."
- **Peace of Mind**: "Knowing your [system] runs without you babysitting..."
- **Optimism**: "Clear path to [goal]..."

### Application Example
**Generic**: "We help companies generate more leads."
**Emotion-Targeted**: "I know most [Role] worry about unpredictable lead flow month-to-month..." (taps into Fear of Unknown + Desire for Peace of Mind)

## Persuasion Principles for Cold Email

### 6 Influence Weapons (Cialdini)
1. **Reciprocation**: Give value first (Email 2 in follow-up sequence)
   - "Here's a resource that helped [Similar Company]..."
2. **Social Proof**: Show similar companies using your solution
   - "[Similar Company] and [Another Company] both saw..."
3. **Authority**: Establish credibility through specifics
   - "After helping 40+ SaaS companies with..."
4. **Scarcity**: Limit availability authentically
   - "Only working with 2 more clients this quarter..."
5. **Liking**: Build rapport through commonalities
   - Reference shared connections, interests, experiences
6. **Consistency**: Get small commitments first
   - "Would it make sense to..." (lower commitment than "Book a call")

### The "Because" Trigger Word
Inserting "because" activates automatic compliance. Use it strategically:

**Without Because**: "We should talk."
**With Because**: "Worth a quick call because [Similar Company] saw 34% lift in 60 days using this approach."

**Application**: Every cold email should have at least 1-2 "because" statements.

## Personalization Strategies

### Manual Personalization
- Recent company news/funding
- Job posting analysis (indicates pain points)
- LinkedIn activity (shows priorities)
- Website changes (new initiatives)
- Industry trends affecting them
- **Emotional triggers specific to their role** (see above)

### AI Mass Personalization
- Use enrichment data (company size, tech stack, etc.)
- Generate custom first lines at scale
- Reference industry-specific pain points tied to emotions
- Customize case studies by vertical
- **Identify dominant fear/desire per ICP segment**

## AI Prompt for Script Writing

```
You are a cold email expert. Write a cold email script for:

TARGET AUDIENCE: [Role, industry, company size]
DOMINANT EMOTION: [Fear/Desire from list above]
PAIN POINT: [Specific problem they face]
OUR SOLUTION: [What we offer]
PROOF: [Case study or result - lead with this]
CTA: [Desired action]

Requirements:
- Under 75 words

- Lead line 2 with PROOF first, then credibility
- Include at least 1 "because" statement
- Clear value prop tied to their emotion
- Simple CTA with light scarcity/urgency
- Conversational tone
- Apply one Cialdini principle (reciprocation, social proof, authority, scarcity, liking, or consistency)

```

## Follow-Up Sequence

### Email 1 (Day 0): Initial Outreach
Use one of the templates above

### Email 2 (Day 3): Value Add (Reciprocation Principle)
**Strategy**: Give value with NO ask to trigger reciprocity obligation

```
Subject: Re: [Original Subject]

[FirstName],

No pressure on my last email - wanted to share something that might help regardless.

[Link to case study/article/tool]

[Similar Company] used this exact approach to [specific result]. Figured it might be relevant for [Company] because [reason].

Hope it's useful!

[Your Name]
```

**Key**: No CTA, pure value. This creates psychological obligation for Email 3.

### Email 3 (Day 7): Different Angle
```
Subject: Re: [Original Subject]

[FirstName],

Circling back - I know [pain point] is a challenge for [industry] companies right now.

Quick question: Are you currently [working on related initiative]?

[Your Name]
```

### Email 4 (Day 14): Breakup Email
```
Subject: Re: [Original Subject]

[FirstName],

I'll assume this isn't a priority right now and stop reaching out.

If that changes, here's my calendar: [link]

Best of luck with [their initiative]!

[Your Name]
```

## Industry-Specific Variations

### For E-Commerce
```
Subject: [Store Name] email revenue

Most DTC brands leave 20-30% of revenue on the table with their email program.
