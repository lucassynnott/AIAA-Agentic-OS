# SKILL BIBLE: $200K/Month Organic Content System (Daniel Fazio Method)

## Executive Summary

This skill bible documents the exact organic content system generating $200K/month in profit from coaching/consulting—with only 26K YouTube subscribers and 26K email list. No massive following required. The key: the email list is king, all content feeds it, and value-dense emails create purchases. 80% of revenue comes from people who've already bought something.

**Key Quote:** "I need to get the maximum amount of people who have watched or consumed 10 hours of exposure to me. People who have consumed 10 hours of exposure are the most highly probable to convert and buy."

## Section 1: The Core Premise

### The 10-Hour Principle

**Goal:** Get maximum people to consume 10+ hours of your content.

**Why 10 hours:**
- Creates know, like, and trust
- People only buy from those they trust
- Trust requires exposure over time
- 10 hours = sufficient relationship building

### The Revenue Breakdown

**Daniel's $1.2M/month business:**
- ~$200K/month = Organic content → Coaching/consulting
- Rest = Software (ListKit) + paid ads

**Key insight:** ~60% of the $200K comes directly from email list.

## Section 2: The Email List is King

### Why Email Wins

| Channel | Exposure Control |
|---------|-----------------|
| YouTube | Algorithm decides |
| Social | Algorithm decides |
| Ads | Costs money |
| **Email** | **Free, unlimited access** |

**The math:**
- 3-6 emails per week
- To 26,000 people
- = 78,000-156,000 touches per month
- = Massive frequency at zero cost

### What Makes Emails Work

**NOT:** "Buy this! Book a call! Buy this!"

**YES:** Dense, useful information
- Essays explaining concepts
- Graphs and data
- Case study breakdowns
- Specific tactics working right now

**Result:** People respond saying "This email is so good!"
