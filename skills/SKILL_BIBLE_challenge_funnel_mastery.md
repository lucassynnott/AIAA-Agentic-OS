## Executive Summary

Challenge funnels and 3-day virtual events are "lump sum funnels" - structured events that generate significant revenue in concentrated windows. This skill bible covers the complete system: pricing strategy, promotion cycles, content structure, pitching mechanics, KPI expectations, and show rate optimization. When executed correctly, these events produce millions in compressed timeframes.

## Core Concept: The Lump Sum Funnel

**Why challenge funnels work:**
- Large revenue in compressed timeframe
- Multiple touch points build trust rapidly
- Low-ticket entry → high-ticket conversion
- Backend selling systems maximize show rates
- Pitch and repitch mechanics drive conversions

**Challenge Funnel vs 3-Day Virtual Event:**

| Type | Outcome Focus | Homework | Best For |
|------|---------------|----------|----------|
| **Challenge Funnel** | Tangible result by end | Yes, between days | Action-based learning (trading, skills) |
| **3-Day Virtual Event** | Awareness and education | Optional | Industry education, awareness building |

---

## The 3-Day Structure (Goldilocks Zone)

After extensive testing, 3 days is the proven optimal length:
- **Less than 3 days:** Risk making less revenue, insufficient trust-building
- **More than 3 days:** Diminishing returns, larger drop-off each day

### Day 1: All Content (4-6 hours)

**Opening: Get Them In The Game (Sessions 1-2)**
- Don't assume they're sold - they just paid for a ticket
- Origination story - how you got into this
- Why this topic/skill matters
- Background data and framing
- How "the game" works

**Middle: Further The Awareness (Sessions 3-5)**
- Deep-dive on specific topics
- Technical breakdowns
- Tools, platforms, strategies
- Make them feel they understand enough to decide

**Close: Homework Assignment (Challenge funnel only)**
- Give them something to DO between Day 1 and Day 2
- Example: Trading challenge - plot a strategy on a chart
- Creates involvement and ownership

**Day 1 Outcome Goal:**
> Aha moments - "That makes total sense. Can't believe I didn't know that. Glad I know it now."

This satisfaction is the "result" that triggers high-ticket purchasing behavior.

### Day 2: Content + Pitch (4-5 hours)

**First Half: Further Awareness with Supporting Characters**
- Bring in other speakers with different perspectives
- Same topic, different angles (like looking at an object from different sides)
- Can be external authorities OR internal team members
- Example: Head of Sales with M&A background, Head of Product with customer perspective

**Speaker Selection Criteria:**
1. Different perspective on the same central topic
2. Authority or expertise (doesn't have to be famous)
3. Strong speaking ability
4. Can endorse your approach from their worldview

**Pre-Pitch Session (Myron Golden Method)**

Before the actual pitch, deliver 1-3 minute stories that:
- Show characteristics of successful buyers
- Reframe objections before they arise
- Prime psychological readiness for investment
- Example: "Successful people compress timelines. They recognize when an opportunity presents itself and ACT."

**The Pitch**

End Day 2 with the actual pitch:
- Book a call (high ticket)
- Pay deposit to book call ($1K-$2K)
- Direct to checkout (lower ticket)

Then STOP. "Looking forward to seeing you on Day 3 tomorrow."

### Day 3: Repitch + Close (3-4 hours)

**Opening: The Repitch (Myron Golden Method)**

Much more direct than pre-pitch:
- Call out why people didn't buy
- Address specific objections
- Make them feel foolish for NOT taking action
- Get physical commitments (raise hand, stand up)
- Glorify those who take action

> "You had an opportunity yesterday to take action and be a first mover. Instead, you let that small tiny voice in your head dictate your life again."

**Objection Handling + Q&A**
- Answer questions on the offer
- Handle remaining objections publicly

**Second Repitch (Different Speaker)**
- Another person makes their version of the repitch
- Fresh voice, same urgency

**Silo Pitch (Optional - For Higher-Level Buyers)**
- Between Day 2 and Day 3, identify higher-level prospects
- Separate Zoom room for premium offer pitch
- Example: $9K main offer + $35K "scaling" offer for $1M+ businesses

**Closeout Talk**
- Pure content to end
- Tie a bow on everything learned
- Don't let them walk away feeling "sold at"
- Leave them feeling satisfied with the education

## Pricing Strategy

### Ticket Pricing Tiers

| Approach | Price | Tradeoff |
|----------|-------|----------|
| Low-end | $7-$9 | Same show rates, less qualified leads, less profitable front-end |
| Standard | $47-$97 | Balanced - profitable front-end, qualified buyers |
| Premium | $197-$247 | Most qualified leads, lower conversion rate, higher close rates |

**Key insight from Zach (PaidEvents.com):**
> "$7-$9 tickets produce the same show rates as $47-$97 tickets. The difference is lead quality."

**Rule:** Price relative to what you're selling on the backend:
- $3K-$5K backend → $47-$97 ticket works
- $15K+ backend → $197-$247 ticket produces higher close rates

### Pricing Timeline (60-Day Promotional Cycle)

| Phase | Timing | Price | Purpose |
|-------|--------|-------|---------|
| **Early Bird** | Day 1-14 | Lowest | Reward early action, build momentum |
| **Extended Early Bird** | Day 15-28 | Slight increase | Create urgency on first deadline |
| **Holiday Sale** (if applicable) | Variable | Special pricing | Capitalize on buying periods |
| **Regular Pricing** | Week before | Standard | Normal pricing window |
| **Last Minute/FOMO** | Final 48-72 hours | Highest | Punish procrastinators |

**Pro Tip:** Timer on sales page should count down to PRICE CHANGE, not event start (creates more urgency).

## Sales Page Best Practices

### Long Form Sales Page Structure

1. **Headline + Subheadline** - Outcome-based, no income claims
2. **Two-Step Order Form** OR **Character Photo + Text + CTA**
3. **Pricing Section with Timer** - Current price highlighted, future prices grayed
4. **Outcome Section** - What they'll achieve
5. **Agenda Section** - Day-by-day breakdown with outcome-based titles
6. **Speakers Section** - Headshots + bio (write bio around what they'll teach, not generic)
7. **Generic CTA Box** - Headline + button
8. **Pricing Table** - General Admission vs VIP comparison
9. **Another CTA Box** - Focus on objection handling
10. **FAQ Section** - Dropdown Q&As
11. **Final CTA Section**

### Order Form Page

- Two-step order form (Name/Email/Phone → Payment)
- Order bump checkbox
- Trust badges
- Testimonials
- **CRITICAL:** Chat bubble with live setter support
- Support email and phone number visible

**Pro Tip:** Pay setters $10-$20 per ticket sold through chat - recovers many almost-lost sales.

### Upsell Pages (OTO1, OTO2)

Simple format:
- Congratulations headline
- Short VSL explaining how it complements purchase
- Button to add
- Small "No thanks" link

### Confirmation Page = Call Funnel

Don't waste confirmation page:
- Congratulations message
- Expectations video
- Receipt
- **Embedded VSL + Application + Scheduler**
- Convert buyers to high-ticket BEFORE event starts

## KPI Expectations

### Free vs Paid Comparison

| Metric | Free Event | Paid Event |
|--------|------------|------------|
| **Day 1 Show Rate** | 10-20% | 70%+ |
| **Day 2 Show Rate** | ~50% of Day 1 | 60-65% |
| **Day 3 Show Rate** | Lower still | 50% |
| **Conversion Rate** | 1-3% of registrants | 3-7% (average), 10%+ (experienced) |

**Free Event Use Case:** Only viable with 100M+ monthly content viewers. Example: 150K registrants → 15-30K Day 1 → 7.5-15K Day 2 → 1-3% conversion still = profitable at scale.

### Paid Event Statistics

**Cost Per Purchase Components:**
- CPMs
- Link click-through rate
- Page conversion rate (5-15% is target range)
- AOV (ticket + upsells)

**Sales Page Conversion Benchmarks:**
- 5% = acceptable
- 10% = good
- 15% = exceptional (niche-specific, dialed messaging)

**Upsell Take Rates:**
- Minimum: 5%
- Target: 20-50% (if correctly complementary and priced right)

**The McDonald's Test for Upsells:**
- "Want fries with that?" → Makes total sense
- "Want to make it a large?" → Makes total sense
- "Want fries for $20 extra?" → Wrong pricing even if right offer

## Show Rate Optimization (Backend Selling Systems)

### The Justification Framework

**Front-end:** Scanner mode (conserving energy, checking if right for them)
**Back-end:** Justification mode (seeking information to decide)

**Interest Spectrum:**
1. Curious → 2. General Interest → 3. High Interest → 4. **Conviction** (deals happen here)

Your job: Raise interest level to conviction BEFORE Day 1.

### The Four Backend Selling Systems

#### 1. Hammer Them Campaign (Paid)

Upload buyer list and hammer with content:
- 30-50 short-form pieces
- 15-30 long-form pieces
- Run as engagement campaigns (ThruPlay video views)
- Frequency goal: 15-20 impressions

**Content Categories:**
- Questions prospects have
- Second layer questions
- Objections
- Expectations

#### 2. Value Dense Email Sequences (Free)

Not just reminder emails - actual VALUE in the email body:
- Don't rely on click-through (single digits)
- Put the content IN the email (50-70% open rates)
- Educate and excite
- Raise interest levels

#### 3. Confirmation Page Best Practices (Free)

**Breakout Videos:**
- 1-3 minute videos on confirmation page
- Address common questions/concerns
- Build trust immediately post-purchase
- 3-19 videos depending on complexity

#### 4. SDR/Setter Outreach (Free)

Manual human outreach:
- Double dial + text
- Look them up (application data, social, CRM)
- Ask strategic questions about WHY they're interested
- Send TAILORED resources based on their specific situation
- Establish relationship for post-event follow-up

**The Script:**
> "Hey, what got you interested in [topic]?"  
> "Great - I've got a few things that could help before the event. Want me to send via text, email, or both?"  
> "By the way, if you have any questions or tech issues, I'm your contact. Here's my cell."

### Apply Systems Between ALL Days

| Between | Hammer Them | Emails | Setters | Notes |
|---------|-------------|--------|---------|-------|
| Purchase → Day 1 | ✓ Full | ✓ Full | ✓ Initial outreach | Longest window |
| Day 1 → Day 2 | ✓ Blast | ✓ Brief | "How was Day 1? Day 2 is MOST important" | Short window |
| Day 2 → Day 3 | ✓ Blast | ✓ Brief | Follow up on pitch response | Close it out |

## Financial Modeling

### Profitability Goal

> **Ideal:** Be profitable on ticket sales + upsells BEFORE the event starts

If profitable going in:
- Unlimited budget to acquire ticket buyers
- More buyers = more high-ticket conversions
- Scales indefinitely

**AOV must exceed Cost Per Purchase:**
- If AOV is half of CPP → fronting 50 cents per buyer
- Track: Ticket price + Upsell 1 take rate + Upsell 2 take rate = AOV

### Zoom Costs at Scale

5,000-10,000+ attendees = $10,000-$15,000+ for Zoom Webinar
- Factor into upfront costs
- More tech complexity at high scale
- Worth it for multi-million dollar events

---

## Common Mistakes

1. **Only using reminder emails** - Need value-dense content, not just "don't forget!"
2. **Assuming ticket buyers are sold** - They raised hand, they're NOT committed yet
3. **Wrong upsell selection** - Must directly complement the event topic
4. **Pricing upsells too high** - Even right offer fails with wrong price
5. **Skipping pre-pitch** - Going straight to pitch without framing = lower conversion
6. **No repitch on Day 3** - Leaving money on table
7. **Generic speaker bios** - Bio should explain what they'll TEACH, not generic background
8. **Timer to event start** - Timer should be to PRICE CHANGE for urgency
9. **No chat support on order form** - Losing people with questions/tech issues
10. **Free events without massive audience** - Only works with 100M+ monthly viewers
