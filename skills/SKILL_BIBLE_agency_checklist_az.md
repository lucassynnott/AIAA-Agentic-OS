# SKILL BIBLE: A-Z Agency Building Checklist to $50K/Month (Daniel Fazio Method)

## Executive Summary

This skill bible documents the complete checklist for building a successful agency from scratch to $50K/month. Based on Client Ascension's systematic approach with 1,000+ B2B clients. The framework covers 6 domains: Offer, Funnel, Cold Email, Sales Calls, Service Delivery, Hiring, and Branding. The key insight: there are only so many things you need to do—treat this as a checklist.

**Key Quote:** "The reason why Client Ascension works is it's a system and it's systemized because there's only so many things that you need to do."

---

## Section 1: The Offer

### Three Components

1. **What you do** (Service)
2. **Who you serve** (Target)
3. **Terms** (Risk reversal, pricing, guarantee)

### Common Mistakes

**Problem 1:** "I do all kinds of stuff for all kinds of people"

**Fix:** One clear thing → One clear person → One clear outcome → One clear risk reversal → One clear evidence

### Demand Capture vs. Demand Generation

| Type | Definition | Example | Marketing Approach |
|------|------------|---------|-------------------|
| **Demand Capture** | Solving for people already searching | Web design, bounce house rental | High volume required OR morph to generation |
| **Demand Generation** | Creating desire that didn't exist | Lead gen, cold email agency | Can use outbound effectively |

**Example transformation:**
- Demand capture: "We build websites"
- Demand generation: "We build websites with fraud monitoring software for high-volume ecommerce"

### Market Sophistication Levels

| Level | Competitors | What Works |
|-------|------------|------------|
| Level 1 | Zero | Say anything, it sells |
| Level 2 | Few | Make a claim |
| Level 3 | Many | Claim + risk reversal |
| Level 4 | Lots | Claim + guarantee + evidence |
| Level 5 | Maximum | All above + personal branding + content |

**Examples of Level 5:**
- Ecommerce email marketing
- Facebook ads for ecommerce
- Coaching business email marketing

### The Level 5 Reality

**Critical insight:** Every offer will eventually become Level 5.

**Therefore:** Position yourself for Level 5 from day one.

**Required elements:**
- Specific claim
- Risk reversal
- Aggregated evidence
- Content marketing (upfront value)

## Section 2: The Funnel

### Minimum Viable Funnel

```
Headline (with claim)
      ↓
    VSL
      ↓
Book a Call Button
      ↓
Type-form Assessment
      ↓
   Calendar
      ↓
 Automations
```

### The VSL Non-Negotiable

**99% of people who enter Client Ascension don't have a VSL.**

**This is non-negotiable.** Not a suggestion. Not a debate.

**Why:** When you cold email someone, they WILL Google you. They MUST see you. They MUST hear you.

### VSL Structure

1. What's the problem this audience has?
2. How have they tried to solve it that hasn't worked?
3. How is your way different?
4. What are the terms of solving this?
5. Social proof
6. Call to action

### Production Requirements

**Not required:**
- Hollywood production
- Expensive equipment
- Professional editing

**Required:**
- Phone recording
- Subtitles
- Clear audio

**Time to create:** 2-3 days max (experienced: 1 hour)

### Automation Checklist

- [ ] Email notification when call booked
- [ ] Text notification when call booked
- [ ] Confirmation to prospect
- [ ] Calendar integration working

---

## Section 3: Cold Email

### The Three Parts

1. Lead generation
2. Writing/crafting emails
3. Responding to replies

### Lead Gen Tools

**Legacy stack issues:**
- Apollo: 40-50% emails are garbage
- Built With: Gives domains, not emails, requires enrichment
- Multiple tools: Expensive, time-consuming

**Solution:** Use verified email services (like ListKit)

### The Holistic System Reality

**Cold email is NOT isolated.** Everything must work together:

| Component | Must Be Right |
|-----------|---------------|
| Offer | ✓ |
| VSL | ✓ |
| Landing page | ✓ |
| Strategy | ✓ |
| Leads | ✓ |
| Email copy | ✓ |
| Follow-ups | ✓ |
| Response handling | ✓ |

**Miss any one = System fails**

### Strategy Depends on Sophistication

Market sophistication determines:
- Script approach
- Whether you need Loom videos
- Follow-up sequence
- Response handling tactics

### The 90-Day Rule

**Everything you want in business is gated behind 90-day increments.**

**Why:**
- Everyone has their own conversion cycle
- Not the right time for most people
- Different angles work over time
- Compounding effect requires consistency

**Common mistake:** Turning off campaigns after 2 weeks because "it's not working."

**Reality:** You'll get responses from people emailed 5 months ago.

### Volume Requirements

| Offer Type | Required Volume |
|------------|-----------------|
| Demand capture | HIGH (10K+ monthly) |
| Demand generation | Medium (5K+ monthly) |

---

## Section 4: Sales Calls

### The Setting Call

**Purpose:** Collect data, see if it makes sense to help

**Questions based on:** Offer type (demand capture vs generation)

### The Closing Call

**Purpose:** Present proposal, close the deal

**The ROI Calculator Approach:**

```
1. "Thanks for getting on the phone"
2. "You're a business owner, you want ROI"
3. "Let's break down numbers together"
4. "What's the probability we can make you profit?"
5. "I don't want to take money if I can't deliver return"
```

**Example script:**
- What are your current metrics?
- Here's what we can get them to
- Here's how much more revenue that means
- Here's how much you'd be leaving on the table
- Here's what it costs to work with us

### The Conviction Factor

**#1 Problem:** People unconsciously sabotage because they're not confident they can deliver.

**Symptoms:**
- Scared to get on sales calls
- Sabotaging lead generation
- Not responding to interested prospects
- Avoiding follow-up

**Solution:** Risk reversal isn't just for clients—it's for YOU.

### Sales Call Checklist

- [ ] Extremely confident going in
- [ ] Logical, number-based presentation
- [ ] ROI is obvious to prospect
- [ ] High close rate
- [ ] No emotional selling (B2B is logic-driven)

## Section 5: Service Delivery

### Two Components of Client Retention

1. **Client Results** (outcomes)
2. **Client Experience** (relationship)

### The Client Experience Problem

**Scenario:**
- You make client $20K/month
- You charge $3K/month
- You barely talk to them
- Competitor emails: "We can make you $40K/month"
- Client leaves

**Why:** Results became commoditized. No loyalty because no relationship.

### Building Client Experience

**What they want:**
- Attention
- To be heard
- Clear next steps
- Not to feel lost

**How to provide:**
- Direct handoff from sales to fulfillment
- No blank space after payment
- Clear checklist for onboarding
- Regular communication
- Real-time updates

### The Relationship Protection

**If they like you:** They give you leeway to fix problems
**If they don't like you:** First competitor email = gone

### Retention Tactics

- [ ] Send gifts (chocolates, etc.)
- [ ] Do spaces/podcasts together
- [ ] Hang out when possible
- [ ] Be upfront about timelines
- [ ] Communicate delays proactively
- [ ] Consider their schedule, not just yours

---

## Section 6: Hiring

### Common Problems

1. Not hiring at all
2. Not hiring good people
3. Not knowing what to hire for
4. Not knowing how to train

### The Training Reality

Hiring someone = MORE work initially:
- Still doing the thing
- ALSO training them

Then tapers off as they become capable.

### Client Management Infrastructure

Required:
- Task tracking system
- Progress visibility
- Client status dashboard
- Communication protocols

### Team Retention

**Question:** How do you get people to:
- Buy into you
- Want to stick with you
- Go above and beyond

**Answer:** Company culture + relationships + teamwork + events

---

## Section 7: Branding

### Why It's Required (Not Optional)

Level 5 sophistication = Must do content marketing.

If not Level 5 now, you WILL BE Level 5 eventually.

### What to Create

**Value-based content that:**
- Shows people how to do what you do
- Lets them theoretically do it themselves

### Why This Works for B2B

**B2B buyers are busy.** They watch your content and think:
- "I could do this myself..."
- "But I don't have time"
- "I'll just hire this guy to accelerate"

### The YouTube Effect

**One YouTube video = Automatic top 1%**

**Why:** For every expert, there's an expectation they have videos.
- No videos = Not an expert
- Videos exist = Must be expert

### The Competition Test

Same landing page, same VSL text, same email copy, same list, same deliverability...

**But one has 1 YouTube video.**

Person with video wins 100% of the time.

### The Google Test

Everyone you cold email who's interested WILL Google you.

If nothing exists: You're an internet scammer to them.

### Branding Checklist

- [ ] Positioning as expert on X topic
- [ ] People refer to you as the X expert
- [ ] YouTube videos exist
- [ ] LinkedIn presence
- [ ] Twitter/X presence
- [ ] Content gives upfront value
