# SKILL BIBLE: $829K Month Breakdown - Daniel Fazio Complete System

## Executive Summary

This skill bible documents every input required to generate $829,000 in a single month. Covers content (Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube), paid ads ($174K spend → $586K attributed), newsletter (23 emails, 367K deliveries), team structure (56 people across 2 companies), and offer stack. The key insight: it's orders of magnitude beyond what most think is normal, but it's profoundly straightforward.

**Key Quote:** "I guarantee that if 99% of people who desperately want to hit 100K a month did an audit of your past 30 days, you'd find you have done very little outreach, zero follow-up, not reviewed a single sales call, produced zero useful content."

## Section 1: The Brutal Audit

### What Most People Aren't Doing

| Activity | What They Should Do | What They Actually Do |
|----------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Outreach | 300+/day | Near zero |
| Follow-up | Daily on all leads | Zero |
| Sales call review | Weekly | Never |
| Content | Daily | Maybe weekly |

**The truth:** Most people want $100K/month but won't go to bed at 10pm and wake up at 6am.

---

## Section 2: Content System

### Twitter Strategy

**Analytics (4-week span):**
- 1.3 million impressions
- 6,200 profile visits
- Substantial link clicks

**The obvious correlation:**
```
November 12: 8 tweets → 142,000 impressions
Weekend: Fewer tweets → Fewer impressions
Other days: 8-9 posts → 48,000-74,000 impressions
```

**The formula:** More tweets = More impressions (1:1 correlation)

---

### LinkedIn Strategy

**Results:** 69,691 impressions from 2 posts/day

**Process:**
1. Write for email newsletter
2. Team transforms email into LinkedIn posts
3. Post once per day
4. Don't accept connection requests (too many pitches)

**Note:** Not optimized. Just posts there and moves on.

---

### YouTube Strategy

**28-day analytics:**
- 44,000 views
- 539 new subscribers
- 2,800 hours watch time

**The $1,000/hour rule:**
- B2B: 1 hour watched ≈ $1,000 purchasing propensity
- 2,800 hours = $280,000 potential purchasing power

**SEO approach:**
1. Use VidIQ for search volume
2. Search the term yourself
3. Watch competing videos
4. Make a better version
5. Rank and compound

**The compounding effect:**
| Video | Age | Monthly Views |
|-------|-----|---------------|
| $5M VSL Script | 1 year | 2,600 |
| Twitter Masterclass | 2 years | 1,400 |
| VidIQ topic | 6 months | 1,200 |
| VidIQ topic | 2 months | Still ranking |

**With 100-200 videos:** Views stack and compound automatically.

## Section 3: Paid Ads System

### The Numbers

**October spend:** $174,100
**Attributed revenue:** $586,000
**ROAS:** 4x

**Attribution rule:** If clicked ad and converted within 5 days = ad attributed

### The Funnel Structure

```
Direct Offer Ad
       ↓
Opt-in Page (name, email, phone)
       ↓
VSL Page
       ↓
Application (qualifies/disqualifies)
       ↓
Calendly (only if qualified)
       ↓
Sales Call → Client
```

**Parallel paths after opt-in:**
- Email → Infinite sequence (forever)
- Phone → Setters calling and texting

### Ad Creative Volume

**October:** 156 individual unique ad creatives launched

**Why so many?**
- AI ad managers find winners automatically
- More creatives = More chances for winners
- Can't scale without creative volume

**Same principle as content:**
- Want money from content? Post tons of content
- Want money from ads? Make tons of creatives

---

## Section 4: Newsletter System

### The Numbers

**October:**
- 23 total emails sent
- 2,234 total clicks
- 367,000 messages delivered

### Email Topics (Examples)

- How to kill your business in 7 days flat
- The best VSL outline structure
- The inputs required to hit 50K/month
- Offers versus just a thing
- Drop-offs and constraints
- How many sales calls to hit 500K/month
- How to use ChatGPT to predict objections

### The Theme

**Be useful.** Give practical tips on making more money.

**Frequency target:** 5 emails per week

### Subscriber Sources

1. **Ads** - Opt-in funnels
2. **Content** - Links in descriptions
3. **Any client ascension URL** - Captures email
4. **Direct signup link**

### The Hidden Attribution

**Critical insight:**
- Someone comes from ad
- Converts later from email
- Still attributes to ad

**Reality:** Without email, ad revenue would be ~50% of reported number.

## Section 5: The Daily Routine

### Daniel's Schedule

```
5:30 AM - Wake up
6:30 AM - At desk (filming this video at this time)
         ↓
All day - Content creation, ads, strategy
         ↓
~4:00 PM - Done with focused work
```

**The requirement:**
- Go to bed at decent hour
- Wake up early
- Actually do the work
- Do things you don't feel like doing

**The paradox:**
- People will do "anything" for $100K/month
- Except the actual things that work
