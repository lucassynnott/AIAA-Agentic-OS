## The Four Problems That Stop Every Service Business

### Problem 1: Not Enough Traffic

**If people don't know about you, they can't buy from you.**

This is the root of most problems in service businesses.

**Four Traffic Sources:**

| Source | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| Paid Ads | Scalable, massive reach | Costs money |
| Content | Builds authority, free | Time consuming |
| Outreach | Cheap, direct contact | Least authoritative, time consuming |
| Partnerships | Scalable, profitable | Hardest to form |

**Critical Insight: Do ALL Four**

> "The worst advice you can possibly get is to stick to one channel and master it."

**Why All Four Work Together:**
- Seen your ads + content → More likely to respond to outreach
- Click on ad + ton of content on profile → More likely to take action
- Looking for partnership + see you everywhere → Less risky to partner with

### Problem 2: Not Enough Leads

**Two Requirements:**
1. Right type of traffic (not just any traffic)
2. Assets and system to capture and nurture

**Three Main Tools:**

1. **Multiple Lead Magnets (6-12)**
   - Think of as mini-courses
   - Each solves ONE problem completely
   - Break service into categories

2. **30-Day Email Flow**
   - Brainstorm 30 FAQs/objections
   - Address one per email
   - Use stories, examples, case studies
   - Goal: Overcome all objections → They book call

3. **Thank You Page**
   - Sales letter answering all questions
   - VSL showing your face
   - Book a call button

**Example: YouTube Agency Lead Magnets**
- Ideas
- Scripts
- Titles
- Thumbnails
- Editing
- Camera setup
- Microphone setup
- Speaking on camera
- Analytics
- Funnels

**Why Multiple Lead Magnets:**
1. Not everyone has same problem
2. Each step represents a reason NOT to buy
3. Missing any = objection that stops the sale

### Problem 3: All Clients Come From Referrals

**Problems with Referral-Only:**
- Out of your control
- Can't scale referrals on demand
- Unpredictable
- Constant anxiety about next client
- Can't confidently hire or reinvest

**Solution:** Problems 1 and 2 solve this automatically.

### Problem 4: No Way to Monetize Unqualified Leads

**Reality:** 99% of leads are unqualified.

| Reason | % of Market |
|--------|-------------|
| Price (can't afford) | ~33% |
| Fit (don't need) | ~33% |
| Timing (not ready) | ~33% |

**The Offer Suite Solution:**

| Qualification Level | Offer |
|--------------------|-------|
| Qualified | Recurring service, Intro offer |
| Barely unqualified | Course, Program, Referral fee |
| Very unqualified | Digital product, Affiliate links |

**The Math:**
- $1M service @ 25% margin = $250K profit
- $1M other offers @ ~100% margin = $1M profit
- **Double revenue, 5x profit**

## The Constraint Cycle

**One of these four problems is always the biggest.**

Solve it → Experience growth → Hit new plateau → Another becomes biggest → Solve it → Repeat

**Example Cycle:**
1. Traffic is constraint → Post ads, content, outreach
2. No lead capture system → Build lead magnets, flows
3. Can't monetize unqualified → Build offer suite
4. Traffic is constraint again → Improve/scale traffic

---

## Quick Reference Metrics

### Traffic
- 3.5%+ outbound CTR = resonating ad
- <$10 CPC = acceptable
- >$10 CPC = fix your ads

### Landing Page
- 10%+ application rate target
- <10% = not enough info, proof, or VSSL

### Show Rate
- 70%+ target
- <70% = improve thank you page, pre-call flow, retargeting

### Close Rate
- 15-20% on cold traffic at scale
- 50-70% from content (warm)
