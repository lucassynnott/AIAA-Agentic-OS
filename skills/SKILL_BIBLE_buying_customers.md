# SKILL BIBLE: Buying Customers ($10.9M Method) - Daniel Fazio

## Executive Summary

This skill bible documents the framework for literally purchasing customers through strategic capital deployment. Made $10.9M using this approach. The key insight: customers can be bought just like any other asset. The only question is how much you're willing to spend relative to lifetime value. When you don't have money, spend time. When you have money, spend money.

**Key Quote:** "The only way you can ever make money at all ever in existence is either because you have time or because you have money. If you don't have one, you better spend the other."

## Section 1: The Core Philosophy

### Customers Are Purchasable

**Just like other assets:**
- Shares of a company = Purchasing cash flow
- Rental property = Purchasing income-producing asset
- Customers = Purchasing future revenue

**Example:**
- Buy company for $5M
- Generates $1M/year cash flow
- You purchased that income

**You can do this on a MICRO level every single day.**

---

## Section 2: Lifetime Value (LTV)

### The Foundation Formula

```
LTV = Average Monthly Revenue × Average Customer Lifespan
```

**Example:**
- Service: $2,000/month
- Average client stays: 6 months
- LTV = $2,000 × 6 = $12,000

### Why LTV Matters

**If LTV = $12,000:**
- You should be willing to spend $2,000-6,000 to acquire
- Ideally lower, but don't be afraid of the math

### The Critical Mindset Shift

**Beginner thinking:** "I don't want to spend money to get customers"

**Advanced thinking:** "Clients don't pop out of nowhere. Resources must be expended."

---

## Section 3: Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

### The Economics

**CAC examples:**
- Spend $2,000 to acquire $2,000/month client = 1x ROAS
- Spend $100 to acquire $100 customer = 1x ROAS

**Why 1x ROAS makes sense:**

| Front-End | Back-End |
|-----------|----------|
| $1,500 offer | → |
| $1,500 ad spend | → |
| 1x ROAS (break even) | → $900-2,000 additional LTV |

**You're not making money on front-end. You're buying the back-end.**

---

## Section 4: Self-Liquidating Funnels

### What Is Self-Liquidating?

**Definition:** Spending money on ads to acquire customers where the front-end sale covers the ad cost.

**Example:**
- Front-end product: $1,500
- Ad spend to acquire: $1,500
- ROAS: 1x
- Profit on front-end: $0
- Back-end LTV: $900-2,000

**Why do this?**
- You're buying PURCHASERS (10-100x more valuable than leads)
- Purchasers convert to high-ticket at much higher rates

### Purchasers vs. Leads

| Metric | Leads (Freebie Seekers) | Purchasers |
|--------|------------------------|------------|
| Per 1,000 | 1-2 become clients | ~50 become clients |
| Quality | Many are broke | Proven buyers |
| Value | Low | 10-100x higher |

**This is why $10-20 products exist.** Nobody makes money on them. They're buying purchasers.

## Section 5: Time vs. Money Exchange

### The Two Resources

| Resource | When to Use | How to Use |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| **Time** | When you have no money | Manual work, outreach |
| **Money** | When you have capital | Buy other people's time |

### Money = Higher Dimensional Time

**Trade sequence:**
1. Trade time → Get money
2. Trade money → Buy back MORE time
3. Trade that time → Get MORE money
4. Repeat (stepping ladder up)

**The leverage game:**
- Start with 0 money, 24 hours
- Trade hours for dollars
- Use dollars to buy tools that multiply hours
- Use multiplied output for more dollars
- Continue until rich

## Section 6: The Client Acquisition Order

### For Beginners (Low Capital)

**Order of priority:**

1. **Cold Outreach (First)**
   - Why: More time intensive than money intensive
   - Works fast
   - High feedback loops
   - Free (just your time)

2. **Content (Second)**
   - Why: You now have something to talk about (clients)
   - Slow feedback loop but compounds
   - Builds while doing outreach

3. **Ads (Third)**
   - Why: Requires capital
   - Fast results when scaled
   - Self-liquidating funnels

### Why This Order?

**Cold outreach first because:**
- Spin up offer
- DM 50 people
- See response
- Adjust next day
- FREE iteration

**Content second because:**
- Need client experience to have content
- Need stories from actual work
- Takes time to build audience

**Ads third because:**
- Need money to test
- Need offer proven via cold outreach
- Need understanding of conversion math

## Section 7: The Leverage Progression

### Stage 1: Manual Cold Outreach

- DM/email 20-50 people/day
- Completely free
- 100% time investment

### Stage 2: Add Tools

After first client money:
- Buy ListKit ($79 for 2,000 prospects)
- Buy SmartLead (automated sending)
- Scale to 300+ emails/day automatically

### Stage 3: Add Content

Parallel to outreach:
- Make YouTube video weekly
- Repurpose to Twitter/LinkedIn
- Build audience while closing clients

### Stage 4: Self-Liquidating Funnels

Once you have capital:
- Create low-ticket offer
- Run ads to break even
- Nurture purchasers to high-ticket

## Section 8: The Machine Mindset

### Employee Thinking vs. Owner Thinking

**Employee thinking:**
- "I get this customer"
- "I do manual labor"
- "I wait to get paid"
- Limited to personal capacity

**Owner thinking:**
- "I expend economic resources"
- "I have others do labor"
- "I'm making a calculated bet"
- Unlimited scale potential

### The Casino Analogy

**You are the house:**
- You're gambling
- But you can influence the odds
- If variable doesn't convert, adjust it
- Increase probability of desired outcome

## Section 10: The Float Problem

### What Is Float?

**Definition:** The capital you need to bridge the gap between spending and receiving payment.

**Example:**
- Spend $2,000 to acquire client
- Client pays $2,000/month
- Break even at end of month 1
- Profit starts month 2

### If You Can't Float

**Solution:** Spend time instead of money.

The same leverage exists:
- Time → First clients
- First clients → Money
- Money → Tools
- Tools → More clients
- More clients → More money
