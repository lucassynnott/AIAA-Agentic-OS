# SKILL BIBLE: Three Agency Models to $10 Million/Year

> Source: Matthew Larsen (1000x Leads)
> Context: The only 3 business models that can reach $10M/year - from 550+ agency owners analyzed

---

## Executive Summary

Most agencies don't have the unit economics to reach $10M/year. There are only three models that work: Factory (volume), Ultra High Ticket (premium), and Performance-Only (pay-per-result). Mixing these models doesn't work. Pick one and build everything around it.

---

## The Three Models

| Model | Price Point | Clients Needed | Core Requirement |
|-------|-------------|----------------|------------------|
| Factory | $5K/month | ~166 clients | Productized offer |
| Ultra High Ticket | $300K+/year | ~33 clients | Premium positioning |
| Performance-Only | Pay per result | Variable | Must get results |

**Critical Rule:**
> "Mixing these things doesn't really work in a way that's going to get you to $10 million a year or more."

---

## Model 1: Factory Approach

### The Math

```
$10M / $5,000 / 12 months = 166 clients
```

**At $5K/month, you need ~166 concurrent clients.**

### Real-World Example (Larsen's Agency)

```
Direct Clients: 49 clients × $9,500/month = $465K/month
White Label: 77 partners × $5,000/month = $385K/month
Total MRR: ~$850K/month
Annual: $10.2M/year
```

### Requirements to Make It Work

| Requirement | Threshold |
|-------------|-----------|
| Monthly churn | ≤ 10% |
| Qualified leads/day | 10+ |
| Close rate | ~20% |
| Client success rate | 75%+ |
| Price per client | $5K+/month |

### Why $5K Minimum Matters

**At $2,500/month:** Need 333 clients
- When accounting for churn → Not feasible
- Lead generation at that scale → Not feasible in most markets

### When Factory Doesn't Work

If ANY of these are true, go back to drawing board:
- Can't get below 10% monthly churn
- Can't generate 10 qualified leads/day
- Only 30-50% of clients get results
- Can't charge $5K/month

### How to Fix It

1. **Pricing issues** - Often self-limiting belief, not market reality
2. **Value** - Productize, same service over and over
3. **Niche selection** - Choose niche with guaranteed results
   - Good: "Lead generation for business loans"
   - Bad: "Facebook ads for e-commerce stores" (no transferable learning)
4. **Market size** - Must be large enough for 166+ clients

---

## Model 2: Ultra High Ticket

### The Math

```
$10M / $100K = 100 clients needed
$10M / $300K = 33 clients needed
```

**Recommendation:** Don't do this for less than $300K/year ($25K/month)

> "It's very easy to get 1-2 or maybe 3-4 of these clients per month if you have the right service. That's easier than getting 333 clients in factory approach."

### Best Niches for Ultra High Ticket

| Niche | Why It Works |
|-------|--------------|
| Lead generation (high-value industries) | Clear ROI |
| Affiliate offers | Performance-tied |
| Info/coaching businesses | Growth partner model |
| Enterprise services | Large budgets |

**Not good for:**
- E-commerce agencies
- Local lead gen
- SaaS services
- LTVs just won't be high enough

### Requirements

**1. Network/Personal Brand Heavy**
> "You cannot do this without knowing the right people, without being around decision makers."

**2. Long Sales Cycle**
- Not call funnels from ads
- Playing the long game
- Content-driven trust building

**3. Perception = Reality**

When selling to large companies:
- You're not dealing with founders
- You're dealing with Head of Marketing
- If they hire you and you fail → They can get fired

> "No one gets fired for hiring Amazon Web Services or the leading provider in their niche."

**Perception that you deliver results is as important as actually delivering.**

### When Ultra High Ticket Doesn't Work

- Can't charge $300K+/year
- Don't have network/personal brand
- Can't build trust over long sales cycle
- Niche doesn't support premium pricing

---

## Model 3: Performance-Only

### The Key Word

> "The key word in performance-only business model is PERFORMANCE. If your service sucks, this is not for you."

### When Performance Works

> "If you find yourself providing $50K/month in value for $5K, you might as well switch to performance-only."

**You take the risk yourself:**
- Generate leads through ads/outreach (your cost)
- Sell results (leads, sales, etc.) to clients
- No retainer, no "working for them" dynamic
- You're a vendor, not a service provider

### Examples

| Before (Retainer) | After (Performance) |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| $5K/month for lead gen | $200/lead sold |
| $10K/month for FB ads | CPA-based payment |
| $8K/month management fee | Revenue share |

### The Ultimate Vision

> "In my view, the end of all agencies is a performance-only model - if the situation warrants it."

**Exception:** Some services don't have performance models (e.g., best web designer → ultra high ticket)

### Requirements

- Must actually get results consistently
- Must be able to front the risk (ad spend, etc.)
- Must have predictable cost per result
- Must have service where results are measurable

## Why Mixing Doesn't Work

**Common broken patterns:**

| Pattern | Problem |
|---------|---------|
| 1-2 performance clients + rest retainer | Split focus, inconsistent systems |
| Factory approach with custom work | Can't systematize, can't scale |
| One big client + many small | Dependency + distraction |

> "They'll have bits and pieces of all three models, but they don't really work when you mix them."

## The Exit Math

**Common Goal:**
- $10M/year revenue
- 30% profit margin = $3M profit
- 3-5x multiple = $9-15M exit

**Each model can achieve this, but:**
- Factory: Most predictable, highest volume
- Ultra High Ticket: Highest margins, lowest volume
- Performance: Highest risk/reward, most scalable

---
