# SKILL BIBLE: Offer Formulation (Daniel Fazio Method)

## Executive Summary

This skill bible documents Daniel Fazio's four-component offer formulation system used to create offers that clients actually buy. The framework in descending importance: Specific Problem → Unique Mechanism → Pricing/Terms → Risk Reversal. The core insight: you must work TOP-DOWN (problem first), not BOTTOM-UP (skill first). Starting with a skill and working backward is why most people fail.

**Key Quote:** "Most of you are guilty of picking a high-income skill like copywriting or Facebook ads and trying to work backwards on the formulation chart. Start here and go down. This is the wrong way to do it."

## Section 1: The Four-Component Framework

### Descending Order of Importance

```
1. SPECIFIC PROBLEM (Most Important)
   ↓
2. UNIQUE MECHANISM
   ↓
3. PRICING AND TERMS
   ↓
4. RISK REVERSAL (Amplifier only)
```

### The Cancer Test

If you have cancer with 6 months to live, you'll try:
- Experimental drugs (unknown mechanism)
- At any price (pricing irrelevant)
- With no guarantee (risk reversal irrelevant)

**Why?** The problem is big enough. Nothing else matters.

### Component Relationships

| Have | Don't Have | Result |
|------|------------|--------|
| Problem + Mechanism | Pricing/Terms | Can charge premium |
| Problem only | Mechanism | Need strong pricing/risk reversal |
| Nothing | Problem or Mechanism | Will not work |

---

## Section 2: Specific Problem

### The #1 Rule

**You need to know the actual problems a niche is having instead of making it up.**

Most failures come from:
1. Picking a skill (copywriting, ads, etc.)
2. Picking a random niche
3. Making up a problem
4. Wondering why no one buys

### Problem Precision Examples

| Company | Precision Problem | Why It Works |
|---------|-------------------|--------------|
| HighROS | "Ad attribution with pixels is horrible and doesn't work" | Real, measurable pain |
| Cole Gordon | "You're not getting enough calls from your opt-ins" | Specific bottleneck |
| UGC Agency | "You spend 20 hours/week on influencer outreach" | Quantified time sink |

### Finding Real Problems (The Direct Method)

**Step 1:** Identify your target niche (e.g., "SaaS companies who just raised Seed/Series A")

**Step 2:** Find their contact info (email, Twitter, LinkedIn)

**Step 3:** Send this message:
```
Hey [Name],

I'm thinking about starting up an agency or service company of 
some sort and thought of [SaaS companies] as a niche.

What problems do you guys actually have? I don't want to sit 
here and make something up. I want to solve a real problem.
```

**Why it works:** You're being a human talking to a human, not a salesperson.

### The Individualization Principle

```
Response Rate
     ↑
     |      ███████
     |    ███████
     |  ███████
     |███████
     └──────────────→
         Individualization Level
```

**Rule:** "Your scripts will perform 100x better the closer they become to having not been possible to have been sent to somebody else."

---

## Section 3: Unique Mechanism

### Turning a Skill Into a System

**Wrong approach:** "I'm an email copywriter who writes good emails"

**Right approach:** Transform it into a SYSTEM:

**Example (Email Copywriter):**
```
"Coaching/info product owners make a huge mistake with their email list. 
All they do is pitch pitch pitch, book a call book a call.

Nobody shows any personality. Cold traffic that comes in immediately 
unsubscribes. You burn the lead forever.

You need to play the long game. Not everybody knows who you are. You 
have to show them your personality on the email list.

I get on interviews with my clients—almost like a therapist. I ask 
questions and dig deep. I hypnotize myself into becoming them. 

I write emails that show their personality, completely indistinguishable 
from them actually writing it."
```

**Result:** Goes from "hard to sell commodity" to "extremely appealing unique system."

### System Components

A unique mechanism includes:
1. **Diagnosis:** What others are doing wrong
2. **Philosophy:** Your contrarian approach
3. **Process:** Your specific methodology
4. **Proof:** Why this works better

### Client Ascension's Unique System (Example)

**The Ascension Scaling System:**
```
Step 1: Offer formulation
Step 2: VSL and landing page copy
Step 3: Cold email setup
Step 4: Content marketing setup + templates
        → Hit $15K-$20K/month

Step 5: Learn to hire and build systems
Step 6: Replicate Steps 1-4 many times
Step 7: Hire sales team
        → Hit $100K/month
```

**What makes it unique:**
- Specific sequence
- Clear milestones
- Repeatable process
- Defined outcomes at each stage

---

## Section 4: Pricing and Terms

### Two Offer Types

**1. Performative Offer:**
- Promises specific quantifiable result
- Examples: Ad agency (ROAS), lead gen agency (calls booked)
- Pricing: ~5x ROI for client

**2. Productized Service:**
- Based solely on deliverables
- Results not dependent on you
- Examples: Video editing, design agency
- Pricing: Relative perception + value add

### Sophisticated vs Unsophisticated Buyers

```
UNSOPHISTICATED (Small business):
Price ↑ = Harder to sell
Price ↓ = Easier to sell

SOPHISTICATED (Large business):
Price ↑ = EASIER to sell
Price ↓ = HARDER to sell (suspicious)
```

**Why large companies want higher prices:**
- Low price = "They don't know what they're doing"
- High price = confidence, quality signal
- Nobody looks for second-best solution

### Pricing Rules

**If you're a beginner with no results:**
- Charge performance basis
- Align your incentives with client
- You'll feel like garbage taking money without delivering

**If you have results:**
- Charge enough to outsource and still profit 60%+
- Every minute of labor costs something
- You cannot scale without margin

### The Pricing Mistake Example

**Client's offer:**
- 60 short-form content pieces
- 4 long-form YouTube videos
- Price: $2,000/month

**Problem:**
- YouTube editing is labor-intensive
- No profit margin to hire
- Can never take another client
- Business cannot scale

**Rule:** "Charge enough money to where you could outsource labor and still profit."

## Section 5: Risk Reversal

### When Risk Reversal Matters

**If you have Problem + Mechanism:** Risk reversal is just an amplifier

**If you don't have Problem OR Mechanism:** Risk reversal must be STRONG to compensate

### Types of Risk Reversal (Descending Strength)

1. **You don't pay until it works** (strongest)
2. **You pay as it works** (performance-based)
3. **If it doesn't work, you don't pay** (results guarantee)
4. **If it doesn't work, we'll work until it does** (weakest)

### When to Use Which

| Your Situation | Use This Risk Reversal |
|----------------|------------------------|
| Beginner, no results | Performance-based (#2) |
| Some results, building track record | Results guarantee (#3) |
| Strong track record, many case studies | Work until done (#4) or none |

### Risk Reversal Examples That Work

**For lead gen agency:**
"We'll get you X qualified calls per month or you don't pay"

**For setup offer:**
"We'll build your cold email system. If it doesn't book 10 calls in 30 days, full refund"

**For coaching:**
"We guarantee you add $10K/month in new business or you don't pay"

## Section 6: Working Examples

### Example 1: Facebook Ads (Won't Work)

```
Problem: [None specified]
Mechanism: [None]
Pricing: $3,000/month to manage ads
Risk Reversal: [None]

Result: Won't work - no problem, no mechanism
```

### Example 2: Facebook Ads (Will Work)

```
Problem: You're not getting enough calls from your ad spend
Mechanism: I'll front the cost of your Facebook advertising. 
           I'll write the copy, make the ads, use my own ad account.
Pricing: You give me 20% of closed deals
Risk Reversal: Built into pricing (performance)

Result: Will work - clear problem, skin in game
```

### Example 3: Email Copywriting (Won't Work)

```
Problem: [None - just "email copywriting"]
Mechanism: [None - just "I write emails"]
Pricing: $500/email
Risk Reversal: Money back if not satisfied

Result: Won't work - commodity service
```

### Example 4: Email Copywriting (Will Work)

```
Problem: Your email list burns leads because you only pitch
Mechanism: Therapist-style interviews → personality-based emails → 
           indistinguishable from them writing
Pricing: $3,000/month retainer
Risk Reversal: If open rates don't increase 50%, next month free

Result: Will work - specific problem, unique system
```

## Section 7: The Anti-Patterns

### Pattern 1: Starting with Skill

```
"I'm good at Facebook ads"
→ "Let me find a niche"
→ "Plumbers seem profitable"
→ "I'll offer Facebook ads to plumbers"
→ Plumbers are booked out, don't need leads
→ $0 revenue
```

**Fix:** Start with PROBLEM, then find skill that solves it.

### Pattern 2: Making Up Problems

```
"Plumbers need more leads"
→ Actually, plumbers are booked months out
→ Problem doesn't exist
→ $0 revenue
```

**Fix:** Ask actual plumbers what problems they have.

### Pattern 3: Jargon-Heavy Messaging

```
"I'll streamline your fast-paced high-growth venture 
with a proven framework to fast-track tasks..."
→ Nobody knows what this means
→ YOU don't know what this means
→ $0 revenue
```

**Fix:** Write like you're explaining to a friend.

### Pattern 4: Pricing Too Low

```
$2,000 for 60 videos + 4 YouTube edits
→ Zero margin after fulfillment
→ No cash to hire
→ Burnout
→ Business dies
```

**Fix:** Price for 60%+ margin after fulfillment costs.
