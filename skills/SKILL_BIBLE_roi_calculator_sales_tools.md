## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

ROI calculators turn abstract value propositions into concrete numbers. They help prospects see exactly what they'll get, making the buying decision logical and easy.

**Why ROI Calculators Work**:
- Makes value tangible
- Engages prospect (interactive)
- Pre-qualifies leads
- Overcomes price objection
- Self-serve sales tool

**The Calculator Equation**:
```
Calculator Effectiveness = (Relevance × Simplicity × Credibility) / Friction
```

## 2. WHAT IS AN ROI CALCULATOR?

### Definition

An interactive tool that lets prospects input their own numbers and see projected results from your service.

### Types of Sales Tools

**1. ROI Calculator**
- Input: Current metrics, investment
- Output: Projected return, payback period

**2. Savings Calculator**
- Input: Current costs
- Output: Savings with your solution

**3. Cost Comparison**
- Input: Alternatives
- Output: Your solution vs. others

**4. Potential Calculator**
- Input: Current state
- Output: What's possible

**5. Assessment/Quiz**
- Input: Answers about their situation
- Output: Score/recommendation

### Where to Use

- Landing pages
- Sales calls (screen share)
- Proposals
- Follow-up emails
- Website interactive element

## 3. ROI CALCULATOR LOGIC

### The Basic Formula

```
ROI = (Projected Results - Investment) / Investment × 100
```

### Building the Logic

**Inputs (What They Provide)**:
- Current revenue/metrics
- Current costs
- Deal size/volume
- Conversion rates

**Calculations (Behind the Scenes)**:
- Apply improvement percentages
- Calculate projected outcomes
- Determine ROI multiples

**Outputs (What They See)**:
- Projected results
- Revenue/savings gained
- ROI percentage
- Payback period

### Example: Lead Gen Calculator

**Inputs**:
- Current leads/month
- Current conversion rate
- Average deal size
- Monthly investment

**Calculations**:
- New leads = Current × improvement factor
- New revenue = New leads × conversion × deal size
- ROI = (New revenue - Investment) / Investment

**Outputs**:
- Additional leads/month
- Additional revenue/month
- Annual impact
- ROI multiple

---

## 4. DESIGNING YOUR CALCULATOR

### Simplicity First

**Rule**: 3-5 inputs maximum

Too many inputs = friction = abandonment

### Input Selection

**Ask For**:
- Metrics they likely know
- Numbers that matter to them
- Data that affects results

**Don't Ask For**:
- Complex data they'd need to look up
- Too many variables
- Irrelevant information

### Output Display

**Make It Visual**:
- Big numbers for key results
- Charts/graphs if helpful
- Before/after comparison

**Highlight**:
- ROI multiple (most compelling)
- Annual impact (big number)
- Payback period (risk reduction)

### Credibility Elements

- "Based on average client results"
- Show assumptions
- Allow adjustment of variables
- Include methodology notes

---

## 5. PROMPT ENGINEERING CALCULATORS

### Using AI to Build Calculators

AI can help create calculator logic and code.

### The Prompt Structure

**Context**:
- What service you provide
- What results you typically deliver
- What inputs are relevant

**Request**:
- Calculator logic
- Code for implementation
- Copy for interface

### Example Prompt

```
Create an ROI calculator for a cold email agency.

Inputs:
- Monthly email volume
- Current reply rate
- Average deal size
- Monthly retainer cost

Assumptions:
- We improve reply rates by 2x on average
- 20% of replies become meetings
- 30% of meetings close

Output:
- Additional meetings/month
- Additional revenue/month
- Annual ROI multiple

Provide the calculation logic and JavaScript code.
```

## 6. DEPLOYING CALCULATORS

### Build Options

**No-Code**:
- Typeform/Jotform with calculations
- Google Sheets with published form
- ConvertCalculator
- Outgrow

**Low-Code**:
- Webflow + custom code
- WordPress plugins
- Embed code solutions

**Custom**:
- JavaScript calculator
- React/Vue components
- Full custom development

### Embedding

**On Landing Page**:
- Above fold or prominent section
- After problem/solution setup
- Before CTA

**In Presentations**:
- Live during sales calls
- Screen share their results
- Email results after

### Lead Capture Integration

**Options**:
- Require email to see results
- Optional email for saved results
- No gate (use for trust building)

## 7. USING ON SALES CALLS

### The Calculator Close

**Process**:
1. Qualify on call (gather numbers)
2. "Let me show you something..."
3. Enter their numbers live
4. Walk through results
5. "Based on YOUR numbers..."

### Script

"So you mentioned you're doing [X] per month and your average deal is [Y]. Let me plug those numbers in here...

[Enter numbers]

Based on your specific situation, if we get you similar results to our average client, you'd see [result]. That's a [X]x return on your investment.

Does that kind of outcome make sense for you?"

### Follow-Up

After call:
- Email screenshot of their results
- "Here's what we discussed"
- Reminds them of the value

---

## 8. CALCULATOR BEST PRACTICES

### Do's

- Keep inputs simple (3-5 max)
- Use realistic improvement assumptions
- Show methodology/assumptions
- Make results shareable
- Mobile optimize
- Fast load time

### Don'ts

- Over-promise results
- Hide assumptions
- Make it too complex
- Require too much info
- Forget mobile users

### Updating

- Review assumptions quarterly
- Update based on actual results
- A/B test different presentations

---
