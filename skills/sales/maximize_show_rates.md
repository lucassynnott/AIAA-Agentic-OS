# Maximize Show Rates

## Purpose
Implement proven copywriting strategies and psychological triggers throughout the booking-to-call journey to achieve 70%+ show rates.

## When to Use
- Calendar show rates below 60%
- Setting up new booking funnel
- Improving existing confirmation sequences
- Testing new reminder messaging
- Scaling calendar operations

## Core Philosophy

**Show rates are won or lost between booking and call time.**

Most businesses focus on getting the booking. Elite operators focus on what happens AFTER the booking.

Your job: Increase commitment, build urgency, and make showing up the path of least resistance.

## The Show Rate Formula

```
Show Rate = (Commitment + Urgency + Clarity) - (Friction + Time Decay)
```

**Commitment:** How invested they feel
**Urgency:** Cost of not showing up
**Clarity:** How easy it is to show up
**Friction:** Obstacles to showing up
**Time Decay:** Enthusiasm fading over time

Maximize the first three, minimize the last two.

## Target Show Rates by Funnel

```
Cold Traffic (Ads → Booking): 50-60%
Warm Traffic (Webinar → Booking): 60-75%
Hot Traffic (Application → Booking): 75-85%
Referral Traffic: 80-90%
```

If you're below these benchmarks, your confirmation and reminder sequences need work.

## The Complete Show Rate System

### Component 1: Confirmation Page Copy

The confirmation page is your FIRST opportunity to increase commitment.

#### Standard (Weak) Confirmation Page:

```
❌ "Thanks for booking! Check your email for details."
```

This does nothing to increase commitment or urgency.

#### High-Converting Confirmation Page:

```
✅ Headline: "You're Confirmed! 🎉"

Subheadline: "Your [Call Type] with [Your Name] is scheduled for:"

[Large, Bold Date & Time Display]

[Add to Calendar Button]

1️⃣ Check Your Email
You'll receive a calendar invite + call link in the next 60 seconds.
(Check spam if you don't see it)

2️⃣ Get Reminder Notifications

- Friendly tone
- Emoji (1-2 max)

#### SMS 2: 24 Hours Before

```
"Hey [First Name] - we're on tomorrow at [Time].

Come prepared with questions.

See you tomorrow! 💪

```

**Key Elements:**

- Simple (just link)

---

### Component 5: Urgency Building Copy

Sprinkle these psychological triggers throughout:

#### Scarcity:

```
"I only take [X] calls per week - glad you got a spot."

"This time slot was the last one available this week."

"If you need to reschedule, do it soon - my calendar fills up fast."
```

#### Opportunity Cost:

```
"Every day you wait to solve [problem] costs you $[X]."

"You've been dealing with this for [timeline]. Let's fix it."

"The sooner we talk, the sooner you can [desired outcome]."
```

#### Social Proof:

```
"I just helped [Similar Client] go from [A] to [B] - excited to do the same for you."

"Last week alone I had [X] calls with [industry] businesses."

"[X]% of people who take this call end up working with us."
```

#### Preparation:

```
"I'm already prepping for our call based on your answers."

"I've been thinking about your challenge - I have some ideas."

"I'm setting aside the full [30] minutes to focus on YOUR situation."
```

This builds reciprocity - they feel obligated to show up because you're investing time.

---

### Component 6: Social Commitment

Make them publicly commit (to themselves):

#### In Confirmation Email:

```
"Quick Question: Are you committed to showing up on [Day]?

Reply YES if you're serious about solving [problem].

(If not, no hard feelings - just reschedule so someone else can take the spot.)"
```

When they reply "YES," they've publicly committed. Harder to no-show.

#### In Questionnaire:

```
"On a scale of 1-10, how committed are you to solving [problem]?

1 = Just browsing
10 = I need this solved ASAP

[1-10 scale]

If you selected below 7, why did you book this call?"
```

This forces self-reflection. Low scorers often self-disqualify (good - saves your time).

---

### Component 7: Friction Removal

Make showing up EASY:

#### Clear Links Everywhere:

```
✅ In every email
✅ In every text
✅ In calendar invite
✅ On confirmation page
✅ Use short, branded links
```

#### Calendar Sync:

```
Attach .ics file to confirmation email
Sync with Google Calendar / Office 365 / Outlook
Automatic timezone detection
```

#### Mobile Optimization:

```
Ensure calendar links work on mobile
Test on iOS and Android
One-tap to join from SMS
```

#### Backup Plans:

```
"Can't find the Zoom link? Call/text me: [Your Number]"

"Having tech issues? We can do phone call instead: [Number]"
```

## Advanced Show Rate Strategies

### Strategy 1: The Deposit

For very high-ticket or to filter serious buyers:

```
"To secure your spot, there's a $[X] refundable deposit.

This ensures you're serious (and so am I).

If you show up, you get it back.
If you don't show, it's forfeited."
```

Show rates with deposits: 95%+

### Strategy 2: The Penalty

Less aggressive than deposit:

```
"If you can't make it, please reschedule at least 24 hours in advance.

No-shows without notice will not be rescheduled."
```

Creates accountability without money.

### Strategy 3: The Voice Note

1-2 days before call, send personal voice note (Loom, voice text):

```
"Hey [First Name], [Your Name] here.

Quick voice note before our [Day] call.

I've been looking at your info and I'm excited to help you with [problem].

Come with questions. This is going to be valuable.

See you [Day]!

[Your Name]"
```

Highly personal. Massively increases show rates.

### Strategy 4: The Calendar Screenshot

In 24hr reminder:

```
[Screenshot of your calendar with their slot highlighted]

"Hey [First Name], here's what my [Day] looks like.

I've blocked [Time] specifically for YOU.

Don't leave me hanging 😅

See you tomorrow!

- [Your Name]"
```

Shows investment. Builds reciprocity.

### Strategy 5: The Question Prompt

In 24hr reminder:

```
"Hey [First Name],

Before our call tomorrow, think about this:

If you could wave a magic wand and fix ONE thing in your business, what would it be?

Come ready to discuss.

- [Your Name]"
```

Gets them thinking. Increases mental investment.
