# Build Sales Script

## Purpose
Create complete, word-for-word sales call scripts that guide you from greeting to close with confidence and consistency.

## When to Use
- Preparing for sales calls
- Training new team members on sales
- Creating SOPs for sales process
- Testing new messaging or positioning
- Scaling sales operations
- Analyzing and improving call performance

## Core Philosophy

**Scripts aren't crutches - they're frameworks for excellence.**

The best closers internalize scripts so well they sound natural. Scripts give you:
- Confidence (know what to say next)
- Consistency (proven phrases that work)
- Recovery paths (when things go sideways)
- Training tools (scale your sales)

**Don't read scripts robotically. Use them as GPS, not handcuffs.**

## Persuasion Principles Embedded in This Script

### 1. Psychological Ventriloquism
Make prospects feel they're arriving at conclusions themselves. Use questions that guide them to realize urgency on their own.
- **Bad**: "You need this solution now"
- **Good**: "What happens if this doesn't get solved in the next 90 days?" [They tell you the urgency]

### 2. Small-Steps Technique (Commitment & Consistency)
Get small initial "yeses" throughout the call that build to the final decision:
- "Fair?" → Yes
- "Make sense?" → Yes
- "Is that accurate?" → Yes
- "Sound good?" → Yes
- Each micro-commitment makes the final "yes" easier

### 3. The "Because" Trigger Word
Use "because" statements throughout to activate automatic compliance:
- "We do it this way because..."
- "This works because..."
- "I'm asking this because..."

### 4. Authenticity Over Tactics (Ulterior Motives Principle)
If they sense manipulation, all other tactics fail. Be genuine in wanting to help them decide if this is right for them, not just "close at all costs."

### Phase 1: Opening & Rapport (2-3 minutes)

**The Greeting:**

```
[They join the call]

YOU: "Hey [Name]! Good to see you. How are you doing today?"

THEM: [Response]

YOU: "Awesome. Before we dive in, give me 30 seconds - I just want to make sure [close other tabs, pull up notes, etc.]. How's the audio on your end?"

THEM: "Good" / "Fine"

YOU: "Perfect, same here."
```

**Set the Frame:**

```
YOU: "Okay, so I've got us for about [30/45] minutes.

Here's typically how I run these calls:

I'm going to ask you some questions about where you are now and where you want to be. Then if it makes sense, I'll show you how we help people in your situation get there.

And by the end, we'll both know if this is a fit or not. Fair?"

THEM: "Sounds good" / "Sure"

YOU: "Cool."
```

**Build Rapport:**

```
YOU: "So before we get into business stuff - tell me a bit about yourself. How'd you get into [their industry/business]?"

THEM: [Tells their story]

YOU: [Active listening, find commonalities, be genuinely interested]

"That's awesome. So what made you want to hop on this call today? What's going on?"

THEM: [Gives surface-level reason]

YOU: "Got it. Okay, let's dig into that..."
```

---

### Phase 2: Current State Discovery (5-7 minutes)

**Business Overview:**

```
YOU: "So first, just help me understand where you're at right now.

Walk me through your business - what do you do, who do you serve?"

THEM: [Explains]

YOU: "Cool. And what's your revenue right now, monthly?"

THEM: $[X]

YOU: "Okay, $[X]/month. And where do you want that to be?"

THEM: $[Y]

YOU: [Write this down]

"So you're at [X], want to be at [Y]. That's a $[gap] per month difference. Got it."
```

**Current Client Acquisition:**

```
YOU: "How are you getting clients right now?"

THEM: [Describes current methods]

YOU: "And how's that working? Like, how many leads are you getting per month?"

THEM: [Number]

YOU: "And what's your close rate on those?"

THEM: [Percentage or conversion]

YOU: "Okay, so [calculate] clients per month from that. Is that enough?"

THEM: "No" / "Not really"

YOU: "Yeah, makes sense. What have you tried to fix that?"

THEM: [Lists previous attempts]

YOU: "And what happened with [specific attempt]?"

THEM: [Explains failure]

YOU: "Interesting. Why do you think that didn't work?"

THEM: [Their theory]

YOU: [Take notes]
```

**Team & Operations:**

```
YOU: "Is it just you or do you have a team?"

THEM: [Describes team]

YOU: "Got it. And what do you spend most of YOUR time on?"

THEM: [Lists activities]

YOU: "Where do you feel most bottlenecked right now?"

THEM: [Identifies bottleneck]

YOU: "How long has that been an issue?"

THEM: [Timeline]

YOU: [Note the timeline - important for cost calculation]
```

---

### Phase 3: Pain Point Excavation (8-10 minutes)

**Apply Psychological Ventriloquism**: Make them convince themselves of the urgency, don't tell them.

**Quantify the Problem:**

```
YOU: "Okay, so let me make sure I understand.

You're at $[current]/month, but you want to be at $[goal]/month.

That's a $[gap]/month gap.

And you've been stuck at this level for [timeline they mentioned]?

THEM: "Yeah, about [X] months/years"

YOU: "Okay, so just doing quick math - that's [gap × months] you've essentially left on the table while being stuck here.

Is that fair to say?" [Ventriloquism: They arrive at the conclusion]

THEM: [Usually surprised by the number] "Yeah, I guess so"

YOU: "And if nothing changes in the next 90 days, you'll lose another $[gap × 3], right?" [They do the math themselves]

THEM: "Right..."

YOU: "So this isn't a small problem. This is a $[big number] problem." [Confirm what THEY concluded]

THEM: [Agreement]
```

**Build Emotional Urgency:**

```
YOU: "Let me ask you this:

On a scale of 1-10, how urgent is fixing this for you?"

THEM: [Number, usually 7-9]

YOU: "Why [their number] and not higher?"

THEM: [Reveals what's holding them back]

YOU: "Got it. And what happens if this doesn't get solved in the next 90 days?"

THEM: [Describes consequences]

YOU: "What does that mean for you personally? Not just the business, but YOU?"

THEM: [Emotional response - stress, money, time, family impact]

YOU: [Let them sit with that for a second]

"Yeah, I can hear that this is really weighing on you."

THEM: [Agreement]
```

**Previous Attempts Deep Dive:**

```
YOU: "So you mentioned you tried [previous solution].

Walk me through that - what specifically didn't work?"

THEM: [Explains]

YOU: "And how much did you invest in that?"

THEM: $[X] and/or [time]

YOU: "Damn. So you're $[X] in and still dealing with the same problem.

What do you think was the issue - wrong approach or wrong execution?"

THEM: [Their analysis]

YOU: "Makes sense. What would need to be different this time for you to feel confident it would work?"

THEM: [Reveals buying criteria]

YOU: [Take detailed notes - this is your closing script]
```

---

### Phase 4: Future State Vision (3-5 minutes)

**Paint the Picture:**

```
YOU: "Okay, so let's talk about the flip side.

If we solve [problem], what does your business look like in 6 months?"

THEM: [Describes future state]

YOU: "So you'd be at $[goal]/month, [other outcomes]?

What becomes possible at that level that isn't possible now?"

THEM: [Lists opportunities]

YOU: "And what does that mean for you personally?

Like, how does that change your day-to-day?"

THEM: [Describes lifestyle impact]

YOU: "How would that feel?"

THEM: [Emotional response]

YOU: "What's the first thing you'd do when you hit that number?"

THEM: [Specific goal]

YOU: "That's awesome. So getting from [current] to [goal] is really about [summarize their emotional drivers]."

THEM: "Exactly"
```

---

### Phase 5: Obstacles & Objections (3-5 minutes)

**Surface Objections Early:**

```
YOU: "So let me ask you:

What's held you back from solving this before now?"

THEM: [Lists obstacles]

YOU: "Got it. And what are you most concerned about when it comes to [your solution type]?"

THEM: [Reveals fears]

YOU: "That makes sense. A lot of people feel that way initially.

What would need to be true for you to move forward with something like this?"

THEM: [Gives buying criteria]

YOU: "And have you looked at other solutions for this?"

THEM: [Yes/No and details]

YOU: "What did you think about [competitive approach]?"

THEM: [Opinion]

YOU: [Note all of this - you'll address it in the pitch]
```

---

### Phase 6: Permission to Present (1-2 minutes)

**Summarize & Get Buy-In:**

```
YOU: "Okay, so let me just recap to make sure I've got this right.

You're currently at $[current]/month, want to be at $[goal]/month.

That's a $[gap]/month gap.

You've been stuck here for [timeline], which has cost you about $[total cost so far].

You've tried [previous attempts] but they didn't work because [reasons].

The main things holding you back are [obstacles they mentioned].

And if we could solve this, you'd [desired outcome] which would mean [emotional driver].

Did I get all that right?"

THEM: "Yeah, that's accurate"

YOU: "Okay, cool.

So based on everything you've told me, I think we can definitely help.

If I could show you how we've helped people in your exact situation go from [current] to [goal], would that be valuable to hear?"

THEM: "Yeah, definitely"

YOU: "Cool, let me walk you through it."
```

---

### Phase 7: The Pitch (5-7 minutes)

**Introduce the Solution:**

```
YOU: "So here's what we do.

We specialize in [specific outcome] for [specific audience].

The way we do it is different from [what they've tried before].

Instead of [old way], we [your unique mechanism].

Here's how it works:

[Explain your process in 3-4 simple steps]

Step 1: [First thing]
Step 2: [Next thing]
Step 3: [Final thing]

And the result is [specific outcome].

Make sense so far?"

THEM: "Yeah" / [Questions]

[Answer questions, then continue]
```

**Address Their Specific Situation:**

```
YOU: "Now, for you specifically:

You mentioned [their problem]. This solves that by [specific solution].

You were concerned about [their fear]. Here's how we handle that: [address it].

And you said what you really want is [their desired outcome]. This gets you there by [explain path].

Does that align with what you need?"

THEM: [Response]
```

**Social Proof:**

```
YOU: "Let me give you an example.

We worked with [Similar Client] who was in almost your exact situation.

They were at $[similar revenue], struggling with [similar problem].

Within [timeframe], we helped them [specific result].

They're now at $[new revenue] and [additional benefits].

The main thing that changed was [key differentiator].

[Show testimonial, case study, or screenshot if you have it]

And that's just one example. We've helped [X] clients in [their industry/situation] with this."
```

---

### Phase 8: The Investment & ROI Close (5-7 minutes)

**Present the Investment:**

```
YOU: "Okay, so let's talk about the investment.

Our [package name] is $[price].

That includes:
- [Deliverable 1]
- [Deliverable 2]
- [Deliverable 3]

Timeline is [X weeks/months].

Now, I know that might sound like a lot. So let me show you the math."
```

**ROI Breakdown:**

```
YOU: "Right now, you're losing $[gap]/month by being stuck.

Over the next 90 days, if nothing changes, that's $[gap × 3] lost.

Our investment is $[price].

So you're either going to invest $[gap × 3] in staying stuck, or $[price] in solving it.

That's a $[difference] difference just in the first 90 days.

Over a year?

Cost of doing nothing: $[gap × 12]
Cost of working with us: $[price]

That's a $[gap × 12 - price] net gain in Year 1.

And that's not even counting the upside - the NEW revenue you'll generate once we solve this.

This literally pays for itself in [payback period] months.

After that, it's pure profit.

Does that math make sense?"

THEM: [Response]
```

---

### Phase 9: Handle Objections (Varies)

**The Price Objection:**

```
THEM: "It's expensive" / "I can't afford it"

YOU: "I get it. Can I ask - expensive compared to what?

Because we just calculated that this problem is costing you $[gap]/month.

So the real question isn't whether you can afford to do this.

It's whether you can afford NOT to do this.

You're already paying $[gap]/month for this problem.

Our investment is less than [calculate] months of what you're currently losing.

Does that make sense?"
```

**The "I Need to Think About It" Objection:**

```
THEM: "I need to think about it"

YOU: "Totally fair. What specifically do you need to think about?"

THEM: [Reveals real concern]

YOU: "Okay, so it's really about [their concern].

Let me address that: [Handle the specific objection]

Because here's my concern: You've been thinking about this problem for [timeline from discovery].

And thinking about it hasn't solved it.

At some point, thinking becomes procrastination.

The information you need to make a good decision is right here on this call.

So what questions can I answer that would help you feel confident moving forward today?"
```

Once you sign, we're off to the races."

[If HESITANT:]

THEM: [Reveals concern]

YOU: [Address concern, then re-ask]

"Does that help? Should we move forward?"
```

**Confirm Next Steps:**

```
YOU: "Okay, so you're going to [specific action].

I'll [your specific action].

And then we'll [next step].

Can you do [their action] by [specific time]?"

THEM: [Commitment]

YOU: "Perfect. I'll follow up if I don't see it by then.

Anything else you need from me right now?"

THEM: [Questions or no]

YOU: "Awesome. Welcome aboard. This is going to be great."
```

You're going to [their action] by [time].
I'm going to [your action] by [time].
We kick off on [date].
