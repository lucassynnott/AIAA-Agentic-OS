# Perfect Flow Recovery

## Purpose
Recover control and momentum when a sales call goes sideways, gets derailed, or loses energy.

## When to Use
- Call goes off-track into tangents
- Prospect becomes argumentative or defensive
- You skip critical discovery steps
- Energy drops or awkward silence occurs
- Technical issues interrupt flow
- Prospect tries to control the conversation
- You lose frame or confidence
- Call is running over time

## Core Philosophy

**Every call will have moments of chaos. Master closers know how to recover.**

Most sales are lost not because of bad discovery or weak closes, but because the seller couldn't recover when things went sideways.

Your job: Stay calm, reframe, and redirect back to the path.

## The Universal Recovery Framework

### 1. Pause & Acknowledge
Don't ignore the derailment. Address it briefly.

### 2. Pattern Interrupt
Break the negative momentum.

### 3. Reframe & Redirect
Get back on track without making it awkward.

### 4. Resume Normal Flow
Continue as if nothing happened.

## Scenario-Based Recovery Scripts

### Scenario 1: The Rambling Prospect

**Problem:** Prospect talks forever about irrelevant topics, stories, or details.

**Recovery Script:**

```
[Let them finish their sentence, then:]

"That's really interesting. I want to make sure we cover everything important in our time today.

Can I ask you a few specific questions about [problem] so I can understand how to best help you?

First question: [Back to discovery]"
```

**Key Moves:**
- Don't interrupt mid-sentence (rude)
- Acknowledge what they said (validation)
- Reframe to "our time" (shared resource)
- Take control with permission ("Can I ask...")
- Jump straight to a question (regain control)

**Alternative Approach:**

```
"I love that story. And I want to make sure we have time to actually solve [problem] for you.

Let me ask you this: [Discovery question]"
```

### Scenario 2: The Argumentative Prospect

**Problem:** Prospect challenges you, disagrees, or becomes combative.

**Recovery Script:**

```
"You know what? You might be right.

I'm not here to convince you of anything. I'm here to understand if we can help.

So let me ask you: What would need to be true for you to feel like this could work?

[Listen to their answer]

Okay, so if we could [address their concern], then you'd be open to this?

[Get confirmation, then address it]"
```

**Key Moves:**
- Agree with them (diffuses tension)
- Reframe your role (helper, not salesperson)
- Make them articulate what they need (reveals real objection)
- Get buy-in before solving (commitment)

**Alternative - The Takeaway:**

```
"You know what? I'm sensing some resistance here.

And that's totally fine. This isn't for everyone.

Maybe we should just end the call and you can reach out if you change your mind?"

[They usually backtrack and re-engage]
```

### Scenario 3: You Skipped Discovery and Jumped to Pitch

**Problem:** You pitched too early and now they're not bought in.

**Recovery Script:**

```
"You know what? I'm getting ahead of myself.

Before I go any further, let me actually understand your situation better.

Tell me: What made you book this call in the first place?

[Go back to discovery phase]"
```

**Key Moves:**
- Own the mistake (builds credibility)
- Rewind the conversation
- Start discovery from scratch
- Rebuild foundation before pitching again

**Alternative:**

```
"Hold on. I'm explaining the solution before I even know if you need it.

Let me back up. Where are you at right now with [problem]?

[Restart discovery]"
```

### Scenario 4: Awkward Silence / Energy Drop

**Problem:** Conversation loses momentum, uncomfortable silence, or flat energy.

**Recovery Script:**

```
"Let me ask you something:

On a scale of 1-10, how important is solving [problem] for you right now?

[They answer]

Okay, and what would make this a 10?

[Re-engage with urgency building]"
```

**Key Moves:**
- Break silence with direct question
- Use scale (forces engagement)
- Rebuild urgency
- Re-energize the conversation

**Alternative - Pattern Interrupt:**

```
"Can I be honest with you for a second?

I'm sensing we might have lost the thread here.

Let's reset. What's the ONE thing you want to walk away from this call with?

[Refocus on their desired outcome]"
```

### Scenario 5: Prospect Takes Control / Asks All the Questions

**Problem:** They flip the script and start interviewing YOU.

**Recovery Script:**

```
"Great questions. And I want to answer all of them.

But before I do, can I ask: What's driving these questions? What are you most concerned about?

[Identify underlying fear]

Because once I understand that, I can answer your questions in a way that actually addresses what you care about.

So what's the real concern here?"
```

**Key Moves:**
- Don't just answer questions blindly
- Get underneath the questions (find the fear)
- Reframe as helping them, not defending yourself
- Take control back by asking meta-questions

**Alternative - The Reverse:**

```
"I'll answer all of those. But first, help me understand:

Are these questions coming from a place of 'I'm interested but need clarity' or 'I'm skeptical and looking for reasons to say no'?

Just want to make sure I answer them the right way."

[Forces them to reveal their position]
```

### Scenario 6: Technical Issues Interrupt Flow

**Problem:** Zoom glitches, audio cuts, screen share fails, etc.

**Recovery Script:**

```
"Okay, we're back. Sorry about that.

So just to recap where we were:

You're dealing with [problem], it's costing you $[X]/month, and you want to [goal].

Did I get that right?

[Quick summary to reorient]

Okay, so my next question was: [Continue where you left off]"
```

**Key Moves:**
- Don't dwell on the technical issue
- Quickly recap where you were (reorients everyone)
- Confirm understanding
- Jump back in smoothly

**Alternative:**

```
"Alright, connection's back. Good thing we didn't lose too much time.

Let me ask you this: [Jump to your most important next question]"
```

### Scenario 7: You Lose Frame / Get Nervous

**Problem:** You feel yourself getting flustered, losing confidence, or off your game.

**Internal Recovery Process:**

1. **Pause and breathe** (seriously, take 2 seconds)
2. **Remember your value** (they need you more than you need them)
3. **Ask a question** (gets attention off you)
4. **Reset your energy** (sit up, speak slower)

**Recovery Script:**

```
[Pause]

"Let me ask you something important:

If we could solve [problem] in the next 90 days, what would that mean for you?

[Listen, let them talk, regain composure]"
```

**Key Moves:**
- Buy time with a good question
- Let them talk while you reset
- Refocus on THEIR outcome (takes pressure off you)
- Speak slower and more deliberately

### Scenario 8: Call Is Running Over Time

**Problem:** You're past scheduled time and haven't closed yet.

**Recovery Script:**

```
"Hey, I know we're a few minutes over. I want to respect your time.

We have two options:

1. We can schedule another call to finish this conversation
2. Or we can take 5 more minutes and I'll show you exactly how we can solve [problem]

Which makes more sense?"

[If they choose option 2:]

"Perfect. So here's what I'm proposing: [Pitch concisely]"
```

**Key Moves:**
- Acknowledge the time (shows respect)
- Give them options (regains control)
- If they stay, make the pitch COUNT
- Be concise and direct

**Alternative - The Time Pressure Close:**

```
"I know we're running over. Let me just cut to the chase:

Based on everything you've told me, here's what I think we should do:

[Fast pitch]

Does that make sense? Should we move forward?"
```

### Scenario 9: Prospect Says "Just Send Me Info"

**Problem:** They're trying to end the call without committing.

**Recovery Script:**

```
"I can definitely send you info. But let me ask you:

What specifically do you want to know that we haven't covered?

[They reveal actual concern]

Okay, so it's really about [concern]. Let me address that right now.

[Handle the objection]

Because if I just send you info, you'll read it with that concern still in your head and it won't answer your question.

Does that make sense?

So let's just handle it now: [Address concern]"
```

**Key Moves:**
- Don't just agree to send info (closes the door)
- Surface the REAL reason they're asking
- Address it immediately
- Make sending info unnecessary

**Alternative - The Honest Approach:**

```
"I can send you stuff. But real talk:

When people ask for info, they usually just never look at it and the deal dies.

So let me ask: Is this actually interesting to you? Or are you trying to politely end the call?

No judgment either way. I just want to know where we stand."

[Forces honesty, often resets the conversation]
```

### Scenario 10: Prospect Needs to Leave Early

**Problem:** Emergency, calendar conflict, or they just check out.

**Recovery Script:**

```
"No problem. Before you go, let me ask you one quick question:

Based on what we've discussed so far, is this something you actually want to solve?

[They answer]

Okay, great. So let's find 15 minutes in the next day or two to finish this conversation.

When works better for you - [tomorrow morning] or [tomorrow afternoon]?

[Schedule specific time immediately]"
```

**Key Moves:**
- Don't let them leave without commitment
- Confirm interest before they go
- Book next call IMMEDIATELY (don't "follow up later")
- Give binary choice of times (not open-ended)

## Advanced Recovery Techniques

### The "Honest Reset"

When things are just NOT working:

```
"Can I be really honest with you?

I don't think this conversation is going how either of us wanted.

So let's just reset. No sales pitch, no pressure.

Tell me: What do you actually need to know to decide if this is right for you?"

[Listen, then address specifically]
```

### The "Pattern Interrupt" Technique

Break negative momentum with unexpected move:

```
"You know what? I'm going to stop talking.

Your turn. What questions do you have?

[Let them drive for 60 seconds, then take control back]"
```

### The "Future Pace" Recovery

When stuck, jump to the end:

```
"Let's say we're 6 months from now and this was the best decision you made.

What happened? What changed?

[They paint future state]

Okay, so THAT'S what we're really talking about here. Not [current topic], but [future outcome].

So let's talk about how we get you there: [Redirect to pitch]"
```

### The "Takeaway" Recovery

When losing them, pull back:

```
"You know what? I don't think this is right for you.

Here's why: This only works for people who [ideal client description].

And based on our conversation, I'm not sure that's you.

Am I wrong?"

[They often convince YOU it's right for them]
```

## Call Flow Recovery Map

If you lose track of where you are in the call:

```
✓ Rapport Built → If not: "Tell me about yourself"
✓ Pain Identified → If not: "What's the biggest challenge?"
✓ Cost Calculated → If not: "What's this costing you per month?"
✓ Urgency Built → If not: "How long has this been an issue?"
✓ Future Painted → If not: "Where do you want to be in 6 months?"
✓ Obstacles Surfaced → If not: "What's stopped you from solving this?"
✓ Pitched → If not: Present solution
✓ Closed → If not: Ask for the sale
```

Use this to quickly identify what step you skipped.

## Energy Recovery Techniques

### For Low Energy Call:

```
"Let me ask you this - and be honest:

Is this actually a priority right now? Or are we just going through the motions?

Because if it's not a priority, let's not waste time. But if it IS, then let's get serious about solving it.

Which is it?"

[Resets energy by forcing honesty]
```

### For Combative Call:

```
"I feel like we're not connecting here.

And that's okay - this isn't for everyone.

But before we end this, I want to make sure I didn't miss something.

What would you need to see/hear/know to feel like this could work?

[Last chance to save it]"
```

### For Confused Call:

```
"I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me simplify:

You have [problem].
It's costing you $[X]/month.
We can fix it for $[Y].

The question is just: Do you want to fix it or not?

Everything else is just details."

[Cuts through confusion]
```

## Prevention is Better Than Recovery

### Set Strong Frame Early

At start of call:

```
"Hey [Name], great to meet you. I've got us for [X] minutes.

Here's how I typically run these:

I'll ask you some questions about where you are and where you want to be. Then if it makes sense, I'll show you how we can help.

And by the end, we'll both know if this is a fit or not.

Sound good?"

[Sets expectation that YOU'RE leading]
```

### Use "Can I Ask You..." Language

Always ask permission before redirecting:

```
"Can I ask you about [topic]?"
"Can I jump in for a second?"
"Can I share something with you?"
```

Makes redirects feel collaborative, not controlling.

### Acknowledge Before Redirecting

```
"That makes total sense. And before we go further down that path, I want to make sure I understand [X]. Can I ask you about that?"
```

Validates them before redirecting.

## Recovery Scripts by Call Phase

### During Rapport Building:

```
"I love learning about your story, and I want to make sure we solve your problem too.

Let me ask you: [First discovery question]"
```

### During Discovery:

```
"This is all super helpful. I'm getting a clear picture.

Let me dig into [specific area]: [Next question]"
```

### During Pitch:

```
"I want to make sure this is making sense.

Does [what you just explained] align with what you need?"

[Checkpoint, then continue or adjust]
```

### During Close:

```
"Let me make sure we're on the same page.

You want [outcome], this solves [problem], and the investment is $[X].

What questions do you have?"

[Address any concerns, then ask for sale]
```

## The Nuclear Option: Starting Over

If call is completely unsalvageable:

```
"You know what? I don't think we're using this time well.

Let me start over.

What's the ONE problem you want to solve?

[Listen]

Okay. And why does that matter to you?

[Listen]

Got it. So if I could solve [problem] in [timeframe], would that be valuable?

[If yes: Proceed with tight pitch]
[If no: End call gracefully]"
```

## Post-Recovery Mindset

After recovering a derailed call:

1. **Don't apologize excessively** (shows weakness)
2. **Act like it never happened** (move forward confidently)
3. **Stay detached from outcome** (recovery works better when not desperate)
4. **Trust your framework** (it works if you follow it)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ Ignoring the derailment (makes it worse)
❌ Apologizing repeatedly (kills frame)
❌ Getting defensive or argumentative
❌ Letting them stay in control
❌ Skipping recovery and pushing forward
❌ Showing frustration or annoyance
❌ Over-explaining why you're redirecting
❌ Not using pattern interrupts

## Recovery Success Checklist

When call goes sideways:
- [ ] Pause and acknowledge the issue
- [ ] Stay calm and detached
- [ ] Use pattern interrupt if needed
- [ ] Ask permission to redirect
- [ ] Jump to powerful question
- [ ] Rebuild momentum quickly
- [ ] Resume normal flow
- [ ] Don't dwell on what happened

## The Golden Rule

**The prospect doesn't know the call went sideways unless YOU make it obvious.**

Recover confidently and they'll assume it was always part of the plan.
