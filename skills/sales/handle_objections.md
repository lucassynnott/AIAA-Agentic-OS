# Handle Objections

## Purpose
Master the art of handling every sales objection with proven frameworks that move prospects from resistance to commitment.

## When to Use
- During discovery calls when objections surface
- At closing stage when prospect hesitates
- In follow-up conversations when concerns arise
- Pre-emptively during pitch to address common blockers

## Core Philosophy

**Objections = The Start of the Sale, Not the End**

Most sales happen AFTER the first objection. Objections are not rejection - they're the prospect's way of protecting their comfort zone while considering transformation.

**Your Job:** Help them work through resistance, not overcome you.

**Not Your Job:** Argue, pressure, or manipulate.

### The Ulterior Motives Principle
**Critical**: Authenticity is the foundation of all persuasion. If prospects sense your intent is manipulative rather than genuinely helpful, every technique below will backfire. Your goal is to help them make the RIGHT decision for THEM, not just close the deal.

## The Universal Objection Handling Framework

### Step 1: Acknowledge & Validate
Never dismiss or minimize their concern. Make them feel heard.

```
"I totally understand that concern. A lot of our best clients felt the same way initially."
```

### Step 2: Clarify
Make sure you understand the real objection, not just the surface one.

```
"Help me understand - when you say [their objection], what specifically concerns you about that?"
```

### Step 3: Isolate
Confirm this is the only thing holding them back.

```
"So if we could figure out [objection], is there anything else that would stop you from moving forward?"
```

### Step 4: Reframe & Resolve
Address the core concern with logic and emotion. **Use "because" statements** to activate compliance.

```
"This works because..." [Insert reason]
"We do it this way because..." [Insert reason]
```

### Step 5: Trial Close
Test if you've resolved it.

```
"Does that make sense? Do you feel better about [objection]?"
```

**Note**: Throughout this framework, use psychological ventriloquism - guide them to conclusions rather than telling them.

## Complete Objection Playbook

### Objection 1: "It's Too Expensive" / "I Can't Afford It"

**Surface Objection:** Price
**Real Objection:** Don't see the value or haven't calculated cost of inaction

**Response Framework:**

```
"I get it - nobody wants to overspend. Can I ask you something?

When you say it's expensive, expensive compared to what?

[Let them respond]

Because here's what I'm thinking - we calculated earlier that this problem is costing you $[X] per month, right?

[Reference their own numbers from discovery]

So in the next 90 days alone, you'll lose $[X × 3] if nothing changes.

Our investment is $[Y]. Which means if we can solve this in the next 90 days, you're actually saving $[difference] just in the first quarter.

And that's not even counting the upside - the new revenue you'll generate once this is fixed.

So the real question isn't whether you can afford to do this. It's whether you can afford NOT to do this.

Does that make sense?"
```

**Key Moves:**
- Redirect to cost of inaction (already calculated in discovery)
- Use their own numbers against the objection
- Frame investment as saving money, not spending it
- Reframe from "expense" to "opportunity cost"

**Alternative Angle - The Time Value:**

```
"I hear you. Let me ask - how long have you been dealing with this problem?

[They answer: 6 months, a year, etc.]

And in that time, how much has it cost you?

[Reference the monthly cost × months]

So you've already spent $[total cost] on NOT solving this.

The question is: how much more are you willing to spend by waiting?"
```

### Objection 2: "I Need to Think About It"

**Surface Objection:** Need time
**Real Objection:** Unclear on decision, have doubts, avoiding discomfort

**Response Framework:**

```
"Totally fair - this is a big decision. I respect that.

Can I ask - what specifically do you need to think about?

[Let them talk - this reveals the REAL objection]

[Address the real objection directly]

Because here's my concern: you've been thinking about this problem for [timeframe they mentioned in discovery], right?

And we both know that thinking about it hasn't solved it. At some point, thinking becomes procrastination.

I'm not saying you need to decide right this second. But I am saying that the information you need to make a good decision is right here on this call.

So what questions can I answer that would help you feel confident moving forward today?"
```

**Key Moves:**
- Make them articulate what they need to think about (surfaces real objection)
- Point out they've been "thinking" for months already
- Reframe "thinking" as procrastination
- Redirect to answering questions NOW

**Alternative Angle - The Decision Framework:**

```
"I appreciate that. Let me help you think through it.

Typically when someone says they need to think about it, it's one of three things:
1. They're not sure it will work for them
2. They're not sure about the investment
3. There's someone else involved in the decision

Which one is it for you?"

[They reveal the real objection - handle it specifically]
```

### Objection 3: "I Don't Have Time Right Now"

**Surface Objection:** Bandwidth
**Real Objection:** Don't see urgency, prioritization issue, fear of commitment

**Response Framework:**

```
"I totally get it - you're busy. That's actually exactly why we need to solve this.

Let me ask you something: how much time are you currently spending on [the problem] every week?

[They answer]

And how's that working out?

[Usually: "Not great"]

So you're spending [X hours] per week on this problem, and it's STILL not solved. Which means in a month, that's [X × 4] hours. In a year, that's [X × 52] hours.

That's [convert to weeks/months] of your life spent on a problem that won't go away on its own.

The whole point of our system is to GIVE you time back. You'll spend a few hours upfront to save [calculate] hours per month going forward.

So the real question is: do you have time to keep doing what you're doing?

Or would you rather invest a few hours now to fix this permanently?"
```

**Key Moves:**
- Quantify time they're ALREADY spending on the problem
- Show the time investment of doing nothing
- Position your solution as time-SAVING, not time-CONSUMING
- Reframe to: "You don't have time NOT to do this"

**Alternative Angle - The Implementation Support:**

```
"I understand. And honestly, if this required a ton of your time, I'd tell you to wait.

But that's exactly why we built it the way we did. The heavy lifting is on us.

You're basically investing [specific small time commitment] to get [specific result].

And every day you wait, you're spending [time currently wasted on problem].

So which sounds better: [small implementation time] now, or [wasted time] forever?"
```

### Objection 4: "I've Been Burned Before" / "I Tried This and It Didn't Work"

**Surface Objection:** Past failure
**Real Objection:** Fear of repeating painful experience, trust issues

**Response Framework:**

```
"I'm really glad you brought that up. What happened?

[Let them vent - they need to tell the story]

That sounds frustrating. I'd be skeptical too.

So help me understand - what specifically went wrong with [previous solution]?

[They explain]

Okay, so it sounds like the issue was [summarize their problem with it].

Let me show you how what we do is fundamentally different:

[Point out specific differentiators]

The reason [previous solution] didn't work is because [explain the gap]. We specifically built our approach to avoid that exact problem.

Here's how: [explain your mechanism]

Plus, we have [guarantee/safety mechanism] so you're not taking the same risk you took before.

Does that address your concern?"
```

**Key Moves:**
- Let them fully vent the story (cathartic)
- Identify the specific failure point
- Differentiate your approach explicitly
- Position your solution as the "anti-version" of what failed
- De-risk with guarantee/safety net

**The Three Reasons Things Fail:**

```
"You know, I've seen hundreds of people try to solve [problem], and when it doesn't work, it's usually one of three reasons:

1. Wrong approach (they tried [common bad approach])
2. Wrong execution (good approach, bad implementation)
3. Wrong timing (did it too early or too late)

Which one was it in your case?

[They identify it]

Okay, so here's how we avoid that: [explain]"
```

### Objection 5: "I Need to Talk to My [Spouse/Partner/Business Partner]"

**Surface Objection:** Need buy-in from someone else
**Real Objection:** Might be real OR they're deflecting responsibility

**Response Framework:**

```
"Of course - I'd want to talk to [them] too if I were in your shoes.

Can I ask: are they generally supportive of investments in the business?

[Usually yes]

Great. So what specifically do you think their concerns would be?

[They reveal concerns - often their own, projected]

Okay, so it sounds like you need to be able to explain [their concerns].

Let me help you with that. Here's exactly what to say:

[Coach them on how to present it]

Now, real talk: Do THEY need to be on this call? Or are you comfortable making this decision?

[If they're the decision maker]

Perfect. So what I'm hearing is you're good with this, you just want to make sure [other person] is comfortable too.

Here's what I suggest: Let's get you started today, and if after talking to [them] you feel like this isn't right, we have [cancellation policy/guarantee] so there's no risk.

That way you're not losing time while [problem] keeps costing you $[X]/month.

Fair?"
```

**Key Moves:**
- Validate the need to consult
- Surface what the "real concerns" are (often their own)
- Offer to help them "sell" the partner
- Create urgency despite needing approval
- Use guarantee to remove risk of deciding now
- Confirm: Are they the decision maker or not?

**If They're NOT the Real Decision Maker:**

```
"No problem. When can we get [other person] on a call?

I don't want to make you explain everything - I'd rather just walk them through it directly so we can answer any questions they have.

Does [specific time] work to loop them in?"
```

### Objection 6: "I'm Already Working With Someone" / "I Have a Solution"

**Surface Objection:** Have a competitor
**Real Objection:** Why should I switch? Fear of change.

**Response Framework:**

```
"That's great - what are you currently doing?

[They explain their current solution]

And how's that working for you?

[Listen carefully - usually there's a gap]

Okay, so it sounds like [current solution] is handling [X], but you're still dealing with [Y problem].

Is that fair?

[Usually yes]

So you're not really looking to replace what's working. You're looking to solve [Y problem] that isn't currently being addressed.

That's actually exactly what we specialize in. We work alongside [current solution] to handle [specific gap].

A lot of our clients use both - [current solution] for [X] and us for [Y].

Would it make sense to fill that gap?"
```

**Key Moves:**
- Don't bash their current solution
- Find the gap/problem still unsolved
- Position as complementary, not replacement
- Make it low-risk to add you

**Alternative Angle - The Switch Framework:**

```
"Got it. Can I ask - if [current solution] was perfect, would we even be on this call?

[They admit there's a problem]

So there's clearly something not working. What is it?

[They reveal the gap]

And how long have you been dealing with that gap?

[Timeline]

And in that time, has [current solution] fixed it?

[No]

So waiting and hoping isn't a strategy. The question is whether you want to keep paying for something that isn't fully solving your problem.

We can solve [specific gap] in [timeframe]. Want to see how?"
```

### Objection 7: "I'm Not Sure This Will Work for My Situation"

**Surface Objection:** Skepticism about fit
**Real Objection:** Fear of wasting money, lack of proof/belief

**Response Framework:**

```
"I appreciate you being honest about that. What specifically makes you think it wouldn't work?

[They explain their concern]

Okay, so you're concerned about [specific factor].

Let me share something with you: We specifically work with [their situation type], and we've seen this exact concern before.

In fact, [Similar Client Name] had the exact same worry. They were [describe similar situation].

Here's what happened: [share specific result]

The reason it worked is because [explain mechanism relevant to their situation].

Your situation is actually pretty similar to [X]% of our clients. The difference is [specific factor], but that's exactly why we [how you handle that factor].

Does that make sense? What else would you need to see to feel confident this would work for you?"
```

**Key Moves:**
- Get specific about their doubt
- Share similar client story (proof)
- Explain WHY it worked despite similar concerns
- Position their "unique situation" as common
- Offer more proof if needed

**The "Unique Situation" Trap:**

```
"I hear you. And you're right - every business is unique.

But here's what I've learned after working with [X] clients: the problems are 90% the same, even if the businesses look different.

You're dealing with [problem]. So is [similar industry]. So is [another industry].

The tactics might be different, but the strategy is identical.

And that's what we provide - the strategy. We customize the tactics to your specific situation.

Make sense?"
```

### Objection 8: "Let Me Do Some Research First"

**Surface Objection:** Need to investigate
**Real Objection:** Stalling, uncertainty, looking for reasons to say no

**Response Framework:**

```
"Absolutely - what specifically do you want to research?

[They give vague answer]

Okay, so it sounds like you want to compare us to other options. That's smart.

Let me save you some time. Here are the three main alternatives people usually consider:

1. [Option 1] - The issue with that is [problem]
2. [Option 2] - That works but [limitation]
3. [Option 3] - Good for [specific case] but not when [their situation]

We built our approach specifically to avoid [problems with alternatives].

Here's what I'd suggest: Instead of spending the next week researching and staying stuck, why don't we just get you started with [trial/guarantee/small commitment]?

You'll learn more in one week of actually implementing than you will in a month of research.

And if after [timeframe] you find something better, [guarantee policy].

Fair?"
```

**Key Moves:**
- Surface what they're actually researching
- Pre-empt competitive research by explaining alternatives
- Position doing as better than researching
- Use trial/guarantee to lower commitment
- Create urgency to stop information gathering

**Alternative Angle - The Analysis Paralysis:**

```
"I get it. But let me ask you something:

How long have you been researching solutions to [problem]?

[They admit it's been a while]

And in that time, has the research solved the problem?

At some point, research becomes procrastination.

You've already done the research - that's why you're on this call.

You know you have [problem]. You know it's costing you $[X]/month. You know it won't fix itself.

The only question is: Do you want to fix it now or keep researching?"
```

### Objection 9: "I Need to See Results First" / "Do You Have a Trial?"

**Surface Objection:** Want proof before commitment
**Real Objection:** Risk aversion, need safety net

**Response Framework:**

```
"I love that you want to see results - that's exactly the right mindset.

Here's the challenge: Real results take [realistic timeframe] to see. There's no way around that.

But I understand you don't want to commit blind. So here's what we do:

[Explain guarantee/milestones/safety net]

Basically, you're not betting on hope. You're betting on [specific proof points]:
- We'll deliver [X] in [timeframe]
- You'll see [Y] by [milestone]
- And if we don't hit [specific metric] by [date], [guarantee]

So you're protected. The risk is on us, not you.

Does that give you enough comfort to move forward?"
```

**Key Moves:**
- Acknowledge results take time (set expectations)
- Provide proof points and milestones
- Shift risk from them to you with guarantee
- Create safety net without "free trial" (which devalues)

**If You Have a Trial Option:**

```
"We do have a [trial period], but here's what I've noticed:

People who start with trials don't fully commit. They're testing, not implementing.

And without full implementation, you don't get real results.

Then the trial ends and they're like 'it didn't work' - but it was never going to work with half effort.

So instead of a trial, I'd rather get you fully committed with [guarantee] protecting you.

That way you're all-in, we get you real results, and you're protected if somehow it doesn't work.

Better than a trial where you're half-in and we're both wasting time.

Make sense?"
```

### Objection 10: "Now's Not the Right Time" / "Maybe in a Few Months"

**Surface Objection:** Timing
**Real Objection:** Avoiding commitment, don't see urgency, other priorities

**Response Framework:**

```
"I hear you. Can I ask - what's going to be different in a few months?

[They give vague answer or admit nothing will change]

Here's what I'm thinking: This problem has existed for [timeline from discovery]. And in that time, has there EVER been a 'perfect time' to fix it?

There's never a perfect time. There's just now and later.

And here's what later costs you:

[Problem] is currently costing $[X]/month. In 3 months, that's $[X × 3] more lost.

Plus, if we start today, you'd have [results] by [future date]. If you wait 3 months, you won't have those results until [later date].

So waiting actually costs you [opportunity cost calculation].

Is whatever you're waiting for worth $[total cost]?"
```

**Key Moves:**
- Challenge their assumption that timing will improve
- Quantify the cost of waiting
- Show opportunity cost (lost results + lost money)
- Make waiting feel more painful than acting

**Alternative Angle - The Priority Question:**

```
"Got it. So what's the priority right now?

[They explain other priorities]

And is that priority solving [their main problem]?

[Usually no]

So you're prioritizing [other thing] over solving a problem that's costing you $[X]/month.

I'm not saying [other priority] isn't important. But I am saying that doing this doesn't stop you from doing that.

In fact, solving [problem] probably HELPS with [other priority].

Am I wrong?"
```

## Advanced Objection Techniques

### The "Take Away" Close

When they're on the fence, take the offer OFF the table temporarily:

```
"You know what, [Name]? I don't think this is right for you.

Here's why: This only works for people who are [committed/urgent/ready to implement].

And it sounds like you're not quite there yet. Which is totally fine - not everyone is.

But I don't want to take your money if you're not ready to go all-in.

So maybe we should just stay in touch and revisit this when you're more ready?"

[They often reverse and convince YOU they're ready]
```

### The "Feel, Felt, Found" Framework

Classic but effective:

```
"I totally understand how you FEEL.

A lot of our best clients FELT the same way.

But here's what they FOUND: [Resolution/result]"
```

### The "Negative Reverse"

When they're uncertain, agree with them:

```
Them: "I'm not sure about this..."

You: "You know what? You might be right. This might not be for you.

This really only works for [ideal client description]. Is that you?

[They usually affirm they ARE that]

Okay, so then what's the real hesitation?"
```

### The Silence Technique

After answering an objection, SHUT UP.

Let them sit with it. The first person to speak loses.

```
You: "So does that address your concern about [objection]?"

[SILENCE - count to 10 if you have to]

[Let them respond]
```

## Objection Prevention (Best Defense Is Offense)

### Pre-empt Common Objections in Your Pitch

Instead of waiting for objections, address them proactively:

```
"Now, you might be thinking: 'This sounds expensive.'

And look, it's not cheap. But here's why...

[Address the objection before they raise it]"
```

**Common Objections to Pre-empt:**
- Price
- Time commitment
- Whether it works for their situation
- Past failures
- Complexity

### Build Urgency Throughout Discovery

If you've done discovery right, objections become illogical:

- They admitted the problem
- They quantified the cost
- They acknowledged past attempts failed
- They painted the future vision
- They agreed it needs to be solved

At that point, objections sound like: "I agree I'm on fire, but I'm not sure about buying the fire extinguisher."

## The Objection Handling Mindset

**Remember:**
- Objections are normal and expected
- They're testing whether you believe
- Your conviction matters more than your words
- Never get defensive or argumentative
- Stay detached from the outcome
- You're helping them make the RIGHT decision, not YOUR decision

**Energy Check:**
- Calm and confident (not pushy)
- Empathetic but firm (not weak)
- Educational (not combative)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ Getting defensive when objections arise
❌ Accepting first objection as final answer
❌ Not isolating the objection
❌ Arguing instead of understanding
❌ Over-explaining (talking yourself out of the sale)
❌ Not using their own numbers/words against objections
❌ Letting them leave without addressing objections
❌ Not asking for the sale after resolving objection

## Objection Handling Success Checklist

For each objection:
- [ ] Acknowledged and validated
- [ ] Clarified the real concern
- [ ] Isolated it as the only blocker
- [ ] Reframed with logic and emotion
- [ ] Used their own discovery data
- [ ] Trial closed to confirm resolution
- [ ] Asked for the sale

## The Golden Rule

**After handling an objection, ALWAYS ask for the sale:**

```
"Does that make sense? Do you feel better about [concern]?

[They say yes]

Great. So let's get you started..."

[Move to close]
```

Don't handle the objection and then wait. That creates space for more objections.
