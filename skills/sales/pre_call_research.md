# Pre-Call Research

## Purpose
Conduct rapid, focused research before sales calls to personalize your approach, anticipate objections, and demonstrate expertise from minute one.

## When to Use
- Before every scheduled discovery call
- Before follow-up calls with warm leads
- Before demo or presentation calls
- When prospect books through your calendar
- Before high-value prospect conversations

## Core Philosophy

**5 minutes of research = 10X better call.**

Most sellers wing it. Elite closers spend 5-10 minutes researching each prospect and use that intel to:
- Build instant rapport (common ground)
- Ask better questions (specific, not generic)
- Anticipate objections (prepare responses)
- Demonstrate competence (know their world)
- Stand out (everyone else is generic)

Your job: Know more about them than they expect you to.

## The 5-Minute Research Framework

### Time Allocation:
```
1 min: Review booking form answers
2 min: Check their website/online presence
1 min: Scan LinkedIn
1 min: Look for recent news/activity
```

Total: 5 minutes, maximum ROI.

## Step 1: Review Booking Form (1 Minute)

**What to Look For:**

```
□ Name (pronunciation, how to address them)
□ Company name
□ Role/title
□ Current revenue/situation
□ Main challenge/pain point
□ Urgency level
□ How they found you
□ Any specific asks or questions
```

**Questions to Ask Yourself:**

- What's the primary problem they stated?
- What's the gap between where they are and want to be?
- Are there red flags? (unrealistic expectations, low budget, etc.)
- What's their urgency level?
- What pre-call assignment did they complete?

**Action:**

Take notes on key points to reference during the call:

```
PROSPECT INTEL:
- Name: [Full name]
- Company: [Name]
- Current State: [Their answer]
- Goal: [Their answer]
- Main Challenge: [Their answer]
- Urgency: [Their answer]
- Source: [How they found you]
```

You'll reference this during discovery to show you listened.

## Step 2: Website/Online Presence (2 Minutes)

### For B2B Service Businesses:

**Check Their Website:**

```
□ What services do they offer?
□ Who do they serve? (their ICP)
□ What's their positioning/unique value prop?
□ Do they have a team page? (size, roles)
□ Recent blog posts or case studies?
□ Pricing visible? (indicates ticket size)
□ Look professional or DIY?
□ Contact info/social links
```

**What This Tells You:**

- Business maturity (professional vs starting out)
- Revenue level (team size, positioning)
- Their problems (gaps in messaging, weak positioning)
- Common ground (if you've worked with similar businesses)

**Key Intel to Note:**

```
- Industry/Niche: [X]
- Who They Serve: [Target audience]
- Team Size: [Estimate]
- Website Quality: [Professional / Basic / Weak]
- Specific Gaps I Notice: [List]
```

### For E-Commerce:

```
□ What products do they sell?
□ Price range? (AOV estimate)
□ Platform? (Shopify, WooCommerce, etc.)
□ Design quality?
□ Email popup? (indicates email marketing)
□ Reviews/testimonials?
□ Social proof?
□ Any obvious conversion issues?
```

### For SaaS/Tech:

```
□ What problem does their product solve?
□ Who's their target customer?
□ Pricing model? (subscription, one-time, enterprise)
□ Stage? (pre-launch, growing, scaling)
□ Funding? (bootstrapped vs backed)
□ Competitors in space?
```

**Pro Tip:** Open their site during call and reference specific things:

```
"I was looking at your site before this - I saw you offer [specific service]. How's that going?"
```

Shows you did homework. Builds instant credibility.

## Step 3: LinkedIn Scan (1 Minute)

**Find Their LinkedIn Profile:**

```
□ Job title (current)
□ How long in current role?
□ Previous roles? (career trajectory)
□ Location
□ Company size (on company page)
□ Recent posts or activity?
□ Connections in common?
□ Interests/groups?
```

**What This Tells You:**

- **Seniority:** Are they decision maker?
- **Experience:** Are they new to role (more risk-averse) or veteran?
- **Common Ground:** Mutual connections, alma mater, shared interests
- **Activity:** Are they active on LinkedIn? (indicates engagement level)

**Key Intel to Note:**

```
- Title: [Exact title]
- Years in Role: [X]
- Decision Maker?: [Yes/No/Maybe]
- Common Connections: [Names if any]
- Recent Activity: [Posts, job changes, etc.]
```

**How to Use This:**

```
Early in call:
"I saw on LinkedIn you've been [Role] for [X] years - what's that been like?"

Or:

"I noticed we're both connected to [Mutual Connection] - small world!"
```

Instant rapport.

## Step 4: Recent News/Activity (1 Minute)

**Quick Google Search:**

```
"[Company Name] news"
"[Company Name] [Recent Year]"
```

**Look For:**

```
□ Recent funding announcements
□ New product launches
□ Awards or recognition
□ Hiring sprees (indicates growth)
□ Press mentions
□ Podcast appearances
□ Blog posts or articles they wrote
□ Social media posts (LinkedIn, Twitter)
```

**What This Tells You:**

- Current priorities (hiring = scaling, funding = growth mode)
- Momentum (positive news = good time to invest)
- Topics they care about (content they create/share)

**Key Intel to Note:**

```
Recent Activity:
- [News item 1]
- [News item 2]
- [Social post topic]
```

**How to Use This:**

```
"I saw you just [launched X / hired for Y role / wrote about Z] - congrats! How's that going?"
```

Shows you're paying attention. Makes them feel important.

## Advanced Research Tactics

### For High-Value Prospects (10-15 Minutes)

If it's a dream client or high ticket, go deeper:

#### 1. Social Media Deep Dive

**Twitter/X:**
- Recent tweets (what they care about)
- Who they follow (influences)
- Tone (formal vs casual)

**Instagram (if relevant):**
- Personal interests
- Lifestyle (helps with rapport)

**YouTube:**
- Do they have a channel?
- What topics do they cover?
- Watch one video for context

#### 2. Podcast Appearances

Search: "[Their Name] podcast"

Listen to 10-15 minutes for:
- How they think
- Their communication style
- Pain points they mention
- Goals they discuss

#### 3. Competitor Analysis

Who are their main competitors?

```
Google: "alternatives to [their company]"
Google: "competitors to [their company]"
```

Understand their competitive landscape = better positioning.

#### 4. Tech Stack (For Tech-Savvy Businesses)

Use tools like:
- BuiltWith.com (what tech they use)
- Wappalyzer (browser extension)

Tells you:
- What tools they're already using
- Integrations they need
- Budget level (expensive tools = higher budget)

#### 5. Glassdoor/Reviews

If they have employees:
- Check Glassdoor for company culture
- Check Google Reviews for customer sentiment

Red flags = internal issues or customer problems.

## Research-Based Opening Lines

Use your research to create custom openers:

### Website-Based:

```
"I was checking out your site before this call - I saw you work with [their market]. How long have you been focused on that niche?"
```

### LinkedIn-Based:

```
"I noticed you've been [Role] for [X] years - what made you get into [industry]?"
```

### Recent Activity-Based:

```
"I saw you recently [launched X / posted about Y] - that's awesome. How's it going so far?"
```

### Common Connection-Based:

```
"I saw we're both connected to [Name] - how do you know them?"
```

### Location-Based:

```
"I saw you're based in [City] - I actually [visited there / worked with several businesses there / have family there]. How's the business scene there?"
```

**Why These Work:**

- Show you did homework (respect)
- Specific (not generic)
- Easy to answer (comfortable)
- Build rapport quickly

```

## Research Red Flags

Things to watch for that indicate potential issues:

```
🚩 No website or very outdated site (might not be serious)
🚩 LinkedIn says "looking for opportunities" (in transition, might not have budget)
🚩 Brand new business (<3 months) (no revenue, no budget)
🚩 No team listed (solopreneur, might not scale)
🚩 Spelling errors on site (attention to detail issues)
🚩 No social media presence (not digitally savvy)
🚩 Negative reviews/Glassdoor (internal problems)
🚩 Competitor research shows them as "cheap option" (price-sensitive)
```

**Don't disqualify based on red flags alone, but adjust approach:**

- More education needed
- More proof required
- Different pricing strategy
- Longer sales cycle

## Common Research Mistakes

❌ Spending 30+ minutes (diminishing returns)
❌ Researching but not taking notes (forgetting during call)
❌ Not referencing research on call (wasted effort)
❌ Making assumptions based on limited info
❌ Stalking them on social media (creepy if you mention too much)
❌ Letting research bias you negatively
❌ Not documenting findings in CRM

## Research Best Practices

✅ Set a timer (5-10 min max)
✅ Take notes in structured template
✅ Focus on actionable intel
✅ Reference 2-3 things on call (not everything)
✅ Use research to personalize, not impress
✅ Update CRM with findings
✅ Note objections to anticipate
✅ Prepare custom opener

---

## Post-Call Research Integration

After call, add to CRM:

```
CALL NOTES:
- Date: [Date]
- Duration: [Min]
- Outcome: [Closed / Follow-up / Dead]

RESEARCH USED:
- [What research points helped]

ADDITIONAL INTEL GATHERED:
- [New things learned on call]

NEXT STEPS:
- [Follow-up actions]
```

This helps with:
- Future calls with same prospect
- Training team on what works
- Refining research process

---

## Quick Reference: 30-Second Research Hack

If you literally have 30 seconds:

1. **Read their booking form** (20 seconds)
2. **Open their website homepage** (10 seconds)

That's it. Reference these two things on call:

```
"So you mentioned [form answer] - tell me about that."

"I took a quick look at your site - you focus on [what you saw]. How's that going?"
```

Better than nothing.

---

## The Golden Rule

**Research is a tool for connection, not interrogation.**

Use it to:
- Show respect (you cared enough to look)
- Build rapport (common ground)
- Ask better questions (specific, not generic)
- Stand out (everyone else is lazy)

Don't use it to:
- Show off how much you know
- Overwhelm them with details
- Make assumptions about their business
- Skip actual discovery

Research informs discovery. It doesn't replace it.
