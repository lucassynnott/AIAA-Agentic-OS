# Close With ROI Logic

## Purpose
Close sales using mathematical ROI frameworks that make saying "no" financially illogical.

## When to Use
- After completing discovery and surfacing all pain points
- When presenting pricing/investment
- When handling price objections
- To justify higher-ticket offers
- When prospect needs logical justification for decision

## Core Philosophy

**Your job:** Make the ROI so obvious that NOT buying is the expensive decision.

**The Formula:** Show that Cost of Problem > Cost of Solution = Obvious Decision

When done right, the prospect sells themselves through math.

## The ROI Close Framework

### Step 1: Document Current State Cost (Done in Discovery)

You should have already calculated this during discovery:

**Current Monthly Revenue:** $[X]
**Goal Monthly Revenue:** $[Y]
**Gap:** $[Z]/month
**How Long Stuck:** [N] months
**Total Lost:** $[Z × N]

### Step 2: Calculate Ongoing Cost of Inaction

```
"Okay, so let's just put the numbers on paper.

Right now, you're at $[current revenue]/month.
You want to be at $[goal revenue]/month.
That's a $[gap]/month difference.

You've been stuck at this level for [N] months.
Which means in that time, you've already left $[gap × N] on the table.

Now, if nothing changes in the next 90 days, you'll lose another $[gap × 3].

In the next year? That's $[gap × 12].

Are those numbers accurate?"

[Wait for confirmation]
```

### Step 3: Calculate Solution Investment

```
"Now, our investment to fix this is $[price].

Let's just do the math:

Cost of doing nothing for 90 days: $[gap × 3]
Cost of solving it with us: $[price]

The difference is $[gap × 3 - price].

And that's JUST in the first 90 days.

Over 12 months?

Cost of doing nothing: $[gap × 12]
Cost of solving it: $[price]

That's a $[gap × 12 - price] difference.

So really, can you afford NOT to do this?"
```

### Step 4: Calculate Upside ROI

```
"And that's just the cost savings from stopping the bleeding.

We haven't even talked about the upside.

If we help you go from $[current] to $[goal] per month...

That's an additional $[gap]/month in revenue.

Over 12 months, that's $[gap × 12].

So you're investing $[price] to generate $[gap × 12].

That's a [calculate: (gap × 12) ÷ price]X return on investment.

Where else can you put $[price] and get a [X]X return?"
```

### Step 5: Time Value Calculation

```
"Plus, let's talk about timing.

If we start today, you'd have this solved by [date 90 days out].

If you wait 3 months to decide, you won't have it solved until [date 6 months out].

That's 3 extra months of:
- Losing $[gap × 3] more
- Staying stuck where you are
- Dealing with the stress and frustration

Is waiting worth $[gap × 3] to you?"
```

## ROI Calculation Frameworks

### Framework 1: Revenue Gap ROI

**Use When:** Prospect has revenue goal they're not hitting

**Formula:**
```
Monthly Revenue Gap: $[goal - current]
Annual Opportunity Cost: $[gap × 12]
Your Investment: $[price]
Net Gain Year 1: $[gap × 12 - price]
ROI Multiple: $[gap × 12 ÷ price]X
```

**Script:**
```
"You want to go from $[current] to $[goal] per month.

That's $[gap]/month you're currently NOT making.

Over a year, that's $[gap × 12] in lost revenue.

Our investment is $[price].

Which means in Year 1 alone, you net $[gap × 12 - price].

That's a [ROI multiple]X return.

And that's just Year 1. Every year after that is pure upside.

Make sense?"
```

### Framework 2: Cost Savings ROI

**Use When:** Your solution reduces their expenses or saves them time

**Formula:**
```
Current Cost per Month: $[X]
Savings per Month with Solution: $[Y]
Annual Savings: $[Y × 12]
Your Investment: $[price]
Payback Period: $[price ÷ Y] months
```

**Script:**
```
"Right now, you're spending $[X]/month on [current solution/problem].

With our system, that drops to $[X - Y]/month.

That's $[Y]/month in savings.

Over a year, you save $[Y × 12].

Our investment is $[price].

Which means you break even in [payback period] months.

After that, you're saving $[Y]/month forever.

Over 3 years, that's $[Y × 36] saved.

How much longer do you want to keep paying $[X]/month?"
```

### Framework 3: Time Value ROI

**Use When:** Your solution saves them significant time

**Formula:**
```
Hours Saved per Week: [X]
Their Hourly Value: $[Y] (calculate: annual income ÷ 2000)
Monthly Time Value Saved: $[X × 4 × Y]
Annual Time Value: $[X × 4 × Y × 12]
Your Investment: $[price]
ROI: $[annual time value ÷ price]X
```

**Script:**
```
"You mentioned you spend about [X] hours per week dealing with [problem].

Let's value your time conservatively at $[hourly rate]/hour.

That's $[X × hourly rate] per week, or $[X × hourly rate × 52] per year of your time going to this problem.

Our solution gives you [X] hours back per week.

That's worth $[annual time value] per year.

We charge $[price].

So you're investing $[price] to get back $[annual time value] worth of your time.

That's a [ROI multiple]X return - and you get to use those hours to make MORE money.

What would you do with an extra [X] hours per week?"
```

### Framework 4: Opportunity Cost ROI

**Use When:** Their problem is preventing them from seizing opportunities

**Formula:**
```
Value of Opportunity Missed: $[X]
Frequency of Missed Opportunities: [Y] per year
Annual Opportunity Cost: $[X × Y]
Your Investment: $[price]
```

**Script:**
```
"You said earlier that you've had to turn down [opportunity type] because of [problem].

How many times has that happened in the last year?

[They answer: Y times]

And what's the average value of those opportunities?

[They answer: $X]

So you've missed out on $[X × Y] in the last year because of this problem.

Our investment is $[price].

So for less than [calculate: price ÷ (X × Y) × 100]% of what you've ALREADY lost, you can fix this permanently.

And then you can say YES to those opportunities going forward.

How much would just ONE of those opportunities pay for this?"
```

### Framework 5: Customer Lifetime Value ROI

**Use When:** Your solution helps them get/retain more customers

**Formula:**
```
Average Customer Lifetime Value: $[CLV]
Additional Customers per Month: [X]
Additional Annual Revenue: $[CLV × X × 12]
Your Investment: $[price]
ROI: $[annual additional revenue ÷ price]X
```

**Script:**
```
"What's the average lifetime value of a customer for you?

[They answer: $CLV]

And right now you're getting [current] new customers per month, but you want [goal], right?

[Confirm]

So that's [gap] more customers per month you're NOT getting.

At $[CLV] per customer, that's $[CLV × gap] per month in lost CLV.

Over a year? $[CLV × gap × 12].

We can help you close that gap for $[price].

So you're investing $[price] to capture $[CLV × gap × 12] in customer lifetime value.

That's [ROI multiple]X ROI.

And every customer after that is pure profit.

How many new customers would it take to pay for this?"
```

## The Visual ROI Close

Draw this out on screen share or paper:

```
Current State:
├─ Revenue: $[current]/mo
├─ Gap to Goal: $[gap]/mo
├─ Months Stuck: [N]
└─ Total Lost: $[gap × N]

Cost of Waiting 12 Months:
└─ Lost Revenue: $[gap × 12]

Our Investment:
└─ $[price]

Net Gain Year 1:
└─ $[gap × 12 - price]

ROI:
└─ [ROI multiple]X return

Break Even:
└─ [price ÷ gap] months
```

Then say:

```
"Look at this math.

You're either going to invest $[price] with us and gain $[net gain]...

Or you're going to invest $[gap × 12] in doing nothing and gain $0.

Which investment makes more sense?"
```

## Advanced ROI Closes

### The "Two Investments" Close

```
"Here's how I see it:

You're going to make an investment either way.

Option 1: Invest $[gap × 12] in staying stuck for another year. Return: $0.

Option 2: Invest $[price] in solving this. Return: $[gap × 12 - price].

Both are investments. But only one gives you a return.

Which investment do you want to make?"
```

### The "Pays for Itself" Close

```
"This investment literally pays for itself in [payback period] months.

After that, it's pure profit.

So you're not really spending $[price]. You're just moving money from [waste area] to [solution area].

And then after [payback period] months, you pocket the difference forever.

Does that make sense?"
```

### The "First Client Pays for It" Close

```
"What's your average client worth?

[They answer: $X]

So your first [calculate: price ÷ X] clients pay for this entire investment.

After that, every client is pure ROI.

How long would it take you to land [price ÷ X] clients with our system?

[They estimate]

Great. So in [timeframe], this pays for itself. Then it's making you money forever.

Why would you NOT do this?"
```

### The "Cost Per Month" Reframe

```
"I know $[price] sounds like a lot. Let's break it down differently.

Our engagement is [X] months.

That's $[price ÷ X] per month.

You're currently losing $[gap] per month from this problem.

So you're paying $[price ÷ X] to save $[gap].

That's a $[gap - (price ÷ X)] net gain per month WHILE we're working together.

And then after we're done, you save the full $[gap] per month forever.

When you look at it that way, can you afford NOT to do this?"
```

## Handling ROI Objections

### "But What If It Doesn't Work?"

```
"Fair question. Let's talk about that.

Here's what we know:
1. What you're doing now ISN'T working - that's why we're talking
2. It's costing you $[gap]/month to keep doing what isn't working
3. We have [guarantee/safety net] so your risk is limited

So really, the question is: What's riskier?

Continuing to lose $[gap]/month doing what you know doesn't work?

Or investing $[price] in a proven system with [guarantee] protecting you?

I'd argue doing nothing is the bigger risk."
```

### "I Need to See ROI Before I Invest"

```
"I get that. But here's the challenge:

ROI requires implementation. Implementation requires investment.

It's like saying 'I need to lose weight before I join the gym.'

The gym doesn't show results until you use it.

Same here. We can't show YOU ROI until we implement for YOU.

But here's what we CAN show:

[Case studies, results, proof]

These are people in your exact situation who made the investment and got [ROI].

The question is: Do you want to be one of those success stories? Or do you want to keep losing $[gap]/month waiting for proof?"
```

## ROI Presentation Checklist

Before closing, ensure you've covered:
- [ ] Current monthly cost of problem ($X)
- [ ] How long problem has existed (X months/years)
- [ ] Total cost so far ($X × months)
- [ ] Future cost if nothing changes ($X × 12)
- [ ] Your investment amount
- [ ] Payback period (months to break even)
- [ ] Net gain Year 1 (savings minus investment)
- [ ] ROI multiple (return ÷ investment)
- [ ] Upside potential (new revenue possible)
- [ ] Time value (cost of waiting)

## The ROI Close Script (Full Assembly)

```
"Okay [Name], let's just do the math together.

Based on everything you've told me:

You're currently at $[current]/month
You want to be at $[goal]/month
The gap is $[gap]/month

You've been stuck here for [N] months.
That's already cost you $[gap × N].

If nothing changes in the next year, you'll lose another $[gap × 12].

Our investment to fix this is $[price].

So let's compare:

Cost of doing nothing for 12 months: $[gap × 12]
Cost of solving it with us: $[price]

That's a $[gap × 12 - price] difference.

Plus, once we solve this, you'll actually hit that $[goal]/month.

That's $[gap]/month in NEW revenue.

Over 12 months: $[gap × 12] in upside.

So you invest $[price] to gain $[gap × 12].

That's a [ROI multiple]X return.

And this pays for itself in [payback period] months. After that, it's pure profit.

Now, knowing these numbers, can you afford NOT to do this?

[Wait for response]

Great. Let's get you started."
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ Using hypothetical numbers instead of THEIR numbers
❌ Not quantifying cost of problem in discovery
❌ Skipping the "total lost so far" calculation
❌ Not showing break-even timeline
❌ Forgetting to add upside (new revenue)
❌ Making ROI calculations too complex
❌ Not asking for the sale after showing ROI
❌ Getting defensive if they question the math
❌ Using industry averages instead of their specifics

## The Golden Rule of ROI Closing

**If you've done discovery right, the ROI math should be SO obvious that objecting is illogical.**

When a prospect says "It's expensive" after seeing they'll lose $120K by doing nothing vs investing $10K, that's not a price objection - it's a belief objection.

Go back and rebuild belief, social proof, and conviction.

## Post-ROI Close

After they agree to the ROI logic:

```
"So when you look at these numbers, does it make sense to move forward?

[They say yes]

Perfect. Let me walk you through next steps...

[Move to onboarding/payment]"
```

Don't linger after they agree. Strike while the logic is fresh.
