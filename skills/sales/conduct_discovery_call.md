# Conduct Discovery Call

## Purpose
Masterfully uncover prospect pain points, build urgency, and position your solution during the discovery phase of a sales call.

## When to Use
- First call with qualified prospect
- During sales call before pitching
- When prospect needs help articulating problems
- To establish fit before proposing solution

## Core Philosophy

**Your Job:** Help prospect verbally acknowledge their problems and the cost of inaction.

**Not Your Job:** Pitch immediately, talk about yourself, or collect payment.

## Bullet-Proof Discovery Structure

### Phase 1: Relationship Building (2-3 min)

**Goal:** Make them comfortable, establish rapport

```
"Hey [Name], great to finally connect! Before we dive in, tell me a bit about yourself - how'd you get into [their business/role]?"

[Listen actively, find commonalities, be genuinely curious]

"That's awesome. So just to make sure this is valuable for both of us - what specifically made you want to hop on this call today?"
```

**Key Moves:**
- Be warm but professional
- Find something relatable
- Transition smoothly to business
- Let them talk first

### Phase 2: Current State Analysis (5-7 min)

**Goal:** Understand where they are now

**Questions to Ask:**

**Business Overview:**
- "Walk me through your current [service/business model]"
- "What's your revenue right now? What's the goal?"
- "How are you currently getting clients?"
- "What's working well?"

**Team & Operations:**
- "Is it just you or do you have a team?"
- "What do you spend most of your time on?"
- "Where do you feel bottlenecked?"

**Current Efforts:**
- "What have you tried so far to solve [problem]?"
- "What happened with that?"
- "How much have you invested in trying to fix this?"

**Dig Deeper with:**
- "Tell me more about that..."
- "What do you mean by [their term]?"
- "Why do you think that is?"
- "How long has this been an issue?"

### Phase 3: Pain Point Excavation (8-10 min)

**Goal:** Make the problem REAL and URGENT

**The Framework:**
1. Identify surface problem
2. Dig to root cause
3. Quantify the cost
4. Build emotional urgency

**Example Flow:**

```
Prospect: "We're just not getting enough leads."

You: "Not enough leads - what does that mean specifically? How many are you getting vs how many do you need?"

Prospect: "Getting maybe 5-10 per month, need more like 30-40."

You: "Got it. And what happens if you only get 5-10? How does that affect the business?"

Prospect: "Well, we can only close maybe 2 of those, so we're only adding 2 clients per month."

You: "And at 2 clients per month, what does that mean for revenue?"

Prospect: "We're basically flat, maybe $20K/month."

You: "Okay, so you're stuck at $20K when you should be at what?"

Prospect: "We need to be at $60K to justify the team and actually pay myself properly."

You: "So there's a $40K per month gap. How long has this been the case?"

Prospect: "About 6 months now."

You: "So that's $240K you've left on the table while being stuck in this spot. And if nothing changes, that number keeps growing every month. Is that fair to say?"

Prospect: "Yeah, that's exactly it."
```

**Key Techniques:**
- Ask "why" and "what happens if"
- Quantify everything in dollars
- Calculate opportunity cost
- Use their words back to them
- Make them say the painful truth
- Build up the cost of inaction

**Power Questions:**
- "What does that cost you per month?"
- "How long have you been dealing with this?"
- "What happens if this doesn't get solved in the next 90 days?"
- "What have you sacrificed because of this?"
- "On a scale of 1-10, how urgent is fixing this?"
- "What's the real cost if this continues for another year?"

### Phase 4: Future State Visioning (3-5 min)

**Goal:** Paint the transformation picture

```
"So help me understand - if we solve [problem], what does your business look like in 6 months?"

"What becomes possible that isn't possible now?"

"What does that mean for you personally?"

"How does that change your day-to-day?"
```

**Get them to articulate:**
- Specific revenue targets
- Team structure
- Time freedom
- Lifestyle changes
- Business impact
- Personal fulfillment

**Make it emotional:**
- "How would that feel?"
- "What would that mean for [family/goals]?"
- "What's the first thing you'd do if you hit that number?"

### Phase 5: Obstacles & Objections (3-5 min)

**Goal:** Surface objections BEFORE you pitch

```
"So what's held you back from solving this before now?"

"What are you most concerned about when it comes to [solution type]?"

"What would need to be true for you to move forward with something like this?"

"Have you looked into other solutions? What did you think?"
```

**Common Responses & How to Handle:**

**"It's expensive"**
- "What do you mean by expensive? Like relative to what?"
- "How much does it cost you per month to NOT solve this?"
- [Already calculated earlier - reference that number]

**"I don't have time"**
- "More time than dealing with [problem] every day?"
- "What if it actually freed up time - would that be valuable?"

**"I've been burned before"**
- "I get it - what happened?"
- [Let them vent, empathize]
- "What would need to be different this time?"

**"I need to think about it"**
- "Totally fair - what specifically do you need to think about?"
- "What information would help you make that decision?"

### Phase 6: Permission to Present (1-2 min)

**Goal:** Get buy-in before pitching

```
"Okay, so based on everything you've told me:
- You're at [current state]
- You want to get to [desired state]
- The gap is costing you [$ amount] per month
- You've tried [previous attempts] without success

Does that sound accurate?"

[Wait for agreement]

"And if I could show you how we help people in your exact situation go from [A] to [B], would that be valuable to hear?"

[They say yes]

"Cool, let me walk you through it..."

[NOW you pitch]
```

## Discovery Question Bank

### Future State Questions

## Listening Techniques

### Active Listening
- Take notes on EVERYTHING
- Repeat their exact phrases back
- "Let me make sure I understand..."
- Use silence (don't fill every gap)

### What to Listen For
- **Revenue numbers** (calculate gaps)
- **Timeline language** ("for 6 months", "since last year")
- **Emotional words** ("frustrated", "stuck", "exhausted")
- **Previous failures** (what to differentiate from)
- **Decision making** (who else involved?)

### Mirror and Match
- Use their terminology
- Match their energy level
- Reference their specific examples
- Quote them back to themselves

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ Pitching too early (before pain is established)
❌ Accepting surface-level answers
❌ Not quantifying the cost
❌ Talking more than listening (should be 70/30 them/you)
❌ Skipping emotional urgency
❌ Not addressing objections before pitching
❌ Letting them stay comfortable
❌ Not taking notes
❌ Rushing through discovery
❌ Not getting permission to present
