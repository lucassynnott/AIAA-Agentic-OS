# Create High-Ticket Offer

## Description
Learn how to structure irresistible high-ticket offers that sell to cold traffic. Master the three components of offer strength: Claims, Guarantees, and Evidence. Transform from a commodity service provider into a results-focused solution with offers so good they leave nothing for competitors.

## When to Use This Skill
- You're struggling to close cold traffic
- Your offers feel weak compared to competitors
- You want to charge premium prices
- You need to stand out in a crowded market
- You're launching a new high-ticket service

## The Offer Strength Principle

### Market Share Works Exponentially

The people with the BEST offers take ALL the business. The difference between an offer strength of 5 vs 7 isn't linear - it's exponential.

**Offer Strength Scale:**
- **1-2:** Getting zero clients, might as well quit
- **3-4:** Still basically nothing, wasting your time
- **5:** Starting to get somewhere, barely viable
- **6-7:** This is where real money is made
- **8-9:** Dominating your market
- **10:** Industry leader, clients begging to work with you

Your goal: Build a 7+ offer that leaves nothing for competitors.

## The Three Components of a Winning Offer

### 1. CLAIM (What result will they get?)

The claim is your promise. It answers: "What will happen if I buy this?"

**Service vs Offer:**
- ❌ Service: "I will make videos for you"
- ✅ Offer: "I will get you 100k views per month"

**Left Side of Timeline (Service):**
- Videos → Views → Followers → Leads → Sales Calls → Clients
- These are deliverables, NOT outcomes

**Right Side of Timeline (Offer):**
- Claims focus on outcomes: Views, Followers, Leads, Sales Calls, Clients
- The further right you go, the stronger your offer

**How to Move Right on the Timeline:**

Start with your service deliverable and ask "Why?"
- Q: Why do clients want [your deliverable]?
- A: To get [next outcome]
- Q: Why do they want [that outcome]?
- A: To get [next outcome]
- Repeat until you reach their REAL goal

**Example - Content Agency:**
1. Videos (deliverable)
2. → Why? To get Views
3. → Why? To get Followers
4. → Why? To get Leads
5. → Why? To get Sales Calls
6. → Why? To get Clients
7. → Why? To get Revenue

**Your Claim Should Be:**
- ✅ Specific and measurable
- ✅ Timeline-bound
- ✅ As far right as you can credibly promise
- ✅ Remarkable enough to stand out

**Claim Examples by Service:**

**Ad Agency:**
- Weak: "We'll run your Meta ads"
- Strong: "We'll generate 50+ qualified sales calls per month"
- Strongest: "We'll sign you 10+ clients per month at under $500 CAC"

**Content Agency:**
- Weak: "We'll edit your videos"
- Strong: "We'll get you 1M+ views per month"
- Strongest: "We'll generate 100+ inbound leads per month from your content"

**Cold Email Agency:**
- Weak: "We'll send cold emails for you"
- Strong: "We'll book you 20+ qualified sales calls per month"
- Strongest: "We'll generate $50k+ in new revenue per month"

**Funnel Agency:**
- Weak: "We'll build your funnel"
- Strong: "We'll increase your funnel conversion rate by 50%"
- Strongest: "We'll add $100k+ in monthly revenue with a new funnel"

### 2. GUARANTEE (What if it doesn't work?)

The guarantee removes risk. It answers: "What happens if I don't get the result?"

**Why Guarantees Work:**
- They demonstrate confidence
- They remove buyer risk
- They force you to deliver results
- They make your offer remarkable

**Guarantee Strength Levels:**

**Level 1: Money-Back Guarantee**
"If you don't get [result], we'll refund 100% of your investment"

**Level 2: Extended Guarantee**
"If you don't get [result] in [timeframe], we'll work for free until you do"

**Level 3: Results or Free**
"If we don't get you [result] in [timeframe], you don't pay anything"

**Level 4: Pay-on-Performance**
"You only pay when we deliver [result]"

**Level 5: Negative Risk Reversal**
"If we don't get you [result], we'll pay YOU $[amount]"

**Level 6: Revenue Share**
"We only make money when you make money - we take X% of revenue generated"

**Guarantee Examples:**

**Ad Agency:**
- "If we don't generate at least 30 qualified sales calls in your first 60 days, we'll refund every penny AND pay you $1,000 for wasted time"

**Content Agency:**
- "If your content doesn't generate at least 500k views in 90 days, we'll work for free until it does"

**Cold Email Agency:**
- "If we don't book you 15+ sales calls in the first 30 days, we'll refund your entire setup fee and continue working for free until we hit that number"

**Funnel Agency:**
- "If our new funnel doesn't beat your current conversion rate by at least 30%, we'll rebuild it for free and refund your investment"

**How to Create Your Guarantee:**

1. **Identify your claim**
2. **Set a reasonable timeframe**
3. **Determine what you'll do if you fail**
4. **Add a cherry on top** (bonus, extra work, payment, etc.)

**Example Formula:**
"If we don't [your claim] within [timeframe], we'll [refund/work free/pay you] AND [bonus]"

### 3. EVIDENCE (Who else has it worked for?)

Evidence is your proof. It answers: "Who else have you done this for?"

**Types of Evidence:**

**Tier 1: Screenshots**
- Revenue screenshots
- Metrics screenshots
- Results data
- Before/after comparisons

**Tier 2: Written Testimonials**
- Client quotes
- Text testimonials
- Email testimonials
- LinkedIn recommendations

**Tier 3: Video Testimonials**
- Client recorded videos
- Case study videos
- Interview format
- Results walkthrough

**Tier 4: Detailed Case Studies**
- Full story format
- Before/after/bridge
- Specific numbers and outcomes
- Visually designed

**Tier 5: Logo Wall**
- Notable clients
- Brand names
- Industry leaders
- Authority by association

**The Evidence Trade-Off:**

If you have MASSIVE evidence (tons of case studies, big-name clients, proven track record):
- You can reduce your guarantee strength
- You can sometimes reduce claim boldness
- Your proof does the selling

If you have LITTLE/NO evidence:
- You MUST have a strong claim
- You MUST have a strong guarantee
- Your offer must be irresistible to compensate

**When Starting Out:**
- Lead with guarantee (strong risk reversal)
- Make bold but achievable claims
- Build evidence fast through Dream 100 and early wins
- As evidence builds, you can reduce guarantee strength

## Offer Formula

### The Complete Offer Statement:

```
We will [CLAIM: specific outcome]
within [TIMEFRAME]
or [GUARANTEE: what happens if you fail]

Proven by [EVIDENCE: who you've done this for]
```

### Examples:

**Ad Agency:**
"We'll generate 50+ qualified sales calls per month from Meta ads within your first 90 days, or we'll refund every penny and pay you $2,000 for wasted time. We've done this for 27 clients including [Notable Client 1], [Notable Client 2], and [Notable Client 3]."

**Content Agency:**
"We'll get your content 1M+ views per month and generate 50+ inbound leads within 120 days, or we'll work for free until you hit those numbers. We've scaled [Client Name]'s YouTube from 10k to 500k+ views per month and helped [Client Name 2] generate $250k in revenue from content."

## How to Structure Your Offer

### Option 1: Performance-Based Pricing

**Structure:**
- Low/no upfront fee
- Pay based on results delivered

- Can charge more per result
- Natural filter for serious clients

**Cons:**
- Delayed payment
- Requires strong delivery capability
- Risk if clients don't close

### Option 2: Guarantee-Heavy Retainer

**Structure:**
- Monthly retainer
- Strong guarantee removes risk
- Results promised within timeframe

**Example:**
"$10,000/month retainer, 50+ calls per month guaranteed or work for free"

**Pros:**
- Predictable revenue
- Upfront payment
- Professional positioning

**Cons:**
- Need strong guarantee to sell cold traffic
- Must deliver or lose credibility

### Option 3: Hybrid Model

**Structure:**
- Base retainer + performance bonus
- Reduced risk, aligned incentives

**Example:**
"$5,000/month + $150 per call booked over 30 calls"

**Pros:**
- Balanced risk
- Predictable base income
- Upside potential

**Cons:**
- More complex to explain
- Requires tracking and trust

## Testing Your Offer

### The "Market Response" Test

**Good Offer Signs:**
- ✅ People respond to outreach
- ✅ Prospects book calls easily
- ✅ Sales calls convert 20%+
- ✅ People say "this sounds great"
- ✅ Objections are about fit, not risk

**Weak Offer Signs:**
- ❌ Low response rates
- ❌ Hard to get people on calls
- ❌ Sales calls convert under 10%
- ❌ Lots of "let me think about it"
- ❌ Objections about risk/trust

### The "Girlfriend Test"

Just like dating - if you're confused whether someone likes you, they don't.

If you're getting mixed signals from the market, the market isn't into you. Your offer needs work.

### Offer Iteration Process:

1. **Launch offer**
2. **Track response rate**
3. **Track booking rate**
4. **Track close rate**
5. **Identify where it breaks down**
6. **Adjust accordingly:**
   - Low response → Strengthen claim
   - Low booking → Add guarantee
   - Low close → Add evidence or increase guarantee

## Offer Positioning Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Being too left on the timeline**
- Don't sell deliverables (videos, ads, funnels)
- Sell outcomes (leads, sales, revenue)

❌ **No guarantee with no evidence**
- If you're new, you MUST have strong guarantee
- Can't sell cold traffic on hope alone

❌ **Vague claims**
- "We'll grow your business" ← Too vague
- "We'll add 30 new clients in 90 days" ← Specific

❌ **Unrealistic claims**
- Don't promise what you can't deliver
- Overpromising kills credibility

❌ **Complicated offers**
- Keep it simple and clear
- One clear promise, one clear guarantee

❌ **Competing on price**
- Race to bottom
- Attracts wrong clients
- Use guarantee to remove price objections

## Advanced Offer Strategies

### Strategy 1: The Guarantee Ladder

Start with insane guarantee to build evidence, then reduce over time:

**Month 1-3:** "Results or we pay you $5k"
**Month 4-6:** "Results or 100% refund"
**Month 7-9:** "Results or work until we deliver"
**Month 10+:** Minimal guarantee, evidence does the selling

### Strategy 2: The Tiered Offer

Offer multiple packages with different guarantees:

**Silver:** Standard service, 30-day money-back guarantee
**Gold:** Enhanced service, results guarantee
**Platinum:** Full-service, performance-based pricing

### Strategy 3: The Authority Play

Use big-name clients to reduce guarantee need:

"The same system we used for [Big Brand] and [Big Brand 2]"
- Evidence compensates for weaker guarantee

### Strategy 4: The Negative Risk Reversal

Make it MORE risky to NOT work with you:

"Every month you wait costs you $50k in lost revenue. Our setup takes 2 weeks. The real risk is waiting."

## Creating Your First High-Ticket Offer

### Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Define Your Service**
What do you actually deliver? (videos, ads, funnels, etc.)

**Step 2: Move Right on Timeline**
Ask "why?" until you reach the real outcome clients want

**Step 3: Determine Achievable Claim**
What outcome can you REALISTICALLY promise?

**Step 4: Set Timeline**
How long will it take to deliver that outcome?

**Step 5: Create Guarantee**
What will you do if you fail to deliver?

**Step 6: Compile Evidence**
What proof do you have? (if none, guarantee must be stronger)

**Step 7: Write Offer Statement**
Combine claim + guarantee + evidence into one statement

**Step 8: Test the Market**
Launch it, track metrics, iterate

## Final Thoughts

Your offer is everything. You can have the best service, best team, best process - but if your offer isn't remarkable, you'll struggle to sign clients from cold traffic.

The formula is simple:
- **No Evidence** = Need strong CLAIM + strong GUARANTEE
- **Some Evidence** = Need good CLAIM + good GUARANTEE
- **Tons of Evidence** = Can reduce CLAIM and GUARANTEE strength

When starting out, lean HARD into guarantees. Build evidence fast. As your proof builds, your offer naturally becomes stronger.

Remember: If it feels like climbing a mountain just to get one person on the phone, your offer isn't good enough. When the offer is right, you'll know - people will respond, book calls, and buy.

Now go build an offer so good it leaves nothing for your competitors.
